========================================

Oh for [Music] [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord you say that your desire and then you can be seated for a moment Amen we just want to take the time to say what a privilege it is to be here amen to be part of these services for myself and my wife amen we certainly love the Spencer family and all they have meant to us down through the years and I think as time goes on we need to hold to those even tighter amen and I just thank the Lord for for brother Ron and his ministry and how it's helped me in many ways both seen and unseen and I have leaned on on his advice I know I know he has a big sense of humor and there's a lot of he's been called names he's been called a clown and everything else and he probably is but but he's just been a real friend to me and while I'm a clown too so I can say that clowns know each other right does that all right and so I just appreciate him and his family we love his extended family amen and and we love his church you're a wonderful group to preach to you make it amen half the work is sometimes that people have to move into the same channel in order for the word to go for so you're blessed here you're blessed with the minister you have you're blessed amen to be a part of this family and we just appreciate the privilege of being able to be here and I want to thank brother Ron for everything you've done for us brother we sure love you too amen and God is good to us amen and all that he's done and all that he says is doing and we know that He loves us and how do we know that he loves us the Prophet said because he said so that's all you need to know he said he loved you he's not taking it back he can't change his word he's the same yesterday today and forever he don't try to refigure out creation he already done it he already fought it and all it is is coming to fulfillment and we're a part that and we're so thankful to be a part of that now brother Matt told me that this was an eight-hour microphone or battery he said when it runs out just I have to turn the lights off so I whatever that meant we just try to figure it out but you know I had read this I had read this statement or this little story and I just wanted to say it to you before we get into the word and the scripture says behold the kingdom of God is within you I had read a story and of course it's just a story but to bring the point out it talked about a man that lived in a certain state - very shabby and poor rundown state in it and the house that he lived in was shabby and rundown the town he lived in was a depressed town and the place was in a strong economic depression overrun with poverty and needs and things weren't looking good but one day he was rummaging around in a pile of items that had been discarded from from the local flea market and things have been tossed aside nobody wanted any of them something caught his eye and what caught his eye was a vase that was there and and it was unbroken he could see he had been abused but it and suffered but it was unbroken and unmarked and it was beautiful it was and it was a beautiful constructed vase and so all the trashy surroundings made the contrast of that beauty stand out even more so he took it home and he placed it on the mantel that was in his home and he would sit in his dingy living room and he would look at that vase and and just stare at it and day after day he would he would just look upon this rare and beautiful thing that he'd brought into his home but one day is as he was looking at this vase he realized how cluttered his mantel was with other things and how stained the wall was with poverty so he cleaned the junk off the man own he put a fresh coat of paint upon the wall and just by doing that it caused the vase to stand out even more an even greater beauty than what it had been before because now the inn our wall took on the look of a beautiful painting and so it just brought him joy to see it one day as he entered into that living room he noticed how worn the carpet was and how tattered the furnishings were so he pulled the carpet out and he uncovered a beautiful hardwood floor and he he cleaned that he recovered the furnishings and he transformed the look of the entire room and that that being made him to begin to renovate his entire house once finished he he was delighted in how beautiful his house looked but it started somewhere it started when he brought this beautiful thing into his home and then he noticed the beauty of his house showed him how overrun his yard was and how cluttered up the yard was with weeds and junk and the fence was broken down and the outside of his home looked weathered and wasted so he set about making repairs and cleaning up the yard and soon his home became the talk of the neighborhood for it brought a sense of hope to those that lived around him before long the other homeowners begin to do the same thing they begin to clean up their homes and pretty soon the entire neighborhood was transformed and became the talk of the town and the town itself began to change clean the trash off the streets repaired the broken windows repainted faded homes refurbished Bennis businesses and rekindled dreams and soon the town became the garden spot of the whole entire state meanwhile the man said in his home and looked upon that rare and beautiful vase because his whole life had been transformed by the beauty of it I believe sometimes we don't realize the beauty and power of the message at God has brought to us that when we bring it into our homes it shouldn't leave our homes in the cluttered and trashy state with stained walls and broken-down furniture but amen the very the very beauty of the pearl of great price is a such transforming power that when you take it within yourself you can never remain the same again this message is not interested in just giving you an intellectual dialogue but this message is - about transforming you amen from one life to another life but it's not just about transforming you but want to transform you it begins to transform what's around you such as the power of this message that we have coming say man how many appreciate this message I do we thank God for what has come our way hallelujah and it just didn't come our way God sent it to us blessed be the name of the Lord Alleluia and if God sent us his message he sent us his message cause he has a work to do we have something to do and I just want to read this quote as we begin to start he said remember if God has a work for you to do all the demons out of torment cannot stop you you ever feel like you're gonna be stopped you ever feel like oh you just become discouraged and pull back well tell you there's not one devil in hell that can stop this bride from fulfilling the purpose God has placed her here for he said they can't startle you anyway God has got a purpose for the Holy Ghost Church and all the devil's of Hell will never be able to take it away God has got a purpose for and it'll never be destroyed until God lets it fulfill the purpose he's ordained it to do and it will I'm so thankful amen heavens and earth will pass away but my word can never pass away let's stand together amen I'll bless you this evening we appreciate amen this opportunity once again and we're looking for the Lord a man to move in a special way aren't you amen let's turn to the book of John the 10th chapter just going to read you two verses and I'll have you turn back to the book of Nehemiah chapter to jesus said in verse nine I am the door By Me If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture there's only one door and that's Jesus Christ the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly why does he come so that we might have life and have it more abundantly praise the name of the Lord Nehemiah chapter 2 verse 9 is Nehemiah is coming across the rivers to the governors and he gives him the Kings letters it says I came to the governor's beyond the river and gave them the Kings letters now the King had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me and when sanballat the horror night and Tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel you can be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word I want to title this tonight is last night we spoke upon two men that you don't want in your congregation and we had a spoke about what these spirits would try to do in any church and that would be to block it and to hinder it and to try to cast doubt into weaken the church you know this is all Satan can do is he's a destroyer so what does he try to destroy he tries to destroy faith he tries to destroy hope he tries to destroy attention he tries to destroy health he's a destroyer amen and we and we can never amen look at him and underestimate our adversary but we know Amen with the Word of God it is totally exposed his moves so that the only way we can be deceived by him as if we choose to be deceived by him amen and so now I want to title this and from this tenth verse and I'll title this tonight a man has come to seek the welfare of the people a man has come to seek the welfare of his people how many believe that man is here tonight now as we speaking on these men Tobiah and sim ballot and thus Arabian by the name of GCM there is a number of things that we will pull out of of of what they tried to do to Nehemiah and the purpose that he had and being there and I and as I identified these things I identified three things that they were coming against the leadership with and number one was they mocked the calling that they were under and that's what the enemy will do to you is he will try to establish doubt in you of the purpose of you being there if he can get you to doubt your calling if he can get you to doubt amen the message that God has called you with because let's be honest amen we've been called under the message of the our brother BAM said he never called my name he never said Danny steamin but when the word was broken this generation it was the Eagle word calling to the Eagle children can you say man and it was God calling you listen I didn't hear my name but I heard the message amen and that message had a resonance it resonated down in my soul I may not have understood everything I heard but I knew Amen that what I heard was doing something to me amen and so what the enemy was coming in to do he was trying to say well you're here but you're not here for the reason you think you're here I mean the purpose that you haven't been here it's not going to work it's too devastated this there's too much rubble where you going to start so he began to try to get into to down is calling and if he can muddy up that in your life you will not have faith in the Word of God everything he's trying to do is to cause you to doubt the word that you hold the scripture says to make your calling and election sure that's your purpose you have to have that established so that the enemy cannot move you off your course you must know that the voice of God that you've heard the voice that has called us out of darkness into the glorious line of the gospel that voice Amen is the voice of God that we call the message of the hour let me tell you the voice of God is more than the voice of William Branham is that right I mean that's what he said amen he said he said it gets my better judgment I wanted to be a trapper he said it wasn't me that was there on that River he said I was just standing by when he come near that's the man that come was the Lord Jesus Christ amen and it was his voice it was God using the voice of man that to speak through him to our hearts I mean he said that voice came through Malachi 4 and you recognize the voice of God for your day no doubt man you've heard this quoted many times but it's something special to me in the message looking to the unseen as he's speaking there at the end and in and he's coming into the he's already had him up at the altar for prayer to give their life to God but now it's coming to the healing of the sick and all of a sudden as he's as he's asking them to come and so forth and then his voice changes and he begins to say is he pulsating to you then he says I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost I'm the one that gives the promise brother Branham has nothing to do in this he has surrendered his life to me I'm using his spirit I'm talking through his lips that's me I'm the Lord come on church you know not everybody would have caught that as they stood there but there are some that we're hearing it and they knew that the ministry was outside than regular norm and there is something different that was happening there let me tell you I mean that same one that used brother Branham at that moment in history to speak the word and the scripture would be fulfilled that man has never left the building and you say man brother Branham might have left the building but that man has never left the building hallelujah I hope it's all right for me to just say this a little bit as you mentioned my dad and and then just come upon my heart just to read this quote to you and once you understand we have a calling Satan is here tonight to make us doubt that calling so he can make you because if he can cast doubt upon what you believe amen you won't use it to fight the enemy is that right and then the prophet of God said in greatest battle ever fought he said if he can make you think that your weapon is equivalent hey man let me tell you the weapon we hold is more than equivalent it's more than an equivalent to cancer it's more than equivalent to crippled conditions it's more than equivalent to the sin question come on it's more equivalent than any powers of darkness that are even trying to come in this room tonight Amen this weapon we have Amen the spirit of the word of God is sharper Amen Daan's than any two-edged swords Amen and Satan were trying to cast doubt upon that calling I tell you but he can't take away from you what God placed inside of you but the random was asked the question in 1964 there's just a little bit of my testimony but he was asked a question by my grandmother in 1964 and you can find it in the in the series of question and answers that I have two daughters married to men and denominations they believe this message they've taken a stand for it and have received opposition what shall we do brother man just made a short statement in reply to this question immediately he says hold your stand absolutely show your colors that's it don't give in to them listen listen he said hold your stand show your colors absolutely don't give in to them you know somebody can be in a lifetime of misery gone through great pressure and here's a prophet just standing there answering this question just given a few words hold your stand show your colors absolutely he said now I don't say don't go among them and fellowship or something but as long as you can fellowship but when they come to changing the diet a dove can't eat with a buzzard so he's telling he says he's telling my mother basically you can go among them but don't let them change your diet don't let them change what you're feeding up on and hold your stand now it's easy to say it from the pulpit hold your stand but I mean you've got to go home and live with it you've got to get there under the presser and it becomes so hard amen you're not sure if it seems like your reason as being tore apart and you're like I don't know how I don't think I have the strength to stand oh don't tell me you haven't had those things come at you and if you haven't you will I want to drop in a verse Amen that that Daniel wrote down talking about the restoration alone you understand this is the same atmosphere when he said that the wall would be built in trouble as times and that word trouble is one of a mental and spiritual anguish that'd be such a great anguish in such a troubled time of troubled minds amen but a word from God let me tell you one word from God Amen is enough to change the system that changed the whole life pattern that changed the whole situation in a moment's time that's why we cannot take a service like this in East any weekend for granted amen because Satan to try to try the desire out of your life a mean that you will even come and fellowship Amen but the word says Amen even so much the more as we see the Day approaching why don't let the devil change your diet [Applause] hey you know the devil's come to me Matt and many times and doubted my experience with God I won't tell you why the devil doubts your experience you want me tell you why the devil doubts your experience how many's ever had their experience doubted my rescue I'm really curious why you're not raising your hand oh let me ask you another friend says the devil ever talk to you I don't know I mean mm-hmm my wife does and that's not what I asked it's not the devil or his sister amen amen you know some people that mister become so so relaxed that they don't even pay attention to the things going around them but the enemy coming your doubt your experience until you know you don't have an experience you know but there's anchors that God has placed in your life a meaning that you look back and you see all that the devil was trying to do they're trying to drive us away from this message of the hour that's why he's questioned it the way he is because he knows this life-changing experience let me tell you this message is not an organization it's not a place that prints books Amen this message is the promise of God that he promised in this hire I will restore my word amen Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 God said I will restore saith the Lord this isn't the mind of man this is the mind of God it may not mean much to you but this is part of my testimony this very quote here is a prophet a prophet of God answering my grandmother my mother was under opposition from my dad and I could remember she would take me to house meetings as a child and my dad would take me to his church and I would hear my daddy tell me don't believe what your mother believes but you know even before I was born there was a word from a prophet hold your stand what was it Satan was trying to get him to doubt their calling my mother told me one time she said the the pressure got so severe cuz my dad would kick her out of the home throw her her clothes out of the home tell her to get back to her parents and all of these things and he was trying to crush what God was doing in her life hey man and she would go back home and and and and she told me said sometimes I just have to talk to my grandmother excuse me her mother my grandmother and say mom are you sure are you sure this message is the truth you know your mind might say what was she doubting the message let me tell you you can get under so much pressure the enemy comes down upon you enemy against even as brother branham got under pressure and begin to open his mouth say then I'll no longer serve God maybe we can get under so much pressure that our mind begins to doubt do I have what's real is this really the truth is this message really the truth or is it just another charge is it just another man and my grandmother would say you know where could we go what else is the truth that has to be you might think that's nothing you know well that's just people having a conversation but when it means your family when it means your children we didn't mean same you may lose them for the rest of your life you're deadly sincere when you come into that moment my family's all from the north they're from Ohio I was born in Florida there's a reason I was born in Florida I was born there because my dad was trying to get my mother out of the message so I'm a Floridian by the predestinated mercy of God and it's nothing that's there's nothing political you do everything in his power to take this out of my mother and but brother Bantam said hold fast it might have just been a simple answer as a man to see maybe his attention wasn't fully on the question hold fast show your colors I can remember how my dad treated my mother and that day came after 10 years of this persecution that day came when she wanted to go to her brother's baptism and and asked my daddy said can I go to my brother's baptism he said if you go when I get back he said I'm gone and the kids are going with me I'm finished with it so he threatened her with losing her entire family my mother made the choice in that moment I'm gonna go anyhow you know she came and she came willing that her family wasn't gonna stop her from going on with God even if it was children of her own womb she was going to make a choice to stand with Jesus I want to tell you when a man comes to seek your welfare he's not going to stand by with folded arms and watch you crash and burn him in but he will put you through a test to see do you really believe amen Abraham if you really believe me go take Isaac up on that mountain and sacrifice him a man he knew what they meant abraham believed but he wanted abraham to see what he believed he wanted abraham to know that our God is Jehovah Jireh he's not just a message we heard about he's a God Amen that provides in the moments blessed be the name of the Lord you want to try to tell me this message isn't the truth you want to come along and question all say no brother Adam he was a false prophet his mess untrue Wow all I can tell you is what I was called under and all I can tell you what it is produced in my family and all I can tell you Amen when my dad made that debt that altar made him with my mother my mother said I want to go anyhow there was another man stepped in the room right at that moment and that was that unseen presence Amen and my mother came in by making that stand hold fast and show your colors it brought God upon the scene and my daddy turned around and said I'll take you and was baptized a week later let me tell you tonight there's a man that has come to seek your welfare he is here to accomplish the word that he has promised in your life hey man brother John he knows your life he knows your life and I am come that you might have life and you might have him more abundantly let me tell you brother Ron amen my daddy thought he can break our family up and God said amen you've already lost this battle not only will I change your life you're gonna preach this message for me you don't think I didn't have an effect on me and you want to come and tell me this message is just men's ideas who was it that came down who was it that came down and backed up the word of a prophet hold fast show your colors don't go change your diet you see that Satan questioning your calling God said make it sure know who called you oh let me tell you I wasn't called by brother Ron I wasn't called by any other man though God could use the agency of man to preach the gospel and the foolishness of preaching to send the world out but God amen before the foundation of the world place something inside of me that would only respond back to a certain sound hey I said in many of mennonite service and it never did one thing for me then and it doesn't do anything for me now but I'll tell you what under the sound aiming of the original diet it shopping for me you might say brother Danny I'm in need of restoration tonight well let me just tell you something get back to the original diet sure Satan's alive let me just let me just put a little word in your mouth hey man you may be beat down at the lowest level right now learn to say this Satan you're a liar you know I read my Bible and you're pointing at your ear brother Danny might know but you know we do things weird in Florida I read my Bible and I heard what Abraham did when he met Melchizedek will Melchizedek said blessed be the god possessor of heaven and earth amen Abraham turned right around and addressed the king of Sodom and talked exactly like Melchizedek did you know why the message came to you so God gave you a word that would defeat the devil any place anywhere any condition God can restore what you cannot what you call impossible God already knows the way you may have come to a dead end but it's just another Red Sea blessed be the name of the Lord so we see these men these brothers we don't want in our church mock they're calling again we see him in Chapter four they mocked their work first they mock their calling but then they didn't pay attention to him then as they saw them work they mock what they did and said it's week even a fox goes up and here knocked that wall down what they gonna do revive these stones in the day let me tell you there was something supernatural about Nehemiah building this wall it laid there for generations beaten down broken burned but in 52 days whether that in my life is such a mess I've tried it it don't work here yeah but you didn't bring the right man in you tried to do it but when the man who has come to seek your welfare comes in amen in 52 days time the entire wall was built back again that was a supernatural occurrence but God was using man to bring the restoration into vision oh they mocked their building they mocked their work called the Jews feeble oh you hear brother Rob preaches he just tries to work him up and they talk about the gift of God and they hit me you know what's what's that we're way past that yeah the problem of it is you haven't lived in that home you haven't walked in those shoes you don't know the circumstance behind that person's life you might just call this church a shout in church and call me a fighting dog I have right to be offended first I can be offended at my mother she was going to give me up I can be offended at Ron because he called me a fighting dog what in the world am I doing here I'll tell you what I'm doing here for Amy because it taught me a lesson that if you give your heart to God and you give yourself wholly to him you brought all of heaven behind you to back you up you're not just fighting this by yourself now trying to figure out is this right can I survive no but a man has come in a man that is your your welfare is his work can I say it again your welfare is his work blessed be that's why God asked men like brother Ron and he's got preachers like brother Andrew brother Matthew and brother Amen William and all those that are caught because God will use something that looks feeble we could destroy that work just a little fox go up and knock the wall down but if God built it a gates of Hell will not prevail so if God if Satan can't cause you to doubt your purpose here cause you to doubt your work in other words you're not a very good Christian you know this not only affected their work when he began to say that how weak it was the Bible says they it weakened their families in chapter 3 deals with the manner in which Israel would rebuild their walls and it would be the wall by their house the wall that was to be built was the wall by their house the wall would be revealed be rebuilt family by family and remember the message that Nehemiah has hid in his heart the burden of God is one of restoration he saw the mess Bible says in chapter 2 that he went out by night and no man saw him do it and he went and he saw how broken down it was and he never came back and preached the message on why I'm going to go back to the Babylon because his message is too hard he never looked at all the rubble of broken lives and said this is too hard but he went back and spoke to Israel and said the hand of God is upon me to do this work you see what God had to do was to get him to look away from the rubble first and to look at the purpose of God so they could deal with the rubble because if the hand of God comes upon you your turn and look at the ruin with inspiration instead of discouragement the reason some of you aren't getting anywhere in your life is because you're trying to operate under the Word of God through discouragement it'll never work remember you get up every morning say I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me and when Satan came in to doubt their purpose how didn't Nehemiah fight it you see Satan's fighting me tonight that's all he can try to do but what did Nehemiah do he turned their words of these doubters into prayers like arrows amen and again Nehemiah knows that Satan is trying to weaken the people through doubt or through the work of God so he told the people that were ever he blew the tree but this was the place of focus wherever the word is being preached at that moment it is the place of importance whether it be over by this family or by that family over there or that family in the back of the family in the front wherever the trumpets being blown don't get turned off by the sound of the trumpet that's where we're supposed to rally in fight don't sit there and say the preachers preaching on me again no the trumpet is blowing by your law because the enemy is there it might make some people uncomfortable when the trumpets blown by the wall but if you realize that this is the threat of the enemy that's causing the trumpet to be blown whether it's the subject of holiness where there's doctrinal issues whether its family issues whether it's marital issues whether it's personal issues you must realize the trumpet is blowing for your good don't get offended by the blowing of the trumpet this is restoration you only look at rebuke but this is a restoration so Nehemiah I encourage the people to be more vigilant on the walls notice now how he has them work he made sure that when they went to work they carried a weapon one hand worked and the other held a weapon daniel said the wall would be built in trouble as times 52 days under extreme pressure they built the wall trouble astons that word troubles me angry Sh pressure if you go study that word it means that pushed into a tight place Paul called it perilous times because it's average the time of restoration so amen so he made them work with a weapon in their hand and I want to tell you this that's our answer for the pressure of this day if you can't work and hold your weapon you better review your consecration to God here's another tactic there's three tactics cause they Madonna's calling calls him to doubt his purpose and then the other tactic was he tried to undermine his position by sending out an open letter and making false accusations against him amen and then by trying to tell him that there's a threat upon your life and let me tell you there wasn't only true prophets prophesied in that hour but the Bible tells us in Malachi there was false prophets also prophesying that's the age we live in it's a mix of voices so you understand when the restoration was coming I mean there was true voices like amen like Ezra had with Haggai and Zechariah like Nehemiah had with Malachi but there was also false voices and they're all prophesying they're all preaching they're all saying things and in the people of Judah and Israel they're being pulled both ways what are we going to do and the reason was it of it was because God was coming to restore and he wasn't just building a wall he was purging the people and putting him in the rightful positions so they could come back to true worship God doesn't want you just to jump and shout and hide a house full of rubble he wants you to jump and shout that when you land back down you're not going to land upon a brick or something that's laying in your way and break your foot that's why so many people are up and down they still got rubble so they try to draw you away from your purpose and that's what they did with me and mine come meet us come they kept trying to get him into a meeting oh it's real important you come have a meeting but he had come with the letters from the king he wasn't there to meet with them he was there to meet with the people that God wanted to restore tried to draw him away just like Satan tries to draw you away and they tried to elevate their importance to him and to engage him with the problem at hand that they themselves are stirring up and occupy your time let me just say this I trust this is all right don't get beyond my voice here all right if for some reason what you are doing is now more important to you than the message you've been listened you've been listening to the wrong voice and you've been draw it out where were they trying to draw a man trying to draw me am I out - the Bible says the plains of Oh No maybe that's where a lot of people get in trouble oh no out there no no that was just a southern take on it what is happening to Israel when they begin to listen to those voices they weaken their hands that's not referring to your literal strength that's referring to your conviction we live in trouble as times what the Bible tells us in spite of all of that 52 days the wall is built you know why a man had come to seek the welfare of his people brother Branham said in in in the message God of his evil age what would God call a people out of this evil age for what would he call them out for his name for he said the reason is is to try her the purpose of the evil age is to try her when she has been tried and been proven and proved to Satan you say God will use me to prove a point to Satan he will do that he said like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end and he goes on to say we find this evil Aegis to prove to Satan that this woman is not like Eve she's not that type of woman should be tried by the word and as Adam's bride believed every bit of the word but confused on one promise he's the same yesterday today and forever today see she failed under that temptation of the enemy face-to-face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride and she comes in contact again by the same thing not just denominational truth but every word so God is not just trying you to say yeah I came out of the Baptists are no longer Baptists I've been tried and proven no every word he's trying her by to see that she'll be faithful to stand there and this work is completed I had had a woman come to my church one time and she was reading the tracts that I had in the back and one of them was on the original sin and she was reading it and she got so angry and she jumped up and ran out of her Church and disappeared off the grounds where the ron's been there but the Matthews been there you know we're out in the country so we didn't know where she disappeared to so we had the Deacons going up and down the road trying to find her and I couldn't find her and I hadn't seen there was a lane across the highway it it said no trespassing I said a she's up there and so I went up the lane there's a house up there and she's sitting on the porch of the house and she is steaming mad not steaming mad steaming mad and she's up there and and and I come up to her said I said ma'am first I start calling her sister he's trying to beat your sister why don't we come you know this is private property we're not supposed to be here let's go back let's talk about whatever has made you some man and she goes you know somebody's got to do something about your church and what you believe I said well sister let's go talk about don't call me sister I said well ma'am let's go let's talk about but this we're not supposed to be here she was all right so we come back inside of the church inside of it and she said there she put her hands out she's Oh God a man she goes god help these people show them their blindness they're in a court set him free and I said well ma'am that's really good I said you know my daddy hated the message like you did I said in fact he said if William branham's in heaven I don't want to go now not to me that's a stupid statement I don't care if every lineage of the Pope is in heaven I want to be there amen because something happened to him amen and so many but he didn't have that revelation as a Mennonite I reckon but he said if William Brennan was in heaven I don't want to be there and I told this one I said that's what he said she goes bless his heart I said you see that church right there and she goes yes and that my dad built that so I got hope for you that even in your anger a mean that God can be merciful I said let's go talk about what your problem is well her problem was she had hair up to here she goes well let's sit down and talk so we said another pivot and I said what do you want to talk about she goes I want done by first Corinthians 11 said okay let's talk about it far as I know I got the upper hand but Penda so she be getting to say T I get to drink tea at the Paul got any food I'm gonna have dinner tonight while you guys listen to me preach this is great told me at brother Ron's thank you so we sat down and we begin to talk well she didn't want to discuss the Bible she wanted to talk out of men's books that have written about the Bible she started off with all kinds of words that you know only a few sets of people understand I you know I understood him halfway you know what I mean they did too trying to throw you with their intellectualism and I said man that word that you're saying I didn't find that one in the Bible and so amen so she she kept quoting all these books and I just kept quoting the scripture that's all I did quote scripture watch her reaction she kept quoting these books I said that's not in the Bible and I quote the Bible she quote another thing I said that's not in the Bible when I quote the Bible she got angry again couldn't help it I made her mad she jumped out of her seat and she said I know where you're getting that I said where am I getting that she goes you're getting that from william branham I said ma'am you didn't want me to call your sister so I call you ma'am I said you've just paid in the greatest compliment I said because from the time we began to talk you quoted other men's books I've done nothing but quote the scripture to you I want you to know brother and sister but we were caught under we were caught under the message of the hour you got a word birth you got a word calling you got a word purpose [Applause] yeah [Applause] hallelujah I wasn't caught under some man's college I was called up what is [Applause] better just slow down and be teacher Lee I've never done this before all the sisters are jealous I'm a tease well I'm a preaching like this I want to just say this when they came back for restoration God never brought the best people he bought was best for him he didn't bring the most qualified he brought those that were elected and those that were elected came out as weary captives no song no energy no conviction they just they were just happy to to come back to a place that was ruined and to live in it and they settled for a ruined desert a place that had a glorious past but I want you to know our God isn't just about the past [Applause] when he said a man has come he didn't say a man did come he said a man has come amen to seek the welfare of the captives of the desolate misty works whatever is in it give the recipe to my wife it's a group that's used to captivity some of you might be sitting here tonight use to your situation used to what you're setting in and your life becomes adjusted to the condition but that is never the purpose of God to adjust lives to what has been destroyed when God comes he said I'm gonna do something in this restoration that is going to be glorious before the whole world and the world may not recognize what it is but it's going to be there because my expression is Jerusalem remember brother Branham said in the church age book and he talked about in and in I believe it right at the end of the resume of the ages or the layout have seen one of those he says he talks about the heavenly Jerusalem he said every facet of her beauty tells a story of Amazing Grace that means that these were living stones that the enemy had said one time what are these feeble Jews going to revive these stones again that means stones had a testimony to tell they had a work to do in your life when it's out of place you may just feel like I'm just rolling along with no purpose in life I come to church I have a desire I want to be right but you just don't have no energy a mentor to be able to perform what God has called you to do that's what this message is to come to set your life in order to come to restore what you lost hope for there is not a person in this building that the Holy Spirit has looked at and shook its head and said it's too hard you might have shook your head many a night and said it's too hard but the Holy Spirit never hovered over that home and looked at you and said I can't do that neither did he go into a dark place and says it's too dark neither did he go into the most impure place and say I can't fix it but the call of restoration is as brother venom said and restoration or riot tree no matter how low no matter how impure no matter what the condition is amen the call of the Holy Spirit is to give it back that's what we're here tonight to say is that Satan if the Holy Spirit says give it back Satan can not stop what the Holy Spirit is giving then what is my job to do under that inspiration my job is to raise my hand and say yes Lord I agree with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit [Applause] you might be somebody that's weary in captivity and doesn't have a mind to build you might be somebody who's easily overcome by perceived threats one of the greatest pressure of this age is nerves I know what it's like I know what it's like to have your nerves come to a situation where it feels like it's going to break I thank the Lord for for somebody like my wife who could stand there in between me and situations and I think the Lord for ministries that was sensitive to the Holy Spirit to call me up and tell me what the Holy Spirit told them because I know what it's like to be embarrassed and to be there with your nerves at a breaking point and you don't want to face the people and any effort you put out you feel like you're going to to to bring up and everything else and no strength and a fear that anything I do I'm just gonna break down God is still God he's got to work for you to do even through your weakness here come and make that weakness glorify the word of God he's all right there just a brief time in in not in 2016 and I was under attack by a spirit and I didn't know what it was and I was embarrassed Here I am as a preacher prep pastor in the church and I'm supposed to be the strong one and I was the weak one I was embarrassed and it was a stretch of two weeks I'd come off a lot of meetings and been overseas and my body was tired and was dealing with situations at home church for some reason home churches have problems I know this isn't a home church I'm it's a visiting Church I'm visiting it when brother Rahm preaches it's a home church something would come in my room every morning around four o'clock in the morning and it wasn't a good spirit it was an evil spirit and it would try to it would stand there it was so real to me that I would try to see it and my nerves was at a breaking point my wife had this ask somebody she knew not even a believer now this will blow your mind if you got one it's a Catholic woman she was acquainted with never been never been to Florida or where we live never been in her church obviously we don't do Hail Marys there have mass when she rotors and if you believe in prayer pray for my husband he's gone through some things and that woman wrote back and she described our church described where people sat in the church and then told how I've said in here probably your husband's problem is he's got some witches in the church he's got more than one that's all I need witches you know we fight a real enemy got enemies here tonight and I told my wife I told her then I said well she's a Catholic and she's gonna say things like that I know know what the scripture says that the sin of rebellion is as witchcraft we were going through things in our church and weed went away for a few days as resting as it was coming home brother Ron called me he said I can tell you right where I was at on my more as I was mowing he said the Holy Spirit told me says call Danny and tell him he's been attacked by a spirit of witchcraft so I had a Catholic tell me I had witches I had a message friend and minister tell me I was attacked by my spirit of witchcraft you know I'll tell you in that moment all my embarrassment left and all my fear left because I knew then when I was being attacked by I wasn't healed but the fear was gone I can't describe it to you because you have to be in it to understand it but I was in it and the Lord through that unveiling exposing that spirit so you have to bring him to light when he exposed that spirit it gave me the mind of God to understand what I was facing and then to know when God was telling me how to deal with it and what he told me to deal with it said don't do anything and I did nothing for a couple months with him when he told me I want you to preach this and I preached it on my birthday which is Christmas and yes I was born on Christmas not Jesus thank you for all the clapping not the decorations because I know they're not for me so I preached it on my birthday and I preached what the Lord had laid on my heart and it drove the spirit out of the church so the Lord had given me the wisdom by using brothers like brother Ron I appreciate you brother Ron and and it gave me that needed strength I wasn't healed but I was delivered of that fear and about eight months later I'm in overseas in Romania or the William right close to where your family comes from at a youth camp and it got really hot it was a about a hundred and two everyday and the meeting was is an outdoor format it had a roof over but the back was open so it was always really hot and where we slept we we only had a fan just moved the hot air around so you could sleep but not rest and so your body starts getting really tired and and I felt that thing come back I preached Thursday night Friday morning Friday night Saturday morning and Saturday night I was going to continue on the same thought and between services that fear came back and I felt it come back and I felt like I was going to preach the second part of that morning service all inspiration left me all I had was fear and I'm literally walking to the pulpit praying to the Lord you have to help me I said I don't feel no inspiration I feel that fear coming back and I can't operate under that you have to help me I got up and preached I preached the subject that I was I was intending to preach on and the Lord got in it and he helped the people and they responded I didn't feel anything in myself but I was able to preach it but then at the end of the service there was a minister sitting on the front row he came up and he spoke to the other ministers and he told them something I'm the only one that knew what I prayed and he told him he said the entire time I preached there was a man that stood behind me and my arms while I preached I'm the only one that knew what I prayed for now you're gonna say well brother Danny we're way beyond the supernatural that don't mean anything to me I know it might not mean anything to you but I know what I prayed and I know the moment that I got healed because it was in that moment that God healed me you know why hey man he said I am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly amen your fear will not stop the healing Amen but you got to look to him and understand that if you were in the middle of that fear look to that man for help he said I'm a present help in the time of trouble I'm not a guy that just got you in I'm a guy that'll get you out that should be the name [Applause] so I think the Lord and I used to be a person that was a little shy about testifying about those things but I understand if I testified about it it would also talk to somebody else I was in the exact same position and they would begin to realize if God did it for that boy he'll do it for me and I want you to know he's the same yesterday today and forever here do it for any condition if it was me hey let me tell you something if God will hold my arms up here hold your arms up if God will stand behind me he'll stand behind you but he wants you to know are you gonna continue on even when the devil says you can't do it I'm gonna keep on recipe I praise the Lord [Applause] God wants to know will you say though God slays me yet I'll trust him amen what can separate me from the love of Christ if you have a nervous condition tonight if it was me I would raise my hand and say God if you healed that man you'll heal me there's a man here to seek your welfare what is the Holy Ghost for brother Ram said the Holy Ghost is here to bring a person of Jesus Christ to you Nehemiah might have felt you excuse me as I drink tea only then keeping my voice alive him and Nehemiah might have thought he was just another person in his time of history deciding to build walls but God was saying it's a pattern and it's a type aiming that the god of history is going to build up the walls again of many desolations of many generations your family's past might not have been able to stop it but God says in you I will stop it and I was so restoration in your life that what they couldn't overcome you overcome [Applause] that's what Nehemiah's talking about let me tell you if Abraham could learn to copy Melchizedek I came to you have a right to quote what the king of heaven says I have a right to tell the devil he said that I would be where he is it was a prayer of Jesus you've never stopped it before god knows what you're craving for rather random ascending things that are to be so there's something in you that that body needs there that craving is in you you're sitting here tonight craving God will bring a man across a platform to give you exactly what you have need of that's why God has pastors evangelists fivefold ministry Amen because there's a craving in you amen for that other side and it needs what you're craving for I say it again there's a man come seek your welfare be yours your brother Danny I got a lot of ruins around my life aren't you glad somebody's not ashamed to look at the ruins and said let's pick it up his understand the brother man said if we could only realize he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose to release our desires that we have in him to us I'll ask you a question do you have a desire in him he's here tonight to release it to you but we got to recognize his presence and I had some crackers now it's a good idea I want to start my church on a whole other thing the house a fellowship end of tea so it's important to understand that this restoration was accomplished by prophets prophets come and smoke it and God said I'll fulfill it amen I just want to say this because I want you to turn with me in your Bibles to Nehemiah 3 this is important to understand we won't hold you much longer but Nehemiah chapter 3 is the only chapter in the entire Bible that gives us the entire circumference of Jerusalem and shows all the position of the gates and it's a very important chapter to - you know rather on and find out we get a certain age our words start changing I was gonna say it's a very important chapter to the astronomers and it sure isn't but the arkla archaeologist is right there's a difference some are in the dirt in the sky they be offended um so and so they say that this chapter is the only one where they can get the clearest picture of what Jerusalem would look like but I want to focus and I have been gone with my church through this and I just want to focus on on the first three gates but only really the first gate because God is saying something very important you know a city without walls and without gates is a city anything can take a city that can be taken but the purpose of gates is for coming out and going in it's an entrance that is made jesus said I am the it's an interest that has made that what may look like a wall will have a door in it and then not only that it's a place of judgment where they would use to judge a situation I want you to read this first verse of chapter 3 in Elias ship the high priest rose it says then he rose up with his brethren what why did it say then because a message had went forth had just went forth about the inspiration of God to restore and they heard the double announcement to them that God is restoring and to the enemy that they had no right no portion or Memorial in Jerusalem you see when God brings a message also addresses his enemy and it says then they rose up with his brethren the priests and they built the sheep gate they sanctified it they set the doors of it even in the Tower of maiya they say to fight it unto the tower of Hannah kneel now it's going to say about this gate this is the only gate that they sank to fight the rest of the wall when it was finished they they dedicated it but this one they built and then they sanctified it and next to him built the minute Jericho and next to them built a deck or the son of Emery but the fish gate did the sons of Hass and I build who also laid the beams arrived and set up the doors or the locks there Evan the bars or if I want to read that last part again because it's important it says they set up the doors the locks and the bars and nexon to them repaired Maremma the son of eret other son of cause and next to them repaired Michelle and the son of Barack I the son of mesma has that guy in Nexen to them repaired is that Ike the son of baina you we live in a different time and nexon to them repair that there are next in the Teal'c at the tech White's are repaired but their nobles putting out there next to the work of the Lord we find out these Nobles are in every church they come but they don't work you come to the revival but when the load is polling they're not there and God thought it was something that I need to write this down that in the middle of this work there would be a people that said I'm not going to help that while I'm restoring there's a people sitting there with her arms folded said that's not me does that put them in there moreover the old gate repaired Johanna the son of passeth and Michelle on the son of Masada they laid the beam thereof here again set the bars and the locks and the bars there and they set the doors the locks and the bars they're off so there's these two gates they set the doors the locks and the bars and next to them repaired melikhaya that give me night and Jade in the Monaro theit the men are giving the men of Misbah unto the throne of the governor on this side the river next to them repaired who's the eldest son of of Jorge of the Goldsmith's next to him repaired Hananiah the Sun of the apothecaries and they fortify Jerusalem unto the broad wall okay that's what I wanted to read to you significance of this to me as I read this number one is that first gate is the Sheep gate it doesn't have a lock on it because this is the first gate that God wanted established in Jerusalem was the Sheep gate and the Sheep gate is where the sacrificial lambs were brought to come through to go to the temple on the way for the sacrifice and God is standing there and says this gate has no bars no lock no man has a right to put a lock on the door of the sacrifice yeah I want you to know that door is open tonight and not only as the significance it didn't have no lock on it but it also said that the men of Jericho helped build it what was Jericho Jericho was the cursed City Joshua Kirsten said any man built it let him be curse and let their firstborn died in the building and God said I can take those out of the curse city and help him show what a restoration of a sheep gate is I want you to tell I want you to know something that's where the Lambs come through it's not your work it's his work and the first thing he wants you to know about all of this building and all of these gates is I'm not gonna ask you to do one thing until you recognize this God will never ask you to work until you realize who he is what good is it to try to restore something if I don't know what the purpose of him is if I don't see who he is and what he's done and the door that he walks through hey if God would not put a lock on his door then Who am I to say it's over Who am I to say he's not in his kinsmen work anymore come on that God would say not only is I have I restored that door I want you to look at the man I had helped it the men of the lowest city the men of the cursed city that if God could give them encouragement you understand what living in a cursed City would put over you put a question mark in your life am I cursed God said I want you to work right beside the high priest help us to have lease at gate let the people see and in these restored lives that sacrifice is still real and that's what God could take people in this room that their lives have been cursed and ruined and God that's out bring you out of the lowest condition and your lives will help establish that that gate has no lock on it if my life can say there's no lock on the door your life can say there's no lock on the door he's still the same yesterday today and forever hey I was not saved as a message believer I was saved as a sinner there's nobody born in a pure condition you came from the lowest of low but God said let your life slide right slide right into place what a beautiful gate God said I'm not gonna ask you to build a fish gate fishers of men without building a man establishing that the sacrifice still come through hey you know hundreds of years later Jesus Christ walked through that gate came up to the Pool of Bethesda five porches on it it was like a hospital people were laying everywhere and you know the water is only troubled at certain seasons by an angel the gate too many of them was locked and they're all watching the water and there was a man somewhere in that crowd who'd been in that condition for 38 years some of you have gave up hope but you've not been in your condition that long here's a man who didn't have no strength when the meeting was on to receive what was happening he couldn't get up he had a bed and he couldn't get up there was a man that day walked into that pool walked to the Pool of Bethesda and while everybody's got their eyes fixed on the water there's this man seeking the welfare winding his way through all the affirmed the afflicted the sick lying in his way and he's going to go to a man who's never been able to pick up his bed and walk he's never been able to accept that moment you know why brother John for 38 years he had his eyes on the other men trying to get help from them and he told Jesus I've been no man has put me in the water and I haven't been able to get in but there's a man who's come to seek his welfare and it wasn't just Jesus Christ Jesus said I only do that which my father shows me it showed the father from heaven had sent Jesus Christ to that man you know what Jesus asked him Jesus never said you know I can heal you he never said this is your day he says what do you want what do you want he was I want to be healed you know what the Holy Spirit does in every meeting what do you want I want the meeting to be over with no that's not what I'm thinking what do you want I want to be healed he said let him pick up your just pick up your bed and walk no wait a minute Lord how am I gonna pick up I said pick up your bed and walk I have not had to been able to have the strength but the strength givers here he didn't realize the message he was hearing told him that if you would choose what that gate represents your get up and walk I'll tell you if God sends a message I got a drink tea in order for this to come through if God sends a message here send a power behind it to perform it if God tells you to pick up the bed and walk that means there's a power there to do it God never asked you to sit there and say well I you know I I have laid in this condition for 38 years how is it gonna work tonight on December the 15th you ain't gonna work I've tried before but I don't know if the power ain't mean if the word is there to preach it the power is there to be released that should be the name of the Lord with the restoration of the word is the restoration of the power take up your bed and walk [Music] he picked it up and he began to wind his way through the crowd oh let me tell you this had not happened for 38 years here's a man a low caste man been raised up and he's walking at the critics look at that and they said it's on the Sabbath day you're not able to do it I bet you that boy was looking for things to carry come on man okay I just feel like carrying somebody you know I haven't walked for 38 years I want somebody to see what I can do hey let me tell you I don't care what day it's on all I know is a man is calm and salt my welfare and I got straight to walk that's a better name [Applause] you haven't been able to walk right there's a man here tonight that tells you to pick up your bed and walk you know what that means you know what that game is only the unusual things happen in this search to me you know what when God tells you to pick up your bed you know why he says you're not coming back to that place again [Applause] [Music] there's no room for me there anymore hey man I once was lost but now I'm found I once was blind but now I see I don't have to go back there again what a sheep gate you better establish first there Nehemiah that's what I want to establish first that gates wide open there's not a lock on it I want you to know that God is God hey man I'm the same God Amen that looked at the Red Sea with angry eyes and it parted I'm the same God that came in a pillar of fire Amen - Moses I'm the same God a mean that came to Paul on the road in Damascus I'm the same God that spoke through the lips of Jesus Christ I'm the same God that had his picture taken over William Branham in 1950 and that same God is here tonight the man that is come to seek your welfare [Music] glory glory and those Pharisees said it's not according to the word your healing is not according to the word but you know what I found out about the man who built the sheep gate Jesus Christ he deliberately does it on those days because he wasn't running from the confrontation of these critics he was running at these critics because these critics had laid over these people a me with their doctrines and their conditions and their criticisms for years and then people could not stand up and be free but he ran it's those critics because they were his people that's my man down there with that that lame condition could it be December the 15th at 8:20 in the evening that God said now is the time to pick up your bed and walk is that I can't do it this is the great thing about the building of this wall did you read that last verse that I read with you and I'm closing the Bible says that the Goldsmith's and the sons of the apothecaries helped in the building of the wall now the last time I looked brother William the Goldsmith's did not work with huge stones that would be slid into the wall he worked with little gems he had them real thick glasses little things but men were really willing to move outside of their own abilities and get into the spirit of restoration God said I'll use a goldsmith to roll a big stone and I'll use pill rollers apothecaries sons to come up and do something they're not used to doing I'm gonna use you as part of this restoration I can't do it i'ma go Smith get in there and pick that stone up I've equipped you to build the wall hey I'll tell you the inspiration of that man that inspiration of that man that inspired Nehemiah is still here tonight the same one that told me am i go build the wall is the same one telling you tonight pick up your bed and walk rise up out of your condition you may be somebody outside of your comfort zone but get in the will of God and watch him do it you know a goldsmith and the sons of apothecaries could have a lot of excuses but God said this message I don't need one of your abilities I just need your body brother Danny I'm so smart I'll put things together and I'll get things right God said I don't need you as a goldsmith I need you as a wall builder the man could have said but man my business is rolling I got good eye getting good money I don't have time to build a wall but it showed that men were willing to leave their business and get in the business of God you put God first watch the wall built there's a man here tonight I can turn on the light if you're in a sick condition I'd raise my hand and say god amen I'm accepting that you're here tonight and I believe that I'm healed in the name of Jesus Christ Satan says no what do I say he says no what do I say I say Satan that gate has no lock on it hey man it's only your voice trying to stop them but the inspiration of the Lord is here to say give it back give back their health get back their right mind get back to your job bring him back from the backslidden condition give him back their children brother branham walked into a restaurant looked at condition and said oh god you have to raise my children in this why don't you destroy it all he looked at a woman with blue hair sitting at a table with two men drinking beer he looked at a cop with his arm around a underaged girl gambling he looked at all the sin in that place and asked God to destroy it all brother branham didn't know that his own thoughts was a lock across the door of the Seabee aid and the angel says get behind the door and something God had to pull a prophet behind the door in order to show him an open door he pulled him behind the door and he got back there and he said I saw the world Amen in the blood of Jesus Christ going around it and he said and I saw my sins going up and hitting that blood said every time it hit the blood he said I'd see Jesus Christ standing there he jerked every time it hit him and he said Oh God and he said Lord is that my sins he says that's your sins said God forgive me said he reached over in his side took that bloody hand and he rode across the book pardon and he threw it behind him and then he said the angel turned and looked at that woman with blue hair you know the angel turned and looked why did he turn and look he wanted brother Brennan to look he said I forgave you but you condemned her what was he showing him the sheep gate has no lock on it you condemned her but it's still open he said I went back to that woman let me tell you what a vindicated prophet did Malachi Ford then he went back to that woman and asked if he could sit with her and she mistook her his intention and he she said I've already got come he said I don't mean it that way he said I want to talk to you about your life and he told her about what had just happened to him he said I was standing there condemning you and then God showed me my own sense and a prophet of God asked this blond had this blue headed alcoholic woman to forgive him that's how open the Sheep gate is forgive me I was condemned and you know what that prophet asking for that forgiveness opened up the doors of her life and she told him how it happened and right there he led her back to Christ I'll tell you tonight the Sheep gate is open and there's a man calling I've come to seek your welfare why don't we close our eyes bow our heads but some musicians would come as Satan told you it's too late oh I realize I may not be talking to the whole building but I'm talking to someone [Music] enemies already told you there's bars across it it's locked it's not for you but did the holy spirit come to you tonight and tell you try again he said brother that had tried before but he said try again want you to try if you have a had strength to walk right in you have a had strength to get into that bowl of water I Got News for you you don't have to get into any pool you got to realize there's a man here that's cooked to you he sought your welfare he spoke to your heart and now he asked you a question do you want strength to walk right why don't you lift your head and say God you spoke to my heart tonight I want to pick up that bed and walk and I'm not gonna go back to that condition again the inspiration of the holy ghost is here tonight to make your body obey your confession you say God I accept that in Jesus name in heavenly Father I pray for every hand that has raised you knowing Lorne the condition that is beneath the hand and why they would raise it go Lord I ask you tonight hey man that that gate represented brother Adam said that she gave that pole

you better have big plans I don't know about you you know you hear the critic scream at you this weekend it was a reminder they're supposed to do it yeah they're supposed to talking you either it's just what you do with it when they talk into it they can laugh at your wall it made to fall down but they didn't use this building it's him [Applause] I want to thank with the Danny and sister Michelle put forth the invitation and they prayed about it and here they are and I believe it that's been absolutely orchestrated here's what I find interesting that brother Danny one of his friends in Europe is a translator and as a pastor and it's been a buzzing bit buddy of brother Danny's for literally years and he is going to brain brother Jackie Benton to next Sunday's me Daniel major from the Czech Republic he said if Europe Danny Stevens friend you're my friend you say well brother Anya never met that man did you trust him with all my life so he is gonna bring our buddy that just lost his wife yeah they're going to come I think they're gonna be late to her meal but we gonna we gonna treat them I've got rules for him to stay in we're gonna feed them and Jackie bevel is wrong Jackie Benton is royalty you see he's living in an old house that's falling apart and his wife has went home to be with the Lord and he's going to be there in a few days this may be the last visit to have brother Jackie with us I want you to take advantage of it don't worry about but shake his hand and say thank you you preach to people I would never get to preach to it but the Danny's sitting here he said I didn't realize what a great man brother Jackie was until we was in the jungles and we were stepping over snakes and he said the little children came out said that hello brother Jackie he was a celebrity in that neighborhood and they wouldn't even believe us he said I found out what a great man Jackie Bibby news he probably has more miles on his odometer than any preacher ever has and I'm not saying that just for granted but he's gonna be at our Munich's next Sunday I think that's all frustrated about God I've been interesting that Daniel major is going to be the one that brings him and he's brother Danny's friend you see there's a problem is getting around or around the world that is coming together yeah and there's people in Romania that's that's really real important for the week important on where they come from in Romania the city that they come from brother Danny has been preaching in that city for years and he moved here from Mobile Alabama to be a part of us and we bring God that's been missionary in the place where your daddy came from for years this thing that changed me you not I'd like to say this to you we are entering this is season of it yes many of you will get together it will be a busy time over the next couple of weeks you'll be going from house to house to eat Sharon and get the presents and given presents sharing with one another interchanging with one another talking to friends and neighbors and loved ones not parade through this season that it would be more than a historical story but Jesus would be at your house you see brother Ray said it before and I want to finish with this at my house it was a cabin some of you haven't been there but it was a cabin and then I built a kitchen on it and I built a bedroom on it and an office on and I was studying in my office and then walk out into the cold and then go into my room and I would leave that presence and I would go into my house and it would just seem like I was leaving a meeting and then walking out and trying to go back into it and I wanted to build a house to where that his presence would be all over that house now I don't care what size your house is I want it to be that in your life not just in the pastor's home but you make him welcome in every room of your house while these were these walls are being built we're praying for revival for our church like never before getting us ready for the rapture but take this home moms dads young people make him welcome welcome make him welcome at your house but the Jason many people come into my house and they said man you must love church to have a steeple a roof at all you must love Church you know I don't know where I built it to look like a church but I built it to where the church the god of the church could live in it and he's more than a baby to me sister Michelle I love you your family your boys your daughter-in-law baby I'd like you to pray for them tomorrow they're flying in the morning we're gonna take
