[44:34] chapter 23 in verse 9 and the lord spake

[44:56] lord to be accepted for you
[44:59] on the moral
[45:00] after the sabbath the priest shall wave
[45:03] it revelations chapter 1
[45:07] revelation chapter 1 and verse 12 this
[45:09] afternoon
[45:13] i know we have some that are out sick
[45:15] this weekend so we want to be
[45:16] remembering them in prayer as well
[45:23] amen
[45:28] many are the afflictions of the
[45:30] righteous but the lord delivers him all
[45:33] revelations chapter 1 and verse 12
[45:35] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[45:37] with me and being turned i saw seven
[45:41] golden candle sticks and in the midst of
[45:43] the seven golden candle sticks one like
[45:45] unto the son of man clothed with a
[45:47] garment down to the foot and a girt
[45:50] about the pabst with a golden girdle
[45:52] and his head and his hairs were like
[45:55] oh as white as snow and his eyes were as
[45:58] a flame of fire and his feet like on the
[46:01] fine brass as if they had burned in a
[46:04] furnace and his voice as the sound
[46:06] of many waters and he had in his right
[46:08] hand seven stars
[46:10] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[46:11] two-widget sword and his countenance was
[46:13] as the sun shineth in his strength and
[46:16] when i saw him i fell at his feet
[46:19] as dead and he laid his hand laid his
[46:22] right hand on me
[46:24] and saying unto me fear not i am the
[46:26] first and the last
[46:28] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[46:30] behold i am alive forevermore amen and
[46:34] have the keys of hell
[46:36] and of death may god bless his word you
[46:38] may be seated in the presence of the
[46:39] lord
[46:40] i think it's amazing to not to be able
[46:43] to recognize that we are not just
[46:44] looking at jesus through a glass darkly
[46:46] but we are seeing him face to face and
[46:49] you begin to think about all of the
[46:51] prophets throughout the throughout the
[46:52] old testament that they longed to look
[46:54] on him but here that we recognize that
[46:57] we are looking upon jesus face to face
[46:59] when brother branham would lay that out
[47:00] in the church age book we see his seven
[47:02] personages that are laying right here
[47:04] and we recognize that we can go back
[47:07] throughout throughout the old testament
[47:08] and go through the new testament as you
[47:10] comb through it you can see that the i
[47:12] am that was there at the very beginning
[47:14] that would roll the very worlds off of
[47:16] his fingertips was the same i am that
[47:18] was there with elijah and he was there
[47:21] with elisha and he was there throughout
[47:23] his prophets moses and on down
[47:25] throughout the scriptures and we
[47:26] recognize that it is that same i am that
[47:29] is right here standing in the midst of
[47:31] the seven church ages and right here in
[47:33] the midst of the church of the living
[47:34] god there's there's somebody that is
[47:36] standing here and we recognize that that
[47:39] is the that is the great i am it's not a
[47:41] god that's changing it's not a god
[47:43] that's going it's not a god that's
[47:44] leaving us but he is the i am he is
[47:47] present for our situation he is present
[47:49] for our needs he is present for
[47:51] everything that we'll ever go through
[47:53] and i was i was listening to the prophet
[47:54] today when he was when he was talking
[47:56] there and it is the rising of the sun he
[47:58] said when when jesus christ came and he
[48:00] conquered he conquered everything that
[48:02] there was to be conquered he conquered
[48:04] sin he conquered he conquered sickness
[48:06] he said he said he went on and he
[48:08] conquered all of the trinity of satan he
[48:10] said there satan was the author of death
[48:12] he said but he was the possessor of hell
[48:14] and he was the possessor of gray of the
[48:16] grave and here we are recognizing
[48:18] tonight that that all of the trinity of
[48:20] satan everything that he possessed as
[48:23] his own that that was his own house that
[48:25] jesus christ rose up the mighty
[48:27] conqueror on the third day and he
[48:29] conquered death hell and the grave and
[48:31] we recognize tonight that that that
[48:33] satan himself don't even have the keys
[48:35] to his own kingdom tonight the things
[48:37] that once held man captive jesus christ
[48:40] holds in his hands tonight and to think
[48:43] that tonight that everything that's been
[48:44] stacked up against your life every every
[48:46] little detail that's been laid out in
[48:48] your dna everything jesus christ is the
[48:51] answer to everything that you'll ever
[48:53] have need of and to think that that it's
[48:55] all wrapped up inside of one man and
[48:57] that man's name is none other than jesus
[49:00] christ he conquered every enemy that you
[49:02] could ever come up against
[49:04] he conquered brother ron's cancer he
[49:06] conquered brother randy's cancer he
[49:08] conquered every need he conquered every
[49:10] battle that you can ever go through so
[49:12] so tonight the battle is already won
[49:14] we'd like to declare we'd already like
[49:16] to declare victory in this place tonight
[49:18] knowing that all of the things that held
[49:20] men for captive captive for so many
[49:22] years that one man jesus christ he
[49:25] proved that he conquered the trinity of
[49:28] satan that day at calvary and to think
[49:30] that where we're living at in the as a
[49:32] church of the living god that this
[49:34] message is such a reality it is this
[49:37] word is the only reality that there is
[49:39] lay odyssey it can't offer you a reality
[49:42] everything that they offer you the the
[49:44] hollywood
[49:46] it shines but this gospel is glowing
[49:48] with the realities of jesus christ and
[49:51] we realize that it is this word it is
[49:53] this message it is this power that'll
[49:56] take our mortal bodies and they'll
[49:57] change our mortal bodies and this
[49:59] mortality will put on immortality and
[50:01] this corruption will put on incorruption
[50:04] as paul would say in first corinthians
[50:06] 15 we recognize that this message is the
[50:09] greatest thing that's ever been placed
[50:11] in the hand of almighty god and i think
[50:13] tonight if we're ever going to preach
[50:15] liberty amongst the church of the living
[50:17] god we ought to be preaching right now
[50:19] and i believe if there's young people
[50:20] that need an experience with the liberty
[50:23] of this message it ought it ought to be
[50:25] preached like never before if we've got
[50:27] if we've got an older generation that
[50:28] need healing there's there's healing
[50:30] laying right here in this message and
[50:32] there's somebody here that needs needs a
[50:34] divine touch from almighty god needs
[50:37] answers need to be met i believe that it
[50:39] can be experienced right now in the
[50:41] power of this message
[50:44] this message ain't got weaker as the
[50:45] days gone by this message has got
[50:47] stronger and stronger and we're coming
[50:50] behind it with an amen if brother
[50:52] branham would say he said if there's a
[50:54] great big amen across the room let us
[50:56] say amen to it and if there ever was a
[50:59] time to believe for miracles it's right
[51:01] now when god has connoted himself he's
[51:05] emptied himself out into the church of
[51:07] the living god he's just changed his
[51:09] mass this is the bride coming of jesus
[51:12] christ this is christ in bright form
[51:15] what you see in your brother what you're
[51:16] seeing your sister this ain't some work
[51:19] this ain't some man's idea this ain't a
[51:21] school of ideology but this is the
[51:24] victory of jesus christ in body form
[51:27] again and you're not just fellowshipping
[51:29] with another man but you're
[51:31] fellowshipping with the same exact one
[51:33] that abraham was fellowshipping with he
[51:35] had a conversation with him that he was
[51:38] going to have a son and there on that
[51:40] day when he had his back turned towards
[51:42] the tent he started fellowshipping with
[51:44] the same one that had talked to him all
[51:47] throughout those years and it was that
[51:49] shame melchizedek
[51:50] that came by his way and changed his
[51:53] body i declare unto the church of the
[51:55] living god it's that same melchizedek
[51:58] that we're fellowshipping with right now
[52:01] and i'll declare unto you it'll be one
[52:03] of these mornings between the hours of
[52:05] six and nine that one that you've been
[52:07] fellowshipping with that one that you've
[52:09] been entertaining will change your
[52:11] mortal bodies you'll not go by the way
[52:13] of the grave but this mortality will put
[52:16] on immortality and in a moment in a
[52:19] twinkling of an eye we shall be changed
[52:24] glory
[52:26] hallelujah
[52:28] hallelujah the secret things belong unto
[52:30] the lord but the things which are
[52:32] revealed belong to us this is our
[52:35] possession this ain't this ain't
[52:37] luther's day this ain't wesley's day
[52:40] this is a bright age and if there ever
[52:42] was a time to believe it it's right now
[52:46] i want to tell you that our bags our
[52:48] script bags are full we've got stones
[52:51] that been rolled around in honey and
[52:53] we're just looking we're just looking
[52:55] for giants just now we're looking for
[52:57] cancer giants we're looking for coveted
[52:59] giants we're looking for depression
[53:01] giants we're looking for anxiety types
[53:04] we're looking for suicide giants because
[53:06] we've got a rock and it's a rock to a
[53:09] fence for a lot of people but this rock
[53:12] is a rock of revelation
[53:15] hallelujah
[53:17] hallelujah
[53:18] brother marlon would say in the statue
[53:20] of the perfect man he said christ never
[53:21] sent me to build no organization he
[53:24] didn't send me to build no he didn't
[53:25] sell me to build no intellectualism or
[53:27] denominationalism or to build another
[53:29] church he said he sent me here to build
[53:32] individuals and to be the stature of
[53:34] jesus christ that they might be a
[53:36] powerhouse
[53:37] they might be a powerhouse a dwelling
[53:40] place for almighty god the spirit by his
[53:42] word that he would come and live in a
[53:44] people and i think that tonight if we if
[53:47] we've ever grabbed a hold of a reality
[53:49] it's it's this message tonight
[53:51] you know when when you watch when the
[53:53] when the pride of jesus christ when that
[53:56] group that is catching the message of
[53:57] the hour and the reality of it you watch
[54:00] as the unbelievers the group begins to
[54:02] thin out just like when moses was up
[54:05] there and he sent out those 12 spies and
[54:07] those 12 spies went out there because it
[54:09] was the message of the hour for their
[54:11] day to go out there and to claim
[54:13] canaan's land the promise that was given
[54:15] unto abraham he was given unto them and
[54:18] he took that promise and there was only
[54:20] two of them that went out there and
[54:21] believed that that was the message of
[54:23] the hour and he watched as the group
[54:25] began to thin out when those so-called
[54:27] message believers or the majority of
[54:29] those so-called believers they didn't
[54:31] believe it but the message is today it's
[54:34] the promised word for this day that only
[54:37] the elect of god are going to be able to
[54:38] walk out there walk out of there in the
[54:40] face of all the criticism walk out there
[54:43] in the face of all the the darkness of
[54:45] this world and go out there and accept
[54:47] this message and believe this message
[54:50] i i declare that that pride is on earth
[54:53] right now i declare that it's she's here
[54:55] right now i've declared that she is him
[54:58] and i declare that all power in heaven
[55:00] and in earth that was given unto him is
[55:03] in the church of the living god i'm not
[55:05] i'm not i'm not ashamed of him i'm not
[55:07] ashamed of this power i'm not ashamed of
[55:09] this truth and if william branham could
[55:12] stand there right in the face of all of
[55:14] those critics right in the face of all
[55:16] those maniacs the same power that raised
[55:19] jesus christ from the grave is in the
[55:21] church of the living god it's something
[55:24] that you need to grab a hold of and let
[55:26] it be an experience for your own self
[55:29] if he could stand there he could stand
[55:31] there and he could call black black and
[55:33] white white how about the church of the
[55:35] living god how about we call out sin how
[55:38] about we call out what's right how about
[55:40] we believe for miracles
[55:44] there's people all over this building
[55:45] tonight that are in need of miracles and
[55:47] i tell you god ain't run out on them
[55:51] there's people that are sitting here
[55:52] tonight that need a true baptism of the
[55:55] holy ghost he ain't run out of it
[55:56] tonight there's people that are sitting
[55:58] here that need their eyes turned to from
[56:01] darkness unto life he ain't run out of
[56:03] his turning power
[56:06] i tell you still got his eye on you
[56:10] brother branham would say
[56:12] in the layout or excuse me in the
[56:13] ephesian church age he said that there
[56:16] he is
[56:17] with the seven stars in his right hand
[56:19] the right hand
[56:20] or or right hand or arm signifies the
[56:22] power and the authority of god psalms 44
[56:25] and 3 tells us for they got the land for
[56:28] they got not the land in possession
[56:31] by their own sword neither did their own
[56:33] arm save them
[56:34] but thy right hand
[56:36] and that arm in the light of thy
[56:37] countenance because thou hast
[56:39] favor unto them and i i think
[56:42] if there's ever was a time that a people
[56:43] had favor
[56:45] it's a church
[56:46] of the most high he said in that right
[56:48] hand of power our seven stars who
[56:51] according to revelations 1 and 20 are
[56:53] the seven church messengers he said that
[56:56] signifies that the very power
[56:58] and the authority of god are behind his
[57:00] messengers to every age he said they go
[57:02] forth in the fire and power of the holy
[57:05] ghost with the word
[57:07] and i don't know about you but that
[57:09] stirs my heart like never before to
[57:12] recognize that what was given to william
[57:14] branham but what was given to those
[57:16] seven church age messengers was that
[57:18] fire and the very unction of the holy
[57:21] ghost and it stirs our heart to
[57:23] recognize that we've got a short work to
[57:25] do here in lay odyssey and if we're ever
[57:28] going to run right now is the time to
[57:30] run if we're ever going to believe it
[57:32] young girls right now is the time to
[57:33] believe it if we're ever going to if
[57:35] we're ever going to put on and display
[57:37] the wedding garment if there ever was a
[57:39] time to to live this message
[57:42] it's right now it's not for a day gone
[57:45] by and it's not for in the future it's
[57:47] right now
[57:48] right now and to think that brother
[57:50] brother would say in the laodicean
[57:52] church age to think that there would
[57:54] come a time again that there is again
[57:57] another people in the land who under
[57:59] their messenger will be the final voice
[58:02] to the final h this bride has got
[58:04] something to say
[58:05] in revelations 10 it told us to prophesy
[58:09] again
[58:10] you're not coming up with your own words
[58:13] you're taking you're taking a message
[58:15] that's got power that's held by almighty
[58:17] god there ain't never been anything set
[58:20] out of place by this messenger there's
[58:22] never been anything that's been misdone
[58:24] outside of this messenger because he is
[58:27] in the right hand of almighty god
[58:30] he's there in the very power of god and
[58:32] to think that you're standing behind a
[58:34] vindicated prophet
[58:36] it's an amazing thing when you can sit
[58:38] there and listen to those tapes that's
[58:40] burning your heart when you're listening
[58:42] to and it and knoweth it not and you're
[58:44] sitting there to read likes flashing in
[58:46] this evil age and you think about the
[58:48] god of the seas voyage and satan's eat
[58:50] it and when god goes to choose out a

[59:19] kinds of chaos that entered into your
[59:21] life this week but setting right
[59:23] shoulder to shoulder with you tonight
[59:25] it's a church of the living god that's
[59:27] got a message that's that that's worth
[59:29] running with
[59:30] we've got the answer
[59:32] we've got the answer and the gates right
[59:34] in front of us and we know that if we'll
[59:36] get to that gate it will run with
[59:38] everything that's within us we've
[59:40] trained for this moment
[59:42] we've trained for this moment we we've
[59:44] done everything that we can to just get
[59:47] right for this moment and you've got the
[59:49] you've got the key in your hand the
[59:51] gates will open unto you
[59:57] hallelujah
[1:00:00] moving right here in this place tonight
[1:00:03] i just want i just want you to let your
[1:00:05] heart loose just for a moment but moving
[1:00:07] right here in this atmosphere tonight
[1:00:09] is a supernatural
[1:00:12] maybe you don't see with your natural
[1:00:14] eye but i believe that there is a heart
[1:00:17] of faith that is looking
[1:00:19] and catches those things and brings it
[1:00:20] down to them
[1:00:21] so right here in this atmosphere right
[1:00:24] here in this atmosphere is the love that
[1:00:26] you need right here in his atmosphere is
[1:00:28] a miracle that you need can you say amen
[1:00:30] right here in this atmosphere
[1:00:32] is everything that you have need of
[1:00:34] because jesus christ said that he would
[1:00:36] be with us now you say well i don't
[1:00:38] really understand all of that but i'll
[1:00:40] tell you that the whole armor of god is
[1:00:42] supernatural is that right so so we
[1:00:44] recognize that that william branham
[1:00:46] would come and he would he would lay it
[1:00:48] out before us that we were sitting here
[1:00:49] in two worlds and you can see when he
[1:00:52] would take a patient by the hand or he
[1:00:53] would begin to discern their heart from
[1:00:55] setting up here 25 yards away from the
[1:00:57] patient and he would sit there and he
[1:00:59] said now now you've seen that light in
[1:01:01] the papers and you've seen it in the
[1:01:02] pictures he said that same light is
[1:01:04] hanging between me and that woman and he
[1:01:06] said now he said now whatever you have
[1:01:08] need of he said he'll he'll make known
[1:01:10] unto you if you'll have just enough
[1:01:12] faith to believe it and you watch what
[1:01:14] that pillar of fire would do it would
[1:01:16] bring out the very secrets of the heart
[1:01:19] what was he doing he was showing that
[1:01:21] there was two worlds that that that
[1:01:23] angel was able to work there in that
[1:01:25] realm and he was able to call out things
[1:01:27] in their past and he was able to tell
[1:01:29] them things out there in their future
[1:01:31] you see when the vision would go forth
[1:01:33] you know brother branham he said he said
[1:01:35] when i seen that vision of that man over
[1:01:37] there in africa he said he said i could
[1:01:39] stand there he said i could stand there
[1:01:41] and he said i knew where i was standing
[1:01:42] at he said i could challenge all of
[1:01:44] those skeptics he said i could challenge
[1:01:46] all the religions of that world he said
[1:01:48] because i knew where i was standing at
[1:01:50] what i want to tell you tonight is you
[1:01:52] ought to know exactly where you're
[1:01:53] standing at it's because there's a
[1:01:55] prophet that stood in this day and he
[1:01:57] didn't say that you're barely going to
[1:01:59] make it and you're barely going to
[1:02:00] scrape by but there's a prophet that had
[1:02:02] a vision break over the church of the
[1:02:04] living god and she's going to make it
[1:02:06] with every fiber of her being she's not
[1:02:08] just going to kneel and make her way
[1:02:10] there she's going to come running
[1:02:12] through the gates there's going to be
[1:02:14] people that don't just live in defeat
[1:02:16] there's going to be people that live at
[1:02:19] the victory of almighty god
[1:02:25] you may not understand and you may not
[1:02:27] be on the same page as me right now but
[1:02:29] i want to tell you that before this
[1:02:31] night is over there's a god that's going
[1:02:33] to meet your needs you know they don't
[1:02:35] understand that but there was a lot of
[1:02:37] people in the message that were sitting
[1:02:39] there under the ministry of malachi 4
[1:02:41] and they walked in one way and they
[1:02:43] walked out another way it was because
[1:02:45] there was an angel that they'd been
[1:02:47] fellowshipping with that same angel is
[1:02:50] not dead he's alive right now
[1:03:00] i i don't went too high i ain't coming
[1:03:02] back down off this
[1:03:04] i i ain't coming back down i'm not gonna
[1:03:06] stoop down rare with him hawks and them
[1:03:08] chickens no more i don't flew up here in
[1:03:10] the eagle realm
[1:03:12] i don't flew up here where the anointing
[1:03:14] of the eagles out and i'm not going back
[1:03:15] down there to those earthbound chickens
[1:03:17] i'm not going back down to the
[1:03:19] denominationalism ideas that we've just
[1:03:22] confessed it and believe it and accept
[1:03:24] it and go on but i believe there's a
[1:03:25] power that's so strong that'll break
[1:03:28] every stronghold of the devil that's in
[1:03:30] this place tonight
[1:03:33] you ain't knocking me off this because
[1:03:35] it's been revealed to you it's been
[1:03:37] revealed to me i know exactly where i'm
[1:03:39] standing at i know where this church is
[1:03:41] and i know where she's supposed to be
[1:03:42] living at that's why i can preach to you
[1:03:45] under the anointing of malachi 4 and you
[1:03:47] have the ability to go up there and
[1:03:50] worship like never before there's a lot
[1:03:52] of people that don't understand your
[1:03:54] worship there's a lot of people that
[1:03:55] don't understand your praise but you
[1:03:57] have broke through the veil
[1:04:00] [Applause]
[1:04:01] brother vernon said if i taught you a
[1:04:03] method his message he said it wouldn't
[1:04:04] have no effect on you he said if i
[1:04:06] taught you a lutheran message he said it
[1:04:07] wouldn't have no effect on you he said
[1:04:09] because that ain't your message but this
[1:04:11] is your message he said you fail to see
[1:04:13] why the people are so enthused and why
[1:04:15] they're so elated he said they have
[1:04:17] broke through the veil they have broke
[1:04:19] through the veil and once you break
[1:04:20] through the veil there ain't no going
[1:04:22] back i'm gonna tell you what i've done
[1:04:24] come out of this thing and i don't seem
[1:04:26] that back there that life was destroying
[1:04:28] my life that life was tearing me apart
[1:04:31] but i broke through the veil and i've
[1:04:33] seen somebody that was stronger than me
[1:04:36] that was greater than me i got my eyes
[1:04:38] on somebody
[1:04:39] [Applause]
[1:04:43] this is him
[1:04:46] brother ma'am
[1:04:47] brother brown would tell a story he said
[1:04:49] he said i was sitting there and he said
[1:04:51] i believe it i believe he was watching
[1:04:52] it he was watching a documentary on
[1:04:55] on how that these
[1:04:56] the these scientists had went down into
[1:04:58] the midnight dark
[1:04:59] of that sea there he said he went down
[1:05:02] all the way down there he said it was
[1:05:03] complete midnight when they got down
[1:05:05] there and they turned their lights on
[1:05:07] and they had fish down there
[1:05:09] he said just ugly looking fish and you
[1:05:11] ever you go ever studying studying on
[1:05:14] those things it
[1:05:15] it'll scare you half to death you met
[1:05:16] one of them things
[1:05:17] you never get an ocean again
[1:05:20] but you look at you you start studying
[1:05:22] out those those those creatures that
[1:05:24] live so far below below that surface
[1:05:26] they don't need eyes because they can't
[1:05:28] see down there it's so dark they can't
[1:05:30] see don't you recognize that where we're
[1:05:32] living at it's so dark they're blind and
[1:05:34] they don't even know it but he would say
[1:05:37] he said they're there he said he said
[1:05:38] they're using another sense down there
[1:05:40] he said because there's no way that they
[1:05:42] could see down there he said so they're
[1:05:44] using that radar that they have to be
[1:05:46] able to find their source of food and he
[1:05:48] said you he said you take that little
[1:05:50] fish he said that little fish could
[1:05:52] never come up here to the top of the
[1:05:54] water he said because it's pressurized
[1:05:56] to live in the atmosphere where it's
[1:05:58] living at he said but if you would ever
[1:06:00] take that little fish he said if you
[1:06:02] ever take that little fish and he said
[1:06:04] you bring him up here and let him be me
[1:06:06] he said you let him be me let him have a
[1:06:09] human body and think like a human and do
[1:06:11] like a human he said that little fish
[1:06:13] you would never want to go back down
[1:06:14] there under that atmosphere and live
[1:06:17] like that little fishy in that darkness
[1:06:19] he said because he said he was
[1:06:21] pressurized to live there you see what
[1:06:23] brother branham broke into on the
[1:06:25] curtain beyond the curtain of time he
[1:06:27] broke into the sixth dimension he broke
[1:06:29] up there he broke up there and he said
[1:06:31] when he got there there was nothing but
[1:06:32] perfect love there and you remember what
[1:06:34] they were screaming out to him whatever
[1:06:36] you do press the battle press the battle
[1:06:38] he said i could never be the same
[1:06:40] william branham after that event now let
[1:06:43] me tell you something what you've been
[1:06:44] preached to you how could you ever go
[1:06:47] back to some denominational thinking
[1:06:49] some cold formal idea when you've been
[1:06:52] brought up to the message of the hour i
[1:06:54] can't think the same way i can't drink
[1:06:56] the same way i can't act the same way i
[1:06:59] can't talk the same way i've been
[1:07:01] brought to a level
[1:07:06] and i'll tell you it's a level
[1:07:08] where only the elect can live at
[1:07:14] now
[1:07:16] when i was when i was a kid
[1:07:18] i enjoyed the game of baseball i enjoyed
[1:07:20] it real good
[1:07:22] about the only thing i was ever good at
[1:07:24] in athletic room was a little bit of
[1:07:26] baseball
[1:07:28] i was too too small to play tackle
[1:07:31] football that guy
[1:07:33] so i i just shift sports
[1:07:36] but now some of you can maybe fellowship
[1:07:38] with me right here on this thought but
[1:07:39] when i was little i know brother jeffrey
[1:07:41] can and brother tj and these other jerry
[1:07:43] and davey and all these other brothers
[1:07:45] and don't act like a bunch of saints are
[1:07:46] sitting there tonight
[1:07:48] i know you can fellowship with me on it
[1:07:50] just for a minute
[1:07:51] but when we was when we was younger
[1:07:53] they'd have they'd have what they call
[1:07:54] an opening day you know what i'm talking
[1:07:56] about and they have that opening day and
[1:07:58] and they'd have everybody all the teams
[1:08:00] of the region or the district come out
[1:08:02] and they'd announce out their name and
[1:08:04] they'd come out and then they'd have a
[1:08:05] big event and all the games would be
[1:08:06] played all the games will be played on
[1:08:08] that one specific day it was a day that
[1:08:11] if you're a child and you really looked
[1:08:12] you really look forward to that day
[1:08:14] and i remember as i remember as a little
[1:08:17] boy
[1:08:17] i remember thinking about thinking about
[1:08:20] that day you got your brand new you got
[1:08:21] your brand new uniform on
[1:08:23] yeah and
[1:08:24] they didn't give you though they didn't
[1:08:25] give you those uniforms to practice in
[1:08:28] they give you those uniforms for opening
[1:08:29] day
[1:08:30] they give you they give you that uniform
[1:08:32] and they've got that they've got the
[1:08:33] audience there and and the whole the
[1:08:36] little bitty stadium that we would go
[1:08:37] down there in grotto's barely had enough
[1:08:39] barely had enough benches there for
[1:08:41] anybody the whole family sat there but
[1:08:42] if you were a fraser boy you're gonna
[1:08:44] have an attendance
[1:08:46] and and we look forward to we look
[1:08:48] forward to that as kids because
[1:08:50] what they were going to do they were
[1:08:51] going to announce they were going to
[1:08:52] announce your name across that audience
[1:08:54] across that across that atmosphere and
[1:08:56] they were going to scream out your name
[1:08:58] and holler out your position and they
[1:09:00] tell you where where you were playing at
[1:09:01] what team you were and i'll tell you as
[1:09:03] a little kid y'all know i was handful
[1:09:05] but as a little kid i always look
[1:09:07] forward to that day i always had it in
[1:09:08] my mind i'd run out there when they call
[1:09:10] my name i'd run out there and do a back
[1:09:12] flip and show off you know
[1:09:14] i never did that because i couldn't do a
[1:09:16] backflip
[1:09:18] but i i tell you
[1:09:20] as a little kid you think about that and
[1:09:22] they there you are man you are so elated
[1:09:24] because they've called out your name and
[1:09:26] there you are you're running out on your
[1:09:27] field and you they've called out your
[1:09:29] position here here comes andrew spencer
[1:09:31] the third the third baseman for for such
[1:09:34] and such team and you run out there and
[1:09:36] man your day your name's been called
[1:09:38] but let me let me i know maybe some of
[1:09:40] you can't fellowship with me on that
[1:09:41] fault but i know you can fellowship with
[1:09:43] me on this all there's been a prophet
[1:09:45] that stood up in this day and has
[1:09:47] announced your coming and he said that
[1:09:49] there would be a bride here that would
[1:09:50] be without spot and be without wrinkle
[1:09:52] and i want you to know we don't have to
[1:09:54] do no backflips in front of the audience
[1:09:56] but we can tear satan's kingdom down
[1:09:59] because you and i have been announced
[1:10:00] that we would be here and if william
[1:10:02] branham saw me and you here and every
[1:10:05] devil in hell knows that we're here the
[1:10:07] bride of jesus christ she's not sitting
[1:10:09] down but she is on her feet this ain't
[1:10:12] opening day but it's open season on
[1:10:14] every devil let's start hunting down
[1:10:17] some cancer devils let's start hunting
[1:10:19] down some depression devils i've got a
[1:10:22] load that i'm ready to shoot at every
[1:10:24] single one i run into
[1:10:27] the bride of jesus christ is here
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:33] hallelujah
[1:10:35] the elect will overcome this age
[1:10:37] you are the victory of jesus christ
[1:10:42] you recognize who you are
[1:10:44] you recognize who you are this word
[1:10:47] called you
[1:10:48] brother martin would say that that the
[1:10:49] first thief she failed he said but this
[1:10:51] bride cannot fail he said she's ordained
[1:10:54] not to fail she's predestinated not to
[1:10:56] fail and we realized that brother
[1:10:59] branham would come in the feast of
[1:11:00] trumpets and he would tell us that
[1:11:01] there's two groups and we realize that
[1:11:03] we are in the midst of spiritual warfare
[1:11:06] after the liberty of the saints of god
[1:11:09] you just stick around you just stick
[1:11:11] around long enough and you realize that
[1:11:13] your liberties that you have as an
[1:11:15] american citizen are being stolen from
[1:11:16] you left hand and right hand they're
[1:11:19] stealing away from you in the middle of
[1:11:21] your night and they're stealing away
[1:11:22] from you right in front of your eyes
[1:11:24] how much more did brother branham tell
[1:11:27] us that there he would break into the
[1:11:29] feast of trumpets and he would go in
[1:11:30] there and he pulled out matthew 24 and
[1:11:33] 24 that in the last days there would be
[1:11:35] false christs and false prophets that
[1:11:37] would come unamongst you and do signs
[1:11:39] and wonders that it would deceive the
[1:11:40] very elect if it was possible you
[1:11:42] remember what brother brandon broke in
[1:11:44] there in revelation chapter nine verse
[1:11:46] 16 i believe it was that he went in
[1:11:48] there and those two hundred thousand
[1:11:50] thousand demons he showed us he said
[1:11:52] those were supernatural charges
[1:11:54] supernatural horses and he said there
[1:11:56] they were in that ecclesiastical power
[1:11:58] and they were going out there to stomp
[1:12:00] out the church of the living god brother
[1:12:02] branham said well we recognize that when
[1:12:05] those seals were released all of those
[1:12:07] demons out of the river of euphrates was
[1:12:09] released at the same time so what you
[1:12:11] see is those demons are being released
[1:12:14] to attack the body of jesus christ and
[1:12:16] you think i i don't know if i'm going to
[1:12:18] make it or not you're going to make it
[1:12:22] i'm you're gonna make it if there's a
[1:12:23] devil that's trying to destroy your life
[1:12:25] that means that you've got something
[1:12:27] that he's never handled
[1:12:30] all hell is after this message
[1:12:32] every gun of hell is pointed towards you
[1:12:35] and he don't just want your message
[1:12:38] he wants your liberty
[1:12:44] if you could
[1:12:45] he'd sneak in here and take your worship
[1:12:48] if he could he'd sneak in here and take
[1:12:49] away your pastor he'd take away your
[1:12:51] health he'd take away your joy he'd take
[1:12:54] away your pride in jesus christ he take
[1:12:56] away everything that you are he'd take
[1:12:58] away he take away everything that you
[1:13:00] are as a believer but you remember what
[1:13:02] brother branham said there in the feast
[1:13:04] of trump as i hit on it just a little
[1:13:05] bit last weekend he said there he said
[1:13:08] they have bound the spirit of the living
[1:13:09] god at the door of creeds and dogmas he
[1:13:13] said but here it is again he said she's
[1:13:15] coming back to what the bible said and
[1:13:18] he said she's going to be liberated
[1:13:22] you think that the very first time
[1:13:24] throughout all the ages that christ has
[1:13:26] got a body that he can work through
[1:13:28] that he can manifest what he said in
[1:13:30] john 14 12 he can manifest what he said
[1:13:33] in john 5 and 7 that if you ask anything
[1:13:36] in my name if you abide in me and my
[1:13:38] words about and you ask what you will
[1:13:39] that there ever was a time that we could
[1:13:42] activate the faith of mark 11 22 god has
[1:13:46] finally got a body on earth that he can
[1:13:49] work through a body that he can operate
[1:13:51] through
[1:13:52] now now
[1:13:53] just to turn just for a moment
[1:13:55] it said that george washington when he
[1:13:57] was when he was in the battle that he
[1:13:59] was always outnumbered
[1:14:01] he was always outnumbered he was always
[1:14:03] under supplied and he retreated more
[1:14:05] times than he won
[1:14:07] he battled through winter when most when
[1:14:10] most generals when most generals would
[1:14:12] take that time and they'd go back and
[1:14:14] spend time with their family but george
[1:14:16] washington kept on the battlefield
[1:14:18] we realized that that the supernatural
[1:14:21] predicted it protected general george
[1:14:23] washington
[1:14:24] when they would fire musket bullets
[1:14:26] shoot through his shoot through his belt
[1:14:28] and shoot through his arm or shoot
[1:14:29] through his coat but realize that he
[1:14:32] went into the battle sometimes
[1:14:33] outnumbered seven to one
[1:14:37] brother branham he would preach up he
[1:14:39] would preach a powerful message on
[1:14:40] perseverance he called general
[1:14:42] washington's name
[1:14:44] that there he would walk across that
[1:14:45] snowy icy delaware he'd go across there
[1:14:48] just to win the battle he was
[1:14:50] perseverant when his men were out there
[1:14:52] didn't have shoes on their feet in the
[1:14:53] freezing cold he was perseverant
[1:14:56] if george washington could be
[1:14:58] perseverant in that type in that type of
[1:15:00] condition
[1:15:01] how much more should you be
[1:15:04] it said that george or general
[1:15:06] cornwallis he surrendered only
[1:15:09] because washington's army kept coming
[1:15:12] back no matter what the odds
[1:15:15] as one biographer put it general
[1:15:17] washington defeated the british and won
[1:15:19] america's liberty simply because he
[1:15:22] would not quit
[1:15:26] now you've heard your pastor stand here
[1:15:28] and say never
[1:15:30] never
[1:15:31] never never give up
[1:15:34] he's not just challenging your faith
[1:15:36] he's not just challenging your flesh but
[1:15:38] he's challenging your faith he's
[1:15:40] challenged you to step out into the
[1:15:41] unknown and to believe for the
[1:15:43] impossible
[1:15:48] i'll tell you if we can if men could do
[1:15:50] that in a natural
[1:15:51] how much more is the church of the
[1:15:52] living god how do you ought to be able
[1:15:54] to stand up on your own two feet and
[1:15:56] stand there and say this is my day this
[1:15:58] is my hour this is the greatest time
[1:16:00] that we've ever been living in if
[1:16:02] william branham would stay if i could
[1:16:03] have chose any day to live him i chose
[1:16:06] this day
[1:16:09] now let me let me just go back to our
[1:16:10] text just for a moment
[1:16:12] you remember
[1:16:14] when ruth
[1:16:15] when ruth was coming and she begins to
[1:16:17] make her entrance when she begins to
[1:16:19] make her entrance into bethlehem
[1:16:21] it was at the beginning
[1:16:24] of the barley harvest
[1:16:26] and when she goes out there in ruth one
[1:16:28] and she goes out there and she comes to
[1:16:30] bethlehem and she goes throughout the
[1:16:32] harvest and she goes throughout she goes
[1:16:34] throughout ruth deciding to ruth working
[1:16:37] and and to ruth resting and then to ruth
[1:16:39] rewarded but there was a process that
[1:16:41] ruth had to go through and when she went
[1:16:44] out there and she she went out there and
[1:16:46] she began to glean off of that field he
[1:16:48] was in the midst of harvest time
[1:16:50] and if god ever chose a time to send the
[1:16:53] bride of jesus christ
[1:16:55] to the darkest of day he chose to send
[1:16:57] her in harvest time
[1:17:00] and when ruth would go out there when
[1:17:02] ruth would come back and she'd be
[1:17:04] carrying in the bundles of the wheat
[1:17:06] that she'd brought in
[1:17:08] she said blet naomi spoke these words
[1:17:11] blessed is he that took knowledge of you
[1:17:14] that took knowledge of thee and she
[1:17:16] began the bible said that she began to
[1:17:18] ask who was this one that gave unto her
[1:17:22] that took knowledge of her and she said
[1:17:24] one by the name of boaz and i can
[1:17:27] imagine naomi having herself a jubilee
[1:17:30] right there when she looked out there in
[1:17:32] the field and she saw boaz there
[1:17:34] she said oh this is one of the near kins
[1:17:38] he is our kids men oh i tell you
[1:17:42] there's been one that's took knowledge
[1:17:44] of you in your worst of trials when you
[1:17:47] didn't feel like serving him when he
[1:17:49] didn't feel like praising him when you
[1:17:51] look like you were running out of money
[1:17:53] when it looked like there wasn't enough
[1:17:54] space for you there was somebody that
[1:17:57] took knowledge of you
[1:18:00] now the bible said in proverbs 3 9 honor
[1:18:02] the lord with thy substance and with the
[1:18:04] first fruits of all thine increase so
[1:18:07] shall thy barns be filled with plenty
[1:18:09] and thy presses thy presses shall burst
[1:18:12] out with new wine
[1:18:15] hallelujah
[1:18:16] hallelujah think about right now
[1:18:18] what you've been feeding on this ain't
[1:18:20] this ain't some old old religion it's
[1:18:23] new wine that you're feeding on
[1:18:26] we recognize we recognize i just want to
[1:18:28] i just want to draw your attention just
[1:18:30] for a few moments
[1:18:31] back to leviticus 23 and 10 that it said
[1:18:34] speak unto the children of israel and
[1:18:36] say unto them when you come under the
[1:18:38] land which i give unto you and shall
[1:18:40] reap the harvest thereof then you shall
[1:18:42] bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your
[1:18:45] harvest unto the priest and he shall
[1:18:47] wave the sheaf before the lord to be
[1:18:50] accepted for you on the morrow after the
[1:18:52] sabbath the priests shall wait
[1:18:55] so when they were brought unto the land
[1:18:57] that god had already give them the land
[1:18:59] that was their possession when they were
[1:19:01] brought there they were to go into that
[1:19:03] land they were to go in there and sow in
[1:19:05] that land of that of the harvest and go
[1:19:08] in there and to expect it to come forth
[1:19:11] god never sows anything unless he
[1:19:13] expects it to come forth
[1:19:15] is that right
[1:19:16] don't you be weary and you're well doing
[1:19:18] you'll reap if you don't faint but
[1:19:19] notice what they were supposed to do
[1:19:21] they would go there and they were to go
[1:19:23] in there and sow that seed in the land
[1:19:25] that god had already give them now i'm
[1:19:28] taking you into into your possession
[1:19:29] just for a moment go in there go in
[1:19:32] there and sow it and when it comes to
[1:19:34] the time of the harvest when you go in
[1:19:36] and you get the first fruits you take
[1:19:38] your first fruits it was the very first
[1:19:40] one that you planted that had came to
[1:19:42] maturity you take that first one and you
[1:19:45] take it before the high priest you take
[1:19:47] it in there you break it before the high
[1:19:49] priest and the high priest he would take
[1:19:51] it and it would be accepted unto him and
[1:19:54] there the high priest would take that
[1:19:56] wave offering or he'd take that sheath
[1:19:58] he'd take that sheath and he would wave
[1:20:00] it before the lord so that it would be
[1:20:02] accepted for you so he would wave it
[1:20:05] before he would wave it to the north
[1:20:07] he'd wave it to the south he'd wave it
[1:20:09] to the east and he waved it to the west
[1:20:11] and when he was doing that it was a sign
[1:20:14] or a memorial that this was the very
[1:20:16] first one that it ever came up
[1:20:18] this was the first one that had came to
[1:20:20] that had got ripened first and it was in
[1:20:23] anticipation that there was more that
[1:20:25] was coming
[1:20:28] i'm going to tell you what when jesus
[1:20:30] was standing there and he was preaching
[1:20:32] to his disciples in john chapter 12 and
[1:20:34] 23 he said to recognize that the hours
[1:20:37] come that the son of man should be
[1:20:39] glorified he said verily verily i say
[1:20:41] unto you except the corn of wheat fall
[1:20:44] into the ground and it died and abideth
[1:20:46] alone he said but if it die it'll bring
[1:20:48] forth much fruit
[1:20:50] you see you see if you don't plant it
[1:20:52] you ain't gonna get nothing out of it
[1:20:54] and if you don't plant your faith in
[1:20:56] jesus christ you'll never have a harvest
[1:20:58] of it
[1:21:00] you say well they say well you have
[1:21:01] people come to you said brother andrew i
[1:21:03] prayed i prayed or i've asked i've
[1:21:05] thought about it i've said these things
[1:21:07] it seems like i'm not getting anything
[1:21:08] out of it have you really planted it
[1:21:10] have you really have you really buried
[1:21:12] it have you really buried it
[1:21:15] have you really gave it to god have you
[1:21:17] really gave your all to god and here
[1:21:20] here he would that that priest would
[1:21:21] take it and he'd wave it before the lord
[1:21:24] he'd wave that first he'd wave that
[1:21:26] first one out there because he knew that
[1:21:28] it was a sign or a memorial that there
[1:21:30] was more coming you remember you
[1:21:33] remember when jacob and joseph and they
[1:21:35] come into that land of egypt and he gave
[1:21:37] them a commission brother adam said in
[1:21:39] the message the inside he said they knew
[1:21:42] jacob and joseph knew that there was no
[1:21:44] first fruits that was of the
[1:21:45] resurrection he said they wasn't coming
[1:21:47] out of egypt he said they was coming out
[1:21:49] of palestine he said he knew that he
[1:21:52] said so he said you take my bones you
[1:21:54] don't bury him down here
[1:21:57] he said if you bury my bones down here
[1:21:59] he said they'll stay right here he said
[1:22:01] but if you'll take my bones up there and
[1:22:03] you'll bury them up there in palestine
[1:22:05] there's coming a resurrection up there
[1:22:08] and i think when that quickening power
[1:22:10] had found the body that he could live
[1:22:12] him moses had a portion of it david had
[1:22:15] a portion of it but when it anchored in
[1:22:17] the womb of mary and it produced to
[1:22:19] jesus that same quickening power that
[1:22:22] was there in the very beginning that
[1:22:24] spoke in the beginning let there be
[1:22:26] light and there was light
[1:22:29] that same quickening power was now
[1:22:32] living and manifesting in the body of
[1:22:34] jesus christ
[1:22:35] and what was he what was he he was the
[1:22:38] first fruits of them that had slipped of
[1:22:41] those that had went down in faith living
[1:22:44] for jesus christ
[1:22:46] just like abraham was there just like
[1:22:48] isaac was there just like jacob was
[1:22:50] there there when jesus christ rose up
[1:22:53] not he didn't raise up but he would but
[1:22:55] when he rose up on the third day he
[1:22:57] didn't just go up alone he brought all
[1:22:59] those old testament saints with him
[1:23:04] you start studying out the message you
[1:23:05] start studying out the old testament and
[1:23:07] when job is out there and he's looking
[1:23:09] he's looking out there in the land he's
[1:23:11] looking out there and he sees the trees
[1:23:13] he sees them fall away and he sees them
[1:23:15] come back to life the very next season
[1:23:17] he watches the flowers how they pass
[1:23:19] away and he recognizes they can come
[1:23:21] back to life again but he had a question
[1:23:23] before god he said if a man die shall he
[1:23:26] live again
[1:23:27] i fell you know i found an amazing i
[1:23:30] find it amazing that william branham
[1:23:31] would he come here and he what'd he do
[1:23:33] as his first bible he'd watch nature
[1:23:37] he'd watch nature there job was looking
[1:23:39] at that nature he said i see this die
[1:23:40] and i see it come back to life again but
[1:23:42] if a man dies shall he live again and
[1:23:44] brother adam said one day he was out
[1:23:46] there fellowshipping on that thought if
[1:23:48] a man dies shall he live again he said
[1:23:50] then a vision broke forth a vision broke
[1:23:53] forth and he began to see the light and
[1:23:55] the lightnings roared the lightness
[1:23:56] flashed and the thunders roared and he
[1:23:58] said there he began to see that there
[1:24:00] was a man that was coming to bridge the
[1:24:03] gap that a man if he died would live
[1:24:05] again
[1:24:06] brother branham said that in in the
[1:24:08] message of god
[1:24:10] recognizing your day and its message he
[1:24:12] said job recognize what the resurrection
[1:24:14] was
[1:24:15] it was jesus
[1:24:17] it was the same jesus that was there
[1:24:19] that was working in those flowers and
[1:24:21] bringing them back to life again because
[1:24:23] he is the author and the finisher of our
[1:24:26] faith
[1:24:27] and i tell you tonight your faith ain't
[1:24:29] in vain if you're believing on the lord
[1:24:30] jesus christ your faith ain't in vain if
[1:24:32] you if you lost a loved one and it done
[1:24:35] went by the way of the grave
[1:24:36] he's gave you a promise
[1:24:39] that those that are dead in christ shall
[1:24:42] he raise first
[1:24:44] but we which are alive and remain shall
[1:24:46] be caught up to meet him in the
[1:24:48] twinkling of an eye
[1:24:52] paul would say in first corinthians 15
[1:24:54] he said but if in this life we have hope
[1:24:57] only we have hope in christ he said if
[1:24:59] in this life only we have hope in christ
[1:25:01] he said we are all of men most miserable
[1:25:04] he said but now is christ risen from the
[1:25:06] dead and became the first fruits of them
[1:25:08] that slept he said for since by man came
[1:25:11] death
[1:25:12] by man came also the resurrection of the
[1:25:14] dead he said for as
[1:25:16] for as in all for as in adam all die he
[1:25:19] said but even so in christ shall all be
[1:25:22] made alive he said but every man in his
[1:25:24] own order christ the first fruits
[1:25:27] afterwards they that are christ at his
[1:25:30] covenant
[1:25:31] and to think that tonight brother i
[1:25:32] heard brother branham say it today he
[1:25:34] said he said those disciples he said i
[1:25:36] hear people say i wish i could be back
[1:25:38] there with those disciples and that day
[1:25:40] gone by
[1:25:41] he said but you don't need to long for
[1:25:43] that day to live back there with the
[1:25:45] days of the disciples he said that same
[1:25:47] quickening power that was in those
[1:25:49] disciples he's in the church he's in you
[1:25:52] i don't think you ain't got a wish for
[1:25:54] days gone by but that same power that
[1:25:56] raised jesus christ from the dead is
[1:25:59] living right here
[1:26:03] i'll tell you it's gonna raise our
[1:26:05] mortal bodies
[1:26:07] about of this ground
[1:26:09] but to think
[1:26:10] that here jesus christ
[1:26:12] was the first one up
[1:26:15] it been a lot of people die
[1:26:17] buddha's got a great religion but it'll
[1:26:19] never get you out of the grief
[1:26:22] muhammad's got a great theology but it
[1:26:24] never gets you out of the grave
[1:26:26] there was a lot of men that told and had
[1:26:27] a lot of philosophy there was a lot of
[1:26:29] men that had said a lot of great things
[1:26:31] had a lot of had a lot of constructive
[1:26:33] criticism had a lot of things that would
[1:26:35] maybe pump you up but there's ever been
[1:26:37] one man that ever got up from the grave
[1:26:40] and he stood there and he said he said
[1:26:42] you destroy this body and i'll raise it
[1:26:44] up again he said i have power to raise
[1:26:47] it up you put it in a grave i raise it
[1:26:49] up he said you spent 46 years building
[1:26:52] this temple but in three days i'll raise
[1:26:54] it back up again there they were
[1:26:56] thinking of that temple but he was
[1:26:57] speaking of this temple but what was it
[1:27:00] when he got up on easter morning it was
[1:27:02] the first fruit that if i rise
[1:27:05] they'll rise
[1:27:09] hallelujah
[1:27:11] if i can do it they can do it and
[1:27:14] brother branham said that he was waved
[1:27:16] over the people up there on that day of
[1:27:18] pentecost
[1:27:20] hallelujah he was waved over those
[1:27:23] people up there they were up there
[1:27:24] praising god praising god for something
[1:27:27] that they had not had yet brother
[1:27:29] branham said they were up there waiting
[1:27:31] on pro on job's prophecy to come to pass
[1:27:34] and he said when they got it they knew
[1:27:35] they had it
[1:27:38] you might be sitting there saying well i
[1:27:39] don't really know i know that i'm here i
[1:27:41] know that i'm in the message i know i
[1:27:43] know i'm under a great ministry i know i
[1:27:45] know that we're here but you have not
[1:27:46] really recognized and you've not really
[1:27:48] experienced the power of jesus christ
[1:27:51] it's for you
[1:27:53] it's for you
[1:27:55] if you've not experienced the liberty
[1:27:56] that comes with this message you need to
[1:27:59] dive in one good time
[1:28:01] and i don't i don't believe that i don't
[1:28:02] believe has messaged people or message
[1:28:04] churches that we're trying to get people
[1:28:06] to ourselves but we're trying to get
[1:28:08] them to jesus christ there ain't no
[1:28:10] resurrection power in the name of
[1:28:12] william branham there ain't no
[1:28:13] resurrection power in the holy pope's
[1:28:16] name there ain't no resurrection power
[1:28:18] in homer fraser's name or tim pruitt's
[1:28:20] name or ron spencer's name but there is
[1:28:22] resurrection power in the name of the
[1:28:25] most high god his name it's not a weak
[1:28:28] name it's a strong name and his name is
[1:28:31] the only name where men should be saved
[1:28:34] but by the name of jesus christ there is
[1:28:37] coming a time when every knee shall bow
[1:28:40] every tongue shall confess
[1:28:43] and to think that same one that rose up
[1:28:46] on easter morning when he broke out of
[1:28:48] the grave
[1:28:50] brother branham said they only seen him
[1:28:52] he said but it was a whole gang of old
[1:28:54] testament saints with him he started
[1:28:56] rising up on through the ascent and
[1:28:59] david broke into it and said he led
[1:29:01] captivity captive
[1:29:03] he said psalms 24 he said lift up your
[1:29:06] heads all your gates and be lift up your
[1:29:08] everlasting doors and the king of glory
[1:29:11] shall come in who is that king of glory
[1:29:14] the lord strong and mighty the lord
[1:29:16] mighty in battle lift up your heads all
[1:29:19] your gates and even lift them up all you
[1:29:21] everlasting noise and the king of glory
[1:29:24] shall come in who is this king of glory
[1:29:27] the lord of hosts he is the king of
[1:29:30] glory shalom
[1:29:33] i can hear william branham say he said
[1:29:34] there was two angels up there in heaven
[1:29:36] he said they were up there strumming and
[1:29:38] playing their music and they came down
[1:29:40] they come down to heaven they come down
[1:29:42] the earth so fast they said why are your
[1:29:44] heart why are you so weary or why are
[1:29:46] you so distressed there he went and
[1:29:48] there he went rising up he said he
[1:29:50] passed the moon and the stars of fast he
[1:29:52] went by with the old testament saints
[1:29:54] and he said the angel pushed the button
[1:29:56] and the doors come flinging wide open
[1:29:59] and there the king of glory walked in
[1:30:02] and god said you sat down here you sit
[1:30:05] down here while i make the rest of your
[1:30:07] enemies that footstool
[1:30:10] you tell your enemy he ain't nothing but
[1:30:13] a footstool for jesus christ he's been
[1:30:15] attacking you all day been attacking you
[1:30:18] all week telling you you're not gonna
[1:30:19] make it he ain't nothing but a footstool
[1:30:21] for my god
[1:30:24] he says you won't overcome he says you
[1:30:26] won't have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:28] he says days of miracles has gone by but
[1:30:31] he don't know what he's talking about
[1:30:33] he's just a footstool
[1:30:36] it's just a footstool for our lord and
[1:30:39] this is the bride coming of jesus christ
[1:30:43] every if you ain't got your i believe
[1:30:45] it's timothy pruitt that tells us he
[1:30:47] said if you ain't got your foot on
[1:30:49] satan's neck you are out of your place
[1:30:51] satan is out of his place if he ain't
[1:30:53] under your feet
[1:30:57] i'll tell you it's a great place to have
[1:30:58] him he's underneath for your feet so
[1:31:00] that everything he looks up his seat is
[1:31:02] miss jesus christ
[1:31:05] if the head rolls up the body's got to
[1:31:07] get up too
[1:31:13] he said he was waved up
[1:31:14] waved over those people up there in
[1:31:16] pentecost he said they was up there at
[1:31:18] that pentecost he said they was waiting
[1:31:20] for that blessing to come
[1:31:23] you think
[1:31:24] there they were a bunch of cowards
[1:31:27] but when the waves he
[1:31:30] began to he waved over them
[1:31:35] because i live
[1:31:37] you live also
[1:31:39] and that same power was living on the
[1:31:41] inside of peter got so much on the
[1:31:43] inside of him that he preached the
[1:31:45] 15-minute sermon on the day of pentecost
[1:31:48] preached the 15-minute sermon up there
[1:31:50] on the day of pentecost and he told them
[1:31:52] and they they begin to be pricked in
[1:31:54] their hearts when they begin to make fun
[1:31:56] of him at the very beginning of his
[1:31:57] sermon they began to mock him and make
[1:31:59] fun of him but the end of his sermon
[1:32:01] they said men and brethren what shall we
[1:32:03] do and he told him repent and be
[1:32:04] baptized every one of you
[1:32:07] is that right
[1:32:09] and there peter when he was walking when
[1:32:12] he would walk people would have enough
[1:32:14] faith that if that same power that
[1:32:16] raised christ up was living on the
[1:32:18] inside of peter he said that brother
[1:32:20] adam would say or the scriptures tell us
[1:32:23] that those people had so much faith that
[1:32:25] if peter would walk down the street and
[1:32:27] his shadow would be cast out over top of
[1:32:30] those people that were sick and lame or
[1:32:32] in distress or those things that the
[1:32:34] very shadow of peter
[1:32:37] the very shadow of peter cross across to
[1:32:40] them and they'd be completely made whole
[1:32:42] that same power that was in peter has
[1:32:44] been restored to the church of the
[1:32:47] living god
[1:32:51] notice what william branham said
[1:32:55] he said and it is to be waved again
[1:32:59] in this last day
[1:33:01] according to luke 17 30 and the day of
[1:33:03] the sun and then in the sunday again in
[1:33:06] the day that the s-o-n of man will be
[1:33:09] revealed or waived over again the people
[1:33:11] in this day he said the very same one he
[1:33:14] said when you see those things you think
[1:33:16] he said when when you go to looking at
[1:33:18] it that it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't
[1:33:20] the day of the sabbath but it was the
[1:33:22] very first day and he said he said that
[1:33:25] sunday he said son he said they've made
[1:33:27] it into a roman name he said but this is
[1:33:30] the s-o-n day again
[1:33:32] this is when the sun has risen again he
[1:33:36] said that's why it is a rising of the
[1:33:39] sun it's a dual sunrise
[1:33:43] goodness and here we are we've got we've
[1:33:46] got malachi 4. and brother adam said
[1:33:48] that malachi 4 will be waved over the
[1:33:50] people and luke 17 30 that in the last
[1:33:53] days the son of man will be revealed in
[1:33:56] the last days he said it is to be waved
[1:33:58] over the people again and they're dead
[1:34:00] traditions a man is dead and the son of
[1:34:03] god is alive again with the baptism of
[1:34:05] the holy ghost of spirit right amongst
[1:34:08] them and given us life
[1:34:12] i tell you we're living an hour when
[1:34:14] it's so close that it would receive the
[1:34:15] very elect if it was possible brother
[1:34:17] burnham he said you could take two cars
[1:34:19] he said you could set them down the same
[1:34:21] assembly line send them down the same
[1:34:23] assembly line he said they could come
[1:34:25] down have the same color have the same
[1:34:27] engine have everything exactly right
[1:34:29] have the hubs right be all polished out
[1:34:31] exactly right coming off the same line
[1:34:33] both of them have gasoline he said but
[1:34:35] if one of man got the spark in it he
[1:34:37] said it'll show you
[1:34:39] he said unless it's got the spark in it
[1:34:42] he said it might that gasoline might as
[1:34:44] well be water
[1:34:45] you see you see pentecost can get so
[1:34:47] close but they've missed it
[1:34:50] they are missing the very fire power of
[1:34:52] the holy ghost
[1:34:58] i'll tell you
[1:34:59] i'll tell you it's an awesome day
[1:35:01] to recognize
[1:35:02] and william branham said there'll have
[1:35:04] to be another chief wave than that's the
[1:35:05] last day he said a waving of that sheep
[1:35:07] he said what was that sheath he was the
[1:35:09] very first one that came to maturity the
[1:35:11] first one that proved it was wheat that
[1:35:13] proved it was a sheath he said
[1:35:15] hallelujah he said i'm sure you see what
[1:35:16] i'm talking about he said it was waved
[1:35:18] over the people and the first time
[1:35:20] they'll ever come forth for the bride
[1:35:22] age for the resurrection out of the dark
[1:35:24] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:35:26] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:35:28] back again in its full power and being
[1:35:31] waved over the people by the same signs
[1:35:33] and the same wonders that he did back
[1:35:35] there
[1:35:36] and you think what's been waived over
[1:35:38] this generation and they're guilty for
[1:35:40] turning down the son of man again and
[1:35:42] you think about the one that was waved
[1:35:44] over this bride of jesus christ when you
[1:35:46] look at the ministry that was waved over
[1:35:48] no wonder no wonder that ministry could
[1:35:50] stand there when which doctors would be
[1:35:52] standing there in germany and they'd
[1:35:54] called for a storm to try to shut down
[1:35:57] the meeting out there he said they were
[1:35:58] standing out there chanting all those
[1:36:00] things but william branham said that he
[1:36:02] stood there and he just called for that
[1:36:04] storm to go back to its place where it
[1:36:06] came from and they sat there and had
[1:36:09] healing after healing miracle after
[1:36:11] miracle it's this wave sheath that's
[1:36:14] been waved over the bride of jesus
[1:36:16] christ
[1:36:17] if hattie right for that could ask for
[1:36:19] two boys how much more can you ask
[1:36:22] if william branham could stand there
[1:36:24] under the same anointing that's here
[1:36:26] right now
[1:36:28] and he could speak to that storm out
[1:36:29] there in colorado
[1:36:33] if he could speak to if he could speak
[1:36:34] to that tumor and sister media how much
[1:36:37] more could you and i take the same
[1:36:39] authority of the word that's been waived
[1:36:41] over this generation and we could call
[1:36:43] cancer to leave a body
[1:36:46] we could cause sickness to leave a body
[1:36:48] called suppression to leave our mind
[1:36:50] anxiety to leave our mind how much more
[1:36:53] if that same one's been waved over the
[1:36:55] church of the living god
[1:36:58] i'm preaching to you the most powerful
[1:37:00] thing that there is it's the message of
[1:37:02] the hour and this message that you've
[1:37:04] been given it don't have no restraints
[1:37:06] on it every restraint's been pulled off
[1:37:09] of it brother burnham said there's been
[1:37:10] churches churches bride's brides but
[1:37:13] there's got to come one that's both
[1:37:14] mechanics and dynamics
[1:37:17] she's here
[1:37:22] i tell you i believe i believe it so
[1:37:24] much that i believe that if you could
[1:37:26] say the right thing
[1:37:28] you could say the right thing when the
[1:37:29] one that's been waved over this
[1:37:31] generation you could say the right word
[1:37:33] and you watch your sons walk in this
[1:37:35] building i believe you could say the
[1:37:37] right word and you watch cancer leave i
[1:37:40] believe you could say the right word and
[1:37:41] they'd be a pouring out of the baptism
[1:37:43] of the holy ghost i believe you could be
[1:37:45] able to just say amen to the word of god
[1:37:48] and you watch the most mighty miracles
[1:37:50] that be done in this generation right
[1:37:53] here tonight
[1:38:03] how could he wave that
[1:38:05] before them
[1:38:06] and sent them out amongst a generation
[1:38:08] of wolves
[1:38:12] because it was his power
[1:38:14] it was his anointing it was his life
[1:38:17] it's his church
[1:38:19] and to think that where you are that's
[1:38:21] what's being waived over you
[1:38:25] this ain't another god
[1:38:27] it's the same god
[1:38:30] william branham could stand there and
[1:38:31] say
[1:38:32] i'd recognize there'd be a little
[1:38:34] resurrection to a little bitty fishy
[1:38:37] i see the resurrection coming he said
[1:38:39] there that little fish had been laying
[1:38:40] there
[1:38:42] all those hours
[1:38:46] and there comes something whirling out
[1:38:47] of that trees come whirling out of that
[1:38:49] mountain
[1:38:53] stand up
[1:38:55] and call for resurrection to come to
[1:38:56] that little fish
[1:38:58] another baron said i had all of those
[1:39:00] cases sitting out there in that
[1:39:01] wilderness
[1:39:02] sitting out there in the cities he said
[1:39:04] i had an epileptic sitting out there i
[1:39:06] had diseases sitting out there
[1:39:08] he said but god wanted to show that he
[1:39:10] was god over the little things as much
[1:39:13] as he was over god are the big things
[1:39:16] you're serving a god a variety and
[1:39:18] you're serving a god that has no limits
[1:39:20] on him
[1:39:22] and there's too many people that are
[1:39:23] trying to steal the very liberty
[1:39:26] of this message away from you and tell
[1:39:28] you that it's too late i tell you that
[1:39:30] days are going by i tell you it's just
[1:39:32] for preachers or it's just for this one
[1:39:35] or it's just for those that study 24
[1:39:37] hours a day what kind of nonsense is
[1:39:39] that
[1:39:41] what kind of nonsense is that
[1:39:43] if he could so come and feel what we
[1:39:46] would call the mary the mother of jesus
[1:39:48] christ if he would come and touch the
[1:39:50] mary magdalene if he would come and
[1:39:52] raise lazarus from the grave if he would
[1:39:54] come to the what we would seem
[1:39:56] insignificant people
[1:39:58] if he would come to a little lady that
[1:40:00] only made twenty dollars a year
[1:40:04] he knows where you're living at and he
[1:40:06] knows what you're going to ask
[1:40:09] don't you be afraid to ask big things of
[1:40:11] god ask that your joy might be full
[1:40:21] i want to take you down just a line just
[1:40:23] for a moment who was it that raised ron
[1:40:25] spencer out of a coma when you thought
[1:40:27] that you were getting ready to lose your
[1:40:29] pastor when you thought that you were
[1:40:31] getting ready to lose him to one of the
[1:40:32] greatest tragic accidents i've blown up
[1:40:35] in a fire
[1:40:36] who was that one that resurrected him
[1:40:38] from that life
[1:40:40] who was that one that walked in there
[1:40:42] who was that one that walked in there
[1:40:44] when doctors had given him up when
[1:40:46] doctors said he'd been brained in for 36
[1:40:48] hours
[1:40:51] i tell you the odds were stacked up
[1:40:52] against him i tell you it's the same one
[1:40:54] that abraham was fellowshipping with
[1:40:57] who was that one that called for doug's
[1:40:59] life doug hill's life to come back to
[1:41:01] him i tell you it's the same one that
[1:41:03] abraham was fellowshipping with
[1:41:06] who is that one that brought lord signs
[1:41:08] back into the church of the living god
[1:41:09] it's the same one that abraham was
[1:41:11] fellowshipping with
[1:41:13] who was the same one that brought
[1:41:15] stephen bowers and tara bars to the
[1:41:17] greatest message that's ever sounded out
[1:41:19] i'll tell you it's the same one that
[1:41:21] melchizedek that abraham was
[1:41:23] fellowshipping with
[1:41:25] who's going to be the one to get your
[1:41:27] boy out of trouble it'd be the same one
[1:41:29] you've been fellowshipping with
[1:41:32] who's going to set these young girls
[1:41:33] free it's the same one that we've been
[1:41:36] fellowshipping with who's going to take
[1:41:38] care of all of your problems who's going
[1:41:40] to drive cancer out who's going to drive
[1:41:42] sugar diabetes out who's going to do it
[1:41:45] it'll be the same one that william
[1:41:47] branham met up there in a cave
[1:41:50] it's this jesus christ
[1:42:00] if i can do it
[1:42:01] they can do it
[1:42:03] if i create it on the first day if i
[1:42:05] created all generations they can create
[1:42:08] they can call for life they can call
[1:42:14] if moses could stand there he could roll
[1:42:16] his shoulders back and he could call for
[1:42:18] fleas and he could call for flies call
[1:42:20] for frogs and call for hell
[1:42:23] setting out there under the blood of
[1:42:26] bulls and goats
[1:42:29] what are you doing crying
[1:42:32] what are you doing crying
[1:42:34] speak and go forward
[1:42:37] this message is the final voice of the
[1:42:39] final age
[1:42:42] it's time to sound off
[1:42:45] it's time to start coming into speaking
[1:42:47] conditions with him
[1:42:51] what he's deposited on the inside of you
[1:42:54] is for you
[1:42:59] luther wished
[1:43:01] he looked for a day like this day
[1:43:04] when you've got friends that are sitting
[1:43:06] out there
[1:43:07] and you know they're good christians
[1:43:10] you know they're good christians they're
[1:43:12] serving god in every way that they know
[1:43:14] how
[1:43:16] but they can never come up here to where
[1:43:17] you are
[1:43:23] and god will give them grace for where
[1:43:24] they're living at
[1:43:27] and you decide i'm just going to put
[1:43:28] this over on the shelf
[1:43:31] and i'm going to listen i'm just going
[1:43:32] to listen i'm going to stay at my house
[1:43:34] and i'm going to listen to tapes and i
[1:43:35] decide i'm not going to church no more
[1:43:39] you'll be guilty for turning down the
[1:43:41] one that's been waived over you
[1:43:46] this ain't the time to put this message
[1:43:47] on the shelf
[1:43:48] it's a time to bring it out
[1:43:50] live it out breathe it out
[1:43:53] speak it out
[1:43:54] i got family members that i know it's
[1:43:57] way too impossible for them to get in
[1:43:58] this building by bystanders but by his
[1:44:01] standards
[1:44:04] you know what i'm talking about sister
[1:44:05] francis you know what i'm talking about
[1:44:07] by my standards or by your standards or
[1:44:09] by our ideas it's way too hard for them
[1:44:12] to work through the message they got to
[1:44:13] get to to get here but if god got you
[1:44:16] here
[1:44:17] brother joel if god got you here he'll
[1:44:20] take care of your house problems he'll
[1:44:22] take care of your situations he's that
[1:44:24] kind of god that he cares about the
[1:44:26] small things and he cares about the big
[1:44:28] things
[1:44:29] [Applause]
[1:44:31] i'll tell you
[1:44:33] they they might look like you the hust
[1:44:35] might look like the wheat but it ain't
[1:44:36] got the reals they ain't got the real
[1:44:38] life there and i'll tell you this what's
[1:44:40] been rolled off the assembly line is
