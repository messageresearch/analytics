[59:26] gathered with you and
[59:28] hear the wonderful things that we've
[59:29] heard so far
[59:31] brother tim brother timothy done
[59:32] outstanding haven't they
[59:35] certainly have enjoyed it
[59:45] appreciate brother ron and the home
[59:47] church
[59:48] all the effort that's been put forth to
[59:50] make this meeting a success
[59:54] let's turn to the book of ephesians if
[59:55] you would today chapter three
[1:00:04] ephesians chapter 3
[1:00:08] verse 9.
[1:00:12] and to make all men see what is the
[1:00:14] fellowship of the mystery which
[1:00:16] from the beginning of the world has been
[1:00:18] hid in god
[1:00:20] who created all things by jesus christ
[1:00:23] to the intent that now unto the
[1:00:25] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:00:27] places
[1:00:29] might be known
[1:00:30] by the church
[1:00:33] by the church
[1:00:35] the manifold wisdom of god
[1:00:38] the word manifold means
[1:00:40] variegated so it's like different colors
[1:00:44] and different varieties
[1:00:46] of the wisdom of god
[1:00:48] it's overwhelming really that god would
[1:00:50] choose the church
[1:00:51] to manifest such great
[1:00:53] things
[1:00:54] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:00:56] he purposed in christ jesus
[1:00:58] our lord
[1:00:59] in whom we have boldness and access with
[1:01:02] confidence
[1:01:03] by the faith
[1:01:05] of him notice paul doesn't say faith in
[1:01:08] him
[1:01:09] but actually by his faith
[1:01:11] this is the way we live this is the way
[1:01:13] we rapture
[1:01:15] wherefore i desire that you faint not
[1:01:18] at my tribulations for you
[1:01:20] which is
[1:01:21] your glory
[1:01:23] i'd also like to read to you from
[1:01:26] a quote that brother branham
[1:01:28] made in a sermon entitled very strange
[1:01:31] title but dr
[1:01:33] moses
[1:01:34] you know when i begin to believe
[1:01:36] christian friend that we're just living
[1:01:38] in the beginning
[1:01:40] of the greatest thing the world has ever
[1:01:44] witnessed
[1:01:46] that of all the lines are getting
[1:01:49] unclogged
[1:01:51] you know clogged up with all kinds of
[1:01:54] doctrines and theologies and all kinds
[1:01:57] of stuff
[1:01:58] we all know about stuff don't we
[1:02:01] and unbelief it's been handed down from
[1:02:04] generation to generation
[1:02:06] oh there's no such a thing as healing
[1:02:08] the days of miracles is past and he says
[1:02:12] we just automatically
[1:02:14] believe that
[1:02:15] may the lord bless his words you may be
[1:02:17] seated
[1:02:20] i'd like to speak to you just a little
[1:02:21] bit today on
[1:02:23] unclogging
[1:02:24] the lines
[1:02:29] i would imagine most of us have had our
[1:02:31] lines clogged up before as far as
[1:02:34] plumbing and
[1:02:35] all different types of things and it's
[1:02:37] not fun is it right you go to take a
[1:02:40] shower you go to wash your hands or
[1:02:43] whatever and the sink is all stopped up
[1:02:45] and
[1:02:46] you uh
[1:02:47] you have to call a plumber
[1:02:49] um
[1:02:50] i tell my wife and my family that i wish
[1:02:54] i would have been a plumber instead of a
[1:02:56] preacher
[1:02:59] until i'm doing plumbing work
[1:03:05] that's us right that's the way we are
[1:03:07] we're never satisfied
[1:03:09] uh carol asked me this morning she said
[1:03:11] you wish i was a plumber i said yeah
[1:03:12] until i do plummet
[1:03:15] me and plumbing don't get along i always
[1:03:17] have all types of leaks
[1:03:19] but we know naturally how that is for us
[1:03:23] and so many things get in our way
[1:03:26] to hinder our faith
[1:03:28] initially man was not made for such as a
[1:03:31] matter of fact let me uh kind of share
[1:03:33] this with you in the fundamental
[1:03:34] foundation for faith man was made as a
[1:03:37] secondary god on earth he was given
[1:03:41] power to control
[1:03:43] all things all elements of the earth
[1:03:46] that was adam adam was given these great
[1:03:49] powers but then the power
[1:03:52] that he was given to make himself is
[1:03:54] where he fell
[1:03:55] adam could speak to the winds and they
[1:03:58] would stop he could speak to the trees
[1:04:01] and they would obey him he could speak
[1:04:04] to wildlife to the waters whatever it
[1:04:06] was everything obeyed adam now in the
[1:04:10] beginning he said man what god gave him
[1:04:12] power over was everything on the earth
[1:04:15] now
[1:04:16] through the fall
[1:04:18] he lost that power
[1:04:20] then he becomes unconscious
[1:04:23] of the fact now listen unconscious
[1:04:27] of the fact not the rumor but
[1:04:30] unconscious of the fact
[1:04:33] and he says after losing his
[1:04:34] relationship and friendship fellowship
[1:04:36] with the father when he lost that all of
[1:04:39] the great channels become clogged up
[1:04:42] and he couldn't get through
[1:04:45] now here we set today and i'm sure
[1:04:46] probably most of us are christians and
[1:04:49] hopefully most of you have the baptism
[1:04:51] of the holy ghost and yet still we're
[1:04:54] more than likely dealing with uh
[1:04:56] plumbing problems
[1:04:58] plumbing problems in our spirit plumbing
[1:05:00] problems in our mind
[1:05:02] plumbing problems and our thoughts and
[1:05:05] hopefully none of you have it in your
[1:05:06] soul but if you do this is a great place
[1:05:08] to be delivered of it today
[1:05:10] and we know how that even in our bodies
[1:05:13] how that our hearts and from the foods
[1:05:16] and things that we are eating uh many of
[1:05:18] us have of arteries and valves and so on
[1:05:21] inside of our hearts and they become all
[1:05:23] clogged up is that right
[1:05:25] and we need stents and we need this and
[1:05:28] that what's that for well it's to open
[1:05:30] up what god made in the beginning that
[1:05:32] was not to be clogged but by all the
[1:05:34] hybrid food and stuff that we're eating
[1:05:37] it's clogging us up and what does it
[1:05:39] cause heart attacks heart failure all
[1:05:42] types of things like that well if it
[1:05:45] does that in the natural realm i'm sure
[1:05:47] you agree that it also does it in the
[1:05:49] spiritual realm
[1:05:51] this is why that the spirit of god
[1:05:53] moving in among the message people is so
[1:05:56] foreign to some and it's because of
[1:05:59] doctrines and theologies and to be
[1:06:01] honest with you some preachers that
[1:06:03] preach psychology instead of preaching
[1:06:05] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:07] and then it begins to clog up people's
[1:06:09] arteries of their face
[1:06:11] and then if they feel a little bit of
[1:06:13] the presence of god it's like they feel
[1:06:15] bad because one of the worst names you
[1:06:18] can be called in this message is a
[1:06:20] pentecostal
[1:06:22] oh my that's one of the worst things you
[1:06:25] can be called as a pentecostal i don't
[1:06:27] mind it i've been called that ever since
[1:06:29] i've been in the message
[1:06:31] but you know they think they're calling
[1:06:33] me a 1906 pentecostal but that ain't
[1:06:36] what i am i'm an original pentecostal
[1:06:40] that's right
[1:06:43] that's what i am
[1:06:45] i'm not ashamed of it i i don't hang my
[1:06:47] head with it no i'm proud to be
[1:06:50] identified as an acts 2 38 holy ghost
[1:06:53] phil son of god baptized in jesus name
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:59] why that's the church he's coming for
[1:07:03] now what you notice brother rem says
[1:07:05] adam never had to be sick he never had
[1:07:07] to die he never had to worry can you
[1:07:09] imagine that
[1:07:11] never having to worry
[1:07:13] never having a pain a sorrow a sadness
[1:07:16] or a sickness and adam didn't just
[1:07:18] forfeit that for himself he forfeited
[1:07:20] that for me and for you
[1:07:23] he said he never had a heart ache never
[1:07:25] had a fear he just climbed up in the
[1:07:27] arms of father like a child
[1:07:30] everything was his and whatever he asked
[1:07:32] for he got it
[1:07:34] everything obeyed him because he was
[1:07:37] god's child and the child is the heir of
[1:07:40] all things now when man fell he lost
[1:07:43] this and when he lost in the fall christ
[1:07:46] come as our redeemer to redeem us back
[1:07:49] to everything that man lost
[1:07:53] now either we believe that or we don't
[1:07:56] and either we want to put it away out
[1:07:58] yonder in the millennium we don't need
[1:08:00] no divine healing in the millennium
[1:08:02] we don't need no miracles in the
[1:08:04] millennium i'll tell you when we need
[1:08:07] them right now
[1:08:08] we need them today
[1:08:10] we need deliverance we need the baptism
[1:08:13] of the holy ghost we need our plumbing
[1:08:16] all unclogged by the power of god not in
[1:08:19] the millennium
[1:08:21] but today
[1:08:24] oh my notice he said did you ever stop
[1:08:26] to think of what christ redeemed for us
[1:08:29] he gave us everlasting life but he
[1:08:31] brought us right back to the eternal
[1:08:33] fellowship with god but what is it then
[1:08:36] that happens to us even after we're born
[1:08:39] again and you know there's an element of
[1:08:41] us as mad as we hate to say it that is
[1:08:43] left unregenerate and that is our
[1:08:45] outside man once you notice how brother
[1:08:47] graham deals with this he said the thing
[1:08:49] of it is since man has been restored
[1:08:51] back to this place man in the fall lost
[1:08:54] his conscience
[1:08:56] of what father put him on the earth to
[1:08:59] do in other words he says all of the
[1:09:02] plumbing listen all of the plumbing
[1:09:06] as it was in our brain
[1:09:09] and the outlets our faith has been
[1:09:12] clogged up
[1:09:15] we might need some drano this morning
[1:09:21] y'all keep drano at home well i do you
[1:09:23] know our our sisters they have long hair
[1:09:27] and us brothers pay the penalty for that
[1:09:30] it's in our handkerchiefs you ought to
[1:09:32] be a preacher and get up and wipe your
[1:09:34] face
[1:09:35] and one of your wife's long hairs hangs
[1:09:38] here in your nose
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:42] yeah or or worse than that you ought to
[1:09:44] be a preacher and put your socks on and
[1:09:46] you don't realize it till you get up in
[1:09:48] the pulpit you got one of your wife's
[1:09:49] hairs between your toes
[1:09:52] now that's really aggravating
[1:09:56] that's right but not only that but our
[1:09:59] showers and things like that so i i keep
[1:10:01] drano at home because we have to have it
[1:10:04] you all understand what i'm talking
[1:10:05] about well i believe that god has given
[1:10:08] us some spiritual drain though
[1:10:11] you know the problem is we've had so
[1:10:12] many decades of theologians around the
[1:10:15] message that haven't had the holy ghost
[1:10:18] oh lord i think it's pretty evident some
[1:10:20] of the message preachers have not been
[1:10:22] born again
[1:10:24] how in the world can any man fill with
[1:10:27] the holy ghost not one his sons and
[1:10:29] daughters dancing in the power of god
[1:10:32] it's more than i can comprehend
[1:10:35] why in the world wouldn't any pastor
[1:10:38] want the people of god filled with the
[1:10:40] holy ghost oh hallelujah preaching the
[1:10:43] word of god a living resurrected lord
[1:10:47] jesus
[1:10:49] not a theology not a doctrine but a
[1:10:53] resurrected savior
[1:10:56] hallelujah
[1:10:59] it was not a doctrine that died for us
[1:11:03] it was not a doctrine that raised from
[1:11:05] the dead
[1:11:07] it is not a doctrine that we're looking
[1:11:09] for it is a person
[1:11:13] and that person is right here this
[1:11:15] morning
[1:11:16] to heal and deliver and set us free and
[1:11:21] unclog the plumbing in our brains our
[1:11:25] hearts
[1:11:26] are spirits
[1:11:27] [Applause]
[1:11:33] but i want you to listen to what brother
[1:11:35] branham says it can be clogged up
[1:11:38] with he says our brain and the outlets
[1:11:41] our faith has been clogged up
[1:11:44] with business affair
[1:11:47] home life
[1:11:49] domestic things wow
[1:11:52] they never mentioned movies they never
[1:11:53] mentioned gambling they never mentioned
[1:11:55] all that and we know that thing can
[1:11:57] happen too yes but i want you to notice
[1:11:59] how simple that sometimes for the lives
[1:12:02] of christians that they can get clogged
[1:12:04] up just normal everyday stuff
[1:12:08] so most of us i mean if you've got a
[1:12:10] smartphone it's a shame that smartphone
[1:12:12] is smarter than some of the people who
[1:12:14] own them but i'll tell you one thing if
[1:12:15] i couldn't then have enough holy ghost
[1:12:17] to control that thing from staying off
[1:12:19] of some of these internet websites which
[1:12:21] is ordained of hell
[1:12:23] i'd get me a dumb phone
[1:12:25] i just get me a dumb phone and all that
[1:12:27] done was made phone calls forget the
[1:12:30] internet i'd rather have the holy ghost
[1:12:32] than to have a smartphone if i ain't got
[1:12:33] enough victory to control it
[1:12:36] praise the lord
[1:12:40] and what does it do a little bit of
[1:12:42] domestic life and a little bit of this
[1:12:44] and a little bit of that and each one
[1:12:46] contributes to a little bit more of our
[1:12:49] plumbing getting clogged up
[1:12:53] and before long we wind up with so tiny
[1:12:58] and we go to a meeting like this
[1:13:00] and we're scared t totally to death
[1:13:04] i can't hardly wait to hear what some of
[1:13:07] the preachers are going to say about
[1:13:08] this meeting
[1:13:10] dear jesus and here i am my face is
[1:13:12] identified with it
[1:13:17] now y'all are witnesses i wasn't the one
[1:13:18] who'd been preached thoughts and stuff
[1:13:20] simply guys
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:26] i wonder how many of us today
[1:13:30] if the holy ghost
[1:13:33] did a scan on us
[1:13:37] how much of our faith our love our
[1:13:39] forgiveness
[1:13:41] our godliness our kindness
[1:13:44] what he finds so clocked up
[1:13:51] i want the holy ghost to scan me today
[1:13:55] don't you
[1:13:57] just let him scan my avenues of faith
[1:13:59] and virtue and forgiveness and kindness
[1:14:03] just let him do a scan on every one of
[1:14:05] us how many agree to that so he can look
[1:14:08] at us and see is there anything about me
[1:14:10] lord that that displeases you so the
[1:14:13] plumbing in my and my forgiveness can be
[1:14:16] opened up and the plumbing in my
[1:14:18] understanding and my revelation and all
[1:14:21] of that
[1:14:22] notice the prophet said it's all become
[1:14:24] so clogged
[1:14:26] that god can't operate through those
[1:14:29] channels
[1:14:30] that he made us for
[1:14:32] if god designed a man's body and
[1:14:35] certainly the body of his son the church
[1:14:37] he's designed us to come together in
[1:14:39] heavenly places in christ jesus and have
[1:14:42] these supernatural workings of god
[1:14:46] outlets through gifts of the spirit such
[1:14:48] as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and
[1:14:51] gifts of healing wow
[1:14:54] brother brandon believed in that
[1:14:57] brother brown believed in that
[1:14:59] you see it's not brother branham that's
[1:15:01] hebrews 13 8.
[1:15:04] it's jesus christ
[1:15:06] or brother random was here brother
[1:15:07] branham of sharon no brother adam it's
[1:15:09] not hebrews 3 8 i'm not and you're not
[1:15:11] jesus christ is hebrews 13 8 he is the
[1:15:15] same yesterday today
[1:15:18] and forever
[1:15:19] notice he said all these other different
[1:15:21] gifts as outlets that god led his power
[1:15:23] through and lets out his revelation to
[1:15:26] his people not as an individual so much
[1:15:28] he says but as a unit together as one
[1:15:31] body but satan by the laws of sin and
[1:15:35] deaths
[1:15:36] makes everything that sin and death
[1:15:40] brawl
[1:15:41] operate satan sins a cancer
[1:15:45] then man recognizes it
[1:15:48] and receives it
[1:15:50] satan sends heartaches
[1:15:52] we recognize it
[1:15:54] and receive it now satan has this this
[1:15:58] realm and he has these abilities to
[1:16:00] transmit and we know that these diseases
[1:16:03] all begin in the fourth dimension god
[1:16:06] created seven dimensions in the
[1:16:07] beginning knowing that man would need
[1:16:09] them light matter time science where the
[1:16:11] unbeliever goes where the believer goes
[1:16:12] and where god is the fourth dimension is
[1:16:14] the realm the prophets see their visions
[1:16:17] uh diseases all diseases begin in the
[1:16:20] realm of fourth dimension this is why
[1:16:22] the prophet will be able to see by
[1:16:23] vision and peer into that and hear those
[1:16:26] demons screaming one to another and he
[1:16:29] would be able to see him in the fourth
[1:16:31] dimension and science has never yet been
[1:16:33] able to break into it so they're able to
[1:16:35] scan us and do x-rays and all that and
[1:16:37] they say yeah there's this and there's
[1:16:39] that but they don't have a machine that
[1:16:41] can be able to peer into the fourth
[1:16:43] dimension god didn't have a machine but
[1:16:46] he had a prophet so a prophet was able
[1:16:49] to look into that fourth dimension and
[1:16:51] say i see this and i see that there's no
[1:16:53] telling what he could have told mayo if
[1:16:56] they would have just asked him no
[1:16:57] telling what he could have told the
[1:16:58] medical centers down in houston and all
[1:17:00] these great places of course they
[1:17:02] wouldn't but one day they will declare
[1:17:04] themselves and science is already
[1:17:06] finding it out more and more that they
[1:17:08] go with their skins they're just they're
[1:17:11] several decades behind but god already
[1:17:13] showed his prophet things that was in
[1:17:15] there and he said that those cancers
[1:17:17] would actually come from a bruised cell
[1:17:20] or a cell that had backslid my
[1:17:23] sister-in-law several years ago had
[1:17:25] cancer and the doctor told her that it
[1:17:28] actually come from a cell inside of her
[1:17:31] body and it didn't use the word
[1:17:32] backstage but it was more of a medical
[1:17:34] term i thought yeah exactly what the
[1:17:36] prophet said way back in the 50s so god
[1:17:40] opened that realm by which we could peer
[1:17:43] into for the first time in centuries and
[1:17:45] centuries we had a window to the
[1:17:48] supernatural so god then takes the seer
[1:17:51] and he opens that realm and he would be
[1:17:53] able to hear things and see things most
[1:17:56] of us aren't able to live in that realm
[1:17:58] you imagine the prophet said when he
[1:17:59] cast demons out of people that he would
[1:18:02] go back to the hotel room that night and
[1:18:04] them demons would come in there and they
[1:18:06] would rub their flesh against his he
[1:18:09] would hear chains rattling all night
[1:18:12] long i'm not made to take that that'd
[1:18:14] scare the liver out of me
[1:18:16] oh you might as well be honest you're
[1:18:17] not made to take it either but god gave
[1:18:20] us a man that was able to peer into that
[1:18:23] dimension and we don't have to be afraid
[1:18:25] of it because remember greater is he
[1:18:27] that is in us that he that is in the
[1:18:30] world but what did he do god brought a
[1:18:33] restoration to open up and help us to
[1:18:36] see that the supernatural is here we can
[1:18:38] sense it here already this morning
[1:18:40] that's what we've been sensing during
[1:18:42] these services i'm convinced the angels
[1:18:45] of god have been walking up and down
[1:18:47] these aisles they've been hanging right
[1:18:49] here oh glory to god and they're still
[1:18:52] here today they've not gone anywhere
[1:18:54] they're still here
[1:18:56] but how can we sense that because the
[1:18:58] plumbing of our faith has been opened up
[1:19:01] why don't other people believe in it
[1:19:03] they're so clogged up the supernatural
[1:19:06] cannot flow through them or you're
[1:19:08] blessed today friend you're blessed to
[1:19:10] believe that jesus is still the same he
[1:19:13] still heals the sick oh brother donald
[1:19:15] we don't need healing speak for yourself
[1:19:18] my daughter's sitting today and then
[1:19:21] hurting and liver the doctor saying that
[1:19:24] she has an incurable as far as what the
[1:19:26] doctors say a situation in her liver and
[1:19:29] they treat her and then they beat it
[1:19:31] down and then it raises back up again
[1:19:33] and they treat it and beat it down oh
[1:19:35] they don't need miracles my darling
[1:19:37] daughter needs a miracle
[1:19:40] brother ron spencer needs a miracle no
[1:19:42] doubt many of you and you know what our
[1:19:45] plumbing has been opened up to believe
[1:19:48] that our god is a miracle working god
[1:19:52] amen
[1:19:54] we want every avenue of our faith and
[1:19:57] our understanding to be so open that we
[1:20:01] believe god can do anything
[1:20:04] because our god cannot lie
[1:20:16] he says the only thing that hindered the
[1:20:18] human race today
[1:20:20] from being superior
[1:20:23] and controlling like they did in the
[1:20:25] beginning
[1:20:26] is because the power lines of the outlet
[1:20:29] of god
[1:20:31] and the human being
[1:20:33] has been clogged up
[1:20:37] and what makes it so difficult is
[1:20:40] in our ranks
[1:20:41] that we have preachers
[1:20:44] that are helping clogging
[1:20:48] as if every preacher was all in the
[1:20:50] unclogging business
[1:20:54] would have more of this stuff going on
[1:20:57] i hope you understand and see the
[1:20:59] setting where we're at
[1:21:01] our message
[1:21:02] is being divided
[1:21:05] satan has used division for years he
[1:21:07] divided us with the thunders he divided
[1:21:09] us with praerica he divided us with this
[1:21:11] and he divided us with that to me one of
[1:21:14] the last divisions that he's going to
[1:21:15] try to make is divide us from the power
[1:21:18] of god
[1:21:19] because he knows without that there will
[1:21:22] be no rapture
[1:21:23] there will be no body change if god
[1:21:26] can't heal me how can i trust him to
[1:21:28] change me
[1:21:30] you understand every time you get a
[1:21:32] divine healing from god you got a
[1:21:34] potential body change right then
[1:21:37] that's why satan don't want us to
[1:21:39] believe in the power of god
[1:21:41] he don't want us to believe in miracles
[1:21:44] he don't want us to believe in healing
[1:21:46] if he can stop us from believing in
[1:21:49] healing he knows we won't have faith to
[1:21:51] believe in a rapture but if we lay hands
[1:21:54] on the sick and they shall recover we
[1:21:57] lay hands on people and cast devils out
[1:22:00] of them and tumors are delivered then we
[1:22:04] say the god that can heal the tumor can
[1:22:07] change the body the god that can heal tb
[1:22:11] can change an old man to a young man
[1:22:15] he can remove gray hair
[1:22:19] that's our god
[1:22:31] hey
[1:22:39] i heard there's some speaking in tongues
[1:22:41] went around here last night
[1:22:43] my goodness
[1:22:47] ain't you all no deeper than that
[1:22:51] wow
[1:22:52] i mean here are you all acting like a
[1:22:54] bunch of
[1:22:55] acts 238 um
[1:23:14] well brother donnie don't you know when
[1:23:15] that which is perfect just come to that
[1:23:17] which is in part is done with i do know
[1:23:18] that so let's do away with knowledge
[1:23:28] because the knowledge we have now
[1:23:29] certainly is not going to be in the
[1:23:31] perfection of eternity
[1:23:34] well you can't see it right now but them
[1:23:36] demons are squirming
[1:23:38] brother brahman says sometimes
[1:23:41] i say this reverently
[1:23:43] theology
[1:23:45] and doctrines
[1:23:47] have clogged up your faith
[1:23:50] and clogged up your lines till you have
[1:23:53] been taught
[1:23:54] that those things can't be
[1:23:57] and it puts a block in the
[1:24:00] way i don't believe the holy ghost is
[1:24:03] here today to do a stint
[1:24:07] my stance has saved a lot of people's
[1:24:09] lives yes absolutely i'm grateful for
[1:24:12] every one of them but i believe the lord
[1:24:14] wants to do a little bit more than stent
[1:24:16] work this morning
[1:24:22] he said can you imagine this building
[1:24:24] being here energized tonight
[1:24:26] for light by electricity electricity and
[1:24:29] unseen force it was harnessed and
[1:24:31] brought on the earth when benjamin
[1:24:32] franklin first found it he screamed i've
[1:24:35] got it
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:38] but he says he didn't know what he had
[1:24:42] but along come edison
[1:24:46] and put it to work
[1:24:48] so brother adam did not come to take
[1:24:51] away the power of god
[1:24:53] brother branham knew and he had enough
[1:24:55] sense to know that he was found in
[1:24:56] basically a new move a new move which
[1:24:58] was a restoration move back to the
[1:25:00] original brother branham knew if god
[1:25:02] allowed him to look ahead in time he
[1:25:04] knew that his message would follow the
[1:25:06] same pattern as other messages down
[1:25:09] through the ages and that was that
[1:25:10] there'd be men that would raise up among
[1:25:12] them each one want to be the one that
[1:25:14] was going to be the leader of them all
[1:25:15] you know how that works that's man so he
[1:25:18] wants well we're the big guy we're the
[1:25:19] big guy got to come to us to get it all
[1:25:21] and what do they do they try to dam up
[1:25:24] the water
[1:25:27] now they try to dam up the water so that
[1:25:30] if you drink you got to come to them to
[1:25:33] get it
[1:25:34] and then they control the flow they
[1:25:36] control everything about
[1:25:38] it well hallelujah
[1:25:42] but you see i'm so glad that according
[1:25:44] to what jesus said in saint john 7 37 if
[1:25:47] any man believe on me as the scripture
[1:25:50] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:25:53] rivers of living water
[1:25:56] oh i'm glad today that we have a
[1:25:59] fountain that i don't have to go to new
[1:26:01] york i don't have to go to
[1:26:02] jeffersonville i don't have to go here
[1:26:04] and there and there to drink of the
[1:26:07] living water but i carry the well inside
[1:26:11] my body
[1:26:12] hallelujah i carry the well inside my
[1:26:16] body so if i need healing i go to the
[1:26:19] well if i need deliverance i go to the
[1:26:22] well if i need peace i go to the well
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:37] but you see i have the same problem you
[1:26:39] did
[1:26:42] satan tries to clog up my pipes
[1:26:46] with worry
[1:26:48] frustration
[1:26:50] fear anxiety any of you shouting people
[1:26:53] still deal with that
[1:26:55] if you don't today you will tomorrow
[1:26:57] don't worry
[1:26:59] tomorrow's monday
[1:27:03] going home part two
[1:27:05] notice brother ma'am says but we ask
[1:27:08] christians
[1:27:12] i almost did that and i thought if i do
[1:27:13] the whole building on him town
[1:27:17] we as christians become too
[1:27:20] clogged up
[1:27:23] we just can't understand well the doctor
[1:27:25] said
[1:27:28] i can't get well
[1:27:30] and as long as you think that
[1:27:34] then you're not thinking god's thoughts
[1:27:45] but you can imagine now
[1:27:47] brother ron showed me just day before
[1:27:49] yesterday
[1:27:51] a picture on his phone
[1:27:53] a mapping of his brain
[1:27:56] a tumor here and one there
[1:28:00] now looking at it humanly
[1:28:02] you say well the doctor said it's there
[1:28:05] the doctor said it's right there
[1:28:07] my little girl is going to be going down
[1:28:09] to nashville the seventh i think this is
[1:28:10] september and they're gonna map her
[1:28:12] liver
[1:28:13] and see if she's a candidate for some
[1:28:15] stuff called why nanny
[1:28:17] if she is she'll go back the next week
[1:28:19] and they'll put this radioactive stuff
[1:28:21] into her liver these seeds that'll go
[1:28:23] inside of her liver and stay inside of
[1:28:26] there and try to kill that cancer that
[1:28:29] is there
[1:28:30] the scan will say this and the scan will
[1:28:33] say that as i sat with her in the
[1:28:34] hospital several months ago and she was
[1:28:37] back there getting a scan done i had my
[1:28:39] laptop in my lap studying and the spirit
[1:28:42] of god come there to where i was
[1:28:44] and said don't believe their skin
[1:28:47] believe my word
[1:28:53] that's the report i believe
[1:28:56] that's the report i choose to believe
[1:29:13] hallelujah
[1:29:20] but when carol called her this morning
[1:29:22] to check on her before church
[1:29:24] her liver was hurting
[1:29:27] and it'll hurt and go into spasms
[1:29:33] so
[1:29:34] what do we do with those symptoms
[1:29:36] changes nothing
[1:29:40] does it affect you sure it affects you
[1:29:43] i'm not sure that it'd be me
[1:29:45] then be her
[1:29:47] as a matter of fact i told the lord
[1:29:48] about six months ago i said lord i'd
[1:29:50] much rather it be me
[1:29:52] i wish i could take it on myself
[1:29:55] you know how he is he's so lovely and
[1:29:57] wonderful and he said
[1:29:59] you don't have to
[1:30:01] i already did
[1:30:04] i already
[1:30:07] hallelujah he took your sickness
[1:30:10] he took your sickness he took your
[1:30:13] disease he took your stand upon himself
[1:30:18] if we can get our plumbing unclogged i
[1:30:22] believe the lord god could visit us
[1:30:24] right here today and it would be a
[1:30:27] meeting that would be around the world
[1:30:29] within 24 hours that god is moving
[1:30:35] among his people
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:45] well the doctor says i'm going to die
[1:30:49] all regards he says to the doctor but
[1:30:51] that's the best of his knowledge
[1:30:53] but if god could just clear that little
[1:30:56] channel
[1:30:58] and run energy
[1:31:00] down to that place
[1:31:02] something is going to happen
[1:31:09] maybe you've got a besetting sin in your
[1:31:11] life and you're troubled with this and
[1:31:12] you've asked god and asked god and ask
[1:31:15] god and you know how it is ever failure
[1:31:17] with that particular thing and satan
[1:31:19] uses it that failure to paralyze your
[1:31:22] face
[1:31:22] and say you've asked god to do it and he
[1:31:24] ain't done it you've asked god to do it
[1:31:26] and he ain't done it no sometimes you
[1:31:28] just got to keep on pressing right over
[1:31:30] the top of it and say devil you're going
[1:31:33] to be under my feet you ain't stopping
[1:31:36] me satan this the setting sin is going
[1:31:39] to be under my feet my failures mean
[1:31:42] nothing my sword comings me nothing
[1:31:46] hallelujah blow out my powder yarn
[1:32:04] hallelujah
[1:32:09] he said why did christ redeem us for
[1:32:13] why didn't it just make the atonement
[1:32:15] and say
[1:32:16] now there's no need of giving them deep
[1:32:18] powers
[1:32:20] there's no need of making this man a son
[1:32:22] of god there's no need in doing that
[1:32:23] i'll just ask him to believe it write
[1:32:25] his name on the book of heaven and
[1:32:26] that'll settle it
[1:32:28] but he gave us those redeemed blessings
[1:32:31] that we might operate in the work of god
[1:32:34] by the energy
[1:32:37] of the holy spirit
[1:32:40] and you all ever been shocked before by
[1:32:42] electricity
[1:32:46] it's a really neat feeling in it
[1:32:54] totally invisible
[1:32:56] and totally powerful
[1:33:01] for those of you who haven't done it i
[1:33:03] certainly don't advise you trying it
[1:33:04] after church but you can take our word
[1:33:06] for it it is really something
[1:33:09] don't you understand the energy of the
[1:33:11] power of god others will look at it and
[1:33:13] say why do they have to act that way why
[1:33:15] do they believe this it's because we've
[1:33:17] been touched by it before
[1:33:19] we've been shocked
[1:33:21] hallelujah
[1:33:22] we've been shocked by it and we want
[1:33:25] everybody else to get a touch of the
[1:33:28] same thing that we got because it will
[1:33:31] change your life forever
[1:33:48] notice how brother brahman says our
[1:33:49] minds
[1:33:51] are sluggish
[1:33:55] and the valves
[1:33:57] have been stopped up
[1:33:59] so here we are when we're under the
[1:34:00] anointing of the spirit of god we're a
[1:34:02] whale oil machine
[1:34:13] [Laughter]
[1:34:17] and then somebody will say
[1:34:19] you're a holy roller
[1:34:24] they say
[1:34:31] i don't want to be calling no holy
[1:34:33] roller most of the message folks ain't
[1:34:35] holy rotors they might be holy setters
[1:34:40] [Applause]
[1:34:45] most of our holy ghost experiences
[1:34:47] wouldn't be identified as an acts 2
[1:34:49] because they were drunk
[1:34:50] well they thought they were drunk they
[1:34:51] was just kind of staggering around and
[1:34:53] most of us have got to drunk i reckon we
[1:34:55] passed out we just kind of said
[1:35:01] we don't move we don't worsen
[1:35:03] well praise the lord
[1:35:09] our minds are sluggish
[1:35:11] paralyzed
[1:35:17] i hope and pray to god
[1:35:20] i never stand before him
[1:35:23] and him say to me
[1:35:25] you
[1:35:27] paralyzed
[1:35:29] my people's faith
[1:35:35] you told them i was not the same
[1:35:39] you shamed them
[1:35:41] from worshiping me
[1:35:43] i'll tell you preacher's gonna have a
[1:35:44] lot to answer for one of these days
[1:35:51] come on friends we're not pointing our
[1:35:53] fingers today so much as individuals but
[1:35:55] you and i both know we've had meetings
[1:35:56] and went to meetings before and it was
[1:35:58] nothing but outpouring of slugs and
[1:36:02] sluggish thoughts and sluggish teaching
[1:36:06] and when you left
[1:36:08] you just felt so
[1:36:18] then you come up here and you go
[1:36:21] [Applause]
[1:36:29] oh
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:44] now i know this is very simple but it's
[1:36:46] still very
[1:36:47] powerful really
[1:36:48] brother baby says it can't flow free
[1:36:50] like it should unless you let the holy
[1:36:52] spirit
[1:36:53] so dominate our lives till it pushes
[1:36:56] those valves
[1:36:58] and life begins to start operating
[1:37:00] we just can't open those little clogged
[1:37:02] up channels to let the spirit flow you
[1:37:05] see dig it out
[1:37:08] get cleaned up
[1:37:10] and the more you dig
[1:37:12] the better off you'll be
[1:37:14] the ecclesiastical systems that's got
[1:37:17] you all the channels plugged up pull
[1:37:19] them old logs out the days of miracles
[1:37:22] is past we don't need divine healing
[1:37:25] today now notice the logs

[1:37:30] for you to cut your hair you women it's
[1:37:32] okay to wear a mini skirt and it's okay
[1:37:34] to wear high heels while anybody in the
[1:37:36] presence of god that's got much of a
[1:37:37] conscience and no better than that just
[1:37:39] by conscience itself but notice the laws
[1:37:42] of theology we'll be saying the days of
[1:37:45] miracles has passed and we don't need
[1:37:46] divine it's a shame brother branham
[1:37:48] dealt with that when he was here and
[1:37:51] spent years of his life striking that
[1:37:54] devil and it comes right back around in
[1:37:56] the very same message
[1:38:02] it may come around
[1:38:04] but we're going to knock its head off
[1:38:08] hallelujah it may come around but it's
[1:38:12] going to get in trouble when it does
[1:38:15] hallelujah
[1:38:16] [Applause]

[1:44:40] wild wilderness a lot of the thousands
[1:44:42] times tens of thousands of blm land and

[1:49:00] god's people won't know if he's the same
[1:49:02] they won't know what to believe no more
[1:49:04] and the water will become so stagnant
[1:49:07] and they'll barely hang on from church
[1:49:09] service to church service but the
[1:49:11] prophet of god said we ought to be so
[1:49:13] completely surrendered to god he said i
[1:49:16] believe a man or a woman can live so
[1:49:18] close to god that the devil don't know
[1:49:21] what to do with you

[1:52:22] it ought to be actually
[1:52:24] 7.4 to 7.8

[1:52:29] blue green moss and the such and such
[1:52:31] and so and so to do so and so and such
[1:52:34] and such
[1:52:36] [Applause]

[1:53:27] of such and such and so and so and so
[1:53:30] but they're scared to death

[1:53:56] this is our season yes hell will come
[1:53:59] against us but hell is already defeated
[1:54:19] this
[1:54:25] if our faith
[1:54:27] can rise to the level
[1:54:31] to believe for the supernatural
[1:54:34] and always in one way felt sorry for
[1:54:36] brother brahm
[1:54:37] in the sense that brother branham
[1:54:40] never got to really preach a message
[1:54:41] convention
[1:54:43] brother man got to preach at his church
[1:54:45] branham tabernacle
[1:54:46] and of course in november of 65

[1:54:52] you know one little group one other
[1:54:53] group

[1:55:09] he missed the lord he always wanted to
[1:55:11] go back always want to go back and redo
[1:55:13] that mistake
[1:55:14] and goes back in 65 and they wouldn't
[1:55:16] let him preach i've been privileged to
[1:55:18] stand before tens of thousands
[1:55:21] of his converts
[1:55:23] i stood in kenya several years ago in a
[1:55:24] tent meeting over 5 000 people a night
[1:55:27] visiting that meeting and you look
[1:55:29] outside the parking lot there might have
[1:55:30] been 20 cars
[1:55:32] they rode bicycles they walked they took
[1:55:34] buses but you know what it was the sound
[1:55:36] of the evening time it was gathering
[1:55:38] them together
[1:55:40] and i thought how brother branham would
[1:55:41] have loved to stand here
[1:55:43] but you know what god ordained us god

[1:56:09] holy ghost is here to clean out your
[1:56:12] channel
[1:56:28] once you lay your hand on that person
[1:56:30] standing beside you

[1:58:05] now may the angels of god that are here
[1:58:08] present in this place may they pass
[1:58:10] through this building the prophet of god
[1:58:13] said in one place that the angels of god
[1:58:15] were there and demons were there and
[1:58:18] they were pulling one toward the other
[1:58:20] and he said the battle will go according

[2:36:05] moment
[2:36:07] what a meeting
[2:36:11] what a meeting
[2:36:12] that we have had
[2:36:14] [Music]
[2:36:18] aren't you thankful
[2:36:20] for don't you give the lord one more
[2:36:23] hand clapping
[2:36:29] hallelujah
[2:36:32] we so thank each and every one of you
[2:36:34] for coming out of your ways this past
[2:36:36] weekend all the gas money to hotels we
[2:36:40] know those things aren't cheap but i
[2:36:42] believe the lord has blessed you for
[2:36:43] those things but today we have for you
[2:36:46] we want to bless you in any way that we
[2:36:48] can and we have prepared a meal for you
[2:36:52] at our local high school we do not have
[2:36:55] a facility that is big enough to hold
[2:36:57] hold this meeting
[2:36:59] we thought about taking all the chairs
[2:37:01] out of here
[2:37:03] i'm just letting you stand because most
[2:37:04] of you were going to be on your feet the
[2:37:06] whole time but
[2:37:08] we wanted to give room for some holy
[2:37:10] sitters and
[2:37:12] we think we're going to need more room
[2:37:13] next year
[2:37:15] so if the lord doesn't come back we'll
[2:37:18] we'll put wings on this place or the
[2:37:20] lord will provide
[2:37:21] because i believe this bride needs a
[2:37:23] little bit of dancing roman
[2:37:26] but today we we have a dinner that is
[2:37:28] prepared for you
[2:37:30] that has prepared for you there at our
[2:37:32] local high school just right up the road
[2:37:34] it's about nine miles from the church
[2:37:36] here if you go on 33 west it'll take you
[2:37:40] right to the high school the name of the
[2:37:42] high school is spotswood high school and
[2:37:44] we're going to let you pull your phones
[2:37:45] out going to give you permission right
[2:37:47] now pull your phones out
[2:37:49] and take a picture right here you can
[2:37:51] take a picture of me with that if you
[2:37:52] want to
[2:37:53] don't do that

[2:37:56] there's the address it's 368 blazer
[2:37:59] drive and pin layered we really
[2:38:01] appreciate the hinkle family for sister
[2:38:03] wanda works at the school and and we've
[2:38:06] used this facility before we're really
[2:38:08] appreciative of rockingham county
[2:38:10] allowing us to use this facility today
[2:38:13] and uh there's a few things that we need
[2:38:15] to make note of that we need you to be
[2:38:17] aware of as you pull into the school
[2:38:20] you'll go around it makes a loop the
[2:38:22] main the main entrance you'll see you
[2:38:24] can't miss the building but it's the
[2:38:26] second entrance on the left hand side
[2:38:28] you'll see everybody entering there but
[2:38:30] you'll see that there's a fire lane and
[2:38:32] it's a it's a red paint there on the on
[2:38:35] the markers do not park where the red
[2:38:38] lines are
[2:38:40] look at your neighbor and say do not
[2:38:42] park where the red lines are
[2:38:47] you will get a ticket not from us
[2:38:50] but
[2:38:56] you won't get a ticket from him but you
[2:38:57] will get a ticket from the fire marshal
[2:39:00] but when you pull in just spotswood is a
[2:39:03] loop just circle around enter the school
[2:39:05] building on the left major entrance and
[2:39:07] we'll have someone there to make sure
[2:39:08] that you get guided in once there we're
[2:39:10] going to give you some final
[2:39:11] instructions for the facility but i want
[2:39:14] to give you i want to give you some
[2:39:15] pointers here watch your kids there are
[2:39:18] cameras everywhere in our schools here
[2:39:21] watch your kids
[2:39:25] watch your kids they're not my
[2:39:27] responsibility
[2:39:29] they're not our deacon's responsibility
[2:39:31] you enjoyed making them enjoy watching
[2:39:33] them
[2:39:42] god bless you you're in virginia
[2:39:48] we have two gems in the in the high
[2:39:50] school there one of the gems will be for
[2:39:52] the older age group about 12 and up and
[2:39:54] that's because some of these young
[2:39:56] people
[2:39:57] are horses on a volleyball court and
[2:40:00] they can't hurt you we've had to give
[2:40:01] instructions how to pull back full
[2:40:03] capacity on those things but in the
[2:40:05] smaller gym for where the little kids
[2:40:07] will be we have a jumpy house there for
[2:40:10] them i know that some of us olders might
[2:40:12] slip down there but remember that's for
[2:40:14] the little kids like myself and brother
[2:40:16] timothy
[2:40:20] but in in the main gym there right
[2:40:21] behind the cafeteria there'll be
[2:40:23] basketball volleyball and those things
[2:40:25] and we just ask that you do not take any
[2:40:27] drinks into the gym because last time we
[2:40:29] were there we had some spills and
[2:40:30] different things they allow that in
[2:40:32] there but we are asking that you do not
[2:40:34] do that so that we don't have to clean
[2:40:35] that up there's not janitors there it's
[2:40:38] it's the local body that's taking care
[2:40:39] of this we're cleaning up after
[2:40:41] ourselves and we would appreciate if you
[2:40:43] finish with your trash you go throw it
[2:40:45] in a trash can

[2:40:49] to do but respect the facility there's
[2:40:51] cameras everywhere we have designated
[2:40:53] places that will be we're going to have
[2:40:55] one main cafeteria for all all of the
