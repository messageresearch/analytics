personable he's so intimate with his children and what a blessing it is to be able to share everyday life with life I think it's a wonderful honor to be gathered here tonight in his presence to be gathered here recognizing that we are not alone but the Great I Am is in the building sister India that was one powerful song and I know you've sang it before but I believe that the Holy Spirit took it to another level tonight and I tell you we're just a blessed congregation to be a part of these things and see our see our families grow in the in the love of the Lord and in the faith of of our Lord Jesus Christ I tell you we're a blessed people to me and we're certainly privileged to have Johnny Thompson here with us this evening we weren't here last weekend but we heard about the Lord's

has a need that you'd like to take before the Lord [Music] Heavenly Father we so appreciate you Lord from the depths of our soul lord what a privilege it is Lord for us to be able to Humble ourselves before you and we are your children and to recognize that you are our father and to see you high and lifted up in the Praises of your people father to recognize this is not a worship of a man but this is the worship of the king the king of kings and the Lord of lords and we have humbled ourselves before you Lord and we recognize that we are insufficient on our own and tonight Lord every hand in this building has went up father because they have a need and they're asking Lord that your spirit would come and minister to them in a very special way tonight and Lord I pray that you just move us aside father and you begin to bless your people through the preaching of the word Lord we've studied these things have been on our heart Lord I pray that you would just take us father and use the human instrument mentality of humanity Lord to bring forth your word and bring an inspiration Lord behind it Lord that will charge the people's Faith Lord we recognize that you're here and you're pulsating to your people and we would ask Lord that you would have your will in your way in this service and we'll be careful to serve you and give you praise honor and Glory all that is due unto your name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church says God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles we'd like to look over in the Book of Genesis Chapter 14 verse 14 and then down to Hebrews chapter 6. Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13. isn't he wonderful to us amen Genesis chapter 14 and verse 14. and the Bible says here that when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them me unto hoba I hope I said that right which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother-in-lawed and his goods and all the women also and the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Shadow Amour and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Shava which is the Kingsdale and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and and blessed blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hands and he gave him tithes of all and the king of Sodom said unto him unto Abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself and Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth that I will not take from the from a thread even to a shoe latch it and that I will not take anything that is lying lest thou should say I have made Abram Rich Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13. Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13. the Bible says here for when God made Abraham made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently adored he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and oath for confirmation is to them and end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the immutability the MU help me brother William thank you yeah that's all right y'all know what we're trying to say immutability of his counsel he confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord I'd like to just look reference back again in Genesis chapter 14 and verse 19 that he or Verse 18 in Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and I'd like to take for a text this evening on blessed by the most high blessed by the most high God and here in the church age book you see he said now you'll notice that Jesus is walking alone in the midst of the churches he said there is no one else with him neither indeed can there be for he alone or her salvation and having purchased her with his own blood he owns her he is her Lord and Master she gives him all the glory and that Glory he will not share with any other there is no Pope with him there is no Archbishop Bishop with him Mary the mother of his Earthly body is not with him he does not speak and turn to a father for he is the father he does not turn to give orders to a holy spirit for he is God eternal spirit and it is his life that is flowing and pulsating in the church giving her life and without him there would be no life salvation is of the Lord there was no one with him when he trod the fierce he trod the fierceness of the Wrath of the fiery furnace it was not another but him who hung up on the cross and gave his blood he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the Alpha and Omega of our Salvation we are espoused to him and not another we don't belong to the church we belong to him can we say that together we belong to him his word is law Creeds and dogmas bylaws and constitutions have no effect on us yes it is Jesus alone who walks in the midst of the churches it is God in her willing and doing of his good pleasure never forget that you have only one relationship to God and God has only one relationship to you and that is Jesus and Jesus alone we only have one relationship to God and that is Jesus and Jesus alone as we said we'd like to speak to you on blessed by the most high God if you go to studying out the Bible and I'm just going to if you want to keep your Bible and your pins handy tonight I'm going to go through some scriptures but if you go to studying out in the Bible and go to studying out the names or the titles of God that God begins to reveal himself you'll find that God would declare himself in many different titles or many different names that he would Express to his children during a certain season or a certain time that they were in and if you'll go to stunning out the first part of the Book of Genesis that you'll find that God reveals himself using four names that are given to each of who of which reveals some distinct attribute of God at that time they are Elohim God lord Jehovah God Almighty El shadiyai which means god almighty and the most high which is El Elliot so there is follow him there is Jehovah there is El shadiyah and there is El eleon that God at the very first part of the Book of Genesis that God begins to reveal himself through those names and we can say that we recognize that he is Jehovah we recognize he is Elohim he is the self-existing one he is the almighty El Shaddai and he is El Elion the most high God and we recognize that that the very the the scripture reading that our pastor has taught us to read every day before we go out to work if Psalms 91 that that all four of these names are described in Psalms 91 verse 1 and 2 that he that dwelleth in the secret of the most high El helion shall shall abide under the shadow of el shadiyah and I will say of Jehovah he is my refuge and my Fortress and my Elohim in I him in my God in whom I will trust so we recognize that God is declaring himself as The Great I Am he's not a God that's often a distance somewhere but he's a god that is very present right here so let me let me just set this set this in course tonight on the most high God there is nothing that can escape the bounds of our God you see whatever you have need of is in our God and he declares himself as the great Jehovah and we recognize that when he would come and he would declare himself that Jehovah has seven compound names that reveal him as meeting every single need of humanity do you recognize that whatever you have need of in your body that there is a declaration where God would come and he would reveal himself in the seven compound names of Jehovah which is Jehovah Jireh the Lord and we'll provide Jehovah Ray father the Lord at that healeth thee Jehovah Nissi the Lord our Banner Jehovah Shalom the Lord our peace Jehovah Allah the Lord is my shepherd Jehovah tiskanu the Lord is our righteousness Jehovah's shama the Lord is present and we recognize that all of those seven compound names are wrapped together in the one holy name it is the name that is above every other name it is a name where men should be saved and only can be saved by that name and it is the name of Jesus Christ that every knee shall bow and every tongue that shall confess now we recognize that he is that's what the Bible has told us that elohion it's translated in the Bible that he is the most high God El is shortened from the form of Elohim and it speaks of God's strength but early on when it's placed together it means he is the strongest one it means that he is the most high God that means that there is nothing above him there is nothing that can get higher above him he is the strong one there's not a devil in hell that is stronger than our God there's not a devil in hell that can reach above the highest of our God El eleon knows it no bounds do you recognize tonight that your God knows no bounds when we have inhumanity things that we set at boundaries or things that we put outside of a box or things that we think are kind of out of our out of our realm of reaching there is no bounds to our God there is nothing out of the way of el eleon and I want to say this to you that you have been blessed by l-leon you see the authority of the most high God it transcends borders between nations it transcends Between Heaven and Earth between spirits and beings of physical beings and supernatural beings The Authority the authority of the most high God it transcends between angels and demons and between humans and animals his authority and Dominion span time and distance alike there is nothing and no one that does not fall within his domain and his jurisdiction so what I'm saying to you tonight there is no devil in hell that is safe here tonight in the house of God there's no devil there's no demon there's no power that is safe here because they are under the jurisdiction of almighty God do you recognize that every demon I say that is insufficient when they come up against El Elion they are under the jurisdiction of almighty God who is the possessor of Heaven and Earth and I'll tell you how high our God is that Satan God's Arch Enemy he wants and he wanted to be like the most high God you recognize how great your God is if you're great you will draw men to you but do you recognize that there was such a power in almighty God that his very Arch Enemy the one that he created to be the worship leader in heaven the one that was the chief cherubim he was he was the one that watched God as he was as he was there in creation he watched God In Worship and he recognized that there was a power that he had wanted to attain for himself but you notice what the Bible says in Isaiah 14 that how are thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer oh son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did his weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thy heart now notice I will ascended to the heavens and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God that's above you that's what he was trying to do I will exalt my Throne against above the stars of God and I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north and I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high God do you recognize that this power that El eleon has Satan has desired from the very beginning once he watched him in power he desired that power like El Eleanor yet thou Hast been brought down to think that this one that wanted to be like God has been brought down to Hell and to the sides of the pit and to think that the one that is tormented you the one that's given you mind battles the one that's given you pain in your body the one that's giving you backaches ones that's given you migraine the one that's made your pastor sick the one that's made your family sick the one that's come in and he's tried to kill you tried to steal from you try to destroy your family now try to destroy your try to destroy your marriage and destroy your prayer life and destroy everything about you notice what the Bible says that they shall see thee that they that shall see thee shall narrowly look upon me and consider these saying is this the man you think what he was kicked out of heaven he lost his position but he still has power but you as Sons and Daughters of God of Ilion narrowly look upon Him is this the man is this the one that made me fall is this the one that gave me bad dreams is this the one that made my pastor sick is this the one he wanted to be like your Jehovah he wanted to be like El eleon but there is a power in The Bride of Jesus Christ that they look upon this one and said who is this is this the one that made me sick is this the man that made the Earth tremble and that did Shake kingdoms to think that you'll narrowly look on him and think my what a worm now how does Satan get back up there in the heavens if he's if he's been kicked out how's he get back up there it's because your faith in him in believing what he said about you putting doubts and feeders in your mind without things that are up there but I want you to go over in Revelations chapter 5. you'll notice Satan tries to put himself above you but if you go over to Revelation chapter 5 you don't even you look at the elders you look at the worship person you look at God you look at the lamb there but there is one that is not in the picture your accuser's not in the picture Satan's not in the picture he can't get to where you are with a release book as the body of Jesus Christ the seals have been ripped off of it and you have full adore Authority Under the adoption of sons of God say well what Satan was wanting to do he was wanting to get the most powerful people on Earth the sons of God to worship Him to steal God's worship now how does he do that by taking this Bible by taking the book that you read and putting man's ideas upon it and bringing forth a powerless religion and bringing forth intellectual conceptions and ideas of thoughts of man and he brings about and he Waters down the gospel that everybody's okay everybody loves everybody and he brings in a worship through a charismatic move and he tries to rob the children of God from who they are but I'll let me let me let me quote a prophet to you he said God hates a powerless religion he said it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity because sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship not forms with genuine power worship to know that you've passed from death into life God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word he said when the church explains it away it says it's for some other day and something how can God who wants to fulfill his word and perform his word amongst the people to think that God wants that in a people now brother man I'm sitting now he said there's been churches churches there's been Brides brides but there's coming one on earth that'll be both both mechanics and Dynamics I want to say that she is on Earth she has sincerity so she has power she has power so she has real worship she has real worship so Eliana is in her midst notice notice when what he when he called Abraham Abraham was called before he got here before his father which was always a fly in the soup always a hair and a biscuit always getting himself getting himself mixed up Abraham was chosen and God Is So seen you even when it looked like your life was a hair and a biscuit God chose you even when you didn't look like you were faithful God chose you but notice what what he says here he said he didn't he gave him the Covenant unconditionally he said not because Abraham was Abraham he gave Abraham the Covenant because God himself chose Abraham and elected him before the foundation of the world you see it was by Grace he chose Abraham and not only Abraham but Abraham seed after him you see your choice had nothing to do with this it was not you that had anything to do with this God chose you before you could ever have a choice the Bible said in Romans 9 11 that he saw a hate and Jacob I love to think that God chose you when you were unworthy when nobody else wanted you in church when nobody else thought that you serve God God chose you rub that robot showed up that neighborhood God chose me now you wrote my wife's shoulder you can't unchoose me because God chose me but you see it could go places let's have let's have church here but no matter how far you got no matter how far you could have gotten sin no matter how deep you got in sin know how big a mess you got in God told you but God didn't call you to to to congeal to mix with the crowd he called you to be separators and that's exactly what God told Abraham to do from the very beginning was to separate himself from Friends separate himself from family separate himself from all of the things that he once knew Abraham loved the life that he lived in Abraham loved the land that he lived here it's hard to move but God called him to move God called him to a land you didn't move here you didn't move to this message the message called you but when you lose your friends when you lose your family God will be your friend when friends walk away from you Abraham had a friend when he lost his father when he lost his land when he lost what he knew was dear to him Abraham had a friend and you can search all the Bible out and you can find that the Bible said that Abraham was a friend of God you can search it all the way from the Old Testament all the way into the Book of James and you'll find that the Bible tells us that Abraham was called a friend of God now there's a lot of friends that I have in life there's too many to number all of you are my closest friends but if you think about all of the friends that you have in this world but to think that God is your friend it wonderful to have Jesus as your friend it did wonderful to know that when everybody walks away from you and when you've been called to separate that God is your friend you know that even the Israelites reminded God who he was and who they were and that they were the children of Abraham and that he was Abraham's friend and that there was a promise over Abraham's seed that's exactly what they did that's what they did in second chronicles 20 and 7 are not thou o God our God who did his drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gave us at the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever you see there's going to come some times in your life as a friend you're going to have to remind your friend what he has said about you it's okay to remind him that he was beaten for you it's okay to remind him that he took those stripes for you it's okay your friend remembers Hallelujah I wish I wish I had enough voice and enough energy to tear down every little piece of it's two by four in this place tonight because I recognize that if Ella Elliot the most high God is your friend if he's your friend it doesn't matter what comes [Applause] he's your friend in Good Times he's friend when you got Prosperity his friend when you ain't got money he's friend when you got food he's friend when you ain't got food he's friend when you ain't got no friends each friend when the friends are there he is your friend and brother random told us that Abraham was such a friend to God that he knew how to take the promise because Abraham knew the nature of God now you're talking about a friendship now I've got friends and I won't call nobody's name right here but I've got friends here that have have words sometimes that come out wrong and because I'm their friend I know exactly what they're saying without them saying it you know what I'm saying because I know the nature of the person it might come out one way but it's a God he me or the person means it a certain way and Abraham was such a friend to God that he knew the very nature of his promise even when Sarah his closest high on Earth was making fun and saying well look man it's been 25 years promised that that 25 years ago but Abraham had such a friendship you're talking about somebody that's your friend and early on do you know what I'm saying to you tonight there is nothing too high for your friend now I'm gonna tell you right now we've had a whole lot of short jokes in our family I was even working today but thank God God gave me a gentle giant by the name of Josh Jones there are things in my family that we can't reach because they are DNA markers that won't let us get over six foot tall but I got a friend and I don't get thinking about that today while I was unloading that box truck and I thought there are things there's no way that I can reach up there but brother Josh has got the authority because he's got the body to be able to reach up there and I'm beginning to think about that in the spiritual to think that we have a friend there is nothing too high out of the reach of almighty God it seems like cancer may be winning in this layout of seeing age but there is nothing too high for El Eleanor there is nothing too strong that he can't whip because the Bible tells us that the word of God will whip the devil any time any place under any situation because he's a saint yesterday today and forever if you need something up high and it seems like it can't reach you and you seem like he can't get around it ill early on is your friend [Applause] I'm gonna tell you there's no way I'm going to get through with this tonight so we're going to find a good resting spot and we're going to close it I'm not going to close right now don't get done don't get too excited don't pack your purse up yet I know it's cold outside but don't put it on yet I still got some more paper to throw at you but you begin to think about this and put it into perspective without getting too far into my into my thought here but do you begin to put it into perspective that the most high God is your friend and to think that that the Bible tells us in Proverbs 18 and 24 that a man that shows himself friendly will have friends and he said well I ain't got a liquor friends I ain't got nobody loves me if you have you ever tried showing yourself friendly you want to have friends so yourself friendly you want to have somebody love you show yourself that you can be loved but the Bible tells us that there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother to think that I'm close to my brother or a master today and I'm close to my brother William today because there is such a tie in the Earthly that we cannot be there's a bound that cannot be broken but to think that Jesus Christ the most high is your friend I got some Giants to squash tonight so let me throw this big rock of Revelation into this into the eye of Satan that says you have no friends that wants to tell our young girls that they cannot be loved that wants to tell our young boys that they've got to go the way of Laos here to have friends with the world you got to be popular with the world that's absolutely contrary when the most high is your friend when it don't look like the world is with you why don't you shut why don't you shut that demon that says you have no friends shut it down with the Friendship of Ireland thank you hey everybody I know what it's like to have friends but I know what it's like not to have friends you ever been in that spot where you ain't got a friend that you can talk to even though you can be the most friendliest person that there is it seems like nobody wants nothing to do with you ever been there foreign I know I'm talking to you you can be the class clown and you think a French but sometimes friends will walk away from you but this friend when your pastor can't get on the phone and talk with you and they can't talk you through what you're going through there's a friend and Abraham had a friend and almighty God and to think that Abraham had such a friendship that he would raise all of those all of the servants that was raised up in his household he would raise them and they were placed under the same Covenant that Abraham was under to think that Abraham when his when his brother lot his nephew got out there in trouble and he went down there as bachelin his backslidden brother went out there Abraham brought his 318 male servants that was raised in his house now do you people of the South that love the South I can go in there and throw you a quote that brother Burnham told you that God that he went in there and brought his Confederate Army with him he went over there and he took us 318 men and his Confederate Army out there and he went back there after after after a shelter more he went in there and took everything away these nine kings that had taken everything away from lot and went in there and built a community together and they they stole everything that was from lot but to think that all of these men that Abraham had brought to himself they were under the same circumcision Covenant that Abraham was under they were faithful and they was born in his own house and those that are born again by the father above you are under the same Covenant that Paul was under you're under the same Covenant that Peter was Hunter and to think that all of those promises that was laying there for Abraham was laying there for those 318 male servants but you watch the purpose of Abraham he wasn't going over there to get rich he wasn't going over there but he had one purpose and that was to bring back his back-slidden brother and he pursued all of them with just these 318 men after 9 to 15 kings that had went over there and noticed what he did he overcome them because he was under a covenant I want you to recognize that before you ever met Melchizedek you were blessed because you are chosen you notice what a perfect picture it was of Christ when Abraham went over there after his backslitting brother what was it it was exactly what our Lord Jesus Christ would do and he's here tonight and he's leading the faithful that's born in the same house of the Holy Ghost where Christ was born and pursuing the Wayward and backslin he's slaying every evil thought and he's slaying everything that's trying to overcome you because they were servants of the most high God now I'm Gonna Roll through some things right here but you begin to recognize that the three Hebrew children that they were called the Servants of the most high God when they wouldn't bow to the image of Daniel they said we don't know whether our God will but we know that he's more than able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace you're reminded that the King Nebuchadnezzar looked down in there and he seen the Servants of elihan walking in the midst of the fire he said but I see one likened to the Son of God that's walking in the midst of the fire with them so when Elion is with you you can come out of the fire and don't even smell like burning you don't even smell like fire I'll say this that you can go through the smoke or the bottomless pit that's raised its ugly head in this day and you can come out of laodicea with flying colors Satan knows Who You Are Satan knows who you are and he recognizes that the power of Jesus Christ is greater than he is and the power that's living on the inside of you is greater than everything that the Prince of Darkness has to think that there is deity dwelling in human flesh today now notice he said now if you'll believe that he's here his presence is here he said you believe that he's here now he's dealing with the patient he said it's a cancerous condition he said in that man sitting right there has the same thing he said them demons are screaming to one another you see for pity they're screaming for Mercy they're calling he said but so is the angels of God call him the battle is here he said but your faith will determine which way it goes laughs let me let me draw something to you just just before I go on in my thought that LL eon is in you the most high is in you and there are days when you can't feel like you feel like you can't get out of bed there are days when you wake up and you're worried but early on lives there it doesn't change your position because the way you feel Hellion lives there doesn't change that early on lives there when the money has ran out of your bank account it doesn't change that early on lives on the inside of your heart whether Satan's beating you or whether Satan's scared of you Elian lives there it doesn't change the facts whether the doctors give you good news or they give you bad news ill Elion lives in you it doesn't change the facts whether the whether your car breaks down Elion lives in you it doesn't change the fact when friends walk away from you l-alion what was an atom that would occur that would that would control and move the atmospheres and move the winds it was iwellian now you can go study out the Bible it's one of my favorite favorite readings it's Deuteronomy 28 9 we'll take you all the way through it but do you recognize that all of the blessings of Deuteronomy 28 come from Eliana to think that all of those blessings that I Will Bless thee when you come in and I will bless you when you go out that I will make you the head and I will make you the tale and it didn't matter whether Joshua felt like he was going into the promised land there was a blessing of Elian that was laying there when the ten spies turned their back on Joshua and Caleb and Eleanor still had a covenant that I am going to be with you with Abraham and his seat after him Hallelujah the land looked like he would conquer them but Elian said you'll conquer the land it looked like the Giants would conquer them and they looked like a bunch of grasshoppers in their sight it sounded it sounded too good to be true but El Elion remembered what he said about them and L Ellie on remembers what he said about you I want you I'm just because I'm gonna pray I'm gonna preach this for a little I'm gonna preach this for a couple weeks but uh Lord will unless y'all pull it all out of me tonight if y'all do that y'all pulled 82 Pages out of me please don't I want to be I want to leave here in my own car not a body bag laughs but I want you to notice 318 servants they go in and they take what they they went in there and they were looking for one they were looking for a lot and his family and everything that belonged to him brother Reuben and they went in there and got what they came for you see they went in there with a purpose in mind that they were going to restore lot to from his Fallen condition and they went in there and they won the victory now I don't know I don't you don't you know what victory means it means to defeat your enemy and to think they went in there under Covenant they went in there and when they got on the outside of that Covenant when they got excuse me when they got back after the victory had already been won then they have a meeting of meetings how many won something this week I ain't talking about something on the radio I ain't talking about something but I made one a real battle that Satan didn't win that Satan said he would destroy you I had the devil tell me this week I wouldn't make it back here but look who's still standing you notice they went out with one purpose and they came back and they restored exactly what they went out for but notice what happened after the victory had been won now this is a if you go to studying out history this is the very first battle that's ever laid out in the scriptures it's the first battle that's ever been recorded of the wars in history and for the very first time in human Affairs this was the celebration of Victory all right I'm talking to a bunch of angels y'all don't know how to have a party but this is Abraham and I you know sometimes sometimes if you've won I'm sorry too much Humanity going on up here but you ever win something man and call your name out I ain't never won anything today and you can sit there as a most dry-eyed sanctimonious donkey but when you win something you know I find it amazing it's these people that want to shut down emotion you let them win one time [Music] call their name at a raffle and you'll see if they don't believe in Emotion call their name you'll find out whether they believe in emotion or not but Abraham this is the very first time in history give me a little bit of Liberty here it's the very first time in history that there's ever been a battle it's the very first time that they ever had to battle but this is the very first time that they come back packing a victory and I don't believe Abraham just sat around but I believe that he had himself a party I believe that he had himself a good old dance and he had himself a good old shout because he came back with what he went in for let me preach to you right here who you're parting with now I better not say it like that somebody on the internet shut me down but I know I'm okay here but who you're celebrating with is Melchizedek hallelujah oh you are in Victory with is Melchizedek he is the priest of the most high God it didn't matter what the Three Kings or the nine Kings or the 15 kings that about them they said and Abraham wouldn't bring back lot but do you think Abraham cared when he was over there celebrating with Melchizedek you see what happened who came out to meet him who met you after the seals who met you after full restoration who met you after the restoration of the gifts back in the body there's a lot of people that want to shut down the move of God and they want to shut down the gifts of God but we are a people that have been restored back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers I feel I feel a charge of Ten Thousand Angels up here we have been restored back we have been the seals have been released we have an open book in hand it's not a king sword but it's the king's sword Hallelujah and we are fellowshipping with Elohim with Melchizedek he had no father he had no mother he had no beginning he has no ending he is the rose of Sharon he is the lily of the valley he is the awesome God He is the Mighty God he's a mighty deliverer he's a strong tower he is he is The Offspring of David he is my victory he is my everything [Applause] you forgive me what's wrong with this bunch of people they're celebrating with Melchizedek Melchizedek is here that's why William Branham could stand there when he spoke to him I said speak to that tumor let me tell you when you've got the most high talking to you I'll be real careful what you think right now but when you got the most high talking to you it's all right Satan's nervous I like that but when you got the most high talking to you and here's this this tumor that's on her it's been laying there causing all this pain and the most high talks to you that says speak what you will and it will be why would I doubt the most high now you give me one good reason why I should doubt our early on and you think that you can get by with your thoughts and you think that you can get by with your intellects and you think that you can get back with your religious spirit and you think you can get by with your jealousy and you think you can get by with all of your life and you can try to tell me I'm trying to eat this thing you can try to tell me that that I shouldn't trust L Ilion when men try to put their opinion over ill Elian let me tell you I will take elihan over top of every man's idea over top of everything that they try to bring up El eleon is higher his demonstration is higher than their intellects his power is greater than any Earthly follower he is stronger [Applause] he's stronger than cancer he's a mighty God he's stronger than tuberculosis he's a mighty God he's greater than sugar diabetes because he's a mighty God he's greater than back pain because he's a mighty God every Demon's got a bow through early on every demon every sickness every Cancer Donald Trump's got to battle this name Joe Biden's got a bow to this name Putin's got a bow to this name every demon in hell has got a bow to the name of Jesus Christ I say bow Satan bow before almighty God I'm not here on my own accord I'm not trying to preach to you something that'll influence you an emotional realm I'm trying to tell you that no matter what you go through ill early on is there [Applause] it was after the victory that Melchizedek the priest of the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth how communion with his child when Sodom didn't want him well Gamora didn't want him he stayed with Abraham when they kicked him out of the churches he had communion with you when they bound him at the doors of Creeds and dogmas he stayed with you when your own family wouldn't accept him he stayed with you when cat when pain come rushing in like a flood he stayed with you he said because I am the spirit of the Lord and I will raise a standard foreign this ain't just your typical communion where a priest blesses the bread and the priest blesses the wine but this is a communion with God's theophany God has a theophany and you have a theophany and to think that you've been fellowshipping with the one that had his back turned to Abraham's tent foreign the one that's there when you ain't got groceries he was the one that put him on the step he was the one that blessed you when others cursed you when others tried to stop you he pushed you forward because the lamb is advancing his children between the breach and to the opening of the seals he's bringing his children to full Authority as Sons and Daughters of God and the pillar of fire has made its way back into its believing children again and he's operating in a body that's got full Authority Under the headship and this body does not move without thus saith the Lord this body is is totally depending upon the intellects of the headship and this headship that has been brought down is his threefold purpose in body form that he would have the preeminence in a body that he she would be live voices and at the last Trump we will meet him in the air I want to tell you Church of the Living God that you are not worshiping an imaginary God you're not worshiping some Hocus Pocus but you are worshiping a living God and what is a living God it's the word in you making itself real and that word is in this body it's the one that Jacob wrestled with it's the one that Joseph was in a pit with it's who he rose to the palace with oppression's got to Bow before him depression's got to Bow before him everything that you come up against has got to Bow before the name of almighty God I want to say God sees you if you are blessed by the most high God if you want to see better you climb higher and the Bible tells us that we don't look at the things that we see but to look at the things that we don't see and we've been told to look past what you think look past what you see and think past what you think why is this equal anointing taking you higher because it is of el helion to be able to pierce through the darkness we're the most powerful people on the face of the Earth were the most anointed church that there's ever been still got needs let's just come down to it at the end of the day you're a human at the end of the day you still get sick at the end of the day you still have to take vitamins at the end of the day you still have to eat I have yet to come in here and see a bunch of angels wings but oh early on is your friend when it doesn't look like your mate is coming in life El eleon has your mate already picked out I think it's amazing when mothers and fathers begin to play the game I don't know who's playing games over in that corner but you might want to steer away from there seem a little pushy I love it when when parents begin to say oh that one could work he's got a good job yeah baby it wasn't meant for my daddy I highly doubt that I would have Katie Spencer sitting here in the building tonight because he had a great reputation because there was a whole lot of Works in my life that didn't look too didn't look too good how'd that come into this I it's an early on service I love it when parents begin to you know that one I think I could get along with him or she could get along with us she brings a lot to the table do you see them mashed potatoes she brought to the Thanksgiving whoa she put on an extra slab of butter for me yes you'll work if you're on the internet forgive me that's how she got it she didn't she had an extra slab of butter serving Jesus is the best thing but when Eliana has got you figured out before you figure yourself out let's just face it you're a mess you wake up in the morning you can barely figure out what shoe goes on the right foot did I brush my teeth or didn't I dear God I hope you went back in and brushed them do it twice if you got to yeah early on cares about it take care of this Temple there were some real days there's some real days in the cancer Journey foreign when you get a phone call and your best friend has just been told without any without any warning you got tumors in your brain get your family and make your preparations it'll make you get down on your knees I Cry and you can be the strongest individual and you can feel like a great giant 10 minutes before but let the enemy come and knock your props out from underneath of you and you'll find out you need hell Hellion yeah there's some real times in this battle brother Chris if hell Elian wasn't on my side where would I be there were some times when it didn't look like things were going to be good he's been that kind of friend ain't he brother Lawrence he was always there he was always there it was that unseen hand that you felt slip underneath of you he was always there it was always there sister Gabrielle Hill in everything he was always there he's my water when I'm thirsty he's my food when I'm hungry he's my health when I'm sick and he is my Prosperity when I'm poor and when I am weak then I see his strength let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich when it don't feel like you're blessed you are blessed by the priest of the most thy God God bless you as you stand with us this evening it's amazing when you if it wasn't for a prophet's voice in this day I don't know what we what we do you can begin to think about here I am I understand what's here I understand what's on the back side of this and understand what's laying here in these notes you have no clue you're just praying all week long that the Lord would bless you with a word of encouragement and if I would hand you a sealed letter if I'd hand you a sealed letter you would have no knowledge of what's on the inside of it but if you break it then you're able to understand what is there and then when you read it it begins to give you the language of the author and I think it's amazing that you can stand here behind this pulpit and you have a great idea of how God's going to take the service but because of the needs of the people El eleon goes above man and he goes above our thinking and he brings a word by your way to show that he's Mighty over your situation can you say he's mighty he's Mighty over your situation [Music] Christ aren't you amazed when it don't feel like you got the Holy Ghost he is your Holy Ghost isn't it amazing don't you love him tonight let's sing this worship to him tonight and give praise that is due to him thank you let's see [Music] what I was [Music] and in my life my life was mine [Applause] recovering of the secret [Music] s foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] there's been days [Music] [Applause]
