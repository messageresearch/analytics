voice I heard and sister Gabrielle they team up together they might just take us into Heavenly places and amen don't God just have the best of the best amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord today isn't it we certainly have enjoyed the our time in the presence of of the Lord this weekend and we as we always do we're certainly thankful for the spirit of the Lord that is amongst us and uh today we just want to make an announcement to you as a church and then to our viewing audience as well we know that we have our Labor Day meeting that is coming up this year and uh here in September it'll be August the 30th 31st and September the 1st and we have invited brother Timothy brother Tim puit and brother Donnie Reagan again this year to be our speakers this year and we're very excited about about that and and as you all know we're the Lord is adding uh adding members to the church and uh quicker than we can keep up with and we just see what the work of the Lord is doing and what's amazing to me is to watch how the Lord's is not just is not just coming from different churches but the spirit of the Lord is is grabbing Sons and Daughters of God right off the streets and different Avenues of life and and I just I just love how the message is at work and you realize that we're not serving a dead God but we're serving a living God and it's it's a it's a living letter and we are watching the very physical attributes of God being made manifest right here amongst us that being said our our church is growing exponentially and um as you know here it it it gets rather rather tight here sometimes at uh at church and so we have decided we we've uh earnestly prayed about this uh for quite some time about how to house this meeting how to handle it so we have decided this year to take our Labor Day meeting to Mont VI Middle School right up there uh right there in mville area it's right there behind actually brother Vernon brought this up last night it's right there behind brother Bill Hinkle's property there right where our church started years years ago and I believe from our our understanding is that is Brother Bill Hinkle's dad's property back in the day and so we I've asked the brothers if they could just kind of cast a a picture of what the auditorium looks like it can house about 600 uh 600 uh comfortably there and then we can set out seats and it'll give us enough ample space to be able to we haven't been able to have a choir be able to sing in our Labor Day meetings uh for for quite some time but we will now be able to have the space to be able to have choirs we'll be able to have the have the space to have prayer lines if we would decide to have that we were we would actually have room to be able to have altar calls and worship and and we're just we're very we're very thankful that we were able to find a facility and it's actually brother Roger and sister an Sailors their their grandson is the assistant principal there and we just felt so comfortable dealing with Brother Brad the other day just dealing with him and just we we prayed about it and ask the Lord is this the right thing to do because it it's it it means a lot to have an atmosphere where you can have a Revival and to take it from this this church building to take it to another facility it's a huge thing but we felt we felt inspired by the Lord to do these things we looked at different facilities for the past uh past little bit and this one just this one just felt right and uh all of the all of the details of it being on brother Bill Hinkle's Grand or his father's place and right there behind brother Randy and brother Bill's Place and we just we just felt very very moved to have the meeting there so if you want to you can invite your friends you don't have to be afraid about space now and and I know that there are many that have reached out to us and said they wanted to come but they didn't know if they would be able to get in the building and things we will now have ample space to be able to house some meeting in and uh we just we want you to be praying with us about that and I know that'll be a it'll be a big undertaking for all of our musicians and sound guys and and things but I believe that I believe that the Lord will bless it abundantly we are intending to have our dinner just like we do every year uh or until until uh sister Wanda says we can't have it there no more we're planning to have our dinner that Sunday at Spotswood High School so we'll leave Mont videoo and then go to uh spotwood high school and if you're watching you're not familiar with the area it's it's about 10 minutes from from the church here is where the meeting will be at and we just we just wanted to bring that before you as a church congregation and and I want you to be praying about that and we want we want all of our visitors to feel welcome and and know that that they are welcome to come to these meetings and I believe that it'll be a great blessing it'll be a great blessing to the Lord and you know we're just we don't know I I believe that the Lord could come back today that's my anticipation I believe that he could come back before the preaching of the word ever takes place that's that's my heart but we have to make plans we have to make plans for for the future and uh so we just want to uh be mindful of that and just just to kind of make a note there there is a time limit on the on the evening Services we will have to be be out of the building by 11:00 so is what I've been told that the alarms will sound off you can you can worship all the way up to 10:45 but get out of there so so I I told him I told him you know it ain't the first time Cops been called on us so this time it'll be for Spiritual reasons so but so the so that being said the times of the services will we will adjust the times uh just to kind of if if we feel that we're going to have a prayer line we're going to be praying about those things but we will adjust our times for that meeting and uh we want to make sure that everybody's got ample time to be able to get off of work on Friday and things of that nature so we'll we'll reach out and send out a flyer put it on our church Facebook and different things like that so everybody has all the details and you'll uh you'll be able to share that with uh with your friends and your family and amen God's just doing wonderful things and you know I I believe that that we can have a convention right here today I believe that the Lord can come and you know today is a very special day for us amen very special day I get to introduce our pastor to come and speak to you today amen amen hallelujah well praise the Lord amen amen isn't it good isn't it good certainly thankful for all that the Lord has done for our pastor certainly thankful for his stand and being able to stand there throughout all of it and still stay steadfast in his faith and we're just very grateful for our pastor and uh we have give him instructions to take it easy so we'll see how how he listens so but we just want to invite our pastor to come at this time and I know that you're I know that you're expecting great things today so let's just go to the Lord today and let's just let's just worship him as we invite brother Ron to come and let's just open up our let's turn our cups up and say God

just see how it goes amen I was so sorry I was not able to be at brother Sea's tent meeting this year last week and it kind of just ripped my heart out and uh we we were told that we had to wait a certain time and then that we got doctor's appointments in front of us that could restrict us for quite a while and so we thought we'd put our foot in the water and it's kind of like telling a racehorse to uh walk amen God bless you this morning so good to see you amen God bless you brother Marcus Amen brother Roger so good to see you amen amen amen we certainly want to tell sister Vicky this morning that we we pray for you and and your family and uh I thought yesterday went really well and I just pray that God strengthens you and helps you today maybe you have a need on your heart this morning you just like say I would like the Lord to pass by my way I believe you can he can come to an audience of many diverse people and have a such way for some it might be like a thunderbolt but for others like a still Small Voice why don't you invite him your invitation means more than anything Heavenly Father Lord we're just thankful for this wonderful group of people that are here this morning Lord how we love you with all of our hearts and we're so thankful that we can stand here once again we ask you to bring us strength and I ask you to anoint our hearts now Lord all of us have raised our hands before you and we have great needs now you're the kind of God that can come and speak to an audience many people and go to every need whether watching by the internet Lord I just ask you you see our needs and our needs are important to you and I pray that you would stretch forth your hand of Mercy as we surrender ourselves to your will touch us now strengthen us father Lord this body you see how we need your help today in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and amen amen God bless you God bless you I'd like to read you a prayer I was in study this morning and the last the last thing that I came to brother brandom was in prayer and and he was preaching the evidence of the Resurrection it's almost the middle of the sermon and he says oh Lord if I have found Grace in thy sight strengthen this feeble body renew my strength and renew my youthful strength as you do the Eagles and put my head high and Lord my heart low that I might walk Lord yet and manifest your love to the people give unto me deeper love more consecration a deeper full of life Fuller life that I might Serve You Lord manifest your power tonight among the People by Healing The Sick and The Afflicted giving witness to your resurrection and we'll give thee Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus we ask you amen and amen amen Revelations chapter 21 so good to see each and every one of you and I'm on a time limit so you just we go Revelations chapter 21 and verse 5 let's just go to verse four amen God bless you and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes what a moment and there shall be no more death I hope Satan is listening neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new what a thought and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will and I will give unto him that is a thirst the Fountain of Water of Life freely and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son you may be seated this is every one of us our our expectation in our future a place where there's no more death nor sorrow nor any of those things that we have to struggle with anymore that's what our future that's what I hope for maybe this morning you haven't maybe fully decided in your heart that you haven't truly give your heart to God May today be the day amen now we realize today that we're raised for this moment 6,000 years of time has went by and seasons has went by and Prophets has stood on the scene and spoke in their season and their time and under the inspiration of the anointing of those Messengers there was a people that were gathered to overcome whether it was Old Testament or even New Testament Luther in his age men of God raised to preach the message of the hour that the just shall live by faith and we don't have to pray to Saints and we don't have to pay for prayers and buy candles and we don't have to be a part of tradition but God is justifying usen thank you Lord and what a rival that sent forth Wars begin to happen incredible Wars begin to happen when all that took place and we realize that it goes from from one dispensation to another dispensation and as our Prophet would stand there and pick out the messengers he didn't do it but under the word of God picked out the messengers of the day that God used that the angels of God was with with them it wasn't just the messenger but it was men under them that would preach and then people under there that would catch the revelation of the hour and would overcome you're that kind of a people you Lord God just didn't handpick brother Brandon to be the messenger of the age and and anointing just to send forth a message and then that be it but he raised up men of God with an inspiration to take this message every one of them diversely gifted no man like another we don't want to copy each other and neither are we in a competition we're not raising kingdoms up we're not trying to outdo anybody are you with me we are we're here to preach the message and if I could say it right and this may be against the law in the state of Virginia if I'm going to bait for deer if I'm going to bait for deer I put out things that deer will eat so we're message Believers and we're commissioned to preach Eagle food amen that Eagles will gather to and eat the message of the hour now we realize as this message is a vision and it's a it's a message that is of restoration and it's also preparing us with the wedding garment for the coming of the Lord not just the coming of the Lord but resurrected saints that are being called forth and we realize that we're in a window of time that is incredibly it's a brief it's a brief opening it's a window of time brother Brown said pinch yourself pinch your conscience it'll pass right through you it'll pass right through you don't miss it and he would constantly remind us don't you miss this don't miss this don't miss this now catch this what I'm getting ready to say yes Lord are you with me now so we realize that the clock the time of the clock is intercepted with prophecy amen now we're not in a day of playing Church on we're not in a day to where we play church or entertain or or try to try to do any of those things because we realize that we have responsibility and we have a purpose that God is going to Rapture not just 90 year olds and change their bodies but there's going to be children here and we realize that you came from the Lamb's book and so it is God that has gathered you I watched Brother David run to the altar last night I I watched him just come out of his seat and run to the Altar and I thought no man can make a man do that a few months ago he would been out of his mind to to run to an altar that's right he never had that in his plans but God deposits something in you some of you that are moving out of the Amish communities let me just say this you years ago you never thought that you'd be in this stage of your journey and now you're leaving friends and family and homes and jobs and situations it isn't a man that did that it's God that has did that and let me just say this to you and any question that's in your mind if God's did it he'll be the provider he'll be the way maker Hallelujah he's in control of it all am [Applause] are you with me so we're merging we're merging the message is coming off of paper and off of tape and it's merging into events and I want to just I want to go through some of these things this morning in Revelations chapter 19 in verse 6 and I heard as if was a great voice of a multitude and a voice of many Wat and a and a voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah notice these next words for the Lord God omnipotent reth who's in control who's in control of this and now now it comes our time it's an emotional scripture let us be glad and rejoice amen and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife you're a part of the many membered bride around the world and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ar raay and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he said to me WR blessed are they which are called to the married supper of the lamb and he saith unto me John standing there with him these are the true sayings of God he spoke it then he made sure his messenger brother Jim was paying attention and he amened his own words that's right 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 1 but are the times in Seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night and when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren I want you to be really attentive right now are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief you're all the children of of light and the children of the day you're not of the night nor of the darkness lay out of sea is just full of Darkness every age has an allotment of darkness and every Overcomer had to say I'm not a the darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober and they that are sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are Drunken In the Night drunk on the cares of life and let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for a helmet of salvation and hope of salvation for I love these words for God hath not appointed us to wrath Hallelujah wrath's coming wrath's happening but we're not a part of that but to obtain salvation but by our Lord Jesus Christ we all ought to shout right there brother brandom is speaking and recognizing your day in this message and he just making some comments he said the church is not recog ized her day like Israel forced back to Palestine she is going to be forced into the world ccil of churches and he says she didn't recognize her hour people come out of her be not a pakers of her sins flee flee your life or you're caught with the mark of the beast and and can't do nothing else about it he said let he said let him that's filthy be filthy Ste let him that's holy not will be holy holy now let him that's holy not a boobed haed woman she can't be now that sounds very flat but that's the scripture she dishonors her head and her head is her husband and her head is Christ so she dishonors Christ how can she be dishonorable and and not be filthy let's let's let she that she's bobbed her hair keep it let he that wears shorts keep on wearing them let he that denies the word keep on denying it it's pretty blunt in it whatever you are you are but let him that's holy be holy still let him that's righteous be righteous still let and the righteousness of the word of God the Son of God made manifest be holy still righteous still righteousness yes sir he said the church is not recognized her day like Israel back in her Promised Land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put there why National Force put put her in her place 2500 years out of her place and it put her back in her place now he says I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in her Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ will put her in her place listen when you hear those words you can't miss it oh I'm just hanging on let me just say you're not hanging on you'd give up if you could the pressure would be too great but just when you feel like giving up there's another Power there's another Spirit that's hanging on to you not just to hang on to see if he if he can do it he's got a purpose he's got a purpose in doing it no naal no Forest will do it but the National Force will drive Israel to her Homeland National forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it sometimes we need to ask oursel where are we at brother B ask a question I'm sorry I just want to lay a few things down here in God of his evil age and just the things that you have saw in the last months taking place I want to just speak about some of those things for a few moments and he asked an incredible question has God lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control I wonder the true answer to this question is to my opinion I'll take his opinion there is two opposing spirits in the world today at work now there can't be more than two two heads one of them is the holy spirit at work and the other is the spirit of the devil in these last days in deceptions two Spirits one of them's God's Holy Spirit and the other's the devil Spirit can we agree working in deception and he makes these words the people of the earth now remember who he is he's a messenger he's God's voice to this generation now listen not everybody accepted him but he delivered the male well I don't believe he's Elijah he still delivered the male well I don't believe he met an angel he met an angel well I don't believe the Seven Seals it was a Seven Seals I don't believe the book's open it's open as a matter of fact it don't believe what you don't believe there's a people that'll hear the word and become the word and brother Bram said the people of the Earth are now making their choice people walk into a a booth and they click they make a they make a they make a a a a check and then they confirm and they've now voted their vote for an office whether it be the local man or or the president of the United States and you think well I made a choice well let me let me just say if we can go way higher than Humanity God causes men to rise and he causes men to fall he raised Kings and he raises presidents he he raises men up these men are going to fulfill purposes they're going to fulfill purposes just like you're going to fulfill purposes whether you know it or not in the last few presidential elections we've watched Sodom get her full freedom I think we we all should agree I'm not asking you if you're democrat or republican God callused men to he actually caused men to open the gates they literally open the gates they've opened the borders they've literally opened the borders and Spirits from every realm of hell has been loosed on the earth the very the very top of hell has been opened up every Spirit has been loosed on the earth people don't know whether they're a cat or dog or they're male or a female or but the scripture says these things must be now brother brand makes a statement I think is very powerful he says God's purpose can never be defeated now you're a solid group of people some of you are newer but I'm finding you newer people are F grabbing this message with all your heart Hallelujah I want to say this to you God's purpose can never be defeated he goes down in that paragraph what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no d there's no power there is nothing can ever separate God's Great Immortal in Eternal plan and it must be as God has said so let's just go back how did you get here David how did you guys get here God's Got A Plan amen and the devil no doubt tried to stop you along the way and discourage you along the way how did you get here God's Got A Plan Chester how did you arrive here God's Got A Plan now he's not playing checkers on a board or chess and moving King and knights and PS and Bishops he's got a plan on this Earth and yes the devil is the king of this Earth but God's [Applause] greater and I want to say this with all the strength that I've got in me his seat will not be destroyed his seed his seed will not be destroyed Glory he has a purpose in your life each individual that no one else on the face of the Earth can take your place that's how important you are no one else on the earth and I don't care what their book says that they are I don't care how many initials are after their name I don't care how much money they make God chose you before there was money he chose you before there was Kings he chose you before there were churches and what he deposited on the inside of you he will not [Applause] lose and let me just let me just back it up with his own word I'll not lose a one [Applause] brother Ron go through some difficult times brother Bram reads a PO must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of East While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seas and he says this he says I must fight if I must Reign increase my courage amen Lord now if we begin to think about how we got here the Book of Revelation she makes two statements that stands out to me this morning come and see I don't know what's going on at your church come and see John was standing there and the angel was telling him come and see now first of all you can't come if you don't have an invitation you go to a wedding there's a lot of weddings happening this year you know you just don't nonchalantly go well I think I'll go no no it's an order there's an order to it yeah you have to have an invitation well that's rude they excluded me no they can't hand a certain amount of people and they sat down and thought well who's important to me and I know there's going to be people going to be offended but I'm going to invite a 100 people and these are the 100 people I'm going to invite I've never got mad over that but when you get an invitation you're invited and when you get invited you you now have a responsibility not show up in your bib overh house so if you're going to believe the message you got to get dressed there's another statement that says come up here you can jump until you're blue in the face and can't raise yourself to another realm but it's God that reaches down to you and opens the eyes of your understanding and he says come up here there I'll show you the Lamb's wife when John saw his name in the book All Of Heaven heard it the underneath Earth heard it he got emotional when he saw himself in the word that's what causes you to get such a stimulation it's more than job and Jonah and Jeremiah and David but now you see yourself in the opening of the word no you're not going to see it all the first day now it's it's kind of like eating an elephant if you're going to eat a whole elephant you're going to do it one bite at a time you're not going to understand everything in a day this is not like your new body where you change into and then you see it all you're still flesh and so there's some things about forgiveness you're not going to really understand until life begins to happen things about cleansing your spirit and keeping your spirit clean when the enemy tries to contaminate it you're going to understand as you walk with him right thank you Lord how to conduct yourself as the Lamb's wife because there's a protocol cuz you're the Queen of Heaven you're not one of the frilly little girls you're the Queen of Heaven you're the Ester you got to understand your your place and you got to understand that it comes with authority oh I wish I had time to preach you you got to understand you're just not a [Applause] church you just don't have a program are you with me now I no longer call you church I call you bride and as you go along you realize that you're full fulfilling a vision that you didn't see about yourself but God saw about you and you begin to walk and you begin to surrender your life to it you begin to walk and you begin to enjoy life and and when you look back you can see the perfect work will of God sometimes you can't see it in front of you but you can look back and see that you've been walking with him all the time now God wants to interpret his word in your life he's got a vision for you now we get glimpses we get glimpses of Heaven We Begin to realize our true value of how important that we are you're worth 10 million worlds am now I want to drop something right here here now you're worth 10 million Worlds the person beside of you is also worth 10 million Worlds the quicker you can understand that the more respect you will have for one another go ahead and Shout right there so as a Ministry I have to understand I'm not here to beat you God won't let me be your Holy Ghost that's right and I'm not going to be nosy in your business amen but neither do I want you nosy in mine brother Ron should I should I buy a red car should I buy a Corvette oh yeah Jordan I wish I had a hundred of you should I buy this house should I I'm not your holy ghosten I will pray with you I will pray with you but I'm not your Holy Ghost now not only is God dealing with you as a gentile bride but he's also Gathering a people and instill in operation that he's getting ready to turn from from Gentile to Jew well brother Ron can you give me some idea of what is going on in the earth in the past months he is turning from Gentile to Jew which means it's time for you to go home but listen the spirits overlap and you are seeing pre-tribulation a anointing that is on the Earth today there I'm going to say some strong things now there's not a president or one in front of us that can stop the wheels of Prophecy or the spirit that has been Unleashed there's been a war since the beginning of time in the middle least Israel will have to fight till the last day for her boundaries and Nations will rise against her with not just a sentiment to take a couple hundred yards back but they want to drive her into the sea they want to destroy her they did it in Egypt they did it when Jesus was here and listen Hitler did his best to kill every one of them that he could but God preserves his seed and I want to say this you I don't care what your political s situation is Israel will not lose now I may get in trouble with the next two minutes but let me just say this to you don't get your flags out about the Palestinians they're Canon father they're Canon father but a lot of other nations are Canon father and the spirit that's anointing against the Jews in America and all over the world is preparing for for the final battle and I would just say this to you if I was the president everybody just doing all of that all of that nonsense that they're doing and send them over there to Palestine just send them over there brother Ron that's pretty strong in the same sentence that they're hating the Jews they're hating Americans that's right and if you're not listening you you you got to wake up because all of these signs is telling us listen it's not a flesh and blood Affair it's it's not a flesh and blood Affair you know you can just make a couple mentions and you can feel the heat why because we're getting ready to leave and just as much as Israel is having to fight for her boundaries the Bride of Jesus Christ is having to fight for hers listen I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I will not back up I will not turn around I will not take my banner down I believe this message with all of my heart this message has prepared [Applause] us why are you saying these things and I'm just about I'm just about come to end of my CL block I kind of feel like brother Brandon with Billy Paul getting ready to come and pull him off the stage brother Homer long for these days days men of God longed for these days where we can see it can happen any day I I want to talk real straight to you now just like they did when the token the death angel was passing Moses instructed them to eat the lamb with your feet shod get ready we're leaving have yourself dressed we're leaving we're going to leave this is this is no practice whatever you have to take with you have it packed you're going to leave this house you're going to leave this slavery you're going to leave yes we've been prosperous here here in Goan we've been prosperous God's GI us good land we've worked we've built pids we've did all of those things but yes we've been beat by every Tormentor of hell but you get your house ready you tell your children the blood's on the door the death angel is going to pass but we've applied the token we're sensitive to what God is doing now we're going to church these may be the last Services you tell your children that just any day we're going to see dead Saints raised we're going to see your mom we're going to see your paa and there's a reason they've got to come back to us so we can meet him [Applause] and let's just be real responsible right here not everybody's going to see dead Saints and you begin to testify I'm seeing so and so and I'm seeing so and so isn't incredible isn't incredible an incredible what's going on and there's going to be people right around you because they have not prepared listen we just got to be real here amen we we're not a bunch of Ubers where we pick up all the strangers it's the elected Lady it's a chosen ones they're good people Rich Young Ruler were good people I got a lot of good friends and listen I pray that God will take care of it at the great judgment but the Rapture is for an elected lady why are you saying these things strong brother Ron if you're not in if you hadn't made preparations if you're still riding to [Applause] fence this ain't no time to stand outside the ark and wait on the rain [Applause] I got questions brother Ron let God settle it if you don't do devotions if you don't pray if you don't spend time with God if you don't listen to the message of the hour if you don't take time to get yourself ready let me just say you're not going to get ready going up in the air now let me just finish this it's okay be ready there's not going to be one backslider in the Rapture there's not going to be one liar there's not going to be one drunkard straight from Brother brandom there's not going to be one Bob hered brother R said the reason for the 40 days here 30 to 40 days as you can look around and see who made it and who didn't make it so that when he comes all of our eyes will be on him brother brandham said the first man that he wanted to shake hands with was Uriah and he had great thought about what Uriah was a gentile fighting for the king a gentile Uriah was steadfast that was the first man he wanted to shake hands with I would say God granted granted that I can't wait to shake hands with brother Brandon I I just can't I can't wait but more more than anything I want to see Jesus more than anything I want to see him is that your desire is
