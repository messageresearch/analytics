waiting until next week to Saturday and Friday to start praying for it you should be praying for it already that the Lord anoint these ministers are coming in Lord that feed our souls that's what we that's what we want and we're not here to be seen or if the church packs up if a visitor don't come I I I'm looking for that for myself so that's what we should be praying for so um one quick uh announcement they have some extra T-shirts if anybody's interested in them you can see uh sister Carly or sister Charlene after church or before church so um just another thing I just want to say about Monday I want to thank everybody thank everybody for a great great turnout I mean you can't do you couldn't do this I mean we could but man when you got plenty of help and I know everybody can't be here I know people's got to work brother Shannon's got to work I know I just called him out but I know other people's got to work you got other appointments you know I mean if we try to schedule it when everybody could be here we never would get it scheduled so but I'm so proud of these young guys that showed up hey I'd start that's the Next Generation here at the church that takes over here you know I mean I'm just I mean so you know you know brother Branham says make a comment says that you know you go into the church and watch them watch the pastor way he acts you know you'll see the way the people Acts you know we've just caught the spirit of the preachers for the last 50 years they work we work I mean that's the way we do around here you know that's just I mean that's just you know that if you want to see where it's at that's in uh 10 24 50 uh forward the unpardoned sins so you can look it up but we just caught the spirit of our pastors here for the last 50 years we talked about the 50-year Jubilee coming for the last 50 years our pastors had showed us how to work sort of like Andrew said you know about that woman going down there and said she got the holy ghost at church and he said you didn't get it here well if you lazy you didn't get it here just some reminders for the Revival I think we you know we could be crowded we might not be but if you come to make sure if you want your seat you need to come here early we're not saving seats for nobody and then if you get here two hours early and you walk outside for an hour and a half we're not intentionally giving you seat up but you could lose it the only seats we're saving is for the musicians and the people Thomas TJ whoever's parking and doing that we will try to save their seats and it has been a thing I I gave sister Deborah Watson she'd seen a few years ago was accident I didn't intentionally do it but somebody came in and I gave her I mean it happens we're not doing it intentionally but please don't if you come here and don't put stuff out on your seat just come in and read your Bible pray get ready for the service that's what we're here for not not to you know that's just be respectful come in sit down don't be moving around talking and we're not you know we just want to try to do the right things while we're there too the services starts Friday at at six seven Saturday at six Sunday at 11. got it seven six eleven not ten two four okay so you know so if we come in see I mean I use Isaac Zoe they don't need two cheers I mean if we get crowded we don't they don't need two chairs to sit in so you know Anna and Doug they only sitting in a chair and a half now so I mean so so so I mean so we don't we're not we're not we're not we don't want it we're trying to save on many seats as we can I mean prime example brother Williams boys I mean they don't need three chairs they can sit probably on two chairs you know I'm just just using it for example so if if you can if we get crowded and we need we're just trying to make sure that we can make sure that we got everybody um so just another reminder too about the nursery the nursery downstairs is for the Sisters the upstairs is for the brothers also keep in mind Brothers tried to keep your babies uh under control when they're in there some of the older ones don't let them be running around because someone with infants are trying to get their kid to go back to sleep or try to get them calm down so that they want to come back out so they can be in the service they don't want to be sitting back in two buck two uh the services coming or they want to they want to be out here where where the stuff is going on so they don't they want to they want to feel the same thing you feel it so so if you got kids try to if they're in that Nursery if they get if they are older kids and they get to acting up I mean you can always take them outside and take them to the car until they get calm down to try not to be running in and out just be respectful to everybody that's around you uh we also as we typically do we handing out snack bags usually one night so just a reminder don't be bringing it back into the sanctuary or the vest of you just don't bring nothing back into the church you know this is not a place to eat this is you know if you if your kids need to eat I mean most of them if they get on up in age we shouldn't be they shouldn't be needing to eat anything I'm not talking about infants or smaller kids talk about older kids just try to respect the house of the Lord as as it's not the place you know it talks about that in First Corinthians 11. you know you got homes to eat in not church to eat in so um and just make sure you watch your kids I mean it's tight outside the parents it's it's your responsibility to keep up with your kids now we're heading to some tough stuff here so hang on and pray for me here so um so talking and moving around as we come into the sanctuary best of you please please be respectful I mean not just tonight tomorrow night next week it should be every time I mean as you come in you know we got we got an ice porch you can stand there and talk to and probably the people that you're talking to you've talked to all week long you text them all week long it's not that important that you need to walk around and and talk to them it's just we're trying to keep the spirit in right we don't want to do nothing to hinder the spirit so so just just come into the sanctuary get your Bibles read pray and get and get your mind upon the Lord so so saying that too is so so I I I'm pretty sure that they will be showing the video of maybe some stuff over the last 50 years so you know we're just trying to make make sure you know that that if you see my great great uncle Elmore up there that was there 49 years ago he didn't got to say oh there's Uncle Elmore I mean because 99 of people in here don't know my great uncle I've just used that for example I don't have a married uncle but I mean so if you see if you see if you see brother Homer up there you can say oh there's brother Homer I mean if if they was needing a public address announcer or a commentator they would have asked you to feel me to do that on the film here so please please eliminate your comments not only during this video but anytime you know so we're just trying to I mean it people people don't want to hear you know everybody's comments you want to say Amen praise the Lord jump up down and Shout that's fine but we don't need to be making comments about stuff all the time it's just not the right thing to do um so so just just I want to make sure that we're we're coming under right spirit and do the right things as we do that also after churches or anytime if you if you need to see or talk to brother Arnold please see one of the deacons afterwards or before and and tell them what you want to see him about or talk to him about because after they get up here and they pour their heart out and and you know even even the brother Ronaldo in the conditions that he's got I mean he gets weak there's just not the right time to be asking if he if it's something that you need to talk to one of the deacons and we can always tell you yay or nay or well I asked them or something but just just don't come back and just want to see her talk to them because you can always text text Brother Andrew that's the guy that you need to text text Brother Andrew and on Monday and ask him what you need to ask him or talk to him if it's if it's real important you know you can always talk to one of the deacons and we'll get you in the right direction and so if you don't know who the deacons and the trustees are I mean not deacons and the ushers if the deacons and ushers would stand that way you know who you can go to to take you any of your comments or directions to you okay all right so there there you go so getting down about wrapping this up here so two things here always always especially young people listen we will always want to try to find something positive and take out every service we always don't don't go looking for negative stuff always try to try to always find something that's positive in the service and take it out of and feed on and then the last thing do the right things for it's the right things to do love you [Applause] amen let's stand we prepare to receive The Season's offering sing you ask me why I'm happy you ask me why I'm happy so I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone and when I beat the scoffers who ask me where they are well I say my sins are gone they're underneath the blood of the Cross of Calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness it's good enough for me praise God my sins are gone it was at the old time altar where God came in my heart amen my sins are gone well the Lord took four possession well they're underneath the blood crossword [Music] in the sea of God's forgetfulness

blessing under thy kingdom we love you and appreciate you and the Lord Jesus Christ amen and God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the book of Isaiah in chapter 28 Isaiah chapter 28 a few scripture readings here tonight that we want to partake of and just want to make an announcement for you for tomorrow um and even those that are that are streaming in in the area but tomorrow uh the Lord's placed it on our heart to to have a prayer line after after brother Ron speaks tomorrow evening tomorrow uh tomorrow morning and so we just want you to come in prayer and expectation um we don't know how exactly the meeting will fill out and so we want to give our people a chance to to if you desire prayer to come and to walk through this line tomorrow so us Brothers have been preparing our hearts and you know sanctifying our lives Lord for for the Lord to come and do do things and if you would desire prayer we we will open that up for you tomorrow so we don't know how exactly Labor Day will fill out and then Brothers desire to have prayer we'll move chairs to to make things happen so you know we we just know God can reach down and touch you wherever you are amen amen in Isaiah chapter 28 and verse 10 and we're going to look down to Acts chapter 3 after that and then also Revelations chapter six amen Isaiah chapter 28 and verse 10. for precept must be upon precept precept on precept line upon line line up online and hear a little and they're a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear Acts chapter 3 and verse 19. Acts chapter 3 and verse 19. the Bible says here repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord I want you to pay very close attention where this refreshing is coming from it's coming from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive unto the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began also Revelations chapter 6 and verse 5. foreign Revelations chapter 6 and verse 5. and the Bible said in and when he had opened the third seal and I heard the third Beast say come and see and I'll be held and lower Black Horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you a thought that that the Lord's been dealing with me on I've been I've been studying over these things and preparing our hearts for for these meetings but tonight I'd like to take a thought and the Lord's been dealing with me even in the back office just placing these things together but I'd like to speak to you tonight on the Dynamics is the refreshing from the Lord the Dynamics is the refreshing and we realize as the Church of the Living God that we are living in a very special hour We're living here where we're watching the very manifestations of the the Bible come into coming to pass right in here right in our lives not just something that we could say that we would see back in days gone by but we are watching the very word of the Living God come into action right into our brothers and our sisters people that we have fellowshipped with people that we have known for our lives but what we are watching is an infusion of power to the body of Jesus Christ and we recognize that the brother Brandon would say these things he said now he said this is not Wesley's day it's not Luther's day he said but he said even this is not even the restoration of gifts he said but this is a bride time this is the astronaut age you would say it's the Golden Age It's the bride's time it's the bride age and we recognize as a Church of the Living God that we're living in such a special spot that people have never under throughout 6 000 years Humanity has never lived in the place that they're living in and even we sitting here as Believers of the message of the hour we recognize that we're setting in such a very special spot because we we understand but yet there's been a progression of faith and a progression of Revelation that we we have never been where we've been sitting at in this hour that we're living in and I'll just say it like this is that the body of Jesus Christ has had everything that that was on her that was laid back there throughout all those Church ages everything that has been on the Church of the Living God has been released so the body can soar into the heavenlies like never before and I'll say that that what the prophet would tell us is that that what the seals did it ripped the restraining powers of Satan off of the body of Jesus Christ and it's a wonderful thing to know that we're not just looking for for prophecy or we're not just sitting here looking at prophecy but we're sitting here and we're looking at the realities of the word of God and I think it's an amazing time to to recognize that the time that is at hand that John was looking at is that we are there right now now brother Brandon would say this in the third seal he said when I see that God promised to do a certain thing in this day when he promised to break off these seals in this last day he said you don't know the joy the glory when I see him reveal this and stand there and watch it happen and he said and know that I'll take any person to charge he never did say one thing to us but what happened that way and then to see the joy that's in my heart when I see his promise for this last day as he promised to do it as I hear and hear I see it Vindicated to me perfectly right he said you hear me say I feel religious he said oh he said that's what's the matter the stimulation is so bad that I just I'm just about ready to go to cutting up you know stimulation from Revelation so so we stimulated in his heart because of the Revelation he said they become so stimulated talking about the book of Acts and over the Revelation that they'd Vindicated the promise they become so stimulated over the Revelation that they've Vindicated the promise you see when you recognize your portion of scripture that you are the people that is there to vindicate the promise of the hour it'll cause a stimulation to break out he said he said they become so stimulated over the Revelation that they've indicated the promise now oh my they broke out the joy of stimulation till people said that they were drunk on new wine he said when God revealed his promise to them and not only did it reveal it to them but he proved it he didn't just reveal it to him but he proved it and he said that's what I've always said a man can say anything he can just he's just apt to say anything he said but when God comes around and vindicates that you see this age that brother Brandon would tell us in in in God of the evil age he said we find that this evil age is to prove to Satan that she is not like Eve she's not that type of woman so God caused this age to prove to Satan that you're not that kind of a woman William Brandon would say that you have been predestinated not to fall you have been predestinated not to fail you are not that kind of woman you don't have that kind of give up on the inside of you you don't have that kind of failing mentality on the inside of you but where we are as a Church of the Living God we recognize that this is the hour of the manifestations of the Son of God and brother Brandon would tell us in the adoption series he said there's coming a time when the power of God will walk out there and take every Power away from Satan and I want you to know this that God has Vindicated that that that quote right there over and over and over again Paul would say that our gospel came not unto you in word only but it came into you power and it came in demonstrations what happened down there with Georgie Carter there was a man of God that walked out there and took every Power away from Satan what happened out there with Congress and Upshaw when he'd been an invalid for 66 years there was a Son of God that had a vision and by the vision of the Lord there was a man that stood there he wasn't crippled in all of his conditions he was crippled up sitting there in a wheelchair but yet there was a man that had a vision and it took the very every Power away from Satan I'll say this that there is a people in the land who under their Messenger will will be the final voice to the final age and it's not it's not something that is above us it is something that is in the Church of the Living God and that is exactly what is happening right here right now in the hour of restoration it is a people that are taking the very power away from Satan what is it it is the refreshing of the Dynamics you see throughout all the ages they have the mechanics of it but now there is there is a octane power there is a spark that is upon that that is upon the Dynamics that is upon the mechanics that everything that has been laying there is going to be made full proof I want you to know there's not one scripture that is to this Gentile bride that she doesn't have access to there's not one power that is with restrained from the Church of the Living God there's not one joy that this bride cannot have there's not one shout there's not one stimulation there's not one Revelation that is given to the Church of the Living God under Malachi 4 that she cannot attain and she can press her way into that I know it's a battle to get there but it's worth the fight to get to a spot that you can do all things are possible to them that believe you've got to really fight for it you've got to press the battle but I really believe that this is a worthy cause I believe it's a word they call suppression to the refreshing of the Dynamics of the Lord I'll tell you I'll tell you that laodicea has so many things that it Stacks up against us that so many politics and so many so many dynamics of the world that that mess up your mind sometimes I tell you we need a refreshing we need a refreshing from the Lord you wake up in the morning and we had rain for quite some time but you walk out there and there's Dew out there on that grass what is it it's a refreshing upon that seed even though it's been lacking moisture for some time it's that do that is keeping it and it's in its state of greenness and maybe you've been in a spot where you've been dry and you got cold and you got stale but let the drew the Dew drops of Mercy fall upon your heart and renew the very Spirit of your soul I believe that it's worth setting out there in a time of Peace that's what William Bynum would say he said if you're going to have a refreshing you've got to get to a time where it's peace you've got to get to a time of Peace he said when does the Dew Drop it drops at the Midnight Hour and that's where the Church of the Living God is we are in the hour where we are asking for a refreshing from the presence of the Lord Brother Adam said you can't go around stewing and fussing and worrying about life you'll never get a refreshing that way he said but oh if you can just get under the presence of the Living God if you know you ever had them kind of weeks when every every devil in Hell's been gunning for you but what you really need is a refreshing from the Lord you remember Sister Morgan sister Margie Morgan that had been diagnosed with cancer and the doctors had said that that took cancer was wrapped around her wrapped around her intestines like a roots of a tree that were wrapped around her mother Madam said she was sitting out there in that stale condition he said but we brought her in there behind the veil he said we brought her in there behind into the presence who to the refreshing to the refreshing and brought her in there behind the veil he said we dropped the curtain down behind her he said and behind there you don't care what the doctor says no matter what anybody else says the veil dropped and shut off every unbeliever then she reached into that golden pot of God and said by his trumps I am healed and she started eating from that golden pot and if you've not been to a spot where you're where you're living in a spot where where the rest of the world has got your mind got you and this one person can upset your whole entire week I'd say it's time to let the veil drop behind you if one person can mess up your week you need to get rid of that person if one person can take away your spiritual attitude walk away from them and leave them where they are because behind the veil it's a soundproof room and if you can ever get back Claire under the presence of the Shekinah Glory you don't care what the doctor says you don't care what the criticism comes you're back there under the presence of the Living God what is it that atmosphere that's been created for a people to walk back in there where they know they are in the presence of el shadiah and I believe that it's a wonderful thing tonight that you don't have to guess and who guess whose presence that you're in you're not in the presence of a politician tonight you're not in the presence of an intellectual giant but you are in the presence of The Great I Am it's a wonderful thing the brother Brandon would teach us brother Brandon would teach us that an atmosphere has got to be created for the presence of the Lord he said it's the hardest thing to do is to get Believers in that kind of atmosphere he said but all if the atmosphere can get right he said there'll be another repeat of Pentecost that takes place what is an atmosphere it's a condition where the seed can grow you see if you've got all the elements you've got the seed you got the dirt what do you need you need the conditions to be right you see because if you don't have the conditions right the effects won't be upon the seed but oh if you can ever get that kind of atmosphere oh if you can ever get that kind of atmosphere but that's what William Brandon would say he said he said now he said he said you go back there and you look in there when Jesus said when he said to them those people that were worship Him worshiping him he said in vain you do worship me by your Traditions you've made the word of God no effect so he said he said if I taught you a Methodist message he wouldn't take no effect upon you why because you're not under a Methodist message he said oh if Moses would have took Noah's message he would have never had any effect he said if Jesus Took Moses's message he would have never took no effect because his seed was predestinated for a certain kind of water you see you cannot put Pentecostalism upon the body of Jesus Christ because that's not the kind of water that we are under but we are under this fresh Pentecostal drink all the way back to the book of Acts and I'll say this it's worth the fight to get there now notice what the Bible said in Ephesians 6 and 10 it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might now watch what the passing translation says now my beloved ones I have saved these most important truths to the last be supernaturally infused with strength through your life Union with the Lord Jesus stand Victorious with the force of explosive power flowing in and through you so you see if you get outside of this message there is no power for you lock it or lump it if you get outside of this message you say well I'm going back to my Bible and I'm going back to this if you get outside of this message there is no power outside of this message you might be able to have healing you might be able to have Miracles but you will never have an overcoming life outside of this message because what you are under is a restoration message and because there is a restoration it's a people hallelujah it's a people that are here under restoration hour that's giving them the power to overcome every day for I'll tell you what this message will produce it'll produce a body that looks exactly like the head and I'll tell you what this message will do it'll settle every debate of Satan it'll conquer every formidable power that comes against the Church of the Living God oh that's what we need we need a refreshing from the Lord now notice we realize we realize when we look into Revelation chapter 6 that we see at the breaking of this third seal that they are the Beast which say come and see notice it wasn't the lamb but it was a beast that said come and see and when John went and looked over there to see it what did he see he saw it in symbol form but when you see the lamb breaking the seal in this hour what is it the bride doesn't see a symbol but she sees what is rightfully revealed to the Church of the Living God so you see we recognize that there was that Antichrist spirit that was riding out in the first stage and he rode on through and he changed his ministries into the red horse we watched it and he changed to the Black Horse and what it is it's the Antichrist brother Brandon would tell us he said now it's the same it's the same writer all the time it's the same one riding out there notice how he came in the first in the first stage what did he do he came out there and it looked so so close that's why Jesus would say in Matthew 24 and 24 that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible now notice they are all the way back there in the first stages of the ministry they are that Antichrist was working right amongst the church he was so close and there he came in there with his Antichrist doctrines and he was trying to make them disbelieve just like he did Eve make her fall by one word but notice notice what that writer does he changes his ministry he changes from light to red from red to Black from black to pale what is it it's the same writer and you see what was writing that black horse was riding down through the Dark Ages that's what he was going out there he was riding in those times it was a time where it was midnight to the True Believers that was left there because it was only a little number she only had a little bit of strength but there was a little bit of light for them believers but you see what that what that Antichrist Spirit was doing he was riding out there and he was trying to smother the very life right out of the church let me tell you something the Antichrist is still working in this hour he doesn't really care he doesn't really care if you Shout Scream and get emotional but you ever get into a place where the token of the Holy Ghost is that's what he's trying to do he's trying to smother the very life out of the Church of the Living God because Satan knows if you got the goods or whether you don't you can boo who cry wash your makeup off by your tears but it doesn't do any good unless you got the life and what was this Antichrist Spirit trying to do he was trying to smother the very life right out of the Dark Ages what did he do he left them with no hope he left them there all their Hope was gone but notice what the Bible would say a measure a measure a week for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny what was it it was there that Antichrist under the Catholicism therefore there he was charging people he was charging people for hope he was charging them saying that this is the only way that you're going to ever see your see your young your old you're the people that have passed on he was charging them what was he charging them for he was charging them for the wheat and for the barley which is a part of the Natural Life of partaking of it you see these people were living in an hour where there was no hope there was no hope all their Hope was gone and here Satan was charging them and making them think that this was the only way that you could have hope ain't that exactly how the devil does you say oh just take a little bit of social drink here and I'll give you a little bit of happiness he's charging you he's charging you for your happiness what does he say to you just shake the preacher's hand and you're in it and yours could eternally secure just sign your name here what is it that's that same Antichrist writer trying to give you hope trying to give you hope in some other way which God did not permit before the foundation of the world but God did not leave them in the condition that he found them what is it the lamb screamed out what was it it was not the Beast it was the lamb that's creamed out don't you hurt my wine don't you hurt my oil yeah it's just a little bit there but don't you touch it don't you touch it it was not the voice of the Beast it was the voice of the Lamb what's speaking in this generation and saying Satan take your hands off of God's Property it's a lamb what's being Advanced what's being Advanced right now it's the Church of the Living God with the lamb that's leading her all the way let me tell you you can't find no hope out there until they ought to see you but there is hope in this lamb there is hope in this lamb There Is Power [Applause] I want to do the lamb cried out right amongst them don't hurt the line and the oil that's right don't you heard it boy or you're going to have to pay for it you know good and well by studying the message you know what the oil represents it represents the Holy Ghost and you know about you know by the preaching of this message you know what wine represents it's Revelation it's stimulation by Revelation and maybe you're sitting here tonight and you don't understand the importance of Revelation but brother Brandon would tell us the the importance of Revelation can never be overemphasized to the believer he said Revelation means more to you than even what you even realize tonight you see well I just well I don't really know about any Revelations he did any deep Revelations that I got brother Andrew are you sitting here as a Believer you got faith here tonight brother would tell us that faith is a revelation but what was it here this Revelation was give to a people to overcome in the worst of times when there was no hope there was still hope what did Abraham do against hope he believed in Hope come on you going through some tough times in the last little bit but against hope you're still here against criticism you're still here against problems is still here well Glory that's what the Bible told on Moses told us he said the secret things belong to the Lord but the things that have been revealed to us belong to me and if I know it's got my name on let me tell you if I know George got my name on it and praise has got my name on it and Revelations got my name on it and peace has got my name on it there's some be the devil that tries to take it away from me what is it it's a revelation what do you worked up about brother Andrew it's a revelation it's the Revelation it's the Revelation that'll take you higher it's well we need somebody's ideas we don't need nobody's ideas we got the greatest Revelation that there ever has been and every devil can't stop the church from moving higher in the Realms of Jesus Christ this is not the days of horse and Buggies this is not the days of airplanes this is an astronaut age and you have been tossed by the Revelation stimulate it come on somebody you ain't sitting here you ain't sitting here with race car fuel you've got rocket fuel in you you got rock and fuel in you that's why you can believe like you believe [Applause] well Glory well Glory what's Revelation what's revelation mean it means wine well I ain't never been too much of a wino but I do know this I do know this that wine was not meant to stay in bottles never did have much of taste for that kind of stuff but I do know this that it it wasn't just set there so that it could stay up on the Shelf the gifts of the Holy Ghost were not given to the Church of the Living God so that they could set up there in the shelf and say we don't need those things no more yes I believe there's a diversity of gifts but if we want a perfect Church to be edified by us God has got gifts start trying to put the wine upon the shelf and say man ain't it pretty man ain't it beautiful man it's got the oldest date on it let me tell you it's time you pop the cork it's time you pull it down off the shelf start with the lowest gift start speaking in tongues start with interpretation start with wisdom start with faith start with knowledge [Applause] pull them off the shelf don't look at the sticker don't look at the date I say that there's some people around the message that have never pulled the bottle of the shelf and drank of the Holy Ghost [Applause] all right hello now come on now that's why that's what William Brandon would tell us in the unveiling of Christ he said what is it we went all the way back in there tapped in Hebrews walked all the way back in there into the Book of Joel and found out that in the last days I will pour out my spirit what's brother random do he starts breaking into the Greek he starts breaking into the Greek and he starts telling us of things that a hillbilly Kentuckian should know about but there was an angel that was pointing these things out he said in the last days what is it kenosis I will empty myself I will pour out myself well what is he doing brother Andrew he's pouring himself he's pouring the revelation of himself right into the church well if you got him you got everything right if you got him you got everything right notice what the announcement of the Lamb was don't touch it don't hurt it don't afflict it don't say one thing about it now let me tell you something a natural lamb may not be who you want on your side but this lamb Islam fought for you this lamb thought that you was worthy this lamb thought that you was worth dying for this lamb thought that he could put the cross upon his back and carry it for you I'd say that this lamb is worth following come on now you can get upset about there and stay back here in your sin all you want to but you need this lamb and this lamb is announcing to all of hell they don't touch my Revelation don't touch my holy ghost power come on now don't touch it don't hinder it the lamb is showing don't you Hut don't you touch a holy ghost don't you try to explain away the Dynamics of the Revelation if you do Satan you're going to pay for it man you say brother Andrew I'm afraid if I if I start shouting or if I start dancing I'll get in the flesh how'd you get in the building come on now how'd you get in the building it took your whole flesh to come walk in here and put yourself down in a Pew it took your flesh to get in here it took the song leader in the flesh to start singing some songs and it broke into a round he was doing it in the flesh then all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord got to work it don't you worry about your flesh your flesh will get out of the way thank you well I'm worried about it brother Andrew I'm really worried about it okay he said now notice where he says this at in the fourth seal I know now I know there's a lot of fanaticism and people carrying on no sometimes they do it when they do it when the music is jumping and jumping that music is jumping up and down and everything I know that goes and I believe that too but I've seen people in the day when as long as the music's playing everybody was jumping and screaming but when the music stopped it stopped you see brother Andrew that's exactly what I'm scared of I'm afraid if all of a sudden brother Andrew or brother Matthew changed his song I'm afraid that I'll just I'll just be in the flesh do you want to hear what your Prophet said he said but I've seen people in the day as long as the music's playing everybody was jumping and screaming but when the music stopped stop well that's still all right as far as I'm concerned you see as long as people lives right let me tell you something as long as you got the goods as long as you got the token as long as you got the person of Christ You Can Dance anytime you want to you can shout anytime you want to you can scream anytime you want to if you got the life to back up the message don't you be ashamed don't you be afraid brother Brandon said oh we believe in heartfelt religion we believe in the people's Liberty to be able to say Amen to the word of God he said the holy spirit will never lead you to do anything wrong and if he's leading you Jehovah is going to lead you all the way well I'm working on a building I'm working on a building I'm working on a building for my lord for my lord it's a holy ghost build head it's a holy ghost well what are you talking about brother Andrew that's exactly what William Branham said in stature to a perfect man Christ didn't send me down here to build some institution he sent me to build powerhouses and almighty God I believe we ought to be powerhouses of joy now you can have your seats notice what brother random said about the Dynamics he said the mechanics he said there's so many people trying to explain the mechanics he said the only thing he said you know the only thing you should know he said the mechanics is known he said but what if somebody would have said Noah I want you to explain the mechanics how of how the ark's going to float he didn't do it you don't have to know the mechanics just the Dynamics of it the Dynamics is what you want to know well if somebody come up to Israel and said say Moses I want to understand how you could create create animals with your own word he said it ain't my word it's God's word he told me how to do it how them squirrels get created how to write Sons get to the place that they were at it ain't for me to explain it all it is for me to believe come on now again he would say I believe the bride of Christ is called I believe that she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is here they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into the glory into the Rapture I believe it with all my heart see we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is he is he is the Dynamics say it to your neighbor he is the Dynamics the Dynamics is the refreshing he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us again he'd say the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit I believe that takes every question on what the Dynamics is the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit Well brother Angel I don't know if I can believe that or not I don't believe that you're believing the message well the Dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the Holy Spirit he said but when that head and that body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the Day of the Dead that's in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight into the skies the Dynamics is the holy spirit again he would say I don't know the mechanics just the Dynamics is all that I'm interested in I don't know how he does it but he does it because he promised it again he would say there's been churches churches Brides brides but there's got to come on Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride there must come one one that's not only one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live and move in the power of those Resurrection until we come to that place until we find the place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics in him no matter how much the mechanics prove to be Rock there's got to be a Dynamics to make it work he said that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word well explain it all brother Andrew let me say it like this Balaam made a prophecy that there was going to be a star that would rise out of Jacob and there would be a scepter that would ride out rise out of Israel it was 1500 years before the them wise men ever seen that star but they was expecting it they was looking for it and you may not know how the Holy Ghost is going to come by your way but just be looking for it [Applause] don't you give up on it well I've been sitting here 50 years and I never got anything shame on you shame on you I don't know what the message is shame on you when you've been given every Power every gift every access to what the message is I'll tell you what it is it's Satan that's trying to keep you away from the Dynamics you watch right now other over every single thing Satan is trying to keep the Church of the Living God away from the power why it's because Satan knows assuredly that the original Church of Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the church that Jesus claims as his own he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works that she will be an invincible Army if they ever get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her Satan knows this so Satan's trying to keep the revelation of Christ away from you Satan knows is it all right if I do this for a minute Satan knows you'll be an invincible Army Satan knows that you are certainly the Mark 16 Church in action Satan knows then the bottomless pit is ready for him Satan knows he's lost the battle Satan knows that his time has come Satan knows he's defeated tonight through the cross of Jesus Christ Satan knows that if you ever get into a spot where you recognize who you are that he has lost the battle I'd say take a look around Satan We Know Who We Are we know whom we have believed and I am persuaded that he's able to keep that which he's promised unto me and if he promised to me he's going to keep his word [Applause] what am I saying to you you got to know in whom he has to believe you know because God is calling not God is calling for separators and God is calling for believers in this hour because the Bible will tell us that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtained a good report so through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the very word of God so that the things which were seen were not made of things which do appear so we realize that without faith in God nothing is possible but we know this that with faith all things are possible because he that cometh to God must believe that he is you've got to believe that he's able you got to believe that he's a Healer you got to believe that he's a promise keeper and if you do believe he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him you see what that faith is brother random will tell us that faith is the master of all circumstances the faith is the Revelation it's the master of all circumstances notice Lord help me and y'all forgive me but notice he said what that all symbolizes is a Holy Spirit then we find out that oil and wine is always connected in worship you can't go throughout the Bible without finding the oil and the wine connected together he said it's always connected in worship and the wine he said which come to me he said that wine symbolizes that it was the power it was the power of the stimulation by Revelation and he said that's when a something has been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer it's like you grabbing a hold of Isaiah chapter 53. you see if you ever grab a hold of that Revelation and it becomes a stimulation to your heart there's not one devil in hell that can keep you away from your healing if it's been personally revealed to you because it gives you a stimulation because it's been presented by Revelation it's something that God has said it's a mystery it's a mystery but they can't understand it but after a while God becomes back and reveals it and then he vindicates it well I'm going to need some examples here brother Andrew how did you get in the building brother Timmy Batten it was because God dropped her faith in your heart that this is where you needed to be at and because a man followed his heart and followed the leadering of the Lord look at his children now well I could call any of your names here tonight how'd you get in the building how'd you get where you are as a Believer it's because something was revealed to you that you can believe I'll tell you that I'll tell you like this brother Brandon was dealing with a patient one time and he's dealing with her and he's dealing with him and he says he said that shocked you didn't it it shocked you how much Faith you had if brother Branham closed this individual out that's sitting out there calls him out tells him everything about he said it shocked you how much Faith you got it might shock you how much you actually believe tonight if you'd have enough Faith to say Lord here I am I'm reaching out my hands Jarius one of these days you got to take a walk you got to leave your old traditions you got to leave your uncle you got to leave all your Sadducees behind and start taking a walk what happened with John Ryan out there what happened with him he comes through the prayer line brother Brandon prayed for him and said you're healed it wasn't he wasn't he wasn't seeing anything he was still blind he was still blind and he made his way back in the prayer line so brother Adam you told me I was healed he said you told me you believed well brother Andrew I ain't seen what I asked for coming to fruition yet you told me you believed it and when it stopped down to his heart that when he was already healed before he ever seen the miracle before he ever seen the miracle he recognized that he was healed how'd he recognize it he was blind he couldn't see it but he understood it by revelation well I don't know how my loved one's going to get in here but I understand it by Revelation that God is the god of impossibilities [Applause] well come on somebody John Ryan didn't stop there brother Brandon said he would sit there and he'd interrupt the meeting said praise the Lord I'm Healed praise the Lord I'm Healed I'd say it sometime in your life you're going to have to interrupt Satan's plans and start praising God for the Revelation whether you see it or whether you don't extra extra I'm Healed telling my brother about it I'm Healed telling my sister about it I'm Healed selling newspapers I'm Healed I'm sitting in a barber's chair I'm Healed but Revelation struck the faith of John Ryan and he ran down the street [Applause] well would you not run down the street if your eyes come open well that's a reason I'm running like I'm running I got my eyes on the prize I know in who my half believes I got every reason to shout it's been revealed to me [Applause] well come on somebody you might as well [Applause] what's Shannon been praising the Lord about his son ain't even made it in the building but God has never discounted his faith he never asked him do you believe me he didn't question his faith he kept acting on it he kept believing it whether he seated or whether he didn't [Applause] what are you doing I'm acting on my faith I believe in it [Applause] what is this brother Andrew it's the refreshing of the Dynamics [Applause] one these days you're going to praise before you see it some of these days you want to shout before you know it [Applause] well you better be careful brother Andrew you're going to cause a reproach on Jesus Christ thanking him for something that you ain't seen done yet how can I ever reproach the name of Jesus Christ when he died for every right of calvary he is not ashamed of my testimony he's not ashamed of me witnessing when I don't see it coming how about that woman with that issue of her stomach at times when the angel passed through her neighborhood her daughter said Mama you're bringing a reproach on the neighborhood but she kept on testifying [Applause] well what happened her faith stimulated a revelation that the angel passed by her neighborhood what is it God knows where to deliver the package at he knows who's going to thank him for it he knows who's going to praise him for it foreign when ten lepers were healed only one of them turned back well brother Andrew you too loud of a Preacher but that Bible says in Luke it tells us that one turn back and with a loud voice rejoiced about it [Applause] that's what God's coming back for God coming back for some Believers God's coming back that's what he said when the son of man comes again when we find Faith he'll look for some church he ain't looking for he ain't looking for some righteousness he's looking for faith he's looking for somebody that's willing to take him at his word somebody that's willing to confess somebody that's willing to believe somebody that's willing to act we say brother answer I prayed after prayer after prayer after prayer don't stop praying brother Andrew I don't know everything I've done and my daughters too ain't living right and my son ain't came back to the Lord I'm saying to you keep on praying keep on asking because one of these times you're gonna break into around come on now why don't you break into that world real quick [Applause] if Moses could call for flies if Moses could call for frogs and fleas and all of the all of the plagues under the Covenant of bulls and goats how much more as the people that are under the token I don't know if you hear what I'm saying tonight but the lamb is announcing Satan don't you touch that token don't you touch my heart oh glory be to God if Satan grabs a hold of you it's like him grabbing hold of Jesus Christ at the cross he lost his finger two thousand years ago and he recognizes that's the same power what happened what happened when Ron Spencer was laying in a coma for 17 days when the fire had burned him up but all of a sudden somebody under the faith of a Son of God walked in there and said today I'm going to talk to my friend 17 days 17 days laying there three days 36 hours brain dead who are you talking about I'm talking about a pastor that still preached behind this Pulpit every single Sunday but somebody had enough Faith to walk into a hospital room what did you what did Satan recognize in Tim Pruitt that day he recognized that was her same power that whipped him 2 000 years ago and I'll say this to the Church of the Living God Satan knows that's the same power that's the same anointing that's the same influence what are you saying brother answer all of Heaven is behind this Dynamics [Applause] well glory be to God what do you know what are you talking about brother I'm talking about a lamb that is speaking against Satan don't you touch it don't you touch it and Satan knows that before the foundation of the world Jesus Christ died for your sins before the foundation of the world they said oh boy if there is a Believer I hope you got your joy shoes on he said because when he saw the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he said God had put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life at the same time do you got your joy shoes on I saw my name that's all my name y'all don't even flying in your life it'll make you a miserable wretch if you if everything's good it's the greatest thing that there ever can be who wants to drive all the way across the United States but if you can ever fly and everything's perfect man it's great but if it ain't Lord are you sure you sent me we have but he ever get into a spot and they're making the last call they've been talking on them intercoms all that time and you ain't heard one word about your baggage being picked up and being don't you pick up nobody's baggage don't you stand there if you see an unsuspect an unexpecting bag and sitting there and it looks suspicious don't pick it up you didn't even hear it but if they say last call for Spencer one and two let me tell you you will drop everything you can hear it over all the crowds voices when he gets brother Lang you say it gets loud in here brother Andrew if he's calling your name you hear your name [Applause] [Music] let me tell you you're getting one of them spots you recognize when your name is called you drop everything you're doing you'll leave your Starbucks and you'll leave your bagel and you'll take off running why because you don't want to miss the trip and if you don't got the token on your life if you ain't got it paid for it it's time to take off running yeah Glory I don't pray that it ain't coming I don't believe that it ain't coming Abraham you've been walking with Elohim for a long time but keep on praying Keep On Believing keep on asking keep on knocking keep on seeking because Melchizedek is going to show up at your tent and when it shows up at your tent you're going to produce what you can't produce that's what brother Brandon said he said predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on the destiny so let me say it to you like this God's been waiting on you God's been waiting on you a prophet announced you were coming and ain't no devil in hell gonna stop you God said you was going to be here Rebecca borlavon and God's going to make sure that you get to your spot let me say it like William Branham said it you're the best sign that God's Got you're the best sign God's god well your best signs down why is it down it's because there's a man laying out there in a gutter Under the Influence why are you God's best son it's because you're under the influence of what's happened on the inside of this building them people out there in the world may never meet me but if they see you you are God's best sign Olympians I've never felt the presence of the Lord it's time you have a change if you said in this building and you can say that you never felt the presence of the Lord God is going to help you hold you accountable he ain't gonna hold me accountable ain't gonna hold me accountable because I've done everything within my power brother Ron and brother Homer for these past 50 years have done everything within the ministry's power to bring you to a place where you could feel the very presence of the Lord and if you have oh Lord if you could sit here and say you never felt the presence of the Lord it's time that you have a change if you can walk in here day after day weekend after weekend and still stay the same way it's time you come to an old passion old-fashioned Pentecostal Revival [Applause] what am I saying I'm looking at people out here that are under the influence of what's being sold in here what was that that little boy looked out there and seen what that man was under the influence that's why he was saying that was a sign out there these people and it was really disrupt Satan weekend after weekend and you still keep coming back for more what is it about y'all y'all must not be able to live right y'all poor people have to keep coming back here if you was a real Christian like me I only have to show up at the revivals Christian Christmas and Easter well I'm sorry I got I'm sorry you got a teacup and I got a great big pot it must just take a whole lot more Jesus for me than it does you you know Booth Cleburn one time he was over there in England he was over in England he was walking around he was he was trying to get to a certain place and he got to walk around there and brother by him said it was snowing it was freezing it was raining out there and it started he started walking around he walked around the city and all the streets with a with a police officer and he got to looking down there and they said there was an old drunk out there drunk out there laid out in the street said it was he was said it had been raining had been freezing out there and that man that drunk was froze through the street out there froze to the street and he said man ain't she going to do something ain't she gonna do something about that and said well I guess we'll we'll throw him in a jug down here we'll throw him down a drug taking he said well he said man he said if you don't take care of this guy he said if you don't take care of this guy he said he's going to freeze to death he's going to catch pneumonia he said that's what's wrong with y'all he said that's what's wrong with you you don't understand he said that man is so drunk every pour of his skin is full of whiskey he said he's so full of it there can't no cold get in him well if you get good and drunk one time if you get good and drunk on time if you get good and drunk one time there can't no code or lay out a seed get on the inside of you well I tell you what we ought to do we ought to send them down the pasture so and so and let him pet him back Pat him back give him some kind of intellectual idea so that he gets himself back up what you're going to do is give him a layout of sea and flu you're gonna kill him you can't get no code in that guy he's so full of the Holy Ghost every drop of him's got whiskey in him he said if you do take him down there to the Salvation Army he said you're going to kill him down there but brother random said that's what's the matter today we ought to get so drunk till our carcassists would be so full of the Holy Ghost until nothing else can perch in its way he said but the trouble of it is we don't get a good old-fashioned Pentecostal drunk let me ask her when's the last time you got sauced when's the last time he got so drunk on the holy ghost that one of these brothers and one of these sisters had to carry you out of here well I'm ashamed of it I'm afraid of it let me tell you I'm unashamed and I'm Unapologetic if you don't like my dance watch this foreign if you knew like I know if you grab the hold of the Holy Ghost like I got a hold of it you'd never let the bottle go but the bride has got both oil and wine she stimulated by the revelation of Malachi 4 that has taken her into a rapturing state [Applause] what does it do what does that natural stimulant do it takes a person that's all slumped down you take that person you forgive me but it's time that some people get a refreshing and all they can think about their job and all they can think about is their bills and all they can think about is her diagnosis just get drunk one time just get drunk one time trust me I understand them them unbelievers will clip that and say well brother Andrew said we need to go out there and get drunk don't worry I'll get the email with it in there but oh but all I'm talking about is getting so drunk that we have to carry you out like we have to carry sister Joey out carry sister Katie out Carrie sister Whitney out Terry Sister Crystal out well it's just the sisters down there getting drunk oh if you get drunk like we got brother Nathan drunk and we got brother Gabe drunk and we got brother Shannon drunk and brother Jordan drunk we might have to carry you out of here one of these times and I do believe that all things are possible [Applause] you got it in you you got it in you [Music] you're gonna have to keep asking for it you're gonna have to keep believing for it brother Andrew you're just trying to work them up oh no I'm not I'm trying to get them drunk because if they could get so drunk that every part of their body is full of the Holy Ghost the devil can't get in them the powers of hell can't get them depression can't get them anxiety can't get them it's time that you start shouting and start praising God there you go again brother Andrew tell him to shout before it comes that's exactly what they were doing up there in the upper room 120 of them was thanking God for the Holy Ghost before it ever got in her own and because they praise because they shouted God came down and filled them and took gussers and made them tongue talkers took men that couldn't live right and then they started talking right start dressing right I ain't working you up I'm trying to tell you who you are [Applause] well Andrew do you know what you're doing I absolutely do know what I'm doing because before I preach any service I said God let me have the right spirit well you know what God told me to tell you it's time you start taking a drink Full Gospel Lighthouse I'm giving you commission to pass the bottle of wine around it's time to be poured out with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost now don't get carnal on me I know people are watching on the internet and don't understand what's going on in here but if you don't understand come here one time come and see [Applause] these people ain't worked up they believe the message this is William branham's message and I say William Branham if you ever did come back you're welcome here to preach where are you going to throw yourself liable for criticism that's what Mary did before she ever felt Jesus start kicking she started praising God [Applause] I ain't seen my loved one I ain't seen my son I ain't seen my daughter I ain't felt the Holy Ghost why don't you thank him for it said she threw herself liable for criticism Mary didn't stop to think about criticism she didn't care about criticism and when a man comes to get the Holy Ghost you don't care what the neighbor's gonna say you don't care if you shout you don't care if you speak with tongues why what's past that you took God at his word you don't care for criticism you've lost all your devil made homemade intellectual society called Prestige the thing you want is favored with God you don't care what the Holy Spirit causes you to do Shout Scream crowd ball or anything you want to do anything the Holy Spirit puts on you you want to make clips about me let's make this clip you've lost all that man-made stuff and you're free in Jesus what makes me so dangerous is I don't care what they say I don't care what the devil does I believe if we can get the atmosphere right and the Holy Ghost comes these people can leave here healed can leave here delivered that's why I say oh House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus get out of our way we've come to thank the Lord [Applause] where you want to know where I stand at I stand with William praying them when's the last time you prayed through when's the last time you broke into prayer and when you got out everybody looked clean you need a refreshing of the Dynamics [Applause] [Music] [Applause] brother Brandon said I've seen them people come all the way back here from Kentucky said they'd stay out there on Saturday night and he said they have themself one of them House to House Parties he said they would dance from one house to the next he said they do it all night long they'd be dancing out there and he said when you see him the next day he said they was packing back her shoes because her feet was so sore I say when's the last time you danced so hard that you dance yourself out of your shoes I'd say when's the last time you beat the devil down so hard that it didn't know what to do until Monday morning I say when's the last time you prayed so much that you got drunk on the Holy Ghost how did I get the Holy Ghost by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body Jesus Christ he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost [Applause] uh I need this I need this I'm ashamed I'm ashamed to dance I'm ashamed to shout I'm ashamed to thank God for the Holy Ghost I'm ashamed my brother Brandon said that when they were up there in the upper room he said they lost all their dignity when the power fell forgive me I know what it's like to be that natural way and he really don't care do you you know what I'm talking about you really don't care you could be so soft that you laid up on a gutter and you just don't know where you are you forgive me but I believe that you can have this in the spiritual Realm I believe that if the angel of the Lord gets moving just right you'll do anything you wouldn't typically do when Angela Lord gets to move and brother Vijay he will do things that are so unseenable I was riding in a van I was riding in a van and there was a little girl sister Julia three or four years ago an angel Lord got in there my little girl Ali got to recognize him that there was an angel in the car and she started praising God before anybody else in the car knew what was going on ain't that right brother out and all of a sudden the angel said ask what you will sister Julia started speaking in tongues and she can't hardly praise she can't hardly pray or praise without God coming down and touching her life I watched this little girl when God was talking about a wave sheath being waved over just like it did on the day of Pentecost I watched you receive a touch of heaven and you've been changed ever since I watched a little girl in the same corner I watched the same girl in that corner get the Holy Ghost you forgive me I'm calling out people that ain't ashamed to be called out my sister had to drive me home one night because I got so drunk on the Holy Ghost that the angel Lord started talking to her about a well that they had problems with it was so muddy there was no way you could drink out of it messed her clothes up when they washed her car but the angel of the Lord said he's come what the enemy's trying to do is block your anointing he's trying to block your anointing and steal your joy out of your very home by trashing up your water that night that night the age of the Lord give give a word to them that their well was going to be fixed and a year to the date later when I spoke to Sister Whitney and said you've never been drunk you've never been drunk on the Holy Ghost but there's a prophecy that's coming by your way and a year to the day later she was so drunk on the Holy Ghost what am I saying to you this is the refreshing of the Holy Ghost what happened at camp meeting just a few weeks ago when sister Tracy when sister Tracy was so drunk on the Holy Ghost they had to carry her through the hotel room if you know anything about them like I know about them they care about germs a little bit but she didn't care one lick about germs at night when you get so drunk you don't care about natural things you don't care what people say what happened that night brother Jim when God told you to stop on that sugar diabetes you didn't care about it what happened brother Jeffrey that same night you was having problem with your ankles what happened arthritis ain't got no holds on you depression ain't got no hold on you well I want to witness it brother Andrew it's in the room [Applause] it's in the room I want to receive the Holy Ghost you're right at it when brother random gets done preaching the seals and I ain't got nowhere where I needed to be but I'm going to drop this and then we're going to call it tonight but after he gets done preaching the seals he preaches he preaches God revealed and hid in Simplicity before the seals and after the seals and he starts standing there and he's teaching people how to get the Holy Ghost he said now there's something wrong there's nothing wrong with God God promised it so help me I could stand right here I could go down aisle after a while and tell every one of you where you're at and what you've done I say that in the name of the Lord you know that's true I see you're afraid to turn yourself loose you're scared of something there's something wrong God Don't Make a promising then go back on it it's the truth right here if you want it it's up to you it's your death it's your burial it's your exception there's the word so help me the holy spirit is here so help me Jesus Christ is here have I ever told you anything wrong he's here but there's something I was standing there
