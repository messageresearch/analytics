us this evening we get ready to change order of the service and it's such an honor this weekend to have the entire Ray family here with us and there's not enough words that we could say and brother Ron's already said some words but there's not enough words that we could say what the ray family means to us here at Full Gospel Lighthouse because we've seen what God has done through brother Michaels his ministry how the Lord we've witnessed how the Lord has abundantly blessed his ministry how the Lord has used him so mightily already around the world and just what seven years now since since the Lord has called him to the ministry and to to call him a friend is is a real treasure and to have the entire Ray family all the way here from Canada we we treasure that greatly and I I just want to just take a moment before we go further I want to say thank you brother Tom for all that you have done all that you've meant to the Spencer family I know that it wasn't that it's all the Lord's doing but if it wasn't for brother Tom Ray we wouldn't be here tonight if it wasn't for a night on the street in Victoria this church would be completely different but because a man was so influenced by the Holy Ghost he was so LED and the Dynamics of this church would not be the same without brother Tom Ray and we just want to say from the depths of our heart we love you with all that is within us and to see what the Lord is doing in your family through brother Michael I I just know that God has something very specific I told my kids I told my family you ask the Lord to do specific things this weekend because this didn't just happen this isn't just this didn't just happen all night of the entire Ray family to be able to be here so I know that the Lord set this up for the supernatural so I want you as brother Michael begins to preach and deliver the word of God tonight I want you to pull on the gift of God brother Michael has a very unique gift given by the Lord to be able to minister the word of God and drop the seed in in such a way it'll bless your heart tonight and I know that if you'll pull on the gift the angel of the Lord will come that has accompanied accompanied this message message all these days he'll come here tonight and meet every single one of your needs let me have a k sister Cassie who taught the son where to stand in the morning and who told the ocean you can only come this far and who showed the moon oh where to hide till leing whose words alone can catch a falling star well I know that my redeemer Le oh I know that my redeemer he lives oh let all creation testify oh let this love within me cry oh I know that my redeemer early is the very same God oh that's been things and Orit runs to the weary oh the war and the [Laughter] [Music] we and the same gentle hand that hold me when I'm broken they conquer death to bring me Victory yes I know that my redeemer Liv oh I know brother Michael [Music] life within me cry I know my redeemer Heavenly Father this evening Lord Lord what a cry we can sing with our depths of our voices and lungs My Redeemer Lives Lord there's many other religions out there that they can sing their songs but they cannot say that their God still lives they can serve a god of stone they can serve a god of sports they can serve a god of fashion but we serve a living God that placed within us a life oh God that can raise us up Lord the same quickening power that raised you from a grave Lord that many years ago is still to same yesterday today and forever so Lord we pray this evening Lord that your same presence would come into this little church Lord as we even Lord sent your presence even now sitting in the back study as the worship would enfold and the songs were lifted up to your throne room Lord I pray it was just filled with your with adoration to our King of Kings Lord that the the your whole Throne Room Lord was just a lord just a cloud of praise for you dwell within the Praises of your people so Lord would you come down this evening Lord Saturday tonight service Lord we don't know what you have in store but Lord I desire tonight that we could be caught up in the vortex of your purpose tonight Lord that you just swirl around this little building Lord would you pick up each one into your presence Lord and Minister the need that they have in their heart would they hold it before your very presence tonight and may you do oh God a wondrous work in each and everyone in this in this little room in this Sanctuary we pray we dedicate the service we dedicate Lord all that would be said and spoken to you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you there's so much that could be said right now but we'll turn to our Bibles as as we would just want to get into the word I I can't as you turn to Ephesians I wrote down the very exact same word brother Ron our fam's years and Supernatural events have intertwined our families I wrote those very down those words down God has threaded our families together Supernatural threading and I I just I you know I wrote I just said I Marvel which Marvel means to be filled with wonder and that's really what my heart is just filled with wonder because you can just step back and say Lord I don't know what you're doing but I just want to be following in exactly what you're Desiring to be done I don't need to know I don't need to be told what tomorrow holds I just want to be in step with where you're leading us so Lord may he lead and guide this congregation and continue to pour His Spirit here we my goodness we're maybe many thousands of miles apart but it's like we're connected quite close distance don't matter nothing so eternity is already stepping down because eternity distance means nothing and so we're already just stepping into that little into that place amen and my brother Andrew you've impacted my family very specifically Lord only knows these things and you're so special to us I just there's just too much I just don't even know I'm just humbled to be here humbled to be standing here behind this Paul Actually I don't even know how I even can got here brother R how a few years back I could I just don't even know how I could even uh I would never have imagined this but you know and you can just submit yourself to the Lord you can have all the desires you want in the world but when he has his desires well it can be going in the total opposite direction and I can pre I can definitely stand and testify but there's no other place I'd rather be I just want to be in the perfect will of God Amen and so Lord Just Have Your Way tonight as we just Fellowship around the word and just see what the Lord desires to do tonight amen Ephesians 6 very familiar scripture I tried to uh you know the preachers behind me would know you try to maybe pull away from a thought and you just try to move yourself away I just couldn't get away and this dropped in my heart several um well a few months ago now and it just hasn't never left me and so the Lord will have his way tonight Ephesians 6:12 for I wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the dark dark nness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand I'm just so amazed at how that was written by Paul because he puts a period there and it's just the most odd way to end end end a verse and so it but it just makes you really stop there for a second and then forces you to the next verse for when having done all to stand you have to go to the next part stand therefore there ain't no just stopping at that period even though it's put there but it's put there and you you must go to the next verse stand therefore having your loins G about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen so I want to just take the stand therefore if you just keep that in your hearts turn to Isaiah 21-11 also another very familiar scripture well I what's not a familiar scripture they should all be familiar maybe maybe some deep deep line in Chronicles where you forgot somebody's name or something like that that's understandable but but here this is another scripture the burden of Duma he calleth to me out of SE Watchmen what of the night Watchmen repeated what of the night and the Watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if you will inquire inquire ye return come ien the Lord have his blessings of the reading the word you may be seated tonight we're familiar with the I'm sure the message Watchman what of the night scripture saying the morning cometh and also the night and we know it would be an understatement for me to take tonight and to say that we liveing in Dark Times amen we're all aware of the of the of the darkness I should say the political Darkness the religious Darkness the entertainment Darkness the education Darkness it's just straight up Darkness amen it's and and it's fulfilling scripture but br says the coming of the Lord is at hand how how many times would that have been said by a prophet the coming of the Lord is at hand amen and how many people missed that line I read that line just today and I just thought my goodness Lord help me just catch that one sentence right there the coming of the Lord is at hand right here today amen we're in his coming and and the he said the judgments God spoke of he said the people would get to a place they'd Fall Away gross Darkness would cover the earth when spiritual Darkness gets upon the Earth it's time time for the enemy to attack think about it gr darkness is here it's upon the Earth he said it's time for the enemy to attack where're at the hour gross Darkness now I don't know if anybody's really looked at that word before because it says in Isaiah 60 and2 for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people okay so you're like well what's the difference scripture says this but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon the well Darkness if you look at the word is misery destruction death ignorance sorrow and wickedness obscurity a confusion and uncertainty that's Darkness Welcome To Earth here we are but gross darkness is a little bit different it's a darkness that actually can be felt think about it and gross Darkness on the people a darkness that actually can be felt almost if I could say a pressure of Darkness okay that's what you're living there's a pressure of Darkness it has this ability or it has an objective to oppress itself or an oppressive objective to bring you to a succumbing aspect or to to to Cave you in or if I could say to surrender okay grows Darkness it's an oppressive it's a pressure that we live in if I Define surrender because that's really what the darkness is trying to do to you is trying to oppress itself or press itself onto you to make you bend and Cave to the darkness of this world that's where we live I know what it's like here in Elton but I can tell you it's gross darkness in Vancouver terrible Darkness amen and so it's looking for you to surrender your will and your desires and and every aspect of your life but that surrender is to cease resistance think about it gross darkness is trying to get you to a place where you cease resistance which would be completely contrary to scripture which says resist the devil and he will flee so gross darkness is trying to come into the into this age upon you and I and try to get you to a place where you cease to resist it's looking for you to submit to their Authority this is surrendering if you surrender your submitting to somebody's Authority you're ceasing to to push back it's to give something that's yours and to give to somebody else you're surrendering something over because you've been forced to do so because it's necessary to do so or they're so they're saying to you this is necessary to do surrender to me right now and so that's that's what surrender is or it's to give in it's to give up it's to yield or concede it's to submit or climb down give way defer acence back down cave in relent succumb or just plain old quit hopefully one of those hit everybody today somebody got one of those words that is one of the synonyms for all the teachers of surrender and from every angle and Direction every side there's a pressure there's a force gross darkness that is upon the land to put you into a bowing state or a bending state to the devices and the desires of this world Amen would everybody agree it's there to put your thinking Under Pressure the way Society thinks the way culture thinks the the different ways that they're they're trying to press you to to to look at how life is in this day and age and whatever it is in our social cultures and and different things it's trying to put in bend your thinking or Surrender your thinking to its will that's where it's at your words and expressions it's there it's under pressure at work you're certain certain things you can say certain actions you're allowed to do parents certain ways you're allowed to discipline your children these days it's not you're not allowed to do this no more you can't do this or you can't do that and so the world is trying to force you Satan is trying to force you to bend yourself away from the very word of God Amen he's trying to get you to cease your resistance to his way that's the gross Darkness amen so you that's why you come home at the end of a work day and you're just pling old Tapped Out you know a husband comes home from workers and and he's just rung out cu you're under pressure it's there just to pressure is anybody ever had something heavy fall on them and it's just or anybody ever had a heart attack not I thankfully but you'll feel a pressure it starts to squeeze you you feel like there's an 80 PB elephant just ready to squish you it is squishing you it's pressure it's not is it a good feeling no it is not it makes you do things that you never really intended Under Pressure it's actually a force that's there that's upon you to maybe maybe you don't maybe not even knowing there that there is that Force but it's real cuz I'll even just just just flip it on a bit of a side you know anybody that does Sports and you're like oh man they choked Under Pressure people have had some major mishaps because they get in the moment there's some well for everybody here that's maybe a football fan would remember back in the day when the team was called the Oilers probably you don't even know who they are but if it's a Tennessee Titans maybe you would but they were up 35 and3 early in the third quarter with the Buffalo Bills and they didn't even they didn't the bu didn't have a first choice quarterback out there so it was I mean it was stacked towards the Oilers now Titans and the Oilers would lose or Titans in overtime 35 to 38 and to this day it ranks the greatest comeback in NFL history no wonder they changed their name because Under Pressure they caved they had a lead they were they had they even had the other team was a secondary quarterback but the pressure of it a force that was there that they maybe he didn't even realize what's causing them to adjust how they were responding think about it amen and one of the biggest areas if I could say pressure maybe as we just weave our way through the service is we get pressure from our peers peer pressure not an easy thing we all deal with peer pressure whether you want to say so or not you think well that's just for the teens brother Michael I'm sorry it ain't the case it's from zero to 100 not miles per hour but in Years everybody is affected by peer pressure am man it's in everybody's opinion is important and everybody has a voice today they got a voice on every single you know they want to be heard aloud too and every platform you wish because you could stack them up and put your opinion your voice your idea on X Twitter Snapchat WhatsApp Facebook Tik Tok YouTube you name it Reddit Kora every single one cut copy paste all the way through because you want your voice your opinion to be heard to pressure somebody to your way of thinking that's what it is every time you click on that little link every time you look at some little thread every time you pull up some Facebook feed someone's given an opinion and you don't really realize it but it's pressuring you peer pressuring you to their idea which is really bringing you back into then submitting or surrendering your thought to their thought pressure poor job was under pressure from his peers and they sat there in their little group there I can imagine as job had just had his all his Goods all his livelihood all his his his livestock and his money his whole his whole being had just been stripped to the ground his children had now been killed and if you read scripture which always amazed me every time I I mention it it's in the same at the same time while he was yet speaking this happened while he was yet speaking the next thing happened and he was stripped to the ground and his peers looked at this and said oh my goodness something job must be doing something very wrong and they sat him down and said job and they started to strip him down here strip him down there and say well you must have did some secret sin here maybe you didn't do this there and they just started to whittle him down and pressure him to the point where his wife just said just Curse God and die job pressure think about it you know you think sometimes we think peer pressure is just bad things you know well they're going to press you into smoking a cigarette or something like that but you don't realize actually that there's the devil really is a little bit more subtle with you and I he's not pressing you to go to the bar and drink that's just not how it's going to work he knows that's not your area or your weak area so to say okay so he the devil's a tactician this guy he he's a strategist he knows exactly what you do he knows exactly where your your weak area is he studied you for years however old you are he studied you that long and he studied Humanity for 6,000 years or so and so he knows Humanity in its in in its course of action and how we're biologically programmed and so he's figured out exactly how to work and so he watches you and he watches where you're at he watches how you move and how you respond and how you think and he's like I got the exact thing for them so here we are in a different we live here in a carnal realm or here in an Earthly realm but if I could say this there's not just peers on an Earthly aspect but you also have peer pressure From Another Dimension there's pressure from an Earthly there's pressure from a Heavenly and there's pressure from a hell and it's pressing you and I one from either side and we're living in the middle of it and you wonder why you're wasted at the end of the day amen and so Satan is there trying to ensure that the Realms of Darkness press you to a place and impact you I would say Lord I want the I want the Realms of light to be that force behind me amen I want to be that what that peer that's pressing me I want the cloud of witnesses to be there pressing me saying move on you can do it keep pressing on that oh if God could open up the banister of glory and you could hear them shouting go forward run this race get out there live for the gospel too often we can just think of the devil we can think of the negative side and oh he's just pressing me to do this or he's pressing me to do this this negative thought this negative thought but you got a great host you got a great host of witnesses that's there behind you saying run the race that's the peer pressure focus on that aspect oh my God help us pressure Moses was going to give you a couple examples of pressure as we work our way through my title tonight if I can get there is in the darkest hour we never surrender in the darkest hour and Moses here as we le as we just work our way was under pressure and now the devil like I said he's not looking at you to go to the bar but maybe he's going to work on you some way maybe he's got somebody in the church that man they just don't they just rub you wrong you know they just that person me and them maybe we just they say something my just kind of gets me going a little bit come on we're human man we're human just in case you you don't think you're there Moses is there okay and Moses he came the children of Israel came to him and even the whole you know what I got to take my go off now this is three piece suit country I told my brothers I said you guys better get a threepiece two we're going to Virginia Ron I'm the only one that showed [Applause] up oh man I tell you you what this world has their people that they admire and they put before them and they dress like them and they talk like them and they make sure they got the same shoes as them well guess what we got people in The Bride of Jesus Christ that I can look toward and say you know what I want to dress like them I want to act like them they got a walk of God that I want to so guess what devil back at you don't need to condemn me because oh you're just trying to be like so and so you bet I'm trying to be like so and so because he's got a walk like God that I want to amonate hallelujah amen back to Moses then came the children of Israel even the whole congregation in the desert of Zin in the first month and the people Abode in C Kadesh and Miriam died there and was buried and then there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron so the pressure now is starting internal they're now against Moses here and the people the scripture says chowed with Moses chowed and so now they're just In Spite and they're talking they're speaking they're they're being rough here little harsh would God that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord can you imagine after all they had been through would God that we died with our brothers on pressure and why have ye they're pointing their big finger right in the nose of Moses not God why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord in this Wilderness you did it Moses you took us here you brought us to this place uh did God take you out of the out of Egypt did God bring you through did God give you Mana did God do these things but no Moses you did it come on brought us up the congregation here in the wilderness and we and our cattle should die here come on Moses wherefore have ye made us to come out of Egypt to bring us into this evil Place wait a second I thought you were going to bring us Moses into canaan's Fair land the land of milk and honey what about your message Moses didn't s doesn't look so good now you know and so they're attacking him they're attacking his message that they' pre that he's been speaking to them come to the land God's got a place for you a land of milk and honey and like No Moses your message is wrong there's no seed no figs no Vines no pomegranates there's no water to drink what you told us Moses your message of milk and honey is false I'm just reading the scripture there and just giving you a little bit of insight that's what they're saying put it into the ground put put it put it down in the in the brass tax this wasn't just one person this was the whole Camp pressure pressure and they're just grinding at Moses and Moses is trying to stand there trying to take it and it says Moses then went to the presence of the assembly under the door of the Tabernacle and fell on their faces him and Aaron and the Lord spoke to them and he said speak ye to The Rock before their eyes and it'll give forth water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the Rocks so that thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink and so here Moses I'm just talking pressure right now the the how the devil uses something to just start to grind trying to get you out of your place trying to get you to a place where he can get you susceptible you got that little area we know Moses had maybe had it was a little bit of a temper area he had that aspect he was he was fiery and so the devil knew exactly where to I knew exactly where to get you Moses and so he's going to work he knows exactly where to get you and so he started to put the pressure on and he comes out of the Tabernacle there the assembly and he comes there and the scripture says Moses and them gathered there before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels you sweet lovely people I'm so thrilled that I can just Journey with you even though you're backbiting me and throwing it in my face I love you no no Moses wasn't there Moses was ye Rebels why must we fetch you water from the rock wait a second look at how it just tripped him up a little bit why must we oh Moses just tumbled there and then as scripture glorified himself because of pressure pressure and he lifted up his hand and smoked the rock twice breaking the types of scripture Christ was smoked one time not two times and there because he gave into the pressure his temper got him and he surrendered to that and it stopped him think of the ripple effect because of that the ripple effect at that moment stopped him from being able to enter into the Promised Land think about that my goodness there's lots of different aspects of pressure you can think of Samson in a wrong relationship and the pressure that Delilah put on him I don't I won't go through the scripture but you can imagine there he was as as as as Samson then desired and gave his heart as brother Brown said he gave his strength to God and his heart to Delilah and there under the pressure of it little by little just willing himself down just throwing a little bit out there and you know well it's it's tie my hands with with the these certain uh wi the whips or I can't remember it's a funny word in the scripture but it then it's ropes and then it's weave my hair and he's just slowly just being ebbed away and ebbed away and the pressure that's being put on him and it just vexed his soul actually is what scripture said to the point where he finally said fine if you shave my head think about it just slowly but surely it's young people that's why you never get into a wrong relationship or get yourself into twined because the devil is behind there the scripture says the Lords of the Philistines were behind the Lila don't you get into some little relationship with somebody that's not serving this gospel serving this message because it's a Delilah that's got the Lords of the Devils of Hell behind them trying to find your Covenant and weaken you and destabilize you and put you in a mill with blind eyes the Ripple devil trying to cause a a caving a surrendering you know what the brutal thing is is then you get into those places and then he knows that you know H then he throw you knows I know your weak point and then he starts devising these different ways this little ripple effect of it now you feel like a failure so then he works on you see you're a failure you did that there and now you're a failure how are you even a good Christian anymore how do you think you're even saved now you're even doubting that you're even a even even a believer and even saved and that he just works on it it's it's a ripple effect all the way down that's right because of pressure pressure and so he's pushing give in influencing you give up your morals give up your rights give up the promises of the scripture well I'm the god that heals all your diseases well God hasn't really healed me he hasn't really touched me I'm still dealing with this certain thing and the devil just starts to work on you is he really your healer pressure pressure he says if I brother Brown says if I was dying and 5,000 people died a 100 years ago and had been in eternity that long think of this quote if I was dying and 5,000 people died a hundred years ago and had been in eternity that long rose back and came to Earth and said brother brandom don't you trust it he's not right don't trust it we trusted him we failed I'd still say let me die in Jesus Christ that to me is a powerful quote he was so anchored it didn't matter if 5,000 people raised up from the dead and say m this is false he said I still believe and die in Jesus Christ that's where your rock has to be you can't just be well my parents do believe it my my brother does and my daddy does and this that the other because I can tell you in that state if 5,000 people raised up and said I know it's wrong you're like like really all right I'm out but when it's something that falls deep into your soul God spoke to you you know he's a personal God to me it's me and Christ and no one else I don't care if the world died and I'm the only one left and all 8 billion of them raised from the dead and said don't go there I still believe in my God that's why this message came to make this a personal gospel not just something of history but when brother brandham said I'm going to raise him up out of History to prove to you and I he still lives [Applause] today I'm preaching to a church that knows that for sure yes sir indeed we're just rejoicing in it amen H give up your position in your home daddies come on pressure you need to be the you need to be the mom Dad Dad needs to be the mom mom the dad mom husbands and wife getting out of place it's pressure cuz it's pressure from this age it's the pressing of gross Darkness well you know it just go this is kind of how it is now you don't even realize it give up your place give up your respect for your parents just slowly just pressing its way in well we didn't talk that way 80 years ago we didn't talk that way 25 years ago well that's just what I hear at school that's just kind of how it is is and now it's all slang and text this and LOL and that and the other and then we talk to our parents that way like whoa whoa wait a second honor your father and mother that's for you young people it's free you don't realize that just this age is there to bend you as you slowly surrender to its way that's why this word is here to resist the enemy in this Dark Age the worst time we are in the worst time headline breaking news on CNN I bet you that would get some serious headlines if Fox News breaking news everything stopped we are in the darkest the worst the most hideous the most Blasphemous time this world has ever seen well then you'd be like tell me something I don't know for once they'd all be correct all of them if they broadcast that brother Donnie Reagan then though said in a long time ago in a service he said that Satan can create enough pressure that a Justified man he can create enough pressure that will break a Justified man he said he can create enough pressure that would break a Sanctified man just living in sanctification but if there's a man that's got something he's got a lifegiving force that's down in the soul of Holy Ghost filled son and daughter of God there ain't no pressure there ain't no darkness that can press you or move you or alter your course nothing will move you Hallelujah that's why it preached so hard get an experience that's why the Holy Ghost experience it's preached because you need to get there because in just a Justified Sanctified life you'll never make it that's just straight up reality you know there was one man in Scripture that got just a lot of pressure and I'd like to just go through just shortly here what time did I start just help me out just be kind you know if I was sitting back there and you asked me I probably would tell you yeah probably not I take that back maybe if I look at my wife out there amen if you turn to John you can just follow along I'm not necess going to read it all but John N has a uh an account of a man and there he was scripture says Jesus passed by I'll just read it quickly because I don't know what time I started so now I got to go really fast so hold on to your seats buckle up and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin they said this man were his parents that he was born blind question he said neither neither has sin nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest and I must work The Works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world and so then he had thus spoken and he spits on the ground my goodness in this day be like whoa that's disgusting but there you put it down spits makes a little clay starts to form it and he's looking at that man seeing his eyes all blinded and he takes a spit the clay and he starts to rub it place it in his eyes can you imagine those Loving Hands of Christ I just started to form that in his eyes just think of that moment all would have been quiet there as the people looked on he starts rub the clay in his eye he says no goal wash in the pool of silon and he went his way there you imagine he's got clay in his eyes Jesus says go yes Lord just point me in the direction said that way all right I'm going amen think about it that's the scripture said but there's a man there with clay spitt in his eyes and he says go Jesus said go to the pool all right which way that way I'm going and so he makes his way to the pool of silom there he gets into the pool and he starts to walk can you imagine the moment as he starts to scrub that little spittle off his eyes he starts to get that clay off his eyes and he said wait a second light started to pour through as he put the Dust Away he said oh my goodness I can see I can see I tell you the pool of silom was a rejoicing place as he was jumping and leaping I'm sure I can see I haven't seen since the day I was born I can now see it he's going through each person there saying who did this to you well a man back there who was it that did this to you and so they take him now to the people and he goes back in the scripture says he went his way and the neighbors therefore they which before had seen him that he was blind said is this not the one that sat and begged and some others said he looks like him may maybe I mean he's a little bit different now that he sees his eyeballs are there and I can see them but he said well maybe it's he and he said um maybe therefore he they said some said this is he he's like him but he said I am he come on guys do you need your eyes fixed I'm the same one I'm in the same clothes I have the same beger cup but I can see [Music] now he said A Man Called Jesus made clay and he anointed my eyes he's now telling a testimony he said go to the pool of Silo and wash and I went and I washed and receive my sight now they said well where is he I don't know where'd he go who is this one and you can tell because they brought him to the Pharisees it wasn't maybe a good interaction well I don't know who is this one did he really heal you what's his message anyway well I don't know about that I mean did he go to the synagogue did the do the Pharisees know about this one is he approved by the church I don't know about that you got to come with us to the Pharisees and you need to tell them what just happened because I don't know if this is really right and kosher and so they brought him to the Pharisees they're putting pressure on him who do you think you are testifying about this man and I think God hasn't sense you humor because it was on the Sabbath day as scripture says and Jesus had done some other healings on the Sabbath day and it just rankled the Pharisees what is this man doing does he not know oh he did he is a Sabbath The Lord of the Sabbath God's got a sense of humor and so they bring him there to the to the Pharisees before him a four time was blind and it was Sabbath day and Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes and then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight now how exactly did this happen who is this one that calls himself a Healer or they call him the Healer well what did he do well it's not complicated think about it he's just a little begger he's like well guys I've just been begging and a man came by and he put spittle in the clay and put a little dust and and then made clay and put it on my eyes and I went and washed just as he said I followed his word just as he said and I went to the pool just as he said and I washed them and my eyes and they became they became I could see is this so complicated is this word complicated it says only believe all things are possible is it complicated his word said it and I believed it and I just walked in it and he said it and I believe it what's so complicated I can tell you a Pharisee it's very complicated but to a son and daughter of God it ain't complicated no sir they said well this man is not of God oh all right can you imagine de denying here a blind man has just been given sight who else can do these things he's not of God and now this man is sitting there under the scrutiny you got to you got to remember the Pharisees were pretty powerful they controlled a lot of things that so the people you just didn't talk back to them if I could say it that I mean they they they lorded pretty heavily and so when you you just weren't you had to be pretty careful and so now when he's under this he's just a beggar and he's like I'm just telling you what happened to me they're pressing him he's not of God well these these ones are their their belief and everything they do to serve God is very important to them this is part of who they are part of who you are and you can imagine what you just experienced is not of God well if it's not of God who is it of so what are they telling him it's not of God it's of the devil there's only one two two Powers so if they're telling him it's not of God and so this man is like is under the pressure wall he's just he's taking this in he said therefore he said but because he keepeth not the Sabbath day how can a man that is a sinner do such Miracles and there was division of among them and they start to bicker and the banter and this and that and the other the beggar's just in the middle and he's looking back and forth he's say all I know is I could see does anybody want to Rejoice with me and it's just a hurdle of noise and and loud you know loud cacophony of all this and they said well they say unto the blind man again what's sayest thou of him that he opened Thine Eyes he said he is a prophet okay I'm going to read that again for you they say they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he that he hath opened Thine Eyes question he said well from what I've just experienced in my short span of time he is a prophet he had different eyesight he might have had natural eyesight just rekindled and renewed and brought back to him but there was a different a faith eyesight an optic that brother red spoke of of a prophet optic he could see into another realm he was penetrating with eyes that penetrated a supernatural Dimension and he said that's no normal man that's a prophet but the Jews did not believe him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the the the parents can you imagine they that he had been blind and they did not believe him concerning him that he had been blind so I you know what I just don't believe you you you you must have seen before you're a fake he's like I've been here for like decades begging you Rabbi so and so gave me shekels you Rabbi so and so gave me shekels how have you not how are you just you know misrepresenting my my H facial aspects how are you not recognizing who I am and he must have been an utter disbelief go get your parents and they asked them is this your son who you say was born blind and now sees and his parents said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he's of age ask him I don't know he was down there at a church one day and he met so he was sitting in a service and he was hearing the word spoke it is my son but then he came home one day and said Daddy I was saved tonight I don't know about it I know nothing about it in fact it's not what I even want go ask him isn't that what happened dad Daddy I was saved tonight oh boy goodness what just happened to you something's different about you you still have your hair you still have everything else but there's something different yes but her dad D my daddy said I met God tonight and that's what was happening right here yeah I don't know he was somewhere he was with who he was with I know not but just ask him but we want nothing to do with it can you imagine he was blind and he now sees wouldn't you think the change would be welcomed I don't care who did it I don't know what was done can I find him search the City who just healed my son where is Pharisees I don't even care what you're saying let's go get him isn't that what it is oh was just at a service I gave my heart to the Lord I received this message there's a Prophet come to this day oh my goodness you got to come on Me to Church no you're weird now I just got my eyes how am I strange no no that's totally different we don't even want that no more go back to the bar go back to drinking go back to smoking go back to carousing go back to your filthy magazines go back to your filthy websites we want you how you were before and they pressed him I'm just talking pressure and therefore he asked his parents he's of age ask him and he answered and said I'm just going quickly they again called the man that was blind and he said unto him give God God praise we know that this man is a sinner he like I have been doing that have you not been hearing me I've been praising him all day long for what he's done for me and then they said to him what did he to thee how did he open your eyes and he answered them I told you already like 80 times wherefore would you hear it again and will you also be his disciple love scripture I've told you you need to meet him too cuz you're dead you're just an actor in your tradition and all your laws and this and that and the other you need to meet a living God that can open the eyes of the Blind and heal the lame and raise the sick and deliver the [Applause] [Laughter] halt you preaching to me boy and they reviled him scripture says then they sent him out and pressed him so and they sent him out and they sent him out of the synagogue and they cast him out pressure but that man I could tell you walked away no caring about nothing I can tell you right now whatever you got in there is dead and I'm going to find him I'm going to find him who was it that just opened my eyes I got to search the city for him and Jesus heard oh yes he did he knew exactly what was going on all the time and Jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he found him amen Jesus was going to look for him and when he found him he said Dost thou believe on the Son of God and he answered Lord who is he that I might believe on him that's the heart of a son and daughter of God lord where is he I need whatever wherever he is and there Jesus said in him thou Hast both seen him and it is he that talketh to thee oh it's just like the woman at the well I that speaketh to thee am he one of my favorite scriptures happening again right there with a blind man who had just went through the heat the hottest and heaviest pressure to conform this is not the mess said this is false this is wrong what you what you saw was was fake and it's not true you need to get out of it it's a cult go here and go there he said no I don't believe it something in my soul is telling me this is true I have to find him I have to go search for him and God because he's predestinated knew exactly what he was looking for and when and found him he said I I am he hallelujah hallelujah and you know what he did and he worshiped him oh my goodness that was a seat of God and the Great Mighty Hunter was looking for his children the eagle screamed and there he was snatched him out of the hands of a dead religion he took the pressure because inside of him was something that could hold man the devil intimidate you can you imagine going through all of that and you wear skirts and you do this and you do that and you live funny and you this girls you dress funny and all that and he tries to make you feel some sort of second class you ain't no second class you're first class there's nothing anybody in this gospel needs to be intimidated and worry about you walk through your school hallways you walk through your work hallways you say I'm a Son of God I ain't no ashamed of nothing [Applause] amen you know there was Peter one day and Jesus said to him just a couple chapters here Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood so he starts to preach the word and everybody there is silent okay this is different then he said does it offend you what if you see shall see the son of man Ascend up to where he was before and Jesus is speaking it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak un you they are spirit and they are life and they're the disciples all everybody all the disciples hundreds of them are all around listening and scripture says from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more and then Jesus turned to the 12 and said will ye also go away and I can just see Peter God Point his finger right in his face will you also go away he just heard a lot of things he's like I don't even understand I can just see as Peter in that moment I can just see his whole world come to a standstill everything just freeze and he's seeing there Jesus with his finger pointed at him will you also go away and Peter Ste out what do I do now I've never heard words like this before eat his flesh drink his blood I can't even comprehend that and he's looking at this he's seeing now all those have turned his back they just turned their back they've walked away and there Peter standing with a finger in his face you too but everything I've seen I've seen in this word everything I've seen in this message not one time did he call out a need and it was never it was forever true he called he he dealt with the lame he dealt with the halt he dealt with the blind he dealt with the dumb and they all received their sight they received their hearing he would call out that woman at the well and he called all the names of all her H all of her husbands and told her that she had had many husbands how can I comprehend all this how can I put it together and he's just wrestling that with in his mind he's saying who could this be Peter back in the finger goes away and he said Lord to whom shall we go something dropped there thou alone Hast the words of eternal life something sparked inside him I don't understand it all I don't know exactly everything he's saying but all I know is he's the truth the way and the life and I'm going to put my face sit towards wherever he goes I'm going to go Ruth did it she followed her Naomi where you go I go where you die I die will your God be my God I'm going to pull from that scripture and Peter says where you go I'm going to go where can I go but where you lead me we believe and are sure a lot was going on right there and from Heaven I Thunderbolt of Revelation and he could say are sure that thou art the son of the Living God God oh I love scripture but brandom said he said well how do I know I was just pondering about God you can hear about that since he called my name on the book of redemption you many of you young ones have heard we've sang songs you've read scripture your name's written on the book say well is it like they're wrote on the name on on the book I'm going to tell you but AB Braham says your name was placed in the word and when the word is revealed that is what beckons and calls you so your name is in the book because you respond to the word of the hour of your day and when it went forth something inside like Peter said wait a second that's quickening something inside me I've been sitting at some dead denomination but I just heard something that's your name on the book he said only those that can respond to the word the word had to be opened or those that were able to respond would have nothing to be called with so the word in this day was open so that you could be called by a word that could reach down to your soul the word identified who you are he said the loosing and the claiming he said what was she he was speaking about the little Pro itute she was the one that had her name there no matter what kind of state she was in as soon as that true Gospel Light struck the little prostitute she recognized it that's how you know you're called because when the word Goes Forth and you started to read that book wow serpent seed I never even read this before you mean godhead you mean it's not a trinity and something starts to spark off in your soul I tell you that's how you're called by the word of this hour Peter was here in his name can you imagine to see roll call and suddenly Peter the eternities we're sure that thou are the Christ amen that's what was happening that's why the woman of the well could never surrender that's why Paul could never surrender after that that's why Peter could be crucified upside down because he became sure something had anchored at his heart in the darkest hour can you imagine getting yourself prepared on a cross and Nails starting to go on your hands and now he starting to get flipped upside down and put up on the cross The Darkest Hour Peter wasn't saying I'm done can't do it take me down I recant it all oh no he said I'm not even worthy to die like my Lord turn me upside down what is it then but brah says the rock it's built on it's divine re revelation of who Jesus Christ is upon the solid rock Christ builds his church all the gates of hell will never Prevail when that direct Revelation comes from Heaven that Christ is your emancipator and when he has become your savior your deliverer and that is anchored in your heart all the devils in in torment will never make you deny it come on do you know how many Devils there are it didn't say some it didn't say a 100 it didn't say 200,000 it said all every aspect of Hell could be put down and suddenly on one big ball of demons pressing against you can you imagine the pressure but it wouldn't matter if every demon power starts to push down on every area of your life you just stand there I can take it not me but the life inside me and he starts to send you like job starts to strip you down starts to take your possession start to take your health and you're like oh God I don't know how I can endure this but by your strength I can get through I'm so thankful that my God never surrendered think about the victory there in the regions of hell even in the darkest of darkest of regions there was the scene of all scenes one of my favorite scenes that brother Brenham speaks about when Satan for the first time is hearing this news I love this because Christ had just endured The Darkest Hour he had just finished being on his knees in Gethsemane and like drops of blood dropping from his his brow as he his will is being stripped from him you think you've had a tough time trying to find the will of God and maybe knowing that God's leading you in a certain direction and you sit there and you're like oh God I don't know I can't do this he sat there and he knew exactly what was before him he knew the cross was there he knew the whips were there he knew the beating he knew the thorn crowd of thorns and the pain that he was going to endure he oh God not th will and the pressure you think the devil wasn't there capitalizing on that moment where he could just press in the doubt and press in all this yeah you don't have to go through this he already tried a little while ago and said hey I'll just give you it all you know you don't have to do all that just I'll take Give It All the kingdoms just bow to me you don't have to go through all of this pressure he said no I have my loving bride that's who's on my mind and so there he went he wrestled it out the rud and offspring of David think if think if David didn't go to Goliath and there he was getting his little sling out and he looks at the GL says who ho no way I'm out there'd be no Kingdom of David there'd been no Solomon there had been no roote and offspring of David the whole ripple effect of that no no no God placed exactly what what was needed in this heart and soul because David could come to them that Glide there was no fear there was nothing ain't surrendering to you and neither was God going to sit there and surrender to the Ws of the enemy and so there he was there in in the day in the time as as life now started to to be to to be taken away from him and he hung on the cross and died the cruel death as he dared the pain and the agony of the of the nails in his hands as the Roman solders smash the nail down to his hand but he never surrendered because he then started to walk down into the regions of hell this was a moment I wish I hope God plays it back for us when we get across eternity and he starts to come in there and brother Brenham says you knock on the door who is it open the door but Bram says open the doors and there mingling Souls there in prison waiting for the day of judgment open the door I'm the Son of God the Virgin born he says there I'm he I can just see that little demon you go tell your master who's here that poor little amp what is it uh there's somebody here to see you boss I'm busy right now do you know what's happening on Calvary I think I've got him he thought he was the one he thought he was a Son of God yeah that's what I'm here to talk to you about B there's somebody you need to say I'm busy who is it well he says he's the Virgin born said what excuse me bring him in here amen and Christ strides into that little room H probably wasn't a little room the headquarters of hell can you imagine your God down in the headquarters of hell he said I am he I am the one and everything was written of me in my father's word and I have confirmed it on in Yonder on the cross it's finished close the doors that's all of it they have to recognize the Earth knew him he said it shook the great earthquake when he died the moon hit its face the very Creator was dying oh brother BR says I feel religious tonight he says I know what I'm talking about I'm not lost in the fog I know right where I'm standing he descended right there in the lower regions of hell he said who are you and Satan opens it up he said you finally arrived did you I've been waiting for you I thought I had you and he goes through all the different ones that have gone before and he's like yeah you're just like another one you just died my champion of death has just taken you out okay say Satan I I don't even know how I could conjure up the words as he would have bellowed out those words with a voice of authority actually probably would have said Satan give me the keys just give me the keys I don't even need to fight you about it cuz you're done you're finished just hand them over surrender surrender devil it's your time yeah he said you don't possess them anymore he said 'oh yes I do he says because back Yonder in the Garden of Eden where Adam sinned and because he sinned he trespassed and I got him he's dead He's Mine He's into hell oh wait devil wait wait wait did you just miss something I'm pretty sure you blinked and when you blinked you didn't miss that I was hanging on a cross and I am virgin born my blood was created I am Immanuel I am the king of kings I am the mighty conqueror it's not another man up there I am your creator think of that one I'm your creator Devil Hand him over glory to God my God didn't surrender why because he couldn't and neither can [Applause] you Hallelujah the devil didn't want to give him the keys he's trying to hold on to them well he's trying to find some excuse you got no excuse there's no backend thing and some written unwritten law and so God just had to go there and say well fine then I'll just take them from you that's right and so he pulled them off his bed Loops as brother brandham said and you know what he said he smacked him in the [Music] face that's what any parent would do to one of their kids maybe not smack him in the face but give a SWAT you listen to me the first time when I tell you to give me my keys you give me my keys smack amen and then he walked out of there and he shut the door so hard brother brandham said the suit pegs of Hell blew dust in his eyes what just happened to me you just were stripped of all your power death and hell is no longer in your hands hallelujah hallelujah because of that very act right there it's time to turn the tables because that was God in flesh flesh came in God came into a body the same flesh it had all the same properties you say well what about me brother Michael yeah well Jesus was in flesh and he he bore the bore a body just like you and I and he went through all the things that you and I went through and he bore these trials that we he we go through brother BR it's scripture says he went through and suffered it all so that he would know what it was like and he was pressured at different times of surrender to put him in positions to give in but he never did because he was showing you and I that with my life inside of you I have just proven that Earthly flesh filled with God can overcome everything even death and now please tell me what time I started you need to 10 10 minutes and I'll find where I'm going here I wrote in my notes it's time to put the pressure back hallu it's time for his surrender it's time now to place the pressure back on him it's not given up for for us hallelujah it's give up for him give in give back and give up you weren't here I'm sorry Saints you weren't here to get out of bed and and cower and wonder am I going to get through today oh my goodness I know I'm a Son of God but this been a tough day today no no no God didn't raise you up to do that he raised you up to get out of bed I think it was brother Donnie that said a long time ago he wanted Dead the devil to be shuttering in his boots the moment he got out of bed I think that butter Donnie said said that back back years ago and I'd say oh God may I have the same testimony amen that if when I got out of bed the devil's wondering oh dear goodness what am I going to do today with him right and there was God God was showing you a pattern it was there when when he was on on on the earth the devil it wasn't like some some uh um what do you call it truce between the two you know if you don't hurt me I won't hurt you you know we'll just go about this you know we'll just let me do my thing and you do your thing no that's that's not how it was God came on Earth to be a wrecking ball to Hell's Kingdom amen when he came down on Earth he stepped into flesh he wasn't there to be like well what's the least I could do no no no he was going to come down there to prove over and over and over and over again who he was so that's why the lame could walk and blind could see he went through there just smashing through Satan's kingdom because he was going to then send his life to you and I so that we could be the same Wrecking Ball just like Pharaoh over and over again putting pressure on Moses come on Moses surrender I'm going to crush you more bricks less straw but brother brandom said Pharaoh Pharaoh got so excited at the midnight he said get out of here get going tell take everything you got and go that's what I want the devil to do when we get raptured out of here good grief get out of here get out of Earth I'm so tired of dealing with you actually devil you're getting cast down so I can go up up amen hallelujah brother BR says I'm so glad that a man can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with him oh my that's exactly what I want him to do what do I do with this guy today Hallelujah I'm going to quit somewhere because I have to yes I do my goodness and I thought was short on notes my wife's going to laugh at me you know I was looking for a little uh looking for a paper I was actually the Library of Congress in DC and I was looking for I wanted to find a letter and I couldn't find it I forgot and then I was madly trying to find it my uh reminder didn't come in time and so what happened I wanted to bring to you today was actually a letter that a German Commander brought to the US Army in Germany during the World War and the German this was a dark hour this is the Battle of Baston the area there if those of you would know the war would know that they were surrounded they were getting pulverized by artillery and it was basically looking like it was for dead and the Germans sent a letter and they said I will quote the fortune of war is changing this time the USA forces in and nearb stall have um this is very blurry sorry have been ined by strong German armored units more German armored units have crossed the river U uh near uville sorry Jess have taken Marsh and reached St hu by passing through hbre T all these different places there in France and there is only one possibility to save the encircled USA troops from Total Annihilation that is The Honorable surrender of the encircled town in order to think it over a term of two hours will be granted beginning with the presentation of this note if this proposal proposal should be rejected by one German uh rejected one German artillery Corps and six heavy AA battalions are ready to annihilate the USA in and near Baston the order for firing will be given immediately after this two hours term all the serious civilian losses caused by this artillery fire would not correspond with the well-known American Humanity the German Commander and that was presented to some troops and then it went through the whole chain of command to try and find the person that could respond adequately because this is a formal uh letter of surrender and rightly so it was dark it was dismal and it surely looked like it was the end of that of that of the troops there and it went its way to a brigadier general uh um that was was there and moli and he finally got to him and they the report to say and this is verified and he he comes out and they they say his very first words when they said he he asked what was the letter and he said the Germans are asking for your surrender he said oh nutsen like they're crazy that was his very first response I thought my goodness here he's being pulverized the artillery of Baston was just obliterated and he knew exactly his troops was was but deep inside of that General he said this crazy me surrender are you nuts and so then it went through all the different again and trying to find you know this there's a lot of places to go I guess on the front lines to get it through and they finally had to catch Scrat say well well this is formal you know a formal letter what are we going to say formally back to them and he's like well I I don't know you know there was some some some conversation and one of the AIDS said well your first response was pretty good and they're like he's like okay and the official letter that went back to the Germans was typed centered December 22nd 1944 to the German Commander comma enter Nots exclamation mark enter enter the American Commander yeah I thought that's exactly right devil you can be down on us so hard thinking you youve encircled us with your demon troops and you're saying he's telling you listen buddy you ain't going to make it out of here you don't think you can do this I got all that hell on you boy and you ain't going to make it and you know what a child of God says you're nuts devil you're crazy because inside of me is the same God that defeated you at Calvary and so guess where this body's going it's going out of here hallelujah that's what you need to say back to the devil when he starts piling it down on you you just remember the Battle of Bast you say you know what here's the letter back to you nuts amen amen we don't surrender I don't care how dark it is I don't care how dismal it is saints of God here in Elin Never Surrender I wrote down on my notes very specifically I'm going to just skip a whole bunch we don't negotiate we're going to evict you know what I got to tell you right now evict the devil I have right here I searched up the state of Virginia and your eviction laws for squatters what did we have to do to get rid of squ you guys got squatter rights there ain't no squatter rights in heaven I'll tell you that this Heavenly Body this heavenly being right here I might be temporarily on Earth in a shell of flesh but there ain't no squatter rights that pertain to this guy and there ain't no squatter rights that pertain to you I don't care what the state of Virginia says and so I just wrote it out you know notice to vacate as a devil we're evicting you tonight you have no place in God's people people I don't care how big or how many or how how many people are squatting on your land we don't have time to go into it but I'm going to be a Caleb and I'm going to punt him out and so I have the letter for you and it is addressed to Lucifer that old devil and every demon of hell and the address is this son of God right here or that son or daughter of God right there in this present fleshly body here on Earth in Virginia for 2024 to the tenants and all residents and unnamed occupants on the premise located at this body please take notice that under the tency act under which you occupy the hear and described premise there is now due unpaid and delinquent rent in the total sum of the Virgin born blameless blood of God it's time to pay up devil representing payment due for the period from Adam's fall to in time shall be no more then they were giving everybody time they were going to give somebody 5 days notice 7 days notice I said no way there ain't no days notice it's immediately before you walk out these doors from this day forward you are hereby sered notice and required to pay the amount and if you can't pay the above stated rent in full then you must vacate the subject premise and relinquish possession to the owner of Jesus Christ serve him rent serve notice tonight said devil you're a squatter and you've been evicted you can't pay up tonight and I ain't surrendering what God has given me well sir you know this was the enlarged version the version the virgin that the version that the devil heard was it is finished I just gave you a little extra but that's what he heard so we had to enlarge a little bit and translate that to down to Hell's headquarters so they knew exactly what that meant just in case they were confused by that line so I'd say this evening as we close and musicians can come let Faith raise up and let the unction of God go forth from your lips evict the devil Never Never Surrender never give in never give up amen because what's inside of you brother BR says When Faith When Faith looks at God's worst it esteems it Greater and more valuable than the best the world can show that's a powerful quote When Faith looks at God's worst he was talking about Moses as as he looked at the mud and all of that difference and he looked at that and esteemed it greater than the values and the riches of Egypt no matter what you have what you're in how difficult it is look at that and let Faith look at the word of God and say I don't know whatever is happening whatever my circumstance but I'm looking to the word of God no matter what else the devil shows me I say tonight I say for Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle here all hell has assailed you and will continue to assail you but a lighthouse is built on a Rock Amen a lighthouse is built on a rock and I've seen the pictures of a big old Lighthouse and waves come crashing down on it and it exposes as the waves go around the lighthouse it exposes what the foundation is amen when all's calm you just look at the Lighthouse and it's standing there so nicely like well what is the build on I don't know it just looks so beautiful but then the waves start to crash and it just filters all around there and for that moment of a snapshot you see this curl of a wave and then you can see right down to the very base and it's all solid concrete feet upon feet upon feet the foundation is so firm and I tell you that's why H tells you don't don't don't get dismayed don't surrender it's proving to the world it's proving to the devil that your foundation is the rock of Revelation on who you believe I say it's in you it's in you to have Victory it's because Christ in because of him we have the victory because it's our that's where our life for comes from I tell you right now the devil did not have pressure just by reading the words just reading words and Moses then prophesied there was a deliverer would come come from Abraham or sorry Abraham had prophesied that Moses there'd be a deliverer coming after such and such amount of years you know that could have written down and the devil look at that oh interesting but the moment that became flesh now the devil had a problem and so the prophecies in scripture the devil can look at those and be like well that's nice scripture that's that's very nice but suddenly when Isaiah became flesh a virgin shall conceive oh now the devil had pressure now he was being putting backed up against the W wait a second oh dear goodness I didn't really see it that way I didn't know that scripture was going to cause me so much grief look what's been going on through Judea and through Galilee what is going on and the same thing is happening today in this lean age when God has prophesied and sent a message to say there'll be a blameless there'll be a faultless virgin bride in Jesus Christ it's been prophesied that you'll be here and there ain't nothing put the pressure on the devil I say May the brothers and sisters here in Elton Virginia create havoc on the kingdom of hell and darkness it ain't going to press on it might try to press on you but I can tell you I know the image of Samson maybe is a little different in her eyes but maybe just as just for image sake the devil's going to press down and you it's going press I'm just bench pressing the pressure because what's in you is stronger than any force of hell that will come on down at you and in this darkest Tower there's a promise the morning cometh amen arise and shine for your light has come Satan it's time to surrender let's stand tonight God bless you God bless you amen do you know the song Arise possession inheritance do you know that song No know arise possession inheritance you don't know that
