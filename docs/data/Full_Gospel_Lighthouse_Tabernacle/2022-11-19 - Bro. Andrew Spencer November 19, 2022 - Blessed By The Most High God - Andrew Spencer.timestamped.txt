[51:33] what a privilege it is Lord for us to be
[51:36] able to Humble ourselves before you and
[51:38] we are your children and to recognize
[51:40] that you are our father
[51:42] and to see you high and lifted up in the
[51:44] Praises of your people father to
[51:46] recognize this is not a worship of a man
[51:49] but this is the worship of the king the
[51:52] king of kings and the Lord of lords and
[51:54] we have humbled ourselves before you
[51:56] Lord and we recognize that we are
[51:58] insufficient on our own and tonight Lord
[52:00] every hand in this building has went up
[52:02] father because they have a need and
[52:05] they're asking Lord that your spirit
[52:06] would come and minister to them in a
[52:09] very special way tonight and Lord I pray
[52:11] that you just move us aside father and
[52:13] you begin to bless your people through
[52:14] the preaching of the word Lord we've
[52:16] studied these things have been on our
[52:18] heart Lord I pray that you would just
[52:21] take us father and use the human
[52:23] instrument mentality of humanity Lord to
[52:26] bring forth your word and bring an
[52:28] inspiration Lord behind it Lord that
[52:30] will charge the people's Faith Lord we
[52:33] recognize that you're here and you're
[52:34] pulsating to your people and we would
[52:37] ask Lord that you would have your will
[52:38] in your way in this service and we'll be
[52:40] careful to serve you and give you praise
[52:42] honor and Glory all that is due unto
[52:44] your name in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:46] Christ and the church says
[52:49] God bless you this evening if you have
[52:51] your Bibles we'd like to look over in
[52:53] the Book of Genesis
[52:54] Chapter 14 verse 14 and then down to
[52:57] Hebrews chapter 6.
[53:00] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13.
[53:33] isn't he wonderful to us
[53:36] amen Genesis chapter 14 and verse 14.
[53:41] and the Bible says here that when Abram
[53:43] heard that his brother was taken captive
[53:46] he armed his trained servants born in
[53:49] his own house
[53:51] 318 and pursued them unto Dan
[53:54] and he divided himself against them he
[53:58] and his servants by night and smote them
[54:00] and pursued them me
[54:03] unto hoba I hope I said that right which
[54:06] is on the left hand of Damascus and he
[54:10] brought back all the goods and also
[54:13] brought again his brother-in-lawed and
[54:15] his goods and all the women also and the
[54:17] people and the king of Sodom went out to
[54:21] meet him after his return from the
[54:23] slaughter of Shadow Amour and of the
[54:26] kings that were with him at the valley
[54:28] of Shava which is the Kingsdale
[54:31] and Melchizedek king of Salem brought
[54:34] forth Bread and Wine and he was the
[54:36] priest of the most high God and he
[54:38] blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of
[54:42] the most high god possessor of Heaven
[54:44] and Earth
[54:46] and and
[54:47] blessed blessed be the most high God
[54:50] which hath delivered thine enemies into
[54:52] thine hands and he gave him tithes of
[54:55] all and the king of Sodom said unto him
[54:57] unto Abram give me the persons and take
[55:00] the goods to thyself and Abram said to
[55:02] the king of Sodom I have lift up mine
[55:04] hand unto the Lord
[55:06] the most high God the possessor of
[55:08] Heaven and Earth
[55:09] that I will not take from the from a
[55:12] thread even to a shoe latch it and that
[55:16] I will not take anything that is lying
[55:18] lest thou should say I have made Abram
[55:22] Rich Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13.
[55:35] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13. the Bible
[55:38] says here for when God made Abraham made
[55:42] promise to Abraham because he could
[55:44] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[55:47] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[55:50] and multiplying I will multiply thee and
[55:53] so after he had patiently adored he
[55:56] obtained the promise for men verily
[55:59] swear by the greater and oath for
[56:01] confirmation is to them and end of all
[56:04] Strife wherein God willing more
[56:06] abundantly to show unto The Heirs of
[56:08] Promise the immutability the MU
[56:12] help me brother William
[56:14] thank you
[56:18] yeah that's all right
[56:20] y'all know what we're trying to say
[56:22] immutability of his counsel he confirmed
[56:25] it by an oath that by two immutable
[56:27] things in which it was impossible for
[56:30] God to lie we might have a strong
[56:32] consolation who have fled for Refuge to
[56:36] lay hold upon the Hope set before us may
[56:40] God bless his word he may be seated in
[56:42] the presence of the Lord
[56:44] I'd like to just look reference back
[56:46] again in Genesis chapter 14 and verse 19
[56:49] that he or Verse 18 in Melchizedek king
[56:52] of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine
[56:54] and he was the priest of the most high
[56:56] God and he blessed him and said Blessed
[56:58] Be Abram of the most high god possessor
[57:01] of Heaven and Earth and I'd like to take
[57:04] for a text this evening on blessed by
[57:07] the most high blessed by the most high
[57:10] God and here in the church age book you
[57:13] see he said now you'll notice that Jesus
[57:15] is walking alone in the midst of the
[57:17] churches he said there is no one else
[57:19] with him neither indeed can there be for
[57:22] he alone or her salvation and having
[57:25] purchased her with his own blood he owns
[57:28] her he is her Lord and Master she gives
[57:31] him all the glory and that Glory he will
[57:34] not share with any other there is no
[57:37] Pope with him there is no Archbishop
[57:39] Bishop with him Mary the mother of his
[57:42] Earthly body is not with him he does not
[57:44] speak and turn to a father for he is the
[57:46] father he does not turn to give orders
[57:49] to a holy spirit for he is God eternal
[57:51] spirit and it is his life that is
[57:54] flowing and pulsating in the church
[57:55] giving her life and without him there
[57:58] would be no life salvation is of the
[58:01] Lord there was no one with him when he
[58:03] trod the fierce he trod the fierceness
[58:05] of the Wrath of the fiery furnace it was
[58:08] not another but him who hung up on the
[58:10] cross and gave his blood he is the
[58:13] author and the finisher of our faith he
[58:16] is the Alpha and Omega of our Salvation
[58:19] we are espoused to him and not another
[58:21] we don't belong to the church we belong
[58:24] to him can we say that together we
[58:27] belong to him his word is law Creeds and
[58:31] dogmas bylaws and constitutions have no
[58:33] effect on us yes it is Jesus alone who
[58:36] walks in the midst of the churches it is
[58:39] God in her willing and doing of his good
[58:41] pleasure never forget that you have only
[58:44] one relationship to God and God has only
[58:47] one relationship to you and that is
[58:50] Jesus and Jesus alone
[58:53] we only have one relationship to God and
[58:56] that is Jesus and Jesus alone as we said
[58:59] we'd like to speak to you on blessed by
[59:01] the most high God if you go to studying
[59:03] out the Bible and I'm just going to if
[59:05] you want to keep your Bible and your
[59:06] pins handy tonight I'm going to go
[59:08] through some scriptures but if you go to
[59:10] studying out in the Bible and go to
[59:11] studying out the names or the titles of
[59:13] God that God begins to reveal himself
[59:15] you'll find that God would declare
[59:17] himself in many different titles or many
[59:20] different names that he would Express to
[59:22] his children during a certain season or
[59:25] a certain time that they were in and if
[59:27] you'll go to stunning out the first part
[59:29] of the Book of Genesis that you'll find
[59:31] that God reveals himself using four
[59:34] names that are given to each of who of
[59:37] which reveals some distinct attribute of
[59:40] God at that time they are Elohim God
[59:43] lord Jehovah God Almighty El shadiyai
[59:48] which means god almighty and the most
[59:51] high which is El Elliot so there is
[59:53] follow him there is Jehovah there is El
[59:56] shadiyah and there is El eleon that God
[59:59] at the very first part of the Book of
[1:00:01] Genesis that God begins to reveal
[1:00:03] himself through those names and we can
[1:00:06] say that we recognize that he is Jehovah
[1:00:09] we recognize he is Elohim he is the
[1:00:12] self-existing one he is the almighty El
[1:00:15] Shaddai and he is El Elion the most high
[1:00:18] God and we recognize that that the very
[1:00:21] the the scripture reading that our
[1:00:22] pastor has taught us to read every day
[1:00:25] before we go out to work if Psalms 91
[1:00:28] that that all four of these names are
[1:00:30] described in Psalms 91 verse 1 and 2
[1:00:34] that he that dwelleth in the secret of
[1:00:36] the most high El helion shall shall
[1:00:40] abide under the shadow of el shadiyah
[1:00:43] and I will say of Jehovah he is my
[1:00:46] refuge and my Fortress and my Elohim in
[1:00:50] I him in my God in whom I will trust so
[1:00:54] we recognize that God is declaring
[1:00:57] himself as The Great I Am he's not a God
[1:01:00] that's often a distance somewhere but
[1:01:02] he's a god that is very present right
[1:01:04] here so let me let me just set this set
[1:01:07] this in course tonight on the most high
[1:01:09] God there is nothing that can escape the
[1:01:12] bounds of our God you see whatever you
[1:01:15] have need of is in our God and he
[1:01:18] declares himself as the great Jehovah
[1:01:21] and we recognize that when he would come
[1:01:23] and he would declare himself that
[1:01:25] Jehovah has seven compound names that
[1:01:28] reveal him as meeting every single need
[1:01:31] of humanity do you recognize that
[1:01:34] whatever you have need of in your body
[1:01:36] that there is a declaration where God
[1:01:39] would come and he would reveal himself
[1:01:41] in the seven compound names of Jehovah
[1:01:44] which is Jehovah Jireh the Lord and
[1:01:47] we'll provide Jehovah Ray father the
[1:01:49] Lord at that healeth thee Jehovah Nissi
[1:01:51] the Lord our Banner Jehovah Shalom the
[1:01:54] Lord our peace Jehovah Allah the Lord is
[1:01:58] my shepherd Jehovah tiskanu the Lord is
[1:02:01] our righteousness Jehovah's shama the
[1:02:03] Lord is present and we recognize that
[1:02:06] all of those seven compound names are
[1:02:09] wrapped together in the one holy name it
[1:02:12] is the name that is above every other
[1:02:13] name it is a name where men should be
[1:02:16] saved and only can be saved by that name
[1:02:19] and it is the name of Jesus Christ that
[1:02:22] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[1:02:24] that shall confess now we recognize that
[1:02:27] he is that's what the Bible has told us
[1:02:30] that elohion it's translated in the
[1:02:33] Bible that he is the most high God El is
[1:02:36] shortened from the form of Elohim and it
[1:02:39] speaks of God's strength but early on
[1:02:42] when it's placed together it means he is
[1:02:45] the strongest one it means that he is
[1:02:48] the most high God that means that there
[1:02:50] is nothing above him there is nothing
[1:02:52] that can get higher above him he is the
[1:02:56] strong one there's not a devil in hell
[1:02:58] that is stronger than our God there's
[1:03:00] not a devil in hell that can reach above
[1:03:02] the highest of our God
[1:03:05] El eleon knows it no bounds
[1:03:09] do you recognize tonight that your God
[1:03:11] knows no bounds when we have inhumanity
[1:03:14] things that we set at boundaries or
[1:03:16] things that we put outside of a box or
[1:03:19] things that we think are kind of out of
[1:03:20] our out of our realm of reaching there
[1:03:23] is no bounds to our God there is nothing
[1:03:25] out of the way of el eleon and I want to
[1:03:28] say this to you that you have been
[1:03:30] blessed by l-leon you see the authority
[1:03:34] of the most high God it transcends
[1:03:36] borders between nations it transcends
[1:03:40] Between Heaven and Earth between spirits
[1:03:42] and beings of physical beings and
[1:03:45] supernatural beings The Authority the
[1:03:48] authority of the most high God it
[1:03:50] transcends between angels and demons and
[1:03:53] between humans and animals his authority
[1:03:56] and Dominion span time and distance
[1:03:58] alike there is nothing and no one that
[1:04:01] does not fall within his domain and his
[1:04:04] jurisdiction so what I'm saying to you
[1:04:07] tonight there is no devil in hell that
[1:04:09] is safe here tonight in the house of God
[1:04:12] there's no devil there's no demon
[1:04:14] there's no power that is safe here
[1:04:17] because they are under the jurisdiction
[1:04:19] of almighty God do you recognize that
[1:04:22] every demon I say that is insufficient
[1:04:25] when they come up against El Elion
[1:04:28] they are under the jurisdiction
[1:04:31] of almighty God who is the possessor of
[1:04:35] Heaven and Earth and I'll tell you how
[1:04:37] high our God is that Satan God's Arch
[1:04:40] Enemy he wants and he wanted to be like
[1:04:43] the most high God you recognize how
[1:04:46] great your God is if you're great you
[1:04:48] will draw men to you but do you
[1:04:50] recognize that there was such a power in
[1:04:53] almighty God that his very Arch Enemy
[1:04:57] the one that he created to be the
[1:04:59] worship leader in heaven the one that
[1:05:01] was the chief cherubim he was he was the
[1:05:05] one that watched God as he was as he was
[1:05:07] there in creation he watched God In
[1:05:09] Worship
[1:05:11] and he recognized that there was a power
[1:05:14] that he had wanted to attain for himself
[1:05:16] but you notice what the Bible says in
[1:05:18] Isaiah 14 that how are thou fallen from
[1:05:21] Heaven o Lucifer oh son of the morning
[1:05:24] how are thou cut down to the ground
[1:05:25] which did his weaken the Nations for
[1:05:28] thou Hast said in thy heart now notice I
[1:05:30] will ascended to the heavens and I will
[1:05:32] exalt my throne above the stars of God
[1:05:34] that's above you that's what he was
[1:05:36] trying to do
[1:05:37] I will exalt my Throne against above the
[1:05:40] stars of God and I will sit also upon
[1:05:42] the Mount of the congregation in the
[1:05:44] sides of the north and I will Ascend
[1:05:46] above the heights of the clouds and I
[1:05:49] will be like the most high God do you
[1:05:52] recognize that this power that El eleon
[1:05:55] has Satan has desired from the very
[1:05:59] beginning once he watched him in power
[1:06:01] he desired that power like El Eleanor
[1:06:07] yet thou Hast been brought down to think
[1:06:10] that this one that wanted to be like God
[1:06:12] has been brought down to Hell and to the
[1:06:15] sides of the pit and to think that the
[1:06:17] one that is tormented you the one that's
[1:06:19] given you mind battles the one that's
[1:06:21] given you pain in your body the one
[1:06:23] that's giving you backaches ones that's
[1:06:25] given you migraine the one that's made
[1:06:27] your pastor sick the one that's made
[1:06:29] your family sick the one that's come in
[1:06:31] and he's tried to kill you tried to
[1:06:33] steal from you try to destroy your
[1:06:35] family now try to destroy your try to
[1:06:38] destroy your marriage and destroy your
[1:06:40] prayer life and destroy everything about
[1:06:42] you notice what the Bible says that they
[1:06:45] shall see thee that they that shall see
[1:06:48] thee shall narrowly look upon me and
[1:06:51] consider these saying is this the man
[1:06:54] you think what he was kicked out of
[1:06:56] heaven he lost his position but he still
[1:06:59] has power but you as Sons and Daughters
[1:07:02] of God of Ilion
[1:07:04] narrowly look upon Him is this the man
[1:07:09] is this the one that made me fall is
[1:07:11] this the one that gave me bad dreams is
[1:07:13] this the one that made my pastor sick is
[1:07:16] this the one
[1:07:18] he wanted to be like your Jehovah he
[1:07:20] wanted to be like El eleon but there is
[1:07:23] a power in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:07:26] that they look upon this one and said
[1:07:29] who is this is this the one that made me
[1:07:31] sick
[1:07:35] is this the man that made the Earth
[1:07:37] tremble and that did Shake kingdoms
[1:07:41] to think that you'll narrowly look on
[1:07:42] him and think my what a worm
[1:07:47] now how does Satan get back up there in
[1:07:49] the heavens if he's if he's been kicked
[1:07:50] out
[1:07:51] how's he get back up there it's because
[1:07:54] your faith in him in believing what he
[1:07:56] said about you putting doubts and
[1:07:58] feeders in your mind without things that
[1:08:00] are up there but I want you to go over
[1:08:02] in Revelations chapter 5. you'll notice
[1:08:05] Satan tries to put himself above you but
[1:08:07] if you go over to Revelation chapter 5
[1:08:09] you don't even you look at the elders
[1:08:12] you look at the worship person you look
[1:08:14] at God you look at the lamb there but
[1:08:16] there is one that is not in the picture
[1:08:19] your accuser's not in the picture
[1:08:21] Satan's not in the picture he can't get
[1:08:24] to where you are with a release book as
[1:08:27] the body of Jesus Christ the seals have
[1:08:30] been ripped off of it and you have full
[1:08:32] adore Authority Under the adoption of
[1:08:35] sons of God
[1:08:38] say well what Satan was wanting to do he
[1:08:41] was wanting to get the most powerful
[1:08:42] people on Earth the sons of God to
[1:08:45] worship Him
[1:08:48] to steal God's worship now how does he
[1:08:51] do that
[1:08:52] by taking this Bible
[1:08:55] by taking the book that you read and
[1:08:58] putting man's ideas upon it and bringing
[1:09:00] forth a powerless religion and bringing
[1:09:03] forth intellectual conceptions and ideas
[1:09:05] of thoughts of man and he brings about
[1:09:08] and he Waters down the gospel that
[1:09:11] everybody's okay
[1:09:13] everybody loves everybody and he brings
[1:09:16] in a worship through a charismatic move
[1:09:19] and he tries to rob the children of God
[1:09:22] from who they are
[1:09:24] but I'll let me let me let me quote a
[1:09:26] prophet to you he said God hates a
[1:09:28] powerless religion he said it's got to
[1:09:30] have power in it it's got to have
[1:09:32] sincerity because sincerity brings power
[1:09:35] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[1:09:38] with genuine power worship to know that
[1:09:40] you've passed from death into life God
[1:09:42] wants to perform his word by his power
[1:09:45] and when the church denies his power how
[1:09:47] can he perform and vindicate his word he
[1:09:50] said when the church explains it away it
[1:09:52] says it's for some other day and
[1:09:54] something how can God who wants to
[1:09:56] fulfill his word and perform his word
[1:09:58] amongst the people
[1:10:00] to think that God wants that in a people
[1:10:04] now brother man I'm sitting now he said
[1:10:06] there's been churches churches there's
[1:10:08] been Brides brides but there's coming
[1:10:09] one on earth that'll be both both
[1:10:11] mechanics and Dynamics I want to say
[1:10:14] that she is on Earth she has sincerity
[1:10:18] so she has power she has power so she
[1:10:21] has real worship she has real worship so
[1:10:24] Eliana is in her midst
[1:10:29] notice
[1:10:31] notice when what he when he called
[1:10:33] Abraham Abraham was called before he got
[1:10:37] here
[1:10:39] before his father which was always a fly
[1:10:42] in the soup always a hair and a biscuit
[1:10:45] always getting himself getting himself
[1:10:47] mixed up Abraham was chosen
[1:10:51] and God Is So seen you
[1:10:53] even when it looked like your life was a
[1:10:55] hair and a biscuit God chose you
[1:10:58] even when you didn't look like you were
[1:10:59] faithful God chose you but notice what
[1:11:02] what he says here he said he didn't he
[1:11:05] gave him the Covenant unconditionally he
[1:11:07] said not because Abraham was Abraham he
[1:11:09] gave Abraham the Covenant because God
[1:11:12] himself chose Abraham and elected him
[1:11:14] before the foundation of the world you
[1:11:16] see it was by Grace he chose Abraham and
[1:11:19] not only Abraham but Abraham seed after
[1:11:22] him you see your choice had nothing to
[1:11:25] do with this
[1:11:27] it was not you that had anything to do
[1:11:30] with this God chose you before you could
[1:11:32] ever have a choice the Bible said in
[1:11:35] Romans 9 11 that he saw a hate and Jacob
[1:11:38] I love to think that God chose you when
[1:11:41] you were unworthy when nobody else
[1:11:43] wanted you in church when nobody else
[1:11:45] thought that you serve God God chose you
[1:11:52] rub that robot showed up that
[1:11:53] neighborhood God chose me
[1:11:58] now you wrote my wife's shoulder
[1:12:01] you can't unchoose me because God chose
[1:12:03] me
[1:12:06] but you see
[1:12:07] it could go places let's have let's have
[1:12:09] church here
[1:12:12] but
[1:12:13] no matter how far you got
[1:12:16] no matter how far you could have gotten
[1:12:18] sin no matter how deep you got in sin
[1:12:20] know how big a mess you got in God told
[1:12:23] you but God didn't call you to to to
[1:12:26] congeal to mix with the crowd he called
[1:12:29] you to be separators and that's exactly
[1:12:32] what God told Abraham to do from the
[1:12:35] very beginning was to separate himself
[1:12:37] from Friends separate himself from
[1:12:39] family separate himself from all of the
[1:12:42] things that he once knew Abraham loved
[1:12:45] the life that he lived in Abraham loved
[1:12:47] the land that he lived here it's hard to
[1:12:49] move but God called him to move
[1:12:52] God called him to a land you didn't move
[1:12:55] here you didn't move to this message the
[1:12:59] message called you
[1:13:06] but when you lose your friends
[1:13:09] when you lose your family
[1:13:12] God will be your friend
[1:13:15] when friends walk away from you
[1:13:17] Abraham had a friend when he lost his
[1:13:21] father when he lost his land when he
[1:13:23] lost what he knew was dear to him
[1:13:25] Abraham had a friend
[1:13:28] and you can search all the Bible out and
[1:13:31] you can find that the Bible said that
[1:13:33] Abraham was a friend of God you can
[1:13:36] search it all the way from the Old
[1:13:37] Testament all the way into the Book of
[1:13:39] James and you'll find that the Bible
[1:13:41] tells us that Abraham was called a
[1:13:44] friend of God now there's a lot of
[1:13:46] friends that I have in life there's too
[1:13:48] many to number all of you are my closest
[1:13:50] friends but if you think about all of
[1:13:52] the friends that you have in this world
[1:13:53] but to think that God is your friend
[1:13:57] it wonderful to have Jesus as your
[1:13:59] friend it did wonderful to know that
[1:14:02] when everybody walks away from you and
[1:14:04] when you've been called to separate that
[1:14:06] God is your friend
[1:14:08] you know that even the Israelites
[1:14:10] reminded God who he was and who they
[1:14:14] were and that they were the children of
[1:14:16] Abraham and that he was Abraham's friend
[1:14:19] and that there was a promise over
[1:14:21] Abraham's seed
[1:14:23] that's exactly what they did that's what
[1:14:26] they did in second chronicles 20 and 7
[1:14:28] are not thou o God our God who did his
[1:14:31] drive out the inhabitants of this land
[1:14:33] before thy People Israel and gave us at
[1:14:36] the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever
[1:14:39] you see there's going to come some times
[1:14:41] in your life as a friend you're going to
[1:14:44] have to remind your friend what he has
[1:14:46] said about you
[1:14:48] it's okay to remind him that he was
[1:14:51] beaten for you it's okay to remind him
[1:14:54] that he took those stripes for you it's
[1:14:56] okay your friend remembers
[1:14:59] Hallelujah I wish I wish I had enough
[1:15:03] voice and enough energy to tear down
[1:15:05] every little piece of it's two by four
[1:15:07] in this place tonight because I
[1:15:09] recognize that if Ella Elliot the most
[1:15:12] high God is your friend
[1:15:15] if he's your friend it doesn't matter
[1:15:18] what comes
[1:15:19] [Applause]
[1:15:24] he's your friend in Good Times he's
[1:15:27] friend when you got Prosperity his
[1:15:29] friend when you ain't got money he's
[1:15:30] friend when you got food he's friend
[1:15:32] when you ain't got food he's friend when
[1:15:34] you ain't got no friends each friend
[1:15:36] when the friends are there he is your
[1:15:38] friend
[1:15:41] and brother random told us that Abraham
[1:15:44] was such a friend to God
[1:15:46] that he knew how to take the promise
[1:15:49] because Abraham knew the nature of God
[1:15:52] now you're talking about a friendship
[1:15:55] now I've got friends and I won't call
[1:15:58] nobody's name right here
[1:16:00] but I've got friends here that have
[1:16:05] have words sometimes that come out wrong
[1:16:11] and because I'm their friend I know
[1:16:14] exactly what they're saying without them
[1:16:15] saying it you know what I'm saying
[1:16:19] because I know the nature of the person
[1:16:22] it might come out one way but it's a God
[1:16:25] he me or the person means it a certain
[1:16:27] way and Abraham was such a friend to God
[1:16:30] that he knew the very nature of his
[1:16:32] promise even when Sarah his closest high
[1:16:36] on Earth was making fun and saying well
[1:16:38] look man it's been 25 years
[1:16:41] promised that that 25 years ago but
[1:16:44] Abraham had such a friendship
[1:16:48] you're talking about somebody that's
[1:16:49] your friend and early on do you know
[1:16:52] what I'm saying to you tonight there is
[1:16:55] nothing too high for your friend
[1:16:57] now I'm gonna tell you right now we've
[1:16:58] had a whole lot of short jokes in our
[1:17:00] family
[1:17:08] I was even working today but thank God
[1:17:11] God gave me a gentle giant by the name
[1:17:14] of Josh Jones
[1:17:15] there are things in my family that we
[1:17:18] can't reach
[1:17:19] because they are DNA markers that won't
[1:17:22] let us get over six foot tall
[1:17:25] but I got a friend
[1:17:27] and I don't get thinking about that
[1:17:29] today while I was unloading that box
[1:17:30] truck and I thought there are things
[1:17:33] there's no way that I can reach up there
[1:17:37] but brother Josh has got the authority
[1:17:40] because he's got the body to be able to
[1:17:43] reach up there and I'm beginning to
[1:17:45] think about that in the spiritual to
[1:17:47] think that we have a friend there is
[1:17:50] nothing too high out of the reach of
[1:17:52] almighty God it seems like cancer may be
[1:17:55] winning in this layout of seeing age but
[1:17:58] there is nothing too high for El Eleanor
[1:18:01] there is nothing too strong that he
[1:18:04] can't whip because the Bible tells us
[1:18:06] that the word of God will whip the devil
[1:18:08] any time any place under any situation
[1:18:11] because he's a saint yesterday today and
[1:18:14] forever if you need something up high
[1:18:16] and it seems like it can't reach you and
[1:18:19] you seem like he can't get around it ill
[1:18:21] early on is your friend
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:30] I'm gonna tell you
[1:18:33] there's no way I'm going to get through
[1:18:35] with this tonight so we're going to find
[1:18:36] a good resting spot and we're going to
[1:18:38] close it I'm not going to close right
[1:18:39] now don't get done don't get too excited
[1:18:42] don't pack your purse up yet
[1:18:45] I know it's cold outside but don't put
[1:18:47] it on yet I still got some more paper to
[1:18:49] throw at you but you begin to think
[1:18:51] about this and put it into perspective
[1:18:53] without getting too far into my into my
[1:18:55] thought here but do you begin to put it
[1:18:57] into perspective that the most high God
[1:18:59] is your friend and to think that that
[1:19:01] the Bible tells us in Proverbs 18 and 24
[1:19:04] that a man that shows himself friendly
[1:19:06] will have friends and he said well I
[1:19:08] ain't got a liquor friends I ain't got
[1:19:09] nobody loves me if you have you ever
[1:19:11] tried showing yourself friendly you want
[1:19:13] to have friends so yourself friendly you
[1:19:16] want to have somebody love you show
[1:19:17] yourself that you can be loved but the
[1:19:20] Bible tells us that there is a friend
[1:19:22] that sticketh closer than a brother to
[1:19:25] think that I'm close to my brother or a
[1:19:27] master today and I'm close to my brother
[1:19:29] William today because there is such a
[1:19:31] tie in the Earthly that we cannot be
[1:19:34] there's a bound that cannot be broken
[1:19:36] but to think that Jesus Christ
[1:19:40] the most high
[1:19:42] is your friend
[1:19:48] I got some Giants to squash tonight
[1:19:51] so let me throw this big rock of
[1:19:54] Revelation into this into the eye of
[1:19:57] Satan that says you have no friends
[1:20:02] that wants to tell our young girls that
[1:20:04] they cannot be loved that wants to tell
[1:20:07] our young boys that they've got to go
[1:20:09] the way of Laos here to have friends
[1:20:11] with the world you got to be popular
[1:20:13] with the world that's absolutely
[1:20:15] contrary when the most high is your
[1:20:17] friend when it don't look like the world
[1:20:19] is with you why don't you shut why don't
[1:20:22] you shut that demon that says you have
[1:20:25] no friends shut it down with the
[1:20:27] Friendship of Ireland
[1:20:36] thank you
[1:20:40] hey everybody
[1:20:41] I know what it's like to have friends
[1:20:43] but I know what it's like not to have
[1:20:45] friends
[1:20:49] you ever been in that spot where you
[1:20:50] ain't got a friend that you can talk to
[1:20:53] even though you can be the most
[1:20:55] friendliest person that there is it
[1:20:56] seems like nobody wants nothing to do
[1:20:58] with you ever been there
[1:21:00] foreign
[1:21:02] I know I'm talking to you
[1:21:04] you can be the class clown and you think
[1:21:10] a French
[1:21:12] but sometimes friends will walk away
[1:21:14] from you
[1:21:15] but this friend
[1:21:21] when your pastor can't get on the phone
[1:21:23] and talk with you and they can't talk
[1:21:25] you through what you're going through
[1:21:26] there's a friend
[1:21:28] and Abraham had a friend and almighty
[1:21:31] God
[1:21:32] and to think that Abraham had such a
[1:21:35] friendship that he would raise all of
[1:21:38] those all of the servants that was
[1:21:40] raised up in his household he would
[1:21:42] raise them and they were placed under
[1:21:44] the same Covenant that Abraham was under
[1:21:47] to think that Abraham when his when his
[1:21:50] brother lot his nephew got out there in
[1:21:52] trouble and he went down there as
[1:21:54] bachelin his backslidden brother went
[1:21:56] out there Abraham brought his 318 male
[1:22:00] servants that was raised in his house
[1:22:04] now do you people of the South that love
[1:22:05] the South I can go in there and throw
[1:22:07] you a quote that brother Burnham told
[1:22:08] you that God that he went in there and
[1:22:10] brought his Confederate Army with him he
[1:22:12] went over there and he took us 318 men
[1:22:14] and his Confederate Army out there and
[1:22:16] he went back there after after after a
[1:22:19] shelter more he went in there and took
[1:22:22] everything away these nine kings that
[1:22:25] had taken everything away from lot and
[1:22:28] went in there and built a community
[1:22:29] together and they they stole everything
[1:22:32] that was from lot but to think that all
[1:22:35] of these men that Abraham had brought to
[1:22:38] himself they were under the same
[1:22:40] circumcision Covenant that Abraham was
[1:22:42] under they were faithful and they was
[1:22:45] born in his own house and those that are
[1:22:47] born again by the father above you are
[1:22:50] under the same Covenant that Paul was
[1:22:53] under
[1:22:54] you're under the same Covenant that
[1:22:55] Peter was Hunter and to think that all
[1:22:58] of those promises that was laying there
[1:23:00] for Abraham was laying there for those
[1:23:03] 318 male servants
[1:23:06] but you watch the purpose of Abraham he
[1:23:09] wasn't going over there to get rich
[1:23:12] he wasn't going over there but he had
[1:23:14] one purpose and that was to bring back
[1:23:17] his back-slidden brother and he pursued
[1:23:20] all of them with just these 318 men
[1:23:23] after 9 to 15 kings that had went over
[1:23:26] there and noticed what he did he
[1:23:29] overcome them because he was under a
[1:23:31] covenant I want you to recognize that
[1:23:34] before you ever met Melchizedek you were
[1:23:37] blessed because you are chosen you
[1:23:41] notice what a perfect picture it was of
[1:23:43] Christ when Abraham went over there
[1:23:45] after his backslitting brother what was
[1:23:47] it it was exactly what our Lord Jesus
[1:23:49] Christ would do and he's here tonight
[1:23:51] and he's leading the faithful that's
[1:23:54] born in the same house of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:56] where Christ was born and pursuing the
[1:23:59] Wayward and backslin
[1:24:01] he's slaying every evil thought and he's
[1:24:03] slaying everything that's trying to
[1:24:05] overcome you
[1:24:07] because they were servants
[1:24:09] of the most high God
[1:24:12] now I'm Gonna Roll through some things
[1:24:13] right here but you begin to recognize
[1:24:15] that the three Hebrew children that they
[1:24:18] were called the Servants of the most
[1:24:20] high God when they wouldn't bow to the
[1:24:22] image of Daniel they said we don't know
[1:24:24] whether our God will but we know that
[1:24:26] he's more than able to Deliver Us from
[1:24:28] this fiery furnace you're reminded that
[1:24:31] the King Nebuchadnezzar looked down in
[1:24:33] there and he seen the Servants of elihan
[1:24:36] walking in the midst of the fire he said
[1:24:39] but I see one likened to the Son of God
[1:24:42] that's walking in the midst of the fire
[1:24:44] with them
[1:24:45] so when Elion is with you you can come
[1:24:48] out of the fire and don't even smell
[1:24:50] like burning you don't even smell like
[1:24:52] fire I'll say this that you can go
[1:24:54] through the smoke or the bottomless pit
[1:24:57] that's raised its ugly head in this day
[1:24:59] and you can come out of laodicea with
[1:25:02] flying colors
[1:25:07] Satan knows
[1:25:08] Who You Are
[1:25:11] Satan knows who you are and he
[1:25:14] recognizes that the power of Jesus
[1:25:16] Christ is greater than he is
[1:25:19] and the power that's living on the
[1:25:21] inside of you is greater than everything
[1:25:23] that the Prince of Darkness has to think
[1:25:26] that there is deity dwelling in human
[1:25:29] flesh today
[1:25:31] now notice he said now if you'll believe
[1:25:34] that he's here his presence is here he
[1:25:37] said you believe that he's here now he's
[1:25:39] dealing with the patient he said it's a
[1:25:40] cancerous condition he said in that man
[1:25:42] sitting right there has the same thing
[1:25:44] he said them demons are screaming to one
[1:25:47] another you see for pity they're
[1:25:49] screaming for Mercy they're calling he
[1:25:51] said but so is the angels of God call
[1:25:53] him the battle is here he said but your
[1:25:56] faith will determine which way it goes
[1:26:02] laughs
[1:26:04] let me let me draw something to you just
[1:26:07] just before I go on in my thought
[1:26:12] that LL eon
[1:26:14] is in you
[1:26:19] the most high
[1:26:21] is in you
[1:26:26] and there are days when you can't feel
[1:26:28] like you feel like you can't get out of
[1:26:30] bed
[1:26:31] there are days when you wake up and
[1:26:33] you're worried
[1:26:35] but early on lives there
[1:26:38] it doesn't change your position because
[1:26:41] the way you feel
[1:26:43] Hellion lives there
[1:26:45] doesn't change that early on lives there
[1:26:48] when the money has ran out of your bank
[1:26:51] account it doesn't change that early on
[1:26:53] lives on the inside of your heart
[1:26:55] whether Satan's beating you or whether
[1:26:58] Satan's scared of you Elian lives there
[1:27:01] it doesn't change the facts whether the
[1:27:04] doctors give you good news or they give
[1:27:06] you bad news ill Elion lives in you
[1:27:11] it doesn't change the facts whether the
[1:27:14] whether your car breaks down Elion lives
[1:27:17] in you it doesn't change the fact when
[1:27:20] friends walk away from you l-alion
[1:27:28] what was an atom
[1:27:32] that would occur that would that would
[1:27:34] control
[1:27:36] and move the atmospheres and move the
[1:27:38] winds it was iwellian
[1:27:42] now you can go study out the Bible it's
[1:27:44] one of my favorite favorite readings
[1:27:46] it's Deuteronomy 28 9 we'll take you all
[1:27:48] the way through it
[1:27:49] but do you recognize that all of the
[1:27:52] blessings of Deuteronomy 28 come from
[1:27:55] Eliana
[1:27:57] to think that all of those blessings
[1:27:59] that I Will Bless thee when you come in
[1:28:01] and I will bless you when you go out
[1:28:02] that I will make you the head and I will
[1:28:04] make you the tale and it didn't matter
[1:28:06] whether Joshua felt like he was going
[1:28:08] into the promised land there was a
[1:28:10] blessing of Elian that was laying there
[1:28:14] when the ten spies turned their back on
[1:28:17] Joshua and Caleb and Eleanor still had a
[1:28:20] covenant that I am going to be with you
[1:28:23] with Abraham and his seat after him
[1:28:27] Hallelujah the land looked like he would
[1:28:30] conquer them but Elian said you'll
[1:28:33] conquer the land
[1:28:34] it looked like the Giants would conquer
[1:28:36] them and they looked like a bunch of
[1:28:38] grasshoppers in their sight it sounded
[1:28:42] it sounded too good to be true but El
[1:28:45] Elion remembered what he said about them
[1:28:48] and L Ellie on remembers what he said
[1:28:52] about you
[1:28:55] I want you
[1:28:57] I'm just because I'm gonna pray I'm
[1:28:58] gonna preach this for a little I'm gonna
[1:29:00] preach this for a couple weeks
[1:29:03] but uh Lord will unless y'all pull it
[1:29:07] all out of me tonight if y'all do that
[1:29:08] y'all pulled 82 Pages out of me
[1:29:11] please don't I want to be I want to
[1:29:14] leave here in my own car not a body bag
[1:29:16] laughs
[1:29:19] but I want you to notice 318 servants
[1:29:22] they go in and they take what they they
[1:29:26] went in there and they were looking for
[1:29:27] one they were looking for a lot and his
[1:29:29] family and everything that belonged to
[1:29:31] him brother Reuben and they went in
[1:29:33] there and got what they came for you see
[1:29:36] they went in there with a purpose in
[1:29:38] mind that they were going to restore lot
[1:29:40] to from his Fallen condition and they
[1:29:43] went in there and they won the victory
[1:29:45] now I don't know I don't you don't you
[1:29:46] know what victory means it means to
[1:29:49] defeat your enemy and to think they went
[1:29:51] in there under Covenant they went in
[1:29:54] there and when they got on the outside
[1:29:55] of that Covenant when they got excuse me
[1:29:57] when they got back after the victory had
[1:29:59] already been won then they have a
[1:30:01] meeting of meetings
[1:30:04] how many won something this week
[1:30:07] I ain't talking about something on the
[1:30:08] radio
[1:30:10] I ain't talking about something
[1:30:12] but I made one a real battle that Satan
[1:30:15] didn't win that Satan said he would
[1:30:17] destroy you
[1:30:19] I had the devil tell me this week I
[1:30:21] wouldn't make it back here but look
[1:30:22] who's still standing
[1:30:25] you notice they went out with one
[1:30:27] purpose and they came back and they
[1:30:29] restored exactly what they went out for
[1:30:32] but notice what happened after the
[1:30:36] victory had been won
[1:30:38] now this is a if you go to studying out
[1:30:40] history this is the very first battle
[1:30:42] that's ever laid out in the scriptures
[1:30:46] it's the first battle that's ever been
[1:30:48] recorded of the wars in history and for
[1:30:51] the very first time in human Affairs
[1:30:53] this was the celebration of Victory all
[1:30:57] right
[1:31:00] I'm talking to a bunch of angels y'all
[1:31:02] don't know how to have a party
[1:31:05] but this is Abraham and I you know
[1:31:08] sometimes sometimes if you've won
[1:31:13] I'm sorry too much Humanity going on up
[1:31:16] here
[1:31:18] but you ever win something man and call
[1:31:21] your name out
[1:31:23] I ain't never won anything
[1:31:28] today
[1:31:32] and you can sit there as a most dry-eyed
[1:31:36] sanctimonious donkey but when you win
[1:31:39] something
[1:31:42] you know I find it amazing it's these
[1:31:45] people that want to shut down emotion
[1:31:46] you let them win one time
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:51] call their name at a raffle and you'll
[1:31:54] see if they don't believe in Emotion
[1:31:55] call their name
[1:31:57] you'll find out whether they believe in
[1:31:59] emotion or not but Abraham this is the
[1:32:02] very first time in history give me a
[1:32:04] little bit of Liberty here it's the very
[1:32:06] first time in history that there's ever
[1:32:08] been a battle it's the very first time
[1:32:10] that they ever had to battle but this is
[1:32:13] the very first time that they come back
[1:32:15] packing a victory and I don't believe
[1:32:17] Abraham just sat around but I believe
[1:32:21] that he had himself a party
[1:32:25] I believe that he had himself a good old
[1:32:28] dance and he had himself a good old
[1:32:30] shout because he came back with what he
[1:32:34] went in for
[1:32:39] let me preach to you right here who
[1:32:42] you're parting with now I better not say
[1:32:44] it like that somebody on the internet
[1:32:46] shut me down but I know I'm okay here
[1:32:48] but who you're celebrating with is
[1:32:50] Melchizedek
[1:32:53] hallelujah oh you are in Victory with is
[1:32:56] Melchizedek he is the priest of the most
[1:32:59] high God it didn't matter what the Three
[1:33:02] Kings or the nine Kings or the 15 kings
[1:33:05] that about them
[1:33:07] they said and Abraham wouldn't bring
[1:33:09] back lot but do you think Abraham cared
[1:33:12] when he was over there celebrating with
[1:33:14] Melchizedek
[1:33:21] you see what happened who came out to
[1:33:24] meet him
[1:33:26] who met you after the seals who met you
[1:33:29] after full restoration who met you after
[1:33:31] the restoration of the gifts back in the
[1:33:33] body
[1:33:34] there's a lot of people that want to
[1:33:35] shut down the move of God and they want
[1:33:37] to shut down the gifts of God but we are
[1:33:40] a people that have been restored back to
[1:33:43] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers I
[1:33:46] feel I feel a charge of Ten Thousand
[1:33:48] Angels up here we have been restored
[1:33:50] back we have been the seals have been
[1:33:53] released we have an open book in hand
[1:33:55] it's not a king sword but it's the
[1:33:58] king's sword
[1:34:00] Hallelujah and we are fellowshipping
[1:34:03] with Elohim with Melchizedek
[1:34:09] he had no father he had no mother he had
[1:34:12] no beginning he has no ending he is the
[1:34:15] rose of Sharon he is the lily of the
[1:34:17] valley he is the awesome God He is the
[1:34:20] Mighty God he's a mighty deliverer he's
[1:34:22] a strong tower he is
[1:34:26] he is The Offspring of David he is my
[1:34:29] victory he is my everything
[1:34:31] [Applause]
[1:34:33] you forgive me what's wrong with this
[1:34:36] bunch of people they're celebrating with
[1:34:38] Melchizedek
[1:34:41] Melchizedek is here that's why William
[1:34:43] Branham could stand there when he spoke
[1:34:46] to him I said speak to that tumor
[1:34:52] let me tell you
[1:34:56] when you've got the most high talking to
[1:34:57] you
[1:35:03] I'll be real careful what you think
[1:35:05] right now
[1:35:07] but when you got the most high talking
[1:35:10] to you
[1:35:14] it's all right Satan's nervous I like
[1:35:17] that
[1:35:18] but when you got the most high talking
[1:35:20] to you
[1:35:26] and here's this this tumor that's on her
[1:35:29] it's been laying there causing all this
[1:35:31] pain
[1:35:33] and the most high talks to you
[1:35:35] that says speak what you will and it
[1:35:39] will be
[1:35:42] why would I doubt the most high
[1:35:48] now you give me one good reason why I
[1:35:50] should doubt our early on
[1:35:52] and you think that you can get by with
[1:35:55] your thoughts and you think that you can
[1:35:57] get by with your intellects and you
[1:35:59] think that you can get back with your
[1:36:00] religious spirit and you think you can
[1:36:02] get by with your jealousy and you think
[1:36:04] you can get by with all of your life and
[1:36:07] you can try to tell me I'm trying to eat
[1:36:09] this thing you can try to tell me that
[1:36:11] that I shouldn't trust L Ilion
[1:36:14] when men try to put their opinion over
[1:36:17] ill Elian let me tell you I will take
[1:36:20] elihan over top of every man's idea over
[1:36:24] top of everything that they try to bring
[1:36:27] up El eleon is higher his demonstration
[1:36:31] is higher than their intellects his
[1:36:33] power is greater than any Earthly
[1:36:35] follower he is stronger
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:39] he's stronger than cancer
[1:36:41] he's a mighty God he's stronger than
[1:36:44] tuberculosis he's a mighty God he's
[1:36:47] greater than sugar diabetes because he's
[1:36:49] a mighty God he's greater than back pain
[1:36:51] because he's a mighty God every Demon's
[1:36:54] got a bow through early on every demon
[1:36:57] every sickness every Cancer Donald
[1:37:00] Trump's got to battle this name Joe
[1:37:03] Biden's got a bow to this name Putin's
[1:37:05] got a bow to this name every demon in
[1:37:07] hell has got a bow to the name of Jesus
[1:37:11] Christ I say bow Satan bow before
[1:37:14] almighty God
[1:37:17] I'm not here on my own accord I'm not
[1:37:20] trying to preach to you something
[1:37:21] that'll influence you an emotional realm
[1:37:24] I'm trying to tell you that no matter
[1:37:27] what you go through ill early on is
[1:37:29] there
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:53] it was after the victory
[1:37:58] that Melchizedek
[1:38:00] the priest
[1:38:02] of the most high God
[1:38:04] the possessor of Heaven and Earth
[1:38:07] how communion with his child
[1:38:15] when Sodom didn't want him
[1:38:19] well Gamora didn't want him
[1:38:21] he stayed with Abraham
[1:38:25] when they kicked him out of the churches
[1:38:28] he had communion with you
[1:38:34] when they bound him at the doors of
[1:38:36] Creeds and dogmas he stayed with you
[1:38:40] when your own family wouldn't accept him
[1:38:43] he stayed with you
[1:38:46] when cat when pain come rushing in like
[1:38:49] a flood he stayed with you
[1:38:52] he said because I am the spirit of the
[1:38:55] Lord and I will raise a standard
[1:39:01] foreign
[1:39:02] this ain't
[1:39:04] just your typical communion
[1:39:07] where a priest blesses the bread and the
[1:39:10] priest blesses the wine
[1:39:13] but this is a communion
[1:39:16] with God's theophany
[1:39:19] God has a theophany and you have a
[1:39:21] theophany
[1:39:23] and to think that you've been
[1:39:25] fellowshipping with the one that had his
[1:39:27] back turned to Abraham's tent
[1:39:31] foreign
[1:39:34] the one that's there
[1:39:38] when you ain't got groceries
[1:39:40] he was the one that put him on the step
[1:39:45] he was the one that blessed you when
[1:39:48] others cursed you
[1:39:50] when others tried to stop you
[1:39:53] he pushed you forward
[1:39:57] because the lamb is advancing his
[1:40:00] children
[1:40:03] between the breach
[1:40:06] and to the opening of the seals he's
[1:40:08] bringing his children to full Authority
[1:40:11] as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:40:14] and the pillar of fire has made its way
[1:40:17] back into its believing children again
[1:40:20] and he's operating in a body that's got
[1:40:23] full Authority Under the headship
[1:40:26] and this body does not move without thus
[1:40:29] saith the Lord this body is is totally
[1:40:33] depending upon the intellects of the
[1:40:36] headship and this headship that has been
[1:40:38] brought down is his threefold purpose in
[1:40:42] body form that he would have the
[1:40:43] preeminence in a body that he she would
[1:40:46] be live voices and at the last Trump we
[1:40:49] will meet him in the air I want to tell
[1:40:52] you Church of the Living God that you
[1:40:54] are not worshiping an imaginary God
[1:40:57] you're not worshiping some Hocus Pocus
[1:40:59] but you are worshiping a living God and
[1:41:03] what is a living God it's the word in
[1:41:06] you making itself real and that word is
[1:41:10] in this body it's the one that Jacob
[1:41:12] wrestled with it's the one that Joseph
[1:41:15] was in a pit with it's who he rose to
[1:41:17] the palace with
[1:41:20] oppression's got to Bow before him
[1:41:22] depression's got to Bow before him
[1:41:24] everything that you come up against has
[1:41:27] got to Bow before the name of almighty
[1:41:30] God
[1:41:33] I want to say
[1:41:35] God sees you
[1:41:45] if you are blessed by the most high God
[1:41:51] if you want to see better
[1:41:53] you climb higher
[1:41:56] and the Bible tells us that we don't
[1:41:59] look at the things that we see but to
[1:42:01] look at the things that we don't see
[1:42:04] and we've been told to look past what
[1:42:06] you think look past what you see and
[1:42:09] think past what you think
[1:42:13] why is this equal anointing taking you
[1:42:15] higher
[1:42:17] because it is of el helion
[1:42:20] to be able to pierce through the
[1:42:21] darkness
[1:42:27] we're the most powerful people on the
[1:42:29] face of the Earth
[1:42:31] were the most anointed church that
[1:42:33] there's ever been
[1:42:37] still got needs
[1:42:43] let's just come down to it at the end of
[1:42:46] the day you're a human
[1:42:53] at the end of the day you still get sick
[1:42:56] at the end of the day you still have to
[1:42:58] take vitamins at the end of the day you
[1:43:00] still have to eat I have yet to come in
[1:43:03] here and see a bunch of angels wings
[1:43:12] but oh early on
[1:43:14] is your friend
[1:43:18] when it doesn't look like your mate is
[1:43:20] coming in life
[1:43:23] El eleon has your mate already picked
[1:43:26] out
[1:43:31] I think it's amazing when mothers and
[1:43:33] fathers begin to play the game
[1:43:40] I don't know who's playing games over in
[1:43:42] that corner but
[1:43:43] you might want to steer away from there
[1:43:46] seem a little pushy
[1:43:49] I love it when when parents begin to say
[1:43:52] oh that one could work
[1:43:54] he's got a good job
[1:43:58] yeah baby
[1:44:02] it wasn't meant for my daddy I highly
[1:44:04] doubt that I would have Katie Spencer
[1:44:06] sitting here in the building tonight
[1:44:07] because he had a great reputation
[1:44:11] because there was a whole lot of Works
[1:44:12] in my life that didn't look too didn't
[1:44:14] look too good
[1:44:16] how'd that come into this I it's an
[1:44:18] early on service
[1:44:22] I love it when parents begin to
[1:44:24] you know that one
[1:44:26] I think I could get along with him
[1:44:28] or she could get along with us she
[1:44:30] brings a lot to the table do you see
[1:44:31] them mashed potatoes she brought to the
[1:44:33] Thanksgiving whoa
[1:44:35] she put on an extra slab of butter for
[1:44:38] me
[1:44:38] yes you'll work
[1:44:45] if you're on the internet forgive me
[1:44:54] that's how she got it she didn't she had
[1:44:56] an extra slab of butter
[1:45:01] serving Jesus is the best thing
[1:45:07] but when Eliana
[1:45:10] has got you figured out
[1:45:12] before you figure yourself out
[1:45:16] let's just face it you're a mess
[1:45:21] you wake up in the morning you can
[1:45:23] barely figure out what shoe goes on the
[1:45:25] right foot
[1:45:27] did I brush my teeth or didn't I
[1:45:31] dear God I hope you went back in and
[1:45:33] brushed them
[1:45:34] do it twice if you got to
[1:45:36] yeah early on cares about it
[1:45:39] take care of this Temple

[1:45:57] when you get a phone call

[1:46:13] you get down on your knees
[1:46:16] I Cry
[1:46:18] and you can be the strongest individual
[1:46:21] and you can feel like a great giant 10
[1:46:24] minutes before
[1:46:26] but let the enemy come and knock your
[1:46:28] props out from underneath of you and
[1:46:30] you'll find out you need hell Hellion
[1:46:38] yeah there's some real times in this
[1:46:40] battle brother Chris
[1:46:43] if hell Elian wasn't on my side where
[1:46:46] would I be
[1:46:48] there were some times when it didn't
[1:46:51] look like things were going to be good
[1:47:06] he's been that kind of friend ain't he
[1:47:08] brother Lawrence
[1:47:11] he was always there
[1:47:13] he was always there
[1:47:15] it was that unseen hand that you felt
[1:47:18] slip underneath of you
[1:47:20] he was always there
[1:47:28] it was always there sister Gabrielle
[1:47:30] Hill
[1:47:31] in everything
[1:47:34] he was always there
[1:47:40] he's my water when I'm thirsty
[1:47:42] he's my food when I'm hungry he's my
[1:47:46] health when I'm sick
[1:47:49] and he is my Prosperity when I'm poor
[1:47:52] and when I am weak
[1:47:54] then I see his strength
[1:47:58] let the weak say I am strong
[1:48:03] let the poor say I am rich
[1:48:07] when it don't feel
[1:48:09] like you're blessed
[1:48:11] you are blessed by the priest of the
[1:48:14] most thy God
[1:48:17] God bless you as you stand with us this
[1:48:19] evening
[1:48:34] it's amazing when you
[1:48:36] if it wasn't for a prophet's voice in
[1:48:38] this day I don't know what we
[1:48:40] what we do
[1:48:43] you can begin to think about
[1:48:46] here I am
[1:48:49] I understand what's here
[1:48:54] I understand what's on the back side of
[1:48:56] this and understand what's laying here
[1:48:57] in these notes
[1:48:59] you have no clue
[1:49:01] you're just praying all week long that
[1:49:02] the Lord would bless you with a word of
[1:49:04] encouragement
[1:49:06] and if I would hand you a sealed letter
[1:49:08] if I'd hand you a sealed letter
[1:49:10] you would have no knowledge of what's on
[1:49:12] the inside of it but if you break it
[1:49:14] then you're able to understand what is
[1:49:16] there and then when you read it it
[1:49:18] begins to give you the language of the
[1:49:20] author
[1:49:22] and I think it's amazing that you can
[1:49:24] stand here behind this pulpit and you
[1:49:25] have a great idea of how God's going to
[1:49:27] take the service
[1:49:29] but because
[1:49:30] of the needs of the people
[1:49:33] El eleon goes above man
[1:49:36] and he goes above our thinking
[1:49:38] and he brings a word by your way to show
[1:49:41] that he's Mighty over your situation
[1:49:44] can you say he's mighty
[1:49:47] he's Mighty over your situation
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:55] Christ

[1:50:06] when it don't feel like you got the Holy
[1:50:08] Ghost
