[58:51] you I oh my heart is just overwhelming
[58:55] just to be able to see one another but
[58:58] my heart also breaks at the on the side
[59:00] of this because half of our congregation
[59:02] can't be here on this night and then the
[59:05] rest of our congregations hearts will be
[59:06] breaking tomorrow because you won't be
[59:08] with us and but we're just thankful that
[59:10] we're able to have service and able to
[59:13] be in the house of the Lord

[59:24] raise his holy name praise his holy name
[59:29] hey man we're so so sorry that we have
[59:32] to go through all of this rigmarole to
[59:34] have Church and as again as I stated
[59:37] that if I thought that this was a
[59:39] Christian persecution or they were
[59:41] trying to shut down the churches we'd
[59:43] have been here but this was for your
[59:45] safety and for the rest of our safety
[59:47] and and so we just we follow the
[59:49] leadership of the Lord and and we have
[59:52] to give Caesar what is Caesar's and we
[59:55] thank you for bearing with us and all of
[59:58] this all of this is new to us as well
[1:00:00] and we're doing the very best of what we
[1:00:03] can as we can and I so appreciate you
[1:00:06] coming to the house of the Lord this
[1:00:07] evening and I I as I said last weekend I
[1:00:10] have been a privilege to be able to have
[1:00:12] service with a few chosen but I'm sure
[1:00:14] sure thankful to be here with the
[1:00:16] elected tonight and and just very
[1:00:19] thankful that you're able to be here and
[1:00:21] so we just we just want to move forward
[1:00:24] and just to have ourselves a good
[1:00:26] old-fashioned devil stomping the kind of
[1:00:29] service and a man I trust you've all
[1:00:32] come ready for the word and certainly a
[1:00:37] little bit nervous I you forgive me if I
[1:00:41] forget how to do this in front of a
[1:00:42] crowd and you know I've preached to less
[1:00:47] than we've had here in the past couple
[1:00:49] of weeks and I think it's nine nine
[1:00:51] weeks that we've had I preached two less
[1:00:54] but in a tighter quarters and so with I
[1:00:57] wouldn't say the word awkward but I
[1:00:58] would say that it was definitely
[1:01:00] different without having you here and so
[1:01:02] we're thankful for the Lord to be able
[1:01:03] to have these services and so we just
[1:01:05] want to make a reminder to you that
[1:01:08] tomorrow morning service will be at
[1:01:09] 11:00 for the the other side of the
[1:01:12] church and hopefully we don't have to do
[1:01:14] this too much longer
[1:01:15] but we can move right back into order
[1:01:18] and if we see that we can handle the
[1:01:20] crowd the way it is you know doing
[1:01:22] different social distances and things
[1:01:24] we'll make different arrangements as it
[1:01:26] as it comes to us and so we so thank you
[1:01:30] for being here this evening
[1:01:31] Amen we love you fall of our heart maybe

[1:02:06] to be back to 100% and Ron's got a
[1:02:08] little bit more than a head cold going
[1:02:10] on but we're so thankful that the Lord

[1:04:04] great throne of mercy this evening or
[1:04:07] what a privilege it is for us to be
[1:04:09] assembled together the way that you
[1:04:12] ordained us to be here
[1:04:14] father we realize that on the other side
[1:04:17] of that cameras is a great portion of
[1:04:20] our church father or that would love to
[1:04:23] be here setting with us in heavenly
[1:04:25] places but I believe that though we are
[1:04:27] set it right now in heavenly places the
[1:04:31] believers position in Christ and we
[1:04:33] realize father that where two or three
[1:04:35] are gathered in my name there up will be
[1:04:38] Lord I know that you're here your word
[1:04:40] tells me that you're here the anointing
[1:04:42] tells me that you're here Lord your
[1:04:45] children have gathered father I look out
[1:04:48] I don't see a bunch of chickens that's
[1:04:49] scared of the curl of our Sun look at
[1:04:51] the Eagles that are willing to fly
[1:04:53] higher than a sickness higher than then
[1:04:56] denominationalism higher than the guy
[1:04:58] the governor's orders higher than that
[1:05:00] father we look out upon a children of
[1:05:03] people that that have been called by
[1:05:05] your name and set aside a people that
[1:05:07] you have slipped on the wedding band of
[1:05:09] a merited grace that if don't be here
[1:05:11] for you father they've not come to hear
[1:05:14] from me before they realize that that
[1:05:17] out of a man
[1:05:19] when you deal for redemption and you
[1:05:20] deal for humanity father but I pray that
[1:05:23] you would take these 16 elements fall
[1:05:26] that you created for your service and I
[1:05:28] pray for today's service that you would
[1:05:31] bring for your purpose of God do you
[1:05:34] know exactly what will be done and what
[1:05:36] would be sad father but I pray that you
[1:05:38] reached out your all mercy in your hand
[1:05:42] of deliverance and your your power
[1:05:44] father and reach out and touch your
[1:05:46] children where they're at what they're

[1:05:50] they may they be ministered to by the
[1:05:52] son of man of God Lord we commit this
[1:05:56] service to you everything that'll be
[1:05:58] done and said to your holy name
[1:06:02] may you be pleased O God with our
[1:06:05] worship with the words of our mouth and
[1:06:08] the meditation of our heart we love you
[1:06:13] hard the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[1:06:17] these things you have your Bibles this
[1:06:21] evening we'll turn over to the book of
[1:06:22] John chapter 1 and then also to Isaiah
[1:06:25] chapter 14 John chapter 1 verse 1 and I
[1:06:31] closed last weekend service on I'm
[1:06:34] committed to the purpose and I honestly
[1:06:37] thought that the Lord was was done with
[1:06:40] this thought but he he began as soon as
[1:06:43] I left for the pulpit I the Lord began
[1:06:45] to deal with me on these things so we
[1:06:47] just want to speak tonight by the help
[1:06:49] of the Lord on I'm committed to the
[1:06:51] purpose and before I forget I would like
[1:06:53] to wish brother Elijah Bor Levon a happy
[1:06:56] birthday today god bless you buddy happy
[1:06:58] birthday from us a man committed to the
[1:07:02] purpose John chapter one and verse 1 the
[1:07:09] Bible says and in the beginning was the
[1:07:11] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:07:14] Word was God the same was in the
[1:07:17] beginning with God all things were made
[1:07:20] by him and without him was not anything
[1:07:23] made that was made now to me I could get
[1:07:27] hung up on that one scripture for all
[1:07:29] day and stay there to realize that all
[1:07:32] things were made by him and without him
[1:07:35] was not anything made that was made so
[1:07:38] we realized tonight that we're standing
[1:07:41] on the very spot convert of God the very
[1:07:44] word made materialization in front of
[1:07:47] our eyes and we we see that without him
[1:07:50] so we see here that he's the key
[1:07:53] ingredient to life that without him was
[1:07:55] not anything made that was made
[1:07:57] it's just like you sisters that are
[1:07:59] making a cake if you forget your flower
[1:08:01] when you're making that cake there's
[1:08:03] something in there well that will not
[1:08:05] allow it to rise you have forgotten a
[1:08:07] key ingredient and if you have forgotten
[1:08:09] Christ in your life you have forgotten
[1:08:12] the key ingredient that will make you
[1:08:13] rise above sickness rise above despair
[1:08:16] rise above life rise above all things if
[1:08:19] Christ is not the center focus of your
[1:08:22] life you have forgotten the key
[1:08:24] ingredient for without him without him
[1:08:28] was not anything made that was made
[1:08:30] anything that was formed constructed or
[1:08:33] that was constructed by combining
[1:08:36] substances now as you're turning over to
[1:08:39] Isaiah chapter 14 I like to read this
[1:08:42] this quote from proving his word he said
[1:08:46] the Prophet said when he predestinated
[1:08:48] in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he
[1:08:51] come over and he predestinate seni thing
[1:08:53] to happen in his word he had to prove
[1:08:55] his word to be sold when he predestinate
[1:08:58] s-- anything to happen and says it will
[1:09:00] happen
[1:09:01] he knows that seed will be there just at
[1:09:04] that time he predestinated a bride and
[1:09:08] she's going to be there can you say a
[1:09:10] man going to be a rapture she's going to
[1:09:14] be there he predestinate sit by his
[1:09:17] foreknowledge and see there's nothing
[1:09:19] going to stop it won't you say that
[1:09:22] there's nothing going to stop it
[1:09:24] isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24 from
[1:09:29] which we'd like to draw our context
[1:09:31] tonight the Lord of Hosts has sworn
[1:09:34] saying surely as I have thought so shall
[1:09:37] it come to pass and as I have purposed
[1:09:39] so shall it stand that I will break the
[1:09:42] Assyrian in my land and upon my Mountain
[1:09:45] shred him underfoot then shall his yoke
[1:09:48] depart from off them and his burden
[1:09:50] depart from off their shoulders this is
[1:09:53] the purpose that is purposed upon the
[1:09:55] whole earth and this is the hand that is
[1:09:57] stretched out upon all the nations for
[1:10:01] the Lord of hosts hath purposed who
[1:10:03] shall dis anole it and his hand is
[1:10:05] stretched out and who shall turn it back
[1:10:08] may God bless the reading of the word he
[1:10:10] may be seated in the presence of the
[1:10:11] Lord
[1:10:13] committed to the purpose and we we see
[1:10:15] here we see here as we look in Isaiah 14
[1:10:19] and 20 for the Lord of Hosts has sworn
[1:10:21] saying surely as I have thought so shall
[1:10:24] it come to pass and as I have purposed
[1:10:27] so shall it stand now we look here and
[1:10:31] we realized that that God has sworn and
[1:10:33] we see the oath that that here the oath
[1:10:37] that was here designed it was to comfort
[1:10:40] the Jews or the Israelites when they
[1:10:43] would be in a time that they were in
[1:10:45] captivity in in the in the city of
[1:10:48] Babylon and here God gives him an oath
[1:10:51] and a confirmation with assurance that
[1:10:54] what he had thus promised would
[1:10:56] assuredly come to pass you see it's a
[1:11:00] one thing to realize that when the
[1:11:02] promises of God are laid out there
[1:11:04] before you and a lot of times when you
[1:11:06] don't need that promise you'll just kind
[1:11:08] of walk over that promise or or you're
[1:11:10] maybe not necessarily neglected or
[1:11:12] disrespected in a manner but you don't
[1:11:15] necessarily need that that promise in
[1:11:17] that sense because you're not in that
[1:11:19] portion of life in that portion when
[1:11:21] when you don't really need a piece of
[1:11:23] healing in your body you're not
[1:11:25] necessarily looking for the scriptures
[1:11:27] of healing maybe you're looking for
[1:11:29] maybe you're looking for peace or maybe
[1:11:31] you're looking for joy but you see there
[1:11:33] this promise was laying there for for so
[1:11:36] how many years it was laying there it
[1:11:38] was put there but he came to a spot when
[1:11:41] the children of Israel the Jews they
[1:11:44] needed that scripture and it brought
[1:11:46] them great assurance to know that that
[1:11:49] the thing that they were going through
[1:11:50] down in captivity down in Babylon that
[1:11:53] the thing that they were going through
[1:11:55] was spoken by by the
[1:11:58] fit which they knew which was a divan
[1:12:00] sphere so that divine seer was able to
[1:12:03] look into his Eagle Eye and capture that
[1:12:07] this word would be brought forth and and
[1:12:09] it would be manifested in a certain
[1:12:11] season you see they were under that
[1:12:14] burden and under that spot but they did
[1:12:17] not despair and they did not depart from
[1:12:20] the word of truth because you see that
[1:12:22] word was laying there that promise was
[1:12:25] laying there and when you're in the
[1:12:27] midst of a battle and you're going
[1:12:29] through a season when you need a you and
[1:12:31] you need hope when you need joy when you
[1:12:34] need peace when they're going through
[1:12:35] that battle that scripture or that
[1:12:38] promise it's made more alive than when
[1:12:40] you did not need it when you are in a
[1:12:42] time of peace the Lord the scriptures on
[1:12:45] warfare didn't mean as much to you but
[1:12:48] when you are in the midst of a battle
[1:12:50] when you're in the midst of the battle
[1:12:52] it gives you assurance that I'm coming
[1:12:55] out
[1:12:55] you see when he told them that I will
[1:12:58] break the band of the Assyrians even
[1:13:00] though they were there in captivity they
[1:13:03] realized that they were coming out that
[1:13:05] he would tread them upon the mountain
[1:13:07] that he would break down their captivity
[1:13:10] that the promise was laying there you
[1:13:12] see we recognize that the Word of God is
[1:13:16] is infallible that the Word of God that
[1:13:18] when God says anything then he makes her
[1:13:21] promise that God can't take that promise
[1:13:23] back because he's God you see any
[1:13:26] sovereign and he can't go back on that
[1:13:27] promise
[1:13:28] you see God cannot lie and be God so we
[1:13:31] recognized that the Word of God that we
[1:13:34] have in front of us is the unfailing
[1:13:36] Word of God it is infallible it's not
[1:13:40] like you and I that we change with winds
[1:13:43] that come by but the Word of God remains
[1:13:45] true no matter what we're going through
[1:13:48] the Word of God is to us being living
[1:13:52] Oracle's of a Living God that we realize
[1:13:55] that the Word of God is to us a divine
[1:13:57] communication and we realize that the
[1:14:01] Word of God is a force now any man can
[1:14:03] say words anybody can just rattle off at
[1:14:06] the mouth and just
[1:14:07] three things but you see that when that
[1:14:09] man speaks something he's the man that
[1:14:12] has to back up what he has said but we
[1:14:14] realized that the Word of God is a force
[1:14:17] that when God speaks something there's
[1:14:19] something that is backing up it's
[1:14:22] backing up what has been spoken it's
[1:14:24] backing up what has been said and there
[1:14:26] is a being that is behind that word of
[1:14:29] truth we have a shorter word of prophecy
[1:14:31] and if you could realize tonight that
[1:14:34] when you look over in the Book of Isaiah
[1:14:36] that by His stripes we are healed that
[1:14:39] there is a force that is behind that
[1:14:42] word it's not just some man is not just
[1:14:46] some prophet but there is a force that
[1:14:48] is behind that word that will bring it
[1:14:51] to pass in a brilliance of past not in
[1:14:53] tomorrow or not just in some day in the
[1:14:55] future
[1:14:56] but it'll bring it to pass because then
[1:14:58] it is a Living Word there is a force
[1:15:01] that is behind this word you see when
[1:15:06] God spoke the world into existence he
[1:15:09] spoke those sayings that he wanted to
[1:15:11] see manifested but he did not just let
[1:15:14] him loose and lay them there hanging
[1:15:16] there but there was a body that was
[1:15:18] behind it there was a force that was
[1:15:20] behind it if you could realize tonight
[1:15:23] that there is a God of heaven that is
[1:15:26] behind his word that is backing up what
[1:15:29] he said that this ain't the governor's
[1:15:32] words the governor may see that we're
[1:15:35] going to be in this for June 10th or
[1:15:37] however long they want to say but God
[1:15:39] knows the end and he knows the beginning
[1:15:42] they may tell us that we have to worship
[1:15:45] like this but God is the God that needs
[1:15:48] to be worshipped he's not permitted us
[1:15:51] to be that we were just stay in our
[1:15:54] homes and listen to a tape he has
[1:15:56] committed us to live in an hour with a
[1:15:59] living voice hello young God is
[1:16:04] committed to that purpose you see his
[1:16:07] purpose is his worth to you it is his
[1:16:10] word of truth that will bring the
[1:16:12] promises of pass
[1:16:14] I'm not having I'm not having to stand
[1:16:16] here today because I have to be honest I
[1:16:18] would be shaking
[1:16:19] my books if I had to try to manifest one
[1:16:22] of the gifts I would I'd be shaking in
[1:16:24] my boots if I would have to try to
[1:16:26] manifest the promises of God but you
[1:16:29] realize I understand the responsibility
[1:16:31] that's on my shoulder but do you realize
[1:16:33] how easy it is for me to walk out that
[1:16:36] door and come stand behind this pulpit
[1:16:39] and realize that I don't have to back up
[1:16:41] what God says but God will back up what
[1:16:44] he's him if he said I'm the LORD thy God
[1:16:47] that heals all of my diseases that's who
[1:16:50] he is that's who he is see this is a
[1:16:59] very literal life of God in written form
[1:17:02] and we realize that it is this word that
[1:17:05] conquers all things this word conquers
[1:17:08] powers it conquers principalities and
[1:17:11] conquer sickness it conquers death it
[1:17:14] conquers torment it conquers Devils it
[1:17:16] conquers everything there is you can
[1:17:19] name off what you want to write there
[1:17:21] but the Lord of God will conquer it he
[1:17:24] will defeat Satan anytime anyplace under
[1:17:27] any situation and there is such power in
[1:17:30] the Word of God because you realize that
[1:17:32] God is going to prove what he said he's
[1:17:37] going to prove what he said now he will
[1:17:40] not prove it to unbelievers he will not
[1:17:43] prove it to skeptics
[1:17:44] he will not prove it to even to critics
[1:17:46] but he will prove his word to believers
[1:17:50] that believe that he's the same
[1:17:51] yesterday today and forever the Prophet
[1:17:55] said it to him that believed and if he
[1:17:57] can find somebody who will believe his
[1:17:59] word he will prove his word to you I say
[1:18:03] Oh God Here I am Here I am
[1:18:07] you see if you believe God will prove
[1:18:09] his word to you now we look here in the
[1:18:12] passage of Scripture that we ready are
[1:18:14] now saying that y'all way have sworn
[1:18:17] jehovah has sworn you see when we look
[1:18:20] at that scripture when you see when God
[1:18:23] has sworn that he is often is often
[1:18:26] represented as making a use of an oath
[1:18:29] to denote such a strong confirmation and
[1:18:33] that there is absolute certainty in what
[1:18:36] he utters from his lips you see when God
[1:18:39] when God speaks any things that should
[1:18:42] be enough because he's gone but then God
[1:18:44] comes behind it with a sworn affidavit
[1:18:48] that he cannot lie just like we read to
[1:18:51] you last weekend in Genesis 24 and 7
[1:18:54] that the Lord God of heaven which took
[1:18:57] me from my father's house and from the
[1:18:59] land of my kindred which spake to me and
[1:19:01] that swear unto me saying under thy seed
[1:19:05] will I give this land you see he swore
[1:19:08] to Abraham that I'm going to give you
[1:19:10] this land and he sends out his elders
[1:19:13] servant Eliezer notice what he said he
[1:19:17] not Abraham but he shall send His angel
[1:19:21] before thee and thou shalt take a wife
[1:19:24] under my son from this you see it was
[1:19:28] not Abraham swearing it he was not any
[1:19:31] easier that was swearing it but it was
[1:19:33] God to me you put god behind anything
[1:19:39] and it settles it
[1:19:40] to me if you put God before anything it
[1:19:43] settles it
[1:19:44] are you with me and here ear Abraham is
[1:19:48] telling his servant that he has sworn
[1:19:51] unto me and I would tell you that he is
[1:19:55] going to send his angel before thee
[1:19:58] you see Eliezer could go with an
[1:20:01] assurance knowing that he was going to
[1:20:03] bring for the bride because there was an
[1:20:05] angel that was gone before him you see
[1:20:08] just like when we read over when Paul
[1:20:10] would would relay it to us in Hebrews
[1:20:12] chapter 6 and 13 that when God he could
[1:20:15] not swear by no greater but he swore by
[1:20:18] himself that in blessing I will bless
[1:20:21] thee and in multiplying I will multiply
[1:20:24] I love the main part there I ll him
[1:20:27] Almighty God I will bless thee I love it
[1:20:32] when I get to talk there with God and he
[1:20:34] talks back to me and he says I'm the one
[1:20:37] I'm the one I
[1:20:40] the iron you see anything is possible
[1:20:43] when I am this present anything is
[1:20:47] possible when the I am shows up do you
[1:20:51] realize the night that you are sitting
[1:20:52] in heavenly places and that all things
[1:20:55] are possible because the I am said that
[1:20:58] where you are I will be there that I
[1:21:01] will not leave you I will not forsake
[1:21:03] you through this whole coronavirus he
[1:21:07] has been there all the time you've been
[1:21:12] studying in your home all by yourself
[1:21:14] but God's been there he's not just
[1:21:17] committed to you when you come to the
[1:21:19] house of God he's committed to you 365
[1:21:22] days of the year whoa hallelujah he will
[1:21:29] never stop fighting for me see this
[1:21:34] passage that we read in Isaiah is a full
[1:21:37] proof that God cannot change that
[1:21:41] whatever he purposes whatever the
[1:21:43] purposes of God are that they are
[1:21:46] inflexible
[1:21:47] they ain't changing you see because
[1:21:50] change supposes and imperfection you see
[1:21:55] men like you and I we change our minds
[1:21:58] let me change my mind today well praise
[1:22:02] the Lord
[1:22:03] some of you ain't change your mind
[1:22:05] praise God but you know as humanistic
[1:22:08] swill preached to the humans here
[1:22:10] tonight but we hear we realize that the
[1:22:12] humans we change our minds there's
[1:22:15] things that come up when we just we we
[1:22:17] adapt to things as they come there are
[1:22:20] there are events that happen in our life
[1:22:22] that we didn't see coming so we just
[1:22:24] changed we are in an ever-changing
[1:22:27] battlefront as Christians and there are
[1:22:30] some times that we have to change the
[1:22:32] avenue I as a minister of the gospel
[1:22:35] Jesus Christ and as a sociopath stir
[1:22:38] here if I see something that slipping in
[1:22:40] I will change my approach on a certain
[1:22:44] subject I will change what God has said
[1:22:46] but I'll change as brother Branham would
[1:22:48] say the turning of the Dom and so that
[1:22:50] you can
[1:22:51] in a certain way now I can change there
[1:22:55] are things that have already changed in
[1:22:57] my own sermon notes that you don't know
[1:22:59] nothing about but you change the way
[1:23:02] that I presented something but it did
[1:23:05] not change what God thought hallelujah
[1:23:11] we can get it in our mind how things are
[1:23:13] going to come forth and how things are
[1:23:14] going to be presented but God will not
[1:23:17] change look at your neighbors say God
[1:23:21] ain't change it
[1:23:24] you see we as human beings there's
[1:23:28] things that we do and we have to redeem
[1:23:30] ourselves we have to realize hey where'd
[1:23:33] the man up say look I was a human being
[1:23:35] right there I didn't mean to do it like
[1:23:37] that and you have to go back and prove
[1:23:40] that you're a person that can be counted
[1:23:42] on maybe you missed your appointment and
[1:23:45] you go back and say look that was
[1:23:46] something that came up you what you're
[1:23:49] doing is redeeming yourself but you see
[1:23:51] God has never had to redeem himself but
[1:23:53] he had to redeem you and I you see when
[1:23:56] he created man he created him a free
[1:23:59] moral agency and we realized that in
[1:24:02] Christ was attributes of a Redeemer of
[1:24:05] buying back and here you see he had
[1:24:09] these attributes in him to be father and
[1:24:12] in him to be son and in him to be healer
[1:24:15] in him to be Redeemer but here as man
[1:24:19] has put on free moral agency he was not
[1:24:22] going to settle for a falling condition
[1:24:24] of man that was made in his own image
[1:24:27] that he took from the dust of the earth
[1:24:29] he placed him there because God wanted
[1:24:33] to display himself woo you see you see
[1:24:39] as like as we look you can look at the
[1:24:42] art piece Michelangelo's art piece that
[1:24:46] he created on Moses and it is deemed to
[1:24:49] be a masterpiece and we can look at that
[1:24:53] and we can we can all add pattern and
[1:24:55] there are many critics to those that
[1:24:57] look on Michelangelo as he is depicting
[1:25:01] and maybe you would depict Moses in a
[1:25:03] different way but you're not known like
[1:25:06] Michelangelo is known but you see as
[1:25:08] Michelangelo who as he's working on this
[1:25:11] he didn't just grab a piece of marble
[1:25:13] and just start on it but here here he is
[1:25:17] years before he ever even puts it down
[1:25:20] on a piece of paper he has this vision
[1:25:23] and I want to capture this one thought
[1:25:27] the brother branham said that
[1:25:28] Michelangelo was carrying this vision of
[1:25:32] Moses for years he was carrying this
[1:25:36] vision and he's looking at this vision
[1:25:39] in his mind just like you and I we have
[1:25:41] memories and we pull out those memories
[1:25:43] and we look at those memories we turn
[1:25:45] them around every whichaway and we try
[1:25:47] to remember everything about that event
[1:25:49] but here Michelangelo being gifted he's
[1:25:52] looking at this vision he's looking at
[1:25:56] it and he's carrying this thing and many
[1:25:59] many years later after he's carrying
[1:26:01] this thing then he begins to work he
[1:26:04] spends a better part of his life town
[1:26:07] contemplating and looking over this
[1:26:09] piece of art because you see it can't be
[1:26:12] just one piece of art he is depicting
[1:26:15] and describing one of the greatest
[1:26:18] prophets in the Old Testament so he goes
[1:26:21] to the Old Testament and he looks at the
[1:26:23] Old Testament and he sees how Moses is
[1:26:26] portrayed how that he is an older man
[1:26:29] and how that he comes off of the
[1:26:30] mountain and some people look at those
[1:26:32] horns almost as his head and for my what
[1:26:35] was he trying to create but what is he
[1:26:38] trying to depict is when Moses came down
[1:26:41] off the mountain that the Bible said
[1:26:44] that his face shone with a glory and
[1:26:47] Michelangelo is capturing that and he's
[1:26:50] putting it on marble he didn't just come
[1:26:54] up with a song but he's carrying it in
[1:26:57] his mind and he goes through his mind
[1:27:00] and one day he starts getting out of
[1:27:02] chisel and he commits his whole life's
[1:27:05] work to bringing forth this masterpiece
[1:27:09] called Moses that he would bring
[1:27:13] people would look at when they would go
[1:27:15] through the guard and some people would
[1:27:17] have them as statues in their home he
[1:27:19] didn't realize exactly what he was
[1:27:21] creating they would create replicas and
[1:27:24] different things but Michelangelo had it
[1:27:26] in his mind
[1:27:27] and he had to get it off of his mind now
[1:27:31] anybody I don't understand artistry I'm
[1:27:33] not an artist because the only thing I
[1:27:35] can draw a stick figure
[1:27:36] I highly doubt the people who come and
[1:27:38] look at my stick figures but I highly I
[1:27:41] do not even think that Michelangelo who
[1:27:44] had the idea of how many thousands and
[1:27:47] millions of people would look would look
[1:27:50] at the statue and criticizing and look
[1:27:54] at it with a different Avenue but you
[1:27:56] see what he was doing
[1:27:58] when he had me he had this vision and he
[1:28:00] created it he created it and it came to
[1:28:03] such a spot that when he got it and it
[1:28:07] perfected it it finally he rubbed it the
[1:28:10] last time he took the dust off of it for
[1:28:13] the last time he put his chisel in his
[1:28:15] hammer down for the last time and he
[1:28:18] smooth it on the knee and said speak now
[1:28:23] you and I can understand that but the
[1:28:25] vision that he had seen for all of those
[1:28:28] years have became manifested and it
[1:28:30] looked so real to him that he would
[1:28:34] smite it and say speak Oh hallelujah you
[1:28:40] see in Christ the mystery of God
[1:28:42] revealed the Prophet said that he loved
[1:28:45] fatherhood hallelujah and he created
[1:28:49] Adam a free moral agency but he was not
[1:28:53] going to stand by and allow his creation
[1:28:57] to live in that fallen condition you see
[1:29:02] he had it in his vine brother Josh he
[1:29:05] had it in his mind that there would be a
[1:29:06] people that would be victorious and so
[1:29:10] he would look and he would sculpt and he
[1:29:12] would mold
[1:29:12] he went from Adam when he failed and
[1:29:15] then it went to Noah but Noah died a
[1:29:17] drunk
[1:29:17] it went from Moses and Moses had a
[1:29:20] temper but he came down promoting this
[1:29:23] and that one and this one and that one
[1:29:25] and so many times we get caught up with
[1:29:28] who we are and this is going on and
[1:29:30] that's going on I'd say as parents
[1:29:33] sometimes you wonder are they really
[1:29:35] getting it but if you can look back at
[1:29:38] your genealogy and say hey they played a
[1:29:41] part in the lineage of Jesus Christ I'd
[1:29:44] say that Isaac and Rebecca got a little
[1:29:46] upset some days with Jacob a little
[1:29:52] Johnny you know what I'm talking about
[1:29:53] there's some days in your life when you
[1:29:55] get so tore up because they're not
[1:29:58] bringing forth what you had in mind but
[1:30:00] look at Jacob Jacob was a shyster Jacob
[1:30:04] was a deceiver but one time in the
[1:30:07] presence of the angel of the Lord and it
[1:30:11] changed Jacob from a deceiver fed to a
[1:30:14] walking Prince but Jacob deceived you
[1:30:23] look at all the prophets but finally it
[1:30:26] came down to one that when one was
[1:30:29] walking on the shores of the Jordan and
[1:30:32] then John the Baptist looks up and says
[1:30:35] behold the lamb of God which takes away
[1:30:39] the sin of the world and the spirit of a
[1:30:41] dove us ended on that lamb descended on
[1:30:44] that lamb you see what was he he was the
[1:30:47] perfect masterpiece that God had in his
[1:30:50] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:30:52] John being a prophet could look in there
[1:30:55] and grab that vision which God which God
[1:30:59] had in his mind and said this is him
[1:31:02] this is the one that was spoke up and
[1:31:10] God was so enthused about the
[1:31:13] masterpiece that he had created that he
[1:31:16] smote him and he smote him and he struck
[1:31:20] him why to bring forward more
[1:31:23] masterpieces that the perfect
[1:31:27] masterpiece could bring forth you and I
[1:31:29] through the shedding of his blood
[1:31:35] you see it was in his mind it was in his
[1:31:41] mind but here it was made manifest you
[1:31:45] see here Jehovah was manifested in the
[1:31:48] flesh when he was on earth he said he
[1:31:51] was God he looked like God he talked
[1:31:54] like God he he preached my God
[1:31:57] hallelujah
[1:31:57] He healed my god he rose like God he
[1:32:00] ascended like God and he was God he was
[1:32:03] God in the flesh and God was in his son
[1:32:06] manifesting himself to his people you
[1:32:09] see all that God was he poured himself
[1:32:12] he emptied himself out into Christ and
[1:32:16] all that was Christ was he poured he
[1:32:22] poured himself into the church you see
[1:32:27] these things that we've been speaking to
[1:32:29] you on that he has not asked you to do
[1:32:32] but you did not have the capacity to do
[1:32:34] he has known exactly who you are
[1:32:39] you see when Christ came he knew that he
[1:32:42] had the capacity to take the blood of
[1:32:45] Calvary and when you came on the scene
[1:32:49] he knew exactly who you are and why he
[1:32:52] built you to be you see he is the word
[1:33:00] and he's proof of the worth he proved
[1:33:05] exactly who he was that he was the one
[1:33:07] that was made manifest the one that was
[1:33:09] spoken when he's standing there and he
[1:33:12] has 5000 followers that are following
[1:33:14] him and they're hungry he shows that
[1:33:17] he's Jehovah when he sets him down and
[1:33:19] all of a sudden he begins to multiply
[1:33:21] the fish in a bread he proves that he
[1:33:24] was Jehovah when he walks into a room of
[1:33:26] criticism when there's death laying
[1:33:29] there he proved that he was Jehovah to
[1:33:31] Jairus and his family he had to kick out
[1:33:34] all the unbelief but he allowed belief
[1:33:37] to stay he proved that he was the same
[1:33:43] yesterday too
[1:33:44] day and forever when he's standing there
[1:33:46] and he says Talitha koum me which being
[1:33:50] interpreted means daughter arise I have
[1:33:54] heard that same voice speaking this hour
[1:33:56] Talitha call me Brad arise arise out of
[1:34:01] your condition arise out of your
[1:34:03] sickness arise out of death arise out of
[1:34:05] criticism hallelujah he's ordained you
[1:34:11] before the foundation of Laurel and
[1:34:12] there ain't nothing going to stop it
[1:34:20] notice what the Prophet said in this day
[1:34:23] the scriptures were filled he said
[1:34:25] sometimes you may be sitting out there
[1:34:27] with a cancer you might be sitting out
[1:34:29] there with the disease you think while
[1:34:31] me being a Christian would be in this
[1:34:34] way why would I be sitting like this if
[1:34:37] I'm a Christian
[1:34:41] sometimes God lets the things get so
[1:34:44] dark that you can't see HUP around or
[1:34:48] anywhere else then he comes and makes a
[1:34:50] way through it for you that you might
[1:34:52] say this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:34:56] that he promised to do you said in that
[1:35:00] condition he think well am I really a
[1:35:02] Christian but God allows you to go
[1:35:05] through things to show forth his glory
[1:35:08] there's one thing about God he ain't
[1:35:10] gonna let nobody get the glory he ain't
[1:35:12] gonna let a doctor get his glory
[1:35:16] hello he's not gonna let her lawyer did
[1:35:19] his glory he's not gonna let a preacher
[1:35:21] get his glory I'm not the one that
[1:35:24] healed you when I laid my hands on you o
[1:35:26] mighty God he's the one that said lay
[1:35:32] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:35:33] it's not my hands it's not brother
[1:35:36] branham it's not the minister it's
[1:35:39] mighty God hallelujah but oftentimes we
[1:35:48] get caught up on the now we get caught
[1:35:52] up on the now and we messes up it messes
[1:35:55] up our vision our human vision for the
[1:35:57] future but it does not mess up God's
[1:36:00] vision we get caught up and think this
[1:36:04] has got to be this where that's gonna be
[1:36:06] that way we're looking at the now
[1:36:08] instead of the future but if you can
[1:36:11] look at the present and see that he is
[1:36:15] there I am of right now and the I am of
[1:36:18] the future don't get caught up on your
[1:36:22] now get caught up with your future you
[1:36:26] see just like a Lazarus when he was when
[1:36:29] he was there and Martha and Mary came
[1:36:31] running to Jesus when Jesus was in a
[1:36:33] certain city they came running into the
[1:36:35] city and they told him that her friend
[1:36:38] that their brother Jesus his friend
[1:36:40] Lazarus was was sick and they wanted him
[1:36:43] to come and restore him but Jesus turns
[1:36:47] and says that the sickness is not unto
[1:36:50] death now it takes a whole lot of faith
[1:36:55] to look past the now are you with me
[1:36:59] faith looks past the circumstance faith
[1:37:02] looks past the now because you had to
[1:37:05] realize for the disciples still to be
[1:37:08] walking with him here in a few moments
[1:37:10] in time when Lazarus dies that they
[1:37:13] realized who they were walking with they
[1:37:17] were not walking with just another
[1:37:19] fisherman but they were walking with
[1:37:21] Jesus and if you could realize tonight
[1:37:23] who you're walking with don't get caught
[1:37:31] up with what's going on in the USA you
[1:37:34] have been promised a body change no
[1:37:37] matter what Fox News CNN ABC NBC no
[1:37:41] matter what they say you have been
[1:37:44] promised something God is committed to
[1:37:49] bring it to pass but you see it took a
[1:37:52] lot of faith because you can't fix you
[1:37:54] can't mix faith and unbelief together
[1:37:57] and you can't mix reasoning and the word
[1:38:00] together well Martha come to this spot
[1:38:05] she had to believe against all odds she
[1:38:09] had to believe against death she had to
[1:38:11] believe against what she's seen in the
[1:38:13] natural eternal of me to Deuteronomy 16
[1:38:18] and to the Bible says here that thou
[1:38:27] shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover
[1:38:32] under the LORD thy God of the flock and
[1:38:35] the herd and in the place which the Lord
[1:38:36] shall choose to the Lord set used to
[1:38:40] place his name there that thou shall eat
[1:38:43] no leavened bread with it seven days
[1:38:45] shalt thou eat unleavened bread
[1:38:47] therewith even the bread of affliction
[1:38:49] for thou camest forth out of the land of
[1:38:52] Egypt in haste that thou mayest remember
[1:38:56] the day when thou came as forth out of
[1:38:59] the land of Egypt all the days of thy
[1:39:04] life you see notice where they are to
[1:39:07] sacrifice that it is in the place not
[1:39:11] where the priests but where the Lord
[1:39:13] chose to put his name there and any any
[1:39:18] father realizes that his son is carrying
[1:39:21] his name you realize today that God did
[1:39:25] not choose to put his name in any other
[1:39:27] place but in his son is where he chose
[1:39:31] to put his name jesus said I came in my
[1:39:35] father's name and you believe me not
[1:39:38] we're getting ready to go into Memorial
[1:39:41] Day this coming weekend this coming
[1:39:43] monday is Memorial Day it's a day of
[1:39:45] remembrance a day of remembering that we
[1:39:48] are a nation that is free to worship
[1:39:51] it's a time to remember those that were
[1:39:54] willing to fight for us it's a time to
[1:39:57] remember on what this nation was built
[1:40:00] on not on what Nancy Pelosi wants it to
[1:40:04] be but what we were built on it's a time
[1:40:09] of remembrance and here Moses is
[1:40:12] instructing them to remember the day
[1:40:16] that you came out
[1:40:17] to remember this day because you came
[1:40:20] out in haste and you couldn't breath you
[1:40:22] couldn't bring out the sacrifice in that
[1:40:24] day I remember this day remember the day
[1:40:28] that you came out the enemy the look
[1:40:31] that they had on their face when you
[1:40:33] came out not in half victory but full
[1:40:35] victory remember when you came out and
[1:40:39] you were no longer gonna be beat no more
[1:40:41] remember when you come out and you knew
[1:40:44] that you are going to come out shouting
[1:40:45] on the other side remember when he told
[1:40:49] you that he would make you the head and
[1:40:51] not the tail hallelujah
[1:40:54] it was a time to remember that this day
[1:40:57] is the last day that in Egypt we'll be
[1:41:02] able to beat you anymore
[1:41:04] it was a day to remember that you were
[1:41:07] the victor and Egypt was defeated it was
[1:41:10] a time to remember that Jehovah was the
[1:41:13] mighty God that showed up in their life
[1:41:16] if they could remember that they came
[1:41:19] out of Egypt what about you and I it's a
[1:41:24] time to remember that he called us how
[1:41:26] to Laodicea he called us how to
[1:41:28] denominationalism he called us he
[1:41:31] quickened us he changed us he made us
[1:41:38] hallelujah don't you ever forget that
[1:41:41] he's the one that brought you out
[1:41:45] Moses was setting a precedent that this
[1:41:48] is the day of memory how about this that
[1:41:54] you point on this day you put on this
[1:41:58] day you remember this day that it was
[1:42:00] for nine weeks that the devil kept you
[1:42:03] out of church it was for nine weeks a
[1:42:07] you couldn't worship the way you were
[1:42:09] built to be worshipped how about you
[1:42:11] remember this that all the blessings
[1:42:14] that the devil tried to steal from you
[1:42:16] why don't you remember this day making a
[1:42:19] Memorial Day
[1:42:22] I will once up in the place that the
[1:42:26] Lord chose to put his name this day is a
[1:42:31] day of memory this study this scripture
[1:42:40] is fulfilled
[1:42:41] Satan look like he had you bound up in
[1:42:44] your home I remember this day we came
[1:42:48] out stronger than when we went here
[1:42:52] remember this day we're closer to a body
[1:42:57] change remember this day that God is
[1:43:02] still committed through sickness food
[1:43:04] playing through cancer phutarmal
[1:43:07] remember this is the day which the Lord
[1:43:11] has made this is where we choose to
[1:43:18] sacrifice I'll say no like that kind of
[1:43:29] preaching that's what he's trying to
[1:43:32] keep from me for six weeks nine weeks
[1:43:35] you see there's no other resurrection
[1:43:37] there's no resurrection outside of the
[1:43:39] name of Jesus is that right there's no
[1:43:43] healing that's have the name Jesus
[1:43:45] there's no power in any other religion
[1:43:49] outside of this Christian religion you
[1:43:53] see because they have their worshippers
[1:43:55] they have the God that they worship but
[1:43:58] they're God's laying in it to your God
[1:44:00] ain't remember this day now look we look
[1:44:06] here and you see that they had to eat of
[1:44:09] the unleavened bread for seven days that
[1:44:11] there was no mixing that there was no
[1:44:14] entangle that they could not mix any
[1:44:17] leaven in with the bread that it had to
[1:44:19] be like a tasteless bread that it had to
[1:44:21] be in such a form that you would not mix
[1:44:24] it and you would not change it you see
[1:44:26] he was for a day amendments there being
[1:44:30] no mixing just like the tree that Eve
[1:44:33] ate from he
[1:44:34] is a mixed tree is there I it was a tree
[1:44:37] of good and evil and you can look at the
[1:44:39] societies of the day and you can see the
[1:44:42] Red Cross you can see their works but
[1:44:44] it's a mixed gospel that they're
[1:44:47] preaching you see the tree that they're
[1:44:52] eating off of
[1:44:52] now look here look here in Martha she
[1:44:57] had to forfeit all that she had rights
[1:44:59] through to recognize the Word of God was
[1:45:02] made manifest right before her he said I
[1:45:06] am the resurrection and the life that he
[1:45:09] that believeth in me though he were dead
[1:45:12] yet shall he live
[1:45:14] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:45:16] shall never die
[1:45:18] believe us now this see there was one
[1:45:21] more little clause that she hadn't come
[1:45:24] in Lambeth but she said yeh Lord I
[1:45:27] believe it that even now I believe that
[1:45:31] Howard the Christ the Son of the Living
[1:45:32] God oh brother everything was ready to
[1:45:35] spark off right then where have you laid
[1:45:39] him and you know what took place see you
[1:45:43] have got to get in that right place
[1:45:45] before he will receive your sacrifice
[1:45:48] see you got to come into it what's in
[1:45:51] the place which the Lord shall choose to
[1:45:54] place his name here thou shalt not eat
[1:45:57] no leavened bread in it
[1:45:59] what does that typify and the sacrifice
[1:46:02] don't mix with it it agreed it's got to
[1:46:05] be the word no leavened bread leaven is
[1:46:07] you know what eleven is in it anything a
[1:46:09] little leaven leavens the whole lump the
[1:46:12] whole lump is the body
[1:46:13] you can't put one speck of denomination
[1:46:16] or creating the Christ no sir it won't
[1:46:18] work seven days that's how eat
[1:46:22] unleavened bread there in seven days
[1:46:25] what does that typify the complete seven
[1:46:29] Church ages seven days what why did they
[1:46:32] why'd they have to eat it seven days
[1:46:35] before what before going out and the
[1:46:40] hard church age from the beginning to
[1:46:42] the end has to live only on the Word of
[1:46:45] God that
[1:46:47] so you're Roman Creed's Methodist
[1:46:49] Baptist and Pentecostal Creed's are all
[1:46:51] dead seven days eat unleavened bread no
[1:46:55] leaven shall be found amongst the bride
[1:46:57] no word at it no nothing you see they
[1:47:02] were to eat that bread for seven days
[1:47:06] which was a type of the church ages and
[1:47:09] what is a bread a type of that Jesus
[1:47:12] said that no man can live by bread alone
[1:47:15] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:47:18] the mouth of God
[1:47:20] jesus said I am the bread that came down
[1:47:23] from heaven we're not feeding on the
[1:47:27] mind of a man were feeding on the
[1:47:30] unfailing body Word of the Son of Man it
[1:47:35] was this pure word that took them out
[1:47:38] and it will be this pure word that will
[1:47:41] put the bride in a body change it's not
[1:47:46] a mixed word that's not living in it
[1:47:48] it's not a mixed word it's got hip-hop
[1:47:51] in it it's not a worship that's got all
[1:47:53] kinds of charismatic in it it's a pure
[1:47:56] word it's a pure worship because it's a
[1:47:59] pure bride that God is bringing forth
[1:48:04] hallelujah what are you doing brother
[1:48:08] hands were in this day I'm watching for
[1:48:10] God's promises to come to pass because I
[1:48:13] realize that everything that he has had
[1:48:15] in his word has got to come to
[1:48:17] fulfillment it's got to come to
[1:48:20] materialization I realize that there are
[1:48:23] those that will have to go by the way of
[1:48:25] the grave to fulfill that portion of
[1:48:28] Scripture that the dead in Christ shall
[1:48:30] rise first but there is a people that is
[1:48:34] going to fulfill the other part of that
[1:48:37] scripture that they that are alive and
[1:48:40] remain shall be changed in a moment in a
[1:48:43] twinkling of an eye
[1:48:48] hello somebody he's gonna watch that
[1:48:56] promise come to pass we were put here to
[1:49:00] watch him were put here to watch him as
[1:49:02] he works watch him bring forth his
[1:49:04] promise and make it come to pass but
[1:49:07] Laodicea makes us lazy and just because
[1:49:11] we're the bride of Jesus Christ now
[1:49:12] we're not a part of Laodicea
[1:49:14] but yet there are still those that get
[1:49:17] contaminated with the layout of saying
[1:49:19] flu that makes him lukewarm and cold and
[1:49:23] formal and they want to adapt in a way
[1:49:25] everybody else wants adapt but we are to
[1:49:28] be watching and living gospel we're to
[1:49:32] be watching this word as it's coming to
[1:49:35] pass this seemed what we have given to
[1:49:38] us is a living word it's not dead it's
[1:49:43] active there's a quickening power that
[1:49:47] is behind the safe the Lord there should
[1:49:52] be nothing shake us you know where you
[1:49:56] were at before this happened and before
[1:49:57] after this happened but there should
[1:50:00] have been no coronavirus if you were
[1:50:02] really settled and surrendered to God
[1:50:05] there should have been nothing that
[1:50:06] shook you off the promises of God sure
[1:50:10] it may have change how you worship may
[1:50:12] have changed what you had to do but it
[1:50:14] should not shake you from who you are
[1:50:18] because you have received a kingdom that
[1:50:20] cannot be shaken so many times you got
[1:50:25] people that let down their wall of
[1:50:26] defense and they forget that they are in
[1:50:29] a spiritual warfare and that the enemy
[1:50:32] is after them after their church after
[1:50:33] their children after the families after
[1:50:36] their job he wants to steal kill and
[1:50:38] destroy we're to be watching the
[1:50:44] promises of God notice what Isaiah 62
[1:50:47] and 6s let me wind this down for you to
[1:50:52] see notice Isaiah 62 and six I have set
[1:50:57] Watchmen upon thy walls o Jerusalem
[1:51:00] which shall never hold which shall never
[1:51:03] hold their peace day or night you that
[1:51:07] made bitching of the Lord keep not
[1:51:09] silence I'm gonna read it to you one
[1:51:10] more time I have set watchmen upon thy
[1:51:13] walls he is not saying that I am setting
[1:51:16] angels upon thy walls but I'm setting
[1:51:18] Watchmen there I am setting and what is
[1:51:21] in the precedent here is that he is
[1:51:23] setting ministers he is setting
[1:51:25] ministers upon our walls o Jerusalem
[1:51:28] which shall never hold their peace day
[1:51:32] nor night he that made mention of the
[1:51:35] Lord keep not silence you see those
[1:51:39] watchman were never to hold their peace
[1:51:42] do you think that I shut up when the
[1:51:46] enemy told us that we had to shut our
[1:51:48] doors no we held not our peace and we
[1:51:52] did not keep silence but we spoke hello
[1:51:57] whoo yeah now when you're looking to the
[1:51:59] scriptures and you see those Watchmen
[1:52:02] and how it was performed that it was
[1:52:05] performed by a loud cry that in the time
[1:52:08] of the days of the Bible that were
[1:52:10] reading here that they would go out in
[1:52:13] multiple hours of the day and they would
[1:52:15] speak these things with a loud voice and
[1:52:17] they would stand out there and holler to
[1:52:20] the caravans and to the rounds that were
[1:52:22] going by it would holler out God is one
[1:52:24] and then another would holler out he is
[1:52:28] merciful and then another would holler
[1:52:30] out take heed to yourselves hallelujah
[1:52:38] and you're here the ministers of this
[1:52:41] gospel holler out taking God is merciful
[1:52:46] God is good that is good all the time
[1:52:49] and all the time God is good God is one
[1:52:55] God is a healer God is a savior
[1:52:58] God is a deliverer and you look in I in
[1:53:04] Psalms chapter 134 and you get a
[1:53:07] beautiful picture of the temple watch
[1:53:13] behold come that'll bless you the Lord
[1:53:17] all you servants of the Lord which my
[1:53:19] night stand in the house of the Lord
[1:53:21] lift up your hands in the sanctuary and
[1:53:24] bless the Lord the Lord that made heaven
[1:53:28] and earth bless thee out of Zion now
[1:53:31] this is what the temple watch would do
[1:53:34] will you say well I'm not a minister of
[1:53:36] the gospel Jesus Christ but do you
[1:53:38] realize that the Bible said that he hath
[1:53:41] made us kings and priests so you can
[1:53:45] come into the sanctuary and you can lift
[1:53:48] up your hands and bless the Lord that
[1:53:51] made heaven and earth Psalms 135
[1:53:57] praising the Lord praise you the name of
[1:54:00] the Lord praise him oshi servants of the
[1:54:03] Lord ye that stand in the house of the
[1:54:06] Lord in the courts of the house of our
[1:54:08] God praise the Lord for the Lord is good
[1:54:13] sing praises unto his name for it is
[1:54:16] pleasant for the lord hath chosen Jacob
[1:54:19] under himself and Israel for his
[1:54:21] peculiar treasure for I know that the
[1:54:24] Lord is great and that our Lord is above
[1:54:27] all gods
[1:54:29] I'd say that that is a temple watch that
[1:54:32] is going on through coronavirus that our
[1:54:35] God is above all gods hello that you can
[1:54:43] enter into I know some of you I don't
[1:54:46] had word come to me through text message
[1:54:49] and calling and different things and you
[1:54:51] couldn't wait for them doors open back
[1:54:53] there why because you wanted to do what
[1:54:59] God puts you here to do and that's the
[1:55:01] worship Nile we God but a mighty God
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:15] hallelujah you see the word is high
[1:55:18] protection the word is our law it's our
[1:55:21] protection from the enemy and the enemy
[1:55:24] wants you to let down your guard so that
[1:55:27] he can breach the walls but we are told
[1:55:30] to be sober and to be vigilant because
[1:55:32] your adversary the devil goes about like
[1:55:34] a roaring lion seeking whom he may
[1:55:36] devour who we are to resist steadfast in
[1:55:41] the faith the enemy wants to break down
[1:55:43] your belief system the enemy wants to
[1:55:47] breach the walls but the Bible said in
[1:55:51] Psalms 89 and 34 that my covenant will I
[1:55:54] not break nor alter the thing that is
[1:55:56] gone out of my lips once I have sworn by
[1:55:59] my holiness that I will not lie on to
[1:56:01] David and his seed shall endure forever
[1:56:03] and his throne as the son before me it
[1:56:06] shall be established forever as the moon
[1:56:09] and as a faithful witness in heaven
[1:56:11] shall I you realize that the enemy wants
[1:56:16] to break down the word but God will
[1:56:18] never break and God would never alter
[1:56:20] his word you see the enemy wants to get
[1:56:24] you as far away from this word as he can
[1:56:27] you see when Jesus was there on Mount
[1:56:30] temptation he tempted Jesus for him to
[1:56:36] be made like a man he had Ashley go
[1:56:38] through temptation just like you and I
[1:56:41] was tempted like we're tempted he had to
[1:56:45] be tempted so Jesus had to get into a
[1:56:47] spot and Jesus having the power to be
[1:56:51] able to reverse it but he only gives
[1:56:54] Satan what'd you give him and that's the
[1:56:57] word you see what he was trying to do is
[1:57:01] he was trying to get Jesus to break that
[1:57:03] word you see he got Eve to break that
[1:57:06] word he got Moses to break that word he
[1:57:08] got David and Solomon to break that word
[1:57:11] but when he met the man Jesus he met
[1:57:14] more than a man that day and he could
[1:57:16] not break that word because the Lord was
[1:57:19] him
[1:57:21] do you realize who's standing amongst
[1:57:23] you tonight that is the same yesterday
[1:57:26] today and forever
[1:57:28] Jesus that will not change will not
[1:57:31] alter you see he will try to get you
[1:57:38] away from this world I try to break you
[1:57:41] try to break you from believing this
[1:57:43] word but he could not take you he cannot
[1:57:48] break you because you and the world have
[1:57:51] been united by taking on our headship
[1:57:56] Jesus Christ who what you have received
[1:58:00] in this hour is not another message but
[1:58:03] it is the message to return back to our
[1:58:05] wall of Defense our wall of fire this
[1:58:10] message that we have received is not a
[1:58:12] king's message but the Kings message
[1:58:17] lelou yeah we got something to believe
[1:58:20] here we got something to be proud about
[1:58:24] we got something to be excited about we
[1:58:28] got something that we can count on he's
[1:58:35] tried to stop this King sword in every
[1:58:38] way possible from preaching he's tried
[1:58:42] to stop it from cutting he's trying to
[1:58:45] stop it from discerning but Satan was
[1:58:48] defeated 2,000 years ago and he's
[1:58:52] defeated in this day why because God is
[1:58:56] committed to the purpose he's committed
[1:58:59] to his work he's committed to you you
[1:59:05] see because you were a part of a vision
[1:59:08] hallelujah you are part of his plan oh
[1:59:12] yeah and sickness may try to rob you
[1:59:15] from him car wrecks may try to rob you
[1:59:18] from him yeah but you're part of the
[1:59:21] vision
[1:59:23] hello when he struck the side when he
[1:59:28] struck that side it was not another
[1:59:30] creation but it was a part of the same
[1:59:33] creation you are not another bride you
[1:59:38] are the bride there's been churches
[1:59:41] churches Brides Brides but they must
[1:59:43] come on you're not of her you are the
[1:59:47] bride hallelujah we should not keep our
[1:59:58] salads nor should we hold our peace we
[2:00:01] should let our brains loose we should
[2:00:04] let our faith loose
[2:00:05] [Applause]
[2:00:07] we're not another creation we're a part
[2:00:10] of him and if Jesus could not be stopped
[2:00:13] you can't be stopped
[2:00:15] [Applause]
[2:00:18] you are the masterpiece you are a piece
[2:00:23] of the master we should not keep our so
[2:00:34] much he's trying to muzzle us down he's
[2:00:41] trying to keep us from speaking but if
[2:00:44] Abraham had to let it loose from his
[2:00:47] mouth and declare that me and Isaac will
[2:00:50] return again if Abraham had declared
[2:00:54] from his lips what about you hallelujah
[2:00:58] if the three Hebrew children had to
[2:01:00] declare it and speak it forth from their
[2:01:02] mouth they didn't hold their peace
[2:01:04] that he keeps silent but they declared
[2:01:06] from their mouth that yea we may die but
[2:01:09] our God is more than able to deliver us
[2:01:12] from this coronavirus from this fire
[2:01:14] from this sickness from this death they
