the house of the Lord a't it amen good to see each and every one of you and I'm not speaking this morning so just breathe deep amen we have brother Tommy Richmond with us and we so are so thrilled to have him and his wife and and son with us today and and uh he's been here doing a testimonial with brother Gabriel I'm looking I'm personally looking forward to that and so I don't know if you've ever seen any of his shorts on the videos but if you can get linked into that that'd be a really good deal it's a lot of fun and so he's a country boy like we all are and so we're so glad to have you guys with us in the house of the Lord if you get a chance shake their hands and and uh I I know that I know you'll enjoy them brother Markus good to see you and he was on his way a couple weeks ago and had a boo boo and so we're we're glad you made it today and so God bless you been a buddy been a buddy a long time and good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen amen isn't he wonderful did you enjoy last night I I tell you I enjoyed it I I I would like to just take a minute and sometimes you I I I want you to absorb what is going on I I've always tried to make sure that that we have just just incredible men of God that comes and preaches and and uh I've always wanted there's certain men there's certain men that have become very close to me and and brother Kelly hildbrand has been one of those men and I I wanted him to be around the boys I wanted to be around my family because he has an he has an incredible aura about him he's a real man he's a prince and I've watched him in the difficulties of life and I've just seen it how that how that he's handled himself and he's not just a prince in the pull pit but he's a prince outside of the pull pit and many years ago I was on my way for I just want to catch you up kind of kind of a thing many years ago we were on our way to the convention at brother Harold hilderbrand and we were in the car we were going we were going to the church and brother Harold was driving and and he said brother Ron he said uh this morning he said he said there's a guy that's going to be in service I want you to befriend I said okay and I said well how will I know him he said well he's he's he's he's tall he's kind of Slender he's dark-headed and he has dark Rim glasses okay and he said he'll Stand Out said you're going to really like him and so I entered the pull pit and I begin to preach and I found him quickly and so and he and sister Myra and I I think sister Mya and Connie look a lot alike and so and so we have good taste I was at a meeting and Cone wasn't able to be with us and somebody said it was so good to see sister Connie with brother Ron well it wasn't sister Connie you know and he he was telling me about it so after service I I met brother Kelly in the foyer and uh they would say foyer in Canada so I met I met him in the fourer and and we begin to talk and we struck up a friendship and it's been a phenomenal friendship and and the more that I got to know brother Kelly the more I liked him don't you like a friend like that you know you don't find out a bunch of boo boos a bunch of nonsense and and I just I found him to be the kind of friend that I would like to be and so the scripture tells us and I I want to and this is the reason I want to take that friendship is an incredible thing and it's a god-given thing and if you'll remember that God had a friend in Abraham and the reason brother brandham said that he had a friend in Abraham is he could trust him and he had confidence in him the scripture tells us that a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother and he said a friend loveth at all times so when it comes to all times there's going to be some spots to where you're going to have to look over Humanity well that's just the human part and you're going to have to look over it and and and so a and so a friend loveth at all things and a brother is born for a friendship brother Brandon would make a statement he says you can't buy friendship with money friendship is a gift of God when I was in the hospital with leing in a coma about a month the doctors would tell me later said we knew the kind of man that you was and the quality of man that you was because of the friends that came to see you and so we knew how great that you was he said he said you know we said patients come in they're in the bed they're in bad shape and we take care of them week after week after week but he says how we know you is by your friends that come to see you I want to say this to you young people you're known by your friends you're known by your friends and listen we all have friends in the world that's right we all have friends and and listen a person that draws you away from God they're not your friend are you with me but a person that loves you for who you are and can appreciate what you are that's a friend to you I'm thankful that God has given me many friends and some of those are friends that have preached here throughout the years and brother brother Tim has been a friend to me brother Donnie Reagan brother Joe grien I can stand here and name them through the ages and I these men become allies in our battle you know you you know that's where you really find out who's your buddy is when you're in a battle they'll stand shoulder toosh shoulder with you they'll look the devil in the eye they won't stand and say you must have sinned come on come on they'll stand there with you and they'll they'll be with you you in your battle since a young man since a boy since maybe some of the size of these young guys I I've been raised in Ministry and I was raised at brother fure church and and it was a wonderful time it was there that I got to meet some incredible preachers there is where first place that I met brother bisc there I met brother uh Henry green and and brother Perry green and brother Junior Jackson and I and I noticed I noticed those men as as I begin to grow up and and and I saw them and I I begin to respect them not worship them but begin to respect them for who they are and I begin to I begin that's that's one of the ways that I have have tried in my life to be the kind of a friend that young people would appreciate that they could walk up to me and talk to me and not above anybody else I think it's important I think it's incredibly important I saw the importance as a young man to have powerful friends around me to watch over things and help me you see friendship is a two-way relationship it's not just all you it's it's work it's work there there's communication that's involved and and and going to see one another and enjoying one another's con uh and You Begin to grow closer and strengthen and that Bond begins to get better the scripture tells us about David and Jonathan and they became the kind of a Blood Brother relationship and and David would never ever forget that and so even in his older age he would go and find michef and make sure that michef that though he was had lived in an exile he brought it him into his King Kingdom and it was because of the relationship with Jonathan and being a real friend to him that he could bring mbf in we met we meet many different types you know brother brandom said there uh you know there are certain people that you just really like and those different kind of things and there's going to be people with you that will be with you just for a short period of time and and you know they will go their different ways and some people will be with you because you're headed in the same direction that they are and so you realize that but in the whole scheme of things God will give you people that will become close to you some will become bosom friends and I'm grateful to have brother Kelly as a bosom friend amen I've lived long enough now to know that difference of friendships even even generals God has raised generals to to preach this message I'd like to just stop and say this to you I appreciate these men of God and I believe I've conveyed that to you as an audience that they're not just here for the weekend but I want their effect to be Long and Lasting amen yes I mean that I mean that brother Kelly is one of those friends that's a general and I I I really I really appreciate him many years ago I sat with him and when his church was much smaller than it is and I sat there you know I told him I said brother Kelly God's going to bless your church because of who you are and the nature that you've got today his church is full he's got a wonderful Church of people that love they love you they love you they may have never been here but they love you brother Vernon you've got a you've got a fan club you got a fan club and and so they love you as a group of people isn't that wonderful you know and you just you just wish that everybody was quite like that and I and as I grew up and I was beginning to figure out who could be your friends and who's not your friends you know I just in life just like in life you meet jerks preachers yeah they're just jerks none of them will ever preach here I have another way to say it they're fools now listen brother Ron you're talking about preachers brother Donnie Ran's been talking about preachers for a year and you guys listen to brother Donnie Reagan so I I think I got a license here but I certainly admire great men and I admire our relationship I I think of the phenomenal Miracles that have happened as I can look back with brother Kelly being here he walked into the pool pit last night and he told us his topic brother Shannon I've been working four weeks on that topic and I sat there and I go God you're so perfect you're so perfect and brother Kelly delivered an absolute Masterpiece last night I want to say this to you and I I want you to know when God grant you a friend appreciate it as much as I appreciate every one of you sitting here and I love you I don't want to change you God made you who you are he don't made us make he don't want us to be a bunch of clones amen he pre-planned you as an as an individual and and and that's how much I love you with all my hearts and so I I wanted I ask Andrew if it'd be all right if I just just talk to you just for a moment cuz sometimes you know when you're new you think well you know just Brother Kelly's just one of the guys well he's well he's not amen he's more than just one of the guys he's one of my dearest friends and and I I so appreciate it I told Brother him that I was going to have this little address and he said he wish he was here to hear it well he'll probably hear it anyway and so we love you brother Kelly with all of our hearts thank you thank you amen amen maybe in my new body I'll be as nice and natured as he is and sweet and kind and can you help me any sister Myra with the more adjectives and amen sister Myra thank you thank you for being here let's give her a hand as well Andrew I know you didn't want to but I want you to come and sing after that i' I've call men fools and jerks maybe you can put it all back together but I gave deep admiration I I want I want you to have friends I want you did everybody get the point I want you to have friends like God's given me a friend amen thank you brother Kelly amen amen Blessed Assurance oh Jesus is [Music] my he's been my fourth man and the fire but time after time oh born of his [Music] Spirit washing his blood and what he did for me on count is more than know I trust in God my savior the one who will never fail he will never fail a perfect submission all is at rest I know the author of Tomorrow has ordered my steps so this is my [Music] story and this is my song I'm praising my Risen King and S for the day long say I trust so I trust in God my savior are the one who will never fail he will never fail so I trust in God oh my savior the one who will

never fail he'll never fail so I trust in God I saor the one who will [Music] never God bless you it's good to be back in the house of the Lord again this morning good to see each and every one of you I appreciated the kind words that brother Ron shared this morning morning and I say those words are reciprocal we' found a great friend and brother Ron over the years and we certainly do appreciate him and stand for this message and where there's like we would say it where we're from in the North through the thick and the thin he's been a friend and we certainly do appreciate that and we certainly do love him his family with all of our hearts it's good to have sister Mara with me somebody asked me yesterday how many years we've been married and we've been married for 44 years years now seems like it was just yesterday here we are 44 years eight grandchildren and by God's grace they all love the Lord to me that's the most important thing is you can evangelize the whole world but what about your family to me family is very important and right here in Virginia we feel like we're part of your family amen and we can certainly say that we are the family of the Lord amen aren't you grateful for that today amen if you have a request upon your heart let's just go to the Lord in prayer this morning Father we love you with all of our heart with all of our soul with all of our might Lord our whole being Lord Lord what would we do in life if I hadn't been free [Music] you how you move father people into people's lives Lord if it hadn't been for this message Lord we wouldn't even know these people here in Virginia but because of this message Lord You've connected us worldwide Lord with saints of God of like Precious faith and Lord just one moment in many of their midst it's like you've known him for an eternity we thank you for it Lord we come this morning Lord with needs in our lives no doubt there's needs in in every person's life that is here Lord those that are by way of streaming we pray Lord somehow supernaturally Lord you can reach out and touch each one Lord we've studied Lord we've looked into your word Lord but it takes you the Divine interpreter of it Lord to come on the scene and we pray father that you would move this morning in a supernatural way way that you'd strengthen us Lord strengthen my voice Lord and father if you wouldn't show up Lord then it would be in vain that would' be here so we're counting on you Lord Heal the sick Lord deliver the captive if there's any that don't know you as Savior personally Lord may this morning Lord be a moment for them Lord that they'd be able to come Lord and give their hearts and lives to you Lord take control now of this service Lord every Spirit father that be contrary Lord we pray father that it be bound in the name of the Lord I yield myself to you father soul body and spirit For Your Glory that you would have your perfect way this this morning we commit now this service onto you in Jesus Christ Our Lord we pray amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord if you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to turn turn quickly if we could to the book of Ephesians 1: 14- 23 It's a Wonderful presence in the house of the Lord this morning amen if you could just give me just a bit more my monitor as well this morning I'd be much appreciated as well probably at home I'm probably the the sound technician's greatest nightmare I'm always looking for more Monitor and they're always telling me that it's always to the top and I say well just do what you can do and and it would be good this a beautiful scripture Ephesians chapter 1:1 14-23 it says which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him aren't you thankful for that the eyes of our of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power with which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead set him at the right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principalities and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath let's say hath this morning and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is Bo which is his body the fullness of him that filth all and all amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning last night we spoke on the the Tabernacle and in the the tent that was made in the in the wilderness years with Moses in Solomon's Tabernacle and it's always a wonderful thing when we hear the word it's finished we can say this morning that Christ died upon the cross and when Christ died he said it was finished and was finished once and for all and it's been completed for the past 2,000 years Jesus Christ finished the work and paid the price of complete Redemption at Calvary when he died brother Bram says now we have to look up there and believe it and this morning we are believers we believe the word of the Lord is true and we believe that God has sent us a message for a purpose and that message is to dress a bride for the coming of the of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning for a few moments I'd like to speak to uh to you on this topic Christ the word is welcome in our midst Christ the word is welcome in our midst and I'd like to subtitle it headship uh as a subtitle we need headship in this hour just as Moses was given a blueprint the blueprint gave him the Articles and gave him the the the thoughts on how to build a tabernacle we've been given a blueprint in this hour amen and we've been brought back into a place of headship and we know that the headship is the word of God in the passion translation I'd like to read Ephesians 1:14 it says he has given to us like an engagement ring is given to a bride as the first installment of what's coming he is our hope promise of a future inheritance which seals us until we have all of redemption's promises and experience complete Freedom all for the Supreme glory and honor of God he's given to us like an engagement ring which is the earnest of our inheritance amen which we know is the holy spirit in each one of our Lives Amen to try to live this message without the Holy Ghost it's a miserable existence but when you have the Holy Ghost in your heart and the holy ghost in your life then you have an inside power that continues to propel you according to the word of almighty God Amen we need the Holy Ghost more than we've ever needed him in our lives and we can say this morning with a great assurance that the Holy Ghost himself has come back into the Church of the Living God Amen and what is he doing he's preparing us for that great time of a Rapture I don't know about you but I'm looking forward to a Rapture brother brandham says that everything is pre-planned by God he knew where you would be sitting this morning he knows all about you he knows that the color of shirt you'd be wearing the color of tie that you'd be wearing he knows your life from the beginning to the end amen he's almighty God and he he pre-planned that you would actually receive the word of God for this day and allow the word to become headship within your life amen do you believe that this morning amen I'd like to also read a couple of scriptures Ephesians 52627 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word amen the word has to become preeminent in our in our lives first place in our life Amen brother bradam says that when you came to God he gave you a new spirit amen that Spirit wasn't the Holy Spirit but was a new spirit to get along with his spirit amen because we couldn't get along with ourselves but he gave us a change of nature amen and that change of nature was very very important to every one of our Lives amen because the word of God we were naturally at enity with it but when Christ came into our lives amen gave us a new nature and then he put his word in our life and he gave us his own own Spirit within our lives now we can accept the word then there's nothing in us to repel against the word but in our heart we say Amen to the word amen because there's something deposited down inside of you and brother Bram said that when you say Amen when I say Amen it's watering that seed life that's within our heart amen and that seed life will grow into the into the grace of almighty God Amen it changes our nature brother Ron was talking about my nature I have such a nice nature and sister Mara was driving home last night she says he just doesn't know you that well yet I said man that one stung me [Laughter] hard we say like this we're glad he knows me the way he knows me but I told her as I dve hope it's okay I'm at home here this morning I told her I said you know what sometimes we we get a little revved up in our nature that's just a human thing everybody smiling thank God for the blood amen but we we we come back into line with the word of the Lord amen what is it we want our lives to emanate Christ amen if you stand in a line and you're grumbling complaining people are around you listening they wonder who in the world world is on Amen but when you take it as it comes and you say Lord you know the reason why I'm here you know the reason why it's taking longer than it should take amen and then we start to realize that God is the one in control amen it's like driving in your car you can drive in your car on the interstate and everybody's a bad driver except for you but yet the person in the other car thinks everybody else is a bad driver except for them amen I feel like I'm at home now I think we're right at home right where we say where the rubber hits a road amen but the word has to have preeminence in our life what would purpose would the word be if there was no preeminence we don't have no Creeds we don't have no dogmas we don't have any additions to the word we have just the word and I thank God it is that way why is it that way because it needs to wash us of our carnal nature amen and it continues to wash us amen what for what purpose that he might present it to himself amen he wants something presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish what a master planner God has amen he didn't just make a plan and just wonder if it was going to work he made a plan and he watched over his plan to make sure it would work in each one of our lives and I say that that's working well and it's bringing us into the image that we need to get to in order for a Rapture amen I'm tired of this past house I'm tired of of the ladyo see I'm tired of everything that we go through I'm looking forward to getting out of here one day amen it's time to take our flight amen it's time to bring ourselves back into subjection to the word of God now Christ to have preeminence on our life amen we're going to have some headship amen I'd rather Christ as my head amen when we're when we came from the world the world was headship over us but we came into Christ he became headship over us amen and we got a new person as brother as Paul said he was a love slave unto Jesus Christ I believe this morning hour We're a love slave unto him amen and everything he desires from his church we're willing to lay aside all of our thoughts amen for the Perfection of the word of God Amen we're to be sanctified from our old carnal nature Jesus speaking that they are not of the world even as I'm not of the world Amen which is a cosmos the world order as it said in a state of unbelief to the word of God if there's ever a Time the world is ecumenical it's in this hour it don't matter if you're Muslim it don't matter if you're Hindu it don't matter if you're denomination if you're Catholic or Orthodox they all think they're going to the same heaven but it's not what my Bible says amen Jesus Christ is the door to the Sheepfold and every person that comes through there must come through exactly through that door and allow Christ to be headship we don't get to heaven on just good nature amen there's a lot of good nature people we don't get to heaven just because we're kind to one another we get to heaven because we've been born again by the spirit of almighty God Amen and allow the word of God to take full control over our lives and our being Hallelujah Christ wants wants to have preeminence amen he's interested in us Opening Our Lives up and our hearts to the word he wants it to be enthroned in our lives he wants our lives to be separated from the chaos of the world Amen he wants us to be in a place where whether we're up or down we can still have a have a a Level Playing Field where we can walk and we can talk about the glory of God I encourage the people back home as well you're known by your friends very similar words that brother Ron used to the young people you're known by who you hang around with and any person that wants to move you off of the mark of the word that's not your friend that's not your friend any person that would try to challenge you to come out from underneath the world that's a person you need to run away from that's right amen you got to be like Joseph and use some discernment amen you got to move away from the things that would try to pull you you away from the glory of the Lord amen Satan would try to harm your lives but the word of God is here to protect your lives amen I'm glad that we're protected by the word of God Amen allow Christ to be preminent in your life young people allow his word to be first placed within your heart amen anything outside of that just lay it aside I grew up in a church of have a lot of young people and I found very quickly that not a lot of them love to serve the Lord amen but was in my heart to serve the Lord amen I grew up in as in The Message Church 1966 my dad started coming I was 5 years old amen and I realized that if you're going to have to make a stand you'll have to stand alone at times amen when you get a friend in your life that loves the Lord relish that with all your heart amen that tries to keep moving you back into the center line amen that is a real friend a friend that will stand beside you whether it's thick or thin whatever it is and I say to the young people be thankful for other young people that love the Lord with all of their heart amen allow Christ to have supreme authority over your life which is the word amen now we know that the bride was to receive the word in the end time hour and Christ is the intelligence behind the word amen he's the intelligence within the SE Gene back home I was min mining on these Realms and and we have farmers in our congregation and when you put a wheat seed in the ground you expect it to Bear wheat amen why the intelligence is in the seed amen and as that seed is watered with natural rain then that seed starts to come into a place of maturity amen it comes up through different stages but the final stages is is the is the grain that's inside of the head amen the the farmer gets excited when the when it starts to come up under the ground but the most exciting time is when he's combining amen because why what in the ground is what came back to maturity again amen and we've got a word in this hour that's bringing a bride to maturity and the intelligence behind that word is Christ himself amen he's the one that's have preeminence in the church he's the one that we welcome in the church amen he's the one that that will bring you to Perfection it's Christ the word or nothing it's the intelligence within the seed amen that's why when the seed word was in your heart it started to come to a place of maturity amen I I we have people that come right out of the world Amen they wonder what happened I said what's transpired is there was a SE Gene in your life you didn't even know it was there but it was put in you before the foundation of the world Amen and that seed that's in your life when it hit the right circumstance it come to life amen and it started to change you it changed you from an unbeliever to a Believer amen what did Peter say in the day of Pentecost he said repent every one of you in other words change your mind about what you thought about Christ amen and turn your mind now toward Christ amen and it will give you it will start to grow within your being then it's no longer I that live that you that live but it's Christ that lives within you the hope of glory he's the one in charge of your life that's why when I look at God he's a great master plan he put everything in its Orit he put everything in its order amen even till the very air we breathe if it was off a little bit this way or that way we would certainly die amen but God has it in order you put your car in a grb and you start it up you'll suffocate and you'll die of poisoning we drive them all day long on our highways amen but the air purifies itself God the great the great architect in everything well amen I want to say this morning he's done everything well and he continues to do everything well you are the reciprocate of this grand plan that God had before the foundation of the world Amen we are the recipiant of the word of almighty God somebody say praise the Lord prise the Lord amen I want to declare this morning that Christ is for you Christ is in you Christ is over you and he's the one that's going to bring you to an expected end amen he said I Am With You Always even till the end of the world Amen he said I am with you every day until the completion of this age it's such an assurance within our heart to realize that Christ is with you right Christ is for you amen he's the one that started the good work that's why I love Philippians so much he which begun the good work in my heart is able to complete until that day of redemption he's the one that's in control oh there's sometimes we think we're in control sometimes we think we're making our own Direction then God just gives us a wakeup call and we realize how much we need him in our lives I never want to go a day without him in my life amen he's the one that saved me he's the one that's keeping me he's almighty God and the message is the rising of the sun I hope I can have I don't know what time you usually I'm just going to take my time this morning amen and I might be a little longer maybe this morning than yesterday but I trust it'll be okay amen it's a ing of the sun I just want to put a couple quotes that's what he proved that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead and the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world was to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom and the bride was to come forth because it's part of him let's say I'm part of him and it can only be man the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the Revelation any others has spoken of the Bride amen it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh flesh and bone of his bone and life of his life and power of his power she is him amen she is him as a man and a woman are one and a woman taken from his side she was taken a spirit had taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics amen Christ is the one he's the mechanics and he's the Dynamics amen and he is the head of the church amen without a head what would it be amen without somebody taken the lead amen that's why the order of the home is the husband is is under God Amen and the wife is under the husband amen not a floor mat but together they're working in together in Christ amen we're workers together amen some people think well I'm the boss now because I'm the head of the house no that just shows you're not the boss amen a boss don't have to tell anybody he's the boss he conducts himself like a child of the king amen and he gives his family leadership and something to follow after amen just as Christ gave leadership to the Church of the Living God amen we follow his example where it says to be baptized we're baptized where it says that Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he's ahead now the church goes up in Revelation chapter 3 which it goes up in the Rapture brother brother brandom said that when John went up and he was he was caught away in the spirit and he came through the open door he was representing the entire church amen the bride of Christ and he goes up in Revelation three or Revelation three at the end of it and we're right at that time friends where we're ready to go up in the Rapture amen I say don't miss it amen if Christ is not your head then I recommend allow Christ to become your head amen if you don't have the Holy SP Spirit then I recommend be sure to get the Holy Spirit call out to God for the holy spirit in your life amen Christ is the word and he is the pattern amen he is the head and the he's the intelligence of the whole body nothing can operate without him amen that's the reason why in Revelation one he stands in the midst of the seven golden candle stands he's watching over his own church amen he had seven stars in his hands and each one of those men they gave their life for the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen they were they were not just coming with their own word but they were coming with the word of God for the season that they lived in I want to say this morning we live in the grandest season we could ever live in it's a fulfillment of all things the full revelation of the word of God is here amen we should be thankful for what God has done he's given I SA that we can see he's given us ears that can hear Hallelujah Glory Glory if I feel like I'm screaming I'm not screaming and if I looks like I'm mad I'm mad at the Devil amen Christ has got to be be preeminent know or not there is nothing can make it run but him whether it's God the Father God the Holy Ghost whether it's the Angels principalities Powers dominions whatever it is all things run by him and all things consist by him amen he's the head of the body the church who's the beginning the beginning of the firstborn from the dead that is raised up what he come to redeem that in all things let's say all things say one more time all things he might have the preeminence might have the preeminence you know what that means that over all he is over all things that was ever created every Angel every being amen that's why the Devil he's just a tool in the hand of God Amen when you realize the devil's just a bluff he got nothing to give you amen he tries to tell you to do this and he calls the cops on you amen he tries he tells you to do something he runs to the father and starts accusing you I say dumb devil amen I'll use brother bram's word Satan watch out amen this bride is coming to maturity in this hour amen we're no longer like the first Eve amen we are the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah is he afraid of you no but he's afraid of the god that's inside of your bosom that's who he has to mind all the fullness of all things all the fullness of God fullness of the Angels Till fullness of time the fullness of Eternity everything dwelt in him that's his fell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in Heaven There is a great being we're talking about the beginning of the creation of God now the church that's his very whole purpose was the church now how did we get into the church by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body the church the body of Christ it cannot fail I say this morning it cannot fail heavens and earth will pass away but God's word is eternal amen it's not you holding but it's God who's holding on to you amen the Bible says he's not going to lose one oh Satan tries to tell us that he's going to we're going to fall off but we're not falling off I said last night where there's no quit in us there's no quit in a child of God Amen you see people come and they they decide to walk away I say what are you going to walk away to amen thou alone Hast the words of eternal life amen God has everything he's become preeminent in our lives amen he holds first place in our heart amen we're no longer just under any anointing but we're underneath an eagle anointing in this hour church amen the Supreme intelligence is here amen we've come through the complete body but now we're into Supreme intelligence of almighty God Amen we're into the place where God is the one overseeing his whole church come on church amen I know I'm preaching to blesses Believers this morning amen God is in control he's the one that's guiding Our Lives amen it should put a joy in our heart and should put a bounce on our step knowing that God is in control I think brother brandham uses some words that we should put our joy shoes on Amen I say let let everybody know that you're happy amen we should let everybody know you say I had one brother said well I can't help the way I look I said well it takes less muscles to do the other than the other amen we need to put Joy shoes on Amen we're about to take take a Rapture if that's not going to Thrill your heart what's going to Thrill your heart amen Christ is preeminent he's the one in control first place in everything we do preeminent in all the intelligence that's moving through the Bride of Jesus Christ in the church age book brother brandom says that the Bride As thus sayith the Lord in her now but she waits until she knows what he wants done with it amen we've got so committed to God until we can say like Jesus I don't do anything unless the father shows me amen we we move into a channel amen a channel that's that's moving us up higher amen I say if you're Earthbound it's time to move higher it's time to let loose of of the shackles of this life amen it's time to move up into the Heavenly places amen Pat's Vision brother Brown said each Church A's messenger is depicted his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost amen and if the reformers lives could be on fire how much more the end time messenger who was a message of restoration amen and this message of restoration was bringing us into a place where all the lines that were Tangled become untangled and I say it's good to keep them that way it's good to allow the Holy Ghost to to keep his word running freely amen every believer is depicted in in the word of God Amen Lives full of Victory lives that are full of joy lives that are full of Peace amen not haphazardly living through life amen but lives that are full of the power of the Holy Ghost amen a church has predestinated every name that's ever put on the book Jesus come to redeem and when the last name is redeemed the book is closed amen we're in that time frame amen where the last seed will come in I believe at any time for all we know it could already be in amen but I know one day the last will come in amen I have lost loved ones and I say Lord move on the hearts of my lost Brothers amen loved ones that that would want to I would want to see them in the kingdom of God Amen I have one brother and the Lord starting to move on his heart and he said he we were just in Cologne a few days ago and and and he said to me he said is the end of the world coming for everybody or just for one person I said well the Lord's starting to speak to his life I said well the end of the world is coming it could come for any person any moment amen but there's coming a time when the bride is taken taken from here amen you I can see the Lord starting to minister to his life through his life I just say this as a testimony U my brothers were all were all home for my dad's 88th birthday I think I mentioned as a brother Ron and it was the first time in 44 years that all my brothers were together in the same church that's a miracle a real miracle I look at it Lord move on their heart time is short amen May the same God that moves in our lives move in their lives amen that's what my concern is that Christ would come into their heart Amen to bring him back to his own I've seen God take my mother and father amen that were that were messaged Believers that went backslid and can bring them back into the word amen you see them today you'd never know they ever not have not have not been in the word amen my mom calls me and she tells me she said honey the Lord's taken care of me I said Mom the Lord promised to take care of you it doesn't matter how old you are how young you are he's still the same God Amen he takes care of the young he takes care of the middle age he takes care of the old age amen he's almighty God Amen we may get weaker in our body but he's still almighty God he gives us strengthen our heart and strengthen our souls hallelujah praise the name of the Lord the Bible says that God was going to restore all the years that the Palmer worm canker worm C pillars that great Army that came amongst and started to take down the church and they was going to restore it back to its original state it started with a seed and it started and that seed move up the life that was in the seed manifest itself in the plant just as the stock represented justification under Luther so the tassel represent a sanctification under Wesley and brother brand said that the shucker the husk represented Pentecost of 1906 amen but now we're back to the seed grain again amen where the fullness of the word can come back into the church again what's a purpose for the fullness of the word we know the Seven Seals needed to be open for the word to be fully restored and God would only allow that not in a denominational setting but in the Church of the Living God Amen where the word would come open onto the to the church amen so the third poll of the message should come into full effect amen so that God could have supreme authority over his subjects amen I'm glad for the first poll of or the first phase of brother Brown's mystery in the second poll but I'm very thankful for the fo third poll of his ministry amen which gave us an open book A book where we could look in and see our names on the Lamb's Book of Life amen that's why John rejoiced in heaven amen when he saw that his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life it brought a rejoicing in his heart amen I believe it brings a rejoice in every one of our hearts amen that God is still alive and he's with us today in the Masterpiece message it says the life that was in the husk or in the stock in the tassel and the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stock went went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptis ISM of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself praise God Amen but what denominated dies like life in Luther went to make wesy went and from wesy it went to Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the Original Seed let's say I'm Original Seed Amen on to Pentecost comes out of the wesy until that time the reason that Pentecost came out of Wesley because it was no denomination Pentecost wasn't Pentecost went to denominate and what did it do it turned to the hus it looked like the real thing amen but I say that this message will not denominate there may be no nominations within the message and people think that if you're not part of our group you're not in the Rapture I say that that's all what brother Brown taught us amen there got to come I believe a time in the lives of the people when we can say like the early church these people are not saying what Paul said so therefore they're false amen we've got to come back to the original word again Amen in the fullness of the word of God Amen I believe that God has given us Eagle sight in this hour amen he's given us what we have need of in this hour Amen in order to be able to detect and to determine what is real seed and what is not real seed amen just as the four beasts of Revelation 4:7 which we know there was the Beast that was the lion the ox and the spirit of a man but in our day we have an eagle anointing I looked it up and I studied it a bit on an eagle and and I of course we know he's an not an Earthbound creature he's a creature that's in the heavens but what made me so drawn toward it is that an eagle can see its prey up to four miles away and with pinpoint accuracy brother Matthew he can set his Target on it and come in in a Thicket and grab a mouse or grab something in the thicket I thought that's incredible but not only that his vision is 340° he can see just about to the back of his head humans we can only see forward he can see all the way back and all the way forward all the time and when he wants to soar higher he just Soares on higher and how much it depicts the spirit that's been given to the church in this last day that we're living in today amen not just an Earthbound creature but a Heavenly bow creature amen creatures that are so into the heavenlies hallelujah we're not Earthbound we can depict from a far away off that's why brother Brown could preach things that are to be amen he could look way off and say church this where you are but there's things that are to be there's a land beyond the river there's a place that we're going to amen and he gave us that eag Vision in this hour blessed be the name of the Lord somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord Give the Lord a hand clap at all do you love him with all your heart amen we're so grateful to live in this hour amen we don't have to go by the way of the grave but we which are alive and remain could be changed in the moment of the twinkling of an eye amen this last message that came forth is a flying eagle amen it's not for denominational chickens no it's for those that are born again of a with a Heavenly nature within their within their bosoms they've taken the intelligence of the word and they put it into their heart amen that eagle can see they say with such precise Clarity and precision of I've watched them in our on where where our Lakeland is on a boat this this last year sister Mar and myself were out and we're just kind of idling around on the shoreline and just relaxing for a few moments and she looked and she said look this where our old Campground used to be and there was two Eagles that were sitting in the trees and we watched them probably for half an hour watch him move their big wings and after a while he took a big jump and and he moved I said yeah that's just how our God is amen he's a great God he's not Earthbound at all amen his his boundary there's there's no limit to it he's a he's a bird of the sky amen I've watched him come down into the water and you wonder what he's coming for he's got his talents straight out next thing you know he comes into the water and he pulls out a fish I say my that's such ke- sightedness amen and that's how God depict the Gen time church that we're in today that we're enjoying with all our heart amen not Earthbound creatures amen I thank God for each one of those other generations and ages but I thank the Living God that we have the privilege and the honor to live in this age that we're living in today amen somebody say praise the Lord as it was in the and those so shall it be in the coming of the son of man they were eating and drinking bearing giving a marriage and as it was in the days of lot so will so it be in this hour that the son of man will be revealed on Earth Earth not Son of God no more son of man come back as a prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying not the line not the ox and the sacrifice age every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the line raised up the religious power it went to meet the Roman power and when and then when come come the sacrifice hour the ox went because he's a beast of the Lord sacrifice beast and come the reformer down through the church Ages come the face of a man and reformers had since Luther Wesley Calvin all down down the Pentecostal age but in the last message let's say last message that went forth they came a flying eagle in it's Eagle time it's revealed time the word of God made manifest the word of God proved oh children walk into this baptism of the Holy Ghost come in and believe it with all your heart God will fill you amen what's his desire is to fill you with all of his goodness Hallelujah sat's trying to strip me of my voice but I'm going to say boo devil amen we're just going to keep on preaching anyhow if it squeaks a bit forgive me for it amen I love the Lord with all my heart I want to share what's on my on my heart this morning hour amen we're not chickens we're not Earthbound we're creatures of a Heavenly heavenbound creature amen we're Eagles amen I say it's Eagle time it's bride time it's word time it's wheat time we are the Church of the Living God Amen what is the intelligence doing it's bringing us back to our Eden God had a three-fold purpose and his three-fold purpose and we know it's Perfection seven completion but his threefold purpose was to express himself completely God in Christ what was the second purpose was to to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the till he could have remance to express himself through them all and thirdly to restore the kingdom Amen to its rightful position that fell by sin by the first adom back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talk with them and fellowship with them what's he doing he's bringing us back to the order that was there before sin came into the question amen say Satan's had his s 6,000 years to make his Eden but God has gone to prepare a place for each and every one of us amen what is that place it's a new body amen I'm looking forward to it I know my young my grandchildren 22 years old 20 years old I said you probably feel pretty good right now put a few more years on you start aching and shaking a bit amen that's just the way it works amen you start looking for your new body quicker amen I say Lord bring it on I'm not going to be one bit disappointed when I step into that new body I don't think anybody is going to be disappointed amen those that are left behind will be disappointed but those that are in the Rapture they're going to be in a glorious time amen they're going to be shouting and praising God and thanking him for all that he's done amen he'll come by and wipe the tears off your eyes hallelujah it's almighty God he's got a plan the devil won't stop it oh he tries but he can't he's already defeated Christ defeated him on Calvary stripped every power off of him amen he just goes that like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour amen he doesn't even have his own keys to his own house amen he's got no teeth left he'll gum you to death if you allow him to but he got no bite he got a lot of bark but no bite right amen it's just the devil trying to make his last effort to try to stop the church from going in a Rapture but I want to say this morning it won't happen we are not Earthbound creatures we're heavenbound creatures we are the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah does he have preeminence in your life does he have first place in your heart that's his desire his preeminence in our lives amen hallelujah Christ is revealed in his own word brother brandom says the next is the intelligence he said there's no isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye he said the next is the intelligent which is Christ itself who controls the whole body no moving beyond that see everything has to move feet move muscle in the legs everything moves your ear move nose lips so forth but your eyes there's nothing that moves Beyond on that Amen to see Supreme intelligence when I want to walk when you want to walk I don't have to tell my feet walk happy for that it just automatically walks whatever you do it's just automatic amen thank the Lord for that amen what is controlling that is the intelligence what's controlling the body is the intelligence of almighty God he's bringing us to Rapture to our home Beyond this home amen we've had a third pole message that's called come to sweep out and to pick up the brde those that are re elected Amen Brother Brad said the third poll was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word amen I know back home there's so many people that debate is the Seven Seals open or are they closed well he says they're open right amen it was the ending of Silence Amen to reveal what was the hidden secrets from before the foundation of the world Amen and he's revealed it to the Church of the Living God Amen and what is it doing it's bringing us into subjection to his word Amen brother Braham said the Holy Spirit today hunting out on his hearts that will believe that message everything in the Bible that was promised is to the believer and when you accept it in its fullness that's Say fullness this morning fullness let's say it again fullness and God knows that you'll do it look at that assurance that he had not only is he is he promis it to the Believers then that you will accept it but he knows that you'll do it amen that's speaking about us he give you the abstract of that and then every promise that's made is in your possession and the Holy Spirit is there to Quicken that to you oh my what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see the great Holy Spirit here do that power think of it when the Holy Ghost itself here to Bear record of this hour Jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever amen in the pergam church age brother Brown says when the word comes into you if the holy spirit is there it's alive as soon as it comes in every promise is true amen let's say every promise is true amen when you give your heart to the Lord Lord you got a good big checkbook I say use it as much as you can use it every promise is given to the Church of the Living God Amen don't think it's not for you amen everything is for you amen if you need healing healing is for you you need Deliverance Deliverance for you if you need encouragement encouragement for you if you need joy joy is for you whatever you have need of is for you church amen you don't have to say I've only been in the message for for a week the day you gave your heart to the Lord it was for you from that day forward Hallelujah somebody say praise the Lord this morning blessed be the name of the Lord I love that as soon as you need it brother Brown says because you are deity speaking if you say to this mountain it will be moved amen you might think well I've said it a long time Mountain's still not moving you may not be able to see all the mountain move but the sound is moving amen you believe with all your heart I believe with my heart when we pray we expect God to move amen the world may doubt it but you've got an assurance in your heart Amen brother Bram says now in the last days with every seed sown and everything in order the world in its order the time shaped up the church in its order the seed of the evening lights the signs of light he said as it was in the days of Sodom and we can see that all through Life Church brother Bram comes to the end he said a predestinated church knowing where they're standing I believe we know where we're standing in this hour amen I I know I'm preaching to the choir this morning amen we're well-taught people in the message amen I'm only reminding you of what's already been said in the word of God to give you courage to keep pressing forward amen I may never come back here again maybe there'll be a Rapture in the next couple of months or next year maybe whatever will be but there's one thing with Assurance I expect to meet every one of you at that day amen and we'll know one another by first name basis I might forget your name here but on the other side we we forget one another's name amen why because you've allowed Christ to have prevence in your heart and in your life it's time for the catching away Amen brother Brown said 60 in 6465 he said I can't see nothing except for the coming of the Lord if he said it back there how much closer are we are today we see our politics has failed our monetary system is failing amen back home 10 bucks used to be 10 bucks 10 bucks now is is nothing anymore amen you you can't go out to eat unless it's 20 30 bucks a person or 40 bucks amen it just everything's getting out of control amen the system is going bankrupt amen our governments are finished the church is finished but the Bride of Jesus Christ has allowed Christ in her life in preeminence and she is following the word and that word is going to bring her right back to Eden again we we be with our Lord and savior for eternity you're saying what are you saying brother Kelly I'm saying we are a predestinated church amen Christ has become preeminent in our lives amen it's not because we allowed because we were looking for it's because he promised it to the church be happy be joyful amen thank God that God chose you to be part of this great number amen it's going home time Amen brother bradam Christ a Meer as the head was took from the grave so must the body follow it him back to Eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the bride body of the bridegroom must follow the bride because that's a head and the head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it's husband and wife again and as long as you're pregnated with the same word which is his body you took his body becom in him when you took the word not the Creed but a word and he said that would make a great text therefore the body cannot recognize he said don't fail fail this a body cannot recognize any other headship but the word amen the head is connected with the body and the head is the word and it's the same word one headship let's say one headship one amen it's not a headship in Jeffersonville it's not a headship in Rome amen it's one headship and that headship is a Heavenly headship amen he's the one in control of the entire body praise God for the grace of God there's one headship and that's Christ and the body only recognizes recognizes one thing and that's the word amen we've got the devil answers and not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me it's not my it's his power amen it's his word he promised it here he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer Christ is risen has paid the price of our Redemption what God in Christ manifested he gave that flesh and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that God in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day that we as we as he did in that day he said glor he said woof glory and and I say Glory as well amen the word the bride is becoming the word that's why brother bradam saids she becomes him amen she is him we are a direct reflection of the word amen I can just see how he must look over the banister would be and say that's my bride in Elton Virginia amen she's pure she's unspotted from the world Amen her garments have not been spoiled by lady oia but she's washed white with the glory of almighty God Amen she is a part of my bride of the Lord Jesus Christ she stands in full array the devil has no chance with her the devil has nothing that's going to hinder her she's moving on in the glory of almighty God hallelujah she's part of me she's my brother died and she's in full array she's unspotted by the world that's why Revelation chapter 19 and I and I close with that that's why there's going to be such shouting and such praising that you've never heard before Christ has preeminence in the bride amen one day we close our Bibles for the last time one day we preach our last sermon amen one day we give our last encouragement to the people amen then we go to meet father and Father's House amen but until that time stand behind your ministers that are here amen you've got wonderful ministers powerful
