[37:58] i would like for us to read
[38:00] psalms 91
[38:02] and that chapter all the way through
[38:05] and this is a covenant and i want you to
[38:08] read it as a covenant for you
[38:10] in this hour
[38:12] uh people that will be watching that are
[38:14] that are uh
[38:16] that are associated with us
[38:18] around the world it's not just us as a
[38:20] little body of believers but there's
[38:23] people that are in bomb shelters
[38:25] in ukraine
[38:27] uh we got a video of some of them
[38:29] singing and
[38:31] and uh what an event that was and then
[38:33] not only that uh just this morning
[38:35] brother barry coffey made us aware that
[38:37] that they're they're calling backwards
[38:39] and forwards praying with one another
[38:41] there
[38:42] they believe this message as much as we
[38:44] do
[38:46] they're looking for rapture as much as
[38:48] we are
[38:49] there are not just believers in the
[38:51] ukraine but there's there's incredible
[38:54] churches in russia as well
[38:56] and they're believers of this message
[38:58] with everything
[39:00] men
[39:02] that have literally
[39:03] even in the ukraine that that literally
[39:08] risked their lives to carry this message
[39:10] that you believe
[39:12] they risked their lives to carry the
[39:14] message to the believers there when it
[39:17] was called the iron curtain
[39:19] and so now they are they are established
[39:22] uh phenomenal churches there
[39:25] and um
[39:26] though they be in bomb shelters
[39:29] god's still with them
[39:32] and whether you know it or not you're
[39:34] just as much as in peril
[39:37] as they are
[39:39] amen so don't get relaxed because you're
[39:42] on the other side
[39:44] you remember many years ago the immoral
[39:47] living used to be in san francisco
[39:51] and it didn't bother you too bad until
[39:53] it got in your mcdonald's
[39:58] and then it invaded your schools
[40:01] and sodom is
[40:03] living almost next door to you
[40:06] but as long as it was 2 000 miles away
[40:08] it didn't seem to be so bad
[40:11] but sin is infiltrated you remember
[40:13] brother branham was saying i'm sorry to
[40:15] have you stand but i want to kind of set
[40:17] the tone brother branham was sitting
[40:19] with presidents
[40:21] that's that's who brother branham was he
[40:23] was that kind of a man he was sitting
[40:25] with presidents and richard nixon was
[40:27] there and
[40:28] and uh
[40:30] uh
[40:30] the the president was there that was
[40:33] talking about russia talking about the
[40:35] things and and they were they were
[40:37] worried about communism and fascism and
[40:40] is and those isms that were rising up
[40:43] and brother branham said uh
[40:45] it's not that that's out there is going
[40:47] to destroy america it's the worm on the
[40:50] inside
[40:52] sin is going to destroy america
[40:56] sin took america without a shot
[41:00] and that's where we're at
[41:02] that's where we're at
[41:04] amen now i would like for i will read
[41:06] the first verse you read the second and
[41:08] we'll just
[41:09] backwards and forwards like that for
[41:11] these scriptures
[41:12] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[41:15] the most high shall abide under the
[41:17] shadow of the almighty
[41:28] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[41:30] snare of the fowler and for the noise of
[41:32] pestilence
[41:43] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[41:45] by night nor the
[41:47] arrow that flieth by day
[41:57] a thousand shall fall at thy side and
[42:00] ten thousand at thy right hand but it
[42:02] shall not come nigh thee
[42:11] because he thou hath made the lord which
[42:14] is my refuge even the most high thy
[42:17] habitation
[42:25] for he shall give his angels charge over
[42:28] thee to keep thee in all thy ways
[42:37] thou shalt tread upon the lion and the
[42:39] outer the young lion and the dragon
[42:41] shalt thou trample under feet
[42:53] he shall call upon me
[42:55] and i shall answer him i will be with
[42:59] him in trouble
[43:00] and i will deliver him and honor him
[43:08] i'd like to go to matthew chapter 25
[43:12] and i want to do the very same thing
[43:15] down through verse 13.
[43:23] amen
[43:24] matthew 25 and verse 1.
[43:27] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[43:29] likened unto ten virgins which took
[43:32] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[43:34] bridegroom
[43:40] and they that were foolish took their
[43:42] lamps
[43:43] and took no oil with them
[43:50] and while the bridegroom tarried they
[43:52] all slumbered and slept
[44:01] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[44:04] their lamps
[44:11] but the wise answered saying not so lest
[44:14] there be not enough for us and you
[44:17] but go you rather to them that sell and
[44:20] buy for yourselves
[44:31] after came
[44:32] also the other virgin saying lord lord
[44:36] open to us
[44:43] watch therefore
[44:45] for you know
[44:46] neither the day nor the hour when the
[44:50] son of man
[44:51] cometh
[44:52] you may be seated
[44:56] amen god bless you
[45:03] laodicean church age book
[45:08] the fir the third vision
[45:10] was in the realm of the world of
[45:12] politics
[45:14] for it showed me that there would would
[45:17] be three great isms
[45:20] fascism
[45:22] nazism
[45:24] and communism
[45:27] fascism is is is a form of of socialism
[45:32] and that actually rules america today
[45:36] but that
[45:37] the first two
[45:39] would be swallowed up in the third
[45:44] the voice admonished
[45:47] admonished
[45:49] watch russia
[45:52] watch russia
[45:54] i want you to remember when brother
[45:55] branham was saying these words
[45:58] at the time that he was saying him
[46:00] it was a soviet union
[46:04] but god knows exactly the hour
[46:08] and the timing
[46:09] and the situation
[46:12] and so when the prophet is standing
[46:14] there and he's screaming watch russia
[46:17] watch russia
[46:18] he was more than just another preacher
[46:20] on the earth
[46:24] now
[46:25] we realize that god is in the same the
[46:28] same book god is governing in the
[46:31] affairs of men right now
[46:34] he is both creator and sustainer
[46:37] colossians chapter 1 and verse 16 he
[46:40] says
[46:40] for by him were all things created that
[46:43] are in heaven
[46:45] and that are in earth
[46:46] visible and invisible whether they be
[46:50] thrones or dominions or principalities
[46:53] or powers
[46:55] all things were created by him and for
[46:58] him and he is before all things and by
[47:01] him
[47:03] all things
[47:04] consist
[47:07] a brother sent me this this week and he
[47:09] says
[47:10] the devil is a prime dummy
[47:14] amen
[47:16] he is of all
[47:17] all beings
[47:19] ought to know that god's word cannot
[47:22] fail
[47:24] then he chose to spend his existence
[47:28] picking a fight with an undefeatable god
[47:34] and at the end of it all he will not
[47:36] even get a participation
[47:38] ribbon
[47:44] that's good enough to go ahead and
[47:45] applaud you can do that
[47:55] we're standing in the very brink and
[47:57] we've been speaking over the last few
[47:58] weeks and the first of all we spoke on
[48:01] entrance
[48:02] and it was a night to where it was a
[48:04] sunday right after following uh brother
[48:07] andrew glover that has broken entrance
[48:09] the night before
[48:11] and i was i was speaking to you that in
[48:13] revelations chapter 3 that jesus stands
[48:16] at the door knocking on this age and
[48:20] this would be the age of the church that
[48:22] would put him outside the door
[48:24] they would put him out and jesus is
[48:26] wanting to get back in
[48:28] and he brother branham explains to us
[48:30] that it's like a of the great artist
[48:32] that that was there and he he made a
[48:35] picture of jesus standing outside of the
[48:37] door knocking
[48:39] and the critic says but there's no
[48:40] handle on the on the you missed the the
[48:44] you missed a part of the door there's no
[48:46] handle there that jesus can go through
[48:48] and he said you missed the theme of the
[48:50] picture
[48:51] [Music]
[48:53] jesus
[48:54] is waiting on you to open the door
[48:58] and we realize that we're either veiling
[49:01] god or we're veiling the devil
[49:04] even the either the king of our heart is
[49:07] jesus christ
[49:08] or the the king of our heart is the
[49:11] enemy satan himself
[49:19] are you with me
[49:20] and so we realized that
[49:22] that
[49:24] we as individuals
[49:26] jesus will talk about it like this and
[49:29] he would say that a man has a strong
[49:31] house and
[49:33] and he said accept a stronger come
[49:36] and come into the house
[49:38] then the stronger comes in and binds it
[49:41] and then and then he sweeps and he
[49:43] garnishes and i'm just paraphrasing here
[49:46] but an unless you get god on the inside
[49:49] of your heart
[49:51] the devil will come back in
[49:54] and people can take on spirits and they
[49:57] take on church spirits they take on
[49:59] personalities of people they take on
[50:01] personalities of hollywood
[50:04] and brother branham warned us he said
[50:05] don't come to take the church spirit or
[50:08] even the pasture spirit we come to get
[50:10] the spirit of christ
[50:13] now how important is this
[50:16] when we talked about being on the
[50:18] entrance and there were some key things
[50:20] that i said right there there's a few
[50:22] things there's a few places in the
[50:24] scriptures were that people seemed
[50:27] absolutely innocent for an incredible
[50:30] length of time in their life
[50:33] and then satan entered them
[50:37] you remember these statements satan
[50:39] entered them and they became a complete
[50:42] different individual
[50:45] you remember you remember i mentioned to
[50:47] you that hitler
[50:49] he was a man that was on the rise of
[50:51] politics brother and in 1933 picks him
[50:54] out as the man that will lead the world
[50:57] to war
[50:58] now remember germany was a christian
[51:01] nation at that time
[51:04] she had become a christian nation she'd
[51:06] let a world a war in the world
[51:09] and and and they came to back down and
[51:12] everything was settled but there's a
[51:14] spirit that was rising
[51:17] and the that third reich was rising
[51:19] prophet of god was standing here in
[51:22] america and seeing that vision of that
[51:24] man rising
[51:27] and it may seem politically correct for
[51:29] a long time but there came a time where
[51:32] he took on another spirit
[51:35] and he would lead the world to a war
[51:38] a christian nation
[51:41] would get under the spirit of that
[51:44] it doesn't take but one percent
[51:47] of a nation to lead a world to a war
[51:52] we remember there was a man that was in
[51:54] the scriptures
[51:56] and
[51:57] he was a disciple
[51:59] no one would have thought
[52:02] that he would be filled with the devil
[52:05] as a matter of fact even john the very
[52:08] beloved
[52:09] when he is sitting at the lord's supper
[52:13] and jesus begins to talk about a man's
[52:15] that's going to betray him
[52:19] and he says even john would say he said
[52:22] ah
[52:23] yes it does
[52:24] now let's just think about this just for
[52:26] a minute we're talking about final
[52:28] runners for the last weekend and this
[52:30] weekend we're at the juncture
[52:34] of everything of the prophecy that has
[52:36] taken place
[52:38] but go back 2 000 years ago when
[52:40] redemption
[52:42] was right on the brink of being paid for
[52:46] and the devil was sitting right in the
[52:48] church
[52:51] the very man that would sell out the
[52:53] greatest preacher
[52:55] the very lamb of god
[52:57] why who would ever turn against a man
[53:00] that could take a withered hand
[53:02] and make it whole
[53:04] or raise a friend from the dead or go to
[53:07] the widow of nan's funeral and raise him
[53:10] back to life or go to legion and restore
[53:13] that man to his right mind and to have a
[53:16] family
[53:19] and to preach peace and safety and
[53:22] preach real truth
[53:24] and binded the denominational spirits of
[53:27] that day and telling them that they were
[53:29] of their father the devil
[53:31] who could ever turn against this jesus
[53:37] but the scripture says that
[53:39] satan entered
[53:42] into judas's heart
[53:48] but i want you to just notice humanity
[53:52] they can't live
[53:56] with the blood of jesus christ on their
[53:58] hands
[54:00] we've come to an age that
[54:03] is an insane age
[54:05] they rejected the message and tried to
[54:07] wash the blood of jesus off of their
[54:10] hands
[54:17] but you can't wash it off your hands
[54:22] pilate tried to wash it
[54:25] they tried to wash
[54:27] it off of his hands
[54:30] i find no fault in this man
[54:35] but suicide would be in his life
[54:37] because he couldn't live with the guilt
[54:43] judas couldn't live with himself
[54:46] he wanted to destroy his own body
[54:50] he couldn't go to pentecost
[54:54] he had preached in his name
[54:57] he had healed in his name
[55:00] but it also sold jesus
[55:06] for pieces of silver
[55:09] that you couldn't even go buy property
[55:11] with
[55:19] i want to just share something with you
[55:20] i was sitting on an airplane many years
[55:22] ago
[55:24] i i didn't have the bible that i have
[55:26] with me today or
[55:29] but i was carrying a bible with me and i
[55:31] was i was on my way to canada
[55:35] and i was actually headed to
[55:37] calgary
[55:40] and i had my bible with me and it was a
[55:42] i think if i can remember correct it was
[55:45] from
[55:47] from washington at that point to
[55:49] to calgary
[55:52] and uh i had been i've been studying for
[55:55] the convention that i was getting ready
[55:56] to speak
[55:58] and it was a man that was sitting next
[56:00] to me
[56:04] and you could just tell he was a kind of
[56:06] a very humble man
[56:08] and he was very he was
[56:10] he was just interested
[56:14] he looks over at me and he says
[56:18] they tell me
[56:20] that russia is in that book
[56:24] and i said it is
[56:25] it is in this book
[56:27] this book's written 2 000 years ago but
[56:30] russia's in this book
[56:35] he said as america in this book and i
[56:36] said
[56:37] yes sir
[56:39] so i took the time to show him in
[56:41] revelation chapter 13.
[56:44] that america was in the book
[56:46] but i want to remind you
[56:48] as an end time player we're not that
[56:51] amazing
[56:53] we're we're not an end time player
[56:56] we're finding ourselves in the news
[56:58] almost helpless
[57:03] i'll tell you why let me just let me
[57:05] just background it just for a moment
[57:09] hollywood and all of the perversion
[57:13] and the turning down of the message
[57:15] our moral conduct is in the pit
[57:20] we are reaping the seeds that we have
[57:23] sowed
[57:29] and
[57:30] and here we are where we are
[57:33] and this man began to talk to me a bit
[57:37] and he wanted to know about the plan of
[57:39] redemption
[57:41] and his wife got extremely upset with
[57:43] him
[57:44] have nothing to do with that man have
[57:46] nothing and he kept hearing her
[57:48] have nothing to do with him
[57:50] and i just was showing him in the
[57:52] scriptures because i knew not to bring
[57:55] brother branham into the picture because
[57:56] he wanted to see it in god's word
[57:59] and so i just took him through the
[58:01] scriptures just displacing him were
[58:04] things and where we are
[58:06] that man i i i turned to him and now
[58:08] it's my turn to ask a question and i
[58:11] said if you don't mind me asking i'd
[58:12] like to ask you
[58:15] why are you wanting to know these
[58:17] answers
[58:20] and he said i am mr putin's translator
[58:28] this was in the beginnings of
[58:30] of his run
[58:34] as a leader of russia
[58:37] and it seemed like then
[58:41] it seemed like then i was in a moment to
[58:43] where that i'd been placed in a certain
[58:46] spot
[58:47] i'm going to preach to you today and so
[58:49] i i'm just gonna give you my heart
[58:53] and his wife is telling him have nothing
[58:55] to do with him have nothing to do with
[58:56] him
[58:58] and i said where do you see putin and
[59:01] america at he said putin
[59:04] is
[59:05] is america's greatest enemy
[59:13] now let me just say this to you
[59:17] this morning's
[59:19] this morning's headlines
[59:22] is as just as real as a 42-inch caribou
[59:27] this morning's headlines is just as real
[59:31] as a silver tip grizzly bear
[59:34] are three squirrels coming into
[59:36] existence or congressman upshaw coming
[59:39] out of a wheelchair
[59:44] or those brothers asking brother branham
[59:46] to go down to kentucky where would you
[59:49] go to find all he said it's there
[59:52] but he said they messed around and let
[59:54] somebody else get in front of them and
[59:56] they got just the edges of
[59:58] it are you with me now
[1:00:03] this morning's headlines is
[1:00:07] putin raises the alert level
[1:00:10] to nuclear status
[1:00:13] to special combat
[1:00:15] readiness
[1:00:25] if i could have all the prophets of the
[1:00:26] ages to come and give testimony they
[1:00:28] would say we've been waiting on this
[1:00:34] we've been waiting on this
[1:00:36] if we could have brother homer to come
[1:00:38] and
[1:00:39] greet this audience
[1:00:41] and he said this is what we have been
[1:00:43] waiting on
[1:00:46] this is where we're at
[1:00:48] you see god raises a man up to fulfill
[1:00:50] the word of god
[1:00:52] and gives him nuclear capability not
[1:00:55] just for america
[1:00:56] but remember russia is ordained in the
[1:00:59] scriptures and brother bran would use
[1:01:01] the term that russia is going to drop a
[1:01:04] nuclear bomb down to rome's
[1:01:06] smokestack remember that
[1:01:10] because god's going to destroy rome
[1:01:13] he's going to destroy that system
[1:01:17] i've got good catholic friends
[1:01:19] and they're good friends
[1:01:21] but it's a system that is corrupt
[1:01:24] it's like the denominational systems
[1:01:27] it's the systems that are corrupt
[1:01:31] but god sent this nation and the world a
[1:01:35] prophet
[1:01:37] and the corrupt men stood there and
[1:01:40] blinded the eyes of the people and told
[1:01:42] them don't look that way
[1:01:45] and vision after vision and prophecy
[1:01:48] after prophecy has come to fulfillment
[1:01:52] and just like in the days of noah they
[1:01:55] tried to explain the supernatural away
[1:01:57] in the days of moses they stood there
[1:02:00] when there was flies and frogs and
[1:02:03] and fleas and and the water turned to
[1:02:06] blood they tried to explain it away
[1:02:09] so the nominal men stood in this age
[1:02:14] and tried to explain it away
[1:02:25] i'd like for you over the next week or
[1:02:27] two
[1:02:32] to go back and listen to world falling
[1:02:34] apart
[1:02:37] we had a prophet stand
[1:02:40] and tell us
[1:02:41] and read to us
[1:02:43] tomorrow's newspaper
[1:02:49] now
[1:02:50] i'm going to say some pretty difficult
[1:02:52] things here for you to swallow but you
[1:02:54] just hang on
[1:02:57] we're going to make a public
[1:03:00] a public notice
[1:03:02] i as one of the representatives of this
[1:03:05] message
[1:03:07] since i was a little boy
[1:03:09] i stood at the
[1:03:11] the
[1:03:12] casket of the prophet of the lord
[1:03:15] four years old
[1:03:17] taught all my life that god sent a
[1:03:19] prophet but it never became real to me
[1:03:22] until i met the god
[1:03:26] not the man but i met the god of this
[1:03:28] message jesus christ
[1:03:31] that wanted to live inside of me
[1:03:35] now that same jesus wants to live inside
[1:03:37] of you
[1:03:39] so i want to make an announcement today
[1:03:42] that there's a
[1:03:43] there's kingdoms struggling all over the
[1:03:45] world and it's been prophesied and these
[1:03:47] things are going to happen
[1:03:50] russia's going to fulfill her plan and
[1:03:53] america is going to fulfill her plan and
[1:03:55] rome is going to fulfill his plan he's
[1:03:58] already declared himself as the leader
[1:04:00] of the world
[1:04:01] and one of the
[1:04:03] one of the top things that he did in
[1:04:04] this the last few months was climate
[1:04:07] change
[1:04:08] it's a lie
[1:04:11] god's going to burn the whole thing off
[1:04:13] it's going to be a climate change
[1:04:17] you know some of theirs is right it's
[1:04:18] going to be a climate change
[1:04:24] but these leaders rise no man can rise
[1:04:26] without god allowing it to happen
[1:04:30] we we wonder where these kind of
[1:04:32] individuals come from and then all of a
[1:04:34] sudden i i've read it and i've read i've
[1:04:37] read dozens of articles on it over the
[1:04:39] last couple of days that how that even
[1:04:42] putin has had a nature change
[1:04:45] he's had a behavioral
[1:04:47] issue over the last couple of months
[1:04:50] things have turned well i can tell you
[1:04:54] i can tell you god's been speaking to
[1:04:56] the bride there's an entrance it's
[1:04:58] happening
[1:05:00] and there's a there's a spirit that has
[1:05:02] overtaken him
[1:05:04] that to fulfill the plan of the hour
[1:05:07] you can't do that on your home human
[1:05:09] self
[1:05:10] but a spirit of hell an anointed from
[1:05:13] hell to destruct and do the destruction
[1:05:16] that he's going to do
[1:05:18] and i'm saying that going to do
[1:05:21] [Applause]
[1:05:24] but i wanted them all to know just
[1:05:27] brother george quinn told me just this
[1:05:28] week that russia flew
[1:05:31] five different nuclear
[1:05:33] aircraft over top of the golden heights
[1:05:36] in israel so there's a lot of the fronts
[1:05:39] that are going on our america media

[1:06:53] readiness
[1:06:55] [Applause]
[1:07:10] whether you realize or not as much as
[1:07:12] these men are being infiltrated with the
[1:07:14] powers of darkness
[1:07:16] the bride of jesus christ has already
[1:07:18] been infiltrated and filled with the
[1:07:21] power of the holy ghost
[1:07:23] this holy ghost will lead us and guide
[1:07:26] us and direct us it'll be with us it'll

[1:07:40] protector
[1:07:46] you say well brother ron i don't know
[1:07:48] about all of that how can he protect us
[1:07:49] in these situations we look at our past
[1:07:52] he watched over us in world war one he
[1:07:56] watched over us in world war ii he
[1:07:58] watched over us in skirmishes he watched
[1:08:01] over this part of the world in their
[1:08:02] civil war
[1:08:08] our farms were destroyed our plan our
[1:08:11] our our beautiful places were become mud
[1:08:14] huts because of the wars that were
[1:08:16] taking place
[1:08:17] and god had some of our grandfathers
[1:08:21] fighting on the battle
[1:08:24] and whether they were believers or not
[1:08:27] for that day
[1:08:28] angels were standing watching over their
[1:08:32] natural sea
[1:08:34] knowing you were on the way
[1:08:37] so don't never tell me that god's never
[1:08:40] done nothing for you
[1:08:51] i had three grandfathers fight on the
[1:08:53] same
[1:08:54] battlefield in the civil war
[1:08:57] one was a colonel
[1:09:00] one was a foot soldier
[1:09:02] and one was a sergeant
[1:09:05] standing all in a five-acre field
[1:09:08] two
[1:09:09] two
[1:09:10] armies coming together
[1:09:13] think of the odds of hundreds of men
[1:09:15] dying
[1:09:16] and three of my grandfathers were
[1:09:18] standing there they were protected
[1:09:23] because god had already pre-planned i'm
[1:09:27] going to preach
[1:09:28] god had already plea planned me and my
[1:09:31] family to come on the earth that we
[1:09:34] would be the final runners of this day
[1:09:50] our church is now as the message brother
[1:09:52] tim pruitt is celebrating his 50th
[1:09:55] anniversary this weekend
[1:09:57] we will celebrate ours in a couple of
[1:09:59] years
[1:10:00] brother bischel's church will be
[1:10:03] celebrating 50 years
[1:10:05] in a couple of months
[1:10:09] 50 means jubilee
[1:10:12] we've heard the message
[1:10:14] we followed the message we fed the word
[1:10:19] and we have arrived
[1:10:31] if you'll remember
[1:10:33] abraham was in the brink of something
[1:10:37] and had a meeting with god himself
[1:10:40] that god himself sat before him in this
[1:10:43] tent's door
[1:10:44] they ate meat they drank milk
[1:10:47] they had a conversation
[1:10:50] the eternal god was looking at abraham
[1:10:54] as the beginning
[1:10:57] the foundation father
[1:11:00] of the message
[1:11:05] and abraham couldn't see
[1:11:08] he wanted to have a son
[1:11:11] and he had one by ishmael
[1:11:13] but the promise was by sarah
[1:11:17] and sarah couldn't see herself in the
[1:11:19] promise because remember she's now well
[1:11:21] past age
[1:11:23] to produce a child
[1:11:25] and now it's impossible for abraham to
[1:11:28] produce a child
[1:11:30] but now he's sitting
[1:11:32] with the one that made the promise
[1:11:36] follow me just a moment
[1:11:38] he's it with the one that's written the
[1:11:40] lamb's book
[1:11:42] and it's got all the names in it
[1:11:46] and remember in romans it it when paul
[1:11:49] begins to mark out that abraham
[1:11:52] staggered not at the promises of god
[1:11:55] but in the old testament abraham laughs
[1:11:58] and rolls on the ground
[1:12:00] but through the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:02] god doesn't see your failures
[1:12:08] and sometimes it's very difficult for us
[1:12:10] to see the big picture
[1:12:12] when we're so concerned with the little
[1:12:14] picture
[1:12:16] they had had an argument just before
[1:12:18] melchizedek comes brother bennett picks
[1:12:21] it up is there anything too hard for the
[1:12:23] lord he goes right back and describes
[1:12:26] how satan tries to block the visitation
[1:12:29] of that day
[1:12:30] how much more does satan try to block
[1:12:32] the visitation of our services
[1:12:37] and maybe it's not an argument but
[1:12:39] there's a situation that's in your home
[1:12:41] and a situation in your relationship and
[1:12:43] there's just a little bit
[1:12:47] a little bite that goes on it's only the
[1:12:50] devil
[1:12:52] because he knows he can't destroy the
[1:12:54] word
[1:12:55] and he can't destroy the seed
[1:12:58] so he's working on your human flesh the
[1:13:00] only spot that he can
[1:13:09] why did sarah laugh
[1:13:11] i didn't laugh
[1:13:16] i ain't laughing and god would have
[1:13:18] killed her except for she was in the
[1:13:20] book
[1:13:22] there's a lot of things that we've done
[1:13:23] in our life
[1:13:24] where we doubted
[1:13:28] because really that's what she did she
[1:13:29] doubted
[1:13:30] she literally couldn't see herself
[1:13:33] and there's sometimes you come to church
[1:13:34] and go well you know this is a nice
[1:13:36] service
[1:13:38] go home get in a different change of
[1:13:40] clothes
[1:13:43] different style of music
[1:13:46] you go right back into your routine
[1:13:49] but when will you realize
[1:13:52] that i should have been ready
[1:13:56] they kept telling me to get ready
[1:14:01] they kept telling me to get ready but my
[1:14:03] human nature like sitting in sarah's
[1:14:05] tent i just couldn't believe i was part
[1:14:07] of the promise i'm just getting older
[1:14:09] these guys have been preaching this for
[1:14:11] generations and and decades and you know
[1:14:14] we're just going on we had to wait till
[1:14:16] putin grew up
[1:14:30] jesus was standing here with his inner
[1:14:32] circle of believers
[1:14:35] and he says
[1:14:37] be there for ready for in such an hour
[1:14:39] as you think not
[1:14:41] the son of man cometh
[1:14:43] then he begins to describe something
[1:14:45] that was as a little boy
[1:14:48] was difficult for me to get
[1:14:50] two in the field
[1:14:52] want to be taken
[1:14:53] want to be left
[1:14:56] two at the mill want to be taken
[1:14:59] and want to be left
[1:15:02] and he begins to describe these things
[1:15:05] and he's telling us to be ready
[1:15:08] when brother branham approaches that
[1:15:10] scripture and he approaches that thought
[1:15:14] he begins to talk about how that martin
[1:15:17] went into the tomb
[1:15:19] and luther went into the tomb
[1:15:22] and if god would have the angel would
[1:15:24] have told paul it's going to be 2 000
[1:15:26] years
[1:15:28] he said if he had told them it's going
[1:15:30] to be all that time later there would
[1:15:33] have been no readiness
[1:15:36] and he said every one of them went into
[1:15:38] the ground and they died in the faith
[1:15:43] they didn't die in sin they died in the
[1:15:45] faith looking for the coming of the lord
[1:15:49] it wasn't that they wasn't christian so
[1:15:52] death took them
[1:15:56] are you with me it wasn't that brother
[1:15:58] branham wasn't what wasn't
[1:16:00] wasn't ready for the rapture it was his
[1:16:03] time was over with and he preaches
[1:16:06] communion he preaches leadership he
[1:16:08] preaches his sermons preparing getting
[1:16:10] ready to go he had seen his end at 56 a
[1:16:13] long time ago
[1:16:15] but the message had to be sent out
[1:16:17] [Applause]
[1:16:19] and a lot of people sorted through it
[1:16:20] got what they wanted walked away from it
[1:16:23] but there was a group of people that
[1:16:26] were ordained
[1:16:29] [Applause]
[1:16:47] that was you
[1:16:49] that's a jew brother the menace that's
[1:16:50] exactly right
[1:16:52] that was you
[1:16:56] what made the difference between you
[1:16:58] caught it
[1:16:59] and your family didn't
[1:17:05] why are you here
[1:17:11] why are you here
[1:17:19] i think about this family right here
[1:17:20] that's here

[1:17:28] and here they are
[1:17:32] you came from a denominal church and i'm
[1:17:34] not going to point that out
[1:17:36] but that pastor called
[1:17:37] called andrew and he was in
[1:17:41] he was in
[1:17:42] japan and he was trying to convince
[1:17:45] andrew that this wasn't right
[1:17:47] he spent about an hour
[1:17:49] and then all of a sudden he began to get
[1:17:50] convinced himself that what andrew was
[1:17:52] preaching to you was right
[1:18:03] mary davis how did you get here
[1:18:08] what kept you here
[1:18:12] joel what are you doing here
[1:18:16] how did you get here
[1:18:20] he was telling me some of his story
[1:18:23] and he said i was i was trying to get
[1:18:25] off the grid
[1:18:28] he said i was trying to live
[1:18:30] live to where there was no
[1:18:32] no electricity no no no whirly he said i
[1:18:36] was just trying to get away didn't know
[1:18:37] nothing about the message someone hands
[1:18:39] him a book
[1:18:41] hallelujah
[1:18:46] you look back and go well
[1:18:49] well my family was raised in this church
[1:18:52] don't take that for granted
[1:18:56] don't take that for granted don't just
[1:18:58] let that stumble through well i'm
[1:18:59] occupying a few because
[1:19:01] my family was raised in this church
[1:19:04] don't be a part of the missing
[1:19:08] don't be a part of the fulfillment of
[1:19:10] when we're all gone that you knock on
[1:19:12] the door and go where's brother run at
[1:19:21] well brother on los angeles hasn't
[1:19:22] dropped
[1:19:24] i'll be honest with you i don't want to
[1:19:25] be here when los angeles drops
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:36] well haven't you read the prophecy and
[1:19:38] haven't you read all of those things and
[1:19:40] haven't you read about may's store
[1:19:42] have you looked up may's store lately
[1:19:46] they're a shark exhibit
[1:19:50] they've got sharks
[1:19:52] as exhibits in may store
[1:19:56] so sometimes visions is not exactly how
[1:19:58] you think they're going to be
[1:20:01] so don't think that you get this thing
[1:20:03] figured out and well we're going to just
[1:20:05] be here in 2074
[1:20:11] we have arrived
[1:20:20] i remember asking my brother that is now
[1:20:22] the pastor
[1:20:25] at the church
[1:20:27] when i walked up to him and i asked him
[1:20:30] it was on a saturday afternoon
[1:20:32] and he was a bowling champion and he was
[1:20:35] getting ready to go pro
[1:20:37] and he was and he had an average of over
[1:20:39] 225 and for those bowlers that know
[1:20:41] anything about that i got an average of
[1:20:43] about 80 probably
[1:20:48] you know he thought he had the whirl by
[1:20:50] the tail
[1:20:52] your father
[1:20:57] and i looked at him and i said
[1:21:01] so what excuse do you have
[1:21:05] and i'm standing with him i'm his
[1:21:07] brother sometimes brothers can look eye
[1:21:09] to eye with one another
[1:21:11] and i said what excuse do you have
[1:21:15] for not serving god we've had a message
[1:21:17] to get us ready
[1:21:20] now what excuse do you have to not be
[1:21:23] ready
[1:21:26] you remember jesus comes into the room
[1:21:28] and
[1:21:29] there's a man there that doesn't have
[1:21:31] the wedding garment on
[1:21:35] and he doesn't go
[1:21:37] somebody bring this man a garment
[1:21:40] somebody somebody get a garment real
[1:21:42] quick
[1:21:43] get a garment
[1:21:45] uh get a garment for this man he said
[1:21:47] cast him out
[1:21:52] the garment is the the word of the hour
[1:21:55] the holy ghost
[1:21:56] it's your seal that god has placed
[1:21:59] ownership on you
[1:22:02] before god gives you the holy ghost he
[1:22:04] cleanses you
[1:22:07] you're baptized in the name of the lord
[1:22:09] jesus christ
[1:22:10] and then god fills you with the holy
[1:22:13] ghost
[1:22:14] now listen being god he knows what your
[1:22:16] god is a king of your heart
[1:22:18] and he's not going to seal a
[1:22:20] pornographed spirit
[1:22:22] he's not going to seal lust demons and
[1:22:25] rock and roll demons and
[1:22:28] churches and demons
[1:22:30] he's going to wash you and purge you and
[1:22:32] clean you and get you ready for service
[1:22:36] then you've got a purpose to serve god
[1:22:38] the rest of your life
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:51] denny vance
[1:22:53] this is much better greater to be a
[1:22:55] deacon in a church
[1:22:58] than be a professional wrestler
[1:23:06] what held him
[1:23:08] the holy ghost held him
[1:23:11] what holds us
[1:23:13] through trials and situations
[1:23:22] i think we're getting numb sometime
[1:23:25] i think we get to the place to where we
[1:23:26] get numb
[1:23:29] if we're not careful
[1:23:31] i'm going to address some things so you
[1:23:33] just hang right with me
[1:23:37] we allow church to become common
[1:23:41] there's a revival that's going on
[1:23:42] amongst us here
[1:23:44] the angel lord is with us
[1:23:46] he's with us he's proved himself to be
[1:23:48] with us and i'm not just saying that
[1:23:50] just to be saying that
[1:23:52] we've seen him
[1:23:54] we've seen the pillar of fire
[1:23:59] we're living in the season of
[1:24:02] of the revival is happening
[1:24:05] the last ones are coming in
[1:24:07] getting ready
[1:24:09] because there's a home going that's
[1:24:10] coming
[1:24:16] my brother began to stand there and talk
[1:24:18] to me about
[1:24:19] what was holding him back
[1:24:25] the guy that he bowled with
[1:24:27] had a massive heart attack that next
[1:24:30] week
[1:24:31] and died in his arms
[1:24:36] mark played
[1:24:37] another week or two
[1:24:40] and he was accused of sandbagging
[1:24:44] and a man pulled a gun on him and
[1:24:45] threatened his life
[1:24:49] mark was traveling doing
[1:24:53] work
[1:24:54] and it was in a parking lot in the
[1:24:56] middle of the night that the lord met
[1:24:58] him
[1:25:00] and he gave his heart to the lord
[1:25:02] and he never turned back from that
[1:25:04] moment
[1:25:09] brother meadows many years ago was
[1:25:11] walking
[1:25:13] and i hope this is all right
[1:25:15] he was at a point of his life
[1:25:17] of wanting to commit suicide
[1:25:20] isn't that right
[1:25:28] we look at him as the strongest man
[1:25:30] we've ever known in natural flesh
[1:25:33] for those that didn't know that ernest
[1:25:36] take it from me he's the strongest
[1:25:38] physical human being i've ever known
[1:25:41] in human flesh
[1:25:44] we we dug a whale down here
[1:25:47] and i watched four men
[1:25:49] try to pick this bit up
[1:25:51] and they couldn't pick it up
[1:25:53] and i i joined with them and another man
[1:25:56] joined with them and they we got the bid
[1:25:57] up on the trailer and so when that
[1:26:00] company backed up here
[1:26:02] and that bit needed to come off of that
[1:26:04] trailer and be stood up brother meadows
[1:26:07] just rich and got it and pulled it up
[1:26:08] and stood it right there
[1:26:15] but they're coming in to that kind of
[1:26:17] strength
[1:26:20] there comes an end to that kind of
[1:26:21] strength
[1:26:23] but there's another strength that he
[1:26:25] possesses
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:37] and that's the readiness
[1:26:41] his wife slipped
[1:26:42] life could not be sustained in her body
[1:26:45] so she slipped into the message that we
[1:26:47] have preached all these years and she
[1:26:49] stepped into a well body she wouldn't
[1:26:52] want to come back
[1:26:54] she's experienced what this message has
[1:26:56] taught for years
[1:26:58] it's the truth
[1:27:00] it's absolutely the truth
[1:27:26] you can look across this audience at his
[1:27:28] family
[1:27:29] they're sitting here
[1:27:31] i want to tell children grandchildren
[1:27:34] great-grandchildren
[1:27:35] don't take these services for granted
[1:27:43] don't take it for granted
[1:27:47] noah
[1:27:48] no i could just stand in your chair it'd
[1:27:50] be the only time i'm going to ever ask
[1:27:51] you to do that would you stand on your
[1:27:53] chair
[1:27:58] noah's got a name to him
[1:28:03] noah is a product of that man believing
[1:28:05] the message
[1:28:08] where's his grandma out i can't find her
[1:28:10] i'm looking my eyes are my eyes are not
[1:28:13] good
[1:28:16] could you stand
[1:28:20] you became acquainted many years ago
[1:28:24] with the god of this message
[1:28:28] and you went through a very difficult
[1:28:30] time
[1:28:31] when your husband slipped beyond the
[1:28:33] veil
[1:28:35] and he was a pillar
[1:28:38] and every time i have a vision of homer
[1:28:40] or a dream of homer your husband's
[1:28:42] standing there
[1:28:43] now it's not a season to get jealous
[1:28:45] because
[1:28:46] in that realm it's all taken care of
[1:28:49] thank you roger for being a phenomenal
[1:28:51] husband
[1:28:53] well let me just say this to you he
[1:28:56] slipped beyond
[1:28:58] and i re i was standing there the night
[1:29:00] that billy andrews said i'm telling you
[1:29:02] i'm telling you tonight that this man is
[1:29:05] filled with with a black sheet on him
[1:29:07] and if god don't touch him he's going to
[1:29:09] be gone in six weeks
[1:29:11] six weeks to the day he was gone
[1:29:18] death didn't conquer him
[1:29:22] this message that he loved with
[1:29:25] everything in him
[1:29:26] carried him to a new body
[1:29:30] and every time i have a vision of of
[1:29:32] homer or a dream of homer
[1:29:35] he's standing in there what around
[1:29:44] i don't know what time i
[1:29:50] started maybe you're new to the message
[1:29:53] and i don't know who's here who's not
[1:29:54] here
[1:29:56] and you forgive me
[1:29:58] my eyes are just out of balance and i'm
[1:30:00] doing the best i can so
[1:30:07] but brother branham was standing in a
[1:30:09] cave
[1:30:14] in 1946
[1:30:19] there's a room he calls it a room he
[1:30:20] calls it a few different things
[1:30:23] a cave
[1:30:26] as a man steps in the room
[1:30:28] a man from another realm
[1:30:32] and he steps in that room
[1:30:35] and he begins to tell him of what his
[1:30:37] ministry
[1:30:38] has been
[1:30:40] and what it's going to be
[1:30:45] that angel
[1:30:47] that steps into the room
[1:30:54] is standing there having a conversation
[1:30:56] with a man
[1:30:57] that is like sarah
[1:31:00] i can't do it
[1:31:02] no doubt it was the same angelic
[1:31:04] presence that was with moses
[1:31:07] when moses is going to be a one-man
[1:31:09] invasion
[1:31:13] but they had a
[1:31:14] conversation about me
[1:31:24] nathaniel me and you've been in rooms
[1:31:26] to where they were discovering cancer
[1:31:30] it's really good to have you with me
[1:31:32] we've been in some dark spots together
[1:31:39] where they would tell me that i've got
[1:31:40] stage four
[1:31:42] then we have a cancer in my brain
[1:31:47] cancer in my lungs
[1:31:50] but here's really important to me
[1:31:55] they would stand there and talk about
[1:31:56] cancer
[1:31:59] the disease that
[1:32:01] many struggle with that are listening
[1:32:02] right now
[1:32:04] sister ruth wilson just found out she
[1:32:06] has cancer and brother tim pruitt's
[1:32:09] she's trying to muster the faith
[1:32:12] others have written me there's a sister
[1:32:14] in
[1:32:16] in canada
[1:32:18] that is at the door of death
[1:32:20] and i
[1:32:21] and she's no doubt listening
[1:32:24] i want you to understand that that angel
[1:32:26] was standing with the prophet
[1:32:29] and he spoke
[1:32:31] not even cancer
[1:32:34] [Applause]
[1:32:36] not even cancer
[1:32:38] the most difficult demon in the world
[1:32:42] not even cancer will stand before it
[1:32:45] [Applause]
[1:32:50] not even cancer will stand before it
[1:32:56] it's okay
[1:33:00] satan's trying to get me to stop but he
[1:33:02] ain't getting me
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:18] brother
[1:33:21] i'd like to just drop this to you
[1:33:23] that was a very important meeting
[1:33:28] say well i don't know where i believe
[1:33:30] that or not
[1:33:31] i'm not here even to negotiate that with
[1:33:33] you
[1:33:35] it happened
[1:33:39] it happened
[1:33:41] and for the next decades
[1:33:44] the prophet would stand there
[1:33:46] and it was not a gift
[1:33:50] but the one that matth that andrew
[1:33:52] preached about last night the mighty
[1:33:54] angel stood there
[1:33:57] and night after night
[1:33:59] 8 300 visions
[1:34:02] 83 80
[1:34:04] to be exact
[1:34:07] 8300 visions
[1:34:10] took place in brother branham's ministry
[1:34:13] and it was exactly right
[1:34:17] and that's just what's on tape
[1:34:26] brother shannon i find this absolutely
[1:34:28] amazing
[1:34:30] war has not been in europe
[1:34:34] since before the angel stood
[1:34:38] in a cave with a prophet
[1:34:43] and i've been thinking about this over
[1:34:44] the last couple of weeks
[1:34:46] what has held it back
[1:34:51] what has held it back all of this
[1:34:54] so i come to the conclusion
[1:34:56] you have
[1:35:01] you were the important one
[1:35:05] now now let me just say this to you
[1:35:08] readiness means a lot to a lot of
[1:35:10] different people
[1:35:12] i have a friend of mine that's a general
[1:35:16] in the military
[1:35:18] that is in in charge
[1:35:22] of the buttons
[1:35:26] how i became a friend of his was being a
[1:35:28] a chimney sweep
[1:35:31] in his home many times
[1:35:33] he actually paid me in gold
[1:35:37] i've got it somewhere
[1:35:41] because he said it's coming
[1:35:43] it's not an if
[1:35:45] he'd never heard the prophet
[1:35:50] my dad stood and
[1:35:52] i i put a a a class a chimney in his
[1:35:54] house cut the holes
[1:35:57] did all the alignment
[1:35:59] put everything together
[1:36:01] and dad stood
[1:36:03] for over five hours
[1:36:06] and told that general
[1:36:08] about the god sending a messenger to
[1:36:11] this day and he stood spellbound
[1:36:16] because he's one of the original
[1:36:17] preppers
[1:36:20] and he had dug a bomb shelter
[1:36:23] and he had canned food
[1:36:25] and he was ready he said it's not if
[1:36:28] it's going to happen it's going to
[1:36:30] happen
[1:36:34] no message to get him ready
[1:36:37] he never heard it
[1:36:39] it didn't come by his way
[1:36:41] but it did yours
[1:36:45] those that are listening by the internet
[1:36:46] intently it came your way you talk about
[1:36:50] grace
[1:36:54] you're talking about grace that man
[1:36:57] lives on a hair trigger
[1:37:00] he knows readiness
[1:37:11] in 1986 i set in a service
[1:37:15] and it was a preacher that stood in the
[1:37:16] pulpit
[1:37:18] and preached a sermon out of hebrews
[1:37:19] chapter 12 and i'll be done in just a
[1:37:22] few more minutes i'm getting a little
[1:37:23] bit weak
[1:37:24] but i want to just share this with you i
[1:37:26] said and i listened
[1:37:31] and he spoke about others have run
[1:37:34] and he talked about smith wigglesworth
[1:37:37] and he talked about f.f bosworth
[1:37:40] and he talked about peter cartwright and
[1:37:43] he talked about john wesley
[1:37:48] do you know that john wesley was was
[1:37:50] stoned over and over and over again
[1:37:54] and he kept getting up and preaching the
[1:37:56] next day
[1:37:58] they beat him and they beat him with
[1:38:00] whips
[1:38:01] trying to get him to quit preaching and
[1:38:03] that five-foot-one red-headed preacher
[1:38:05] had something on the inside of him
[1:38:08] [Applause]
[1:38:09] that was bigger than all their whips and
[1:38:11] all of their rocks
[1:38:13] and being thrown out of churches
[1:38:17] don't tell me your excuses some friend
[1:38:20] don't tell me your excuses some debt
[1:38:23] denomination
[1:38:24] where ichabod has been written on the
[1:38:26] door and the spirit of god is not even
[1:38:29] going to go back to it
[1:38:33] don't tell me it's your job
[1:38:40] do you know that there are millionaires
[1:38:44] in bomb shelters in ukraine
[1:38:46] and they don't have a drop of money
[1:38:48] because their money evaporated in the
[1:38:50] banks it's gone
[1:38:53] it's just literally gone
[1:38:58] aren't you glad that's in ukraine
[1:39:01] aren't you glad
[1:39:02] it's in ukraine people get all so
[1:39:04] excited about their million dollars in
[1:39:06] their
[1:39:10] bank and a cyber warfare happens
[1:39:14] and everything that they've worked for
[1:39:16] and everything they built for is gone
[1:39:18] and and somebody has to tell them that
[1:39:20] it's gone

[1:39:29] ira account
[1:39:33] you better not count on it
[1:39:38] you better not count on it
[1:39:49] i stood in a house that was 48 000
[1:39:51] square feet
[1:39:53] thousand square feet
[1:39:55] it's a residential home
[1:39:58] owned by
[1:40:00] a lady and her husband
[1:40:03] a friend of mine jason jackson actually
[1:40:05] wired that house
[1:40:07] as an electrician
[1:40:11] and i walked out on the front of it and
[1:40:13] it had a bow range it had about
[1:40:16] 10 to 15 bedrooms in it bathrooms
[1:40:18] everywhere a safe room
[1:40:20] and it had everything you can imagine
[1:40:24] it had a nanny room it had a
[1:40:26] it had a mother-in-law suite it was it
[1:40:29] was it was unbelievable
[1:40:32] and i walked out and there's a it's a
[1:40:34] cliff there
[1:40:36] and i walked out and i i looked down
[1:40:38] that cliff at the river the river is
[1:40:40] running below it
[1:40:41] and i looked across the hill and that's
[1:40:43] where
[1:40:45] there's where a tornado came across and
[1:40:47] destroyed every business
[1:40:50] mode that entire place
[1:40:52] just mowed it down and it was gone
[1:40:53] kentucky fried was gone it's probably
[1:40:55] the greatest problem kentucky fried was
[1:40:58] washed away
[1:41:01] it just the business was there and was
[1:41:04] gone
[1:41:05] it was there and it was gone
[1:41:09] and i said jason

[1:41:14] one
[1:41:15] one one afternoon bright sunny day storm
[1:41:20] with a funny tail on the end of it
[1:41:22] can wipe away this 48
[1:41:26] thousand
[1:41:27] square feet house
[1:41:31] one afternoon
[1:41:32] he's just gone
[1:41:35] this is gone

[1:42:10] he drove it out of the parking lot
[1:42:12] and he went less than a mile
[1:42:14] and he destroyed that car
[1:42:17] literally
[1:42:19] literally i couldn't help i couldn't
[1:42:20] help but feel sorry for him and laugh at
[1:42:22] the same time
[1:42:24] come
[1:42:26] on he just got in it
[1:42:29] he just thought it was great
[1:42:31] and it was good
[1:42:35] he was gone
[1:42:41] when i was a little boy
[1:42:42] me and your daddy
[1:42:44] we lived in a trailer it was 14 by
[1:42:48] 70.
[1:42:49] we lived in a trailer we had the back
[1:42:50] rooms
[1:42:52] and we were so
[1:42:54] on alert for the rapture
[1:42:57] until when we would wake up in the night
[1:42:58] i'd go shake him
[1:43:00] and i always called him a monkey in bed
[1:43:02] because he was always all over the bed
[1:43:03] mark i'm sorry
[1:43:07] and we would go
[1:43:09] and we go i can't hear mom and dad
[1:43:11] as the rapture happened and they're gone
[1:43:16] it's a real real thing to children
[1:43:19] it's a real thing to children and i'm
[1:43:21] saying this for a reason
[1:43:25] and we would slip up and we would slip
[1:43:27] up
[1:43:28] and there was a bathroom there was a
[1:43:29] little hall
[1:43:31] and then there was a king-sized bed
[1:43:32] where my mom and dad
[1:43:34] snored in
[1:43:38] they'll understand if they hear this
[1:43:42] and when you would get so close you
[1:43:44] didn't need to go another step forward
[1:43:46] to know that they were there
[1:43:48] everything's fine
[1:43:50] they were there
[1:43:52] it was a rumble

[1:44:11] you know i know yeah we're old enough
[1:44:13] you know what i'm talking about
[1:44:16] but that was the most comforting sound

[1:44:21] to hear her
[1:44:27] because she was there
[1:44:31] are you with me
[1:44:33] because we were so believing it was just

[1:44:53] it's for your children

[1:45:00] when the death age was coming when moses
[1:45:02] was healed

[1:45:07] the door
[1:45:08] blood from a spotless lamb
[1:45:12] and they would paint
[1:45:15] the door lentil
[1:45:17] they would paint with that blood and
[1:45:19] then they would eat the book or eat the
[1:45:22] lamb
[1:45:24] and eat it all
[1:45:25] and if it wasn't if you couldn't eat it
[1:45:27] all you got other people in with you and
