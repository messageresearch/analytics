[22:47] still in the mercy business and on a
[22:50] road

[34:55] if it's all right with ron i want to go
[34:56] ahead and call that devil out in the
[34:57] street this morning
[34:59] amen because the ones he believes he's
[35:02] got the grips around he doesn't have
[35:03] he doesn't have a strand to hold on and
[35:06] just as i told you last night it's time
[35:08] to stand and fight
[35:09] and i've been standing i've been
[35:10] fighting for my family
[35:13] and this is one standing right here and
[35:15] last night
[35:16] during service i looked and i looked
[35:19] over at her and i could tell
[35:20] i could tell god was god was working god
[35:23] was
[35:24] god was speaking directly to her through
[35:25] that service and i'm sure there's more
[35:26] that's standing here that god was
[35:28] speaking directly to
[35:30] and as we went as we went to the house
[35:33] we usually go out to eat
[35:34] we ended up we all went back to ronald
[35:36] connie's and we were all just
[35:38] speaking about the service and talking
[35:40] about it and
[35:41] i began to take i was taking sarah back
[35:44] and
[35:44] um i knocking came on my window and i
[35:47] was like good lord what malachi was
[35:48] calling me
[35:49] we're driving down the driveway i said
[35:50] what do you want boyle come back
[35:52] he said he said you need to come in here
[35:54] something's going on
[35:55] he said okay so i backed up i wasn't
[35:58] sure exactly what was going on
[36:00] as soon as i walked into the house i
[36:02] could i could tell that there was a
[36:03] there was that atmosphere in there that
[36:05] that something something
[36:08] really powerful was was happening um i
[36:11] saw ron he was he was speaking to
[36:13] charity and
[36:14] um she was in tears and i could tell
[36:16] that god was really speaking and moving
[36:17] on her life
[36:18] and so we all we all gathered hands and
[36:20] we went there in the living room and we
[36:22] circled around
[36:23] circled around ron and circled around
[36:25] charities he grabbed her by the
[36:26] shoulders and
[36:28] as we all bowed our heads to pray as you
[36:31] could just tell that there was something
[36:32] different we could tell that god was
[36:34] coming down
[36:35] and as i was praying as i had my eyes
[36:37] shut his mind was shut the entire time
[36:39] and as
[36:40] i was praying there was a light that
[36:42] just came down
[36:43] and with my eyes shut i could see the
[36:45] light literally coming down from
[36:47] coming down from from heaven and as it
[36:49] was coming down
[36:51] as i could just tell and it was right
[36:52] one right when ron was speaking as even
[36:54] as that angel standing
[36:55] here now and i just held on to that
[36:57] close because i'm very sensitive when
[36:59] trying to see those things if i see
[37:00] something i just want to make sure that
[37:02] it's god and
[37:03] it's not just a light or something like
[37:05] that was i was
[37:06] taking taking sarah back after that um i
[37:09] was i was we were talking about service
[37:12] and i was actually speaking about
[37:13] service and she kind of spoke up and she
[37:15] goes you talk about the light

[41:16] [Music]
[41:18] so why am i doubting
[41:22] when you prove that you'd fight for me

[41:51] [Music]

[42:46] [Music]

[43:00] can barely breathe

[43:15] i can't face anything
[43:20] cause you're here with
[43:23] me i can do
[43:27] all things cause your strength
[43:33] in me i remember how he
[43:36] showed me
[43:40] the price of my redemption
[43:45] but how could i question
[43:49] when you prove that you die for me
[43:56] you've walked me through fires
[44:01] and pulled me from flames
[44:06] if you're in this with me
[44:12] i won't be
[44:14] [Music]
[44:21] and afraid and it feels like
[44:24] i can barely breathe
[44:28] walk through these fires
[44:31] cause you're walking with me
[44:38] i'll walk through these fires
[44:41] cause you're walking with me
[44:57] hallelujah we can go through all things
[45:00] knowing he's right there with us
[45:02] amen what a powerful powerful song
[45:05] amen i i remember when sister charity
[45:08] was singing that song i
[45:09] had come back to my memory my martini
[45:12] used to sing that song
[45:14] and she could just she could just play
[45:16] that piano you know at old pentecostal
[45:18] style and
[45:19] phil felt like the keys were about to
[45:21] come off the board you know and
[45:23] she could play that thing and i remember
[45:25] one time she got to play in that thing
[45:26] and jumped off off that
[45:28] up that seat started shouting
[45:31] she didn't she didn't she didn't she
[45:34] sure enjoyed her religion
[45:37] she and sure enjoyed it and i sure
[45:39] enjoyed mine
[45:40] i sure enjoy what he's done for us and i
[45:43] think that that dimension's ever getting
[45:45] so close
[45:46] that we can see them we can feel them
[45:49] and they're moving amongst us in one of
[45:51] these mornings
[45:52] they're going to step out and we're
[45:55] going to invite them on
[45:56] in and we're going to we're going to
[45:57] talk about the good things of god
[46:01] i was thinking i'm just thinking brother
[46:04] william
[46:04] i might be telling stories out of school
[46:06] here but brother william
[46:08] i was had related to us one time about
[46:11] when his
[46:11] when his father was on was on like a
[46:13] facetime or a skype and
[46:15] he was with some believers on in romania
[46:19] and they were there and they testified
[46:22] his mother had done passed away
[46:24] and they testified that they had seen
[46:26] her standing behind brother william's
[46:28] dad
[46:30] and you know and they'd seen her
[46:32] standing right there i believe that's
[46:34] correct
[46:35] that dimension's real close that
[46:37] dimension is really really close and if
[46:40] you could just be aware this morning
[46:41] that the mighty god is
[46:43] is ever so close and he's coming to meet
[46:45] his children
[46:46] and his brother ron would get ready to
[46:48] come and make his way this morning to

[53:40] amen we're just so honored and we called
[53:43] dad this morning to share that news with
[53:45] him
[53:46] and he was so thrilled about that as
[53:48] well and so
[53:50] his oldest brother is being buried today
[53:52] and he was a church of god
[53:54] bishop for many many years and a church
[53:58] of god a prophecy
[53:59] bishop for many many years and toward
[54:02] the latter end of his life
[54:04] to when he was still mobile and
[54:08] he used to come to dad's church and
[54:09] they'd pick him up every night and he
[54:11] would come to the church
[54:12] sit and listen to the word and he
[54:15] sure enjoyed the word the message

[54:35] this morning that i didn't go to my

[1:04:02] hallelujah
[1:04:07] jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 5.
[1:04:12] before i formed thee in the belly
[1:04:17] i knew thee that's so powerful
[1:04:21] that's one of the most powerful
[1:04:22] scriptures i know of
[1:04:25] and before thou camest out of the womb
[1:04:28] i sanctified thee
[1:04:32] and i ordained thee a prophet
[1:04:35] unto the nations
[1:04:38] genesis chapter 17 and verse 1.
[1:04:45] and when abram was 90 and 9
[1:04:49] the lord appeared to abram
[1:04:52] and said unto him i am the almighty god
[1:04:57] walk before me and be thou perfect
[1:05:01] and i will make my covenant between me
[1:05:04] and thee
[1:05:05] and will multiply thee exceedingly
[1:05:09] and abram fell on his face and taught
[1:05:12] and god talked with him saying
[1:05:14] as for me behold my covenant
[1:05:17] is with thee and thou shalt be
[1:05:20] a father of many nations
[1:05:25] neither shall thy name any more be
[1:05:29] called
[1:05:29] abram but thy name shall be
[1:05:32] abraham for a father
[1:05:36] of many nations have i made thee
[1:05:39] and i will make thee exceedingly
[1:05:42] fruitful
[1:05:43] and i will make nations of thee and
[1:05:46] kings shall come out of thee
[1:05:50] and we can say and god did it
[1:05:54] you can be seated this morning may the
[1:05:56] lord bless the reading of his word
[1:06:01] this morning i would like to speak to
[1:06:03] you
[1:06:04] and this has been on my heart for for
[1:06:06] some time now
[1:06:08] on hold your position hallelujah
[1:06:13] now position is authority
[1:06:17] you understand that as a believer
[1:06:21] as a believer of this word you have more
[1:06:24] authority than the angels that are in
[1:06:26] heaven
[1:06:27] that's quite a statement it's quite a
[1:06:30] very active statement
[1:06:32] now god has predestinated you to live in
[1:06:34] this age
[1:06:35] as we heard last night not to survive
[1:06:40] but to overcome and overcome means to
[1:06:44] prevail you're going to wrestle you're
[1:06:46] going to be in the darkness but you're
[1:06:48] going to wrestle
[1:06:50] you were built for this age you're the
[1:06:53] final
[1:06:54] infantry if it might be said you're the
[1:06:57] final group to fight
[1:06:59] against laodicea
[1:07:02] and this is satan's last
[1:07:05] opportunity to destroy
[1:07:08] the gift of god that he's placed on the
[1:07:11] earth
[1:07:13] but i want to the to just raise our flag
[1:07:16] one more time and make a declaration on
[1:07:19] this hill
[1:07:21] there's outposts all across the world
[1:07:25] in every nation there are believers
[1:07:28] where there are 10 people
[1:07:29] or 5 000 people we are believers and we
[1:07:33] hold our position well
[1:07:38] we refuse to give up
[1:07:41] we refuse to turn back we may be in this
[1:07:45] world but we're not
[1:07:46] of this world the world is headed toward
[1:07:51] tribulation period
[1:07:52] it's not going to get better
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:58] but while we are here we are the
[1:08:02] salt of the earth we are the light
[1:08:06] in the darkness of this age
[1:08:13] we heard this last week and i thought
[1:08:16] this would go quite well with this
[1:08:17] morning

[1:10:56] he might have been a man
[1:10:59] a man crying this is jesus
[1:11:03] but but when he called that man out of
[1:11:06] the grave
[1:11:08] that man that had been dead for four
[1:11:10] days
[1:11:11] and he sold four days journey somewhere
[1:11:14] i don't know where it was at neither do
[1:11:16] you
[1:11:17] so anyhow he called him back
[1:11:21] corruption knew its master
[1:11:26] soul knew its creator and a man that had
[1:11:29] been dead stood on his feet and lived
[1:11:31] again
[1:11:32] after dead after being dead four days
[1:11:36] that was more than a man that was god
[1:11:42] it was a man that when he came down off
[1:11:44] of the mountain that night and was
[1:11:46] hungry
[1:11:47] and looked all around over a fig
[1:11:50] tree to find something to eat he was a
[1:11:53] man when he was hungry
[1:11:55] but when he taken five biscuits and two
[1:11:57] fish and fed five thousand
[1:11:59] that was more than a man he was a man
[1:12:03] that he was laying out there in the back
[1:12:05] of a boat that night
[1:12:07] where ten thousand devils of the sea
[1:12:09] swore
[1:12:10] that they would drown him and a little
[1:12:12] low boat in that storm like a
[1:12:14] bottle stopper out there somewhere
[1:12:17] floating up and down like that
[1:12:18] he was a man when he was asleep he was
[1:12:21] tired virtue had went out of him
[1:12:23] but when he put his foot on the brow
[1:12:26] that boat
[1:12:27] and looked up and said peace be sealed
[1:12:29] and the winds and waves obeyed him
[1:12:31] that was more than a man that was god in
[1:12:35] christ
[1:12:36] reconciling the world to himself he was
[1:12:39] a man when he died on the cross
[1:12:41] crying for mercy that's right but he was
[1:12:44] god on easter morning when he broke the
[1:12:48] seal was in the tomb and rose up
[1:12:50] and ascended on high ever living to make
[1:12:54] intercessions

[1:13:04] today and forever

[1:13:33] christ

[1:13:37] christ

[1:13:43] covenant with abraham
[1:13:46] god asked him to count the the dust of
[1:13:49] the sand
[1:13:51] he said no man can count that so shall
[1:13:54] thy seed be
[1:13:56] god asked him to look toward the heaven
[1:14:00] said can you count the stars
[1:14:04] you remember the stars were laid out
[1:14:06] that's the first bible
[1:14:09] and every star has a position
[1:14:13] great and small every star has a
[1:14:17] position
[1:14:18] and it holds its position tonight or the
[1:14:21] whole thing would get out of order
[1:14:24] are you with me now that's god's great
[1:14:27] bible
[1:14:28] never has to be rewritten it was laid
[1:14:31] out there

[1:14:35] and that was god's bible on the earth
[1:14:40] can you count the stars abraham
[1:14:44] he was standing there childless
[1:14:51] and that's telling him if you can see
[1:14:54] the future

[1:15:38] week we've watched a building collapse
[1:15:43] a building collapsed about 150 people is
[1:15:47] missing they declared this morning
[1:15:50] they don't know they've just found a few
[1:15:52] but
[1:15:54] they're digging tirelessly and thank god
[1:15:56] for that and i
[1:15:57] actually pray that god would help them
[1:16:01] two years ago in 2018
[1:16:04] there was an engineer that went under
[1:16:06] that building
[1:16:08] and looked at all the substructure
[1:16:13] and he warned them that this building is
[1:16:16] deteriorating
[1:16:18] the sea water that is coming in from the
[1:16:21] ground is deteriorating the concrete
[1:16:23] and the steel something must be done
[1:16:34] the warning was sent out
[1:16:39] i want to read you another warning come
[1:16:41] on
[1:16:43] 1965 brother brahm said this is a solemn
[1:16:47] warning
[1:16:49] we don't know what time you don't know
[1:16:51] what time that this city one day is
[1:16:54] going to be laying
[1:16:56] out here in the bottom of this ocean
[1:16:59] oh capernaum said jesus thou who exalted
[1:17:03] in the heavens
[1:17:04] will be brought down into hell for if
[1:17:07] the mighty works that were done in sodom
[1:17:10] and gomorrah
[1:17:10] it would be been it would still be it
[1:17:13] would have been standing to this day and
[1:17:16] sodom and gomorrah lays in the bottom of
[1:17:18] the dead sea
[1:17:19] and capernaum is in the bottom of the
[1:17:22] sea
[1:17:22] thou city that who claims to be
[1:17:26] the city of angels who has exalted her
[1:17:30] yourself into heaven and sent all all
[1:17:33] the dirty filthy things of fashions and
[1:17:35] things
[1:17:36] till even foreign countries come here to
[1:17:39] pick up our
[1:17:39] filth and send it away to your fine
[1:17:42] churches and steeples and so forth the
[1:17:44] way you do
[1:17:45] remember one day you'll be laying at the
[1:17:48] bottom of the sea
[1:17:50] your great honeycomb under you right now
[1:17:53] the wrath of god is belching right
[1:17:55] beneath you
[1:17:57] how much longer he will hold the sandbar
[1:18:00] hanging out over that when that ocean
[1:18:04] out yonder a mild deep will slide in
[1:18:07] there
[1:18:08] pump back to the salton sea it'll be
[1:18:11] worse than the last day of pompeii
[1:18:15] repent los angeles
[1:18:20] repent the rest of you and turn to god
[1:18:23] the hour of his wrath is upon the earth
[1:18:26] flee while there's time to flee and
[1:18:29] coming to christ
[1:18:32] god sent an engineer
[1:18:39] and he gave him a solemn warning we're
[1:18:41] talking we're not talking about one
[1:18:43] building
[1:18:44] we're talking about an entire city
[1:18:46] [Applause]
[1:18:48] everything that's under sea level
[1:18:53] the ocean in charlottesville
[1:18:57] come on the ocean over top of florida
[1:19:03] the ocean over top of the caribbean the
[1:19:06] ocean over top of
[1:19:08] of england you see god's not a weather
[1:19:12] forecaster
[1:19:14] and hits 17 so many times people live in
[1:19:18] sin thinking i'm going to always get by
[1:19:21] with it
[1:19:22] brother homer brother homer always made
[1:19:24] this statement he said your sins
[1:19:26] will find you out
[1:19:32] it's like a great a man came under a
[1:19:38] he came and he lived in a very beautiful
[1:19:40] spot
[1:19:42] there was a huge slab of a mountain that
[1:19:44] was just above his head
[1:19:47] but down beneath hundreds and hundreds
[1:19:50] of feet below
[1:19:52] maybe even a thousand feet below what's
[1:19:55] the most beautiful majestic
[1:19:56] place kind of a valley to live in
[1:20:01] people would come through and tell his
[1:20:03] family
[1:20:04] don't you know that that mountain one
[1:20:06] day is going to give way
[1:20:08] and it's going to fall
[1:20:12] they ignored the warning
[1:20:16] they got comfortable where they lived at
[1:20:20] it became a wonderful city for the
[1:20:22] people to live because one
[1:20:24] plus one equals two and after a while
[1:20:26] you've got hundreds of descendants and
[1:20:28] other people come to join you but yet
[1:20:31] the rock remained
[1:20:37] history tells us about a hundred years
[1:20:39] later
[1:20:40] that place was demolished because there
[1:20:43] was a warning came
[1:20:46] and they lived under the rock of sin
[1:20:54] and it destroyed the city
[1:20:59] i think about how our thoughts are today
[1:21:04] we think life will always be the same
[1:21:06] way
[1:21:07] life will always continue the way that
[1:21:09] it is
[1:21:12] but let me just say this to you we've
[1:21:13] had a message to get us ready
[1:21:18] brother branham would stand in pulpit
[1:21:20] after pulpit declaring the message of
[1:21:22] the
[1:21:22] hour and the work is going to happen
[1:21:27] i want to just make a few things very
[1:21:29] clear this morning
[1:21:30] this message has done exactly what it
[1:21:32] said it would do
[1:21:36] you don't have to question if it's right
[1:21:38] or it's not right
[1:21:40] you don't have to argue about the quotes
[1:21:42] and what you like and what you don't
[1:21:44] like
[1:21:47] you know this message is more than
[1:21:49] legalism
[1:21:51] it's more than men preaching god has got
[1:21:54] men all over the earth that refused to
[1:21:56] give up refused to back up
[1:22:00] this message goes from generation to
[1:22:02] generation
[1:22:03] it's the same life
[1:22:07] that was in a prophet of god passed
[1:22:09] right now
[1:22:11] because it wasn't the personality of
[1:22:13] william branham that we attached to
[1:22:16] it was the person of jesus christ
[1:22:20] this message is jesus living
[1:22:25] are you with me now and the same thing
[1:22:28] that happened
[1:22:29] last night in our living room
[1:22:32] it's the same jesus that my mother met
[1:22:36] as a methodist girl
[1:22:39] are you with me
[1:22:41] [Music]

[1:23:17] across the desk and said you whether you
[1:23:19] know it or not you're one of the
[1:23:21] strongest churches
[1:23:22] in this entire valley and i said it's
[1:23:24] not me
[1:23:37] i might be the chief financial officer
[1:23:40] but i
[1:23:40] i i am under the orders of jesus christ
[1:23:44] himself hallelujah this church
[1:23:48] wasn't built by man it was built by god
[1:23:52] [Applause]
[1:23:52] [Music]

[1:24:09] do you have in your church
[1:24:10] i said we have none we don't have a
[1:24:13] board here
[1:24:15] you don't have a board in your church i
[1:24:17] said no
[1:24:18] not a one i said we got trustees
[1:24:22] we got deacons and we got preachers in
[1:24:24] ministry
[1:24:25] but none of them are boards jesus is the
[1:24:29] ruler here at this
[1:24:30] church
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:34] hallelujah
[1:24:37] amen amen that may rub people
[1:24:41] gawd them just a little bit
[1:24:44] people love to vote they love to vote
[1:24:48] they love to
[1:24:49] have politics in church politics is of
[1:24:52] the devil
[1:24:53] [Applause]
[1:24:56] so don't get your eyes too much on
[1:24:58] washington it's of the devil
[1:25:04] good people go to washington and become
[1:25:10] corrupted
[1:25:12] that's not news don't get shook there
[1:25:15] that's not
[1:25:15] news
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:19] that's not news abraham lincoln was one
[1:25:21] of the most incredible presidents that
[1:25:23] we ever had
[1:25:24] but the railroad put abraham lincoln
[1:25:28] in washington
[1:25:32] ain't that right am i right that's what
[1:25:34] he did that's what they did
[1:25:38] whoo cut your politics you get nervous
[1:25:53] god has men he
[1:25:55] actually causes men to rise and fall
[1:25:59] he actually causes them to rise and fall
[1:26:02] you say even presidents
[1:26:04] sure he has precedence to put
[1:26:07] to move things from israel and move them
[1:26:10] right over to the right place
[1:26:12] the other day netanyahu was moved out of
[1:26:15] his position
[1:26:18] i told sister connie i said god did that
[1:26:23] god did that i don't understand the
[1:26:25] pieces of how it all comes together
[1:26:27] but the world is headed toward
[1:26:29] tribulation period
[1:26:31] and netanyahu could not be there
[1:26:36] because he stands like a prophet over
[1:26:38] top of israel
[1:26:41] and every nation will turn against
[1:26:42] israel one of these days
[1:26:45] but do you think that israel will bend
[1:26:47] or bow
[1:26:50] every day every day
[1:26:54] israel has to hold its position
[1:26:59] are you with me they send bombs over in
[1:27:02] on them
[1:27:02] they retaliate
[1:27:06] i think that's the way a christians
[1:27:08] ought to be
[1:27:09] when the devil sends a bomb to your
[1:27:11] house
[1:27:13] you don't have to stand there and
[1:27:15] surrender to that enemy
[1:27:17] you can send the word of god right
[1:27:19] against him
[1:27:20] because you're taught to hold your
[1:27:23] position
[1:27:24] [Applause]
[1:27:30] hallelujah
[1:27:36] i've laid my foundation now let's do
[1:27:38] some whooping on the devil for a little
[1:27:40] while
[1:27:41] yeah philippians chapter 1 and verse 6
[1:27:44] being confident of this very
[1:27:46] very thing that he which hath begun a
[1:27:49] good work in you
[1:27:51] will perform it until the day
[1:27:55] of jesus christ
[1:28:00] romans chapter 4 and verse 17
[1:28:03] as it is written i have made thee a
[1:28:05] father of many nations
[1:28:07] this is the new testament through the
[1:28:08] blood before
[1:28:10] him whom he believed even god who
[1:28:14] quickeneth the dead and recalleth those
[1:28:16] things which be not as though they were
[1:28:18] who against hope believed in hope
[1:28:22] that he might become the father of many
[1:28:24] nations
[1:28:25] according to that which was spoken so
[1:28:28] shall thy seed be
[1:28:30] and being not weak in faith he
[1:28:33] considered not his own body now
[1:28:35] dead when he was about a hundred years
[1:28:38] old neither the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:28:40] he staggered not
[1:28:44] just when your case looked so bleak he
[1:28:47] staggered not
[1:28:48] [Applause]
[1:28:50] at the promise of god through unbelief
[1:28:53] but was strong in faith
[1:28:55] giving glory to god and being fully
[1:28:57] persuaded
[1:28:58] that what he had promised he was able
[1:29:02] also to perform
[1:29:11] brother braham says this in the great
[1:29:13] warrior david
[1:29:15] he said one looks at it one way and one
[1:29:18] looks at it from
[1:29:19] from from the wisdom sense the other
[1:29:21] looks at it from a spiritual sense
[1:29:24] so it's just whichever way you base your
[1:29:26] faith
[1:29:27] if the doctor says it's finished and you
[1:29:31] believe that
[1:29:33] that settles it but if the doctor says
[1:29:38] it's finished and you don't believe it
[1:29:43] because god said something different
[1:29:46] watch
[1:29:46] what happens just depends on which way
[1:29:50] you let yourself go
[1:29:52] who you yield your members to
[1:29:55] that's whose servant you are
[1:30:03] he said you get along a lot better with
[1:30:05] your doctor
[1:30:06] but the doctor isn't your healer
[1:30:10] got your healer that's right your doctor
[1:30:14] only is his assistant to god
[1:30:17] he's only an assistant to god that's
[1:30:21] right
[1:30:21] but when the doctor's gone as far as he
[1:30:24] can go that's his limit
[1:30:26] and he can only work on what he sees
[1:30:29] and what he can feel that's all he knows
[1:30:33] but god controls the rest
[1:30:42] brother it happened to fall on the wrong
[1:30:46] ear that morning for him
[1:30:48] goliath there was a little fella
[1:30:51] standing out there that
[1:30:52] knowed where he was at
[1:30:55] what we need tonight is somebody else
[1:30:58] who knows where they're at what we need
[1:31:02] tonight is
[1:31:03] men and women who knows their position
[1:31:06] in jesus christ
[1:31:09] and when the devil makes his great boast
[1:31:12] sure he makes this great boast he's
[1:31:15] still making his
[1:31:16] most he's still got goliaths and we've
[1:31:19] still got some david's too
[1:31:21] thanks be to god for that he makes his
[1:31:24] big boast it fell on the ears of the
[1:31:26] wrong fella
[1:31:27] and that little fellow walking around
[1:31:28] there he had to look up to see he's a
[1:31:31] man
[1:31:32] like that but he knew that he was
[1:31:34] elected by god
[1:31:35] and he was anointed
[1:31:39] come on church god elected you god
[1:31:44] predestinated you
[1:31:45] not some feeble man
[1:31:49] not some fickle man but god
[1:31:52] predestinated you
[1:31:54] [Applause]
[1:31:56] brother anna sometimes i just feel like
[1:31:58] quitting tracked
[1:32:03] if you can you're not none of his if you
[1:32:06] can walk away
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:09] [Applause]
[1:32:10] if you can walk away it just proves
[1:32:13] what's inside of you
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:16] i may take a herald for the devil but
[1:32:18] that's the truth anyway
[1:32:20] because for a real believer there's no
[1:32:22] walking away for him
[1:32:38] oh
[1:32:43] we're not doing this by our emotions
[1:32:45] we're not doing this by our feelings
[1:32:50] we're not doing this because somebody's
[1:32:51] applauding us
[1:32:53] we're doing this because we're anchored
[1:32:55] in the word of god
[1:32:56] and let hill reach let every demon come
[1:32:59] against you
[1:33:00] god's for me who can be against me
[1:33:17] i've had a very public very visible
[1:33:20] fight
[1:33:21] over the last year year and a half now
[1:33:27] time passes real quick sister connie and
[1:33:30] i have been married 38 years
[1:33:32] we just went away for a couple of days
[1:33:34] enjoyed our time away
[1:33:37] and god bless sister connie
[1:33:42] she'll stand by me throughout the
[1:33:43] eternities
[1:33:45] amen as a trophy on my arm
[1:33:48] thank god for giving me sister connie
[1:33:51] [Applause]
[1:33:57] i'm getting ready to celebrate 21 years
[1:33:59] here is your pastor
[1:34:02] i preached since 1984
[1:34:06] but i've never changed
[1:34:09] hopefully i'm a better speaker today
[1:34:11] than i was in 1984
[1:34:15] but i believe this message like the
[1:34:16] dream when i was standing with the
[1:34:18] prophet of god
[1:34:20] and he had a book in his hand the way of
[1:34:22] a true prophet
[1:34:24] and asked me if i'd like to have it so
[1:34:25] i've carried this this
[1:34:27] this in my my my bible ever since the
[1:34:30] dream
[1:34:31] and i stood there before brother branham
[1:34:33] in the dream and i told him i said i
[1:34:34] preach this message with all my heart
[1:34:37] and believe it with everything that is
[1:34:39] within me
[1:34:42] and he patted me on the cheek and he
[1:34:44] said ron you're going to get well
[1:34:59] must understand in the layers of the
[1:35:02] battle of cancer
[1:35:05] when i was attacked obviously satan sent
[1:35:08] his best
[1:35:10] because it would go into the it would go
[1:35:12] into the
[1:35:14] from my eye is what they're saying now
[1:35:16] from my eye
[1:35:18] into my lymph nodes then into my lungs
[1:35:21] and then into my brain
[1:35:23] removing one of the tumors from the
[1:35:25] brain and then using
[1:35:26] uh gamma-ray to to try to destroy the
[1:35:30] rest of the tumors in my brain
[1:35:33] sometimes you go to the doctor and get
[1:35:34] good reports sometimes it's mixed
[1:35:36] results sometimes it gives you difficult
[1:35:38] thoughts
[1:35:39] the other day i got the doctor she's an
[1:35:42] incredible doctor
[1:35:44] she she just gave me some difficult news
[1:35:49] about how my lungs were were filled with
[1:35:52] inflammation and
[1:35:54] and maybe some aggression that's getting
[1:35:56] ready to go on
[1:35:57] a few weeks ago i was awakened in the
[1:35:59] middle of the night in the
[1:36:01] and i heard the voice saying the storm
[1:36:03] is coming
[1:36:05] a storm is coming
[1:36:08] sure god sometimes brings you good news
[1:36:10] sometimes he brings you news to let you
[1:36:12] know
[1:36:13] things are happening when i heard the
[1:36:16] doctor as she began to give she was just
[1:36:18] looking at what she saw
[1:36:20] but i'm looking at what i see
[1:36:26] i'm looking at what i see and i just
[1:36:27] simply told her sister connie's here to
[1:36:30] vouch for that
[1:36:31] i just simply told her you can't give me
[1:36:32] any more chemo that's right
[1:36:34] it's the highest notes that's right i
[1:36:36] said well if it's more cancer it's more
[1:36:38] cancer
[1:36:39] but god's still god
[1:36:44] now i'm not some wimpy little christian
[1:36:46] that you have to baby around
[1:36:50] are you with me i'm not going by my
[1:36:52] feelings whether i have a good day or a
[1:36:54] bad day
[1:36:56] sister connie and i went on our on our
[1:36:59] honeymoon 38th
[1:37:05] and i was up walking the floor to one
[1:37:07] and two o'clock in the morning because
[1:37:08] my body was hurting so bad
[1:37:11] did that make me want to walk to the
[1:37:13] pulpit this morning and give you a pity
[1:37:15] party
[1:37:17] i walked to the pulpit this morning
[1:37:20] looking the devil right square in the
[1:37:22] eye
[1:37:24] and reminding him i'm holding my
[1:37:26] position
[1:37:27] [Applause]
[1:37:31] and i want to encourage you no matter
[1:37:34] what
[1:37:34] fight that you're in no matter where
[1:37:37] you're at in your life
[1:37:39] hold your position
[1:37:44] that's what we do brother johnny
[1:38:00] hallelujah
[1:38:02] so based on that i'm going to i'm going
[1:38:04] to deliver some blows here if it's okay
[1:38:07] i want to get some cannon fire
[1:38:13] isaiah 54 behold i have created the
[1:38:17] smith that bloweth the coals in the fire
[1:38:19] that bringeth forth an instrument for
[1:38:21] his work i have created the waster to
[1:38:23] destroy
[1:38:26] no weapon that is formed against thee
[1:38:30] shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:38:34] shall rise against thee and the judgment
[1:38:36] thou shalt condemn this is the heritage
[1:38:39] of the servants of the lord
[1:38:41] and their righteousness of me saith the
[1:38:44] lord
[1:38:45] this is a quote that brother random
[1:38:47] would quote over and over again
[1:38:49] all powers in heaven and earth is given
[1:38:51] into my hand
[1:38:52] go and i'll go with you i'll be with you
[1:38:55] whatever you bind on earth i'll bond in
[1:38:57] heaven
[1:38:58] whenever you loose on earth i'll loosen
[1:39:01] heaven
[1:39:02] who's going to do that through the power
[1:39:04] of your tongue
[1:39:16] last week we witnessed
[1:39:20] we literally witnessed god in action
[1:39:25] with timothy standing out on the stage
[1:39:28] and he is preaching
[1:39:29] and he said several key statements and
[1:39:32] all of a sudden
[1:39:33] his ipad which is sitting back here
[1:39:42] actually the app actually comes up
[1:39:45] and goes to a certain message and begins
[1:39:48] to play
[1:39:50] we were not in control of that god's in
[1:39:53] control of that
[1:39:55] last night we had an incredible service
[1:39:58] to me it was andrew's finest sermon i've
[1:40:01] ever heard him preach
[1:40:05] and then we went home and in our living
[1:40:07] room the pillar of fire becomes
[1:40:09] visible as a young lady gets a new birth
[1:40:13] to never be the same what we are
[1:40:16] witnessing here
[1:40:17] is jesus among us
[1:40:23] and in the darkness of laodicea he has
[1:40:26] not given up his position
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:33] now i must admit i'm not
[1:40:36] pointing out anybody but there's people
[1:40:39] that can sit on these pews
[1:40:42] it's just another service
[1:40:48] we'll see rose be open when we get out
[1:40:54] somebody had a different dress on her
[1:40:56] somebody had shoes on her
[1:40:59] you know so and so wasn't here
[1:41:06] or this just another time we're just
[1:41:08] here
[1:41:12] and god can do these things and not move
[1:41:14] us
[1:41:16] i would get to an altar as fast as i
[1:41:28] could
[1:41:31] in hebrews chapter 11
[1:41:35] it's going to call some names
[1:41:39] names like noah
[1:41:42] enoch abel
[1:41:46] abraham moses i'm not going to call them
[1:41:49] all
[1:41:51] each of them lived in a generation
[1:41:57] they were put in position to stand
[1:42:08] and we know their names today and they
[1:42:09] fall off of our lips
[1:42:12] so incredibly quick
[1:42:15] but in third day many of them had to
[1:42:17] stand alone
[1:42:20] and they held their position
[1:42:24] the book of acts will continue to be
[1:42:26] written
[1:42:28] our names will be written in the book of
[1:42:31] acts
[1:42:32] brother brown said if given time they
[1:42:34] could write another book of acts behind
[1:42:37] this bribe
[1:42:39] and somewhere ronald dean spencer
[1:42:42] will be written
[1:42:45] your name will be written amen
[1:42:50] are you with me your name will be
[1:42:53] written
[1:42:54] it may not be in the who's who
[1:42:58] but i want my name written in god's book
[1:43:04] as an overcomer of this age
[1:43:10] hebrews chapter 12 which is one of my
[1:43:12] favorite scripture
[1:43:14] wherefore see and we're so cast about
[1:43:16] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:43:18] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:43:21] sin which just so easily beset us
[1:43:24] and let us run with patience the
[1:43:27] race that is set before us
[1:43:30] don't waste your next 24 hours
[1:43:35] your next week your next month your next
[1:43:38] year
[1:43:40] on things that are extremely temporary
[1:43:44] put everything you can all of your
[1:43:47] energies
[1:43:48] towards serving god like never before
[1:43:59] notice the scripture looking to jesus
[1:44:03] because there's no other place to look
[1:44:05] to
[1:44:08] looking unto jesus the author and the
[1:44:11] finisher
[1:44:12] of our faith who for the joy was set
[1:44:16] before him
[1:44:17] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:44:20] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:44:22] throne of god
[1:44:25] i want to share this scripture with you
[1:44:27] or this quote with you
[1:44:29] god's purpose can never be defeated
[1:44:32] that makes me feel like running around
[1:44:34] this building
[1:44:37] i want you to say this with me god's
[1:44:39] purpose can never be defeated
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:45] god's purpose can never be defeated why
[1:44:48] don't you just go ahead and say it to
[1:44:49] yourself god's purpose
[1:44:51] can never be defeated now i want you to
[1:44:54] understand now
[1:44:55] god the devil can't take you off of the
[1:44:58] earth until your purpose
[1:45:00] is finished here on the earth i keep
[1:45:03] reminding the devil no matter how bad
[1:45:05] the doctors report
[1:45:07] god still got purpose in my life
[1:45:14] what about your life
[1:45:20] the neighbor that you will witness to
[1:45:22] the person that you'll go to school with
[1:45:26] how do i witness your life your
[1:45:30] life sounds louder than your words do
[1:45:36] let the life of god so live inside of
[1:45:38] you that create an atmosphere around you
[1:45:41] until your life is so resoundingly great
[1:45:53] life john wesley preached
[1:45:58] 42 000 sermons

[1:46:12] wrote on horseback for the most of it
[1:46:16] fields streets churches
[1:46:19] it didn't matter he preached
[1:46:23] until he was 88 years old william
[1:46:26] carey brother branham speaks of him
[1:46:30] translated the bible into 44
[1:46:34] different languages
[1:46:41] peter cartwright that brother branham
[1:46:44] speaks so much of
[1:46:47] goes into a town and the bully tells him
[1:46:50] you're not going to have a service here
[1:46:52] he held his position and he said you're
[1:46:56] gonna have to whip me first and he said
[1:46:57] well that's the next thing i'll do
[1:46:59] climb down off the ladder roll these
[1:47:01] sleeves up took his coat off
[1:47:03] and whipped the town bully right there

[1:47:23] cartwright held a meeting
[1:47:24] let me just say this year stonewall
[1:47:26] jackson wasn't the only fighter from
[1:47:28] this area
[1:47:29] [Applause]
[1:47:31] hallelujah let us be like c.l lewis
[1:47:35] he said may satan celebrate the day that
[1:47:39] i
[1:47:39] die
[1:47:48] thirty men walked into peter
[1:47:49] cartwright's meeting
[1:47:51] and nobody would confront these men
[1:47:55] they were going to destroy the meeting
[1:47:58] and peter cartwright
[1:48:00] single-handedly with 30 men
[1:48:04] you say well that's absolutely
[1:48:06] impossible you don't understand
[1:48:08] in our family there was a man that
[1:48:11] picked up a dry
[1:48:12] jawbone of an ass
[1:48:19] and he picked it up and he killed over a
[1:48:21] thousand soldiers
[1:48:24] how did he do it one at a time
[1:48:27] one at a time you whip your devil one at
[1:48:30] a time
[1:48:40] one at a time
[1:48:47] now you see the devil's very resilient
[1:48:50] he'll show back up tomorrow
[1:48:51] whip him again he'll show back the next
[1:48:55] day
[1:48:55] whip him again he's going to do his job
[1:48:59] you might as well do yours you might as
[1:49:02] well go ahead and pull your sword
[1:49:05] and give him a good old-fashioned weapon
[1:49:08] hold your position hold it stand your
[1:49:12] ground
[1:49:30] it's more than a good law in florida
[1:49:34] stand your ground
[1:49:39] as a christian you need to stand your
[1:49:41] ground
[1:49:52] god bless you gabriel
[1:49:55] he's going to stand the ground for
[1:49:57] virginia state police officers
[1:50:04] sometimes we act like we're a bunch of
[1:50:05] wimpy christians
[1:50:08] i'm just going to i'm delivering my
[1:50:09] heart today we act like we're
[1:50:11] defenseless
[1:50:13] and we just can't do nothing that devil
[1:50:15] just keeps beating me and he beats me
[1:50:17] and he beats me well you're not doing
[1:50:18] your job
[1:50:20] you're just being lazy he just beats me
[1:50:24] beats me and beats me
[1:50:27] let me just say this to you sister
[1:50:29] hoover laid
[1:50:30] in a nursing home for over nine years
[1:50:36] in a horrible condition she didn't give
[1:50:39] up
[1:50:44] it might have looked like a horrible
[1:50:46] battle but she laid there
[1:50:48] almost as an invalid but she raised her
[1:50:51] banner
[1:50:52] every day that she was a christian and
[1:50:54] this was a place that she went to church
[1:50:58] and at her funeral i don't know how many
[1:51:02] of the people that was from that nursing
[1:51:04] home
[1:51:05] came to this place and heard the gospel
[1:51:07] preached
[1:51:09] and her doctor said she lived the life
[1:51:12] in a nursing home your surroundings
[1:51:18] your circumstances you may not be able
[1:51:20] to control
[1:51:22] but god's greater than your
[1:51:32] circumstances
[1:51:38] hallelujah
[1:51:42] buddy robinson we've actually preached
[1:51:45] in the pulpit where buddy robinson
[1:51:47] preached
[1:51:49] brother brahm talks about him
[1:51:52] he needed god maybe you need god
[1:51:57] maybe you're in a spot in your life to
[1:51:59] worthy you can't go a step forward
[1:52:01] and you need a real god maybe you've sat
[1:52:05] on a pew for years and pretended to part
[1:52:08] hollywood is not hollywood is not the
[1:52:11] only place that has actors
[1:52:16] there's a lot of actors sitting church
[1:52:22] i'm not looking up not looking for your
[1:52:24] expression
[1:52:26] and they act apart and when satan comes
[1:52:30] to tempt them they fall apart
[1:52:38] but if you've got the real goods
[1:52:43] you actually shine under your trial
[1:52:48] did you get that you actually shine
[1:52:52] under your trough
[1:52:56] every hypocrite can shout and praise the
[1:52:59] lord
[1:53:00] when all the bills are paid and your
[1:53:02] health is great
[1:53:05] and your family is in wonderful shape
[1:53:07] but let the devil come to tempt you and
[1:53:09] shake you a little bit
[1:53:14] let him shake you to prove you've got
[1:53:17] the goods
[1:53:21] it's then under your trial that you
[1:53:23] confess
[1:53:24] faith like never before
[1:53:27] it's then that you pull your sword it's
[1:53:30] worthless to pull your sword when
[1:53:32] there's no
[1:53:32] enemy around but when you've got ten
[1:53:35] thousand demons coming against you
[1:53:37] pour your sword you can't lose
[1:53:40] [Applause]
[1:53:49] brother brandon said have faith in god
[1:53:52] oh my how the devil has to recognize the
[1:53:54] supreme
[1:53:55] authority of jesus christ not me
[1:53:58] he hates me he don't have to mind me but
[1:54:01] he has to mind who i represent
[1:54:04] he has the mind who sent me here another
[1:54:07] quote satan
[1:54:08] you who have bound these people you're
[1:54:11] exposed to not
[1:54:12] your grips are lost you have no legal
[1:54:15] authority at all
[1:54:16] jesus christ robbed you and stripped you
[1:54:19] at calvary
[1:54:20] and we come as a church of the living
[1:54:22] god in the name of jesus christ
[1:54:25] i endure you to leave every person in
[1:54:28] the building
[1:54:28] come out of the people thou demons i
[1:54:31] enjoy thee
[1:54:33] i jury thee by the living god
[1:54:36] [Applause]
[1:54:42] that's the way the enemy will do
[1:54:45] if he can see that he's got an upper
[1:54:47] hand
[1:54:48] he'll always proposition you
[1:54:52] but when he's in the corner he's a
[1:54:55] coward

[1:57:32] time he drove up and down the road on
[1:57:34] his delivery van
[1:57:35] he'd look up at this place and
[1:57:37] conviction would still strike him
[1:57:40] listen if god didn't put that seed on
[1:57:42] the inside of him he could have drove by
[1:57:44] this lack of
[1:57:45] hundreds of thousands of other people

[1:58:24] far they go in their life
[1:58:26] that seed still holds
[1:58:47] but the lawrence didn't come back
[1:58:50] because of brother homer
