the word musicians you can stay just for a minute and and um we'll just sing a song after this but I I just want to take a just take a moment real quick and um take take uh some pastorally things here and just kind of speak some things we we have our meeting coming up and uh in in labor day and we're very excited about that and uh we'll be printing out a flyer and putting it on the church Facebook before long and we have those times we're having to adjust our times just a little bit especially on Saturday night just according to the way that the Lord's leading and and so we're just we're going to we'll make you all aware of that all at the same time but I just wanted just to um make this announcement not necessarily he for some of you but not necessarily for you but more or less for for those that might be planning to come in might hear this and we we certainly appreciate everybody that would come in for our meetings and uh but these meetings are for you man when it comes down in all reality these meetings are for you and uh I just want to say something I don't want I don't want anybody that would hear this to ever think that that that I'm we're being rude and don't think it's rude when somebody doesn't offer up their house uh for you to come and stay in it it they're not being rude we are some of the most hospitable people here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and uh it was a standard that was created and started with our former Pastor brother Homer Frasier he started that we didn't we didn't open up our homes and just let anybody and everybody just come in and flood the flood our homes because uh you know every church is different every church is Sovereign in their own way but brother Homer seen some things and we have found it to be a great policy that you keep your homes you keep your homes keep some issues don't have to worry about anything being said about your young people you don't have to worry about anything being said about about yourself you wasn't hospital about those things so don't think that these people ain't rude when you're asking them if they if they could stay if they're asking you if you could stay with them you just telling them that brother Ron and brother Andrew are still carry on the same tradition that brother Homer did and if you would like to be a part of these meetings and you're streaming these meetings and you don't have the money to come that's why the streaming is there if you can't afford a hotel that's why the streaming is there but we want you to come if you're wanting to come we we want you to come and be a part of it and I believe that this meeting will be a great blessing to you and uh I believe that uh I believe that God's got something very great in store and um you know what we Full Gospel Lighthouse is one of the most hospitable people that there is or some of the friendliest people and I'm I'm GL I'm really glad to be a part of this church and to to watch how that you handle yourself and situations

this time to come and open up the word of God over to the Book of Luke chapter 17 in verse 28 amen man we have some things on our heart and want to kind of just follow in the line that we've been in but on last couple weekends on the understanding of sons and just picking up a little bit of inspiration here this later this afternoon and tell you what as a man of God you you study and you prepare and you look over things and make you feel like Jonah sometimes you know like Lord I'd leave you you leave me you know then all of a sudden he comes in and just gives you some inspiration I tell you what I've been in this spot I don't know maybe 10,000 times now but it don't make it no easier you know when when you you're you're you're the one that you got to deliver the word and then all of a sudden then he comes and takes takes all the anxiety away and I tell you what I I sure need the anointing of the Lord I know that some people feel like they can go go without it but I sure need it so amen Luke chapter 17 and verse 28 amen before we read let's just let's just talk to the Lord this afternoon Lord Jesus we come before you tonight lord it's an honor to be able to Bow our heads before you Lord Jesus and to just to know father that you're the god that wrote this word you're the god that speaks you're the god that hears oh God and we just we just now Lord ask that you would come and you would just begin to pour out your spirit Lord as as a man I can take this word I can read it father Lord it takes you to give inspiration father and we just ask Lord that the same word that would Inspire the speaker would Inspire the hearer father I pray God that you would just come across this word tonight and breathe the cross at the very Breath of God and may we begin to watch you as you take your word and minister to your people father father we know God that there's great things that happen when you begin to deliver your word now father I pray that you would forgive us all of our sins our mistakes our failures the things of this life Lord we ask God that you would just put them aside just for a few moments and you just begin to take the word of life and break it to us in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen Luke chapter 17 verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat and they drank and they bought and they sold and they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed also John chapter 6 and verse 44 and I know this this this reading that we're getting ready to take here it's a little bit lengthy but I I want to keep you standing just so you you'll fully I'll I'll have your full attention so so you just bear with us here this evening and don't just let me read it you read it as well amen no man John 6 and44 no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets that they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and ha learned of the father cometh unto me now that not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life I am that bread of life your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die now you got to think this is something they've never been able to partake of they've been feeding on it but didn't realize what they were feeding on he said I am the living bread which cometh down from heaven and if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world now notice what it is his his flesh is his life the Jews therefore strove amongst them saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat and then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you notice just to just to put it out there for you this was his prophetic Ministry except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you shall have no life in you and whosoever who Who whoo eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed and he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father have sent me I live by the father so he that eateth me even shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are de he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernium many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it and when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them do this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the Flesh propit of nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father and from that time many of his disciples went back and walk no more with him we know that that is a sign of the mark of the beast to reject the word of God right there then said Jesus unto the 12 will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and ass sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord so he said we'd like to speak to you tonight on the understanding of sons and the prophet would say in the anointed ones at the end time he said I wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that's happened as perfectly as they are I'm only the one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used it wasn't what I knew it's just what I surrendered myself too that he spoke through it isn't me it isn't what the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these denominations and things of the world will you let will you at this time do it while we pray and I know that's a very familiar scripture to us as as Believers but we recognize and I I think it's very incredible when you begin to measure the magnitude that the message has had on each and every one of us I believe it's I believe it's it's it's uh it's incredible to look at it not only from a a believer's aspect from an unbelievers aspect to think about how the word of God has affected Us in every one of our lives and we recognize that we're either going to be justified or we're going to be classified with either one of the class of groups whether a Believer a makeb Believer or an unbeliever and I know exactly what side that I want to be identified with and I I I believe that I believe that as the prophet would say he said he said where you're standing at now is where you'd be standing at back there when Jesus was here 2,000 years ago that's the class that you'll find yourself and there were many of people that walk with Jesus even Jud even Judas was a was a make believer right all the way up to the end he held the he held the bag he was a treasur he was somebody that was really close but but God knows exactly who is and who is not and there when Jesus is standing here in in John chapter 6 he he's standing there and his own disciples are saying unto him said this is a hard saying and from that time you begin to see that that from that time that men would begin to walk away from Jesus you see you've got to think about this from the aspect that they were setting in as Jews that they were setting in that this was a hard saying because there they've been studying out the levitical priesthood they've been studying out the levitical law and Moses had had gotten a word from the Lord that no man should touch the flesh or touch blood or he would be condemned so here they were and Jesus is standing there and basically G by the words of a natural Man Without understanding Jesus is standing there and he's saying unless you're a vampire you can't you can't be no part of me but Jesus knew that there was some people that was standing there could fully understand what he was talking about because he wasn't talking about something carnal he wasn't talking about his flesh but he was talking about the ministry of the son of man and he knew that somebody was standing right there in the midst of all of them people when 70 of them walked away but Jesus knew that there was going to be 11 of them that would stand right there that was elected and anointed to understand the prophecy he was saying to them that you're literally eating the Prophecies of the son of man you're literally eating you see because you are elected to see these things is because the reason why you see these things we recognize that there's a group of people that God by forn knowledge has opened their eyes of understanding that they can see aren't you thankful that you've got eyesight to see now notice what Paul says in 2 Timothy 2 Timothy and 3 and verse1 14 he says but continue thou in the things which thou Hast learned and Hast been assured of knowing of whom thou Hast learned them you didn't learn this from you didn't learn this from some school you didn't learn this from some theology but Paul is saying these things he said be assured of who you've learned these things you didn't you didn't learn this from a mind of man but you've been feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man because we recognize that all the way back there in the beginning that God had something that in the back part of his mind that he was going to achieve he had a motive that he was going to do he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a son he wanted to be a Healer and he had to express these things because they were on the inside of him but where did you get the understanding to realize that that kind of a God can be handled that that kind of a God wants to be touched that that kind of a God wants to be handled he wants to be understood but there are things about the supernatural that you and I will never understand because because it's simply Supernatural if it was if it wasn't Supernatural it would be natural and we would understand it but I thank God that there's a supernatural element that still leaves us to have faith to believe that that God is still God and I don't have to understand everything that he's doing in my life but I just simply have to believe him and he'll take me all the way through is that right now notice what he said in verse 15 he said and from and that from a child thou Hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise un salvation through faith which is in which is in Christ Jesus he says now notice verse 16 he said all scripture is is given by inspiration of God you study that word out in Inspiration in the Greek it means to it is breathed out all scripture is breathed out by the Breath of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God might be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works and when Jesus is standing there in John chapter 6 he doesn't stand there and explain anything that he has just said unto them he simply just spoke spoke the word and he let it go out and he knew that there was going to be people that would believe him and when when he when he asked him said he said will you also turn away will you also leave me because of these hard sayings but Peter Peter stood up I think it's powerful to recognize that Peter had some Revelation he he had some mistakes but he had some Revelation and maybe maybe you maybe you're in that kind of situation yeah you got some mistakes but Peter had some Revelation you look at Peter's life there's all kinds of turmoil in Peter's life and I I love studying out the the the the the life of Simon Peter and you you find him he gets out of the boat he he was a man that just he was he was kind of on the cuff kind of guy just he just jumped out of the boat whenever he wanted to he was that kind of a guy just did he just did what came to his mind and he stepped out out there on the water and people a lot of people look on Peter's life and think man ain't no way I can identify with that guy I can there's sometimes that I there's sometimes that I I'm out there and I'm thinking Lord is that you out there and he said he said' if it is you bid me to come and he got out there and he started walking on water you know I I feel like sometimes I can identify with some of these characteristics in the Bible and a lot of people look on Peter and they look at him say Well look at that mistake he he lost his faith and he sunk back in the water but I always look on the back side of the story because he had enough Faith to get out of the boat but he also had enough Faith to get back in to step back on the water when Jesus took him by the hand but this time he didn't have his eyes on the water this time he didn't have his eyes on the Wind this time he didn't have his eyes on the problem this time he had a hold of the man's hand that was able to create a power to walk on H2O maybe he didn't understand while he was doing what he was doing but he was a man that was full of Faith Hallelujah and that's one thing that that's one thing you cannot do you cannot explain Faith you cannot explain it and if it could be explained then it would not be Faith but but there we recognize there we recognize that when Jesus starts saying all of these hard sayings he is saying it brother brandom said that he set it to weed down the crowd because there was too many down there with Gideon that fully didn't understand what battle that they were in so Jesus simply said a few of these things and it weeded down the crowd because there were some people that were simply following him just to watch some miracle of Ron Spencer get over cancer or or excuse me or maybe there were some people that was just simply walking around because of the bread and the fishes but there were some people so Jesus said some hard things so he begin to separate by the word of God and he found out where their allegiance was there was some people that was walking with him because they thought that he was going to over ever return Jerusalem and be a general and they were going to fight for him but they didn't understand that he was raising up a different type of Gentile Warrior he didn't explain himself he just simply he just simply said it and he just said it and there was some people there that believed it now there's some things that there's some things about the Bible that I could have I'm going to have to tell you I don't fully understand all those things I'm about to tell you there's some scriptures in here that maybe I don't fully understand but I believe that if I need to understand it then God will give me understanding for it I believe that there's some things in there that were laying to the Jews over there in Revelation 11 that they're not our that are not pertaining to me but I don't need that I don't need that them Jews need that but there is going to be two prophets rise up and preach to them their message and they'll have an understanding of where they are but there's some things in the scripture that you can that you can identify brother Andrew I've read them things over and over again and I fully don't understand all that's laying in there well I'm I I'm just here to tell you you don't have to understand everything just as long as you believe it's in there is that right I there's a saying that goes out I don't know I don't understand how a brown cow eats green grass drinks Clear Water produces yellow butter and gives out white milk I don't understand it but I have tasted of the substance of it and I know that it's good I can't understand how he goes through the process I can't understand how a cow eats grass all day eats salad all day ends up weighing 1100 lb and my wife wants me to eat salad all the time I can't understand it but I know that I've tasted of some milk and I have tasted of some honey in this book and maybe I don't fully understand everything that's laying in here but I know if it's for me it's for me in my house and if it's for me in my house then God will bless Hallelujah some things you just simply got to take God at his word and walk right on out there I know what I'm talking about cuz I've tasted of it is that right I don't want to be one of those naysayers I don't want to be one of those people that was murmurers and complainers that got right up there to the promised land and they looked out there and they could almost taste The Grapes of that land but they didn't go on I want to be somebody that maybe I don't understand maybe I don't maybe I don't know how I'm going to cross the river maybe I don't understand how Jericho's going to come down maybe I don't understand how I could speak to a son and a son would stand still but I still want to have the faith that if Joshua could do it then I can do it maybe I don't understand why this one's going this way and that one's going that way but God give me the faith to stand here like a soldier in the army of the Lord [Applause] Hallelujah brother maram said that when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he has isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus he said now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into a rapturing condition when you get past Humanity or when man gets past the understanding of humanity then they're getting into bride material I I tell you what I get sick and tired of people trying to ask explain this to me and explain that to me I'm going to tell you there's going to have to be some things that God's going to have to reveal to you because if I can explain it to you then the devil can rob it from you but if it's a real genuine Revelation from the Throne of God hallelujah you may not know how to write your own name in English but if you got a revelation from God on he's the kind of God that owns a cattle on a thousand hills if you got an understanding that he's that kind of a God that he healed George EOD and he still heals me if you got that kind of understanding that he comes and he releases people from their bonds and their chains then you've got the understanding that he can do it right here in the midst of the Church of the Living God and I I just I I will say it's a paradox it's a paradox but it's true it's incredible but it's true ain't nobody ain't nobody since the day that that Joshua standing there in Joshua 10 stopped the Sun the Bible said that nobody's done it since his time you imagine what them people on the other side of the Earth was thinking what have we done wrong surely we have sinned the sun has not sh they must have been living up there in Alaska and the sun ain't shine for 24 hours you imagine but somebody had a need somebody had a need of a light somebody had a need because their enemy was after them and they needed a little bit more time to chase their enemy down I want to say this to you as the Church of the Living God there's a man that can turn on the light maybe you need a little bit more time maybe you need a little bit more inspiration it's incredible but it's true it's true you're not standing here under the mind of a man but you're standing here under the hour the son of man is being revealed you're sitting in the same spot that Paul and Peter were sitting at that they knew Christ by Revelation Paul never knew Jesus In the Flesh and if we go a little bit further Peter didn't even know Jesus In the Flesh well he walked with him brother Andrew sure did but he didn't know who he was until he got a revelation from Heaven saying that thou art the Crist the son of the Living God so Paul was in the same spot that Peter was in and it took Hallelujah it took a paradox to show him to knock him off of his high horse where he thought he had an understanding a I feel like a hillbilly preacher today but he knocked him off of his high horse and he set himself right hey some people hallelujah I'm going back to preaching but it was a paradox that Paul caught the Revelation but he did it's a paradox that you caught the revelation of what this message said but it happened it's here it's in the room it's incredible but it's true hallelujah it's a paradox really it is when you begin to think you begin to think about any of these little boys ain't little no more everybody's little from up here standing at this spot but but you can imagine can you imagine me telling a story about Teddy over here going and astonishing all the philosophers at JMU and emu I believe he could do it I just be de honest with you I just be real hon I probably didn't choose the right one probably should have chose me at 12 years old only thing I was astonishing at that moment was my mom that I was able to keep white sneakers white at that time but could you imagine you know what I'm talking about a 12-year-old boy standing in front of philosophers and wise men and theologians standing out there and astonishing them by his teachings it's it's incredible but it was true because you see if you would know this boy you would think man that guy that guy has really been through some schooling or something he but he never did get no schooling like the rest of them guys had got like the Sadducees and the Pharisees had got but he simply had a school from above because he was the one that wrote the world he was the one that spoke the world into existence so he was able to give them an understanding that they didn't have Hallelujah but he was standing there and his own his own Earthly mother which was the incubator that was a carrier of the Jean seed of God when she come down there she said Jesus where' you been at I know none of y' boys ever heard your mama talk like that she said me and your father have you for three days with tears brother random said that she be to deny her own testimony right there because she knew that Joseph was not Jesus's father come on somebody but she be to deny the very testimony the very Supernatural testimony that she had had you see if Jesus would have been Joseph's son he'd have been down there building a table or working in a carpenter shop but he said I must be about my father's business business what was his father's business his father's business was this word of God and that's the same thing that the church world has done they've denied the supernatural birth the Pentecostals have took it by speaking in tongues but they denied the birth of the word that's exactly what they did but Jesus maybe Mary wasn't positive about it but Jesus was positive who he was I'll say it like this that any man or any believer any preacher has got to be trained and he's got to be sure and has got to be trained to a positive sound to a positive message somebody's got to know and God is always going to have somebody that knows who they are they're they're positive let me say it like that they're positive of their position just like the three Hebrew children when they were getting ready to be thrown into that fiery furnace you they could smell the smoke but they was not going to bow down to some image that had been made by man but God was waiting to watch their reaction to this reaction they were placed there as sons in the midst of Babylon but God was watching them to see how that they would react to the issues of life as sons of God and he looked out upon them and said them's my sons how did he know that they was his sons because the language of the father was in his sons said we will not bow to some man-made image that's why Sons and Daughters of God do not bow down and kiss kiss the feet of some statue we don't Bow Down and Worship some Mary or some statue over I was standing in Belgium I was walking through the streets of Brussels where the very first two Martyrs in the Dark Ages were standing and they gave their life for Christianity and right around the corner there was a bronze statue that people still believe is Supernatural and they go in there and they lay their hands on that BR that bronze on that bronze statue and they said they've done had to replace that statue so many times because people going in there and worshiping a false idol because people would go in there kiss it off and they kiss off its leg and they touch it by the hand and they would believe certain things I tell you one thing I ain't never had to replace my God hallelujah what did them three Hebrew always have they had a language their language was not of The Condemned but their language was was that of the redeemed therefore they had an understanding of redemption as being from the father let me go on just a minute here let me just maybe just transition you look when you begin to study out in Exodus 12 and you begin to look at the Exodus that the father would literally over his household his household he would literally take the authority of Moses on what the prophet had said and he would simply take what the prophet said and he would apply it by faith because we recog recognize that in that hour that the father was the priest of that home now the Bible said here in second Corinthians and 6 he said now verse 14 he said be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship ha righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath the light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with b or what part ha he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement ha the temple of God with Idol for you are a temple of the Living God as God have said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from amongst them and be separate sayith the Lord and touch not the uncan thing and I will receive you oh my how many wants to be received by Jesus and I will receive you and I will be a father unto you and you shall be my son Sons and Daughters saith the Lord Almighty the thing that literally separated Israel from Egypt was the blood it was the literal thing that separated them and made them different there were some Egyptians that looked apart as the Israelites but the thing that made the difference was the blood I want to just maybe just build a thought right here on the father that notic that when Paul is laying out this letter here to the Corinthians and he says I will be a father unto you and that you shall be my sons saith the Lord Almighty I just want to reflect right here on this moment real quick that you are the children of the Living God and you have the maker of heaven and Earth as your father and as your friend as Jeremiah would say in Jeremiah 31 at the same time sayith the Lord will I the God of all the families of Israel and they shall be my people Revelations 21-7 says he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son there's one thing that I enjoy I enjoy I enjoy being a father to two little girls but I can't imagine what what it is for God God for us to for him to watch us as Sons and Daughters of god notice when Paul is writing this out that Paul uses this word in the Greek pantor and it's only used in here in the letter of Corinthians and only used when John when John is the was is is the Scribe for the Book of Revelations it's only used here and that word pantor it signifies that God is all ruling he is absolute and he and and he is is absolute he is Sovereign and he is the almighty and he is the omnipotent one it literally means he who has all power and it is applied to God in contrast from Idols that are Weak and Powerless so there is nobody that can have this title of the almighty the omnipotent in one the one that holds all power in heaven and in Earth only this title can go to almighty God come on somebody some man cannot have that title some Bishop cannot have that title some preacher cannot have that title but almighty God that spoke the worlds into existence he roded them off of his fingertips and he allowed them go out there for millions of years and it would stop it in its existence this Almighty one Paul is saying he is your father hallelujah what is your situation to the almighty God what is your problem what is your situation what is your sickness your situation is not greater than your predestination Hallelujah this Almighty one is all powerful it reminds me that when when the prophet is over there in India and he's there and he's going to the meeting and there's a man he sees this man and he's carrying this Idol in his hands he's carrying this idle in his hand he's walking down through there and brother Bam gets out of the car and goes down there and starts talking to him he said now why do you carry that he said well my father carried this Idol he said and my father he said one day he was he was out there and a lion came out upon him and he stuck this he he stuck this he stuck this Idol out in front of that line and and he built a fire and the lion ran away the prophet said look he said it wasn't he said it wasn't that little Idol he said it was that fire because a lion scared the fire he said if you'll see Jesus Christ as a living resurrected savior will you throw down your idol he said well we carry this just in case amoya doesn't show up you see he was packing something that his daddy had had for years and years and years and how many times do people St up and they carry things in their past they carry things from their from their past of things that they that their daddy dealt with that they Mama dealt with I'd say it's time that you trade your misinformation for Revelation I'd say it's time that you throw down your Idols throw down your Traditions throw down what you think God is what you think you've got to deal with the rest of your life I don't even care if it's religion if it's a complex throw that thing down if it's a stigma throw that thing down come on somebody if it's sickness if it's torment if it's Earthly diseases or if it's a spiritual warfare I love when brother randam is standing there he starts taking us through India the Indian report and he goes through there and and I I'll be honest I love studying those things out and you start hearing about those things that that the Lord did right there and he people that were crosy people that were people that were paralyzed people that were bound to Wheelchairs and people that you remember the story about the man that was led like a dog by a chain of fair and there when brother bandam had that Vision it was time for a showdown much like a much like a showdown of two two backsliding preachers that were going to try to expose this message for being wrong is that right it was a showdown just like that and there the Lord showed up he said now if God will heal this boy I ain't got time to go through the whole thing but if God will heal this boy will you throw down your idols and serve the Living God William brandom said it was like the greatest dust storm that you ever did see when men threw down their Idols I'd say let's cause a dust storm of creating throwing down our doubt throwing down our fear throwing you're not an unbeliever you're not an unbeliever you're not a skep you forgive me I'm going to lay right here you're not a disbeliever you've not misinterpreted the word of God you're not a skeptic you're not a Critic you would have never got in the building that way that's just a devil lying to you trying to make you think you are a skeptic make you think you're that kind of thought throw that thing down Hallelujah and he will be a father unto you the prophet said in Christ of mystery he said but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man so when Adam falls in the Garden of Eden he walks out with his eyes wide open because of his wife showing a type of Christ what did the father do he provided a way back for fellowship with the father again that even when you have went past the promises God provides a way for you maybe I'm crazy but I just happen to be one of them guys that believe as long as you got air in your lungs that I'll never give up hope on you maybe I'm crazy but I believe that that that that no man is past the point if God still got his eye on him I believe that you can get into such a spot that God will literally deal with you and I believe that almighty God can search for you search for you and find you because you didn't find him he found you and if he found you surely he can find them it might beyond your understanding but he that kind of a God now notice what the Bible said in Exodus 12: 13 I got to hurry and the blood shall be unto you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land so we recognize that God required a token and when the token was on the door it was a sign whether it was whether it was Rahab or whether it was the Israelites it was a sign that the fair had been paid look at your neighbor and said I've got the token the token is none other than the life of Jesus Christ now you know good and well if you're going to ride on a train you got to have a ticket in your hand it's your token ain't nobody on that train going to stand there and tell you you're going to have to go surround some curves sometimes you're going to have to go around some tunnels sometimes you going to go through some dark spots let me let me put it in my terms the journey ahead of you on this train it might be dark and it might be lonely and it might be bumpy but I want you to tell I want to tell you it's paid for it's paid for you might feel like you're lost you might maybe you might feel like you're forsaken you might feel like you're all alone but I want you to know and remind you you're not alone in this battle stop trying to fight your battles all alone but he's the kind of God that said that I will be before you and I will be behind you I'll be your head and I'll be I'll be your defense I'll be your buckler let God fight your battles now notice when there they were they were applying the blood to the door it didn't tell them to apply it on the floor but apply it on the Lyal of the door so that everybody can see it pled over there and the rest of the world thought it was foolishness but it was the only way that they were going to escape death but what a time and what a privilege that we're living in that we have the opportunity to to to possess and to pack the very token life of Jesus Christ I say it like the prophet said it's a positive token they no make belief about this token everybody knew that the lamb had been slain when you had the blood upon your door your neighbor saw it your best friend saw it your enemies saw it everybody saw that the token was there what was it a sign of that a lamb had died so that you could go free and that's a same way with the message of the hour that there has been a token life of Jesus Christ that has been released in this hour that the Holy Ghost is a positive token that a lamb died for you and you receed that token and when you got the Holy Ghost as the token life of Jesus Christ there is no make belief there is no put on there is no impersonation it is there you know it the devil knows it the world knows it because the token is there I can tell you what I what I remember as a son I remember feeling him pulling on me brother Joel I could I could literally I could literally go back to the moments in my life and literally feel him pulling on my heartstrings and still understanding that I was lost in my terminology I was lost lost I was saved 2,000 years ago but I literally knew that if he came for me in those hours that I wouldn't be in where in the shape that I needed to be in but I can literally go back to the moments in my life point back to the moments when he was literally drawing me literally drawing me by the power of His presence he was drawing me you know that that that as a child you you get worried you get worried sometimes has a rure already had I ain't heard Mom and Dad snoring just for a little bit you go down the stairs you check on them make sure they're still alive lay your hands on them found out you don't need do CPR and the Rapture is not taking place and you go back up you know what I'm talking about you get nervous but you know the power of the inspiration when you don't have that fear no more upon you that Satan can no more no longer torment you he can't war with your mind he can't war with your spirit because you know you know let me put it to you like this when you know that the blood is applied you can dance around on the inside you can shout around on the inside you can scream all you want to in the inside you can run down the pews run down the aisles as long as you know that the blood's on the door you can shout you can scream you can have Victory you can have Liberty I'm free from my past I'm free from the death angel I'm free from drugs I'm free I don't have to deal with that no more I'm [Applause] free Hallelujah I'm free from my past I'm free from my mistakes I'm free from carnality I'm free from spiritual bondage I'm free from it the prophet said in Israel and the church in 1953 he said he said you could literally the hounds or the the Wolves could come howling at the window and you knew you were safe you could hear the screams of Egypt and you knew you were safe the prophet said he said I can see them Egyptian girls them Egyptian girls going down there walking up to the window and say Martha aren't you coming down to the dance tonight and she speaks back and says no I don't have no desire to go back to the prom no more I don't have no desire to go back there because I know as long as long as I'm on the inside of this token I'm safe I don't have the desire of Egypt I don't have the desire of leot to see you let me put it in my own hillbilly Kentucky and hillbilly Virginia excuse me hillbilly Virginia ways why do I need to go down to the proma dance when I can dance behind this token [Applause] I I'm I'm being I'm being honest why do why do I need to go down brother Homer would say why do I need to go down there to Good Time Charlie why do do why do I need to go down there and enjoy just an enticement for a little bit of time when I can stand up here and dance for the Lord I know that I'm safe in doing it hallelujah how much more does he give you a liberty to know that you're not going to die with the rest of the Egyptians I'm going to read this to you because I believe that there's one thing that has been Tak taken away from our society that fatherhood has been broken fatherhood has been broken and that has been stolen away from people where daddies don't know how to be daddies no more look at the statistics of men and look at the statistics of children that grew up in a home that had a father figure there and watch where they are just go study out the statistics of how they got in inv involved in drugs and now they got involved in jail and did it doesn't matter what color race they are find out if they had a father figure there and find out where the source came from what's up brother Andrew I didn't have a father in my life you do now I had a father that beat me brother Andrew you ain't got a father like that now you got a father that'll never beat you you got a father that'll never whip you you got a father that'll never leave you you got a father that'll never forsake you you got a father that is not an abusive God come on somebody you got the kind of father that won't take you out and string you out on drugs but this father will take you to the healing veins of Jesus he said the father was the priest of the house in the old sanctuary in the old time he said the father was the priest he had to watch over his household what a change today the kids watch over the dad in the modern world but the father was to watch over his house he killed the lamb he took the hiss up and put it on the doors on the lentil and that was their protection all right they stayed in he said I can see the rest of them frolicking and carrying on saying look at that bunch of Fanatics oh with an old sheep Blood on the door trying to make some say this Hocus Pocus something's going to happen but it did why because God said so it was the truth When God says so and there they are under that blood they had no desire to go out as brother Joe Green says that I drink all I want to I smoke all I want to now y'all know good and well y'all know brother Joe Green's quote he said because the want to has been taken away from me you see they had no more desire to go out there you say desire that's right for there is therefore now no condemnation to them that's come in at the door to think that the son knew he had an understanding that behind that blood behind that blood was his safety zone now notice this lamb was to be supposed to be kept up for 14 days of the month for there and notice and verse six and you shall keep it up under the 14 day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening the whole assembly so it wasn't just laid on the pope it wasn't just laid on the preachers but it was laid on the whole congregation and the lamb was kept up for 14 days let me put it like this the lamb was kept up in the dark ages the lamp was kept up the lamb was kept up in Luther's day the lamb was kept up in Wesley's day the lamb was kept up in in Pentecost but now we recognize that the token life of Jesus Christ is here the lamb the very life of the Lamb has returned back to the believer oh was it they were eat this lamb they were to eat this lamb they were to burn it with fire they're not just supposed to take half the book they were supposed to take the whole book they were supposed to take the legs they were supposed to take the head and they were supposed to take it in there and they were supposed to roast it with fire and the Bible said don't eat it raw don't eat it Soden it says don't eat it raw don't eat it Soden it all with water but roast it with fire now I know I know that you know these things but you know you see notice there's powerful things when you study these things out don't eat it raw don't eat it half don't eat it halfway cooked the reason why is because the Egyptians when they would go to worship their gods they would worship they would worship and they would eat meat and it would be raw or half or half or half cooked so God is saying unto them that these Egyptians these Egyptians that worship almost the same way it looks the same way that your worship cannot look like the Egyptians you've got to burn it with fire that that you've got to literally burn out the life of that lamb you've got to burn out the life of that lamb until all of it is completely roasted with fire but the problem of it is is too many times people don't have enough fire in their experience they don't have enough fire in their experience to get this lamb word good and hot get it good and hot if you get this lamb word good and hot it'll burn out sin it'll burn out your problems it'll burn out your game boys it'll burn out your PlayStations it'll burn out your habits don't water it down don't water it down don't bull it don't boil this lamb don't water it down when you water down wine what do you do you're taken away from the effect and when you water down this lamb message you're taking away from the power of the Lamb's message but eat the whole lamb don't you delute don't you dilute this message by your own mundane experiences don't you do it don't water it down but eat the whole lamb eat the head eat the foots eat the intestines eat all of it I know it's going to cause some problems when you start eating this when you start eating all of this your friends are going to look at you differently your problems are going to look at you differently your situations are going to look at you differently why because you're eating the lamb it look crazy to the rest of the world but they was up there and the rest of the world was mocking them and making fun but when the Midnight Hour came and the Death Angel come whirling down through those streets it may have looked crazy to them but the blood was on the door the Lamb's life had been slain and it didn't make sense but their problems knew that they couldn't touch them no more oh Hallelujah that's why the prophet would say show the devil your token take your token and it over your household and show the devil what' you show up at church for today brother Andrew I showed up to show the devil whose side I'm on you didn't give me last week you didn't give me last year you didn't give me 10 years ago I'm still [Applause] here men have ridiculed you men have made fun of you men said you never made make it but the lamb said you're worth dying for you could go free from [Applause] it Hallelujah I'm I'm just I'm I'm I'm coming I'm going to close with this scripture go ahead and stand with with me Hallelujah Isaiah 40 and 28 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fth not neither is weary there's no searching of his understanding verse 29 he give power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord they that wait upon the Lord they that wait upon the almighty they that wait upon Elohim shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with e wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint you may have been bruised but you're still standing you may have been attacked but you're still here I may be weak but my my weakness is only my strength in him come on somebody I'm not counting on me I'm not counting on my own life Moses was only Moses to them but the lamb was the power to get them all out of Egypt come on somebody you don't have enough power to get yourself out of the building tonight but there's a power that will renew your strength I want to say this by the inspiration of the Lord lift up those hands that once held down lift up your head lift up your voice now I understand this by being your pastor you have been through what we would call hell on Earth for the past couple weeks am I right am I right I done heard it from everybody you might as well testify you have been through some stuff for the past couple weeks weeks I want to tell you why that is it's because you are in a season of blessings and Satan is trying to rob the manifestation of the son of man coming to your house I want to say to Satan reverse the curse it's my hour I may have been wounded but I am not forsaken I may have been Afflicted but I am not defeated I may have been down but I am not out I may have took a licking but I'm still ticking I'm still here to prove I'm on The Winning Side well if you're getting tired of losing life Wars come on baby help me sing it that's you number one baby help her sing it you you know it by heart don't you she's without understanding just a minute but we'll
