so um I'm not brother Ron Brother Andrew brother Donnie brother Daryl brother Wayne I'll just I I told Brothers while AG go I said listen I'll put you to sleep and I'll be gone before you know I'm I'm gone so I hope you brought your little your mats and your pillows so getting into the word now um if you have your Bibles I'll just give a little a teaching lesson here tonight if that's okay we'll turn to John we're going to read John 1 and one and then we're going to jump down to 10 through 14 now you will find that out I will not bring anything to you that you haven't heard before I don't search for new things if it ain't in the word message of the hour you're not getting it so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God those are some of the most profound words that you will ever hear in the Bible amen beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God he was in the world and the world jumped down number 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor by the will of man but of God these were born of God and you'll see we'll get into that later on the meaning of that and the word was made flesh I want to bring out the the thing that we're going to title after was the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory in the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's bow our heads Heavenly Father how wonderful it is Lord to sit around your word Lord we believe we're in the last days we believe we're at the door father and and every time that we can come together father to send under your word to get us that extra push Lord to make it through that door to take a Rapture Lord we know that this the the the bride already has the wedding dress on she has already been called Miss Jesus Christ Lord but we're coming in we com in on Saturdays and Sundays and Wednesdays Lord and we come in so that we could tighten that dress up make sure every lace is tied every button pulled together father every Stitch tied perfectly CU Lord you the ible says father that you're coming for a bride that is without spot or wrinkle and Lord tonight we're we're as as it were we're going to iron things out we're going to make sure there's no wrinkles Lord we're going to this word has been sent to us as a magnifying glass as it were father to to check our lives out so tonight father as you the put the magnifying glass of your word over us tonight father if you would see anything that is not there your Prophet said we will leave either better or worse there's not one person here Lord that will stay the same in this service tonight they will either receive or reject so Lord we pray that your spirit would come anoint those to receive what they have need of Father there's nothing I can do father for them Lord there's so many needs we heard the prayer requests Lord we know the needs of our our brother Ron we know the needs father we know it's a finished work in your hand but Lord there's nothing that we can do father within ourselves because these are things that you've allowed upon us for some reason you said just trust and believe father there's nothing that I can give them only that the promise father that you said it was in your word we believe in you for it Bless the people Lord get me out of the way father there's nothing I can do I can read these words on these notes read these scriptures father and unless you come that's all they'll be so we invite you Lord we welcome you Lord this is your time our time no longer matters right now this belongs to you in Jesus name amen you can be seated in John 1:14 it it says the word was made flesh that word made means to become so we're talking about God becoming so the title that I have tonight and this is something I've had this for months Lord and it's a song I heard heard a song what called the song was called I am becoming and so this really just sat on my heart for a long time and then you know I put down notes and then all this week every day this week just about I've been putting notes down this things that the Lord's given me and the title is are you becoming amen God had to go through a process God had to put himself through a process to become flesh he didn't have to you know we we we we look at this it said made to become to to come into being to happen to be made to be done Marvin Vincent translates this as the meaning of that that Greek word to means Co come into being manifestation implying motion movement or growth that is used for God's actions as emerging from eternity and becoming in time physical space that's right amen so we know through the the message of Malachi 4 that we were told that in the beginning God was was not even God there was no one to worship him right I I I read it in another place just today that brother bam said there wasn't a God he wasn't God right he was alone yeah you know when I got to studying this and and I when when I got to studying this I thought you know what look at what God put himself through right yeah look what he put himself through that's right this is God becoming right and if God expects himself to go into the process of becoming why would he not expect that from us yes sir come on so we look at what God put himself through to condescend right God condescend so you could become Eternal right you could be lifted up he went to the lowest of lows so you could go to the highest of highs so we see God in his creation and he creates a man in his own image we brother brandom tells us and the scripture tells us that that that image was spirit that was God's image was spirit and then he created from the dust of the earth he created man he created Adam yeah but this is what this is not what God wanted for himself amen this was just a start of the process right you know looking at at at this and you know what well I'll hold off on that I'll get to it in a minute and brother BR says in Investments God coming down to become man to die God could not die as a spirit so he had to create a man he had to create a type we know Adam was a type amen God could not die as a spirit he could not die he's Eternal God could make himself in such the way as he could feel pain this is God becoming that's right he could make himself so he could he could feel and suffer God could not suffer as the eternal spirit but when he became man he could suffer right yes sir you'll notice I I wash the clock a lot because I'm not a long speaker here when he became man he could suffer and feel the pain and The Temptations that man went through like Adam and Eve in the Garden in everyone's sense he had to become that he had to become suffering he had to become pain right he had to become everything you feel what pushed God to do this come on now what would push God to make him desire to go through suffering this is the desire of God yes sir he had to become that to fulfill his own law that's right to take upon himself his own law good that's right he knew you couldn't live the law that's right you you couldn't live the law that's right come on so God took the law upon himself he beat himself with his own law Lord he could not have been the third person he could not have been the second person he could have been nothing else but the person right in other words he couldn't put somebody else in his place that's right Adam couldn't took his place that's right come on and don't let just stumble you mezc couldn't take his place you know we see God take this plan that he's got and it looks perfect everything is in order right we look at the Garden the the animals are getting along the The Lion and the the the lamb and everything and everything is peace and it looks like God has created something perfect but then something happened that God must have forgot about somebody snun in and God didn't know about it come on come on God's plan fell apart and he didn't know why come on right God knew what he was doing that's right God knew that this was going to fall apart you know when I was studying this I got to thinking one day but Andrew why why couldn't God just created Jesus Christ right then why couldn't God speak the very sales that he spoke into Mary that's right yeah the very sales why couldn't he done that in the beginning when he spoke life into the garden why couldn't Perfection come right off the bat right you and I could have been spoken word people living in Perfection you realize if God had allowed you and me to be spoken word we would have never known the real true God thank you Lord we would have never known who he was we would have never known that he's a savior we would have never known that he's a Healer we would have never known that he delivers but there's something in God God that had a desire to show that and he was willing to let everything he had fall apart he was willing to just let it all here Satan you're going to have it good cuz I got a greater plan when you get that moment you think God has forgot you when he said let there be you were in his mind you've been there ever since and you've never left right he had a perfect picture of you amen a perfect picture of you and it's never left his mind that perfect picture of you is what gave him the desire to let everything fall right amen he knew that was the only way that you and him would come together I got to let everything fall because they're going to need a savior they're going to need a redeemer they're going to need a Healer so it looks like God plan is falling apart but God's falling apart plan fell right into his plan you think God would you what do you think God was thinking when he's sitting there watching this you know he's had this what brother Brenham called a conference brother Bram said he had a conference there in the garden under the tree with Adam and Eve and The Serpent and he tells the serpent her seed will bruise your head that's what you're doing when you overcome that's you you are her seed when you overcome you're bruising his head amen yes sir that was part of God's plan that's right so God you know I wondering what God is watching all of this is he's he's watching Adam leave the garden Adam died that day Adam and Eve died that day you know is the the Bible tells us in case you're wondering about that statement I'm sure most of you know I know who your pastor and your preachers are but to God is a thousand years and from that day you know who knows how many millions of years Adam and Eve lived until then amen so when God says the day you eat thereof that day you die and they no longer live past that time so he had to watch this fall apart he had to watch sin after sin come upon his creation people he loved when you look at you you look at the people through the Bible how Noah and Moses and David and Solomon and all that how sin crept into their lives David being the apple of God's eye and God had to watch the the one that he loved in his mind that he was perfect and he had to watch him become an adulterer had to watch him become a murderer he had to watch worship gods that that were not him put up graven images in all these creation after him started worshiping things and given praise That was supposed to go to God right and God had to watch that year after year and thousands of years and thousands of years and God is watching his plan fall all to pieces but God is becoming right oh yeah God says my becoming is not done yet right it's not finished when Christ came and Christ died on the cross God's becoming wasn't done right it wasn't finished at Calvary come on I don't want to jump ahead there sorry about that this was God's creating in order for him to understand how you feel the Bible says he was as tempted in all things he went through all things that that any of us could go through but he had to become you God had to become you the prophet tells us that that he became you so you could become him by Christ in John 1 and12 as it says but as many received him gave them power to become sons of God it did not say that he just made them sons of God it didn't say he made them sons of God he gave them power to become sons of God you have that power in you brother brandham said when God all the power that God had he said you look at all the planets all the stars and the millions and light years beyond that and the galaxies beyond that and God created it with one word he said that same power is in you the same power that God had when he said let there be he put in you this is God becoming God is giving his power he gave him power to be sons of whe there's people that have power sons of God that probably got that seed in them they don't know it yet you didn't know it yet you had power from the the minute you took your breath of life if you're a SE son and daughter of God and you are about predestinated bride of Christ when you took your first breath the power that God had to create was put in you that was God becoming right but as many has received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name that believe on his name that's a simple as that it ain't what you sacrifice it ain't it ain't how many hell marries you say it ain't it ain't the works that you do you got people searching after works and all this I got to do this I got to do that I got to you got to have signs I got to have this they're chasing signs and wonders signs and wonders are supposed to be following you they they belong to you yes you should have them on a leash you shouldn't be hunting them down and chasing them down you already have them that comes with the power that he put in you but God wanted you to have his nature you couldn't become what God wanted you to become you couldn't become without his nature right that's what how Satan has has done denominations and I'll bring it home that's how he's done in the message now come on now you got people becoming without his power that's right so they can't become they're becoming their own thing right Amen brother brand said there's only two Spirits at work two not three there's not you God and Satan but brother Bram said there's only two Spirits at work it's God or the devil it's either of God or it's of the devil so you got people becoming something else that's not God that's right push play is not becoming of God that's right God does not work in that way that's right God works in a five-fold ministry that's right that tells you about the power that you have in you but we've got to the the place in in our own message in our own ranks that people are they're coming up with their own thing we don't need the prophet no more you're either on this side that you you got to have only the prophet or you're on this side you don't need him there there's no becoming right you're in a ditch either way that's right you're in a ditch either way right that ain't in there I don't know where that's from or we but that ain't in there but so there's a process of becoming that's right so everything God had done up to now and the future that was in his mind before the foundation of the world had you in mind that's right amen Hebrews chapter 6 brother Bram said he become kin folks that he might rise you up raise you up before he could raise you up he has to give you eternal life that's part of you becoming and the deal about it is we try to become ourselves he says he'll do it for you right this is him giving you the power this is him raising you up before he could give you that power he has to raise you up that's right cuz what what are we we're born in sin saved in iniquity came into the world speaking Lies We didn't even know that power existed we didn't even some of us probably didn't even know there was a God right right part of God's plan was not that you know who he was from the minute that you took your breath amen there's some things in your life you'd probably rather not remember I there's a lot of things in my life i' I'd rather not remember but God says part of your becoming is I'll take that out I'll I'll deliver you of that back you don't have to live with that and Satan tried to beat you down with that with your past I I I preached a message some several months ago or last year the bride making herself ready and you know it came to me while I was putting this together that Satan tells you so many times because we know what the wedding dress is the wedding dress is the word right Satan tells you your past tells you your past tells you you'll never put that wedding dress on you won't fit it you've got too much baggage in your life you got too many things in your life that you can't get rid of you got too many besetting sins in your life you'll never get this word on there's people that think they have to get their life right before they even come to the altar they think they have to get their life right before they give the heart to God I can't come to God like this that's the way God wants you to come to him you can't take it off yourself part of the becoming process is laying there and letting God do it for you you can't take your sins off you can't take anything off of yourself that's God's grace to you it says Grace like we said earlier you couldn't live the law the law tells you if you do this you die that's right if you do this you die it don't matter you're going to die anything you do by law you're going to die if we had to live by the letter of the law and God pass judgment on us right now who in here would still be left be an empty church it'd be empty but here come Grace here come Grace you don't realize how much God wanted to give you Grace that is one of the main ingredients in you becoming is Grace without God's grace it'll never happen it will never happen so one of the ingredients of of becoming his grace you know I got to y'all know who Philip's Craig and Dean is and many years ago they wrote this song called Mercy came running I don't know why I'm going this way so I like I like to know how people got certain songs that's right amen and you know they're all three pastors good Christian guys for what I understand one guy said he he wrote this song said he was sitting in church and he was in church and he was listening to the preacher talk about mercy and he said Mercy was there all along you was living in sin you were so dirty right you know when you look at the big spectrum of things when you look at brother brandom said all our sins was was dumped on Jesus God left him in the garden hey I'm taking a tangent I'm known for him so bear with me Jesus is in the garden brother brandom said God left him in the garden because no sin your sin was getting ready to be put on him and no sin will touch a holy God right so God leaves him in the garden you think when I sit and think all that I've done and he was willing to take some of the foul things that I done brother Andrew thank you Lord Lord put on me father let me have it everything bad filthy foul that you've done in your life God smeared it into him pushed it into him all the while this is Mercy he said Mercy was put so hard against that Veil trying to push out screaming to get to you thank you this was the process of God becoming Redeemer and this is the process of you becoming God thank you Lord Lord and you had nothing to do with it you had zero to do with it you sat the whole bench in the whole game and they they gave you the trophy you got the MVP and you didn't play it down come on it's like you see these guys get these championship rings Super Bowl championship rings Lord let the Steelers get oneid you realize the guys that put the stickers on the helmet gets one the guy that puts the stickers on the helmet gets a super B ring come on bu come on and he might be sick with the flu at home come on on the day they want it come on now so you're getting a championship ring on and you weren't even there than Lord but this is God becoming there's a process God will never stop becoming God will never quit becoming brother Bram said eternity will never unfold what God really is so you have eternity to become with him it never ends it never stops we become 10 folks he has to give before he could raise you up he has to give you eternal life when did he give you that eternal life before the foundation of the world when he wrote your name Amen on the book right I did a sermon at home called the power in the name one time a few months ago and I caught something that brother Donnie was talking about he was preaching sometime last year I don't remember but he was talking about how if go if God became you and you became God Jesus Christ's name is the very first name on that Lamb's Book of Life and he had to write yours he can't write his without writing yours amen he can't why you are one you are one my wife can take our checkbook if it had just my name on it she can write a check to anything she wants do y'all have mutual property in Virginia how many knows what Mutual property is I told this to Brother David sers Church Sisters listen up you might want to take notes in the state of Tennessee we have what they call Mutual property that big F250 that you just bought if she wants to sell it she can sell it right your motorcycle your guns whatever because once you're married what's his is yours when you became married what was God's became yours yes sir that's part of the becoming you become him he becomes you brother brandham said the nature of your soul not is of God and so's in in prison now this is the same sermon I think where he preached that you are God's Perfection you are the Perfection of God but here he says the nature of your soul he didn't say your nature of your soul is of God he said the nature of your soul is God it is God that's how much God became you the nature of your soul brother Bram said your character is the only thing you'll take with you so there's a lot of your character that God has to take out thank you he has to take it out because it don't match his if it's not it's of the world if your nature is not God it is of the world anything that begin has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin that's right or never will end and then your life did begin when you were born God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living soul and You Begin then that's when you begin when not when you was born but it was when God breathed that life you had two lives begin right then your natural life and your eternal life am if you're a seed of God only if you're a seat of God predestinated there's some people don't believe in predestination I'm grateful for it I'm so glad I'm so glad that it it's been revealed to me because listen if if I didn't have a full under if I didn't have a full understanding and revelation of predestination I'd be worried I'd be worried because I'd be thinking God if I'm really a seed why am I doing this why am I failing here why am I doing this why am I acting like this right but I know go God's grace God's grace is extended to your predestinated life we going to take another turn here shortly so the process of you becoming didn't start with you it started with God right recently we had a wedding at home Malachi and Khloe you know when I was studying this I got to thinking about this y'all can tell him later that I preached about him wonderful young young man by the way and I didn't know there were so many Spencers Lord have mercy brother Al's Deacon job's full-time job with them Spencers lord they're good ones though even though they did fight with the girls if you know you know right so there's a process between a man and a woman that's going to be married she has to become him right there is a becoming that takes place right now this becoming didn't happen when they started dating right it did not happen when when Mal went to to Josh and and asked for Khloe's hand in marriage that that did not start her becoming his wife there's a lot of people out there that Jesus has extended his hand remember the Rich Young Ruler amen follow me be part of me knowing he's going to hell that's how that's that's God's grace you Jesus walked up to a man God in flesh walked to a man knowing pre by predestination he's going to hell and still offered him a way out that's God's grace God's grace extended to Cain brother Bram said God love came and tried to offer him a way out if you just do this so what if Khloe had said no be rough right now wouldn't it if she said no there would be no becoming there's many people that Jesus has has asked to be their bride or offered them they said no that's right said no there's no becoming it's not in them to become himall but he he offered it to you right thank you Lord and many of you probably didn't accept right away you didn't accept right away it might have took a while it might have took a mom and dad on their knees for for days and months and weeks and years trying to get you to accept that proposal from almighty God but there had to be a proposal so whenever Mal goes and asks Chloe will you be my wife and she accept when she said yes the becoming has begun The Becoming has begun she is in the process of now becoming him right when they walk up and take the vows in front of God and everybody and they lift the vows and they do their deal and they walk off Mr and Mrs Malachi Spencer amen she has become his wife but there's more becoming that happens that's right it didn't end with you in Jesus just a marriage you have to produce his life right there is a becoming that happens inside that produces a life right good his life amen so this this this this isn't your life will have to produce God's life your life will have to produce God's eternity your your life will have to produce everything that God is that's why brother brandom said your the nature of your soul is God because when you fully become filled with the Holy Ghost and his life is fully in you it's fully in you the becoming is becoming that's right it will produce only his life we look at look at Mary when we see Mary when God spoke to Mary and created that the seed in Mary everything that Mary Mary didn't produce one thing of herself God created the egg God created the seed everything was of God everything in your life that you produce will be of God if it's God's nature I'm I got too many notes so I'm gonna move move ahead sake of time so check the life you're producing is it God's life Bible says God was the word your your life if God if you are God that's that's so hard for the human mind the human mind to comprehend that he became you so you could become him you're never going to go around and tell every brother hey I'm God I'm God I'm God they might lock you up in Woodridge it's it's not that your life will say you were God you don't have to say it with your mouth you don't have to act like a fool and be a spectacle let your life tell what God did for you it's God's life in you that's right and when your nature is nature of your soul is God's nature it'll fit in the word like a puzzle piece yes sir it'll every every aspect of this word will mesh with your life yes sir when it's God's nature good so we come in and we sit down we listen to brother Andrew brother Ron Brother Wayne whoever's here brother brother Matt whoever's preaching what they're doing is trying to fit your life into that word you they are helping you become the word that's what this place is the house of judgment right it's the house of correction if we got edges that don't fit we fix them if we got things in our life that don't belong there we cut them off the word is like a two-edged sword so you come in here now some people won't accept that because their favorite Minister ain't here come on brother your favorite Minister ain't here for some reason the pastor you just so there's some people at our church I think they got the pastor's schedule I don't know how well they schedule their their their uh their Saturday vacations on Friday when they find out the Pastor's going to be gone come on their favorite Minister are you listening to the man giving the word or are you listening to the word if you're listening to the word you will become the word if you are focused on that man you can't become the word good it ain't about your favorite preacher that's right you know sometimes you know I've heard people say I just I just can't really receive from him are you saying he's not called are you saying he's not called you know more about the calling in his life than he does well prach when we get to the point when it's all about the word to us yes there it is all about the word all about becoming you don't care who's bringing it that's right you don't care who's bringing it you know in young people I see this and I know brother Andrew brother Matt probably see this more than I do I'm one of the youth leaders at church and you see them come you know we we started a when we moved into the new church brother Donnie wanted to start an 18 and older group and asked me to do that and brother Rob Weber does it 13 through 17 and we do those and as we've went on and for a while it was just like man tons and tons tons of kids and it's Humanity some of the world's greatest kids one of them sitting right here brother Taylor brother Tyler gagon we we enjoy him so thanks for sharing with us but they get to the point where you know question and answers on Thursday with brother Donnie is just the new has wore off come on the new has wore off the new facility the new upper room that we have above the kitchen it's wore off all the excitement in having something new and then you get into a rut you find things to do listen I was a youth I'm going to be vulnerable here sorry honey that's my passenger princess in case you'all ain't met her so I remember one night I was in church I played I was 16 years old 17 years old I played base for the youth group and then the youth Minister told me get up and give a test testimony I got up and cried and gave a testimony left went to the pool hall and then went to jail it happens it happens I guess that's why I got in law [Laughter] enforcement figured I'd catch a break next time but we all we we've all got things in our life that pull us aside maybe not that drastic I hope not come on come on but say that to say that young people are going to be young people that's right our job is as older people is get on our knees yes sir there it is get on your knees sir you pray for them keep encouraging encouragement encourage him to come to the meetings KY I didn't see you sitting over there that's another that's one of my favorites right there s Kylie mcgar she brings me Annie Ruth Donuts but young people are going to do young people things right you know I didn't mean to get off on that but but anyways you know be an example be a word the Bible says we're written epistle read of all men them young people are all men they're going to read your life they're going to read your attitude towards them right they going to see if you're projecting love or not they're going to see if you are becoming yes that's right they want to become yeah your youth here they want to become but they're fighting battles nowadays that we never had to fight brother Andrew they're fighting things that they that we never had to fight that's right so we encourage him in the in the in in the word I'm going to have to jump because I'm going to be here way longer than I I planned and I'm not a long preacher I promise my record an hour and 8 minutes but when you become him your life will produce him brother we're going to take another example of what it is like becoming God and God becoming you in John 15 1-5 Jesus says I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away in every branch that beareth fruit he purges that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the world which I have spoken of you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself you cannot bear fruit of yourself except it abide on the vine no more can ye except you abide in me this is the what I want to look at I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing so we're looking at what Jesus is telling him I am the vine we look at this and and I I I did a little research here on um I'll get to it in a second but Jesus tells him says I am the vine you are the branch you got to understand the vine does not bear the fruit right the vine does not bear the fruit we've heard the scripture so many times by their fruits you shall know them right you will bear the fruits of the spirit if his life is in you that's right you will bear the fruits of what every attribute that God is right if God is in you if the life is in you so the vine has the branches this is God extending himself out in you right you bear the fruit are you bearing his fruit or you bearing you your fruit right brother Bram said what is the fruit of the spirit love joy Faith peace longsuffering that's a part of God that's in you and can forbearance forbearing one another's burdens forgiving one another another I have noticed the last year most the ministers messages that I'm been hearing and even when I study it just pops up is about forgiveness people holding grudges people not forgiving if if God's life is in you you'll forgive them no matter what you know I told somebody I told somebody not too long ago I said I don't understand you know working in law enforcement uh I've most of my years in law enforcement I was a detective and I've worked homicides and other stuff and I've seen family members from from the victims that were murdered forgive forgive somebody that murdered your loved one I've seen that and you can't get people that claim to be bride to forgive each other that's a that's a shame that is a shame you got people holding grudges against somebody else the fruits of the spirit is love and forgiveness come on you you get all dressed up and pry for church you walk through the front door like you're the most holy person here and you're holding a grudge in your heart do you realize Jesus when Jesus told them how to pray Jesus tells them this is how you pray on when you for stand forgive when God forgives you you forgive cuz if you do not forgive God won't forgive you so if you're holding unforgiveness here from the very second that unforgiveness started in your life God hasn't forgave you of one thing not one thing everything you've done from that point is still on you God hasn't forgiven you so people take these grudges that they got and they attach it they grafted in brother brandom talked about grafting in they grafted in and they they try to put religion on it oh if they was the bride they wouldn't have done that to me oh my come on I have a right because they done this to I'm I'm a bride of Christ and they shouldn't have done that to me God says I'll cut it off yes sir come on cuz it don't bear my life that's right let me tell you something if you're holding a grudge you'll take it to hell you will take it to hell cuz God brother brandom said your character is the only thing you take with you that's right and everything only thing that will ever go in that land that's right is his life and if you're holding Grudge and you're holding in forgiveness and your heart get ready for three and 1/2 years right that's all I can tell you get ready for three and 1/2 years if you can't find that brother and sister whoever it is that you can't forgive and make that right how do you know you've got total forgiveness in your heart how do you know you've totally forgive them come on how about this every time they cross your mind every time they enter your heart you start speaking to the Lord Lord he the blessings on them like they never seen and whenever you know when you know youve forgive them when you see them you will be filled with joy I promise you that that's true forgiveness that's God's life why because you're seeing another member of the body why would a branch off a Vine treat another Branch off the same Vine like that this is God becoming the Bible says if it don't bear fruit I'm cutting it off off right if it doesn't bear fruit it gets cut off brother brandom said ex um the seven Church ages Patman Vision Jesus said I am the vine you the branches he is the main Vine which comes out of the original root from the original sea that has life in it now the vine does not bear fruit it is the branches that does that that's you that's me bearing the fruit so be careful what you say be careful when you're at work I worked with a guy one time he's a super wonderful Christian now but I worked with a guy one time and I'd worked with him for years and then somebody that we worked with came up to me and said I didn't know so and so want same church as you let me tell you this y'all I don't care where you live around here I don't care where you work where you shop everybody around here knows where you go to church Hallelujah they know who your pastor is they know let me tell you it's it's it's by the fruits you might be known as a skirt Church like us who knows come on but they know where you go to church and there's something about you and and I I've told this before told it a few times my wife probably gets tired of hearing it but she knows me she knows I'm I'm a humble person but I was I was in in C as our investigator division one time a patrol guy walked in I don't only been on he was a young guy two been there two or three years and he walks by me I'm and he goes man he said I want to tell you something if I ever said anything or did anything do you said anything about you he said man I'm sorry I looked at him and I said buddy you're a good dude I said you ain't never done nothing you ain't done nothing to me man he said 'well I know your life I know what you are he said ' I don't ever want to offend that we had a guy not too long ago just recently of course you know we've been doing the we've been doing the the flood relief and all that and one of our one of our young men at church his father-in-law owns a big auction business over there he knows some people at our church it's a wealthy man and he'd been helping us with the flood relief and he went to his son-in-law just a few weeks ago and he goes for years he said people all around here been talking about your church talking about you know snake handling and all kinds of stuff I don't know what you're just saying a cult and all that and he said I was he's a good Christian man good Christian nominal man he said I was standing here by myself the other day he said and God rebuked me for that he said I repented right there Baptist man very sensitive to the holy spirit because he got to working with them people right he got to work it with bride he saw it be coming he hadn't seen before God's nature changed his mind right the nature in God in you will change people's mind that's part of God becoming right they may never ever believe this right but it might cause them to say something kind about your church and when you get over there good good When God says who you want to let in you get to speak for people I don't know if you knew that or not we've got we've got lists don't we H we've got lists of people we're going to say Lord please let them inen they were so kind never said a bad word that is the process at the day of judgment where you're still becoming God you're becoming the judge they treated me with kindness Jesus said how you've done to the least of these you've done it unto me so they weren't treating you with kindness it was the becoming within you that they were treated with kindness amen don't ever take for granted the life the impact that your life has on people that's right don't ever take for granted that you are the light to the world the world and you're in the world every day that don't mean oh I'm the light of the world I got to get on a plane flow to India on Satan's Eden around you every day that's right and God will become in Satan's Eden amen he has no choice that's just how great he is it happens it just happens when God's life's in you it just happens there's nothing you can do about it God live through me we sing that song flow through me are you giving him something to flow through you know we we want the gifts we want all this stuff in work in your lives are you living a life that's worthy of the gifts right right they're yours they belong to you right God says these are these are gifts that I've give you to be used for the bride this last day is your life in such a spot where you can use them come on brother we've told in this last days these gifts will manifest themselves right have you put your life in a place where God can use them in you it's good brother it's good you might say I've never spoken tongues I haven't either I don't mean I want one day right every gift is not to every single person right God chooses who he will right you know I was studying this and the reason why when I was studying this the life of a Vine and it just hit me brother man I thought where do seedless grapes come from you're going to see where I'm going in a minute good brother come on how many knows how they get seedless grapes I didn't know till here I thought they sucked them out somehow seedless grapes does anybody know come on when a grape starts to start out on a branch the branch is cut off it's cut off from the Life Source oh and they stick that branch in the ground on its own ground come on it's got no life in it anymore it can't produce a seed without a life right amen you cannot produce a life seed if you don't have one right if you've been cut off from the vine right there's a lot of people God says I'll cut you off if you're not producing fruit I'll cut you off if you try to produ produce fruit of your own kind I'll cut you off right amen so looking through this process of how the vines happen and I started re researching this and what is a vine branch and how's it become branches and all this because when Jesus said I the vine you talking about branches people think of trees I'm the vine so everything he's referring to is is is a vine when referring to a vine branch becoming signif IES the process of growing and developing from a small Sprout into a mature fruit bearing Branch small Sprout when you when you started in this message you were just a juvenile you were just drinking milk there ain't no you couldn't eat meat you had to become mature you had to keep getting watered by the word that former rign had to keep coming had to keep coming and had to keep coming a small Sprout into a mature F fruit bearing Branch entirely dependent on its connection to the vine for Life yes sir totally 100% trusting in the vine amen it has to be it depend on the connection to the vine for life for nourishment and the ability to produce grapes you have to be connected to the vine you have to depend on the vine to produce fruit right cuz if you're not you're producing your own right and there's no seed in there right it embodies the idea of transformation and maturation to the independent its dependence on the vine itself and I'm going to I'm going to jump I have to jump I'm getting I'm back up here so when I was looking at thinking about God cutting vines off or cutting branches off you know when I was I was thinking about I had a a young lady I was talking to at church and she had some things in her past and she told me you know what I encouraged her she said yeah I know I think about that every time I remind myself of my transgressions I told her I said why are you reminding yourself why are you reminding yourself that God forgave you why do you when God forgives you or something do you realize you're reminding yourself of something he don't even know about that's God has no recollection of it so I got to thinking when God cut that off God delivered her of that forgiveness cut that fruitless Branch off that's right so you know I got to thinking about people that that go in and have surgery and they get Lums limbs cut off brother mat they get the the limbs cut up and they wake up from surgery and they think they still have it right they you've heard people tell talk to Medical people they say they still feel like they have their arm their hand and they believe they can my wife's cousin he had a motorcycle wreck he's passed on now but he had motorcycle wreck cut both his legs off both of his legs off hit a guardrail took him off and he thought he was running up the hill he tried on stumps but in his mind he still had his legs on he thought they were still there this young lady a good sister she thought her transgressions were still there cuz she was still reminding herself and she I told her God's cut that off God's delivered you of that why are you reminding yourself of a branch that didn't bear fruit that God said I I took it away I cut anything off that doesn't bear fruit thank you Lord good the devil has talked some of some of us of grafting your shame in into the vine in your branch you're grafted in I got to live with this shame what's what I've done my past I've got to live with shame the devil told you that right you ever you ever hear Brother brandom telling some of you might actually I've never seen him my brother has seen him how take a a lemon tree and they'll they'll they'll graft an orange Branch into that tree right what do y'all think it produces an orange because it ain't got the life of the tree in it right it's got its own life in the ranch that it's on it'll never produce a lemon right so people have grafted these things on that's not bearing the fruit that God gave them that's right they think part part of myself that that's a Catholicism idea that you got to beat yourself from Penance for for something that you've done the devil has told you that the devil has told you that you have to take this shame they've grafted in depression they've grafted in anxiety in their life and they're letting Satan talk to them saying I have to live with this yes sir you realize when nothing against medication but people have quit praying and start taking pills you've done the same thing the children of Israel did when God said you kick everybody out out you kill everybody man woman and child you don't kill that child he's going to raise up to be a malachite and he's going to take your land right God said kill them all so what did they do they they pushed them into the corner and they let them stay there that's right that's what people are doing in their lives and they're taking a pill they've settled for a pill when God said you could be healed right you don't have to be that way I'm not against doctors I'm not against pills no if it helps you more power to you but don't cling to that as your ultimate healing yes sir God said you are healed don't settle for something that the devil told you well this will help you right that's what the children of Israel said well they'll help us till the land they'll help us do this and they'll help us build houses they'll help us do this God becoming in you will push everything out of your life that is not like him you got cancer God said push it out you got depression push it out you've got anxiety you've got worries you got financial difficulties God said push it out I don't know what time I started let's stand together you know as I studying this and I I got down to towards the end and I don't know if any of y'all remember who uh but miles row was old black Minister from uh I think he was from the Bahamas wonderful man great understanding of the message I say understanding of of the word the scriptures I got to listening to him one day and he's and I got to thinking of this the disciples wanted to become like Jesus they wanted to become he was through everything Peter's like I'll kill for you whatever they wanted to be like him so he said how do we talk to God how do we pray why they they wanted to talk yeah they wanted to have a one-on-one relationship brother Andrew teach us how to talk teach us how to pray and so Jesus tells him in this after this manner therefore pray you oh Father which art in heaven Hallowed be the thy name you started off with giving God praise that's right Giving Him worship thy kingdom come Lord let your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread you're getting your daily bread today this is your daily bread I'll prove it to a minute in a minute he wasn't talking about regular food that you eat forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors this prayer is going to worshiping God and praying for others that's right and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil they knew he could do that they seen him do it they seen him overcome the Temptation in the wilderness for thine is the kingdom they finish up again with praise glory and worship for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever amen so he's telling him asking him Lord teach us to pray and I got to think that and goes on say in chapter 6 he goes then he says therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat he's not when you he said give us your daily bread he was talking about this right give no thought what you eat you ain't got to ask for it or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed you ain't got to ask for things of life he says your heavenly father knows you have need of all these things right seek you first his kingdom right what is this Kingdom John said when the angel come you want to see the bride what did he show him the Kingdom right you are the kingdom you are what he lives in so I got to think and he said all this stuff all these things shall be added unto you you don't have to ask don't get down every day and pray Lord I got cancer please take this cancer Lord I'm depressed I've got Suicidal Thoughts you ain't got to pray for that it's been added to you when you became him you received everything you had don't beat yourself up praying for your son or your daughter it's been added to you brother Ron don't have to keep praying for his healing it's been added let to ask no [Music] more but Lord give me more of this this is how you become right here give me more of this give me my daily bread Lord and if anybody's done anything against me forgive me forgive them that's right I don't want my heart nothing in my heart against anybody but when you stand praying give him praise cuz everything you have need of he's already gave you when you get to the full revelation of God becoming you you're going to see things added to your life are your trials going to go away probably not are your Temptations going to go away probably not they might even get worse when God when devil sees you winning in battle listen if he tempted Christ how is he not going to tempt you but see what you've asked for Lord give me strong in battle it's already been added you already have it let's bow our [Music] heads Lord how mindful you are Lord only you can change a human heart Lord if there's a need here Lord if somebody is struggling with revelation of who they are Lord when you said let there be light you had them in mind they are your friend favorite every son and daughter in here that has a personal re relationship with you feels like they're your favorite I feel that way Lord but Lord we know there's one that comes before you the Bible says he's the accuser of the Brethren he comes before you day and night in our human flesh we know Lord the scripture says he's a worthy adversary but you said the battle's not yours it's mine Lord we give it to you Lord give us a greater revelation of your nature in US Lord if there's any fruit in my life that's not bearing the life of the vine Lord we know when that branch that that fruit becomes maturity and the and the winds come and the storms come and it'll drop that fruit knock it right off the tree but there's something inside that fruit it falls right back to the ground that that very Vine is rooted in and when
