[52:51] name Holy Name there is the name of
[52:54] Jesus Christ Lord we're not ashamed of
[52:58] that name there's a lot of people that
[53:00] might be ashamed to speak the name of
[53:03] Jesus but some point in their life
[53:06] they're going to have to call on that
[53:08] name and while I'm here and got breath
[53:10] in my lungs I will speak the name that
[53:12] is above every other name I will claim
[53:15] victory in the name of Jesus I claim
[53:17] healing in the name of Jesus I Proclaim

[53:29] come tonight and you would bless us
[53:31] according to your riches and Grace now
[53:34] father your people have come here
[53:35] tonight many have traveled for quite a
[53:38] little bit of ways Lord and Lord there's
[53:40] some that live very close that maybe
[53:42] didn't have to put that much en energy
[53:44] into getting here but still the same the
[53:47] sacrifice is worthy and I pray father
[53:51] that you would see them Lord Jesus and
[53:53] that you would pour out a special
[53:54] blessing on every IND individual father
[53:57] Lord we have put our times in study we
[54:00] have sought your face we have Sanctified
[54:03] ourselves and we're asking father that
[54:06] thy Holy Spirit would have his will in
[54:08] this service tonight now I pray God that
[54:11] you would just be blessed tonight and we
[54:14] pray all these things in the name of
[54:17] Jesus amen amen if you have your Bibles
[54:20] this evening would like to look over in
[54:21] the Book of Psalms chapter
[54:24] 23 and acts chap 4 in verse
[54:29] one a little bit muffled here brother
[54:32] brother Adam man just like to uh
[54:35] piggyback just a little bit off of last
[54:38] weekend's thought there on anointed in
[54:41] the presence of thine
[54:44] enemies of course very familiar with us
[54:47] and sometimes you you go through things
[54:50] and sometimes you look at things in a
[54:52] new way and it just seems like the Lord
[54:53] begins to illuminate scriptures that
[54:55] you've read over your entire life and I
[54:58] just love how the Lord sends inspiration
[55:01] at certain seasons and certain times and
[55:03] I believe he's mindful of every single
[55:05] one of us tonight amen Psalms chapter 23
[55:09] and let's start at verse one the Lord is
[55:11] my shepherd and I shall not want I
[55:15] always I've always been this has one of
[55:16] been one of my favorite scriptures but I
[55:18] I never fail it never fails me to
[55:22] realize how precious this quote and this
[55:25] scripture is to us whether we can quote
[55:27] it by heart or not it's so amazing how
[55:30] David makes this so personal not just to
[55:34] David but to every one of us that we can
[55:37] say the Lord is my shepherd and I shall
[55:41] not want he maketh me to lie down in
[55:44] Green Pastures he leadth me beside the
[55:47] Still Waters he restoreth my soul he
[55:51] leadth me in the paths of righteousness
[55:54] for his name's sake and yet though I
[55:57] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[55:59] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[56:03] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[56:06] comfort me thou preparest a table before
[56:09] me in the presence of my enemies thou
[56:13] anointest my head with oil my cup
[56:16] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[56:19] shall follow me all the days of my life
[56:23] and I will dwell in the house of the
[56:25] Lord
[56:26] forever acts 4 and verse
[56:35] 1
[56:37] amen let's say blessed be the name of
[56:39] the
[56:42] lordess and as they spake unto the
[56:44] people the priest and the captains of
[56:46] the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon
[56:49] them being grieved that they taught the
[56:52] people and P and preached through Jesus
[56:54] the resurrection from the dead
[56:56] and they laid hands on them and put them
[56:59] in the hold until the next day for it
[57:02] was now even tied how be it many of them
[57:05] which heard the word believed and the
[57:08] number of the men was about 5,000 I
[57:11] think that's powerful right there that
[57:13] one scripture we could preach all night
[57:15] from that but it's amazing how some
[57:16] believed and how some turned it down but
[57:19] it is amazing that no matter who you are
[57:22] doesn't matter what you how you view the
[57:24] scripture election is ction there are
[57:27] some people that are going to hate the
[57:28] gospel and there are some that are going
[57:30] to just receive it as it is and receive
[57:33] eternal life and it came to pass that on
[57:35] the tomorrow that their rulers and their
[57:37] elders and scribes and ananas the high
[57:40] priest and caiaphus and John and
[57:43] Alexander And as many as were of the
[57:45] Kindred of the high priest were gathered
[57:47] together at Jerusalem and when they had
[57:49] set them in the midst they asked by what
[57:51] power or by what name have you done this
[57:54] and then Peter filled with the Holy
[57:55] Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the
[57:58] people and Elders of Israel if we this
[58:01] day be examined of the good deed done to
[58:03] the impotent Man by what means he has
[58:05] made whole be it known unto all you all
[58:08] and to all the people of Israel that by
[58:10] the name of Jesus of Christ over
[58:12] Nazareth whom you crucified whom God
[58:15] raised from the dead even by him doth
[58:17] this man stand here before you whole
[58:20] there's the witness of it right there
[58:22] you can argue about Jesus being dead you
[58:24] can argue about him being being alive
[58:26] you can argue about about the power that
[58:28] but you the witness is the Vindication
[58:30] is standing right there that's the
[58:32] Vindication that that Jesus was alive
[58:34] because an impotent man was standing
[58:36] there completely whole I'll be honest
[58:39] with you there's a lot of people that
[58:41] can say a lot of things about the
[58:42] message of the hour but I'll just say
[58:44] this that I'm a witness that Jesus is
[58:46] the power that raises from the
[58:49] dead he said now he said this is a stone
[58:53] which was set at not of you builders
[58:56] which has become the head of the corner
[58:57] neither is there salvation in any other
[59:00] there is no other name under Heaven
[59:02] given amongst men whereby we must be
[59:04] saved and when they saw the boldness of
[59:07] Peter and John and perceived that they
[59:08] were unlearned and ignorant men they
[59:11] marveled and they took knowledge of them
[59:14] that they had been with Jesus may God
[59:16] bless his word you may be seated tonight
[59:19] in the presence of the Lord and we
[59:20] realize that as Christians that that we
[59:23] are going to often be put in these kind
[59:26] of situations that make us feel very
[59:29] uncomfortable in our emotions and even
[59:32] in our physical flesh there are going to
[59:34] be times that are just maybe unpleasant
[59:37] to us but the matter of the fact it
[59:39] doesn't it doesn't matter it doesn't
[59:41] matter what we are going to go through
[59:43] but it it I say it like this we have got
[59:45] to stand in in good times and we've got
[59:49] to stand whether we are facing the most
[59:51] hardest and and and obstru obstacles we
[59:55] we realize that that we're going to come
[59:57] against some things and we're going to
[59:58] be faced by an enemy that is relentless
[1:00:01] on tearing us down but knowing in all of
[1:00:04] these things that we are covered by a
[1:00:06] power that we realize that that we are
[1:00:09] under a Psalms 91 of a Angelic Covenant
[1:00:12] that we realize that that we are
[1:00:14] dwelling in the secret place of the most
[1:00:17] high God and that we are covered by his
[1:00:19] very presence now the thing to me is so
[1:00:22] so Illuminating is that Jesus told his
[1:00:25] dis deciples that what we have just read
[1:00:28] in Acts three and acts 4 that these
[1:00:30] things were going to come to pass that
[1:00:32] that when you come before the the heads
[1:00:34] of the synagogues and the magistrates
[1:00:36] and the powers that be at mine don't
[1:00:38] take no thought what you're going to say
[1:00:41] but the holy spirit will literally take
[1:00:43] what he will take and put it in your
[1:00:45] mouth what things you're going to say so
[1:00:47] you don't have to study out what you're
[1:00:48] going to say when you come up against
[1:00:50] critics and when you come up against
[1:00:52] anointed ones at the end time but I
[1:00:54] believe that innocent is always willing
[1:00:57] to be
[1:00:58] questioned innocence is always willing
[1:01:01] to be questioned and a believer that is
[1:01:03] constantly that is standing for the
[1:01:05] truth will actually Rejoice at the
[1:01:07] opportunity to give a witness of the
[1:01:09] evidence that makes him a Believer I'd
[1:01:12] say that you could put you could put any
[1:01:13] of us in a corner and we could stand
[1:01:16] there and say I'm a witness that God
[1:01:17] still saves and God still delivers and I
[1:01:20] believe that if that if it comes from a
[1:01:22] a Vindicated experience of the Holy
[1:01:24] Ghost you're not ashamed and you're not
[1:01:26] afraid of whether you had to stand up in
[1:01:28] court and talk about the power of Jesus
[1:01:30] Christ or whe they had to do it down at
[1:01:32] Walmart now these men had never been to
[1:01:34] no Seminary they they hadn't studied out
[1:01:36] the scriptures like like a lot of people
[1:01:38] but they had been raised in it and they
[1:01:40] were around it all their life but the
[1:01:42] greatest thing is that they were with
[1:01:44] the author for three and a half years
[1:01:46] while he was walking now these men never
[1:01:48] went to no Seminary the Bible said that
[1:01:50] they were ignorant and unlearned and I
[1:01:51] can identify with them just right there
[1:01:53] and it makes me it makes me real happy
[1:01:55] to realize that that God can use
[1:01:57] somebody like Peter and John and I I'll
[1:01:59] say if he can use somebody like that
[1:02:01] that didn't even know how to sign their
[1:02:02] own name surely he's got some there's
[1:02:04] some hope for me and I I think it's a
[1:02:06] beautiful thing that they were living in
[1:02:08] the wealth of overflow of an anointing
[1:02:10] that was upon their life and I I think
[1:02:13] if I could say anything that I would
[1:02:15] want to be said about me that that men
[1:02:17] would Marvel that that that that that he
[1:02:20] didn't have the greatest education but
[1:02:22] they could say this that he'd been with
[1:02:24] Jesus and I believe that as my greatest
[1:02:26] greatest thing that I want people to
[1:02:28] recognize about me it's not about it's
[1:02:30] not about singing it's not about where
[1:02:33] I've been in life it's not about where
[1:02:34] I'm going in life but I just want people
[1:02:36] to take notice that I've been with Jesus
[1:02:39] and if I've been with Jesus it doesn't
[1:02:41] matter what I come up against I know the
[1:02:43] same power that stood there and thwarted
[1:02:46] the enemy 2,000 years ago is the same
[1:02:49] power that will anoint us to stand in
[1:02:52] the presence of our enemies I think it's
[1:02:54] a powerful thing when you can stand
[1:02:56] there in the face it's a it's a
[1:02:58] beautiful thing when you can stand there
[1:03:00] and relate to brothers and sisters of
[1:03:02] how great God's been to you but when you
[1:03:04] can stand there in the presence of your
[1:03:06] enemy and still say God's been a good
[1:03:08] God to
[1:03:10] me God's been a I tell you I went
[1:03:12] through hell I went through high waters
[1:03:14] I went through all the tmos but I say
[1:03:17] God's still a good God to me come on
[1:03:19] somebody I don't care what critic comes
[1:03:22] against the Church of the Living God we
[1:03:24] ought to be able to stand up there and
[1:03:26] be a witness that God's a good
[1:03:29] god well you might get sick and you
[1:03:31] might die but I'll say this that God's
[1:03:33] still a Healer you might have
[1:03:36] infirmities and God may not touch you
[1:03:38] but I'll say that God still gives
[1:03:40] Miracles out
[1:03:42] today well blessed be the name of the
[1:03:46] Lord now now we I read this to you last
[1:03:49] week and and just use it as a reference
[1:03:51] to draw a point when brother Randon
[1:03:53] preaches on the reproach for the cause
[1:03:54] of the word brother brandom draws that
[1:03:56] from Psalms 89- 51 that wherewith thine
[1:04:00] anointed or thine enemies have
[1:04:01] reproached oh Lord wherewith they have
[1:04:04] reproached the footsteps of thine
[1:04:06] anointing now now if you've listened to
[1:04:09] that uh if you've listened to that tape
[1:04:11] in in in a little while you you're very
[1:04:13] you're very familiar with this scripture
[1:04:14] or this quotation that I'm getting ready
[1:04:16] to make you remember that brother
[1:04:18] brandham is told by the angel of the
[1:04:20] Lord that there's a trap that is set
[1:04:21] before him and there's a trap that's
[1:04:23] coming now brother Brandon was
[1:04:24] anticipating that and different ways and
[1:04:26] he didn't understand it but when he goes
[1:04:28] to the meeting you remember that there
[1:04:29] was there was there was a a a young
[1:04:31] couple that was sitting there and there
[1:04:33] was making love right in the audience
[1:04:35] and this was the Trap that was set
[1:04:37] before him that's now I know that we've
[1:04:39] got a different uh uh diagram of people
[1:04:41] that are sitting here and and young
[1:04:43] people but that's the way the prophet
[1:04:44] said it so I'll just say it the way
[1:04:45] Prophet said it but they were making
[1:04:46] love right there and he said they were
[1:04:48] in my hands he said that was a trap he
[1:04:51] said now they were in my hands I could
[1:04:52] have done anything I wanted to do with
[1:04:54] them right there I could have called for
[1:04:55] death and death would have struck them
[1:04:57] he said but I literally looked on them
[1:04:59] and said I forgive you I forgive you now
[1:05:03] now this is what I'd like to just want
[1:05:05] to draw your attention to brother random
[1:05:08] said now what would you do with the
[1:05:11] power he said I I he said I believe that
[1:05:13] all things had a meaning he said but
[1:05:15] what would you do with the power how
[1:05:18] would you the reaction of an action he
[1:05:20] said something is come and act then how
[1:05:24] do you react to that that
[1:05:26] action I it's very easy to blow off at
[1:05:29] to handle it at anything but how do you
[1:05:31] handle it it's easy it's easy to go
[1:05:35] along with the flow when everybody is is
[1:05:37] for you and they're they're standing on
[1:05:39] your side but when they when you're in
[1:05:40] the middle of rejection and you and you
[1:05:43] have this power in your hand would you
[1:05:45] would you the one that's talked about
[1:05:47] you and the one that's criticized you
[1:05:49] could you have the ability to say I
[1:05:51] forgive you and I no matter what you do
[1:05:53] I'll love you
[1:05:56] what would you do with that kind of
[1:05:57] power and he said now you always stand
[1:06:00] he said you'll always have to stand this
[1:06:02] reproach in order to give to your
[1:06:03] testing to see every man that comes to
[1:06:05] Christ must first be child trained for
[1:06:08] the purpose I got to lose this for the
[1:06:11] purpose that God has ordained for you he
[1:06:14] said and remember if you can just keep
[1:06:19] quiet I I know that's tough man I I know
[1:06:22] what kind of people are sitting here
[1:06:24] tonight
[1:06:25] yeah I know I know I there's a whole
[1:06:28] another section back there about third
[1:06:30] quarter way back there I tell you what
[1:06:34] and they on my side and remember if you
[1:06:38] can just keep
[1:06:41] quiet help me Jesus remember if he has
[1:06:46] called you for this there is nothing
[1:06:49] that can keep it from happening there's
[1:06:52] not enough devils in torment but what
[1:06:54] God's word will be made manifest you are
[1:06:57] born for a purpose and nobody can take
[1:07:00] your place you might have impersonators
[1:07:03] and everything else but they'll never
[1:07:06] take your place God's word will Triumph
[1:07:10] it cannot
[1:07:12] fail there is where every Christian
[1:07:15] ought to stand knowing that the trials
[1:07:18] will come and seem every way to you but
[1:07:21] remember God has a
[1:07:23] purpose God has a purpose
[1:07:26] and it'll all work out all
[1:07:30] right you mean to tell me that God's Got
[1:07:33] Your Troubles in his hands that God's
[1:07:36] got the critics in his hands that God's
[1:07:39] got the things that you are facing in
[1:07:41] his
[1:07:42] hands so many times we as human beings
[1:07:45] we want to take this battle into our own
[1:07:47] courts bring it over here but if we can
[1:07:50] just be quiet set still and realize that
[1:07:53] we were called for a purpose that we
[1:07:56] were anointed for a purpose to stand Toe
[1:07:58] to
[1:08:00] Toe and sometimes speak and sometimes be
[1:08:06] quiet ah what are you saying brother
[1:08:08] Andrew I'm saying I want to live so
[1:08:09] close to him I want to live so close to
[1:08:12] him that he could express his power
[1:08:15] through me I want to walk like Enoch I
[1:08:17] want to pray like Daniel I want to sing
[1:08:20] like David I want to dance like Miriam I
[1:08:23] want to change like Sarah I want to
[1:08:25] shout like Joshua I want to ride on my
[1:08:28] Chariot like Elijah and I want to live
[1:08:30] like
[1:08:36] Jesus the Bible said in 1 John 2 and
[1:08:40] 27 but the
[1:08:42] anointing which you have received of him
[1:08:46] abideth in you now I'm getting ready to
[1:08:49] take you through just a a few portions
[1:08:51] of of Bible
[1:08:54] characters and the anointing would come
[1:08:56] on them and the anointing would leave
[1:09:00] them but you it's
[1:09:03] different but the anointing which you
[1:09:06] have received of him abideth in you and
[1:09:09] you need not that man teach you but as
[1:09:12] the same anointing teacheth you of all
[1:09:14] things and is the truth and is no lie
[1:09:17] even as it hath taught you ye shall
[1:09:20] abide in him the anointing would come on
[1:09:23] Moses and the anointing would leave
[1:09:25] Moses Moses was still had a temper but
[1:09:29] the difference in your life is that you
[1:09:31] had a temper but God took that temper
[1:09:34] and turned it towards the word of God so
[1:09:38] that now take God takes that temper
[1:09:40] where you would have flew off at the
[1:09:41] handle he now takes and puts scriptures
[1:09:44] in your mouth and you have a new power a
[1:09:47] new adversity in your
[1:09:52] lips I'm saying that against all
[1:09:54] opposition
[1:09:55] that God will exalt you that no matter I
[1:09:59] think it's powerful when you begin to
[1:10:01] think about Joseph that Joseph was
[1:10:03] exalted right in front of his betrayers
[1:10:06] I find it amazing that when Joseph
[1:10:09] brings forth children and he calls one
[1:10:11] Ephraim he said now now I've received
[1:10:14] this child that God has turned my
[1:10:17] Affliction in the land that I was put in
[1:10:21] you think about how Joseph could stand
[1:10:23] there and him be exalted
[1:10:25] and his brothers had to visibly watch
[1:10:28] the anointing Place him in
[1:10:31] power you want to talk about releasing
[1:10:34] potentials Joseph was put in a pit and
[1:10:38] he was raised out of that pit and he was
[1:10:41] put up there in Poor's house they took
[1:10:43] him out of Poor's house when he wouldn't
[1:10:45] sin and they took him over there and put
[1:10:48] him in a prison he stood there in a
[1:10:50] prison and no matter what they put
[1:10:51] Joseph through he was blessed and then
[1:10:55] when somebody remembered that there was
[1:10:57] a Joseph in the land he was raised to
[1:11:00] second in
[1:11:04] power right in the face of the
[1:11:06] opposition God will exalt you and prove
[1:11:09] the anointing is upon your life just
[1:11:12] like with the three Hebrew children I
[1:11:14] think it's beautiful brother Matthew's
[1:11:16] singing about it tonight he's singing
[1:11:18] about it tonight but it's a is a very
[1:11:20] powerful thing when you realize that in
[1:11:22] the face of opposition they didn't pray
[1:11:24] they didn't pray that the fire would go
[1:11:27] out they didn't pray that the king would
[1:11:29] change his mind they just stood there
[1:11:32] and they obeyed almighty God they didn't
[1:11:34] bow the knee they stood there and said
[1:11:37] no matter what I will not bow down to Le
[1:11:42] oosa I'll tell you that the anointing
[1:11:44] that is upon your life will be seen by
[1:11:47] the outside world it was three men down
[1:11:49] there but the visible the invisible son
[1:11:53] of man the invisible came the visible
[1:11:56] and the
[1:12:00] anointing the anointing was so visible
[1:12:03] that no matter the fire you're going
[1:12:06] through the anointing is
[1:12:11] there well I I got a little bitty trial
[1:12:14] going on I'll say the anointing still
[1:12:15] there I got one of the greatest trials
[1:12:18] I'm going through the anointing is still
[1:12:20] there the anointeth abideth in you and
[1:12:23] shall be in you
[1:12:26] the Bible said in judges
[1:12:28] 13-25 that the spirit of the Lord
[1:12:31] speaking about Samson begin to move at
[1:12:33] him move him at times in the camp of Dan
[1:12:38] between zor and
[1:12:40] esah so the scripture is showing us that
[1:12:43] Samson strength and purpose were not of
[1:12:46] his own making but they were stirred by
[1:12:49] the Holy Spirit by the Lord when you
[1:12:52] begin to study that word move in this
[1:12:54] verse first it suggests a Divine
[1:13:00] agitation a Divine
[1:13:03] agitation when God gets
[1:13:06] upset that's one thing when I got my
[1:13:10] corner on my side and they get agitated
[1:13:13] but when God gets agitated you know that
[1:13:16] Samson was born for a purpose to destroy
[1:13:19] the Philistines and that the spirit of
[1:13:21] the Lord would divinely agit divinely
[1:13:24] agitate Samson in such a way that God
[1:13:27] would awaken the anointing that was
[1:13:30] within him he was raised for this
[1:13:32] purpose he was just walking down the
[1:13:34] road one day and a line came out and the
[1:13:37] Bible said that he didn't have nothing
[1:13:39] in his hands but he destroyed it with
[1:13:41] his bare hands it gives you
[1:13:43] encouragement to know whether you're
[1:13:45] with whether you got the rod in your
[1:13:47] hand or whether you don't you've got a
[1:13:49] power you've got an
[1:13:53] anointing come on somebody
[1:13:55] he had an anointing this line that is
[1:13:58] coming to steal to kill and destroy you
[1:14:01] have to take the word of God in your
[1:14:03] anointing when opposition Rises
[1:14:08] unexpectedly I mean on Monday Tuesday
[1:14:10] Wednesday
[1:14:12] Thursday are you with me God's anointing
[1:14:16] will give you a supernatural strength to
[1:14:18] overcome the
[1:14:20] threats whether you see it coming or
[1:14:22] whether you don't
[1:14:25] there's countless times when the
[1:14:26] anointing of the Lord would come upon
[1:14:27] Samson but you remember when his
[1:14:29] brothers took a new spirit and they
[1:14:32] begin to bind him something that he
[1:14:34] hadn't been bound with before they took
[1:14:36] a new spirit new cords and they begin to
[1:14:38] bind him with it and when Samson come
[1:14:42] into the camp of the Philistines and
[1:14:44] they shouted against him the Bible said
[1:14:47] that the spirit of the Lord began to
[1:14:49] anoint
[1:14:50] him and they begin to break that the
[1:14:53] anointing begin to break the bonds that
[1:14:56] was upon his
[1:14:59] life like flax in a fire it begin to
[1:15:02] burn up I so I say it like this the
[1:15:05] anointing that's on your life that when
[1:15:07] the enemy tries to bind you with a new
[1:15:09] spirit a new complex a new power a new
[1:15:12] idea a new ideology that the anointing
[1:15:15] that is upon your life will break the
[1:15:18] power of the enemy I say it like this
[1:15:21] that that that Samson didn't know what
[1:15:23] he was grabbing a hold of but he this
[1:15:25] wretch over there and grabbed a hold of
[1:15:27] a jawb of an ass and began to beat down
[1:15:29] a thousand Philistines so God's
[1:15:32] anointing not only set you free but
[1:15:35] God's anointing takes ordinary things
[1:15:37] and makes powerful weapons out of
[1:15:42] them Hallelujah well you say all I got a
[1:15:45] little sling in my hand David put it to
[1:15:47] work all I got a little Jawbone all I've
[1:15:50] got is maybe a thread in my corner but I
[1:15:52] say put the anointing to work Let it
[1:15:55] Loose let take what you got and let God
[1:15:59] do something with
[1:16:02] it ah come on somebody I'd have probably
[1:16:05] been like that little chubby guy brother
[1:16:06] Matthew was talking about last week and
[1:16:08] carrying a lunch with him Mama always
[1:16:10] made sure that we had a little extra in
[1:16:12] there just in case just in case we got a
[1:16:14] little extra hungry or we need to feed
[1:16:16] somebody else that was with us and
[1:16:17] didn't have something something to eat
[1:16:19] I'd have probably been like that guy it
[1:16:21] didn't seem like much but it sure was a
[1:16:23] whole lot to when Jesus got a hold of it
[1:16:26] I say your life may not seem like a
[1:16:27] whole lot but when God gets a hold of
[1:16:30] it is there anybody willing to say God
[1:16:33] get a hold of
[1:16:43] me a Divine
[1:16:46] agitation just like a fire needs to be
[1:16:49] stirred to make it
[1:16:51] harder the Holy Spirit begin to stir
[1:16:54] Samson
[1:16:56] and in his final
[1:16:58] Victory he kills more
[1:17:00] Philistines in one
[1:17:02] act he's blinded he's weak and he looks
[1:17:07] like he's without God but even in your
[1:17:12] weakness God can send an anointing on
[1:17:15] your life to anoint you to destroy more
[1:17:18] devils and what would seem to be your
[1:17:21] destruction I said no matter how weak
[1:17:23] you are no matter how strong you are no
[1:17:26] matter what case or what condition that
[1:17:28] you are in I said let the spirit of God
[1:17:31] like it moved out upon the face of the
[1:17:33] water and begin to wake up seeds I said
[1:17:35] let the spirit of God move on you like
[1:17:37] it moved on on men of old when the
[1:17:39] spirit of God would they would be moved
[1:17:41] by the Holy Ghost to write down
[1:17:43] scriptures I said let the Holy Ghost
[1:17:47] flow through your life let God anoints
[1:17:49] you you said well brother ROM said one
[1:17:51] time he said well I said I he said now I
[1:17:54] it's Pentecostal people out there and
[1:17:55] people say well I don't understand why
[1:17:57] they act the way they act I don't
[1:17:59] understand why they shout like they
[1:18:00] shout he said how can it be how can it
[1:18:02] be of the Lord when they sit there and
[1:18:04] kick them tables over kick chairs over
[1:18:06] knock the windows out he said I tell you
[1:18:08] what it is he said it's a holy ghost he
[1:18:11] said well surely you don't mean that's a
[1:18:13] holy ghost he said absolutely it's a
[1:18:14] holy ghost He said but it's like a train
[1:18:16] going down the track he said it's got
[1:18:18] that steam in the engine and it just
[1:18:20] blows it right out he said but he said
[1:18:23] that's the way them people are he said
[1:18:25] they got to let the steam out he said at
[1:18:27] least they got a little bit of steam so
[1:18:29] don't make fun of nobody just because
[1:18:31] you don't understand how it's a holy
[1:18:33] ghost why you think they need to be
[1:18:35] active brother brandom said what they
[1:18:37] need to do is put that steam to action
[1:18:40] he said get it running down in the
[1:18:42] valves and make the wheels roll he said
[1:18:44] then you'll see signs then you'll see
[1:18:46] wonders then you'll see Miracles I say F
[1:18:49] go pogh house don't let the steam just
[1:18:51] come out of your mouth put the mechanics
[1:18:54] that Dynamics through the mechanics and
[1:18:56] let it
[1:18:58] flow come on Samson once more
[1:19:02] Lord once more let it flow through
[1:19:12] me
[1:19:15] Rebecca when it come to her time of
[1:19:20] decision when she heard the message and
[1:19:23] it meant something to her
[1:19:27] and she said I'm going to go with you
[1:19:29] but her mother and her brother Mother
[1:19:31] random said like a typ of the church
[1:19:33] tried to hold her back here I said let's
[1:19:36] whe let's see whether when we get on the
[1:19:38] other side of this revival whether if
[1:19:40] it's real or not let's just wait till
[1:19:42] it's over to see brother Mar said I got
[1:19:44] very much I've got very little faith in
[1:19:46] somebody that can that can say let's
[1:19:48] wait tomorrow before I make a decision
[1:19:51] he said but the message of the hour had
[1:19:53] sted Rebecca the Angel's message had
[1:19:56] stirred her in such a way that the
[1:19:59] message that she heard about Isaac had
[1:20:01] satisfied her I say that what we've
[1:20:04] heard about our ISAC has satisfied me
[1:20:08] this message has stirred me it's stir I
[1:20:11] tell you what I could fight through a
[1:20:13] thousand Philistines I could climb over
[1:20:15] a thousand hills because this message
[1:20:17] has satisfied me well you too worked up
[1:20:21] no sir you ain't seen nothing yet this
[1:20:24] message has stirred my innermost
[1:20:28] being you say well we can talk about
[1:20:30] days of Miracles going by oh no I say
[1:20:32] there's more coming I say it's more
[1:20:35] power I say it's more anointing I say we
[1:20:38] got more challenges but we got more
[1:20:46] victories I know it's a paradox it's a
[1:20:49] paradox to be standing in the hour that
[1:20:51] we're living in where the presence of
[1:20:53] almighty God is moving moving out upon
[1:20:55] the face of the waters and making voices
[1:20:57] come alive to speak the same thing that
[1:21:01] he's saying I know I I know that it's
[1:21:05] incredible but it's true that right here
[1:21:07] in the face of all they to see that
[1:21:09] there's a people that refuse to give in
[1:21:12] they refuse to give up they refuse to
[1:21:14] bow
[1:21:17] down to any
[1:21:19] Spirit come on somebody any spirit
[1:21:27] I say you're anointed to conquer
[1:21:31] sickness I say you're anointed for it I
[1:21:34] say you're anointed to defeat complexes
[1:21:37] you're anointed for it I say you're
[1:21:39] anointed to uh to conquer fear I I
[1:21:42] believe that you're anointed for it I
[1:21:44] believe that that yes it is incredible
[1:21:47] but it's true that you could be
[1:21:49] fellowshipping with the same
[1:21:52] one that your Prophet was Fellowship
[1:21:55] with it's incredible but it's true that
[1:21:59] that same power that was standing there
[1:22:02] in 1950 at Houston Coliseum Coliseum
[1:22:06] that same power is right
[1:22:10] here the same enemy that was standing
[1:22:13] there in 1950 is standing here right now
[1:22:16] it's challenging the message of the hour
[1:22:18] it's challenging whether you believe it
[1:22:20] or not it's challenge whether you're
[1:22:21] going to go all the way or not it's a
[1:22:23] challenge but I say every time you
[1:22:25] challenge God God shows
[1:22:29] up what are you saying brother Angel I'm
[1:22:31] saying don't fight your battles let God
[1:22:33] fight for you don't you debate with him
[1:22:35] brother Bosworth let God do the talking
[1:22:38] I'll tell you what there's a lot of
[1:22:39] Ministries that we could look at there's
[1:22:41] a lot of men that had had the phenomena
[1:22:43] in their Ministry but there was only one
[1:22:46] that had a Vindication like this one
[1:22:49] come on somebody there was a lot of
[1:22:50] people that produced Miracles a lot of
[1:22:52] men of God and I I thank God for for
[1:22:55] him I do you look at the world they're
[1:22:59] still feeding off of Billy Graham's
[1:23:01] Ministry they're still riding on this
[1:23:03] coattail today and I believe people are
[1:23:05] getting saved under
[1:23:07] it but ain't none of them got the
[1:23:09] Vindication of Malachi
[1:23:12] 4 that could stand there could stand
[1:23:15] there and know exactly what that seven
[1:23:17] seal was know exactly what they what it
[1:23:20] was standing there to look at the enemy
[1:23:22] i' say that these things it's the
[1:23:28] Antichrist it's
[1:23:29] amazing but it's true it's amazing that
[1:23:33] you could take what we people would say
[1:23:35] today is is a 70y old
[1:23:41] religion well he's been dead and gone
[1:23:43] about 70 years now why you still listen
[1:23:45] to him same old tapes well I just happen
[1:23:48] to believe it is that they're rapturing
[1:23:50] faith that comes off them tapes and gets
[1:23:54] on a people that stimulates him so for
[1:23:57] me it ain't just a tradition it ain't
[1:23:59] just to listen to a man that's dead that
[1:24:01] message didn't come from Kentucky and it
[1:24:04] didn't come from Indiana that message
[1:24:06] came from glory and that message will
[1:24:09] anoint you in the
[1:24:12] presence of your
[1:24:18] enemies now I'm I'm coming to something
[1:24:23] another man I'm sitting now when God
[1:24:24] moves in a supernatural your heart will
[1:24:27] hunger right to it again he would say an
[1:24:30] expectation he said everywhere God moves
[1:24:33] and anytime Through the Bible you'll see
[1:24:34] healing and miracles and signs and
[1:24:36] wonders he leaves a track behind him of
[1:24:38] the supernatural I don't care what
[1:24:40] theologians say the Bible's
[1:24:43] right
[1:24:45] amen let the brothers say let the sister

[1:26:07] want to go but I'm just following the
[1:26:08] leadership of the Lord right
[1:26:11] here you
[1:26:12] remember when when in Numbers Chapter 20
[1:26:16] that that the that they'd come into a
[1:26:20] spot and God had took care of his
[1:26:22] children the Bible said the when they
[1:26:24] come to the desert of Zen that sin that
[1:26:27] they they stood there and the Bible said
[1:26:29] in numbers 20 that they had no water
[1:26:31] there and you're talking about getting
[1:26:32] people
[1:26:34] upset they was upset they wanted to kill
[1:26:37] the guy that got them out of the mess in
[1:26:39] in the first
[1:26:41] place and they come against him with
[1:26:43] threatening and the Bible went on to say
[1:26:45] that that that Moses and Aaron ran with
[1:26:48] fear back to the tent of the Lord and
[1:26:50] laid down and begin to in fear begin to
[1:26:53] talk to the Lord about about these
[1:26:54] things and they laid there and the Bible
[1:26:56] said and the angel of the Lord and the
[1:26:59] Lord appeared unto them and said say
[1:27:01] unto them take Moses take your rod and
[1:27:05] speak to the rod speak to the Rock and
[1:27:09] the Bible said that and his Waters came
[1:27:12] for it matters where the wat's coming
[1:27:14] for him this is his water you see no
[1:27:18] matter where they went Paul said in 1
[1:27:20] Corinthians and 10 he said no matter
[1:27:22] where they went that rock follow them
[1:27:24] and that rock was
[1:27:27] Christ I'm going to tell you what it's
[1:27:28] going to be something powerful to be
[1:27:30] able to water two million
[1:27:32] people you remember when brother Mar
[1:27:34] talk he said now he said that car mine
[1:27:35] that put painted that little picture a
[1:27:37] little bit little bit of water trinkling
[1:27:39] out that rock he said he said that guy
[1:27:41] was false he said ain't no way he said
[1:27:43] but this is a Guster come out of there
[1:27:45] he said cuz it was enough to water two
[1:27:47] million people and all their beasts and
[1:27:49] all their animals so when you come up
[1:27:51] against opposition God will Pro provide
[1:27:55] in the worst of conditions God will
[1:27:57] provide for you I I say this all you got
[1:28:01] to do is speak to the
[1:28:03] rock you speak to rock
[1:28:06] well I tell you what I'm up against it
[1:28:09] well I I tell you it's it's amazing when
[1:28:11] in Exodus 14 that he says why you crying
[1:28:14] unto me speak and go forward he comes to
[1:28:17] number 20 said just speak to the Rock
[1:28:20] You know the disciples got into a place
[1:28:22] one time where they were all look up
[1:28:24] because of the storm that they was in
[1:28:26] and they realized that The Rock was
[1:28:28] sitting back there in the bow of the
[1:28:29] boat and it began to speak to him I say
[1:28:32] this if you need peace speak to the Rock
[1:28:34] if you need Joy speak to the Rock if you
[1:28:37] need healing speak to the Rock come on
[1:28:40] somebody speak to
[1:28:42] it now now any of you I'm going to jump
[1:28:46] right here but any of you that know have
[1:28:48] studied a little bit I know brother
[1:28:49] Denny few of us here few others and some
[1:28:52] of our older people still might even
[1:28:54] remember some of these things but
[1:28:55] brother Brandon would talk about that
[1:28:56] Mad Dog bot that they would that there
[1:28:59] was old folklore that they said that if
[1:29:01] You' get that that mad rock that if you
[1:29:04] take it if if you really studied out it
[1:29:06] it's a hair ball comes from a white tail
[1:29:08] deer and real
[1:29:11] porous and they believe that if you
[1:29:13] could take that rock it become so hard
[1:29:16] that they they they they believe that if
[1:29:18] you if you got bit by a rabbit dog or or
[1:29:20] if you got bit or by some kind of
[1:29:22] poisonous creature that you could take
[1:29:24] that stone and you could lay it on that
[1:29:26] wound and if that if that stone would
[1:29:28] stay there then then it would draw the
[1:29:31] literal the disease right out of
[1:29:35] you that a that ain't too crazy is
[1:29:39] it now you sisters y'all got hair
[1:29:44] balls God has blessed
[1:29:47] you and we find this us Brothers find
[1:29:50] them

[1:29:57] weekends a row I'm talking about

[1:37:50] moving and starts to stirring there's a
[1:37:52] track of the
[1:37:56] Supernatural That's why brother brandham
[1:37:58] said in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:37:59] revealed he said that's what the devil's
[1:38:00] howling about is that this is being
[1:38:05] revealed what if I told you that the
[1:38:07] thing that was choking
[1:38:09] you is defeated would you believe
[1:38:13] me well don't believe me take what this
[1:38:17] word has
[1:38:18] said what if God would wake up in the
[1:38:21] morning God would wake you up in the
[1:38:23] morning and speak to you and tell you
[1:38:26] that your battles are over and that
[1:38:28] they're
[1:38:30] finished I got a question for you would
[1:38:33] you hear him and would you believe
[1:38:36] him all let me ask you a real question
[1:38:39] here if an audible voice talked to you
[1:38:42] and said you are
[1:38:44] healed would you stand there and wonder
[1:38:46] at it or would you say I believe that
[1:38:49] with all that's within
[1:38:52] me well let me let me just let me just
[1:38:55] give you an audible voice Isaiah
[1:38:57] 53 come on somebody you don't need
[1:39:00] somebody to speak it in the audience you
[1:39:02] don't need somebody to say it over your
[1:39:04] life he was wounded for my
[1:39:07] transgressions he was bruised for my
[1:39:09] iniquities the chastisement of my peace
[1:39:12] was upon and by his stripes I am healed
[1:39:17] there's your Audible
[1:39:21] Voice there it is
[1:39:24] you're healed go on your road believe it
[1:39:27] go on rejoicing you're anointed in the
[1:39:30] presence of
[1:39:32] sickness anointed in it you're healed of
[1:39:36] that nervousness you're healed of
[1:39:38] varicose veins you're healed of birth
[1:39:40] pains you're healed of baring
[1:39:44] [Applause]
[1:39:48] troubles how many believers
[1:39:54] you said better be careful brother
[1:39:55] angrew you don't know where you're
[1:39:56] standing absolutely I
[1:39:58] do come on somebody I got the word of
[1:40:01] God on my side I got a Vindicated
[1:40:04] Prophet on my side I got your faith on
[1:40:06] my side I got my faith on my side I got
[1:40:09] God on my side God is not backing
[1:40:17] up just because you ain't seen it in a
[1:40:20] minute does it make it not real that's
[1:40:23] right just because you haven't felt the
[1:40:26] impulse of it in a little bit does it
[1:40:28] make it not
[1:40:29] true I say he's the same yesterday today
[1:40:32] and forever if a prophet would read from
[1:40:35] that scripture over 3,100 times he would
[1:40:38] quote that I say he's still the
[1:40:42] same I say he's God over
[1:40:45] cancer I say he's God over
[1:40:48] doubt I say he's God over every demon
[1:40:56] it's
[1:40:58] amazing is the theology Will Never Move
[1:41:01] a
[1:41:03] demon that demon will stay right there
[1:41:05] and he will antagonize you and he will
[1:41:08] swear at you and he'll cuss you he'll
[1:41:09] talk in your ear and make you believe
[1:41:11] all kinds of
[1:41:12] things theology will make him feel like
[1:41:15] he's welcome but when you start turning
[1:41:18] towards him and start preaching Mark 16
[1:41:21] and you start preaching John 14 that
[1:41:23] demon starts get to get you get a little
[1:41:25] excited you remember when brother Bon
[1:41:27] would preaching the acts of the Holy
[1:41:28] Spirit he would stand there and he said
[1:41:29] now he said now when he said when the
[1:41:31] when the enemy would come in there he
[1:41:33] said that when he said he didn't even
[1:41:35] roll out of his bed he said when when
[1:41:37] they stood up there and preached on the
[1:41:39] day of Pentecost he said but when he
[1:41:40] went up there in Acts chapter 3 and the
[1:41:42] phenomena started happening he said the
[1:41:44] devil rode out of his bed right there he
[1:41:46] said because if the Phenom to get
[1:41:47] started right now he said I'll never get
[1:41:49] it stopped and he tried to stop it then
[1:41:52] he tried to put him in in prison he
[1:41:54] tried to shut them in jail he tried to
[1:41:55] shut them up he tried to hang them on
[1:41:57] the cross he never stopped the gospel
[1:41:59] then so he ain't going to stop it now
[1:42:02] because it's the same acts continuation
[1:42:05] of the book of Acts right here in this
[1:42:09] church I am a
[1:42:13] believer and I am anointed in the
[1:42:16] presence of my enemies
[1:42:23] let's
[1:42:40] stand oh heavenly
[1:42:47] father father how we welcome your
[1:42:49] presence in this
