many ofone have an unspoken request you'd like to lift up to the Lord ask brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just come lead us to the throne of grace this morning [Music] let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful to be able to come and gather again this morning and we're so thankful for the word last night and just to be able to hear how powerful we can be and how we can use our tongue for greatness and use our tongue to speak to speak your presence into the atmosphere Lord and we just know that we are armed and dangerous Lord and we can use that to speak healing we can use that to speak to speak blessings upon others lives Lord and we just ask that we would take that message and let it live Lord and sometimes it may just be speaking it over our life so we can walk and we can have others see your light shine through US Lord because without you there's nothing we can do and we are no one Lord and Lord Jesus as these prayer requests are brought before you there's great and many needs and we see Satan is battling many and battling in the organs and and organs that we need to be able to survive Lord but Lord You've designed our bodies that healing is in our body and we just ask and speak that the great healer would come down and you would be with each and every one of the needs and these little ones that are at home sick and not feeling well the parents are at home and they're they're trying to take as best care of them as they can and um there's only so much we can do at times and but the greatest thing we could do is just as we're doing now and lift their names in prayer Lord I just ask that you would just you would come and be with us this morning in the building and just come and be with us that we may be able to draw dra n to you tonight Lord and Lord we just we know that there's great there's great battles Among Us and even great mental battles that are going on and Satan is coming and he's causing great spiritual battles just as there's a physical battle going on in Israel just now and Lord Jesus I just ask that you would draw our faith even higher because even when it seems there is no way Lord Jesus if we just lean upon your arms lean upon your wings you'll carry us over the battles and you'll carry us through every every stricken thing that we go through Lord and I just ask that you would just come and touch us and even in these temporary situations that we're in allow us not to make a permanent decision just because the temporary battle that we are in allow us to continuously fight fight the good fight of faith and fight to be a good believer and fight for the word that you have given us in this hour this is the hour there's nothing left after this but the Rapture and we know what comes after that we don't want one left behind but Lord Jesus I ask at each and every one we could just search our Our Lives search our lives for anything that may be unlike you and allow us to be able to come clean this morning clean everything that that should not be in our lives just come and clean it forth this morning Lord and we just thank you for what you about to do and we just thank you for

little bit of a treat this morning for you I know several have uh kind of seen the video clip of uh dad's hunt this this past week but we want to share it with you this morning as a congregation I know it's it might not seem churchy but hey we enjoy it so so I want to preference preference the the clip this morning as uh we started this trip in 2020 after uh the diagnosis of dad the brain surgery everything he's been through as a bucket list trip and uh so we got in touch with brother Andrew coffee which is brother Barry coffey's son and we knew he had some recommendations for guys and places to go for hunting trips and uh we just said you know where is a good spot kill a big buck have a good time and just do this for Dad and so he recommended Ben platner from Timberland Outfitters and I'm not trying to recommend this for anybody I'm just telling you the the story here but so we we got in contact with Ben and told his situation dad situation there and uh what we wanted to do because Time s felt like it was slipping away pretty fast there you know but the Lord had other plans and uh so we arranged a trip in 2020 and it was a spur of the moment we had I think it was four days to prepare brother Gabe myself and dad went on this trip to Illinois and uh we get there and dad does as usual and becomes the the celebrity the politician and and everybody's best friend in Camp and uh they just became family immediately there and um Ben and his mother Mo and then Ron they uh they run the camp there and and one of the first things I remember walking into the the lodge there uh Ron was standing there not my dad but uh the Ron that's there at the campy says now now her name is Mo and mine's Ron but we're not Mo Ron it just mow and run so immediately I knew I was at home you know cuz you had Three Stooges come in the camp but uh so this this trip became uh came a yearly trip for us after that because we made made more than friends but we made family and that's what uh they have become to us and it's hard to believe that you can go into a hunting camp and you can then not preach a sermon as dad was saying last night but we lived one and we've we've prayed with men there and I have I have seen the power of God fall upon men and give confession their life over to the Lord Jesus Christ there amen and that's that's bigger than any buck that could ever been killed there you know deer hunting is deer hunting but we're talking about eternal life that's right and and that's what this trip has become for us to to be able to be a witness of what our Lord Jesus Christ can do and uh so we began this trip and every year that we have went it's not worked out for Dad it's worked out for several others brother Davy is killed there brother Alden brother Gabriel Brother Malachi Andrew and myself have killed there but it just never seemed to work out for dad you know not that he was disappointed that we all killed one but we wanted him to kill one just as much as we wanted to kill one there and uh but so it never worked out but I just want to say this year the Lord provided for him and uh you might not seem that it's supernatural thing but the deer up there are very hard to kill and uh for Dad his situation they tried to put him on one but this year it worked out and we thank the Lord for that and and we wanted to share that with you this morning and and uh so that you can be a part of it too because you are a part of it we're family here and we have have eternal life together and we'll just tell it all over there all the little details of every little thing but we want to share this with you this morning so God bless you I can Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh h he's a St dude B he didn't go nowhere did he I'm so happy so many ways how far was the when you shot him 20 yard saw him before daylight do say is that the one you saw earlier yeah to you yeah talk to me Ben and all these guys around me this morning despite fourth stage cancer

society's going to know about this right here hallelujah they gave me four months and I'm here three years it's worth the fight [Applause] God shows how much he loves us and it was a bucket list for those that understand what a bucket list is do a it's one of those things that you kind of say I want to accomplish and it seemed like now on our fifth trip that we were you know you don't know if it'll happen or not but God was so good to us as you can tell it was quite an emotional time for us and I thought as I was sitting there it must have been an incredible thing when Abraham looked up and God gave him a ram in the bushes and uh uh God does those things for us and hunting is hunting and so we were so blessed and they're they're all watching this morning because we told them that we were going to do this and Mo and Ron she's 78 years old and and Ron somewhere in that vicinity he's a great big guy just a big teddy bear and Ben their son runs the camp and he's be he's become quite family to us and and uh we certainly enjoy them and they have been so gracious to us and and uh word is God out their campus is pretty full next year and um but you know I just told him I said well I'll come back next year let's do this again the Lord gives me another year we'll do this again and so Matthew has been such a great guy with me and taking care of me and washing my clothes with while I'm there and being with me I'll be honest with you Matthew was hunting a long way away and I knew that the guides were coming and fellas that had already killed were coming and uh once you kill you become a helper to the guide and so I heard somebody whistling at me and I could see the trucks coming and I heard somebody whistling I said where is that coming from and when I turned around and there stood Matthew I literally I thought my heart was is going to come out of my chest and he's good to us I'm sorry I don't know how much longer I'll have to fight but I'm going to win I'm going to [Applause] win for those who have struggled with cancer and AE especially stage four cancer it's a wicked Beast this morning I got up and I was aching all over I would have rather laid in a hot tub and Connie's quite a cheerleader she say you'll make it you'll make it you you'll get through it and I just I just thank you for the team that is around us and and for all that every one of you mean to us there's nobody here that I don't love and I really care for with all my heart and I hope you feel that for those watching today especially from the camp I met a I met a minister there that has a large congregation he was so kind and caring and he prayed for me while we were there uh his deacons was there with him and his son was with him and and uh he sent me a note this morning before getting in the car he sent me a note and he said I'm pulling for you today and and um he was just a wonderful guy I would say he's about 50 years old something like that maybe not 50 I don't want to I don't want to say too old here but just a wonderful guy and I've met a lot of great friends there and and um I people come from all over the United States to go there not everybody's Christians and amen but I'm just glad to to to be there and to enjoy that and to enjoy what God gave us and and uh I hope that's all right with you and so well brother Ron I don't believe in all that hunting and killing well when you eat your hamburger at McDonald's I don't know where you think that come from so but I got a new story for you that come from a cow and uh amen amen don't you love him would you love him with all your hearts and isn't he good to us amen thank you thank you for your love to us and your prayers for us and uh we we certainly love you with all of our hearts could we stand this morning and I'll try to pull myself together and I'd like to look at Psalms chapter 23 today and I want to speak part two of Last Night Thy word is my shield amen God bless you God bless each and every one of you today amen thank you Matthew thank you to each and every one of you amen amen and you know it's somebody else kills a deer I'm just as happy for them and I'm just as happy then as I am for I've never been one of those jealous guys jealousy wasn't put in my being in no way I've never been jealous of money never been jealous of my wife I've never been jealous of my family I've never been jealous of you I I do have a Godly jealousy I do have that but I'm just thankful when someone else gets an animal I'm happy when I hear you guys and y'all send me a picture when you get one I'm just just as happy then as I am even for this animal and this animal turned out to be one of the biggest animals I've ever killed he weighed 245 lbs and he was a he was a nice animal he's already in the freezer and so we're we're looking forward to enjoying him as well amen amen Psalms chapter 23 this morning and uh you just helped me and as Connie said you we'll get through it so if you help me I we'll get through this and so Psalms 23 and verse one the Lord is my shepherd maybe we read this together the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pasture he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the pth of righteousness for his name's sake and yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with all and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever Romans chap 8 and verse 28 some of my favorite scriptures amen could we read this together this morning again and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and more moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we not with him also give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or n nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're accounted a sheep for a Slaughter nay in all of these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord may God bless the reading of his word won't you turn to somebody and say I love you in the love of the Lord amen amen amen you can be seated today amen amen is a lady here today that was sitting behind sister Nancy last night amen she's not here she's not here brother Alden well I thought that was Sister nany's phone going off last night and it was her phone and I was going to apologize to her but it was still funny to me amen amen God bless you Revelations 3 and verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into to him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne Revelation chap chapter 19 and verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ar raay and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called to the unto the married supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God Revelation 21 and verse 5 and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give un to him that is a thirst the Fountain of Water of Life freely and he that over cometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son could we say Amen to that Andrew sang a song a little while and it came to me and I I maybe I could just find it real quick I said this to my family this last week I dreamed this morning that we was boarding a ship called Zion we you and his family and all of our families as I entered I saw Katie grab her mother dabie they were screaming and jumping and she kept saying I told you I believed we were all so excited Katie is beautiful but I've never seen her that beautiful it blew me away with the whole thing our young girls were dancing circles and holding hands I saw such a Caren with all of their family it was a feeling Beyond a feeling the announcement was wa made over a seem like a system saying this Voyage means something I thought I was being lifted William and all of his children with us and as far as I could see all of us as Believers was standing there together I literally thought like I was leaving the room little did I I know in a few moments that later we would we would get that animal I believe we've come to a time where we've turned a corner that everything that we' preached and everything that we've talked about we're getting ready to experience amen Israel is in a fight for their life they're in a fight for their Nation they're in a fight they don't don't realize they don't realize even sometimes what they're fighting for but God is with them God is with them I made this statement last night be careful this is more than a political battle amen there'll be a lot of people that'll be killed and destroyed but God's greater than the human element is greater than all of that even as I said last night in one day God killed 85,000 people that came to fight against Israel sometimes we get kind of caught up against different things and different get pulled different ways but let me just remind you God is on those Jews [Music] side and in the big picture we're going to live there right amen what they're fighting over you and I are going to live there all right Amen in just the short matter there's going to be two prophets that'll come back to those Jews and they're going to preach in that land and so what the Palestinians are wanting is the piece of property called that that is the The Mountaintop to where that that the Temple Mount is there and so they all believe listen it's a it's a thousands of years old war and that's what you're seeing is is all of those Nations will gather against Israel thank God that our nation for this moment is standing with Israel because that means that we as a nation will be blessed and we as a people will be blessed but all of that should tell us that we must get ready The Old Ship of Zion is coming it's coming men is of with your family remind in your devotions at home remind your children just like the men with Moses reminded their family they had to token applied the death angels are coming the death angel was coming and if the blood was not applied let me just say I don't want to stay here in the tribulation period I do not want to stay I wanna I want to go amen and there's no I I'll be honest with you there's nothing in this world there's nothing in this world worth staying for amen amen God bless you this morning in the scripture reading I want to read a couple of scriptures to you again who shall separate us from the love of Christ and I want you to notice these next words and that's verse 36 sister Stephanie who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or perilous sword as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're counted as sheep for a Slaughter nay in all of these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us this is a prayer and I'll share it with you Lord Jesus Christ you're the name that is above every name you're the name that like a fortified Tower in which I can find Safety and Security when I am troubled I can find peace in your name when I am weak I can find strength in your name when I am overwhelmed I can find rest in your name when I am surrounded by pressures on every side I can find stability in your name your name is Beautiful Lord help me to rely on you through the Jesus Christ Our Lord amen last night I just told a little story and I'll share it with you again this morning there was a little boy standing on a street corner he was standing there stomping his foot amen and somebody walked up to him and said what are you stomping your foot for and he says I'm keeping away elephants and the fell said you know he said there's not an elephant for thousands of miles away from here they're in they're in Africa he said I'm doing a good job ain't I amen you know you can't fight somebody else's trial you sure can't do that and so many times we go well if I was him or if I was her well you really don't know what you would do Paul the Apostle had a condition with his eyes and it oozed those eyes oozed with with great they would swell and they would actually come to a place to where they he would almost become blind with it and here he was preaching Divine Healing he's the first prophet he seen the pillar of fire some some term it even brother brandom and brother bossworth had a disagreement over what it really was some said it was was a condition of an allergy some said it because he saw the pillar of fire it caused it regardless of what caused it he had to deal with it the scripture said that he prayed Thrice that this condition would leave him and as he prayed God reminded him that my grace is sufficient for you I don't have Paul's battle and Paul don't have my battle but God's grace and many of you go through trials that I don't know how you make it through and I just pray for you but God's grace is incredibly sufficient for you listen it's his strength that we need every day of our life we come from the southern area and we we are still fighting the Civil War here it's the way it seems sometimes but Stonewall Jackson was one of our great great generals and brother Brown terms him like the Joshua of that day he says and it was at a battle of the American Civil War that a general as Stonewall Jackson how was it that he kept so cool while the B buets was literally being rained down Jackson instantly became grave and earnestly answered my religion belief teaches me to to feel as safe in the battle as in my bed that's quite a statement is it God has fixed the time of my death I do not concern myself about that but to always be ready and after a pause he added looking at his questioner in the face that is the way that all men should live and then all men be equally Brave understand this Jesus was not a philosopher he was not searching for truth he was truth he was not a Mystic he was reality he was not a reformer he was the creator he was not a Visionary he was the light of the world he never reasoned he knew I think this is so powerful amen he was never in a hurry he was never afraid he never showed weakness he never hesitated he was always ready he was always sure there was shess in all that he said or he did he had no sense of sin or need of forgetfulness forgiveness he never sought or needed advice he knew why he came he knew from whence he came he knew who he was he knew the father he knew the about heaven he knew where he was going he knew humankind he knew Satan he had no lack he had no limitations he was the very Creator was Jesus Christ we are in Christ we are the members of him Jesus had no fear he had no defeat he did not shrink from Pain and brutal treatment he was the master and when they arrested him he was the master at his trial he was Almighty yet he was just a man and that man lives inside of us quite a statement Veterans Day as we look at it today I am an American I am an American and as American I stand in her shame and I stand in her glory amen and as an American I have citizenship here I carry a a a passport to be able to go into different places I've been able to go across a incredible amount of amount of borders to go some of the borders I were I was carrying material of ministry I was carrying the books of brother brandham I was carrying tapes I literally at one point we made tapes here and I carried a complete uh suitcase completely full of tapes and had I got caught I it went to prison and the guy that the patrol officer opened it up and God blinded his eyes and he closed it up and he zipped it up when I went to China we was watched and they told me to be be be careful and I knew even when our bus was stopped we could spend life in prison I was not ashamed to be a soldier of Jesus Christ and neither am I today I'm proud to be a veteran of this gospel I'm proud to stand with men all over the world that preach the word of God I may be a lot shorter than those men but I stand here and remind the enemy that Dynamite comes in small packages Hallelujah for you that have served in the military I want to say thank you for your service those I I know they're sitting here could you two stand right there where you're at anybody else has served in the service amen amen Donnie won't you stand for us as well let's give these men a great big hand this is when I was putting this together sitting in a hunting blind I thought of you brother Meadows I've read this a few times and brother benos has always commented when I read this I'm a part of the Fellowship of the unashamed I have the holy spirit's power the cast the die has been cast and I have stepped over the line the decision has been made I am a disciple of Jesus Christ I won't look back and let up and show slow down and back away or be still my past is redeemed my presents makes sense my future is secure I am finished and done with low living sight walking smooth knees colorless dreams same Visions worldly talking cheap giving and dwarfed goals I no longer need to be need preeminence Prosperity position promotions Plott and popularity I don't have to be right first tops recognized praised regarded or even rewarded I now live by faith and lean in his presence and walk by patience am uplifted by prayer and labor by power my face is set my gate is fast my goal is heaven my road is narrow my way is rough my companions are few but my God is reliable my mission is clear I cannot be bought compromised detoured headed lured away turned back D diluted or delayed I will not flinch in the face Hallelujah of sacrifice has it in his head hesitate in the presence of that adversary negotiate at the table of the enemy Pander at the PO at the pool of prop uh popularity Meander in the Maze of mediocracy I won't give up shut up led up until I have stayed and stored up prayed up paid up preached up for the cause of Christ I am a disciple of Jesus I will I must go until he comes give live until I drop preach until all I know and work until he stops me and when he comes for his own he will have no problem recognizing me for my banner is clear I am a disciple of Jesus Christ what means a lot to me is this man wrote this down and within 30 days he was martyred for being a missionary and it was found on his desk I think that's incredible I think too quickly we as Mortals subject ourself to the almighty to the court of reason our night times will last only so long before it's swallowed up by the morning and the light will shine again our fight might be difficult it might be hard but morning's going to [Music] come this sermon was sparked by a girl named Ella Ella was born and had a stroke when she was born it's caused great difficulty in her muscular and even in her bone Ella's one one of the most beautiful girls that I've ever known she's brother bisco's granddaughter she has a character as beautiful as she is and just before just before I go any further I've had a lot of time with her and her family and she has not allowed her debilitation to characterize her she could have laid in a bed and be waited on the rest of her life but she's in college she has a job and she sits she sits and many times in a wheelchair she tries to walk but she could sit on the porch and I sat on the porch with her and her grand Dead Brother Ed and many of her family was sitting there and she quoted more scriptures and more quotes of the prophet and I thought to myself in her condition she shakes every devil in hell she had sent me a text the other morning that meant a lot to me and I said Center ATT text the next day and I said I thought much about your words in your life Ella you are a hero if somebody here would just that has her would you just send her a text you might want to listen to the sermon you are a hero it would be easy for you to make excuses and to give up and turn around and go back God knew before we entered the world this world what our challenges would be so he placed the strength in you and us to step forth and accept the challenge I'm proud of you Jesus himself he embraced the cross God built us to overcome am that's right yes amen Winston Churchill steps to the podium and you've heard me say this before and he was standing before thousands the world was falling apart the world was enraged in a Battle Nations and even lines were about to be redrawn we were about to become all Germans amen you just don't realize how close that came had God not stop that waru Veteran Day shouldn't mean a whole lot to you we'd all be Germans and I'm not talking about Christian Germans I'm talking about Nazi Germans cuz the Nazis not only wanted to destroy the Jews they wanted to destroy the Christians and I want to remind you Hamas Hamas not only wants to destroy the Jews and drive them into the sea they want to destroy Christians all over the Earth that's what the war is about Churchill stood up with a world Fallen apart and a war raging he had been introduced as the greatest order of the moern Modern Age and he walks to the podium and screams never give up he pauses for 60 seconds and he screams again never give up and he pauses again for 60 seconds and says never give up that was for military men today I want to stream this out to the Christians and wherever it goes on the stream no matter what your condition is no matter what's going on in your life never give [Applause] up sometimes we as Christians have to shake hell right amen our family has fought Giants even as little boys picking up a rock he wasn't worried about death he picks up five rocks and what you might be interested in is those rocks came as hailstones from heaven and those rocks were smooth because they were hailstones it was in that Valley that 85,000 enemy was killed God knows how to destroy enemy there was a man that carried the gates of the city amen 21,000 lbs Gates he took a dry Jawbone and killed thousands there was another one of our family members that took a six-foot Ox goat a stick he was not a train Warrior he was a believer and he he said I've had enough of your of you coming and destroying me every year and one man kills 600 Philistines one of our family members outran the greatest horses in the land am one of our family members was swallowed by a fish one of our family members was there when God spoke to him told him said what are you crying out to me speak and go forward and a sea opened up and not only did a sea opened up God dried the ground and over two million people and animals walked across there and then not only did God allow them to walk across there the greatest army in the world followed them and God drowned the greatest army in the world [Applause] one of our greatest family members was a farmer and God told him to build an Bo a boat out of the worst wood out of the funniest looking boat that you could have and he kept preaching it's going to rain and science told him it couldn't happen these silly people that came against the message they should have been in Noah's day it has never rained really well see how that worked out for you it's never rained God not only opened the heavens and it rained but he opened the Billows of the earth and those that were in the ark were saved a farmer not an architect built a boat cuz God told him I want to say this you I'll follow God's instructions but our greatest champion he conquered death hell and the grave every one of those stripes at Pilot's judgment Hall when they were beating him the devil inspired those men to beat him like never before and his back opened up to his organs were pump ping out of his back but our champion didn't give up he didn't say I've had enough it was you it was you that was on the mind he did that when your children when your children are being born and doctors said they can't live and God was there as their healer we are proved to us that the weakest of Christians said go on their knees and shake the kingdom of hell I want to remind you today that we are champions want you turn to your neighbor and tell them we are champions you can only fight the fight that comes to you so many people preach against different things but they've never fought it I stand here today with brain cancer lung cancer and cancer in other places the battle was choked somewhere God allowed it to happen so I accept the challenge I accept the challenge I stand here and preach to you with faith and cons and and and courage I walk out when I don't feel like walking out and I stand to you and I do that much because I know that you're facing battles and you got to stay on your feet you got to pull your sword when it don't feel like it you got to have courage to get up and I say this you if you've fallen down and you're in your petty party I want to encourage you and be your cheerleader this morning get up yeah get up keep getting up as Muhammad Ali's cheerleader or his his his coach in the corner would tell him said I didn't have to tell him how to fight I just had to remind him of who he was I don't have to tell you how to fight I have to remind you of who you are I want to I want to just give you a few parallels here just now just in case you've thought you've had some bad days Abraham Lincoln had been defeated 12 times for public office he took the he took the platform of impossible odds and he ran for president of the United States of America his picture was all over it was the first time that they used paper to put up placards a 12year old little girl sent him a letter and said you look too immature grow a beard so you can learn things from a 12-year-old child and he grew a beard let me just say this to you we're anointed for the challenge the scripture says that his strength is made perfect in weakness his strength is made perfect in weakness brother Ron but I've got critics but it's your critics that call you the masterpiece M now think about how bad that you torment the kingdom of Hell regardless of what he throws at you you're still standing right Boo devil don't you just say that right there boo devil I've read this before and I'll read it again may all hell may all hell celebrate the Day I die cuz I will torment them no more fny Christ belied to be 95 years old she was blind she would write most of the songs that we would sing even today this is one of the statements that she made if I had a choice I would choose I would still choose to remain blind for when I die the first face that I see will be the face of my blessed savior one of the next statements became became a song Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of Glory Divine I'm an heir of Salvation I'm purchased of God washed in his Spirit cleansed by his blood many people have told me that I look like a man called Teddy Teddy Roosevelt if I had a quarter for everyone I could probably buy all of your dinner every time somebody says that I look like him well I could be look like somebody worse than that someone walked into Cracker Barrel and we were all sitting there and she said wow you look like your daddy I turned to Alden who was sitting next to me and I said well I'm glad I don't look like the mailman [Applause] Teddy's ambition he was rich he didn't have to run for public office he wanted Parks all over the United States and in many places in the other places of the world and here's what his ambition was he wanted the most beautiful places to be preserved preserved places parks to give us an image of what heaven what heaven will be like he was getting ready to make a speech you know what that speech was the man in the arena and it was a huge thousands and thousands of people were there and he felt something thump him and he realized that he was shot put his hand in his vest he always wore a three-piece suit I don't do it for Teddy but I wear a three-piece suit everywhere I go most of that is for so you can't see how fat I am or how skinny I am that's a truth but he was shot in the chest and he said I've been shot we'll tend to that a bit later one of the reasons that the shot didn't kill him was he had a he had a speech in there called The Man in the arena and the bullet went through the speech and it landed in his rib cage they'd never be able to get it out he lived with that bullet for the rest of his life and instead of saying I've been shot I'm going home he stood there and spoke for 84 minutes as blood ran down and dripped on his pants let me just say this to you we've had incredible examples in front of us to never give up there was a man named Glenn Cunningham as a little boy he was burned by a hot stove in the house his the coals came out on his legs and when they got him to the hospital the doctors immediately made a made a statement your legs will never return to normal we need to we need to cut your legs off he said no I don't want you to cut my legs off uh I want you to leave them there and and literally an incredible time was spent and he would go home and not be able to walk and not be able to do anything and he would sit in a wheelchair and get himself up in a wheelchair he would roll himself out in the front yard and while he'd be in the front yard he would come to the picket fence and he would watch all the children playing going backwards and forwards and and he said I want to walk again and what he would do is he would grab that fi picket fence and he would pull himself up and he would stand there and watch those children go by and day by day by day by day in quite a long time and after a while he took his first step he got courage to take another step and got courage to take another step and before long Glenn was going all over that yard and Glenn after a while was not just walking he was running amen the long of that story was Glenn Cunningham whose legs were supposed to come off became an Olympic runner and he was the first man in the Olympics to run a 4minute mile don't tell me about excuses reach down inside of you and pull yourself up ask God for strength he can give us strength ask God for courage he can give us courage brother bcll many years ago heard about a man speaking in his area and he wanted to go see this man the courage that he had and the strength that he had this man was known as the smartest man to ever live his name was Steven Hawkins among all the scientists he proved that there was a god it made every scientist mad but he proved that there was a god quoting Hebrews chapter 1 and let me just say this chapter 11 verse 1 let me just say this to you he had every excuse in the world not to do anything he was a man that had had a condition to where that it came down till he didn't have the strength to move his legs didn't have the strength to move his arms he could not talk he could not utter so he would whisper through a computer that he helped develop listen with with his scientific mind you are different people today am because of what he accomplished in his life every one of us are live in a better world because that man overcame his battle Psalms chapter 17 and verse1 15 I as for me I will Behold thy face in righteousness I shall be satisfied when I'm awake with thy likeness job CH 23 and verse 10 but he knoweth the way that I take and when he ha tried me I shall come forth as go now let me just say this you when God said let there be there was results God believed his own words and when God gives us the opportunity to to utter the words of God by his stripes we are healed that's not our words that's God's words God swore by himself when he could swear by no greater he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth he deposited himself on the inside of you I'm glad of that aren't you you that's a great big statement he deposited himself on the inside of you when nobody else thinks you're important God said you were when he said let there be a sun and let there be moons and let there be Stars those stars are reflection in the darkest of Night of the light of the sun you are reflection of God on the earth no matter how bad this world is no matter how horrible this world is you are a reflection of God am many people but don't believe in God I am a reflection that he [Applause] lives God put something on the inside of us is called determination we refuse to give up we refuse to back down as a matter of fact we will never never never never quit we're built by God and just like he released the planets and the stars from the Sun itself We're The Offspring of God and God released us into this age I was born in 1961 62 years old for those that want to add but let me just say this you I refuse to retire let this light shine before men that they might see your good works and glorify God in heaven so
