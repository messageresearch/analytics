[24:56] remembering that those times that are

[25:30] 22846 and I believe that's on our church
[25:32] Facebook page and then if you would have
[25:35] any questions on directions or how to
[25:37] get there just ask one of the members
[25:41] here uh we'll have some youth events and
[25:44] different things going on so just be
[25:46] remembering those things but remember
[25:48] this is a school it's not a church but
[25:51] we're going to have church there amen so
[25:54] it is a public school so rules do apply
[25:57] at those School schs and uh and public
[26:01] buildings so just be mindful of those
[26:03] things don't let your children be
[26:05] wandering uh there will be uh limits to
[26:08] the building uh parking will be assisted
[26:12] with our brothers and those uh have been
[26:15] made mention to who we will be using for

[26:28] children at all times go to the restroom
[26:32] with them um don't be letting them run
[26:34] up and down the
[26:36] hallways and uh just be mindful of that

[26:42] for the families with smaller children
[26:47] and or anyone that would have health
[26:49] issues as far as those things go we'd
[26:53] like for you to come in slide into the

[27:11] front and back are carpeted but within
[27:14] the seating it is tiled so just be

[27:35] that before we get here amen and uh
[27:39] there is a water fountain at the church
[27:42] but if you would happen to have a water
[27:44] metal water bottle and it rolls stings
[27:46] ding ding ding ding ding ding all the

[27:50] front brother Gabe just got himself a
[27:52] new water

[59:52] the church said and the bride said amen
[59:56] may God richly bless you if you have
[59:58] your Bibles this evening we'd like to
[1:00:00] look over in a few portions of scripture
[1:00:03] in the book of Exodus chapter 3 and
[1:00:06] Hebrews chap
[1:00:08] 11 you could just find those those spots
[1:00:12] there for us this this evening we' like
[1:00:14] to draw your attention to the word we
[1:00:16] realize that no service is complete
[1:00:18] without the reading of the
[1:00:21] word
[1:00:24] amen amen
[1:00:26] Exodus chapter 3 I I don't want you to
[1:00:29] get Disturbed tonight by by the sound
[1:00:33] system I don't want you get disturbed by
[1:00:34] the brothers working here tonight I I I
[1:00:36] give them full Liberty to work this
[1:00:39] entire audience as they need to but I
[1:00:41] want you to I want you to be very
[1:00:44] attentive I believe that you're not just
[1:00:46] you're not just ordinary churchgoers
[1:00:49] you're the kind of people that you can
[1:00:50] press through the the distractions and
[1:00:53] you can find what God has for you amen
[1:00:57] amen I'd like to I'd like to just draw
[1:00:59] our attention uh one more time uh on
[1:01:03] this thought that that we spoke a little
[1:01:05] bit on last weekend on the vision the
[1:01:08] vision of the word and I'd like to just
[1:01:10] just maybe dive into these things by the
[1:01:12] help of the Lord here this evening in
[1:01:15] Exodus chapter 3 it says now Moses kept
[1:01:17] the flock of Jethro his father-in-law
[1:01:19] the priest of Midian and he led the
[1:01:21] flock to the backside of the desert and
[1:01:24] he came to the Mountain of God even to
[1:01:25] herb and the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:01:28] unto him in a flame of fire out of the
[1:01:31] midst of a bush and he looked and behold
[1:01:34] the bush burned with fire and the Bush
[1:01:37] was not consumed and Moses said I will
[1:01:41] now turn aside and see this great sight
[1:01:44] and I want you to draw your attention to
[1:01:46] that word that word I will now turn
[1:01:49] aside and see this great sight if you
[1:01:51] look that word up in the Hebrew it means
[1:01:54] Vision it means the sight of the
[1:01:57] phenomena it's a spectacular appearance
[1:02:00] it is a supernatural event it is the
[1:02:04] power of seeing that Moses said I will
[1:02:07] now turn aside and see this great
[1:02:10] Supernatural sight while the bush is not
[1:02:13] burnt and when the Lord saw that he
[1:02:15] turned aside to see God God called unto
[1:02:19] him out of the midst of the Bush and
[1:02:21] said Moses Moses and he said here am I
[1:02:24] and he said drawn now hither put off thy
[1:02:27] shoes from off thy feet for the place
[1:02:30] whereon thou standest is Holy Ground
[1:02:32] moreover he said I am the god of the
[1:02:34] Father the god of Abraham the god of
[1:02:38] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[1:02:42] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[1:02:44] God when you look in that that scripture
[1:02:46] verse six right there it's enough to
[1:02:49] shout the whole service down to be
[1:02:50] honest with you that the god that
[1:02:53] Abraham was talking to and the god of
[1:02:55] that Isaac was talking to is the god
[1:02:58] that was talking to Moses now Hebrews
[1:03:01] 11: 24 says it like this by faith
[1:03:06] Moses we' say it like this by Revelation
[1:03:10] Moses when he was come to years refused
[1:03:13] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[1:03:16] daughter choosing rather to suffer
[1:03:17] Affliction with the people of God than
[1:03:19] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a SE a
[1:03:22] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:03:26] greater riches than the treasure in
[1:03:29] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[1:03:32] recompense of the
[1:03:33] reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[1:03:37] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:03:40] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[1:03:45] may God bless his word you may be seated
[1:03:47] here in the presence of the Lord as we
[1:03:49] said we like to speak to you on the
[1:03:51] vision the vision of the word if you
[1:03:53] look here in this in this scripture
[1:03:55] reading in verse 27 of Hebrews that by
[1:03:59] faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the
[1:04:01] Wrath of the king for he endured as
[1:04:03] seeing him as seeing him who is
[1:04:06] invisible and you look at that word in
[1:04:08] the Greek it is horo which means to see
[1:04:11] it means to behold it means to perceive
[1:04:14] it means to see with the eyes or to see
[1:04:17] with the mind I love this I love this
[1:04:19] translation it means to become
[1:04:22] acquainted with by an experience it
[1:04:24] means to EXP experience to look on and I
[1:04:28] love what what the writers say here that
[1:04:30] he said no this word gives prominence to
[1:04:34] the Discerning mind when the physical
[1:04:36] side recedes this word denotes
[1:04:39] perception this word denotes perception
[1:04:42] and looking that Paul by or by by Moses
[1:04:46] by Revelation he was able to forsake the
[1:04:49] things that he know not fearing the
[1:04:52] wrath of Satan but he was able to be
[1:04:54] able to pierce into another Realm by
[1:04:57] looking through the eyesight of not by
[1:04:59] his natural eyesight but he was able to
[1:05:02] pierce through it by the perception of
[1:05:05] Revelation because he had an experience
[1:05:07] that he recognized that he wasn't alone
[1:05:09] up there on that mountain it wasn't
[1:05:11] something that happened in his mind but
[1:05:13] it was an actual experience and I know
[1:05:15] that that word sometimes it it scares
[1:05:17] people but Moses had an experience with
[1:05:20] almighty God right there on top of that
[1:05:21] mountain it it influenced his life in
[1:05:24] such a way that that it pressed him to
[1:05:26] be able to go against everything that he
[1:05:29] ever knew and everything that he had
[1:05:30] been raised up and everything that he
[1:05:32] consciously knew in his mind he was able
[1:05:34] to thwart by the power of that
[1:05:37] Revelation now the prophet said here in
[1:05:39] a hidden life he said we've held this
[1:05:41] ground for so long he said I believe
[1:05:44] with all of my heart that we're on the
[1:05:46] threshold of stepping into another Veil
[1:05:48] Yonder somewhere to where the great
[1:05:51] mysteries of God will be made known to
[1:05:53] the church he said and for me I've got
[1:05:55] both ears and both he said I got both
[1:05:57] ears and eyes and heart open to the hear
[1:06:00] the message when it comes to examine it
[1:06:02] he said for Satan will put out many a
[1:06:04] false Runner but just lay it aside
[1:06:07] remember it's only signifying that
[1:06:09] something real is going to take place
[1:06:12] when you see it he said for Satan will
[1:06:14] do everything to blockade the real Jewel
[1:06:17] of God when it's coming forth you'll
[1:06:19] hear it you he'll put a blockade to
[1:06:21] catch Abel he put a blockade to catch
[1:06:24] Abel he put one out to cat Joseph he put
[1:06:27] one out to catch Jesus and so forth he
[1:06:29] put one out to get Moses for you can
[1:06:31] notice that those things that Satan will
[1:06:34] try to block it well you say well what
[1:06:36] are you saying there brother Andrew I'm
[1:06:37] saying just exactly like William
[1:06:40] brandham said it that when Satan comes
[1:06:42] to block it you've got to open your eyes
[1:06:44] and your ears and heart to hear the
[1:06:46] message when it comes to examine the
[1:06:49] message because when Satan comes to
[1:06:51] block the message that's the only thing
[1:06:53] to do is to open your ears and your eyes
[1:06:56] and your heart to be able to understand
[1:06:58] what the message is doing now I I I I
[1:07:00] find it amazing that this week that I
[1:07:03] the Lord had dealt with me on this
[1:07:04] thought a couple weeks or a week and a
[1:07:06] half ago on the vision of the word and I
[1:07:09] find it amazing this opening up the
[1:07:11] first part of the week I had something
[1:07:14] that had never happened to me I
[1:07:15] completely went completely almost blind
[1:07:18] in my right eye I was looking through a
[1:07:20] looking through a fog and I was I
[1:07:22] couldn't see I thought I had something
[1:07:23] in my eye I thought it was my contact or
[1:07:25] I so I flushed it out and it still
[1:07:26] didn't get no better and actually went
[1:07:28] to the eye doctor cuz I thought well I
[1:07:30] need to make sure something ain't wrong
[1:07:32] here it was like I was constantly
[1:07:33] looking through a fog it wouldn't go
[1:07:35] away it wouldn't go away and so I went
[1:07:37] to the doctor and by the time that you
[1:07:39] know how you know how your body does by
[1:07:40] the time you get to the doctor you're
[1:07:41] almost better and so and so I I go there
[1:07:44] and I'm starting to see more clearly as
[1:07:46] I go as I'm going and a doctor does all
[1:07:49] these kinds of tests and he's looking at
[1:07:50] my eye and checking everything and does
[1:07:52] all of his doing doing all of his
[1:07:54] instruments and checking everything
[1:07:56] but he he but he begins to tell me he
[1:07:57] said now he said what you have
[1:07:59] experienced is what they call a retinal
[1:08:01] migraine or an an optical migrain that
[1:08:04] people actually experience a a com a
[1:08:06] blindness sometimes and if you look it
[1:08:08] up online it's pretty it's pretty
[1:08:10] amazing you be able to look through my
[1:08:11] eyes just like I don't even know how
[1:08:13] they got that picture through somebody
[1:08:15] eyes but that's pretty amazing but
[1:08:16] anyways they it's literally like looking
[1:08:18] through a fog like a rainbows completely
[1:08:20] all around it and you're almost blind
[1:08:22] and and the doctor be to explain and he
[1:08:24] started preaching to me he started
[1:08:26] preaching he said what it is he said
[1:08:28] it's he said what happens he said when
[1:08:29] you have an optimal migraine or an
[1:08:31] optical migraine he said what it is he
[1:08:33] said you got two blood vessels that are
[1:08:35] running to your eyes that are on the
[1:08:36] back of your neck he said what happens
[1:08:38] when you have that kind of migraine he
[1:08:40] said it's a blood vessel back there
[1:08:42] that's beginning to get blocked that
[1:08:43] that you can't see out of that ey out of
[1:08:45] that eye but as as you maybe you got
[1:08:48] dehydrated or maybe you didn't eat
[1:08:49] enough for this that or the other he
[1:08:51] said it could have CA could been caused
[1:08:52] by something else he said but when that
[1:08:54] blood begins to flow flow freely you'll
[1:08:57] be able to see freely again and I
[1:08:59] sitting there and I heard that man
[1:09:01] preaching to me and here he here he had
[1:09:03] one of them DDS and phds to be able to
[1:09:05] preach to me and I was sitting there
[1:09:06] Gathering sermons on the vision of the
[1:09:08] word and I thought that's exactly how
[1:09:10] Satan does he tries to block up the
[1:09:12] blood of Jesus Christ in our life to
[1:09:14] keep us from seeing what the word wants
[1:09:16] us to see but if we can ever get to a
[1:09:19] spot where maybe we got to a spot of
[1:09:21] dehydration or we wasn't eaten the
[1:09:23] message just right if we can ever get it
[1:09:26] back to a spot where the blood can flow
[1:09:28] again then you can start seeing clearly
[1:09:30] again I say I say this unto you that if
[1:09:33] you've ever went to a spot where you
[1:09:35] can't see the message and its true
[1:09:37] Vision go back to where the blood
[1:09:40] is go back to where the blood is I I
[1:09:43] just I just come into my mind just now
[1:09:45] you remember when brother Wayne Lawson
[1:09:47] was here he he dropped it one time he
[1:09:49] said I was he said I was out running he
[1:09:51] said I was out running he said I was
[1:09:53] running down through air and he said I
[1:09:54] got to a spot the sweat got in my eye
[1:09:56] and he said I I started to wipe the
[1:09:58] sweat he said but all of a sudden he
[1:10:00] said I think it's how I said it he said
[1:10:02] all of a sudden he said it begun to come
[1:10:04] to my mind he said about Jesus on the
[1:10:06] cross he said there he said I was able
[1:10:09] to rub the sweat out of my eyes but
[1:10:11] Jesus on the cross had his nails had his
[1:10:13] hands nailed up there to that cross so
[1:10:16] that so that he couldn't rub the eye he
[1:10:18] couldn't rub his eyes when the blood was
[1:10:20] dropping down over top of his eye
[1:10:22] because the crown of the Thorns that was
[1:10:24] on his head and the blood blood was
[1:10:25] Dripping over his eyes and when the
[1:10:27] people were out there and they were
[1:10:28] screaming and mocking him brother Wayne
[1:10:31] said it like this he said he didn't see
[1:10:33] them through his natural eye but he saw
[1:10:35] them through the blood oh if we can ever
[1:10:38] see what God wants us to see through the
[1:10:40] blood of Jesus Christ I say it's what
[1:10:42] Satan wants to keep us from it's because
[1:10:45] the blood has got the power to make you
[1:10:48] look clean act clean dress clean that's
[1:10:51] why Satan is wanting to hinder the
[1:10:53] Church of the Living God from the Life
[1:10:55] Source the power the supernatural event
[1:10:59] of the
[1:11:04] blood now Jesus was speaking to his
[1:11:07] disciples he begins to teach them and he
[1:11:09] begins to take them through Matthew 13
[1:11:11] and he begins to preach to them about
[1:11:13] the soore and the seed he begins to
[1:11:15] teach them and they begin to ask him
[1:11:16] some questions said why do you speak to
[1:11:19] the people in Parables and Jesus said it
[1:11:21] like this he said it's given to you to
[1:11:23] know the mysteries of the kingdom of of
[1:11:25] God but to them it's not given and he
[1:11:28] went on to say but blessed are your eyes
[1:11:30] for you see and your ears for they hear
[1:11:33] he said many prophets and righteous men
[1:11:36] have desired to see those things which
[1:11:37] you see and have not seen them and hear
[1:11:40] those things which you hear and have not
[1:11:42] heard them to say that you're a blessed
[1:11:45] people tonight is an understatement to
[1:11:46] be able to see what you see hear what
[1:11:48] you hear understand what you understand
[1:11:52] you see he spoke to them in Parables of
[1:11:54] something that was comparison that was
[1:11:56] close in line with it but they didn't
[1:11:58] understand what he was saying about it I
[1:12:00] think it's amazing that you can look
[1:12:01] through the Through The Eyes of the word
[1:12:03] and you can see what Jesus is wanting
[1:12:05] you to
[1:12:08] see you know it's like a it's like a key
[1:12:11] it's like a key to a door you can have
[1:12:14] that key to your home you get that key
[1:12:17] both unlocks and it locks you can do it
[1:12:20] in both purposes and brother random
[1:12:22] would say it like this he said it's too
[1:12:24] long that the church has forgot that
[1:12:27] vision of what it is to unlock and to
[1:12:30] lock back up he said what it is he said
[1:12:33] they have forgot the power to bind and
[1:12:35] they forgot the power to
[1:12:37] loose but I find it amazing when the
[1:12:40] prophet I'm not going to go completely
[1:12:42] through it but when the prophet starts
[1:12:43] talking about the vision of the Silver
[1:12:45] Tip grizzly bear he's already killed the
[1:12:47] 42inch caribou and he's walking there
[1:12:49] with Bud Southwick and Bud says it's
[1:12:51] about time that that that silver CP
[1:12:53] grizzly bear shows up ain't it brother
[1:12:55] Bram he said bud I believe you're
[1:12:56] doubting that I believe you're doubting
[1:12:58] that he said and all of a sudden he said
[1:13:01] Bud said brother brandham so help me
[1:13:04] there's a great big Silver Tip standing
[1:13:06] right there and the prophet said this he
[1:13:08] said you see the key of it is the vision
[1:13:11] of the word of the Lord he said there's
[1:13:13] nothing can change it or nothing can
[1:13:15] stop it he said that's what the church
[1:13:17] needs today it's not an education what
[1:13:20] the church needs is not a denomination
[1:13:23] what the church need is not is not a
[1:13:25] Creed what the church needs is the key
[1:13:28] to the scriptures the door which Christ
[1:13:31] is a door and he is a word and faith in
[1:13:33] the word of God unlocks every
[1:13:36] door faith in God's word unlocks every
[1:13:39] door to give us the key you see the key
[1:13:42] to open up this door of revelation of
[1:13:45] this hour is the message it's a message
[1:13:48] of this hour and if you're struggling
[1:13:51] with the things of this world the
[1:13:53] message unlocks the do to it I don't
[1:13:56] care if you're dealing with depression I
[1:13:58] don't care if you're dealing with
[1:13:59] sickness I don't care what you're
[1:14:00] dealing with in this layot of and age
[1:14:02] the message unlocks the door to give you
[1:14:05] overcoming
[1:14:08] power
[1:14:11] Hallelujah I believe that as human
[1:14:13] beings that we realize as humans that we
[1:14:17] are influenced by what we see I think
[1:14:19] it's very hard for us not to be
[1:14:21] influenced by what we see it it's kind
[1:14:24] of like like a man that's constantly
[1:14:26] watching his he constantly watching his
[1:14:29] bank account and it's constantly
[1:14:30] draining down it's constantly going down
[1:14:32] it begins to dwindle out and begins to
[1:14:34] he begins to look at that financial
[1:14:36] statement he begins to look in there and
[1:14:38] he begins to get influenced by what he
[1:14:40] sees and all of a sudden a real man of
[1:14:43] God he he he gets influenced by what he
[1:14:45] sees and he said well I better not pay
[1:14:46] my ti because I'm going to run myself
[1:14:49] short but a man that is influenced by
[1:14:52] the word of God says whether whether I
[1:14:54] can't make it or not God's my partner in
[1:14:57] this you see in contrast that's what
[1:15:00] faith does it makes him look not at the
[1:15:03] circumstances not in his problems not in
[1:15:06] his situation you could choose a million
[1:15:08] things right there you could take a man
[1:15:10] that's sick and if he keeps constantly
[1:15:12] looking at his sickness instead of
[1:15:13] looking at the word of God he's
[1:15:15] influenced by what he sees but the
[1:15:19] Christian is not influenced in this worm
[1:15:21] of mortality he is influenced in the
[1:15:24] realm of the heavens but I think it's
[1:15:27] amazing how quickly you change your tune
[1:15:30] by according to what you see because you
[1:15:32] can be in defeat you can be in despair
[1:15:35] you can be without hope but all of a
[1:15:37] sudden you let somebody catch you a
[1:15:39] vision and show you that there's a God
[1:15:41] that's on your side it quickly changes
[1:15:44] your tune now we got scripture to back
[1:15:46] up what we're talking about just like
[1:15:47] when Gaza is standing up there with
[1:15:49] Elijah and he saw the circumstance in
[1:15:52] front of him and he got worried and he
[1:15:54] said a last m
[1:15:55] how shall we do this Syrian our army is
[1:15:58] coming up here to attack us but I love
[1:16:01] what the prophet did he changed his
[1:16:04] vision to match what the word already
[1:16:06] said was there in one place William
[1:16:09] brandham said that Elijah didn't even
[1:16:11] see them Angels up there he said but he
[1:16:14] knew because Psalms 34 said that the
[1:16:16] angels of the Lord would be encamped
[1:16:18] about him the prophet knew that he would
[1:16:21] be
[1:16:23] there Hallelujah
[1:16:25] so I say this to you it doesn't matter
[1:16:27] whether you see them here tonight or not
[1:16:29] it doesn't matter whether you feel them
[1:16:31] here tonight or not there are angels
[1:16:33] that are encamped about the Church of
[1:16:35] the Living God no matter what your
[1:16:37] situation is realize there's a promise
[1:16:39] that is bigger than your situation no
[1:16:42] matter what you're looking
[1:16:45] at the prophet would preach a very
[1:16:48] powerful message I'm going to lay some
[1:16:50] things in here and we're going to preach
[1:16:52] but the but the prophet would preach a
[1:16:54] message on look he said when you hear
[1:16:57] the word it usually somebody trying to
[1:17:00] get you to see what they're looking at
[1:17:02] they say to you look and he says they're
[1:17:04] trying to get you to look at the scene
[1:17:06] whether it's a mountain or or a cactus
[1:17:08] or this that or the other he said but
[1:17:09] they're trying to get your attention to
[1:17:11] look at what they're saying and the
[1:17:13] prophet said now everybody's looking
[1:17:15] today everybody's looking for something
[1:17:17] everybody's looking for something to
[1:17:18] happen he said we know the world is
[1:17:20] constantly watching the skies the radar
[1:17:22] and the screens that we have we have up
[1:17:24] around the world
[1:17:25] Every Nation for its own defense has got
[1:17:27] a Magic Eye like looking to find
[1:17:30] something to appear to this screen like
[1:17:32] an atomic missile or something they've
[1:17:34] got something there to go back to the
[1:17:36] one that sent it that way he said but
[1:17:38] everything is a looking the Ford
[1:17:40] companies's looking to make a better for
[1:17:41] the Chevrolet is looking to make a
[1:17:43] better Chevrolet he said Phoenix is
[1:17:45] making looking to make a bigger and
[1:17:46] larger town he said but the nation is
[1:17:49] looking for more territory so that it
[1:17:51] can spread itself he said the church is
[1:17:54] looking for more more
[1:17:56] members but the bride is looking for the
[1:17:58] coming of her Lord we're all looking he
[1:18:01] said but it depends on what the voice is
[1:18:04] trying to tell you to look for so it
[1:18:07] depends if I tell you to look for an
[1:18:09] apple up here you're not going to find
[1:18:11] it but if I tell you to look for the
[1:18:14] word by your
[1:18:17] eyesight not your natural eye but the
[1:18:20] spiritual heart it'll make you look past
[1:18:22] what you see it'll make you think that's
[1:18:25] what you
[1:18:26] think it's like Moses when he was up
[1:18:29] there he didn't realize what he was
[1:18:31] doing Sister Sarah but he was literally
[1:18:33] walking into a vision he didn't realize
[1:18:35] what he was doing up there he thought he
[1:18:37] was just up up there just being a
[1:18:39] Shepherd again on another on that same
[1:18:40] Mountain that he'd been up there before
[1:18:43] but he was walking into a vision i' say
[1:18:46] that sometimes we walk into church and
[1:18:48] don't realize that were walking right in
[1:18:49] step with the music he said but one day
[1:18:53] he said when he was up there on the back
[1:18:54] side of the desert what he lacked the
[1:18:56] burning bush had and he said Moses saw a
[1:19:00] vision of the word that was God and when
[1:19:03] he did the vision spoke the word and he
[1:19:05] said I remember my
[1:19:08] promise that was all Moses needed right
[1:19:11] there said I remember my promise that I
[1:19:15] made to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and
[1:19:18] Moses saw the vision of it it's amazing
[1:19:22] when you begin to look at the scriptures
[1:19:23] and look at the parallels of the the
[1:19:24] time that the first Exodus started by a
[1:19:28] prophet meeting the pillar of fire and
[1:19:30] the Third Exodus starts by the prophet
[1:19:33] meeting that same Angel of the Covenant
[1:19:36] we could say it like this that Moses was
[1:19:39] fellowshipping with
[1:19:40] Elohim to think that when Moses is
[1:19:43] standing there and he's having a
[1:19:45] conversation with the god of Abraham the
[1:19:47] god of Isaac he's having a conversation
[1:19:49] he's talking with
[1:19:51] him and Moses begins to write the first
[1:19:56] five books of the Bible he begins to go
[1:19:59] all the way back there in the Garden of
[1:20:00] Eden and he's sitting down there and he
[1:20:02] sees Adam by Vision he sees Eve my
[1:20:06] vision he sees creation my vision why he
[1:20:10] was having a supernatural charge a an
[1:20:14] experience with the word of God and the
[1:20:17] word of God was taking him through the
[1:20:20] word and teaching him what it was to say
[1:20:23] how it was to be sa whether it was good
[1:20:25] that Moses was writing or whether it was
[1:20:27] bad that Moses was writing Moses was
[1:20:30] writing by
[1:20:34] Vision now think about it it's been 400
[1:20:38] years that they've been in that they've
[1:20:40] been there in Egypt to think how much
[1:20:42] time that had been from Moses all the
[1:20:45] way to Abraham and from Abraham all the
[1:20:48] way to
[1:20:49] Adam but to think that Enoch was there
[1:20:52] fellowshipping with Adam and the Garden
[1:20:54] of Eden and Moses picks that up by the
[1:20:59] word he picks it up by the word and he
[1:21:01] starts teaching he starts laying things
[1:21:04] in because somebody is talking to him
[1:21:08] he's not looking at what he sees he's
[1:21:10] not looking at what he feels he's not
[1:21:12] looking at what Moses sees he's looking
[1:21:15] through the scope of the
[1:21:18] word I hope you hear me preaching to you
[1:21:20] tonight but the vision has got a voice
[1:21:25] the vision's got a voice and the prophet
[1:21:27] said it like this he said when the
[1:21:28] vision speaks he said there's nothing
[1:21:30] that can ever turn it around he said
[1:21:32] it's always perfect it's always perfect
[1:21:35] he said and in praying for the sick
[1:21:36] tonight as we pray for the sick the Lord
[1:21:39] may come to us and give us visions and
[1:21:41] if he does remember the vision does not
[1:21:44] heal the people the vision is only a
[1:21:46] Vindication that the word is
[1:21:50] Right Hallelujah a vision doesn't heal
[1:21:53] you
[1:21:55] a vision only tells you that the word is
[1:21:58] right just like a prophet is a prophet
[1:22:00] is a Divine Seer by the almighty God he
[1:22:04] begins to look at things and he fortells
[1:22:06] things that are to come and the prophet
[1:22:08] would sit there and he would show signs
[1:22:11] and it would do wonders which is a
[1:22:13] Vindication that that man had the
[1:22:15] perfect interpretation of the word of
[1:22:18] God just like when Paul was up there on
[1:22:20] the road to Damascus and is writing down
[1:22:23] there with letters in his carment to
[1:22:25] carry out and to kill every Christian
[1:22:27] that he ever comes up against but
[1:22:29] remember that he meets the same light
[1:22:32] that Moses meets he has an experience
[1:22:35] with the same God that Moses had met and
[1:22:38] he's standing right
[1:22:40] there and he knocks him off of his high
[1:22:43] horse and he hears a voice and he sees a
[1:22:45] man now there's other people the Bible
[1:22:48] said they heard the voice but they
[1:22:50] didn't see no
[1:22:52] man what was it that vision made Paul go
[1:22:55] blind and the word of the Lord came to
[1:22:58] ananas and said unto him there's a man
[1:23:01] that's going down there that's laying
[1:23:04] there that's laying there here's God
[1:23:07] dealing with a man that's a preacher
[1:23:10] that has visions and he shows him a
[1:23:12] vision there's one sa of
[1:23:15] Tarsus he's had an experience with me go
[1:23:18] lay your hands on him that he could
[1:23:19] receive his sight but not only do that
[1:23:22] lay your hands on him so that he can
[1:23:24] receive reive the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:27] Ghost what was it ananas was looking at
[1:23:30] the same vision that Paul was looking at
[1:23:33] but he was looking at it through the
[1:23:34] word of the
[1:23:37] moment now notice what the prophet
[1:23:40] said he said now the way he says this in
[1:23:43] the testimony of raising a dead boy he
[1:23:46] said now the way that I base friends I
[1:23:48] base friends on this as faith I probably
[1:23:51] feel that I might be an amateur in that
[1:23:54] brother if brother manam was an
[1:23:57] amateur what are we he said but where my
[1:24:00] faith is based concerning the gift that
[1:24:03] was given me he said it's by some people
[1:24:05] receive it by Revelation some people
[1:24:07] pick it up out of the word some people
[1:24:09] take it by inspiration he said but mine
[1:24:12] is Vision when I see those Vision happen
[1:24:15] he said there's nothing in the world
[1:24:17] that can change it so the prophet is a
[1:24:21] prophet a Divine seer of the word and
[1:24:23] you know Hallelujah by the word that he
[1:24:26] speaks you can recognize that he is a
[1:24:29] Divine interpreter of the word just like
[1:24:32] Paul he went over there in Egypt and
[1:24:34] studied the word of God for three and a
[1:24:36] half years and he come back preaching
[1:24:39] Jesus stronger than anybody else because
[1:24:42] God was going to take a message down to
[1:24:44] a gentile people just like William
[1:24:46] brandham stood there and was a Divine
[1:24:49] interpreter of the word that he was able
[1:24:51] to look by the scope of the word and
[1:24:53] pull out
[1:24:54] Revelations where did them Revelations
[1:24:57] come
[1:24:59] from they didn't come from this world
[1:25:02] They Came From Another
[1:25:06] Dimension hallelujah how did he say he
[1:25:09] said my my lays in Vision my my gift
[1:25:13] doesn't lay interpretation my gift
[1:25:16] doesn't lay in Inspiration my gift
[1:25:18] doesn't deal than that my gift lays in
[1:25:21] the word by vision and nothing can
[1:25:23] change
[1:25:26] it now let me let me just capture your
[1:25:30] attention for
[1:25:31] a job had every
[1:25:34] disappointment he had every right to
[1:25:36] look at the
[1:25:40] scene he had everything taken from him
[1:25:43] he had his crops burned he had his
[1:25:45] children taken from him he had every bit
[1:25:47] of livestock taken away from
[1:25:50] him but job said that though God slay me
[1:25:54] I'm going to trust him now some of you
[1:25:57] go through stuff and you've been through
[1:25:59] stuff for your whole entire life and you
[1:26:01] say well I'm just going to come to the
[1:26:02] end of it and I'm gonna give up job went
[1:26:05] through everything that you read in 42
[1:26:07] chapters he went through it in one
[1:26:10] year but job did not allow the
[1:26:14] situations that he seen to affect the
[1:26:17] vision of the
[1:26:19] supernatural because job is standing
[1:26:21] there in that situation and he catches a
[1:26:23] re ation and said in my flesh he said I
[1:26:27] know that my redeemer liveth and in my
[1:26:30] flesh I shall see
[1:26:33] God now you got to think about this job
[1:26:37] is not looking at the word job's not
[1:26:40] looking at that in word form because job
[1:26:43] is the very first book that's ever
[1:26:44] written but job is catching that by
[1:26:48] Revelation that he's looking at a vision
[1:26:51] and he sees himself on the other side
[1:26:54] side of Calvary and he sees himself
[1:26:57] standing with
[1:27:00] Jesus Hallelujah he didn't say we're not
[1:27:04] just people that stand up here and quote
[1:27:05] Isaiah 53 and just go on M just shooting
[1:27:10] things off of our mouth just to say
[1:27:11] believe the promise believe the promise
[1:27:13] believe the promise one of these days
[1:27:16] that promise has got to become a vision
[1:27:18] to
[1:27:21] you come on somebody it became a living
[1:27:25] reality to job job sealed his Covenant
[1:27:29] he sealed his life on that that in my
[1:27:32] flesh even though the skin worms toore
[1:27:35] my body in my
[1:27:39] flesh hallelujah we're not just a bunch
[1:27:42] of people that stand up here and quote
[1:27:43] scripture we're not just a bunch of
[1:27:45] people that quote
[1:27:49] quotes come on somebody there's a living
[1:27:52] reality behind the word there's a
[1:27:58] vision what I'm saying to you is when
[1:28:01] you can look past the things that you
[1:28:03] see don't just see it as a promise but
[1:28:06] see it as a possession it's mine that's
[1:28:09] for me and my house it's mine it's my
[1:28:12] belonging it's my possession it's my
[1:28:15] inheritance it's my
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:20] vision because there's a lot of people
[1:28:22] that quote the word
[1:28:24] there's a lot of church goers that quote
[1:28:26] the word there's a lot of message
[1:28:27] Believers that go to church and quote
[1:28:29] the message but what gives Satan real
[1:28:33] trouble is when you see it as
[1:28:45] reality Lord help
[1:28:48] me and I
[1:28:50] know it's pretty amazing that we live in
[1:28:54] the AG the age of the
[1:28:58] eagle that the prophet gives us
[1:29:01] prophetic Vision to be able to look at
[1:29:04] Visions as they break over people's
[1:29:07] lives that he could tell
[1:29:09] you prolific details in their
[1:29:13] life he could tell you their address he
[1:29:16] could tell you where they came from he
[1:29:18] could tell you why they had this Gorder
[1:29:20] he could tell you the certain things
[1:29:22] that were in their life he could get it
[1:29:23] down to a perfect word there's a lot of
[1:29:27] gifts there was a lot of
[1:29:29] Ministries that would stand there and
[1:29:30] say you've got this going on and a lot
[1:29:33] of times because of the supernatural
[1:29:35] element that would be a releas so and
[1:29:38] people would get free under that but
[1:29:40] this what you are under is more than
[1:29:42] just a prophet's Ministry this is more
[1:29:45] than a
[1:29:46] Prophet come on somebody but this is a
[1:29:48] prophet messenger he didn't just come
[1:29:50] here to tell us our address he didn't
[1:29:52] just come here to give us healing he
[1:29:54] didn't just come here to show us that
[1:29:55] Visions were still in the church he
[1:29:57] didn't just come here to give us
[1:29:58] Deliverance he come us to put us in the
[1:30:01] same form that Jesus was in that we can
[1:30:03] operate with the word in our bodies the
[1:30:05] word in our mouth the word in our mind
[1:30:08] the word in our
[1:30:09] soul and he's standing there and you
[1:30:12] realize he said now what is it that
[1:30:14] makes a vision break over somebody he
[1:30:16] said science can't explain it he said we
[1:30:19] don't even realize the atoms that are
[1:30:21] let loose when a vision breaks because
[1:30:24] it's a reality he said we don't realize
[1:30:26] the atoms that are breaking when a
[1:30:28] vision Breaks Loose he said but I know
[1:30:30] this that a vision is to give the
[1:30:32] children
[1:30:35] understanding I love how the prophet
[1:30:37] said it like this he said when Jesus was
[1:30:39] standing there and he's feeding the
[1:30:41] 5,000 he said what atoms did he use what
[1:30:44] things did he cut loose in the
[1:30:46] Supernatural that he could take he could
[1:30:48] take fresh fish and make it cook fish he
[1:30:51] said what Adams did he take and set
[1:30:54] loose so that he could feed the 5,000 it
[1:30:57] wasn't in a vision it was a reality
[1:31:01] because you know you can't E A
[1:31:04] Vision you can't E A Vision but it's got
[1:31:07] to be a reality so if it's that way in
[1:31:10] squirrels what has it got to be I don't
[1:31:13] want to just be William Brandon's Vision
[1:31:15] I want to be the reality of what a
[1:31:18] prophet saw I want to be the vision of
[1:31:23] the word
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:29] for the Bible said that we walk by faith
[1:31:33] and not by
[1:31:35] sight so if we're constantly relying on
[1:31:39] the things that we see we are never
[1:31:41] going to walk by
[1:31:44] faith if we're constantly looking at the
[1:31:47] things that we see if we're always
[1:31:49] looking at the Downy deers if we're
[1:31:51] always looking at the Debbie downers if
[1:31:52] we're always looking at the ISM if we're
[1:31:54] always looking at what this one says or
[1:31:56] that one says then we're never going to
[1:31:58] walk by faith if we're always looking at
[1:32:00] what Satan says instead of what God says
[1:32:03] then we're never going to walk by faith
[1:32:04] but if we walk by faith it doesn't
[1:32:07] matter what we
[1:32:09] see let cancer rage let tumors rage let
[1:32:14] cancer let it do all of its worst but as
[1:32:17] for me I got my vision on a word that's
[1:32:21] never failed
[1:32:25] [Applause]
[1:32:28] I'm not relying on what I see I'm not
[1:32:30] relying on what I feel I'm not relying
[1:32:32] on what I go through I'm
[1:32:35] relying on the
[1:32:39] word the Bible said in Hebrews 1 that
[1:32:43] God who had Sun Times in diverse manner
[1:32:45] spake in times past un the fathers by
[1:32:49] the prophets the prophet said in God
[1:32:52] identified in his characteristics he
[1:32:54] said 'th prophets their Visions
[1:32:56] Vindicated was God's characteristic made
[1:32:59] known by The Prophet's
[1:33:01] Vision he said no man can explain a
[1:33:04] vision he said there's no way of doing
[1:33:06] it it's supernatural he said it's
[1:33:08] something that you see what has been
[1:33:10] what is and what will be and that was
[1:33:13] God's way of sending a man that spoke
[1:33:15] those things and showed those things
[1:33:18] that would come to pass later on in in
[1:33:20] that message he would say but now before
[1:33:23] you can believe the word of that age he
[1:33:25] identifies himself in the
[1:33:27] characteristics see by knowledge by
[1:33:30] Vision he identifies himself in the
[1:33:34] characteristics by Vision he told those
[1:33:38] things that would happen and it happens
[1:33:40] and God said when that happens then you
[1:33:43] believe he has the interpretation of the
[1:33:47] word because the word of the Lord comes
[1:33:50] to this man and then Moses is standing
[1:33:53] there
[1:33:54] he's just a
[1:33:56] Shepherd he's 40 years on the back side
[1:33:58] of a desert running from his
[1:34:00] calling but he's got something powerful
[1:34:03] in his hand that God is going to use and
[1:34:06] You' been through some stuff and the
[1:34:08] things that God has put in your life God
[1:34:10] is going to use
[1:34:12] that to whip the devil to open up the
[1:34:16] Red Sea to swallow up serpents to make
[1:34:19] water turn into blood he's going to take
[1:34:22] the elements of the natural and put it
[1:34:25] in the Supernatural and release the
[1:34:28] spiritual to the
[1:34:31] situation I want to say this to you
[1:34:33] while the anointing of God is here
[1:34:35] you're already free if I can say it to
[1:34:37] you you're free you're free free at last
[1:34:42] free
[1:34:48] indeed come on I ain't waiting till
[1:34:51] Labor Day meetings I'm not waiting till
[1:34:53] next week I'm free right now I'm Healed
[1:34:57] right now I'm delivered right
[1:35:00] now why not the Supernatural is here the
[1:35:04] presence of God is here the angels are
[1:35:06] here but the redeemed of the Lord is
[1:35:12] here somebody give God
[1:35:19] praise Hallelujah Satan can come fear
[1:35:23] can come
[1:35:24] anxiety can come but I got a
[1:35:27] vision I got
[1:35:35] Clarity what he telling me he said take
[1:35:37] the natural things and throw the natural
[1:35:40] things down and watch them swallow
[1:35:43] up come on somebody why don't you take
[1:35:46] your problems and throw them
[1:35:49] down but when you take it up this time
[1:35:51] don't take it up like you threw it down
[1:35:53] take it up in the name of
[1:35:57] Jesus come on somebody you might see a
[1:35:59] snake laying there but on the other side
[1:36:02] of it I see a judgment Rod there there
[1:36:04] you might see failures you you might see
[1:36:07] mistakes you might see troubles but pick
[1:36:10] it up in the name of Jesus and watch it
[1:36:12] for destroy pharaoh and his
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:19] army mother brand said it like
[1:36:22] this he said he was given him a
[1:36:26] Vindication when he told him to throw it
[1:36:28] down and it turned into a serpent and
[1:36:30] picked it up he when he God gives an
[1:36:33] absolute he gives a
[1:36:35] Vindication to that
[1:36:39] absolute
[1:36:45] Hallelujah Moses was a man like
[1:36:49] you but Moses had an experience much
[1:36:52] like you've had an experience
[1:36:54] and Moses is standing there and no
[1:36:57] matter what he faced impersonators could
[1:36:59] come mockers could come unbelievers
[1:37:02] could come Skeptics could come Pharaoh
[1:37:06] could come but he had a voice that give
[1:37:09] him a vision that he was coming back to
[1:37:11] this same Mountain where he had an
[1:37:13] experience and he's telling him on this
[1:37:15] mountain on this mountain you're going
[1:37:17] to come back here and you're going to
[1:37:18] worship me you're talking about a power
[1:37:21] behind that Vision when Pharaoh wouldn't
[1:37:23] let let him go the first time he held on
[1:37:25] to that Vision he held on to the power
[1:37:27] of it when it didn't look like it was
[1:37:29] going to let him go and he took up dust
[1:37:31] and he created fleas he took up dust and
[1:37:33] he created frogs he held on to that
[1:37:36] Vision he held on to that Vision no
[1:37:39] matter what his sister was saying no
[1:37:41] matter what his brother was saying and
[1:37:43] it might have seemed ridiculous to
[1:37:44] everybody else but Moses had in his hand
[1:37:47] more than a Crooked Stick but he had a
[1:37:49] vision when Pharaoh all they had was
[1:37:52] Spears Moses had the name of Jesus
[1:37:54] Christ you see that was all that he
[1:37:56] needed was the word that's all you need
[1:37:58] today it's not a credential from some
[1:38:00] church you don't need a denomination to
[1:38:02] back you up you need the word to take
[1:38:05] the Rapture with you don't need some
[1:38:07] credential you don't need some long
[1:38:09] history of some school to be healed this
[1:38:11] morning you need to accept the word that
[1:38:15] does
[1:38:18] it that's all we
[1:38:21] need that stick in the hand of Moses was
[1:38:24] like in the name of Jesus Christ in
[1:38:25] every single one of your hands I would
[1:38:28] say it like this that's all you ever
[1:38:29] need that's all you're ever going to
[1:38:31] need you don't need some school you
[1:38:34] don't need some book you don't need some
[1:38:36] theology you don't need some
[1:38:37] intellectual conception the name of
[1:38:39] Jesus Christ in your hand let me say it
[1:38:42] like this
[1:38:44] Moses
[1:38:46] Mo Moses was a
[1:38:49] vessel that stick couldn't talk
[1:38:55] but the one that was carrying it
[1:38:58] could come on somebody that stick could
[1:39:01] do a lot of things but that stick was
[1:39:03] powerless unless it was in the hands of
[1:39:07] Moses the name of Jesus is
[1:39:11] powerful now the Visions got a voice the
[1:39:14] vision's got to
[1:39:15] speak that most Moses could speak let me
[1:39:19] say it let me put it in this form for
[1:39:21] you that green checkered shirt couldn't
[1:39:23] talk
[1:39:26] that green checkered shirt couldn't talk
[1:39:28] that measuring tape couldn't
[1:39:31] talk come on somebody but the man that
[1:39:34] was Greg wearing that Green checkered
[1:39:37] shirt had a voice and the prophet knew
[1:39:41] that that man was going to carry this
[1:39:42] message preach this
[1:39:45] message the green checkered shirt can't
[1:39:47] talk but I say this to you by the word
[1:39:49] of the Lord you can
[1:39:54] come on somebody you can ED brother Ed
[1:39:58] bisc preached he spoke he testified of
[1:40:02] what the vision said but now it's your
[1:40:06] turn I'm charging you it's your turn if
[1:40:10] brother Ron Falls by the wayside if
[1:40:12] brother Ron goes by the grave if brother
[1:40:14] Andrew Falls by the wayside if brother
[1:40:16] Andrew Falls and falls and he and he and
[1:40:18] he goes by the
[1:40:20] grave it's your turn what what are you
[1:40:23] going to do with the name of Jesus what
[1:40:25] are you going to do with this message
[1:40:27] the vision has a voice behind
[1:40:30] it and I will not be
[1:40:34] silenced I will not be quiet I will not
[1:40:38] set up I will not be quiet you can't
[1:40:41] tell me to go sit down in my
[1:40:43] Pew I had a vision talk to me the vision
[1:40:47] said I was worthy the vision said I was
[1:40:49] redeemed the vision said I was bought
[1:40:52] the vision said I was
[1:40:53] the vision the vision of the word is
[1:40:57] Jesus Christ the same
[1:41:02] yesterday
[1:41:04] today and
[1:41:06] forever Moses
[1:41:09] endured I seeing him who is
[1:41:14] invisible the prophet said it like this
[1:41:18] that Moses and Pharaoh was looking out
[1:41:21] the same window
[1:41:24] they was looking at the same scene they
[1:41:27] was looking at the same
[1:41:28] situation and Pharaoh a bunch of
[1:41:33] slaves but Moses was looking at the
[1:41:36] redeemed of the Lord Moses was looking
[1:41:39] at a people that was getting
[1:41:42] ready the prophet estimated two million
[1:41:45] people was living down there and 2
[1:41:48] million people was getting ready to make
[1:41:51] the greatest exit out of any country
[1:41:54] that ever had been you talking about
[1:41:56] open borders Moses had a Ministry to
[1:41:59] open every
[1:42:01] border and let his children walk over on
[1:42:05] dry
[1:42:07] ground the prophet said like this that
[1:42:10] Moses Moses could have delivered them by
[1:42:13] his political
[1:42:14] power he said but that's not the car
[1:42:17] characteristics of God he said because
[1:42:19] the characteristics of God are
[1:42:21] Supernatural so we had to work through
[1:42:23] his identification of his
[1:42:25] characteristics so if God would have
[1:42:27] delivered him by political power because
[1:42:30] fa Moses had his foot on the throne he
[1:42:33] could have done
[1:42:34] it but that wasn't God's provided way
[1:42:38] but God had another way that he was
[1:42:40] going to bring them out you said what
[1:42:41] was that way brother Andrew it was a
[1:42:43] mighty hand you see God's
[1:42:46] characteristics is always Supernatural
[1:42:49] every time you see the handiwork of the
[1:42:51] Lord you see the supernatural
[1:42:53] in every single one of our Lives whether
[1:42:55] you can believe it oright or not there's
[1:42:57] a vision that is breaking over your life
[1:43:00] that'll let you know that where you're
[1:43:03] going it'll tell you where you're going
[1:43:05] you remember when the prophet he had
[1:43:07] preached in his early Ministry and he
[1:43:09] told it for two years that God was going
[1:43:12] to raise up a little dead
[1:43:14] boy now when brother bam when brother
[1:43:16] bham was standing there 1950 he's on the
[1:43:18] other side of it but he begins to relate
[1:43:21] he said now you know that you all had
[1:43:23] that all across this nation he said you
[1:43:25] had that in the fly leaf of your Bible
[1:43:27] for two years that God was going to
[1:43:29] raise up a little boy he laid out the
[1:43:30] panoramic of how everything was going to
[1:43:32] look at and how everything was going to
[1:43:34] be and when brother Brandon is coming
[1:43:36] back on the other side of Canada brother
[1:43:39] brandham said these words he said these
[1:43:41] words he said it'll be a master Vision
[1:43:44] that'll stir
[1:43:46] everything he said there's one Vision
[1:43:48] that's still got to come he said it's a
[1:43:50] master Vision that'll stir everything H
[1:43:54] up now you notice this that little boy
[1:43:58] didn't realize when he was riding his
[1:44:00] bicycle that day what he was going to go
[1:44:03] through but there was a man for two
[1:44:06] years before that that had been telling
[1:44:08] this that it was going to be thus and
[1:44:11] thus Finley didn't recognize what the
[1:44:14] angel of the Lord was doing I'd say then
[1:44:17] parents didn't even realize brother Ron
[1:44:19] that a prophet was on the scene that if
[1:44:21] a prophet didn't have that vision
[1:44:23] and if a prophet didn't say what he said
[1:44:25] that little boy would have still been
[1:44:27] dead today but because there was a
[1:44:30] prophet that had a vision of that little
[1:44:33] boy couldn't stay there
[1:44:35] dead he spoke he said you can line up
[1:44:38] every single devil in hell and he
[1:44:39] couldn't stop that vision from coming to
[1:44:42] pass now I'm just looking at it through
[1:44:45] my eyes on the other side of the message
[1:44:47] if that was a master vision and it
[1:44:49] stirred up everything what about Sir
[1:44:52] what is is this a sign of the end time
[1:44:54] and a prophet is standing there and he
[1:44:56] says I see a great blast it could be my
[1:44:59] destruction he said but it could be the
[1:45:01] releasing of those Seven Seals now if
[1:45:05] that Vision stirred up all of Finland
[1:45:07] stirred up all of Europe what about this
[1:45:09] church what about this
[1:45:12] Vision hell can't handle the reality
[1:45:15] that the seals have been ripped off of
[1:45:19] it I can preach with this microphone I
[1:45:22] can preach with these speak ERS I can
[1:45:23] preach with this I can preach with these
[1:45:25] mons I can preach without you I preached
[1:45:28] it in covid when nobody was sitting here
[1:45:31] but you are what the Seven Seals spoke
