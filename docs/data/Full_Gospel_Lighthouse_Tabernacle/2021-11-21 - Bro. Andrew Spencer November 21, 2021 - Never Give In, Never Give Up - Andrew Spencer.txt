amen if you have your bibles this morning we'd like to look over in the burke the book of uh first corinthians chapter nine and verse twenty four and as you're making your way uh through the scriptures this morning we want to remind you of the baptismal service that'll be next sunday morning and that'll be next sunday morning after the the preaching of the word uh we'll be baptizing uh i'm not sure on the number exactly as of yet because i have different emails and different ones texting me and and so i don't know the final count but i believe we're getting close to around 10 baptisms and even some that are being even re-baptized so we just thank the lord for for what he's doing in the kingdom of god amen we we certainly were blessed last evening uh by the brothers from europe and our hearts were i just just overwhelmed with the word that came forth and and uh we just we really appreciated the word of god and and uh just just looking looking under the lord this morning amen first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 and paul says here know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we in incorruptable i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air amen let's just go to the lord in prayer at this time heavenly father we come before you lord and our our hearts are hungering for your word and hungering lord for more of your presence to come and fill our lives lord like never before we invite you to this to take this desk and to take the text this morning and begin to minister to your people as we read in the bible how that you would come and you would sit down and on the mountain and you would begin to teach them father we have come lord one more time on this mountain lord for you to come and to teach us of your word but lord may it not just be teaching but it may be in power and in demonstration of the holy ghost we're asking father that you meet the needs of the people i pray you help me get out of the way and help me do a good job i pray you bless your people today in jesus name amen god bless you you may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to speak to you this morning on never give in and never give up never give in and never give up and life is certainly certainly a struggle that we go through and if you've been acquainted with life very much you've found out that life is a struggle there was one of the great philosophers in the in the man age that that that had several students and one of his students asked him said what is the secret to life and he told his follower to follow him down by the ocean side and he he walked all the way through the city and all the way down to the ocean side when he got down there the philosopher walked out into the water and he said follow me and he walked out into the water and he said stick your head in the water and when he stuck his head in the water then the philosopher put his hand over top of the man's head so that they had that he could not get up he was fighting with everything that was within him to get up and he had to fight to to push to push him push his hand off and finally he broke free and he was gasking gasping for air when he come back up to and the philosopher walked back onto the seashore and he stood there he said that is the secret to life you have to struggle to live and if you're acquainted with life and i believe we're all acquainted with life i don't believe we have any dead people here today the funeral was yesterday but we're preaching to the living today but life will throw you curveballs and life has a way of humbling you and life has a way of attempting to break you down and just when you feel like you're getting ahead in life there life will begin to throw you up against the guard rail and you'll over correct and all of a sudden you're coming in on the oncoming traffic and life will throw you for a loop but i want to say this to you as an encouragement today i don't know if you would say that this is preaching today but i want to encourage you to never give up i want to encourage you that no matter what comes your way to never give in and to never give up and brother branham would say he said maybe that's what he's doing to you tonight he might give you cancer he might give you this he might give you that he might give you a broke up home he might give you a tore up heart he might give you worries he might give you a headache see i don't know what he'll do but there's one thing that i do know that god has still got his eye on you that no matter what life can throw at you no matter where you are no matter what circumstance and one of the the the statements that brother daniel made last night that when the woman the the woman at the well had had been through her circumstances of life when she turned around the lord was there and david would say i could make my bed in hell and the lord was there if i ascended to the heights the lord is there he is jehovah shaman no matter what you go through in life the lord has got his eye on you and the only one who can make you give up is yourself the only one that can make you throw in the towel is yourself because the coach that is in your corner is the one that is telling you that you can persevere he is telling you that you can make it he is telling you you've got to get to a time in your life just like the syrophoenician woman got to that spot when she walked up to him and called him the son of david she didn't have no rights on him as a son of david but when she called him lord then she got his attention and maybe you don't have no rights on him as son of david because he's still not come in his kingdom as of yet but you do have a right as calling him your lord and when you call him your lord you are saying i am making you lord over my life lord over my soul lord over my situation and this little woman was just looking for a crumb that fell from the master's table and when jesus himself would not even turn towards her need but yet this lady was not willing that jesus would turn her down and she got to a spot that the prophet would preach a sermon on perseverance and would take this little woman that was a gentile woman that had to walk where nobody else would walk when nobody else wanted her at the table she was willing to get on her knees and you may have to get on your knees and you may have to crawl but don't you ever give in and don't you ever give up winston churchill said when you're going through hell keep on going and never never never give up when they were in the midst of the world war winston churchill took his country and he began to lead them and he began to speak unto them these famous words he said we shall go on to the end we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the earth and shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills and we shall never surrender i have been i have been what you would say i've been through hell and been through high water but my testimony remains the same i will never give in and i will never give up i will not back off for god's promises i will not back off a god's a healer i will not back off of god as a god that saves our particles i will not back off that he is our redeemer i will not back off that he is our sustainer i will not back off that he's my banker i will not back off that he's my lawyer i will not back off that he will provide every single one of your needs i will not give in to the ideologies of humanity that say that he's a dead god but i will give in to the thought that he's the same yesterday today and forever now i'm not preaching to you this morning i'm just encouraging you so you can take this as a motivation or you can take this as preaching it's however you want to receive it but the bible said in isaiah 59 and 20 so y'all keep yourself calm and i'll do my best to do the same because i'm not preaching the bible said in the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from true transgression and jacob save the lord as for me this is my covenant you you wonder why i'm saying i'm not preaching to you because i've been told i ain't a preacher so let me just say this to you i'm not preaching to you today i'm encouraging you but as for me as this is what the lord said as for me this is my covenant with him saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth notice what he is saying my spirit is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth say in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed save the lord from henceforth and forever notice no matter where you go the spirit of the lord is upon you and the spirit of the lord is going to keep you the spirit of the lord is not going to lead you down some road that he can't get you out of the spirit of the lord is not going to lead you into a trouble that he ain't already got your escape route already figured out and notice when you get in that spot he'll be there but his word will be there as well notice what the what he would say in the patmos vision he said now paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preach actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciences of men like the surgeon's knife had cut out the diseases and set kept us free everywhere those early believers went just like men like yourself like women like yourself they went preaching the gospel and confirmed the word with signs following the sick were healed how many seen the sick healed devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues and that was the word in action notice that word has never failed in the mouth of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater ever than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth with it and your heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom notice we can have an attitude of certainty because we are certain of who god is now you remember in the bible over in luke 18 i'll just read it to you just for a moment remember i'm not preaching to you and he spake a parable unto them to the sin that men ought to always pray and not faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterwards he he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her notice notice notice because of the trouble that she was giving him what was he doing he was disrupting his daily activities she was in a spot where she was disrupting what he was doing and she became a burden unto him he said but yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me by her continual knocking at my door i will get faint and i'll get wore out this was a woman because of her situation that life had thrown at her she began to knock because he said knock she began to ask because he said you shall receive she began to knock and because she realized that he would open the door to her and the lord said hear what this unjust judge said and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear along with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily he will avenge them immediately nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth what a powerful thing he didn't come and say now will he find righteousness will he find holiness but will he find faith i believe god has stepped into this hour and has looked out upon a congregation of the bride of jesus christ and found a people of faith now notice now jesus taught that same thing how about the unjust judge and the widow that he wouldn't he wouldn't revenge her although she cried day and night he well he revenged her enemies just to get rid of her said how much more will your heavenly father give them the holy ghost who ask him that's what we want now notice this he says now if you don't believe that the holy spirit's real take a hold of god's promise and just stay with it now this he's not talking to a believer he's talking to somebody that don't have faith enough to believe that this is for them he said but if you don't believe the holy spirit's real take a hold of god's promise and just stay with it hold on to it don't leave it if you don't believe it he's a healer whatever disease or trouble you have right now don't wait to healing to the healing line just take a hold of it right now and say god i'm on your hands he is speaking to an individual or a person that would say well i don't know whether god is or i don't know what he'll do but he's saying if you don't know this i want you to hold on to his promises this is somebody that doesn't understand the concept of god and how god works but here we are the children of the light and children of faith how much more do you know the promises of god how much more do you know that god will keep his promises how much more do you know that he's more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ever ask or think according to the power that works in you as a son and daughter of the most high god you are a believer how much more should you allow your opportunity not to not pass you by now satan will say now you're no better that's what he told me he said now i said look at oh slew foot if you want you you like to hear me testify about the glory of god stick around but you ain't going to shake me away from that that's your testimony of believer if you like to hear the testimonies of god and the praises of divine healing stay around i'm gonna wring it out just as long as i can just stay right with it stick around listen at it i'll invite you to listen at it and stay around first day no better next day no better next day no better and i just kept saying staying and testifying and praising god pressing through the dark clouds he made a promise finally there it was he'll get tired after away after a while and run away here was a a testimony of a believer that would never give in and never give up it's not what you see jesus would say that when you go to prayer to go into your prayer cloths and when you get in your prayer closet shut the door and when you get inside of there go to praying to the god that hears in secret but the god that hears in secret he will reward you openly god is not ashamed to bless you because you were in a spot that you got in when nobody else was around you when nobody else could pick you up when nobody else was around you to say you can make it but you went in there all alone but when you got on the outside god said i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna bless you everything you touch gonna be blessed everywhere you put your hand on it's gonna be blessed i bless you coming in i bless you going out i bring your children back because my word will not depart out of your mouth i ain't preaching to you i'm encouraging take back what the devil stole from you [Applause] when elijah walked up there with a woman here she come with her circumstance of life and elijah said to hazel you go take my rod down there you laid on that boy i know what i'm talking about you go down there and you lay that on that boy and that boy get well now notice that that rod that that that staff that was in his hand had the capabilities of healing that boy is that right it had the full capabilities because this was the gospel trumpet and when the gospel begins to sound it is a word of prophecy and because the god of heaven was behind elijah it would have been full capable to do what this woman's need was asking about but her faith was not in a stick her faith was in the man of god whom what she watched that power begin to pass through that humanity my faith is not in a man my faith is not in this pulpit my faith is not in this flesh my faith is in the man the son of man christ jesus thomas edison said i'm not discouraged because every wrong attempt discarded is a step forward when he finally created the light bulb so how do you feel about failing a thousand times he said i didn't fail a thousand times i figured out a thousand times how not to make a light bulb your mindset is huge how you take life but don't ever give in and don't ever give up you remember that guy gave up neither does no one else you remember the guy that gave up you remember who was the runner-up two or three years ago two to to the to the world series absolutely not you only remember the winners the greatest the greatest marathon in the olympics they don't care about who comes in last the person that comes in last does not get a chance to stand on the podium and hear their national anthem run out across across the city and across the stadium and when that man that is in first place comes running in there is a crowd that is cheering him on and though he may have went through some trials for 20 some miles just to get into the stadium when he got in the stadium when he got in there there were people that were shouting him on and no they wouldn't maybe not have been on the same nation they may not have been on the same team maybe not but yet there was a champion that was rolling into the stadium i want to say this morning the reason why you hear the shout of the king in the camp is because a champion come running in and he's telling you never give up never give in never back off [Applause] but too many people live life by haunted being haunted by missed opportunities has-beens couldn't hack it couldn't make it through life couldn't go all the way people live scarred haunted lives because they missed an opportunity when you go to study in a church age book you look in there and you talk you see brother branham bring up saying augustine of hippo that he almost received the holy ghost when you look into the bible and you see a man that was a rich young ruler that had everything but he couldn't completely sell out he was a man that was haunted by missed opportunities are you with me look at laodicea laodicea had the greatest message that's ever been preached upon the face of the earth and laodicea is haunted by missed opportunities when paul was standing before king agrippa he said i almost be persuaded by paul's speech and paul's testimony that this man that was once white one way is now another i'm almost persuaded haunted by a missed opportunity you think about all the people that walk in say oh i love that kind of preaching but they walk out i don't get excited when people tell me i'm gonna make you my home church i'll be back i'm not the one that has to deal with that they're the one that has to haunt be haunted by that be haunted in hell be gnashed on in hell because they missed an opportunity through the prince and the author of life but i am be one of them like paul said that i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities no hell no high water shall be able to separate me from the love of god with that kind of mindset you can walk through cancer with that kind of mindset you can walk through laodicea with that kind of mindset you can rise up in the morning i am persuaded [Applause] never give in and never give up when paul paul met the lord brother homer would say when when the devil met paul he met his match but paul was a man that was unwavered no matter what he shipwrecked beat put in prison bonds but paul would say in acts 20 and 24 when he knew that the holy spirit was testifying to him through other brothers and sisters that were in the city when paul was making his his ascension of going into jerusalem paul said when he knew that he was going to get up there and he was going to go through chains and he was going to go through tribulations paul said in acts 20 and 24 he said none of these things move me none of these things move me everything that you see it doesn't move me it doesn't matter what i'm going through because i've got a goal that is ahead i'm not going for it that's one that beateth the air i'm going forth to win a prize i'm going forth and i'm going to press towards the mark of the high calling of him and our lord jesus christ now if this would have been just some lackadaisical ordinary person or a lesser man or a lesser woman they would have opted out for retirement by some beach over in hawaii or over by the coastal village basking in the serenity of the beautiful eastern sun but paul said i'm willing to go i'm willing to go to the chopper's block you see because paul was made out of not just some ordinary stuff that could be bluffed paul was made out of some thicker stuff and he would say none of these things moved me and he would say in ii corinthians 4 he would say tell ever tell us don't you lose heart don't you lose heart he said for which cause we faint not don't you lose heart but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us our light affliction paul would say i sought the lord thrice concerning this this thing but yet in my weakness he's made strong i sought the lord over this thing but my light affliction is working for a greater eternal glory never give in and never give up you go back to the very beginning when you go into the garden of eden and you can go there and you can see how the serpent began to slide underneath the garden walls and he began to talk began to talk to the hybrid and he began to talk to her and he began to because he was more subtle than any beast of the field he began to speak to her and he began to he began to whisper his tale and begin to tell her that god does not want you eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil because he knows that when you eat of this tree it was not a fruit on the tree but it was a pear that were on the ground and he knew that if he could deceive her into believing his lie he said you shall not surely die what did she do she stopped to listen to his lie just like when you find over in revelations when the dragon deceived them by his tail not his tail but the tale that he told he deceived them and notice what eve did she stopped for just a moment and a man cannot sin until he first cast away the very word of god but you remember when nellie saunders when she was at when she when she come down there to the tabernacle she gave her life to the lord she stood there and said that that she gave her life to the lord and all these things and said she'd never go back to the world and she'd come back in the church and it would she would say these things said you know i look at hope i look at your wife i look at i look at these other young sisters and they look so young they look so beautiful but here i am marred up i i look rough i look rough all over because sin has a way of marking you but you remember how that she had her testimony that she gave her life to the lord and she was a famous dancer there with in the city with lee horn and they won all those championships and all those dancing championships doing the uh doing doing all kinds of dances and she was going down the street and she was making going to get some stuff to make a dress and you remember a story she was going to make some dresses and she was walking down through there coming down spring street and when she come down through there she heard that music up there at redmond's hall she heard those things and she said i just stopped for a moment and she said oh i begin to remember all of those things and then the thought comes in my mind maybe i'll go up there and i'll just testify to him about the grace of the lord jesus christ how the enemy wants to trap you into thinking that you have power over him it's not you that has power but it's your father that dwelleth in you that has the power and when she came to herself she found herself in another man's arms and she'd come running that night and said bill i'm lost i'm gone i'm gone what was it brother madam would say in one spot he said a habit is simply an unclean spirit and you think well you know it ain't really hurting me this little this little thing that i carry in my pocket or this little bit of tobacco or this a little bit just a little bit of wine won't hurt me just just a little bit eleven eleven's a whole lot see you just just a little bit it's an unclean spirit yeah it's an unclean spirit and a and and brother branham would was dealing with a patient one time and said now now i see you've got that little habit that little habit that you got in your life and it's it's tobacco and you're trying with everything that's within you to get rid of it he said what that is is an unclean devil and people don't realize what they're handling you see brother branham would say in one spot he said the devil only wants you to try one time he only wants you to go up there to that spot just one time and then he's got you he wants you to smoke one cigarette one time listen to rock and roll one time because there are enticing spirits that are moving through the land and people think that the devil's some some imaginary thing that's got a guy got a pitchfork in his hand and got a tail and got horns coming off of his head he's not that way he's deceitful he's a slicker he's wise he's smart he's been studying your dna for all of these years and to think that he's been studying your family history for 6 000 years and he thinks he's going to win against you you think that satan has tried to come and have a marvelous success he had a marvelous success when he went in there and brother madam said in satan's eden he said he had a marvelous success by coming in and poisoning the mind of noah's people and telling them that there was no rain up there he certainly had a marvelous success when he went down there and he tried to control eve and made her fall by deception all of this work you think about satan you think about him as a king you think about him as a king he's a liar he's a cheater you think about his kingdom the only way he has a kingdom is if you let him reign in your heart you think about this 6 000 years of work for a three and a half year reign three and a half year reign six thousand years of work he's doing his absolute best to make you give up he's trying his best through the laodicean spirit to make you give in to make you fold the cards as it were and said i can't go no more when you think you can't go no more you're only 30 percent that's talking about the flesh when a person gets in their mind when they're in a battle or they're in some kind of exercise or some kind of strategy when they think they can't go no more they're only at 30 percent and when you get to your wit's end as a christian keep it in your mind you're not even halfway done with your life what lays before you is eternity you have got the goods to make it all the way through don't you ever give him and don't you ever give up but i brother andrew i fell the bible says in proverbs 24 and 16 that a just man falls seven times but he gets back up you're only defeated if you stay down you're only defeated if you have the mindset i can't go on you're only defeated if you're listening to your naysayers i told you i wasn't preaching my naysayers i ain't said i ain't a preacher my naysayer said i shouldn't dance my naysayers said i shouldn't sing my naysayer said i shouldn't get loud so i ain't preaching to you and i ain't getting loud i'm just raising the volume just a little bit you're only you're only halfway there you got more in the tank you think well i'm just gonna throw in the towel if you throw into town now you're always gonna throw in the towel you can quit i'm going to quit my job my boss is giving me a hard time i'm sure bosses give a hard time think about me i work for myself my boss gives me a hard time all the time i'm old time late i can't ever show up on time for work i overslept i overcooked my grits i messed up i did this i did that i didn't work hard enough this season i got a bad boss too i'm gonna give up i'm gonna give up if you give up you'll always give up if you give in you'll always give in if you give in to temptation one time once you get satisfied with losing you'll get set there and you'll stick in your way i never get picked nobody ever picks me on the last one at basketball court i'm the last one on the baseball team i know nobody picks me to play corn hold down at the church functions anymore i ain't even showing up no more they don't even bring enough food so i can put it in my to-go cup so i can take it home i i just not going back no more they say it's just for church people how all are welcome yeah [Applause] this ain't your social club this ain't your usual church remember i ain't preaching to you i'm just talking to you this morning this ain't a social club this ain't the lodge where you can go down and you can smoke your booze and live any way you want to smoke your boots my word that's some kind of new thing they're doing nowadays they're coming up all kinds of stuff [Applause] this ain't a lodge this ain't a club but what this is is a kingdom that cannot be shook this is the children of the most high god that we have learned by now that we have come through some stuff we have been through life we have been through trials but every trial only made us stronger every battle we kept on winning it looked like we was going down but there was somebody that kept raising a standard the army when they see when they're in the middle of a war they're watching that standard to see where that flag's at and that flag is showing them where they've got to go to battle at and the bible said that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall raise up a standard you're facing an enemy he don't want to just make you sick he wants to kill you and he tries to offer you peace but peace with the devil's fake peace live and let live will not work with an enemy that only survives by your destruction never give in and never give up william borland would have never been in this church gabriel spencer would have never been in this church jim noel would have never been in this church melissa hill would have never been in this church if we would listen to our naysayers if we were to listen to the people say you shouldn't go if we should if we listen to the people say you know what you know what you you're too far gone you know what you you send your day of grace away when the winners start listening to quitters [Applause] never give him never give up the devil wants your land he wants your property he wants your family he wants your joy we're not going to be pushed back on the ropes we're not gonna be back into a corner we're gonna win a quitter always quits and a winner learns how to win every time never give up never give in [Applause] the enemy is an assassin that's trying to kill you from long range but how he works he comes in real close he's got a plan all the way back there and he comes in real close so that you don't realize that you're getting shot at from your surroundings he's good at his job notice i'm gonna go to some scriptures here follow me in first samuel eleven i think we'll be much longer then in nahash the ammonite came came up and encamped against javascript and all the men of j bassin said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee and they has the ammonite answered them on this condition will i make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all of your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all of israel and the elders of jabash said unto him that give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto the coast of israel then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee now the ammonites had long claimed the right of the original possession of gilead and even though that that they had been crushed through through through jephthah over in the book of judges they now after these some 90 years were coming back to renew their claim on what they had made a possession for their own and nahash the ammonite if you go to studying it out it means serpent that he comes in and he begins to make a deal with them to make them give up what is rightfully theirs to make them give in and he made them a proposal and said now now now you just come if you if you if you want to give in if you want to if you want to do this you let me just thrust out or bore through your right eye out of all of the men of jabash gilead and he gave them a week to appeal to all of israel for help after that and they if they could not come back with a resolution they were to surrender unto him but notice what he was saying unto them he's wanting them to give up their rights of seeing he's basically saying i'm wanting you to give up your profit i'm wanting you to give up your ability to look out and to fight but not only is he saying that i'm gonna take your land but let me bring an insult against all of israel that this was the generation could you imagine the generation that would walk around maybe some 40 years after this if it would have happened what's wrong with those people all of those eyes all of their right eyes are thrust out or bored out this would be a mocking and a mockery to all the children of israel that this was the generation that gave up our land this is the generation that listened to the enemy and you see a soldier without his eyes is absolutely useless you can hold your sword all you want to but if you can't see where you're swinging it you see that's what he's tried to do in this day come in with the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and the lust of the eyes and come in and rob you and do all of these things unto you now notice notices of this quote he said now he said if the man by his intellect will finally grieve the holy spirit and keep saying the holy spirit keeps saying you should and he said well i'm too young i belong to church but you shouldn't be born again but you should be born again well if i get that kind of experience i won't be able to do this or do that or i can't go to this or that well you see the devil will tell you that you're going to lose some good time you're going to lose some privileges but he's lying to you especially use young people i'll go do a study throughout the message on he's lying to you it'll bless you oh my you don't have to drink you don't have to smoke you don't have to run around in these places of amusement why the holy spirit is a million times better than all the devils could even offer you why you don't have to get drunk on strong drink to have a big time sinners do that but you don't have to do that because i've been 23 years preaching and i've been drunk the whole 23 years on the holy spirit it's a stimulation itself it's never lets up i've always got joy i always got peace always feel good the lord is here if i'm sick and body he's got me happy in my soul if things are going good things are going good in my soul and by bad in my body or vice versa it makes any difference god is always there and i'm always stimulated with a pleasure that joy is unspeakable and full of glory that's what he does for the believer it doesn't matter what you're going through throughout your situation of life i've had friends throughout my life throughout my christian life that need me to be by their side to keep their christianity but if i would go away for some time they would lose their christianity but the holy spirit is a keeper he's a sealer he's a protector he is the one that i keep you he's the keeper [Music] verse four and then came the messenger of gibeah to of saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and wept and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep this is first hearing of this but what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the tidings of the men of jabez and the spirit watch this the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatly you think well does god get angry oh yeah the spirit of god came upon his newly his his newly put in place or newly proclaimed king and when he heard about these tidings of jabash the spirit of god came upon saul and he got angry you're going to have to come to a spot when the enemy is wanting you to give in and want you to give up that you're going to have to allow a righteous indignation to rise up on the inside of you and get angry at the devil when saul heard these tidings he took of the oxen of the land and he cune them and he cut them and he held them to pieces and he sent them throughout all the coasts he said so be it all of you if you listen and you obey these tidings but the fear of the lord fell on the people you ever got angry you ever got good and mad whatever i don't get mad i'm happy i got the holy spirit i don't get mad i'm not looking i ain't got my glasses on i don't know if you're lying or not so let's just act like i'm talking about people that are not in the building but there you're not here i'm talking to myself let me preach on me i'm not preaching i'm not preaching i'm talking but sometimes andrew you get the enemy comes in he wants to steal your family wants to steal your joy he really wants to he really wants to kill your dad he really wants to kill your mommy he wants to take your church away from you he wants to he wants to take all your family away he wants he wants to take your health away he he wants to take all the people that you love everything that you grew up in life he wants to take everything away from him talking to myself here i'm not preaching i'm talking to myself and and he just wants to come in now i'd be a fool talk to myself if i let this so-called imagination that's what some people say it's just imagination it's not a real thing it's just a thought maybe just having bad thoughts really really where do those thoughts come from it comes from the devil the devil where'd he come from to myself i'd be a fool if i just sit back and listen to you i'd be a real four if i let you walk into my house pour a double barrel shotgun and shoot my wife right in the head i'd be a real fool i'd be a real full if i let you come into my family and try to put foreign things and in my father's brain and foreign things in his body i'd be i'd be a fool if i if i just sit back and say go ahead and take our prodigals run them down there let them go to the booze joints where they're smoking booze that's what he said today i heard him say it he's not preaching he's talking i'd be full if i would let the the this enemy that keeps whispering and keep speaking these lies from the very beginning i'd be a fool if i just sit back and say god loves everybody he's got to love that thought he's got to love the devil it's it's you know god loves everybody he's got a purpose he's got a purpose in this brother andrew he's got a purpose in making me sick he's got a purpose in giving me care when did god start giving cancer when did god start driving his children away when did god stop saving people when did god stop delivering people when did god stop pouring out the holy ghost then it ought to fire you up it ought to get you angry when the enemy comes in it says i'm going to take your seer out of the picture i'm going to take your prophet out of the picture i'm telling you church of the living god don't you ever give up and don't you ever give in [Applause] you gotta fight you gotta fight god didn't raise this church up just for you to be a bunch of weaklings god didn't raise this church up so you could sit back and let things roll over top of you like like the waves coming after storm after storm after storm after storm the prophet said we're gonna crest every single one of them when you get knocked down you're gonna get back up and you full gospel lighthouse had been a testimony to the bride of jesus christ that hell came sickness came diseases came but i'm not willing to give up i'm not willing to give in [Applause] well i woke up early this morning way before anybody should have been up i woke up to a scene in my room of a man getting beat by the time i i caught the scene this man was hardly even recognizable he blood all over him he looked like his look like his flesh was hanging from his side and i watched they come and i took us what appeared to me was a cross hey if we got a spit in this guy's face and i became aware of what i was looking at gonna watch this man would you mind coming here dad i watch this man this let's just say this was the man that was beat this was the man that was scarred at that was flesh that i was seeing this morning it spit all over him had flesh hanging from him blood he was hardly recognizable and they put this cross on this man he's got his arms up and he's carrying this this cross and then i watch this man as he's compelled to come out of the crowd as they're walking and you can hear bump bump and i watch them grab this man out of the crowd and they put him up underneath of this man and this man looks under this man's eyes says jesus i got you i got you i'll help you carry this burden and then jesus looks back said oh someone i've got you amen i know i've got you but would you be that one or would you be that one yes that would look in his eyes jesus i carry your cross okay you crossed down there on earth when this man got underneath this cross i'm not just doing this for you i'm doing this for your sons right i'm doing this for alexander yes i'm doing this for rufus i'm doing this for a little girl that's up there from camden arkansas it's got cataracts all wrapped around her eyes yes i got you yes ron spencer you came and put your arm around me and helped me carry that cross but i got you i got you don't you ever give up oh don't you ever give this man this man i watch i watched it's this man said i'm never going to give up and i'll never give in here's a little there's a little man and little in my eyes he might be a little in stature but he's he's a general he's a king of kings he's he's a king he's a four-star general watching this morning watching this evening over in ireland brother george quinn king george that has a tenacity of a lion and has the faith like daniel has the faith like david and when the enemy come in and try to make make a deal there was a man of god that said no there's one more there's one more i got a call on this sister this sister jacqueline and when david when david walked down off of that hill he wasn't just walking down there for one person he wasn't walking down there for his ego he walked down there's a 12 or 13 year old boy maybe going through the time of life or puberty and his voice was crackling and the enemies whispering saying saying who is this who is this one you disdain me walking out here like this you could hear his little boy maybe his voice was cracking maybe his voice was breaking up but today i'll take your head off of your shoulders i would never give in and i would never give up when i picked up this stone when i picked up his cross i wasn't just picking it up for me i was picking up for all them people up there on that hill it only takes one stop it only takes one stone but don't you ever give in he might look a lot bigger than you the cross might be a little bit bigger than you can bear the circumstances of a life might be a little bit big for you brother george but never give in and never give up never give up let's stand i'm not willing that the enemy would disrespect any of you i'm not willing that the serpent would try to come and beguile you i'm not willing that he would thrust out your eyes of seeing but may the spirit of the lord come and anoint your eyes with the isaf of the holy spirit father where's your children where your children lord life's thrown us some big some big loops come slapped us up and hit us upside the wall many times threw us some curveballs and try to knock us out the race but our testimony remains the same that if god be for me who can be against me the weapons of life surely they were formed against us things that may be hereditary that would be passed down circumstances through dna lines but when i look into your eyes lord i can't see a circumstance i can't see a fault and i can't see a failure lord what i see is not humanity but divinity but may we be the one like simon of serene willing to get up underneath the load of this gospel and carry this sure word of prophecy oh sure might just be housewives maybe lives and we don't know we didn't plan out life the way it is we didn't we didn't expect to wake up every morning to crying babies we didn't expect to wake up with twins in the house and and life just kind of had chaos we didn't mean to we didn't expect our life to throw things like that it's like yes lord we commit our lives to you we'll commit every situation or commit every habit because when we get underneath that cross always see is you as david would say i have set the lord always before me that i might not sin against him i'm so thankful that you got me and i thought i was born i thought i was going to be the one said jesus i got you he said no son i got you have your way in your people may they come with a resolve today no matter the enemy that comes against us we will never give in and we will never give up amen hallelujah do you love him today come away my love come away my love i have waited for this day and i could give to you my name [Music] won't come
