[34:57] Oh, I can face
[35:03] tomorrow
[35:06] because he
[35:11] lives. All my fear is
[35:16] [Music]
[35:19] gone
[35:21] because I know.
[35:24] Oh yes, I know he holds my
[35:30] [Music]
[35:37] future. The
[35:40] living
[35:41] just
[35:43] because he live.
[35:47] [Music]
[35:49] And then one
[35:52] [Music]
[35:55] day I'll cross that
[36:03] river. I'll
[36:10] fight. The final war with pain.
[36:19] But then as
[36:25] death breaks way to
[36:33] victory. Thank God I see the lives of
[36:39] glory and I know he
[36:48] lives
[36:49] because he
[36:54] lives. Oh, I can face tomorrow.
[37:02] Oh,
[37:04] because he
[37:09] lives. All my fear is
[37:13] [Music]
[37:17] gone. Because I know. Oh yes, I know. He
[37:26] holds my
[37:30] future. His life it is worth the
[37:37] living just
[37:40] because he
[37:43] lives. I really love this last verse.
[37:47] Oh, then one
[37:52] day I'm going to cross that
[38:00] river. I'll find lies
[38:05] [Music]
[38:07] fine. Oh, the final war with pain.
[38:12] [Music]
[38:16] But then as
[38:22] death breaks through to
[38:30] victory. I see the
[38:34] lights of
[38:36] glory and I know you live.
[38:45] It's because you
[38:51] live. Oh, I can face
[38:56] [Music]
[38:58] tomorrow. Oh,
[39:01] because you
[39:05] live. All my fear is gone.
[39:11] [Music]
[39:15] Because I know, oh yes, I know you hold
[39:23] my future.
[39:28] Oh, and life is worth the
[39:34] living just
[39:37] because he
[39:42] liv because I
[39:46] know. Yes, I know.
[39:50] He holds my
[39:56] future. This
[39:59] life is
[40:01] worth the
[40:03] living
[40:05] just
[40:06] because he lives.
[40:10] [Music]
[40:16] [Applause]
[40:35] [Music]
[41:10] You are the
[41:17] healer, the healer of my
[41:22] [Music]
[41:26] heart, the maker and the God of all we
[41:34] [Music]
[41:39] are. I was the
[41:43] [Music]
[41:47] broken vessel in your hand.
[41:55] You looked beyond the hurten, made me
[42:01] whole
[42:02] [Music]
[42:08] again. Healer of the broken
[42:16] pieces. You touched my heart and made it
[42:21] new.
[42:26] Now my whole life I
[42:30] surrender. Lay it down before the men.
[42:35] Lord I give my life to
[42:43] you. Love that you saw before I knew
[42:48] you.
[42:53] has brought me near to where you
[42:59] [Music]
[43:01] are now. I
[43:04] live to praise
[43:07] you ever. May I praise you. You're the
[43:13] healer of my heart.
[43:17] [Music]
[43:22] Nothing compares
[43:29] Lord to knowing
[43:37] you and seeing what the grace of God can
[43:43] do.
[43:47] [Music]
[43:50] You faithfully sought
[43:58] me when you called me your
[44:06] own. And you made a way to bring my
[44:12] wondering heart back home.
[44:20] Oh, healer of the broken
[44:29] pieces. You touched my heart and made it
[44:39] new. Now my whole life I surrender. I
[44:44] lay it down before the mener. Lord, I
[44:50] give my life to
[44:52] [Music]
[44:56] you. A love that saw before I knew
[45:05] you has brought me near to where you
[45:10] are.
[45:16] Now I
[45:18] live to praise
[45:21] you. Ever may I praise you. You're the
[45:27] healer of my heart.
[45:36] Nothing compares
[45:41] Lord to
[45:43] knowing
[45:49] you and see what the grace of God can
[45:56] do.
[45:57] [Music]
[46:03] You
[46:04] faithfully sought
[46:11] me when you called me your
[46:19] own. And you made a way to bring my
[46:25] wondering heart back home.
[46:29] [Music]
[46:33] You're the healer of the broken
[46:42] pieces. You've touched my heart and made
[46:46] it
[46:47] [Music]
[46:52] new. Now my whole life I surrender.
[46:58] Lay it down before the
[47:01] mener. Lord, I give my life to
[47:11] you. Love that song before I knew
[47:19] you has brought me near to where you
[47:24] are.
[47:31] Now I
[47:32] live to praise
[47:36] you ever may I praise you for you're the
[47:41] heater of my heart.
[47:49] Healer of the broken
[47:55] [Music]
[47:57] pieces. You've touched my heart and made
[48:01] it
[48:06] new. And now my whole life I
[48:11] surrender. I lay it down before the men.
[48:17] Lord, I give myself to
[48:20] [Music]
[48:24] you. It's a love that sought before I
[48:29] knew
[48:31] [Music]
[48:33] you. It's brought me near to where you
[48:39] [Music]
[48:43] are now. I live my life to praise
[48:49] you. Ever may I praise you. You're the
[48:55] healer of my
[49:00] [Music]
[49:09] heart. Hallelujah. Surely the presence
[49:13] of the Lord is in this place. We
[49:16] wouldn't give a million dollars for what
[49:18] we feel this morning. Amen. Would you
[49:20] stand with us this
[49:22] morning as we bow on this
[49:25] morning? Take these
[49:28] [Music]
[49:29] hands and lift them up.
[49:33] [Music]
[49:35] For I have not the strength to praise
[49:40] you
[49:40] [Music]
[49:44] near. For I have
[49:47] [Music]
[49:49] nothing. I have
[49:54] nothing. Oh,
[49:56] without you.
[49:59] Oh, take my
[50:03] voice and pour it
[50:06] [Applause]
[50:09] out. Let it sing a song of mercy I have
[50:18] found. For I am nothing.
[50:24] I am
[50:28] nothing but without
[50:31] you. Oh, just lift your voice and your
[50:33] hands to him this
[50:35] morning. And all my
[50:41] soul
[50:44] needs is all your
[50:50] love to cover me.
[50:54] the
[51:00] world. They will
[51:06] see
[51:09] me. Oh,
[51:11] without
[51:14] you. Oh, take my
[51:19] body and fill it up.
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] They hit me broken as an
[51:30] offering of
[51:32] [Applause]
[51:34] Lord. For I am
[51:39] nothing. I am
[51:44] nothing without you.
[51:49] will take my
[51:53] time here on this
[51:59] earth and let it
[52:02] glorify all that you
[52:08] are. For I am nothing.
[52:13] [Music]
[52:15] I love nothing.
[52:17] [Music]
[52:20] without
[52:23] you and all my
[52:27] [Music]
[52:29] soul
[52:32] needs is all your
[52:38] love to
[52:42] cover the world.
[52:49] They will
[52:51] see that
[52:53] I have
[52:57] nothing. Oh,
[53:00] without a
[53:02] [Music]
[53:03] wonder how alone I was feeling.
[53:10] In the
[53:12] emptiness I try so hard to
[53:19] hide. Though I
[53:22] laugh and said my life was mine without
[53:27] [Music]
[53:29] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[53:36] I cried.
[53:40] But then one
[53:42] day someone told me of your
[53:49] mercy and the love you
[53:53] show you called
[53:59] Cal there you
[54:03] die and purchase my redemption.
[54:10] Oh, when you broke s power and set my
[54:15] spirit
[54:19] free. Oh, I'm
[54:22] amazed. As brother Ron comes, let's sing
[54:25] it unto the Lord. Aren't you thankful
[54:29] for the love of Christ? Oh, I'm
[54:34] amazed at how you
[54:39] came and through
[54:43] the blood.
[54:51] And my
[54:53] sins are
[54:55] washed. They're all washed away.
[55:01] Oh my
[55:03] sins are washed. Let's sing that verse
[55:06] again. That chorus. I'm amazed. Oh, I'm
[55:13] [Music]
[55:15] amazed that you love
[55:20] me. I'm
[55:25] amazed how you care.
[55:29] [Music]
[55:30] Through your
[55:33] precious blood I
[55:36] [Music]
[55:39] found and my
[55:43] sins are
[55:45] washed. They're all washed
[55:50] away. Oh my
[55:53] sins are
[55:56] wash away.
[56:00] Aren't you thankful for that this
[56:02] morning? I'm glad they're washed away.
[56:06] Amen. So good to be in the house of the
[56:08] Lord. And what a presence we feel this
[56:10] morning. And why don't you just greet
[56:12] your neighbors right there? We're going
[56:14] to spend eternity together. And
[56:19] Amen. Amen. I bless you.
[56:25] Amen. Amen. So thankful for the songs
[56:28] this morning, last night's
[56:30] service. I don't, you know, I just
[56:33] sometimes wonder how much better it can
[56:34] get and then it does. Amen. And so I
[56:38] just I kind of had a hard time going to
[56:40] sleep last night after all of that. And
[56:42] so that was just it was just really
[56:45] great. One reason an old man's trying to
[56:48] follow a young man. So I don't know.
[56:51] Amen. So glad to have each and every one
[56:54] of you with us and so thankful for what
[56:56] the Lord did for Sister Dorothy and uh
[57:00] we're able to get her heart back in that
[57:02] right beat and we sure was praying and
[57:04] and
[57:06] uh we so thank we so love you. You've
[57:10] been here forever now. So yeah. Amen. So
[57:14] just amazing. you meet somebody after a
[57:16] few days and after a few months and just
[57:18] feels like you've been together your
[57:20] whole life and so we just are so
[57:22] thankful for that. So glad to have those
[57:24] that have stayed for from the wedding
[57:26] and and uh that was beautiful. That was
[57:29] a beautiful wedding yesterday. And I'd
[57:32] like to thank I'd like to personally
[57:33] thank the Lord will thank you, but I'd
[57:36] like to thank all of those
[57:37] that that did all the work behind the
[57:41] scenes. Sister Cassie, the music, and
[57:43] the uh brother Jeremy and brother Scotty
[57:46] upstairs that took care of that, Sister
[57:48] Crystal, and and she had a team of
[57:50] people that was with her. And I'd like
[57:52] to thank every one of you for what you
[57:54] did. and and uh I you know that just
[57:57] makes life a whole lot more smoother.
[57:59] And so thank you. Thank you. Thank you
[58:02] so much. And and we certainly do
[58:04] appreciate that. Amen. I want to
[58:08] remember Sister Sue this morning and and
[58:11] uh we're just praying for her and uh God
[58:14] would just touch her. Many other needs.
[58:16] We had a need from Brother Joe come in
[58:19] this morning from Brother Luther.
[58:21] Brother Luther's quite a guy. We all
[58:23] love him and he has a incredible need.
[58:26] Been in the hospital almost two weeks
[58:28] and so pray that God would just touch
[58:30] him in a special way. Amen. If you will
[58:33] turn with me in your scriptures this
[58:35] morning to Isaiah chapter
[58:42] 14 and then we will go to
[58:45] Matthew chapter 26.
[58:58] I have walked to the pullpit this
[58:59] morning with a with probably one of the
[59:02] most
[59:05] important texts that you will ever ever
[59:09] be a part
[59:10] of. And so I would like for you to take
[59:14] pay very much attention if you can.
[59:19] There is a
[59:21] reason
[59:23] for many empty
[59:26] pews in churches all across the world in
[59:30] the
[59:31] message. Pews that once set
[59:34] full but now are
[59:37] vacant. And something caused that. And I
[59:41] want to speak to you on the cause of
[59:45] that.
[59:48] Satan makes an
[59:53] offer. I want to first of all get his
[59:56] origin. Isaiah 14 and verse
[59:59] 12. How art thou
[1:00:02] fallen from
[1:00:04] heaven. Oh
[1:00:06] Lucifer, son of the morning. Brother
[1:00:09] Brham said he was co-equal with God.
[1:00:16] How art thou cut down to the ground
[1:00:20] which did weaken the
[1:00:23] nations? For thou hast said in thine
[1:00:25] heart, notice the the root cause, I will
[1:00:29] ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[1:00:33] throne above the stars of
[1:00:36] God. I will sit also upon the mount of
[1:00:40] the congregation in the sides of the
[1:00:43] north.
[1:00:45] I will ascend above the heights of the
[1:00:49] clouds. I will be like the most
[1:00:53] high. Now, that's his ambition.
[1:00:56] Let's see how he puts that to work in
[1:00:59] Matthew chap 26 and verse
[1:01:02] 36. And Jesus comes to the garden of
[1:01:05] Gethsemane. So many times we think Jesus
[1:01:07] is dying on the cross. Here's the place
[1:01:10] where it started.
[1:01:13] Brother Brandham said he died to his own
[1:01:15] self-will in the garden of Eden. In the
[1:01:19] garden of Gethsemane, I'm sorry. And he
[1:01:21] says verse 36, "And then cometh Jesus
[1:01:24] with them unto a place called
[1:01:27] Gethsemane. And he saith unto the
[1:01:29] disciples, sit you here while I go and
[1:01:32] pray yonder."
[1:01:35] And he took with him Peter and two sons
[1:01:38] of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful
[1:01:41] and very
[1:01:42] heavy. And then saith he unto them, "My
[1:01:46] soul is exceedingly
[1:01:48] sorrowful, even unto
[1:01:51] death, Tarry ye here, and watch with
[1:01:54] me."
[1:01:56] And he went a little further and fell on
[1:02:01] his face and prayed, saying, "Oh my
[1:02:05] father," now notice these words, "if it
[1:02:09] be
[1:02:11] possible, let this cup pass from
[1:02:15] me.
[1:02:16] Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou
[1:02:21] will."
[1:02:22] And he cometh to the disciples, and
[1:02:26] findeth them asleep, and said unto
[1:02:28] Peter, "What? Could you not watch with
[1:02:32] me one
[1:02:33] hour? Watch and pray that you enter not
[1:02:37] into
[1:02:38] temptation. The spirit indeed is
[1:02:42] willing, but the flesh is weak." I want
[1:02:46] us to read that last portion of that
[1:02:49] scripture.
[1:02:53] Let's just read the whole one. Watch and
[1:02:56] pray that you enter not into
[1:03:00] temptation. The spirit indeed is
[1:03:02] willing, but the flesh is weak. Never
[1:03:07] take it for granted that your
[1:03:10] flesh is weak. You can be seated. May
[1:03:13] God bless the reading of his word.
[1:03:25] Satan's going to make an
[1:03:28] offer. And his offer is for your
[1:03:32] position. Your position you set as a
[1:03:37] believer. You set as a son and daughter
[1:03:40] of
[1:03:41] God. Your position has authority in
[1:03:45] heaven.
[1:03:46] And if you remember, one of the most
[1:03:48] powerful quotes that will go with this
[1:03:50] is that you have more
[1:03:53] authority than the angels that are in
[1:03:55] heaven.
[1:03:58] So, Lucifer would know what kind of
[1:04:01] authority that has been expressed to
[1:04:04] sons and daughters of God. So, he is
[1:04:07] going to make you an offer.
[1:04:12] He is going to make you an offer.
[1:04:16] I think this is a powerful scripture
[1:04:19] that will show us what God has in his
[1:04:22] plans knowing that Lucifer is going to
[1:04:25] make an offer. John chap 10 and verse
[1:04:28] 25. And Jesus answered them and said, "I
[1:04:32] told you that ye believe
[1:04:34] not, and the works that I do in my
[1:04:39] father's name, they bear witness of me.
[1:04:43] But if you believe
[1:04:44] not, because you are not of my sheep, as
[1:04:48] I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice.
[1:04:54] And notice these words, "And I know
[1:04:56] them, and they follow me." Right? And
[1:05:00] these words are powerful. And he says,
[1:05:02] "And I give unto them eternal life, and
[1:05:05] they shall never perish." Amen. Now,
[1:05:09] watch this next, and it's so important.
[1:05:12] Neither shall any man That's right.
[1:05:16] plop them out of my hand.
[1:05:21] So God made a choice.
[1:05:25] Yes, sir. I want you to understand your
[1:05:28] choices. Come on. Your free moral
[1:05:31] agency. Brother Ron, but I chose God.
[1:05:34] I'm sorry. That's a Baptist doctrine.
[1:05:38] Come on. Come on. I'm sorry. It wasn't.
[1:05:42] You chose God. That's right. Come on.
[1:05:44] Your choices were taking you in the
[1:05:46] wrong direction.
[1:05:50] Because you lived under your first
[1:05:51] nature. You were married to your first
[1:05:54] nature. That's why you had to be born
[1:05:56] again.
[1:05:58] Are you with me? God is the one that
[1:06:01] does the drawing. God is the one that
[1:06:04] does the
[1:06:05] pulling. You may be in a family and be
[1:06:08] one in the family. You may be one in the
[1:06:11] school. Listen, this is not our home.
[1:06:15] Never expect to fit in.
[1:06:21] We're not going to fit in here. Brother
[1:06:23] Ron, I just feel so left out. This is
[1:06:25] not our home.
[1:06:27] 309 is the place where I reside, but let
[1:06:31] me just say that's not
[1:06:33] my home.
[1:06:43] I want you to watch two powers coming
[1:06:45] together now in this next scriptures.
[1:06:48] And now we're going to get into the meat
[1:06:50] of things. In Matthew chapter 4 and
[1:06:53] verse
[1:06:55] three, let's just go to one. And then
[1:06:59] was Jesus led up into the spirit into
[1:07:01] the wilderness and to be tempted of the
[1:07:04] devil. And when he had fasted 40 days
[1:07:07] and 40 nights, and afterward
[1:07:10] hungered, and when the tempter came to
[1:07:13] him, now notice what he says. If thou be
[1:07:17] the son of God, command these stones to
[1:07:20] be made
[1:07:22] bread. And he answered and said, It is
[1:07:25] written, man shall not live by bread
[1:07:28] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[1:07:31] out of the mouth of God.
[1:07:35] And the devil taketh him up unto the
[1:07:37] holy city, and sitting upon a temple, a
[1:07:40] pinnacle of the temple, and said unto
[1:07:43] him, If thou be the son of God, cast
[1:07:46] thyself down. For it is written, notice
[1:07:48] he's quoting scripture.
[1:07:52] He shall give his angels charge
[1:07:53] concerning thee, and in their hands they
[1:07:56] shall bear thee up, lest at any time
[1:07:59] thou dash thy foot against a stone. And
[1:08:02] Jesus said unto him, it is written
[1:08:05] again,
[1:08:07] "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
[1:08:13] And again, the devil taking him up into
[1:08:16] an an exceedingly high mountain and
[1:08:18] showing him all the kingdoms of the
[1:08:20] world. Brother Ram said he showed him
[1:08:22] even the United States of America
[1:08:26] and the glory of them. And he said unto
[1:08:28] them him, "All these things I give
[1:08:32] thee." Now Satan Satan's making him an
[1:08:35] offer now. All these things I give thee
[1:08:40] if thou will fall down and worship me.
[1:08:47] Isaiah 14 now is in in full action. I
[1:08:52] will be like the most high.
[1:08:55] Now notice, he's tempted every prophet,
[1:08:58] every man, woman, boy, and girl. He's
[1:09:01] made offers to every one of them. And
[1:09:04] now he comes down and he's watched the
[1:09:07] prophets live and die and overcome and
[1:09:10] do different things. He's did everything
[1:09:12] to try to to to shackle them and and
[1:09:15] tried to hinder them, right? But now he
[1:09:19] is face to face
[1:09:23] with the highest power that he's ever
[1:09:26] been against.
[1:09:29] God in flesh.
[1:09:33] And he's making him an offer. Now
[1:09:37] listen. If he will make Jesus an offer,
[1:09:40] if he'll make Brother an offer,
[1:09:44] he'll make you an offer.
[1:09:47] Amen. Every one of you been made an
[1:09:50] offer. These men sitting on this pull
[1:09:52] pit, they've been made an offer.
[1:09:55] Now, I want you to understand, watch
[1:09:57] this just for a moment. He says, "Now,"
[1:10:00] and I just drop right in. Let me just
[1:10:02] finish that just just minute. I I'm
[1:10:04] sorry I got tangled. And he said unto
[1:10:07] them, "All these things I give thee, if
[1:10:09] thou will fall down and worship me." and
[1:10:12] then answered then sith Jesus unto him
[1:10:16] get thee hints
[1:10:19] Satan for it is written thou shalt
[1:10:22] worship the Lord thy God and him only
[1:10:28] that's an important statement and him
[1:10:30] only shalt thou
[1:10:33] serve and the devil leaveth him and
[1:10:37] behold the angels came and ministered
[1:10:40] unto him
[1:10:43] many places I could go to, but I want to
[1:10:45] go to how can I
[1:10:48] overcome. Brother Bram says, remember
[1:10:50] Jesus showed
[1:10:52] here how it's done 40 days of
[1:10:57] temptation. He was tempted above any man
[1:11:01] that could ever be
[1:11:03] tempted. Powerful. Tempted above any man
[1:11:08] that could ever be tempted.
[1:11:10] And he said, "And in the temptation of
[1:11:12] Jesus Christ, he showed us how it's
[1:11:17] done." So if he shows us how it's done,
[1:11:20] I think it's pretty important that we
[1:11:22] perk up our ears.
[1:11:24] His 40 days of temptation by God's by
[1:11:28] God's word, he overcome. He said, "I
[1:11:32] want to express something here just for
[1:11:34] a few moments. Satan made three major
[1:11:38] assaults upon him in that
[1:11:42] temptation. He said, "Watch, it's always
[1:11:46] it's always in them three. Don't forget
[1:11:48] it." He made him three major assaults
[1:11:52] from the highest to the lowest. He He
[1:11:56] tried his best to conquer him. And he
[1:11:59] was the He was the word. And what did he
[1:12:02] use himself? the word.
[1:12:06] Satan's three major assaults or attacks
[1:12:10] upon him, but he met him with the word.
[1:12:16] Every attack he could make it with the
[1:12:18] word. Watch this now. How the highest
[1:12:22] from the lowest. Right? We'll take our
[1:12:25] time and go through this. He said, "And
[1:12:27] the first that he made an attack to use
[1:12:30] his great power." try to get him to use
[1:12:34] his great power. He know he was the
[1:12:37] word. He know his
[1:12:40] position. You believe it? He said he
[1:12:45] said you believe and he said he did. I
[1:12:49] the son of man. He know his position and
[1:12:53] Satan come and wanted him to use his own
[1:12:56] power on himself.
[1:13:02] to feed
[1:13:05] him to want to feed himself because he
[1:13:08] was hungry. A man gets
[1:13:12] hungry and he can do almost anything.
[1:13:15] He'll steal, he'll rob, he'll beg, he'll
[1:13:19] borrow,
[1:13:21] anything. He had an
[1:13:23] appetite. And Satan used his first great
[1:13:27] major assault for him to take his power
[1:13:31] that he had given to been given to
[1:13:33] overcome with and to use it on himself.
[1:13:38] Right. Right. He didn't you he didn't
[1:13:41] use it on himself. He used it on others.
[1:13:44] He used it on others, not himself. It it
[1:13:47] wasn't for him. though he could have did
[1:13:50] it.
[1:13:53] He could have did it. Turn stones into
[1:13:56] bread. Could have did it.
[1:14:01] See how the devil
[1:14:03] does? The devil wants you to mind him.
[1:14:10] But Jesus minded only what the father
[1:14:14] said.
[1:14:16] He said,
[1:14:18] "Why? It is written he'd give his angels
[1:14:22] angels
[1:14:24] charge." And Jesus responded, "But it's
[1:14:27] also written."
[1:14:31] He said, "You see, he knew who he was,
[1:14:34] right? Listen what? This is one of the
[1:14:36] greatest points that you'll get. Always
[1:14:38] remember who you are."
[1:14:42] You heard it last night. He'll try to
[1:14:44] make you forget.
[1:14:48] He says that runs deeper than it's even
[1:14:51] wrote. It's
[1:14:53] inspiration. The colonel is on the
[1:14:55] inside of it. You see what it really is.
[1:14:59] Though he could have done it, he didn't
[1:15:01] do it. He never paid he paid heed to
[1:15:05] Satan's
[1:15:07] proposition. Now, here's a good thing.
[1:15:10] Sometimes Satan can take you and when
[1:15:13] you think you're doing the will of
[1:15:18] God and can make you a
[1:15:21] proposition and you'll fall for it.
[1:15:26] I'm going to read that again because
[1:15:27] it's so important here. Right?
[1:15:29] Sometimes Satan can take you and when
[1:15:33] you think you're doing the will of God
[1:15:38] and make you a
[1:15:40] proposition and you'll fall for it.
[1:15:43] He sure can. He said his third assault,
[1:15:47] Satan offered to forfeit the kingdom to
[1:15:50] him. And he did. Satan said, "See the
[1:15:53] kingdoms of the world, these are mine. I
[1:15:56] do with them whatever I want to do. I'll
[1:16:00] forfeit them to you. But you remember he
[1:16:04] was trying to get them to forfeit it
[1:16:07] without the cross.
[1:16:14] If he did, we would be lost.
[1:16:19] If he did, we would be lost. He could
[1:16:23] have took the
[1:16:26] kingdom, but he must follow. He must
[1:16:30] come
[1:16:32] back. This is powerful. Now, Jesus was
[1:16:36] tempted to do it.
[1:16:44] That's how powerful it was.
[1:16:47] He was tempted to do it. I want you to
[1:16:50] keep that in your mind.
[1:16:52] He said, "Death is so hard. It's a hard
[1:16:56] thing." He was tempted to take his
[1:16:58] liberty and be the king of the earth
[1:17:02] without a
[1:17:04] cross. But if he did, his subjects would
[1:17:08] have
[1:17:09] died. Satan would have gladly made that
[1:17:14] proposition with
[1:17:17] him. But he said, "Get behind me, Satan.
[1:17:21] Right.
[1:17:26] I'm trying to behave. Get behind me,
[1:17:29] Satan.
[1:17:31] Now, let's just go quickly to another
[1:17:33] spot and we'll come back. Hebrews chap
[1:17:36] 11 and verse
[1:17:39] 24. By faith, Moses, when he was come to
[1:17:43] years, refused to be called the son of
[1:17:45] Pharaoh's
[1:17:48] daughter,
[1:17:49] choosing rather to suffer the affliction
[1:17:53] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:17:56] pleasures of sin for a for a
[1:18:00] season, esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:18:05] greater riches than the treasures in
[1:18:08] Egypt. Amen.
[1:18:10] For he had respect unto the recompense
[1:18:14] of the
[1:18:16] reward. By faith he forsook Egypt.
[1:18:23] Are you with me? Brother Brandon would
[1:18:26] make a statement. He said he looked out
[1:18:28] the same window that Pharaoh looked out
[1:18:32] of.
[1:18:33] Same window. Amen. You know, sometimes
[1:18:36] we take this so lightly, but Moses was
[1:18:40] the next Pharaoh.
[1:18:44] Let's just say it. He was the next
[1:18:46] Pharaoh.
[1:18:48] If he just stays in line, he'll be the
[1:18:50] next Pharaoh, which is the greatest
[1:18:53] leader in the world at that time.
[1:18:58] I wanted to get that to you. Sink that
[1:19:00] in real quickly to you. This was the
[1:19:03] richest nation at the time. had more
[1:19:05] gold at the time, had the greatest army
[1:19:08] at the time.
[1:19:10] He looked out the same window,
[1:19:14] and and and Pharaoh would see mudbers,
[1:19:18] right? Would see people that was working
[1:19:23] for his own ambition,
[1:19:26] to build all of the great sphinxes and
[1:19:29] all the great pyramids. Amen. And
[1:19:34] Moses, if we could say it, was one of
[1:19:36] the highest architects
[1:19:40] in the kingdom, right with building
[1:19:43] these things.
[1:19:45] He was on his way, folks.
[1:19:50] I think this is amazing that God allows
[1:19:53] his prophet to be trained right under
[1:19:56] Satan's nose.
[1:20:00] gives him the best education that he can
[1:20:02] give him, makes him the best
[1:20:04] propositions that he can give him. But
[1:20:07] there will come a time when that seed
[1:20:10] gene of God will come to life.
[1:20:15] And there'll no longer be mudbers.
[1:20:21] You remember his wet nurse? The woman
[1:20:23] that took care of him was his mother.
[1:20:26] And no doubt his mother, brother Ram
[1:20:28] says in in teaching on Moses, he said
[1:20:31] his mother would teach him about his
[1:20:33] birth and the angel's visitation and all
[1:20:36] of those things. Just paraphrasing that
[1:20:38] she would teach him about his purpose in
[1:20:41] life.
[1:20:43] Amen.
[1:20:49] It comes to a
[1:20:51] spot. It comes to a spot to where that
[1:20:54] now
[1:20:56] He's in a wrestling
[1:20:59] match. And he's in a wrestling match
[1:21:01] with the will of
[1:21:04] God and the will of Moses.
[1:21:09] Now, I'm talking to you and you're going
[1:21:12] to get in that wrestling match.
[1:21:17] Follow the theme of this
[1:21:19] thought. You're going to
[1:21:22] fight. And here's where the problem
[1:21:25] comes. Can I do my
[1:21:29] will and God's will?
[1:21:40] Surely I can blend it
[1:21:42] together. Sure, I can make it work.
[1:21:45] Surely I know what God's will is.
[1:21:51] But I have a
[1:21:52] will. Jesus had to die in the garden of
[1:21:55] Gethsemane.
[1:21:58] Why? He would like to have raised a
[1:22:00] family. Come on. He would have liked to
[1:22:03] stayed with Peter, James, and John. He
[1:22:05] would have liked to been there and
[1:22:07] continued the miracles. That's right.
[1:22:09] But his purpose to the earth was more
[1:22:12] than
[1:22:13] miracles. His purpose to the earth was
[1:22:16] more than just to identify who he was.
[1:22:20] His purpose was he was the kinsman
[1:22:23] redeemer.
[1:22:25] Amen.
[1:22:28] Moses had to realize my purpose. You got
[1:22:31] to come to a spot to where I have a
[1:22:33] purpose in life and that's to serve God.
[1:22:36] We're only mortal once.
[1:22:41] We only got one shot at this. 30, 50
[1:22:44] years, 18 months, 110 years
[1:22:48] old. What Elon Musk is finding, some of
[1:22:51] us Americans are still 150 years
[1:22:56] old. Find that amazing, don't
[1:23:04] you? And he's going to wrestle with you
[1:23:06] with your will all the way through.
[1:23:11] So what does Moses
[1:23:15] do? He begins to transition in this.
[1:23:19] He's not telling
[1:23:21] Pharaoh. He's not telling his
[1:23:23] stepmom. He's not telling the people
[1:23:26] around him, "Okay, I'm going to help
[1:23:29] those
[1:23:30] people." He's slipping down. And now
[1:23:33] he's trying to become one of them.
[1:23:35] Listen, you can't become one of them in
[1:23:39] Pharaoh's clothes.
[1:23:41] Come on. You can't become one of the
[1:23:44] bride.
[1:23:48] And lay outas close.
[1:23:52] It just won't work. You can't ride the
[1:23:55] fence. You got to get one place or the
[1:23:57] other. Come on.
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:03] On Monday be one person and on Sunday be
[1:24:05] a different person. It'll work. Amen.
[1:24:10] They see through you. That's right.
[1:24:14] We see through you.
[1:24:17] Can you see through you?
[1:24:21] Did you just get that? That's good. They
[1:24:24] see through you. We see through you. But
[1:24:27] can you see through you?
[1:24:35] What did
[1:24:36] Moses trying to blend the will of God
[1:24:40] do? It produced a dead
[1:24:45] Egyptian at his
[1:24:48] hands. His
[1:24:50] self-will put blood on his own hands and
[1:24:53] he become a murderer.
[1:24:56] He become a
[1:24:59] murderer cast and I don't I don't I I
[1:25:02] don't I don't have time even this week
[1:25:04] to tell you it it caused him an exile
[1:25:08] and it took 40 years for God to bake
[1:25:13] Moses to the place to get him. Listen,
[1:25:18] there's a lot of times I could just say
[1:25:19] it like this. There's a lot of people
[1:25:20] sat on people on the bench for 40 years.
[1:25:28] just surrender.
[1:25:36] He said he had his foot on the
[1:25:39] throne. Could have been the next
[1:25:42] Pharaoh, but he esteemed the
[1:25:45] reproach of
[1:25:48] Christ. They called him an odd
[1:25:51] one. Fanatic. They'll do that.
[1:26:02] Trying to save you some time
[1:26:04] here. Brother Brandon will bring up a
[1:26:07] couple of different
[1:26:15] characters that he'll talk about as he's
[1:26:18] coming through the ministry.
[1:26:21] It talks about Marilyn
[1:26:24] Monroe. Marilyn Monroe was not around
[1:26:26] the message whatsoever, but he'll he'll
[1:26:29] pick her
[1:26:32] up. I want you to
[1:26:35] understand her
[1:26:37] lifestyle. She had
[1:26:39] been
[1:26:41] offered by the enemy as a young girl.
[1:26:47] She had been offered a a
[1:26:50] position and somewhere another a spirit
[1:26:53] took over her life and she became the
[1:26:57] Barbie doll of America.
[1:27:01] Somewhere it seemed almost
[1:27:04] innocent. But let us remind ourselves
[1:27:07] sin will take us much further
[1:27:12] than we ever thought that we would go. I
[1:27:16] never intended to get here remember and
[1:27:18] from that time brother Brandham met that
[1:27:20] man in the alley pig alley. I've always
[1:27:22] amazed brother Brandham in pig alley but
[1:27:26] he meets a man and said how did you get
[1:27:27] here?
[1:27:29] How did you get here? He said I was the
[1:27:31] I was the president of that bank that
[1:27:34] you
[1:27:34] see. But it started out with a little
[1:27:37] social drink.
[1:27:41] Legion wound up in the tomb.
[1:27:45] It started out somewhere
[1:27:50] not too many miles from here, a man
[1:27:52] stood as a as a song leader for his
[1:27:55] grandfather. He was a
[1:27:58] boy and he was offered something. That
[1:28:01] man was named Elvis
[1:28:04] Presley. And it started out seemably so
[1:28:08] innocent. Hey, listen. an anointing hit
[1:28:12] that boy.
[1:28:15] I've sat in the same corner in Memphis.
[1:28:19] We sat there at the table and and sat at
[1:28:22] the same place where Elvis would go and
[1:28:24] play his music and those people would
[1:28:27] come and enjoy his music. Listen, it had
[1:28:31] an attraction to it, right? It was a
[1:28:34] part of a king on the earth, right? He
[1:28:37] was representing another kingdom.
[1:28:43] And he began to take on that role. And
[1:28:46] as he takes on that role, anywhere from
[1:28:49] Hollywood star to rock star to to a man
[1:28:54] that drove women crazy.
[1:29:00] You said, "Well, brother Ron, I look
[1:29:01] back now and I see those pictures. There
[1:29:03] was nothing to drive anybody crazy."
[1:29:05] You're not catching the spirit of it.
[1:29:11] You're not catching the spirit of it.
[1:29:13] Good
[1:29:16] women, good
[1:29:19] women would go to those things and pull
[1:29:22] their undergarments off and throw them
[1:29:24] on the
[1:29:27] stage. There's a spirit that was
[1:29:30] involved with it.
[1:29:32] Satan made him an offer.
[1:29:37] Brother man will say he got a fleet of
[1:29:39] Cadillacs out of it.
[1:29:41] And we go, "Oh, that's so horrible." You
[1:29:44] know, he made an offer, but everything
[1:29:46] has an end.
[1:29:50] Everything has an end to it. Everything
[1:29:52] has a payday to it.
[1:29:55] He comes down to the end of his life.
[1:29:59] I'm not telling you hearsay. He comes
[1:30:01] down to the end of his
[1:30:04] life and
[1:30:06] now he knows where he's at.
[1:30:10] Three different
[1:30:13] preachers deal with him and he can't
[1:30:17] find peace.
[1:30:21] And he repeats to all of them. One of
[1:30:23] them being Dy Rambo. She was a preacher,
[1:30:25] woman preacher. and and and another one
[1:30:29] I can't call his name but Umbar I
[1:30:31] believe his name but anyway he
[1:30:34] confesses I sow my
[1:30:44] soul I have to tell
[1:30:47] you my heart just
[1:30:49] shatters for a man in that spot
[1:30:56] cuz he's in his last moments of this
[1:30:59] earthly life and he knows there's
[1:31:01] nothing I can
[1:31:06] do. Who is a young girl that was from
[1:31:08] here? A soldier. She was a singer from
[1:31:12] here in Elton.
[1:31:14] Paty
[1:31:15] Klein. You remember in her last
[1:31:18] concert, she's singing with
[1:31:21] others and they sing Amazing Grace and
[1:31:25] conviction hits the stage and she falls
[1:31:29] on her
[1:31:31] face. And when she gets up, here was the
[1:31:34] results of it. When she gets up, she
[1:31:36] says, "What was
[1:31:38] that?" She's a church
[1:31:41] girl. Now she's in the music world.
[1:31:45] What was
[1:31:46] that? And a man with some conviction
[1:31:49] said, "That's God's conviction."
[1:31:53] She said, "Whatever it is, I never want
[1:31:55] that to happen again."
[1:32:02] She never visits the stage ever
[1:32:07] again. She dies a horrible death.
[1:32:24] Brother Brandham said there is a control
[1:32:26] tower of the soul. One is the
[1:32:29] body, the tower and each tower is a
[1:32:34] there's a warning caller for the needs
[1:32:36] of the other.
[1:32:39] Each one calls to the needs of for what
[1:32:41] the caller that's calling for. It sends
[1:32:44] out a wave over the
[1:32:45] warning. For
[1:32:47] instance, the flesh thirst to satisfy
[1:32:53] that that's in the
[1:32:55] body. And the spirit desires for the
[1:32:59] things that's in the soul.
[1:33:02] desire is many times these they war
[1:33:06] against one another. We find that
[1:33:10] there's what a great trouble today that
[1:33:14] that too many
[1:33:16] people try to live
[1:33:20] between those desires.
[1:33:27] One of them the desires of the
[1:33:30] earth, the
[1:33:32] other the desires of
[1:33:36] heaven. As I speak in this today, I I
[1:33:40] I'm just going to go forward and I want
[1:33:42] to share some scriptures with you that I
[1:33:45] was going to save to the end, but I want
[1:33:46] to drop them here real quickly for
[1:33:52] you. And I want to say as brother
[1:33:54] Brandon was saying leadership, he says,
[1:33:58] he said, you're going to have to make a
[1:33:59] choice. Choice for
[1:34:01] mate, a choice for your
[1:34:04] education. Hey, education's wonderful.
[1:34:06] And I'm one of the pushers of it. But
[1:34:09] let me just say this to you. You got to
[1:34:11] have the Holy Ghost when you go through
[1:34:13] school.
[1:34:16] Cuz this this world is headed in one
[1:34:18] direction and you're headed in another
[1:34:21] direction. Amen.
[1:34:28] And you may have to give them answers
[1:34:30] that you know is not right to pass their
[1:34:34] classes, but you know that you know that
[1:34:37] you know.
[1:34:42] Are you with me now? Well, well, you
[1:34:44] know, you'll have friends and every one
[1:34:47] of you will have friends that'll want to
[1:34:50] pull you
[1:34:52] Just lighten up just a little bit.
[1:34:56] It won't hurt you to wear
[1:34:58] pants. It won't hurt you to put on a
[1:35:01] bikini. Nobody knows. You know,
[1:35:08] you know. That's right. But we're away
[1:35:11] from everybody. Let your hair down. You
[1:35:14] know. That's right. Right. And besides
[1:35:18] that, you are what you are when you're
[1:35:21] alone. That's right. Don't tell me what
[1:35:24] you are with a hundred people. You are
[1:35:26] what you are when you're by yourself
[1:35:31] because that's where you meet the devil.
[1:35:36] That's where you have fellowship with
[1:35:39] God.
[1:35:46] We've already read about Moses choosing.
[1:35:52] This is a powerful scripture. I want you
[1:35:54] to hang on to it. Hebrews chapter 6 and
[1:35:58] verse
[1:36:03] 4. For it is
[1:36:08] impossible. This is the this is the
[1:36:11] treacherous part.
[1:36:13] For it is
[1:36:15] impossible for those who were
[1:36:17] once
[1:36:19] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:36:23] heavenly
[1:36:25] gift and were made partakers of the Holy
[1:36:29] Ghost and have tasted the good word of
[1:36:34] God and the powers of the world to come.
[1:36:40] If they fall
[1:36:42] away to renew them again unto
[1:36:46] repentance, seeing they
[1:36:50] crucify to
[1:36:53] themselves the son of God
[1:36:55] aresh and put him to an open
[1:37:04] shame. I'm going to make a pretty
[1:37:06] powerful statement here and you can take
[1:37:08] me to task.
[1:37:10] Eternal separation from God don't happen
[1:37:13] at a judgment.
[1:37:20] It don't happen at a
[1:37:22] judgment. And I want to show you where
[1:37:24] it
[1:37:28] happens.
[1:37:30] Jesus was no doubt with his
[1:37:34] disciples. And there was a young man
[1:37:36] that came to
[1:37:38] him. He looked
[1:37:42] apart. And we would call him the rich
[1:37:44] young
[1:37:46] ruler. He had did the
[1:37:49] commandments. He'd been raised in the
[1:37:51] message of the hour.
[1:37:55] His mom and dad had taught him what was
[1:37:57] right.
[1:37:59] And because God blesses and brings
[1:38:03] prosperity to his
[1:38:06] seed, listen, prosperity is no sign.
[1:38:12] And he and he comes before Jesus. He
[1:38:15] comes to the right spot. Let me just say
[1:38:18] he could have went to a lot of places
[1:38:20] but he came to the one that he needed to
[1:38:23] come to
[1:38:24] and he was asking for eternal life.
[1:38:30] Listen, that's the that's the dime.
[1:38:35] Eternal life is what we all want.
[1:38:40] Are you with me? And he comes and he
[1:38:44] what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[1:38:48] Now the scripture says Jesus loved him.
[1:38:57] The scripture he made a choice to come
[1:38:59] to the right spot and Jesus loved him.
[1:39:05] But just because he loves you,
[1:39:09] he loved the whole world. Brother Ron,
[1:39:11] I'm I'm preaching to you now. Just
[1:39:13] because he says, "I love you," there's
[1:39:16] something else for you to do.
[1:39:20] There's something else for you. Two
[1:39:22] powers are at work. Not just on the
[1:39:25] mount of temptation, but now
[1:39:28] with a young rich young ruler,
[1:39:33] and Jesus himself, right? And Jesus
[1:39:36] tells him, he just quickly goes to that
[1:39:39] spot in his life. Go sell all you have
[1:39:42] and give it to the
[1:39:45] poor. And it was a hard saying for
[1:39:49] him. It was too
[1:39:53] hard. Change my
[1:39:58] dressear and and look like a man.
[1:40:09] Forget my political ambitions.
[1:40:13] Forget the job that'll take me away from
[1:40:15] God.
[1:40:18] You mean you're wanting to call me aside
[1:40:20] and and I've got to forget all of my own
[1:40:22] ambitions. I'm talking to you. If you
[1:40:26] gain the whole world,
[1:40:29] if you gain a whole world, say it to
[1:40:31] your neighbor, if you gain your whole
[1:40:44] world, gain the whole world, brother
[1:40:48] Doug. Gain the whole
[1:40:50] world. Who will Donald Trump be on that
[1:40:54] day? That's right. Come on. That's
[1:40:57] right.
[1:40:59] Who will he be on that day? I'm not
[1:41:02] being derogatory here. I'm just pre
[1:41:04] preaching that it's true. Who will all
[1:41:07] of those famous ball players be on that
[1:41:09] day?
[1:41:11] Who will the Hollywood stars be on that
[1:41:14] day?
[1:41:29] He walks away from eternal
[1:41:32] life. Boy, I'd hate to be the rich young
[1:41:34] ruler. Well, how many empty pews do we
[1:41:37] have?
[1:41:40] Hey, I've been here a while. I've been
[1:41:41] here 25 years, and I've been around
[1:41:44] since 1983.
[1:41:47] So, I've been with this church for a
[1:41:49] long time, and I've seen people walk
[1:41:52] away.
[1:41:54] You're throwing rocks. No, I'm not
[1:41:57] throwing a rock. Satan made them an
[1:42:00] offer. That's right.
[1:42:04] Brother Homer preaches too hard.
[1:42:07] Go ahead. They shout too much.
[1:42:12] They got to click.
[1:42:14] Satan will tell you every lie that he
[1:42:17] can tell you.
[1:42:20] [Applause]
[1:42:31] He'll make you jealous of each other.
[1:42:36] Hey, listen. If you got something
[1:42:37] against anybody in this church, you go
[1:42:38] get that thing fixed. Don't go to hell
[1:42:40] with that one.
[1:42:49] I'm sorry. It's a great big thing. Get
[1:42:51] over your pride and get over yourself.
[1:42:55] Get over yourself.
[1:42:57] Get over yourself. Listen, I don't know
[1:42:59] if we got million millionaires here or
[1:43:01] not, but you know, listen, I don't care
[1:43:03] whether you're a millionaire or a penny.
[1:43:05] We are all in one thing going to heaven.
[1:43:08] That's our goal here.
[1:43:19] I don't care if you live in the littlest
[1:43:21] house or the biggest house. That don't
[1:43:22] matter any to me. It only makes you more
[1:43:25] responsible. I don't care what you
[1:43:27] drive.
[1:43:31] Don't be jealous of one another.
[1:43:32] Whatever you drive, drive what you can.
[1:43:35] Enjoy what you can.
[1:43:37] Don't make it a god. That's right. One
[1:43:40] wreck will take care of all that
[1:43:41] business. A fire will take care of a lot
[1:43:44] of things. But I'll tell you what, your
[1:43:47] soul is more important than anything.
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:44:05] It's the truth.
[1:44:09] Second Peter 2 and verse
[1:44:15] 20. For if after they have escaped the
[1:44:18] pollutions of this world through the
[1:44:21] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:44:25] Christ, they're again, notice these how
[1:44:28] it says it, they are again entangled
[1:44:32] therein and overcome.
[1:44:36] So they run the race for 10 years, 20
[1:44:38] years, 30 years, and then all of a
[1:44:39] sudden here comes a
[1:44:42] spirit. How does this work? Listen, I
[1:44:46] know people all over the
[1:44:52] world. Sure is God's mercy. Somebody
[1:44:55] from overseas will say, "Brother Ron,
[1:44:57] you're talking about me."
[1:45:04] I find it amazing you can sit in a seat
[1:45:06] for 30
[1:45:07] years, 10 years, five years and a spirit
[1:45:14] come and it don't take a spirit but just
[1:45:17] a few minutes and what does it work on
[1:45:21] your feelings?
[1:45:24] Brother brother Matt Watkins said
[1:45:26] something the other day that I found so
[1:45:28] amazing. Feelings are overrated.
[1:45:43] And we can get our feelings hurt in a
[1:45:48] moment
[1:45:50] and we can snap and act like a
[1:45:54] rebellious teenager for weeks.
[1:46:06] over something stupid
[1:46:16] I don't have three hours to talk to you.
[1:46:18] Listen, I got news for you. They're
[1:46:21] overrated. That's right.
[1:46:25] Good. when he was the devil would tell
[1:46:26] you he was pointing his finger right at
[1:46:28] you. I got to point at
[1:46:41] somebody. He hasn't shook my hand in
[1:46:43] forever. Hey, I haven't shook a lot of
[1:46:44] people's hand in five years. You want to
[1:46:47] know the reason? I don't have any
[1:46:49] immunity. I've been on chemo for five
[1:46:52] years. I don't want your stinking cold.
[1:46:56] I don't want your flu. I don't want your
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:15] diarrhea. If I told you the truth, I
[1:47:17] told you the truth right there.
[1:47:25] Notice the scripture there again
[1:47:27] entangled and overcome. Notice these
[1:47:30] next words. The latter end is worse with
[1:47:35] them than the beginning.
[1:47:39] The latter end is
[1:47:42] worse than the beginning.
[1:47:47] So where will those believe the sign
[1:47:52] starters
[1:47:56] be on that day?
[1:48:02] Song leaders,
[1:48:07] preachers, you're only doing that
[1:48:09] because you're in the pullpit. You ought
[1:48:10] to test me in the
[1:48:12] office because I say exactly what I
[1:48:15] mean.
[1:48:18] They're going to be responsible for the
[1:48:20] divorces, the suicides,
[1:48:24] people going from godly Christians to
[1:48:27] drunks.
[1:48:29] Women hanging on a pole getting dollars
[1:48:32] in their underwear.
[1:48:34] I know what I'm talking about. I'm right
[1:48:36] on target. I could call names right
[1:48:38] here. On that day, it's not going to be
[1:48:41] pretty.
[1:48:45] What happened, brother Ron? Satan made
[1:48:47] an offer.
[1:48:52] And Satan started to point out brother
[1:48:54] Brandham's faults.
[1:48:56] He had them.
[1:48:59] Nobody here said he was perfect.
[1:49:04] I'm getting ready to go there in just a
[1:49:05] minute. You hang on. But on your
[1:49:09] faults, listen. Don't you put me before
[1:49:11] Jesus Christ.
[1:49:16] Don't you come down to the end of the
[1:49:18] journey and say because of you I missed
[1:49:20] eternal life. I have preached to you for
[1:49:22] all of these decades.
[1:49:25] I have give my life to try to keep you
[1:49:27] out of hell.
[1:49:30] And more than just keep you out of hell.
[1:49:32] Cause you to be a good citizen.
[1:49:42] For it had been better for them not to
[1:49:44] have known the way of righteousness than
[1:49:47] after they had known
[1:49:50] it, and to turn from the holy
[1:49:54] commandment delivered unto them.
[1:49:59] But it is happened unto
[1:50:01] them, according to the true
[1:50:05] proverb, the
[1:50:07] dog is turned to his vomit.
[1:50:12] the dog that licks you on the
[1:50:21] face and the
[1:50:24] s that has
[1:50:26] washed to her wallowing in the mire.
[1:50:30] Now, let me just take a second here just
[1:50:32] to go here. You can take old
[1:50:37] Sally, your wonderful, beautiful
[1:50:40] hog, and you can wash her
[1:50:44] up and you can scrub
[1:50:47] her until you even get down in the
[1:50:51] toenails and clean her up for the fair.
[1:50:58] Even a hog can smell good at the fair.
[1:51:05] But you got to keep washing.
[1:51:08] You got to keep scrubbing.
[1:51:11] You got to keep putting the soap on it.
[1:51:14] But if you don't get its nature changed.
[1:51:17] That's right.
[1:51:21] I'm sorry. I've been guilty of washing.
[1:51:25] I've been guilty of taking a high
[1:51:27] pressure washer from the pull pit.
[1:51:34] Some of you sheep have had to put up
[1:51:36] with me through these years to watching
[1:51:38] me wash hogs.
[1:51:47] I've learned how to wash a hulk. You
[1:51:50] wash him. You start at his head and you
[1:51:53] go to his tail
[1:51:55] and wash possible and impossible.
[1:52:00] and you just hope while you're washing
[1:52:02] him. There's a sheep under there
[1:52:05] somewhere.
[1:52:10] But you can load Sally up in your
[1:52:13] beautiful Ford Chevrolet Dodge
[1:52:18] truck, have the nice shavings ready for
[1:52:21] it. Take her down the road. got the big
[1:52:25] blue ribbon that you've won and the
[1:52:28] plaque that's on it. Take her through
[1:52:30] the
[1:52:32] neighborhood. Take her home.
[1:52:36] Let all Sally out the gate.
[1:52:40] Sally ain't comfortable
[1:52:43] clean. Come on.
[1:52:47] Just get her out of church a little
[1:52:49] while.
[1:52:51] And if she ain't born again, she'll get
[1:52:53] back in the hall pin
[1:52:55] and she'll go to the mud and she'll get
[1:53:05] filthy because that's where she's
[1:53:08] comfortable.
[1:53:10] She wasn't comfortable getting washed.
[1:53:13] She wasn't comfortable at the fair.
[1:53:16] Her nature
[1:53:21] was a hawk.
[1:53:26] What makes us
[1:53:29] different? Once I got born again, I
[1:53:32] never wanted to see an inside of a
[1:53:34] barroom no more.
[1:53:36] That's right.
[1:53:40] Once I got born again, old habits were
[1:53:43] gone.
[1:53:55] Hebrews 10 verse
[1:53:57] 26. For if we sin
[1:54:00] willfully after that we have received
[1:54:02] the knowledge of the truth.
[1:54:06] I want you to read that last
[1:54:18] portion. What happened? Somebody wrestle
[1:54:22] with their own
[1:54:23] will. Their own
[1:54:26] will. These musicians up here, they got
[1:54:28] talents that me and you ain't got.
[1:54:30] That's why they're here. That's why
[1:54:33] they're here. But one guy can take a
[1:54:35] guitar and become Elvis Presley.
[1:54:43] Or become
[1:54:46] Santana. But a guy can take a guitar and
[1:54:48] surrender it to God and play eternally
[1:54:52] in heaven.
[1:54:54] Hey, see this is only a portion where
[1:54:56] you're learning how to
[1:54:57] play. You're going to play in heaven.
[1:55:01] Brother don't like drums. Well, you
[1:55:03] haven't read the Bible.
[1:55:07] God has a portion. God has a
[1:55:11] portion. God has a portion.
[1:55:16] What about me, Brother Ron? I'm sitting
[1:55:17] here in the pew. I don't never do
[1:55:18] nothing. You do not understand that in
[1:55:21] another
[1:55:23] realm there
[1:55:25] is untold numerous celebrities of hell
[1:55:31] would love to have your seat.
[1:55:36] That's right.
[1:55:39] Elvis Pressie would give it all up if he
[1:55:42] could come back just one day. All I'm
[1:55:43] looking for is one day. Said in one
[1:55:45] service, I know what I'd do. I'd run to
[1:55:47] that altar.
[1:55:49] Mary Monroe, if she had an opportunity,
[1:55:51] she'd run to the altar.
[1:55:57] Brother, I don't feel like I do
[1:55:58] anything. I just come in and sit down.
[1:56:00] You don't realize Satan's made you all
[1:56:02] kind of offers to get you out of that
[1:56:05] place. That's right.
[1:56:20] Let's just go to our prophet for a
[1:56:22] little
[1:56:27] bit. Brother Brandham tells us of the
[1:56:29] offers that other preachers wanted
[1:56:33] him. Let me let me you deal with
[1:56:36] pressure. So, let's just see what
[1:56:37] Brother Brandham did.
[1:56:48] They wanted him to quit preaching on
[1:56:50] women dressing.
[1:56:54] They wanted him to just ease up a little
[1:56:56] bit. Leave it out. Hey, listen. Satan
[1:56:59] will make you an offer.
[1:57:01] He ain't coming to you with horns and a
[1:57:04] tail and a and a stick.
[1:57:09] He'll come to you with your friends.
[1:57:15] Oh, Brother Ron, but my friends wouldn't
[1:57:17] do that. Really?
[1:57:21] You see, I got friends, too. Got friends
[1:57:23] in the business
[1:57:24] world. I got friends in a lot of places.
[1:57:29] I had a nurse call me yesterday, the day
[1:57:31] before yesterday, and she said, "Ron, we
[1:57:34] know you're getting ready to go through
[1:57:35] a difficult surgery. We're praying for
[1:57:37] you. We at this place love
[1:57:42] you." You know, that meant something to
[1:57:46] me. That really meant something to me.
[1:57:48] She's never heard me preach. They've
[1:57:51] never heard me preach. Maybe they have,
[1:57:52] maybe they haven't. But you make
[1:57:55] friends. That's right.
[1:57:58] You try to create an atmosphere. I don't
[1:58:00] never tell somebody they're going to
[1:58:02] hell.
[1:58:07] I don't walk in and say, "Well, you
[1:58:09] wearing that there. You're going to
[1:58:10] hell. You're a Jezebel."
[1:58:13] Who's going to h Who's that going to
[1:58:15] help?
[1:58:17] When I was a sinner, that have made me
[1:58:19] mad enough to fight a while. Are you
[1:58:20] with me
[1:58:22] now? Amen.
[1:58:30] Brother Brandham, your gift is
[1:58:32] wonderful, but if you just if you just
[1:58:35] ease up on those
[1:58:38] sisters cutting their
[1:58:40] hair, doing those different kind of
[1:58:42] things. Hey,
[1:58:44] listen, don't mind me. Go back and look
[1:58:47] what women look like in the 40s and the
[1:58:50] 50s.
[1:58:52] I'm not just talking about church women,
[1:58:56] long dresses,
[1:59:00] long hair,
[1:59:04] you're way off course. Brother Brandham
[1:59:06] meets a lady in a restaurant running the
[1:59:08] cash register. Said she must be a
[1:59:10] Christian. Goes over to She's not a
[1:59:12] Christian. She said, "I do this because
[1:59:14] my husband likes it.
[1:59:21] We do it because God likes it.
[1:59:28] Brother Brandon, they just wanted him to
[1:59:30] quit preaching on them. And they wanted
[1:59:32] to know how to get the gifts to work.
[1:59:35] Get it in their
[1:59:37] church. Let's make a deal so you can
[1:59:40] teach us about your power.
[1:59:44] And he said, "How can I teach you
[1:59:46] algebra when you don't know your ABCs?"
[1:59:52] Now, I'm going a little stronger
[1:59:55] here. None of us have been offered a
[1:59:57] million dollar
[1:59:59] check in the 60s
[2:00:03] terms. But they offered Brother
[2:00:05] Brandham, not once, but twice, a million
[2:00:08] dollars to become under their
[2:00:10] organization.
[2:00:15] Now you remember Jesus was tempted to do
[2:00:23] it. Jim a million dollars. It do you a
[2:00:26] world of good, man. I
[2:00:28] mean, let me just not leave Jim. It do
[2:00:31] your world of good. Quit your
[2:00:34] job. I always think about that. What I
[2:00:38] do? Got a million. Quit my job. That's
[2:00:40] the craziest thing you could do. You
[2:00:43] going to have to pay taxes,
[2:00:47] baby. Brother Brandham looks at the
[2:00:50] check and said, "What could I do with
[2:00:52] this kind of
[2:00:55] money?" He said, "Or Roberts, they they
[2:00:58] got to have that kind of money. They got
[2:01:00] to have it to run their organization.
[2:01:03] They got to make $10,000 a service. They
[2:01:06] got that was in those days. Billy
[2:01:08] Graham's got to have that kind of money.
[2:01:11] But if I don't need this kind of money
[2:01:14] to go to those little missions.
[2:01:19] Listen, if Brother Brandon would have
[2:01:20] operated like that, he'd have never come
[2:01:22] to Elton.
[2:01:25] But he had to come to Elton for me and
[2:01:28] you.
[2:01:29] [Applause]
[2:01:46] 1962 which is right before he is going
[2:01:50] to
[2:01:51] preach the
[2:01:53] breach, the
[2:01:55] seals,
[2:01:57] trumpets, the sermons that are going to
[2:01:59] open the book to us.
[2:02:04] Here's where I'm going to come to the
[2:02:06] apex of the
[2:02:08] service. Satan knows I got to do
[2:02:11] something to stop him. He wouldn't take
[2:02:13] an easier way. He wouldn't sell out for
[2:02:16] a million
[2:02:18] dollars. So, I've got to use his own
[2:02:20] self-will and ambition against him.
[2:02:26] We've all heard brother Biscll tell us
[2:02:28] about the green checkered shirt, silver
[2:02:30] tip grizzly bear, th those things. We
[2:02:33] we've saw the visions taking place.
[2:02:36] 1962, brother Random is coming back home
[2:02:39] from the
[2:02:41] camps. And I obviously wouldn't know
[2:02:43] exactly which camps. I asked brother
[2:02:45] Biscll about it. He said, "I would." He
[2:02:47] said, "I don't know." And that's exactly
[2:02:50] how I said, "I don't know." And brother
[2:02:53] Brandham is making his long
[2:02:56] journey back toward
[2:03:00] Jeffersonville. Now I want you to just
[2:03:02] watch. He's in a
[2:03:03] car and he
[2:03:06] loves being in those
[2:03:09] mountains. Calls it heaven. That's what
[2:03:11] heaven. That's beyond the curtain of
[2:03:13] time look like. He loved no
[2:03:17] pressure. He loved it.
[2:03:20] He loved being up there with those with
[2:03:22] the with just animals. He loved those
[2:03:26] country people. Why? He loved
[2:03:28] here. He
[2:03:30] loved being
[2:03:32] there. Now he begins to talk. He has a
[2:03:35] conversation in a
[2:03:38] car and he would say, and I'm not going
[2:03:40] to read it. It's about 30 minutes of
[2:03:42] reading, but brother Brandhams had built
[2:03:45] a
[2:03:47] complex. And in his building a
[2:03:50] complex in his feelings he was feeling
[2:03:53] the rejection of people rejecting the
[2:03:57] message. Hey that hurts.
[2:04:01] Oh brother Ron nobody likes to be
[2:04:04] unliked.
[2:04:08] But we will esteem the reproach of
[2:04:11] Christ greater
[2:04:14] than our
[2:04:15] feelings. But the complex had drove him
[2:04:19] into a spot. Okay? If you want me to be
[2:04:22] his prophet, now I'm
[2:04:23] paraphrasing. If you want me to be his
[2:04:26] prophet, when you give me a word of the
[2:04:28] Lord, I'll go down and preach to the
[2:04:30] people and then I'll go back to the
[2:04:32] mountains.
[2:04:36] I'll preach the word of the Lord and
[2:04:37] I'll go back to the
[2:04:39] mountains. And now he settled it in his
[2:04:42] mind. Remember, that's where the
[2:04:45] greatest battle is.
[2:04:54] You're way off, brother Ron. There's
[2:04:56] people sitting in Lazy Boys right now
[2:04:57] with their feet propped up. Come on.
[2:05:00] That knows they ought to be in church.
[2:05:02] That's right. Come on. With a coffee in
[2:05:04] their hand and a donut in the other.
[2:05:06] That donut will kill you.
[2:05:11] They're sitting there because they're
[2:05:12] forsaking the assembling of God. I'm not
[2:05:14] talking about old people that can't get
[2:05:16] around.
[2:05:18] I'm not talking about sick and afflicted
[2:05:20] that can't get theirel out of bed. I'm
[2:05:22] not talking about them.
[2:05:24] Don't Don't go get your feelings in a
[2:05:27] panties in a w.
[2:05:32] But when you're well and able
[2:05:36] and you make a conscious decision, they
[2:05:38] can do this without me.
[2:05:42] Come on. You got a job to do. It's
[2:05:44] important as my job. Be right there.
[2:05:58] Well, nobody knows me. God does. That's
[2:06:00] right, brother said. when you you vote
[2:06:02] that the church stays open. So, let's
[2:06:04] vote that this church stays open.
[2:06:08] This is God's church. Ain't my church,
[2:06:10] Homer's church, Andrew's church.
[2:06:18] I learned a quote long time ago. Put
[2:06:19] your finger in a bucket of water and
[2:06:20] pull it out and see where the hole is.
[2:06:22] That's how important you are.
[2:06:25] Brother Bram says, "And how can I
[2:06:26] overcome?" He said, "Preachers," he
[2:06:28] said, "Satan will make them begin to
[2:06:30] think and lift their self up, puff their
[2:06:32] chest out, say, "I did it." Let me just
[2:06:34] say, none of us can do nothing.
[2:06:37] I can't preach without him. I can't lay
[2:06:40] hands on the sick and they recover
[2:06:41] without him. I can't do nothing without
[2:06:44] them. That's not just a good quote.
[2:06:47] Jesus says it 17 different ways in the
[2:06:51] New Testament. I can do nothing.
[2:06:56] And if Jesus can say it, the prophet can
[2:06:59] say it, we can.
[2:07:14] So, Brother Random has come to a
[2:07:16] conclusion in his mind. This is what I'm
[2:07:18] going to do. Well, he pulls into a
[2:07:20] restaurant. He sits down. Hey, listen.
[2:07:23] God's more merciful to him than he
[2:07:25] probably would be to me and you. And he
[2:07:27] sits down. He's got these things made up
[2:07:30] in his mind. You hear him? You hear him?
[2:07:34] And he says, "Here come a man in rough
[2:07:37] chap face walks in." And he said he was
[2:07:41] a
[2:07:42] man. He was a man and said he
[2:07:46] sneezed. And he said, "That's a man
[2:07:51] sneeze.
[2:07:54] Remember, Brother Bran's a boxer.
[2:07:56] Brother M's rough in his
[2:07:59] nature. There's also two other fellas
[2:08:02] walk
[2:08:03] in. And even Billy Paul says,
[2:08:07] "Daddy, that old man in those ragged
[2:08:11] clothes, torn clothes, looks just like
[2:08:15] you."
[2:08:18] And he looks, that other one looks just
[2:08:20] like Bo
[2:08:23] Fletcher, who is a man that Brother Bram
[2:08:25] tried to help so many times that was a a
[2:08:29] drunk in his
[2:08:32] life. Now, Brother Bam knows God's
[2:08:37] working. You know, it's one thing for
[2:08:39] you to talk to yourself, but it's
[2:08:40] another thing when God starts talking to
[2:08:42] you.
[2:08:47] And I'm paraphrasing. I'm going to
[2:08:48] continue to do that. You carry out your
[2:08:53] plans and your wife will leave you.
[2:09:01] I wish this could be said in a lot of
[2:09:02] different places. We got too many
[2:09:04] families that are broke up because
[2:09:05] somewhere they got off track.
[2:09:10] Listen, sin don't just accidentally walk
[2:09:12] into your life. Right. You had to open
[2:09:15] the door. That's right.
[2:09:23] You carry out your
[2:09:25] plans. We wouldn't even know William
[2:09:28] Brandham if he carried out his plans.
[2:09:29] Right. That's right. We wouldn't be
[2:09:32] here.
[2:09:34] Brother Brandham carries out his plans
[2:09:37] because notice what he also tells him.
[2:09:39] Your wife will leave you. Your family
[2:09:41] will leave you.
[2:09:43] I'll leave
[2:09:49] you. That's brother
[2:09:53] Brandham. That's a prophet of this age.
[2:09:56] I'll give you some examples from the Old
[2:09:58] Testament.
[2:09:59] Moses, Jesus, and Brother Brandham.
[2:10:08] There's two forces in the world and
[2:10:10] they're constantly waring with one
[2:10:11] another.
[2:10:15] You may never make the who's who. Don't
[2:10:18] matter.
[2:10:19] It don't matter. But I'm thankful to God
[2:10:22] tonight that God made a choice for me.
[2:10:32] Now, in the last couple minutes of this
[2:10:33] sermon, I want to say this to you. I've
[2:10:35] been offered a lot of things in my
[2:10:38] life. I've come up with offers for a lot
[2:10:41] of
[2:10:42] things. Pastor other
[2:10:44] churches, move to a bigger
[2:10:47] church. Tempting? Yeah, baby. When
[2:10:52] you're in the midst of trouble, Satan
[2:10:53] knows exactly when to make an offer.
[2:10:55] That's right.
[2:10:57] Come on. He knows exactly when to make
[2:11:00] an offer.
[2:11:04] Sound good? Sure
[2:11:06] did. Political
[2:11:10] ambitions. I could have been one of them
[2:11:12] stinking criminals,
[2:11:16] too, baby. All of them are criminal.
[2:11:19] That's right. Come on, brother Ron. That
[2:11:22] hurts my feelings. Well, you ain't
[2:11:23] paying attention to the news very well.
[2:11:25] That's right. Come on. Kick back after
[2:11:27] kickback after kickback after kickback.
[2:11:30] You go in and got $10,000 in your bank
[2:11:32] account and two years later you're a
[2:11:34] multi-millionaire. Hey baby, I want the
[2:11:36] same stock you got.
[2:11:45] That's that's hard. Brother Ron, listen.
[2:11:47] This world is not my home.
[2:11:54] It's not my home.
[2:11:57] You girls, you're sitting here.
[2:12:00] I do not care if Prince Charming walks
[2:12:04] into your
[2:12:06] life and comes to Cinderella's
[2:12:13] Castle and wants to take you out into
[2:12:15] the world. It ain't worth it.
[2:12:20] It ain't worth it. I don't care if he
[2:12:23] drives the best sports car in the world.
[2:12:25] It ain't worth it.
[2:12:37] Many years
[2:12:38] ago, man walked up. You wouldn't know
[2:12:41] him. Walked up and offered me his tithe
[2:12:44] check. And then he's offering his tithe
[2:12:46] check. He says, uh, and this is it was a
[2:12:49] it was quite substantial. He said, but I
[2:12:52] want you to let off on some preaching. I
[2:12:53] said, you just keep that for yourself.
[2:12:59] You just keep that for yourself.
[2:13:02] You just keep that for yourself. Cuz I
[2:13:05] ain't letting a dollar
[2:13:21] bill. Anybody got a dollar bill in this
[2:13:23] building? Anybody? Anybody got a dollar
[2:13:25] bill? Dollar.
[2:13:28] Brother Jim, bring me a dollar, Bill.
[2:13:29] I'm gonna give it right back to
[2:13:37] you. Thank you. I'll bring it to
[2:13:43] you. Me and you going to sit at the
[2:13:45] judgment
[2:13:47] bar and there's going to be way too many
[2:13:50] people that sell out for this right
[2:13:52] here.
[2:13:57] I want you to look how thin that baby
[2:13:58] is.
[2:14:00] How thin that
[2:14:02] is.
[2:14:05] Thin. Thin.
[2:14:13] So what he'll do to me instead of
[2:14:15] selling out for money because he knows I
[2:14:17] ain't going to do that, he'll try to
[2:14:19] cause me to get under the pressure of
[2:14:22] not preaching sermons that are
[2:14:25] difficult.
[2:14:29] And so when you see me preach a sermon
[2:14:31] like
[2:14:32] today, because listen, Satan knows
[2:14:35] sermons like this is very destructive to
[2:14:37] his plans.
[2:14:40] It's very destructive to his plans
[2:14:43] because now you have to stop and think.
[2:14:47] Brother Ron said he's I'm going to sell
[2:14:49] my offer. Listen, it's more than about a
[2:14:52] job.
[2:14:54] Don't think carnal here. It's more than
[2:14:56] about a job or a piece of money. Your
[2:14:59] soul,
[2:15:01] it's worth 10 million worlds.
[2:15:07] Teddy, take that to brother
[2:15:29] Jim. There was a boy in a hawk pin.
[2:15:35] because he had been made an
[2:15:41] offer and he
[2:15:49] bit I'm tired of being in
[2:15:51] church. Tired of being under daddy's
[2:15:54] rules. I'm tired of this
[2:15:57] message. I'm just
[2:16:00] tired. All my friends do all these
[2:16:05] things. Sin looked so
[2:16:08] glamorous. But after his fortunes was
[2:16:11] gone,
[2:16:14] after his fortunes are
[2:16:16] gone, he's a Jew and he winds up in a
[2:16:19] hog pin.
[2:16:22] Everything that he's against, he's
[2:16:24] eating the same food just to survive.
[2:16:30] You heard brother Brandham talk about
[2:16:31] Jesus when a man gets
[2:16:33] hungry. This boy
[2:16:36] proves that he'll eat out of the hog
[2:16:38] pin.
[2:16:41] But there's something on the inside of
[2:16:43] him. Come on. There's something on the
[2:16:46] inside of
[2:16:48] him. Why'd you go this way at the end?
[2:16:51] Cuz I'm praying there's something on the
[2:16:53] inside of some people that'll come back.
[2:16:56] Come on.
[2:16:59] I'm praying that there's something on
[2:17:00] the inside of some people that will come
[2:17:02] back.
[2:17:04] I'm praying while there's breath,
[2:17:06] there's still hope. I'm praying that
[2:17:08] there's
[2:17:09] grace. I want to preach grace when
[2:17:11] there's no more grace. I want to preach
[2:17:12] mercy when there's no more mercy. While
[2:17:15] there's still
[2:17:17] time, don't walk. Run to the altar. Come
[2:17:21] on,
[2:17:22] church. I got to get back home.
[2:17:41] Brotherhood, I bid on Satan's offer and
[2:17:43] look where I am now. I'm in a horrible
[2:17:47] condition. My world is
[2:17:50] destroyed. Don't stay there.
[2:17:54] Come on. We'll wash the slime off of
[2:17:57] you.
[2:18:00] We'll wash the slime.
[2:18:05] You may stink for a while, but we'll get
[2:18:06] it off. Hallelujah. Cuz down under
[2:18:10] there's got to be a sheep.
[2:18:12] If you come back, there's got to be a
[2:18:14] deep that's called to the deep. And
[2:18:17] there's got to be a deep to respond to
[2:18:19] it. Somewhere there's a place called
[2:18:22] home. And I got to go home. I got to go
[2:18:26] home. I got to go home. I got to go to
[2:18:29] the place where I belong.
[2:18:33] [Applause]
[2:18:56] I got two notes this morning. Neither
[2:18:58] one of those
[2:18:59] people probably even know each
[2:19:03] other. They didn't know what I was
[2:19:04] preaching
[2:19:06] today. And both of them had the same
[2:19:09] similar statement. Brother Ron, we've
[2:19:10] never seen anybody love their people as
[2:19:12] much as you do yours. And that was a
[2:19:15] true thing. I'm sure all those pastors
[2:19:18] love them. I'm sure they do just as much
[2:19:20] as I do. But I want you to know, we love
[2:19:24] you.
[2:19:29] We love
[2:19:30] you. We love you with all our
[2:19:34] heart. If you love me, you'd come have
[2:19:37] dinner with me, Brother Ron. We'll have
[2:19:38] time for that in eternity.
[2:19:41] But you let me get well here for a
[2:19:43] little while.
[2:19:48] I love you. And I want to make a
[2:19:51] statement to you. I don't want one of
[2:19:56] you, one of you to miss
[2:20:03] it. Not one of you.
[2:20:09] Not one.
[2:20:12] Maybe it does. I don't care what the
[2:20:14] world would offer
[2:20:17] you. It ain't worth
[2:20:21] it. It ain't worth
[2:20:23] it. It ain't worth it.
[2:20:26] I don't care how old you are in this
[2:20:28] building,
[2:20:29] youngest to the
[2:20:33] oldest, even nursing homes, he'll make
[2:20:40] offers. Made an offer to Jesus on a
[2:20:45] cross. He'll make an
[2:20:48] offer. But I'd like to make this
[2:20:50] statement to him. Get the hints.
[2:20:56] get the
[2:20:58] hints. I don't have time for you.
[2:21:02] I don't have time for
[2:21:06] you. I don't have time for
[2:21:09] you. Whether you go to church here or
[2:21:11] whether you're in
[2:21:13] Arkansas, whatever your jobs
[2:21:19] are, a lot of times people are sold on
[2:21:21] air castles. Don't mean nothing.
[2:21:25] means absolutely nothing. I'm going to
[2:21:28] be something great. I want to be
[2:21:29] something great. I want to be a
[2:21:31] Christian. At the end of the day, I want
[2:21:34] to be a Christian.
[2:21:38] That's what I want to be.
[2:21:41] That's what I want to
[2:21:45] be. A real Christian.
[2:21:51] There's a difference between real and
[2:21:53] artificial.
[2:21:56] And I want to be real.
[2:22:01] I not only want to be real here, I want
[2:22:04] you to be
[2:22:06] real. And I want you to know him in the
[2:22:10] power of his resurrection. I truly want
[2:22:12] you to know him. Young man came in the
[2:22:15] office just a few moments ago and met
[2:22:17] with me. said, "I've been in church for
[2:22:18] eight years." He said, "I want to be
[2:22:20] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:22:23] Christ." Listen, Satan make him an
[2:22:27] offer. He just shared with us he's a
[2:22:29] golf pro. This is greater than any golf
[2:22:31] pro.
[2:22:34] That's right. It's greater. It's
[2:22:37] greater. What you're getting this
[2:22:39] morning is greater than Sheffller.
[2:22:47] That's right.
[2:22:49] Satan make you an offer. Say, "I'll make
[2:22:51] you better than Sheffler." Ain't worth
[2:22:53] it.
[2:22:56] Are you with me? And I'm going to ask
[2:22:59] you one thing. Did you get it?
[2:23:03] Did you get it?
[2:23:05] Did you get it? Every one of us here, I
[2:23:08] want you to know, Brother Ron, it's my
[2:23:10] first service here. It's good time to
[2:23:11] come.
[2:23:13] It's good time to come.
[2:23:17] a time to
[2:23:21] come. I'm going to ask us to bow our
[2:23:23] heads in
[2:23:25] prayer and maybe you just like to with
[2:23:28] all of our heads bowed and our eyes
[2:23:29] closed. I'd like for us to have a
[2:23:31] private
[2:23:35] moment and you just like to say,
[2:23:36] "Brother
[2:23:38] Ron, this is a service I needed and I
[2:23:41] want you to pray for me.
[2:23:44] I want you to pray for me. Thank you.
[2:23:46] Thank you. Thank
[2:23:49] you. Thank you. Thank
[2:23:51] you. Thank
[2:23:55] you. Thank
[2:23:58] you. Thank
[2:24:00] you. Thank
[2:24:04] you. Thank
[2:24:07] you. Thank
[2:24:10] you. Hallelujah.
[2:24:13] more than a decision. But I want all of
[2:24:15] us to reconsecrate our lives here just
[2:24:18] now. We were challenged last night that
[2:24:21] our prayer life would be stronger, which
[2:24:23] takes
[2:24:25] commitment, takes courage, takes
[2:24:32] determination. Now, every one of you
[2:24:34] wrestle in your mind with different
[2:24:36] things. An easier way is always
[2:24:40] presented to us. Every time, every day,
[2:24:42] it's presented to us. An easier way.
[2:24:45] Easier way. Don't read your Bible and
[2:24:47] pray. Easier way. Easier
[2:25:03] way. Father.
[2:25:08] The most precious thing that we
[2:25:11] have is our own
[2:25:19] soul. We're sitting here today and we
[2:25:22] really didn't even choose our own way of
[2:25:24] being here.
[2:25:27] but by the election of
[2:25:29] God, the predestination of
[2:25:32] [Music]
[2:25:34] God. You called us when we were
[2:25:37] unlovable, alienated from the kingdom of
[2:25:41] [Music]
[2:25:45] God. We sit here and we overcome. Just
[2:25:48] coming to this church, we
[2:25:51] overcome. We dedicate this time to you.
[2:25:55] We were challenged last night to pray
[2:25:58] more. Unleash that power in our
[2:26:01] life. This morning, we're told that
[2:26:05] Satan would make us an offer.
[2:26:09] One of the reasons this sermon is so
[2:26:11] important is we're getting ready to
[2:26:13] leave the earth.
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:16] Our promise is a rapture. Our promise is
[2:26:20] a body
[2:26:21] change. Satan knows that in that form.
[2:26:24] no longer has a
[2:26:25] chance. So, it can only
[2:26:28] work while we're still
[2:26:30] [Music]
[2:26:36] here. Lord Jesus, I ask you to help
[2:26:43] us. Fill us more with your
[2:26:47] spirit. Help us in the battle of our
[2:26:50] minds.
[2:26:52] Help us in our thoughts. Help us in our
[2:26:56] words. Help us to get over our
[2:27:03] self. Help us with I
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:08] will. Help us to take the eye out of the
[2:27:12] equation and become prisoners to Jesus
[2:27:16] Christ with a total surrender to you,
[2:27:18] Father.
[2:27:21] We raised our hands before you, Father,
[2:27:23] this morning. And we need help.
[2:27:27] [Music]
[2:27:30] We need help. There's nothing prideful
[2:27:33] about us. We all need help. We all need
[2:27:36] help in one direction or another. We
[2:27:38] need you.
[2:27:40] I'll be honest. I come to church this
[2:27:42] morning wanting to draw closer to you.
[2:27:45] I want to feel more of your love and
[2:27:48] more of your power. I want to know more
[2:27:50] about
[2:27:52] you. And we heard this morning, don't
[2:27:56] quote your feelings back to the enemy.
[2:27:59] Don't quote your opinions and your I
[2:28:01] will back to the enemy. Quote the word
[2:28:03] of
[2:28:04] God. It is
[2:28:06] written and the word will defeat the
[2:28:09] devil anywhere, any place, any time,
[2:28:13] under any condition.
[2:28:16] Now, Father, we take you at your
[2:28:18] [Music]
[2:28:22] word. One of the greatest consolations
[2:28:24] that I heard this morning
[2:28:26] was, "No
[2:28:29] man, no
[2:28:32] man can plot me out of your
[2:28:36] [Music]
[2:28:37] hand." Oh, what an eternal security.
[2:28:41] No man, no power, no spirit had plucked
[2:28:45] me out of the hand of
[2:28:47] God. You have not picked me up to lose
[2:28:50] [Music]
[2:28:52] me.
[2:28:54] Father, we give you thanks. We give you
[2:28:57] glory this morning. We worship you. We
[2:29:02] worship you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:29:06] Amen and
[2:29:07] amen. Amen.
[2:29:12] I
[2:29:15] surrender
[2:29:19] all. Oh,
[2:29:22] I
[2:29:25] surrender all.

[3:09:30] Brother Melvin King just a few few
[3:09:33] months ago, maybe maybe weeks ago now,
[3:09:36] we had a service much like this and the
[3:09:38] Holy Spirit was moving to this place. He
[3:09:40] said, "I never been in a place like
[3:09:42] that." And he said it was just like all
[3:09:45] of a sudden he said I was there at the
[3:09:46] back and he said all of a sudden it it
[3:09:48] was like a fire on top of my head. He
[3:09:50] said it just kind of passed by. He said
[3:09:52] then I began to think man I'd like to
[3:09:54] I'd like to feel that one more time. I'd
[3:09:55] like to I'd like to have that moment one
[3:09:57] more time. He said then all of a sudden
[3:09:59] the realization struck me. I can have
[3:10:01] that again. And he started worshiping
[3:10:03] again. And all of a sudden there he come
[3:10:05] again. I can say this to you. If you
[3:10:09] know in the spot that you're standing as
[3:10:11] a believer, you can have this kind of
[3:10:13] moment, not just in church. Hallelujah.
[3:10:16] Not just around other believers, but
[3:10:18] right there in your car, right there on
[3:10:20] your job. Hallelujah. That's the kind of
[3:10:24] God that you and I serve. The God that I
[3:10:27] know will meet you where you
[3:10:29] are. And he ain't done yet. He's still
[3:10:33] got more grace. He's still got more
[3:10:35] blessings. He's still got more healings.
[3:10:37] He's still got more sons coming back to
[3:10:40] themselves. Look at this
[3:10:43] morning. This is detrimental to the
[3:10:46] kingdom of
[3:10:47] hell. But if you could just look in that
[3:10:50] unseen realm and see the kingdom of God
[3:10:52] has been lifted higher.
[3:10:58] Sons have come to their position.
[3:11:02] boot.
[3:11:05] That devil's going to mess with you this
[3:11:07] week. But you do like that brother had
[3:11:09] that dream. That devil kept coming at
[3:11:11] him and finally he said, "Boo devil." He
[3:11:14] said, "The more I said it," he said,
[3:11:16] "the smaller he got and the bigger I
[3:11:18] got. It's time you do like Jesus said,
[3:11:20] "It is written, boovil. It is written,
[3:11:23] boovil. It is written. It is written,
[3:11:26] you can't have my family. It is written,
[3:11:27] you can't have my increase. It is
[3:11:29] written, you can't have my sound mind.
[3:11:31] It is written, "You can't have my
[3:11:32] breakthrough." It is written, "You can't
[3:11:34] have my message." It is written, "You
[3:11:35] can't have my liberty." It is written,
[3:11:37] "You can't have it." You can't have it.
[3:11:39] You can't have it. You can't have it.
[3:11:42] Why? Because I said
[3:11:43] [Applause]
[3:11:45] so. Satan, your offer is off the table.
[3:11:50] We got a higher
[3:11:52] bid. We got a higher bid. Jesus paid it
[3:11:56] all.
[3:12:00] Why don't you give the Lord just one one
[3:12:03] praise? One praise so loud that shakes
[3:12:07] the
[3:12:08] [Applause]
[3:12:15] rafters. Where two or

[3:18:22] everything and I
[3:18:24] will adore you.
[3:18:29] more
[3:18:31] than
[3:18:34] anything. And more
[3:18:38] than
[3:18:41] anything, I
[3:18:44] love you,
[3:18:46] [Music]
[3:18:48] Jesus, oh
[3:18:50] more than anything.
[3:18:53] [Music]
[3:19:01] more
[3:19:03] than anything.
[3:19:09] No
[3:19:11] more
[3:19:14] [Music]
[3:19:15] anything. I
[3:19:19] love you,
[3:19:22] [Music]
[3:19:23] Jesus. Oh,
[3:19:25] more than
[3:19:29] anything, more than anything.
[3:19:34] Oh, more
[3:19:38] than more than
[3:19:42] houses. Oh,
[3:19:45] more than
[3:19:48] riches. I love you, Jesus. I
[3:19:53] love you, Jesus.
[3:19:59] Oh,
[3:20:00] more than lift your hand right
[3:20:04] there. Say, "I love you more than
[3:20:07] anything. More than
[3:20:09] money." Oh, more than
[3:20:16] money. More than
[3:20:18] land. Oh,
[3:20:20] more than
[3:20:23] land. I love you, my Jesus.
[3:20:28] [Music]
[3:20:30] Jesus.
[3:20:34] [Music]
[3:20:37] I want you to look over at your neighbor
[3:20:40] and I want you to tell them, "I'm going
[3:20:41] to be praying for you this week."
[3:20:44] [Music]
[3:20:52] Now look at your other neighbor and tell
[3:20:54] them we're going to make it and we're
[3:20:56] going to make it
[3:21:00] together. I
[3:21:04] love right here in the presence of the
[3:21:06] Lord. Wrongs have been made
[3:21:09] right. Families have been
[3:21:12] restored.
[3:21:14] [Music]
[3:21:16] Anything. Oh yes I do.
[3:21:20] Oh
[3:21:21] more than
[3:21:24] any
[3:21:25] [Music]
[3:21:31] th
[3:21:35] anything I
[3:21:39] love
[3:21:47] you getting ready to just let you be
[3:21:49] dismissed just now, but we want you to
[3:21:52] uh we want to make an announcement that
[3:21:53] we're going to have our choir stay after
[3:21:55] service today and we're going to have
[3:21:57] them practice a song. I want you to do
[3:21:59] me a favor. The
[3:22:01] Lord has dealt with us very specially
[3:22:03] this
[3:22:04] weekend. And I want you as you go out,
[3:22:06] not just this service and not just next
[3:22:09] weekend, but from now on when you walk
[3:22:11] out, I want you, you don't have to leave
[3:22:12] this building. You got to leave at some
[3:22:15] point, but you don't have to leave. when
[3:22:16] the ushers are coming by, if you want to
[3:22:18] sit there and you want to worship the
[3:22:19] Lord, you have a right to do that. But I
[3:22:22] want you to do me a huge
[3:22:24] favor. You want to make these meetings
[3:22:26] like this every single weekend, don't
[3:22:28] you? When you come in, I invite you to
[3:22:31] come in and do what the prophet taught
[3:22:32] us, to sit and pray. I know that you
[3:22:36] love one another greatly, and I know
[3:22:38] that everybody here means so much to
[3:22:39] you. But the greatest thing that you can
[3:22:42] do for these meetings is not to talk to
[3:22:45] your neighbor right beside you, but to
[3:22:47] spend time in prayer reading your Bible.
[3:22:50] We play this beautiful music before
[3:22:52] service to create an atmosphere. And you
[3:22:55] help do that by sitting there reading
[3:22:57] and praying. You make these
[3:23:00] meetings. Without you, we have no
[3:23:04] meetings. I'm a preacher. Brother
[3:23:06] William and Brother Matt are great
[3:23:08] preachers. But without you, we can't
[3:23:11] preach. So you are the assembly that God
[3:23:13] has placed us to be leadership over top
[3:23:16] of and to feed you. And if you could do
[3:23:18] that, come in every weekend as the
[3:23:22] deacons have handed out before different
[3:23:24] things of notes saying, "Come in here,
[3:23:26] be reverent." I believe that I believe
[3:23:28] that you'll see Brother Ron completely
[3:23:30] healed. I believe that you will see
[3:23:32] complexes leave you completely when you
[3:23:34] begin to spend time in prayer in this
[3:23:37] church before the service. It's
[3:23:39] something the prophet taught us and I
[3:23:41] believe it's something that you need to
[3:23:43] do. So God richly bless you as you're
[3:23:45] dismissed. Choir, if you wouldn't mind
[3:23:47] just please staying after today. God
[3:23:49] bless you. We love you with all of our
[3:23:51] hearts. Amen.
