[1:07:53] for brother ed hammermeister
[1:07:56] is overseeing that church now and it's
[1:07:59] the edmonton church and
[1:08:01] i've been there for many many years and
[1:08:05] i'll be preaching in the meeting
[1:08:07] saturday and sunday evening
[1:08:09] and we're going to try to work it some
[1:08:11] way where
[1:08:12] if we can just speak to you after church
[1:08:16] work it somewhere away and archive it on
[1:08:19] our youtube
[1:08:20] and so if that would be possible
[1:08:23] and so if you would remember us there i
[1:08:26] will be speaking with brother tim pruitt
[1:08:29] and
[1:08:29] maybe speed seated just for a moment
[1:08:32] i just want to share something with you
[1:08:34] amen thank you
[1:08:40] i believe this meeting has some
[1:08:42] incredible significance to it
[1:08:46] it was about two years ago that
[1:08:49] maybe even just a bit more than that
[1:08:52] i had a i had a dream vision
[1:08:55] i
[1:08:56] i don't remember at this point but i've
[1:08:58] got it written down brother tim's got it
[1:09:00] written down i think some of my family
[1:09:02] has it written down that
[1:09:04] we were working in the darkness
[1:09:07] and we were standing in the darkness and
[1:09:09] we were doing our very best to get
[1:09:11] people into the light
[1:09:13] it was in the evening time and you could
[1:09:15] just see
[1:09:16] images of people that
[1:09:18] seemed like a lot of people that were
[1:09:19] going backwards and forwards and
[1:09:22] and uh
[1:09:24] we were preaching with all of our
[1:09:26] passion and i looked across the way and
[1:09:28] brother tim pruitt was on the other side
[1:09:31] of the gate and we're doing our best to
[1:09:33] get people
[1:09:34] and when the the gate was open and there
[1:09:37] was great light
[1:09:39] and and on the other side of that light
[1:09:41] was much singing
[1:09:43] it sounded like angels singing
[1:09:45] and there was like beams of light it was
[1:09:48] like your fingers beams of light coming
[1:09:50] out
[1:09:52] and
[1:09:53] and when we actually drove by brother
[1:09:55] tim pruitt's church i
[1:09:57] looked at his window seals and they had
[1:10:00] this
[1:10:01] his night his church's evening light and
[1:10:03] it had those beams of light that was
[1:10:06] going out
[1:10:07] and
[1:10:09] brother tim and i have never spoke that
[1:10:11] meeting there at
[1:10:13] together
[1:10:14] at edmonton
[1:10:17] and when we begin to put it together
[1:10:19] brother harold hildebrandt actually
[1:10:21] asked us to come before his passing
[1:10:24] brother timothy pruitt will be speaking
[1:10:26] with us
[1:10:27] unbeknownst to any of us
[1:10:30] the pope would arrange to be
[1:10:32] at edmonton
[1:10:34] on the same weekend
[1:10:37] i think that has incredible significance
[1:10:40] to it
[1:10:41] because
[1:10:43] in the darkness of all of this there's a
[1:10:46] light that's still standing
[1:10:49] and
[1:10:50] and that will have a lot of that will
[1:10:52] have a lot of uh precedence in that city
[1:10:56] because of the pope will be there at the
[1:10:58] same time
[1:10:59] but whether the world wants to admit it
[1:11:02] or not the the two
[1:11:04] or three
[1:11:05] uh
[1:11:06] most powerful preachers is going to be
[1:11:08] there
[1:11:12] and so and so so if you would just
[1:11:14] remember us in prayer
[1:11:16] that that that meeting would have
[1:11:19] significant importance and so if you'll
[1:11:22] pray for us we have did that meeting by
[1:11:24] live stream over the last
[1:11:26] two or three years
[1:11:28] and this will be our first time back
[1:11:29] there to do that so you would remember
[1:11:32] us in prayer that god would give us the
[1:11:34] strength to do it and he would help us
[1:11:37] to be able to do that
[1:11:39] and then we will come back and get home
[1:11:41] about midnight or about one o'clock
[1:11:43] actually when we get home
[1:11:45] um
[1:11:46] on tuesday morning and then we will once
[1:11:49] we get up and get ourselves shuffled
[1:11:51] back in the in the groove again on
[1:11:53] tuesday tuesday during the day we will
[1:11:56] travel to brother joe green's meeting
[1:11:58] brother joe greens is the missionary
[1:12:00] meeting that will be going on generally
[1:12:02] that it happens at that school many of
[1:12:04] you have been at that school but this
[1:12:06] year they are they're having it in their
[1:12:08] church
[1:12:09] and uh so i feel like it'll be much more
[1:12:12] powerful in the church uh than it would
[1:12:15] be at that great big school where the
[1:12:16] lights are in your eyes and everybody's
[1:12:18] scattered all over the place and and
[1:12:21] this one's scattered here and that one's
[1:12:22] scattered there and you can't see
[1:12:24] anybody in the building and uh
[1:12:27] you know sometimes it's a little more
[1:12:29] cramped in spaces and so you know
[1:12:32] we we kind of get used to our own luxury
[1:12:34] you know sitting with two seats beside
[1:12:37] of us and we're okay but you know it's
[1:12:39] it's okay
[1:12:40] to be a little bit crowded and so
[1:12:43] uh we're looking forward to that meeting
[1:12:45] we believe in brother donny reagan and
[1:12:47] myself will be speaking there and so i'd
[1:12:50] like for you to pray for us there as
[1:12:52] well as brother joe that is conducting
[1:12:54] the meeting and pray that god would just
[1:12:57] be with us in a special way then only a
[1:12:59] couple weeks from then or maybe four or
[1:13:01] five weeks from then we will be having
[1:13:03] our labor day meetings and and i'm sure
[1:13:06] we'll be we'll be full here
[1:13:09] but actually our church is probably much
[1:13:11] bigger than even branham tabernacle and
[1:13:14] so you can imagine the crowd sources
[1:13:16] there so
[1:13:17] amen so
[1:13:19] you remember those meetings brother tim
[1:13:21] pruitt brother timothy pruitt brother
[1:13:24] donnie reagan will be speaking in those
[1:13:26] meetings
[1:13:26] here for us and so there's a great
[1:13:29] things and
[1:13:30] and a lot more on our schedule and
[1:13:33] and uh we're we're just praying that god
[1:13:35] would just give us the strength to do it
[1:13:37] all of this is a miracle for me to be
[1:13:39] able to do it the doctors on monday and
[1:13:42] tuesday gave us a green light
[1:13:44] and we had very dif we had very
[1:13:46] difficult days with those those days and
[1:13:48] left some residue with us for the week
[1:13:50] and so
[1:13:51] we're just taking it one day by day and
[1:13:54] uh
[1:13:54] god gives us the strength to get through
[1:13:56] one day and then we'll we'll take
[1:13:58] tomorrow when it gets there and
[1:14:00] and here's the way i look at it if
[1:14:02] today's a bad day yesterday was pretty
[1:14:04] rough and i just figured well tomorrow
[1:14:06] will be better and it is and so
[1:14:09] we're certainly thankful for that today
[1:14:11] and so
[1:14:12] amen we love you we we certainly
[1:14:15] appreciate all the prayers from
[1:14:17] everywhere brother barry coffey uh
[1:14:19] checked in on me this morning just
[1:14:21] before coming to the pulpit and said he
[1:14:23] just felt led to pray for me and so we
[1:14:25] we're thankful for that that god would
[1:14:28] call on men to
[1:14:29] to to have prayer for us and
[1:14:32] this morning kind of has an incredible
[1:14:34] significance for for me myself
[1:14:37] as i watch this as it begin to come
[1:14:39] together it will have some significance
[1:14:42] for this church
[1:14:44] and there's a song that kept coming to
[1:14:46] me and
[1:14:48] and i i'm no i'm no singer so i'm just
[1:14:50] going to kind of say it to you if that's
[1:14:52] okay
[1:14:54] and it says some through waters
[1:14:57] some through the blood you might find
[1:14:59] that song
[1:15:00] some through the fire but
[1:15:03] but all through the blood
[1:15:06] some through great sorrow and god gives
[1:15:08] us a song
[1:15:10] in the night season
[1:15:12] all the day long
[1:15:15] versus in shady green pasture so rich
[1:15:19] and so sweet
[1:15:20] god leads his dear children along
[1:15:23] where the water's cool flowing bathes
[1:15:26] the weary one's feet
[1:15:29] god leads his dear children along
[1:15:33] second verse
[1:15:34] sometimes the mount
[1:15:36] where the sun shines so bright
[1:15:39] god leads his dear children along
[1:15:43] sometimes in the valley
[1:15:45] the darkest of night
[1:15:48] god leads his dear children along
[1:15:53] through sorrows bewellness
[1:15:56] and evil suppose
[1:15:59] god leads his dear children along
[1:16:03] through grace we can conquer
[1:16:06] defeat all our foes
[1:16:10] god leads his dear children along
[1:16:14] away from the mire
[1:16:16] and away from the clay
[1:16:19] god leads his dear children along
[1:16:23] a way up in glory
[1:16:26] eternity's day
[1:16:28] god leads his dear children along
[1:16:32] did we not find it
[1:16:34] some through waters
[1:16:37] some through flood
[1:16:39] some through the fire
[1:16:41] but all through the blood
[1:16:44] some through great sorrow
[1:16:46] but god gives a song
[1:16:49] in the night season
[1:16:52] and all
[1:16:54] the day long
[1:16:55] amen
[1:16:57] amen
[1:17:00] in that sermon brother branham preaches
[1:17:02] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:17:08] and there was a man sitting there
[1:17:10] that had great significance to this
[1:17:12] church
[1:17:16] and that man was thomas brady
[1:17:20] thomas brady was sitting there not
[1:17:22] knowing
[1:17:23] too much about brother branham
[1:17:26] but he had a letter in his pocket from
[1:17:28] sister brady and that
[1:17:32] that letter was that she was having
[1:17:34] trouble with her feet
[1:17:36] and she wasn't able to work
[1:17:39] and
[1:17:40] and
[1:17:40] many of you know they were working kind
[1:17:42] of almost like indentured slaves at that
[1:17:45] point
[1:17:46] in jamaica
[1:17:47] and
[1:17:48] and they were working for a very wealthy
[1:17:50] wealthy family that actually built a
[1:17:53] home
[1:17:54] like the old slaves would do
[1:17:56] and they built it like that and actually
[1:17:58] had people working for him kind of in
[1:18:01] that same order mother tom and sister
[1:18:04] brady was there
[1:18:06] gloria was there she was a priceless
[1:18:09] lady
[1:18:11] uh
[1:18:12] they they'll probably watch this service
[1:18:14] because they watch them brother tom is
[1:18:16] now
[1:18:17] is as now his mind is a little slipping
[1:18:20] you know sometimes i feel like mine's
[1:18:21] slipping a little bit but uh
[1:18:24] but anyway brother tom was working there
[1:18:26] and he would come to america about once
[1:18:28] a year
[1:18:29] and he would come to america and brother
[1:18:30] henry greene was was taking care of him
[1:18:33] and they took him they actually took him
[1:18:35] to jeffersonville
[1:18:38] and
[1:18:39] and so he would tell us the story many
[1:18:41] times standing in this pulpit how that
[1:18:44] hundreds and hundreds of people would
[1:18:45] wait outside and with the doors would
[1:18:48] open at one time they'd all run in and
[1:18:50] he said it was the most
[1:18:52] unchristian thing he'd ever seen
[1:18:55] and they would run in and the first
[1:18:57] night he he would get set in the back or
[1:18:59] the first day he would get set in the
[1:19:01] back and and then the next day he got to
[1:19:03] sit up a little bit closer and he had he
[1:19:06] had in his pocket
[1:19:08] uh a letter from sister brady about and
[1:19:12] she had asked him when you're with the
[1:19:13] minister would you would you have them
[1:19:15] to pray for me and he had not had nobody
[1:19:18] to pray at this point and he's sitting
[1:19:21] there with that with that letter in his
[1:19:23] pocket
[1:19:25] and brother brother branham is going to
[1:19:27] speak
[1:19:28] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:19:32] and he says what is the attraction it's
[1:19:34] jesus fulfilling his word
[1:19:38] and i'm just going to preempt this just
[1:19:39] for a minute because that's the way it
[1:19:40] feels to do it and just preempt his word
[1:19:44] and that's what he's doing again today
[1:19:46] he would say
[1:19:48] it was god on the mountain with noah and
[1:19:50] it was god on the mountain with moses
[1:19:52] and it was it was god on the mountain in
[1:19:55] a burning bush and it was god on the
[1:19:57] mountain with mount carmel
[1:20:00] and it's been god on the mountain with
[1:20:01] the sword
[1:20:04] and he was taking people from a
[1:20:06] historical reference to prophecy being
[1:20:09] fulfilled
[1:20:11] and he and and i'm going to read the
[1:20:13] text in just a few moments but he said
[1:20:15] what was prophecy now is fulfilled
[1:20:19] and what he's going to say about
[1:20:21] revelations 10 what was prophecy is
[1:20:25] fulfilled
[1:20:27] and let and i want to go even further
[1:20:29] than that so many people want to point
[1:20:32] to a cross but jesus ain't on the cross
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:39] that's where he was at
[1:20:41] but if you want to know where he is at
[1:20:44] here he is
[1:20:53] what you are
[1:20:55] experiences of the bride's revival or
[1:20:59] the appearance of him in bride form
[1:21:03] a people that didn't wash themselves but
[1:21:05] a word came to wash them to prepare them
[1:21:09] to get them ready you are the attraction
[1:21:12] on this hill
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:26] now i want to link some things together
[1:21:28] before i preach so please don't count
[1:21:30] this time together for me
[1:21:36] when we think about where we are
[1:21:39] you didn't put yourself here
[1:21:45] god put you here
[1:21:50] well i tell you what i made a choice to
[1:21:52] be here
[1:21:53] did you
[1:21:55] you didn't make a choice to be born
[1:22:00] but i would agree with someone who said
[1:22:02] it the other day every seed has the
[1:22:05] right to be born
[1:22:08] every seed has a life to be born
[1:22:10] [Applause]
[1:22:22] brother homer brought us up on this hill
[1:22:24] this hill was was full of trees
[1:22:28] he said we're going to put a church here
[1:22:31] i have to be very honest with you
[1:22:34] i didn't see it
[1:22:35] but god had showed him
[1:22:38] many of you
[1:22:40] a lot of you are new but many of you
[1:22:42] worked hard on this hill cutting this is
[1:22:45] a beautiful hill here now but many of
[1:22:48] you worked extremely hard cutting trees
[1:22:51] stumps all different kinds of things
[1:22:54] heavy equipment came and began to work
[1:22:56] and this building was built in about a
[1:22:58] year many of you labored very hard on
[1:23:01] this hill
[1:23:03] and there's a light that shines out
[1:23:04] there with a cross on it
[1:23:07] and this place has represented the
[1:23:10] lighthouse
[1:23:12] sitting here on this hill
[1:23:14] this building has been dedicated for
[1:23:17] worship
[1:23:19] and as andrew said last night we
[1:23:21] preached the message here
[1:23:23] and let me just say this to you the
[1:23:25] message is the bible
[1:23:29] i started preaching early to gabriel
[1:23:31] this morning this message is the bible
[1:23:35] we're the most fundamental believers
[1:23:37] that there is on the earth
[1:23:40] we believe the bible
[1:23:45] we have an open book the author of the
[1:23:49] book opened the bible for us
[1:23:52] it's like netanyahu sit there before all
[1:23:55] those men and said
[1:23:57] here
[1:23:58] is our title deed to israel
[1:24:04] this god gave us this land
[1:24:08] i want to stand with passion in my heart
[1:24:11] this is our title deed to be the bride
[1:24:14] of jesus christ
[1:24:31] hallelujah
[1:24:33] i like it that way too don't you
[1:24:36] i think sometimes we have a lack of
[1:24:38] appreciation of even what we have
[1:24:42] one day this place will be a vacant
[1:24:44] sinner
[1:24:47] it'll slip right into a tribulation
[1:24:49] period and
[1:24:50] they won't even know it
[1:24:52] but it'd be vacant
[1:24:53] we won't need it no more
[1:24:56] i'm afraid people take for granted that
[1:24:58] this is the way that will always be
[1:25:01] but it won't be like this forever
[1:25:04] it just won't be like this this will be
[1:25:06] i think we lack the appreciation of
[1:25:10] maybe not even knowing the cost
[1:25:14] of what it took to get to this spot
[1:25:20] lots of people want to be where you're
[1:25:22] at
[1:25:23] but they don't want to pay the cost to
[1:25:25] get there
[1:25:29] many refuse to commit
[1:25:34] commitment sometimes is takes a little
[1:25:36] skin
[1:25:38] sometimes it takes life
[1:25:40] life commitment
[1:25:42] you don't believe that just wait till
[1:25:44] you end an event
[1:25:46] and about two or three or you're
[1:25:47] standing there to clean up
[1:25:50] everybody enjoys the event
[1:25:58] i'm one standing before you here
[1:26:02] maybe
[1:26:03] no other preacher has stood where i
[1:26:06] stand but i am committed
[1:26:11] just because that
[1:26:13] god chose for me to have this journey
[1:26:16] don't mean that i quit and i walk away
[1:26:20] just because that i go like monday and
[1:26:23] tuesday
[1:26:24] and i continue to be told
[1:26:26] every day is a miracle so enjoy that day
[1:26:30] i would say that every time that i
[1:26:32] preach to you is a miracle
[1:26:34] so enjoy that service
[1:26:45] we're on a mission
[1:26:47] i won't don't want us to lose focus
[1:26:51] don't get tied up in drama of your own
[1:26:53] family's humanity
[1:26:56] it's just stuff
[1:26:59] it's just stuff whatever you have in
[1:27:01] life your house your home your cars
[1:27:03] whatever you've got all of that stuff
[1:27:04] and it's temporary don't get tied up in
[1:27:07] all of the nonsense of life jobs and
[1:27:10] situations and just family faces
[1:27:14] you know just get above that just raise
[1:27:16] above that when there storms that pilot
[1:27:19] just pulls the lever back and he raises
[1:27:22] the plane that eagle what he does it
[1:27:24] just raises himself above the storm
[1:27:34] many men have quoted this
[1:27:37] great men
[1:27:38] if you hear i died
[1:27:41] don't believe it
[1:27:43] i will be more alive than ever
[1:27:48] before
[1:27:52] you've heard me say from this pulpit
[1:27:54] never ever ever ever give up
[1:27:59] and every time the doctor tells me every
[1:28:01] day is a miracle
[1:28:03] i believe that within my heart
[1:28:05] because satan swore that i would not
[1:28:08] live to see this day
[1:28:10] sometimes in the darkness of your life
[1:28:17] god's working
[1:28:19] you know we don't orchestrate these
[1:28:20] services
[1:28:22] but sometimes you don't see he's working
[1:28:24] but he's working
[1:28:27] he's working
[1:28:29] there's a lot of distractions that'll
[1:28:30] come your way
[1:28:32] jobs homes situations of life flat
[1:28:40] tires but come your way
[1:28:43] there's a lot of miserable people around
[1:28:45] you
[1:28:48] miserable people want to make you
[1:28:49] miserable
[1:28:52] hurt people want to make you
[1:28:54] hurt hater only breeds hate
[1:28:59] and it fights to hate you it's a it's a
[1:29:02] life mission to destroy you
[1:29:05] maybe it's because of jealousy
[1:29:09] well listen if you ever want to get
[1:29:10] ahead in life work
[1:29:15] i i know it's a four-letter word but
[1:29:17] work
[1:29:20] work
[1:29:22] not everybody are talented to be able to
[1:29:24] get on a team and they've got ultra
[1:29:27] talent but i find that a lot of talented
[1:29:30] people are lazy
[1:29:34] and just like coaches
[1:29:37] they can see past the talent and see the
[1:29:40] lazy part so they'll choose an
[1:29:42] individual that'll work double as hard
[1:29:49] and they'll pick that one because when
[1:29:51] nobody's looking they're working
[1:29:54] i'm going to preach now
[1:29:56] when nobody's looking and there's nobody
[1:29:58] screaming their names and there's nobody
[1:30:00] applauding them they're running they're
[1:30:02] weightlifting they're you you're doing
[1:30:05] their technique
[1:30:09] and even in spite of that sometimes
[1:30:12] the coach will have to cut them
[1:30:20] i said well
[1:30:22] but does that make you quit life
[1:30:25] no
[1:30:26] it makes you get back up and say i'm
[1:30:28] going to try again
[1:30:31] i'm going to try again
[1:30:37] satan anoints people that are driven
[1:30:41] to tear you apart
[1:30:44] but i want you to remember who anoints
[1:30:46] them
[1:30:48] and the god that's greater in you
[1:30:53] is greater than it's in every one of
[1:30:55] them
[1:30:57] so you just set your wings a little bit
[1:30:59] higher
[1:31:02] now i want to say something before i
[1:31:04] even read my text here stupid people
[1:31:06] will do stupid things
[1:31:11] you just don't have to lower yourself
[1:31:15] to their standard
[1:31:17] can the whole congregation say amen
[1:31:21] so what we do is we keep our focus
[1:31:25] we overcome
[1:31:28] we are on a mission
[1:31:31] we're taught to have self-control we're
[1:31:34] sealed with the holy ghost
[1:31:36] and satan can't get to that gene seed
[1:31:39] that's on the inside of you and god put
[1:31:41] an armor around you and you have the
[1:31:44] spoken word of life and the power of
[1:31:47] life and death is in your tongue
[1:31:55] brother ron
[1:31:57] but i'm surrounded by crazy people
[1:32:00] well let's just i'll give you a
[1:32:01] statement for the morning you can put it
[1:32:03] on your on your refrigerator the more i
[1:32:05] know about people the more i love my dog
[1:32:19] jesus said these words
[1:32:21] these things
[1:32:23] must be
[1:32:25] so we're given the challenge rise above
[1:32:28] it
[1:32:31] rise above it
[1:32:32] we're on a mission
[1:32:34] now you say well brother ron
[1:32:37] why
[1:32:38] did you give us this little exhortation
[1:32:40] before you started preaching
[1:32:42] i had a conversation the other day
[1:32:44] sitting with some brothers and brother
[1:32:46] vernon was there
[1:32:48] and he said something he said and this
[1:32:50] was something that brother homer had to
[1:32:51] fight for years people made fun of
[1:32:53] worship
[1:32:56] preachers made fun of worship
[1:32:59] didn't like how we worshiped here
[1:33:01] well let me just say this is still the
[1:33:03] house of worship

[1:35:36] and say let's have church
[1:35:43] as they were loosing the colt
[1:35:46] the owners thereof said unto them why ye
[1:35:48] lucy the colt
[1:35:50] and they said the lord hath need of him
[1:35:54] and they brought him to jesus and they
[1:35:56] cast down their garments upon their coat
[1:35:59] and they set jesus there on
[1:36:02] and as he went they spread their clothes
[1:36:05] in the way
[1:36:07] and when he was come nigh even now at
[1:36:10] the descent of the mount of olives the
[1:36:12] whole multitude of the disciples began
[1:36:15] to rejoice and praise god with a loud
[1:36:18] voice
[1:36:19] for all the mighty works that they had
[1:36:22] seen
[1:36:24] and they began to rejoice and praise god
[1:36:27] with a loud voice
[1:36:30] with all the mighty works that they had
[1:36:32] seen
[1:36:36] they began to rejoice and praise god
[1:36:38] with a loud voice
[1:36:41] for all the mighty works that they had
[1:36:43] seen
[1:36:46] hallelujah
[1:36:48] blessed be the king that cometh in the
[1:36:51] name of the lord peace in heaven and
[1:36:54] glory in the highest
[1:36:56] and some of the pharisees from among the
[1:36:58] multitudes said to him master rebuked
[1:37:01] thy disciples and he answered and said
[1:37:04] unto them i tell you that if these
[1:37:06] should hold their peace the stones would
[1:37:09] immediately cry out
[1:37:12] i want to say this you i don't want no
[1:37:15] stone
[1:37:21] i don't want no stone
[1:37:24] to cry out in my place
[1:37:31] and when he was come near he behold the
[1:37:33] city and wept over it
[1:37:36] saying if thou had us known
[1:37:39] even thou at least in this day the
[1:37:42] things which belong unto thy peace
[1:37:45] but now they are hid from thine eyes for
[1:37:48] the days shall come upon thee that thine
[1:37:51] eyes shall cast a trench about the
[1:37:54] incapacity round and keep thee in every
[1:37:58] side
[1:37:59] and they
[1:38:00] shall lay thee even with the ground
[1:38:03] and thy children within thee and they
[1:38:06] shall not leave one stone upon another
[1:38:09] because thou knewest not the time
[1:38:12] of thy visitation
[1:38:15] you may be seated today in the name of
[1:38:17] the lord may bless his word
[1:38:23] this text has been written
[1:38:25] read
[1:38:26] millions of times
[1:38:29] men have stood
[1:38:31] as we recognize listen jerusalem
[1:38:35] with all of their prophets and all of
[1:38:36] their
[1:38:37] men of that day most holy men they were
[1:38:40] not recognizing the king was allowing
[1:38:44] them on this day to worship him
[1:38:48] this was going to be a mass worship
[1:38:51] millions of people would be in that city
[1:38:54] the city would be moved that jesus was
[1:38:57] coming he was fulfilling multitudes of
[1:39:00] scripture
[1:39:02] as he was riding into jerusalem this
[1:39:05] would be an entry that would seem
[1:39:06] triumphant
[1:39:10] listen folks boaz
[1:39:14] himself was riding off of the hill
[1:39:17] the redeemer was riding off of the hill
[1:39:21] the coming king was riding off of the
[1:39:23] hill that day on a cult the fall of an
[1:39:26] ass
[1:39:29] the son of man was riding off a hill
[1:39:32] he was greater than any feeble man
[1:39:36] he was greater than any angel that was
[1:39:38] in heaven
[1:39:40] this man would be tore apart that the
[1:39:43] covenant of the earth between god and
[1:39:46] man
[1:39:47] he would tear him apart
[1:39:50] for me and you
[1:39:52] let me just say even to this this church
[1:39:55] jesus will never be just one of the boys
[1:40:00] the reason they took up stones to stone
[1:40:02] him
[1:40:03] he said i and my father are one
[1:40:07] and by saying that he represented they
[1:40:10] were not trinitarian and the jewish
[1:40:12] they were not trinitarian they didn't
[1:40:14] see him as three gods or three separate
[1:40:17] persons when he said i am him
[1:40:23] they knew
[1:40:24] that their churches
[1:40:26] had missed his coming
[1:40:29] he did not have their calling cards and
[1:40:31] he did not have their representation
[1:40:34] and so they had to crucify him
[1:40:38] sometimes that's what the modern
[1:40:40] churches do today
[1:40:43] brother andrew didn't have this at his
[1:40:46] disposal
[1:40:48] but in saskatoon when the meeting was
[1:40:50] set up for brother branham to be there
[1:40:54] the churches in the local area
[1:40:57] the so-called pentecostals and the
[1:40:59] latter round movements
[1:41:01] told their people not to come to the
[1:41:03] church
[1:41:04] not to go to that huge facility where
[1:41:07] brother branham was going to be
[1:41:08] preaching but do you know all those
[1:41:10] preachers went
[1:41:14] about 300 people sat in that place
[1:41:18] brother gunther was one of those
[1:41:20] preachers that was there but he wanted
[1:41:22] his congregation to be there
[1:41:25] brother gunther's church out of all of
[1:41:27] those ministers
[1:41:28] but the garther's church raised up to
[1:41:30] believe that god had sent a prophet
[1:41:34] brother kelly hill de brant his church
[1:41:36] is now the that church
[1:41:39] not regressed but progressed
[1:41:42] but that church still holding the banner
[1:41:44] high are you with me now
[1:41:48] are you with me
[1:41:49] brother vernon's father
[1:41:51] many many of you father grandfather
[1:41:53] great grandfather he went to the church
[1:41:56] here he went to the the armory where
[1:41:58] brother branham would preach
[1:42:01] and and brother branham would stand
[1:42:02] there and preach preach
[1:42:05] seven different sermons if my mind
[1:42:06] serves me correct
[1:42:08] one of them being
[1:42:09] as an eagle stir that's nest and that's
[1:42:12] one that's popular but anyway and then
[1:42:15] uh god's projected love
[1:42:18] and so
[1:42:19] i hate i hate nats
[1:42:22] they're not real tasty
[1:42:25] it flew in i didn't want to leave
[1:42:36] i'm just going to call your name brother
[1:42:38] vernon is a representative family sister
[1:42:40] francis
[1:42:41] your father
[1:42:42] he went to that meeting and said in that
[1:42:44] meeting and watched brother branham and
[1:42:46] he
[1:42:46] and he was not against brother branham
[1:42:48] yet there was preachers all through the
[1:42:50] area that was against and warning people
[1:42:52] not to go to that meeting it snowed
[1:42:54] during that week it was a it was a
[1:42:56] difficult place a difficult time
[1:42:59] and to even get to the meeting but it
[1:43:01] was a packed place and
[1:43:03] and so brother branham would be there to
[1:43:05] preach
[1:43:06] no way that
[1:43:08] your father
[1:43:11] could have the mind eye
[1:43:14] to see a church like what we have today
[1:43:17] and as he sat there listen to the
[1:43:20] prophet of god speaking maybe with his
[1:43:22] broken kentucky language and the message
[1:43:25] going forth
[1:43:27] listen he came to this area a lot of
[1:43:29] people had chances at the word
[1:43:33] a lot of people had chances at the word
[1:43:36] but let me just say this to you here he
[1:43:38] was as a representative and now his son
[1:43:41] would raise up to speak this this truth
[1:43:46] to preach this truth and he was reading
[1:43:49] other material and
[1:43:51] and a brother handed him the message of
[1:43:53] the hour and he grabbed a hold of it
[1:43:56] he grabbed a hold of that message and he
[1:43:58] began to he began to read it and said
[1:44:01] this man is preaching what i believe
[1:44:04] what's in my heart this man believes in
[1:44:07] worship
[1:44:09] doesn't take away from the word of god
[1:44:11] and his eyes became open and he began to
[1:44:14] build a church
[1:44:16] here we are today
[1:44:20] and it's around the world that this
[1:44:23] this has went
[1:44:25] our brother here
[1:44:27] he got a hold of the message
[1:44:29] in a refugee camp
[1:44:33] now he sets here on our platform today
[1:44:35] his wife is in minnesota with her family
[1:44:38] taking care of the little child but let
[1:44:40] me just say this you god knows how to
[1:44:42] lead us in many different directions
[1:44:45] god leads us along
[1:44:58] sometimes we get the idea that this is
[1:45:00] the way it's always been
[1:45:08] i was sharing with andrew
[1:45:10] i hope i'm not going to steal any
[1:45:12] thunder here but i was sharing with
[1:45:14] andrew at the late season of the harvest
[1:45:18] it comes at time to where that they
[1:45:20] they throw the seed and the shuck in the
[1:45:22] air
[1:45:23] and they throw it in the air
[1:45:25] and they pick a windy day because the
[1:45:27] wind blows the chafe away
[1:45:30] and so they throw it in the air and they
[1:45:32] throw it in the air and they throw it in
[1:45:33] the air
[1:45:34] and they throw it in the air and they
[1:45:36] just keep throwing it in the air and
[1:45:38] there's a reason for that
[1:45:40] it's because the wind of the cares of
[1:45:42] life
[1:45:46] they'll blow you
[1:45:49] they'll move you but real seed just
[1:45:52] keeps falling back down
[1:45:57] and you can't shake a real seed
[1:46:02] you can't shake a real seed of god
[1:46:05] you came from god and you're going back
[1:46:07] to god
[1:46:14] i'm not saying this in no direction but
[1:46:16] you will never end this life change a
[1:46:19] goat into a sheep
[1:46:23] but you'll spend a whole lot of time
[1:46:25] working on goats
[1:46:33] and maybe there's a devil in sheep's
[1:46:35] clothing
[1:46:37] and once in a while you'll see the
[1:46:39] pastor wherever they're at have to
[1:46:42] destin to find out if it's a devil
[1:46:47] we don't have that problem here
[1:46:48] hallelujah thank the lord thank you
[1:46:50] jesus
[1:46:52] well brother ron i want to know this in
[1:46:54] this situation i want to know that
[1:46:55] situation in this situation i sung the
[1:46:58] boys a song this week mind your own
[1:47:00] business
[1:47:02] oh won't you mind your own business
[1:47:05] mind your own business and you won't be
[1:47:07] mined in mine
[1:47:26] save you a whole lot of trouble
[1:47:29] save you a whole lot of trouble
[1:47:32] i just gave you a sermon right there
[1:47:34] within a little song
[1:47:38] that needs to be sung in a lot of places
[1:47:42] amen that might keep down people wanting
[1:47:44] me to come preach for them so
[1:47:50] now let's just remind you who jesus is
[1:47:54] the scripture says that go ye therefore
[1:47:55] and teach all nations and baptize in
[1:47:57] them in the name
[1:48:00] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:48:03] holy ghost
[1:48:04] those were titles they were not names
[1:48:09] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:48:12] given and the government shall be upon
[1:48:14] his shoulder and his name shall be
[1:48:15] called wonderful
[1:48:17] counselor
[1:48:19] the mighty god
[1:48:21] the everlasting father the prince of
[1:48:24] peace
[1:48:26] all of those are titles
[1:48:28] but his name
[1:48:32] is the lord jesus christ
[1:48:40] when you say wonderful he is wonderful
[1:48:43] when you say counselor he is counsellor
[1:48:46] when you say he's the mighty god he is
[1:48:49] the mighty god
[1:48:54] when you say everlasting father he is
[1:48:57] the everlasting father
[1:49:02] when you with what so therefore when you
[1:49:04] teach and and go into all nations
[1:49:06] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:49:08] and of the son and the and of the holy
[1:49:11] ghost
[1:49:13] you must baptize them according to acts
[1:49:15] chapter 2 and verse 38
[1:49:18] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:49:22] none excluded every one of you in the
[1:49:25] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:49:27] for the remission of your sins
[1:49:31] you must revoke the jurisdiction of
[1:49:34] satan
[1:49:36] off of you
[1:49:38] that he no longer holds the title to
[1:49:41] your deeds
[1:49:42] anymore
[1:49:43] [Applause]
[1:49:56] now let me just say this to you well
[1:49:57] brother on we come to church we sit we
[1:50:00] sit like church mices we sit like a bump
[1:50:02] on a log why should we be happy
[1:50:05] that alone
[1:50:08] that satan don't hold our title deed
[1:50:11] anymore
[1:50:15] it's enough to rejoice about
[1:50:19] i'm no longer a slave i'm no longer a
[1:50:23] prisoner he don't own me no more
[1:50:27] i've been bought by price
[1:50:30] jesus signed my pardon i'm free
[1:50:42] we can see the characteristics of god we
[1:50:44] can take let me just take you through
[1:50:45] the bible for a moment
[1:50:47] we can see him in creation when he said
[1:50:49] let there be
[1:50:52] and her son brother branham explains how
[1:50:54] he spoke it and son came into existence
[1:50:58] and then off of the sun clinkers of of
[1:51:00] balls began to roll and he would stop
[1:51:02] them at a certain spot god was writing
[1:51:05] his first bible
[1:51:07] and if you remember when god's writing
[1:51:09] his first bible he does everything in
[1:51:11] order
[1:51:12] because when he's talking to abraham
[1:51:14] down here and he told him he said count
[1:51:17] the dust of the sand that's your natural
[1:51:19] seed
[1:51:21] he's talking to a man that is childless
[1:51:29] and he tells him said look up
[1:51:33] can you count the stars of the heaven
[1:51:35] that's god's first bible
[1:51:38] that's what enoch built the pyramid off
[1:51:40] of
[1:51:42] that was god's second bible
[1:51:45] and when you look up that represents me
[1:51:48] and you
[1:51:54] and if god put us there
[1:51:56] there's not a devil in hell that can
[1:51:58] shake us from that position
[1:52:03] if you can ever get it
[1:52:05] that you're not holding yourself here
[1:52:09] some of you that are moody
[1:52:13] to speak to you some of you that are
[1:52:15] melancholy
[1:52:17] some of you that are up and down one day
[1:52:19] one day you meet them they're on top of
[1:52:21] the world they're sailing in the
[1:52:23] brightness blue skies the next day you
[1:52:26] meet them they're in the mud pits
[1:52:29] down in the slum
[1:52:32] come on church
[1:52:33] some of you were around me yesterday you
[1:52:35] didn't you couldn't tell that i was sick
[1:52:37] you couldn't tell that i i was having a
[1:52:39] real rough day
[1:52:41] god's greater than the rough days
[1:52:56] if you could just realize you're not the
[1:52:58] one holding on
[1:53:03] oh brother ron i'm going to fall at that
[1:53:05] one false boy you ain't going to be here
[1:53:06] long
[1:53:10] i'm glad that i'm not dependent on even
[1:53:12] sister connie
[1:53:14] and i thank god she's not depending on
[1:53:17] me
[1:53:27] remember that wind
[1:53:29] if you don't have the seed inside of it
[1:53:31] the wind will blow you away
[1:53:38] we can see him in the power of his
[1:53:40] creation
[1:53:42] we could see him in a cradle
[1:53:43] how he got there
[1:53:46] how he arranged the whole sequence of
[1:53:48] events
[1:53:50] mystery of his birth
[1:53:52] even the stars aligning
[1:53:57] we can see him in disasters
[1:54:00] how did he preserves you and i
[1:54:03] in the disasters of life
[1:54:05] through difficulties
[1:54:07] the difficulties of the very deep
[1:54:10] shadows that we have to go through
[1:54:12] god's not just the god of good times
[1:54:15] he's also the god of very difficult
[1:54:18] times
[1:54:21] don't never blame god for the
[1:54:22] difficulties
[1:54:25] don't never turn on god
[1:54:28] it's an enemy that comes to kill to
[1:54:31] steal and to destroy
[1:54:36] might be a beautiful place if you would
[1:54:38] look but don't you worry she's going to
[1:54:40] change in just a few days
[1:54:43] we're headed toward a lawless society
[1:54:46] to where they don't want police officers
[1:54:48] anymore
[1:54:52] they're going to get their wish
[1:54:55] they don't want real judges as a matter
[1:54:57] of fact there's a there's a law on the
[1:54:58] books right now that they're going to
[1:55:00] vote on
[1:55:03] to do away with all presence
[1:55:12] did you hear about that this week
[1:55:14] it's on the books this week
[1:55:17] they're going to vote on that this week
[1:55:19] do away with all prisons now those in
[1:55:21] prison
[1:55:22] want to get out
[1:55:24] but they ain't good
[1:55:30] people they ain't good people they are
[1:55:33] there because they did something wrong
[1:55:42] can you imagine what the tribulation is
[1:55:46] going to be like
[1:55:50] so don't you cross your arms and get
[1:55:52] defenses against me i'm not preaching to
[1:55:54] you politics i'm telling you get ready
[1:55:57] to leave this world
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:20] brother branham says
[1:56:22] and after he reads the
[1:56:24] revelations 3 that's to him that
[1:56:27] overcometh
[1:56:31] you've got some time today
[1:56:34] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[1:56:36] thee
[1:56:38] because thou has left thy first love to
[1:56:40] understand that this you must realize
[1:56:43] that the spirit is not speaking to the
[1:56:45] original saints of ephesus alone
[1:56:48] this message is to the entire age which
[1:56:50] lasted 120 years it's a message then it
[1:56:53] is to all generations in the span he
[1:56:56] says now history just keeps repeating
[1:56:58] itself
[1:56:59] and in the generations of israel we see
[1:57:03] revival in one generation only to see
[1:57:05] the fires fading in the next
[1:57:10] third generation the embers may be
[1:57:13] glowing slightly but in the fourth
[1:57:15] generation maybe no vistage
[1:57:19] whatsoever
[1:57:21] of the original flame
[1:57:25] so that would mean paul would not even
[1:57:27] recognize his own church
[1:57:30] in about third or fourth generation or
[1:57:33] martin luther wouldn't recognize his own
[1:57:35] church
[1:57:36] in about a hundred years
[1:57:38] or john wesley
[1:57:44] now
[1:57:46] my mother was a cheerleading
[1:57:50] uh she was a queen of auburn high school
[1:57:54] beauty
[1:57:56] but she was a cheerleader
[1:57:58] and my daddy liked her looks
[1:58:02] my daddy was a pentecostal boy and and
[1:58:06] and he took her to a
[1:58:08] to after three years of dating he took
[1:58:10] her to a tent meeting where brother
[1:58:13] fulcher was in and they were having a
[1:58:16] shouting meeting
[1:58:17] she had been raised a dead methodist
[1:58:23] as quiet as it can be
[1:58:26] and so
[1:58:27] dad
[1:58:28] got converted
[1:58:30] and he said i guess i can't see you no
[1:58:32] more she said now hold on just a minute
[1:58:35] charlie
[1:58:40] you need to give me a chance
[1:58:44] at this word
[1:58:47] as i would watch my mom dance in the
[1:58:49] spirit of god
[1:58:53] and i saw her life since i was a little
[1:58:56] boy i was raised in a home where that
[1:58:59] home was filled with tape listening to
[1:59:03] it was a home to where we prayed it was
[1:59:06] a home to work dad would pray in the
[1:59:09] night and you could hear him speaking in
[1:59:11] tongues from the basement i still
[1:59:13] believe in it
[1:59:18] where it would break through my dad was
[1:59:20] not a wealthy man by no imagination my
[1:59:24] dad actually would if there was a an
[1:59:26] animal on the road a fox or whatever on
[1:59:30] the road or maybe a an animal to where
[1:59:32] we could take its skin off we would skin
[1:59:35] that animal so we can have gas money to
[1:59:37] go to church tomorrow night
[1:59:41] he was passionate about serving god he
[1:59:44] was passionate about believing this
[1:59:47] message you know that
[1:59:49] he believed it with all of his heart
[1:59:57] one of his greatest fears
[2:00:00] was the fire dying
[2:00:02] in the next generation and the next
[2:00:04] generation and the next generation
[2:00:06] because no man can hand off the fire
[2:00:12] no man can hand the fire off
[2:00:15] it isn't from generation to generation
[2:00:17] to generation
[2:00:19] every generation must have its own
[2:00:21] revival
[2:00:24] that's why i believe in youth meetings
[2:00:26] that's why i believe in promoting what
[2:00:28] andrew is doing here in this church
[2:00:30] that's why i believe that you youth
[2:00:33] have to have
[2:00:34] your own experience with god
[2:00:53] my mother
[2:00:55] one of the last meetings that she went
[2:00:56] to she went to a church that was
[2:00:58] supposed to be a message church but it
[2:01:00] was dying
[2:01:02] it was a song that was sung
[2:01:05] my mother
[2:01:06] danced
[2:01:08] she danced that night and one of the
[2:01:10] deacons came and
[2:01:12] set her down
[2:01:15] my mom called me after service i wasn't
[2:01:17] there
[2:01:18] she called me after service
[2:01:21] it was in north carolina
[2:01:23] she called me after service and they
[2:01:25] don't no longer believe the message
[2:01:28] but she called me and said said
[2:01:33] they set me
[2:01:34] down i wasn't doing anything wrong
[2:01:39] and i said mom it wasn't them people
[2:01:43] they don't want that
[2:01:45] but god wants it
[2:01:48] i want to remind you and it was only
[2:01:50] months before she is to pass and go
[2:01:52] beyond that veil of tears
[2:01:55] and i said mom i want you to know this
[2:01:58] we will never set you down
[2:02:01] [Applause]
[2:02:12] here's where i want to go
[2:02:14] there's too many morgues
[2:02:18] too many preachers that can get a
[2:02:20] computer
[2:02:22] and can take an intellectual id and
[2:02:24] produce churches
[2:02:27] but they're only producing dead seat
[2:02:30] that's not what this message is about
[2:02:34] when it comes to worship it's more than
[2:02:36] just just singing a song or playing and
[2:02:39] i'm not talking about rock and roll
[2:02:41] music i'm talking about real worship
[2:02:50] jesus wanted on his on his first
[2:02:52] entrance into jerusalem he wants it
[2:02:55] right now because the scripture says
[2:02:58] that he inhabits
[2:03:01] the praises of his people
[2:03:05] [Applause]
[2:03:20] i want to be extremely cautious here
[2:03:23] because i don't want nobody to think i
[2:03:24] got a bad attitude
[2:03:26] toward
[2:03:27] people
[2:03:29] but i want to tell you this there's a
[2:03:31] reason a lot of people can't worship god
[2:03:33] because they don't have freedom
[2:03:37] they're still slaves
[2:03:40] they're still slaves
[2:03:42] and they haven't got over themselves
[2:03:49] i know this is going in a whole lot of
[2:03:51] directions there's a lot of times that
[2:03:53] preachers can't preach this because they
[2:03:56] ain't got it
[2:04:00] and a lot of people that want a clean
[2:04:02] fish
[2:04:04] really can't catch fish
[2:04:12] and you there's a real secret to this
[2:04:14] you gonna lack is
[2:04:17] there's a real secret to this the reason
[2:04:19] a lot of churches are not growing
[2:04:23] is because they haven't learned how to
[2:04:25] fish
[2:04:30] and you can't clean fish
[2:04:32] until you catch them
[2:04:38] [Applause]
[2:04:54] well brother ron we want everything in
[2:04:55] order okay okay well i i just so
[2:04:58] happened to i would have loved to been
[2:05:00] there when jesus was there
[2:05:06] joe
[2:05:09] wouldn't you like to bend there
[2:05:11] when he's walking up the hill and as
[2:05:13] he's walking up the hill people are
[2:05:14] getting healed of
[2:05:17] paralytic conditions
[2:05:18] cancers
[2:05:21] let me just say there ain't nothing that
[2:05:23] the green bay ball game
[2:05:26] could have been more louder
[2:05:28] than those people getting healed of
[2:05:30] cancer
[2:05:35] and told their sins are forgiven you can
[2:05:37] now go free
[2:05:40] and then bartimaeus he knew he had to
[2:05:42] get louder than all of them so he began
[2:05:44] to scream
[2:05:45] because this is his only chance at the
[2:05:48] word and he began to scream thou son of
[2:05:51] david
[2:05:52] have mercy on me
[2:05:55] have mercy upon me i don't want to be
[2:05:57] blind no more have mercy upon me
[2:06:00] i heard about what you'd be like when i
[2:06:02] was sitting on my mother's lap i heard
[2:06:05] you was coming
[2:06:06] it's my opportunity to praise you it's
[2:06:09] my opportunity to rejoice with you
[2:06:26] so a woman goes to
[2:06:29] she hears jesus is at a house to where
[2:06:31] he's not welcome
[2:06:34] and so she looks at the event
[2:06:37] and ain't nobody washed his feet
[2:06:39] nobody's giving him a new robe nobody's
[2:06:41] put perfume on him
[2:06:42] she says i'll do it
[2:06:46] i'll do it
[2:06:48] and she went and got all of her money
[2:06:50] not half of it you ain't got all oh oh
[2:06:54] god wants all your life
[2:06:57] he don't want you to serve him and serve
[2:06:58] all the gods of the world he wants all
[2:07:00] of your life
[2:07:03] and when she come in the anointing of
[2:07:05] god hit her and she began to cry and
[2:07:08] those tears began to fall down on his
[2:07:10] feet
[2:07:13] it don't matter how he was sitting it
[2:07:15] matters that she was crying
[2:07:18] she didn't have a towel but she took her
[2:07:21] hair
[2:07:22] brother brown said you pentecostal women
[2:07:24] would have to that's cut your hair you'd
[2:07:27] have to stand on your feet on your head
[2:07:37] the smell of that manure got in her hair
[2:07:42] the smell of jesus
[2:07:44] got on him
[2:07:46] that's what happens here sometimes
[2:07:48] the smell of jesus gets on us
[2:07:57] the smell of jesus gets on us
[2:08:02] now brother branham had to contend with
[2:08:04] some of these spirits
[2:08:08] he says this
[2:08:10] in samson the philistines be upon thee
[2:08:14] the communists of someone the world is
[2:08:16] upon thee the devil is upon thee
[2:08:19] they go back and they see the spirit of
[2:08:21] god perform miracles and do things of
[2:08:23] his resurrection what jesus promised and
[2:08:26] they say you know
[2:08:27] i think brother branham got a lot of
[2:08:29] mental telepathy
[2:08:32] my pastor said that's of the devil
[2:08:36] you poor hypocritical
[2:08:38] deluded infidel
[2:08:41] all polished up you're a wolf in a
[2:08:44] sheep's clothing
[2:08:45] jesus said if you'd knowed me you'd have
[2:08:48] known my day but you've got a bunch of
[2:08:52] souls that try to make you
[2:08:55] like the rest of the world
[2:09:01] we want a bunch of men of god
[2:09:03] who don't compromise on the word
[2:09:06] but preach the truth and stand on the
[2:09:08] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:09:11] but what the world has done it's it
[2:09:13] shaved off all of your power off
[2:09:17] you were born nazarene or pentecostal
[2:09:19] but the world certainly shaved your
[2:09:21] power off it's just as starchy as the
[2:09:24] rest of them and and water what are we
[2:09:27] going to do what's going to happen
[2:09:30] there's one glorious thing that we can
[2:09:32] think of at the end of this text while
[2:09:34] samson was bound
[2:09:38] and he said we can't have revival listen
[2:09:40] to brother billy graham revival is over
[2:09:42] in our day revival in our day the rest
[2:09:44] of them revival in our day
[2:09:46] how can we have a revival when we're
[2:09:48] bound
[2:09:49] thought about your sermons over the last
[2:09:51] couple of weeks
[2:09:52] he said we're bound the holy spirit
[2:09:54] within our organizations and traditions
[2:09:57] we can't have the holy ghost revival i
[2:09:59] know that's scorching in hot weather but
[2:10:02] but it's the truth how can we have the
[2:10:04] holy ghost revival when you're so bound
[2:10:07] and starchy
[2:10:10] a form of godliness the bible said
[2:10:13] they'd have a form of godliness but deny
[2:10:15] the power the power of what the power of
[2:10:18] organization the power of the world the
[2:10:20] power of the church the power of the
[2:10:22] holy ghost that's the secret place in
[2:10:24] the church
[2:10:26] and when the church adopts educated
[2:10:28] preachers
[2:10:30] big buildings finery in the state of
[2:10:32] old-fashioned holy ghost
[2:10:34] they would be better off in a mission
[2:10:36] again
[2:10:39] how
[2:10:40] how are you going to have a revival of
[2:10:43] the holy ghost and people quench it
[2:10:48] this is our prophet
[2:10:50] how can you have a revival i'm not just
[2:10:52] talking about for this building and
[2:10:53] buildings around the world i'm talking
[2:10:55] about persons
[2:11:00] quench it
[2:11:01] bound
[2:11:02] and afraid of it
[2:11:06] that's where the trouble lies
[2:11:08] the philistines is on thee
[2:11:11] but the blessed one give us hope while
[2:11:13] samson was in jail
[2:11:15] what's the first thing that they'd done
[2:11:17] they caught the secret they bound him
[2:11:19] they took his power away they found his
[2:11:21] secret they found your secret
[2:11:23] and the world found your secret
[2:11:26] you women you bob your hair
[2:11:28] it's just like the rest of the world you
[2:11:30] mean go around and act like the world
[2:11:32] tell jury jokes go out smoke a few
[2:11:34] cigarettes and run around with your
[2:11:36] neighbors wives and everything else like
[2:11:38] that have a little social drink to hold
[2:11:40] your job i'd rather lay on my belly and
[2:11:42] eat soda crackers and drink branch water
[2:11:45] and stay clean and pure before god than
[2:11:47] to compromise on any kind of a job
[2:11:52] that's right that's true
[2:11:57] branham tabernacle
[2:12:00] worley is this creeping in among you
[2:12:03] what about you have you exposed your
[2:12:05] secret
[2:12:06] have you exposed the secret that god
[2:12:08] gave you when you were wallow into the
[2:12:10] sawdust a few years ago
[2:12:12] have you let it sleep slip out by social
[2:12:15] formal worship
[2:12:16] what's happened to you
[2:12:18] god can come down and perform a miracle
[2:12:20] and go right down through the audience
[2:12:22] and tell people the secrets of their
[2:12:23] heart and everything heal the sick and
[2:12:25] the afflicted do signs and wonders and
[2:12:27] preach the gospel as hard as they can by
[2:12:29] the holy spirit and people say well i
[2:12:32] guess that's all right we enjoy
[2:12:33] listening to it once in a while
[2:12:36] if we're not too tired
[2:12:39] brother branham was dealing with that
[2:12:46] in 1959
[2:12:49] how much more as that spirit wants to
[2:12:51] escalate
[2:12:53] it's not going to stay in the
[2:12:54] pentecostal hole in this movie let's
[2:12:55] move right into the bride
[2:12:58] social form of worship
[2:13:01] social form of worship
[2:13:05] wants to calm the holy ghost down
[2:13:09] let me just say this you if that's
[2:13:11] trying to get on you shake it off
[2:13:18] when used to be the preaching of the
[2:13:20] word the old saints with tears in their
[2:13:22] eyes
[2:13:23] would rise in their feet walking sobbing
[2:13:25] maybe not saying a word just walking
[2:13:27] around two or three times it's set down
[2:13:30] so filled with the holy ghost
[2:13:33] the word fed them
[2:13:35] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:13:37] every word that proceedeth out of the
[2:13:39] mouth of god
[2:13:41] remember when jesus came down off of
[2:13:43] that mountain those people got under a
[2:13:45] spirit
[2:13:47] and they began to worship with all their
[2:13:50] heart
[2:13:51] there was an anointing that hit them
[2:13:53] they pulled down the palm branches they
[2:13:56] throwed their clothes in the way there
[2:13:58] was an anointed same group will be
[2:14:00] screaming crucify him in a few days
[2:14:03] but god's anointing hid them
[2:14:06] and they began to worship him
[2:14:10] preachers came and said don't do that
[2:14:14] tell them not to do that tell them
[2:14:16] rebuke them for worshiping you
[2:14:19] and jesus said if i do
[2:14:22] the rocks will cry out
[2:14:34] brother homer's favorite sermon from
[2:14:36] brother branham was
[2:14:38] amnesia was a reason why he had i spent
[2:14:42] a lot of personal time with him he
[2:14:43] preached to me about every day
[2:14:47] there was a reason that that sermon was
[2:14:49] his favorite sermon
[2:14:51] as he saw the modern pentecost forget
[2:14:54] where they came from
[2:14:57] they came from a movement to world that
[2:14:59] bullets being shot through the windows
[2:15:01] and women dancing in the holy ghost
[2:15:03] bullets falling off of their dresses
[2:15:07] people continued but worley is in god
[2:15:09] among them
[2:15:11] so much so that brother branham would
[2:15:13] never be welcomed back in those kind of
[2:15:15] assemblies
[2:15:17] but i've said it now and i'll say it
[2:15:18] again as long as i live brother
[2:15:21] branham's message is always welcome
[2:15:25] in this pulpit
[2:15:39] why should we worship
[2:15:45] we have found our future home
[2:15:50] we have found our theophany in this word
[2:15:54] we have found the open book
[2:15:57] we see where we are we're the blood
[2:15:59] washed
[2:16:01] the redeemed bride of jesus christ we
[2:16:04] stand as our wedding garment is placed
[2:16:07] upon us
[2:16:08] we're washed by the word of the lamb
[2:16:11] the creeds and dogmas of denomination
[2:16:14] has been washed away from our lives
[2:16:18] we've had to repent of a lot of things
[2:16:20] in our lives but that's a zeal of this
[2:16:22] hour repent from false doctrines
[2:16:26] for repent from false leadings
[2:16:29] allow ourself to get clean
[2:16:37] now you say well what does that mean
[2:16:39] brother iran
[2:16:41] there's always spirits in the earth
[2:16:43] and you'll be attached to certain
[2:16:45] spirits
[2:16:46] and that's like a little spirit of lust
[2:16:48] to get on a man or a woman
[2:16:50] bad as a in this day as it is anyway
[2:16:53] but they'll begin to kind of begin to
[2:16:55] look at a little pornography
[2:16:57] before long a little spirit ignites and
[2:16:59] that's the only thing that they relish
[2:17:01] during the day
[2:17:02] it's just to get back to that little
[2:17:04] pornography get back to the little point
[2:17:06] and that little pornography will become
[2:17:07] video after a little while
[2:17:09] and after a while their mate won't
[2:17:12] satisfy them
[2:17:14] preaching to you
[2:17:16] their mate won't satisfy them because
[2:17:19] they are not going to do what
[2:17:23] and before long they're chasing the
[2:17:25] wrong kind of a woman and they never
[2:17:27] thought they'd be there
[2:17:29] they never thought they'd have illicit
[2:17:31] illicit acts outside of their marriage
[2:17:34] vows they never thought they'd get there
[2:17:35] but sin takes you further
[2:17:42] then you ever thought you would go and
[2:17:44] before long you wake up in the wrong bed
[2:17:50] [Music]
[2:17:59] that's what happens in churches
[2:18:03] that's what happens in churches
[2:18:06] before long it's all right to sit still
[2:18:08] dead
[2:18:10] before long you don't have time to pray
[2:18:13] before long you don't have a
[2:18:15] breakthrough in your life
[2:18:17] and so all of a sudden you see everybody
[2:18:19] else rallying and you go
[2:18:21] what's going on because you didn't keep
[2:18:22] your focus
[2:18:25] don't blame your neighbor don't blame
[2:18:27] the one across the hill you
[2:18:29] didn't keep your focus
[2:18:40] we're gonna get on a plane wednesday
[2:18:44] now i cannot just get up in the morning
[2:18:47] connie fixed me

[2:19:00] i can't just sit there and drink my
[2:19:02] my little whatever i'm drinking and just
[2:19:05] drink that down and go

[2:19:33] charlottesville
[2:19:35] and i walk in and i go i'm ready to fly
[2:19:37] that baby's gone
[2:19:41] that baby's gone
[2:19:43] i'm not prophesying your connie
[2:19:50] that baby's gone you're supposed to been
[2:19:51] here at 6 30.
[2:19:53] actually we called you at six o'clock
[2:19:56] and we called your name over and over
[2:19:58] and over again
[2:20:01] a lot of people in churches like this
[2:20:03] one
[2:20:04] are doing just that
[2:20:09] the rapture has been told about us for
[2:20:11] decades
[2:20:13] don't say i didn't hear it
[2:20:17] your mind was listening somewhere else
[2:20:24] and you were worshiping this and this
[2:20:26] and this and that and you missed the
[2:20:28] king
[2:20:30] there was a lot of people busy getting a
[2:20:32] wife and getting getting a plow on the
[2:20:34] field and doing a lot of different
[2:20:36] things or getting a house and they
[2:20:37] missed the king
[2:20:39] don't miss the king
[2:20:49] i actually listened to brother tim
[2:20:51] pruitt
[2:20:53] three times last week three times he
[2:20:56] preached it sunday morning and i
[2:20:58] listened to it three times
[2:21:01] brother tim sermon was somewhere around
[2:21:03] over just over two hours
[2:21:05] he'll be coming here and
[2:21:07] at labor day
[2:21:09] we know what he is before he comes here
[2:21:12] we love the word
[2:21:15] people can go to cracker barrel and sit
[2:21:18] for two and a half hours
[2:21:23] [Applause]
[2:21:33] we begin to talk about bypassing
[2:21:36] our theophany
[2:21:38] bypassing bypassing being born again and
[2:21:41] raised up through your parents
[2:21:43] just to become adult again to become 18
[2:21:45] years old again
[2:21:46] bypassing that
[2:21:48] you made a statement that just kept
[2:21:50] resounding in my heart
[2:21:52] he said maybe there's some among you
[2:21:54] maybe some of your family
[2:21:56] that you want to see them saved
[2:21:59] said
[2:22:00] try to get them saved before the rapture
[2:22:02] because after the rapture
[2:22:05] the grace will leave the gentiles and go
[2:22:07] to the
[2:22:08] go to the jews
[2:22:10] and if they're not saved now they'll
[2:22:12] never get saved
[2:22:15] i just said a real important thing
[2:22:20] and you're standing there in your young
[2:22:22] body and your loved ones will see you in
[2:22:25] that young body it'll be their only
[2:22:28] opportunity to see you in that young
[2:22:30] body
[2:22:33] and hopefully it will give them
[2:22:35] enough strength to give them strength to
[2:22:39] get through
[2:22:42] the tribulation period and maybe give
[2:22:44] their lives for it
[2:22:48] you think about what grace and strength
[2:22:50] will be
[2:22:52] we preached this message for decades now
[2:22:55] i've been preaching since 1984 for
[2:22:58] decades now
[2:23:00] and now we're coming to an end we're
[2:23:02] standing on the very cliff of the end
[2:23:04] coming right there
[2:23:09] how many people are sitting in pews like
[2:23:11] that
[2:23:12] and they sit there for decades
[2:23:21] listen it's coming
[2:23:25] and while others were worshiping
[2:23:28] i don't want to be one of those that
[2:23:30] missed it
[2:23:39] i preached this in 2003 in lima ohio
[2:23:44] i don't know many any of you heard it
[2:23:46] also and i preached it just before
[2:23:49] in the autopsy of a dead church
[2:23:52] at billy andrews thanksgiving camp
[2:23:54] meeting
[2:23:56] i think that's before recordings but i
[2:24:00] used this quote in 1965 brother branham
[2:24:03] says he said a true picture of the
[2:24:04] modern church today
[2:24:06] neither does the modern church wanted
[2:24:08] these screaming
[2:24:09] shouting
[2:24:10] tongue speaking acts 2 38 youngans
[2:24:13] around her
[2:24:15] she don't wanted them whooping and
[2:24:17] crying and screaming amen hallelujah
[2:24:20] why such a child would immediately
[2:24:24] be put out of her denomination they had
[2:24:27] one back like in their churches while
[2:24:28] they'd throw her out real quickly why
[2:24:30] are you letting such of this going on
[2:24:32] you see she's pregnanted with something
[2:24:35] because she's bringing forth
[2:24:38] members all the time but she don't want
[2:24:40] none of them screaming hollering
[2:24:42] blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures
[2:24:45] that she thinks that they are it would
[2:24:48] certainly embarrass her it would ruin
[2:24:50] her educated ethical scientific society
[2:24:54] church that she belonged to here
[2:24:57] they would throw her out at the next
[2:24:59] council
[2:25:02] she can't have it
[2:25:04] she don't want to be pregnant with the
[2:25:06] word because that's the only kind that
[2:25:09] the word can bring forth
[2:25:14] andrew was preaching a meeting in ohio
[2:25:19] and it was overheard by several people
[2:25:21] as andrew is preaching in ohio at a camp
[2:25:24] meeting that a lot of things are going
[2:25:26] on a preacher said it in the meeting and
[2:25:28] he said that guy's just like his daddy
[2:25:34] i'm proud of andrew
[2:25:44] but i couldn't give this to andrew
[2:25:47] but he met the same pillar of fire that
[2:25:49] i met
[2:25:51] a long time ago those screaming shouting
[2:25:54] acts 2 38 miserable creatures i'm one of
[2:25:57] them
[2:25:59] [Applause]
[2:26:24] now i wanna i wanna one of the most
[2:26:26] precious pictures that hangs in my
[2:26:28] office is this picture hangs at home
[2:26:32] this is brother branham standing on the
[2:26:34] top of a pulpit
[2:26:37] top
[2:26:40] brother random got excited
[2:26:43] he jumped up on the top of the pulpit my
[2:26:44] understanding more than one time jumped
[2:26:46] on top of the pulpit got to speaking in
[2:26:48] tongues and was was waving his feet
[2:26:51] backwards and forwards
[2:26:53] when he came to himself he was down in
[2:26:55] the middle of the aisle going around and
[2:26:56] around speaking in tongues
[2:26:59] that's my prophet
[2:27:02] [Applause]
[2:27:13] my understanding is brother branham and
[2:27:14] after the church was over with a lot of
[2:27:16] times he'd have his coat going like this
[2:27:18] outside the building
[2:27:22] that's my prophet
[2:27:23] you don't believe that he was up on a
[2:27:25] mountain and he got to worship in the
[2:27:27] lord and he was going around the tree
[2:27:29] speaking in toms animals was watching
[2:27:32] him
[2:27:34] that's my prophet
[2:27:36] [Applause]
[2:27:46] if you're in a hurry this probably ain't
[2:27:47] the meeting you want to be in a hurry

[2:27:52] if i can do this with fourth stage
[2:27:54] cancer how about you

[2:28:18] the other day and he said we look at
[2:28:20] your x-rays
[2:28:22] he said you got all kind of cancer in
[2:28:24] there let me just say i don't care if it
[2:28:26] feels completely up with cancer god's
[2:28:28] greater than that
[2:28:31] he'll take those dead cells and breathe
[2:28:33] through those dead cells and i'll stand
[2:28:36] here and preach the word of god to you
[2:28:38] as long as i got breath in my lungs
[2:28:57] you guys are pentecostal yes sir acts 2.
[2:29:02] none of us here have ever been in a
[2:29:04] modern pentecostal church so you can't
[2:29:07] accuse us of that we got this from the
[2:29:10] message
[2:29:13] this worship came from the message
[2:29:17] this music came from the message
[2:29:20] [Applause]
[2:29:31] i'm going to send you a letter this week
[2:29:32] brother ron
[2:29:36] i got a trash bin for that
[2:29:40] oh i got a trash bin for that
[2:29:50] block and delete
[2:29:53] are two great weapons
[2:29:58] i can prove anything that's without
[2:30:00] emotion is dead
[2:30:04] this is a prophet
[2:30:05] so your religion hasn't got any emotion
[2:30:08] in it
[2:30:09] bury it
[2:30:11] somewhere and get one that's got life in
[2:30:13] it
[2:30:16] well brother branham that's emotional
[2:30:18] it's just emotional
[2:30:21] well i can scientifically prove to you
[2:30:23] that anything without emotion
[2:30:26] is dead
[2:30:28] so if your religion hasn't got any
[2:30:31] emotion to it
[2:30:33] bury
[2:30:34] the thing
[2:30:36] because it's no good it's dead
[2:30:44] i've had brothers tell me said we need
[2:30:45] to take the emotion out of it well take
[2:30:47] the emotion out of your marriage
[2:31:00] take the emotion out of your marriage
[2:31:04] and get yourself a mannequin
[2:31:12] i ain't gonna stay long here
[2:31:16] too many people carnal i ain't staying
[2:31:18] too long here
[2:31:20] god ain't marrying no mannequin
[2:31:24] he ain't coming back for pictures on the
[2:31:26] wand paint's in your library
[2:31:29] if birds praise the lord and cows praise
[2:31:32] the lord
[2:31:34] and every animal praises the lord and
[2:31:37] the creatures in the sea praises the
[2:31:39] lord he's gonna marry a wife that's
[2:31:42] going to worship him
[2:31:48] hallelujah
[2:32:04] oh
[2:32:15] everywhere jesus says
[2:32:17] there's a lot of noise
[2:32:21] where god is
[2:32:23] makes a lot of noise
[2:32:26] i don't know why it is
[2:32:28] but they do
[2:32:30] anything without noise
[2:32:32] without emotion
[2:32:34] is dead
[2:32:37] i'm taking my time so you get it
[2:32:43] that's scientific
[2:32:46] and if your religion
[2:32:48] has got little no emotion in it
[2:32:52] you need to bury it
[2:32:55] i have read you
[2:32:57] just only a few of quotes of the prophet
[2:33:00] of god
[2:33:03] i don't need to read you the hundreds
[2:33:05] that is there
[2:33:10] can i read you one more
[2:33:13] anything that's alive has emotion
[2:33:17] and anything that doesn't have emotion
[2:33:19] is dead
[2:33:21] and excuse the expression but i think it
[2:33:24] all we ought to bury some of this
[2:33:26] emotionless religion
[2:33:29] because it's dead
[2:33:33] it has no emotion to it anything that
[2:33:35] has not emotion should be buried
[2:33:38] because
[2:33:41] it is emotional
[2:33:44] the new birth
[2:33:48] oh listen you can get the birth without
[2:33:50] the emotion but let me just say emotion
[2:33:52] comes with it
[2:33:56] emotion comes with it
[2:33:59] speaking in tongues comes with it seeing
[2:34:02] visions comes with it dreaming dreams
[2:34:04] comes with it anointed to worship comes
[2:34:08] with it
[2:34:10] everything that hath breath praise ye
[2:34:14] the lord
[2:34:17] [Applause]
[2:34:50] i don't know about you but i tell jesus
[2:34:52] every day how much i love him
[2:34:55] every day

[2:35:20] somebody else i want him to hear it from
[2:35:21] me
