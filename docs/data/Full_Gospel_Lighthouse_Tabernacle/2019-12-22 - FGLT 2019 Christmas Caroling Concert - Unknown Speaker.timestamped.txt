[20:38] God bless you as we begin to start into
[20:41] the Christmas concert this evening we
[20:44] welcome you to Full Gospel Light House
[20:48] Tabernacle our very first Christmas
[20:50] caroling concert and it is our honor to
[20:53] have our King of Kings and our Lord of
[20:56] lords here with us none other than the
[20:58] Lord Jesus Christ and it is an honor
[21:01] that you would join us as we would lift
[21:03] up phrases to the great I am caroling is
[21:08] one of the oldest of Christmas
[21:10] traditions caroling is is to sing a song
[21:14] of joy and exultation to sing a song of
[21:17] devotion to praise or celebrate in song
[21:21] and even though we may not know exactly
[21:23] how Christmas carolling per se began it
[21:27] is a tradition that is still loved by
[21:29] many it is a heartwarming way to let
[21:33] people know that you are thinking of
[21:34] them it also tends to awaken the
[21:37] Christmas spirit in those that are
[21:40] listening and that's what tonight is all
[21:43] about as sister Cassie would begin to
[21:45] play some Christmas songs as we would
[21:48] prepare to move into these things and
[21:50] that's what tonight is all about a time
[21:53] of singing songs of devotion and
[21:56] celebration we know that Christ was not
[21:59] necessarily born on December the 25th
[22:02] but is a time in which we do not
[22:05] celebrate his birth but we worship that
[22:07] he came
[22:08] tonight is a night about singing and
[22:11] devoting our life to Christ singing
[22:13] songs of devotion and celebration that
[22:16] God is here and that God is with us and
[22:19] that God is for us and I have found in
[22:22] my life that when my spirit is home or
[22:25] my way is daily that it was in times of
[22:28] worshipping Christ when my joy was
[22:31] restored and my way that was once dim
[22:35] was now lit by the light of the world so
[22:38] I pray tonight that while we sing these
[22:40] songs of exhortation that you would find
[22:44] the true meaning of Christmas and that
[22:46] Christ would be born in your heart a new
[22:49] or afresh on this day Christmas is such
[22:54] a beautiful season to see the Spirit of
[22:57] Christ upon the people everyone is
[23:00] smiling saying hello to one another
[23:03] that's kind of hard in the day that we
[23:05] live in everyone is wishing each other
[23:09] own Merry Christmas and a happy new year
[23:11] but Christmas is a time of giving
[23:15] it's a time of joy - time of tradition a
[23:18] time spent with family a time when
[23:22] memories are made and we trust the
[23:23] memories are made here this evening for
[23:25] you it's a time when we seem to add on
[23:28] five pounds of weight just by eating
[23:32] maybe that extra apple dumpling or a
[23:35] piece of
[23:36] [Music]
[23:39] or maybe an extra cinnamon rolls but to
[23:44] me Christmases is a time of love it's a
[23:49] time of reflection when we as humans
[23:52] fall in love again all over
[23:55] fall in love all over again with our
[23:57] maker fall in love again with our Lord
[24:01] fall in love again with our Savior it's
[24:04] a time when we reflect upon the
[24:06] greatness of God and his condescension
[24:08] from glory to a manger from the highest
[24:11] heights all the way to the lowest folks
[24:14] to become be born in a manger
[24:18] Christmas is a time when we fall in love
[24:20] with how Christ was made like us
[24:24] so that he could feel like us
[24:27] you would be hurt and understand bruises
[24:30] like us to breathe like us we may enjoy
[24:35] it but Christmas isn't about Holi
[24:38] it isn't about Santa Claus Christmas is
[24:42] not about the lights or the mistletoe
[24:44] even though we may enjoy that it's not
[24:48] about those extra 15 minutes from
[24:50] Christmas cookies in the oven Christmas
[24:54] isn't about the tree or the presents
[24:56] under the jury but Christmas is about
[24:59] Christ Jesus would say in John 14 and 19
[25:03] in Matthew 28 and 20 then a little while
[25:06] in the world seeth me no more yet you
[25:08] shall see me for I will be with you even
[25:12] in you to the end of the age
[25:13] Christ in the manger no Christ in you
[25:18] we're not worshipping Christ in a manger
[25:20] but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the
[25:23] hope of life the Creator God Himself
[25:26] dwelling in the human being does not yet
[25:28] appear what we shall be but we will see
[25:32] him as he is we will be made like him
[25:36] tonight is about the greatest love story
[25:39] that's ever been told at this time
[25:42] sister Barbara and sister Ana Squire if
[25:44] they wouldn't mind come making their way
[25:47] to the podium as we read the scriptures
[25:49] over in Matthew chapter 1 and 18 now the
[25:53] birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise
[25:55] when as his mother Mary was espoused to
[25:58] Joseph before they came together she was
[26:02] found with child of the Holy Ghost
[26:04] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[26:07] not willing to put her to make her a
[26:10] public example was minded to put her
[26:13] away privily but while he thought on
[26:16] these things behold the angel the Lord
[26:18] appeared unto Him in a dream saying
[26:20] Joseph now son of David
[26:23] fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife
[26:25] for that which is conceived in her is of
[26:28] the Holy Ghost and she shall bring for
[26:31] the son now shall call his name Jesus
[26:33] for he shall save his people from their
[26:37] sins
[26:37] now all this was done that it might be
[26:40] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[26:42] by the Prophet saying behold a virgin
[26:45] shall be with child and shall bring
[26:47] forth a son and they shall call his name
[26:50] Emmanuel which being interpreted is God
[26:54] with us then Joseph being raised from
[26:58] sleep did as the angel the Lord had
[27:01] bidden him and took unto him his wife
[27:05] there were not till she had brought
[27:08] forth her firstborn son then he called
[27:12] his name Jesus
[27:16] god bless
[27:18] [Music]
[27:38] Lord if we could we would fill our hands
[27:42] with all of the wonderful things you've
[27:44] gave us and then we would lift them up
[27:47] and give them back to you

[38:22] their flock by dying in love the Angels

[38:29] Lord shone round about them and

[42:03] [Applause]
[42:03] [Music]
[43:42] [Applause]
[44:02] and truly what a glorious night I'm glad
[44:09] we are not in a competition this evening
[44:12] for the young adult choir and the Senior
[44:15] Choir would have some stiff work to
[44:18] compete with the Scriptures say in in
[44:23] Luke chapter 2 and verse 1 and it came
[44:27] to pass in those days that there went
[44:30] out a decree from Caesar Augustus that
[44:33] all the world should be taxed and this
[44:36] taxing was first made when Cyrenius was
[44:39] governor of Syria Syria and all went to
[44:44] be taxed every one into his own City and
[44:48] Joseph also went up from Galilee out of
[44:51] the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the
[44:54] City of David which is called Bethlehem
[44:57] because he was of the house and lineage
[44:59] of David to be taxed with Mary his
[45:03] espoused wife being great with child and
[45:05] so it was that while they were there the
[45:08] days were accomplished that she should
[45:11] be delivered and she brought forth her
[45:14] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[45:16] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[45:19] manger because there was no room for
[45:22] them
[45:24] in the end the taxing of Caesar Augustus
[45:27] was pushing men back into their homeland
[45:31] and because of the taxing it made every
[45:34] hotel room boarding house upper rooms
[45:38] were all filled up and there was no room
[45:40] for our Lord Jesus Christ to be born in
[45:43] the hospital rooms or the decorated
[45:46] rooms of the day only as stable or a
[45:48] manger was available because of the
[45:51] taxing that was going on and I'd say
[45:54] that today in the world that we live in
[45:55] that all the taxing things of Laodicea
[45:59] seem again to make no room for Christ to
[46:01] be born in I wonder tonight if you could
[46:05] speak from your heart and I wonder if
[46:08] there is room for Christ in your life
[46:12] room in your tongue room in your
[46:15] energies room in your family traditions
[46:18] room in your money's room in your house
[46:22] room in your heart or even room in your
[46:25] worship you see it was not the tax that
[46:29] drove Joseph to Bethlehem but it was
[46:31] prophecy that was driving him to
[46:33] Bethlehem we may look at things of the
[46:36] world and think that it's man's doing
[46:38] but all things are working to God for
[46:41] them that love God it will be God's
[46:44] great drawing power that drives you to
[46:47] him it is not a man it is not a bishop
[46:50] it is not a Pope it is not a preacher
[46:52] for no man can come to Christ except God
[46:55] draws him now I want you to notice this
[46:58] that at the birth of a mortal king they
[47:01] are singing and mighty proclaiming that
[47:03] the king has arrived
[47:06] the next leadership is on the scene
[47:09] excitement is in the air if you could
[47:11] picture it
[47:12] maybe the shots of cannons the big guns
[47:15] the long guns are shot fireworks parades
[47:19] because the king is born but at this
[47:22] King's birth there was no people to see
[47:25] there was no persons to sing at the
[47:28] King's birth but God loves singing so
[47:32] much that angels came down and sing to
[47:36] shepherds in the City of David is born
[47:40] Christ the Savior saying glory to God in
[47:43] the highest and on earth peace goodwill
[47:45] towards men you see the first time the
[47:48] Angels ever sang at a celebration was in
[47:51] heaven but the first time they ever sang
[47:54] on earth was to Shepherds at the birth
[47:56] of God emmanuel on earth the first human
[48:00] beings ever heard an angel sing was
[48:03] humble shepherds there was a reason why
[48:06] it had to be shepherds
[48:08] I pray tonight that while these
[48:10] scriptures and these songs are gone over
[48:14] your heart I pray that these scriptures
[48:16] would stir your heart - singing to sing
[48:20] you to stir your heart to joy and myrrh
[48:23] merthin and laughter and may Christ the
[48:26] King be born in your soul and may the
[48:29] angel choir gather around you as the
[48:33] birth of the king of our Lord Jesus
[48:35] Christ is once born again in your heart
[48:39] god bless you so before we sing we
[48:57] actually would like if engineering Katie
[48:59] and jeffanddana could come up here for a
[49:01] second
[49:17] so on behalf of our whole youth choir we
[49:20] wanted to come together and get you guys

[1:08:09] hallelujah to the Lord God Almighty the
[1:08:14] scripture say in Matthew chapter 2 and
[1:08:17] verse 1 as the senior choir comes this
[1:08:21] evening and makes their way to the
[1:08:23] podium the scriptures say now when Jesus
[1:08:27] was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the
[1:08:30] days of Herod the King behold there came
[1:08:35] wise men from the east to Jerusalem
[1:08:37] saying where is he that is born King of
[1:08:41] the Jews we have seen his star in the
[1:08:44] east and are come to worship him and I
[1:08:48] say today that wise men still seek Him
[1:08:53] verse 9
[1:08:55] and when they had heard the King they
[1:08:57] departed and lo the star which they saw
[1:09:00] in the East went before them till it
[1:09:03] came and stood over where the young
[1:09:05] child was when they saw the star they
[1:09:09] rejoiced with exceeding great joy and
[1:09:13] when they were coming to the house they
[1:09:16] saw the young child with Mary his mother
[1:09:19] and fell down and worshiped him and when
[1:09:23] they had opened their treasures they
[1:09:26] presented unto Him gifts gold
[1:09:28] frankincense and myrrh and how fitting
[1:09:33] it is that they would give gold to
[1:09:37] Christ because gold speaks of deity
[1:09:40] frankincense speaks of service and myrrh
[1:09:43] speaks of death it's God's deity in
[1:09:48] service to die and that's what he was
[1:09:50] you see the very thing that they brought
[1:09:53] identified what they thought he was I
[1:09:56] wonder tonight what gift do you bring
[1:09:59] him that identifies who you think he is
[1:10:02] you see it's not riches
[1:10:04] that's riches is not measured out by
[1:10:07] dollars riches is not measured out by
[1:10:10] big names and popularity riches is when
[1:10:13] the kingdom of God is coming to the
[1:10:15] human heart changed his emotions and
[1:10:18] made him a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:10:20] and give him eternal life that's the
[1:10:23] richest thing on earth
[1:10:26] you may ask yourself but what can I give
[1:10:30] these three kings came and they gave
[1:10:33] what they thought he was but what can
[1:10:36] you give I'd like to read you a story
[1:10:39] that I came across here just recently
[1:10:42] there was an elderly lady in 1871 an
[1:10:47] elderly British lady 82 years young was
[1:10:50] ushered into her heavenly reward earlier
[1:10:53] in her life in 1835 her frustration at
[1:10:58] bein anvil and invalid left her fillings
[1:11:01] useless and questioning her very
[1:11:05] salvation what she did next would echo
[1:11:09] through history as a young woman
[1:11:12] Charlotte Elliott was not sure of her
[1:11:14] relationship with Christ not sure of how
[1:11:17] to be saved even though she had been
[1:11:19] raised a minister's daughter and the
[1:11:22] probing question of a Swiss evangelist
[1:11:25] are you at peace with God would not
[1:11:29] leave her mind when she saw the
[1:11:31] Evangelist a few weeks later she
[1:11:33] mentioned that she could not shake his
[1:11:35] question but she protested what could
[1:11:40] she possibly bring to God
[1:11:42] when he replied that she need not bring
[1:11:45] anything but herself she gladly accepted
[1:11:49] Christ some 12 years later in 1835
[1:11:53] crippled by illness and constant fatigue
[1:11:56] she felt saddened by her inability to
[1:11:59] help a local church his cause
[1:12:02] remembering her conversion she took out
[1:12:05] pen and paper and wrote a poem to
[1:12:07] encourage others who felt perhaps they
[1:12:10] too had nothing to give just as I am
[1:12:15] without one plea but that thy blood was
[1:12:19] shed for me and that thou biddest me
[1:12:23] come to the old Lamb of God I come her
[1:12:28] poem was published and she was inundated
[1:12:31] with requests for it she was gladden to
[1:12:34] discover later that some copies were
[1:12:37] being sold to raise money for the very
[1:12:38] cause she felt helpless to assist in
[1:12:42] after her death thousands of letters
[1:12:45] were found in her home written by people
[1:12:47] whose lives have been transformed by her
[1:12:50] words her song has been translated into
[1:12:53] a hundred and hundreds of languages
[1:12:56] published in more than 1600 hymnals and
[1:13:00] has reached billions around the world
[1:13:02] and continues to bring people to Christ
[1:13:05] even today 60 years later on this date
[1:13:10] in 1931 a 31 year old man riding in a
[1:13:15] sidecar of his brothers motorcycle in
[1:13:17] England
[1:13:18] finally came to the end of his internal
[1:13:22] struggle against whether Christ was
[1:13:24] indeed the Son of God he finally knew in
[1:13:27] his soul that indeed Jesus was just who
[1:13:30] he said he was he realized that God
[1:13:33] calls us to him just as we are
[1:13:37] and when CS Lewis stepped out of the
[1:13:40] sidecar he was a new man saved by grace
[1:13:44] 99 years after solid Elliot penned her
[1:13:47] words and three years after Lewis
[1:13:50] conversion the sixteen-year-old son of a
[1:13:53] dairy farmer listened intently as he
[1:13:55] heard the message of salvation preached
[1:13:57] at a revival service in Charlotte North
[1:14:00] Carolina when the song just as I am was
[1:14:03] sung at the end young Billy Graham went
[1:14:06] forward to accept Christ
[1:14:08] 20 years later Billy Graham had become a
[1:14:11] successful evangelist and was invited to
[1:14:14] speak at Cambridge University in England
[1:14:16] his nervousness over the event nearly
[1:14:20] led him to cancel it but he was
[1:14:22] introduced to a con man named CS Lewis
[1:14:25] who encouraged him to disregard the
[1:14:28] critics who had spoken out against him
[1:14:31] and to continue with the revival
[1:14:34] Reverend Graham went on to speak to an
[1:14:37] overflow crowd of 2,000 each night of
[1:14:39] the revival and when he returned to
[1:14:41] England in 1989 he addressed a crowd of
[1:14:45] 80,000 at England's Wembley Stadium as
[1:14:48] always he closed the event with the song
[1:14:51] that brought him to Christ just as I am
[1:14:55] never think you have nothing to bring to
[1:14:59] Jesus that is exactly what he wants you
[1:15:03] to bring is nothing he wants you just
[1:15:08] you as you are
[1:15:10] he can take frustration like Charlotte
[1:15:13] Elliot's skepticism like Louis's and
[1:15:16] nervousness like Billy Graham's and
[1:15:18] reach the world through you just as I am
[1:15:21] though tossed about with many a conflict
[1:15:25] and many adapt
[1:15:27] Fighting's and fears within without Oh
[1:15:29] Lamb of God I come I come
[1:15:34] again I ask you what gift can you bring
[1:15:39] may God richly bless you and we wish you
[1:15:42] a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

[1:47:30] in humility in Philippians two and verse
[1:47:33] seven said he made himself of no
[1:47:35] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:47:38] a servant and was made like 'no son to
[1:47:40] men and being found in the fashion as a
[1:47:43] man he humbled himself and and became
[1:47:45] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:47:49] the cross
[1:47:50] wherefore God hath also highly exalted
[1:47:54] him and giving them a name which is
[1:47:57] above every name that at the name of
[1:48:00] Jesus every knee shall bow of things in
[1:48:04] heaven and things in earth and things
[1:48:05] under the earth that every tongue should
[1:48:08] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[1:48:13] glory of God and the father
[1:48:21] he is incomparable in his love
[1:48:25] Ephesians 2:5 in verse two says and walk
[1:48:30] in love as Christ also hath loved us and
[1:48:35] hath given himself for us an offering
[1:48:40] and a sacrifice to God for a
[1:48:44] sweet-smelling Savior he is incomparable
[1:48:48] of grace called second Corinthians verse
[1:48:53] 8 chapter and verse 9 says for we know
[1:48:57] that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:01] that through that though he was rich yet
[1:49:05] for your sakes he became poor that he
[1:49:09] might through his poverty become rich he
[1:49:16] was incomparable in his sacrifice mark
[1:49:22] chapter 10 and verse 45 for even the Son
[1:49:26] of man came not to be ministered unto
[1:49:28] but to minister and to give his life a
[1:49:34] ransom for minute he was incomparable in
[1:49:40] his power he would say all power is
[1:49:44] given to me in heaven and in earth GoGet
[1:49:49] therefore and teach all nations
[1:49:50] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[1:49:52] and of the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:49:54] teaching them to observe all things
[1:49:57] whatsoever I commanded you and lo I am
[1:50:01] with you always even at the end of the
[1:50:04] world
[1:50:07] he was incomparable in his salvation he
[1:50:12] said I am the resurrection no man had
[1:50:15] ever been able to say this no man since
[1:50:18] Adam because Adam fell though great in
[1:50:22] their significance of all prophets of
[1:50:25] men that could shake heavens and shake
[1:50:30] the kingdom of hell none of them can say
[1:50:32] I am the resurrection and I am the life
[1:50:38] none of them could say destroy this body
[1:50:41] and in three days I'll raise it up again
[1:50:45] without Jesus coming to the earth
[1:50:47] tonight we're lost
[1:51:02] there's been great men princess
[1:51:05] presidents ambassadors dictators great
[1:51:10] Kings have been on the earth but none
[1:51:14] none could speak alot into existence
[1:51:18] that would feed 5000 none could die for
[1:51:23] their own sins but this king but this
[1:51:30] king was God himself born in a manger
[1:51:44] and thankful tonight that this king
[1:51:49] would love us so much men today scarcely
[1:51:56] would die for one another but this King
[1:52:01] died for people that was spitting on him
[1:52:03] mocking him making fun of him writing
[1:52:07] blogs about him writing all different
[1:52:11] kinds of nonsense about they he not in
[1:52:13] spite of all of them
[1:52:14] [Applause]
[1:52:21] the scripture says Mary pondered what
[1:52:25] she was witnessing angels singing the
[1:52:28] First Noel Shepherds coming from the
[1:52:32] field to worship Him Kings would come
[1:52:37] two years later to give him incredible
[1:52:40] gifts stars would line up the night that
[1:52:47] he was born
[1:53:04] this girl would have a testimony that
[1:53:06] she met an angel yet all of her life
[1:53:12] they would make fun of her you see today
[1:53:17] they worship her
[1:53:18] but when Mary was on earth the rumors
[1:53:21] were that she had a baby by by a soldier
[1:53:26] that she was their mother of an
[1:53:29] illegitimate child she had her critics
[1:53:38] she met a man about six foot tall dark
[1:53:42] complected and he was sent from the
[1:53:46] presence of the Lord and told her that
[1:53:50] she was to be the mother of Jesus Christ
[1:53:56] God would need to borrow her womb to be
[1:54:00] born in Joseph would protect him no
[1:54:13] hospitals no Kings chambers for this
[1:54:18] child to be born brother Nathaniel God
[1:54:25] chose a manger he chose a place where
[1:54:35] stunk because that's what our sins did I
[1:54:47] was not him lost without him this world
[1:55:00] has fallen apart this world is
[1:55:05] contaminated and polluted with politics
[1:55:08] and media world wars are are prepping
[1:55:16] systems are falling apart everything is
[1:55:21] coming to its end but this baby was
[1:55:24] going to be born to take care of us
[1:55:29] you see without him brother Charles
[1:55:32] we're in trouble
[1:55:35] without him taking us by the hand Mary
[1:55:38] would reach in grab his little hands and
[1:55:41] little bitty hands these hands would
[1:55:44] change the world these eyes that she
[1:55:48] would look down into they would change
[1:55:50] the world God needed to look through a
[1:55:55] Charles eyes God needed to be a teenager
[1:55:59] God needed to be a young preacher
[1:56:12] without him tonight I'm lost
[1:56:18] Christmas is more than a day to where we
[1:56:21] look back to a manger Christmas is a day
[1:56:27] to where we ask the Lord to be in us
[1:56:33] more than ever before
[1:56:38] whether it's lights on a house or tree
[1:56:42] in your living room presents given
[1:56:46] backwards and forwards of love to one
[1:56:49] another but the barrier I was going into
[1:56:52] Barry to to buy my wife's last Christmas
[1:56:57] present the other day and I didn't walk
[1:57:02] in and just ask for something that would
[1:57:04] be just a trinket that could get it
[1:57:06] through I wanted their best because she
[1:57:10] deserved the best
[1:57:14] now if I would do that for my wife
[1:57:18] how much more for God he don't require
[1:57:24] my money
[1:57:25] he don't require my house he don't want
[1:57:30] a choir land so matter of fact when the
[1:57:33] rapture happens this building will still
[1:57:36] beat you but what he asked for is the
[1:57:41] greatest thing that I could give him
[1:57:43] that's my life I know what he's
[1:57:53] remembered for what will you be remember
[1:57:58] for it's quite a statement you shall
[1:58:12] find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:58:13] clothes and lying in a manger verse 19
[1:58:20] of chapter 2 of Luke said and Mary kept
[1:58:23] all these things and pondered them in
[1:58:25] their heart and the Shepherd's returned
[1:58:28] glorifying and praising God for all the
[1:58:31] things that they had heard and seen as
[1:58:35] it was told unto them a supernatural God
[1:58:43] became man
[1:58:50] where would we have been standing 2,000
[1:58:54] years ago where would we have been
[1:59:02] standing I'll tell you what we're stand
[1:59:07] our stand today will tell you what you
[1:59:10] two did there our stand today would have
[1:59:16] told you what you two did on the days of
[1:59:18] Noah
[1:59:19] it will told you where you're standing
[1:59:21] at whether you'd have been in the boat
[1:59:24] or standing outside criticizing mother
[1:59:29] on if I was if I was with Jesus
[1:59:32] I'd have been walking right with him
[1:59:34] what you're doing today will tell you
[1:59:38] what you would have been doing then I
[1:59:46] choose to spend my time for God that's

[2:01:20] for a photograph a picture that's by
[2:01:23] Abraham hunter he's especially a young
[2:01:29] man he's a quite an incredible painter
[2:01:35] and I've looked for two years for this
[2:01:37] this picture seema Bleen ever available
[2:01:43] to me to be able to buy it just to give
[2:01:51] you an idea it's quite a rare piece
[2:01:56] actually I took brother Tim Pruitt and
[2:01:58] brother Donnie Reagan with me and we
[2:02:00] were we were looking to buy it
[2:02:02] and it wasn't there it was not available
[2:02:06] I've got a knock on my door this
[2:02:08] afternoon and brother Jeff and sister
[2:02:12] Anna walked to my door and handed me a
[2:02:15] gift and then wanted me to open it up
[2:02:19] and when I opened it up there was Jesus
[2:02:23] on the see my heart just about exploded
[2:02:29] for that which I had looked for for two
[2:02:32] years and was willing to give great
[2:02:33] money for was now a gift to me it didn't
[2:02:41] about money whether you would give me a
[2:02:46] piece of bubblegum or a great art piece
[2:02:55] that piece meant a great deal to me
[2:02:57] today and meant a great deal to me I
[2:03:02] chased that piece and now that piece
[2:03:05] found me and I thought about Jesus came
[2:03:12] walking on the water and you see that
[2:03:14] piece meant a whole lot to me
[2:03:19] cuz he's come walking through some of my
[2:03:21] troubles in my life when I laid in a
[2:03:26] coma and they thought I was gonna die
[2:03:29] and there's gonna take my organs out of
[2:03:30] my body and harvest him and give him I
[2:03:34] needed Jesus on the water
[2:03:37] you see that's more than just artwork to
[2:03:40] me I needed Jesus on the water and you
[2:03:45] see that Jesus on the water
[2:03:47] reminds me that he was there for me when
[2:03:51] I was homeless and a drug addict and I
[2:03:55] needed that Jesus I'd like to remind you
[2:04:00] this is more than a job to me this is
