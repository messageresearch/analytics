[Music] I just want to say from last night that when he first started talking about hunting, I took the kids for their first time hunting yesterday morning. It was raining. It was dark and the kids were a little scared when we went out in the woods the first time. But I told him, you know, the sun's going to come up soon. And last night he talked about that. It may be dark, but we got a light. It's going to come up soon. Let's all pray for these requests. Lord Jesus, we come before you today, Lord, as your chosen people. Lord, you chose us before the foundation of the world. We didn't have any say in it, Lord. We didn't have any choice. You chose us, and we're just so thankful for it today. Lord, you gave us the opportunity to be able to speak to you whenever we need to, Lord. Whenever we have something upon our heart, whenever something is going on with a brother or sister, we can come before your throne and we can say, "Lord, we need you on the scene right now." And we have these prayer requests, Lord. Lord, battling cancers throughout the message. Satan is just he's losing, Lord. He knows he's losing. And all he can do is throw darts at us, but those darts cannot do anything to us because of you. And we just thank you, Lord, that you can come down here. You can touch each and every person, Lord, that is battling in their body, in their mind, in their soul. Lord, whatever it may be, you are our high priest. And we just thank you for it. Lord, I just pray that you are going to be up there at that service today for brother Eddie. Lord, may this be an opportunity for the bride to see your power, Lord, to know, Lord, that no matter what happens on this earth, that we have an eternal reward that we're going to. And we're just so thankful for you, Lord, for what you do for us each and every day. I ask, Lord, that you be with this service. Lord, be with Brother Matt as he brings us what you've laid upon his heart. Lord, I just believe that you have something special in store for each and every one of us. I just believe that you have something that you're going to say to our hearts today that's going to make us that much ready for your rapture.

Don't forget that we've got all things possible. Doesn't matter if it's broken or just ashes. There's hope. You're right in the middle of a miracle. Before prison chains ever broke, there was a captive. Before 5,000 were fed, there was just one basket. If there was ever going to be light, there had to be darkness before there was ever an empty tomb. There was a cross. You don't see it. But you right in the middle of a miracle. You can't be under your feet. New roots are taken home. Don't forget that with God all things are possible. Doesn't matter if it's broken or just ashes. There's hope. You're right in the middle of a miracle. You have a future cuz he has a plan. I promise he's got you. You're still in his hands. You have a future cuz he has a plan. I promise he's got you. You're still in his hand. You don't see it, but you're right in the middle of a miracle. You can't feel it, but under your feet, new roots are taken home. Don't forget that with God, all things are possible. Doesn't matter if it's broken or just flashes. There's hope. You're right in the middle of a miracle. [Music] [Applause] Give myself away.

I give myself to you. &gt;&gt; I give myself away. &gt;&gt; We'll just surrender it all to him this morning. &gt;&gt; I give myself away so you can hear. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads this morning in the presence of the Lord. Our dear most heavenly father, Lord, Lord, this is our desire that we could just give ourselves away to you fully this morning. God, as I am just a man, my nerves here this morning, but God, I want to surrender my vessel all to you, Lord. I ask you that you just use me this morning that speak a word to these people. God, we thank you for what you're doing for the bride around the world, Lord. And we're awaiting your appearing, Lord, calling us away now. Oh God, I ask you that you'll just bless us this morning and keep us bless the reading of the word in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful service last night and thank you for all being so attentive and being so kind to me. I certainly appreciate preaching to our home crowd here. &gt;&gt; I certainly love y'all. And uh so uh this morning I'd like to uh take a word that uh I'd like to speak with us and I'd like to title this this morning. How heavy was Joseph coat? &gt;&gt; And I'd like to begin in uh 2 Corinthians 11 and verse 1 this morning. So if you'd like to turn there in your scriptures, 2 Corinthians 11 and verse one. We want to continue to pray for our pastor, brother Ron, that God would just strengthen him there in Canada and brother Ed's service this morning that God would just minister to Cloverdale Bible Way in a supernatural way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 11 and verse one it says, "Would to God ye bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me? For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I have espoused you to one husband that ye may present that I may present you as a chasteed virgin to Christ." Yes. &gt;&gt; And then I'd like to turn in our scriptures to Genesis 37 and 2, if they'd like to put that on the board there. It says, "And these are the generations of Jacob, Joseph, being 17 years old, was feeding the flock of his brethren. And the lad was with the sons of Bilha and the sons of Zippa, his father's wives. And Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all of his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he had made him a coat of many colors. And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all of his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peaceibly unto him. Amen. You may have your seats. This morning, as I said, I'd like to speak this morning on how heavy was Joseph's coat. &gt;&gt; Now, this morning, I have with me a uh pretty heavy coat. This is a Woolrich coat my wife got for me many many years ago. And this is a if you was to weigh it, it's very heavy. I would say right around 7 8 pounds of how heavy this coat is. And I've layered it this morning with many, many colors to represent a coat of many colors. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows the story of Joseph in the coat of many colors? &gt;&gt; I would hope we we all kind of do this morning or else you're thinking Matt's robbed a marachchi band. So this is a coat of many colors to represent what Joseph carried. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, this is a natural coat, but I want to use it in a spiritual sense of of how heavy of the burden that Joseph carried. &gt;&gt; How heavy of the burden that Jacob, Israel carried &gt;&gt; and the burden that his brothers carried. So the story of Joseph would begin with him proceeding to go meet his brethren to help with the sheep. And as they would see him coming a far off, they would talk amongst themselves. They were envious of how that their father loved Jacob. &gt;&gt; And J and excuse me, Joseph would say and he would tell and dream dreams. It says in 37 and:e 2 it says these are the generation I'm sorry not that one verse 5 it said and Joseph dreamed a dream and has told his brethren and they hated him yet the more &gt;&gt; and he said unto him here I pray ye this dream which I have dreamed for behold we were binding the sheav in the field and lo many she arose and stood upright and behold your sheav stood round about and made obedience to my sheep chief. And his brethren said unto him, "Shalt thou indeed reign over us, or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?" And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words. And he dreamed yet another dream. And he told his brethren, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed a dream more, and behold, the sun and the moon, and the 11 stars made obedience unto me." And he told it to his father, and to his brethren, and his father, Jacob, even rebuked him, and said unto him, "What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shalt thy and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down thouel ourselves to thee to the earth. So he was a dreamer. &gt;&gt; He was a seer. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He would see &gt;&gt; things in the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they hated him for these things. They hated him for he was telling them that thou would be obedience unto me. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But he was the younger one. He was be about 17 years old when he would go to feed his father's flock. But his brethrens hated the dreams. And the same thing is in today, people hate the spiritual. &gt;&gt; People hate the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say in Joseph meeting his brother said, "When John came, he was supernatural. When Jesus came, it was supernatural." And the enemy on the fundamental side always persecuted the supernatural. &gt;&gt; The same thing that Joseph's brethrens did to Joseph. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; They'll do to you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; In this day, they'll do the same thing because they hate that supernatural seed to come forth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But Joseph carried this burden of these dreams. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Carried the burden that his father is now even rebuking him. He's favored by his father, but he's rebuked. &gt;&gt; So, as they see him coming a far off, they scheme amongst themselves. &gt;&gt; They begin to talk amongst themselves. Let's take and kill him. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Because of the supernatural, they was willing to kill their brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One said to the other, "No, let's not do that. Let us take and let's put him in this pit. Let's put him in this ditch." So, they would do that. They would take him. They would put him in the pit. And Reuben, the older brother, would go far off and and then his other brother in Judah would come and say, "Here comes a tribe of people. Let's take him. Let's sell him to them. That way his blood is not on our hands." &gt;&gt; So they would pull him up out of that pit. And I could just imagine Joseph in that pit bearing the burden. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Those dreams that he had had, &gt;&gt; right? the burden that he had seen. &gt;&gt; There was no glory in that pit. &gt;&gt; There was darkness in that pit. &gt;&gt; As I was speaking last night, that darkness seemed to press that light. &gt;&gt; But that light &gt;&gt; pushed past that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even in the pit, &gt;&gt; Joseph stayed steadfast to what the Lord had promised unto him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And so when his brethren would pull him up out of that pit and they would sell him to them, he would be sold to Piper's house to be there to to help in Piper's house. And in Piper's house, he would then be accused, falsely accused by Piper's wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in this time, Joseph's brethren has schemed to put blood on the coat. That's &gt;&gt; right. to tell their father that a big animal uh something must have devoured him in the field. Must have killed him while he was on earth on his way to to meet us, Dad. And all we have found is this coat. I &gt;&gt; Isn't Isn't this the coat that you gave him, Dad? &gt;&gt; And he would pick it up. He would say, "This is the coat. This is what I had given him in love. Bloody. That blood was not meant to be there. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That was not one of the purposed colors that was supposed to be on this coat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he mourned and mourned many, many days. &gt;&gt; And his family would comfort him. and his brothers would probably, excuse me, his sons would probably look at it and go, "Well, now we don't have to fool with that dreamer." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now we have that coat. We can show that he died. He'll never be remembered again. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And there's Jacob holding that coat. The burden of holding his son's coat that he thought was murdered. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say it in Blind Barnameus. Could you imagine Jacob holding Joseph's coat for 40 years, &gt;&gt; bloody, thinking an animal had killed him? How heavy was that coat that he would carry for 40 years? I would say the first year that his brethren would watch their father carry that coat, it didn't bother them. They could remember what they did. But he would carry that coat that he had promised his son from Rachel, holding it bloody. Year two comes and he's still carrying that coat. I would say that it be to be a little heavier on the brother's minds. &gt;&gt; I would say that the torment that they had did to Joseph now was doing in their own mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what jealousy will drive you to. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; The burden of other people, what you would like to have over them. what jealousy will do to your mind. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; It'll drive you insane. &gt;&gt; Envy of wanting something else of someone else's. &gt;&gt; Year three came and he is still carrying that coat. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He's still remembering Joseph over them. Year five, year six, and he's still holding that heavy coat. No, it wasn't heavy as far maybe the the weight of it, but the burden of it &gt;&gt; that he's carrying. See, many people want Jacob's palace, &gt;&gt; but they don't remember him in the pit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They didn't see him in the pit. &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't see all that his brothers had did to him, all that they had said to him. &gt;&gt; But it was for purpose. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was for a purpose that Joseph would be thrown into the pit. &gt;&gt; Maybe God would look down and say, "He still trust me." &gt;&gt; Because even in Piper's house, says the Lord blessed him. &gt;&gt; The Lord looked up on him. The Lord was with him. &gt;&gt; Even in Piper's house &gt;&gt; to make him ruler over everything in Piper's house, he was still with him. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'd like to read this. Sister Katie had sent this in our family text a couple weeks ago. had had no idea what I was studying on. But it says Joseph's dungeon was the very road to his throne. And he would have been unable to lift the iron load of his brothers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Had he not experienced the iron in his own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your life will be enlarged in proportion to the amount of iron you have endured. For it is in the shadows of your life that you will find the actual fulfillment of your dreams of glory. So don't complain about the shadows of darkness cuz in reality they are better than your dreams could ever be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Joseph's dreams in that pit in Piper's house. He wasn't a free man. He was still a slave. &gt;&gt; He was falsely accused now thrown into prison because being falsely accused &gt;&gt; and almost to be forgotten. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But see what he went through was putting him towards his destiny. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And many times in our life we feel the burden that we have sometimes is almost unbearable. But as Joseph, the iron load that he was carrying was meant for him. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was built for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many times, even in our own human nature, we would want what other people have. Maybe you would want a a house, a car, something somebody else has. &gt;&gt; You're jealous over them. &gt;&gt; Why do they have it? Why can't I have something like that? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not a house or a car. Maybe it's a boat. Maybe it's grass. Maybe your lawn is not as green as their lawn. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You're envious. Why can't I get my grass as green as they can? I'm going to find you this morning. &gt;&gt; Glory. Why can't my children act like their children now? Come on. &gt;&gt; Why can't I sing as good as they can sing? &gt;&gt; Why can't I preach as good as they can preach? &gt;&gt; Why can't I have a church like they have a church? &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. Good. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. His brethren hated the fact that he was loved. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know the burden that he carried for them. &gt;&gt; See your blessings in your life, you're carrying those things. And I would say that many of us, even though we have a nice home, a nice car, nice clothes, wonderful children, there is times that we feel that we're not worthy of these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy of this. And there's times that you even suppress what God has given you &gt;&gt; because you don't want other people to think &gt;&gt; of how vain you may be. You say, "Well, these are vain things." No. &gt;&gt; If God has blessed you. &gt;&gt; Don't live below what God has blessed you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; He has called you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He has chosen you. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about natural things now. I'm talking about spiritual things now. God has given you something on the inside of you. Don't live below your standards. &gt;&gt; Good. God gave you a word. Don't live below them. &gt;&gt; Come on, man. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The burdens you feel for your family that maybe aren't walking in this light, aren't holding this message, don't live below your standards because they're not &gt;&gt; living those standards. Good preaching. &gt;&gt; Don't bow down to darkness. Don't bow down to sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord will be with you as he was with with Joseph. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll be with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that burden of that coat that's meant for you. And God will help you hold that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's the other people that will say things, people that would maybe do things against you, maybe they would even murder you. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; In their sayings. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's a burden to their minds. &gt;&gt; I'm sure that there is even church members or people that would come against you and say things against to other church members &gt;&gt; and cause a negative a thought. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; In their mind. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now that burden is upon them for what they've said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What they have done &gt;&gt; you live your life &gt;&gt; according to this gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; According to this word, &gt;&gt; let them say on. &gt;&gt; This is not the first time of jealousy in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Let's just take it back to where jealousy began. That's &gt;&gt; right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Lucifer said, &gt;&gt; "I will make myself like God." &gt;&gt; He thought that he could do a better job. That's &gt;&gt; right. Come on. I will make myself ahead of it. And he would deceive onethird of the angels, cause them to fall. And he would take and he would enter a man, a serpent. Now, that jealousy wouldn't just sit there in that serpent. &gt;&gt; It would go on to its seed. Come on now. Let's turn to Genesis. Genesis 4, I believe it is. Sorry, I thought I had it here in my notes. I do have it. It's just at the wrong place. Genesis 4 and1 it says Adam knew his his wife knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep. But Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel. He also brought the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. And unto Cain, and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was wroth and his countenance fell. Two altars, two unto the Lord. Cain brought a beautiful offering. So beautiful of the ground of what God had made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But here come Abel dragging his little lamb. That's &gt;&gt; right. And I'm sure Cain thought, "What is he doing?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What is he doing? And as he would bring that little lamb, &gt;&gt; and he would put it up on that altar &gt;&gt; and he would take a sharp stone and he would begin to beat that lamb, that beautiful lamb without spot, without blemish. &gt;&gt; Said, "I want the best for the Lord." That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; This altar that I have built for God, I want the best. &gt;&gt; Cain's now looking at Abel. That blood flowing all over Abel and God's accepting it. &gt;&gt; God's accepting his sacrifice. &gt;&gt; But he rejected Cain's. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And he was wroth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See there? Jealousy. &gt;&gt; That's right. jealousy once again. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But the Lord told Cain said, "If you will do like your brother, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; I will have recompense unto you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I will accept your offering. Just do do like Abel. He could not handle it. &gt;&gt; He could not accept it. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; What was it? Abel had received revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we was talking last night, revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to turn there again this morning. I want to read that where I had ended last night and said, "How did Abel know what to do in order to offer a per a preferred sacrifice to God?" By faith. He received the revelation &gt;&gt; of the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cain didn't get such a revelation. He did not get such a revelation. It was the revelation of God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life. Now, you might take what the pastor says or the seminary teaches and thought and taught and might thought and might taught you to do eloquently. But until God reveals to you Jesus is the Christ, &gt;&gt; that is the blood that cleanses your sins and that God is your savior, you will never have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just as Joseph had received supernatural gifts, spiritual revelation, it was a spiritual revelation unto Abel &gt;&gt; of blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. that God wanted blood on the altar. God accepted blood, but it got him killed. Perfect type of Jesus and Judas, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Judas wanted a beautiful worship, &gt;&gt; wanted a beautiful seminary, maybe wanted to build tles and things unto Jesus. But Jesus said, "No, I want blood on the altar. &gt;&gt; It's going to take my blood." &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's maybe just a family thing that uh maybe just happened two or three times." You're right. David, &gt;&gt; David would be anointed above all his brothers, &gt;&gt; right? Because Saul had not done what the Lord had asked him to do. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was hated of this. Said in 1st Samuel 16 and six and said, "And it came to pass when they were come that he looked to El and said, surely the Lord has anointed. Surely the Lord's anointed is before him. See, he was even looking at the outward appearance &gt;&gt; of David's older brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was probably bigger, better looking, better with a sword, more elegant, could probably have preached a better sermon than I'm preaching this morning. But you see, he was not accepted. &gt;&gt; That's right. But see, he looked on stature. Samuel looked on stature and accountants and but the Lord refused him. &gt;&gt; And the Lord seeth, say, not as man seeth. For man lookth on the outward appearance, but the Lord look upon the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then Jesse called Benahab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, "Neither hath the Lord chosen this." And then Jesse made Shemath, and forgive me on pronouncing these words, I'm sorry, to pass. And he said, "Neither hath Lord chosen this." And again, Jesse made his seven made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Sam Samuel said unto Jesse, "The Lord hath not chosen these." And Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all thy children?" And he said, "There remainth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep." See, he had forgot about David. &gt;&gt; Come on. Right. &gt;&gt; When Samuel asked to bring off his children, he had forgot about David. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And said, "Oh, he's keeping the sheep." And said, "And he said, and Samuel said to Jesse, sendeth and fetch him, for we will not sit down till he come hither." And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ready with all of a beauty with all of a beauty count beautiful countenance and godly to look on to look to. And the Lord said, "Arise, anoint him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this is he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Samuel took the horn of the oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't do it only. He let his brothers see it. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the spirit of the Lord came upon David. And from that day forth, Samuel rose up and went to Rama. &gt;&gt; He was accepted in front of his brethren. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And his brethren hated him for it. &gt;&gt; His brethren hated that David was accepted. He was the youngest. He was on the backside taking care of just some sheep. That's &gt;&gt; right. They hated him. He was They was jealous over him. That's right. &gt;&gt; It was a burden that they would carry. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm still talking about how heavy the coat was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not just Joseph's. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's every single one of ours. &gt;&gt; They hated him. &gt;&gt; How do you know they hated him? Well, David went down because his father had sent him to the battle. &gt;&gt; And there was all of his brothers against the Philistines. And there was a man named Goliath that come out and would challenge. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God of Israel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And there's David hearing Goliath make his threats. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. Now, his brothers had heard the threats over and over and over again, but they did nothing about it. &gt;&gt; They had the opportunity. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Just as Cain could have accepted &gt;&gt; and have made the altar &gt;&gt; here is his brethrens having the chance &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; to face Goliath. &gt;&gt; That's right. having the chance to take the same word of God &gt;&gt; and kill this uncircumcised Philistines that was making threats unto the people of Israel. &gt;&gt; And he says, "What is this that y'all would let him make these cries?" That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And his oldest brother then turns to him and says, "Why are you even here?" That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You have come down just to see the battle. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Why are you even here? make fun of him. Here's David quoting the scriptures and his brethren is hating him for it. &gt;&gt; Making fun of him. And he would say, David would turn to him and said, "What have now I done?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What did I do to you? &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; My father sent me. That's &gt;&gt; right. I've just come down here and you're doing nothing about this. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What have I done to you? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jealousy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Was eating away at the oldest brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he was anointed. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; He was anointed above all of them. &gt;&gt; He didn't do nothing to his brother then. He didn't come down and make fun of him doing &gt;&gt; but he was hated &gt;&gt; because he was anointed. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Amen. And he was carrying that burden &gt;&gt; of that anointing, &gt;&gt; seeing that supernatural come upon him. &gt;&gt; And he hated him for it. &gt;&gt; But David did as what the Lord wanted to him to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't just sit there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He did something about it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he went and killed Goliath. &gt;&gt; That's right. See, he was the king, he was anointed the king, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God was with him. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Even as with Abel, even as with Joseph, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God was with him. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Even in prison, &gt;&gt; there's Joseph and here's the butler and here's the baker. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that gift that God had given him, it never left him. That's right. &gt;&gt; It had never left him even in prison. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The burden that he was carrying was still with him. And there he was. And they said, "I've dreamed a dream." The butler had dreamed a dream. And he said, "I've dreamed that that I would have the have the chance to give the Pharaoh's cup to him again." And Joseph would interpret that dream and say that you would become his wine bearer once again. And here's the baker. He said, "Wow, well that's that's pretty good. I'm I'll tell you what. I'm going to tell him my dream, too." &gt;&gt; But it didn't turn out the same way for his dream. Because in his dream, the crows would come and eat the bread off of his head. And when Joseph would go to interpret the dream of the baker, it wasn't a prosperous dream. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a dream that would maybe make him famous. &gt;&gt; It was a dream that would make him make him hate it once again. &gt;&gt; There's that burden again. Hate it from the baker. The butler loved him, &gt;&gt; but what he had spoken come to pass. That's right. &gt;&gt; But he was forgotten once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once again, there he was in the prison of Piper's house. There he was carrying the burden of what God had given him. There he was thinking that it's all gone. And God would cause a dream to come upon Pharaoh. And the butler would remember there's a man that can interpret. &gt;&gt; When all these wise men can't, there's a man that can interpret the dreams. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And there he would come and say, "Joseph, come tell me of these things. Tell me of these dreams. Tell me of all these things." And he would tell them the exact truths. There was no one in the home that could do that. No one in all the lands that could have done that. And there he is now. He's lifted up to Pharaoh's right hand. He's given power from Pharaoh. He's given him everything. And he tells him of all the dreams and he interprets all the dreams and gives seven years of plenty. Then there'll be seven years of famine. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And all the while, while Joseph is being now beginning to be lifted up, there's his brethren. There is his brethren on the back side of the deserts. &gt;&gt; Still watching Jacob carry that coat, &gt;&gt; carry that. And I would say by this time in life, the burden that he had carried was now so much that they they just couldn't hardly stand it. I love in the scriptures how in the very midst of this whole story, Judah and Tamar's story is told. Right in the middle of Joseph's story of being told, Judah's story &gt;&gt; gets told, &gt;&gt; right? Judah leaves his brother. &gt;&gt; I would say it almost became too much for him to bear. &gt;&gt; I would say that when he was watching his father carrying that coat, he said it's just too much. &gt;&gt; So he went down to the Canaanites and he took a wife, a gentile bride. &gt;&gt; And there Judah was and he raised sons, sons of these wives. That's &gt;&gt; right. But all of the sons were evil in God's sight. And so he would kill them. In the midst of Judah ex trying to explain this in his mind of what he had done to Joseph, God is still going to use him. That's right. &gt;&gt; God is still going to use Judah. He's now taken his sons. And I'm sure that's on his mind of what he did to Joseph. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's now not able to have Tamar to have the lineage carry on. But now Tamar does something unexpected. &gt;&gt; She plays the part of the harlot. &gt;&gt; To receive the seed of Judah &gt;&gt; to continue that line. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she kept a promise of a staff and of his bracelet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when it come time that she was with child, they thought that she had been a harlot. &gt;&gt; She's played the harlot. &gt;&gt; And here she comes with this and says, "This is the man's &gt;&gt; to whose child this is." And Judah says, "You are more righteous than I." Amen. &gt;&gt; In the midst of all of the hatred that he had had for Joseph, &gt;&gt; in the midst of all that he had had seen of his family &gt;&gt; dying. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Think I would say that he probably thought my family's now cursed because of what we did. I have no clue where Joseph is at. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; If I could redo the story, I'd redo it. &gt;&gt; I'm sure that burden was almost so much to bear. and now his own daughter-in-law is more righteous than he is. &gt;&gt; I love how how that is placed smack there in the middle of Joseph's story. &gt;&gt; Why? Because out of his lineage, out of his lineage would come Christ. &gt;&gt; Out of his lineage would come David, &gt;&gt; lion of the tribe of Judah. out of that out of that dark story, out of that burden that he was carrying now, &gt;&gt; God would still use him. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you this morning, I don't care where you've been, &gt;&gt; what you've done, &gt;&gt; the Lord is still able to use you this morning. &gt;&gt; He's still able to raise seed. In the midst of all your trials, &gt;&gt; God can still make a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When there seems no other way in the world. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When there seems like it's just totally impossible, God made a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God made a way. Through all that that burden had been bared, &gt;&gt; he made a way. That's right. &gt;&gt; And now we see that the famine in the land has come across all of them. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Has come across all of every single one of them. But there was one in the land that had bread in his father's house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was one that was now the bread of life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There was one that was lifted up. &gt;&gt; Come on. and his brethren had to go to him. &gt;&gt; The only place. That's right. The only place they could turn to was Joseph. &gt;&gt; But they had no clue it was him. &gt;&gt; Had no idea that now their brother is lifted up. And those dreams that he had dreamed are now getting ready to come to pass. there. They had to come before him. Didn't recognize him. Didn't know him. He's in the palace. He's there set up. And he would begin to ask them of his father. He would begin to ask them of all the brethren. He was happy to see all of them. I wonder if we could say that. Come on. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could say that. If people would murder us with jealousy, &gt;&gt; if they would murder us with envy, &gt;&gt; come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; Could we still give them &gt;&gt; bread of life? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Could we still after all they done? &gt;&gt; Good preaching. &gt;&gt; After all the pressures that they have put you through. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can we still give it to him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could we still do that? That's right. It's good. &gt;&gt; They didn't go through the pit. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; They didn't go through the prison. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They didn't go through the turmoils of all that Joseph went through. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he loved them. &gt;&gt; He loved them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That burden that he had carried for all of them years. He loved them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he would give them the bread. He would give them life. And there when they would tell their father that he's alive. Let me tell you what, that coat that he carried, I would still say that when his brethren came to him and said, "Dad, we got something to tell you." See, many years ago, we played that we had killed him, but that's not true. We had sold him, but now he is at Pharaoh's right hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I would say that what Jacob felt was more than any emotions than any of us could ever bear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The emotions he had carried, thinking his son was dead &gt;&gt; all them years, the burden that he had carried. Now his sons is telling him that they had false killed him, falsely accused and he's alive. I would say take me to him. I would say he'd take me to him. &gt;&gt; That's what he wanted. &gt;&gt; That's what Joseph wanted. That's what Jesus wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to say this morning, take me to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take me to that king. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Take me to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He bared that burden. He bared that cross for me. &gt;&gt; Take me to Jesus this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Though that burden of life that I have felt over and over again, &gt;&gt; take me to Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, many times in our life, we don't know what cross people are carrying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, I want to remind you, be careful &gt;&gt; of what cross someone's carrying. &gt;&gt; That burden was meant for them. that prosperity was meant for them. &gt;&gt; They don't need you to accuse them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't need you to lift to take them down. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; They don't need you to murder them. &gt;&gt; They want the best for you. &gt;&gt; He wants the best for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the bread of life. Jesus bread of life. Right? &gt;&gt; He was sold for silver. So was Jesus. &gt;&gt; He was cast into hell. So was Joseph. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But he arose. &gt;&gt; He arose to take all of your burdens &gt;&gt; and say, "Give them to me. &gt;&gt; Give me your burdens." That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it's not even your cross to bear. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh God, you did it all for us." &gt;&gt; All of this you did for us. &gt;&gt; More than accept it. He's did it for you this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Hebrews 12 and verse one and says, "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, &gt;&gt; let us lay aside every weight and sin which doth easily beset us." That's right. &gt;&gt; And let us run &gt;&gt; with patience the race that is set before us, &gt;&gt; looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne. throne of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say thank you Jesus? &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you for bearing this. &gt;&gt; Lay aside every weight &gt;&gt; that would beset you. &gt;&gt; Let him take your burden this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just bow our heads. Our dear most heavenly father, God, we thank you for what you did for us. Lord, this coat that we've carried, [Music] these burdens that we feel many times, God, thank you for just lifting them. Lord, day after day, time after time, they may come up on us, but we know that we can look to you, the author and the finisher of our faith. No God, I don't know what burden that people are bearing this morning here in this congregation or maybe listening by the way of the internet, but God, I ask you that you would just let that burden just fall off their shoulders this morning. Lord, I ask you that you'll just come and just dwell in us. Help us this morning, Lord. If there's jealousy in our heart, there envy towards a brother or a sister, forgive us, God. Forgive us, God. Lord, we love you. We thank you, God. Jesus name. Oh, I'm amazed [Music] that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed [Music] at how you care. Through your preious blood I found hard and my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. No one knew how alone I was feeling. And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Oh, I laughed and said my life was without you. I was covering up the secret I think one day someone told me of your mercy. Oh, there it is. Oh, and the love you showed on a hill called Calary. There you hide and purchase my rejection. Oh, when you rose power and set my spirit free. I'm amazed that you love me. Oh, [Music] through your graious blood I found you. Oh my s I'm amazed. Sing that again. How many way? Oh my [Music] way. Oh, I'm amazed that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed. How you came through your precious blood and Calary and my sin was there all wash way. Hope all I see are all the way. This is my desire to honor you. Lord, with all my heart I worship. Why don't you lay your burdens down today? I don't know what you're carrying, but why don't you lay them down? All I have with him I give you the praise. Hallelujah. All that I adore is in you. [Music] [Applause] Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you. Every breath that I take, every moment I wait, Lord, you have your way. [Music] This is my desire. Is that your desire this morning? to honor you, Lord. With all my heart I worship you. [Music] All I have within me I keep you praise. [Music] All that I adore is in you. [Music] [Applause] Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you, the Lord. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm away, Lord, you have your way. Give you my heart. I give you my soul. [Music] I live for you alone. Every breath I take, every moment I'm awake, Lord, have your way. [Music] Sure as he carried that burden of the cross. It got heavy, but he didn't complain. He's here to take your burdens this morning. Maybe you got a burden you've been bearing. You don't realize you're bearing it. You think it's just your burden to bear, but he already took it for you. Won't you lay it down this morning? Won't say, "Father, Lord, take me, Lord. Help me, Lord Jesus. Lord, it gets hard to walk with this burden, but don't you realize he already paid the price for it. He already went ahead of you and made a way where you couldn't make a way. He's the bread of life this morning. He's here for you to feed upon him." How many loves being in the house of God this morning? Amen. Amen. Amen. Wasn't it good to be in the house of God this morning? Father, bring this to our remembrance on Tuesday when our burdens start get heavy again. We got a place we can go. Aren't you thankful for that? I want to sing a song. I've never sang this before, but we're going to sing it or we're going to mess it up and we're going to look good doing it. All right. Well, praise the Lord. I got joy in my soul and God is in control. I got Satan on my trail, but I'm saying all his will. He's packing every day, but I'm watching while I pray. No matter the attack, I won't turn back.
