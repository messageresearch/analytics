bill and his funeral tomorrow and you know we're not we're not doubters here we're not uh people that are down here in misery but we are people that are celebrating the life of our brother and thank the Lord that he he was able to take our brother home even though our hearts are sadden we've Full Gospel Lighthouse lost a good one this week and uh one of the best men that there ever has been that walked in SHO leather and and stood in this church and uh just to think where we started 50 years ago that brother Bill was all a part of that there in his in his basement and to think that how far God has brought us and we see the blessings of almighty God and to think that brother Bill's went on to his reward and so we're just very appreciative of all that we have got to know and be a part of brother Bill's life throughout our history to think about that brother Bill had such an effect not just on the older generation but every every one of the younger generation and uh only a few men have that quality about them and we're very graced to have brother Bill as a as a deacon here for many years and much more to say on that tomorrow so just be remembering all the details of that that tomorrow I know the family would greatly appreciate your your prayers but uh we want to welcome the Dexter here with us they they've come all the way from Lana they they're going to be here with us this weekend and next weekend and and so maybe we'll get some uh brother Michael singing here this weekend and maybe sister Bethany oh no okay well miracles happen and that's what we're preaching about tonight so but uh we just we're very very honored to have them here they're one of our our closest friends and we we count them an honor count it an honor to have them here amen let's just let's just go to the Lord in prayer tonight and I know that we have many needs on our heart and many things that we're requesting from the Lord and and I believe that the Lord is here to meet each and every one of these needs tonight and how many would just like to say God won't you come by my way tonight amen maybe if it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable maybe reach your hand over to brother brother brother sister sister there and and they have needs just like you have needs and maybe not just pray for yourself just now but pray for your brother there and so we gathered together as a body of Believers here tonight let's just ask the Lord the god that we trust to come and minister to us tonight now father we come before you Lord we humble our hearts Lord and we recognize Lord Jesus that we are in the presence of The Great I Am and Lord we we invite you father that God of this this holy word that has promised us that he never leave us and he'd never forsake us and now we just ask Lord that you'd come father you see these these needs of your people father Lord how that they're Binding Together their faith just now father and you said in your word where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them and father we recognize that there's more than two or three here tonight but there's a whole host of Believers that have gathered themselves here father and they've come here hungry father for a touch of the Holy Spirit to minister unto them and I pray God that you would pour out your blessings like never before upon this generation father May the god of the Bible begin to show forth his majesty and his power and begin to begin to explode of Faith here in our in our hearts just now Lord and begin to minister to us Lord May the mighty Angel just begin to sweep through the building father and touching our pastor and healing his body father and the many other need needs that are here father Lord we commit them unto you father now God I ask Lord Lord that you see these hands that are laid upon one another and the Bible said that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now father that is a promises unto us Lord and we believe it as yes and amen now I pray God that you would Minister to your children by the preaching of the word as I step aside just now Lord I pray that you would begin to move in as I move out and may the holy Holy Spirit take control of my tongue and my actions and my words and my deeds and we'll be careful to serve you and give you all the praise and honor that is due unto thy name and all glory and all honor be unto the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and we pray this in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in a few portions of scripture there over in the Gospel of John oh and down also to Romans chapter 4 and also to Ephesians chapter 2 John chapter 5 say Amen when you have it this evening amen amen all right you don't know where it's at it's the fourth gospel in the New Testament John chapter 5 after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bea having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind ha withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 38 years and when Jesus saw him lie and knew that that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole ain't that a wonderful question wilt thou be made whole I wonder tonight will thou be made whole and the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another steth down before me Jesus saith unto him rise up take up th bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked on the same day was the Sabbath Romans chapter 4 and verse 16 therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that that only which is of the law but to that which to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and cth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead and when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform it also Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 4 Ephesians chapter 2 and verse4 and brother Brandon would say about Romans chapter 4 he said and whenever I'm down or whenever I'm blue he said I can always turn over to Romans chapter 4 and find real strength in it Ephesians chapter 2 and 4 but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened Us Together by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen may God bless his word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord tonight I would like to speak to you on a thought on the Paradox the Paradox of the miraculous the Paradox of the miraculous and tonight I want to focus I want to focus on the force of God that is moving a people into the miraculous and it's it it is we recognize that it is the moving of the holy spirit that is moving a people to believe like never before and the Bible that that we as Christians we read every single day it is we recognize that the author of this word he wants to come and he wants to show forth his power and show forth his attributes in uh in our life and in every one of us he wants to demonstrate that there is no God like our God he isn't just wanting it to do it for for maybe just a an elementary believer but he's wanting to do it for every believer on the level that they are in God is wanting to demonstrate that he is the almighty God and I have found in my life that God loves to show forth his power he loves to display his power but God does not clown or he does not show off for anybody but he wants to declare that he is the almighty God and there's one thing that you cannot do with God you cannot force God and push God around to work a miracle in your life but what you can do is you can take God at his word and you can believe what he has said and by your faith and by your faith in God's word it will bring to pass all of the promises that God has laid there in the promises even if you have what you would say faith like a mustard seed maybe you would see that it's just real small Faith but God is not requiring a great big faith God just wants a common faith it a what he says when he is saying there about a mustard seed kind of faith it isn't how small the faith is it's that that faith will not mix with anything else because you cannot mix a mustard seed with anything else it won't mix with unbelief faith will not mix with doubt it won't it won't mix with any thing of the world but faith will fully rely itself upon the god that is a miracle worker who is a promisee keeper who is a light in the darkness who is who is our sustainer of our soul he is the lifter of our head he is the Prince of Peace he is the king of kings he is the Lord of lords he is the mighty conqueror he is he is the Prince of Peace he is My All In All he is the mighty conqueror he is my defense he is my buckler he is my strength on one hand he's a god that is a silent partner but on the other hand he's your lawyer he's your Banker he's your doctor he's your surgeon he's your everything if you allow him to be your everything and that's the thing about you and God is that you and God were born together to be and built together to be partners in the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in This Hour you and God let's say it like this that you and God are Partners in the miraculous and that's what God is looking for in this hour a partner in the word of God brother Brandon would say he said sometimes you might think that you're a minority he said but God usually is in the minority but brother when he gets ready to move he shakes the majority with the minority because he's almighty God and you might feel like you're a nobody in the economy of God but God takes the minority and he takes the majority with the minority so it doesn't matter what your last name it is it doesn't matter what kind of background that you came from God is the kind of God that is looking for one person and that somebody to believe his word no matter what they come up against no matter what the obstacles that they face in life God is wanting somebody that believes when times get tough and when the rubber meets the road and when the when the trial gets hot God is wanting somebody that simply believes him and takes him at his word you see because difficulty is the very atmosphere of a miracle when you see difficulty I want you to recognize it like this from now on throughout all of your life to look at difficulty as the first stage of a miracle that when you begin to see troubles come and when you begin to see Trials come that you are first watching the first stage of a miracle begin to take place and if it's going to be a great miracle then the condition is not difficulty but it's impossibility but I have found about God that that is where God does his business very well is in the impossibilities of things of men because the Bible said that these things which are impossible with men are possible with God and Jesus would say over and over again for with God nothing is impossible so to think that tonight that no matter where you came from and no matter where you're going that the impossibilities of God are where God begins to produce exactly who he is all of God is Supernatural every being every little least little touch of God is the omnipotent power of almighty God and he's the same yesterday today and forever when you begin to look at the prophecy when Isaiah was standing there 800 years 800 years before Mary ever came upon the Earth he was under inspiration he wasn't brother random said he wasn't thinking about his intellectualism he didn't say he didn't say I wouldn't think he wasn't thinking about his intellectuals he said but wait a minute he said now wait a minute if I'd say that well you know the people would think that I'm insane he said see that's his intellectual he said there he's listening to Satan just like Eve did so you know that it doesn't matter what people see and it doesn't matter what people think about the consequences of your promises and the faith that you have in almighty God because Isaiah was simply a mouthpiece for almighty God he was simply saying what God put upon his lips he did not have a he did not have the ability to choose the words that he was speaking he was simply under the moving of the Holy Ghost and he spoke under inspiration even though it was against human reasoning he stood there and said a virgin is going to conceive and it took 800 years but in all the waiting God had seen her before Isaiah's prophecy had ever come out of Isaiah's mouth but you see God had a lady that he had forew before the foundational world that that little Mary was going to be a incubator that she was going to be the very bedding ground where Jesus would come from you see God had found a seed God had a seed but he found a bidding ground that he could drop the very spoken word into the womb of Mary and produced a very miracle that would trans ired to be one of the greatest Miracles that's ever been told throughout all the Earth without this miracle there is no Miracle Hallelujah without the miracle of Mary meeting meeting an angel and telling her that she's going to conceive and she's going to bring forth a child and she's going to name him Jesus let me tell you this is one of the greatest Miracles that there ever is and ever will be but it's one of the most questioned Miracles that there is in all the Bible there's a lot of people say that she met a German or a Roman soldier even Baptist theologians say that she slept with a Roman soldier to think it's coming for people that believe in Bible theory that say that she slept with a with a Roman soldier but God did not do anything God didn't do anything sexually wrong he simply spoke the word and she believed him at his word and I know it's a paradox to you that a virgin can can conceive at 16 years old and bring for the child and that child would save the whole world but there is another people in the land another virgin under their messenger who will be the final voice under their messenger I know it's a paradox but this woman is not manhandled this woman knows who she is she's not been touched by man she's not been touched by denominationalism she's been touched only by the hands of Jehovah and when you've only been touched by the hands of Jehovah there is a miracle there's a miracle in the room when Jesus is the only one touching you well glory be to God you don't need a doctor to touch you for the miracle to happen you don't need a lawyer to touch your situation or your case or to take your case but let Jehovah take your case let Jehovah walk into your hospital room woo well Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah now brother maram would say it he would preach it over and over again on a paradox he would tell us that he would draw from the thought there he said it's a paradox it means that something that's incredible but it's true it's a paradox it's incredible but it's true again he would say he said but the one who can bring a paradox is with us the god The God Who all of his works is a paradox it's past understanding it's incredible but it's true he can bring a paradox again he would say he said but if he will identify himself sir we would see Jesus and that's the only way that you can impersonate that cuz that's a miracle it's a paradox he said brother Andrew what are you preaching this why are you preaching this right now why are you preaching this right now don't you recognize where we are we're in need of a miracle well I ain't just talking about brother Ron situation and I ain't talking about maybe the prayer request situation but do you recognize that every one of us are here are in need of a miracle because without a miracle you're going by the way of the Grave Wire by the same way that brother bill went but you're are in need of a body change and I know it's a paradox but you're in you're right in line for it he said you can't impersonate that cuz that's a miracle it's a paradox it certainly is a paradox a paradox is a miracle something that cannot be explained it's a paradox again he would say now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained a miracle is something that happens and you cannot explain it that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's truth he said now people today he said a lot of modernists believe that the days of Miracles has passed he said they don't believe that there is such a thing as a miracle he said but yet I believe that the world is full of Miracles I believe the Paradox is constantly again he would say for instance I believe that every Born Again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves I read a sto a statement today that brother brandom said he said if you're a Christian if you're a Believer you're a miracle he said that's a miracle in itself is to be a believer when we're living in an hour when Jesus would say he said when the son of man comes again will he find Faith but I say that God has found favor in a little woman down here that is highly favored I know it's beyond your your human comprehension that you could bring forth a child and that a child could be a savior of the whole world I know it's beyond your human comprehension that you can produce a same works that Jesus produced I know it's beyond your beyond your comprehension that you're going to take a body change but if a little old woman could stand out there when her boy was dying with a social disease and she said where be my Elijah at and she had the kind of faith that could land a 747 plane what was it it was was that woman's faith that caused the storm what about it today if it's a paradox then it's a paradox now that somebody can believe what was it it was showing that God was working on both ends when William brandham started taking a walk and there was a woman waiting at the gate it's a sign tonight that God is working on both ends you're in need of a miracle and God's got a preacher preaching that God is still the [Applause] God where be my Elijah at she couldn't ask that in the 1800s but when she was standing there in the 1940s she had every right to say where be my Elijah at Hallelujah and Elijah come walking by our way she looked at him said Barson how'd you know I a Parson I've been up early this morning talking to Jesus where's your briefcase at Parson it showed that she had seen him in a vision the Lord done show me that she was coming down here now if that woman was in that condition and could accumulate that kind of Faith what about you tonight the seals are open to you that book has been open under you you're a third pole kind of people so brother Andrew I don't know if I can have that kind of faith I believe that I can give you my kind of faith I believe for you when you do not believe brother Matthew I believe for you when you when you you feel like God is you I got that kind of Faith you said well how in the world can you can you say that you can give us your faith when you start reading over in Acts chapter 3 and Peter and John start walking down there by the beautiful gate that God did not have that kind of Faith but when Peter said such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ so maybe you sit and say that I don't have that kind of Faith but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ so welcome to your new kind of [Applause] Faith Hallelujah my kind of faith says it's time for a body change my kind of Faith said cancer is defeated my kind of Faith said that there's a people that is birthed to take a change welcome to the faith of almighty God it's a Paradox that you can believe when things are unbelievable but the miracle is in the [Applause] room woo in all and in all ages God had men he had Ministry in every age because God is Supernatural and when God comes on the scene Supernatural takes place for he is Supernatural and his people always look for him in the Supernatural because when they become sons of God they become the very nature of God and in that they pick up that believing himy so when you were born again you picked that up you didn't even know that you had that kind of Faith but when you got a new change when you got a new heart when you took off the old coat and you put on the new you didn't know what you was doing but you was picking up that kind of Faith well glory be to God come on somebody this ain't picking up your groceries this ain't picking up your laundry this ain't picking up your kids from school this is picking up Jesus and when you pick up Jesus you better get ready for a miracle come on somebody you can pull into the car line down here at Elon middle school and your kid may not come out but when you go to pick up up Jesus Jesus will always be there he's right on time he was on time for Lazarus he was on time for the Hebrew children it's a paradox it's a paradox of a little bitty boy could pack his lunch to school and could feed 5,000 but it happened brother bham said brother bam said to them critics in that day he said they said well ain't no wonder it could feed 5,000 loes was bigger then I'd hate to carry that sucker to work that thing be that thing be the longest as long as 200 yards I'm going to school mama I got Five Loaves with me today and two little fishies he's a big fish back in it's a paradox I tell you if you got that kind of Faith you got more faith than I got but no help me Lord again he would say everywhere God moves anytime Through the Bible you'll see healing and miracles and signs and wonders he leaves a track behind him of the supernatural wo well I'm following Jesus all the way he's leaving behind him the track of the supernatural he said I don't care what theologians say when the Bible is WR he said when God moves the world shakes I read it just before I come out he said brother BR said he said it's in those hours of great trials and great stresses just like when the three Hebrew children they were getting ready to be thrown into the fire he's brother bom said but when he moves he moves and you may not be sitting here in a fiery furnace but maybe you're in the trial of your life but I'll say this when God moves he moves maybe I ain't speaking to anybody here in the building maybe I'm just talking to somebody up there on the stream I'm preaching to these angels down here but somebody up there is needing but let me bring news to you when he moves when he moved upon the waters and he said let there be light and there was light when he moves he moves when he moved through the three h children he moved I was listening to a sermon today from 1957 in Saskatoon brother brandham is preaching their love and brother brandham he's he's having a prayer line it goes on for about an hour and brother random is dealing with a he's dealing with a de mute girl and he's trying to he's trying to speak to her and he's trying to talk to her and he and he he's trying to accumulate her he's trying to get her to believe and and now brother man said he said now he starts talking about this he said now she won't know what to do with her healing he said but her daddy will inst instructor in it I'd say there's some mamas and daddies that's still willing to instruct their children in the Bible kind of Faith because she'd never heard before she'd never spoke before but there was going to come healing to her life but brother M said brother M while he's telling this you can hear him sit there and he said now he said just like Gesa went up there for Elijah and he climbed that hill and he come back down there saying that I only only see the size of the hand of a man up there what was it when Elijah heard that he said I hear the abundance of rain are coming and brother bam said may this be just a little bit of sign to this little girl and when brother brandham says that there's another lady that brother brandham has already prayed for in the prayer line and she's down there nodding her head she was death and couldn't hear but while brother Brandon is saying that said I see the hand of a man's the cloud the size of a man's hand when that woman heard brother brandom talking about that she received her healing when she'd been prayed for minutes or maybe 20 minutes before but she's down there nodding about it but it what was it a sign it was a sign that there was an abundance of rain that was coming and brother bandam starts praying for that little girl she can't hear and she can't speak but when brother brandham gets done speaking with her he starts clapping her hands he starts clapping his hands he said she can hear what are you talking about brother anro brother you walked into the building tonight you had Faith to sit down here tonight I would receive that as the size of a hand of a man but let there be an announcement from heaven in Full Gospel Lighthouse I hear the sound of the abundance of rain that is coming I know it's a paradox for you to believe that these things are possible I know it's a paradox for you to believe that Isaiah would say that there's going to be that you're going to be there and your Offspring is going to be there with them I know it's a I know it's a burden on you sister Sean but I don't know how to explain it any other way than the Bible said that you'll be there and your Offspring will be there with you I can't explain it myself but I believe it I can't explain why he take a hillbilly out of pilot Virginia and make him a preacher like he made him send him all across the world become a legend a legend of Faith put him in a fire and he came out preaching knock him off a roof and he got up preaching come on somebody it's a paradox but it's true Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah call me crazy but we're 50 years into this Jubilee and it started brother in brother Bill's hle in his basement but we ain't in the basement no more honey we're up here on the hill and it's a sign to all the world that there is a lighthouse that's still preaching the Full Gospel it's been 50 years since we started and it started in a basement but 50 years later we're still sounding Out the same trumpet it's freedom I hear the sound of the abundance of rain coming 50 years we ain't slaves to it no more brother maram said in the second seal he said he said when a man turns down that Jubilee He said Satan marks him by deafening his ears to the word of God he said but God brother Rand said but God marks his children by vindicating the word through them don't you realize that you're not marked like Satan would Mark you but you're marked by almighty God what am I saying to you I'm saying that Randall Griffith is marked by almighty God and he's vindicating the promises of God through him hallelujah hallelujah what am I saying to you you're not marked by Satan you're Mark by the Jubilee trumpet hallelujah it's a paradox it's a paradox that people are fellowshipping with him by the hearing of the word and right here people are overcoming right here in Satan's Eden in the midst of perversion in the midst of utter chaos and they're living true to almighty God and his bride is dressing herself with a spoken word can I say this she's a rapsure ready lady and the wagon wheels of Prophecy are rolling as she's dressing herself in the robe of Malachi Four's word now notice what brother Brandon says here in the Rapture he said but to the TRU to the church the bride he said the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of that Rapture he said now it is a revelation he said for the Revelation is a faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you so what does this body have she has a rapturing kind of faith and I'll say it like this is that your faith has been a identified by Christ himself just like when George J Lacy was standing there in 1950 and brother Brandon would tell this over and over and over again he would stand there and George J Lacy would say now look I was a doubter myself he said I thought it was all psychology myself he said but I can only say this is that that light struck that lens and it is the only super natural being that has ever been photographed what was it the head of the FBI was a denying that the PF fire has made its return to the body of Jesus Christ and that is identifying that her faith is identified in the body now brother R said now watch it he said watch The Works of it among you he said it proves the same Jesus that once lived in Palestine is the same spirit that was upon him has come through a body until it's come back to the headship again which he's coming soon to claim the body amen the head's coming to the body so what is it saying Brothers BR saying to us is that the faith of the headship has been identified in the body what was it that Pillar of Fire was an identification that that was Israel's leader right there and what is that sign signed to us every single time you see that Pillar of Fire and you look at that picture and you identified as the same yesterday today and forever what is it you're identifying that that's our leadership up there let me say this to you there's too many times that people get their picture or get their eyes on the picture and get their eyes on the wrong one in the picture but that is simply Revelations chapter 101 over Revelations Chap 10:7 and what is it it was identifying that but that is our leadership right there and he is not leading you to doubt he's not leading you to fear he's not leading you to anxiety he's not leading you to pain he's not leading you to Trouble Is there anybody wanting me to preach to him tonight he's not leading you to trouble he's leading you on a way out of here just like it was revealed to Abraham that he was going to bring forth a child it has been revealed to this God the Rapture ain't for another age it ain't for another ler this lamb these broken seals this broken body is a sign that this is her token out of here let me say this to you like this she has a right to stay in the house she has a right to stay in the house and not taste death she has a right to stay in the house and her firstborn not die she has a right to stay in the house and worship God in the way that she wants to and not taste death she has a right to put her shoes on her feet and not taste death she has a right to keep her staff in her hand and not taste death she has a right because the blood has been applied and it's over the heart's door she's got every right to worship God in spirit and in truth and I know it might be a paradox to you but the token has been applied and the Third Exodus is at hand I know it's a paradox to you that Elijah walked across the Jordan River smoted it and went up in a fiery Char a fiery charity I know it's a paradox to you that it's recorded that that's a second Rapture that's recorded in the Bible but I want you to know that those chariots that were hanging on those bushes are there waiting for you so that you can be the fourth recorded Rapture in the Bible I know it's a I know it's a paradox that Enoch was the seventh from Adam and he walked with God and he was not and I know it's a paradox to you that you're the seventh from the second Adam I know it's a paradox to you but you're walking and just keep on walking and one of these moments between the hours of 6 and 9 it ain't got to be 6 and N over here in the United States it could be 6 and N in Zimbabwe or over in Portland over in over over in a different country it could be six and nine there but I know that I know that I know that William brandham said that it would be in the Third Watch of the day and it's been perally revealed to us that we are that body come on somebody you're the you're the seventh from the second Adam and you're a type you're a type you're a type of Enoch you're the anot type to him what was he simply doing he was playing out the type of you and every demon out of hell is trying to stop the program of allmighty God you watch it you watch it we are seeing every demon out of the pit of Hell attack the ministry like never before every demon out of hell it's attacking the aity across the body of Jesus Christ like never before like never before every demon out of hell is attacking the moving of the Holy Ghost and the preaching of the gospel and speaking in tongues and worshiping God in the way in the way that God ordained us to worship him but I want to say it to you like this it's a God thing it's a God thing because the stronger that they think they fight against us the stronger we get it's a God thing it's a God thing keep hit me tell me not to worship and I'll still be here worshiping tell me not to preach and I'll still be here preaching what is it it's a God thing come on every demon in Hell's got his gun trained against Israel right now but there's a counterpart there's a spiritual Israel that's not backing off of any of her bloodbound promises she's preaching she's lining her War she's lining her weapons of warfare up and she's sending out the bombs notice notice you ain't never going to put this out you can be against us all you want to but you'll never put this out you can try to stop us but you'll never put this out you can try to preach against us but you'll never put this out come on somebody Homer phaser did not die in vain believeing that the message is Right Bill hle did not die in vain believeing that the message is right you can't put this out well I'm going to need a quote for it brother Andrew I'm glad you asked me he said in the days of Pentecostals in the restoring back of the gifts he said the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues and casting out devils and the gifts he said why it's testified he said there was no joke about it people said when it was first raised he said I read the books on the history of the Pentecost and they said it can't last long it'll burn down it's still burning why is because you can never put it out God said it would be there it it's that portion of the word and no more could you put that out and then when the bride is being called out how you going to put it out how you going to put it out what is this this is the calling out of the bride and when the bride's being called out how you going to put it out he said it's a revelation of the manifestation of the word made true and we living in that day praise be to God it is the revelation of the mystery himself he said but the Rapture is only he said the Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride you might be able to put it out with the Church of Christ message people but you will not put it out with a bride come on somebody you might put it out with the Methodist message Believers or the bap this message believer us but you won't put it out with a bride come on somebody I'm talking to you about a paradox that you can believe that you can't stop this Holy Ghost Fire come on somebody it's more than a song but it's fire shut up in my bones and I can't be quiet and I can't shut up and I can't stop preaching and I Can't Stop Dancing and I can't stop rejoicing [Applause] Hallelujah I'll be honest I'm getting real sick and tired of Burying my friends I'm getting sick and tired of it people that I love going beyond the grave but it's a sign to me it's a sign to me that we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet them what is it they are there waiting on us sister caring's waiting on us brother Homer's waiting on us your loved one is there waiting on us and they cannot be perfect without you and I so it's time to run your race with everything that's within you don't you ever give up and don't you ever get in don't you ever don't you ever let the enemy try to whisper in your ear that you're not good enough for this message that you're not good enough for the Rapture Rise Up Smack That Donkey right in the mouth and tell him shut shut up I'm a born son and daughter of God I've got a thorough bread revelation of who I am I got a pedigree come on somebody you're not some sanctimonious donkey sitting there thinking who's he talking about you're a thoroughbread with a [Applause] pedigree you can't shut me up you didn't vote me in so you can't vote me out God elected me God called me God ordained me I'm born for this message I'm identified for the [Applause] Rapture I was thinking today when I was in my study we to think about when Joshua was under his Commission I don't know the Bible doesn't the Bible doesn't give us indicators on this but I just begin to imagine this me just give me a little bit of Liberty here but I can imagine as Moses wasn't granted to go over on the other side but when Joshua steps into his role maybe the Lord allowed Moses just a little bit of a space of time to be able to look over the banisters because you remember the Angels packed Moses home he didn't die they packed him home because he was found 2,000 years 4,000 years later up there on Mount Transfiguration but I could imagine if Moses is able to look beyond the banisters and look over there and see Joshua under his commission oh yeah I know I know what it's like with my when my girls do something spectacular I know how it makes me feel you imagine as a daddy how it makes you feel as a parent how it makes you feel but you imagine how Moses is just just give me a little bit here imagine as Moses is he's on that side and he's looking down there that's my boy he's preaching what I preached he's living out what I what I what I said was going to happen when I was up there on that mountain and I met that Burning Bush when I met that burning bush and he told me that we was going to come back to this mountain and now Joshua is under his commission he's there he's operating under my authority what was he operating under he was operating under the authority of a prophet you imagine how Moses sitting there when when Joshua walks out there in Joshua chapter 3 Joshua chapter 4 Joshua chapter 5 Joshua chapter 6 he goes out there and walks across Jordan he walks into Jericho and tears it down he goes into Joshua 10 what is Joshua grabbing a hold of in Joshua chapter 10 he is simply aligning himself with the message of Moses Now give me a little bit of Liberty but could you imagine if William Brandon's able to look over over the banister of time and able to look out across a body and say they're living out what I preached they're being exactly what I saw in a vision and Joshua was standing there in Joshua chapter 10 and his enemies is coming against him and he's running out of time and he simply takes the word of Moses and he puts Deuteronomy 28 in effect and he stops the son because you'll never be able to curse a son of almighty God when he's blessed by almighty God hallelujah that thing keeps cutting out on me I'm sorry Brothers but Joshua was simply under his commission he was simply sitting there under the authority of a prophet preaching and living out what a prophet said what was he doing he was under the commission he was under his commission and whenn josua got over there when he was running out of time when he was running out of time and he simply put him in a cave he put him in that cave and he put them five Kings in there and he went back there after he had defeated their armies he brought them five Kings out notice what he does Joshua invites the captains of the army to come under the same Authority that he was under do like I'm doing do like I'm doing you put your foot on their neck what does William Brenham say you say what the tape says what are we operating under we are operating under the ministry of Malachi 4 you have the authority of a prophet that is backing you up so come on somebody you're not just under an Acts 2 anointing of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit you're under a Revelations 10 anointing the mighty Angel Hallelujah is standing here and he's inviting you to put your foot upon the neck of your enemy what are you going to do about it what are you going to do about your pain what are you going to do about your troubles what are you going to do about it I say it's time you put your foot on that line devil and try it's high time that you stomp his mouth out stop him from speaking if he says you're a liar if he says you're not good enough put your foot on his neck say well I don't got got that kind of faith brother BR said I'd never confess that come on somebody the devil can put it in your mind and the devil can make you think about looking at the wrong things but don't you ever listen to him don't you confess his thoughts now notice what brother ROM said he said when God moves in a supernatural your heart will hunger right to it he said you won't get off on one side and say well it's mental telepathy a devil beels above I don't believe that my church don't teach that you'll say God be praised forever you're not going to sit there and think that's for days gone by you're filled with the Holy Ghost you can only think his thoughts but you see how you receive the supernatural it determines your reward what you think about this service tonight will determine your reward after tonight is that right my brother Brandon was dealing with a patient one time he's sitting there and he's dealing with a lady and he start he starts talking to her he said now he said if I would just simply lay my hands upon her and I would pray the prayer of faith over her and I could send her on her way and just say now go on believing he said now he said if I did that he said I would be in accordance to the Bible he said but if God would stand here and say something to her about her past that I don't know anything of she would have to identify that that is a supernatural power that it's coming from a resource there he said now however she thinks about that whether she thinks that it's a devil or she thinks it's a mental telepathy he said that's how she'll be rewarded so how you think about what the Supernatural is saying to you is what you're going to witness all right all right now we're getting somewhere but what you are witnessing right here right now is none other than the moving of the Holy Spirit when we see our young girls on fire like never before and rising up and living out the message their hearts being transformed their lives and their healings being made manifest in their lives relationships being restored young boys becoming real men and young women becoming Real Women of Faith when we see prodal returning when we see families being restored when see when we see the miracle of the present everyday hour becoming made manifest in our hour we would say this is none other than the moving of the Holy Ghost brother brandom said in the invisible Union of the Bride he said some of you people really believe this he said to be the truth he said we're entering into another age he said we're entering into a Rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition it can't get any better he said but it must get worse he said how many people knows that amen say amen he said it's got to get worse and it can't go like this he said it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's on he said the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus sayith the Lord the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the Lord what made Abraham what moved him to believe that he could have a child in his old age it was the moving of the Holy Spirit what moved Jesus to walk down there by a pool and go in there in a hospital room and only pick out one man he said I can do nothing except my father first showed me what is it he was moved by the Holy Ghost what is it when you see the troubling of the waters come what is it brother B would tell us he said now when you see Waters he said in the Bible he he said it represents people and he said when you see people being moved by the Holy Ghost he said you see it's the Angel that's working on the waters and you think about this how that your faith has been stimulated tonight you identify that now now what is it it is an angel that is here now now you recognize that that William William William brandom was standing there that we all know that there was a healing angel that was standing there at the platform he said now I don't see him here he said but we recognize that he's here he said you don't see it between you and I and he said I don't see it just it he said but I can tell that there's a force that is standing between you and I now what was it he was identifying that there was somebody that was personal to the person and that's what I think about is so great about our Lord Jesus Christ is that he can be so Supernatural to one person and that person can think man that's the most Supernatural thing that's ever happened in my life and maybe to the next person they don't think that's very Supernatural but that's how great God is is that he can be Supernatural on the level that you are at and that's what I think so amazing about it is some people they get so excited when they lose their car keys and then somebody finds them it may not mean something to somebody else but it means a world to the person that lost her keys it may not mean much to you to get healed of a headache tonight but the person that gets healed of it it's a miracle to them and that's what makes God so big tonight is that God can come down and speak to 250 people and he can make himself so Supernatural and you don't see it working in here and you don't feel it maybe working in here but there's a being that is identifying itself to every individual and he's speaking to them and he's ministering to them and he's blessing them and you might think man that scripture didn't do nothing for me but man had meant the world to them I don't understand why they're shouting like they're shouting and maybe they don't understand why you're clapping the way you're clapping but if they understood on the level that you're at if they walked in your shoes for a mile maybe they would understand that it's a paradox that you could show up at church had all kinds of Hell happen to you all this week and then all of a sudden Heaven drops down now it's going to be a paradox to you when your loved one that's done went beyond the veil of Tears they start walking in mother Brandon would say it in certain ways you're going to see it you'll see them and then will be changed and then we'll be changed and then we'll see him but as long as we're changed as long as we're changed and brother man would say it in this way when you see them don't be afraid what is it it's the culmination of your faith it is rapturing Faith on you that is Raising you to believe that you're getting ready to be gone you're going to spend about 30 or 40 days with them you're going to fellowship with them you're going to see who who's going to be there and who's not going to be there and it's a paradox I know it's a paradox to you but there's going to be some people that see them and there's going to be people that are sitting here tonight that will not see them but you'll know but you'll know but you'll know and I know I don't know about you but saying a statement like that it makes my heart cry out God get a hold of every one of them don't let them miss it don't let them miss them coming don't let them miss this change what was it up there at the pool of the C in John chapter 5 there was some people that got it and some people that didn't get it but this man was laying there with excuses but when Jesus showed up in the room the excuses was God on sister Julia they were gone right there because Jesus showed up come on somebody drop your old habits drop your cigarettes drop your alcohol drop your habits Jesus showed up why' he tell him pick up your bed and walk because he wasn't going back there to laying at no more I ain't going back to that hell hole I ain't going back to their beer joint I ain't going back to them trials I ain't going back to them demons iin I ain't going back to them caves I ain't going back to them chains I ain't going back to that shame I ain't going back to that guilt I ain't going back to that condemnation I'm not going back to that sin I hear you I hear you I hear you Hallelujah I ain't going back to that Legion today's your day you're coming out of them gray clo turn that air down you're coming down you're coming out of there forever you're not going back to that no more you're not going back to that no more you're not going back to that cave the things that's bothered you they're going to bother you no more the things that's troubled you they're going to trouble you no more I hear you it's a paradox but you're going to walk out of here you're going to walk out of here changed I have locked eyes I have locked eyes with the one that's going to set me free I have locked eyes and when those demons when those demons looked up there and they seen Jesus they started crying because they knew that that was the one that had the power to make them go and them demons are screaming out tonight but the Holy Ghost is screaming even [Music] louder I can hear him roaring I can hear him roaring but I can hear the Holy Ghost I can hear that wind roaring like it came down on the mighty day on that rushian wind in Acts chapter two and it filled all the house where they were sitting in let the demons how but the wind's coming I hear the sound of the abundance of rain are coming tonight your blessing is in the room ah come on somebody if you can't see it and if you can't feel it I want you to know the angels in the room the angels in the wall ERS it's time for you to Simply take a step that little boy that little boy Drew right there he's got a good name every single time he puts his foot down he's a walking talking Miracle what's he doing he's fulfilling what Joshua said every place that The Souls of your foot tread upon that's your land what did I read you Ephesians chapter 2 for this is your position this is your hour this is your place don't you ever let the devil try to rob you from your position and your place why don't you stand up on your feet March down to the enemy's camp and take back what the devil stole from [Applause] you how many years has it been sister Bethany how many years has it been since Drew's when since Drew's Miracle seven years and he's still walking every single time he wakes up and starts walking it's a black eye to the devil brother Ryan sent me something this week on Congressman Upshaw crippled for 66 years but he always believed he always believed that he could be healed he always believed that but when he received his healing he lived a year and N nine months later but he was perfectly whole the entire time you may have walked in here one way but you'll walk out of here another way I'm prophesying to you tonight you you're going to walk in here one way and you're going to walk out another way a miracle walked in the room when you showed up because you're identifying with a headship that the angel the mighty Angel is working over this body of Believers the Rapture is working on the inside of you s years and he's still walking 16 years 16 years a man laying in a coma a man laying there and induced coma 17 days burn all over 170% of his body burned 75% of his lungs burnt but 16 years the God still got a testimony it's a paradox but it's true now I'm going read you this brother bisco's granddaughter Ella she means a lot to the Spencer family she shared this with us while we was at Mount Baker campus summer and I I forget exactly all the details but she had she was going into her she was going into her dorm and she was going to turn on a tape or and then another tape came on or another tape was playing and she shared this with us brother brandham brother brandham is is sitting there and he's praying he said God how happy we would be he said if you just now I know you've already done the healing he said if you could just give them a little extra push tonight as it was just push them into the pool while it's troubled Lord just give them a little extra push while it's troubled Lord granted may maybe that same angel that whired down from the skies troubled that water maybe that's the same one that come night after night I I do not know thou knowest but the Bible said it was an angel and I believe that I pray father that while the waters will be stirred tonight trouble choppy people raising up here looking at that screaming out many many everyone the angel of God just just spread his great wings as it were around this building tonight and push every one of them right into the pool and may there come a perfect healing tonight healing of the soul and body through this body May there not be a feeble one Lord left I I know according to your word I know according to your word Lord is all I have to go by and with all that I know how to believe I believe that you've already paid for every person in here to be well I believe that our lord Jesus thy son did that at Calvary and he said all things are possible if you just believe it when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for and you shall have it now this girl you forgive me but this girl is a girl but she's got the most powerful faith of any person I know I'm not making you feel bad but I want you to know that she's got that kind of faith that girl you can feel her in the room she's got that kind of atmosphere about her I the angel of the Lord stands real close to that girl but there she sits in that condition and she ain't received her healing yet but she's that got that kind of faith and this quote is playing while she walks into her room at night while we were working in that prayer line I could just feel I could just feel the supernatural taking place and something I I personally I never witnessed before was happening and Katie can identified to this is that that when those young people were coming off that prayer line they would they were literally they were pushed from one end by a being they were pushed into a circle and young boys were praying together and young girls were praying together and she may not even WR recognize what was happening but I simply I whed around to her and said are you watching I don't know if she even caught what I was talking about I said are you watching the quote that she had just sent was taking place these young people were pushed into the waters maybe you don't understand what's happening here tonight but I hope you're watching I hope you're watching is that there's a people that's being pushed into the Waters of the supernatural I hope you're watching here tonight because there's somebody's Faith that's raising up to believe that tonight they're walking out of here the last time they stay at this bed they stay in this position come on somebody you're seated in Heavenly places you're an overcomer this is your seat this is your position blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother random said he said I was a hillbilly Kian he said but that angel told me that I was going to go pray for kings and monarchs he said how could I believe that he said me a hillbilly Kentucky and how could I I believe that he said but that angel had never told me nothing wrong he said so I had to believe it when he prayed for King George and when he prayed for Congressman Upshaw what was he doing he was identifying that he was praying for kings and he was praying for monarchs William brandom said he was doing the same thing that Daniel did Hallelujah he was doing the same thing that d Daniel did he simply was taking God at his word he was taking God at his word when Daniel heard they were going to throw him in a lion's den when they heard he couldn't when they told him that he wasn't going to be able to pray no more Hallelujah when he heard when he heard they didn't want him to worship no more Daniel still did what God asked him to do he didn't do something new he did what he always did he threw up the curtains and he begin to pray because he expected God to be with him in his prayer brother bam said I trusted that angel I trusted that angel and he led me to do what was right and Daniel trusted the word of the Lord and he expected him to be there brother mam said it like this he said he expected God to to be in that Lin's Den he said because there had been an atonement that was made up there at the temple there was a burning sacrifice up there that there was an innocent substitute that had gave its life and it was a sign to Daniel even though he was in the valley of the shadow of death even though it was going to stop the mouth of lions and he would be a hero of Faith he was expecting God to be there what is it your faith showed up your faith showed up and brother Maron would said like this he said I know it's hard for you to believe but every Christian is a miracle you're a paradox you're a Believer you're Faith showed up another would say now I can feel your faith I can feel your faith I can tell you're a real Christian your your spirit that you have it's an identification to me that you're a real Christian you're a real Christian what is it it's identifying that what you have believed in is none other than the truth because God is going to work is vindicating power through you you've been marked by the Vindication you forgive me just a minute you ever walked into the wrong bathroom has a weird feeling ain't it make you feel like a big dummy not unless you're that kind of guy go to Target all the time any who we ever walked into a bathroom things don't look right to you like oh shoot I'm in the wrong place I'm in the wrong place you know I'd say that's a way the devil walks out of here tonight I solded up at the wrong place I walked in there thinking I was in the right place but when your faith showed up he said oh I'm in the wrong I'm in the wrong I'm in the wrong I'm in the wrong I'm in the wrong place I'm in the wrong place you went in there thinking that you was going to take care of business but you was in the wrong place it's kind of like David said blessed be the name of the Lord and bless His holy name blessed be the name of the Lord and forget not all of his benefits who Health thee of all thy iniquities who forgiveth thee of all thy diseases the devil showed up at the wrong place your faith has identified who you are what am I saying to you you're a paradox you're you're a real Paradox you're a real Paradox you're a real Paradox I wish you could feel what I feel maybe you do maybe that's why you got that look on your face you're a incredible much of true sister Morris she shared something with me a few weeks ago she was given a watch for for a special gift from her son and daughter-in-law she lost that gift lost that watch she will look for it everywhere she look for it everywhere she looked in places that it shouldn't be and everything else and 6 months later I was preaching to you two two weeks ago when a paradox of a promise about brother brandom saying if I needed that little Barlo knife in my pocket it could be right there she testified to me she said I had lost that watch and I'd looked everywhere she said but I went and looked in the Box this this week and I looked in there and there that watch was in a place that I never would have put it but when something means so much to you if it's interesting to you it's interesting to almighty God if he cared about a little bitty possum and the possum had that kind of faith that she could go by the way of a prophet how much more can you be a paradox here tonight and go by the way of Jesus Christ what do you think of this Jesus do you think he's still a miracle worker do you still think he's a promis keeper do you still think he's a way maker do you still think is a light in the darkness what do you think about it God's interested in little bit he owe you God ain't never disappointed you God ain't never let you down the angel has showed up to do the [Applause] miraculous I feel like every fiber in my being is on fire can you imagine what it was like when a man of God steps into a restroom and the angel of the Lord standing there and said the night's eser night and you walk in in that same room and you had trouble and your family had trouble but the miscarriages was over because you stepped into the same room where the angel was and you watch the miraculous take place could you imagine the same man of God being looked over by doctor after doctor said it's cancer throughout your body you got cancer in your brain you got cancer in your lungs you got cancer here it could be possible here but could you imagine that same angel that made the miraculous and had bumped the water and the miraculous took place that angel wasn't wrong when it spoke to Esther that angel wasn't wrong when it touched your life that angel wasn't wrong when it spoke to you and said if you trust me I'll use you like never before that angel ain't wrong when he said I'm going to heal you and I'm going to make you whole that angel ain't never been wrong brother Ron he's never discounted ature Faith but you have discounted Satan's faith in what he thought was possible and you have proved that God is a god of impossibilities every time you wake up you show up and show out that God is a god of the Paradox what about you tonight the angel ain't [Applause] wrong I just like I believe it for sister Esther I believe it for brother Ron I believe it for brother Denny I believe it for brother Tom I believe it for sister Julia you know what he told you what's the truth don't you ever doubt

hours and brother Bill and brother Roger danced in the aisle for two hours solid amen hallelujah hallelujah we just enjoyed and we've all of us has got a brother Bill story well I was passing out and I I went out and they put me in the car well we were only 5 minutes from there from the hotel I woke up an hour later and we were still driving and the instructions with Brother Bill said just follow the sun where it went down we were lost and I said 'w pull into a fuel station and we did and they were they were taking all of their donuts out of the case and he said I want all of them so they told us how to get home and and so anyway he gave me and brother Roger one a piece I didn't eat mine cuz it was stale and I don't like anything stale and brother Roger found a cockroach on his and so he wouldn't eat his we were checking out of the hotel the next day and I I was getting in the car and today I was going to drive and so anyway we were getting check getting into the car and I said Bill

resting on that oh yeah amen thank you thank you for such a wonderful service you can't orchestrate it any better than that you cannot orchestrate it any better than that I think that brother Bill
