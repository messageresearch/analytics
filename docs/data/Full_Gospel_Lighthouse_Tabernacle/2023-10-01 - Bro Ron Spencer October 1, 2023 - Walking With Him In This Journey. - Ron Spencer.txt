so we just love him with all of our hearts and so would ask you to pray for us and that God would give us strength and and wow I love these s songs today and so amen amen maybe you can sing that again after I get done amen and I'll I'll shout with you so amen God bless you God bless you thank you for coming ready for church today I didn't know what you guys were going to sing but I'm speaking today on walking with him in this journey if you will turn with me to Revelations CH 12 and verse 10 so glad to have you in the house of the Lord last night was awesome here amen just I just I just really enjoyed that last night Revelations chap 12 and verse 10 amen and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come s salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night I hope I read that in such a way that Satan heard it and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives un death turn with me to Revelations 19 and verse 6 I want to read a few few portions of scriptures about you today that one was about you and this one is about you as well and I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude and a voice of many Waters and the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen white and clean for the fine linen is a righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word Revelations 21 and verse 1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea right here I just like to just pause just for a moment if maybe you read it this week but Benjamin Netanyahu who is the who is the leader of of Israel he actually came and spoke at our at our Congress and add add the Congress and it felt like it was like Joshua standing before our Hall of Congress uh speaking to them of prophetic times this week he spoke before the UN reminding us that we're on the the brink of the end and how that the AI technology is is so dangerous and of course they know it in a different level how that there will be Wars like no other War take place and I thought he might must be reading the message of the hour thought it was significant that he was the one that was speaking that not just other world leaders was saying it but he was a leader that was standing there knowing that there's a war that is coming their way a war called Army geddon it's getting ready to happen and and we realize that that this heaven and this Earth will pass away last night said that as as brother Andrew was speaking he said heavens and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away so we're not making plans to stay here this is not the dimension that we want to stay amen notice what he says and I John saw the holy city of New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard heard as if it was a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former thing are passed away we could pause right there and Shout for the rest of the day and he that sat up on the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely and he that overcometh here we are amen he that overcometh shall inherit all things inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son if I could just drop just a thought right here there was a time where Ruth was gleaning in the field but she was getting ready to be the owner of the field the season that you're in might be difficult for you right now but you are the Queen of Heaven turn to your neighbor and say we are the Queen of Heaven our time here is allotted on Earth if you live to be a hundred years old it's only just a brief passage yesterday for us that's got some gray in our hair some of us has got more greater than others but it feels like yesterday we were boys that's right little girls playing my and just a thought here when I was a little boy the first Vision that I had was at 7 years old and I was sitting on a rock it was in my dad's it was on the top of a boulder that was sitting in our in my um yard that I grew up in and I was sitting on that rock and it was it was the the the sun was warm and I was sitting there just enjoying the day and I had my first vision of course I didn't understand how it all worked I just saw it and I ran into the house and told Dad that I was getting ready to get a horse he asked me what color it was and how it was made up and he wanted to hear all the details of it and it was a short time later that he he had decided I'm going to get you a horse and Mark if he's listening we'll hear these things and so we we went to a man named Mr altiser Mr altiser would had had pinto horses and and for Stephanie you know what they are they're beautiful animals they make good cutting horses good cattle horses and good running horses and so anyway the horse that I saw was standing in his field dad took that bought that horse and it bought it for just literally nothing and the he told Mr altiser about the vision Mr altiser wanted to be a part of of all of that and so he was a great man and so we got the horse dad broke it we rode it rode it for many years and there was a man stopped and said I want that horse and he gave dad multiple times what that horse we had paid for it that horse became the champion of the horse shows in Florida so it had something in it saying all that to say this to you God seen something in you that so many of you didn't see in yourself and you see as life is just a vapor and we're just going through sometimes we don't find our purpose until God speaks to us and then when he ignites that purpose in our life we begin to walk with God and talk with God and and we realize that we can't even got ourself there's times that we're walking in the darkness and and it just seems like that it's just it's just chaos all around us and who's holding on to us am I holding on let me let me just say this to you so many times we think I can't hold on anymore but we got to realize we're not the one holding on to start off with and when he comes by when he steps by on a certain day you'll never forget that day and you just want to capture the moment absorb everything a part of it how it feels what it sounds like like to hear the voice of the Lord echoing where did it come from did it come from inside of you or did you hear it audible all you know it was him you begin to follow him and you begin to watch even our messenger had to meet the angel of the Lord in a cave and God would give him his Commission of what he would do just like a Candlestick would be placed in the in a generation and he delivers the message that message comes down from the glory of God now it will go throughout the Earth and begin to deliver a message to a people I'm going to have a bride she'll be without spot or wrinkle come out of her my people and be not a partaker of her plagues and you're marrying Jesus Christ not the man William Brandon but you're marrying Jesus Christ before long you begin to realize realiz that God is developing a a picture a picture of what he thought of before the foundation of the world and you're a part of it the mystery of Jesus Christ The Mystery of it was you that's the real mystery that's the hidden secret that he held inside of himself was you was on his mind or let me just say this you Satan would have never took his life because you are raised to torment his kingdom now you're here and God's at work with you none of us are finished but God's taking his master brush sister Connie is's taking his master brush and he's brushing one day at a time let me let me just say this to you sometimes we don't we don't understand what to the reason today HS but God's got a greater purpose in your life he's got a greater purpose and I want you to understand that you are God's crowning achievement he he built all the animals to fellowship with but he couldn't have a level of Fellowship like he's having with you right now so he'll come maybe to your bedroom to your work site he'll come in a service and there may be hundreds of people sitting in the service but he'll make it so personal it'll feel like he's talking to you he begins to describe to you that that your your identification is not from your mom and dad it's not from the history of your your family tree that was your fleshly DNA but he's got a a a Higher Achievement that he wants for you he's got a bigger plan if we could look at it when we're talking about Ruth in the field God had a bigger plan yet at the time it seemed like that she was living in chaos can I just describe to you a little bit about this there was two men on the road to EMAs these two men had been disciples with Jesus they're walking away and as they're walking away from where they should have been headed to they were in a dilemma Jesus who they had called God had had been hung on a tree had been placed in a tomb and they didn't hang him with dignity they hang him naked and they heard the words no doubt that he forgave his persecutors he prayed for them he did just only just only a day before they had beaten him until he was unrecognizable as a human B it only seemed just a like short time ago that they had sat with him and they'd watched him they'd watched him have the last communion they'd watched all of the things take place they' they'd seen him right off of the Hill off of a donkey now they just can't put it all together you know sometimes that's the way we feel I just can't get it all together I I I just can't I just don't understand everything the world's Fallen apart politics has fell apart Sodom and gomorra is worse than I ever thought it would be the news is not worth listening to you get depressed just just reading down through and how much worse can it be what they're doing to our children we don't have a choice anymore we rode through a neighborhood last week and there was a sign said we've already got your children I want to tell them they don't have our children they don't have our children and neither are they going to get our children brother brandom is speaking in modern events that are made clear by prophecy he comes to an interesting point and I think this is incredible he said he said let's just listen to the words talking about Jesus quoting with them after he joins them he said let's just listen to the words that he quoted I like these next words he says would you like to hear what he said to them' amen would you like to hear what he said to them I I would like to say yes yes I would here brother brandham it's one thing for him to talk take you back to the Garden of Eden and tell you what Eve look like and then then maybe standing in a prayer line Look Back 40 years in your life and you know that's God not the man and now God's going to allow that to look back to walk on a road with with those two boys on the road to Emmas and going home discouraged and now he's not just going to talk to those two guys he wants to talk to you as well and he said uh they were all briefed on The Late happenings of of the crucifixion of the story of the grave and the tomb and he said they were and the women that had seen him and another one said they seen him and so course and they were all briefed on that and he goes right on with the word about that and he begins to quote himself in the word he says now now let's look at Zachariah chap 12 he must have quoted Zechariah 11 and 12 for he was so for 30 pieces of silver was not the Messiah was not the Messiah supposed to be sold for 30 pieces of silver in in Psalms 41 and verse 9 he was betrayed by his friends see Zachariah 13 verse 7 he was forsaken by his disciples he's taken him a journey through the word Psalms 35 and verse 11 he was accused by false Witnesses Isaiah as he begins to say this he was dumb before his accusers and he never opened his mouth Isaiah 50 and verse 6 he was scourged no doubt their mind were now beginning to pick some things up Psalms 22 and verse 22 he cried at the cross my God why hast Thou forsaken me all my bones stare at me they pierce my hands and my feet look at the prophecies that he could talk about Isaiah 9 and6 unto us a child is born a virgin shall conceive and so forth Psalms 22 and8 they parted the garments among them Isaiah 7 and verse4 a virgin shall conceive Psalms 22 and verse 7 and 8 they made made a mockery by his enemies and supposed to be by his friends Psalms 22 again not a bone was broken but they pierced his hands and his feet Isaiah 53 he died with malf factors Isaiah 53 and9 he was bruised and buried with Rich Brothers in psalm 16 and verse 10 he was resurrected from the dead and David said I will not suffer M Holy One to seek corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell and he was raised from the dead Malachi chapter 3 John the Baptist was the Forerunner all the types that he might have went through too even to Isaac being a type of him upon a mountain upon a mountain where his father Abraham took him in Genesis chapter 22 and it was now that they begin to see who had fulfilled these scriptures that was promised of that day it was then after it was late begin to see oh well wait a minute you know they they then then know that the crucifixion friend Jesus was the prophet was promised they knew because see they they hadn't been briefed on the scriptures but here all of these things that were supposed to happen at the cross and all of these these things fools slow of heart to understand all the prophets have said and how that the Messiah shall suffer and inter into his glory and raise him the third day but still they don't recognize it I think sometimes we don't recognize Jesus as walking with us and they've had him with them all day six hours he stepped From Another Dimension I'd like to just pause here just for a moment how must God must fear in that God Realm in that other realm looking into our feeble humanity and doing his best to help us I want you to think about that in the busyness of all of this universe he takes the time to come and spend a little time for these guys it was 6 hours in an afternoon but I want you to just notice and if I can just capture this for a moment in their Journey walking away discouraged and despondent headed in the wrong direction God didn't give up on them in your journey maybe headed in the opposite direction your world falling apart and you're walking and you're disillusion and you're in a dilemma God don't give up on [Music] you now these boys couldn't recognize who the guy was with them though they had heard him preach for maybe three years they had seen incredible signs and wonders but now in that realm of Eternity stepped into this realm of time being God now he wants to help his children because it's more than just about your natural Journey he knows where he's got to get you all you with me these boys wasn't going to stay discouraged but at the end of the day they invited him in and even constrained him come in and have some bread with us it's getting late and they invited him in and when he begin to break the bread they recognized who he was then their eyes was open and when your eyes come open to who's been walking with you let me just say it's very difficult to look forward and see the will of God but it's easy to look back and see that you've been walking in the will of God all the time it's easy to look back and see those prints and there's only two prints in the sand where there should have been four and he reminds you I've been carrying you I can say the last three years he's been carrying me sometimes we have to come to a spot where these boys would come to to see yourself as God sees you if not we'll become Catholic and Catholics will beat they'll never be worthy they'll always be doing pentant they'll always not be doing enough but being Believers you're adopted into the family of God as Sons and Daughters of God and now God begins to walk with you and talk with you and it's a daily Journey never forget to pray never get too busy to pray never get too busy to fellowship with God are you with me brother Brandon would use this statement he said my Ministry is to declare that he is here and if he is here our Prophet may have had to leave but his job was done many of our loved ones had to leave because but they didn't die without faith looking for the Rapture but we are here in our journey and God has a purpose for us to be here the scripture says that we which are alive and remain so we've got a purpose in our life are you with me now could we realize just for a moment that we are in the season of rapture I asked you last week do you now believe how many remember that that sermon and I I spoke to you about when Lazarus was laying in the Tomb and and Jesus asked Martha and Mary to to roll away the stone and when they really come to the spot of their life to where that they now identified so with him is when they put their hands on it all the critics could was against Jesus but now the critics was against them as well it's when when you identify yourself with the word then the critic comes your way now we're in a season to where that we realize that it must be the angels of God holding back bombs even against the United States but they're they're they're holding them back waiting for us to to to go home but can you imagine when Noah was here the critics was all around the ark and they were all around the ark and even till the very last day criticizing Noah even to when that they were locked up inside of the door and no doubt the critics were still there but let me just say this you once it begin to rain once the bills begin to open up everybody became a believer everybody criticized Jesus critics at every meeting critics that was there even at his crucifixion but that didn't stop there can you now imagine the difficulty of saying that you saw Jesus alive and well now the road to emus these boys experienced Jesus being with them but now go tell your neighbor sure you did but I'll tell you he took me all the way through the scriptures and this Jesus was the Messiah the difficulty to get the critic to believe now you're experience with God lined up with the word you realize that you're walking in sacred moments I want to take it a step further we've heard the message of the hour we're more than a church we're more than a body of Believers around the world but two worlds are coming together not only is Sodom coming but Heaven is coming too what we experience in services like this around the world it's God coming in our midst in a supernatural way confirming his word over and over and over and over again and you feel it sweep from the front to the back sometimes you see a cloud sometimes maybe a pillar of fire and you just witness that's him and whether you get a sensation or emotion whatsoever you take him at his word and you see the change in your life you couldn't make that that change well brother Ron I can do better I I can make a change in my life okay January one you'll probably start a diet January 5 you'll eat a donut enough said but we realize that it's really not you but it's what God deposited in you and that which he deposited in you is God himself self so sister Chassy we're not looking at our outward man we're not looking at our weaknesses we're not looking at our frailties we're not even looking at our own excuses if we could see what God sees on the inside of [Applause] us oh brother Ron is it you well if it's not me then who if it's not now then when God's going to have a br I just choose to believe that I'm part of [Applause] it well brother Ron but but the difficulties I go through brother Charlie that's sitting in a wheelchair been in a wheelchair since in his 50s but God's been with him this whole time you can choose to have the right attitude whatever you're going through I could choose to crawl up in a cave and suffer from depression the rest of my life because of the death sentence by by doctors and what everybody else thinks but let me just say this you I choose to God's word so I refuse to focus on what's in the mirror I focus on the word of God h and [Applause] I come on church do you think there's not days where I feel like I can't get out of bed I just start throwing one foot over top of the other and say this is the day that the Lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it if God has called us to do a work let's do the work let's respond to the attack of the enemy we are commissioned to take the word of God and speak it across our lips whether you're a preacher whether you're a singer whether you sit in the back of the building listen when you go on your knees you shake the kingdom of Hell there's not a more powerful people than you on the Earth but Satan knows what you're capable of he just hopes you don't know what you're capable of can I preach to you in this Darkness God chose you to live you turn to your neighbor and say God chose you thank you Lord thank you Lord he chose you now God's infinite in his mind it don't make mistakes he don't he Don't Make Junk so quit putting yourself down quit living a life of regret sister Connie will eat a meal and she said I wish I had eat all that don't live a life of regret you enjoyed those potatoes enjoy it walk it off baby walk it [Applause] off if I die this afternoon you send flowers so we realize that we're not here to live a a whiny right feel sorry for me I'm the only one going through this how does brother juel say it wowy wowy I say it again you did good wowy wowy woo and he would say it have that old M face why don't you smile brighten up your face a little bit let me just say this you if you're worried about wrinkles smile it takes more muscles in your face to frown if you look at your pictures and you never show your teeth learn to smile realize today that we are his victory so he called you in this day to be the victory over top of the enemy he will anoint you for the challenge of the day we're not waiting on another generation to come he's got you on the scene are you with me now I want to ask you do you now believe we are his victory we will see the resurrection now I want you to think just for a minute Resurrection happens your loved ones walk through these doors or walk up to your house now go tell your neighbor what your neighbor going to say are you with me not everybody's going to be on the same page but they are going to be a signed to you in about 40 days we're going to see Jesus you think you're hearing noise now just wait till you start stepping into these dimensions just wait till you start stepping into these Dimensions the enemy that's tormenting you knows he's only got a couple days left to work on you you'll take a half a step that way and they'll take a half a step this way still here we'll be singing and dancing rejoicing around because this word is more than words on a page or on a on a tape recorder but now we're living it there came a time when Sarah and Abraham was listening to a baby cry they wasn't looking for the vision to be fulfilled no more they were living in it let me just say we're walking into it we're stepping into it sir there's a season that's going on here it's when God taking his great paintbrush and he's painting all the trees it's going to be beautiful here in a few weeks millions of people will come through our Valley to see our our trees we didn't do anything to make it happen it was God that painted all that it's God that did all of that work are you with me it's because we're entering into a season what's going on in the bride today around the world is we're entering into a season our expectation is a higher level it's stepping into a realm to where that we can see what God has said that we were going to fulfill notice brother brm said the hour is here if I'd have been back there before the days of that the world was created and looked down and seen the whole thing and the father had said to me what day would you want to live I would say now I would say right now this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom that's how special you are he said as I said God is like a great big contractor he lays out all the material on the earth and then he builds his buildings and remember before there was a grain of the seed on the earth before there was a sun that ever struck the Earth your body was laying on the earth cause you are the dust of the earth God is a great contractor am I could stop there for a little bit if you could just start appreciating how God built you made you it's pretty incredible he made your hands and all that you can do with your hands the sensories that he give you he made your eyes and just a glimpse you can have incredible amount of information he made your nose to where that you can smell good and bad Maj your senses of your taste to where you could enjoy food he made you with emotions to where you could fall in love I was just on the lake of of up near Elk Ridge wasas Su angland Lake angland Lake's what I'm looking for I got up early in the morning morning and I was walking and I'd felt rough through the night and so I got up and I just began to walk and it was just like heaven you couldn't hear any couldn't hear any road noise you couldn't hear planes going across leaves were turning yellow and they got a lot of yellow leaves there I walk right up on a great big old buck and I just stood there about from here to that tree and he just looked at me and he just stood there for a while and I took some pictures of him and he started eating and I started just kind of walking by him he wasn't scared of me and I thought for after a little while one of these days I'm going to walk and I may see you again now day I'm going to walk up and hug your neck and I'm going to hold you and maybe look at your horns I may walk down a little bit further and be a great big old lion there he you know he's not going to be scared of me then and and I'm not going to be scared of him and I'm going to walk over and rub his man a little while and he's just going to Pur for me he's not going to be a meat eater no longer he's not going to want to eat me I'm too bony now he he's going to want to eat some grass in that Dimension I began to walk and I I walk down to the to a dock and I walk out on the dock and and was two there was a male and a female duck there malards he was just kept kept ducking in the water and ducking in the water and she was ducking in the water ducking in it didn't know time even existed few days they'll they'll fly south and I stood there and I begin to lift my hands and begin to Worship the Lord and begin to pray begin to thank him for what I'm thinking on this morning you've been with me in the journey you've been with me as I've walked through this journey and I never want to come to the place to where I forget it wasn't my human energies that have got me here but it's God that has been with me all the way some would say it's a new lease on life I just say this you God was rich in Mercy I came across this the other day and I'll just share a couple of things about it I was studying and I was looking in some notes and I found this Andrew had shared it with me years ago one day Thomas Edison came home and gave a paper to his mother and he told her my teacher gave me this paper and told me to only give it to just to my mother his mother's eyes filled were tearful as she read the letter out loud to her child your son is a genius this school is too small for him and doesn't have enough good teachers for training him please teach him yourself after many many years after Edison's mother died and he is now one of the greatest inventors of the century one day he was looking through old family things and suddenly he saw a folded paper in the corner of the drawer of the desk and he took it in open it and on the paper was written your son is adult he's mentally ill we won't let him come to school anymore I want you to just think the Genius of the century the school thought he was mentally ill but there was a mother that thought he was a genius I'd like to say I'm thankful to God that what people wanted to turn down God looked at you and saw something much different than yourself I shared that that little story with my family on on our our our family chat and then I shared it on a Minister's chat I thought the timing was perfect at the very moment that I shared it brother Danny steeman was touring the home of Thomas Edison he was walking through the museum in Fort Meers when sometimes you think think oh you're just having a normal day you're actually orchestrated by almighty God a man would walk up before brother brandom and say these words speaking in tongues and it would be three in French interpreters and called it perfect French because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked in your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision that that thou Hast made this in itself that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine you've heard that over and over again but I'm going to tell you this I worked for 11 years making nitroglycerin and I read this poem every day because I had it on my locker and people would walk by and say does that mean something to you I said absolutely I'm on a journey and I would think in my heart I won't always be making nitroglycerin amen so where you're at in your journey may not look good for now but just stick around keep walking the scripture says in Romans chapter 8 and verse 28 and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified now let me just say this you God chose you when you couldn't Choose Yourself God elected you when you couldn't elect yourself the scripture also said that he called you and with an eternal calling he can't lose you the scripture says he's already Justified you and we realize there may be a lot of stuff against you in your life and you may have a lot of it in your memory book and Satan only uses your memory channel to confuse you war with [Music] you how many humans do we have in the building today how many of you does the enemy remind you of yesterday days failures 10 years ago failures Hallelujah looks like about 100% of you yeah well you know why he does that cuz he's built to be the accuser of the Brethren but if you could see what God sees he don't see it so if you could begin to look back at your past the way God looks at your past you never did it to begin with now I want to read you a very familiar portion of scripture after that is settled what shall we then say to these things I want you to read it if God be us who can be against us let's do it again it's Sunday morning if God be for us who can be against us don't waste a minute don't waste 10 minutes don't waste a day on your accuser he's bringing up stuff that God don't even hold against you but you hold it against yourself I was counseling with a man and woman one time and they were constantly bringing up old girlfriends and old boyfriends and they were they were they're not here and they were just always makes it nicer doesn't it who who is it who is it in the church who is it and they was constantly and I said are you guys Christians yeah don't you realize that God forgives you yes yes don't you realize that God justifies this as though you never did in the first place can't you see yourself as God sees you quit Digging Up Bones that's right quit Digging Up Bones then quit Digging Up Bones about yourself what do I do then enjoy life let's say it again if God be for us who can be against us amen hallelujah don't you love it brother B said I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is is now ready to go into action I believe God has been selecting his soldiers I be I believe he's dressing them he's training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start he was talking about you so God didn't bring you here to press against the darkness to see you lose Lo did everybody get that God didn't predestinate you he didn't bring you to the Earth he didn't preserve your natural seed through all of these Generations just to bring you to this point for you to go I quit I quit I'm taking my coat off I I quit I'm giving up it's too hard a battle for me sure it is for you I was actually hot's the reason I took the jacket off but if you only look at you you'll quit every day but if you keep your eyes on the word are you with me you've heard me say these words to you refuse to retreat [Applause] never never never never give up the song says Onward Christian Soldiers are you with me now year of God little children have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world think about that just for a moment now God's words are Eternal his weapons are eternal the weapons of his Warfare will never fail you heard that last night so you have the power to bind and to loose you are commissioned to speak not just speak with your Authority but speak with the authority of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I want to remind you there's no higher authority than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth Earth I'll loosen Heaven Help Me preach so stop complaining stop whining refuse to give Satan any Voice through your lips think Victory talk victory walk Victory never give up I want you to say these words with me refuse to give Satan voice think victory victory talk Victory talk victory walk victory walk Victory never give up never give up did you hear yourself say it I want you to remind remind you of something here the reason that we sing and we come and sing is sometimes we come from the Walmarts of life we come from different difficulties of life we walk into church the song leader gets up and he begins to sing you know you can just sit there and put your hands in your pocket and say all right sing a song that I like I don't like them new song sing an old song and you know sing a song that I like and I I just want to be entertained this morning well that's not the point you fail to realize the point the song leader gets inspired to sing certain songs he prays about it he gets himself ready the musicians get ready we're set in an atmosphere to bring us from the world and now we begin to sing songs across our lips sing it loud enough to where your heart can hear it as well victory is mine victory is mine Satan your Kingdom's coming down I say Satan your Kingdom's coming down I Heard a Voice from Heaven say Satan your Kingdom's coming down and you begin to sing your testimony Satan I'm going to bring your kingdom down and maybe you got out of the car and you and your wife was having a tiff Tiff can you say Tiff as a polite way to say it you get out and you slam the door of your car and don't realize that Jesus has been walking with you but he'll get you through it and you get into the house of the Lord and you're there and now you need that song leader do a little singing and maybe just for you he sings Oh How I Love Jesus Oh How I Love Jesus turn to your neighbor and say oh how I love Jesus because he first loved then our singers begin to sing and they sing from their heart they prayed about the songs that they're going to sing what you don't realize is we're at War here we're a lighthouse set up on this hill and we're keeping the flame hot why do I have to praise the Lord you got to keep the flame hot now in a few days I want to remind you it's going to get cold around here rain's going to turn to ice and ice is going to turn to snow and so in some of your houses you got a stove and that stove is created to to make heat I was a chimney sweep for many many years and so what you do is you you put it in and you get it built just right you light the fire now if you don't light the fire you can stand there all day long that's what a lot of people do in church they don't like to Fire and they go out colder than they walked in but you got to like to fly I'm preaching to you where you know it or not I'm preaching to you at my house you see I was beginning to get weaker and weaker and I fight weakness because of the chemo and I asked Brother David I said what did you do he got out of the wheelchair what did you do to strengthen your body up he said well I cut wood well I thought well if that work for him bless God and I said Lord I ain't strong enough to roll logs together but Lord I I need the answers of how to do it so I had a dream roll three great big logs together take your skids steer and put logs laying this way and then cut one at a time and then roll them over and split them I got a I got a wood pile Hallelujah ain't that right Sister Barbara Drives By it every day I got a wood pile cuz I wanted strength it didn't work that well but I got a wood pile now let me just say I can leave it laying out there or I can bring it to the house of God and I can roll it in I got myself a big roller cart and I can roll that baby right up in my house I got a ramp I can roll it right up in my house are you expecting a cold winter I don't know weather men are 177% right don't believe them but when it gets cold I'm [Music] prepared I'm prepared now it takes a little work but it pays off when you're sitting over in that Lazy Boy with BL Blondie and you sitting on two seats sitting over there with Blondie and enjoying that fire as it glows and enjoying the [Applause] hate now a lot of people don't understand on the internet of what we do here we enjoy the benefit of the liberty of the word of God and so we come to church and you got to get in the spirit we're not here to be entertained it's everybody at all hands on deck if you're the amener be the best a maner if you're the hand clapper be the best hand clapper if you're the singer every one of us are the singers be the best singer that you can be then you can get warmed by the fire brother Ron I don't like all that emotion well if you was laying in the mor you'd like to have [Music] some Hallelujah now I want you to just think just for a moment and I want to take you through a journey is this all right I've kind of be and bopped a little bit but I want to take you through a journey I stood with David iers in Belgium and he took me to an old castle and you know those old castles they look haunted and there's a reason for it this particular Castle was had held prisoners of Believers and there they would torment those Believers and at the end of their Journey they had a huge hole that went down into a cave that went to the to a river that carried out to the ocean and they would slay those Believers one by one it was Untold the tens of thousands of Believers that went into that hole in Belgium I think about their journey and that's the way that it wound up but I want to tell you what you couldn't see was Jesus was right there with every one of them I was standing with brother George Quinn who will be here in a few weeks and he wanted to take me to Columbus house where Columba lived and it was out in a pasture field overlooking a huge uh Township down there and Columbo would would pray through the night and as Columbo would pray he'd be a church age Messenger as he would pray people came to witness the pillar of fire as it shined Through the Keyhole and they would come and it was over it was literally hundreds of people would come to see that Pillar of Fire Glow out through that Keyhole the next morning wasn't a luxurious house it was you couldn't set that piano in it had a place it was a rock ledge where they laid skins and and blankets there to where that he slept on but in the morning he would come out and he would stand on the side of that hill on a on a certain Rock the Irish are very superstitious and he would stand on that certain Rock and he would preach to the gospel and people would gather at the bottom and hear Columba preach Hallelujah let me just remind you of how powerful that he was he cursed the snakes off of Ireland he cursed the snakes off of Ireland because they were infested and there's not a snake there today these are powerful men that God allowed to Live Through the Ages there was a man that we know much of finny brother Brandon would talk about him he said under he spoke under such inspiration he had been a lawyer and he he know he needed God he know he needed the Holy Ghost and and he was ashamed to get it he was ashamed of what people would think of him and one day he was down behind the office and he was down behind some bushes and he was praying and two women walked by and he stood up ashamed and he realized I'm ashamed of Jesus Christ I need this Holy Ghost where I'll never be ashamed and he went back and he be to pray and God filled him with the spirit of God let me just say in the season of his life in the moment of his journey he would preach with such power until men would walk down the road five miles away and give their heart to the Lord are you with me now the town of Rochester New York is where he was preaching at there was no crime policemen actually became barbershop quartets Jail's emptied I'll tell you that's what this nation needs we don't need a defund the police situation we don't need to tear down George Washington statue we need a Jesus to come on the scene with power and demonstration help it to live on this [Applause] hill man named Moody you by now you picked up what I'm doing I'm picking portions of people's lives a man named Moody shook the Earth won 500 souls to Jesus Christ he had a bad day because the town of Chicago burnt down one night the night before he had preached and said next week next week I'm going to have an Altra call but he put it off and after the fire burned everything up in Chicago he went to Europe and was so depressed and said I'll never preach again and while in while in Europe he was sitting in a barber shop and a man Was preparing to cut his hair and it was such an atmosphere on this man it literally changed the whole barber shop and they finally asked him what are you doing he said well I'm away from Chicago I've come here I'm not going to preach anymore one of those guys was pretty sharp he said well why don't you come down to our church and give us a testimony well asking a preacher to give you a testimony is asking the impossible situation it rekindled his fire amen and he came back to America and shook America what did he do he decided I'm not going to live in depression no more and God reignited his life maybe you've heard of this man named Spurgeon Spurgeon is called The Prince of preachers but as a young man he didn't know whether he wanted to serve God or not serve God and he was walking down the street with his friend and lightning struck his friend and killed him that day he decided the rest of my life is to serve God what are you saying all these for don't set on your laurels serve god with everything that is within you can I just go quickly John Wesley's preached 88,000 sermons and he rode by horseback not by airplane but by horseback William carry translated 42 versions of the Bible 42 languages of the Bible not only that he translated dictionaries how much time did he have whatever time he had he he spent it for God Peter cartright which you'll be very familiar with actually preached here in this area brother Brenham talks about him talks about him in an interesting sterman called the greatest battle that's ever fought I'll save this I'll save the rest for next time but Peter cartright was a man that that he was a no good for a long time in his life but finally Peter cartr met God Peter carite had such passion in his life to which that he had went into a town and brother Brandon will mention the story that there was a building that was there it was an old church that was no longer being used so he just went in and started cleaning the windows and cleaning the cobwebs and a bully walks in he happened to be the sheriff of the town and said there can't be no meeting here there can't be a meeting here until you first whip me Peter cartright got down off of his ladder and he said well if that's what's next he rolled his sleeves up and he whipped the town bully what you don't realize is that man became the pastor of the church Hallelujah Peter cartright was preaching in a meeting one night and there about 300 people there masses had gathered and some guys walked in and they was going to disrupt the service for him 30 of them nobody else felt challenged to fight so he walked right down and he be to fight you liked him brother Shannon he walked right down and he whipped one by one until 30 men were whipped brother Bisal said he came from the south they came back to service on Sunday morning and none of the men after that cassus had took place none of them felt led to preach he said I'll preach but he had been the man that whipped all those men but I'll preach and he preached a sermon called the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail and when he got done the power of God fell and they worshiped all all day Sunday and all night Sunday night and all day Monday and all night Monday night and all day Tuesday and all day Tuesday night and on Wednesday they baptized 300 [Applause] people you've said a lot right here brother Ron let me just say this to you you may have be in a lot of issues in your life but but if Jesus is walking with you whether it's on the road to Aus or meeting you in a cave or whatever your situation is if you've got him walking with you and God is looking from his realm and you're walking in this realm and can begin to see what God wants to do in your life you've got a journey with the King Hallelujah Peter cartright was a journey with the King John Wesley preaching 88,000 sermons was a journey with the king that's right however long you've been alive you've been on a journey with the king I want to ask you one question what will you be remembered for amen what will you be remembered for I spent about a half an hour and it seemed like an exercise in futility for a minute but I talked about John Wesley and what he's remembered for and what Peter cartright's remembered for and we could talk about the Hebrew children what they're remembered for but what will you be remembered for and I close with this I don't want to be remembered for a man that suffered with cancer but I want to be remembered for a man that when he met cancer he wasn't defeated by it he called you to meet the challenge of the hour whatever challenge that you're facing even today whether it's big or it's small because every one of us look at things different what one will look at something that's very small others will look like at it's Giants but God is with you in whatever difficulty you're facing let's give the Lord a hand let's stand to our feet this morning if you guys could sing could you sing that song One More Time wouldn't he whne he before they come I I want to just ask you we walk into a building and we don't know what one another's facing that's right we really don't really don't know we don't really know what's coming up we don't know the situations that we'll go through don't take a day for granted that's right someone asked me the other day said run what have you learned in this three and 1 half hour Journey three and a half year journey and I shared it with them I want to share it with you today I have found out what's really important and there's a lot of stuff that's not important are you with me there a lot of stuff that's not important God's number one number one my family spending time with my family you said well brother Ron you've got cancer but you may go before I do that's right I just have a name to mine you may go we may go this afternoon don't waste a day don't waste a day don't waste a service am those boys were discouraged as they walked up that hill they were leaving town
