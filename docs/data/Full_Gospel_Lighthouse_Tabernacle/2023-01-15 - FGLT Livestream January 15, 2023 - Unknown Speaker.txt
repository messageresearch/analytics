tells you your cancer free if I can just explain it to you doctors have to give account to insurance companies they have to give account to their own boards and for them to declare you cancer free is a major deal and so we're so thankful brother Joe has has he's 87 years old going on 18. and we're just so thankful and we we could the doctors can declare that he's cancer-free and we're so thankful for that and isn't God so good we want to continue to remember brother Roger and Sister Anne do I know yeah yeah let's do that play something sister Cassie [Music] foreign [Music] we want to continue

plans are to go and sister Linda if you're watching our plans are to come by your house a little bit later and and pray pray there also Sister Crystal mentioned a request last night her boss dancing but we are so we want to pray amen I had a special visit this morning I wasn't going to tell it but I'll tell it now yeah it was about four o'clock this morning for ish I went to the washroom and when I came back the side of my bed I felt somebody there and I turned and it was Natalie [Music] I never saw her look that beautiful she was so healthy her teeth shined white as ivory her hair was just so beautiful I knew her as a girl she was Connie's best friend and she had the most beautiful gown on I'd ever seen and uh Natalie was a girl that had hair on her arms as I looked at her arms the hair was there and she was young her hands were just so soft I'm just going to be honest I just told her how sorry I was that life had been so rough on her and so cruel cancer she endured a horrible relationship of a marriage and I just told her I was sorry and I told her that I had did my best for Connie she always had a certain way that she said silly and she just looked at me and she said you're so silly because in that Realm all those bad relationships and cancer didn't mean nothing and after a moment she looked over my shoulder and saw Connie laying in bed asleep and she just said she's so beautiful now I want you to understand I will never come to this pulpit and embellish a story I'm too close to going to heaven and she said I've got to go now but I'll see you soon what a realm that we live in what around no I didn't go back to bed no I didn't go back to bed I was deeply affected by that we walk in a mortal realm and an Immortal Realm and it's closer than you think we want to remember brother Bill this morning that God would touch him and be with him brother Marcus back here most of you know the story that I met brother Marcus on a plane and he didn't remember me but I met him on a plane over 20 years ago before I ever came here and I've been here 20. 22 23 years now and they had a friend with him and his friend talked to me the whole flight he talked to me the whole flight and brother Marcus at the end of it his friend asked me what are you doing I said well I'm a preacher he said what do you preach I said I preached the message of William Branham now this is important today more than ever before and Marcus spoke up and he said I was raised in the message I know all the stories and he just clicked a couple stories off so that he knew that so that I knew that he knew the message and he said life he said I've made some bad failures whether you know it or not I I told that story all over the world looking for Marcus I didn't know him by name I didn't know where he lived we was in an airplane when we got off the airplane everybody goes their separate ways and I tell that story looking for him we were sitting at the fellowship hall having dinner with his family and I was sitting beside her brother Marcus and the Lord spoke to me and he said the man on the airplane is sitting beside of you you got to learn to trust that voice it's not wrong and I turned to Marcus and I said we've we've met before and he said no we've never met before I said yeah we met on a plane and I began to tell him the story and I'll never forget the expression of hero he would we've come to 20 some years full circle and God cared so much for him that's not what God does he cares so much for you he said in here in the service now and just before service started he gets a call from the man's daughter he's had a heart attack and died this morning just think about just think about I walked in the restroom and I said God I don't have words you're going to have to help me and he just spoke to me and he said remind him where he's standing when brother Marcus walked into my office I said I don't have the words to tell you but I want to tell you God spoke to me and said look where you're standing at you may have had a lot of failures in your life but look where you're standing right now thank you Satan may have did everything that he can to destroy you but look where you're standing right now brother Marcus this week got to witness to that man about his faith and that man said I'm going to trust your faith so this morning we want to remember that family you know I think of all the things in the world there's not enough odds to put us all together in this building under the circumstances to gather us together there's another Power the mind of God that draws us together and puts us in this place what he's doing in time is only reflecting what he's done in eternity and so we we the we count these moments of very very precious and so Amen brother Marcus please let that family know and your family know that we're praying amen praying let's stand to our feet this morning I'm deeply humbled by the video it lets us know and I just want to to just kind of give you a signpost here it lets us know that brother Branham said given enough time they'd write a book of Acts behind us and so we realize when these things are coming forward we didn't do these things God did it and so if I can just say this humbly before you it's been God every step of the way every step of the way and so as I fight this dreaded disease I heard last night heard it two different ways last night that I was going to be free and that I was going to walk a thousand a thousand years with brother Isaac and and so we just are we're just thankful for that deeply humbled but it's all God it's all God so let's pray this morning and and I want you to pray for Brother Bill and sister Linda brother Randy that God would just come on the scene for them and brother Marcus's friend Heavenly Father we bow our heads before you now there's some events that just take our breath this day's been already special for me [Music] Lord Jesus I just ask you that Lord now you would come and touch brother Bill where he's at anoint doctors to help him no man knows the day or the hour that will leave the Earth but I thank God that there's a land beyond the river this is just a temporary house where we live at but Jesus you said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also if I live a hundred years of misery and woe and I've lived it for Jesus and at the end of it I get eternal life [Music] these silly things in life as Natalie spoke don't be silly these silly little frustrations that we have to deal with these light afflictions that we have to fight with in this life it'll be worth it after all Lord I ask you to touch brother Bill and sister Linda brother Randy that's getting ready to go through his own treatment Lord you see brother Marcus his friend no way we can explain in the mind of God Marcus sitting in this building now 20 some years later God you knew where he was at all the time but he would be sitting in this building when he would get the call that his friend went home now I ask you to comfort that family and strengthen them now as we turn our heart toward the word we too have needs I have a need that you would strengthen us I have a need that you would give us help here even as I stand in this pulpit I pray that you would stretch your arms out over this audience just now you see every need you see every situation [Music] Lord I I just ask you that you would do a work today Lord let us get ourselves out of the way dear God bless your children anoint them you see sister Erica that's in there it she struggles so hard Lord I ask you that The Healing Hands would go by her way place your hands in the hand of her father Lord not just her Earthly father or her heavenly father and God you know how to heal our bodies in a moment you can go by and touch her and deliver her and set her free come touch us today Lord how many more services do we have sometimes we wonder how can it get any better and just that next one it gets better now you're God today and I ask you that you would anoint us and bring my mind back into Focus Lord if there's any gift that I would have Lord let us get ourself out of the way but may that not be just for the preacher but may that be for this audience help us today root over our lives we pray Jesus Christ's name we pray amenity man isn't he good to us amen today I want to speak to you and I want to just kind of turn a corner from last week I thought last night was a great was a great service I'd like to thank brother Isaac and sister Bethany for coming she's about to have a birthday the 22nd she's born on my mother's birthday and for those that don't know sister Bethany is with child and they've already it's going to be a boy and they're going to call it Spencer Warren amen I'm honored I'm honored at that we've had great times together we've been we've been honored to be with their families I sure love Brother Ray I sure love brother Wayne with all of my hearts and so amen we want to pray for them today they're in a special day as well amen I want to read with you Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. and I know this is familiar and I know we've already prayed but I want us to pray this together this morning Jesus prayed this amen sorry that we've taken a little time to get started but but we'll get we'll get done amen after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen you can be seated Once you turn to your neighbor and said let's have church brother Brandon said this and I think this is one of the most powerful statements he said prayer is the key that's the answer you may have a ton of questions here this morning but prayer is the key Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings notice these next words there's not an atomic bomb or a hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God I want to just remind you I was with brother Doug Baker and he was explaining the power of an atomic bomb it has the power to cover one bomb has the power to destroy 600 circular miles can you imagine the destruction that will happen here when they're talking about nuclear bombs of how that it will what they've got at the capacity well they don't have nothing compared to what the Believers that are setting in this building house because you have direct communication with God that created it all in first Chronicles chapter 29 and verse 10 wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and David blessed and David said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel Our Father forever and ever thine O Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom O Lord and thou art exalted as head above it I want to remind you of who you are you're his wife you're the Queen of Heaven in Psalms 46 and verse 10 says be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him there's a couple keys that I want to drop to you today expect God to do what he said he would do he never tells us to do something that he can't back it up are you with me now the scripture says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover these signs shall follow them that believe in my name and so that's the authority that we use we have a sworn affidavit with God a believer is one who acts on the word of God can I just drop it to you one more time God never tells us to do anything that he's not able to back it up you see God asked Noah to build an ark he asked Noah to build an ark and then God flooded the Earth Moses stood there and cried and stretched his Rod out over the sea and God parted the waters Joshua marched around the walls of Jericho and God crushed those walls Elijah smote Waters Elijah smote the waters and God separated them Elisha threw a stick in the river and God made Iron to float Naaman dipped seven times in the water and God healed him of leprosy God just didn't bring you here to believe a message we got work to do sometimes we feel like we're on the defense all the time protecting our boundaries but let me just say sometimes it's time to turn and go on the offense sometimes it's time to put your sword in your hand and fight like never before he has commissioned us for a work God just didn't do bring us here just to see if he could do it God's got a purpose in every one of your life Israel sets today as a one of the littlest countries in the world but they got the greatest military it's not up for debate they got the greatest science that there is but they got the greatest god that there's ever been who has told them I'm on your side you're not going to lose I'm on your side but I want you to understand spiritual Israel sets in this building today you've got God on your side not some stinking rotten president you got God on your side and God said I'm going to see you through we've turned a new year maybe you've lost a lot of time focusing on somebody else or focusing his own personalities or or throwing rocks at each other maybe you wait being wallowed up and self-pity wallered up in Poor Pitiful men feeling sorry for yourself nobody loves me I want you to realize like Sarah set an attempt she had to realize I'm a part of the promise of God I can't put myself there but I can believe him and take him at his word I can't change my body to be able to have a child again but God that is talking to me he's made a promise with me you can't put yourself in the resurrection of the Rapture but this word will [Music] [Applause] we got work to do to overcome the darkness that is all around us darkness that is tried to destroy us darkness is trying to defeat us you know it's in darkness that people get turned around they get lost in the woods they get lost in the way a lot of crickets crawl in darkness if you the whole our all of our communities change in darkness it's the wickedness that comes out at night you think it looks bad in the day but it's the wickedness that comes out at night but you're in a wicked age and God ordained a special bride that would live in this age that would overcome this age God pre-planned us he pre-arranged us you heard last night two years before that boy died and hit by a by by a car and laid there dead two years before God pre-arranged foreign he had a resurrection waiting on them let me just say God has pre-arranged you he's got a he's got a Rapture he's got a body change Hallelujah we pray not my will thy will be done I have a I don't know who gave it to me and I thank you but I really don't know but anyway I gotta I got a thing that hangs on my wall God's writing the story don't take the pen out of his hand I think sometimes we decide oh God now everything's going good I can do it let me just say this to you you can't breathe without God so we've turned a year and we can see Russia's doing their thing the the Pope's doing his thing our Nations doing their thing they're becoming weaker so they can get destroyed but the word of God that is speaking to you is the author of the book not just a man but he's the author of the book and he's placed you in his plan you didn't put yourself there shamgar didn't put himself there Moses didn't put himself there Enoch didn't put himself there but God chose them to play a specific part in their lives and they would live an overcoming life that we would know their story even today throughout the eternities your story will be known as the people that overcame Lao to sail now I want to talk to you get out of your pity party quit feeling sorry for yourself pull your sword take the word of God let's finish this [Applause] Hallelujah brother Brown said how many times as you said in the seat with you how many times has he stood with you in the hours of your trials and troublesome and you didn't recognize it how many times at the wheel when you almost was killed in that accident or just dodged that accident or something and you didn't recognize it was him how that he was with you when the barrel was empty and the cruise was dry there was nothing for the babies and that man came to your door and set them groceries down at your door that was Christ he's alive today he's not dead but he lives excuse me brother Shannon and brother Greg was in a jeep some of you were there at the accident they were on their way home and to avoid an accident they begin to flip went over guard rails and I'll be honest with you every time I drive by it there's no safe place there to land when they quit moving they just got out God had just spared their life I was thanking God for sparing their life and just you know we could have had a funeral three days later I was said into my my chair and sister Connie was just right over from me and I was reading Christ The Mystery of God revealed and I came across this quote and I just sent him the quote brother Greg quote and brother Greg brother Shannon to quote I don't want to read it to you now he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the Psalms he was in history he's in the things to come he's the same yesterday today and forever he's Hebrews 13 and 8. if you're writing it down you he shouldn't be he said he should be the Principal if that's what he is and we believe it don't we then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life and if he's the principal theme of our life of the Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal thing of everything that we do say think should be Christ is that right and I read that and it just something sparked inside of me and I sent that to them and here's their words back I went back and looked this morning their words what brother Ron that's the last thing that I remember him saying just before the crash Give the Lord a good hand right there now for you that's doing odds on oh it's just by chance we have 1100 1200 sermons some of those sermons are four hours long and God spoke to me that quote don't you tell me we're alone angels are among us now I'm going on the offense so I've got to exercise it Isaac and Jenny we're in North Carolina while I'm preaching speaking on Psalms 91 Angels being Among Us the world has chaos we will too the world has tornadoes we will too the world has AK-47s pointed at it at 7 11. we will too but the difference is that we are are protected by the angels of God at the same time that that is being Spoken Here four hours down the road Isaac and Judy are in a car four boys roll up beside of them and roll an AK-47 out on them God rich in Mercy the difference is the word of God the seed of your life he is your protector I was preaching and I don't have a date I tried to find one earlier I was preaching again on Psalms 91. and right in the middle of the sermon I stopped and stepped right over there and I said I stop now and pronounce protection on our police officers before 12 o'clock brother Justin Klein a man rolls out on him and begins to shoot point blank Point black trying to kill him shot his car shot a mirror shot different things but not one bullet touched you brother Justin won't you stand right there so before you consider this fanaticism and before you start to start throwing your darts at us I want to remind you that God who created the heavens and the Earth is Among Us [Applause] brother Steve Thomas drove across railroad tracks not seeing brother Jeff would you stand in his dead not seeing the train coming and that train hit him and it actually made a tin can out of that that vehicle it destroyed it in every way that there is brother Steve climbed out with hardly a scratch and had his Bible in his hand [Music] and walked over to Sister Mary's house and said I've just been hit by a train she thought he was crazy but the conductor was down there looking for the dead body but an angel protected him as that thing rolled don't tell me God's not real we hear of stories like Georgia Carter laying in the bed over nine years hopeless case blind the blind man in Bombay the blind man in Mexico that dead baby that had been dead all day long and the doctors told her to go home and bury her body and she carried that dead baby to service that night made her way through all of the men that was trying to keep her from getting to where brother random was at and brother Brandon had a vision and let me just say this you God resurrected that baby we hear of these stories and maybe we let them just roll off we hear Brother random said I take every spirit in this building under my control I remember Sydney Jackson many years in Christiansburg said when he did that he said all those thousands of people and just people moving around makes noise he said dogs hushed the animals hushed it became a hush over that he said that gift which was more than a gift was God himself that gift had power not only over humanity and over spirits but over even nature let me just say brother Branham had to leave the scene it broke our hearts it shattered us I was at his funeral it was a horrible horrible time but God didn't leave us as a matter of fact the message got through the message that has been made fun of and the message that has went around the world I've carried it personally across borders could have been arrested and stayed there for life whether it was different places that I went carrying back in the day we carried tapes we carried all different kinds of materials so that people could get the message let me just say Satan's done everything that he can to stop us he said everything to try to stop you personally Warren in your mind because he don't have much time to work he was in your mind and worse in your flesh he worse in relationships you don't have to take a beat and give it back to him you say brother Ron but you're a good one to talk there you have cancer stage four don't you realize I I told the I told you over and over again I'm not going to whine I don't care how bad the day is I don't care how bad the headache was this morning I didn't walk in here and give you some pity party we're here to fight and we will fight until it's done we will fight until the rapture say my brother on sometimes my mind gets to a spot to where the devil talks he's talked to every prophet he talked to Jesus he's going to talk to you so don't go get yourself in some perplexity well the devil's talking to me well he's supposed to he's good at his job he's really good at this job but you're really good at yours [Applause] come on I want to talk to you I want to preach positive to you you're really good at your job God bypass millions and chose you because he knew you'd be good at your job Hallelujah he knew that he put something down on the inside of you you would not quit foreign sometimes you doubt yourself sometimes the devil tells you you're not good enough nobody loves you even you can't understand the trial that you're in you can't understand the spirit that has all sudden come in your home you went to bed in a very good mood you woke up what happened it's a spirit what makes young men act like old men they're young they got good muscles and they go around like they're just sold our spirit is God on them what it makes people color their hair all different kind of colors put things all over their body a spirit got on them what can make a person that is so great and has such a wonderful personality all of a sudden pull a gun a spirit gets on them there's a lot of prisoners set in prison today that were great people good citizens and just something clicked on the inside of them I'm not making an excuse for none of them but there is a fix you're having marriage trouble there's a fix there's a fix for you you're having job trouble there's a fix for you you put God first in everything in your home in your job in your life you get yourself in position to be blessed quit whining about what you ain't got and start thanking God for what you do have thank you come on Church buddies of buddies friends are friends jobs are jobs but God gave you a queen and gave you a king spend time with them amen oh my brother Ron you know we well you can go listen to brother Tim the other day I I said it too all of a sudden we get old we don't sleep in the same room no more we sat at a table and we text one another of getting up at 5 30 6 o'clock in the morning to take me to UVA my words are I never want to be a burden on you and she will quickly rebuke me I married you for better for worse it's not just you it's us but too many times people become selfish now I'm linking this both ways now don't think I'm just talking about your marriage I'm talking about God when you when you stop praising the Lord when you stop thanking him now let me preach to you just a little bit the Lord I'm not going to wait till I'm in some bed somewhere or another and wish that I would have did it don't tell me about your pity party how bad you got it why you got breath in your lungs why you got strength to wiggle your finger this is your time thank you Lord the reason people can't shake themselves because they're backslid and in the backslidden state you've lost your prayer you lost your desire to read your Bible and actually you can come and occupy a pew and the service doesn't even affect you too hot too cold somebody got my seat instead of being thankful that every soul brings us closer to rapture you're concerned somebody took your seat get over yourself [Applause] the scripture says if I'm okay if you abide in me in my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and itself this is a positive scripture too many times we just expect God to read our mind well I was praising the Lord people are in Revival and you're missing the point people said in brother brand was meeting side by side best friends one caught that that was Elijah and God was moving and God was going to have a bride the the fellow sitting right beside of him missed it just absolutely missed it didn't see nothing seed has a whole lot to do with that but neither do I want to come to service and Miss what God's doing in this day I don't want to sit here 40 years and feel like some entitled privileged child it's not what we used to do it's what you're doing now well brother Ron I'm old I'm gray-headed you're more dangerous than you were when you were young you have forgot something you still can pray amen I tried brother Meadows probably here don't remember what he had for breakfast yesterday but he's probably the best day manner we have in this building [Applause] give him a good hand brother Brown said now try hard Christians to understand that this day that the message has been placed in The Believer positionally if every believer in here was in the right place I'm so thankful where there was a whole row of wheelchair set there's only about two or three left in here if every believer knew their place a lady on a Cod a man on crutches along there that would be not one feeble person in the building in the next 20 minutes that's what kind of people that you are if every person if every man could only find simply find his place his or her in Christ Jesus what a difference it would make we were speaking a meeting in South Carolina large meeting probably about 1100 people that was there as I was preaching there was a man on crutches and he began to make his way and he could only take maybe one step at a time and he was making his way he was in the back of the building and he was making his way and it was just coming wasn't waiting on the prayer line wasn't waiting on an altar call wasn't waiting on laying hands on the sick he just was coming when he got right near the front he just throwed his scratches down and danced all the way back what about the blind eyes that have been opened what about the deaf ears that begin to heal what about the baby that was getting ready to be taken from the little mother's womb dead on Tuesday morning and that day they found heartbeat and they had a healthy baby I prayed this morning may God take these Barren wounds and put life on the inside of them why should we doubt why should we fail the scripture says them and you say well brother Ryan one day one day God will do that well I want to give you a scripture beloved now are we the sons of God and at death not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that's not good enough for you let me give you another year of God little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world say that with me greater is he that is in you Jehovah Jireh brother Brown says just recently a colored man in Shreveport stood up and said there's no such thing as God he's just blasphemed they're they're nothing but a bunch of Holy Rollers lightning killed him they took him to the Grave and when they was burying that man there come up a little cloud and lightning struck that casket and blowed him Plum out of the casket Jehovah God gets angry and I know he's a good God but he is a god of judgment too Hallelujah [Music] Jeremiah 33 or I'm getting warmed up I think I'm getting it somewhere Jeremiah 33 and verse 3 call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not John 15 and 7 if you abide in me in my words yes you've heard it before and and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you reading it again God don't necessarily need to read your mind he needs to hear you pray amen a lot of times we have not because we ask not my children sitting at the table they didn't just set their mom whenever it come time to eat they dug in and they ate now we did not feed Matthew more than we fed Andrew foreign but his DNA while he ate made him what he was I'm going somewhere with that all you got to do is come in this place and eat don't sit there and go well I don't like that and I don't like that and I don't like that and I don't like that and I don't like that and I don't like that I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I don't like that I don't like that I don't like that and I'm on a diet brother Ryan I'm on a diet I'm gonna die I'm not before nobody up let me just say this you your body tells us you have not been chasing green peas all over the plate [Applause] and as a pastor I can recognize whether you're in Revival or whether you've been lazy in prayer and you're backslidden in your spirit I can tell by your walk you've been talking to the Lord I can tell by your talk you've been talking to the Lord [Applause] Hallelujah you give me a permission and here we are Joshua 23 and verse 10 this was scripture and it was prophecy one man of you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God he is it that fighteth for you as he hath promised you as long as that was just a scripture or a sermon he just laid their dormant didn't do you no good but shamgar one day remembered that promise and the devil can't count he sent 600 people to his house and shamgar picked up a stick six foot sticks he was not a he was not a warrior [Music] but God was on his side and let me just tell you he didn't kill all 600 at one time one two three you know after you get the ten you get good at it you start fighting your battle you start saying God use me God speak to me God anoint me before long you'll get good at it and We Know shamgar by name because he took a scripture and made it live the church asked the authority in Jesus name in my name shall you cast out devils speak in new tongues and if they take up serpents or drink any deadly thing it'll not harm them they lay hands on the on the sick they shall recover that's his given of Authority the other day I was sitting with my eye oncologists and she was looking at me and she would just sit me through about three hours of test s he came in and she sat down with me she said I've read I've read I keep up with your story she said you've been going through it yeah you don't look like you got cancer no no she's not going to tell you something you had cancer in your eye when you came here but you ain't got it no more you can't make this stuff up folks you just can't make it up she said watch this and she went watch this you was here two years ago said watch this right there it was right there it was now let me show you today watch this let me show you today watch this I'm just about done let me show you today watch this let me show you today and she just kept going ain't this fun she said it just fun see it here don't see it here see it here don't see it here see it here don't sit in here you just keep eating this book and you can look back and then see it here and then look back see it here look back see it here look back see it here and one of these days we're going to have a new body Hallelujah Hallelujah this is temporary [Applause] I like it don't you this is real temporary now is this okay can I have just a couple more minutes can you imagine in hell in hell they they remember shamgar a poor farmer he whipped 600 of those guys and I can imagine him standing there screaming don't never come back here no more now not only do we testify about it but in hell they remember him you remember probably in hell they they got a name called David he's that little boy too young to be a soldier but he showed up you know the enemy's always in trouble when you show up he can make all kind of Bloods he can make all kind of statements until you show up because you've got the equipment to do something with him I'd say in hell they remember David really well you know they scarred him those demons scarred him with adultery murder of a best friend they scarred him with all kind of decisions that he made wrong but the blood of Jesus Christ said I'll not only love David but I'm going to name my Throne after him now can you imagine in hell how they talk about our prophet they did their best to destroy him they did their absolute best to destroy actually brother Branham tried his best to destroy himself but God that was rich in Mercy he was rich in Mercy and you know I'm always astounded I've been a I've been a listener to tapes since since a little boy no matter where brother Brandon was at he's not really intimidated by the audience whether it's Switzerland or in Finland or even in some of those Nations over there they may not know his language or his dialect and he'll tell them a squirrel story and they'll relate I tell them about a possum and they'll relate for long he starts telling him the one Miracle after another miracle and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if he ever did heal he's still obligated to heal you and before long he takes some historical events and makes them modern right in the service now you may have walked into this morning with your back condition and your back just feels like it's going to give out at any time and no doubt if you went to a back doctor you would set hours and hours and hours and then they do surgery and it'd take you six months to get fixed when you walked into the right doctor today and in a moment he can fix your back [Music] all right in a moment he can fix your marriage in a moment he can bless your business in a moment I want to make a couple more statements the word of God is superior to your feelings I want you to quote it with me the word of God is superior to your feelings ain't that great ain't that great Brother Band says Satan took him up on the mountain and set him down and Jesus rebuked him again with the word he defeated Satan with the word of God showing that the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan with the word of God showing that the weakest of Christians maybe you walked in this building in a very much of a blues dark situation you don't have to stay that way you don't have to stay that way the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan with thus saith the Lord well brother Ron my wife's got a devil on her well you know you could lay hands on her and throw in the floor pray for her for 52 hours but brother Branham was his remedy for that was go go buy a box of chocolates [Music] and a dozen of roses now let me say them sisters don't blame me if you get a box of chocolates and a Dozen Roses this week don't you think oh my husband thinks I got a demon on me enjoy the roses and eat the chocolate [Applause] I read this to you three years ago be still and know that I'm God I'm bigger than your problem I'm bigger than your circumstance I'm bigger than your situation this is not your battle you don't have to handle this this is God's battle God will work it out all you have to do is be still and know that I am god let's stand Give the Lord a good hand this morning can I give you one more quote brother bam said Jesus never cried when they brought that maniac boy to him that had leprosy fallen in the fire he never said father I'm your son now now you sent me here to do such and so and so and so can I heal this boy he never said that he said come out of him Satan he spoke and the boy was well when he met Legion with two thousand devils in him it wasn't Jesus a crime it was those Devils a crime how much Authority do we have at our disposal here I want to ask you do we realize what kind of authority that we have Jesus never said no father am I able to do this he said come out of him and the Devils took their flight he knowed he was the Messiah and here's what I want to drop to you when you know who you are when you know who you are it's greater than every devil in hell when you know who you are now I know I'm coming down to an end and it's kind of quiet but I want to say something to you you don't have to fear cancer you don't have to fear trouble on your job because the scripture said he'd make you the head and not the tail God said he'd bless you coming in and going out this ain't a Prosperity Gospel this is a power gospel this is an authority gospel you are the Queen of Heaven you will sit on the throne with him you will March up and down the streets of gold it'll be your house I like it no more death no more sorrow no more pain no more Timex no more getting hungry during service sometimes we leave service and we dread going back to work on Monday morning after the atmosphere that we've been in after the atmosphere that we've been in but let me just say you don't have to leave it here you don't have to leave it here come on Church you don't have to leave it here this is our this is this is where we live we're we're called to live here we can live this on Monday morning we can live this on a Thursday afternoon I don't change because I go home and put overhauls on [Applause] I don't change because I put a polo on and change into tennis shoes I'm his wife no matter where I'm at [Applause] he can come to my house he can get in my car he can I want him everywhere that I go [Applause] it was a man came to Jesus and he said I'm a man with authority I know you're busy I'm paraphrasing I know you're busy doing what you're doing if you'll just send the word my servant will be well you don't have to come to my house you don't have to and Jesus recognized that this man understood Authority if I could only persuade you this this morning drop this Revelation in your heart if you could only understand what's at your disposal you heard last night two people speak in tongues if you noticed it was the exact same Cadence one right after the other listen these things are not happening by chance and he said well God's in our church God's in your home God's going with your children to school God's in your marriage Authority is more than just saying you got it you got to exercise it and so when the wrong kind of thoughts come in your mind tell the devil take leave take leave now I want you to exercise that right now I want you to tell the devil take your lead take your leave take a leaf take your leaf any good to us sorry I didn't get through but don't you love him get any good to us one of my early physicians in this walk I was laying in the bed and there was a lady beside him and she had five tumors I was there we weren't making a whole lot of drama but there was somebody just over the way had a little bitty spot and you'd have thought they were going to die at any second after they were gone sister Connie myself was sitting here and that man he was he was a pastor's son he was probably 60 years old but he was a pastor's son and he said I want to give you some instruction he said you already know this the god in you is more powerful than that devil he said you don't have to fight with him you just have to tell him leave did you get it did you get it the problem you had all week you don't have to fight with it

tomorrow I'm gonna plant my taters and I'm gonna expect but I'm gonna still go out and I'm gonna still believe it I don't play no taters and I don't put no roof on it but I still go out and work and I still go out and do my business and God is going to come one of these days I might be out in the worst of places in a junkyard and I might be sitting there grading grading material for some of the worst and ranked centers in the city and they're going to watch me change I don't know exactly how he's going to do it but he's going to do it like a thief in the night but one of these days somebody's going to testify there was a people down in Full Gospel Lighthouse that believes such like this and they've got the authority for the change the atmosphere is here for it we're going to let you be dismissed I I know we never dismissed from his presence you'll hear me say that till we leave but just get used to it we're not dismissing from his presence we're just dismissing from this place and we're taking this place of worship to where we're going isn't it wonderful to serve a loving God like we serve why don't you give him one more hand clap of Praise as the Brothers prepare to dismiss you today we want to say God richly bless you also we want to make mention to you that that next weekend we we have brother Wendell Martin he'll be coming to speak for us next weekend and we we saved on announcing it because of the winner well the winter conditions and looks like things are going to open up so we're able to do it so we're going to have brother Wendell come in Lord willing for Saturday and Sunday and we're just looking under the Lord I know that brother Windows never stood behind this Pulpit but you're very very familiar with his ministry and I know that you'll love him and he's just a country boy just like all of us here and so you know what we'll just we'll just buckle up if the Lord don't come back we'll buckle up and have another Holy Ghost time next weekend is that all right with you amen I was glad when they said unto me I was glad when they said unto me I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord I was glad when they say I was
