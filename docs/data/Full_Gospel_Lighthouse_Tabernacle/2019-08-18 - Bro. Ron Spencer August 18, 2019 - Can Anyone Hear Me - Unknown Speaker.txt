========================================

sighs reveal me [Music] I keep my way [Music] so you can't use me I give myself away [Music] [Laughter] I gave myself away so Oh [Music] so thrilled in so many ways to to be hearing all these announced what's going on I'd like to announce to you that there's a rapture that's in Prague they can have the park actually the juice will be the ones that will take care of all of them all the handiwork around and abroad will be sitting at the merry Safarov supper of the Lamb look across at one another love the Lord tonight just a special day to be in the presence of the Lord in it god bless you all I sure hope you enjoyed last night I sure I sure enjoyed it myself and some things that happen here toward the end of the service was just really special if you caught it it was kind of special to you I think was a special at your house brother Donnie it was a special birthday that God gave you life that's not so my ask me today so did you know that remember remember brother Tom Brown was speaking with brother Branham on the phone and they were talking he said would you do would you like to tell sister Brown it's it's her birthday would you'd like to tell her and happy birthday and she said I sure would see god bless you sister Brown he said this might be a little bit of importance to you but when I was beyond the curtain of time I saw you I'll tell you what I have to be good enough birthday present you can whatever would be I would take to Psalms 139 tonight speaks to our hearts it's really not the voice of God and as a shepherd sometimes a a shepherd is watching and he cares for his flock and he loves them with all of his heart and then when the Lord dropped something in your heart I was just overwhelmed when he dropped this I would like for this to go live on the internet if you would like to do that tonight and I just feel like this is going to be special not I'd like to speak to you one can anyone hear me David didn't Psalms 139 in verse one o Lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my down cities and mine uprising thou understandeth my thought afar off now capacit my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways what a statement for there is not a word in my tongue but O Lord thou knowest it all together thou has beset me behind and before and laid down hand upon me such knowledge it's too wonderful for me it is high and I cannot attain to it whether shall I go from my spirit whether shall I flee from thy presence I want you to just listen to these next words if I send up into heaven it's al where there if I make my bed in hell behold thou art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall die and leave me and thy right hand shall hold me and if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the nut shall be light about me yeh the darkness hot if not from thee but the knots on earth as the day that darkness and a lot are both a lock to thee for thou possesseth my reins now has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise state for I'm fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works that my soul knoweth wrought well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and furiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth an oz did see my substance yet being unperfect that's just total honesty and in the hop book all my members were written which is continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious are thy thoughts unto me O God how great this is some of them what a powerful powerful scripture let's pray Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts tonight and lord I just ask you that you would anoint our hearts in a special way Lord the pre service has been awesome and Lord we just ask you that as we come now Lord we're asking for rain on the outside but may it rain on the inside too not father come and fill our cups Lord Jesus Lord we just ask you to minister to our needs tonight you have dealt with this in a special way and we ask you now that you'd come and speak to our hearts in Jesus Christ's name they've met any man you can be seated Psalms chapter 42 and verse 1 this is familiar to you as a heart Paneth for the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee o God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God when I shall come and appear before him brother branham would liken this panting for the water brook as a deer panteth it's life and death if it don't get water a deer screaming for water its life if it can get to it tonight I want to scream to some dear Saints its life if you can get to it my tears have been my meat day and night they had continually saying to me where is that God when I remember these things I my soul in me for I had gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God and the voice of joy and praise and the multitude that kept holy day notice these next words why art thou cast down old my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance o my god o my soul that has cast down within me therefore will I remember thee in the land of Jordan and the herm rights and the heel of mizar deep calleth unto the deep at the noise of that water spouts all thy waves and billows are gone over me yet the Lord will command his loving-kindness in the daytime and and then the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto God of my life and I will say unto God my rock why has thou forgotten me think about what he is going through to be able to write this song why go I'm mourning because of the oppression of my of the of the enemy that's with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while they daily say daily unto me where is that God why art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise Him who is the health of my countenance and my god and my God he's not your God until you make him your God Genesis chapter 3 in verse 5 this is a very powerful portion of scripture it will be part of the redemption for God that note that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under a husband with her and he did it and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now once you just notice these next words and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden of the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves in the presence of the Lord God amongst the of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou where art thou I'd like to take you to when before that there was even a man on the earth when I'm when I bein that was created even co-equal except for in creation his name was Lucifer the Sun of the morning and he deceived a third part of the angels that was in heaven with his tail and with his making himself God and he was cast from that place into this realm of Earth cast here it never moved God God never moved in the act of redemption he never moved out of that spot in the act of redemption but when one son failed when one son fell millions and millions of angels fell and was cast into another room never lose God and never moved God but when one son how important is one are you with me how important are you tonight in God's great book your name is there just as important as item one one son of God fell in the Garden of Eden God came running through the garden kind of running through the garden Adam where art thou Adam hit himself it's interesting that man hides himself from the only source of life that there is he is the only source of life he's the only source of eternal life are you with me now how many times the enemy when he deceives you had pulls you aside and begins to whisper in your ears he wants to isolate you away from the presence of God and that's the last thing that we should do I heard the voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and hid myself David would write it like this in second chronicles chapter 7 in verse 12 and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night and said unto him I have heard thy prayer and have chosen displaced to myself for a house of sacrifice if I shut up heaven and there be no rain or if I command the locusts to devour the land or if I send pestilence among my people if my people notice these words if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then when I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land what a powerful scripture Romans chapter 6 and verse 12 Paul would say it like this let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body somebody is going to be king somebody's going to be king no man can serve two masters at the same time somebody is going to be the king door you life I choose King Jesus I'd like to have a vote tonight I choose King Jesus hallelujah in that spot he's never failed me he's never made a promise that he couldn't keep man make promises and man makes all kind of boasts but God never misses are you with me never forgets a promise are you with me and he's got the assets in the bank to take care of every need the scripture says my God shall supply all I saw Andrew in the back raise up a prayer list I raised up a prayer list this last week at brother Joe greens and some of your names was on it and I raised that up let me just say this you that's a prayer list that God can handle I just encourage you make a list raise it before a god that can handle your list there's nothing that you can find them in your imagination that God can take care of are you with me now neither yield your ye your members that your eyes your ears your tongue your thoughts neither yet yielding your instruments as unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto God the the eyes that you have turned them us turning to Jesus Christ the ears I heard brother Andrew last week our ears are not trashcans our ears are not trashcans they're they're not a place to where that that you need to hear everybody's problems and it used to be inquiry there was an inquiring that maybe still out there but today it's blogs Facebook's and instagrams and all kind of media that comes your way and peep seems like people want to dump I don't I don't get involved in those things but seems like people just want to dump all of their issues and all their problems and their bad days let me just say this you lift up your eyes I live here well I'm afraid somebody will rain on my parade let me just say with Jesus with Jesus every day is a sunshiny day come on as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God say brother Ron God brings rain caught bring sunshine God brings all different kinds of things let me just say this even noon he knows the seasons but if Jesus is gonna reign on me I'll take all his blessings they call them angel tears I'll take them for sin hath no not shall not have dominion over you I like that let's just say it how it is that's a Christian sin does not reign over me sin is not my boss since not my boss hallelujah since not my boss for a year not under the law but under grace I love that don't you I just absolutely love that with all my heart now I believe different cycles or different levels in my life and I'll just I'll be shared this with you for the carnal realm just for a moment because sometimes that's where we are and then sometimes we get lifted as a service goes on but I remember when I first worked and I was first in a situation to where I was just one of the boys that was working in at the radford Arsenal I hear people's murmuring and complaining and their fussing and all of their griping and I'd hear those things but I just went about doing my job and I'd hear them talk about the bosses and you know everything was the boss's fault and everybody whoever it was of company's fault but but I always I've always had this mentality if they didn't need me to work they would have not heard me they don't need me for my looks but I'm gonna preach to you you might as well you came in you sit down you read it they don't need you just because of your physical form you're there to do a job in our media today we we have sports stars that complain about they're only making 20 million a year or 3 million a year and they're they're sacrificing their body and and they just won't play unless they they get more money it'll only put them further in hell they've sold himself to slavery you see slavery is not done they complain about Thomas Jefferson owning slaves yet he writes he writes that every man should be free and there's all kind of warriors about that now since slavery is not a it's not a race deal slavery is not a race deal it's a human bill and I would say to not that probably be a good amount of you were slaves to even debt you knew I'd come to your house a credit card can make you a slave a nice car can make you a slave a nice house can make you a slave attempt can make you a slave a fishing pole can make you a slate a rifle can make you a slave I won't just strategically want you to get this I want you to understand slavery takes on many forms we think of slavery in the Old Testament when the Jews became slaves to the Egyptians but if you remember it was the Egyptians that had them hired out at first to build their cities if you remember the Jews had the best land in Egypt if you remember there was always lightened ocean they had the most fertile fields because remember there was a blessing their father Abraham sat down with the king of Giroux and he commanded a blessing on the wherever they were so even in slavery in Egypt they had all the blessings are you with me so people can sit right in church and be slaves to sin many times it's secretly in and it's very just because of this realm of of everything that we're involved in today many times people can live undercover sin that even their mates don't know about but let there be light may the God of the garden of your life come none of us want our name called out I believe God delivery was a nice way that he dealt with brother Donnie last night maybe for some of you as an audience you've seen the dead raised you've seen incredible miracles as an audience for brother Donnie last night God just reminded him that he was going to pay all death and he had him in his mind yet Satan Wars making offers even offers to where in our thoughts it seems enticing and can we do both now let me just say this to you that's not just to brother Donnie or to one of you brother Branham had to deal with that brother branham wanted to get away from the pressures of people he enjoyed the next Northwest Territories of Canada and he preaches a couple of sermons one of them a man running from the presence of the Lord why does a man want to get in a cabin thousands of miles away from anybody else maybe take his wife and his children there knowing they can't prosper in that kind of an atmosphere but he could get away from the pressures of humanity he enjoys not having to change his clothes and not have to take a bath and enjoys hunting and he enjoys being a a man of manners when you dear brother I'm talking about a real man he's not a man of great stature a man with big muscles but then walks into a restaurant and he hears a man sneeze and he said that's a real man here's brother branham has already saw the little boy in finland come back to laugh he has seen the girl in jonesboro her blonde eyes come open and I'm going to mention even her and Georgia Carter he has he has witnessed some of the most phenomenal teachings of the scriptures come open to the Gentile bride and yet he wants to be an Old Testament prophet and come down out of the mountains when God speaks to him and tell the people then then go back and God has to stop him and tell him if you do what your plan is your wife will leave you your children will leave you now I ask you the question God left brother branham can you pick it up anywhere in the sermons were he said I I didn't feel the anointing for six months I've been a listener for all these years I don't believe I I don't believe I can find it but he had to press forward I'm saying these things for a reason sometimes it seems like God's a million miles away that don't mean you quit that don't mean you come to a spot so I throw my hands up and I'm done here you press on if you remember what brother Branham said that spot was he said there was a girl that was that that that he prayed for and he thought she would get well and that girl died and he told God you owe me an apology have you ever had a prayer that you thought didn't work out like you thought it would and you get mad at God well you're not on your own you're not only her hope you're not by yourself at times God you owe me an apology and he said he left me he left me he was teaching his prophetess a lesson I'm the boss I'm the boss I'm the boss it's when we think we're the boss I'm preaching to Laodicea here people's rights they protest over everything in the world everybody's willing to raise up a sign or fuss or or do this or do that or at the end of the day he's the boss he's King and we're service not spoke to him and after about six months he brother BAM says about six months he said God showed him that a year before this girl's sickness that girl was drowning and here's my sermon and she screamed for help an interest scream for help God heard her prayer and God rescued her it wasn't her time yet it wasn't her time yet in the condition that she was in she was not ready to make heaven her home but a year later she had that had things prepared are you with me brother Branham baptized the man that was a smoker of cigarettes and and people in his congregation got all excited and all upset and they said you baptize a man that was unsanctified and and he wasn't living right he said you're not God oh [Music] brother run but this or that let me just say God sees will way beyond our mortal eyes I'm really thankful for that the scripture said that His mercy endureth forever his mercy endureth forever his mercy endures forever Paul says it like this Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from the from this body of death I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin the next scripture he writes therefore there is now no condemnation we're not Catholics we don't beat ourselves every day we don't send our yourself through purgatory over and over again we purge out the sin of our lives we deal with acid as it comes up but we'll not let it reign over top of us it doesn't give us a license to go back and do it over and over and over again to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the law of the spirit of life is in Christ and Jesus Christ says Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death I say it would say it like this what was me I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell amongst of people thunder and god the angel of God took the tongues of the four coal from off of the altar and laid it upon him and he would then write a commentary of the entire Bible why because he was living amongst unclean people no because God touched him Jeremiah 17 in verse 14 says heal me O Lord I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for thou art my praise Psalm 6 verse 2 have mercy upon me O Lord for I am weak O Lord heal me for my bones are vexed Psalms 91 in verse 1 you hear it almost every service he is my refuge and my fortress oh my god in him all our trust I love this scripture 2nd chronicles chapter 20 and verse 15 and I'm just going to jump down in the middle of it thus saith the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours are you with me for the battle is not yours but gosh where do I get in trouble fight my own battles where do you get in trouble brother Nathaniel do you ever get in trouble because you fought your battles and then God whips you because you fought your battles and he told you it's it's my battle never happen to you ever happen to you all you ended on something so simple last night I'm raising a white flag yet it's the first Christian principle of the Christian it's sin Rinda raising your hands before God is a sign of surrender but don't forget it just because you surrender 40 years ago don't mean you need to not need to do to do it today verse 17 of that same chapter you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourself and stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you all Judah and Jerusalem fear not for gospel lighthouse fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you well Ron I got a difficult week like in the playing ahead of me or at this point you just stop and thank God that God's got this service designed to let you know you're not alone whatever your business whatever your your hospital whatever your situation you're not alone young people when you go to school you're not alone I'm the only one in my school you're forgetting the picture in another room Stan's thousands of angels at charge to watch over that deposited seed of God I'm the only one in my school dresses like that hallelujah he didn't have to put a thousand people around you to prop you up and make everything easy for you God's got confidence in you [Applause] glory to God I want to remind you the scripture young people no weapon that is formed against thee no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall stand at your eyes against thee in judgment thou shalt convene sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me don't you kid yourself words sometimes pierc'd even to your heart and you remember that four years down the road somebody tell you're fat and you're obese you'll remember that person the rest of your life you're ugly you're nasty you're all different kind of things those words pierce even into your heart and you may act like I bounce that off you're real you're a human being pinch yourself if you don't think am I talking to the right audience here [Applause] further on but I just can't hold my tongue sometimes nasty things come out the recent nasty things come out it's because there's not a Holy Ghost ranking down on your heart and nasty things come from nasty fountains somebody help me preach nasty things come from nasty fountains and the reason little words seem to just slip out of your mouth because the real king is not on your heart get born again whether on my temper gets way out of control go on your knees it's hard for your temper to get out of control on your knees I went to a place one time and God spoke to me to preach on the autopsy of a dead church you know some sermons are difficult to to preach some sermons are sometimes you you just walk to the pulpit and you go well Lord here it is and I preached to about 40 people with an audience with a building structure that would seat about 400 I preached I didn't know anybody but the pastor I preached at the end of that sermon one man made his way to the altar I'm not gonna call his name I spent about an hour praying with that man I just felt led to stay I got done most of the people were gone I walked into the pastor steady the pastor was sitting at the desk and he was he was back in his chair and he has his hands behind his head and he was appalled he was literally appalled he just didn't know what to make of it I went in the washroom changed my shirt walked out I was driving home it was a about a 12 hour drive home he looked up at me and he said you don't know who you just prayed for word for an hour I said I don't care one of the richest men I've ever known in my life I'm talking about money real money real money but he needed God it didn't matter that he owned a bunch of companies I don't matter to me it shouldn't matter to you God's no respecter of person but he said in the service of about 40 people that man became one of my biggest friends in my life he's gone now but he became one of my biggest friends I'd go preach in the area and he set right beside of me because he could go back to a night to where I preached a sermon and he didn't matter what his status was or what his financial condition is because let me just say it don't matter what your name is your status is random in all of his busyness of life reminds himself our selves of when he was a 14 year old boy he got shot and here's what his first statements are and I want some things to just stick with us and after the vision struck me I was so weak I'd lost all that blood and I went till I was sinking into an endless eternity many of you heard me tell this before and sinking into an endless eternity many of you he said I was going through like clouds then through darkness and sinking on down down down down and the first thing you know I got to the regions of the lost I screamed and I looked every word just everything and there was no foundation to it I could never stop falling a few years ago I fell 40 feet and I fell on concrete and I still suffer from anxiety of that falling because I will experience it and I'll catch myself where I'm driving down the road or on I'm going through a normal day all the sudden I'm falling and I can't catch myself you see even in 40 feet there's nothing to grab ahold of just nothing to grab the hotel I cannot imagine falling 40 falling through an endless eternity folks you don't have to go to hell I don't want I don't think I've got it worst enemy but I don't want even my Nana me I want nobody to experience ten minutes of Hell Billy Andrews would say this if we could have a glimpse of hell and maybe hold you over it feels few seconds we'd have the greatest author called in the world but God don't steer you to an altar God pulls you to an altar brother Branham sees things there that no person should have to hear he hear screams he hears news and ahhs and he sees the hairstyles of today in the painted faces of today and and remember everybody in Hell is naked and remember everybody in Hell is in the body that they sin been no parties no friends there's not a friend in Hell get aside from the illusion you you you must stand before an angry god that turned you've turned down his mercy but I want to scream - yes or not no matter where you're at in life and no matter how sins got a hope to you and lied and trapped you and enslave you and you think you've got to stay there you don't have to stay there oh I wish so-and-so was here I do too I wish this person was here to hear that I do too I wish that I could preach to the world now I was at the fair Friday and someone called me their pastor they don't dress like it it didn't give me a license to to treat them bad I treated him good someone asked me said what do you think I said I pray that there's a merciful God thinking about this sermon tonight what would you trade with your soul what would you trade your soul for temporary pleasure another man another woman let me just say if you trade your soul you're going to be real disappointed another man snores like the man you had to force knows other men have other mistakes why would you I don't care if it's Miss America she's eight up with worms 24 hours hours after she dies she's full of worms baby marilyn monroe's of this world they go to a coroner's office but in hell if she could look back she'd like to get the adultery since still going on against her to stop jesus said to richmond and in hell he wanted to come back and evangelize his brothers brother homer one of his favorite subjects he said if i could only go back if i could only go back there's things that haunt me as a preacher haunt me voices that haunt me now I'm preaching from my heart if I could save them I would if you could you would and I want to make a statement here we can go to a funeral homes to say I pray they're in a better place and I pray they are but there's a reality here if you're not born again I don't care what the last name is there was a little girl in Milltown that lived with a family that didn't believe God would heal she went to a church that didn't believe God healed she had been because of uncle molested her as a little girl it left a disease on her and that disease crippled that little girl she laid in bed for almost 10 years about the ninth year three years after doctor said they couldn't do no more for she was weigh in about 37 pounds she was in a condition to word that they no longer cleaned her body but they put rubber sheets under her and she excreted from the herself and they would change the rubber sheets and leave her in that putrified condition but somebody gave her a book somebody gave her a book and in that weakened condition she read that God's healing [Applause] I want to pull some things too for you brother random said when I was in hell I screamed and there was no daddy there was no mama the girl in jonesboro she screaming out amongst that crowd where's my daddy where's my daughter grab the whole cup brother branham's lapels and said if you can get me to the healer I can find my daughter are you with me you may not have the strength to scream tonight but is there anybody that can hear is there anybody can hear my cry brother on you don't know my situation god this when I hear when I go in a nursing home and I hear old people screaming help me help me somebody help me nurses can't fix that doctors can't fix that but there's a God there's a God that hears there was a woman sitting in a prison house and she'd been invited to a church meeting and the preacher preaches seemed oblique to like to an audience that didn't respond and finally toward the end of the service a man screams Savior please don't pass me by and a woman that was blonde pinned a song Savior Savior blind funny crossed me pinned that song and it's been some millions and millions and millions of times she never made a dime on it in her life but there's a reward that's going I want to ask us audience honestly have you ever been to a spot to where it seemed like nobody could hear you then this sermon is for you last night was the platform and two knots the sermon then this sermon is for you now you see to walk this road you've had to live this road and understand being a spot because choices made me to the spot that it was and I was in the bottom doing drugs and it looked like there was no way out and I heard a voice that asked me where are you and I responded to that voice and I said lord if it's you helped me to get out of this in 24 hours God opened the door on the Left all my belongings and I left and I went out come on church [Applause] somewhere down the road I heard a voice and it was more than my mom and daddy it was God God came to me when I had when I put myself when I put myself in some situations that I shouldn't be in let me say let the voice from this pulpit scream out God says I hear you you know the vision you know the fulfillment but somewhere another girl the girl laid there over nine years that she had wrung the varnish off of the post of the bed beyond desperation the critical pain in way of thirty seven pounds at that point it seemed like no hope was that but God sent a prophet that would preach such phenomenal things in life and spending phenomenal pulpits God remembered a voice in Milltown are you listening to help that woman never became rich that woman never lived in a mansion but God raised that woman back up to health and she lived an old age some of your family lives very close to her I don't know if you even know that or not brother William but some of your family actually lives right you're actually going pretty close to where she lived she'll never make the who's who she probably never hardly made minimum money but God remember I want to read one quote brother Ben sis and I look back there and I said here a few days ago I was down there and I looked at that little Obed she took me in to show it to her there she was where the paint was rubbed off all the rounds and right there were year after year laying hollering crying begging holding on to that rub the pain off of her bedpost but God heard her cry no matter what she was raised in God will move you just sit still and let God do it have faith in Him he'll work it out a little woman was dying she knew he was God that's the barrel went down and down and down in circumstances got worse and worse all the time but God was letting it get that way he loves to do that he loves to put your faith to a test to see how you act on it and let you be anointed and prayed and then makes it worse come on Satan put him to a test I know he believes me blessed God forever hold my put him to a test to know I know I know he took my word for it could he say that about you he said that about joke do anything to him you want to but don't take his life for I know he loves me he made a burnt offering he made his requirements he did and I told him and he believes it roll him over in the coals if you have to he he took everything away for him and God doubled it when he gave it back to him he puts your faith to a test to see if you really believe that he is gone that little woman no doubt said I prayed and I prayed and I know I'm an unworthy Gentile and you remember Jesus spoke of her in the Bible and he said was it he said one of their many widows in the days of Elijah but he sent only sent him to one and she was a Gentile he said I prayed and maybe when he seen that last little cake and yes had already entered into the gate and come to the door one little bag a cake a piece and she and her son would have died and I can see her all not praying hot winds are blowing and
