[47:56] and did not leave all of heaven just to
[48:02] die and for your sin i
[48:06] searched until i found you
[48:10] and i do it all again
[48:15] hallelujah i believe that with
[48:19] everything that's within me
[48:21] amen if you have your bibles this
[48:22] evening we like to look over in the book
[48:24] of hebrews
[48:25] chapter 11 and verse 6 and then down in
[48:29] the book of
[48:29] jude chapter 1 and verse 3
[48:33] well before we before we read the
[48:35] scriptures this evening as you're
[48:37] finding your way
[48:39] to the book of hebrews and the book of
[48:42] jude there
[48:45] well branham said in the message the
[48:47] supernatural
[48:49] and he said that's the reason sometimes
[48:51] a divine life that's been called and set
[48:53] aside has become a fanatic or
[48:55] or crazy or a mystical or something to
[48:58] the eyes of the general public
[49:00] is because you're considered i'd say a
[49:03] neurotic or an insane person
[49:05] because that you're changed your
[49:07] dwelling place
[49:08] and got into a different atmosphere
[49:11] and your one motive and your one thought
[49:14] is to stay in that atmosphere
[49:16] and any person that's ever come into
[49:18] that atmosphere one time will never be
[49:20] satisfied nowhere else
[49:22] and that's why i believe that we should
[49:25] have our churches
[49:26] under control by the holy ghost that men
[49:29] and women in their work and wherever
[49:31] they should be
[49:32] should continually desire and they will
[49:35] if they ever once come into that
[49:37] atmosphere
[49:39] again it's the atmosphere that brings
[49:42] the miraculous
[49:43] and wonders and powers of god amongst
[49:45] the people it's the atmosphere
[49:49] of the people it's the atmosphere of the
[49:52] people
[49:53] it's not the atmosphere of angels it's
[49:56] not the and it's not the atmosphere of
[49:58] principalities but it's the atmosphere
[50:01] of the people amen hebrews chapter 11
[50:05] and verse 6
[50:05] but without faith it is impossible to
[50:09] please him
[50:10] for he that cometh to god must believe
[50:13] that he
[50:14] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[50:17] that diligently seek him jude 1 and
[50:20] verse 3
[50:22] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[50:25] write unto you
[50:26] of the common salvation it was needful
[50:29] for me to write unto you
[50:30] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[50:34] contend for the faith which was once
[50:36] delivered
[50:37] unto the saints you may be seated in the
[50:40] presence of the lord
[50:42] let's read that last portion of that
[50:44] scripture
[50:46] and jude and exhaust and exhort you that
[50:48] you should earnestly
[50:50] contend for the faith which was once
[50:53] delivered
[50:54] unto the saints i truly believe that
[50:57] it's
[50:57] the desire of every christian and every
[51:00] son and daughter of god to constantly be
[51:03] in the atmosphere of the holy ghost and
[51:05] to be in the atmosphere of the presence
[51:07] of god
[51:08] and i truly believe with everything
[51:09] that's within me as a son of god and as
[51:12] a
[51:12] minister of this gospel that that the
[51:14] winds of change are blowing
[51:16] and that the atmosphere is charged with
[51:19] the supernatural
[51:20] for miracles to be produced and i
[51:22] believe with all of my heart that the
[51:24] atmosphere
[51:26] is set for the changing of the body and
[51:28] you can see as gravity
[51:30] as it begins to loose yourself as you
[51:32] loose your hands up and you loose your
[51:34] praise loose
[51:35] and you're watching that the atmosphere
[51:37] is getting set
[51:39] for the supernatural to take place and
[51:41] that's what we need in every single
[51:43] service is for the atmosphere to get
[51:45] right no matter what who is preaching no
[51:48] matter
[51:48] what the subject is it's the atmosphere
[51:51] to get right
[51:52] before there can ever become a change in
[51:54] somebody's life before there can ever be
[51:56] a move
[51:57] before there can ever be a healing that
[51:59] has got that has taken place
[52:00] it's got to be an atmosphere to take
[52:03] place
[52:04] it's just like it's just like when the
[52:06] powers of god get to moving
[52:07] the atmosphere is set for somebody to
[52:11] receive
[52:12] that word that is going forth and this
[52:14] book that we read from in the book of
[52:16] jude it's a very brief
[52:18] book but yet it's a very powerful book
[52:20] and to me it's one of it's one of my
[52:22] favorite readings to do
[52:24] and to go over and to look at the book
[52:26] of jude but jude was a it was an epistle
[52:28] and he was
[52:29] and as he was writing jude believed in
[52:31] not allowing that the
[52:33] allowing the negative to to influence
[52:36] the he didn't allow it was not allowing
[52:39] the negative influence of the enemy to
[52:41] come in
[52:42] and destroy the works of god and
[52:44] actually if you go through that chapter
[52:46] and
[52:46] go through it at your own time and come
[52:48] through that you'll find that
[52:49] jude goes through there and he unmasked
[52:52] all of the false teachings and
[52:53] and all of the the antichrist spirit
[52:56] that's that is coming through there
[52:58] and yet here he is he's exposing that by
[53:01] the very word of god
[53:03] and he made an appeal to all the
[53:05] christians of that day
[53:06] and even under this tale unto this day
[53:09] to the church he appealed to them
[53:11] to earnestly contend for the faith but
[53:14] he didn't say a faith but he said
[53:16] the faith to earnestly contend for the
[53:19] faith and we realize that the bible
[53:21] tells us
[53:21] that there's one faith there's one lord
[53:24] one faith one baptism one god and father
[53:27] of all who is above
[53:28] all and through you all and in you all
[53:31] but he is telling
[53:32] us that we are contending for the faith
[53:34] but notice that this has been
[53:36] when jude is writing this i believe it
[53:38] was about 33 years
[53:39] after after christ's ascension that jude
[53:42] is writing this
[53:43] writing this book but here he is not
[53:46] contending
[53:47] for the faith of the levitical laws but
[53:49] yet here he is
[53:50] he is saying we are contending for the
[53:53] faith of a living god
[53:54] of a supernatural god it was not
[53:57] something that
[53:58] that they were looking back to some
[53:59] historical affair
[54:01] but here jude was saying that we would
[54:03] earnestly contend
[54:04] for the faith that was once delivered
[54:07] unto the saints and here jude writes
[54:10] this letter
[54:11] he writes this letter to stir up the
[54:13] faith that was on the inside of a people
[54:16] and here we're living in an hour when
[54:18] the restoration of faith
[54:20] when we're watching when the ministry of
[54:23] malachi 4
[54:24] is at its peak and in its season and in
[54:27] its time
[54:28] it is a returning back to the faith of
[54:30] the pentecostal fathers
[54:32] and we realize that without faith it is
[54:35] impossible
[54:36] to please him i believe that's every one
[54:38] of ours desires this evening
[54:40] no matter how young you are no matter
[54:41] how old you are no matter how long
[54:43] you've been in church
[54:44] or how little time you've been in church
[54:46] but it is our desire that we please him
[54:49] and i believe that one of these days he
[54:51] will take us
[54:52] but we realize that every time that
[54:54] faith sets itself
[54:55] up that the devil turns he turns every
[54:59] gun in hell
[55:00] right on it like that because faith is
[55:03] setting itself up
[55:04] and anytime you as a person as a
[55:06] believer you start setting yourself up
[55:08] in faith
[55:09] you'll watch when the enemy comes in and
[55:11] he tries to destroy you
[55:13] he tries to destroy your family he tries
[55:15] to destroy your
[55:16] reputation he tries to destroy who you
[55:19] are he
[55:19] tries to destroy your experience and
[55:22] says you really didn't get anything or
[55:24] he says nothing really happened or it
[55:26] was just a workup
[55:27] or an emotion but you know down on the
[55:30] inside of you that you're not the same
[55:32] as you was when you first came to the
[55:34] lord
[55:34] so you can take him back to the word and
[55:37] you can take him back to your experience
[55:39] and you can recognize that it's the
[55:41] atmosphere
[55:42] of the holy ghost that change you now
[55:44] now many of you you sit here and
[55:47] and many of you have a different
[55:48] testimony of where you came out of some
[55:50] catholic some methodist
[55:52] some looking for different things but
[55:54] every single one of us can say that we
[55:56] came out of sin
[55:58] is that right but we realize that the
[56:01] enemy will try to trap us
[56:03] into all kinds of things of making us
[56:05] feel like we're not good enough and
[56:07] making us not realize our worth to the
[56:09] lord
[56:10] but yet the holy ghost can come in a
[56:12] service and the holy ghost can speak to
[56:15] you
[56:15] and tell you to to realize you're worth
[56:18] to
[56:18] to have a little gumption about yourself
[56:20] to have a little pride about yourself
[56:22] and
[56:23] realize that you're a child of the most
[56:25] high god that you are
[56:27] birthed by the word of the lord and the
[56:29] blood of jesus
[56:30] christ cleansed you he made you anew he
[56:32] washed you he changed you
[56:34] you're not the creature that you once
[56:36] was but you are a new creature
[56:38] in christ jesus and it's the atmosphere
[56:41] that does the changing it's not the man
[56:44] it's not the preaching anybody can take
[56:46] words and anybody can put words together
[56:48] but it's the atmosphere of the holy
[56:50] ghost that makes a difference
[56:52] and when that enemy comes in and tries
[56:54] to tell you that your experience isn't
[56:56] true or
[56:57] tries to tell you that what you have is
[56:59] just some emotion
[57:01] emotion might leave an emotion might
[57:03] come but that which sets up on the
[57:05] throne room of your heart
[57:06] can never leave because you are sealed
[57:09] until the day of your redemption
[57:11] by a holy ghost that is not giving up on
[57:14] you
[57:15] and when the enemy comes in against you
[57:17] do like james 4 and 7 says
[57:20] submit yourself therefore unto god and
[57:22] resist the devil
[57:24] and he will flee from you and when the
[57:26] enemy is doing his job
[57:28] you do your job he can attack you all he
[57:32] wants
[57:33] but you start attacking back at him and
[57:35] saying i am
[57:36] a child of god i'm not a chart newt the
[57:40] true foul
[57:40] twofold child of hell but i am a child
[57:44] of the living god i know my position in
[57:46] christ
[57:47] i know where i'm at i know where i'm
[57:49] standing at
[57:50] i know what happened and i drove
[57:53] my marker down at that spot where the
[57:56] holy ghost met me
[57:59] there was a there's a story about an old
[58:02] man he went to a tent revival
[58:04] and he went there and every time he'd go
[58:06] he went throughout the week
[58:07] the enemy kept whipping him over things
[58:09] that had happened to him said well you
[58:11] did this or you did that
[58:13] there's no way that you got and he went
[58:14] back down to the altar the next night
[58:16] and he went back down there the next
[58:18] night and he went back down there the
[58:20] next night and the enemy just kept
[58:21] whipping
[58:22] him day after day over those things well
[58:24] finally it come to a spot
[58:26] and he took a he took a sledgehammer and
[58:29] he took a
[58:30] and he took a big a great big steak and
[58:32] when it come
[58:33] time for the moving of god he took that
[58:36] stake
[58:37] and he took that he took that
[58:38] sledgehammer and went down there to the
[58:41] altar
[58:41] and he drove in a stake in the ground
[58:44] and said there
[58:45] is where i met my lord jesus
[58:50] let me tell you you can always come back
[58:52] to that spot
[58:53] that that's where i met him that's where
[58:55] i got changed
[58:57] that's where i gave up my old self
[59:00] and he gave me all of himself
[59:05] and jude says that jude didn't come in
[59:07] there with some
[59:08] week with some weak uh letter to us
[59:11] but he comes in there as a defender of
[59:14] the faith
[59:17] that's something you're going to have to
[59:18] do is you're going to have to defend
[59:19] yourself
[59:20] you're going to defend what happened to
[59:22] you last weekend
[59:24] the enemy would love to come in and rob
[59:26] what happened to you last weekend
[59:28] he loved to come in and whisper in your
[59:30] ear well that was just a pastor
[59:32] or that was just a or that was just an
[59:34] emotion or that was just a time or a
[59:36] season
[59:37] that's what the enemy is coming to do
[59:39] but you've got to defend this faith
[59:42] you got to stand up on your own two feet
[59:45] not when the pastor's there or when your
[59:47] friends are there
[59:48] but stand up on your own two feet be
[59:50] like a man
[59:51] stand like a man say hey i know what
[59:53] happened to me down there
[59:55] it's the enemy's job to whisper to you
[59:58] it's the enemy's job to make
[1:00:00] you mad it's the enemy's job to tear you
[1:00:02] apart it's the enemy's job to make you
[1:00:04] mad at somebody sitting in this building
[1:00:06] it's the enemy's job for you to get
[1:00:07] upset but don't be a coward
[1:00:10] and run for cover but stand up and say
[1:00:12] hey
[1:00:13] that's my position that's my inheritance
[1:00:16] and the enemy is going to do his job
[1:00:22] he's going to try to kill to steal and
[1:00:24] destroy your life
[1:00:26] he's going to try to kill the move of
[1:00:27] god he's going to try to shut down the
[1:00:30] power
[1:00:30] he's going to try to shut off the
[1:00:32] emotion trying to shut down the
[1:00:34] atmosphere and
[1:00:35] shut down and kill your life
[1:00:38] [Music]
[1:00:40] not happening not happen but the book of
[1:00:43] john 1
[1:00:44] john 5 and 4 said that whatsoever is
[1:00:47] born of god overcometh the world
[1:00:50] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:00:53] the world even
[1:00:56] our faith
[1:01:00] when jesus comes
[1:01:05] when jesus comes to a very
[1:01:09] very critical moment when jesus is
[1:01:12] always teaching
[1:01:14] his followers but jesus comes to a
[1:01:17] moment when
[1:01:18] when there is when there is a sycamine
[1:01:21] tree that will not produce
[1:01:23] and jesus curses that thing
[1:01:26] and when the disciples were walking back
[1:01:28] past it
[1:01:30] they looked at it and they wondered at
[1:01:31] this but jesus looked at them and they
[1:01:34] told them
[1:01:35] have faith in god
[1:01:40] what a profound what a profound sentence
[1:01:43] have
[1:01:44] faith in god that whatsoever
[1:01:47] things you when you desire when you pray
[1:01:50] believe that you shall receive them and
[1:01:53] you shall
[1:01:54] have them now now i want you to hear me
[1:01:58] real loud and clear there's a lot of
[1:02:00] people that that get numb
[1:02:02] to praying they get numb to warning they
[1:02:05] get numb to
[1:02:06] they get numb to of just going through
[1:02:08] the motions and
[1:02:09] and saying the same prayer even though
[1:02:12] they haven't seen it yet
[1:02:14] even though they they don't know it they
[1:02:16] get numb to it because they
[1:02:17] they keep repeating that prayer keep
[1:02:19] asking for that
[1:02:21] let me say you need to be purged by the
[1:02:24] power of prayer
[1:02:25] so that your desire will come out on the
[1:02:27] other side
[1:02:28] just the way you prayed it there's a lot
[1:02:30] of people that give up on prayer
[1:02:32] there's a lot of people that give up on
[1:02:34] what they ask for there's a lot of
[1:02:36] people
[1:02:36] that don't go far enough
[1:02:41] they give up because they ain't seen no
[1:02:44] fruition of it
[1:02:45] what you need to do like jesus did is
[1:02:48] curse that tree
[1:02:49] that keeps standing in front of you and
[1:02:51] ain't producing fruit
[1:02:56] oh i just took you to a whole other
[1:02:57] level what you need to do
[1:02:59] is to curse the thing that keeps robbing
[1:03:02] you from eating
[1:03:03] off the tree of life and curse the very
[1:03:06] demon
[1:03:07] that is causing you to not have what you
[1:03:10] asked for
[1:03:16] now and question and answers brother
[1:03:19] brandon
[1:03:19] brother branham was was speaking about
[1:03:21] the the human being that
[1:03:23] the contact with this world he's
[1:03:25] speaking about the five senses
[1:03:27] how that this man is built to contact
[1:03:30] this this fleshly
[1:03:32] this fleshly world but notice he says he
[1:03:35] said his faith
[1:03:37] sets his destination where he's hid it
[1:03:39] for
[1:03:40] he said now faith is a substance of
[1:03:42] things hoped for
[1:03:44] the evidence of things that you don't
[1:03:46] see tastes
[1:03:47] feel smell or hear but by faith when he
[1:03:50] catches the word
[1:03:51] it sends him into a dimension that makes
[1:03:54] it so real to him
[1:03:56] till he's just as good as he's got it in
[1:03:58] his hand
[1:03:59] he knows it's going to happen
[1:04:02] so when sight won't give it to you and
[1:04:05] when feeling won't give it to you
[1:04:07] that's where faith takes over you
[1:04:09] remember in the bible when there was a
[1:04:11] servant of elijah that
[1:04:13] that that couldn't see there elisha
[1:04:16] and his servant gahesa they there elijah
[1:04:20] was anointed a man of god
[1:04:22] to look over into the king of syria and
[1:04:25] look over in
[1:04:26] there and tell the king of israel of all
[1:04:29] of the enemy's plans
[1:04:30] and there was a man in the camp that
[1:04:32] told him said that that servant elijah
[1:04:34] knows the things that you're saying in
[1:04:36] your very bed chamber
[1:04:38] but yet when the king of syria took all
[1:04:40] of his army up there
[1:04:41] and he went up there and he was going to
[1:04:43] he was going to go up there
[1:04:45] after elijah when the hazel woke up
[1:04:48] early in the morning
[1:04:49] ghazal went out there and he saw that
[1:04:52] the whole
[1:04:53] host of the syrian army had surrounded
[1:04:56] the city
[1:04:58] and he made this comment he called on
[1:05:01] his master and he said
[1:05:02] last last master how shall we do
[1:05:06] seeing these things but elisha just
[1:05:08] stood real still
[1:05:10] and he said fear not for there's more
[1:05:12] with us
[1:05:13] than there is with them and elisha made
[1:05:16] a prayer
[1:05:20] sometimes when you get in that moment
[1:05:22] when you can't see what's moving around
[1:05:24] you
[1:05:24] you need to have yourself a prayer you
[1:05:27] need to have a prayer meeting with god
[1:05:28] where you say god i need to see the
[1:05:30] things the way you see
[1:05:31] things not the way that i want to see
[1:05:34] them not the outcome that i want to see
[1:05:36] but let me see the way you want me to
[1:05:37] see
[1:05:42] fear not fear not there's more with us
[1:05:45] than there is with them and elijah
[1:05:47] prayed god
[1:05:49] opened up his eyes that he might see
[1:05:52] and when he looked out there he seen
[1:05:54] that there was
[1:05:55] horses of fire and chariots of fire that
[1:05:58] was hanging on every bushes on the
[1:06:00] mountainside
[1:06:01] you see that man was outnumbered
[1:06:05] all of the syrian army was outnumbered
[1:06:07] because there was a mighty host
[1:06:09] that was with elisha elisha didn't even
[1:06:12] see that they were there
[1:06:13] he didn't even have to look that they
[1:06:15] were there but he realized that psalms
[1:06:17] 91 was in effect
[1:06:18] he realized that psalms 34 was in effect
[1:06:21] that the angel of the lord
[1:06:23] encamps about them that fear him he
[1:06:25] didn't have to see it with his eyes
[1:06:27] he didn't even have to look into that
[1:06:29] realm but he knew that the word said
[1:06:31] that they'd be there
[1:06:34] he was resting in that whether he seen
[1:06:36] it or whether he didn't he was resting
[1:06:38] in what the word said
[1:06:40] and when there is when there was and an
[1:06:43] opening to gehazer's eyes
[1:06:44] he come to the revelation that there was
[1:06:47] more with us
[1:06:51] than there is with them so let me say
[1:06:54] this to you
[1:06:55] before you feel it or before you see it
[1:06:57] the supernatural is here
[1:06:59] and the supernatural is ready and the
[1:07:01] supernatural's willing
[1:07:09] it's easy to have faith when you can see
[1:07:10] things you ain't even gotta have faith
[1:07:13] when you can explain
[1:07:14] things but faith is when you don't see
[1:07:17] it
[1:07:18] faith is when he's you're standing
[1:07:20] toe-to-toe with the devil
[1:07:21] and you look like abraham looked at it
[1:07:23] and you look at it
[1:07:24] and say well i don't know when it's
[1:07:26] coming but i know it's coming
[1:07:28] and against all odds and against all
[1:07:30] hope i'm gonna believe
[1:07:32] that the baby is coming even though
[1:07:34] sarah's fussing
[1:07:36] everything's not right she's all tore up
[1:07:38] because we're down here
[1:07:40] and lot's wives down there and got all
[1:07:43] the goods of the city
[1:07:46] but there came a man walking down a
[1:07:49] dusty road
[1:07:53] how did abraham know that that was
[1:07:55] melchizedek because he had an
[1:07:57] atmosphere he'd been in a conversation
[1:07:59] with him before
[1:08:00] he'd been in a relationship with him
[1:08:02] before and when he had that talk
[1:08:04] and he said when he said to abraham and
[1:08:07] he started talking to him
[1:08:11] brother branham said he he abraham ran
[1:08:14] into the tent where sarah was
[1:08:16] says honey come here and take a look our
[1:08:19] hour of visitation
[1:08:21] is at hand let me tell you something
[1:08:24] i've been in prayer when i felt this
[1:08:26] atmosphere i've been in prayer when i
[1:08:29] seen the moving of god
[1:08:30] i've been in prayer and i felt that
[1:08:32] sweep come through there
[1:08:34] i believe with all of my heart
[1:08:37] that this is the hour of our visitation
[1:08:40] that the things that we've prayed for
[1:08:42] that the things that we've asked for
[1:08:44] will come into fruition
[1:08:48] because the atmosphere is charged
[1:08:52] with the supernatural
[1:09:00] help me jesus
[1:09:04] zacharias excuse me in luke chapter 1
[1:09:08] verse 11
[1:09:10] the bible said and there appeared unto
[1:09:12] him speaking of zechariah
[1:09:15] an angel of the lord standing
[1:09:19] on the right side of the altar of
[1:09:22] incense
[1:09:26] whether you see him or whether you don't
[1:09:28] that angel was watching
[1:09:31] many times we we get accustomed to
[1:09:35] this is just another service you've
[1:09:38] heard me say it
[1:09:39] and it's easy to do but i'm only
[1:09:41] bringing you to the recognition
[1:09:43] to be aware that there's something
[1:09:44] greater than myself
[1:09:46] brother ron or any other minister that
[1:09:48] is standing there
[1:09:51] and maybe maybe you don't know this but
[1:09:54] i i was preaching a couple weeks ago and
[1:09:56] i may never ever preach on that subject
[1:09:58] again on the god who sees
[1:10:01] speaking about hagar and that the angel
[1:10:03] of the lord saw her
[1:10:05] and brother ron looked at me and told me
[1:10:09] now be real steady that angel the lord
[1:10:10] standing right there
[1:10:14] now it may have not been another service
[1:10:17] it may have not been enough it may have
[1:10:19] been just another service for you but
[1:10:20] for me
[1:10:23] i felt his effects and i felt the
[1:10:24] atmosphere
[1:10:26] but for somebody to see it
[1:10:30] for somebody to see it are you with me
[1:10:33] now i know i'm going to bring this
[1:10:34] i'm going to bring this to you now but
[1:10:36] now now it's one thing for me to feel it
[1:10:38] and it's one thing for you to feel it
[1:10:40] it's one thing when mary begin to feel
[1:10:42] something on the outside but whenever
[1:10:44] on the inside but when everybody started
[1:10:46] seeing on the outside
[1:10:47] what was happening on the inside it was
[1:10:50] more than just another temple service
[1:10:52] for mary
[1:10:53] she saw herself in that scripture
[1:10:59] let me say something i saw myself in
[1:11:01] that moment
[1:11:02] that god saw me through all of my pain
[1:11:05] god saw me
[1:11:07] god will not waste your pain what you're
[1:11:10] going through
[1:11:11] what the pain you've been going through
[1:11:13] in your past god
[1:11:14] will not forget where you're at
[1:11:20] but zacharias notice that the angel of
[1:11:22] the lord standing on the right side of
[1:11:24] the altar of incense
[1:11:25] and when zechariah saw him he was
[1:11:27] troubled and
[1:11:28] fear fell upon him but the angel said
[1:11:31] unto him fear not zacharias
[1:11:34] for thy prayer is heard and thy wife
[1:11:37] elizabeth
[1:11:38] shall bear thee a son and that shall
[1:11:41] call
[1:11:41] his name john you don't know how long
[1:11:45] they pray for this boy
[1:11:47] you don't know how long they'd ask for
[1:11:48] this boy you don't know how many things
[1:11:50] that they've asked where's john at
[1:11:54] where's that john at i've been asking
[1:11:55] for him where's that john at
[1:11:57] where's that baby i was looking for the
[1:11:59] one that's going to come out
[1:12:00] and break the womb where's that one
[1:12:04] and there an angel came and spoke john's
[1:12:07] coming into
[1:12:08] existence
[1:12:11] john's coming but here's zacharias
[1:12:14] because of fear and begin to trouble he
[1:12:17] begin
[1:12:19] to disbelieve what he prayed for
[1:12:26] he failed to see all those prayers he'd
[1:12:28] set up
[1:12:30] you know how many times elizabeth had
[1:12:32] went through this crisis
[1:12:33] every 28 days john ain't coming yet
[1:12:38] the baby ain't coming yet but he failed
[1:12:42] to see all those things that he prayed
[1:12:43] for
[1:12:44] but the angel the angel was going to
[1:12:46] make sure
[1:12:47] that even though he may have forgot what
[1:12:49] he prayed about john
[1:12:50] even though mama man forgot what he
[1:12:53] prayed about john
[1:12:54] maybe it seemed like the time had passed
[1:12:56] them
[1:12:58] but the angel was concerned about john
[1:13:01] getting there
[1:13:02] and you may be disconcerned about your
[1:13:05] loved one coming in or you might be
[1:13:07] disconcerned
[1:13:08] about producing somebody that's going to
[1:13:11] come forth you might be disconcerned
[1:13:13] with this service
[1:13:14] but there is going to be an angel that
[1:13:17] no matter how you feel
[1:13:19] no matter what you see he is going to
[1:13:21] bring forth john
[1:13:24] zacharias you may fail to see it you may
[1:13:26] forget what you prayed
[1:13:28] but the angel's going to make sure that
[1:13:29] john gets here
[1:13:31] he might have to shut your mouth up so
[1:13:33] you don't say something crazy
[1:13:35] he might have to shut your mouth up so
[1:13:37] that you disbelieve
[1:13:39] and speak out of existing what's coming
[1:13:41] but john's coming
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:13:44] john's coming and elizabeth and
[1:13:47] zacharias
[1:13:48] they went back after his time of
[1:13:50] menstruation when administration in a
[1:13:52] temple
[1:13:53] and he went back there and she conceived
[1:14:01] what was it there was scripture hanging
[1:14:03] over john
[1:14:04] that was scripture hanging over
[1:14:05] zacharias he may have failed to see
[1:14:08] that that here he was a a minister
[1:14:11] of the temple and he may have failed to
[1:14:13] see it but there was one coming
[1:14:17] i hear a voice of one crying in the
[1:14:19] wilderness zechariah's disbelief
[1:14:22] or not knowing what was going to happen
[1:14:26] ain't that the way most of us do
[1:14:29] ain't that the way most of us do we pray
[1:14:31] for something and then a minister stands
[1:14:34] up over top of you
[1:14:35] and he prophesies that the thing that
[1:14:37] you pray for
[1:14:38] is getting ready to come it about scares
[1:14:42] you to death
[1:14:45] you might get scared but the word of the
[1:14:47] lord will not return void unto him
[1:14:49] if he said it's coming you can get mad
[1:14:52] because you ain't seen it yet you can
[1:14:53] get all flustered because you ain't
[1:14:55] filtered yet you can get upset because
[1:14:56] your parent ain't sitting beside you or
[1:14:58] your son or your daughter ain't sitting
[1:15:00] beside you
[1:15:00] but if the word of the lord has said it
[1:15:02] the angel will make sure
[1:15:04] that they wake that prodigal up and get
[1:15:06] up out of that hog pen
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:22] i'm going to tell you what's getting
[1:15:23] ready to happen there's gonna be some
[1:15:24] prodigals that look over at the devil
[1:15:26] and say hey
[1:15:27] i changed my mind i'm not doing that no
[1:15:30] more
[1:15:30] i'm not following that sin no more i'm
[1:15:32] not going after that thing no more
[1:15:34] tell the devil how to mate up my mind
[1:15:37] and i got the mind of jesus christ
[1:15:39] no matter what
[1:15:44] it's the angel that's doing this
[1:15:48] it's the angel that's awakening it's the
[1:15:50] angel
[1:15:51] that brings the atmosphere into this
[1:15:54] place
[1:15:54] you may not see him you may not feel him
[1:15:57] but that same pillar of fire
[1:15:59] is in the building to make sure that the
[1:16:02] word of the lord
[1:16:03] has been spoken over you comes to pass
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:14] they might die they might die before you
[1:16:17] see it
[1:16:18] but jesus knows how to get people up out
[1:16:20] of the grave being four days dead
[1:16:23] it may look like there's no life there
[1:16:25] but i'm gonna tell you
[1:16:26] this same atmosphere is that this pulpit
[1:16:29] will be the atmosphere that changes my
[1:16:31] body
[1:16:32] it'll be this atmosphere that takes me
[1:16:34] into that world
[1:16:40] what a blessed people you are what a
[1:16:43] blessed people you are
[1:16:44] i've been reflecting over that i read
[1:16:46] that or made
[1:16:48] mention of that quote when brother
[1:16:49] branham said it's the hardest thing to
[1:16:50] do is to get people
[1:16:52] in the atmosphere believing in the
[1:16:53] atmosphere of worship that's been on my
[1:16:55] heart all week
[1:16:56] and i thought my jesus what a blessed
[1:16:59] people we are
[1:17:02] it ain't hard to worship god here it is
[1:17:04] hard to believe god here
[1:17:06] it ain't hard to believe for brian to
[1:17:08] completely get out of the hospital
[1:17:10] it ain't hard to believe it ain't hard
[1:17:12] to believe that cancer be drove out
[1:17:14] of our pastor it ain't hard to believe
[1:17:17] that prodigals have come back
[1:17:18] it's not hard to believe it's not hard
[1:17:20] to worship
[1:17:21] because your belief set an atmosphere
[1:17:35] this sermon is about being aware
[1:17:38] being conscious of his presence
[1:17:41] gazelle wasn't he wasn't he wasn't aware
[1:17:45] but it's aware to you that there's
[1:17:47] somebody here
[1:17:50] you ought to be convinced you ought to
[1:17:52] be concerned about these things
[1:17:55] he's here there was a sister came
[1:17:59] through a prayer line one time
[1:18:01] and and and brother brandon was praying
[1:18:03] for and i believe that that the sister
[1:18:05] had a need of arthritis in her body
[1:18:07] and brother branham said that that
[1:18:09] arthritis was caused because of acid
[1:18:11] that was in her body
[1:18:12] and and the husband was taking the the
[1:18:15] wife through that prayer line
[1:18:17] and as she took her through there
[1:18:19] brother branham said that she began to
[1:18:20] fall into a trance
[1:18:22] and brother branham just went on to the
[1:18:23] next patient but brother madam came back
[1:18:25] to that gentleman about three days
[1:18:27] after that and he began to speak to him
[1:18:29] at his front door and he
[1:18:30] he had a conversation with him and he
[1:18:32] said he said brother branham he said
[1:18:34] something something's off with my wife
[1:18:37] and brother branson
[1:18:37] what's what's going on he said ever
[1:18:39] since you prayed for
[1:18:41] something's been going on she's been in
[1:18:42] like a trance and she'd been speaking
[1:18:45] about that
[1:18:45] that there was another man that was
[1:18:47] standing at the pulpit with you and
[1:18:49] and i kept telling her no no brother
[1:18:52] branham was the only one standing there
[1:18:54] and he said we'll say that again and he
[1:18:56] said well she
[1:18:57] she said there was another man standing
[1:18:59] there this woman had never heard about
[1:19:01] the testimony about the angel meeting
[1:19:02] him in the cave
[1:19:03] but this woman began to tell that there
[1:19:06] was another man standing there that had
[1:19:07] dark hair
[1:19:08] and was wearing a white robe and said
[1:19:10] that that man that was standing behind
[1:19:12] brother branham
[1:19:13] said he kept his eyes on brother branham
[1:19:15] the whole time and he said he
[1:19:16] that man looked over at me and said you
[1:19:18] come here because you have a need
[1:19:20] and you're wanting healing he said don't
[1:19:22] you worry you go on your road believing
[1:19:24] and you'll be healed
[1:19:25] he said but look at brother branham
[1:19:27] don't he look awful frail
[1:19:29] he said but don't worry he'll be soon
[1:19:32] after a while
[1:19:33] he's brother madam said that gave me
[1:19:34] great encouragement right there
[1:19:36] and said when brother branham prayed for
[1:19:38] that woman brother branham kneeled down
[1:19:40] to pray for her
[1:19:41] but that man just kept watching brother
[1:19:43] branham that whole time
[1:19:44] and when they took her off they took her
[1:19:47] off of that
[1:19:48] off of that platform as that lady said
[1:19:51] that that man
[1:19:52] followed me all the way out the door and
[1:19:54] that was the last time i seen him
[1:19:56] oh
[1:19:59] he follows you
[1:20:03] he sees you he's going to make sure you
[1:20:05] get it
[1:20:09] you see sometimes as a minister we get
[1:20:11] concerned
[1:20:12] we think man it just went over their
[1:20:14] head or they didn't get it but when i
[1:20:16] read that this morning
[1:20:18] oh it gave me great encouragement it set
[1:20:20] a fire down in my soul
[1:20:22] that angel is going to follow you home
[1:20:24] that agent was going to make sure you
[1:20:26] believe
[1:20:26] that angel's going to make sure you get
[1:20:28] healed that angel is going to make sure
[1:20:31] that thing gets restored
[1:20:34] they say my word this ain't a man's word
[1:20:37] this is him
[1:20:39] but this ain't some angel worship we
[1:20:41] don't we don't worship the angel
[1:20:46] maybe you don't understand that maybe
[1:20:49] you don't maybe you don't grasp that
[1:20:50] holy
[1:20:51] but brother branham said he said he said
[1:20:53] we don't worship that angel he's a
[1:20:54] matter of fact he said i don't even know
[1:20:56] is it
[1:20:56] i don't even know his name he said i
[1:20:58] don't pray in his name
[1:20:59] but anytime that that angel comes it's
[1:21:01] to bring the supernatural
[1:21:03] you can look at peter and you could see
[1:21:05] that the angel came and he got him out
[1:21:07] of prison
[1:21:08] you can see when paul was on his way
[1:21:09] down to macedonia and there was a
[1:21:11] shipwreck it was the angel that came and
[1:21:13] appeared to him
[1:21:14] and you remember over in the last book
[1:21:15] of the bible in john when john the
[1:21:17] revelator had finished writing those
[1:21:19] things
[1:21:20] that john fell down and worshiped the
[1:21:22] angel at his feet
[1:21:24] but the angel said worship god
[1:21:28] you see even brother burnham said i am
[1:21:30] not he
[1:21:32] but this is a message of him this ain't
[1:21:36] some angel worship
[1:21:37] this ain't some prophet worship this
[1:21:40] is the doing of the lord
[1:21:45] it's that angel that come when you watch
[1:21:47] over in
[1:21:48] in the book of exodus and you can see in
[1:21:50] the levitical law
[1:21:51] that when they when they upset god that
[1:21:54] god sent fiery serpents down there
[1:21:56] and he began to bite the people but god
[1:21:59] made
[1:22:00] a brazen serpent and he set that up on a
[1:22:03] pole
[1:22:03] for them to look at and what was it it
[1:22:06] was an angel on that pole
[1:22:08] that when they looked up there they
[1:22:10] would see the angel of healing
[1:22:12] that sin was already judged
[1:22:17] when you look in john chapter 5 when
[1:22:18] there was a hospital set up
[1:22:21] and there were people that were laid out
[1:22:23] all across that pool at the pool of
[1:22:25] bethesda
[1:22:26] when when the bible said that at a
[1:22:27] certain season there the water began to
[1:22:30] get troubled
[1:22:31] and he that stepped in the water first
[1:22:33] received healing
[1:22:35] what was it he was an angel that was on
[1:22:38] the water
[1:22:39] it wasn't the water it wasn't brother
[1:22:43] ron's hand
[1:22:44] it wasn't brother branham's hand it was
[1:22:46] the angel that was on the water
[1:22:50] it is in my preaching it's the angel in
[1:22:52] the atmosphere
[1:22:54] it's the holy spirit that's going to
[1:22:55] make sure that you come out just the way
[1:22:58] that he destined you to be like
[1:23:03] what happened it wouldn't be
[1:23:06] it would it would be just natural if the
[1:23:09] water just kept moving the way it was
[1:23:14] you wouldn't get stirred up because of
[1:23:16] water water just kept moving the way it
[1:23:18] was
[1:23:19] but when the angel came he made it
[1:23:21] completely go the other way
[1:23:23] oh come on somebody what was it
[1:23:27] when he come by your way you were going
[1:23:29] one way in the natural
[1:23:30] you were going one way and it didn't
[1:23:32] look like you were coming it looked like
[1:23:34] you were in a pit and you would never
[1:23:35] get up
[1:23:36] out of that thing but all of a sudden
[1:23:37] the angel came and struggled the water
[1:23:39] and it began to start a holy and a
[1:23:41] completely different way
[1:23:44] you'd have still been out in sin because
[1:23:46] sin was pleasurable for a season
[1:23:48] but because the supernatural came by
[1:23:50] your way
[1:23:51] he started turning the water and when he
[1:23:54] turned the water
[1:23:55] you started running back to him
[1:24:03] brother stephen right here probably one
[1:24:05] of the greatest men
[1:24:06] that i know one of the most powerful men
[1:24:09] but i didn't
[1:24:10] i didn't go over this with you before
[1:24:12] service and i apologize
[1:24:13] and i don't mean to embarrass you but
[1:24:14] he's one of the most powerful men that
[1:24:16] said in this building
[1:24:17] he don't hardly he don't hardly he don't
[1:24:19] hardly say enough
[1:24:21] he don't hardly say enough to even even
[1:24:23] talk your ears off but let me tell you
[1:24:24] that man's got an
[1:24:25] atmosphere about him and he was so
[1:24:29] and i could pick any of you but i just
[1:24:31] decided to pick him
[1:24:32] he was in front row you want to get
[1:24:34] picked out come down here
[1:24:36] i don't think that's why he's sitting
[1:24:37] down here but here this
[1:24:39] here this man he said when he come here
[1:24:42] when he come here for the first time
[1:24:43] maybe not the first time but a few times
[1:24:45] afterwards
[1:24:45] he come to me and said brother andrew he
[1:24:47] said he said i determined in my mind
[1:24:49] that i was going to go
[1:24:50] all over these different churches and i
[1:24:52] was going to find which one had truth
[1:24:54] he said i come here and i felt something
[1:24:57] and he said i felt that this was right
[1:24:58] he said i went to other churches he said
[1:25:00] but i come back to where truth was
[1:25:10] what was it it wasn't the flesh
[1:25:14] it was a spirit that was identified that
[1:25:16] there's something laying down on the
[1:25:18] inside of that
[1:25:19] and that atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:25:21] went by his way
[1:25:23] but ain't god good he didn't just stop
[1:25:26] it brother stephen
[1:25:27] but he went on down to sister terror
[1:25:32] when other men turned it down and they
[1:25:34] said hey
[1:25:35] i don't want nothing to do with that
[1:25:37] there sets brother greg
[1:25:38] there says brother stephen because the
[1:25:41] holy ghost
[1:25:42] is after his seed
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:52] lord help me lord help me
[1:26:06] what is it what are you looking for
[1:26:09] what are you looking for in church
[1:26:13] looking for a 15-minute sermon yeah go
[1:26:16] get it here
[1:26:17] i'm sorry you're looking for 45 minutes
[1:26:21] of worship
[1:26:22] 10 minutes of a preacherette bringing a
[1:26:24] sermonette
[1:26:26] to a bunch of christianettes you ain't
[1:26:27] gonna find it here
[1:26:31] but if you're looking for a troubling of
[1:26:32] the waters
[1:26:38] holy spirit keeps coming time and time
[1:26:41] again
[1:26:41] and telling you this is the spot you
[1:26:44] don't understand where it's at but
[1:26:46] maybe maybe you walk in here and you
[1:26:47] might forget one of these services but
[1:26:49] one of these times
[1:26:50] you just keep coming i don't get excited
[1:26:53] brother ron don't get excited because
[1:26:54] somebody walks in here and they walk
[1:26:56] away with the same type of baggage we
[1:26:57] don't get excited
[1:26:58] because we know one time one time in
[1:27:02] these waters
[1:27:03] you watch all that baggage get stripped
[1:27:05] off you watch those young people
[1:27:07] get so filled with the holy ghost that
[1:27:09] it'll make your parents get filled with
[1:27:10] the holy ghost
[1:27:11] you watch young people get on fire for
[1:27:14] god and you watch the rest of the church
[1:27:16] get on fire for god
[1:27:26] god's building a church building a
[1:27:30] church
[1:27:30] built upon the revelation of who he is
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:40] let me read this let me read this quote
[1:27:42] and i'm going to bring it to a close
[1:27:46] he said truly the pool is troubled the
[1:27:48] waters are whirling backwards when a
[1:27:50] natural show in the supernatural
[1:27:51] he said the holy spirit's here taking a
[1:27:53] normal bunch of people
[1:27:59] intelligent setting here well-dressed
[1:28:01] well-educated looking
[1:28:03] and the holy spirit fall upon them and
[1:28:05] something whirls them around and they
[1:28:06] holler
[1:28:07] glory to god hallelujah what's the
[1:28:10] matter
[1:28:10] it's the troubling of the water amen
[1:28:13] sinners sitting there backsliders
[1:28:15] prostitutes
[1:28:16] drunkards and everything else are
[1:28:19] saintly godly
[1:28:20] you can't put a finger on their lives
[1:28:22] anywhere since they received it
[1:28:25] it's the troubling of the waters
[1:28:29] now now i know i know that there's a lot
[1:28:32] of people that don't understand the way
[1:28:34] you
[1:28:34] work they don't understand what makes
[1:28:36] you tick
[1:28:37] they don't understand why you worship
[1:28:39] the way you worship
[1:28:40] and they get a little bit bothered
[1:28:43] because of that
[1:28:44] they get they get bothered because all
[1:28:46] that shouting
[1:28:48] i'm dead on right here they get bothered
[1:28:50] by all that shout and they don't
[1:28:51] understand that
[1:28:52] but you see the presence of god is not
[1:28:55] shouting
[1:28:56] the presence of god is actually it's a
[1:28:59] worrisome thing it's
[1:29:00] it's a very tiresome thing the the
[1:29:03] presence of god
[1:29:04] but that shouting is the blessings of
[1:29:07] god that's coming upon the people
[1:29:09] that's being poured out it's an
[1:29:11] identifying
[1:29:12] that the holy spirit is present when you
[1:29:15] watch
[1:29:15] that people when you watch that people
[1:29:19] when they go to shouting it's
[1:29:21] identifying that the presence of god
[1:29:24] has come down and he's spoken and may go
[1:29:27] to shout
[1:29:28] what are they saying about it's the
[1:29:31] blessings
[1:29:32] of almighty god that's being poured out
[1:29:37] and you thought man alive they just
[1:29:39] excited no
[1:29:40] they getting everything they came for
[1:29:42] they looked up there in the medicine
[1:29:44] cabinet
[1:29:45] and they began to shout and said hey
[1:29:46] that's got my name on it that's
[1:29:51] i got something to shout about god
[1:29:53] decided to bless me today
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:30:05] you see where god is there's always
[1:30:08] supernatural
[1:30:09] because he is supernatural there's a lot
[1:30:12] of people that don't understand
[1:30:14] they don't understand the supernatural
[1:30:15] they don't understand the effects
[1:30:17] they don't understand the effects of
[1:30:18] that angel
[1:30:21] and actually some of them walk off they
[1:30:24] walk off and leave some of them turn up
[1:30:25] her nose so i don't want nothing to do
[1:30:27] with that i'll be careful what you say
[1:30:28] right there
[1:30:31] i said well i seen that person shouting
[1:30:34] and
[1:30:35] i say different on facebook i see that
[1:30:37] person shout let me tell you
[1:30:38] you watch one time when the blessings of
[1:30:40] god come down and you watch that person
[1:30:41] change
[1:30:44] be careful be careful
[1:30:47] facebook can fool you but this book will
[1:30:49] never fool you
[1:30:54] where that comes from
[1:30:57] some people get excited so hey i seen
[1:30:59] that young person they did this that and
[1:31:01] the other i i
[1:31:02] i seen that person man they got moved in
[1:31:04] that service or they got moving i'm not
[1:31:06] just talking about last service i'm
[1:31:07] talking about all
[1:31:08] services there's people that look at it
[1:31:10] and they say well hey i i don't know i
[1:31:11] see a lot of bogus people sitting there
[1:31:14] you know i see them do one thing out on
[1:31:15] the street let me tell you you come
[1:31:17] one time one good time he can turn a
[1:31:20] bogus into a reality
[1:31:23] there's a lot of people that get excited
[1:31:25] and i'm doing some pastoral preaching
[1:31:26] right here
[1:31:27] but there's a lot of people that get
[1:31:29] excited because hey they see
[1:31:30] something and they get all excited so
[1:31:32] well you know i know a little bit
[1:31:33] differently
[1:31:34] but i i remember i'm reminded when the
[1:31:37] prophet said i'd
[1:31:38] rather have a little wildfire than no
[1:31:40] fire at all
[1:31:44] let me tell you i've seen a lot of
[1:31:45] boguses too but it's only proof that
[1:31:48] there's a real one that's out there
[1:31:51] what we do the bible said that we ought
[1:31:54] to lay aside every weight
[1:31:55] and sin that does so easily beside us
[1:31:58] and run this race with patience
[1:32:00] the race that is set before us but the
[1:32:03] trouble is
[1:32:04] too many times we stop on the side of
[1:32:06] the road to see some social thing
[1:32:08] or get up mixed up with the world and
[1:32:10] some people stop and say well you know
[1:32:12] what
[1:32:12] you know what you know what i i i don't
[1:32:15] know
[1:32:16] i don't know if i can handle that i i
[1:32:18] don't know i don't know if i can do that
[1:32:19] they just stop they stop right there and
[1:32:22] say wait a minute
[1:32:23] i don't want to get fanatical about this
[1:32:25] thing
[1:32:27] i you know i'm stopping to make sure
[1:32:29] there ain't no fanatic out there brother
[1:32:31] branham said i'm more afraid
[1:32:32] of the person that's afraid than the
[1:32:34] person that's a fanatic
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:39] oh i'm a fool for jesus who's for you
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:45] hallelujah you just hang on you just
[1:32:49] hang on
[1:32:51] you just keep hanging on you see
[1:32:52] something here you don't like you just
[1:32:53] keep coming back
[1:32:55] come and see a man that told me all the
[1:32:57] things
[1:32:58] that i had done in my past has a whole
[1:33:01] lot of bogus thing in my past
[1:33:03] but you come and see a man that told me
[1:33:06] all that i did
[1:33:07] is this not the very messiah
[1:33:15] i'm not trying to preach to you
[1:33:17] something just to get you emotional
[1:33:18] and i'm not trying and i'm coming down
[1:33:20] because i i've got a lot of things
[1:33:22] i got a lot of things that people get
[1:33:24] excited about especially on the internet
[1:33:27] they get excited because they think that
[1:33:29] that preachers are just working people
[1:33:31] up
[1:33:32] that people that that brother ron surely
[1:33:35] surely brother ron had a meeting before
[1:33:37] the internet got caught on and told him
[1:33:38] that you know you ought to stand up
[1:33:41] you know you ought to just get excited
[1:33:44] about the word you know
[1:33:45] that's a devil that's a devil
[1:33:54] if your preacher had something to preach
[1:33:55] about you'd be upon your feet too
[1:34:17] it's the word that brings the people to
[1:34:20] the feet
[1:34:21] it's the word that makes them act like
[1:34:23] that it's the word that causes them to
[1:34:25] shout
[1:34:26] it's a word that causes cancer to leave
[1:34:28] it's the word
[1:34:29] it's not me it's not the preacher it's
[1:34:32] the word that drives out demons
[1:34:35] it's not the laying on of my hands but
[1:34:37] it's a promise
[1:34:38] that's behind that word
[1:34:41] [Applause]
[1:34:44] i found what i was looking for when i
[1:34:45] found jesus
[1:34:47] and to jesus i know he can heal your
[1:34:49] body
[1:34:50] he can set your mind free the jesus i
[1:34:53] know
[1:34:53] is not the god of the world but the
[1:34:55] jesus i know is good enough to save the
[1:34:58] lost
[1:34:58] the jesus i know heals cancer
[1:35:02] the jesus i know comforts the hearts
[1:35:07] he's a mender of the broken heart
[1:35:12] i believe we're very aware that there's
[1:35:14] something greater than ourselves here
[1:35:17] as the musicians come
[1:35:22] darius had to recognize that there was
[1:35:26] something a whole lot greater
[1:35:30] than just a man there
[1:35:36] he didn't tried everything and there was
[1:35:38] a woman in front of him that tried
[1:35:40] everything
[1:35:42] but one time recognizing that presence
[1:35:46] made her drop all that she had crawled
[1:35:49] through all the critics that had
[1:35:51] made fun of her she spent all of her
[1:35:53] living
