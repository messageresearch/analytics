of you this morning I always think Sunday morning is so special and well what a service we had here last night [Music] and we're going to have a baby dedication today first of all I want to say how glad we are to have brother Kenny with us his Widowmaker was stopped up third 98 percent and God rich in his Mercy they were able to put a stent through that and he's sitting here and that just happened just a few days ago and he's sitting here with us this morning and amen and we are so thankful for that brother brother Kenny our prayers have been with you and you've got a good nurse sitting beside of you I commissioned her to take care of you that's a big deal right there boy amen and so God bless you brother Kenny we sure will love you with all of our hearts and say that behind our backs behind your back and we sure love you with all of our hearts and amen for the clearance we we are sure praying for your family and uh we were we were honored to be able to stand for Eugene and uh and for the family there Loretta his wife and and we were honored to lead him to the Lord he went to the same doctors had the same type of cancer that we we struggle with he he had had it about 14 months maybe and maybe a bit longer than that they gave him the same medicine the same type of treatments and the Lord chose to take him home and so and so we just are praying that for those that were at the funeral that God would strike their hearts they could turn their their focus towards the Lord and so that's what our our greatest focus is today and so turn our hearts toward him and so amen maybe this is your first service in the house of the Lord and maybe a little shouting might terrify you for a moment but you know we worship God the Jews worship God they stand and dance at the welding wall for all day long and so they did that for centuries and so people in the world go to ball games and they get all excited and the devil don't say anything about that but you you let somebody get excited in the house of the Lord and people get real nervous it's the devil that gets nervous brother biscoll we had a conversation one time as we were going into a meeting and he said brother Rhonda you get nervous I said I do I do get nervous as I'm getting ready to preach and he said I asked another great man one time about that brother Branham he said brother Brandon you get nervous he said oh yeah I get nervous he said I get nervous because of the responsibility of the word he said but another nervousness is the devil gets nervous Hallelujah because he knows he's getting ready to be defeated amen we're honored to be able to dedicate a little fella today he's named very special Enoch Joseph I thought about this as they have named him Enoch it's to be their last child unless God does something else and so is capable in your family so and so they've named their last child Enoch Enoch is a name of rapture we know that that Enoch walked with God it's a name of rapture Joseph was a type of Jesus Christ lived so perfect I was just a little one little blemish in his life he was born October the 18th my brother's birthday now people that are born under that sign our people that are people are very peaceful partnership is very important to them and their real family people and they'll like people that'll mirror themselves you so where brother Ron just is signs important absolutely that's God's first Bible and you're born under your side and if you look at if you look at your sign the date that you're born under it'll actually tell your life story the scripture says in Deuteronomy chapter 6 and verse 4. hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and doubt shall love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou set us in thy house and thou shalt walk and when thou walkest by the way and when thou lies down and when thou lies riseth up I thought of this scripture as for you [Music] except the Lord build a house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city the Watchman waketh but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early and to set up late deep breath of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep Lo children are an inheritance of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a Mighty Man so are children of the youth happy is the man that half his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed

after I preached there after I just got the diagnosis and we had been called that we had cancer and we had the meeting and I preached courage go wash and take it back and we go to brother Tom Ray's house and we're all fellowshipping together it's probably 70 people there and I'm standing at the fireplace and I'm standing beside brother Murphy Wong and brother Murphy is standing there you'll enjoy this we're standing beside brother Murphy and brother Murphy's we're there and I said brother Murphy I see a child and he was thinking in his mind him and his wife Tracy he said oh no brother Ryan and I said I just see the vision of it I said no it's your daughter what we didn't know was his daughter it was impossible for them to have children you know God likes impossibilities you can't tell God it's impossible so this is both sets of grandparents brother Louise and sister Shirley and they're really proud of that only grand baby amen and brother Murphy and sister Tracy God knows how to take care of impossibilities what was a vision now is a reality give God a great big hand thank you for those that don't believe God does those things anymore we just say Satan you're alive amen amen amen all we are is a tool in the hand of the Lord amen so when God shows you a vision you you declare it you stand on it you have faith to believe it foreign I had a very emotional experience this week God deals with me in the night I thought Connie had her hand on my leg and I I know that we've been married a long time and that's just not what she does it was about four o'clock in the morning and I propped up and I looked and the angel of the Lord was setting on the bed and had his hand on my leg I thought that was pretty special laughs he's with us amen amen any good to us the doctors told me this week stay on the course your labs are looking good got a good report continue to take the chemo of course they believe I'll take it the rest of my life and if that's the way it is and that's the way God chooses I am okay but I believe for a miracle and they're working on the support drugs to try to help me out that we're having some we're having some issues on the sideline and and so their their doctors are trying to help me and uh and so weird they said over the next six weeks it should begin to help and so they've changed some meds up for us and thank you for your prayers thank you for your continued prayers those that are on the internet that pray for us thank you for that and uh I I danced over here just a bit ago because I think I think I'm still standing here two and a half years later Satan swore he would kill me and here we're still standing and so amen God bless you if you'll stand to with me to your feet thank you for your your your help with us I want to speak today are kind of along the same sideline that we've been speaking on I find I I find no fault but I want to speak today on we stand with a declaration I want to read the first scripture that we'll read and then you can be seated and I'm going to give you one scripture after another second Thessalonians chapter 3 and verse 13. and this is a very important scripture how many have you ever felt frustrated intimidated wore out yep I'm speaking to the right group but ye brethren we consider that ourselves part of that be not wary in well-doing I want you to read that with me but ye brethren be not weary in well-doing may the Lord bless the word this evening you can be seated Philippians chapter 3 and verse 14 I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus in Matthew chapter 28 and verse 18 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power say that with me all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth in John chapter 15 and verse 17 sister Stephanie sorry we're giving you a workout if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you sometimes we expect things and we forgot to ask for it Revelations chapter 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne Romans chapter 8 and verse 31. what shall we then say to these things I want you to read this with us if God before us who can be against us let's say it again if God be for us who can be against us I wanted to reckon I wanted to remind you God had sent his message he has sent his prophet the bride is on the scene and there's nothing can stop this Jesus is coming the resurrection is going to happen dead Saints are going to come out of the ground and there's nothing that the devil can do to stop it Hallelujah and I want to remind Satan he has been a philosopher of the scriptures all of these decades and even centuries and he knows that Jesus is coming and the resurrection is at hand and the Rapture of the church is getting ready to take place and he cannot stop it brother random is going to speak in 1965 invisible Union of the Bride it's one of the most powerful sermons of all the message in a few hours his lips will be sealed we would term his the greatest Prophet that ever lived on the Earth he's one to a generation he is a prophet to where that God will unfold the word to the bride the seals will be revealed the Thunders will be revealed the mysteries of God will be revealed everything that was hidden in the Bible will be revealed he is praying in this sermon and I want to just take a moment to just share this with you oh God knowing seeing how fragile we are knowing that we're walking on the brittle threads of the life of this Mortal life not knowing what time that we're going to be summoned to answer on high literally these are some of the last sermons he'll preach his lips will be sealed not knowing let us O Lord lay aside everything in her heart everything in our mind looks straight to your word tonight for you to come and interpret it living oracles Granite may your spirit fall on us anoint the word to our heart what that we might go from hence this evening people that are that are that we are that we might have a closer Insight on Jesus Christ granted Lord that we might understand the day that we're living in and the preparation of God for his people in this hour this great crucial dark time that we're now living in God anoint us not only as a speaker but hero and together might our hearts tremble at your word for the fear of the god is the beginning of the wisdom Grant these things father for we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen he said I'd like to title these few remarks that I was going to make here and some scriptures I'd like to follow up closely if the Lord is willing the Thanksgiving message to the invisible Union of the bride of Christ I'd like for you as a body of Believers to go listen to that this week he said I'm thankful to God to be living in the time of the closing Saints of the world's history I don't know if if I would have had a say-so before the foundation of the world and if God would have laid out the whole program to me and said to me I want you to preach and now what age do you desire to go to to the Earth to preach I would have chosen this age I'd like to make this declaration today I would have chosen this age it's a golden age I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of the visit his visit to the Earth but still I think right now is the greatest times because it's a time that he's coming to take a people that he's redeemed I'm part of that sentence nearing the resurrection when all the redeemed will come forth and our loved ones are a part of that sentence what a glorious opportunity that we have to speak to a dying people a great time we're enthused about it and we know that history is closing out and the world's history will soon be over and then we're going to step into a new day to a new great Millennium as one believer I believe in a millennium a millennium reign of Christ A Thousand Years upon the Earth the physical Return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood Give the Lord a great big hand right there huh he was a man when he was dying on the cross crying for mercy he said that's right but he was God on Easter morning when he broke that seal what's in the Tomb and he rose up and ascended on high ever living to make the intercession every man woman that's ever amounted to a hill of beings believe that he's the same yesterday and forever believeth thou this yes sir he is just as great right here among us tonight as he was then last night I thought was a pivotal sermon for you to be an overcomer take that sermon and listen to it over and over again elalon lives on the inside of us he is our healer but brother Ron you're you're standing there with fourth stage cancer you're taking chemo every day doesn't matter it does not matter because Satan with all of his forces cannot take my life [Applause] he said be persistent Hold Your Position in Christ hold your confession hold fast your confession in Christ how important is that that's our declaration today I am identified with Jesus Christ [Applause] Jesus saith unto him no man that having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God this is one of my favorite scriptures and you've heard it thousands of times year of God little children and I've overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world this is one of my favorite quotes God's purpose can never be defeated I want you to say that with me God's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing that can defeat it so how happy we ought to be today rest upon a beautiful revelation of the Living God that there's neither things present nor things to come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no pearls nothing can separate us for the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there's no power there's nothing that can separate God from his great Immortal interpretal Eternal plan it's going to be just as he said it [Applause] God deposited his eternal seed of life on the inside of you Timothy there's no issues of life there's no devil in hell can take that out of you go ahead and give him a praise right now we're in the season just before the coming we're seeing blending of dimensions purple hair blue hair Sodom and Gomorrah everywhere no moral no moral function whatsoever politics is rotten the sports world is rotten governments are rotten everything is rotten education's at its end teachers cannot teach moral values anymore matter of fact you can't discipline your own children the mouth of hell has enlarged itself but in all of that we make our stand [Applause] God knew in this day there would be a pride that refused to compromise that refuses to be polished up by the world that refuses a watered-down gospel that refuses to be a mixer of the world but we will take our stand the Stop and roll our shoulders back and take courage God's with us if God be for us who can be against us be strong of good courage we'll believe us we're Sons and Daughters of God we fight you may not put a poster on your back you may not put a sign up but you tell the devil you're not welcome in my home you're not welcome with my children you're not welcome in my job cubicle this is where I serve God and I will serve God until I die I'm not building I'm not bowing and I'm not going back he shelters us under his wings he fights our battles he wins our Wars we cast out Satan with Holy Ghost boldness he has authorized us to take our tongue which is the most Supernatural thing about us and take the word of life and speak a world into creation I'm not talking about the sun moon and stars but you can have peace in your marriage you can't have love in your home now give him a hand right there you can have children that respect you I'm not talking about being a dictator but you can be a leader to where your children can look up to you you can live an overcoming life you can't have a home of Prayer we will not maybe we will defeat Satan [Applause] we are an invincible Army it's more than just a word or a or a quote or a good thought we are an invincible Army that will stand on this Earth if there's any bride that's prepared we are God has given us everything at his disposal he didn't hold nothing back brother Ron but we have wars yep we do it may hurt for a while we may be sick for a while but we win [Applause] I want to say we
