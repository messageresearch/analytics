honor and Glory as we give our lives to you [Music] amen amen God bless you it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord this evening it's always an honor and a privileged privilege to be able to stand before you and speak about the unchanging God that we serve the living word amen he's the living bread that came down from heaven and that's what we're feasting on you know we're not giving our own opinions and and we don't just give what we think and or you know opinions we're given the word of the Lord amen if you'll turn with me to your Bibles thank you musicians to Matthew chapter 27. we'll begin with verse 15. then Hebrews 13 8 which will be familiar to most of us you may not even have to turn there but Matthew 27 verse 15 will begin reading blessed be the name of the Lord there's no other place I'd rather be than in the house of God amen verse 15 now at the Feast at that Feast the governor was want to release and to the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that I release unto you Barabbas or Jesus which is called Christ for he knew that for Envy they had delivered him when he was set down on the Judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for I have suffered many things as day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and Elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas and Destroy Jesus think about that the chief priest the most respected religious order of that day they actually persuaded the multitude to ask for Barabbas and Destroy Jesus the governor answered and said it to them whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you they said Barabbas pilate saith unto them what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ they all say unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing but rather a tumlet was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person see to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children then released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified then Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen God bless you as you're seated if I take a text this this evening I'd like to title this what will you do with this word called the message what will you do with this word call the message we hear that term a lot but we have to recognize that Jesus Christ is the anointed word for the day Christ means the anointed one in verse 22 I want to emphasize pilate saith unto them what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ was the anointed word of the day and pilate is asking them a very very pivotal question he said What then shall I do if you want Barabbas and you don't want the Prince of Life if you don't want the word for your day What then shall I do with this Jesus called the anointed one and they all said let him be crucified we know that history repeats itself the secular world even knows that when studying history you can even you can even study secular history and you can understand that history repeats itself history repeats itself we find that even nature excuse me even in nature you see the same thing every season whenever the Earth is in a certain rotation the distance from the Sun the same season happens when Springtime comes you can expect life to come forth in the Autumn you can expect the life to start going into the roots why because it's a repetition so whenever God the scripture also repeats itself so when things are in the same scriptural order you can look back in the scripture and see that what happened 2 000 years ago is actually repeating the same today scriptural history repeats itself because the word in letter could not redeem us the faith of the promise that you believed unto that promise you believe the Messiah was coming and that justified you but it took Jesus to actually come and bleed and die and to redeem us it took the blood of Jesus Christ to redeem us it could not save us while it was still in letter form it had to become manifested it had to be Vindicated and then it could be a Redemption for our sins when Isaiah 53 could not redeem us until he became flesh and blood when Isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive and the Virgin did not conceive you at 700 years or so he could not have redeemed us but whenever that word that was swirling around brother Jerry found a place in a young teenage virgin and then Jesus came through the process of time in the Virgin and was actually born Emmanuel God himself he could then live and breathe and die for your sins and he could then die from my sins you see he had to become flesh in order to come and pay the price Malachi 4 and all these scriptures of this message in Revelations 10 7 and Luke 17 30 could not prepare the bride could not call out a bride could not even prepare us for a Rapture until it became manifested if God would not have sent his Prophet we would not be sitting in this church right now most of us would not be in any church right now but it had to come off of the letter get into God's chosen vessels and then God could be it could benefit us God could then call out a bride do you see brother Graham said when the word has been spoken for this certain generation there's going to be somebody rise on the scene that'll fulfill that word because God has spoken it's a Vindication of the spoken word do you realize that the bride is the actual Vindication of this message he said that the Bible said that there would be a bride without spot and wrinkle is she on the Earth today can you testify that despite of all your mistakes despite of all your human failures that you see there is a bride on the earth without a single spot or wrinkle and it's not that no that another human don't see a spot or wrinkle it's God that doesn't see a spot or a wrinkle so that is the Vindication that the message is right because God said there'd be abroad well before they can be a brother there's got to be a restoration God has to send a prophet did he well here we are in John 1 14 in the beginning in first John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth he said think your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word now the Bible cannot bleed so why would a prophet make a statement that we're Washed by the Water of the bleeding word is because he came in flesh he was the word made flesh and that enabled the word to bleed for you because he was not the Blood of Mary he was not the blood of Joseph he was not the blood of a Jew he was not the blood of a gentile he was not the blood of the Samaritan he was the blood of God the prophet tells us that we are saved by the blood of God if we're saved by Jew if we're saved by Samaritan then we it's impossible we're all lost we are saved by the blood of God [Music] he said the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God and the word and the Word was bled for you now God has sent the greatest message to the Earth says Jesus Christ do you believe that tonight you think about it how many great men have lived on the earth throughout all the church ages and God has predestinated us to live in this end time and to be under under the voice of God the voice behind The Voice and to be a part of the greatest Ministry since Jesus Christ the prophet would even be bold enough to say that he did more miracles in his own Ministry talking about he said my humble Ministry than he did in his own 2000 years ago so how can there how can this generation be without an excuse how can this generation have an excuse when he would go around the world seven times forward and backward and God would have indicated and he'd preach the word you think of this challenge he would preach the word and he said if I've told you the truth then you let God come and vindicate it who what man would be brave enough to do that could you imagine it's July here and and someone and and brother Andrew's standing here and saying and and saying if it's if this is the truth it would be if this is the truth then it'd go outside there'll be snow and it's July but if God told him to say that it would be snow outside you see but I'm trying to just be extreme that no man can do that to be able to say after preaching the word if I have told you the truth let him come down right now and vindicate that what I've told you is the truth do you think when that when when brother Brown was in Oregon and that Maniac ran through the back door to break every bone in his body do you think that he within himself he might he might have been a boxer in his natural self but he couldn't compete that that guy was some heavyweight brother Brown might have been Bantam or feather or whatever whatever the classes are he was a little man but yet whenever he came you see then God came and Vindicated his prophet and he said today you'll fall over my feet what what five foot man could say something like that what five foot man could say that today you'll fall on my feet but God Vindicated that it wasn't a man God Vindicated that this message didn't come from the mind of a man if this message came from the mind of a man we're all lost if this message came from the mind of a man and we're just following the opinion then God have mercy this message is Jesus Christ he said speaking here and it is I be not afraid he said but I believe that Jesus Christ is here I believe he's here in every strength and everything that he ever was on the Earth the only difference is the Corporal body that sits on the throne of God and that's there as a peace offering for you he said this in 1960 true in 1962 and it was true then in 2022 it's true now you think Jesus Christ is here and he's here in every strength he's no weaker just because the prophet went home and everything he was ever on the earth he's still the same right here it's not just in this generation it's not just in 2022 but it's in this service and every strength he's the same in every strength God just needs an agency the agency God uses is just humble human vessels that that's that's all in Exodus 3 8 speaking of Moses he said and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey now here God said that I am come down but who did he send he sent Moses when you look you've seen Moses was in Egypt but God identified himself in the prophet to say that I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them God don't just bring you out of the world to leave you sitting there God brings us out of the world to then put us into him in our position that is redemption so if you notice Moses was not the one that led them over to the land of milk and honey it was the Joshua Ministry that did that but God identified himself with both he said I have come down to deliver them out of Egypt and to bring them into the land that was Moses and then Elijah but God still identified himself as being the one doing that in first Thessalonians 4 17 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the shout in that scripture think what a blessed people you are people all over the religious landscape of the world are expecting to hear this loud deafening trumpet or this loud shout or however they have it in their own mind and the shout is the message and you've heard it and if you really heard the message and you really are become a part of the shout then you're going to be part of the Resurrection you're in the rapture you're already in it you can't be in the shout and miss the Trump now the burden of vindication does not fall on you and me the burden of vindication does not even fall on the messenger the burden of indication falls on God himself it's not your job or our job to vindicate the message God's already done that we're not we're not climbing up in the mountains raising our hand for that sort of hit he's already done that the bride has got the sword in her hand we're not we're not looking for caves brother Jerry looking and just waiting to see if that angel will appear we believe the testimony we believe the testimony that got an angel met him why because we see the works God Vindicated it how many people were there with Moses in the burning bush not one but when Moses said I met the pillar of fire I met the I am and this is what he told me to do and they seen it to disbelieve that sign with sin in the church age book don't you love the church age book brother Graham said though he's talking about the seventh Church age messenger he said though he will not be popular he will be Vindicated by God as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well expect this man will first of all uh first of all authenticated by the spirit working in his life in Acts of power that are indisputable and found nowhere else you had carnal impersonations but you couldn't find the movement of the spirit like you could in the prophet's Ministry in this capacity and Jesus himself in returning will authenticate him even as he authenticated John John witnessed that Jesus was coming and so will this man like John witness that Jesus is coming and the Very return of Christ will prove that this man indeed was the Forerunner of a second coming this is the final evidence that this indeed is the prophet of Malachi 4 for the end of the Gentile period will be Jesus himself appearing then it will be too late for those who have rejected him think about that that will be the final evidence that brother Brandon was Malachi 4. is when Jesus comes Jesus himself was the Vindication of John the Baptist ministry Jesus himself is the Vindication of the truth and accuracy of this message it don't have to be embellished by man it don't have to be pumped up it don't have to be propped up it don't have to be faked it is reality and Jesus whenever John you know it wasn't to John or like I said it wasn't to John the Baptist or brother Branham they they didn't have to wring their hands in stress when John said that there's common one after me it did not stress or concern him about whether the Messiah would appear or not he said he who told me to baptize said upon whom you'll see the Holy Ghost descending and remaining on he's the Lamb of God so when he was preaching he did not get anxious and all worried if Jesus was really coming was the Messiah going to come he just did his job and Jesus when Jesus came whenever they were questioning him are you the Messiah and all these different things and he was baptized and in one day as he was baptized and he looked and he seen a man come in a common looking man coming down the river to be baptized and he said I have need to be baptized of thee Jesus said suffer it to be so Jesus himself God in flesh brother Jonathan was the very Vindication that John foreign his first coming it was God and flesh Jesus God Vindicated John the Baptist ministry himself he didn't need religious people he didn't need anybody else he himself he had a humble Forerunner and he himself stepped into the water and then he began his ministry the message produces what it preaches that's the Vindication as I said earlier did the message preach that there's a bride that the message is the bridegroom call and is there a bride on the earth that's the vindication that the message what it teaches and what it preaches is reality there there's good people all over the world I'm not don't don't misunderstand that I'm trying to say if someone doesn't believe the message and they're just not in the economy of God they can still be in the economy of God but we're talking about the bride that that that's why I believe I'm preaching to is the bride that's who we're talking about is the bride so when the bride being on Earth this message produces lives above reproach the word what it says where you've got multitudes and multitudes of people that cannot live this word from the laity to the ministry they cannot live the word but the bride can live it why because it's the holy ghost in her vindicating the word living out the word through their lives we cannot live this message in this Bible through ourselves but it's the Holy Ghost in US and that is the Vindication of it let me tell you something this message produces the cream of the crop this message produces the best preachers this message produces the best Brothers the best sisters the best families the best marriages the best children this message produces it the best glory to God we're not held all all these different best I just named were not held together by something that somebody said in 1963. it's not some Dr Phil or or whoever Dr Dobson and it just steps to try and get better this is reality this message doesn't just live at church this message goes home and lives it lives on Monday it lives on Tuesday it lives on Wednesday it lives all the way through it's not just it's not just for church the angel that met brother Branham in the cave and explained the three pulls of the ministry it happened just like he said brother brand will describe a pillar of fire and in 1933 while baptizing the 17th person it came down in front of witnesses God appeared in the cloud over Arizona there showing the fully wigged one why because we're living in an hour of judgment now remember to you it was Shalom relax peace I've come down and I'm going to take care of everything I fully redeemed you Ruth but to the world a prophet picked up a rock and he threw it in the air and he said thus saith the Lord judgment is going to strike the West Coast how can a man within himself ever say a thing like that but three days later or so Alaska almost sunk and what happened that began a judgment cycle on this nation in the world that hasn't stopped since but to you it's peace to you it's love to you it's Mercy to you it's thank you Lord but to the world is judgment he said I wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river he said I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfectly as they are I'm only the one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the Angel's message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on he's the one that we preach you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man now it's pretty obvious that if if this word of this message was not Vindicated by a man then why in the world can it be discredited by man why if God Vindicated it then what makes a man or woman what makes a person think that they can come around and discredit this message when God was the one that came down God was the one that came in a pillar of fire they didn't stand there and discern the hearts of the thoughts of the intent of Sarah's heart God did that they're not going to change your body God's going to change your body God Vindicated it God's watching over it God has manifested it and God will take it home one day God's going to take this little bride home a man can discredit this message I said when Moses met the pillar firing a burning bush there were no Witnesses nobody was there but they seemed and that let out two million or more people faith in that but you see whenever whenever Moses went down there and he performed at first miracle one of the first there when the river turned to blood you know Pharaoh at first you know he you've seen the Ten Commandments he kind of feared at first a little bit but then a news article came out and said actually it wasn't Supernatural a volcano all so many miles away blew up and and the mud spewed into the river and that's what caused it so your God is nothing special this message that you're believing this first Exodus message is nothing special a volcano did that so we see that same Spirit don't die remember history repeats itself the Pharisees after the resurrection of Jesus do you know that was the Easter seal his resurrection if Jesus didn't raise from the dead every all the Miracles all the words all the teaching and preaching would not have amounted to anything had he not rose from the dead that's what the prophet said that sealed it because that proved that he was more than a man so the Pharisees after he rose from the dead the Pharisees no doubt had written notarized confessions of the soldiers that they were paid that that they were paid to to keep quiet while the disciples came and stole the body of Jesus and and and and here it right here is the written confession here's a written confession of a Roman soldier that that the disciples came and stole them I don't care what the devil produces I don't care what article and what accusation the critic produces we have the Holy Ghost today because he rose from the dead that's how I know that's how you know you know brother Shannon that he rose from the dead because if he didn't rise from the dead you couldn't have the Holy Ghost that's the Vindication of it that he rose from the dead you don't have to it's a blessing to go see the empty tomb but what you have to know that he rose from the dead is when he vindicates it is when you get the Holy Ghost it would be impossible to have the Holy Ghost if he didn't raise from the dead so here we are and the word has been Vindicated the seven Thunders have awoke the bride to recognize who she is this is different than just other Church ages this is different from different churches because we have been awakened to the fact that there's a Rapture at hand Jesus said in John 15 if I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin think about how powerful that is if I didn't come and actually preach the truth to you you could have kept going on and you wouldn't have had any sin he said but now they have no cloak for their sin he that hateth me hateth the father also if I had not and I think history repeats itself think about the day we're living in If I had not done among them The Works which no other man did they had not had sin but now they have both seen and hated both me and my father when the prophet of God was here and he'd they were don't think he didn't have critics but many times they were they wouldn't dare come they would always talk behind his back that's just that that's just like a devil that's just like the devil he waited till God arrested in the Garden of Eden to come and spoil the masterpiece that's just like a devil so the prophet of God they would criticize him on Jesus name baptism wouldn't they and he stood before 300 preachers that's more than what we probably have sitting in this church right now but let's just say because this is a visual say every single one three three hundred preachers and he said I know what you have against me he said but one of you come up here take your Bible not your church green not your pamphlet not your own idea not your own opinion you take your Bible and come Stand By Me and You disprove Jesus name baptism you come and you disprove serpency not one of a move not one of a move why because they couldn't resist it they could not resist the Vindication of the word then they say they're gonna all come get baptized but how many came not one not one so if the message had not come and taught true baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they would have they had not had sinned but now they have no cloak for their sin if the original sin didn't expose Satan's serpent seed if that had not been revealed they would have a cloak for their sin but now they have no cloak for their sin do you see the word is open there's no more excuse if the word didn't actually expose that denominationalism was the mark of the beast now not the people not the people but the system there's a big difference the system that's why the message calls come out of her my people so if Jesus hadn't exposed that in this end time they would not have sinned but now they have no cloak for their sin but you know back then when Jesus was on the Earth when he would do Miracles and things and he would be teaching they were discrediting him all the time they said we don't know about you Jesus healed the blind man he said we don't we don't know about this Jesus we're Moses's disciple where Moses's disciple and Jesus said for if he had believed me he would have if you would have believed Moses you'd believe me for he wrote Of Me what do people say today we're Jesus's disciple we're Paul's disciple well if you would believe Jesus he spoke of the Prophet coming if you believe Paul he spoke of the message coming foreign he said here in the spoken word's Original Seed he said let me say this not sacrilegious but let me say this about the message that I'm preaching if God don't vindicate this to be the truth then it's not isn't that so simple if God doesn't vindicate it and he just delivered it he said if God doesn't vindicate this to be the truth then it's not you talk about a man knowing where he's standing but if the word vindicates I'm telling you the truth then believe the word they are what testify whether I'm telling the truth or not they're the testimony he promised this for the in the last days here it is he said that it would do here it is we're going right into it now you'll see whether it's the truth or not let God do the testifying see how he just put it in the hands of God he knew where he stood and he knew that God would come behind him and say Amen he says here it is we're going into it right now let God do the testifying if the works the things that I'm preaching don't testify back that it's the truth and it's not the truth but if the word speaks of this and here it is then what are you going to do about it see he gets it and he puts it back in our laps that's the spirit of Elijah when he was on Mount Carmel he he said you know let's y'all you know Israel you'll worshiping Bell let's let's prove this matter if God be God let him show up now Elijah knew where he was standing he wouldn't have done that brother and said without a vision the bride knows where she stands the Bride is a mature lady she's not tossed around she's not tossed from Pillar To Post she knows that she's missed Jesus Christ in John 10 Jesus speaking said if I do not the works of my father Believe Me Not but if I do though you believe me not believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me denying him now God vindicates his word amen God vindicates his word and he sent his Prophet around the Earth and Vindicated his the message God's message seven times and despite all the infallible proofs despite all the Vindication despite all the Miracles despite all all the word the world still rejected it this is a rejected speaking in the world this is a rejected message it's a hated message why because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if Jesus was rejected then why would he why would we expect the whole world to accept him now if he does the same Works he preaches the same word and does everything the world rejects him whenever brother was trying to go into Africa to win souls for Jesus Christ the denominational churches literally blocked him from doing that they literally banned it they hated that Jesus name baptism they hated what he preached so much that they banded together and they United themselves together against the word just as the Pharisees and all the religious world of that day United themselves with the government to crucify Jesus because there's got to be a uniting with something and so the bride is uniting with Jesus Christ so God had his Prophet on the Earth and he had his Prophet preach a sermon that I'd recommend you go listen to called the indictment now an indictment means a formal charge or accusation of a serious crime and in God's Prophet indicted the churches for the second crucifixion of the word he said how he said you how do you crucify the word you can't drive nail spikes into the word you can't get the word and nail it to a cross he said he's crucified from the denominational pulpits because whenever the ministry would come into town they would warn the people from the pulpits and say don't go there he has fanaticism don't believe that and they didn't realize that they were actually killing their own people spiritually when they were doing that so after that went on for a long time and God gave him the gave brother bran the permission to stand up he said I'm his attorney and he said that I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ because they did they took the same Lord Jesus Hebrews 13 8. they did the same Works preached the same word rejected it and as I said nailed it to a cross from their denominational pulpits and told the people not to hear the prophet and today we're standing in another polished judgment Hall now not a Jesus of 2000 years ago but the Jesus of today now let me just say this in here whenever you whenever you hear the name Jesus that can bring many different things you know Jesus what he did or maybe how he walked the shores of Galilee maybe how he suffered maybe how he loved maybe how he prayed for the children maybe how he healed the lepers but what we have to understand is that whenever we speak of Jesus Christ the anointed word it's not the man from 2000 years ago it's also the word anointed today you see just as the religious people from 2000 years ago could look back and say we love Moses we're Moses's disciples it was easy to look back and they crucified the god of Moses the very Pillar of Fire that led Moses they put on a tree and hung him so now what does the world do I love Jesus I love Jesus 2000 years ago I love Jesus but they crucify the word you see it's it's not the Jesus of 2000 years ago but today because remember he's the same in power he's the same in word he's the same indeed he's the same in Miracles he's the same in every way but his literal body so that is Jesus Christ is in the form of his bride she is the man about everyone says she's the manifestation of the hour so this message just as Jesus was 2000 years ago is attacked scoffed criticized beat slap spit upon they attack the pillar of Fire they attack the pillar fires as old you know that that was just the light in the in the building and it was just the angle lights in a building don't come and discern your heart lights in a building don't come and take every Spirit under his control lights don't do that it's that same Pillar of Fire and it's here right now is still here to do the same work it's not it's it's Satan beating the word but he's got this day coming [Applause] they attack the cloud in Arizona and some missile it's ridiculous it's no more it's no less ridiculous than to think that we came from monkeys because a Thor missile cannot awaken the bride a Thor missile cannot reveal the Seven Seals seven angels the white wigged one came Glory [Applause] he came in this end time as the white wigged one what did Jesus say all judgment is committed to the son but they scoff they attack and them seven angels met a prophet on the Earth and commissioned him to go from Arizona back east and revealed Seven Seals that's why we're here is because them seals have been revealed a thorough missile would not send a profit back east we would not be gathered here over a Thor miss or an auditorium light that's ridiculous an auditorium light would not allow you to live a life above sin a Thor missile what would that do for you the very presence of God is in his church doing the same works believing the same word we're still under the effect of the open Word and we will be when the Rapture comes we're still going to be under the effect whenever in the Millennium we're still under the effect whenever the new heavens and the new Earth come down we're still under the effect when we've been there Ten Thousand Years brother Fred and it seems like we've just begun we're still under the effects of the open Word and you say Thor missile get out of here it's ridiculous it really is now you see taking the words of a god-chosen vessel and misconstruing them to say something that it's not is nothing new Satan did it from the very beginning he said you know when he misquoted God Satan did it from the very beginning they did it to Jesus whenever that he was in polished judgment Hall and they came and began to accuse him they said this man said that he can destroy this temple in three days raise it up did he say it yeah but that's not what he meant so they do the same thing to the message they'll come in there and they'll twist what the prophet said they they'll twist because you know the Bible said that in his first second Peter right in there he said the Bible is of no private interpretation what does that mean that means that it cannot be isolated you look that up in the Scofield it means it's got to be continuity from start to finish he's got to weave in and out in and out destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up so after all that we come to the original text the original title of this sermon what will you do with this word called the message Jesus is on the hands of the world he's hung the hands of every person and a decision must be made remember the anointed word is Jesus Christ and Christ has unveiled himself before a wide and wandering eyes in this end time so we have a choice there's Jesus the anointed word who did nothing but heal the sick did nothing but cast out devils was God in flesh the word made manifest and on this side you have Barabbas he was a murderer he was a thief he committed an Insurrection you know some Rebellion against Rome or something that got somebody killed and a choice had to be made you say Barabbas is anything other than the Lord Jesus Christ Barabbas can be the world Barabbas can be a relationship that would pull you away from God Barabbas can be friendships Barabbas can be a career to pull you out of church name it anything I don't know what you're going through but he knows but before you you have the anointed word and you have a Barabbas and a decision has got to be made what will I do with Jesus called Christ pilate said he had been placed on his hands the blood of Jesus Christ is placed again on the hands of this congregation it's placed on the hands of this nation and around the world where these tapes has been and the things has been Vindicated and proven by God of God now what will we do with this Jesus that's called the same yesterday today and forever what will we do with his Jesus are you ready to take your place at his side the prophet's nailing it down to an entire generation this is preached in 1963 years and years and years this the word had been properly Vindicated Vindicated miracles signs of Wonders unexplainable the word had been preached in the world had to make a decision now Paula he tried three different ways to get Jesus off of his hands he tried to wash Jesus off of his hands remember he said I find no fault in him so you see it's not enough that we just don't find a fault with the word the word I believe it that's right the the word is spotless man I tell you what I felt chills in service and it's wonderful and I can't find no fault in this word I can't find no fault but you don't take your place by him you don't exactly choose them which you find no fault you can't wash your hands that's trying to wash your hands so he even tried after that he tried to wash his hands but he couldn't you can't get Jesus off your hands by washing him off by just pushing it off so as I said just because we've got to not only just because you recognize there's something to the word but you're trying to wash your hands of a true born-again experience is doing the same thing the second thing pilate tried to do is he tried to pass Jesus song for someone else to deal with remember he sent him to Herod and Herod you know he heard a lot about Jesus he actually wanted to be entertained by him he said you know do a trick and you find people with the same Spirit they want to be entertained entertain me in some way so pilate tried to push him to Herod pass the buck as it was to try and let someone else deal with Jesus but we've all got to deal with Jesus because remember Jesus said to whom much is given much is required so what what does that mean well if you're if if we know about the message and God has blessed us Beyond there's no other greater blessing than to know this truth there's no other blessing there's no greater blessing I mean to say so it's not just enough to know that you can't just pass it off we all have to deal with it God gave us this truth and now God's going to require it of us so he tried to pass them to Herod when we try to pass them to Herod what did he do it came right back to him people try and Pat try and pass the word around well I'm not going to serve God until my wife believes it where I'm not going to serve God to my husband does or to my kids or I'm not I'm not going to serve God until maybe after I graduate college or maybe when I get here when I get married this message is for old people no this message is for young it's for middle age it's for old from Cradle to Gray from Cradle to Glory this message is for you don't let Satan tell you and try and get you to push this message off to push a born-again experience off to push a pillar of fire experience off to some other time don't do like pilot because it's going to come right back in our lap we try and push and wait and push it off and give excuses it's it's not going to work so the third thing was pilate was forced to make a decision we're forced to make a decision at some point in our lives even you that's been even you that's born again on your way to heaven and filled with the Holy Ghost at some point in your life we were forced to make a decision because as Sinners we have Jesus Christ in our hands because your sin and my sin killed them in a nutshell your sins and my sins kill the Prince of Life so we have the blood of Jesus on our hands we come to this world speaking lies we have a thirst for the things of the world we have a thirst for the things we are natural tendencies to run from God but there Comes A Time where you have got to make a decision you can't wash your hands you can't push it for another day you can't push it for no other excuse you've got to bring it home you either accept it or you reject it now there is still Mercy and he stands before you as the perfect proven Vindicated word of God yeah he's beaten yeah he's got the crown of thorns yeah he's got handfuls of beard jerked out of his face yeah he's mocked he's made fun of and all these other things but he's still the Vindicated word He's Still the Lamb of God he's still that wounded dove remember brother I'm telling the story I think it was in World War One or World War II might have been World War one they had the pigeons they had the messenger pigeons and they were they were bound down and they were they were kind of their position was coming under heavy enemy fire and they needed some reinforcements so they got this little message and they told them their position or what they needed or whatever it was and they put it in this pigeon and they sent this Dove off well the enemy knew the tactics they no doubt did the same thing but they seen this dove fly from the enemy so they begin to then turn all their guns on this heavenly messenger and they begin to shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot and this Dove got shot in the wing and got got shot in the leg or got shot in different areas of the body and it was a wounded dove but the dove kept flying and kept flying it kept flying it kept flying because it had a a it was like a homing pigeon and it had to get home it had a message to deliver it had a message to deliver and when it actually made it to the Americans on the other side that had the ability to sit in reinforcements it arrived a broken wounded beaten dove but the message got through the message got through and the Americans sent reinforcements there and they pushed back the enemy because the message of a wounded dove it was a wounded dove two thousand years ago and that wounded dove he like I said he was just so beaten and you think that the population you know of that day they actually chose that would be like choosing like a serial killer or choosing you know a pedophile or something choosing a convict guilty of death and rejecting the Prince of Life all because of religious bias so there he stands with the crown of thorn beaten beyond all recognition and the people had to make a choice and as I said he stands before you the perfect proven Vindicated word and we have to make a choice just because the world is crucifying him afresh doesn't mean you have to just because the world is still beating this word just because the world is still mocking and spitting and hating the word doesn't mean you have to because even in Jesus's first crucifixion there were people there the disciples that could see who he was and it hurt them it just tore their heart out to see what he had to go through but he did it for them the only way to get Jesus Christ off your hands is to accept him wash and don't take them off pushing them down the road pushing pushing him away to someone else and making excuses that does not get him off of your hands but do you know something as simple as receiving him does receiving and accepting him then it goes from your hands to your heart and when it's in your heart that's where the mercy is he's here's the only thing we can do if you cannot wash him off your hands you can't pass him on to somebody else you can't just mythically pass it by there's no way in the world the only thing you can do is accepted in your heart there's no way to get rid of him take him off your hands and put them in your heart or leave him on your hands and stand the judgment that's the only thing you can do let's stand to our feet tonight the musicians will come this message is the truth this message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever the anointed word and it's rejected has been Vindicated and these were just some a few points you you can go on and on and on about the Vindication of the word in this hour but you know you know we hear the tapes and and you hear the prayer lines and you a lot of times I even will identify myself with the prayer line it's on the tape and you identify yourself somebody's coming in for something or maybe you have a loved one with that situation and you identify there's power in that and God would vindicate his word before man over and over and over again but do you know the greatest vindication of this message is you because you are the the manifestation of this hour God sent a prophet and we believe that with all of our hearts and he sent him with a message and he did well done we respect that man and we respect the office and we'll always have that association with him on the other side but you know whenever Ellie's are bright Rebecca [Music] and she was on this camera they were coming along there was Isaac the Bible said he was meditating in the in the field in the evening time and whenever Isaac whenever Rebecca had identified that's my Isaac Eliza job was done Ellie's are well done thou good and faithful servant you brought Rebecca to Isaac but you know now it became such an intimate love affair between Rebecca and Isaac not you know I know I know people are streaming everywhere and I know that this may be kind of a different kind of sermon [Music] and you may think you know and maybe no one here maybe that I'd put too much emphasis on brother Brandon this this evening [Music] but don't think that [Music] he introduced us to Jesus Christ the word we're here right now many of us are married to who we're married to many of us live where we live our lives are so intertwined [Music] because he left his home you know us with little children it would just to have to leave home with your kids crying Daddy please don't go [Music] but they'll but you know maybe there was a woman in Memphis that was praying maybe there was a little old lady somewhere just a nobody to the world that was praying God sent a Revival to my city and God had his Prophet go and he preached horse tired sick so we can have this message [Music] so we can know what true reality is so we can know who Jesus really is we're not worshiping the god of a Manger we're not even during Christmas time it's a day of worship we worship what God is now [Music] we don't just we don't worship God on a crucifix [Music] and he pay that price but God wants to live in you God wants to live in you and he's made it so he's put us where he put all that all the nation of Israel he knew what they would do you know when he was in polished judgment Hall there came a point to where he would quit talking all that preaching all that teaching but there came a time where the word was already spoken people have already made their decisions Jesus Christ the anointed word stands before us and I ask you what will you do not brother Ron not brother Andrew not my neighbor not my parents not my mom not my dad not my children but what will you do with this word that we call the message [Music] the gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you we thank you Lord Jesus for this day we
