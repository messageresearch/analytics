their grass wash their car go to Walmart go to the movies never even think about the Lorden yet you have a desire to serve him to live for him we're blessed we're blessed like to say what an honor it's been for us to be able to be here with you in these few days so much preparation goes into it and it passes so fast doesn't it want to be an awesome time and we gather together over there none of us going anywhere none of us old tired and weary amen we long for that day I'd like to say before uh we read from the scripture today Carol and I my my family want to say give our appreciation to all of you praying for our daughter Erica I know that you did so many times to her sickness and we're so thankful for that we appreciate that 45 years ago today I took Carol to the hospital about 22 hours later our little second child was born her name is Erica [Music] Lee the Lord Jesus Eng graced us with her in our life and we're so thankful for that but he decided he wanted to call her home and I'm just so thankful that I was able to lead her to the Lord and preach a message that one day we're going to meet her soon amen that's the hope we have if it's only good in this life what good does it do us that's right so tomorrow will be her birthday and um we're plan on getting together with our family so we certainly appreciate you've remembered us if you would also speaking of birthdays today is brother Andrew Spencer's birthday [Music] [Applause] on Tuesday will be brother Tim PR's [Music] birthday praise the Lord let's turn if you would to the book of numbers um chapter 13 I didn't brother Timothy and brother Tim just do an awesome job wonderful as a minister whenever you're preaching in in a meeting such as this you always no matter whether you're at home if you're a pastor or whether you're out there's one thing that always presses on your heart and that is to find the mind of the Lord for the service because there's so many things you could say so many things that you could bring to the people of God and all of them truth of course but you also know that there may be people there that's facing suicide amen facing disease facing such catastrophic news in their homes and you want to be so sensitive that the spirit of God will help you that you'll be able to say something that will help them so I noticed after the first service brother Timothy it I felt like caught the mind of the Lord that these meetings this year were going to be a little bit different than any that I'd participated in before up here and brother timc come along the same lines and I'd studied something that um I wanted to bring to you but after after those two Services I just felt to go a different way uh so I trust that it'll be a blessing to you today numbers 13:31 but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched into the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature now I know you read your Bible and you're very familiar with the scripture and I'm sure you know these people were lying come on they were not telling the truth that's right because all the people they saw in that land were not Giants it was only a few of them that's right but isn't it amazing how when we go to looking at things if we're not careful what's minimum we maximize and what's maximum we minimize now something had happened to them well listen as they go on all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anac I me knows what the word aack means anybody long neck long neck well I guess it really depends on how you look at the meaning of that word if you're an optimist you look at it one way if you're a pessimist you look at it another if you're an optimist you look at a man with a long neck I don't know where you're going to miss a Target like that come on Amen there we saw the Giants the sons of anoch which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers we were in our own sight so now they're comparing themsel to the men they saw and this is the way they see them themselves and keep in mind what brother Tim preached to us last night and so we were in their side so what did they do go asked them yeah come on so they went up and asked them right you understand what they're doing they're lying right now think of who these people were they were message leaders these are not Philistines amorites Hittites jebusites coites no no no no these are message people all following the same Prophet supposedly and so we were in their sight I may all you be remembered today as we pray God bless you let's just hold our requests in our heart Heavenly Father we count it such an honor to be able to stand before your children today we have been blessed Lord to be able to be together these short days and truly they passed so fast Lord God we're Desiring for that hour when we will be changed and we'll be able to be caught up to your house and we'll never have to part again Lord we're just praying today that you would help us in this last service may may I be able to get out of the way and speak only that which would be pleasing to you if I'd go to say something that would be wrong stop me Lord if there's a need here to today or many that would be outside the confines of what I've studied and looked at I pray that you'd help me to be sensitive sometimes they don't need but a couple of words to a person that is so desperate so we ask you Lord would you come one more time and visit us in a special way we're so needy of you we commit the service to you today Father in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated so I'd like to speak to you today and I want to ask you this sermon title in the form of a question whose report will you believe every day of our life we're constantly under an onslaught of suggestions and ideas from the world that's around us every day by advertisements by pictures on our smartphones you know I read the other day where they say in in the year in our nation of a presidential election high blood pressure goes High higher heart heart attacks increase trauma increases it's because people look and they're uncertain they're just not sure how is it going to go and what's this person going to do and that person going to do and and we know that through the power of our media that they can project things that are absolutely lies that's right and yet many of our American people are so dumb and lack such spiritual discernment they believe it with all their heart so we know that there's a power of persuasion and there's a power of assimilation an assimilation means to be able to take something into yourself and you become one with that so every day of Our Lives we're constantly being under that onslaught of information of media of Lies Of Satan trying to affect who we are didn't brother Tim beautifully displayed that to us last night and it's a great challenge I believe one of the greatest challenges that we're going to have in this hour is US believing what we know about ourselves versus What God Says About Us and most of the time it's not the same thing but I I honestly again believe that God will have a people who will take him at his word and believe what he says over the top of all their failures and all their mistakes and all their shortcomings let's read again if you would in numbers chap 14 verse1 and let's look at the effect of this evil report and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night now why why are they doing this because these other preachers is it okay if I call them that because these other preachers who had went over into the land and come back and they brought back this negative report all the things that they saw that would seem to be so impossible for them to ever take it so it goes from one to the other to the other to the other now you imagine when they go home that night and they all go back to their tents and they go to talking about it and you know how things like that are so by the time they got done there ain't no telling how big them Giants were there ain't no telling how big the walls were there's no telling how many things that they shared one to another I imagine it would be absolutely amazing if we would start a story right here on the front row with brother Eddie and I'd tell brother Eddie tell all them back to there you would tell the other it would come here and start with this brother go all the way back through there start with this brother go all the way back through there and the brother right in the very back would come up and tell me what I said that's right there ain't no telling what he would say that I said now not because any of you were trying to lie but it's just something about the human being and that's one thing that makes me sick to my stomach sometimes whenever these people who've left the message and they try to make uh God's Prophet a because he doesn't have total recall on the stories that he tells well anybody here that does you can come up and take this microphone [Applause] praise the Lord so by the time it got from one to the other to the other it would be un un just be unbelievable what they were believing so watch in verse two and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God would God we had died in the land of Egypt would God we had died in the wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord brought us un this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be appr prey were it not better for us to return into Egypt now where did they get all this where did they get all of this this was not from The Messengers of truth but they be to add to it and fear begin to multiply now watch what verse four reveals about them and they said one to another let us make a captain now watch they've been following a prophet but they don't want a prophet anymore they want a captain a political man a business man or a man that maybe they can manipulate a little bit and what do they want that man to do and let us return into Egypt God's Prophet had obeyed God's word giv them water when there was none gave given them Quil when there was none given them bread when there was none and yet now they want a captain that will lead them where wow they knew a true prophet of God would never take them back to Egypt amen let me tell you one thing there are no true men of God in this message that want to lead us back to a denomination that we come out of there are no true men of God in this message that want to make a new denomination God's Prophet told us in 1961 thus saith the Lord now listen thus thus saith the Lord that God had given to us a Homeland and he said you get back to your Homeland which is the message of the hour it's no reason to me that Satan has anointed people in this end time and they're trying to point out Humanity of the Prophet they're trying to show you seemingly a flaw here and a flaw there why the devil wants to get you away from your Homeland only in the reveal word of the hour will there be a rapturing face that will change our bodies I passed by many churches in the last few days coming up here all types of denominations all types of systems I'm not being judgmental just telling the truth rapturing faith will not lay in any of them it will take the message of the hour to be able to raise the people on the Earth that will believe for The Impossible and that is a body change on a worldwide scale we're believing for something that has never been Enoch believed for one man we're believing for the dead to raise we're believing for the living to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye it'll take more than badst theology it'll take more than Methodist theology it'll take more than Pentecostal theology well let me go a little farther it'll take more than just message quotes it'll take more than intellectual faith of believing that God has sent a prophet you must be born again you must have the very life of Jehovah himself that has quickened you to eternal [Applause] life Hallelujah so report yes do you believe you imagine if they would have had YouTube in the days of numbers 13 and they had all kinds of people on there before cameras and they'd be saying I want to give my testimony today come on why I left that cult that Moses I'm so free until you wake up in the tribulation period and you wonder why you're there yeah these these folks that have left the message are so free they can dress any way they want to and do whatever they want to and and they call that freedom is there any women here in the church today assembly that have long hair and have long dresses and and your pastor stands before you with a bull whip and makes you should dress that way I don't think they understand our women want to dress this way it is not a bondage to the daughters of God they are free I said they are free they are free from the spirit of Jezebel our young girls don't do this because we make them they do it because they are born again Brothers don't dress like that the way they do and they don't go around with many skirts on in this crazy Age come on somebody our brothers don't wear dresses and do that because they're scared they don't want to do it because that's not the way a real man dresses come on somebody our preachers Don't Preach this because they're scared they preach it because they believe it they believe this message they believe the word of God for this hour as a matter of fact there's not enough devils in hell to pull us away from this revealed word of the hour whose report do we believe the report of Malachi 4 the report of Luke 1730 that's the report we believe oh but here are some other guys in verse six Joshua the son of none and Caleb the son of jafan which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes oh yeah they spake unto all the company of the CH of is are saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land oh yeah two groups saw exactly the same thing and come up with two exact opposite reports if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us a land that floweth with milk and honey only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread amen for us fa can look at the land and say don't you all realize God had them to work all summer and them Gardens and it's harvest time we're going to walk right in get all them peaches we're going to get all them cabbages and all them carrots and all them pumpkins and man alive look what God's done for us but other people oh we can't do it we can't do it listen it's not just that way pertaining to the message itself it can be that way pertaining to your healing it can be that way pertaining to that Addiction in your life or that Spirit that's hung over you you oh my there's a brother come up in the church the other day and he say been fighting there brother Tim knows you well and he said he' been going through something for several several years depression and sadness oh it just seemed like he could not get out of it been prayed for by this one that one the other one myself and the brothers begin to pray for him I got a text from them the next morning he said I'm as lot as a feather the presence of God come down and set me free that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about if you're here today and you're depressed you don't have to leave depressed you may be sad now but you don't have to leave here sad why whose report will you believe I believe we as the people of God can have joy unspeakable and full of Glory we can be up when the devil says we ought to be down we can have so much happiness down inside of our soul that the devil says then people are crazy well that may be the way he perceives us but we're a not and we're getting ready to leave this world and we're getting our fuel tanks filled with rapturing faith so just in case my friends you are wondering do I still pray for people who have cancer even though God in his wisdom took my daughter amen oh yeah I do as a matter of fact we've seen several miracles in the church since Erica passed away if the devil thought it would stop me oh he's crying bad right now if he thinks it's going to stop you when you have disappointments no you know why we're made of the stuff that don't Bluff we are made oh Hallelujah we are made of the stuff it's the same stuff Peter was made out of and the same stuff Paul was made out of this is the report we believe we are more than conquerors to him who loved us and gave himself for do I understand no do I understand why God took my baby girl no my heart is still so broken amen I can't even hardly look at a picture of her amen my heart is broken I heard brother BR say years ago when I first come to the message and I I never really understood it he said God you've broken my heart over and over again and I thank you for it but I've learned to trust him in a way that I've never trusted him before and even when he says no when he says wait a while can you know kind of affect you a little bit but when he says no it really can affect you but if you'll allow it he'll bring you on the other side of that no and you'll be stronger than you ever were before how pain ful it was and brother brenon must have looked at his little girl as she was laying there and her eyes crossed before she died and him trying to understand God why would you do this why would you allow this God Amen and he said if God wouldn't answer him the devil would and he said when he stood there the devil told him look you've prayed for people you've climbed up and down them power poles you've done this and that and the other he wouldn't even have to speak he wouldn't even have just look this way and should get up and be well he said I was about ready to say well if that's the way he is but he said there was something down on the inside of me oh how many's been there before oh my goodness people think boy I that Devil he's giv me the office battle I've met that devil let me tell you something right now friends it ain't near nothing whenever you meet the Devils it ain't near as bad when you meet families and friends but whenever you meet God and you find yourself wrestling with him you see that little woman had so much faith that the Lord Jesus when she come out of desperation was her need and the Bible said the Lord Jesus answered her not a word and when he did give her a word it wasn't a good one he said woman boy we'd call him a racist today wouldn't woman I'm not s but to the house of Israel you ain't nothing but a dog right two Greek words used for dog Jesus called her big dog but the word she answered back was I ain't no big dog I'm a little dog I'm even little than what you said but that ain't got nothing to do with it I've got a need today what would you do if your pastor would call you a dog what would you do if you even felt like one of the preachers here today said the word dog and looked at you and you'd say Lord have mercy I'm so offended I ain't going back you know what that little woman had so much faith I love the way the prophet describes her he said she had so much Faith Jesus himself couldn't run her off people leave church cause the preacher don't shake their hand they leave church cuz they don't like this and don't like that the Lord Jesus is coming for people that so love him that even Jesus himself can't run them off oh you imagine the Lord Jesus looking at you and said get out of here go on pleas the disciples they looked at them that day and said you all want to go what about you you preachers you want to leave Jesus said go ahead Peter you want to get on out of here he said Lord to whom would we go you've got the words of eternal now we've got to be petted and got to be baby and we've got to have the you know the associate associate associate position of this and that and the other the prophet said if you compare Christianity Today what it was in that first century they didn't have to have positions they didn't have to be baby they were rough people they LED God they trusted him I believe that's part of what we're going to be restored to in the last day but we got people walking around their feelings on their shoulders all the time and their lips all pooched out oh Lord what a way to end this meeting oh my goodness come on somebody have we got the type of faith in this building that if Jesus himself stands in your way and say you can't go you say yes I am you ain't keeping me out Jesus my name is on your backook hallelujah oh the devils in hell will not stop me can you imagine Jacob trying to witness about his God and he tells people his name and tells him things that he's done then he gets real personal and said oh yeah I said this God of mine broke my hip looking at you like what what he's a god of love he ever he ever hurt you all come on now oh my we love the love aspect don't we but sometimes God hurts you but it's because he does love you it's for your good he don't have to treat you the way he does these people out here don't you understand they get saved and there'll be many of them that'll come up that day oh I wish people could understand it there is a million miles of difference between a Believer and a disciple look at how many times the New Testament uses the word disciple you know what that word comes from it comes from the same root word that we use from discipline how many of these people went to church today around in this area will they stand disciplined oh no they'll call thems a Believer I believe in the cross I Believe In The Blood I believe in heaven I believe in hell I don't want to go to hell don't want to go to heaven well you got to quit cutting your heart now who in the world told you that ain't no preacher telling me how to live Ain't No preacher telling me I can do this why they don't want discipline well I wish somebody would preach with me this morning it's sad because a lot of the message folks are the same way they don't want discipline they go to this church and then the preacher preaches on they get mad and they go to that church and they go to that church well Hallelujah we believe in a post of Duty all right but a lot of Us carry our post ho diggers in the back pocket and when the preacher preaches on our house we dig our post up and dig another post hole over here and we just go from one to the other where are those rugged Christians that can say I don't want to just be a believer I want to be a disciple I know you know it from reading your Bible but you realize the Lord Jesus preached more about our cross than he did his own your cross and whosoever does not take up Not My Cross Jesus said right we can put them on mirrors we can wear them on our clothes we can wear a chain around our neck but can we take up our cross that's the report I know a lot of men as they get older they get softer and I think my church is praying that I will but they're facing reality and realize so far I ain't notice this in numbers 14:36 and the man which Moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander the word slander is Whispering defamation evil report unfavorable saying even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died don't you understand what trouble is going to be for those who have sat in our ranks and have pulled away and they're spending the rest of their life trying to disprove this message it's going to be amazing the scientists who stand before God one day and spent their entire life proving there was no God and then they wind up facing him many archaeologist spent many of their years Church his story and spent many of their years saying that was never a man by the name of Pontius Pilate that ever lived until a few years ago that's right until they found this gigantic Stone brother Tim brother Timothy and US was there several years ago and they find this Stone there in Tiberius of cesaria and they they digging around there and found this great big massive Stone let's guess who's name on it Pontius pilot and then just recently I read a letter where one of the certain men had written a letter from Pontius pilot unto Emperor Nero and he was talking about after Nero before Nero whenever he was talking about the Lord Jesus so those men spent all their lives totally in vain you imagine spending your life I say if all these folks that have left the message would have spent that time studying the message before they left they still might be in it but they've spent a whole lot more time since they live it but you know what they're supposed to do that somebody is going to bring up an evil report but I'm on the other side I'm one of them oh Hallelujah I'm one of them that's supposed to bring up a good report ain't we brothers are you here today as one of them I'm going to bring a good report I'm going to say the message is full of goodness and the message is full of word and the message Mage it ain't up just a bunch of dry theology but the message brings to us a return to the original baptism of the Holy Ghost same power same signs same wonders same [Applause] Jesus Oh My who report will you believe let us move over to 1 Samuel verse 17 chapter 17: 42 and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him disdained which is to despise holding contempt to be vile and worthless for he was but a use and Ruddy and of a fair countenance and the Philistines said unto David am I a dog David could have said yeah man you said it big boy am I dog that thou comest to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his gods and the Philistines said to David come to me oh yeah maybe your Philistine today is a cancer maybe your Philistine is something else you're dealing with in your life and he laughs at you notice the Philistine had a confession the Philistine said to David come unto me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the Beast of the field now let's size these guys up a non-armored Goliath would have weighed approximately 760 lbs and David weighed in at 110 and Goliath was still outnumbered [Applause] adding the weight of his armor at about 125 lbs made him 885 with a spear sword shield and helmet easily over 900 amen sell outnumbered real bad right now can you imagine standing there looking at a man who has a spear that is 20 feet long so from here this B on the corner you just take the end of it and just just like that and rip you wide open you don't have to move the prophet said the end of his Broadhead on the end of it was about 4ot across boy brothers couldn't we kill some deer and turkey if we get hunt with that now his brothers and King Saul were terrified David looked at him and said well glory to God glory to God glory to God hallelujah they said Lord have mercy you imagine a man that big as eyeballs is probably that big around I'm when Never B them eyes it be like a ceiling fan they just Breeze all over 14in fingers that would make a 28 in hand 2 foot and 4 in hand standing there with this bow and it come out there stood this stripping 110 PB soaking wet then said David to the listing thou comest to me with a sword and with a spirit with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts amen the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied I love the way the prophet says it this way because they seen the opposition so great and they was afraid to meet the challenge of the boasting Goliath of the Philistines afraid to meet it but there come a little stoop shouldered Ruddy looking little fell his mama had baked some raisin pies and brought them up to give them to his brothers and while he was Milling around now notice he ain't looking for no fight don't think I'm a complete idiot today that I'm standing here inviting the devil to come I Ain but I am giving him a warning if he does if he does I've got up no trespassing signs all over my property Ain talkinging about my natural property I'm talking my spiritual property when the devil tries to steal your peace you need to point out that no trespassing sign thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee greater is he that is in thee than he that is in the world if ye abide me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done if any to are for you on Earth agree is touching one thing it shall be done that are your signs that's it that's what God wants you to post all around your inheritance oh the devil say I'll get your children no devil you ain't getting our teenagers no you're not getting them into drugs no we are not giving them up we are not letting our children go we claim them in the name of [Applause] Jesus I love the way the prophet says this he said that Goliath said to him we won't have any any Bloodshed of course that's the way the enemy likes to brag when he thinks he's got the edge on you when he sinks oh yeah bring him over here and then we'll choose we'll fight oh there was Goliath he says on the other side he stood out there and made his boast many times bigger than David fingers 14 inches long had a m big old fell Philistine giant he was even David was even too little to be in the Army too much of a runt praise God I'll tell you one thing you and I look at runts in a whole lot different way than hell does hell knows Dynamite can come in very small packages Hallelujah remember David it was revealed to David revealed to David he said we'll call him that giant cancer or a paralytic and you said well brother Donnie I really hate it for you all sister Erica lost her battle to cancer I don't know who told you that L but Erica did not lose the battle the truth of it is Erica is alive and that cancer is [Music] dead I said that cancer is dead she did not lose hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah she did not lose sister Karen did not lose I was down the basement of my house a couple of months ago oh goodness I was so sad and so heavy and I made her a playlist of songs I would sent to her to encourage her been a long time since

I listen to it more one come on and then another come on and I was crying and squalling so tore up I said oh God please won't you speak to me give me something Lord please please cuz he'd been so

a twinklet of an [Applause] ey brother Donnie are you are you tore up about Camala not in the least as a matter of fact I sung a song at the church the other day I've seen all this world I want see things down here ain't got no chains on me I ain't worried about Camala because I know he's ready to come and I'm ready to go hallelujah hallelujah I don't care who you put in the White House that ain't going to make no difference I ain't worried about who's in the white house I'm worried about who's in my house Hallelujah to God I'm more concerned about who's in your house Oh Glory to God May the presence of God help us to leave these meetings with such a determination this is my report I believe his word no matter what comes my way I'll face it by the grace of [Applause] God listen how brother renam describes this man that man's shoulders were 10 foot across wow 10t across standing 14 to 15t tall wow I mean it take you a while to survey a Target that big would and you just say what a victory so look at your scans that way I said look at your scans that way oh my what a guy standing there before this little old fell and whenever David finally gets a chance to say something that's way the devil like well I tell you one thing this and this and this what you why don't you shut up and let me say something oh my I was down in my basement again last week I spent a lot of time down in my basement I got speakers in and listen to the prophet and I pray and stuff and I was down there the devil says you going to serve him are you didn't even heal your daughter you prayed for people all over the world God straightened out crossed eyes God's healed cancer God stopped heart attacks in the ER he's done all these things and you needed him yeah and he wouldn't even come so you're still going to serve how you going to do it the Lord just dropped this down on my heart it was so simple but it's so powerful and I just said you wouldn't [Applause] understand why do you serve him he wouldn't understand why do you live for him why do you love him oh glory to God the big people of the world say how can you do they wouldn't understand how can you look in the middle of Trials and tests and say the Lord give and the Lord took away but blessed be the name of the Lord oh I tell you one thing that made me so happy the devil can out preach me he can out sing me he can out shout me he can out quote me but there's one thing I can do that the devil can't do I can live right I can live right I can talk right I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he ain't never had it he ain't never going to have it I can be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an hour because I'm believing the right report Oh Glory to God I love the way the prophet says this in Worth's Faith expressed notice when it was revealed David become Fearless he said today I'll cut your head off you imagine 110 lb guy standing there looking at a guy with all of his bulk weigh nearly a half a ton I'll cut your head off that that's that's what that cult stuff does say it warps your thinking amen you belong to that Hebrew cult stuff you know you you honestly come on now man look at look at the stats David didn't go by stats he went by quotes he went by previous [Applause] victories oh my Hallelujah you see this was David's confession 1st Samuel 17:46 this day yeah will the Lord deliver thee unto mine hand and I will smite thee and I will take thine head from thee you imagine a head that big probably about size of a wash tub and the anointing moves into a deeper realm and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines yes now the battle is no longer just between David and Goliath anybody know what the word Goliath means Splendor God's going to humiliate the devil's Splendor with a runt as I stood downstairs earlier they got some trophy cases down there of the FFA and different ball games and this and that and the other and had pictures of coaches and trophies and ribbons and all kinds of things and I was walking down there praying before coming up and it was you know for the people that live here and all that reminiscent they oh yeah I knew coach so and so and I knew so and so and it was made in honor to them and I thought what a day it's going to be whenever the heroes of God stand there it ain't going to be no showcase oh my there was they go back to the 50s and the 60s and so on and it was talking about the great things that they've done but I thought Lord I don't want to be missing that day when the people of God I ain't just talking about preachers I'm talking about some of you lay people that think you ain't nobody let me tell you something you are very important to God brother Tim brought it to us last night this ain't just about preachers it's about mothers it's about fathers it's about our young people the Lord Jesus wants young men and young women not just preachers not just evangelists not just teachers what good would it do to have all these Great Men of God if there were not people to live what they preach and walk out of these doors after these meetings and take this word and you say all right devil I ain't come looking for you but if you come looking for me I'm warning you you're fixing to get in trouble amen I didn't start this time and devil you made a mistake when you took me on because I didn't just start believing God yesterday we didn't just start believing God this week we trusted him we believed him we followed him when we couldn't understand and yet we stay [Applause] faithful and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands yeah I love that about a real man of God cuz he can stand there in reality David is by himself that's right as far as the rest of the army but he don't want it to be an individual Victory that's right that's right he wants it to be an our Victory praise the Lord oh I love that about the prophet of God because somebody sent me a quote here a few weeks ago and he said he was addressing the ministers he Saidi not speaking just about myself now Brothers he said because you all are messengers of the same message that's right can you imagine Brothers your wife gives you a call tomorrow she's sitting over on the side of the road she has a flat tire you're miles away from her you can't help her you call your son he can't no nobody you can think of you get hold of nobody but some guy stops on the side of the road maybe a had a bath in a week or two looks kind of rough but he steps out ma'am can I help you sir I've got a flat tire I don't even know if I've got a spare or not I don't even know what a spare tire looks like do I I'm not sure I even have one ma'am could I help you yes sir if you wouldn't mind and that man drags out that spare and Jacks that car up and changes that thing out and finally finally gets it done and she calls you back on the phone how are you honey how are you I'm doing good that this this man he he stopped and helped me I know what I'd do if if somebody did that to Carol I'd say did you get his phone number did you get his name you know why I'd want to call him amen and thank him for helping my queen can you imagine what it's going to be that day when the men of God that have lived down Through the Ages walk up before the Lord Jesus yeah and the Lord Jesus addresses his men servants and he says to them thank you thank you for watching over my queen amen thank you for preaching to her thank you for watching out for her you don't you don't understand if you're not a preacher especially a pastor that much of the burdens that you carry it's not your own and it's not even your own making it's the burdens of your people no matter where I go around the world I never get away I'm a phone call away a text away a WhatsApp away from this one being in the hospital this one being diagnosed with this or that of the other it never leaves you and you carry that your whole time that you're on the earth that God calls you for that position you imagine when the men of God stand and remember God's Prophet will stand there and then we in our ranks will stand behind him I mean we walk up before the Lord Jesus and remember he's not beholding to any man and he'll call these men out one by one and say I see all the sleepless nights you had amen I I saw all the time you gave up that's right I saw the dinners that you had arranged with your family and a phone call changed every bit of that I saw all of that now I want to say enter into the joys of the Lord oh we want to look around and see you we want to look around and pray Heaven is not just about preachers it's not just about Great Men of God but we want to look around each one of us with our ministry and see you coming up behind us oh Hallelujah that's the report we believe this is not a fairy tale this is not Walt Disney friend this is the reality and we are closer than any other generation to having it notice David said and it shall come to pass it came to pass rather when the Philistine arose came and Drew nigh to meet David that David hasted and ran you got to be kidding me toward the Army now you imagine but now his brother said oh dear God Mom dad's going to kill us they're going to talk to us like dogs I mean they're going to kill us they're going to say why in the word you know how he's always been he's always been that Pentecostal guy you know singing playing back there shouting with that harp inste you all been you know he's nervous you got to watch it why did you boys stop but you see David had uh stopped down on his way over by a little Brook me brother Timothy was there a few years ago that Brook my name ain't David it's David Donnie spiritually so I reached down there and pick me up a few of them little rocks out of that same Brook amen this is one of them Hallelujah he picks up five of them because Goliath had four brothers so he had to get out the right rock with the right name on it yeah that looks like g o l i d e a d d e v i l dead devil yeah that's him that's him and David is so inspir where is this man get now remember he had no tapes he didn't have 66 books of a Bible so he didn't have a pastor and local church he didn't have a choir to stand up and sing like my goodness when that song they song while to go absolutely awesome I mean anybody could go looking for a giant after that song but there David had none of that and he stand look at that great big glory to God let me add him let me add him let me add him and here comes Goliath and David takes off run whose report yes do you believe or would you side with the report of wisdom So-Cal now we believe the message of the hour but we believe that we have moved into a different era that we no longer need fanaticism and emotion and imagine how David would film some of our churches he say dear God you all say you got the Holy Ghost I'd say if David would have been here in this meeting the deacons had took him out probably half a dozen times each service and that been before the preacher ever come out a man without the Holy Ghost had so much to praise God for he had so much to worship God for and he so anointed just a kid and he takes off running after that cancer Hallelujah the prophet said the little boy weighed about 110 PBS kind of scrawny drawled up little fella Here Come Little David just a bouncing just a bouncing in the spirit and then brother B says H ha ha well glory to God I say we ought to say that haa at the Devil when the devil say you ain't going to make it ha you're going to die haa I'm going to get your husband I'm going to get your wife ha you're a lying devil you ain't getting my daughter you ain't getting my husband you ain't getting my wife this is our inheritance you ain't stealing my joy you ain't stealing my peace it's mine as a Son of God brother renam says oh what a Holy Roller my Hallelujah he said the Lord God of Israel he placed it before him all the devils in Hell couldn't wait across Little David dancing in the spirit that's right oh Glory Hallelujah now remember the Jews were taught by God to dance amen so they danced at festivals they danced at all kinds of things but all their dancing was not in the spirit right so there'd be different times they just get up and dance and dance and dance it was just their custom a lot of Middle Eastern people still do the same thing today but David wasn't just dancing he was in the spirit David put his hand in his bag don't worry I'm not going to throw this I'm a dead shot now with a gun and with a bow a lot of dead animals on my wall to testify the same but I don't want to just be a a dead shot with my rifle or with my bow I want to be a dead shot against hell I want to be a dead shot right here in this service today come on somebody with me Brothers is that right I don't want to miss I ain't using a scatter gun today a shotgun I want to be able to hone that thing right on in and bust that devil away from you where you'll be able to walk out of here and say praise God I'm going to meet this challenge I'm going to meet whatever it is before me and by the grace of God I'm going to overcome it none of us know what awaits us when we get back home but whatever awaits us I know who we're taking with us if trouble awaits you don't fret over it don't worry over it Jesus will be there with you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll go with you all the way to the end of the [Applause] world and he took fence a stone and slang it we need to do some slang at it don't just sing slang and smoked the Philistine in the forehead that the stone sunk into his forhead huh and he fell upon his face wow so he rather has ever hunted and you hunt with a bow or certain velocity in your rifle and what will it do it shocks the animal and they will go backwards because of the foot pounds per pressure that you're hitting them but instead of this nearly half a ton Target falling backwards which would have been normal he got hit in the forehead so here this thing is moving my just flying through there and the power of God got behind it and went that's right he should have went this way he should have went this way unless of course the Lord God wanted to put him on his face and make him bow for me oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God glory to God how I love it when the Lord God will have direct his people and we slang that stone and we hit that devil whatever it is right in the forehead and God makes that devil bound before remember Isaiah prophesied about the devil and he said I will lay thee before Kings and they shall narly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man not the God is this the man that made Nations to tremble do you understand one day every devil that's tormented you is going to walk before you at the Judgment every devil of cancer every devil of Oppression every devil of sadness every demon is going to walk before you and God is going to make them look at you you talking about shaking when they walk oh Hallelujah when they walk before you Sons and Daughters of God and then demons meet you face to face except you'll be on the other side of the throne and they will come before you trembling and shaking God will make the Devil [Applause] bow before his Queen I hope I'm on the committee yes that get you kicked down in [Applause] hell he will bow yes that's right oh you say well brother H that's all well and good that's all well and good that'll be good in the Sweet By and By you don't have to wait till the Sweet By and By clim Your Victory today Amen Let Me Close The Prophet said there he went up there just a dancing in the spirit as hard as he could Why by faith he saw the victory he took his little old sling in there and one of these stones and he give dance and here he comes around and around and I hear old Goliath say ho ho ho ho I Santa Claus either ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho what was it he had five Stones F AI t h and five fingers wrapped this string around j s u s here he comes oh brother look out Goliath you've got to fall and when he set that loose the Holy Ghost got a hold to that little Stone and picked it up a speed of about a, miles per second wouldn't Remington love to have broke into that A Thousand Miles a second and he struck that giant and he fell forward David danced up there and jumped up on top of him and he pulled his sword out and chopped his head off and say how do you like that boy tell that depression on your shoulder today how do you like that boy tell that sadness tell that cancer how do you like that boy oh my oh he reached down there and got him by the hair of the head and said come on boys let's preach Divine Healing come on boys let's preach Divine Healing come on brothers in the message let's preach Hebrews 138 that is the same yesterday today and forever let's not let our people set in the Pew bound up with things of the world but let's preach the Lord Jesus is still a mighty God he's a deliverer he heals he saves he [Applause] delivers will we believe that report or will we believe the report well poor brother Donny you know bless his heart he come in the message you know in 83 and we all always hoped that he had come out of Pentecost but he never has we thought he would get some wisdom and [Applause] he'd well I hope some of y'all same way I mean any all Unitarian or Methodist or Church of God this message is to turn our hearts back to the faith of the original Apostolic fathers they cast out Devils they raised the Dead they healed the sick and they gave their life for the Lord Jesus Christ let me close 1 Samuel 1715 let's stand together if you would so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smoked the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and Drew out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewi and when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead oh yeah they fled amen the meaning of the word report saved this to the last it's the Hebrew word shuah it means news or Tidings or to mention news Tidings or to mention talk about so how do you know that the champion of hell is not fighting against you this very day and God is that close to delivering you and if Satan can make you negative or make you down maybe you come to the meetings and you had a great anticipation you think I didn't get what it come for oh no Lord oh no oh no well just cuz you didn't get it now don't mean you ain't going to get it over to eat in place we're going to eat lunch out it don't you ain't going to get it on the way home you just don't give up well I I I didn't get it I didn't get it God may wait till you get at home tomorrow that guy's been tormenting you on the job and right there on that job get God gets it to you don't let go whose report will you believe no doubt after these meetings there'll be a lot of sermons that'll be inspired to be preached against them I'm glad when God called me to preach it he give me more to preach on than preachers I don't think some message preachers would have anything to preach about if they didn't listen and watch other preachers so they could find something to preach about God never called me to Paul never told him as he preach the preachers he said preach the word so that's to be expected look friends it'll happen just like this that's right the mechanics of the world is in action right now pre-tribulation anointing is on the earth there has been more un resolutions declared against Israel than all the rest of the nations of the world together we've seen it through the thing of October 7 how many nations now we see College starting back up again and the students are hating Israel don't you see it's here Satan's getting his mechanics to together you understand when the bride goes say if she goes on Tuesday morning or whenever it is the devil ain't got 6 months the devil ain't got a year the Bible says whenever he comes down he knows he's got but a short time right if the bride leaves at 8:00 in the morning by tomorrow afternoon this world will be turned totally upside down right the churches politics everything it's working behind the scenes right now and when the bride goes up up Satan comes down why the people he's been accusing are standing there in glorified bodies and he can't say [Applause] nothing as long as we're here in this top of a body he can say something but boy once we get that body he ain't welcome no more oh my goodness if you're here today without the Holy Ghost I'm telling you it's not enough to believe God sent a prophet it's not enough to go to brother Ron's Church brother Tim Church wherever it is you go you must have that identification of the Holy Ghost in your soul that you can show that token that the price is paid can we bow our hands together I wonder if there be here today that you're just not sure if you have the Holy Ghost or not you love the Lord you want to go to heaven you want to be in the Rapture but you're just not sure if you have the Holy Ghost or not would you raise your hand to God today God bless you we won't embarrass you or nothing

brush of angels Wings we've bumped into them Angels worship they worship in such a way that they they Rock the pillars of the post when they begin to bring out holy holy holy under the Lord I wonder

God bless you God bless you in your change God bless you in your future God bless you as you leave these meetings a completely different person refilled with the Holy Ghost healed [Music] healed delivered and completely set free by the preaching of the word the Holy Spirit Falls and he begins to minister to different ones in different ways he has a word this way has a gift in the body so that this brother or this sister will catch it that way I love the Dynamics of the body of Jesus Christ that he knows how to capture the attention of his elect and bring them to the Forefront of the battle because he know that you won't run away from it but you'll slang you'll slang that sling he knows what you got on the inside of you so he puts you right here in the midst of the greatest battle that's ever been fought and he knew that you wouldn't let Satan destroy your mind and destroy your spirit and destroy your soul so he gave you the greatest weapon that he ever could he gave you the message of the hour and we just want to say from Full God Hospital lighthouse we thank all of our visitors for being here we thank you for taking out of your time and your energies I know that there's there's some sisters from there from Europe here there's some brothers and sisters from from all the way on the other side of the coast there's people from overseas that are in this meetings today and we just want to say God richly bless you we thank you for being a part of these meetings and I trust that you can leave here I bless people I personally want to just take a minute and I want to thank all of the the people that are behind the scenes here at Full Gospel Lighthouse this is the first time that we ever held a meeting outside of our own our own tent our out our own church facility bringing it here and I want to say that I am abundantly impressed with our team at Full Gospel Lighthouse brother Jeremy brother Scotty brother Evan brother Adam brother Ruben brother sister Crystal and sister Stephanie would could do it without you and I'm sure I'm going to miss somebody but I just want to say that I I'm sufficiently impressed with the presence of the Holy Ghost how it has impacted these brothers and sisters because we Minister from here we Minister behind this pull pit but those brothers and sisters are used by almighty God to send the gospel around the world place it on a platform so that people across the Nations can be blessed by these meetings they never understand the impact of what they're having and we just want to say God bless you God wish bless you we have a wonderful team here for Gospel Lighthouse but we could not have done this meeting God sent us one of his one of his best from all the way from Brother Tom Ray to be here brother Jonathan Frey he felt it on his heart to come here and be a part of these meetings and to assist us in the sound booth and in any way possible we just wanted to put his shoulder to the wheel and we just want to say God bless you and your family brother johathan for coming and being a part of these meetings also Brother David Dexter from brother Tim puit church we just want to say God richly bless you he's become a real bosom buddy here and uh he's been a real friend and we've seen the Lord use his use his ministry in sound and his wife's Ministry of music to be a blessing and we just want to say God Rich bless you and I could not do this entire meeting with these guys without our musicians you know forgive me I know I know that you have different churches and I know that you're from your home church and you you might be a little bit partial but I think these guys are the absolute best y'all forgive me if I hurt your feelings but I think the world of these guys and I wouldn't take a million dollars for them they have been they have been supernaturally blessed and used by almighty God to give their gifts they don't do this for a show to be honest a lot of them would like to hide behind that curtain and not be seen that's just typically how gifts work in a body but these brothers and sisters have have spent countless hours practicing music and developing the gift that God's placed in their life and we just want to say God richly bless you and each and every one of you I know that we're going to miss some things and I couldn't do it without our Deacons our ushers and and and I know you come to the close of the meetings and you hear these things and they're just words to some people but for me it's my heart this is my heart because I could not hold brother Ron and myself brother Matthew brother William we could not host a meeting like this without the people at Full Gospel Lighthouse so if you could do a favor for me if you're a visitor here I want you to just take some time and say God bless you may not see everything that they do but just just reach out there brother Brandon would say it like this God bless you is the greatest thing that you could say to him and I just want to appreciate you from this meeting and say that we love you with the love of the Lord amen we have some announcements that we're just going to go over because we're getting ready to be dismissed we have a we have a dinner Fellowship uh Fellowship dinner that we we're inviting every one of you to come to we have we've got enough food to feed feed an army and we want to make sure that an army that's behind David comes and eats with us because we we we've we we''ve spent some time in preparations getting these things together and we just would like to turn around and bless you for coming and being part of these meetings and I trust that we've treated you in some way that you have bound to like one of them at least and I appreciate you coming here and and eating on the word of God so that you can go and enjoy our chicken I I really don't like it when people come and eat my chicken but don't eat the spiritual food but that's neither here nor there Jesus had them we all got them so so let me move on to my my my announcements so if if the brothers sisters could maybe just cast the the address to where we're going it's it's a half a mile from here if you've been here in our past Labor Day meetings it's right here at Spotswood High School and uh there's the address I'm going to give you permission to pull out your phone to snap a picture of that right there it's 368 Blazer drive all you got to do is when you pull out of these pull out of the driveway here just take a left go all the way back down to 33 which I believe it's about two10 of a mile and you take a r and you go down the road about a half a mile and it's there on your left and it's Spotswood High School and uh we've got some things that we need need to make note of we make this every year because we really we really don't want to pay your fines and we won't pay your fines so we're going to make this mention to you there's a fire lane at this place it's red it's red around the curbs do not park where these red lines are you will get a ticket I was there yesterday we setting up some things and a fire truck come right through a and if I'd have been in that red lane they had give me a ticket because they fueled up the fuel station for Rockingham County is right there so please do not park where a red lane is when you're pulling into Spotswood it's a loop it just goes around you just circle around it and you park there in different places and you enter into the building if you're looking at the building on the left major entrance there's some picnic tables out there and I'm sure that you by the time you get there there'll be a line of people so you won't miss where to go in the building that and uh we'll have somebody there to make sure uh that the the doors should be about open if they're not open it's because the brothers and sisters are still preparing there and we're going to have prayer here at the end of these announcements and so that when you get there you can just go ahead and start eating and you can say that brother Andrew and the church blessed it and you just go right on in and I know there's a lot of people that love this next part of my announcements watch your kids watch your kids there's cameras everywhere and I'm not going to say what I've always said you know what I'm going to say watch your kids and parents if you have a little bitty child and you think they need to be assisted just stay with them make sure one parent is watching them or know where they are because Full Gospel lighthous does a lot of things but we don't babysit we don't hand out pacifiers to our to our congregants here and we don't hand them out to you and we don't we don't plan on babysitting your children so uh God give them to you so we're going to let you do the duty that God give them to you so we've got two gyms that are in the place uh one is for the little kids and there is there's a jumpy house in there and uh that's for the little guys and I'm sure I'm going to make my way down there me and brother Aaron probably check out that sliping slide and we'll show y'all that we can preach behind the pull pit and we can having fun with you at the same time so but we also have another gym that's directly behind the where we're going to be eating at and that's for the young adults and the uh and the older kids and there's going to be volleyball basketball in those in that gym there and we ask that uh after you get done eating if you wouldn't mind just cleaning up after yourself and uh this is not our facility and uh we just ask that you would respect it like I know that Sons and Daughters of God will uh the bathrooms you you'll find that there's there's one on the left one on the right and uh I I just want to just say this these brothers have have spent their their energies in this meeting and just be wise with your time with with them please don't give them your life story in 5 minutes and uh just be wise with brother Ron if not brother Matthew will probably come move you away from him if you're just leaning on him too much don't take offense I give him full authority to do so so if you're going to get mad at him you're going to be mad at me so don't do that because we don't want to make you we don't want anybody be mad at us and also we we we have this note we have a real nice walking trail outside of Spotswood Trail uh outside of Spotswood High School there and a lot of people have walked that in years past and it's right out in front of the school and um it's a real nice Trail but we ask you not to walk it because there's a few beehives out there very large beehive is is what I've been told and we'd rather you not get stung by it so uh we we'd like this day to go pretty good without anybody swelling up here except for eating on the good food [Music] so amen just before we before we leave here we'd like for you to check around your seats and uh if there's anything here that's yours please take it with you because tomorrow this will turn into a school and if you leave something here it probably won't get uh return to you so just take a time as you're dismissing today and uh just go around those things and my A's been wonderful meetings amen amen don't don't let these announcements uh disturb the the anointing of God those are just things we have to do I don't want that to change the atmosphere in your spirit by no
