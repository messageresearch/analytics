[21:59] Christ
[22:00] that perfect spotless lamb father Lord
[22:02] that walked the Earth the Lord Jesus two
[22:05] thousand years ago Lord You Came you
[22:07] took a part of our suffering Lord you

[22:21] clothed in your righteousness
[22:23] oh God what a paradox that we Lord that
[22:26] were born the way we were born with a
[22:28] life that we had that we could literally
[22:30] become born again father the Lord by
[22:32] this Holy Ghost by the spirit of the
[22:34] Lord Jesus Christ
[22:36] where we read in the scriptures Lord of
[22:38] how you moved and how you did nothing
[22:40] except the father showed you
[22:43] you were so led by the spirit and you
[22:46] knew where you stood you knew what the
[22:47] word said about you all the devils in
[22:50] hell were subject to you because of who
[22:53] you were
[22:54] and now Lord Jesus your body is on the
[22:57] earth with the same Authority with the
[23:00] same power led by The Same Spirit
[23:03] Conquering the same Devils oh God where
[23:07] what kind of people should we be
[23:09] Lord how could we ever keep from
[23:11] praising you how can we ever keep
[23:13] from thanking you enough for what you've
[23:15] done
[23:16] and Lord you heard each request the Lord
[23:18] that it that was read across this Pulpit
[23:20] this morning Lord and you know each and
[23:22] every desire and one day Lord Jesus you
[23:25] are on the way Lord to heal
[23:27] a Believer a secret believer's daughter
[23:30] who had passed
[23:32] you had your mind set to where you were
[23:34] going and what the father had you do
[23:36] but yet there was a little woman of
[23:38] great faith
[23:39] that in the midst of the crowd she still
[23:42] reached out and she touched you
[23:44] and that touch of Faith was so powerful
[23:47] Lord that it weakened you virtue left
[23:49] your body
[23:51] Lord You're the same God
[23:54] and if you're the same God then that
[23:55] means that the same faith
[23:58] of any believer can touch you with the
[24:01] same touch
[24:03] and we can get what we have need of
[24:05] because Lord your Holy Ghost is here as
[24:08] the great enforcer and you're here to
[24:10] enforce your word you'll see that your
[24:13] word does not fall to the ground
[24:16] that is your priority and that is your
[24:18] will
[24:19] and Lord we commit all these requests
[24:21] there are many
[24:22] but lord they're not too many for you
[24:25] father God whether we're through the
[24:26] valley or on the Mountaintop you're
[24:28] there
[24:29] even if we don't feel you that doesn't

[24:38] and father God they're going through a
[24:39] valley but Lord you're there with them
[24:41] and you've seen it before the foundation
[24:42] of the world
[24:44] Lord your love and your healing power
[24:46] does not change based on where we're at
[24:49] we ask Lord Jesus that you just be with
[24:50] him give his body strength give him Joy
[24:53] despite his Humanity give him Joy give
[24:57] him peace give him comfort and Lord for
[25:00] those that have lost loved ones for
[25:01] those that have loved ones on their
[25:03] deathbed Lord it just shows us that no
[25:06] matter what life holds no matter what we
[25:08] accomplish in life
[25:09] the true question is are we ready to
[25:12] meet you

[52:15] last night I just thought well maybe we
[52:17] just replay the tape so
[52:19] that was so great amen amen God bless
[52:23] you if you will turn with me in your
[52:24] scriptures this morning
[52:26] I'd like to look at Esther chapter 4
[52:29] verse 13.
[52:30] and then habakkah chapter 2
[52:39] I'd like to speak to you for just a
[52:41] short time today on Unleashed potentials
[52:59] Esther chapter 4 and verse 13.
[53:03] and then Mordecai commanded to answer
[53:06] Esther
[53:08] now this is a powerful statement
[53:11] think not
[53:13] with thyself
[53:15] that thou shalt escaped in the King's
[53:18] house
[53:19] more than all the Jews
[53:23] for if thou all together
[53:26] Hold Us thy peace at this time
[53:30] then shall their enlargement and
[53:32] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[53:35] another place
[53:37] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[53:40] destroyed
[53:41] and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to
[53:45] the kingdom
[53:47] for such a time as this
[53:51] habakkah chapter 4 2 and verse 2.
[53:55] and the Lord answered me and said write
[53:58] the vision and make it plain upon the
[54:01] tables
[54:02] that he may run that readeth it
[54:05] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[54:08] time but at the end it shall speak and
[54:10] not lie though it tarry wait for it
[54:15] because it will surely come
[54:18] it will not Tarry
[54:22] you may be seated
[54:25] I want to read to you probably one of my
[54:27] favorite scriptures or portions of
[54:29] scriptures
[54:30] from the Apostle Paul in Romans chapter
[54:33] 8 and verse 28.
[54:37] and we know that all things work
[54:39] together for the good
[54:41] to them that love God
[54:44] to them who are called according to his
[54:47] purpose
[54:49] for whom he did for no
[54:51] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[54:54] to the image of his son that he might be
[54:57] the firstborn of many Brethren moreover
[55:00] whom he did predestinate then he also
[55:02] called and whom he called them he also
[55:04] Justified and whom he justified then he
[55:07] also glorified he's already did the work
[55:14] it's a finished work in his mind
[55:17] and he said and what shall we then say
[55:20] to these things
[55:22] if God before us who can be against us
[55:27] he that spared not his own son but
[55:29] delivered him up for us how shall he not
[55:32] with him freely give us all things all
[55:35] of Heaven belongs to you
[55:39] that ought to make you shout right there
[55:42] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[55:44] God's elect it is God that justified and
[55:48] it's as though you never did it in the
[55:49] first place
[55:51] there's not a sin marks against you who
[55:54] is he that condemneth it is Christ that
[55:56] died yea rather that is sitting at risen
[55:59] again and who is at the right hand of
[56:01] God who maketh intercession for us all
[56:03] who shall separate us from the love of
[56:06] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[56:10] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[56:14] perilous sword that ought to about cover
[56:16] everything as it is written for thy sake
[56:19] we're killed all the day long and were
[56:21] accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[56:24] and all of these things we are more than
[56:27] conquerors through him that loved us
[56:33] for I am persuaded that neither death
[56:38] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[56:41] nor powers nor things press it nor
[56:44] things to come nor height nor depth or
[56:48] any other creature shall be able to
[56:50] separate us from the love of God which
[56:54] is in Christ Jesus our lord
[56:58] Give the Lord a great big hand there
[57:07] just think about who is saying this
[57:09] about you
[57:10] not what you are saying about you but
[57:14] who is saying it about you
[57:17] it's always a dangerous thing when you
[57:19] blow your own horn
[57:23] but when you're quoting what God said
[57:25] about you the infinite God that said let
[57:28] there be a sun and moon and stars that
[57:30] same God thought of you before the
[57:33] foundation of the world and placed you
[57:35] in the Lamb's Book of Life and there's
[57:37] not a devil in hell can destroy that
[57:40] thought of God
[57:45] oh
[57:47] my God
[57:49] now I want you to remember what the
[57:51] prophet said
[57:53] now sons and daughters
[57:55] who has the most power before God
[57:59] an angel a servant
[58:02] he said they're his servants what are
[58:04] you
[58:06] his son and daughter
[58:09] who has the most power in heaven then
[58:12] a sinner that's been saved by grace or
[58:15] an archangel that's standing by his
[58:17] right side a sinner
[58:20] that's been saved by grace has more
[58:23] Authority in heaven than an archangel
[58:26] that stood by his side without a sin
[58:28] because he is a son
[58:32] and a son has more Authority than a
[58:36] servant
[58:39] Hallelujah
[58:42] Hallelujah
[58:48] a quote I found says that
[58:51] spectacular accomplishment
[58:56] is never preceded by less
[59:00] than spectacular preparation
[59:07] brother Brown says this he knows that if
[59:10] the people get the true revelation of
[59:13] the true church notice these next words
[59:15] and what she is
[59:18] and what she stands for that she can do
[59:22] the Greater Works
[59:24] she will be an invincible Army
[59:31] he's talking about you
[59:34] more than a squirrel more than a 42 inch
[59:37] Caribou more than a silver tip grizzly
[59:39] bear more than a fish live
[59:42] more than a possum on the porch he's
[59:45] talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ
[59:47] that was God's mission to the Earth with
[59:50] this message
[59:53] Hallelujah
[59:56] thank you
[59:57] Lord hallelujah
[59:59] brother bear says I'm so glad that a man
[1:00:02] can so completely serve God
[1:00:05] till the devil don't know what to do
[1:00:07] with him
[1:00:13] I want to say this to you regardless of
[1:00:15] your fears and regardless of your
[1:00:17] anxieties I hope you're awake this
[1:00:19] morning Satan can't take your life
[1:00:24] until God is finished with you
[1:00:26] there is nothing that can happen unto
[1:00:28] you unless God permits it there's no big
[1:00:31] evil can come unless God permits it and
[1:00:35] it's for your good he's working it out
[1:00:39] [Applause]
[1:00:41] I want you to remember as God's Prophet
[1:00:43] as a seer of this age
[1:00:46] God's thoughts not William branham's
[1:00:48] thoughts called you the final voice
[1:00:56] the final witnesses to the final age
[1:01:01] who is saying that
[1:01:04] who is declaring you
[1:01:06] to this position
[1:01:08] more than a man
[1:01:11] and I'm saying these words to you more
[1:01:13] than a man
[1:01:15] God's saying that about you
[1:01:23] the other man says that
[1:01:25] the hour is here
[1:01:28] if I could have been back there before
[1:01:30] the days that the world was created
[1:01:34] and looked down and seen the whole thing
[1:01:38] and the father had said to me what day
[1:01:41] would you want to live in
[1:01:44] I would say now
[1:01:48] this is the hour
[1:01:51] this is the greatest hour that the
[1:01:53] church
[1:01:55] has ever moved in
[1:01:57] just before the coming
[1:02:00] of the bridegroom
[1:02:02] Jesus would say it like this in Luke
[1:02:05] chapter 9 and verse 62 and Jesus said
[1:02:08] unto him no man having put his hand to
[1:02:11] the plow and look it back it's fit for
[1:02:14] the kingdom of God
[1:02:18] brother Brian said this God's strategy
[1:02:20] is to take empty-human vessels
[1:02:25] and shake the world with it
[1:02:29] Patrick Henry stood to his feet and made
[1:02:32] a proclamation one day that shook our
[1:02:34] nation
[1:02:35] and actually helped create this nation
[1:02:38] and he used these words he had got them
[1:02:41] from a preacher here in Culpepper
[1:02:43] Give me liberty
[1:02:48] or give me death
[1:02:50] it was more than a statement it was a
[1:02:54] life
[1:02:56] I refused to live in laodicea
[1:02:59] and just become a part of it
[1:03:02] this world is not my home I'm just a
[1:03:05] passing through
[1:03:07] my citizenship is Way Beyond the United
[1:03:10] States of America my kingdom is heaven
[1:03:13] that's where I'm headed to my feet are
[1:03:17] going to walk on streets of gold my eyes
[1:03:20] are going to see walls of Jasper and
[1:03:23] Gates of peril I'm going to stand at the
[1:03:26] feet of Jesus Christ who is the King of
[1:03:29] Kings and the Lord of lords I I will sit
[1:03:34] at the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:03:36] there's no going back I'm only pressing
[1:03:40] forward
[1:03:41] [Applause]
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:47] another man was known by a sermon that
[1:03:50] or a speech that he gave
[1:03:54] a man stood in front of him and spoke
[1:03:57] for two hours
[1:03:58] nobody remembers his name
[1:04:02] but when a tall lanky man with a beard
[1:04:06] with the concern of the whole United
[1:04:09] States of America that was broken and
[1:04:12] shattered
[1:04:14] brother against brother sister against
[1:04:17] sister
[1:04:18] a nation divided
[1:04:20] he gave an address that is remembered to
[1:04:23] this day that Gettysburg Address
[1:04:27] where he shook Nations
[1:04:30] and reminded us that God is God
[1:04:38] sometimes we have to be reminded of Who
[1:04:40] We Are
[1:04:44] nothing great has ever been done without
[1:04:46] persistence
[1:04:48] there's no testimony that's ever been
[1:04:50] molded and been able to put down on
[1:04:52] paper unless it was definite overcoming
[1:04:56] life is not Hollywood
[1:05:00] life is difficult there's going to be
[1:05:02] some trouble in your life you haven't
[1:05:05] had trouble it's just you're getting
[1:05:07] ready for it
[1:05:09] trouble may be behind you you may be
[1:05:12] going through it and trouble's going to
[1:05:14] be in front of you we were born in sin
[1:05:16] we were shaping an iniquity man is born
[1:05:19] of woman in his few days and full of
[1:05:21] trouble
[1:05:23] but God said I'll never leave you I'll
[1:05:25] never forsake you he's an infinite God
[1:05:29] I heard brother Brown say the other day
[1:05:31] he knows how many fleas that's been in
[1:05:33] the Earth how many times that they
[1:05:35] batted their eyes
[1:05:37] and the highest species more than an
[1:05:40] angel but Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:42] that's how much God thinks about you
[1:05:46] it's not how much the world thinks about
[1:05:49] you it's not even how much you think
[1:05:51] about yourself it's what God thinks
[1:05:54] about you
[1:05:56] and with our God there's nothing that is
[1:05:59] impossible
[1:06:00] brother round said give me it give me a
[1:06:03] housewife give me he says notice this
[1:06:05] give me a preacher give me a Christian
[1:06:07] give me a housewife give me a farmer a
[1:06:10] factory worker that'll put God first in
[1:06:13] everything
[1:06:16] and I'll show you a man that'll be
[1:06:18] successful in spite of all that the
[1:06:20] devil can put on him
[1:06:23] Give the Lord a great big hand right
[1:06:25] there
[1:06:28] [Applause]
[1:06:33] Mike shazefski
[1:06:35] one of the greatest coaches that ever
[1:06:37] lived
[1:06:41] his team was
[1:06:44] was
[1:06:45] down like never before a record amount
[1:06:53] he brought him into a huddle
[1:06:57] they came out of that huddle and shut
[1:06:59] the other team down
[1:07:01] and they want an epic fashion
[1:07:04] many would ask him what did the players
[1:07:07] what did he say in the Huddle that made
[1:07:10] everything change
[1:07:12] did he scream at you did he berate you
[1:07:15] did he say anything bad
[1:07:17] and all of them are said with the same
[1:07:19] chorus no he reminded us of Who We Are
[1:07:28] Angelo Dundee who was the groin of the
[1:07:30] greatest Corner men for boxers
[1:07:33] he trained a lot of men like Muhammad
[1:07:35] Ali Sugar Ray Leonard and a lot of men
[1:07:41] and there's one of a couple of these
[1:07:42] statements
[1:07:43] he said I didn't have to tell Ali how to
[1:07:46] fight
[1:07:48] I just had to remind him of who he was
[1:07:57] he was losing an incredible bout about
[1:08:00] it shouldn't be lucid
[1:08:03] and he got him into the ring and he got
[1:08:05] him into the corner he says
[1:08:08] you're gonna blow it son
[1:08:12] you're going to blow it
[1:08:14] remember who you are
[1:08:17] I want you to remember that statement
[1:08:20] sometimes I like to scream it in some
[1:08:22] people's ear
[1:08:26] you're going to block
[1:08:28] it we're right at the rap so keep your
[1:08:31] focus
[1:08:33] get over yourself
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:39] ever yourself get yourself out of the
[1:08:41] way
[1:08:43] your greatest enemy is not your husband
[1:08:45] wife Pastor teacher not the president of
[1:08:49] the United States your greatest enemy is
[1:08:51] yourself
[1:08:59] I flunked the sixth grade
[1:09:02] all F's
[1:09:04] it must have been they needed somebody
[1:09:06] to go to the seventh grade so they
[1:09:08] promoted me forward to the seventh grade
[1:09:11] I don't understand to this day
[1:09:15] there was a teacher named Mrs Bennett
[1:09:19] she was a seventh grade teacher
[1:09:24] one day she called me out of another
[1:09:25] lady's class
[1:09:28] she called me in that lady was named Mrs
[1:09:31] Hall
[1:09:33] I disdained her
[1:09:36] I used to stain for a good word there
[1:09:40] she called me out of that class and
[1:09:44] took me to a desk and sat down
[1:09:48] and she said Mr Spencer
[1:09:52] you're probably one of the most talented
[1:09:54] people that I've ever taught
[1:09:57] you'll probably have the greatest gift
[1:09:59] that I've ever taught or ever will teach
[1:10:02] but you haven't recognized it
[1:10:05] you need to reach deep within yourself
[1:10:10] and find that gift
[1:10:17] she would pull me into her class
[1:10:19] moved me from another class and pull me
[1:10:22] into her class then in studied Halls she
[1:10:24] would take me and and and I would spend
[1:10:27] time in her class and every day she had
[1:10:29] me to write short stories
[1:10:33] when I would give a little dilatory kind
[1:10:35] of lose my focus she would remind me
[1:10:38] you're not looking deep enough
[1:10:43] you're only looking at the outside
[1:10:45] you're not looking deep enough
[1:10:48] fate would have it that her husband
[1:10:51] would pass away
[1:10:52] our principal his wife would pass away
[1:10:55] both from cancer they would marry
[1:10:58] in my 30s I cleaned her chimney I didn't
[1:11:02] know who I was cleaning the chimney for
[1:11:06] when I finished cleaning the chimney she
[1:11:08] said I'd like for you to sit down here
[1:11:12] and she looked me in the eyes and
[1:11:15] she said Ron I want to talk to you
[1:11:18] she said maybe nobody else has had
[1:11:20] history with you like I have
[1:11:23] she said but you still have not
[1:11:25] discovered the gift within you
[1:11:28] I talked to you in the seventh grade
[1:11:30] look deep within yourself
[1:11:33] reach down there
[1:11:36] she looked at me and she said Chimney
[1:11:38] Sweep is not your purpose in life
[1:11:46] that's not your purpose
[1:11:48] that's your job but you haven't reached
[1:11:51] deep enough inside to find what God's
[1:11:54] gift is in your life
[1:11:58] a school teacher taught me that
[1:12:00] a school teacher would tell me that in
[1:12:03] my 30s
[1:12:06] I'd like to stand as your pastor and say
[1:12:08] some of you need to reach deep with
[1:12:10] inside yourself
[1:12:12] I've never told yourself told you those
[1:12:14] statements
[1:12:16] but sometimes we gotta need to look back
[1:12:17] and say well brother Ron I've been
[1:12:19] through a lot of pain in my life
[1:12:20] sometimes your pain becomes your
[1:12:23] strength
[1:12:26] sometimes your pain becomes the courage
[1:12:29] to drive you forward
[1:12:32] blind can't hear cancer whatever the
[1:12:36] situation is your new life your DNA grab
[1:12:40] bag that you've been given in your life
[1:12:42] you're greater than all of that
[1:12:46] brother run but I've made some mistakes
[1:12:48] but you lived through it
[1:12:50] get up
[1:12:52] I'm gonna scream to you get up I want to
[1:12:56] stand in your corner this morning get up
[1:12:59] reach deep within yourself
[1:13:02] [Applause]
[1:13:12] some people have a doctorate degree on
[1:13:14] pity party
[1:13:19] some people have a doctorate degree and
[1:13:21] all about themselves
[1:13:23] you don't dare ask them how are you
[1:13:25] today you know you'll be there 30
[1:13:27] minutes
[1:13:41] let's get lower
[1:13:45] one day Thomas Edison
[1:13:47] came home and gave a paper to his mother
[1:13:51] he told her said my teacher gave me this
[1:13:53] paper to me and told me that
[1:13:56] to only give it to my mother
[1:14:00] his mother's eyes were tearful as she
[1:14:03] read the letter out loud to her child
[1:14:07] your son is a genius
[1:14:11] this school is too small for him
[1:14:14] and doesn't have enough good teachers
[1:14:16] for for training him
[1:14:18] please teach him
[1:14:21] yourself
[1:14:23] after many years
[1:14:25] after Edison's mother died
[1:14:28] and he was now one of the greatest
[1:14:30] inventors of the century one day he was
[1:14:33] looking through old family things and
[1:14:35] suddenly he saw an old foil did paper
[1:14:38] and the corner of the drawer in the desk
[1:14:41] and he ought took it and he opened it
[1:14:43] and the paper was written
[1:14:46] your son
[1:14:48] is mentally ill
[1:14:52] we won't let him come to school anymore
[1:14:55] and Edison cried for hours and then he
[1:14:58] wrote in his diary Thomas Calvin Edison
[1:15:03] what's a mentally ill child
[1:15:07] that my hero mother
[1:15:09] became the genius of the century
[1:15:19] oh yeah
[1:15:20] I would say there's some Mrs Bennett's
[1:15:23] Sitting In This Crowd
[1:15:27] there are some teachers that care
[1:15:31] and they look Beyond family problems and
[1:15:34] they look Beyond DNA situations and they
[1:15:38] look for the potential in a child that's
[1:15:41] acting up a child that's having great
[1:15:43] difficulties if they can capture that
[1:15:46] that's what's inside of them
[1:15:49] and get them to realize the gift that's
[1:15:52] on the inside
[1:15:55] you don't need to tell them how bad they
[1:15:57] are how horrible they are how miserable
[1:15:59] they are just tell them what they can
[1:16:02] become
[1:16:09] the word dumb the word stupid should
[1:16:14] never come out of your mouth toward your
[1:16:16] children
[1:16:21] if you've used those words to your your
[1:16:23] children repent it's because you had a
[1:16:27] demon out of hell
[1:16:34] foreign
[1:16:42] he was talked to like that I pray that
[1:16:44] you looked above what your parents told
[1:16:46] you
[1:16:50] one of the greatest preachers that I
[1:16:52] know
[1:16:53] was told he would never amount to
[1:16:55] nothing
[1:17:00] maybe you've been told you'd never
[1:17:02] amount to nothing
[1:17:04] I was
[1:17:07] but I didn't listen
[1:17:11] I chose not to listen to my
[1:17:14] critics
[1:17:33] what could be said there but I won't
[1:17:38] that's a bride of Jesus Christ you have
[1:17:41] his potential
[1:17:44] inside of you
[1:17:47] more than the DNA of your mom and daddy
[1:17:52] they are actually your weakness
[1:17:56] and when you catch that
[1:17:58] they are actually your weakness
[1:18:02] but God put something on the inside of
[1:18:04] you
[1:18:05] that's him
[1:18:08] and when he plants a seed whether it's
[1:18:11] grass or flowers or trees
[1:18:15] it reproduces itself
[1:18:18] cows reproduce cows
[1:18:25] that's what they do
[1:18:27] you've got horses and you may not
[1:18:29] understand it now
[1:18:31] but when horses have colts
[1:18:35] you don't go out there and find a calf
[1:18:40] they produce horses
[1:18:44] that's what they do so what happens when
[1:18:47] the Kentucky Derby is getting ready and
[1:18:49] the Preakness and the Belmont men look
[1:18:53] at DNA
[1:18:55] and they search the DNA and sometimes
[1:18:58] they pay millions of dollars
[1:19:01] for the DNA of the black line
[1:19:04] because it UPS the odds of having a
[1:19:07] champion
[1:19:08] but once in a while a horse will be
[1:19:11] soaked
[1:19:13] because it doesn't look like a champion
[1:19:15] it doesn't act like a champion
[1:19:19] but somebody that's got an eye
[1:19:22] will see it going around the ring and
[1:19:25] he'll give fifteen thousand dollars for
[1:19:27] it
[1:19:30] and he'll put it in the he'll put it in
[1:19:32] training because he knows there's
[1:19:35] something on the inside of it if he can
[1:19:37] only get that horse to believe it and
[1:19:40] catch it
[1:19:43] that's how much the last year's Kentucky
[1:19:45] Derby winner went for fifteen thousand
[1:19:49] dollars
[1:19:51] everybody else didn't believe he was a
[1:19:53] champion but one man did
[1:19:58] the whole world was against you even
[1:20:01] Lucifer himself said there's nothing in
[1:20:04] you
[1:20:07] but God but God said I planted something
[1:20:09] else inside of him before the foundation
[1:20:12] were on
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:15] and God reproduces God
[1:20:19] [Applause]
[1:20:26] Hallelujah
[1:20:28] Hallelujah
[1:20:30] the the members of the Virgin bride will
[1:20:33] love him
[1:20:36] and they will have his potentials
[1:20:39] for he is their head
[1:20:44] and all power belongs to him
[1:20:47] they're subject to him
[1:20:50] as the members of our bodies are subject
[1:20:53] to our head
[1:20:55] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:20:57] son Jesus never did anything until it
[1:21:00] was shown to him by the Father John 5
[1:21:02] 19. this harmony is now to exist between
[1:21:06] the the groom and the bride
[1:21:10] he shows her his Word of Life
[1:21:13] she receives it I like that he shows her
[1:21:17] his Word of Life she receives it and she
[1:21:21] never doubts it
[1:21:23] Glory
[1:21:26] never doubt it why don't you just say it
[1:21:29] with me she never doubts it
[1:21:32] and for nothing can harm her not even
[1:21:35] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:21:38] water will raise it up again here is the
[1:21:40] secret of it the word in the is in the
[1:21:44] bride as it was in Mary and the bride
[1:21:47] has the same mind of Christ for she
[1:21:50] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:21:52] and she performs the command of the word
[1:21:55] in his name for she has thus saith the
[1:21:59] Lord
[1:22:01] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:22:04] and it comes to pass like a seed that
[1:22:07] it's planted and watered and it comes
[1:22:09] full Harvest serving its purpose
[1:22:12] those in the bride only do his will
[1:22:17] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:22:21] I read that this morning again and again
[1:22:24] and again and again and again and I said
[1:22:26] there's not a devil in hell can make me
[1:22:29] do otherwise there's no power can make
[1:22:32] me do otherwise
[1:22:35] my future is clear
[1:22:41] I walked to the pulpit this morning you
[1:22:43] think well our brother Ron's just
[1:22:44] preaching a motivational sermon yep I am
[1:22:51] But the irony of it is I probably had
[1:22:53] one of the most difficult nights as I as
[1:22:55] a human ever ever had
[1:22:59] but that's all right
[1:23:01] that's all right his word's still true
[1:23:06] all right
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:15] they have thus saith the Lord
[1:23:18] or they keep still
[1:23:20] they know that it has to be God in them
[1:23:22] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[1:23:25] he did not complete all his work
[1:23:28] while he was in his Earthly Ministry so
[1:23:32] now he works and in through the bride
[1:23:34] he's talking about you
[1:23:39] brother Branham never shook her hands
[1:23:44] from for most of us 99 of us never
[1:23:47] preached
[1:23:48] in public to us
[1:23:50] but you've heard the words you've caught
[1:23:52] the message
[1:23:54] a lot of people looked at it said that's
[1:23:56] not for me that's right it wasn't for
[1:24:00] it it wasn't for them
[1:24:02] listen let's just be real honest with
[1:24:04] you this ain't for everybody
[1:24:08] this ain't for everybody
[1:24:10] this is for a select group of people
[1:24:15] you look at it and say that's the mirror
[1:24:18] that's exactly what I believe that's
[1:24:20] right you can show your neighbor you can
[1:24:23] show your family and they laugh at they
[1:24:25] make fun of it but it's alive to you and
[1:24:28] there's not a devil in hell can shake
[1:24:30] you away from it
[1:24:40] brother man said Jesus is waiting on his
[1:24:42] church to get ready
[1:24:44] his bride has made herself ready we got
[1:24:48] the potentials
[1:24:51] the holy spirit is here God is here the
[1:24:55] power to heal the sick the power to do
[1:24:58] all things that Christ did
[1:25:00] I've seen it demonstrated
[1:25:04] Myself by the holy spirit so the
[1:25:08] potentials is him
[1:25:12] but listen as long as it lays in
[1:25:14] potential form it's dormant
[1:25:18] you're gonna have a bag of very well
[1:25:21] certified seed but until you plant it
[1:25:26] it's only sitting in sight form in the
[1:25:29] side of the barn but you put it in the
[1:25:32] ground
[1:25:32] under the right conditions
[1:25:35] it will come up
[1:25:38] it will reproduce itself
[1:25:46] there will be nights maybe nights that
[1:25:48] you come here
[1:25:50] and you feel like you've just almost
[1:25:52] made a rapture
[1:25:54] enjoy those nights because there's going
[1:25:57] to be days you come here that you feel
[1:25:59] like every devil in hell
[1:26:01] everybody's talking about you every eye
[1:26:04] is on you you feel like you've got the
[1:26:06] moly growth but God is God
[1:26:10] hey God is God whether you feel him or
[1:26:12] you don't feel him
[1:26:15] whether everybody shook her hand on
[1:26:18] nobody shook your hand whether everybody
[1:26:20] smiled at you and nobody smiled at you
[1:26:23] whether you're feeling good or you're
[1:26:25] feeling horrible God is still God
[1:26:30] he's still God and if God before us
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:26:50] your name
[1:26:54] you're asked for your signature
[1:26:56] your signature is
[1:26:58] unlike anybody else's
[1:27:01] some of you can't read your own
[1:27:03] signature
[1:27:07] every one of you have a different
[1:27:09] fingerprint
[1:27:12] every one of you have a different eye
[1:27:14] pattern
[1:27:16] every eye pattern
[1:27:20] in this building is different
[1:27:23] not only that in the whole world is
[1:27:26] different
[1:27:30] God made you special
[1:27:33] you're fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:27:37] God made you that way that's why nobody
[1:27:40] can praise God like you can praise God
[1:27:43] there's much reason nobody can worship
[1:27:46] God like you can worship God and God is
[1:27:49] so big you can be in thousands of people
[1:27:51] worshiping God he can hear you
[1:27:58] and you may be in the midst of the
[1:28:00] deepest valley that you've ever been in
[1:28:02] your life and he can hear your prayer
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:09] so reach deep with inside of yourself
[1:28:11] and remember who you are and what you
[1:28:14] have been called to and the weapons that
[1:28:17] he has placed at your disposal and
[1:28:19] across your lips instead of confessing
[1:28:22] negative confess positive I am healed I
[1:28:26] am healed I am victorious
[1:28:35] you may not realize that but your name
[1:28:38] makes the kingdom of Hell shudder
[1:28:42] Shadrach Meshach could have been to go
[1:28:44] still makes the the world shadow
[1:28:48] let me just say shamgar
[1:28:54] still makes kingdoms of Hell shut up
[1:28:58] it reminds Satan
[1:29:00] we sent 600 demons to his house
[1:29:05] and he whipped every one of us
[1:29:09] and so be careful when you go to Full
[1:29:11] Gospel Lighthouse
[1:29:15] you better take a thousand and one if
[1:29:18] you're gonna do any good
[1:29:20] and then just look at the Devil you
[1:29:22] stupid devil
[1:29:24] I got the word of God and prayer is like
[1:29:27] an atomic bomb and when I start praying
[1:29:30] and words start going across my lips
[1:29:34] my prayer may feel like it only goes to
[1:29:36] the ceiling but my prayer goes to the
[1:29:39] great intercessor himself and I call the
[1:29:42] King of Kings the greatest champion on
[1:29:46] the scene and he is here
[1:29:48] [Applause]
[1:29:58] brother Branham called you lived voices
[1:30:01] Paul would call you written Epistles
[1:30:11] sometimes we come into the Earth and
[1:30:14] we think well what is my purpose
[1:30:18] what is my purpose
[1:30:20] Stephen do you mind if I pick on you
[1:30:22] just for a moment
[1:30:24] the gift that you have
[1:30:27] to be able to stand behind the pulpat
[1:30:29] and sing a song
[1:30:32] Hollywood would love to have
[1:30:38] Nashville would love to have it
[1:30:41] they'd like to produce that they try to
[1:30:43] train that
[1:30:44] but God put it inside of you
[1:30:47] and the enemy
[1:30:49] will remind you over and over again
[1:30:50] you're nobody
[1:30:52] does he tell you that you're nobody
[1:30:54] you're never going to be successful
[1:30:56] you're never good well remind him
[1:30:59] I've got a house that will never fade
[1:31:01] away
[1:31:09] and maybe the devil's whispered in your
[1:31:11] ear you'll never get married you'll
[1:31:12] never find a mate you'll never you have
[1:31:14] got so many complexes you'll never get
[1:31:15] anybody and yet you can say Hey listen
[1:31:17] in my eternal realm I'm going to have
[1:31:19] the right one
[1:31:20] we're going to spend eternity and I'm
[1:31:22] going to have children there
[1:31:25] yeah
[1:31:28] because God knows what's the potential
[1:31:30] of you
[1:31:34] can I preach to you
[1:31:36] can I preach to you
[1:31:38] that's what that's what Hollywood's
[1:31:40] looking for
[1:31:41] that's what the Kentucky Derpy guys are
[1:31:43] looking for potential
[1:31:45] and God knows what he put in you
[1:31:48] God's not guessing brother Lawrence
[1:31:54] brother Jordan God's not guessing
[1:31:57] but the rain no matter how much The
[1:31:59] Devil Makes You question yourself God's
[1:32:01] not in the guessing game
[1:32:03] he knows what he planted
[1:32:14] so when buddy Robinson he knew that he
[1:32:16] would he would travel two million miles
[1:32:19] have a hundred thousand conversions
[1:32:21] preach 33
[1:32:23] 000 sermons
[1:32:25] and Peter Cartwright who brother random
[1:32:27] would say call him out in in the
[1:32:30] greatest battle ever thought
[1:32:33] he actually preached in our area here
[1:32:37] another man would talk about when he was
[1:32:39] getting ready to have a Revival in the
[1:32:41] town
[1:32:43] and in that town he's cleaning the
[1:32:45] windows he's got the doors open and the
[1:32:46] bully of the Town said before you can
[1:32:48] have a Revival here you got to whip me
[1:32:51] he got down off of the ladder he rolled
[1:32:53] his sleeves up and whipped him
[1:32:58] he was at a meeting where 30 men walked
[1:33:02] in and wanted to fight him he whipped
[1:33:05] every one of them
[1:33:08] man you think we're brutal preachers
[1:33:12] and the Sunday after preaching that
[1:33:15] after whipping 30 men
[1:33:18] all of the other ministers said we'll
[1:33:20] have nothing to say after after what
[1:33:22] took place here on Wednesday night he
[1:33:23] said well I'll preach and he preached on
[1:33:26] the Gates of Hell will not prevail
[1:33:29] and the service went all day Sunday and
[1:33:31] all night Sunday night and all day
[1:33:33] Monday and all night Monday night all
[1:33:34] day Tuesday and all day Tuesday
[1:33:38] and on Wednesday they baptized 300
[1:33:40] people
[1:33:43] God's Got A Plan
[1:33:47] Nathan will not worth it
[1:33:50] Robert sheffy
[1:33:52] who is one of my favorite of life
[1:33:55] carried a lamb stem because his life had
[1:33:58] been so wretched as a child
[1:34:01] and he prayed and whiskey steals would
[1:34:03] be broken down by a tree way up in the
[1:34:06] top of the mountains and it would pray
[1:34:09] and you pray for a Mighty Oak Tree to
[1:34:11] come down off of that mountain and Crush
[1:34:13] that steel later in the night storms
[1:34:15] would come
[1:34:16] not just one time by coincidence but
[1:34:19] many times that happened
[1:34:21] most of the time the steel guy became
[1:34:25] the pastor of the local church
[1:34:29] one day he was down praying
[1:34:32] and in his prayer he said Lord I haven't
[1:34:34] had any persecution
[1:34:36] for weeks
[1:34:38] and about that time a a rock went past
[1:34:41] his head was he he said Thank You Lord
[1:34:54] a man named Spurgeon
[1:34:57] he was called the prince of preachers
[1:35:00] his own church put him out
[1:35:02] his own schools put him out
[1:35:04] but he still built one of the greatest
[1:35:06] biggest
[1:35:07] Metropolitan Halls one of the greatest
[1:35:10] churches that ever ever was built in
[1:35:12] that time
[1:35:14] it was a friend that was walking with
[1:35:16] him enlightened and struck that friend
[1:35:18] and killed him I say we're walking down
[1:35:20] the street and he said if God spared my
[1:35:23] life I give my life to Jesus Christ
[1:35:26] and he would go on to preach some of the
[1:35:28] greatest messages for his time that ever
[1:35:30] lived
[1:35:40] I'll just for for lack of time man named
[1:35:43] Moody
[1:35:46] Moody who is known for
[1:35:49] having 500 000 Souls come to the altar
[1:35:52] during his life
[1:35:55] he preached and he came to the end of
[1:35:57] his service and he ran out of time and
[1:35:58] didn't have an altar call
[1:36:02] Chicago burned down that night
[1:36:06] Moody went into an incredible depression
[1:36:10] he actually would move from the United
[1:36:12] States of America running
[1:36:15] and he was sitting in a barbershop chair
[1:36:21] everybody was talking and yakking
[1:36:25] and Moody was sitting in that chair and
[1:36:28] all of a sudden without saying a word
[1:36:30] men fell on their knees and began to cry
[1:36:32] out to God
[1:36:37] he never said a word
[1:36:41] as a man cut his hair he said I would
[1:36:43] never cut a man's hair with that kind of
[1:36:45] a presence
[1:36:48] when they asked him
[1:36:50] later they said find out who that man is
[1:36:53] that would cause that kind of a presence
[1:36:56] and he said I promised God I'll never
[1:36:58] preach again
[1:37:01] and so some men just talked to him said
[1:37:03] well
[1:37:04] why don't you just address the audience
[1:37:06] maybe just give a little testimony
[1:37:08] service
[1:37:09] asking a preacher to testify
[1:37:15] is like asking the Niagara Falls to quit
[1:37:18] running
[1:37:22] when you start talking about God
[1:37:25] and how great he is
[1:37:30] and Moody began to preach and came back
[1:37:32] to America and would shake the world in
[1:37:35] his day
[1:37:37] do you see he was trying to hide
[1:37:41] what was laying on the inside of him
[1:37:43] wake up children here we are
[1:37:47] God is planted something on the inside
[1:37:49] of you that you don't have to pump up
[1:37:51] you don't have to prime it the seed has
[1:37:54] got life inside of itself it has been
[1:37:57] predestinated to have the resources that
[1:38:01] it meets
[1:38:02] to meet the challenge of the hour
[1:38:09] the word that you're listening to
[1:38:13] will change your body
[1:38:30] now sometimes you walk in
[1:38:33] you walk into a service
[1:38:37] and you think man I don't know if I can
[1:38:39] contribute anything to this service
[1:38:42] I am drained from the weak how many has
[1:38:44] ever felt like that
[1:38:48] and then all of a sudden that song
[1:38:49] leader who's inspired
[1:38:51] he starts singing
[1:38:56] and he'll start singing another song
[1:38:58] before long your foot starts working
[1:39:01] and your hands start working
[1:39:03] and you start singing the testimony
[1:39:05] because songs is only testimonies and
[1:39:08] you start singing and words come across
[1:39:09] your lips that you start believing from
[1:39:11] your heart and all of a sudden you
[1:39:13] create an atmosphere around yourself
[1:39:17] all right be careful if you make fun of
[1:39:19] shouting
[1:39:21] be careful if you make fun of worship
[1:39:24] you know it's probably you've never been
[1:39:26] you've never got into it yourself
[1:39:29] so you'll only make fun of it
[1:39:32] because you've never been there
[1:39:34] but if you've ever been there
[1:39:39] if you knew what I know
[1:39:42] if you could only have went to what I
[1:39:45] have went through
[1:39:47] if you could have only walked through
[1:39:49] the valleys that I've walked to just
[1:39:52] give me a few minutes I I want to thank
[1:39:54] the Lord
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:40:04] just give me a few moments
[1:40:07] if I can preach to you just for a few
[1:40:09] moments and make you realize who you are
[1:40:13] then on Monday morning you'll get out of
[1:40:15] bed and go together
[1:40:18] [Applause]
[1:40:21] bird ever that's more than a book it's
[1:40:24] more than a tape it's more than a sermon
[1:40:27] now
[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:32] won't you just raise your hands and
[1:40:33] Worship the Lord right there
[1:40:39] he called you bone of food bones he
[1:40:42] called your life of his life he placed
[1:40:44] your spirit his spirit in you he put
[1:40:46] them's own self inside of you knowing
[1:40:49] you couldn't conquer by yourself he put
[1:40:51] himself inside of you
[1:41:00] Hallelujah
[1:41:04] the Holy Spirit the trainer himself is
[1:41:06] here
[1:41:08] he knows what's in there
[1:41:11] you know reach deep inside
[1:41:14] Rich deep inside
[1:41:16] we're sleep inside
[1:41:22] do you know what he planted
[1:41:25] do you know how powerful it is
[1:41:30] you can stand
[1:41:33] brother Greg one day I'd like to
[1:41:36] if God in his great infancy could
[1:41:40] maybe somewhere
[1:41:42] maybe somewhere take us to a place
[1:41:45] maybe he would just ask us
[1:41:47] would you like to see how I created the
[1:41:49] sun moon and stars I'd be I'd sign up
[1:41:51] I'd say hey oh yeah I won't see that
[1:41:54] Hey listen I want to see that
[1:41:58] I thought of it this is what I want to
[1:42:01] do
[1:42:02] and so when I thought of a son I wanted
[1:42:05] a son that would never go out
[1:42:07] would have enough energy that would heat
[1:42:10] planets millions of miles away and the
[1:42:14] seeds that was in the dirt maybe 12 15
[1:42:17] even 40 feet deep
[1:42:20] that I put enough just the right amount
[1:42:23] of heat on them
[1:42:24] until one day they'll wake up
[1:42:28] and all the sudden start fighting
[1:42:30] through the mud
[1:42:31] and all of a sudden start coming out
[1:42:34] Ron as a matter of fact all through your
[1:42:36] DNA I watched you all the way down
[1:42:39] since Adam
[1:42:40] and I watched your grandfathers go to
[1:42:42] war and I protected them and I watched I
[1:42:45] watched sickness come and the plagues
[1:42:47] come I watched them as they come and
[1:42:49] they had to go across the sea lay in the
[1:42:52] belly of a ship because they were trying
[1:42:54] to get away from religious persecution I
[1:42:56] was bringing your seed to Virginia
[1:43:00] and they went through incredible turmoil
[1:43:03] but I was watching over them when they
[1:43:06] thought they would die they were
[1:43:07] carrying your DNA
[1:43:09] and I refused to let them die
[1:43:18] run
[1:43:20] when your daddy first saw you
[1:43:22] he said you're the ugliest baby he ever
[1:43:24] seen
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:29] dad always had a way with words
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:34] I was dark
[1:43:36] my head was all twisted in
[1:43:39] maybe that's what my dad could see
[1:43:43] but if he could look down from the
[1:43:44] balcony of Heaven now
[1:43:48] he'd be screaming to me
[1:43:51] he'd be screaming to him finish it
[1:43:55] finish it
[1:43:58] finish it Ron
[1:44:01] Palmer be screaming feeling this
[1:44:03] down the hill we're waiting on you

[1:44:09] the potentials that you're preaching
[1:44:10] about we're living in it

[1:46:41] that's much higher there's a radiologist
[1:46:44] that's much higher
[1:46:47] than looking at cancer cells
[1:46:51] regardless of all their reports I've
[1:46:53] read one
[1:46:56] and he said Ron
