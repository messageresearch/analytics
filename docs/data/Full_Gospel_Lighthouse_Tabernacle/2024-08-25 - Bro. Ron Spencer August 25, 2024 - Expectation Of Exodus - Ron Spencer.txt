at 7:00 Saturday is at 5:00 and Sunday morning at 11:00 and there will be a meal following at Spotswood High School uh but our meetings will be held at mon videoo Middle School 7648 mcagis Ville Road in pinl and uh if you have any needs or if you're streaming and uh need that address again that is on our Facebook page there you can go and look that up and uh so just be remembering that there'll be some youth events and things going on there so just be remembering those things and like I said everyone traveling in um you can be seated after you've given um we want to remember that uh as you come in be reverent this is a school it is a public school so rules apply as a public school there will be no wondering uh there are cameras everywhere in these schools so just be mindful of all those things uh we will have just the restrooms that are provided there near the auditorium uh we'll have uh deacons and other ones that'll provide the parking and show you how to do those things and I believe brother Andrew may be uh showing you some of those things a little later here so uh we will have assistance getting in and out of the building showing where you need to go there so you won't have to wander around and wonder how to get into the school if you've never been there uh so want to remember the back rows we'd like to hold those for families with small children and uh those that have health problems issues um remember as you come in be reverent uh try to use the restroom before you go in and uh like I said last night there there is carpeted aisles but dur that within the chairs and rows it is tile floors so if you do carry a water just be mindful that it may ding hit the floor if it does roll like I said last night down the the floor brother Gabe will receive a new water bottle it won't come back to you amen like I said if you're that dehydrated that you need a to leader in service um please see us we need to pray um but uh if you need something to drink there is a water fountain provided there so uh we will have that and uh just be mindful that uh we want everyone to try to fill up the rows at the front and then work in not filling up just the in seats and uh just work back from there the last few rows will be roped off until we fill up those rows so as far as timing I believe the doors are going to open within an hour and 20 minutes before service um I know here in the past we've opened up Service uh within 3 hours so people can get the seat that they'd like but uh due to it being at a school we only have certain time frames that we can work with so that is the time before the schedule meeting start that we can open those doors if you have any needs please see one of the deacons if uh someone that is visiting needs Assistance or questions please just we will try to just meet each and every one of those needs that we can uh come in at least 30 minutes before uh not last minute and uh be reverent praying reading your scriptures and uh just be mindful that yes it is a school but this is also going to be the house of the Lord for that weekend amen so we're going to have a great time tremendous time in the Lord and just great things are going to happen cuz we're expecting amen you come expecting next week you're going to get what you expect amen if you expect to just sit there and just wowy W who will you'll get that I can just guarantee it but if you come wanting a Revival receiving one you're going to get what you ask for amen We Believe those things don't we amen all God's so wonderful isn't he amen I'm going to ask our brother

I used to live such a wicked life I had no hope Insight I was lost in darkness searching for life then one night in this here church after hearing what the word of the Lord said I gave my life to Jesus and the old man was dead and the man you see before you might look a lot the same I may wear the same clothes got the same old name you're looking on the outside you could see inside [Music] [Applause] St you see bre new man as the old man is dead yes he knew me yet he love me he whose Glory makes the heaven shine So Unworthy of such Mercy when he was on the cross I was on his mind [Music] [Applause] I was a I remember who I was I was lost I was blind I was running out of time s separated the reach was far too wide but From The Far Side of the chasm you held me in your sight so

alive and well amen well we're finally here we're finally here we're one weekend away from our our Labor Day Revival meetings and we're just overjoyed and excited and I know that we can feel the anticipation on the people's hearts and just hearing it from different places around the world and uh ones that are coming and they're expressing their gratitude for having these meetings and we're just we're happy that we can host a meeting like this and the Lord has blessed us uh in a way that we can do that and not just have not just have speakers but have men of God that have been used by the Lord for not just not just a day or so but these men of God have been well trained and and we've seen the Lord use them here in these meetings time and time again and we're just very excited about it all and we wanted to uh just kind of go over some things brother Matthew's already went over some things but we know human beings so sometimes you just have to reiterate some things reiterate some things and so we just want to also show you a few glimpses of what the school the entrance is going to be like and how most of us have been there that have grew up in this area have been there but some of us have not so we wanted to just kind of show you the path of our our parking and then the entrance to the building that way anybody here and anybody that is streaming will understand how we're going to enter into the building if you wouldn't mind just showing that to us here this morning as you can see this is overhead of the of the Mont video Middle School there there are two ways that you can come depending on your uh your destination how you're coming but as you see the very part front of the church or front of the school building is the entrance to the auditorium and the the white lines is how we would like you to travel through your path um just starting there if you're coming off of 33 you will actually pass uh the school just in a way just go right past it and enter right there at the the second um the second line there and just enter in you will we will have deacons ushers and parking attendance that will be there to help you uh find your place and uh if you can go to the next to the next scene there and this is the entrance there's a couple ways that we can get into the building but this is how we would like for you to enter if you're looking at the building straight on there are two entrances but we would like for you to take the entrance to the right and so if you need to just go back and find this on the on the streaming you'll be able to see that you can take a picture of it if you have some if you have trouble you just find the find the address for Mont videoo middle school and there'll be brothers there to help you help you find your way there so I I don't believe you'll have too much of an issue but as we as brother Matthew stated we're going to open the school an hour and a half before the service and that is that's just to allow our parking attendants to be there to kind of set themselves up and and make sure that uh everything is right uh there'll be no parking in the red fire lines fa fire lanes and so just make sure you don't park there because we will not pay your ticket if you park there and they give you one you have been warned so uh we want to be just mindful of saving seats we we want you to save your family seats but just be mindful of it because if it if it gets tight we will slide you in don't get upset at the deacons or the ushers they have full authority to to move you in we we just want to make this meeting as great as possible and I'd like just now if we could have all of our deacons and our ushers if they wouldn't mind just stand so that everybody here understands who the deacons and the ushers are brother go ahead brother ver brother Joe all right and all of our parking attendants please maybe just stand there all right so we certainly appreciate these brothers if you if you have any uh needs during the week uh of the meeting just see one of these brothers they will be sure to make sure that your needs get met if not take all of your complaints to brother Matthew he is the complaint department here at Full Gospel Lighthouse we're very thankful very thankful [Applause] that what would we do without brother Matt amen Sunday after after the meeting is over uh we're going to have a dinner and uh as we always have have been able to at Spotswood High School and we're very thankful for sister Wanda and uh their family the hle family for allowing us to um be able to do that and it's a great it's a great thing and um allows our kids to be able to enjoy some time there um but Sunday after dinner I want you to hear me loud and clear Sunday after the church service we will have a Sunday we'll have a Sunday dinner at Spotswood High School and this is pertaining particularly to Full Gospel Lighthouse only the workers that have been spoken to to work will gain early entrance into Spotswood if you get there before we close service at Mont videoo Middle School you will be locked out out outside of the doors and will have to wait until I get there to come in amen so say God bless you thank you brother Andrew and that is to do that is to allow all of our workers our personal workers to be able to set up and fully get everything set up with without having to deal with a crowd at that time so don't take it personal that's just what we're going to do amen so God bless you amen you can't imagine the things that people do but anyway so we are going to be streaming the services here on our YouTube channel as we as we do every single weekend if for some reason that the internet doesn't work those services will be archived we are we are making plans for for them to be there on the on the uh YouTube channel but if if for some reason you miss it or not able to grab it we we invite you to look at back at those they'll be on our our YouTube page notice there will be no services is here at Full Gospel Lighthouse next Sunday next Saturday next Sunday there will be signs down on the on the gates if you come here we will not be here the Rapture did not take place un let it unless it did take place we just moved our church to another building that weekend uh there will be no Sunday school next next weekend so uh we'll just we'll just allow you to you parents to train up your children and give them a little Sunday school lesson on the way to church that morning also if if uh just one more announcement if I could we need one more uh big cooler uh for the weekend if anybody if anybody has one don't raise your hand right now just go talk to brother alen we only need one but we need we need a we need a pretty good size one if you have one and you're willing to share it uh we' be we'd be willing to take it so and uh make sure you put your name on there cuz I can tell you sometimes when you go to a church event it's amazing the things that you lose so if you got a blue if you got if you got a shovel or you got a rake that's got blue paint on it I guarantee you that it belongs to one person in this building that's brother Ron Spencer it's amazing how many shovels and how many things you can lose at a church event not that they're thieves but man they just think you're blessing them sometimes so no we understand we've come out with some pretty good things ourselves so oh praise the Lord I I know that we don't have to worry about you being disruptive you're the most powerful people you're the most wonderful people and I think it's wonderful that you we have to make statements like this because sometimes it's like the prophet preached there's three kind of Believers and real Believers don't have to be taught how to handle themselves but you have to make statements like that just to just to kind of lay a foundation for those that are in a spot of unbelieving and just so that they understand CU a lot of people have not been churched we don't get excited we don't get excited when somebody comes here and they don't understand the order of the church and they don't understand how deacons work we don't get excited about that because we realize that there's a lot of people that have not been churched in their life that they've come here for the very first time they they've been in they've been in an experience like there's a lot of people that have not had church church order in their so we we have to say those things just to lay a foundation for the for the church services and we're very very well looking forward to it I believe you sisters know there that sister Connie and sister Katy are going to need some help Thursday evening and uh they're setting up some things for the weekend we're going to be setting up on Thursday um on Thursday evening and today after service we're going to be tearing down our sound system and cameras and all of that and be filling a trailer so we can take it so any brothers that would wouldn't mind just kind of helping us we don't need we don't need every brother but we do need some help and and uh if you're willing to work and roll your sleeves up we're willing to put you to work so so we just we just love the Lord with all of our heart we want to be remembering brother Timothy brother Tim and brother Donnie Reagan as we are coming into these meetings but I want you to know that today is a great day today a great day and you don't have to wait till next weekend to have church you don't have to wait and anticipate for that we got a man of God that should have been dead four or five years ago that's going to be standing behind this pull pit according to doctors they said he shouldn't be here but according to his report we got a man of God that's willing to stand here and preach the message of the hour and we want to put our whole heart I believe I don't believe that you got up this morning put on your church clothes and drove all the way that you did just to come here and have a half a service I believe you come here to have church have you come here to have church amen would you stand with us this morning we just just Worship the Lord just for a minute

each and every one of you and we are so glad to have you with us today brother Matthew and brother Andrew do such a wonderful job and I don't know I couldn't do it all without them amen I I was I have a reduced amount of energy now and so we're just so thankful that they're here to help us and amen and so we're just honored and I'll never forget the days that brother Homer told me said you know Andrew is a preacher and I think now that I think now if he could look over Heaven he'd say you're really a preacher so amen amen so we're just thankful for that of course Matthew he would say that about we were on our way to his graduation at Police Service and and he was beginning to talk about how that uh how he remembered when he became a real man mature brother Homer was saying it and brother Thomas you know how he would he would he he was all he just a little bit full of himself and so he say you know Matthew's a real man he's a real man we got to the red light there before we were to go in to ral's restaurant where our celebration was going to be at and he he said you know he's a real man he's he's a real man and I just asked him I said what do you think about me and brother Andrew he said never make it you'll just never make it Hallelujah so that's why we put the load on brother Matthew and he's a real man I want to say something else before we get into the word I we have a new we have a new member a new version brother Jimmy props amen he's a new version he's just I told somebody this week I said he's not even the same guy that he used to be if you if you've been around him if you would was around him before and you're around him now you know he's a new man just a new man and I I want to say how much I I I'm so happy I'm so happy about that you know I don't like any fake or any put on or you know I don't like nonsense I like real and uh I just am so happy I'm just just so happy and so we're just so thrilled about that amen if you will turn with me to Luke 10 and verse 21 last night was just a masterpiece of a service and we don't say that just to say that we we just are so thrilled and and you're the pullers of the word and so you pull all of this out and so so today I want to speak to you on the expectation of Exodus amen I I shared that with brother George Quinn yesterday and he said where do you get those titles from well brother brandham and so I I shared that with him Luke chap 10 and verse 21 and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto the babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight and all things are delivered to me of my father and and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him that's quite a statement incredible scripture and he turned him unto the disciples and he said privately and I want to say this to you blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them more than just for an exercise I I want to read this the scripture together this last scripture and I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated haven't forgot you brother Jonathan and sister re so glad to have you guys with us and amen so honored that you would be here with with us from Brother Tom Rays brother Bisal and we're so honored that you're here I want to share with you brother Brandon says we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages this Leo ofan Church age is the grandest of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age now that's the prophet of our day sharing those words about our day but he not only could see the lot of seean church age but he could look forward he could look forward and see in the marriage supper of the lamb and the resurrection and the bride coming to her maturity I believe brother brandom would be very proud to look at this audience and audiences around the world and see us more than just a Pentecostal move more than just God said a prophet but to realize who you are to realize who you are and this is more than just this next verse is more than just a prophetic verse but it's a verse that we're getting ready to step into and I heard as Revelations 19:6 I'm sorry sister Stephanie and I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude as a voice of Great Waters and as a voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reign us let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come now this verse is happening and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ar raid and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called to the married supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God aren't you glad of that today now

you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions this is not brick and mortar and if it were not so I would have told you now notice these next words I go to prepare a place for you amen amen we could shout right there for the rest of the evening these are very familiar scriptures 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse one but of the times of the Season Brethren ye have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night and when they say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travaileth upon a woman which child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness ye Brethren are not in darkness that ought to cause you with have an expectation like never before ye are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of the light and the children of the day and you're not of the night nor of the darkness you want to shout now or hallelujah how did we get here he brought us here therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet of of of and the hope of the Salvation let's read this next scripture together for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ he has not appointed us to a tribulation period brother Doug let us remind oursel of one thing the tribulation period brother brand said the Holocaust with would be like a Sunday afternoon picnic that's right and that's what we're getting ready to escape from a lot of people say what the Holocaust was a myth let me just remind you those Jews were being driven back to Israel are you with me six million Jews gave their life for being a Jew but God has prepared white robes for every one of them their life was not given in vain God God has rich in Mercy the devil don't ever win he never wins the one that's fighting your life and tormenting you while he only has a chance he's a loser Psalms chapter 27 which is the verses that brother Brandon preached on as the Rapture the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War shall rise against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble we're here for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me set up me upon a rock how powerful that is Hebrews 11 and verse 8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out after a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obey and he went out not knowing whether he went and by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise notice these next words for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God how did he know he met the king now there was special special promises that was given unto Abraham first of all these God spoke to him not that only was going to have a child and it was going to come through Sarah but he said these words thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy talked about a sojourning that the children would be let me just say this to you those those promises that he made to Abraham they were passed down maybe even in story form promises that were were given from God himself to Abraham and as it would go to Isaac and then to Jacob then to Joseph and his Brethren and they would sojourn in in Egypt for for about 400 years and at first they wasn't slaves at first they wasn't slaves it's kind of like sin at first it didn't seem like it was a treacherous trap and you were talked into it or you were moved into it but after a while you became a slave to it but at first and you know even in Goan they had the better Farms they had the better lands they had the better Foods they had the better the Better Properties because God was always with them even being slaves God was always the light was always with them because of who they were but there was a promise to them that you always won't be here you won't stay here and as they go get near to the promised time of 400 years and now we go past 400 years we go 40 years past and God sends them a prophet to remind them is everybody okay to remind them of who they were and who God was and how powerful God was and God began to show his signs among them fleas and all of the different things and water turning into blood frogs and then there was a promise of a token I'd like to say this to you we're we are watching amen if you've got any any spiritual being at all we're watching prophecy being fulfilled we're watching brother bram's words being fulfilled I'm not going to brother Tim PR made a long list that that goes with camia and he made a a a long list of brother bram's words and it was phenomenal I'll be honest with you I don't know if some of you could handle it but Elijah told us that's the way it would be and and I I just want I'm going to say something pretty strong here Donald Trump is fighting with prophecy he's fighting with prophecy I don't care how you vote not going to matter much anyway but let let me just say this to you we are on the precipice of the coming of the [Applause] Lord and you're listen the prophecy of has already been fulfilled our our our country is inundated with Sodom and gomorah we're inundated we're it's everywhere one of the sisters in Tennessee wrote that she went to a she went to a a local tea house and it's the first time that they had one bathroom same gender bathroom women and men going to the same bathroom I don't think I'd be very comfortable with that and one of the girls that was with them goes to a college and she said we have a neutral gender bathroom and and that's the way you go you go with men and you go with women where are we at now that shouldn't offend you we've murdered babies for years and I don't care how you look at that politically let me just say it's [Applause] murder it's absolutely murder and and the same and the same murder Spirit happened in Egypt when Moses was born it happened with Jesus when Jesus was born and it happened in this age because you was born brother Brown began to explain there's a bride coming on the earth there's a bride coming on the earth and the devil did everything that he could to destroy you even before you were born are you with me now now you know I I just want to say some pretty strong things this morning that was light but now I'm going to talk to you pretty strong when it comes to the Rapture if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you don't have oil in your land you're not going when I get on an airplane I can't just walk them and say I want to go to Edmonton or I want to go to Saskatoon or or I want to go to stport I got to have a ticket and that ticket is for that particular airplane and that particular luggage compartment and that comp particular seat not just because I want to go oh but I want to fly I I want to go in the Rapture well there's some things that you're going to need to [Applause] have you're going to need to have you you got to have it for the expectation of the Rapture you've got to get yourself [Applause] prepared if you're going on a vacation you start talking about it for a little while and you start putting things in your luggage and and you start getting ready you make your car ready and you make sure that it's it service well and if you don't do those things you're just plain stupid you get down the road 150 miles your your car gets too hot or you start car starts knocking your tires go flat on listen you do things in preparation listen if you don't prepare you're it's a it's failure listen for this message God sent a prophet he Vindicated him night after night after night after night he not only Vindicated the messenger he's Vindicated you through every Temptation and trial and things that you've went through he's been there you don't have to wonder whether God's with you he's been proving himself with you for decades you're not ringing your hands over and over and over I I I hope he's with me listen we know he's Ry he's proved himself over and over and over again we know that he's with us this ain't no accidental thing we know who we are we know what we've been called for we know that we have the identification the Holy Ghost is his life living on the inside of us it's more than a sensation amen listen when you would give up he grabs a hold of you brother Brandon would have give up but he grabbed a hold of when I would have give up he grabbed a hold to me how many times you've give up brother Ron how many times do you quit you don't want to know my flesh gets weak My Flesh gets tired as doctors would tell me brother Ron not brother Ron but Ron in this journey when you get too tired of fighting you just let us know and we'll pull the medicine away from you it won't take long after that I just look at him and say I'm not ever going to get tired of [Music] fighting I was probably sicker yesterday evening before coming to church than I've ever been be really honest with you we stopped right in front of MC and I went and I went and I went and I went and I continued to throw up and the trooper over here grabbed a bunch of wipes and she started cleaning my black suit off and my tie off and my shoes off cleaned my mouth and she said you want me to take you home I nope I'm good now Hallelujah I walked outside did it again outside but when I when I got finished I didn't say poor pity me cuz I knew God was going to move last night and I wanted to be a part of it and I want to tell you the devil will never win he'll never win I say that about fighting cancer but every one of you have to fight things why don't you just tell that devil this morning you'll never win you'll never win you might fight me till the day of the Rapture but you'll never never never never [Applause] win when those children of Israel had an expectation as they saw all of those things that was happening to Egypt it built their faith to get them ready we're leaving here amen this nice house that I live in we're leaving it when they heard the token was preached that there had to be blood applied and they had to have the lamb and had to eat the lamb in a certain way they had to prepare themselves they had to dress in a certain way they dressed rest prepared to leave I want you to tell your children we're getting ready to take a Rapture we're going to leave this house we're going to leave this Ford we're going to leave this Chevrolet we're going to leave this battery powered car we're leaving it somebody else can have it cuz where we're going we won't need it no more we're going to have some jobs to do we're expecting a resurrection you tell your children we're going to meet people that you never met there's going to be people that come up our driveway and walk and knock on our door it's going to be Mama it's going to be my aunt it's going to be my Lov ones they died old and they died decrepit but they're going to be in [Applause] health we're going to have a reunion now that's not just a fantasy that's our expectation we have an expectation for one of the greatest meetings we've ever had next week and brother BR said you get what you expect now we're not surprised we're not surprised at the political world doing what it's doing none of us are taken in shock here amen can you all say Amen right there if if you are shocked at what's happening in the political world you've been asleep that's right now I want to just I just want to take this week's events and just share with you Ukraine attacked Moscow this week knowing that Putin said if they go any further than the city that they had been at if they come near Moscow he's going to attack the West we are the West now that's what he said I'm not making this up you can go Google it however you need to do it but he is the leader that has been ordained and placed to do the job he's going to drop bombs on Rome he's going to drop bombs on the United States of America our Prophet told us that that's right there's not going to be one using the words Adam bomb hit America are you with me what if they start dropping regular bombs he didn't say regular bombs he said Adam Bomb I'm saying this to you get ready this morning Israel was attacked by the Hezbollah 250 drone missiles hit hit and some of them came into into Israel and they have evacuated 60,000 people in Israel they are fighting for their life the scriptures tell us that every nation will rise against Israel every nation will rise against Israel we are only days from America taking our stance against Israel that's right how you know that the woman that they'll vote in is completely against Israel so scripture will be fulfilled I'm just listen we're here we're not surprised that's right we're not surprised there was an earthquake of over 7.1 this week but the Earth will shake like never been before Los Angeles will slip beneath the ocean brother Brown actually describes exactly how it will happen it'll slip right into the ocean when will that happen it ain't up to me he's God I don't get enough pay for that but it will slip right into the ocean I was on an airplane one time and I was we were coming into Los Angeles I was headed for New Zealand and I was I was there two men was sitting be beside of me and one guy was talking about the earthquakes that happened in Los Angeles and he the man that was sitting beside him he was a welder he had been away doing jobs and he and the guy beside him him says do you ever get used to these earthquakes he said you you know they just happen all the time he said you know you just you know it's an earthquake you know it's an earthquake he said what do you think about that big one happening he said well my mama said that there was a prophet that stood here and said Los Angeles Los Angeles and she'll slide right into the ocean that's what mama said well I couldn't sit there still anymore I simply begin to pipe up mama was right I believe what that man said I want to say this to you we are not surprised that's right listen the children of Israel were not surprised they put the L on their door they made sure it was there cuz the death angel was coming this wasn't a political move it was a spiritual move and death was coming Saints let me just preach it to it death has come through Leota and the church World Is Dead kabot is on their door and the spirit of God will not return to them but there is a bride that has made her self ready now I'd like to just liken this to a couple of different things there was a a broker that bought slaves wasn't right slavery just didn't it just didn't quit when Abraham Lincoln was there it's still alive and well you just you just call it cor or you call it Merc or you call call it call it Washington commanders or Dallas Cowboys people become slaves to those things but the broker was he looked over everybody and he said I'd like to buy that one oh he said he's not for sale he's not for sale and he began to talk to him said do you feed him different do you clothe him different does he live in a different house he said oh no no no no he's he no no he said you know I was he said well I want to buy him he said you know he's he's not in the Blues and he's a hard worker and he's got a wonderful attitude and and you know he said uh he said you know as an owner owner of him he said I was wondering about that and he said I begin to do some research that back in his home homel land his father is a king come on but though he be in a foreign land and though he be a slave he continues to conduct himself oh I feel like blowing up right now he continues to conduct himself like a King's son Hallelujah [Applause] now I want you to understand I I have a passport from America we continue to fly the flag of the American flag here and I'm proud to be American brother Ram you go back and talks about identification or spiritual Amnesia he said I'm proud to be an America I'm identified in her glory and in her shame I'm not I'm not here this morning but but but that's what he said about it I will continue to be an American until I leave in the Rapture America's getting more rotten and more rotten and more rotten and you you can hear brother brandham said they'll before long they'll be carrying guns in the street and the immorality in the street we're here we're here we're here let me give you for instance JC Penney when he he went into vision of Hell listen let me just shorten it but what brother random saw me and you see every day what brother brandham saw he he we see every day he sees a woman with that a with that modern hair do and he sees that color over their eyes and listen listen sisters that ain't my that that ain't my but don't dress yourself like come on don't paint yourself up like Jezebel we're not from here we're not and men don't you be a bunch of sisses I don't think we're we're a bunch of rednecks here but I don't think but we don't need tight tight T tight jeans and come on bro be real ladies be real [Applause] men can you imagine the prophet of God walking up to a counter with blue and red nose rings 42 earrings stuff hanging all over them and stuff all the way up their arms can you imagine what he would say then on that's right I'm not making fun I'm just telling you how they're dressing is in reflection of [Music] Hell the reason they're they dressing like that they're in they're dressing like that because of that's the re reason they're feeding on that's from another world you're either being in infuence from one region or another I I I don't think it takes more than just a little Common Sense here if you're if you're being fed from God ain't none of that in heaven and if you're being fed from Hell there's no bottom to it oh brother Ron boy that's a good looking herit buddy listen I'm just spanning the audience and I caught him that's all I'm doing that's to just span the audience actually I look for people that want to preach with me that's what I look for [Applause] listen in heaven let me just tell you there's no adultery there Hallelujah there's no fornication there there's no murders there there's no cancer there well brother Ron what if I'd done some of them things well God Saves murderers listen even homosexuals he knows how to to save them I'm just playing up onest with you what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus oh precious is the blood brother Ron but I fell in sin get up get up get up get up in Jesus name now our expectation is to move our expectation is to go somebody's going to have to carry Joseph bones amen yes they're going to have to carry him and you said well what is the importance and carrying that heavy casket for Joseph what is the importance of carrying these caskets what's the importance because they knew and let let's get strong here they knew that there was no Resurrection coming in Egypt I'm going to be strong here for a moment those denominations did not accept the message there's no Rapture coming so carry my bones Joseph wanted to be buried where Sarah was born buried he wanted don't leave me down here now let me just say you're not just going to carry him 10 foot this is a commitment this is more than just I want to be a part of this thing this is a commitment We buried brother Denny's fathering had a great big casket they also had dug that that that hand dug that that that that grave site brain fog will do you a lot of damage but but I'll get there they dug that grave site it was huge you could have put that piano in it and then it came time we we did the funeral and it came time to to cover it up these boys and Adam and I didn't get in a hole but I didn't know if I get out they might bury me you know if you don't move but so fast they'll call you dad every once in a while I'll look up and there's a buzzard flying over and I go I'm trying to move faster than you [Applause] are listen you just didn't get in that hole and Pat around a little bit there's dirt that's coming down you got to put it in its place it's a commitment amen I thought it was a phenomenal thing to be a part of let me just say we just didn't leave denomination we are committed we just didn't come here to believe God sent a prophet we came here for this message is us we want to eat the book and take it in we want to become a reflection of what it is we want that life it's in there to be more than a quote we want it to be a living reality is that right ain't that right now let me let me stay with some meat here for a little bit he says therefore you can rest assured that what God has promised in the Bible he is going to do it as I listened to several broadcasts this morning about the attempted destruction of Israel listen they're they're trying their very best to drive Israel into the sea but I've got tomorrow's newspaper they're not going to do [Applause] it in that recent barrage that Iran sin against Israel it cost their economy over $550 million that's quite an expense but Freedom's worth it the barrage that was sent against them this morning they they sent just one missile that cost them $3.5 million I'm not just talking about Israel there's going to be some things that you're going to have to fight against and you're going to have to send the biggest missile that you got and it may be at Great cost but just go ahead and send it and they hated him without a cause they should not have hated him they should have respected him because why did they hate him because he was a brother not exactly that they hated him because God dealt with him more than he did the rest of them they hated Joseph same message did not the Bible say in Revelations 13 that where this nation appears this nation is numbered 13 a woman's Nation ation it's a woman in the Bible woman is is on our coins it's on her it's a woman's Nation it's where the rotness of women begins starts it's where it ends at the rotness started in Eden by disbelieving God's word and here is where it's hatched out and women preachers and everything else the filth of the world comes right out of Hollywood the worst nation in the world more divorces the rest of the world put together you'll find out one of these days the Lord willing you'll see why this cursed thing you can see the blindness of the divorce and stuff that Satan has pulled over the eyes of the people and we're in a terrible hour our end is almost at hand now and I believe they're rotten rotten to the Core she appears in Revelations 13 number 13 and remember it's raised up in the lamb freedom of religion but then it received power from the Beast an image to like it and he spoke with all the authority and done the same rotten things that the Beast did before him and then tell me it's not prophesied of this nation the Amorite condition is just about rip cause they're already working in it and if you just stop for a few moments I just I'm just going to ask you I'm just going to ask you how many gay people you might send this out to get me in trouble but that's just how it is how many Wicked Sodom people are in our present Administration right now and then then look how many people are in our Congress and in our Senate that are transgender and gay I'll tell you the number it's 128 and then figure out how many Roman Catholics sit on our Supreme Court listen we are ready to go home home brother Bill Delaney you know this for a fact you asked brother Homer one time or they ask him how many people do you think you'll leave will will leave this church and the number was four four yeah one time he said 15 well that works really well if you called your family brother brandham one time called it 500 in the in the bride well that causes a lot of it causes a lot of what about me but brother brandom said you must believe if you're the only one going because this is an individual Rapture my personal hope is every one of us go amen amen every one of us I don't want none of you now I want you to listen to me I don't want none of you to show up the next Sunday and these Fords and Chevrolets are not here anymore where are they at listen I'm not talking about next week I'm talking about the weekend after the Rapture well brother Ron y'all been preaching that for decades yes we have and that's your mercy that's your mercy don't get dull don't get dull of hearing don't get numb television introduced immorality a a little at a time I went back and looked at it this week knowing this was coming one of the first immoral acts that happened on television I'm not going to call their names but was when a black man kissed a white woman there was outrage All Over America but now it's men kiss men there has to be ratings on television don't let your children watch this where are we at now let's go to churches now Pastor told me just recently I preached a horrible hard sermon this week and so I talked to him a few minutes I said what was so hard about it he said I preached on smoking smoking that was hard you quit that after you get saved [Applause] Hallelujah can you imagine if brother Brandon would come back and he went to some of these denominational preachers and walked in their pull pit listen I was invited to a Pentecostal convention by my uncles to come and preach there and I just was really polite they wouldn't want to hear what I got to say I don't want to hurt their feelings and their standings listen if I unload like Micah had to unload go ahead go ahead go ahead and do what you're going to do but I saw God use a demon from hell to come down and get into you 400 Prophets [Music] I saw the demons get into your Deacon boards and your your preacher boards and where that you're going to let up and you're going to let women preach and homosexuality in your pull pits I saw that Demons of Hell how long you think I'm going to be there America don't want truth are you with me you still with me amen could you say all say amen and God permitted a pharaoh to raise up who knew not Joseph and Ramses was born we are far enough away from the prophet and his ministry for he preached in Washington he met with presidents that's no unknown fact brother random could have he could have sold out and become like Billy Graham but because of you now God has to allow time to go on because some of you going to be born after 1977 how many's born after 1977 wow bunch of pups can you raise your hands again just I'm not going to pick on you that's a pretty good percentage of this audience God could not come because you hadn't been born yet and you haven't come to the message of the hour brother Ron we wanted it to come we absolutely wanted it to come and I want it to come now I I really do I need a new body but it can't happen until he calls for it to happen no preacher in charge of it that's right and now we have leaders of our Nations and I want to make that plural not just America but all over the world we have leaders of our Nations that don't know our prophet and as a matter of fact don't know our God even on that National Day of Prayer 9 on 911 2001 when Billy Graham was the leader of the National Day of Prayer he's the final speaker and they've had phenomenal amount of preachers and and women come from systems of a religion and they've all got up and listen he didn't get up and you know bring himself any different he said we all serve the same God Amen we don't Muhammad's not my God he's not my god sister re brother Jonathan's wife back here was raised Hindu and it caused an earthquake in her family when she recognized who Jesus Christ was do you think sister re you want to stand up there just for a moment you got a baby or whatever it was a phenomen thing for her to go against the grain of her family that's the way she was grew up but when she recognized this message there was a tremendous cost thank you for your testimony thank you I pray that God saves your father and your mother may they see something different in your life more than a church more than a bunch of rules may they see the life of Jesus Christ that's what I want to see in our children more than rules more than just a dress code but I want you to have the life the very life [Applause] I'm I'm coming to an end Noah know that the ark would [Laughter] float that was his total expectation this Arc will float I didn't get here last week or the week before last or the week before that cuz I feel like we're coming to this spot Brother Ray he had preached for 120 years but can you imagine how he felt when he saw two monkeys show up and two elephants show up and two giraffes show up male and female and he didn't call from them but something was on S side of them the god of nature was gathering them can you imagine his next sermon it's going to rain we're right in the hour it's going to happen I've been preaching to you for years it's going to happen it's going to happen it's going to happen it's going to be good it's going to be good I've been speaking this message for over 40 years but when I see with my own eyes that woman Russia bombing and making threats against America and she's just making not just making threats the generals are getting ready oh they're just political when I see it when I see what they're doing to Israel when I see what's happening in our churches
