[49:21] in store for us amen did you enjoy the
[49:23] word of the Lord last night amen amen
[49:27] thank you brother
[49:31] R amen if you have your Bibles today
[49:34] we'd like to look over in the scriptures
[49:36] here today in Luke chap 1 and verse
[49:38] 13 Luke 1 and verse 13 and would just
[49:42] like to take a thought that the lord has
[49:45] laid upon our heart for this service
[49:47] today on the result of the vision the
[49:50] result of the
[49:54] vision amen
[49:56] him remembering all those the needs are
[49:59] Brother David Farmer and the other needs
[50:01] here locally we know that we're very
[50:04] needy people but our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:06] is the one that supplies all of our
[50:08] needs amen let's just go to the Lord in
[50:11] prayer before we read the word today
[50:14] Heavenly Father we approach you father
[50:17] Lord in the most humble way that we know
[50:19] how father Lord we humble our hearts
[50:21] before the great I am and we recognize
[50:23] that we're insufficient on our own Lord
[50:26] Jesus and any man that has power father
[50:29] in their in their human might would be
[50:30] able to pull back the pages of this
[50:32] Bible but Lord it takes you father to
[50:35] come and reveal the very things that are
[50:38] laying there for many people have read
[50:39] it for many a years and read it like a
[50:42] newspaper but they miss what you're
[50:44] saying God I'm so thankful to know that
[50:46] you've given us an hour where we can see
[50:49] the things that are clearly given unto
[50:51] us in this generation and father the
[50:53] Bible would say the secret things
[50:56] that are the secret things belong to the
[50:58] Lord but the things that are revealed
[51:00] belong unto us and father we have such
[51:03] an inheritance here Lord to recognize
[51:06] Lord that you have not held back the
[51:08] Revelation for this hour but you have
[51:10] given it out freely to your your
[51:12] children in this hour to give us a
[51:14] rapturing faith to leave this whole
[51:16] world and to pull us aside father Lord
[51:19] as it as it is Lord it laid out in the
[51:21] scriptures to come out of her my people
[51:24] we recognize the pole of the Holy Spirit
[51:26] drawing us away from the things of the
[51:29] world but closer to you and we invite
[51:31] you father today as we've studied these
[51:34] thoughts looked over them we ask that
[51:36] the anointing of almighty God that we've
[51:38] stayed under that we've prayed to be in
[51:41] Lord to for you to come and take the the
[51:45] the hearer and the speaker and you begin
[51:47] to manifest your power with healing and
[51:50] demonstrations I know that there are
[51:51] many that are listening by the way of
[51:53] the internet today that have a need in
[51:55] their body and I would ask that the
[51:57] angel of the Lord would rise with
[51:59] healing in his wings and would go by the
[52:01] ones that are laid up on a couch or on a
[52:03] bed there maybe sick and different
[52:06] different afflictions in their body
[52:08] maybe they'll archive this and have
[52:10] needs father I pray that while they're
[52:12] hearing these words may they feel the
[52:15] touch of the mighty one restoring their
[52:17] bodies back to them Lord we give it to
[52:20] you father today to have your
[52:22] preeminence in this service so father
[52:24] we'll be careful to serve you and praise
[52:26] you and give you all the glory and honor
[52:28] that is due unto your name so in the
[52:30] name of Jesus Christ we pray these
[52:32] things and ask your blessings upon the
[52:34] word today in Jesus Christ's name amen
[52:38] amen Luke chap 1 and verse 13 and the
[52:41] Bible said that but the angel said unto
[52:43] him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is
[52:46] heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[52:49] thee a son and thou shalt call his name
[52:52] John and thou shalt have joy and
[52:55] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[52:58] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[53:01] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[53:03] or strong drink and he shall be filled
[53:05] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[53:08] mother's womb and many of the children
[53:10] of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
[53:12] their God and he shall go before him in
[53:15] the spirit and the power of Elias to
[53:18] turn the hearts of the father to the
[53:20] children and the disobedient to the
[53:22] wisdom of the just and to make ready a
[53:24] people prepared
[53:25] for the Lord and Zachariah said unto the
[53:28] angel whereby shall I know this for I am
[53:31] an old man and my wife well stricken in
[53:33] years and the angel answering said unto
[53:36] him I am Gabriel that stand in the
[53:39] presence of God and I am sent to speak
[53:41] unto thee and to show thee these Glad
[53:44] Tidings and behold Thou shalt be dumb
[53:46] and not be able to speak until the day
[53:49] that these things shall be performed
[53:51] because thou believest not my words
[53:54] which shall be fulfilled in their season
[53:57] and the people waited for Zacharias and
[53:59] marveled that he had carried so long in
[54:01] the temple and when he come out he could
[54:03] not speak unto them and they perceived
[54:06] that he had seen a vision in the temple
[54:09] for he beckoned unto them and remain
[54:11] speechless may God bless his word you
[54:14] may be seated today in the presence of
[54:16] the Lord as we stated it we' like to
[54:18] speak to you upon this thought on the
[54:19] result the result of the vision and we
[54:23] know that by the scripture and by the
[54:24] message message that we recognize that
[54:26] Zacharias had every reason to believe
[54:29] what God was saying unto him because he
[54:31] had many examples that were laying there
[54:33] he had won the father of faith our
[54:36] Father Abraham that had had been changed
[54:38] back and and and and had received a
[54:40] supernatural Miracle by a an
[54:43] acquaintance with meeting with MDC there
[54:46] but yet there was something on the
[54:47] inside of Zacharias that could not allow
[54:49] him to believe and we recognize that
[54:53] that that that God is calling calling
[54:55] for in this hour he is asking for a
[54:57] people to believe him and that's what
[55:00] Jesus would say that when the son of man
[55:02] will return will he find Faith because
[55:05] God is looking for somebody that is
[55:07] going to believe his word and if there's
[55:09] going to be somebody to believe the word
[55:11] there's going to be a word that is
[55:13] prepared for them to believe in and the
[55:16] Bible says here in Revelations 1 and
[55:18] verse 10 that I was in the spirit on the
[55:20] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[55:24] voice at of a trumpet and I saying I am
[55:27] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[55:30] what thou seest write in a book and send
[55:32] it under the seven churches which are in
[55:34] Asia under Ephesus and under Samia and
[55:36] under pergamus and under thara and
[55:39] Sardis and Philadelphia and under Le Osa
[55:42] and I turned to see the voice isn't that
[55:44] amazing I turned to see the voice that
[55:47] spake with me and being turned I saw
[55:50] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[55:52] midst of the seven candlesticks one lik
[55:54] un to the son of a man clothed with a
[55:56] garment down to the foot and gir about
[55:58] the patch with a golden girdle and his
[56:00] head and his hairs were white like wool
[56:02] as white as snow and his eyes were as a
[56:05] flame of fire and his feet like a Define
[56:08] brass as if they were burned in a
[56:10] furnace and his voice and the and his
[56:13] voice as the sound of many Waters and he
[56:15] had in his right hand Seven Stars and
[56:18] out of his mouth when a sharp two- wided
[56:20] sword and his countenance was as the sun
[56:22] shineth in its strength and when I saw
[56:24] saw him I fell at his feet as dead and
[56:27] he laid his right hand upon me saying
[56:29] unto me fear not I am the first and the
[56:32] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[56:36] and behold I am alive forever more amen
[56:39] and have the keys of hell and of death
[56:41] that scripture right there is absolutely
[56:44] amazing right there is that he had the
[56:46] ability to say that I am he that liveth
[56:49] and I was dead but I am alive forever
[56:53] more I think that's amazing script
[56:54] scripture that nobody nobody has ever
[56:56] been able to say those things except for
[56:59] our Lord Jesus Christ but notice what he
[57:01] says to John write these things which
[57:03] thou Hast seen and the things which are
[57:06] and the things which shall be Hereafter
[57:08] and the Mystery of the Seven Stars which
[57:10] th sawest in my right hand and the Seven
[57:12] golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are
[57:15] the Angels of the seven churches and the
[57:18] Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
[57:21] the seven churches so John was seeing
[57:24] John was was caught up into a day that
[57:26] was not his day but it was the Lord's
[57:28] day as the Bible is said here but we
[57:30] recognize that that that John was in the
[57:33] spirit and we recognize that if we're
[57:35] ever going to get anything from God
[57:37] we've got to be in the spirit of of God
[57:40] at that moment to catch the Revelation
[57:43] because John had to be in the spirit of
[57:45] the Lord to catch these Revelations from
[57:48] Jesus Christ and we recognize that what
[57:50] John was looking at was something that
[57:53] was not necessarily pertaining to the
[57:54] the hour that he was living in but he
[57:56] was looking at Jesus in the forecast of
[57:59] the future events of his churches of all
[58:02] the way from the Ephesian Church age all
[58:04] the way to the Le Osan Church age and
[58:06] that's what a vision is it is the
[58:08] forecast of future events that are
[58:11] setting out there and that's I think
[58:13] it's a wonderful thing that we are
[58:14] living in the hour that we're living in
[58:16] is because we are able to look and see
[58:19] and for tell things we have tomorrow's
[58:22] newspaper laying right here in front of
[58:24] of us by because of a word that was
[58:27] given unto us in this generation by
[58:29] Malachi 4 that we're not just pondering
[58:32] on these things we're not just wondering
[58:34] about these things but we have
[58:35] tomorrow's newspaper and it's it's very
[58:38] it's very disturbing for our for our
[58:40] enemy and his aspect of looking upon
[58:43] Upon Our Lives is that we already know
[58:45] what's coming ahead of us before it ever
[58:48] gets there and it gives us great courage
[58:50] and faith and it gives us great
[58:52] knowledge to know that we're not here
[58:54] alone tonight we're not here facing
[58:56] these things that we're looking out upon
[58:58] Sodom and Gomorrah that are that we're
[58:59] looking out there and we see the
[59:01] wickedness of the world but we already
[59:03] have somebody that has told us that
[59:06] these things are going to be and we know
[59:09] that the Bible said in habac Chapter 2
[59:11] that the Lord and the Lord answered me
[59:13] and said write the vision and make it
[59:15] plain upon tables that he may run that
[59:17] readeth it for the vision is yet for an
[59:20] appointed time and that's the thing that
[59:22] a lot of times people get caught up in
[59:24] God's process of time or in what we
[59:26] would say in the delay of time but God
[59:29] has a certain season in which a vision
[59:32] is going to be made manifest and you
[59:34] know God is God Is Not shook by by World
[59:37] by world events he's he's simply working
[59:41] at his timeline according to his plan
[59:44] and I think it's a wonderful thing to
[59:45] know that God has got great compassion
[59:48] upon his people he's got great
[59:50] compassion upon his people that he's not
[59:51] going to let anything happen to them
[59:53] that he doesn't already know and he he's
[59:55] got great compassion in bringing the
[59:57] word of God to pass so we recognize that
[1:00:00] that if as brother Williams said it last
[1:00:02] night that God had locked up on the
[1:00:04] inside of him attributes that had to be
[1:00:06] released so we recognize that that that
[1:00:09] we're living in an hour that we are
[1:00:11] called for a body change so we recognize
[1:00:14] that there are things that are locked up
[1:00:16] in almighty God that God has got to
[1:00:18] release to us in this generation to get
[1:00:21] us out of the condition that we're in so
[1:00:23] it tells us if God's got those things
[1:00:25] locked up on the inside of him then he
[1:00:27] must be the key to unlock the door to a
[1:00:30] Rapture for us so it gives us great
[1:00:33] courage to know that our God is a god of
[1:00:36] compassion Hallelujah he's a god of
[1:00:38] compassion this is not just this is not
[1:00:41] just a book that that we read as a
[1:00:42] newspaper but this is our book
[1:00:45] Hallelujah this is our inheritance this
[1:00:48] is our love letter I know a lot of
[1:00:50] people read it but I I want to make it
[1:00:52] personal to you this morning this is my
[1:00:54] book this is your book this morning and
[1:00:57] to think that today that we're not just
[1:00:59] another class of people we're a Divinity
[1:01:01] class of people we're a people that's
[1:01:03] called to come up a little bit higher a
[1:01:06] people that have been given a key
[1:01:07] Hallelujah we have been given a key to
[1:01:10] take a step one of these
[1:01:13] days hallelujah people that are built to
[1:01:15] enter in to the promises of almighty God
[1:01:18] I think it's wonderful thing to know
[1:01:20] that God has a bride that is completely
[1:01:23] one with him because the word on the
[1:01:26] inside of them when it's wrote and it
[1:01:28] becomes on the inside of you it makes
[1:01:31] the word for the hour made manifest in
[1:01:33] the generation that we're living in and
[1:01:35] we recognize as the body of Jesus Christ
[1:01:38] that we are literally living out the
[1:01:40] vision of almighty God and that's the
[1:01:43] thing about God is that God God he he he
[1:01:47] sometimes we look at it and we see the
[1:01:49] cogs of God's prophecy and we see them
[1:01:52] and we know that God's prophecy see they
[1:01:55] brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:01:56] that the cogs of Prophecy they grind
[1:01:58] slow but they're true so don't get
[1:02:01] caught up in the delay and don't get
[1:02:03] caught up in time because God has an
[1:02:05] appointed time for the vision to come to
[1:02:08] pass it's just like in our scripture
[1:02:10] reading when Zacharias was sitting there
[1:02:12] he was already laid out there here he
[1:02:14] was a priest he was supposed to know the
[1:02:16] scriptures but there an angel was
[1:02:19] speaking to him about his son that was
[1:02:21] going to come forth that was laying
[1:02:23] there seven 112 years before Zacharias
[1:02:27] ever met this Angel Gabriel there was
[1:02:29] one that had a conversation Isaiah had
[1:02:33] had a conversation with almighty God and
[1:02:35] said look there's going to be one and
[1:02:37] he's going to be crying in the
[1:02:39] wilderness he's going to be crying in
[1:02:41] the wilderness his voice is going to
[1:02:43] attract the generation that is elected
[1:02:45] to hear it to think that there Zacharias
[1:02:48] was in the moment maybe he couldn't see
[1:02:50] it with his eyes but there it was laying
[1:02:52] in letter form for him but then when the
[1:02:55] angel begin to release these certain
[1:02:57] seeds at a certain time he had to
[1:03:00] recognize that prophecy was in
[1:03:02] fulfillment in the moments and I think
[1:03:04] is a lot of times people miss or they
[1:03:07] the presence of God is unrecognized and
[1:03:10] they don't miss they miss where the seat
[1:03:11] of God is being deposited and Zacharias
[1:03:15] Hallelujah was sitting in a moment of
[1:03:17] time and the vision was for that
[1:03:19] appointed time and there Zacharias was
[1:03:22] in the moment Hallelujah he was in the
[1:03:24] moment of the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:03:27] but he doubted
[1:03:29] it but this is the generation where
[1:03:32] seeds have been deposited where prophecy
[1:03:34] has been been spoken over you but you're
[1:03:37] not a people that are going to doubt the
[1:03:39] promises of God you're stepping right
[1:03:41] into the fruition of it you're stepping
[1:03:44] right into it if Gabriel was there with
[1:03:46] Zacharias Gabriel was here with William
[1:03:49] brandham and he stood there and said I
[1:03:51] am sent from the presence of all
[1:03:54] almighty God it's that same one that
[1:03:57] stood there on the right hand side of
[1:03:58] the altar while he was talking about
[1:04:00] John coming and fulfilling Isaiah 40
[1:04:03] and3 it was the same one that stood by
[1:04:06] the altar at the right hand side of
[1:04:08] William brandham and stood right there
[1:04:09] and told him I am the one that was
[1:04:12] sent don't you worry about your strange
[1:04:15] birth you are sent
[1:04:18] here you're not just an ordinary man
[1:04:21] you're a prophetic man you're a
[1:04:23] messenger to this generation because
[1:04:25] I've got an elect lady out there that is
[1:04:28] waiting on you William
[1:04:31] brandom what was it William Brandon was
[1:04:33] stepping in to the into his position of
[1:04:37] Malachi th things that had been laying
[1:04:39] there for thousands of years seeds that
[1:04:41] had been deposited into the ground and
[1:04:44] William bram's in a cave talking with an
[1:04:47] angel what is he getting he's getting a
[1:04:50] commission to gather these seeds
[1:04:53] together yeah
[1:04:55] woo come on somebody he wasn't up there
[1:04:58] by
[1:05:00] himself he was up there with prophecy
[1:05:02] hanging over top of him and I think it's
[1:05:04] amazing thing to think about tonight or
[1:05:07] today is that there were seeds that was
[1:05:09] deposited that was going to come to pass
[1:05:12] we could look out there and see we could
[1:05:14] see sister Brenda Thon before she was a
[1:05:17] CLI and there God had saw her God had
[1:05:20] saw her as she was but he was not going
[1:05:23] to leave her where she was but he had
[1:05:26] something that was going to come
[1:05:29] forth I'd say this that God had you in
[1:05:33] his mind in that
[1:05:38] cave ah yes sir he had you in his
[1:05:43] mind what was it John when John stepped
[1:05:47] into the position a
[1:05:49] prophecy what was it he looked like
[1:05:53] Elijah he dressed like Elijah he
[1:05:56] preached like Elijah he ate like Elijah
[1:05:59] he was a wild man up there eating honey
[1:06:02] and and Locust things that I wouldn't
[1:06:04] dare think about eating but yet it was
[1:06:06] his it was under I think it's amazing
[1:06:10] that maybe people don't understand your
[1:06:13] position as the body of Jesus Christ and
[1:06:16] maybe men didn't understand why John was
[1:06:18] doing like he was doing but he was under
[1:06:20] the anointing of the hour that he was
[1:06:22] living in
[1:06:25] John could have been anything but yet
[1:06:27] there was prophecy that was sitting over
[1:06:29] top of him that he was going to have the
[1:06:31] spirit of Elijah upon his ministry that
[1:06:34] he was going to forun the first coming
[1:06:36] of
[1:06:37] Christ now William Brandon with that
[1:06:39] gift upon his life could have done
[1:06:41] anything with that he could have set on
[1:06:43] presidential boards but because there
[1:06:46] was anointing upon his life he had to
[1:06:49] stay true to the anointing that was
[1:06:52] there there's a lot of people that are
[1:06:54] sitting here that could have been
[1:06:56] something in this world in the aspect of
[1:06:59] the world of what they see men could
[1:07:01] have been lawyers men could have been
[1:07:03] politicians but because there's an
[1:07:05] anointing on your
[1:07:07] life you take brother Gabriel you think
[1:07:09] about how the Lord got a hold of him and
[1:07:12] he rose from the bottom all the way to
[1:07:14] the top in a matter of moments when men
[1:07:17] that have spent years upon years trying
[1:07:19] to get to that position but he had an
[1:07:21] anointing upon his life now that's just
[1:07:25] a sign in the natural but how much
[1:07:27] greater is it in the spiritual that we
[1:07:30] rise to our
[1:07:31] position come on somebody if you see
[1:07:34] something working in the natural it's a
[1:07:36] sign that God is working in the
[1:07:38] spiritual as
[1:07:40] well come on somebody if God blesses you
[1:07:43] on your job and you turn around and
[1:07:46] bless God with it then God can turn
[1:07:48] around and bless you in the spiritual
[1:07:50] with
[1:07:52] it
[1:07:54] well you see there was an elect
[1:07:57] generation that John was going to preach
[1:07:59] to John was going to preach to a people
[1:08:02] you see what he was under he was under
[1:08:04] that Elijah Ministry and he was going to
[1:08:06] preach to them and his ministry was
[1:08:09] going to turn the hearts of the father
[1:08:12] to the children but John could not
[1:08:14] fulfill Malachi 45 and six of turning
[1:08:19] the heart of the fathers to the children
[1:08:21] and the children to the fathers but he
[1:08:23] was going to fulfill one portion of that
[1:08:27] why it's because he was under his
[1:08:30] message he was under his anointing it
[1:08:33] was the power of Prophecy I think it's
[1:08:34] amazing to think about the power of the
[1:08:38] pool of Prophecy when you think about
[1:08:41] prophecies that were laying there in the
[1:08:42] scripture before John ever got there to
[1:08:46] think about it that it literally pulled
[1:08:47] John to it it pulled him to it it it
[1:08:50] pulled Zacharias to it what was it it
[1:08:53] was laying there so we had to fulfill it
[1:08:56] you think about this that that John was
[1:08:58] the voice of one crying in the
[1:09:00] wilderness and that John literally had
[1:09:03] the ability by the preaching of his
[1:09:05] message to pull people out of their
[1:09:08] cities to pull people out of their sin
[1:09:10] and make them go down there and wash in
[1:09:13] the muddy rivers of Jordan it was a pool
[1:09:16] of Prophecy that he was
[1:09:19] under and the Els always catch it and
[1:09:22] that's what William brandom said in
[1:09:23] things that are are inin made clear by
[1:09:26] prophecy he said not one time has it
[1:09:28] ever missed he said for who are
[1:09:30] predestinated will see it to see it we
[1:09:32] see it he said Jesus said no man can
[1:09:34] come to me except my father draws him
[1:09:36] and all that the father's given me will
[1:09:38] come he said it's the word joining with
[1:09:41] the word he said it can't do nothing
[1:09:43] else so you can't do nothing else
[1:09:46] whether you want to or whether you want
[1:09:47] whether you try you can't do nothing
[1:09:49] else but join up to this
[1:09:52] word brother Steven Byers come to me
[1:09:56] when he first when he first come to the
[1:09:57] message here and he'd come here a few
[1:09:59] times and then you wouldn't see him for
[1:10:01] a little bit he'd come here a few times
[1:10:03] and he wouldn't see him for a little bit
[1:10:04] and he come to me at one of these Church
[1:10:06] dinners that a lot of people say you
[1:10:08] shouldn't have in churches praise God
[1:10:10] but he come to me he come to me and told
[1:10:12] me he said look he said I want you to
[1:10:14] know something he had one of them he had
[1:10:16] he had that face on like I need to talk
[1:10:19] business with you for a minute this
[1:10:21] ain't just one of them casual
[1:10:22] acquaintances this ain't just one of
[1:10:23] them passing by a moment I got to have a
[1:10:25] moment with you he said I want you to
[1:10:27] know he said when I when I first started
[1:10:29] seeking the Lord he said I went to all
[1:10:31] he said I made up in my mind I was going
[1:10:32] to go to all of these churches and I was
[1:10:34] going to find one that had the truth and
[1:10:36] he said I I went to about every one that
[1:10:38] I knew of is that right I went to all
[1:10:40] the ones in this community he said but
[1:10:42] God kept leading me right back here you
[1:10:44] see it was a word joining up with a word
[1:10:47] there's a lot of people that walked in
[1:10:49] here and they couldn't connect with it
[1:10:51] but because there's prophecy hallah
[1:10:54] because there's prophecy that's laying
[1:10:56] right here it was something that was
[1:10:58] attracting the attention of Steven bers
[1:11:01] but God was not finished with stepen he
[1:11:04] went after his wife sister
[1:11:06] Tara now there's no man that can make
[1:11:09] how that works up but the
[1:11:12] vision how many times did you pray for
[1:11:15] how many prayer lines did you come
[1:11:17] through but God had a time for the
[1:11:19] season when the vision was going to be
[1:11:21] made manifest and when God reveals it
[1:11:24] there ain't one devil in hell that can
[1:11:26] rock you off of that
[1:11:29] Revelation it's because the vision don't
[1:11:33] get shook up about it the vision's for
[1:11:35] an appointed
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:42] time the Bible said in Samuel 1st Samuel
[1:11:47] 3 that that the word of the Lord was
[1:11:50] precious in those days because there was
[1:11:53] no open Vision we know that by the Bible
[1:11:56] Solomon told us that where there is no
[1:11:58] vision that the people
[1:12:01] perish you see that's what a vision is
[1:12:04] it's the direct word of the lord it's
[1:12:08] the direct word of the Lord and think I
[1:12:09] don't I don't want to spend much time
[1:12:11] right here but to think that the word of
[1:12:13] God was being left alone in the days of
[1:12:15] Samuel because men were going out and
[1:12:18] making mockery of The Voice or making
[1:12:20] mockery of the House of almighty God but
[1:12:23] God had promised that he was going to
[1:12:25] meet the need of that hour so God gave
[1:12:27] Samuel a vision and to think that today
[1:12:30] that God is not going to let his word
[1:12:33] just lay there uneffective he's not
[1:12:35] going to just he's not just going to let
[1:12:36] it lay there but God has promised that
[1:12:39] he was going to meet the need of the
[1:12:40] hour and he always does that and it's
[1:12:43] always the voice of God that meets the
[1:12:46] need of the hour and I'll say it's like
[1:12:48] this we don't need some emotional workup
[1:12:51] to meet the need of the hour today we
[1:12:53] don't need some we don't need some music
[1:12:55] or we don't need something to work us up
[1:12:57] we don't need some man to to come and
[1:12:59] try to pump us up it's the word of God
[1:13:03] that is Raising this generation it's
[1:13:05] seed life that's coming to
[1:13:08] life what is it it's the seed being
[1:13:12] deposited
[1:13:15] again when you think about it begin to
[1:13:18] talk about these things with my girls
[1:13:19] this week we begin to think about we
[1:13:22] were talking about the
[1:13:24] about the martyrs that had in the Dark
[1:13:26] Ages how that they gave their life and
[1:13:28] they they would sit there in those
[1:13:30] coliseums and things and and and the and
[1:13:33] the enemy would feed these feed these
[1:13:36] Christians to lions and they would they
[1:13:38] would they would take their clothes off
[1:13:40] of them and they would and you look at
[1:13:43] it and you look out through look out
[1:13:44] through the fox's book of Martyrs and
[1:13:46] you see all those things laying there
[1:13:48] that that short hair actually started in
[1:13:51] Rome and there when when when Christian
[1:13:55] sisters would walk down the street with
[1:13:57] their long flowing hair that is
[1:13:59] perfectly in line with First Corinthians
[1:14:01] 11 that there they those they they
[1:14:05] identified themselves as being
[1:14:07] Christians and when those when those men
[1:14:09] and those women would see those sisters
[1:14:12] with that long hair though those Romans
[1:14:15] would take them and they would dip them
[1:14:17] Sisters hair in tar and they would light
[1:14:20] it on fire so that it would burn from
[1:14:22] the burn all the way up from their roots
[1:14:25] to their scalp they would feed them to
[1:14:27] Lions they would they would try to scare
[1:14:29] them to death and if you go to reading
[1:14:31] the fox's booking mors Martyrs there
[1:14:34] you'll see that it said that those
[1:14:36] Christians when they were fed to the
[1:14:38] lions that they died with a smile on
[1:14:41] their
[1:14:43] face you that really must upset the
[1:14:46] enemy we're trying to put fear tactics
[1:14:49] upon them to make them cause them not to
[1:14:52] be a Christian
[1:14:53] but the more they did the more they were
[1:14:56] happy to give themselves over because
[1:14:59] you see what it was you would think in
[1:15:01] your own mind there's no way that I
[1:15:02] there's no way I could do that but you
[1:15:04] see they were under the anointing of the
[1:15:07] ox anointing they were sitting there
[1:15:09] under that anointing so they were able
[1:15:11] to give their lives over to
[1:15:13] that it's because of the anointing that
[1:15:16] they were under and it's a lot of people
[1:15:18] that can't understand why you preach or
[1:15:20] why you live the way that you live it's
[1:15:23] because you are under a different
[1:15:25] anointing of the hour you are under the
[1:15:28] anointing of a vision the anointing of
[1:15:30] an egole you see you can't preach you
[1:15:33] can't live what Wesley lived you can't
[1:15:36] live out what Luther lived they can't
[1:15:38] run like you ran because they can't fly
[1:15:42] like you're
[1:15:43] flying you see you've got a message to
[1:15:46] run with because you think about this
[1:15:49] that God had in this hour an anointing
[1:15:51] that was going to be released over over
[1:15:53] this generation and prophetic Insight
[1:15:56] one that had the ability to see past the
[1:15:59] dark dismal days of denominational
[1:16:01] Brokenness that had broke up the body of
[1:16:04] Jesus Christ in such a way so God had to
[1:16:07] have a prophetic Ministry that would
[1:16:09] come in this generation and take a
[1:16:11] broken body and bind it back up together
[1:16:14] that's what William Brandon would say
[1:16:16] over and over again the sickest body
[1:16:18] that I know of is the body of Jesus
[1:16:21] Christ denominations had broke her
[1:16:25] down but this prophetic Ministry took
[1:16:28] the Seven Seals and wound back up those
[1:16:31] things that were broken and tied them
[1:16:33] back together that's why Satan hates a
[1:16:37] people of vision is because
[1:16:40] hallelujah it's because this word has
[1:16:43] tied back together the body of Jesus
[1:16:45] Christ and brought healing to the body
[1:16:48] that's why you can stand there and say
[1:16:50] John 14:12 Mark 16 John 15 and 7 and all
[1:16:54] of these things line back up together
[1:16:57] it's because the word has become the
[1:17:00] word what was it when Paul was standing
[1:17:03] there as a murderer but in the next spot
[1:17:05] in Acts chapter n he's standing there
[1:17:08] and the word saw the
[1:17:14] word you'd have been in the same shape
[1:17:17] you'd have crucify Jesus if you could
[1:17:19] have but there's no way you could have
[1:17:22] gave up on Jesus there's no way you
[1:17:24] could turn your back on
[1:17:27] Jesus because the word saw the word on
[1:17:31] the inside of
[1:17:34] you what is it what is it you're
[1:17:37] anointed for the hour that you're living
[1:17:39] and you're anointed for the moment
[1:17:41] brother random would talk about just to
[1:17:43] capture capture some things here as we
[1:17:46] move forward is that brother Brandon
[1:17:49] would tell us about
[1:17:50] visions and and we know that in the
[1:17:54] message there's over 8,300 visions that
[1:17:57] are caught on tape and brother random
[1:18:00] would tell us about a vision how that it
[1:18:01] how that it would completely weaken his
[1:18:04] body and he said it's kind of like it's
[1:18:07] kind of like a man from a circus like
[1:18:09] looking in a circus he said he said if
[1:18:11] I'm standing up on my toes he said and
[1:18:13] looking through a peephole and I could
[1:18:15] tell you that on the inside of there he
[1:18:17] said he said if I'm doing that on my own
[1:18:20] and I'm standing up there and I'm
[1:18:21] looking through this peephole I could
[1:18:22] tell you there's a man in there and he's
[1:18:24] got a giraffe he's leading around a
[1:18:25] tiger or a lion and different things
[1:18:27] he's working through this circus he said
[1:18:29] but if the man of the Arena came and
[1:18:32] lifted me up so that I could see those
[1:18:34] things he said it wouldn't weaken me
[1:18:36] like that he said that's the way he said
[1:18:39] that's the way he said when you get to
[1:18:40] pulling on me he said it pulls he said
[1:18:43] it pulls the very it pulls the very
[1:18:45] strength of the very virtue out of me I
[1:18:48] think it's amazing thing to watch the
[1:18:51] interpretation of the vision begin to
[1:18:53] come to pass you can see you can there's
[1:18:55] there's thousands of visions that we
[1:18:57] could go over today about where William
[1:19:00] brandham was and but to think about that
[1:19:03] there were visions that was laying there
[1:19:05] about a body that would come a body that
[1:19:07] would be without spot a body that would
[1:19:09] be without blemish a body that would be
[1:19:11] bone of his bone life of his life word
[1:19:14] of his word power of his power and to
[1:19:16] watch that come in
[1:19:19] manifestation because Jesus would say in
[1:19:22] John 5 and 24 that verily verily I say
[1:19:24] unto you that he that Hearth my word and
[1:19:27] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:19:29] everlasting life and brother manam said
[1:19:31] he said that word heareth he said it
[1:19:33] doesn't mean hear with your ear he said
[1:19:35] it means to understand with your heart
[1:19:37] it means to be revealed
[1:19:39] to and he that heareth or understandeth
[1:19:43] or it's been revealed to and believeth
[1:19:45] on me hath everlasting life so it shows
[1:19:48] right there that he was depositing
[1:19:50] Mysteries to a certain people it's
[1:19:53] Christ in you the hope of
[1:19:55] glory is that right that's the mystery
[1:19:58] now notice what brother random said he
[1:20:00] said how that those great mysteries of
[1:20:02] those fulfilling of God taking and
[1:20:04] bringing it to himself he said
[1:20:06] manifested in the age of human beings
[1:20:08] and in the Stream of human beings and in
[1:20:10] the company of human beings to make his
[1:20:12] word made manifested in the day notice
[1:20:16] he did not he did not deposit this to
[1:20:18] Angels he did not deposit this to
[1:20:20] principalities he did not deposit this
[1:20:23] to Demons they knew who he was the
[1:20:26] Angels know who he is but he deposited
[1:20:29] these Mysteries to human beings that
[1:20:32] needed Redemption notice what he said he
[1:20:35] said it started in the Easter rising of
[1:20:37] the sun he said but to do the same thing
[1:20:40] as the sun sets in the west what is it
[1:20:43] it is the attraction on the mountain
[1:20:46] it's God fulfilling prophecy up
[1:20:50] there what happened on Mount sh it was
[1:20:53] God fulfilling prophecy what happened up
[1:20:55] there what happened up there when Jesus
[1:20:58] come riding up there on the F the coat
[1:20:59] of an ass what was it he was fulfilling
[1:21:01] prophecy that's what William brandham
[1:21:03] said in the attraction on the mountain
[1:21:05] he said what happened on Mount Sunset it
[1:21:08] was God fulfilling prophecy right there
[1:21:11] again that is what the attraction
[1:21:14] is it's Isaiah
[1:21:19] 53
[1:21:21] Hallelujah hallelujah what is it it was
[1:21:25] things that was laying
[1:21:28] there he said but now he said we can say
[1:21:31] it's history he said because these
[1:21:34] events have been made clear unto us what
[1:21:37] was it it was once prophecy but now it's
[1:21:40] history and one of these days God has
[1:21:42] spoke that there's going to be a people
[1:21:44] that go by the way that go by the way of
[1:21:46] the air you're not going by the way of
[1:21:48] the
[1:21:50] Grave you give me you give me me he give
[1:21:53] me some Liberty and next weekend I'm
[1:21:54] going to preach to you on a thought on
[1:21:56] the much awaited departure but there is
[1:22:00] a people that have been longing for this
[1:22:03] moment they've been longing and there's
[1:22:05] such Agony on the inside of this body
[1:22:07] they're waiting for it but he didn't
[1:22:09] manifest it to angels He didn't manifest
[1:22:12] it to Trump he didn't manifest it to
[1:22:14] Putin but he manifested to a little
[1:22:16] bitty old insignificant woman that was
[1:22:19] throwing out the wash one day but she
[1:22:21] saw the ranch standing there Hallelujah
[1:22:25] and he saw something on the inside of
[1:22:27] that little body that exhibited a part
[1:22:30] of
[1:22:33] himself Hallelujah you might think
[1:22:36] yourself so insignificant but do you
[1:22:38] realize you're fulfilling
[1:22:43] prophecy William Brandon said that when
[1:22:45] that little girl took that wash water
[1:22:47] out there he says she was
[1:22:51] barefooted well says a sign of humility
[1:22:54] it was a sign of humility she didn't
[1:22:56] think herself
[1:22:58] worthy and you find people that think
[1:23:00] theirself
[1:23:01] something you can find them walking out
[1:23:04] the door you can find people that think
[1:23:06] they need to be called on to preach or
[1:23:07] called on to sing or called on to do
[1:23:09] this that or the other and if they don't
[1:23:11] get called on they don't get to they
[1:23:12] don't get elected to go to this camp or
[1:23:14] that camp or that meeting or that
[1:23:15] meeting they get they get that they
[1:23:17] thought thems a little bit higher than
[1:23:19] somebody else but that's not to weit
[1:23:22] almighty God the way to get to God is to
[1:23:25] humble yourself and this little lady is
[1:23:28] a humble lady and when she was doing
[1:23:31] what nobody else wanted to do Hallelujah
[1:23:35] there he found
[1:23:37] her he found her what did the woman say
[1:23:41] in songs The Song of Solomon I have
[1:23:44] longed for him I have long for him on my
[1:23:47] bed but if you're going to find him you
[1:23:49] got to get up off of your bed and you
[1:23:52] got to go searching for him throughout
[1:23:53] the city and he said ask and you shall
[1:23:56] receive knock and it shall be
[1:23:59] open it's time Hallelujah that this
[1:24:02] little body recognizes your humility has
[1:24:05] brought you to
[1:24:10] Divinity
[1:24:13] hallelujah
[1:24:15] hallelujah this okay this morning I'm
[1:24:18] enjoying it what is it it's prophecy
[1:24:21] that's being fulfilled
[1:24:23] you think about when William Bram would
[1:24:26] stand there he'd be dealing with a
[1:24:29] patient and you're looking for the
[1:24:31] outcome of the vision and he would often
[1:24:35] times he would sit there and he would
[1:24:36] pray for patience and he would tell them
[1:24:38] now in just three days you're going to
[1:24:41] get sick like never before he said
[1:24:43] because corruption is leaving your body
[1:24:45] he said just a little bit of time he
[1:24:47] said you're going to get sicker than
[1:24:48] ever before he said what is it he said
[1:24:51] it's the result of that cancer dying on
[1:24:54] the inside of you what is it you see now
[1:24:57] notice that sin that sickness is a
[1:25:01] result of sin so we understand that that
[1:25:05] that sickness is because there was sin
[1:25:08] that that happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:25:11] but William brandham said this he said
[1:25:13] if sickness is a result of sin he said
[1:25:16] then healing is a result of your
[1:25:19] salvation at Calvary so that you can
[1:25:21] look upon this that one sacrifice at the
[1:25:25] cross of Calvary your
[1:25:28] results I don't need your doctor's
[1:25:30] Resorts I don't need what the doctor
[1:25:33] says or I don't need what the scan says
[1:25:34] about you all I need to know is what the
[1:25:37] results of Calvary has said about
[1:25:41] you I was listening I was listening to
[1:25:44] to a tape this morning on the way to
[1:25:45] church and listen to it with purpose on
[1:25:48] this day the scripture is fulfilled and
[1:25:50] and and and brother Bram brother Bram
[1:25:52] calls out two people that were
[1:25:53] personally identified with and that's
[1:25:56] that's brother Charlie Mitchell that was
[1:25:57] there at brother fur's fur's
[1:25:59] congregation there in Christiansburg and
[1:26:02] and he would become Bosom Buddies with
[1:26:03] him and there Charlie Mitchell had had
[1:26:06] this tumor where he' worked down there
[1:26:08] in them coal mines all them years and he
[1:26:10] had this tumor on his left on his left
[1:26:12] in his left lung there and and and there
[1:26:15] brother random brother Brandon was at
[1:26:17] this at this convention at uh Park Park
[1:26:20] Middle School there and brother brandham
[1:26:22] is preaching and and many many of us
[1:26:24] have never been to the building I've
[1:26:25] been there before but many of us don't
[1:26:27] understand that brother brandham is
[1:26:28] actually preaching he's actually
[1:26:30] preaching there's one side of the
[1:26:32] audience on this side and there's a wall
[1:26:34] down the middle and there's there's
[1:26:36] people that are sitting on this side and
[1:26:37] brother bram's actually preaching in
[1:26:39] this direction so he's standing there
[1:26:41] and he doesn't see he doesn't see either
[1:26:44] side of them but he's preaching to them
[1:26:46] and there brother fer is on this side of
[1:26:49] the of this wall and Charlie Mitchell's
[1:26:51] on that side brother fure said that
[1:26:54] Charlie Mitchell was so sick the night
[1:26:55] before that he couldn't even make it
[1:26:56] into the building but then when William
[1:26:58] Brandon was preaching this day the
[1:26:59] scripture is fulfilled Charlie Mitchell
[1:27:02] is sitting on that side of the building
[1:27:04] and the rest of the other the of the
[1:27:05] brothers that came with Brother fure on
[1:27:07] that side of the building he said but
[1:27:09] when they heard William bham say I see
[1:27:12] you got that tumor on the inside of your
[1:27:14] left lung he said tears begin to roll
[1:27:17] down her eyes but notice notice he
[1:27:20] didn't just he didn't just say to him
[1:27:22] where it was he told him you're
[1:27:24] absolutely healed from it what was it
[1:27:28] you can either take the word of a
[1:27:29] prophet or you can deny the word of a
[1:27:32] prophet but Charlie Mitchell
[1:27:34] accepted William brandham didn't know
[1:27:37] Charlie Mitchell but the angel knew
[1:27:43] him Charlie Mitchell had a tumor in his
[1:27:46] lung but when that moment transpired the
[1:27:50] vision showed the result that the turmer
[1:27:53] was gone and he went back to the doctor
[1:27:56] and he took x-rays and the nurse brought
[1:27:59] the x-rays to the doctor and the doctor
[1:28:01] said you brought me the wrong x-rays
[1:28:02] Charlie Mitchell said no sir I've been
[1:28:05] to a healing meeting the results lined
[1:28:08] up with a
[1:28:12] vision hallelujah hallelujah if I can
[1:28:15] only capture your attention today
[1:28:18] whether you're on this side or on that
[1:28:20] side your results of the body change is
[1:28:23] in the
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:28] vision I don't have to see you and you
[1:28:30] don't have to see me but the results of
[1:28:32] Calvary has said that you're worthy to
[1:28:34] go in this body change you're worthy for
[1:28:37] the
[1:28:38] Rapture who cares what the devil says
[1:28:41] who cares what the mockers say Noah keep
[1:28:43] building that boat Moses keep preaching
[1:28:46] that message David keep dancing your way
[1:28:49] come on Daniel keep writing the
[1:28:51] scripture
[1:28:52] who care what they say the the proof is
[1:28:56] in the pudding the Vindication cannot be
[1:29:00] [Applause]
[1:29:04] mocked I feel so good I can speak in
[1:29:07] Tong wo Hallelujah you can't argue with
[1:29:11] this Vindicated
[1:29:13] word we had a man stand up in this
[1:29:15] building one time you excuse me but I'm
[1:29:18] preaching today when a man stand up in
[1:29:20] this building one time and tried to mock
[1:29:22] the Vindication but Jason Jackson was
[1:29:25] standing behind this pulpit and preached
[1:29:27] on the Vindication of the word of the
[1:29:30] hour that man stood up and mocked this
[1:29:33] message I'm sorry but the pillar fire
[1:29:37] stood up behind Jason Jackson and
[1:29:40] Vindicated what the man of God had
[1:29:45] spoke this ain't just William Brandon's
[1:29:48] Pillar of Fire this is your Pillar of
[1:29:49] Fire come on somebody this ain't just
[1:29:52] William bram's message this is your
[1:29:54] message and I have been Vindicated by
[1:29:56] the same Pillar of Fire living on the
[1:29:58] inside of my soul you may not see it on
[1:30:01] the over head you may not see it over
[1:30:03] your life but let your life
[1:30:07] prove Moses had been raised in a goodly
[1:30:10] home and a Godly home he'd been raised
[1:30:12] there under under his mom Jose
[1:30:17] bed prophecy had been told to him
[1:30:20] there's coming to deliver she believed
[1:30:22] it was
[1:30:23] him why did she believe that it's
[1:30:26] because her husband had spent some time
[1:30:28] in
[1:30:30] prayer he spent some time in prayer he'd
[1:30:33] been out there making brick and been
[1:30:34] making mortar but he come in at the
[1:30:36] night
[1:30:37] time brother brandham said that Joseph
[1:30:40] bed was real worried about him she was
[1:30:42] worried about amram because he he'd work
[1:30:44] all day and he'd pray all night he'd
[1:30:46] work all day and he'd pray all night
[1:30:48] brother bam said you could actually see
[1:30:49] it up his face that he was beginning to
[1:30:51] get pale because he wasn't eating enough
[1:30:53] and wasn't drinking enough and Joseph
[1:30:55] had a right he said but honey I'm
[1:30:57] praying about this because God said that
[1:31:00] there was a deliverer that was coming
[1:31:02] and how did josed talk to Moses and tell
[1:31:05] him said son I believe your him I
[1:31:07] believe your him now maybe you don't
[1:31:09] understand what I'm talking about right
[1:31:11] now because I'm talking about Moses but
[1:31:14] I'm trying to get the same thing to you
[1:31:16] you're the bride you're the bride and
[1:31:18] you may not say it that but you're the
[1:31:20] bride you're the bride God's body you
[1:31:22] are part of him you're the Royal bride
[1:31:25] of Jesus
[1:31:26] Christ maybe you don't see it right now
[1:31:29] but if you'll just take my word there's
[1:31:31] something that's been deposited on the
[1:31:33] inside of you little bride and the
[1:31:35] father has seen it that's why he's
[1:31:37] calling to you that's why there's a deep
[1:31:39] call it to the
[1:31:42] Deep come on Moses it's in you come on
[1:31:47] Moses he tried by his own intellectual
[1:31:49] conception and you tried going to an
[1:31:51] altar and you tried boohoo and but it
[1:31:53] didn't come but when Moses was standing
[1:31:57] before the pillar of
[1:31:59] fire he
[1:32:01] realized I'm the Vindication of
[1:32:03] Abraham's prophecy I'm the
[1:32:06] interpretation of a deliverer that's
[1:32:08] coming to deliver this
[1:32:17] children when you begin to read
[1:32:19] Zechariah Chapter 4 and he starts seeing
[1:32:22] those
[1:32:24] things how that the voice wakes up the
[1:32:29] Virgin and you can look at Matthew 25
[1:32:32] and you can see that there's an
[1:32:33] Awakening that is happening to a lady as
[1:32:37] she fell asleep but the major difference
[1:32:40] between her and the others is that she's
[1:32:43] got oil the others are searching for it
[1:32:46] but even though she may have slumbered
[1:32:48] and slept for a little bit there was
[1:32:50] something that was laying there and that
[1:32:52] was these seven Thunders that woke up
[1:32:54] this sleeping body and now you don't
[1:32:57] have to worry you got a generation
[1:32:59] that's crying to say they're they're
[1:33:00] getting woke up to the fact that slavery
[1:33:02] slavery getting woke up to the fact that
[1:33:04] the LGBT qz is a part of is a part of
[1:33:07] God's plan they're getting trying to get
[1:33:08] woke up to those Saints but this body
[1:33:11] has been woke up by the Seven Seals that
[1:33:14] had thundered out and voice to her that
[1:33:17] you're another people you're a
[1:33:19] generation that's not going to taste
[1:33:21] death
[1:33:21] [Applause]
[1:33:26] hallelujah
[1:33:28] hallelujah what was it Isaiah was just a
[1:33:32] man like you
[1:33:34] were but the spirit of God could deal
[1:33:36] with him in such a way and inspiration
[1:33:37] would strike him and he would say that
[1:33:39] he that you're going to receive a sign
[1:33:42] that a virgin's going to conceive what
[1:33:44] is it it's a super sign it's a super
[1:33:47] sign it's the same way that prophecy has
[1:33:49] struck William brandham that I'm not not
[1:33:51] going to no longer call you church but
[1:33:53] I'm going to call you bride it's the
[1:33:55] same inspiration it's the same anointing
[1:33:57] it's the same Spirit of Christ that was
[1:33:59] working on Isaiah that was working in
[1:34:02] this
[1:34:02] generation inspiration would strike
[1:34:04] Isaiah and he would
[1:34:06] say Behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:34:09] behold you can call his name you shall
[1:34:11] call his name Emmanuel he'll be the
[1:34:14] Prince of Peace he'll be the Mighty God
[1:34:16] what was it it was the inspiration that
[1:34:18] was striking him at 800 years
[1:34:22] later the results were made
[1:34:26] manifest in a
[1:34:28] virsion well was it it was a seed
[1:34:31] forming had laying there all those times
[1:34:33] had been waiting for this moment when
[1:34:35] waiting what is it it's a seed that's
[1:34:37] building a body it's building a body
[1:34:39] it's just like in Luke 17:30 that in the
[1:34:42] last days a son of man he shall arise
[1:34:44] and when the son of man is being
[1:34:46] revealed these things are going to take
[1:34:47] place and you certainly see Luke 17:29
[1:34:50] and 17 30 when you look out there and
[1:34:52] you see Sodom out there and they receive
[1:34:55] their Messengers they received their
[1:34:57] Messengers Billy Graham and or Roberts
[1:34:58] are down there preaching to them but
[1:35:00] there's been one that stayed up here
[1:35:01] with this elect lady there's been one
[1:35:03] that stayed up here and told her that
[1:35:05] you're not going to have to go down
[1:35:06] there you're not going to have to worry
[1:35:07] about that you're not a part of that
[1:35:09] group you ain't got to worry about if
[1:35:10] there's 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50
[1:35:13] you're my people I'm staying up here
[1:35:15] with you and mecdc has been sitting up
[1:35:17] here eating honey and milk and he's
[1:35:19] eating and feasting upon the seven seal
[1:35:21] and it's feasting on the seven trumpets
[1:35:23] and it's telling you that this is your
[1:35:27] border this is your inheritance this is
[1:35:29] your promise come on somebody you say
[1:35:32] why you keep preaching about them
[1:35:33] prodical coming back because they
[1:35:36] are why you keep preaching that cancer
[1:35:39] is defeated because it is this is my
[1:35:42] border this is my inheritance this is my
[1:35:46] Throne this is my
[1:35:50] domain
[1:35:57] hallelujah
[1:35:58] hallelujah
[1:36:01] hallelujah what was it William Brown
[1:36:04] said that that word had been circling
[1:36:06] for 800 years it had been circling the
[1:36:09] earth for 800 years he said but when it
[1:36:12] found Mary he said that prophecy hooked
[1:36:15] in the womb of Mary it hooked in her
[1:36:19] womb now notice Not only was she virgin
[1:36:22] in her body but she was virgin in her
[1:36:25] faith she had not been manhandled in her
[1:36:27] faith she had a childlike faith that she
[1:36:30] could believe this was so
[1:36:37] Supernatural the supernatural was just
[1:36:39] natural to God It's Supernatural to
[1:36:42] us this girl this girl ain't heard
[1:36:46] anything about this this girl ain't seen
[1:36:47] anything like this ain't nobody else
[1:36:49] talking about this but this girl
[1:36:52] had such a virgin Faith about her that
[1:36:54] she could look upon the same angel that
[1:36:56] Zachariah had looked at and he turned
[1:36:59] down because he slightly doubted the
[1:37:02] word but her virgin Faith said be it
[1:37:05] unto me according to Thy
[1:37:08] word that's the same way with this
[1:37:10] little body right here you may not be
[1:37:13] big in number you may may not be like
[1:37:14] the rest of the dominations of thousands
[1:37:16] of people but you are so much more
[1:37:19] powerful because you have aligned
[1:37:20] yourself with prophecy prophecy that is
[1:37:23] not laying there and has left there
[1:37:25] unfulfilled but it's prophecy that
[1:37:27] you're riding
[1:37:29] on you're riding on it I sent it to my
[1:37:33] family this week my brother man is
[1:37:34] preaching there and trying to do God a
[1:37:36] service and being outside of his wheel
[1:37:40] and brother BR was talking about Elijah
[1:37:41] and he's going up on them terets of fire
[1:37:43] and he said one of these days he said
[1:37:46] you're going to go up there and unhook
[1:37:49] the horses from the bushes that are
[1:37:50] waiting on you
[1:37:52] you this prophecy that was waiting on
[1:37:56] Mary had been circling and looking for
[1:37:58] her now you think about this you think
[1:38:01] about it in this light that their
[1:38:03] prophecy was hunting for her but she was
[1:38:06] hunting for it as well there's something
[1:38:08] on the inside of you that keeps calling
[1:38:10] you to come up a little bit higher what
[1:38:13] is it it's the holy spirit that is
[1:38:15] building a body and you watch as Mary
[1:38:19] received that word what did it do it was
[1:38:21] not part God and part Mary he was all
[1:38:23] God and it built a body a body that did
[1:38:26] not know sin a body that didn't
[1:38:28] understand a body that did not have to
[1:38:30] know it but it was building a body a
[1:38:33] body that could understand and be
[1:38:35] Redemption that's the same thing that is
[1:38:37] happening right now the elect of every
[1:38:40] generation you can look you can look in
[1:38:43] there and you can see the elect under
[1:38:45] Paul that there polycarp polycarp ran
[1:38:48] and he caught the message under Paul and
[1:38:50] he preached a message you can look under
[1:38:52] Wesley and you can see men like Spurgeon
[1:38:54] and Finny and Wigglesworth and they
[1:38:56] catch it and they run with it it's
[1:38:58] because it was their message to run with
[1:39:00] it so if William brandham ran his race
[1:39:03] then there's got to be a body that
[1:39:05] attaches herself to a vision actually
[1:39:07] runs this
[1:39:09] race because William brand said he said
[1:39:12] if I taught you a Methodist message he
[1:39:13] said it wouldn't take no effect upon
[1:39:16] you he because this is bride time
[1:39:20] because the predes at seed are laying
[1:39:22] there that will only be watered by the
[1:39:23] type of water that's GI for that
[1:39:27] seed notice what he says and what
[1:39:30] Visions are he said a vision is God by a
[1:39:34] word of knowledge dropping to the person
[1:39:36] to foresee or foresee or something tell
[1:39:40] something that has been or something
[1:39:42] that will be again he would say again he
[1:39:46] would say this that a vision never heals
[1:39:50] anyone
[1:39:52] a vision only brings the reality of a
[1:39:54] supernatural being present and then in
[1:39:56] doing this it brings Faith to the
[1:40:01] people if you've ever if you ever in
[1:40:04] quaint uh uh uh ever been a part of that
[1:40:07] many of you understand Deja Vu that you
[1:40:11] you feel like you're in this moment
[1:40:12] right now and you've seen it before but
[1:40:14] a vision is something that you have
[1:40:16] clearly seen before it ever happens and
[1:40:19] you can go around and tell people that
[1:40:20] this is is going to happen this is this
[1:40:22] is how it's going to happen that's why
[1:40:23] William brandom could say there he said
[1:40:25] now I can't move the Hat because the
[1:40:29] vision said that the Hat's got to be in
[1:40:30] this certain spot he said I could go do
[1:40:32] that he said but it would interrupt the
[1:40:34] vision so things have got to be in their
[1:40:36] particular spot and you you you try to
[1:40:39] do that sometimes you try to move people
[1:40:41] in their position you try to put them
[1:40:43] there and you try your very best come on
[1:40:45] now we got a Rapture to take come on now
[1:40:49] but if you did it on your own then Satan
[1:40:52] can talk them out of it but if the
[1:40:54] vision happens according to the will of
[1:40:57] God then there's not one devil in hell
[1:41:00] that can rob the Revelation out of that
[1:41:02] person so you ain't got to work them up
[1:41:04] to it you ain't got to make it happen
[1:41:06] Isaiah 53 says he was wounded for my
[1:41:09] transgressions he was bruised for my
[1:41:11] iniquities the chastisement of my peace
[1:41:13] was upon him and with his stripes I am
[1:41:16] healed it's not my job to make it come
[1:41:19] to pass it's myob job to believe
[1:41:22] it it's not my job to make the vision
[1:41:26] it's my job to step into
[1:41:33] it but it's like it's you're seeing
[1:41:37] something in the future something that's
[1:41:38] going to happen you already you you know
[1:41:43] it you ever you ever had that Deja Vu
[1:41:46] it's a funny feeling when you're sitting
[1:41:47] there like man I've been here
[1:41:49] before
[1:41:51] but to see a
[1:41:52] vision and you can whisper it to
[1:41:54] somebody and tell them that this is
[1:41:56] going to happen exactly like this this
[1:41:57] person's going to walk to the Altar and
[1:41:59] that person's going to come up and
[1:42:00] they're going to ask for prayer like
[1:42:01] this and there are certain things there
[1:42:04] are certain things that the Lord will
[1:42:05] drive to you and you think what does
[1:42:07] that matter like but it's to show that
[1:42:10] God's God one of one one instance
[1:42:13] there's there's several but I'll just
[1:42:14] tell like this there's one instance that
[1:42:15] one time we was walking in at a gas
[1:42:18] station and there and there was we
[1:42:21] walked in we walked in and there was
[1:42:23] this blond-headed girl that was hanging
[1:42:25] out there dad walks in beside me and
[1:42:27] said now look he said this is going to
[1:42:29] happen when these he said when that
[1:42:31] woman walks out there's going to be two
[1:42:33] homosexuals that attach thems to that
[1:42:35] woman they get in the same car and we
[1:42:38] watched that thing we stepped outside we
[1:42:40] watched that thing it happened exactly
[1:42:41] like that and I always thought about
[1:42:43] that why in the world did that
[1:42:46] matter it was to show that God is still
[1:42:48] God it was like the time that dad was at
[1:42:51] Disney World and and there Whitney and
[1:42:53] Davey had had the Lord had showed him
[1:42:56] that he was going to that they were
[1:42:57] going to buy him this certain gift and
[1:42:59] they come out without that gift he
[1:43:02] thought well maybe I was
[1:43:04] wrong but Ms went by but months went by
[1:43:09] and they were sitting down at the table
[1:43:11] and I was sitting there and dad had
[1:43:12] already told me that this is what the
[1:43:15] Lord had showed me I think it's pretty
[1:43:17] amazing that God knows where you're at
[1:43:18] no matter where you are if you're in
[1:43:19] Disney World or where whatever it is is
[1:43:21] but there there he he told me he said
[1:43:23] now he said there going to be this
[1:43:24] certain piece it's it's got bail and the
[1:43:26] Beast in
[1:43:29] it you don't believe in Disney World let
[1:43:32] me show you a vision that happened in
[1:43:33] Disney World so we're sitting at the
[1:43:35] table and this is months later months
[1:43:37] later there sitting down and David
[1:43:40] Whitney said we got a gift for you Dad
[1:43:42] said I can tell you exactly what it is
[1:43:45] laid out told everything about it how it
[1:43:47] was and everything how'd you know he
[1:43:48] said the Lord showed me that
[1:43:52] and you think well what does that got to
[1:43:54] do it's to show that God is God over
[1:43:57] every little circumstance of your life
[1:44:00] if he cares about a little bitty fishy
[1:44:02] he surely cares about your job situation
[1:44:04] if he cares about a little trinket he
[1:44:06] surely cares about the sickness that
[1:44:08] he's already paid for you all he's
[1:44:10] wanting you to do is capture that the
[1:44:12] vision has already been made manifest
[1:44:14] and all you got to do is step into the
[1:44:18] vision come on now when those priests
[1:44:21] when they've been told to March down
[1:44:23] there and judge Joshua chapter 3 and
[1:44:26] step into the river and it was going to
[1:44:28] open up unto them it's not going to open
[1:44:30] until you step into it now God is not
[1:44:33] that kind of a god that is going to push
[1:44:35] you through a pre and say blessed is he
[1:44:37] that overcome but he's wanting you to do
[1:44:39] something so you got to take a leap of
[1:44:47] faith he's wanting you to take a leap of
[1:44:49] faith
[1:44:51] well I'm too sick to come to
[1:44:53] church and there's too many people down

[1:48:17] you the
[1:48:18] Rapture is the word of the lord it's a
[1:48:21] vision it's going to transpire exactly
[1:48:23] how God has saw it it's
[1:48:25] exactly it's exactly like it's easy for
[1:48:28] you to look back and see William Brandon
[1:48:31] sitting there and he starts talking
[1:48:35] about he starts talking about a sister
[1:48:39] or he's he's there in the prayer line
[1:48:40] and he starts talking and he said now I
[1:48:43] see I see a doctor that's working on a
[1:48:45] on a cuddler girl back there and she's
[1:48:48] she's having surgery on her tonsil and
[1:48:50] when the doctor's having the surgery on
[1:48:52] her the the doctor actually paralyzes
[1:48:55] her and while William brandom was saying
[1:48:57] this this sister this sister comes
[1:49:00] screaming out of the congregation said
[1:49:02] that's my baby that's my baby and she
[1:49:05] healed William brand he said all I can
[1:49:07] tell you is what I saw brother random
[1:49:09] said I went back to saying as I was
[1:49:11] saying faith is the substance of things
[1:49:13] hoped for and he said as I was saying
[1:49:16] that as I was saying that he said
[1:49:19] they're materializing in the building he
[1:49:21] said was cars running through the
[1:49:22] building and I rode before me and he
[1:49:25] said I looked out there and I saw a
[1:49:26] little bitty girl with a baby doll in
[1:49:28] her hand coming down there walking with
[1:49:30] her mama he said thus sayith the Lord
[1:49:33] your baby's healed and in that moment
[1:49:36] that little girl received her healing
[1:49:38] it's just like your rapture your vision
[1:49:41] you're going to Simply sit there and
[1:49:44] you're going to walk right into
[1:49:46] it how did it happen that quick
[1:49:51] that quick that's where the Rapture is
[1:49:53] in a moment and a twinkling of an eye
[1:49:56] quicker than you can blink your eye you
[1:49:59] can't imagine it you can't imagine it
[1:50:01] quick enough and it's going to happen to
[1:50:07] you it's that
[1:50:10] quick sister Bruce one
[1:50:13] time sister Bruce was one time was
[1:50:16] praying for a sister she it ain't just
[1:50:19] it ain't just for everybody it ain't
[1:50:20] just for the preacher it ain't just for
[1:50:21] the prophet but sister Bruce you can go
[1:50:23] hear this on tape the sister Bruce is
[1:50:25] sitting there she's praying she's
[1:50:27] praying for this lady's got a cancer in
[1:50:28] her throat and and brother BR brother
[1:50:31] brand sees her and she's sitting there
[1:50:32] she praying for brother Chris and got
[1:50:34] her hands upon her then all of a sudden
[1:50:37] all of a sudden brother brandom the
[1:50:39] spirit of the Lord begins to discern and
[1:50:40] tells exactly where that thing is that
[1:50:43] woman that woman had that cancer in her
[1:50:45] throat brother mam said that cancer got
[1:50:47] scared and jumped out of her throat
[1:50:52] throat you talking about powerful people
[1:50:54] that you are could you imagine if cancer
[1:50:57] got a jumping fit in this place today
[1:50:59] and started jumping its way out of this
[1:51:02] church well what about Sin what about
[1:51:05] the attributes of the fall when you go
[1:51:07] to lay in your hands on people you
[1:51:09] better expect the impossible to be
[1:51:11] fulfilled because we're not just a wimpy
[1:51:14] people we're not just a school lady
[1:51:16] we're the Queen of Heaven and we're
[1:51:18] talking to almighty God the most
[1:51:20] powerful being that there ever has been
[1:51:23] that rolled worlds off of his fingertips
[1:51:25] we are approaching the Majesty of
[1:51:33] Heaven you got a few more
[1:51:38] minutes Isaiah prophesied that a virgin
[1:51:41] was going to conceive and the Shepherds
[1:51:44] were a
[1:51:45] result of Isaiah's
[1:51:48] prophecy the angel singing at Jesus's
[1:51:51] birth was a result of Isaiah's prophecy
[1:51:54] the wise men that found that found Jesus
[1:51:58] when he was 2 years old was a result of
[1:52:01] the prophecy that was laying there when
[1:52:04] when when balum stood there and
[1:52:06] prophesied that a star was going to rise
[1:52:08] out of Jacob and a scepter would rise
[1:52:11] out of Judah to think that there they
[1:52:14] were as a result of the
[1:52:18] prophecy
[1:52:21] and you may not realize these wise men
[1:52:22] may not have realized they were simply
[1:52:24] following a star but William brandham
[1:52:27] said in the message we have seen a star
[1:52:29] and came to worship him he said that
[1:52:31] star went across every observatory in
[1:52:34] the land but nobody else seen it but
[1:52:37] those that were elected to see it that
[1:52:39] same star that seven star has been
[1:52:42] raised over this generation and they
[1:52:44] missed it but you have saw his star and
[1:52:49] you've come to worship the King of Kings
[1:52:51] and the Lord of lords to think how he
[1:52:54] felt as a son of man is holding Paul in
[1:52:56] his hand and he's holding irenius and
[1:52:58] he's holding Martin he's holding Luther
[1:53:00] and he's holding Wesley and he comes
[1:53:02] down the last star and he's got him in
[1:53:03] his
[1:53:04] hand and he comes to Le oosa and he
[1:53:08] sends him out in his power under his
[1:53:09] anointing brother Chris can you imagine
[1:53:12] how we
[1:53:15] feel maybe we'll get to it next weekend
[1:53:18] on the longer way for departure and he's
[1:53:21] got him in his
[1:53:27] hand and the Bible says in Revelations
[1:53:30] that the time is at hand and he says now
[1:53:33] it's time to
[1:53:37] go there's a lot of people talking about
[1:53:39] stars there's a lot of a lot of people
[1:53:42] breaking out their telescopes and
[1:53:43] looking at new stars looking at new
[1:53:45] galaxies but you've seen a star in this
[1:53:47] generation I ain't talking about some
[1:53:49] Hollywood wood star I ain't talking
[1:53:51] about some movie star and I ain't
[1:53:52] talking about some basketball star but
[1:53:54] I'm talking about the seven star that's
[1:53:56] got the power on the inside of him
[1:53:58] because the son of man has been standing
[1:54:00] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:54:01] candlesticks he's standing right here
[1:54:03] you're not alone the son of man is
[1:54:05] standing here that's why William Bam
[1:54:08] could stand there under you the
[1:54:09] authority of it and he could release a
[1:54:11] message because the son of
[1:54:15] man said if it wasn't for him about
[1:54:18] coming to my room and about 12 o'l in
[1:54:20] the day i' have made a horrible
[1:54:22] mistake but because of you but because
[1:54:26] of where you were and because what you
[1:54:28] were going to go through the angel would
[1:54:30] not allow a man to make a mistake so he
[1:54:33] had to release it the son of man had to
[1:54:36] release the right revelation of the
[1:54:39] moment because God had a people that
[1:54:42] needed full
[1:54:48] Deliverance
[1:54:56] you
[1:54:57] imagine William brandom seen thousands
[1:54:59] of Visions he spent his whole life in
[1:55:03] it but he would say the the
[1:55:05] greatest the greatest and the most
[1:55:08] significant we standing there and you
[1:55:10] hear it on tape is Sir is this a sign of
[1:55:12] the
[1:55:16] end and he starts taking you through the
[1:55:18] vision he start taking you through that
[1:55:21] there couldn't be no more than seven no
[1:55:23] less than five five angels that are
[1:55:25] coming he he starts telling all these
[1:55:27] things he thought it was his death and
[1:55:29] he he thought it was these certain
[1:55:30] things and he flipped over his Bible he
[1:55:32] flipped over his Bible to Romans 9 33
[1:55:35] behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a
[1:55:38] rock a stumbling Stone and these men had
[1:55:40] stumbled at this they they they'd fell
[1:55:43] at this they couldn't get past this but
[1:55:45] this was the great stone that had been
[1:55:48] rejected but notice it was in this hour
[1:55:51] that it was going to be received and
[1:55:53] William bham is sitting there and he's
[1:55:55] telling us about these things if you're
[1:55:57] a newcomer and you don't know where to
[1:55:59] start at listening the message go to
[1:56:01] 1962 and listen to the last two services
[1:56:04] in 1962 and listen to it all the way to
[1:56:07] 1965 and then start over you'll get a
[1:56:10] full Comm culmination of the Elijah
[1:56:12] Ministry from right there and William
[1:56:14] brandham takes us through 1962 and he
[1:56:17] takes us through the vision and three
[1:56:19] month later he's sitting up there at
[1:56:21] Mount Sunset and the King sword appears
[1:56:24] in his hand not a king sword but the
[1:56:27] king
[1:56:29] sword you can go to listen to Fred
[1:56:31] sofman and them brother's
[1:56:32] testimonies people get mixed up on them
[1:56:35] dates that happened up there in March
[1:56:36] the 10th and 24th and all those things
[1:56:39] but William brandham told them that them
[1:56:41] seven angels had appeared and they were
[1:56:43] waiting for him right there in that
[1:56:47] moment they're waiting on him
[1:56:50] don't you understand they were waiting
[1:56:52] for the prophet to get there don't you
[1:56:54] understand those angels are gathered in
[1:56:57] this room waiting for you to get to your
[1:57:01] spot they're
[1:57:03] here brother bandham said in a church
[1:57:05] age book the angels are in heaven
[1:57:09] breathlessly awaiting your
[1:57:12] arrival maybe I'm preaching you next
[1:57:15] week's service right now today but
[1:57:17] they're breathlessly awaiting your
[1:57:20] if angels are awaiting
[1:57:24] it can you imagine almighty
[1:57:28] God he's awaiting your
[1:57:31] arrival I've held it to this
[1:57:34] time now go
[1:57:37] back it's time you've had your first
[1:57:40] pole you've had your second
[1:57:42] pole but this is the great
[1:57:45] pole you caught some little fishies in
[1:57:47] the
[1:57:48] first
[1:57:51] caught some decent ones and the second
[1:57:52] one but it attracted too many crowds but
[1:57:56] this one's going to attract the rainbow
[1:57:57] trout kind of people genuine
[1:58:01] Believers what is it he was bringing
[1:58:03] back evidence from that world and
[1:58:06] William brandham said William brandham
[1:58:08] said that if you have the baptism of the
[1:58:11] Holy Ghost you're an candidate for the
[1:58:13] association of the Unseen World and if
[1:58:15] you do not have the Holy Ghost you are
[1:58:18] not a candidate to understand the Unseen
[1:58:21] World that's why it passes over so many
[1:58:24] observatories and they miss
[1:58:26] it but you're a candidate for it you're
[1:58:30] right here in this moment right here in
[1:58:32] this
[1:58:35] hour he's waited for
[1:58:38] you and you're
[1:58:40] here he's brought back evidence is is a
[1:58:43] good
[1:58:45] land them themselves up there they're
[1:58:48] holding your name
[1:58:50] those Mysteries they're holding who you
[1:58:52] are what is this what is this this is
[1:58:55] marriage and divorce you have divorced
[1:58:57] your old man and you'll be married to
[1:58:59] almighty God what is it it's the
[1:59:01] invisible Union with the Christ and his
[1:59:04] bride right here on Earth it's invisible
[1:59:07] because a lot of people are missing
[1:59:09] what's happening but the vision said
[1:59:11] that you're going to be a part of it
[1:59:13] when I when when when Moses had said
[1:59:16] that it was a good land that it was a
[1:59:17] land that was flowing with milk honey
[1:59:20] and you read when Isaiah when mil excuse
[1:59:22] me when mecdc came and he sat down what
[1:59:24] did he eat he ate butter milk and honey
[1:59:28] and what did they go in there Caleb and
[1:59:30] Joshua when 10 other spies denied what
[1:59:33] was happening they denied they denied
[1:59:36] that they could receive it brother
[1:59:38] Barham said that they had a pent
[1:59:39] Pentecostal cocktail up there he said
[1:59:42] they had the wine they had the fruit of
[1:59:43] the vine he said they had wine and they
[1:59:46] had they had they had they had milk and
[1:59:49] honey over there he said it was a
[1:59:50] Pentecostal cocktail he said it was
[1:59:52] every bait that a Pentecostal needed
[1:59:53] right there he said they had stimulation
[1:59:56] they had butter and they had honey and
[1:59:58] they had
[1:59:59] milk well let me tell you something they
[2:00:02] come back and a lot of them said you
[2:00:04] can't take it a lot of them said you
[2:00:05] can't have the Holy Ghost a lot of them
[2:00:07] said he ain't for you but there was
[2:00:08] somebody that was of another spirit that
[2:00:11] was one of Caleb and Joshua and said
[2:00:13] it's a good land and he stealed the
[2:00:15] people and said we're well able to
[2:00:17] overcome it and we've had a job will
