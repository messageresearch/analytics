[38:56] sing a special with us this morning
[39:16] yeah quick testimony if if i can really
[39:19] just
[39:20] calm down my nerves but
[39:23] you know i think i believe if i've got
[39:25] it right
[39:26] ron had his brain surgery about a year
[39:28] ago is march 5th of last year
[39:30] right well that was right around
[39:33] same time god really was pulling on my
[39:35] heart i was actually going to go work
[39:37] with
[39:38] brother andrew and adam that next
[39:40] morning and that night
[39:42] i was up there at the hospital and
[39:43] something pulled on my heart to go and
[39:45] go and speak with speak with ron because
[39:48] i'd just been running and running and
[39:50] i was tired of running and i didn't know
[39:53] i didn't know what the future held but i
[39:54] was like you know i've got to go
[39:55] gotta go speak with him and at that
[39:57] point i decided
[39:59] and i told i told god i told andrew even
[40:02] that next night in service
[40:03] like i'm tired of running i want to come
[40:05] back to god
[40:07] and ever since that moment even it
[40:10] answers prayer last night as i saw
[40:12] malachi walk up
[40:13] because i just wanted to see my brother
[40:15] and my two brothers and my sister get
[40:16] the same
[40:17] same touch i did and
[40:20] you know with my job i know it seems
[40:23] like we're probably always running and
[40:25] writing tickets and doing everything
[40:26] like that but the truth is is i do have
[40:28] a lot of down time which is great
[40:29] because one uh not not too long after
[40:33] i've made this transfer up here
[40:35] is there's in rock bridge brother denny
[40:37] you probably know where i'm talking
[40:38] about us there's a
[40:39] there's a mountain there in between the
[40:40] interstate and i can i can count on
[40:43] every single time if i if i need to go
[40:44] and
[40:45] get a little escape i can go up there
[40:46] and i can pray you know there was one
[40:48] night
[40:49] it was probably three o'clock in the
[40:50] morning when i was working is i got
[40:52] outside my car
[40:54] i was praying and i'd actually
[40:58] i'd got down on my knees and i was
[41:00] praying about a couple things
[41:05] and i was praying that
[41:08] i could just see the presence of god
[41:10] come down
[41:11] and you know as i stood up at the end of
[41:13] that prayer
[41:15] something told me just to look up as i
[41:18] looked up
[41:20] over to the left-hand side excuse me
[41:25] over to the left-hand side i saw the
[41:28] cloud that
[41:29] appeared to be jesus and as i looked at
[41:32] it
[41:33] you know in my mind naturally the devil
[41:35] was going to attack and he was
[41:36] he was attacking me he said that's
[41:38] nothing that's nothing it's just a cloud
[41:41] well that entire night had been a clear
[41:43] night until that moment
[41:45] as i began to raise my hands and praise
[41:48] the
[41:48] lord for showing me that sign as that
[41:50] cloud just
[41:51] swept from left to right over top of me
[41:54] and in my mind i was thinking you know
[41:55] if
[41:55] i could just even see a fallen star
[41:58] right now i could just verify even more
[42:00] that this is god right now as soon as i
[42:02] started to think that
[42:04] and i was raising my hands and praising
[42:05] god a shooting star went right through
[42:06] the middle of that cloud
[42:09] and it just vanished right there as it
[42:10] was and ever since then
[42:12] as i've just been able to see that and
[42:13] every time i see it falling stars
[42:15] you guys may see them a lot but to me i
[42:17] know that god's right there with me
[42:19] and i've and i've been i've been
[42:21] testifying to and i told andrew and i
[42:23] told ron of that same thing and
[42:25] and you know there was one there was one
[42:28] night
[42:29] saturday night andrew was preaching and
[42:32] as he was preaching as i saw a streak of
[42:35] light come as he was preaching and
[42:36] i believe it was brother ron that i
[42:38] heard a voice say somebody's about to
[42:40] get it
[42:41] there was a streak of light that went to
[42:42] the back of the church off to that the
[42:44] right hand side of the church
[42:45] as soon as i heard that voice it's the

[55:37] house of the lord
[55:39] i thought last night was and i just say
[55:41] this from my heart
[55:43] and i thought last night was one of the
[55:45] greatest services i've ever set in
[55:50] i mean that i i mean that maybe you
[55:52] would say i'm prejudiced but
[55:55] i've set in a lot of services in my life
[55:58] truthfully i've said in some i wish i
[56:00] hadn't been in but
[56:03] [Music]
[56:06] i love it when god just a man's word
[56:09] we live in a very special time
[56:15] and in that special time we we know that
[56:19] we know that god's doing incredible
[56:21] things
[56:22] we're in a special season special
[56:26] anointing is happening even this week
[56:30] i know you pay attention to the news a
[56:32] bit
[56:34] the pope makes a move to go to the
[56:37] birthplace of
[56:39] [Music]
[56:42] abraham
[56:44] now whether you realize this or not no
[56:47] pope
[56:48] which is the leader
[56:52] to almost 2 000 years has
[56:55] never went to that spot
[56:59] a lot of negotiations behind the scene
[57:01] happen
[57:02] to make that take place and you don't
[57:05] just go to anybody he goes to their
[57:07] leaders
[57:09] and set yesterday for about 40 45
[57:13] minutes and had a conversation
[57:15] here's two men that represent literally
[57:19] millions of people on the earth
[57:23] you see it's biblical prophecy
[57:27] that this pope not
[57:30] necessarily this pope
[57:33] but the pope will be a leader during the
[57:36] tribulation period
[57:39] and he'll bring the whole religions of
[57:41] the world together
[57:44] and he will be called man of peace
[57:49] america's not innocent in that
[57:53] just in the last few days they've
[57:55] rearranged the agreement with iraq
[57:59] so that that meeting could take place
[58:04] our president has made moves against
[58:08] israel
[58:12] and is once again reestablishing with
[58:15] palestine
[58:17] you see all of those things are biblical
[58:20] things to take place
[58:24] and as i stand in this pulpit this
[58:26] morning i realize that we are
[58:28] do we have another sunday
[58:33] do we have another two weeks do we have
[58:35] another year
[58:37] i would say after last night's service
[58:41] last week with brother wayne being here
[58:45] we're looking in a higher realm
[58:51] and we've got to realize 100
[58:55] the play in games that's done
[59:00] the play in church that's done
[59:05] we are fully committed
[59:08] we're totally fully committed
[59:12] that god would just move in our lives
[59:15] like
[59:15] never before amen
[59:19] amen and amen we certainly love you with
[59:21] all of our hearts and we
[59:23] we thank you for for everything and
[59:26] every prayer and every situation and
[59:30] and we love you so glad to have our
[59:32] sister with us
[59:33] and she's going to be with us for a bit
[59:36] and so we're so happy that
[59:37] you're here i understand you've been
[59:40] with two of my friends in your life and
[59:42] and uh brother isaiah brooks
[59:46] amen and so we love him with all of our
[59:48] hearts
[59:49] and uh and your pastor in africa
[59:55] i preach conventions with him and love
[59:57] him as well and so

[1:00:10] and don't know you well yet so but we
[1:00:12] were together before
[1:00:14] the foundation of the world amen
[1:00:17] amen thank you brother nathanael he's
[1:00:19] here as a precautionary this morning
[1:00:22] the devil's trying a few things and so
[1:00:24] he's a loser
[1:00:25] but it's always good to have a backup
[1:00:28] just in case
[1:00:29] and so amen god bless you
[1:00:32] god bless you god bless you if you will
[1:00:34] turn with me
[1:00:36] to matthew chapter 6
[1:00:39] and verse 9 then we'll go to revelations
[1:00:42] chapter 5.
[1:00:47] i'd like to look at the influence of our
[1:00:54] champion
[1:00:59] the influence of our champions
[1:01:10] name
[1:01:14] this is jesus's prayer it's very
[1:01:16] familiar to you
[1:01:19] and he's praying praying to god
[1:01:25] and only one thing in his mind it's
[1:01:27] doing the father's will
[1:01:30] and i want to say this to you that's all
[1:01:32] i have in my mind
[1:01:35] i really don't want to please myself i
[1:01:38] want to please him
[1:01:40] at the end of the day i want to please
[1:01:42] him
[1:01:43] that's all i have in my heart's desire
[1:01:46] jesus said this and after this manner
[1:01:50] therefore pray ye
[1:01:52] our father which art in heaven
[1:01:55] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:02:00] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:02:03] heaven
[1:02:05] give us this day our daily bread
[1:02:08] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:02:11] our debtors
[1:02:13] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:02:16] deliver us from evil
[1:02:18] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:02:21] and the glory forever amen
[1:02:25] for if ye forgive men their trespasses
[1:02:29] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:02:32] you
[1:02:33] but if you forgive not men their
[1:02:35] trespasses
[1:02:36] neither will your father forgive you
[1:02:40] your trespasses amen you may be seated
[1:02:44] to see
[1:02:47] it's me evening
[1:02:51] hallelujah may it not be the night when
[1:02:54] we finish
[1:02:54] so
[1:02:59] revelations chapter 5 and verse 1.
[1:03:02] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[1:03:05] sat on a throne a book
[1:03:06] written within and on the backside
[1:03:09] sealed with seven seals
[1:03:12] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:03:14] with a loud voice
[1:03:16] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:03:20] loose the seals thereof
[1:03:22] of all of the messengers down through
[1:03:24] the ages
[1:03:26] none of them were permitted to go to
[1:03:28] this portion
[1:03:31] even great men we mentioned just a week
[1:03:34] or so ago
[1:03:35] even spurgeon warned his ministers in
[1:03:38] his colleges
[1:03:40] don't touch that there will come a
[1:03:42] profit
[1:03:43] at the end that will deal with the seals
[1:03:48] that was good wisdom
[1:03:53] think of this god in this great wisdom
[1:03:59] writes a book so
[1:04:02] simple but yet so in depth
[1:04:06] to where the schools of men with some
[1:04:09] not just just a few men but thousands
[1:04:12] even
[1:04:13] millions have tried to open this
[1:04:16] scripture
[1:04:19] they know that's the truth have tried to
[1:04:22] open the scriptures
[1:04:24] and when you say brother ryan open the
[1:04:26] scriptures the baptism
[1:04:31] the godhead you want one just a little
[1:04:36] bit more complex
[1:04:38] abraham and sarah turning young again
[1:04:43] and moses writes it in such a way
[1:04:47] he hides it until this day
[1:04:51] [Applause]
[1:04:53] are you with me and even brother branham
[1:04:55] said that's one of the mysteries
[1:04:58] that would be given under the seals
[1:05:00] under the seventh seals
[1:05:03] and who was that to you
[1:05:09] so you are under the influence
[1:05:13] of an open book or the mighty angel
[1:05:18] now who is worthy to take this book
[1:05:25] no man in heaven nor in earth
[1:05:30] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:05:33] the book
[1:05:33] neither to look on
[1:05:38] i want you to just grasp that now of all
[1:05:41] the men of all the ages
[1:05:44] nobody could open this book
[1:05:52] nobody could open it john's writing this
[1:05:56] and he says i wept much
[1:05:58] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:06:02] and to read neither to look thereon
[1:06:07] and one of the elders saith unto me
[1:06:10] we've not
[1:06:12] behold the lion of the tribe of judah we
[1:06:15] all ought to shout right here
[1:06:17] the root of david had prevailed to open
[1:06:19] the book
[1:06:20] and to loose the seven seals thereof you
[1:06:23] say brother ron
[1:06:23] what was important about what was in the
[1:06:25] book my name was there
[1:06:28] [Applause]
[1:06:31] redemption was there it was all
[1:06:34] important that i found my name written
[1:06:37] in the book
[1:06:42] and i beheld in the midst of the throne
[1:06:44] and the four beasts in the midst of the
[1:06:46] elder stood a lamb
[1:06:49] this was not william branham's message
[1:06:52] this was the message of the lamb
[1:06:56] and as it was been slain having seven
[1:06:58] horns and seven
[1:07:00] eyes which are the seven spirits sent
[1:07:02] forth into all the earth
[1:07:05] and he came and he took the book out of
[1:07:07] the right hand
[1:07:08] of him that set up on the throne and
[1:07:10] when he had taken the book and the four
[1:07:13] beasts and the four
[1:07:14] and twenty elders fell down before the
[1:07:16] lamb
[1:07:19] having every one of them hearts and
[1:07:21] golden vials full of odors
[1:07:23] who which are the prayers of the saints
[1:07:27] and they sung a new song
[1:07:31] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:07:34] open the seals thereof
[1:07:36] for thou was slain and hast redeemed
[1:07:40] us
[1:07:43] to god by the blood out of every kindred
[1:07:46] tongue
[1:07:47] people and nation and has made us god
[1:07:50] and kings and priests and we shall reign
[1:07:53] on the earth
[1:07:55] hallelujah
[1:08:05] in revelation chapter 9 it talks about
[1:08:08] the depths of the
[1:08:09] the bottomless pit and the demons from
[1:08:13] the bottomless pit and all of their
[1:08:15] influence and we'll get into that just a
[1:08:17] bit but all of their influence on the
[1:08:19] earth
[1:08:20] and let me just say you and i live in
[1:08:22] laodicea to where that
[1:08:24] hell has has been enlarged
[1:08:31] and this has been declared by the
[1:08:34] prophet
[1:08:35] satan's eden
[1:08:39] it has been declared by the prophet the
[1:08:41] god of
[1:08:42] this evil age
[1:08:46] are you with me we know where we're
[1:08:48] standing
[1:08:50] we realize that there's an influence on
[1:08:53] the earth that's heading it toward
[1:08:55] a tribulation period
[1:08:59] are you with me listen when elvis
[1:09:01] presley came on the scene martin luther
[1:09:03] king came on the scene
[1:09:04] they had great influence are you with me
[1:09:08] now now let me just share this with you
[1:09:11] champions or men in great position
[1:09:15] has an influence and their followers you
[1:09:18] can tell what a man is influenced by
[1:09:21] by his actions by his conduct by his
[1:09:24] dress
[1:09:24] by the way he speaks by the music that
[1:09:28] he listens to
[1:09:30] by the books that he reads by the
[1:09:33] influence that he is under he literally
[1:09:35] takes on a personality
[1:09:40] how many of us personally impersonators
[1:09:42] are we have in the earth
[1:09:45] how many little boys became under the
[1:09:48] influence of a michael jordan
[1:09:52] are you with me and i may be behind the
[1:09:54] times now but
[1:09:55] you listen who's the greatest or or a
[1:09:58] tom brady or
[1:09:59] or whatever it would be and they get
[1:10:03] under the influence of those individuals
[1:10:06] or the influence of some hollywood star
[1:10:10] or a marilyn monroe or the goddess of
[1:10:13] this day
[1:10:16] i find it interesting that demus
[1:10:18] shakarian
[1:10:19] that sold the pentecostal church right
[1:10:22] into catholicism
[1:10:25] are you with me that his grandfathers
[1:10:30] the kardashians
[1:10:34] and that's the kardashians and i'm sorry
[1:10:36] this may get to them but this is the way
[1:10:38] they is
[1:10:39] they sold their birthright
[1:10:44] they sold their birthright and i don't
[1:10:47] care how much money they have
[1:10:49] it's not enough to go to hell for
[1:11:00] you can dress yourself up as a goddess
[1:11:03] of the world
[1:11:04] but let me just say you're only
[1:11:06] reflecting another realm
[1:11:12] are you with me are you with me now
[1:11:20] now that becomes the goddess of some
[1:11:23] people's minds
[1:11:24] forgive me for going in that negative
[1:11:26] realm just for a moment
[1:11:29] but don't let yourself get caught
[1:11:35] looking at the wrong kind of champion
[1:11:41] can i have 100 participation there
[1:11:43] [Applause]
[1:11:45] are you with me we're not playing church
[1:11:46] here young people don't get yourself
[1:11:49] your
[1:11:49] eyes
[1:11:52] with people influenced
[1:11:56] from a demonic realm
[1:12:02] is that all right is that all right
[1:12:06] sometimes people get influenced in the
[1:12:08] political realm
[1:12:10] don't don't even fool with that nonsense
[1:12:14] are you with me
[1:12:19] we live in age right now in a time right
[1:12:23] now where
[1:12:24] covet has paralyzed the world
[1:12:29] but you've got an angel with you
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:35] hey listen i agree with being safe and
[1:12:37] being protective and washing hands and
[1:12:39] wearing masks
[1:12:41] and and keeping and keeping distances as
[1:12:44] well i
[1:12:44] i try to participate in all of that but
[1:12:47] let me just say
[1:12:48] my i'm not looking to the political
[1:12:51] system
[1:12:52] to keep me safe
[1:12:53] [Applause]
[1:13:02] because they don't know what causes it
[1:13:05] and they don't know what prevents it
[1:13:08] but we've got a god that's
[1:13:11] greater than all of that nonsense
[1:13:38] revelation chapter 10.
[1:13:46] let's have a take a moment here
[1:13:52] and i saw another mighty angel
[1:13:55] come down from heaven you're either
[1:13:58] influenced from one realm or another
[1:14:01] round
[1:14:04] brother right i'm sitting on the fence
[1:14:06] you're either influenced from one realm
[1:14:09] or another realm
[1:14:12] either king jesus is sitting on the
[1:14:14] throne of your heart
[1:14:18] now i mean let me just let you fill in
[1:14:20] the blink here
[1:14:21] our king
[1:14:25] is sitting on the room of your hearts
[1:14:30] there is no neutral ground
[1:14:33] it is either king jesus or king lucifer
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:41] and that's why you must have a new birth
[1:14:45] it is imperative that you have a new
[1:14:47] birth
[1:14:48] well brother ron is all of that
[1:14:50] necessary that happened here last night
[1:14:52] i would say for that young man
[1:14:56] his life has changed and there was
[1:15:00] influence that was trying to pull him
[1:15:01] this way and that way and this way and
[1:15:04] that way
[1:15:05] let me just say the kingdom this world
[1:15:08] will pull you in many directions
[1:15:11] but there's a god of heaven that will
[1:15:14] pull you
[1:15:16] because that seed that was planted there
[1:15:18] before the
[1:15:19] foundation of the world
[1:15:32] now this message
[1:15:35] is under the influence
[1:15:39] notice in verse 7 but in the days of the
[1:15:43] voice of the seventh angel
[1:15:46] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:15:49] of god
[1:15:49] should be finished there's not another
[1:15:53] messenger coming
[1:15:57] let me just say this to you if this
[1:15:59] message did not awaken you
[1:16:01] and prepare you for the rapture i want
[1:16:04] to say this very clearly to you
[1:16:06] there's not another one coming
[1:16:10] now brother branham as the earthly
[1:16:12] messenger
[1:16:13] god allowed him and entrusted him but he
[1:16:17] was
[1:16:17] he was accompanied by the angel of the
[1:16:21] lord
[1:16:23] the ark of the covenant the i am
[1:16:26] was among him the messenger himself
[1:16:32] brother brown would tell us you're not
[1:16:34] feeding on the mind of a man
[1:16:36] you're feeding on the body word of the
[1:16:38] son of man
[1:16:40] jesus christ himself
[1:16:46] are you with me before 63 he was probing
[1:16:52] after the seals were revealed and christ
[1:16:54] came down
[1:16:55] revelations 10 1 after that was
[1:16:58] fulfilled
[1:16:59] he said what was prophecy now is history
[1:17:04] are you with me and now listen
[1:17:07] the earthly messenger had to depart
[1:17:12] it was part of the decreasing and the
[1:17:14] increasing
[1:17:16] are you with me the earthly messenger
[1:17:18] had to leave
[1:17:21] but brother ronnie he left by a car
[1:17:23] wreck hit back
[1:17:24] by a by a drunk god's not dainty
[1:17:30] how he takes his servants off of the
[1:17:32] earth
[1:17:34] whether it was chopping his head off
[1:17:35] with a chop block
[1:17:39] are you with me he's not danky how he
[1:17:41] takes his messengers
[1:17:43] don't get your wrap your eyes off of how
[1:17:45] men leave the earth
[1:17:46] when god's done with them he's done with
[1:17:49] them
[1:17:51] are you with me he'll raise another are
[1:17:53] you with me
[1:18:00] are you with me now i want to say some
[1:18:03] strong things right here so you hang
[1:18:04] right with me now
[1:18:06] i want you very alert we are not under
[1:18:09] the influence of michael jordan
[1:18:13] we're not under the influence of donald
[1:18:15] trump
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:21] are you with me now listen we did not
[1:18:25] come as
[1:18:26] ministers to be little weak and branhams
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:18:32] but we are under the influence of the
[1:18:34] mighty angel
[1:18:36] himself that strong angel
[1:18:40] the voice that is behind the voice
[1:18:44] the author of the book the author and
[1:18:47] the future
[1:18:49] of our faith
[1:18:56] and he is here to do business
[1:19:00] to finish the work
[1:19:12] because remember the book your names
[1:19:15] were there
[1:19:16] [Applause]
[1:19:17] and he will not lose one
[1:19:24] he knew you were coming he preserved
[1:19:27] your seed
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:31] you're one out of a million and he
[1:19:33] watched over you and your
[1:19:35] attributes all the way down do you think
[1:19:38] he's brought you
[1:19:39] this far to lose you
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:46] do you think he's brought you this far
[1:19:49] to just leave you in the stream
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:53] he's more determined
[1:19:58] he's more determined now than
[1:20:01] ever to finish this race
[1:20:42] could you just bow your head and pray
[1:20:45] andrew would you come in free
[1:21:40] god bless you
[1:21:55] [Applause]
[1:22:00] the enemy has tried to stop this word
[1:22:04] the enemy has tried to stop the
[1:22:06] influence of this angel
[1:22:08] but the angel cannot be stopped the
[1:22:11] angel is on the move
[1:22:14] he's determined to finish what he
[1:22:15] started
[1:22:17] he's determined to get you where you
[1:22:19] need to be at
[1:22:21] he's determined that your prayers that
[1:22:22] you have prayed
[1:22:24] they will go there and they will set
[1:22:25] those things free that you've been
[1:22:27] asking for
[1:22:29] those those things that that are being
[1:22:31] held up in your life those things that
[1:22:33] are held up that prayer is going to
[1:22:35] break that because there's power and
[1:22:36] prayer there's an angel that is with you
[1:22:39] there's an angel that's watching you
[1:22:41] and you are god's children who has more
[1:22:45] power in heaven and earth
[1:22:46] a son of god or an angel in heaven you
[1:22:49] do
[1:22:50] and when you started praying in the name
[1:22:52] of jesus christ
[1:22:54] it's as if jesus was praying you are
[1:22:56] under the influence
[1:22:58] of another you're not under the
[1:23:00] influence as brother ron said of michael
[1:23:02] jordan or the things of the world you're
[1:23:04] under the influence of an angel that has
[1:23:06] taken a message
[1:23:07] that's put it in the in the lips of the
[1:23:09] of human beings
[1:23:11] and has taken that message and is
[1:23:13] running with that message
[1:23:14] you see god isn't just in the business
[1:23:17] of of sending a message and letting it
[1:23:19] lay on the ground
[1:23:20] or letting it lay on tapes it's coming
[1:23:22] off of that tape
[1:23:23] it's coming into book form and it's
[1:23:25] coming off a book form
[1:23:26] into human form and that's where the
[1:23:29] enemy has trouble at is when
[1:23:31] the word of the hour comes off of the
[1:23:33] pages of the book
[1:23:35] and it comes in human form and human
[1:23:37] form
[1:23:38] starts taking that word and starts
[1:23:40] living out what was said
[1:23:41] and there's a people on earth today that
[1:23:44] are walking in the footsteps of the son
[1:23:46] of man
[1:23:47] the same authority the same life the
[1:23:50] same power the same anointing
[1:23:52] you are the walking in the footsteps of
[1:23:55] the son of man
[1:23:56] when he walked on earth he healed the
[1:23:58] leper when he walked on earth he raised
[1:24:00] a dead man
[1:24:01] when he walked on earth he did these
[1:24:03] things because he was
[1:24:05] influenced by the father he said in john
[1:24:08] chapter 5 and 19 i can do nothing except
[1:24:10] my father first chose me
[1:24:12] you're not here by happenstance this
[1:24:14] morning
[1:24:15] you're here because the father sent you
[1:24:18] here and when the authority of that word
[1:24:20] comes forth
[1:24:21] from a bride that has the same life on
[1:24:24] the inside of her
[1:24:25] it'll produce the same works that the
[1:24:27] angel produced
[1:24:29] you don't have to get shook up about you
[1:24:31] got to do this and you got to do that or
[1:24:33] what's going to happen in my life
[1:24:35] the angel will do the work
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:39] you are told just to prophesy you're to
[1:24:41] stand there and stand in your position
[1:24:44] roll your shoulders back say i am a son
[1:24:47] of god

[1:24:50] speak this word
[1:24:51] i was told to live this word satan move
[1:24:54] off of god's property
[1:24:58] he's tried to stop ron spencer this
[1:25:00] morning but the angels here
[1:25:03] the angels visited us this morning
[1:25:06] you said i wanted more from ron spencer
[1:25:09] in 15 minutes if you could capture
[1:25:11] what happened in the last 15 minutes

[1:25:15] it'll set your heart offline it'll set
[1:25:17] your soul free
[1:25:19] if you can realize what happened here
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:22] [Applause]
[1:25:23] can you imagine the word that was
[1:25:25] dropped here just in a few moments
[1:25:27] it's so upset hell
