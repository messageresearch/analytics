never lost a battle it'll defeat Satan anytime anyplace anywhere and then we just want to commit these things to God this morning we want to bind our hearts together in prayer and ask that the Lord would use brother Wayne this is a very supernatural meeting this is a supernatural occurrence that has taken place brother Wayne had not intended to be here but it placed upon the leadership here this

morning and his brother on he comes and prays you pray with him god bless you this morning [Music] how many's believing this morning I believe that many two or three can agree and there's a lot more than two or three hands up this morning I believe we can cast every every sickness out of this building every fear out of this building by the power of the name of Jesus Christ that we heard last night there is so many redemptive powers in that name it's not all we can do to pray that is our first choice of action is to pray let's agree together that we could intercede for these needs father Lord we love you Jesus we love you Lord Father there's none like You Lord well God is the songwriter oh we could search and search father we'd never find a power like yours father there's no there's no atomic power there's nope there's no power on earth like your power god father we heard last night what an encouragement that you're you are the God you are God alone and before time again you were God father Lord not only were you God then but we were with you then father we were in your mind then before there was time and Lord in that perfect body Lord you saw us here in this valley Lord may be some sick Lord some afflicted Lord many names were read father these requests that were brought before you Lord but you saw that need Lord and you wanted to express your attribute of healing to that need Lord you wanted to express your attribute of comfort to that need and father I pray right now by the faith of the saints in this building Lord that we could unite under one faith and one power Lord to reach out and claim that victory this morning God we know that that it'll only last for a just a night Lord that sorrow only lasts for just tonight Lord but joy comes in the morning and Lourdes morning time in the house of God Lord it's morning time in our faith Lord that we are looking for the rising of the Sun Lord to come with healing in his wings Lord father that we can tread out on the ashes of the wicked father Lord by your word you said we could do it Lord and father were trusting only in you Lord this morning that you could have Lord preeminence in each and every heart I pray that we just look to you Father that Lord through the songs that are about to be sung Lord and father the the words that are going to come forth Lord I pray every fear would be cast down Lord you said Lord through your prophet that the worst the worst enemy the church has this fear Lord I pray that the spirit of fear would be cast out of this church this morning God I pray that that spirit of

we'll give it all to you you're our God and we love you this morning asking you now take these words and use them for your glory in Jesus name we pray a man and a man and God bless you if you have your Bibles we want to just take a few minutes and the word this morning Book of Psalms the sixteenth chapter Book of Psalms the sixteenth chapter and maybe just to just to read here a portion of Scripture I I love this 16th chapter of Psalms of course it's it's a it's it's quite a powerful psalm preserve me O God for in thee do I put my trust oh my soul that has said under the Lord thou art my Lord my goodness extended not to thee but to the saints that are in the earth and to the excellent in whom all my delight their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another God their drink offerings of blood will I not offered nor take up the names into my lips for the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and if my cup down maintaining my lot you can never read this without thinking of brother Branham walking out of that your Roberts University and saying looking around and Lord said I'm your portion a man I don't know about you all but I'll take the Lord is my portion amen the Lord is my portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintainence my Lots the lines are fallen unto me in Pleasant places yeah I have a godly heritage I will bless the Lord who have given me counsel my rains also instruct me in the night season I have set the Lord always before me but RAM actually compares this when Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God he said this that he actually is showing that that's what David is saying I've set the Lord before me always because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices my flesh shall rest and hope for that will not suffer that will not leave my soul in Hell neither with I'll suffer thine Holy One to see corruption now this is Messianic prophecy right here amen but we are air right amen thou will show me the path of life now if you're a study or the message by the brand preaches an entire sermon right here the path of life amen and in thy presence is the fullness of joy at the right hand there are pleasures forevermore we ask the Lord to bless his word this morning I want to if you just be seated I'd like to just take a few minutes this morning to speak to you on this subject of in thy presence is the fullness of joy we're in thy presence it is the fullness of joy amen and I I think of sometimes when you start thinking about this it's a powerful a powerful subject to think about that God brings joy when he becomes present in the church you know some time ago I was just preaching a little bit and I was back on that little the the Bible talks about a woman who brought the alabaster all to Jesus you know and I thought it was amazing is that Jesus tells after this great example of worship but this woman washes the feet of Jesus and and she she dries his feet with her hair and she lays out that Jesus actually said that every time the gospel is preached wherever it is preached you need to mention this woman and I thought it was amazing is that as that the Lord Jesus was ensuring that this woman would always be mentioned where his gospel is preached because something that she did in the way she acted toward his presence was something that he thought that would be a memorial now I kind of think is funny that the Lord wouldn't would actually make sure that even the stiffest church members had to hear this you know I mean even the stiffest churches it don't matter where in the world is priest Teknik they actually have to read this and talk about this poor woman who got down in the face of everyone in warship Taniya can y'all only imagine this little girl running the end of the end of the end of the house of Simon the straight Pharisee and all these religious people and this woman seen an opportunity was right in front of her that she would have never had an opportunity that was just just she just happened to be passing by and saw that man sitting there and and that something struck her little heart there's an opportunity right here right now that I could get in the presence of Jesus Christ and she she had heard about the feet of Jesus right amen the Prophet said another harlot had told her that had been caught in adultery had been through at the feet of Jesus and at the feet of Jesus the Pharisees was trying to stone her and it was at the feet of Jesus that he protected her and gave her a new life and said go and sin no more and she happened to see this little girl passing by happen to see there's nobody at his feet so there's an opportunity here that I could get in his feet and good things happen at the feet of Jesus amen brother BAM said she went home and got everything she had and went and bought that all amen and she come in and brother man said it like this he said she literally elbowed her way amen into the feet of Jesus amen he a man she elbowed her way to get there and I tell you I him and there's nothing like a people Amen that's willing to elbow their way through they meant to get to the feet of Jesus Christ because if you can ever get to the feet of Jesus and some powerful things begin to happen at the feet of Jesus there's something I love about this little woman Haman when she got there all the things that she had been holding back her whole life all the little things she had never gave to no man she had never gave to anybody but when she got into feet of Jesus she started giving every thing she ever they mend them things that she had held back she started giving up right there and I'll tell you when it gets to the feet of Jesus that's a time right amen and brother Branham makes it makes a point out of this in a message of pride he said when she got to the feet of Jesus he said notice she broke open that model he meant she didn't she didn't she didn't take the lid off and use a little all he meant in the ideas she might put the lid back on sometime he said but she broke the bottle amen and when you break open the bottle it means I'm not planning on leaving here with nothing amen I'm not planning to save on something for later amen but I'll tell you what she was willing to do right then was pour out everything she had at the feet of Jesus Christ now you can only imagine she's crying she's shouting she's weeping amen the slots running all is all over her amen free consensus on the carpet or on the rugs and it's on Jesus and it's on her my she'd made a mess amen and brother Brendan said this little girl from this position looks up at G he said she looks up and she starts thinking in her mind am I doing wrong am i doing wrong amen have you ever been there have you ever have you ever woke up from a shot and fit so did I be wrong amen but the Prophet says he says she was thinking have I done wrong he said then all of a sudden I say unto her thy sins which are many are forgiven go in peace he said see she wasn't doing wrong but she was worshipping in a place that can remove every sin she was worshipping somebody who can forgive her every problem now I tell you something when you set out to begin to worship the God of Abraham there are things released in the presence of God that you're not gonna get in the presence of anybody else amen but in the presence of God you see what she did when she recognized his presence when she recognized his presence 1964 unrecognized presence brother BAM said if we can only recognize Amen that he is appearing to us in this meeting for one purpose and that's to release our desires that we have in him Hey we've got to recognize his presence and now you recognize his presence is when the promised word for the age is manifested not seen not the promised word of another age so how do we recognize the presence of God when the word has been fulfilled that is the true identification of divine presence now brother Branham Oh tell us tell us in the in the ministry he'll tell us Amen that there are pastors and preachers and evangelists and teachers he said but see now my ministry is different than theirs he said my ministry is actually to prove the reality of his presence he said to bring you into the reality of the presence of Jesus Christ that you may see him know him and identify the promise of your name do you see what brother Ram did for us he took us beyond our feelings he took us on beyond the idea that we feel the presence of God so when we don't feel him he's not present when we do feel him he is presence that's where the Pentecostals were when the Prophet came to him but then he proved to them that Jesus Christ is right here in our midst right now whether we're on top of the mountain or whether we're in the valley whether we're aware intellectually aware or unaware Jesus crisis in the presence of the church right now amen he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I will be there in the midst of him then right now Jesus Christ is in this building and I believe he's here more than I believe you're setting the left view Amen my eyes could deceive me but the word could never deceive me and if God said he's here then he's here right now and if you start focusing on his presence and you start just saying I'm always here and you begin to worship only after just a little while it'll begin to break in on you didn't you see that the declaration of his presence is higher than just the way we feel but brother Ram said my ministry is to declare to you that he is here amen in other words brother man's whole ministry which was put to the point to prove to you that you are in the presence of Jesus Christ right now amen do you say Amen what difference does it make do you see when you see that when you see that you're in his presence it will affect you in a way a man that'll bless you and then it'll change your realities it'll change the way you think about things when you go in the scripture and you look and you can see me and who went in the presence of God men who became aware of the presence of God amen I go into the Book of Isaiah and I see Isaiah and how that Isaiah one day in desperation I tell you amen have you ever come to desperation there's a place to go when you're desperate right amen and the place you go when you're desperate is you go to the house of God just like Isaiah did and Isaiah went to the house of God like he had a lot of times but this time he come with a prayer of desperation and when Isaiah began to pray on the stair on the if the temple the Bible said a vision opened up before him and Isaiah became aware of the presence of God by a manifested vision he looked and saw the presence of God feel the temple he saw the train of God feel the temple can you imagine a man Amen think he was just in a church and all of a sudden his vision was opened and he was able to see the presence of God filled the whole temple Amen and you say well well what did he see I think it's powerful because when you see the presence of God then you know there are things presence when God is present lot don't come by himself God don't come by himself but he has an entourage with him Amen do you know that when Isaiah saw the presence of God he saw the seraphim's were there flying around and filling the temple which are amen which are a higher order of angels right Seraphim sigh I know there's winged angels and there's we angels that's not winged Amen there's some somebody said well I don't think Angels have wings yes they have wings there's some angels that have wings some angels don't have wings you say how do you know preacher I've seen them I've actually seen two in my lifetime one day man I just seen one down there brother Tim preach the other day standing standing right there your pastor was sitting next to me he said he's here by the way and he's here I said I believe you and I acknowledged he's here but I didn't see anything to say that he was here amen but somewhere in the middle of that service I looked up and there stood an angel standing by the banister looking at the man of God preaching and I'm next your pastor and I said hey brother Ron hey man I believe you I see one the angel standing right there watching that man you can see it on tape I don't remember which service it is but you can see me pointing at it in the middle of service and then watch the service right after that the service went boom amen and what was it it was God making himself known he was there the whole time he's making himself aware the people that serve Him now Isaiah saw that he saw the presence of God and saw those Seraphim zazz they was circle around that throng now brother Branham said now notice these cell phones because they had six wings right with six wings two of them covered the face two wings would cover the feet and with two wings those serums would fly him the presence of God so brother Branham says to us amen the two wings he said seek covering face and feet spoke of both humility and reverence humility and reverence a mint then he said with two wings he would fly so a man when he comes in the presence of God he said if he will humble himself and he will reverence God then he will go into action amen and Isaiah seal at brother Branham said watch now he saw those angels who had never sinned angels who had never been out of the presence of God and those angels had to cover him and they had to cover their faces the presence of God can you imagine something as holy as an angel had to cover its face in the presence of God but the RAM said they had to have a special covering to stand there because they're the closest thing to God he said but listen I want to say something right now that the blood of Jesus Christ is a sufficient covering and Christ never died for a Seraphim but he died amen for the created beings he never died for the angels he died for sinners can you imagine if angels had to have a covering in the presence of God what about men and women who are born sinners how much greater than they need the blood of Jesus Christ to stand in the presence of God I think God tonight Center this morning to know that God has covered the church with the blood of Jesus Christ I do you do you thank God for your covering this morning you see you got to be covered that's why in the Ark of the Covenant amen it was a it was it was wood ain't meant covered with gold amen brother man said watch now deity had to cover humanity amen and when you have the blood of Jesus on you that's not a human blood applied to you that is the blood of God applied to the church that they can stand in the presence of God by deity covering them then they're actually covered by the blood I know sometimes we wonder we think about it we say well hey man I don't know about getting in the presence because it's fearful but did y'all know that in the Old Testament actually one time of year amen they would actually offer their sacrifice and they would they would actually take the blood out of all the sacrifices and they would they would gather that blood and then they brother BAM said it like this he said they would go out and pour it out on the fires of Israel Haman in the camp official had poured out on the fire he said the blood being poured on the fire a smoke would go up over Israel they would make the fire smoke and when the smoke would cover Israel that was a moment that all of Israel could come out of their tents and they get under that smoke and they can begin to worship brother man said because God was not able to see their sin through that smoke he would only hear their voices ascending up in the glory I think God this morning that the blood of Jesus Christ has become a smoke over our lives amen that God could not see our sins he can only hear our voices as we worship through the blood of Jesus Christ amen - God you are not a sinner this morning you are a child of God under the blood of God and you've got every right to praise God Amen I tell you sometimes I think we forget what the blood sent for us it's let us kill in the presence of God and rather than hiding in the presence we can begin to worship in the presence of God we can praise and we can rejoice hallelujah we don't have to hide ourselves God is here this under the blood ain't man and when a man comes under the blood a man only thing you gotta do it just let go and let God Amen am I doing wrong no you really see forgiveness you're releasing healing you're releasing desire hey man when a man comes under the blood hey man I'll tell you this sometimes sometimes when you a men are preaching it and I know in the message of the hour hey I remember brother Ron when people didn't rejoice like this I remember 20 years ago when I first started on the field and if you preach a good hot sermon on the baptism the Holy Ghost it was a lot of the pastors had you in the back talking to you about we're not Pentecostals hey man you don't know how glad I was to see a little turn in that Hey to see when you start preaching this message now it's not a bunch of people sitting with her arms folded and legs crossed there's the people of God on the face of the earth today they come to have church they come to worship America we didn't come for an intellectual sermon we've had all the religion were looking for we're looking for a place to come and worship the creator and the may God of all heaven hey he's God we might as well stand up and say it he's gone oh yeah you know what people say they see people didn't used to worship like this you get Liberty people used to didn't have this kind of Liberty amen and every time this happens when I'm preaching I hear no devil hey man I can hear only intellectual devil and you're just working the people that brother Wayne you're just working the people I was preaching the other day and I've heard that come to me you're just working the people up and I've heard a voice ain't written that sweet one inside me I heard the Holy Spirit say to me that's not true he said actually he said there's some people holding back amen the Spirit of God told me there's people sitting in this church right now and that they're holding back amen there's people here that would like to worship like they'd never worship before amen amen I'm not taking you somewhere you don't want to go there's people sitting right here waited their whole life but stand up in a service and glory to God let the Holy Ghost come I tell you tonight there's no sense of being a little lecture bound up Church are you doing something wrong no we're not doing something wrong we're worshipping a creator and he inhabits the praise of his people Oh glory amen you know what I'm talking about there some people can praise when everything's going good and some people praise when they're up on top of the mountain but this little groups of different groups we are at different people amen and we place when the lights go out we praise when sickness comes with placement trouble comes amen we're gonna praise our way right out of every affliction they never try one same Satan I never lost my job I never lost my place God gave me the phrase of my life I know the devil comes to take it he's a thief he's a robber he come to steal everything you got but I went to the enemy's camp and I took back everything hallelujah we're armed and dangerous we're armed and dangerous come on somebody threw a rock at that baby he leveraged I feel every intellectual we're here to praise God who can close the life to come back to the heart again some people can praise on the mountain some people can praise when everything goes good come on church the stars can sack but moon can rejoice the earth can sing the Wells have a song everything in heaven everything in earth everything in the sea praises God but he wasn't happy with that he created man and let man fall because he wanted to angels to hear something he wanted the angels to hear a different kind of place angels never failed angels never were sick angels never had trouble even Adam could speak to the trees could tell the mountains what to do but Adam was living in a perfect place with a perfect time but God told his angels watch this and let mankind Falls and now mankind amen here in the fall amen fighting every adversary fight never disease fight depression fight nervousness find your humanity but there's something on the inside that raises up in the church oh the devil don't know what to do with you the devil don't know what to do he makes you sick and you please small now and you did when you were well he travelled a lot and you've raised more now you know why the devil attacks them chill because he's a stupid devil you said preacher what do you talk about I'll tell you one I loved him if he proved it I don't know about y'all he's a buddy of mine but Timothy said when Samson killed a thousand Philistines he said what was that 999 Philistine fainted it been done killed 998 what was he doing sticking around Amen if he killed 999 Amen wouldn't he kill a thousand come on church God's already killed how many Philistines and he keeps thinking he's gonna kill but there's a church we've got a fold in our hand we've got a rock in our hand we've got a spear in our hand I know they think David was crazy when David picked up their rocks a man has started down that hill because brother branham said David danced his way into the battle looked like he was dancing himself into the face of death and he was dancing in the one of the greatest victories and he would ever have in his life ain't let me tell you something David was appraiser David was a dancer but he praised and danced and David's holy secret for in the presence of God is the fullness of joy joy like you've never known not joy from your situation not joy from your trial Oh see here comes another one preacher you're too loud isn't it amazing in that amazing the intellectuals in the last days Amen it's too loud do you know what I found out this is the quietest place this is the quietest place that you're ever going to me let me let me warn y'all I'm gonna be in heaven I'm giving you a warning I'm gonna be in heaven and if you think that I'm proud and shouting and rejoicing down here you think that I'm rejoicing here you ain't brother you wait till I put my feet on the streets of gold oh the battles are over and all the trials are home hallelujah I tell you this morning Church we've got a right to shout we've gotta steal my joy ain't gonna let no devil take my praise I'm anointed to praise God I'm anointed to rejoice oh by the way I think this thing's like this there's no out of order you know what's amazing to me brother brand picks that spirit up in his day and he says I want you to watch right here in Isaiah he said once y'all see something he said these angels were going around the presence of God and he said they were crying holy holy holy under the Lord he said you might have thought they were whispering he said you might have thought oh they were holy hush whispering but a prophet picked it up and he said I want you to notice something he heard the voice of one angel as they have heard the voice of one angel and said his voice shook the temple but the man said one voice of one angel shook the temple he said then what about a million of them sounding at the same time brother you talking about worship you talking about praise when you get in the presence of God that it's not an end of worship that is the beginning of worship he said preacher what are you trying to say I'm trying to say we got a lot of guys in the end time preaching presence presence divine presence he's here he's here Amen but the next thing you know there's no praise there's no worship there's no inspiration it turns into dry intellectual teaching but let me tell you if you really believe he's here he is a God of Abraham and he requires praise and when a man steps in the presence of God he's got to begin to rejoice and praise the God that he's come into oh listen you said well I don't affect me like that it's amazing to me because I got a Bible I got a Bible you know what my Bible says when Isaiah got in his presence it affected him when Abraham got in his presence it affected health when Isaac got in his presence it affected him when this little woman got in his presence it affected her amen when Moses come in the presence it affected him wouldn't David done in his presence it affected him what I'm telling you it should take coming to the presence of God without it affecting you it's gonna change you it's gonna do something wholly inside of you come on church you're not a dad and to let your people you're the Church of the firstborn forged by the holy ghost oh oh but it's a long time by the way it's a long time that's why God called you an eagle you're an eagle do you know that tell somebody beside you you're an eagle you're an eagle do you know why God called you an eagle William Branham said this he called you an eagle because he said it's the only bird that can go all the way down and God would renew its youth begin that way he was saying to you God has a right to call you back to a renewing no matter how low you get he's got a right to say to you that's enough come on up here you've been in the bow down coming up here God reserves right to defy every devil and tell his Church cuddled up here storm is still there problems are still there but you ain't you spread your wings and you've rose above the atmosphere into a soaring realm where the sun is shining this morning every person a man has been affected by God you okay you can't say to me that God can come in the building you you can't you you can't convince me amen if a man is really truly aware of the presence of God he will be affected by the presence of God unless there's nothing in you brother and said the only reason you can't strike a match if there's no sulfur on the match but if the match has sulfur on it you can strike it across a piece of Flint and she'll fire right up well let me tell you that gene seed in me it's the sulfur and this message is the flinch and the mind and I look across it there's a fire that come up inside of me a man that I tell you what the devil can't put it out hey man he's boned on it and he's pulled on nobody told that gum devil that when you blow on the fire he put it out it makes it harder when you blow the fire it don't put it out it burns hotter listen tonight the old winds of sale has blew against the church but we're not going to be put out we're not gonna be stopped as a church that's gonna burn than it ever has we're gonna plan our life but never bird we're going to feel the fire of God the Father hallelujah that's no reason to quit no reason to give up [Applause] [Music] here's God he's gone of the heavens he's got earlier Satan you lost the battle [Music] [Applause] but you're defeated you can bail but she's gonna burn I was by myself right now ain't nobody can do you like Jesus hey nobody can touch you like Jesus he can touch it like it can't be touched nowheres else all people so we seen the glory of God and it didn't affect them now they didn't see the glory of God they got the presence of some intellectual teacher if it ever gets into your vision oh who you're worshiping and what your praise is designed to do then you know it was the secret that got the Hebrew children out of the fire it was the secret that got Daniel how does the lion stand it was the secret that got Jonah out of the belly of the whale hey man the man has to be didn't appraise when they can't see no day life he praises to the clouds break when a man can't see a way out he many praises of God but tonight the way amen there's a God here this morning and is able to tear down every wall he's able to open ever see so what do you know nature I'll tell you what I'm doing I'm torn rocks at that devil and tell every child of God he's her liberated in the Holy Ghost what's in your hand what's in your hand take whatever you got and Chuck in it that devil when you begin praising can you begin worshipping devils start running for the hills hey hey men you deacons open up the door let the devil out of here I think he's had all I can take get on out of here devil we're the children of God we are the children of the Most High God we're not stepchildren we're not all for children we are black hot blurred boring children of the Most High pop no we're not babies were not instance we are full mature sons that know exactly where we are Oh people's well I seen the glory of God well they they say they sing the glory of God but then turn the intellectual and then turn and preach against the very thing that brings delivered that brings life do you think about this now and some 16 David said I put the Lord always before me you know why that man live the way he live cuz God was before him he was actually conscious he was actually conscious of the presence of god do you know what william branham did he made you conscious he made you conscious sitting in him in a building somebody under a load like they'd never been under and brother man would say sitting there sitting right back here in the back has a lot of hanging over your heads you're praying about certain certain things it's your daughter and he starts going through it like that and a woman starts going somebody's here besides that man and they become conscious do you think that God came right the inner was he already there and a prophet was just unveiling his presence to the people glob was unveiling something to them now notice this because sometimes Amen we get into places and the enemy has to say but let's say Chester God is leaving us God is God is gonna leave us to our own devices let me just let me just first of all say that is absolutely false teaching then ain't nothing but the devil let me give you the word the word said a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me for I will be with you even in you until when until when until the first strong battle until the first problem under the first trouble you come until the first failure I love William branham's message because brother madam turned over in Ephesians and said the Bible said grieve not the Holy Spirit were your prophet well you're sealed unto the day of redemption but the man said then you're sealed up not from revival to revival but you're sealed up til you get there you've sealed up in other words you are God's private property you are God's private property and the devil can trespass but he can't stay Amen when the devil trespasses that's what he does it's like a deer hunter knows all the good bucks is behind the sign Amen they close the fence but the landowner if he's any kind of a real God or manager he'll watch for that and the first time you sneak over the fence Amen he'll put you back over he can't help you climb the fence but he ain't gonna let you hunt on his ground and the devil's gonna trespass he's gonna try to sneak in but God has angels who are circling the camp and every time a devil steps in God says send them back [Applause] send them back now you think about this brother man said God's private properties the bride he said in straighten with trespass on that but God has commissioned the church he's commissioned the church to say to you this is your ground right that's why in Joshua the first chapter you'll read them say thou shalt not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of my life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee and will not fail thee nor forsake thee let me tell you brother amen I know Josh was about to encounter walls Joshua was about to counter some things Amen that nobody probably had encountered in their life but you know before he took the first step on that new ground he already had a promise from God as I was shall shall I be Amen in other words God was the reason Moses part of the waters God was the reason that the hailstorm came God is the reason that the firstborn of Egypt died God is the reason he can bring water from Iraq and God was telling Joshua look I have been God with Moses but I'll be caught with thee do you see by the RAM preachers an entire sermon has I was with Moses do you see what he's saying he's not the god that was he is the God that he is a man and he's not just a god that was he's a God that is and he's a God that is with his church right now today he is right here his personal presence is in the Church of the Living God we can say he's on the present couldn't we but did what to say that would would to sell short what's actually happening because God does know all things because he's all places amen but it's his knowledge that puts him everywhere at the same time but don't never don't never think Amen that he's he's with you the way he's with the Roman Church he knows their ever move but he's with you in a different way he's with them in knowledge of what they will do how they will do it he see all-knowing God but when it comes to the church he has took his personal presence and tabernacled in you as an individual because God has a temple they said preacher what are you saying I'm telling you that there is another realm with you when you walk down the street there is a tabernacle you're a man Isaiah song on the presence of God and said there's angels flying around him and there's chair phones and cell phones and there's that's an altar I see you realize that when you walk down the street there's an entire entourage of supernatural beings walking with you when you walk down the road come on church amen either God his tabernacle or not but the Balaam said your heart is the throne of Almighty God the Spirit is now in your heart right now and the presence of God is around the church now now if you notice this Amen it was this very thing that caught the attention of Joshua when he said as I was so will I be right as I was so will I be it meant in other words that God was with him now now you can take this little story and it'll show it greatly you go back in the time of Elijah when Elijah was with with with with the children of Israel amen and Syria was constantly trying to kill the children of Israel Syria was constantly trying to get at them amen but God anointed a seer among that he would look into the other realm and tell Israel what Syria was saying in their closets he would tell him every battle plan Syria had so the Prophet would go to the king he would say look King serious setup this and they've set up this and they set up this amen now what you're going to do is you're going to go into battle but you don't go the way you would normally go you go this way amen and the seer was revealing that God was present everywhere but God was with and Elijah said differently than he was with Syria and he was revealing what was going on this is amazing to me because the moment that Syria began to notice something was wrong they said who's the spy who's telling all of our secrets who's revealing all of our plans exposing us in this getting us meet a mint so when they decided that it wasn't a spy it was a prophet among the people they meant you watch the entire Syrian army was turned away from the army of Israel and attacked the seer of Israel they found out the seer had more authority than the entire army if you kill the vision of the church you can kill the church but if you can keep that senior alive that seer will see you through every battle every trial and reveal the secrets and look what the seer could do that the camp of Israel couldn't reveal the unseen could they but when Syria decided they kill that they kill that prophet now you watch the devil weird he turned off his attention now against the Sailor right a man a prophet of God and everybody's criticizing that prophet remember watch now here they come to get that prophet Elijah and they're down there maybe just a little cabin that morning they're just cooking and pots and pans and maybe just a little bit in the Syrian army comes and license not moved at all not troubled at all the haze is over about to lose it look at all of them look what's going to happen how we go amen and all the sudden Elijah's not move now there's a reason and last is not shook because Elijah has been stabilized by an unseen world and Elijah actually knew that was more with him than there was in that Syrian army that was coming down the hill and the last ship began to say easy fella there's more with us than there is with him and the man couldn't understand so God amen he did to Elijah and Elijah said Lord opened the boy's eyes that he might be able to see and when his eyes were opened he looked into the hills and saw that the mountains were full of Chariots of Fire now y'all know y'all know what that does for a hillbilly don't you Amen that means the woods were full of them amen they were everywhere behind every tree amen though aim in other words amen devil you're in trouble because there's angels they thought they had Elijah Wood a bullet II but God had the army of Syria where he will a little god it's surrounded them I'll tell you what when they got in there and he said open your eyes and they begin to see the chariots of fires amen now William Branham will help you brother Branham will say to you he says Elisha did not physically see those chariots and Elijah didn't see those angels he said but Elisha had read the scripture and knew that by the word the angels of the Lord in camp about them that fear him then he wasn't announcing angels because he was seeing angels he was announcing angels by the scripture the scripture was more real than what Elijah could see with his natural eyes but he invited Gaza into his vision and said Lord let him see him and the boy's eyes become open and he began to see he began to see that were everywhere now can I can I say this to you Amen I don't find anything in the scripture that said those skills angels done anything I don't find in Scripture now with the Angels actually did anything he meant the only thing that happened when that boy's eyes was opened was it stabilized something in that man Amen that we're in a great battle but there's actually more on our side than there is on that side let me tell you something there's two hundred thousand thousand demons against this pride of Jesus Christ but let me tell you in Hebrews chapter 12 the Bible said we have come to Mount Zion and there is an innumerable company of angels that is with the Church of the Living God I can say to you this morning there is more with us than there is within I'm saying that will you better go back and get more because there's something with the Bride of Christ amen the anointing of the angels of God I'll tell you what when you start realizing you're in the presence of angels it changes everything you'll never study angelology this is going to be a free moment right here everybody knows about demonology what about angelology what about angelology brother Brennan said demonology was fallen angels right fallen angels and those fallen angels amen they actually influence the actions of people they influence if you ever was mad that's an influence if you was ever jealous that's that influence of a fallen spirit it's a demon trying to make you feel like Lucifer felt the day he will he was jealous of God because of his kingdom that's an influencing spirit mad jealous envy strife and people if they're not careful we'll give right away to that spirit amen but the Bible said resists careful and he will get away from you in other words you can resist an angel influence and you can say I'm not gonna be jealous I'm not gonna be mad are you with me you've got a right to resist angel influence Amen but if that be true in the fallen angel what about the angels around the throne of God the only thing they ever done was worship God the only thing they've ever done is praise God and when they fall in a church and start circling the building Amen all the suddenness and influence coming from those angels that make people begin to worship and praise and rather than resisting them we embrace them you reach out you get that angel and pull it into you and say charge me with an anointing charge me with praise if your battery gets low grab an angel charge your anointing God charge me to let the place of God come into me you see what happens in the presence of God mountains begin to melt in the presence of God things begin to change what is it amen amen when praise and worship begins to happen the prophet of God said you're actually bumping bumping into an angel can you imagine when you stood and shouted and you somebody looks at you a little funny I bet you need that you need to get your kids right you need to remember this you just got bumped by an angel in other words something just moved by you and cute you now it's time to praise now it's time to worship the Angels would be worshipping so he's saying to you now it's your right yeah I don't feel but it's right now I don't feel like it boy go ahead and good place go ahead please I don't feel like it that's when you ought to do it the Stars can do it when it's good but moon can do it when it's good but the sons of God will praise God when they're in the lowest place of their life and the dead list of everything he's got at field level you never heard no praise like this I'm the son of the Living God you throw everything your God at me but I'm still here I'm still in the church I'm still praising God I'm still rejoice in God and still serving God don't forgive me but I just feel like preaching I just feel like praising God in such a way than ever devil to feel uncomfortable in this building ever sickness will feel uncomfortable every unbelief every feeling about me it'll feel so uncomfortable in this go and go do you see what's happening is that God intends for you to have joy you're gonna have your seat just a moment God intends for you to have joy you see God is not listening I want you I want you to hear me very clear here God did not send this message to tear you down God did not send this message for your life to be full of sorrow he did not send this message for you to feel like some backslidden person all the time God did not send this message for you to get in the state of legalism where you could never worship and praise and fill any worship or feel any presence or feel any freedom I know what they've done with this message they took the message and beat the people in submission of men's ideas and Nicolette isms and doctrines and it chained the people and handcuffed them amen but I tell you what God still has a true ministry and that ministries are going to with a spirit of liberty and freedom to turn the children loose to worship the way they are designed to worship God now now the Bible tells us this when the Bible says in John 15 and 11 I'm reading the words of Jesus these things I have spoken to you that that my joy might remain in you and that your joy before Jesus said I spoke that you might have joy I might my words I spoke my words that you might have joy you said brother Wayne what does it exactly mean you got to back up in Scripture now and see what Jesus is talking about in John 15 because he's just said I am the vine and year of the branch he's just said that I'm the vine you're the branch and if you abide in and my word abiding you then you'll ask what you will in other words if God had me give any word you couldn't have any joy but because he gave word now you have the Word of God when you don't have anything else you have the promise of God when you have no other reason to rejoice you've got a promise from God that I can rejoice in the darkest hours because I've got the Word of God do you see the word of God is inseparable from God now now this this right here is amazing to me because when Mary was gonna have a child of a virgin amen she was going to be a virgin birth and they told her you're gonna have a child Amen do you know what this is the squirrel immediately brought up the inability of her to have a child right that I don't know how to do this I've not known a man but I want you to hear what the angel said to her and Luke 1 in 37 he said unto her for with God nothing shall be impossible for with God nothing shall be impossible did y'all notice an angel ministered to her when God sends angels to minister the supernatural is about to take place amen every junction of time when something great supernatural was happening God would send angels on the scene do you see what this says for with God nothing shall be impossible amen that's powerful but when you take it to the Greek in a lot your hair for no word from God shall be void of power for no word of God shall be void of power so when Jesus said I gave my word that you might have joy he knew my word is not void of power God cannot give you a word and it's a dead word it's not a dead letter it is impregnated with life and when the word comes into an individual but a life of that word moves into that heart and causes something to happen only inside of them no word of God is formal as void of power so in other words when God sends his word he sends his power amen in the book of Nehemiah it's amazing the book of Nehemiah when they're coming back to the restoration of Israel and they're gonna restore Israel in his place and true worship is about to be restored Nehemiah begins to hold a feast in the seventh month and when he does he finds that a law of the word and he actually comes and opens the word Nehemiah a chapter and the Bible said that when he began to give it he meant that people got an understanding of what he was saying now the people not having the word in such a long time they were so far from what the word was until when they got an understanding of what the word made them to be they begin to cry and become very sorrowful but see God didn't send the word to tell him how far off they were he sent the word to bring them back to a promise to bring see God don't send somebody to tell you how lost you are you already know that he's telling you the word to bring you back to the place where you can have authority and power in the Holy Ghost now I think it's powerful if you go read it I think it's about the tenth verse he meant the ninth and tenth verse but look at what Nehemiah actually says to them he says unto them listen now he says listen this this is a holy day under the Lord your God you more not and you weep not for all the people went when they heard the words of the law and he said unto them go your way eat fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them who know whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy under the Lord neither be you sorry for the joy of the Lord is thy strength for the joy of the Lord is you see what happened when me and my restored the word he restored the joy of the church he was saying don't let the message be sorrowful to you let the message bring joy to you oh it ties with revelations 5 when John sees the Lamb's Book and he sees that word not open and John begin to reach John began to sorrow and cry and weep but when the word was open what did he say hey man don't weep John don't weep charge the line the tribe of Judah had prevailed to take this book and when the book was opened up John began to rejoice and John begin to shout because he saw that the opening of the world amen put Hume in the Lamb's Book of Life and if a man is in the Lamb's Book of Life you cannot impute any sin to that name you cannot add sin to the name of a man who's in the Lamb's Book of Life this message didn't come to tell you you were lost it come to tell you you were the sons of God before the foundations of the world according to the Bible and Joba 38th chapter where were you when the sons of God was shouting for joy this is not a mournful message this is a message of praise it's a message of the Holy Ghost it's a message of power the Bible said when John started shouting they heard him in the heavens and in the earth Wednesday night Timothy text me said brother Wayne we're about to announce that Esther Esther is expecting a baby in 16 years after that I tell you what I was in that meeting that night I sing the the the I sing the agony of that child prayed I've seen her in those prayer lines reaching out to God seeing the disappointment day after day when they announced that she was going to have a baby I texted brother Tim I said did y'all hear me shouting I was in Ohio do you see the manifested word brings a revelation and revival when God fulfills a promise it is done to bring joy into the church it's done to bring praise into the church amen you see that when John saw that word open he begin to realize when you hear the bridegroom's voice it's the end of a certain season and it's the beginning of another season and it brought joy see this message brings joy I just want to say this to you you don't have to manufacture joy yeah you don't have to manufacture joy amen because the Church of the Living God is not here to manufacture nothing but matter of fact we're here amen as the children of the Living God to only produce what's only inside of us amen when you look when you look at the Scriptures of course amen that God is actually brought to the church he's brought to the church to a joy in the darkest do you think about where we are right now we're allowed to see there's never been a darker age in all of the history of mankind I don't have time to preach on the darkness it's too dark brother Branham said this is the best way to say it there was a boy and a girl in the cave and they were way down y'all got that cave right over here don't you that fella when I was in there in that great cavern they turn that's off down there and they said we just want to see how dark it really is and he turn lights off and darkness just covers it now brother Branham uses that example to explain the age you're living in but now notice this in that same season Isaiah said darkness covered the people gross darkness covers the earth he said but watch now at that season you should arise and shine because you're light the word for your praise the word for your joy the word for your life shall arise in that season other words there's been people that worship God in all the ages there's people worship God in partial light they stood in dark times amen all of that listened but there's never been a time like the season we're living in right now and God knew what he was doing when he puts you in the season God actually hand-picked you for the darkest of all of the seasons in humanity you're living in the darkest of all time because you know what he knew about you he knew that you can put this in the darkest of places but you'll never shut her up you'll never catch her off you'll never stop her from worshiping because she knows that her master is on the way you see what he says the rise sign for glide light amen I I tell you when I get to thinking about this I think about what we're facing right now and I think about the seasons and I think about the darkness of loud to see them the troubles that are on every hand and when you start looking at this you say brother Wayne looks like it's getting darker and the prophet of God said if you don't turn to the light he said it'll only get darker and darker as it goes he said but to those who turn onto the light he said it's only going to get brighter and brighter as they go if you turn towards the dark it's going to get darker and darker are you hearing me the darkness will eat you amen death will swallow all your victory but if you turn to the light the light of swallow the darkness the message of the hour will swallow that spirit of nervousness but spirit of depression this message is your victory it's your victory it's just sunshine it's the Holy Ghost coming to the church in the darkest of all seasons he hand-picked you to praise Him David sang this for you in Psalms 30 he said his anger in dearth but for a moment I'll tell you what I couldn't help but to preach this to you his anger in dearth but for a moment can I can I give you a little message here God's not angry with you more than a moment how many y'all got grandkids you got grandkids I've seen guys with grandkids I'm almost a grand Paul now because I'm getting the age of it I'm gonna have some grandchildren soon thank you now everybody's gonna leave say Zach man is expecting I don't have that I don't have that buy pregnancy test yet but I got that buffet we pray for them deadly now let me tell you something else AK said to tell you he said tell brother Ron I'm gonna send him a postcard with our pregnancy test here before too long well we might as well believe it I've got every right to believe it God did it for Esther God did it for Sarah God did it for Hanna God did it for all them women down through that why wouldn't he do it for another child of God his anger is only but for a moment some of you walk around and I know the feeling you think God's mad at you all the time can I give you a newsflash he's not his anger was kindled at the cross his fiery judgment rest upon his son at the cross and he took all of God's anger against sin on that cross amen in his anger if God angers it's only but for a law in other words your life is not a constant God mad at you God's not walking around throwing red lines around you if you cross here I'm gonna I'm gonna your finish buddy and then I hate to say it like this but that's your family that's not God amen that's the people you know in the community that's not God God don't draw all these lines and say well if you if you think this way or you felt that way Amen listen God it's not walking around angry at his bride think about this because the scripture says his anger endureth but for a moment who else could say that David who watched his what's his disobedience bring a plague into his season but it was over in the night god only let it last so long amen notice this his anger and desperate for a moment but watch what David says but his favor is for a life I'm not living in God's anger and once in a while he gives me favor I'm living in his favor my whole life is in his favor if he has to correct me once in a while he's just like a granddad corrected a little kid a mentor her father corrected a child he's not living his whole life angry and upset and I know I have enough critics somebody get a hold at what God's not a great Paul and I agree he has sons but you got to remember those sons are bought by the blood amen and you noticed this because he said his favor is for a life now what's what it says weeping may endure for a night well I'll tell you what when I read that I thought I'd just take off shouting weeping endure for a night in other words think of this now you got a small house and you only got a couple bedrooms and you and your wife's in one of them amen and you in your mom and daddy says hey look I'm coming
