gonna hold to god's unchanging [Music] [Music] unchanging amen i'd like to give a just a quick testimony tonight of something the lord's done for me if i could real quick brother ron spoke about it just a couple weeks ago and it's been something that's been the lord's just been unfolding for a while and for those that are streaming i'll just take it back to december last year me and brother greg working together there at the shops with the railroad and they closed our shop and done away with our job but god come he provided a way quickly gave us a wonderful brother and sister who would speak for us get us a good job and i knew it was of the lord because something like that happened two guys lose a job work together and then they can go and get the same job same shift start the same day working with one another it was just blessing of the lord and i'm so thankful but as i found my brother got to praying because he didn't like that graveyard coming and he testified to me how he got the praying for god to restore his job and god did he brought brother greg back to his job and then sister connie mays got to speaking and telling me what the lord had done for her and she didn't realize how it was speaking to my heart because i at that point done started on graveyard and i i was pretty positive about it i thought i was straight graveyard was going to be all right but that started whooping me i'm going to tell you the truth i think the lord gave a chicken enough sense to go to bed when the sun sets and get up with the sun evidently that's for me too but with greg's testimony and connie's testimony stirred my heart and i said god you're not a respecter of persons and what you do for one you'll do for another and i started calling on the lord and i tell you it didn't look it didn't look very good that there was a chance for me to get back to the railroad and me and greg both having just about the same amount of time even on the railroad together but i got the calling on the lord and i hadn't really said nothing to no one me and jenny only ones known about it and then i mentioned to greg maybe i was thinking about trying to get back to the railroad but it was pretty secret thing i didn't know how it would go but i started praying to the lord and he started moving and and things started taking place and greg said you know there's a position coming up on the cw and it's very difficult to get on the cw no one even knowed how to get on over there it's norfolk southern but it ain't union and they couldn't even tell me they don't know how you hire how you get on over there but it's great hours but it's a difficult way to get in but i know a god that does the impossible i said that would be nice greg texted me back he said why not i said well you're right why not that's our god now you're going to call on him i've heard ask for big things so we started praying about it man jenny and sure enough i got an interview and uh the interview went well we came here and it was on a friday we was moving the chairs in here when we was changing things around i had the interview that day i think it was that saturday that very saturday y'all had a prayer line here but i had to go to work i'd ask jenny i said you know go through the prayer line for our son dylan and pray about this job situation because i was i was worried i wanted to do what the lord's will is you know i might be wanting to get back to the railroad but i wasn't sure if he was wanting me back to the railroad or not because i knew he clearly got me that job at mckee and uh so i just wanted to know from the lord not just ask god i said god you you came to gilead and an angel spoke with gilead and i said you know we don't seek for signs but i said but lord he stood and he talked with an angel and then he asked for a sign and you gave him a sign and he turned and he asked for another sign you gave him another sign i said i just i'm just wanting to know lord because it's important to me i want to be at church when the doors are open i don't want to take a job that's going to take me away from being here and about the only thing i could stand and tell the lord i said lord you know my heart since the day you've opened my eyes if these doors are open i've never put nothing in front of coming here i want to be here it's a hunger in my heart to be here and i thank him for that hunger he put that hunger in me so i told jenny we come i said you go through that line for dylan and and for me in that job situation when you go through the prayer line and with the service unfolded just something spoke to my heart before time for me to get up and leave and i just knew because we'd been doing a lot of praying i said god knows about the job situation i don't know why but i just it was in my heart and i just knew if if it was important to god he was going to let brother ron know i leaned over to jenny before i left i said don't mention the job situation you just pray for dylan go through that line for dylan i didn't tell her about what i felt on my heart to preach and what's going on so i just said let the job situation go so i went on to work and that night about one o'clock when i come out on break i had two texts one from jenny one from brother ron and jenny told me she come through at prayer line she said i went to walk away brother ron grabbed me on the shoulder he said god's got that job situation i was hooked i know then i was getting my answer what i wanted and i was excited and sunday i didn't get to talk to brother on that sunday at church but i gave him time to get home and i shot him a text i got some good news i want to share with him i said you got time i'd like to tell you about the goodness of the lord when he's done for me and he shot me right back he said call me so i called him up and i said brother ron i said i told him how the lord what he had done he said let me let me tell you something he said he gave me the date it's been a while i can't remember the days but the day that he was speaking of was three weeks before i even had an interview with norfolk southern he said i was at an auction and there was a statue a figure of a conductor he said i wasn't even interested in it he said but god spoke to him and told him i was going to be a conductor on the railroad that was three weeks before norfolk southern even knew i was going to be a conductor on the railroad god knew it took me a day after to even gather up that was two signs just like gilead i didn't ask for two but god so cares he gave us to and i love him and i just want to thank the lord tonight for what he's done for me and i got my start date this week so my vacation's almost over it's time to get back to work i thought jenny was going to get a second job but she's going to be all right but thank y'all [Applause] we serve an awesome god don't we an awesome awesome god amen at this time we're going to go to the prayer request we want to continue to pray for brian for the complete healing in his lungs thank you brother randy and sister wanda i want to pray for brother harold shifflet he has a need in his body this evening we also want to continue to

sing for us this evening if she would as she's preparing to come i want to read a couple of announcements here we have changed over to the new church messaging system and i believe several people have asked about this on one of the texts that says there might be data charges whatsoever those data charges are covered by the church so no one would have to pay any of the data charges for those things so there were some questions about that so we want to make sure that that's clear so you'll you'll be receiving text messages from another way than what we've been using because that the messaging system we used before was costing way too much and we could only send an allotted amount of message so we want to let y'all be aware of that we're going to have a much needed day of fellowship and we're all excited about this it's going to be on sunday october the 3rd it's going to be at grand caverns at the large shelter i got another paper that goes here with this and that's going to be at 11 a.m there will be food fellowship games for all and for all that is attending their october gathering please bring a covered dish and a dessert to make sure it's enough to feed your family so we want to be remembering that we need to know who all would be attending by september the 18th so we have enough meats to to prepare there will be pig roast hamburgers and hot dogs for that and so there's a sign up sheet at the the back there for that amen that and again that is on october the 3rd that's a sunday at 11 o'clock so we will not be having service that day but we will be having a a day of fellowship and i believe we're going to have a good time amen together with their families brother gabriel spencer and sister sarah klein request the pleasure of your company at their wedding ceremony on saturday november the 6th at 3 pm if you would like to attend the wedding ceremony there is a sign up sheet on the back counter please write your name and how many of your family will be attending so we have an accurate number of chairs to set up set setup at the venue the ceremony will be outside the address to the venue can be found at the top of the sheet of the sign up sheet please sign up if you plan on attending by sunday october the 17th there will be a private invitation only reception following the ceremony due to covet restrictions and limited space amen let's be remembering that god bless you sister whitney as she sings for us this evening [Music] take me to the king i don't have much to bring my heart is torn in pieces it's my offering take me to the king [Music] truth is

amen amen thank you for sharing those testimonies and really good to be a part of all of that what god is doing he's so personal he knows exactly what your prayers are all about in your situations you said my situation is too small don't you worry no don't you aware he takes care of the sparrows he'll take care of you and you're his children you're the highest form of his creation and so amen and the bride of jesus christ and so we just love him with all of our hearts amen any good to us amen hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1 and 2 and amen we want to just pick up where we left off last sunday i know you remember that whole sermon and so i'm just going to go forward it and we want to speak to you again to this weekend on destin to fulfill and i believe it with all of my heart that the people that we are speaking to now that have an ear to hear that you are destined you're you're on a journey there's nothing the devil can do to stop you you're on a journey and you will fulfill what god's thoughts are about you i'm really glad that sometimes that god knows all those things aren't you amen hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1 amen we're foresee and we're compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses and let me just say i'm glad that i know some of those witnesses that are standing there let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus i don't think we should look any other direction than to jesus looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith i want you to understand even in the scripture he's alpha and omega who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god you may have a need on your heart tonight big or small god knows let's just pray lord jesus we love you with all of our hearts tonight lord we're so thankful to be in your house lord i think about what this place has been and so many so many things have happened here in the supernatural realm one day it will set empty to where that there was a people here that came and worshiped but mysteriously they're gone and lord we're while we're here father may these walls breathe with the holy ghost minister to our hearts our hands have went up tonight father i too have needs i ask you that you administer to us and strengthen us father this afternoon this weekend lord there's many that are that are out lord i ask you that you'd touch their bodies many of them just precaution's sake sinus area the the time of year lord i just ask you that you would touch their bodies and minister to them in a special way we pray in jesus christ's name we ask you amen and amen amen god bless you brother bill god bless you good to see you back with us amen amen to be a survivor of all of that is it's a good thing amen it's a good thing and amen when you come through on that other end of that that thing there's too many people that's passing away with it and uh it's a it's a it's good to have a victor and so amen brother homer longoria lost his son-in-law this week his name was runt or his nickname was runt and that's what we all knew him by real good guy i i loved him and and lost him this week to that then another sister in his church lost him to that so don't don't let your guard down too much and so amen it's a it's a real deal and so amen and and so we we just know those things andrew was sent a text this week and and it meant a lot to andrew and then when he sent it to me it meant a lot to me and i want to just share it with you and uh the author of this wanted to remain anonymous and he said i heard a preacher make a statement that made me think of your dad the other day he said it doesn't cost anything to declare war but it cost a lot to win it got me to thinking it's easy for people to sit in the comfort of their blessings and say they're declaring war against satan but declaring war and waging war are two different things altogether war is bloody war costs lives war leaves scars i'm thankful for soldiers as brother ron and yourself and not only to declare war but will lead by example as we wage war and win by the grace of god i thought that was well written and i was glad to hear those things we'd like for you to remember us this week uh a couple several things are going on this week but we'll we'll be preparing to go to brother kelly hildebrandt's to speak in his convention and and to me this is a dream come true i i just have to be honest with you i never thought i'd ever ever travel to brother kelly's again to to speak a meeting i i thought that you know you just get it in your mind this this part of your life is over and you're just going to kind of just set this out the rest of the way and so as we begin to approach it brother kelly for the last year said i want you to come and cancer rage war and we continue to take our chemo treatments every day morning and then afternoon and every day is different one day your sugar will be 600 all day the next day today i've thought to keep my sugar above 100 so ah just it's just how it is and so and so at any rate we we we wanted to go and we we we wanted to be a part of those meetings and as time would come and covet conditions would be there as well didn't know if they could have the meetings actually they just reinstated their complete ban of their complete uh everybody has to wear a mask there now and so and so we their nation is is headed in that in that direction again and so so as we go and i i just ask you that you would pray for us and uh pray that that we can that we can get through all of the the borders and and do well and uh because this will be the first time that i've traveled across a border with with the chemo that i have to take and all of the drugs i take about 20 different peels a day and uh that is part of the support system to wear that helps me to get through the day i thank god for good doctors i i really do i got something this week from the uh mayo clinic and it was a youtube deal from from them and they were talking about the very disease that i have and the conditions that are matching that's what i what what i have and they have people on the same drugs that what they do and so this was a doctor's conversation and i shared this with brother nathanael earlier this week and anyway they were they were saying that when you first get diagnosed with with the kind of disease that we've got to give you about three months to live and if the medicine can take a holt somewhere somewhere about 50 percent of the people survive for a year and so then that's at stage three but i have stage four and they and it gets about 20 and so then they were going down the line and and mayo clinic hasn't had anyone to live two years in this situation [Music] where we're coming up on is our two year anniversary and and i know you you see me here speaking and never take it for granted and i shared this with my family this week never take it for granted that well that's the way it's always going to be because we're fighting the death enemy and this is not this is not a coal it's a death enemy that we're fighting and so if you would remember us in prayer as we traveled there and so we're just honored to be a part of that meeting we've seen so much supernatural at brother kelly's church we've seen supernatural around the world and been a part of a lot of very special things and we could testify all night long about that but i i would like for you to remember us in prayer that god would give us strength sometimes i struggle with the strength that i need to be able to do what i need to do and so we just we're just thankful that we're able to be a part of that amen glad that brother andrew could be a part of what he was doing this week and so we're just thankful for that looking forward to the fall fellowship i'm looking forward to that i enjoy that day i uh you know we we'll be together and one of these days it's kind of like a type of one of these days we'll all be together in that realm over their fellowshipping together and so we're certainly looking forward to that we'll be we'll be speaking at brother tim pruitt's meeting in october about the first or second week i think it's the 9th of october that that weekend and so if you would pray with us about that that god would be with us next weekend brother danny steeman is going to be here and he is uh he's one of my favorite preachers and so i hate to miss him too and so so we've got brother danny steeman on the agenda we've got brother jason jackson on the agenda that's coming and so amen amongst amongst a couple others that will be sprinkled in there so amen we appreciate these men of god that want to come and help us during this season and so so we just uh not that that we're wanting to take off for any matter amount of anything but we're just appreciative to the help my brother's going to be here one weekend and and so we're just we're just thankful for everything that god is doing for us any good isn't he just wonderful amen i think we can look at this week and just look at it and go we're another week closer to the rapture i sat at today and i just want to have a couple of opening statements before i just go and i i won't try to be too long tonight but i sat today at brother meadows 90th birthday celebration the family gave him his 90th birthday now if 90 looks like that i don't mind making it brother meadows is one of the strongest people that physically that i've ever met in and he might be at a stage now in his life he can't hear thunder maybe there's times he don't remember what he ate for breakfast yesterday but it really don't matter anyway and so and you know as far as not being able to hear there's some things that's not worth listening to so i was with an elderly preacher one time and we were we were together and his wife was being a little mighty and chatty in the back seat and we were he was taking us to eat and she was just biting biting biting and he was just ignoring ignoring annoying and so we got to the bob evans where we were going to eat at and we got he got out and he met me at the front of the car and he just looked at me and he said brother ron there comes a time to when you came here is a great thing hallelujah brother branham speaks a sermon called it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and now he's speaking personal to the congregation that he would be speaking to and brother branham begins to explain kind of like what we went through last week he explains to us that of how that he saw visions and and the vision would carry him to canada or or to a place there in the north country and and he would explain what the 42-inch horned animal would be he didn't know it would be a caribou because most caribou have paddle paneled horns and and then then before he would even get back down to the camp he would kill a silver tip grizzly bear and he would share this vision with the brothers that he would be hunting with and and he would be one place or another and he would share that and as he's standing in the audience this day as he's beginning to preach it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and he begins to lay out how that they were there and how the vision happened exactly like brother biscuit didn't even know that he had that shirt on that checkered shirt green checkered shirt he didn't realize he told his wife not to pack it because it had some holes and she'd pressed it got it ready cleaned it put it in his anyway and and he had fell in the water and would put that shirt on not thinking anything about it he'd put that shirt on and be wearing it that day and and his brother branham is standing over top of the hor over top of the animal there and he turns and brother biscuits got the but got the shirt and then the young man that would be there would be blaine blaine would would just come in surprisingly for the meeting for the for the hunt and blaine was brother sophomore son and so he comes in and when they're measuring the the horns blaine puts his hands to hold the ruler down on the horns and when he measured them it was exactly 42 inches now here was brother biscuit's testimony and i've been with him a bit he said if it had been 42 and a quarter there would have been doubt if it had been 39 and three quarters there would have been doubt in my mind he said but i watched as that that measuring tape was exactly on the line 42 inches and then brother branham explains as they're going back down over the mountain and they're just giving some testimonies and uh he's going down and he he asks brother buddy says he said we can see for a couple of miles here and he said but he said but brother branham he says uh you you said in the vision that that we would get a silver tipped grizzly bear he said i've never seen one he said but you said in the vision we'd get a silver-tipped grizzly bear before we got back to the camp and so brother branham explains to him that he's still jehovah jireh you remember abraham was standing there with his son and his son said we have wood and we have fire but we have no sacrifice abraham knew that he was going to be a type of of god he would lay down his son he would offer his son but he remembered the promise that melchizedek told him that he'd be the father of nations and this would be the child that he would want that he would wait for until his very old age a hundred years old and god would change his body to where he could have that son now if god's asking him to offer him as a sacrifice that god that has changed his body that after all of these years has performed the promise is more than able let me just say it wasn't just he came to the end of his age and now god asked him listen there had been a lot of trials that he had watched god maneuver him through he had watched god speak and perform speak and perform he had watched him change his name changed sarah's name he had watched him walk through the beast of the sacrifice he had watched him over and over when he told him that the uh to separate with him and lot and let lot make his choice let him make his choice and lot made his choice and he stayed back god came and visited abraham after lot made his choice are you with me let me just say abraham did not have a bible to read he didn't have a bible to read all he knowed what he was following the voice of the lord that was in his life it wasn't speaking to sarah it wasn't speaking to eliza it was speaking to abraham are you with me and we trust that voice because we've seen him do it so many times in our life are you with me now brother branham could stand there night after night after night and it would build through his life because he had saw that angel of the lord he had saw the son of man ministry happen so many times regardless of the case regardless of the situation he knew god was more than able whether it was a dead baby in mexico or a blind man in bombay are you with me now no matter the situation he knew god was in control if he spoke it if he spoke it he was more than able to fulfill it [Music] now you and i live in a world today that that proclaims a lot of things but they can't fulfill it they can't meet the expectations it's because anything that's man-made will fail you when jesus stepped into the water to be baptized of john if you remember if you remember even brother branham wondered why jesus had to be baptized like that there were some thoughts and there was a lot of people asking well why did jesus need to be baptized the sacrifice had to be washed it had to be washed and jesus was a supreme sacrifice and jesus would meet his cousin that was the prophet i'm sure that stumbled a lot of people watch just a family thing it wasn't to the world to catch it was just for a select people that were on a destiny and listen when jesus stepped into the water with john and john said i have need to be baptized with thee but it becometh us to fulfill oh righteousness we've got a script that we've got to go by we've got to fulfill this part listen jesus looked at the scriptures of what was prophesied of him and he saw himself in the scriptures of his earthly ministry of what his earthly and you have to you have to divide the two his earthly ministry and that that final ministry i want you to understand jesus knew that he would be here just a small amount of time but he came here to die he came here to redeem he could have had a family he could have produced children on his own he could have had a kingdom but he was a king of it all hallelujah and what a family that he has today i want you to just watch this jesus is standing and these scriptures sometimes just kind of go quickly for us but jesus is standing with his disciples and believers that are there and he's projecting he's projecting past [Music] even present and even projecting what we're doing so some of these scriptures we're going to fulfill we're going to fulfill in john in luke chapter 17 and verse 25 he says but first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation jesus is talking about himself let me just say if you were walking with jesus in his ministry it had been very difficult for you to watch him be beat because in our mortality we do not understand everything and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all and likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all are you with me now let me just say isn't a maybe so this is what happened are you with me and we live in a nation that's it's going to happen it's not a maybe so it's going to happen but god has prepared a message of escape for us are you with me and even though shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed we've had that revealing we've had that for gen for for decades the ministry of the son of man stood to this nation and spoke this week it just it just it just hit me with a thought the only message that brother branham preaches that we have on video to wear that that where we could go back and watch his mannerisms and the way he preached and the way he conducted and the prayer lines and we've got tapes but you can see it with your eye as far as i know it's one of the only ones is is a sermon that is in washington dc of all places in washington dc and he's standing in a in a huge cathedral and there he's preaching and he speaks a sermon called deep calleth to the deep. [Music] and he shows the messiah sign to this generation politicians there men of great renown there they saw the messiah sign god showed this nation the messiah sign he showed it before the full gospel businessman that became a platform to which he could gather denominational groups to come to a place to where they could fellowship together and they would boycott the services i'm getting ready to go to saskatoon the pentecostal and the those movements actually banned their people from going to the meeting rented a huge place and brother brandon spoke to about 300 people but i am understanding that brother gunther was there one of the believers was there god will get his seed this isn't to the mass populous it will never be politically correct but i have to say in what we see in this sodom generation listen if your mind could be straight at all [Music] you could see that it is the bible fulfilled in men and women's lives good marriages good families good children that's what this message produces not a bunch of derelict children or let me get on my soapbox just a minute this doesn't produce a bunch of divorces this doesn't produce a bunch of drug-addicted children this this produces the life of jesus christ [Music] [Applause] the scripture says in revelations chapter 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh john is writing on the isle of patmos to him that overcometh in this generation we're that people overcoming means that you're going to have to wrestle you're going to have to fight to pray you're going to have to fight sometimes to get past yourself the greatest enemy is not your mama your daddy your your president it's not your pastor but we live in such a day to where that people want to reject headship to the point till they they don't they don't want statues in the streets they don't want no kind of headship to tell them what to do they don't want god to tell them what to do they don't want a pastor to tell them what to do they don't want a prophet to tell them what to do but where would we be without god where would we be where would we be without the message of the hour we'd be where we was yes we'd be where we was wrapped up in denominationalism don't know how many gods there was how to baptize no idea about serpency no idea about the book of redemption no idea about seven seals and seven vials and seven trumpets no idea about the deity of jesus christ and that same deity wants to live inside of you this message was not just about william branham it was not just about jesus christ it's also about you hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] god will not come back to get your tape recorders he'll not come back to get your computers he'll come back for that lived out life brother ron i want to just i want to do something for god live i want to be a preacher well live live people a sermon are you with me 99.9 people are not going to be preachers we need people that will live a life not just on saturday sunday but every day of the week to me this message is just living breathing it's not torment to me it's never been torment to me it's life it's the keeping power listen all that i need lays in the seat of god that he put on the inside of me who better to trust with my life than jesus this message does not have to manufacture this is not hollywood we don't have to entertain ourself here this is god living inside of us and just like i prayed this afternoon coming to church i knew that our chairs would be a bit empty because of all that had called in but i will not here to impress people i'm here to impress god i want you to understand we have a god we hear brother branham in in the in the god sermon talk about he thought he was a woodsman and being a woodsman he he thought he could make his way if he would get lost he'd never get lost in his own mind being an indian in his in his life he had a lot of natural instincts that that that'll that allowed him to do certain things you know he talks about walking two different ways i've never figured out what he's talking about there with your legs well actually brother donnie and myself had a conversation about that don't have an idea what brother van was talking about but it worked for him but god had to allow him on his anniversary with his new wife taking her up in the mountains allow the fog to settle in to such a point until william marion branham couldn't find his way way back to the camp now let me just say in your natural life there's no accidents with god god guides your life and he took you as as as as ownership of you to as a prisoner and he'll watch over your life he opens doors and he closes doors say it a whole lot with without stopping there but let me just say this to you god knew that william branham needed to realize that he needed god to be his god [Music] listen let me just say this you this wasn't just for brother branham can i just say it and be real clear this wasn't just for brother brown this wasn't just a good story that brother branham is stumbling around and he's walking on an indian death walk and he knows that his wife is going to be up there and freeze to death if he don't get back to her and he's getting more desperate and more desperate it's not just about wigan brown you're going to have a path of life and there's going to be spots that you're going to walk on an indian death walk and you're going to walk in a circle and you're going to make choices let me just say making a bad choice every one of us is made up but if we can have god to help us with our next choice and we can ask forgiveness of our sins forgiveness of our mistake get up and walk straight it's not we can't redo anything that we did yesterday even today but it's your future is what we're concerned about [Applause] it's your future god cares about your future god cares about your situations he deeply cares brother ron but i get my heart broken so many times god got his heart broke brother branham felt rejection david felt rejection you're going to feel it but god will help you get through it we need a god god provided for you that you'd have a pastor well brother ron i only listened to tapes brother brandon was my my pastor a man told me one time said well brother bran is my pastor and i said i just listened to tapes and i said when's the last time you listened to jezebel religion he said well why do you ask and i said well see how your wife's dressed see if you're just listening to tapes that are uncomfortable to you there's a lot of times you'd like to put on the comfort level with me but you see god guides our our sermons he guides our thoughts right to your household to give you strength he gave you a god called pastor to see you through a shepherd that would feed you bride material that would get you ready for the rapture hallelujah pray for your pastor pray for strength pray for god to give us direction you need a man that can't be bought we had a prophet that was offered a million dollar check already put it is just needed to know where to put it in the account it was already written out brother biscuit confesses i saw the check let me just say this to you brother branham kind of made a choice and did a lot of things with that but he did not want to be owed by no man are you with me so a god in our life will not only give us things that we need but it'll also prevent us from doing things that we shouldn't do brother man confess this what would i do with a million dollars i i don't even know how to act with that kind of money you see brother branham was a kind of man that could could be with dignitaries and still be the same but he could also go to brother george wright's house where hattie wright was at and and there they were pulpers and brother branham actually kept him alive by taking food to him and he could be comfortable with them he could be comfortable with the indians he could be comfortable in all kinds of levels but he could also stand in the hall of washington and speak a sermon called deep calleth to the deep i've taken you on a little tour there the guide was more than just in the woods but god guided him when a million dollars was offered then he he had to be molded to the place that he could trust him with the church ages and the seven seals he could gather up all the loose ends from all of the preachers all down through the ages many of them preaching phenomenal truths but didn't know what to do with it and you ask well well feni preached that or or larkin preached that but let me just say many of them discovered truths but they were kind of like benjamin franklin that discovered electricity he got it but now what do i do with it a man named addison came along and he brought that electricity thank god he brought that electricity down to where that we could use it and we turn on the lights men had truth all down through the ages but they didn't know what to do with it martin luther the just shall live by faith but we come to the seals and brother branham would say the justification was this though you never did it in the first place for martin luther that was getting him away from a powerful catholic church with its dictatorship and rulership but there could be christians that could live by the faith of the truth of the gospel and they could have a bible in their own language in their own home it wasn't just for a pope it wasn't just for priests this bible that you carried in tonight has cost men their lives [Applause] don't ever take it for granted matthew 25 and verse 1. now here's jesus speaking now he's going to speak of you again then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom where do you get rapture in the scripture right here's a good spot five of them were wise five of them were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no all with them that's the holy ghost the all is the holy ghost the holy ghost is the seal the guide the seal on your life that god has a that god has placed you he's you're worthy of the journey you're the temple to where god wants to live in for those that may be sitting here tonight that don't have that holy ghost living in your life don't stop praying for it don't come to a spot where you sit in a pew and just become satisfied you make sure that you pray and pray and pray and let me just say if you've got it you still pray for more of it there's not a day i don't pray for more of the life of jesus christ to live on the inside of me if not we become stagnant backslidden christians resting on our laurels and become complacent and it becomes commonplace to come to church sit down and be entertained we want a fervent desire in our hearts [Applause] a perfect desire a passion to serve god like never before may our campfires may our lamp burn trim the drops off of your life trim the dead parts off of your life let the holy ghost live let it live like never before inside of our lives hallelujah you don't want me to be honest many times congregations don't want me to be honest i see too many people that start getting great-headed and getting backslidded at the same time because they become complacent they feel like it's just they're entitled to it you've got to fight every day of this journey you've got to press your way don't take a day off [Applause] press we're destined to fulfill i think sometimes we need to shake ourselves a little bit we just shake ourselves a little bit god's among us and i'm afraid too many times if i could i could grab you spiritually i'm pastored now tonight if i could spiritually grab you and say wake up wake up the bride's revival is on and you point me back to some 50 years ago or a hundred years ago a revival listen that don't mean anything today what about what's going on now brother um but let me tell you about my tomatoes i'm not interested in your demands i'm not actually interested or potatoes i i'm not interested in the word this world's deal i am interested when i come here if you'll notice i don't have a bunch of singing groups come here we don't have a bunch of concerts coming here the bride has the best singers in the world there's no need in entertaining herself with laodicea we've got phenomenal singers but we've got some of the greatest preaching that's ever been standing in shoe level and i'm not talking about myself but god has given this bride the greatest men standing in human flesh we are without excuse [Music] that goes for the people on the internet sitting eating popcorn drinking a pepsi get up go to church i have people all the time tell me well we're tuning in we're watching you every service it's just wonderful get up you live in this local area get up put some clothes on come here feel what we feel [Applause] we're not careful we'll come to a spot even with the message it'll be an entertainment it'll be no more than i love susie and andy griffith had some incredible morals it was a wonderful show but there's no eternal life in that there's things that all of us like but there's no eternal life in it don't put nothing ahead of god because we're destined to fulfill i'm going to use this in the morning and i may come back to it in the morning is it all right if i say it twice there's a rich young ruler who came to jesus and he had performed it it performed the law to the letter all of his life all of his life he was diligent he was committed but he still likes something in brother branham's last sermon he addresses this rich young ruler again and he explains that jesus loved him he explains that this boy there was something drawing on him to come to the right spot to come to the leader to come to the messiah something brought him to that spot and jesus loved him and when jesus looked at him he saw something that he lacked and he told him he said go sell all you have and give it to the poor that don't mean millionaires today have to do that but he gives you responsibility of what to do with it but here was a rich young ruler that he turned away sorrowful because he couldn't make that step jesus asked him too much you know god wouldn't do that without without having an example before him that did forsake it all maybe you've never put this together but there was another rich young ruler that looked out our window and realized that those people that were out there were god's kids and he was one of them and he realized that he was a part of them his bloodline was not egypt but it was the children of israel and he realized i'm identified with that children of israel that's where the covenant is oh hallelujah let me preach this and just end it here tonight let me just say this to you if you can look where your origin comes from i came from god and i'm going back to god i don't want nothing nothing to keep me from my destiny [Applause] he forsook riches moses rolls off of our tongue but you don't know the cost of that ministry how many people waited on him daily took care of his every need and he said i don't need that no more i'm willing to live like a vagabond [Music] he forsake fame he forsook power because he wasn't ashamed of god there's not a doubt in this mind our minds today are where moses's destiny is so there's two rich young rulers one made a phenomenal incredible decision and what did it result in the saving of an entire generation of israel that had been slaves but god had to send him through 40 years in a desert to get him ready to be a prophet what did the results of the decision of the rich young ruler all we know is is jesus has another story that he tells a rich man in hell nobody could tell that like brother homer brother homer one day we were in walmart we picked up milk we were walking back by the freezer counter brother homer when you were with him at any moment you could get a sermon and he turned at the freezer counter and he turned around to me and he said just think about that rich man in hell he said the man that owns walmart he said he owns walmarts all across america but what will that mean in hell he had an opportunity with jesus but now after he goes to hell he becomes religious he becomes religious brother jason's going to get married here in a few weeks [Music] and and he'll understand why i'm saying these things so many people in jail get religious is that right they get religious have church do all phenomenal things they become religious immediately and it's easy to live in the confines of a system that keeps you well what makes brother jason's story is this okay makes your destiny different are you with me now is he has identified himself and he was writing me letters about a year before getting out i realized where i'm at i've got all those letters and i would respond back and i'd send him pages of brother brandon's books didn't know what i could do and here he comes to church listen we're not even concerned with this past [Applause] let me just say i've been guarded by deacons that were a whole lot worse than him go to places and men that were one time in the hills angels is now a deacon i feel pretty safe with those guys what made the difference god got a hold of their lives [Applause] what made the difference with me god got a hold of my life and i saw where i came from and i made a mess of my life and that mess of my life one day god who was rich in mercy reach down and pick me up i didn't have to stay that way you're talking about a god of second chances brother meadows right here god was dealing with him he was at a point of suicide as a young man with a family god was on his trail he was on his trail let me just say when you've got god on your trail it tells you that there's a seed inside of you that he's after don't you take that for granted if god's dealing with you don't wait don't circuit don't don't turn away from it he don't have to do it over and over again you feel the presence of god in this building or in the internet wherever you're at you feel the presence of god you worship you take that moment to worship it may be the only time in your life that he comes by that way i cannot imagine in the scriptures where it says demas has forsaken me a man that had walked with paul a man that had walked with him saw the miracles saw the ministry saw it turned from jew to gentile saw the phenomenal things but because of popularity his prophet was in a prison but he couldn't see past the temporary thing paul was an eternal being i got a note some time back said your cancer staggers me and you've got your you've got your goal on the wrong thing as a minister of the gospel whatever god laid on god lays on our lives we just fight our way through it it's cancered you just fight your way through it i will not let cancer define me i'll not let cancer define me let me just lay a couple things out i don't get up every morning go oh i got cancer let me just say this you i never think about that situation i get up i go take my pills i do it in the name of the lord jesus christ they do their job i'm going to do my job i don't whine i don't cry i don't need your pity i am a warrior and warriors know what their destiny is fight don't give me your pity don't give me your whining fight man call me this week he may be watching this may be just a good kick in the rear rear end for him [Applause] i just need more of jesus myself he spent 10 minutes whining to me about a joint how bad it was and how debilitating it was prayed with him wished him well hung up the phone and i told sister connie i said sister connie do you know what that man just did i answered the phone that was a good fortune for him best way for you to get a hold of me is text i'm a good responder with text but there are some days i just don't want to hear the mully grubs i said you know what that man just did he called a preacher that has brain cancer and lung cancer to whine about his joints some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow some of you get it next week i was sitting in an office of a church one time and a brother come in and he just burned his thumb he walked in and he spoke for about five minutes on burning his thumb and how bad did that hurt and he looked and i was the speaker and it hit him and he turned around walked right back out i don't know what kind of an example i i'm going to be but i want to be an example that though god slay me yet i'm going to trust him as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord [Applause] i hope that's not too much for you though but i hope that was all right it's the truth anyway it's the truth anyway brother branham addresses marilyn monroe i'm getting i'm getting real close to my end which would be my beginning in the morning miss monroe i think was her stage name whatever it was her name was something else she had died and they said that she had committed suicide now don't it don't make any difference how much i'd say it they're still going to say that she committed suicide but i want you to notice these words but the child did not she died in a heart attack and if you'd watch she had her hand trying to get to the phone the phone in her hand she had a heart attack they said sleeping peels was there she had been taking them for a month or more out of a bottle she died in a heart attack and she died about four or five seconds before four o'clock exactly who will i trust science or a prophet i want to i'm bringing this up because i want you to realize god's not just in control of our lives he's in control of others and i read her life story in a magazine how that she was an illegitimate child and how that she had washed so many dishes and her mother in an insane institution and she had longed while she was the most perfect bodied woman i guess in the world but she'd long for somebody that money wouldn't buy now watch these words oh i wish i could have got to her i know what she needed i want you to think on that real close i wish i could have got to her i i know what she needed she was a girlfriend of sports stars husband a a wife to sports stars movie stars a girlfriend of presidents and vice presidents sin doesn't have a bottom to it let me just say i know what i'm doing here let me just say here if sin is pulling in your life for the wrong kind of friends and the wrong kind of relationships sin don't have a body pornography don't have a bottom line you don't have a bottom to it it don't have a bottom and and and you you start out looking at somebody else's wife on a pornography site that's what you're doing and it don't have a bottom and before long it's movies and before long you're at the wrong places maybe trying to get your wife to do certain things let me just say sin don't have a bottom it will destroy your life this is not wine but a touch of wine will just get you started and then you're drinking more of it and then more of it maybe it's social oh but brother honest for my belly's sake really really and then it's another before long it's narcotics hey listen i said i said in too many very difficult doctor's appointments listening to people begging for more narcotics my doctors wanting to offer me all kind i don't need them i don't i don't wanna i don't wanna well you should be having pain you know how many people would take that i want to be clear in my mind when god speaks to me i want to be clear in my mind when i study it's enough chemo fog that i have to fight my way through i don't want some temporary fix i don't want something to cover up my pain i'm going here with you now let me just say there's not enough booze in the world to cover up your pain forever there's not enough drugs in the world to cover up your pain forever brother ron but you just don't know what i'm going through you've never had it worse than jesus did you've never had it worse than job do it so look at the devil and tell him devil leave me alone get out of my mind this woman this beautiful woman that hangs as pinups around the world and i've been around the world and saw her hanging men still lasting for her and a prophet of god would bring her up the most beautiful woman most beautiful bodied woman if i could have got to her i know what she needed what about you friend maybe you're not sitting in this building today but what about you god knows what you need well i'm going to move and i'll fix it let me just say if you don't get fixed here moving won't fix you hey [Applause] i'm gonna marry a man and it's going to fix my let me just say if you're not complete within yourself with jesus marrying a man that's uncommitted to jesus you'll never fix him because you couldn't fix yourself jesus knows what you need jesus talked more about hell than he talked about heaven i don't know if you've read that much of it but jesus talks more about hell then he talks about heaven a lot of people want to spiritualize that today that said this is this is the only hell that you'll ever be in there's too many people that's died that was lost that the testimony was their last breath said one one great leader i'm not gonna call his name but said i never believed in hell until now and they've come to get me when i take my last breath i want it to be a friendly place don't waste your life for ashes what will i be when i grow up i was six years old and i drawed from mrs earls that i was going to be an astronaut she didn't understand it but i drawn a picture it was black all over the page i spent the whole hour in class drawing blackness in the middle of it i drawed a little white light and that was me i never told you they'd have a connie and she asked me she said what is that i said i'm an astronaut you see i'd heard in a sermon that the world is black but god put a place inside of me about the size of a button and that button that size of that button had power to create a world and i could go live a life on it i'm 60 years old and i didn't have to wait till i was 60 to believe this message i was six years old and believed it with all my heart i made a lot of bad decisions between 6 and 23. but god was so rich in mercy that my destiny never changed [Applause] you see i have been discerning as the service went on today we didn't have a prayer line but you had a discernment line and some of you are worried about what's going to happen next week next month next year what am i going to do with my life what's what's going to happen in my situation you know it don't matter what the doctor diagnosis i'm going to go wednesday and dr gone could give me the worst report i've ever had i'm not expecting that but it's not going to shape me on thursday i'm going to get on a plane and go preach the unreachable the unsearchable riches of jesus christ with the same faith i stand here tonight with regardless of what the report says are you with me don't let temporary things cloud over eternal matters but my car my home the economic situation uh the the president let me just say you can't fix none of that you can't fix none of that you can stand and put signs walk up and down the streets with signs you can't fix that that's this world i'm concerned about another world this world is not my home i'm just passing through abraham was in a very nomad type situation didn't really have a home just moving as the tent moved god moved him but he was citizen of another kingdom he had met the king and one day he met him when he met him he changed his life and that change produced a child then that child produced another child and then that child produced 12 tribes and moses as a prophet of god a rich young ruler that rich young ruler said i'll take the way with the despised few i realized a long time ago i might be the only one in my family i might be the only one in my job situation i might be the only one in my school i might be the only one in the state but i'm going to keep my eyes on jesus that's what i want to keep my eyes on i hope part one was okay here there's a song said i'll stand for jesus and let the world go by sister cassie won't you come amen amen brother jason sister is it melissa yeah if i call it wrong you just forgive me i'd like for you guys to come i i won't be there to do your wedding but i want to i want to pray for you maybe the different way to end a service but i want to pray for this couple i watch her as she listens to me preach when she first came she was kind of set like a mannequin almost scared of me i think [Music] and i've watched how you responded to the word the word changes our lives i'm so proud of you i'm so proud of you you see god don't need to know history he knows all of that but he said i'll take care of your future if you put my she'll take me by the hand you remember he he asked peter he says don't you come walk with me sometimes in walking with jesus it's a little little dangerous because walking with jesus you got gotta get out of a boat leave the security leave what you know and step on the water and as long as he had his eyes on jesus everything worked out really well but
