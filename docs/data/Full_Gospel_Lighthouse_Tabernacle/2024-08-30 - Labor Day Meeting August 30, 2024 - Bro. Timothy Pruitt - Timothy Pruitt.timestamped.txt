[39:21] be be made for the Church of the Living
[39:23] God he said forgive us of our sins as we
[39:26] forgive those who sin against us and we
[39:29] pray that you will all together gather
[39:31] us tonight under the wings of his
[39:33] abiding presence as a hen gathers her
[39:36] chicks may we be gathered this night and
[39:39] may the Holy Spirit visit us with great
[39:41] power for we ask it in Christ's name
[39:45] amen I pray that in these meetings this
[39:48] weekend that your expectations whatever
[39:50] they may be I pray that they get met in
[39:53] every single possible way no matter what
[39:55] it is I want to ask you question how big
[39:58] would you ask if you knew you couldn't
[40:01] fail how big of a healing how big of a
[40:04] miracle how big of a change in your life
[40:06] how big would you ask if you knew you
[40:08] couldn't fail I happen to believe that
[40:10] you're the Church of the Living God
[40:12] you're the most powerful people on the
[40:14] face of the Earth and God ordained you
[40:16] for this time I don't believe there's
[40:17] anything too hard for the children of
[40:20] God again our Prophet would say now we
[40:23] we got two more he said we got two more
[40:25] great nights Friday and Saturday night
[40:27] and we're expecting our Lord to do great
[40:28] things in these nights and we just don't
[40:31] know what lays ahead yet tonight I like
[40:33] that because you can be expecting just
[40:36] anything to happen we don't know just
[40:38] what time that God might just come into
[40:40] here and give us another
[40:45] Pentecost we don't know we don't know
[40:48] just what time that God might just come
[40:50] into here and give us another Pentecost
[40:54] that's what we need and I would be so
[40:56] happy to be right in here with you to
[40:58] enjoy the fellowship and the freshness
[41:00] of the Holy Spirit and I tell you our
[41:03] land really needs that and I say if a
[41:06] prophet was saying that in 1959 I'd say
[41:09] it's the same thing today that's what
[41:11] our land needs is another Pentecost I
[41:14] say in this meetings we want you to have
[41:16] your Liberty and accept the word of God
[41:18] in all of its fullness and its truth we
[41:20] want you to experience the Holy Ghost we
[41:22] want you to get so filled on the Holy
[41:25] Spirit if you want to clap your hands
[41:27] with give you Liberty to clap your hands
[41:29] if you want to stand up and amen the
[41:31] word of God you just go ahead and stand
[41:33] up and amen the word of God if you want
[41:35] to shout then you just go ahead and
[41:37] shout if you want to dance just go ahead
[41:39] and dance we say brother Andrew we don't
[41:42] do that in our church just look around
[41:44] you're not in your
[41:46] church but what I want you to do most in
[41:48] this weekend this meeting I want you to
[41:51] amen the word of God because when you
[41:53] begin to amen the word of God it
[41:55] releases a supernatural it doesn't
[41:57] matter how emotional you get but when
[41:58] you be get get behind the word of God
[42:00] and amen the word of God what the
[42:03] preacher's putting out there the
[42:04] supernatural begins to get released I is
[42:07] something powerful that transpires when
[42:09] a man of God gets anointed and begins to
[42:11] preach the anointed word of the hour and
[42:13] Believers begin to pull on it and say
[42:15] Amen to it that it recognizes all of
[42:18] Heaven recognizes that there's a pull in
[42:20] this hour I say this unto you tonight
[42:23] don't waste your time this weekend move
[42:26] right on into the
[42:28] Supernatural

[43:04] sometimes in an auditorium it's not the
[43:06] setting that you're typically used to

[51:30] in the day that we're living in amen
[51:33] amen let's turn to First Kings 17 and
[51:35] verse
[51:37] 1 it said and Elijah the tishbite who
[51:41] was of the inhabitants of Gilead said
[51:43] unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel
[51:46] liveth before before whom I stand there
[51:49] shall not be do nor rain these years but
[51:52] according to my word and the word of the
[51:55] Lord came un him saying get thee hence
[51:58] and turn thee Eastward and hide thyself
[52:00] by the Brook cherith that is before
[52:02] Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt
[52:05] drink of the brook and I've commanded
[52:06] the Ravens to feed thee there so he went
[52:09] and did according unto the word of the
[52:11] Lord for he went and dwelt by the book
[52:14] Brook cherith that was before Jordan and
[52:17] the Ravens brought him bread and flesh
[52:20] in the morning and bread and flesh in
[52:22] the evening and he drank of the brook
[52:25] and it came to pass after a while that
[52:27] the brook dried up because there had
[52:29] been no rain in the land and the word of
[52:32] the Lord came unto him saying arise get
[52:34] thee to zerath which belongeth to zidon
[52:38] zidon and dwell there behold I have
[52:41] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[52:43] thee so he rose and went to zerath and
[52:46] there he came to the gate of the city
[52:49] behold the widow woman was there
[52:51] Gathering of sticks and he called her
[52:53] and said fetch me I pray thee a little
[52:55] water in a vessel
[52:57] that I may drink and as she was going to
[52:59] fetch it he called her and said bring me
[53:02] I pray thee a morel of bread in thine
[53:04] hand and she said as the Lord thy God
[53:07] liveth I have not a cake but a handful
[53:09] of meal and a barrel and a little oil
[53:12] and a cruise behold I'm gathering two
[53:14] sticks that I may go in and dress it for
[53:17] me and my son that we may eat and die
[53:21] and Elijah said unto her fear not go and
[53:24] do as thou has said but make me their of
[53:26] a little cake first bring it unto me and
[53:29] after make of thee for thy son for thus
[53:33] sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel
[53:35] of meal shall not waste neither shall
[53:37] the crws of oil fail unto the day that
[53:40] the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and
[53:43] she went and did according to the saying
[53:45] of Elijah and she and he and her house
[53:49] did eat many days and the barrel of meal
[53:52] wasted not neither did the Cru of oil
[53:54] fail according to the word word of the
[53:56] Lord which he spake by Elijah amen we
[54:00] let you be
[54:08] seated like to speak to you tonight on
[54:11] certain in uncertain
[54:14] times excuse me certain in in uncertain
[54:18] times certain as we know the word is
[54:21] known is it means known for sure or
[54:24] established Beyond doubt
[54:26] and the opposite is uncertain which not
[54:29] is not able to be relied on or not known
[54:32] or definite you know we're living in an
[54:35] uncertain time it's an uncertain time
[54:37] for the world but we're living in a
[54:40] certain time for a certain people of
[54:43] God and why we can be certain is because
[54:46] we've heard a certain sound amen it's
[54:49] the Gospel of Jesus Christ the word of
[54:52] God for this day amen I believe I
[54:55] believe we're living in the fulfillment
[54:57] of Prophecy thank you I believe we're
[54:59] living in a time that what can be shaken
[55:02] will be shaken Amen brother Bram would
[55:04] say it like this he said don't be
[55:06] discouraged he said we're living in a
[55:08] terrible time but it's a terrible time
[55:10] for the unbeliever but a wonderful hour
[55:13] for the
[55:14] believer amen for we're nearing the end
[55:17] time to which we're looking for the
[55:18] coming of our blessed Lord that's why
[55:21] we're here but we're living in time in a
[55:23] time of shaking he says things in in the
[55:26] in the trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[55:27] he says things of the earth is shaken
[55:30] you can't put confidence in anything
[55:32] everything's uncertain and anything
[55:34] that's uncertain I would just rather
[55:36] stay away from it or leave away from it
[55:39] he said home life has become uncertain
[55:41] National Life is uncertain and the world
[55:43] is uncertain now this is 63 what are we
[55:46] in today amen we're just living in a
[55:48] place to where the whole world is having
[55:51] a nervous prostration looks like shaking
[55:54] all over every nation everybody one
[55:56] afraid of the other one they talk of
[55:59] Peace he said one time oh we fight the
[56:01] first world war and all our boys go over
[56:03] there that'll settle all wars he said it
[56:05] wasn't too long and then it fell apart
[56:06] and here we were in another world war he
[56:08] said everything is shaking political
[56:11] life is shaking National Life is shaking
[56:13] everything is shook up he said even
[56:16] Church life has shook up and uncertain
[56:18] amen the people don't even know hardly
[56:20] what to do you know I was actually
[56:22] looking at this and just this week an
[56:24] article come out uh was said many many
[56:27] parents would probably say raising CH
[56:29] children isn't easy he said now the US
[56:32] Surgeon General is agreeing with them
[56:35] the Surgeon General this week released
[56:37] an ad advisory to parents regarding the
[56:40] effect of raising children that might be
[56:43] having on their mental health he said
[56:45] aside from the act of raising and caring
[56:47] for children many parents are even more
[56:50] succeptible to the stressors of concerns
[56:52] that are economic and societal than
[56:54] those without kids so even the Eternal
[56:58] attorney general is putting out warnings
[57:00] you know because people are becoming so
[57:03] stressed out they're becoming so worried
[57:05] and they they ought to be worried
[57:07] because we're living in a world that's
[57:09] headed toward destruction amen the world
[57:12] that we live in is uncertain the
[57:14] government's uncertain listen it doesn't
[57:16] matter who they put in the uh in the
[57:18] white house it's still going to be
[57:20] uncertain amen life is uncertain people
[57:23] are grasping at ideas or whatever to
[57:25] prop themselves up why because of
[57:28] uncertainties no one knows what next no
[57:30] one knows what the next day hold even
[57:32] the best of times of Life are uncertain
[57:36] amen we don't know when our last times
[57:38] together are here upon this Earth amen
[57:40] even these meetings are uncertain we
[57:42] don't know if we'll have another one
[57:43] amen just go back to co you know how
[57:45] quick that shut down amen we don't know
[57:47] if we would what we hold dear today will
[57:50] be gone tomorrow things are uncertain
[57:53] and brother R would say it like this he
[57:54] said each age has his pressures for
[57:57] example he said a great burden of the
[58:00] last age is the pressure of riches of
[58:02] soft living of nervous tensions in a
[58:05] complex age that we seem unfit to live
[58:07] in he said I preach to more tired people
[58:10] another place I preach to more tired
[58:12] people than anybody in the world people
[58:14] are so tired they're so mentally
[58:16] strained until they fill in the insane
[58:19] institutions in the hospitals they went
[58:21] in such nervous condition that they
[58:23] don't know what they believe and they
[58:25] don't know what what they want anymore
[58:27] they're just laying there they don't
[58:29] know what to do it's such a sad
[58:32] spot amen he says you but listen brother
[58:35] you can't drink it off you can't shout
[58:37] it off you can't play Cloud cards you
[58:40] can't take a thousand csas and try to
[58:43] sleep it off amen you you can't do it
[58:45] all of our little remedies only thing it
[58:48] does is help symptoms we got to have a
[58:50] cure for the
[58:53] disease amen all the all the symptoms is
[58:56] there he says the Cure is the blood of
[58:59] Jesus
[59:01] Christ amen not take a rest at the
[59:04] seashore not get an Anthem of choir to
[59:07] sing songs it's what we're trying to do
[59:09] today sing it off oh we got to make
[59:11] ourselves like this one or do that we're
[59:13] trying to do something different trying
[59:14] to educate it out there's only one way
[59:16] to do it face the facts if you're upset
[59:20] and you're frustrated come to Jesus
[59:24] Christ amen come to him he is the only
[59:28] thing that is
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:34] certain he was saying the trumpet gives
[59:36] an uncertain sound he said you're
[59:38] painting an awful picture there dark
[59:40] picture he said I intend to do that he
[59:42] said I did it for a purpose that I might
[59:45] say this is there anything
[59:48] certain
[59:51] yes there's one thing that is certain
[59:54] I'm so glad of that there's one one
[59:56] thing we can put our confidence and be
[59:58] sure that it's right when everything is
[1:00:00] gone and everything is shaking there
[1:00:03] will be something still
[1:00:06] standing heavens and earth will pass
[1:00:08] away but my word will never
[1:00:14] fail certain and uncertain times there's
[1:00:18] only one thing we can do is place our
[1:00:20] confidence in the word of God what he
[1:00:23] said will come to pass
[1:00:27] amen our money is not certain our homes
[1:00:29] and lands are not certain nothing
[1:00:31] Earthly or temporary is
[1:00:35] certain he'd continue on he said we need
[1:00:37] today is not a lot of material things we
[1:00:40] have that we don't need maybe greater
[1:00:42] churches or greater congregations we
[1:00:44] don't need more on the radio or
[1:00:45] television we don't need so many more of
[1:00:47] these things but what we need today is
[1:00:49] to be
[1:00:51] spiritual Amen to be spiritual is a
[1:00:54] person that is with willing to Humble
[1:00:56] themselves before God if they ain't got
[1:00:59] a penny they'll pray till that Spirit
[1:01:01] within them is satisfied with the
[1:01:03] goodness of God and Revival that take
[1:01:06] place inside their heart that'll change
[1:01:08] their
[1:01:10] attitude it'll change their attitude and
[1:01:13] the atmosphere that they're living
[1:01:16] in you know your attitude affects your
[1:01:21] altitude amen that's what they talk
[1:01:23] about I'm not a pilot but I I've read
[1:01:25] about it was I studying some things amen
[1:01:27] the pilots talk about they adjust the

[1:04:39] brother brandom you know was in Canada

[1:04:42] was walking down the street and there
[1:04:44] was a man selling
[1:04:45] televisions he said I'd like to sell you
[1:04:47] a set fell brother said I'm just a
[1:04:50] tourist he said I see you just passing
[1:04:52] through he said well actually here to
[1:04:54] have a service couple of Serv Services
[1:04:56] he said well you wouldn't happen to be
[1:04:57] around this brandom outfit would you yes
[1:05:00] I would said yes sir I am he said well
[1:05:04] what do you think about that fell could
[1:05:05] you imagine oh I think the services are
[1:05:08] fine I said was you there last night
[1:05:11] said yes I was well what did you think
[1:05:13] about the man getting off the cot and
[1:05:15] soldier that his name got called and
[1:05:17] told him who he was and how he'd been
[1:05:18] afflicted for years he said oh I don't
[1:05:21] think nothing about that cuz I had to it
[1:05:23] had to be proved he said that hypnotism
[1:05:25] doesn't go with
[1:05:27] me and he said you know my old southern
[1:05:29] mamy you know had had an expression give
[1:05:31] a cow enough rope it'll hang
[1:05:34] itself he said anything that cannot be
[1:05:37] scientifically proven when I think
[1:05:38] there's nothing to it I said well I
[1:05:40] don't be like to be different but I have
[1:05:41] to be now he said that the things that
[1:05:44] can be scientifically proven is not real
[1:05:46] it's only the things that's not
[1:05:47] scientifically proven that's real he
[1:05:49] said that's ridiculous I said all right
[1:05:51] I want you to ask you something could
[1:05:53] you tell me what love is
[1:05:56] could you go down to the drugstore and
[1:05:58] buy me a quarter's worth of love you
[1:06:02] can't see it it's unseen show me what
[1:06:04] life
[1:06:05] is I I I need a little more life could
[1:06:07] you buy me a quarter's worth of more
[1:06:11] life he said what was it he said these
[1:06:14] things are temporal and perishable but
[1:06:16] if we can we put so much emphasis on
[1:06:19] that he said so much concerned about the
[1:06:22] natural things and so little about the
[1:06:25] spiritual
[1:06:27] things he said for I said for instance
[1:06:29] coming through this room right now is a
[1:06:31] television picture you have to show me
[1:06:33] the picture or I won't believe it's what
[1:06:35] he's telling this guy he said of course
[1:06:37] it hits the crystal goes on down the
[1:06:38] tubes it shows a picture here and I said
[1:06:40] well that man's in the United States
[1:06:42] you're picking him up way down there
[1:06:43] it's coming through the air he said but
[1:06:45] we can prove it because he's a picture
[1:06:47] showing that it's here I said yes and we
[1:06:50] can prove ours
[1:06:54] too for in glory we got a Risen Savior
[1:06:58] and he's sending forth the holy spirit
[1:07:01] is here to reveal it and make it
[1:07:03] positive therefore we got a sending
[1:07:05] station and a receiving
[1:07:08] station that's correct God in heaven who
[1:07:10] knows all things can so put a gift in
[1:07:13] his church and he can magnify it and
[1:07:15] reflect himself through it and say
[1:07:17] things which is absolutely impossible to
[1:07:19] be proved by
[1:07:21] science but we don't walk by what we see
[1:07:25] we walk by things we don't do not
[1:07:30] see like Noah before there was one drop
[1:07:33] of rain ever fell from the heavens he
[1:07:36] started building an ark why did he do
[1:07:39] that cuz God told him
[1:07:42] to amen and they found out real quick
[1:07:45] that what they thought was
[1:07:48] certain what they thought they their
[1:07:50] instruments that they could they could
[1:07:52] go up into the heavens and prove there
[1:07:54] wasn't no rain they thought that was
[1:07:55] certain but what was certain God said
[1:07:58] build an
[1:07:59] ark and so here he is hammering on this
[1:08:01] raw Ark and people were coming and

[1:08:19] hasn't
[1:08:20] died he wants to look right in on us and

[1:22:40] saor pause and cly think about
[1:22:44] that there's another I'm borring this
[1:22:46] from a buddy of mine but there was
[1:22:48] another certain
[1:22:50] woman in the
[1:22:52] Bible right after Gideon had fought his
[1:22:55] race and he had died one of his sons by
[1:22:58] a concubine had taken over and he was R
[1:23:00] ruthless and he was killing all the
[1:23:02] other sons and he had chased them up and
[1:23:04] brought come to this city and but they
[1:23:06] said there was something about this city
[1:23:07] and this city was a strong tower that's
[1:23:10] right and so they went up into that
[1:23:12] strong tower oh my and they went up in
[1:23:15] there and here ailec comes against the
[1:23:17] tower and he's walking there making his
[1:23:19] threats and he's making his threats and
[1:23:22] he's saying I'm going to burn you down
[1:23:23] I'm going to kill you just like I did
[1:23:25] everybody else but there was a millstone
[1:23:27] up in that Tower and the Bible said a
[1:23:30] certain
[1:23:32] woman she grabbed a hold of a millstone
[1:23:34] and she just went over the top and
[1:23:36] looked
[1:23:38] down dropped it on
[1:23:41] him she dropped it on him and his head
[1:23:44] was caved in and he looked at his sword
[1:23:46] bear and he said please thrust me
[1:23:48] through so it won't be said of me I was
[1:23:50] killed by a
[1:23:53] woman but she wasn't just any woman she
[1:23:56] was a certain
[1:23:58] woman she was standing upon her promises
[1:24:01] and she got backed up into a strong
[1:24:03] tower I tell you the name of the Lord is
[1:24:06] a strong tower and the righteous can run
[1:24:09] into
[1:24:11] it don't run into your frustration don't
[1:24:14] run into your depression don't run into
[1:24:16] your fear run to the Lord run to the
[1:24:20] Tower and in there you will find the
[1:24:23] promise and when the comes against your
[1:24:28] [Applause]
[1:24:33] door I'm looking at a certain
[1:24:36] woman I'm looking at a devil
[1:24:39] defeater I'm looking at a serpent
[1:24:43] stomper I'm looking at somebody that
[1:24:46] knows who they are cuz they knows who
[1:24:48] they
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:51] are they knows who's they know who who
[1:24:54] they are we're not just anybody we've
[1:24:58] been placed here for a
[1:25:01] purpose back to our scripture how this
[1:25:04] he said how this little woman must have
[1:25:06] been the caliber of
[1:25:09] Elijah that's amazing huh the caliber of
[1:25:12] Elijah because usually your action shows
[1:25:16] what you
[1:25:19] are if you going to just cower down to
[1:25:21] the devil shows who you are but if you
[1:25:24] grabb that Millstone throw it on his
[1:25:25] rotten head yeah huah amen he said for
[1:25:30] we see that God would not have called
[1:25:32] her if she hadn't been worthy to
[1:25:35] entertain God's
[1:25:37] Prophet let me say this tonight he would
[1:25:39] not have called you if you wasn't worthy
[1:25:42] of the
[1:25:44] call so you must be of the same caliber
[1:25:48] of
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:52] Elijah amen for he would have never sent
[1:25:55] his Prophet to that house who was
[1:25:57] unworthy see it was not his choosing the
[1:25:59] prophets it was God's
[1:26:02] choosing hello somebody and it wasn't
[1:26:05] her bidding it was God's
[1:26:08] bidding he had been placed by the Brook
[1:26:11] and the stream had run out and God
[1:26:13] commanded him for something for a time
[1:26:15] to be there but it came a time he said
[1:26:17] see God surely went to a believer of the
[1:26:19] same nature of Elijah
[1:26:24] that she could believe just as he
[1:26:27] believed come on
[1:26:29] somebody that could she could have the
[1:26:31] same faith that he
[1:26:33] [Applause]
[1:26:35] had this message is not resting just
[1:26:38] Upon A a seventh
[1:26:41] angel but God has called a people of the
[1:26:44] same caliber of the same
[1:26:48] faith of the same anointing of the same
[1:26:51] power the Holy Ghost is the same in that
[1:26:54] life as it was in his
[1:26:55] [Applause]
[1:26:57] life she was a widow woman in other
[1:27:00] words her husband was
[1:27:03] dead you know and she wasn't even a Jew
[1:27:06] she was a gentile this ain't our type I
[1:27:08] don't know what it
[1:27:10] is and here here she he came death was
[1:27:14] coming right to the gate at her door
[1:27:16] death was about to get to her but before
[1:27:20] before death got
[1:27:22] there before all hope was was lost
[1:27:25] before it was going to be impossible for
[1:27:26] her to ever return before she was going
[1:27:29] to cross the line she heard a
[1:27:32] voice and the voice be to speak to her
[1:27:36] and there was something on the inside of
[1:27:38] her says that's nothing but the
[1:27:40] [Applause]

[1:27:45] trying to take some of you drugs and

[1:27:54] stepped to your
[1:27:57] gate God stepped in and his voice
[1:28:00] screamed out and it called you by
[1:28:03] name said you never was a chicken you

[1:29:41] again let this be a message it's the
[1:29:43] most strange sometimes that God does
[1:29:45] things that
[1:29:48] way he said no you know when you
[1:29:50] confessed your sins and you met every
[1:29:52] requirement that God requires and we

[1:30:15] morning who's come to that place he said
[1:30:17] I've been there many times myself when I
[1:30:19] went back and traced my life and turned
[1:30:21] over every stone and I find that I did
[1:30:22] something wrong then I'd go confess and
[1:30:24] say Lord I may want to make this right
[1:30:26] then come back again say no Lord Thou
[1:30:27] Art God you will answer me surely I've
[1:30:29] met every request you required me every
[1:30:31] requirement I've met and he still won't

[1:30:37] when you got to be certain he is
[1:30:42] [Applause]

[1:30:46] moment the only thing is that is your

[1:31:06] anything be certain in your heart that
[1:31:08] it's God and when you met everything he
[1:31:10] said then you're sure he's God that's
[1:31:12] when Faith goes to work right there
[1:31:14] Faith stands steady for it knows that he
[1:31:20] is and you met every requirement you
[1:31:23] believe that he is is Faith holds steady

[1:31:31] he's the rewarder of those that
[1:31:33] diligently seek
[1:31:36] Him He said may this go down deep and
[1:31:38] never move you brandom Tabernacle if you
[1:31:41] ever met God's requirement and in your
[1:31:43] heart you believe that he is God's only
[1:31:46] testing your
[1:31:49] faith for he loves to do that Hallelujah
[1:31:54] we don't love that he does it amen but
[1:31:56] he loves to do that said you've
[1:31:59] confessed your sin you made a
[1:32:00] requirement to God and still he lays
[1:32:02] silent remember faith says he is then

[1:35:01] me but he lets them get right down to
[1:35:04] their last place and brother B said

[1:35:41] thunder down through there he went and
[1:35:43] as they stepped into the
[1:35:46] fire there was a fourth
[1:35:50] man it takes the fire to bring the
[1:35:53] Fourth
[1:35:54] Man it takes trials it takes tribulation
[1:35:58] it takes these things that we go through
[1:36:00] sicknesses sicknesses is only a path for
[1:36:03] God to come to
[1:36:04] [Applause]
[1:36:08] you they were going to the fiery furnace
[1:36:10] knowing they were certain that if God
[1:36:13] let them burn he was going to raise them
[1:36:15] up that's they were certain of God
[1:36:17] because they knew that God would work
[1:36:19] everything for their good that's right
[1:36:22] that's a good scripture to be certain
[1:36:24] about all
[1:36:26] things work together for the good to
[1:36:30] them that are the called according to
[1:36:33] his

[1:36:48] hands bind their feet and start them to
[1:36:50] the furnace and they walk with their
[1:36:52] face to the fire amen God still standing
[1:36:56] looking at that and they were certain he
[1:36:59] was still God and they walk right up to
[1:37:01] the fiery furnace right up to the last
[1:37:04] moment and there he came riding out of
[1:37:06] Heavens on The Chariot of wind fan the
[1:37:07] breezes off them while he talked to him
[1:37:09] and consol them see God let your faith
[1:37:12] come to a spot to where it can react
[1:37:17] that's another place he said we find in
[1:37:20] those hours of real stress
[1:37:25] that's usually when the spirit of God
[1:37:27] moves in he let the Hebrew children walk
[1:37:31] right into the fiery furnace before he
[1:37:33] ever moved a muscle never moved a
[1:37:36] hand but when he
[1:37:39] moved he
[1:37:42] moves hallelujah amen you might feel
[1:37:46] like you're getting to your last moment
[1:37:49] but when God moves he moves
[1:37:53] Hallelujah you might look like you're
[1:37:55] getting your last threat of Hope but
[1:37:57] when God moves he
[1:38:00] moves there's some of you that was
[1:38:02] dangling over hell and fire was trying
[1:38:04] to burn the last thread but God rich in
[1:38:07] Mercy moved on your behalf and snatched
