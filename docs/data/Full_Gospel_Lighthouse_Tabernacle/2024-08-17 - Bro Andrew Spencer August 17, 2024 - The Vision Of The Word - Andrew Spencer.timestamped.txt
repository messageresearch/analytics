[46:50] Body we pray that our spirit would be in

[47:04] burn father with the power of the Holy
[47:07] Spirit we could say our soul has been

[47:13] hour I pray God that you would do the
[47:16] miraculous here amongst us
[47:18] tonight Lord I I have felt I have felt

[47:53] in this atmosphere tonight in Jesus name
[47:56] name we pray these things amen and amen
[48:01] and amen God richly bless you tonight if
[48:04] you have your Bibles we would like to
[48:06] look over in the book of
[48:08] Ephesians the book of Ephesians chapter
[48:12] 1 and verse 9 and also to 2 Corinthians
[48:15] chapter 5 and verse 7
[48:32] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse
[48:38] 9 having made known unto us the mystery
[48:42] of his will according to his good
[48:45] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[48:48] himself that in the dispensation of the
[48:51] fullness of times he might gather
[48:53] together in one all things in Christ
[48:56] both which are in heaven and which are
[48:58] on earth even in him in whom also we
[49:02] have obtained an inheritance being
[49:04] predestinated let's say that together
[49:06] being
[49:07] predestinated according to the purpose
[49:09] of him who worketh all things after the
[49:13] counsil of his own will that we should
[49:15] be to the praise of his glory who first
[49:19] trusted in Christ in whom ye also
[49:22] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[49:25] Truth the go Gospel of your salvation in
[49:28] whom also after that ye believed you
[49:31] were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[49:34] Promise notice the notice the the
[49:37] literature and how it's lined out here
[49:39] how Paul writes this in whom also after
[49:42] you believed you were sealed with the
[49:45] Holy Spirit of Promise which is the
[49:48] earnest of our inheritance until the
[49:51] Redemption of the purchased possession
[49:53] unto the praise of his glory also so 2
[49:57] Corinthians chap 5 and: 7 just one verse
[50:00] here we'd like to draw a text from this
[50:05] evening Paul says it like this for we
[50:09] walk by
[50:10] faith not by sight may God bless his
[50:14] word you may be seated in the presence
[50:16] of the Lord for we walk by faith and not
[50:20] by sight tonight I'd like to speak to
[50:23] you on a thought that the Lord laid on
[50:25] my heart this past Wednesday evening on
[50:28] the vision the vision of the word the
[50:31] vision of the word and we realize that
[50:33] we are living we are living in an age
[50:36] we're living in an age of progression
[50:38] and we are living in an age of where we
[50:40] are seeing all the benefits of the tree
[50:42] of knowledge of good and evil as it's as
[50:45] you're seeing all of the wisdom of the
[50:46] leaves off of that tree how that it is
[50:49] becoming made manifest you've seen the
[50:51] Tree of Life you've watched the power of
[50:54] the tree of life and you've watched
[50:56] Jesus Christ work work through the gifts
[50:59] of the body you've seen Jesus Christ but
[51:01] now we are living in an age where we're
[51:03] literally watching the tree of wisdom
[51:05] and knowledge as men begin to eat off of
[51:07] that tree they begin to gather they
[51:09] begin to gather fruits off of that tree
[51:11] and you begin to watch men in the
[51:13] science realm and they begin to eat more
[51:15] and more and we realize that the more
[51:18] Humanity eats off of it the more that we
[51:20] destroy ourself but we realize that
[51:22] through scientific Ingenuity that men
[51:25] have developed uh the ability to be able
[51:27] to to look beyond the elements that you
[51:30] and I see with our natural eyes and they
[51:33] they have developed systems to be able
[51:35] to look beyond the Earth's surface below
[51:37] below the Earth and they have developed
[51:39] things and telescopes and and Hubble
[51:41] Hubble Scopes to be able to look into
[51:44] the world above by using different
[51:46] lenses and different sensors to be able
[51:48] to look into by radar and look into the
[51:51] ground below and and different forms of
[51:53] vision to be able to look past what we
[51:56] see in on the surface of an object and
[51:59] you can see how advanced how that we've
[52:01] came for the past 100 years we have
[52:04] become the most modernized and the most
[52:07] advanced in that in that in that realm
[52:09] to be able to say that that we have
[52:11] tapped into a world that that
[52:13] necessarily we don't fully understand in
[52:15] our Humanity but yet men have ate off of
[52:18] that tree of knowledge and they have
[52:20] they have gained access under those
[52:21] things even even uh we realize that even
[52:25] uh uh the The Brainiac Albert Einstein
[52:28] he tapped into a world and brother
[52:30] bandam would use the terminology that he
[52:32] tapped into God's laboratory and the we
[52:35] see that men have the ability to be able
[52:37] to to look into a world that maybe we
[52:40] can't see with our own eyes and it's
[52:42] amazing that that even in our human
[52:45] sight we are limited in our human sight
[52:47] so that we can't see we can't see
[52:49] through that wall we can't see through
[52:51] this that or the other but we realize
[52:53] that man has developed technology so
[52:56] they can use sensors and they can use
[52:58] radar they can they can Pierce through
[53:00] and they can look and see heat elements
[53:02] and they can see different worlds and
[53:04] they can use x-ray machines but we
[53:06] realize that man in all of its power and
[53:09] man in all of its scientific Ingenuity
[53:11] that it's limited in that aspect you
[53:14] even we realize that God has got a a
[53:16] vision that looks past what we can see
[53:19] he has the ability to see the the Eye of
[53:22] of the Lord is upon them that fear Him
[53:25] and we real that God has seen us before
[53:28] the foundation of the world that that
[53:31] even though that man has has different
[53:33] Technologies of ex-ray machines that he
[53:35] uses he uses the light of the body to be
[53:38] able to look in there and see whether
[53:39] you have a broken bone or whether you
[53:41] have this that or the other but man
[53:43] using that x-ray machine they still
[53:46] cannot see cannot see and pick up unseen
[53:49] forces that are setting there brother
[53:51] Brandon would use it in a time when he
[53:52] said if you would see somebody that
[53:55] would be death and dumb he he said they
[53:56] could look there by an x-ray machine and
[53:58] they could look there and maybe see all
[54:00] of the elements of the body he said but
[54:02] they can't see that unseen Force the
[54:04] devil sitting there that is cutting off
[54:06] the the hearing to the ear and cutting
[54:08] off the ability to be able to speak he
[54:10] said but what it is he said it's an
[54:12] unseen Force he said it's a devil that
[54:14] is sitting there you see Satan can hide
[54:17] from man but Satan cannot hide from
[54:19] almighty God is that right Satan can
[54:22] hide from man Satan can hide from the
[54:24] instruments of humanity but he cannot
[54:26] hide from almighty God I remember when
[54:28] when brother Ron was going through the
[54:30] the process of testing out biopsies and
[54:33] going through and chest texting out
[54:35] testing different aspects of of his
[54:37] length nodes and different things they
[54:38] were looking for it and it would try to
[54:40] hide it would try to move cancer is a
[54:42] living cell that that's got a got it's
[54:44] got connected a Bru cell that's
[54:46] connected to a live cell and it started
[54:48] to move and it's tried to hide but
[54:50] before long the doctors were able to
[54:52] find it but before them doctors were
[54:54] able to find that little bitty scarf
[54:56] tissue go almighty God had already
[54:58] recognized and was working on the scene
[55:01] before man could find it now Jesus would
[55:04] say this in Luke chap 10 and 23 that he
[55:07] turned unto them unto his di his
[55:09] disciples and said privately blessed are
[55:12] the eyes blessed are th eyes which see
[55:16] the things that you
[55:17] see for I tell you that many prophets
[55:20] and Kings have desired to see those
[55:22] things which you see and have not seen
[55:25] them and to hear those things which you
[55:27] hear and have not heard them so we
[55:29] realize that God hasn't ordained elect
[55:33] lady or elect people to be able to see
[55:36] what God wills and what God wants in his
[55:39] word he he has elected people in every
[55:41] age in the age of Noah in the n in the
[55:44] age of Moses he elected men and ordained
[55:46] men to fall under the leadership of the
[55:49] word of that hour now brother Brandon
[55:51] would say this that a vision is God by a
[55:54] word of knowledge it's dropping to a
[55:56] person to foresee or foresee something
[55:59] he says it tells something that has been
[56:01] or something that will be a vision is
[56:05] the forecast of future events it
[56:07] foretells things before it happens it
[56:11] it's a vision for tell something before
[56:13] it ever happens it's it's like a it's
[56:16] like you and I maybe we have we we all
[56:18] dream in an element of of our
[56:20] subconscious and we dream there but a
[56:22] vision is while a person is awake and
[56:25] they literally are watching the scene
[56:27] before it takes place brother bom would
[56:29] say in a prophetic real that a vision is
[56:32] thus sayith the Lord and it's saying
[56:34] that these things are going to be thus
[56:37] and thus and we realize that the word of
[56:39] the Lord that the voice of the word of
[56:42] the hour is everything that we have need
[56:44] of is that right the voice of the word
[56:47] will meet the need of the hour that
[56:49] we're in and I say it like this we don't
[56:51] need an intellectual speech to meet the
[56:53] need of the hour we don't we don't need
[56:55] some work up by emotions to meet the
[56:58] need of the hour but what we want and
[57:01] what we desire as Christians is the
[57:03] vision of God to be able to speak in
[57:05] this hour because I believe that that
[57:07] God has certain words in certain times
[57:09] and certain season that he begins to
[57:11] drop words and drop things that are
[57:14] released as prophecy for the season that
[57:17] humanity is setting in just like it is
[57:19] said in Isaiah chapter 40 and3 that it
[57:21] was the voice of one crying in the
[57:24] wilderness but it took 7 12 12 years
[57:27] later that there John the Baptist was
[57:29] standing there and he was fulfilling the
[57:32] vision of Isaiah and here John the
[57:34] Baptist he looked like Elijah he dressed
[57:37] like Elijah he ate like Elijah his
[57:39] ministry had the ability to attract
[57:41] crowds like a like Elijah what was it he
[57:45] was falling in line with what the
[57:47] scriptures would say that there would
[57:49] become a third coming of Elijah in that
[57:52] day and that is the power of Prophecy in
[57:55] every Ag and and every time that a
[57:57] prophet would arise and when prophecy
[57:59] would come the ability of power of
[58:02] Prophecy it literally draws people it
[58:05] literally contracts or attracts the
[58:07] believer to the word of the hour it's
[58:10] like the bait on the end of a hook it
[58:12] attracts the fish you don't show him the
[58:14] hook you show him the bait is that right
[58:17] and so here is the pull of the hour and
[58:20] it begins to attract the elected ones of
[58:22] the hour to come to that season to the
[58:25] manifestation that God ordained them to
[58:27] be
[58:32] at it's amazing when you begin to look
[58:35] at it that you have been pulled up you
[58:39] have been pulled up to be able to see
[58:41] what you
[58:42] see if you can look at it like this
[58:45] Abraham do you really see who you
[58:49] are Abraham do you really see who you
[58:51] are in the Great scheme of things you're
[58:54] not just another man going through the
[58:56] tions you're not just another man living
[58:58] in a far country but you are here living
[59:01] out prophecy and I believe that if
[59:03] Abraham could take a step back and look
[59:06] at what God had ordained for him in his
[59:08] life he could fully capture the vision
[59:11] of what God had had in store for him I
[59:13] believe that too many times that we we
[59:15] as Christians we look on the surface of
[59:18] things and we don't take a step back and
[59:20] look at what the great scheme of things
[59:22] that is going on amongst the word of the
[59:24] hour if can look at it like this Moses
[59:27] do you see who you are do you see who
[59:30] you are you're not just a son of Joseph
[59:33] and amram but you are raised come on
[59:35] somebody to just not just to be the a
[59:39] man that was floating down the down the
[59:41] Nile River but you are raised for a
[59:45] purpose if I could say it like this
[59:48] little bride do you see who you are can
[59:51] you see yourself in the word in the
[59:53] scope of the word not just by looking at
[59:56] your own natural eye not just looking at
[59:58] it from your own Humanity but looking at
[1:00:00] it through God's elected
[1:00:03] word in modern events the prophet would
[1:00:06] say not one time has it ever missed he
[1:00:08] said it won't for who for who are
[1:00:11] predestinated to see it will see it
[1:00:14] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:00:16] my father draws him and all that the
[1:00:18] father has given me will come it's the
[1:00:20] word joining with the word it can't do
[1:00:22] nothing else now notice what the Bible
[1:00:25] said in Romans 9:11 for the children
[1:00:28] being not yet born neither having done
[1:00:30] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:00:33] according to the election might stand
[1:00:35] not of works but of him that calleth now
[1:00:39] go down to verse 21 and the Bible said
[1:00:42] hath not the powder power over the clay
[1:00:45] or the same lump to make one vessel
[1:00:47] under honor and another under
[1:00:50] dishonor it's the power of the Potter
[1:00:53] that makes the vessel is that right you
[1:00:55] didn't put yourself in line for this but
[1:00:58] there is somebody that has made a vessel
[1:01:00] under Hunter and somebody that has made
[1:01:02] a vessel under dishonor what if God
[1:01:05] willing to show his wrath and to make
[1:01:07] his power known endured with much long
[1:01:10] with much longsuffering the vessels of
[1:01:12] Wrath fitted to destruction and that he
[1:01:15] might make known The Riches of his glory
[1:01:17] on the vessels of Mercy which he had a
[1:01:20] four prepared unto glory to think about
[1:01:24] the for knowledge of almighty God
[1:01:26] that he appointed he has an appointed
[1:01:28] time to release the
[1:01:32] forecast to release the forecast of the
[1:01:35] hour that we're living in that God has
[1:01:37] ordained vessels of Honor right here in
[1:01:39] the midst of Le oosa when there's many
[1:01:42] vessels of Dishonor when there's many of
[1:01:45] wicked of Wrath and vessels of
[1:01:47] Destruction but God has ordained
[1:01:49] somebody that would be a vessel of Honor
[1:01:52] that would aligns by the preaching of
[1:01:55] the word
[1:01:56] again he would say now I want you to
[1:01:58] notice he does it that way in every age
[1:02:01] he does it every time by the same method
[1:02:03] he has to take Believers then in order
[1:02:05] to have Believers to meet that word he's
[1:02:08] got to predestinate it to that age you
[1:02:10] see he's got to predestinate this thing
[1:02:13] to be there to meet the challenge of the
[1:02:16] age so God did not just send you here
[1:02:20] just to see if it would work or not the
[1:02:22] prophet would say that he predestinated
[1:02:25] a people that's going to receive the
[1:02:27] word of the hour so he did not send you
[1:02:30] here in vain he didn't send you through
[1:02:32] the trials that you've been through just
[1:02:34] in vain he didn't send you through the
[1:02:36] calamities of life just for you to go
[1:02:38] through them and not for them to work
[1:02:40] for your good but he sent you through it
[1:02:42] for a reason for a purpose you had a
[1:02:46] week like you had just to just to prove
[1:02:49] that God was that kind of a God that he
[1:02:51] could bring you out so that he could
[1:02:53] bring you in
[1:02:56] now we know what the Bible said in
[1:02:58] Proverbs 29 and 18 is very familiar to
[1:03:01] us that where there is no vision the
[1:03:04] people perish where there is no vision
[1:03:07] the people perish so we realize that by
[1:03:10] this word right here that the word of
[1:03:12] God is Not Just to be read or heard it's
[1:03:15] to be
[1:03:17] seen the word of God is not just for the
[1:03:19] hearing of the ears but the word of God
[1:03:21] is for you to see it we've heard about
[1:03:24] what God had did in Moses
[1:03:26] we heard what God did in Noah we heard
[1:03:29] what God did in David we heard what God
[1:03:31] did in Isaiah we heard what God did in
[1:03:34] Elijah but I don't want to just hear
[1:03:36] about the God of Elijah I don't want to
[1:03:38] just hear about the God of Moses I don't
[1:03:40] want to just hear about the God of David
[1:03:43] I want to see that
[1:03:45] God come on somebody if we're just
[1:03:48] serving a dead Fable then we're no
[1:03:50] greater than any other religion but if
[1:03:52] we have a living God that has a vision
[1:03:56] for the
[1:03:59] generation so I believe that according
[1:04:01] to the scripture that the god that we
[1:04:03] serve has a vision for the hour that
[1:04:05] we're living in because I look out upon
[1:04:08] this age I don't see a perishing
[1:04:11] people you might see that in leosia you
[1:04:14] might see that in the church world but I
[1:04:16] do not see that in the Church of the
[1:04:19] Bride of Jesus Christ this bride is not
[1:04:21] perishing this bride is not in famine
[1:04:24] this bride is not falling away way this
[1:04:26] bride is moving
[1:04:28] higher Satan has done his absolute worst
[1:04:31] to stop the Bride of Jesus Christ but
[1:04:34] she has a vision she has a hope she has
[1:04:37] a
[1:04:41] glory so when we align oursel with the
[1:04:45] vision of the word we see the cosmos
[1:04:49] through God's
[1:04:52] eyes when we align oursel with the word
[1:04:55] we can see through God's
[1:04:58] eyes what are you saying brother Andrew
[1:05:00] I'm saying it like this we see the
[1:05:02] Brokenness but we also see the potential
[1:05:05] for healing we see the sin but we also
[1:05:08] see the power of redemption we see
[1:05:11] disappointments but we see opportunities
[1:05:15] we see people that are bound but we see
[1:05:17] an opportunity for deliverance we see
[1:05:19] the blind but we see an opportunity to
[1:05:22] Open the blind's
[1:05:24] Eyes so the word of the hour literally
[1:05:27] enables us to discern from right and
[1:05:30] wrong Cory
[1:05:32] timbon that came out of the Nazi camp
[1:05:35] said it like this said if you look at
[1:05:37] the world you'll be distressed if you
[1:05:41] look within you'll be depressed but if
[1:05:43] you look at God you'll be at
[1:05:47] rest now here's a woman that was helping
[1:05:50] Jews get into their house and get out of
[1:05:52] the hands of Nazis they caught her put
[1:05:55] her in concentration camps put her in
[1:05:57] there and she made her way through it by
[1:06:00] the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:06:02] she said if you look out there if you
[1:06:04] look out there you'll be depressed if
[1:06:06] you look in here if you look in here
[1:06:08] you'll be distressed but if you look at
[1:06:11] God I want to ask you where's your eyes
[1:06:14] at tonight where's your vision at
[1:06:16] tonight if all you see is Hope of
[1:06:19] falling away if all you see is healing
[1:06:21] not coming if all you see is distress
[1:06:24] that's constantly binding you then
[1:06:26] you've got your eyes on the wrong things
[1:06:29] but if you've got your eyes on the
[1:06:32] word if you've got your
[1:06:34] eyes oh
[1:06:38] Hallelujah so let me let me just put it
[1:06:40] in view so if we the
[1:06:43] seen the
[1:06:46] seen can catch the
[1:06:50] Unseen then we'll see the
[1:06:53] supernatural if we the seen in our
[1:06:56] mortal bodies can cut can catch the
[1:07:01] Unseen then we'll catch the inspiration
[1:07:03] of almighty God now notice what the
[1:07:06] prophet would say like this in looking
[1:07:08] at the Unseen he said when a man once
[1:07:10] catches that vision of the Invincible
[1:07:12] God and knows that he's always present
[1:07:14] he said there's something that
[1:07:15] stabilizes that man's thinking he said
[1:07:18] it stabilizes his action in the time of
[1:07:20] distress and in trouble it'll make him
[1:07:22] look upward above the things that are
[1:07:24] happening around him because he's
[1:07:26] looking at the Unseen by a promise you
[1:07:30] see the man when he can ever capture
[1:07:34] that vision of the Unseen it literally
[1:07:37] stabilizes his thinking when you look at
[1:07:39] the prophet mcka when he's standing
[1:07:41] there and ahab's getting ready down
[1:07:43] there to go down into battle brother
[1:07:45] Joel he's going down there and he's
[1:07:47] looking out there and a Jehoshaphat
[1:07:50] hears the voice of 400 prophets and they
[1:07:53] say we're going to go out there and
[1:07:54] we're going to conquer it but
[1:07:56] Jehoshaphat being a righteous man he
[1:07:58] said is there what yet one more prophet
[1:08:00] in the land and Ahab said there's one he
[1:08:02] said but I hate him he hates me he said
[1:08:05] every time I try to do something he
[1:08:06] curses me he stops me right in my right
[1:08:09] in my
[1:08:10] steps but Jehoshaphat called for Micaiah
[1:08:14] and they come down there Micaiah come
[1:08:16] all the way down there and said now look
[1:08:19] they had a conference with him and said
[1:08:20] you only say what we've said Micaiah
[1:08:23] said I'm not going to say what you said
[1:08:25] but I'm only going to say what the word
[1:08:27] of the Lord puts up my
[1:08:29] lips so Micaiah goes up there he goes up
[1:08:33] there and grabs a vision from almighty
[1:08:35] God he said I'm going to wait and
[1:08:37] compare my vision with the word of the
[1:08:40] hour because he realized that Elijah had
[1:08:44] already cursed
[1:08:46] Ahab so Micaiah knew that he couldn't
[1:08:50] have a vision out line out of line with
[1:08:54] what Elijah had already said so Micaiah
[1:08:57] had to have a vision that matched the
[1:09:00] word of the
[1:09:02] hour so Mao when he was standing there
[1:09:05] in the face of criticism in the face of
[1:09:07] false prophets when the face of them
[1:09:09] slapping him in the
[1:09:12] face he stood there like a true prophet
[1:09:15] and the prophet said that he compared
[1:09:17] his vision with the word and he knew
[1:09:20] that he was right in
[1:09:22] line so let me ask you this what is your
[1:09:27] vision compared to the message of the
[1:09:30] hour if it says you can have three wives
[1:09:33] and three husbands it's not in line with
[1:09:35] the
[1:09:38] word let me preach just for a minute if
[1:09:41] it says you can dll yourself up and look
[1:09:43] like Hollywood then your vision is not
[1:09:45] in line with the
[1:09:50] word come on somebody if your vision
[1:09:53] tells you that you've got every right to
[1:09:55] go and smoke and drink and do all those
[1:09:57] things then your vision is not lined up
[1:10:00] with the
[1:10:03] word but Micaiah stood right there
[1:10:08] literally he caught the Unseen and it
[1:10:11] stabilized his thinking that in the face
[1:10:14] of all of the criticism he was fortified
[1:10:19] by the vision of the
[1:10:21] word you look at this bride this bride
[1:10:24] ain't wavering
[1:10:25] she's not staggering back and forth
[1:10:27] under the pressures of Le osia but she's
[1:10:30] steadfast she's unmovable she's enduring
[1:10:34] she's pressing the battle she's not
[1:10:36] moving when people say the message is
[1:10:38] wrong she's not moving when Satan comes
[1:10:40] against her but she stands right there
[1:10:43] she's stabilized she's got a
[1:10:46] vision she's got a vision of the Unseen
[1:10:50] World let me tell you your testimony you
[1:10:53] being here testifies that there is is an
[1:10:55] Unseen
[1:11:01] World I love what the prophet said and
[1:11:04] why can I speak he said Faith sees what
[1:11:07] God wants he said Faith looks to see
[1:11:10] what God wants and it works accordingly
[1:11:13] faith is a long range Vision he said
[1:11:16] that don't lower its sights it holds to
[1:11:18] the Target and any shooter knows that he
[1:11:21] said it's a long range Vision he said
[1:11:23] it's a telescope it's a binocular you
[1:11:25] don't look around here you don't use
[1:11:27] binoculars to see what time it
[1:11:30] is come on somebody you don't use
[1:11:33] binoculars to look at your watch do you
[1:11:36] you useing binoculars look way out there
[1:11:39] he said you don't use binoculars look
[1:11:41] see what time it is you don't use that
[1:11:43] but you use binoculars to look way off
[1:11:46] he said and that's what faith does faith
[1:11:48] picks up God's binoculars both of them
[1:11:51] both sides of New and Old Testament and
[1:11:53] sees every promise that he made
[1:11:55] and Faith sees it out yonder and Faith
[1:11:58] chooses
[1:12:00] that Faith chooses that regardless of
[1:12:04] the present tense says here he looks at
[1:12:07] that
[1:12:11] end now I know good and well who I'm
[1:12:14] talking to tonight you're not looking at
[1:12:16] the things that you see because if you
[1:12:18] were looking at the things that you see
[1:12:19] you would have done gave up this week so
[1:12:21] you're looking at it Faith you're
[1:12:23] looking at it through the eyes of faith
[1:12:25] and faith is taking you into a world
[1:12:28] that you don't necessarily understand
[1:12:30] with your natural eyes but you have
[1:12:33] abilities by faith to put yourself in
[1:12:36] line with the
[1:12:41] power I'm going somewhere y'all just
[1:12:44] buckle up I'm going somewhere because
[1:12:47] when Jesus was standing here he was not
[1:12:50] like any other man but he was endued
[1:12:52] with the power to be able to look at the
[1:12:54] Unseen
[1:12:55] because the rest of men was standing out
[1:12:58] there at a whale and they saw a
[1:13:01] prostitute but Jesus wasn't looking at
[1:13:03] what men
[1:13:06] see now I know somebody's got the
[1:13:08] ability to say Amen to that because
[1:13:10] there was somewhere in your life that
[1:13:13] Humanity could not see what God was
[1:13:15] seeing in
[1:13:16] you what what did Jesus see the word saw
[1:13:20] the word on the inside of that
[1:13:22] prostitute he looked at her and and he
[1:13:25] called her by the
[1:13:27] word it's just like it's just like when
[1:13:30] he was looking at Simon and he looked at
[1:13:33] there he said blessed off thou Simon for
[1:13:35] Flesh and Blood did not reveal this unto
[1:13:37] you he changed his name from Simon to
[1:13:42] Peter now everybody would have said
[1:13:44] Peter's a wrong guy to
[1:13:46] choose he was the kind of guy shot from
[1:13:48] the hip he was everywhere he just acted
[1:13:51] in the moment but Jesus saw something
[1:13:56] he saw something that Andrew his brother
[1:13:59] didn't see he saw something that John
[1:14:02] didn't see he saw something that
[1:14:04] Bartholomew didn't see what did he see
[1:14:07] he saw somebody that would be a rock of
[1:14:14] testimony I think about brother Jim Noel
[1:14:17] I think about how God would Raise A Man
[1:14:20] up that should have never been here that
[1:14:23] should have never been in the picture
[1:14:27] but the word saw the
[1:14:30] word there was a line of things that
[1:14:33] should have kept Jim Noel out but the
[1:14:35] word saw the
[1:14:37] word hallelujah all of you should have
[1:14:40] never been here but the word saw the
[1:14:42] word Jesus was not looking at your flesh
[1:14:46] Jesus was not looking at your mistakes
[1:14:48] Jesus was
[1:14:51] looking at himself
[1:14:55] Romans 8:24 says for we are saved by
[1:14:58] hope but hope that is seen is not
[1:15:03] hope for what a man seeth why does he
[1:15:06] yet hope for but if we hope for that we
[1:15:10] see not then do we have patience to wait
[1:15:14] for it so the scripture is saying that
[1:15:17] you have an
[1:15:19] expectation of the future
[1:15:21] good I love what the Bible said in
[1:15:24] Psalms 40 and 12 for innumerable evils
[1:15:28] have compassed me about my iniquities
[1:15:31] have taken a hold upon me so that I'm
[1:15:34] not able to look
[1:15:36] up you look at that word in the Hebrew
[1:15:38] when the psalmist writes this that he
[1:15:41] says my iniquities have taken a hold
[1:15:42] upon me so that I'm able not to look up
[1:15:46] but you look at that in the Hebrew it
[1:15:49] means that I'm not able to
[1:15:52] see so the the the mistakes the
[1:15:58] iniquities had made the worshipper into
[1:16:02] a spot that he couldn't even
[1:16:06] see man ain't that
[1:16:08] powerful they are more than the hairs of
[1:16:11] my head therefore my heart faileth me so
[1:16:16] the guilt of life's
[1:16:18] mistakes had caused a man to look at
[1:16:22] himself and not have the ability
[1:16:25] to
[1:16:28] see how many angels we got in the
[1:16:32] building uhuh got you over there
[1:16:38] buddy it's a it's more in here than you
[1:16:41] can see but it's a whole lot of humans
[1:16:43] that you can
[1:16:46] see and at some point in our life we had
[1:16:51] we had we had mistakes on us we had Tri
[1:16:55] s on us we had things upon us that we
[1:16:58] couldn't see what God
[1:17:00] sees when you look at the scripture and
[1:17:03] you perfectly line them words up of
[1:17:05] being able not to see it's perfectly in
[1:17:08] line with what Jesus was setting forth
[1:17:10] to his disciples in the fa in the
[1:17:12] parable of Luke chapter 18 of the
[1:17:15] worshipper that had came to the house of
[1:17:16] God of the Publican and the Pharisee and
[1:17:20] he's standing there in Luke 18 and the
[1:17:22] Pharisees standing there it said Lord I
[1:17:25] thank you I'm not like an adulator I'm
[1:17:27] not like an extortionist I'm not unjust
[1:17:29] and I'm not like this so far this
[1:17:31] so-called Publican right here I fast
[1:17:33] twice a week I pray every day I go to
[1:17:37] the house of the
[1:17:39] Lord and the Publican stood right there
[1:17:43] and the Bible said that he that he had
[1:17:46] so much on him that he couldn't even
[1:17:48] look up to heaven but I love what the
[1:17:51] scripture said that he smoted his chest
[1:17:54] and and said God be merciful to me a
[1:17:57] sinner and Jesus said that this man went
[1:18:01] to his house
[1:18:06] Justified ain't it amazing that Satan
[1:18:09] wants to keep your focus on the things
[1:18:11] of this life and the mistakes of this
[1:18:14] life but Jesus Takes your ability to
[1:18:17] look at the things that you
[1:18:20] see and translate them to the things
[1:18:24] that he wants you to
[1:18:27] see let me let me just paint a picture
[1:18:30] to you just for a minute when I gave my
[1:18:32] heart to the
[1:18:34] Lord that was one
[1:18:37] thing and I didn't realize what I was
[1:18:39] fully running
[1:18:42] from but for about 18 to 24 months I was
[1:18:45] running with everything that was on the
[1:18:46] inside of me running from this
[1:18:48] calling I was running with a
[1:18:51] power that was human power
[1:18:55] because the things that were on me the
[1:18:58] things that I had done I had done it in
[1:19:01] the face of the public I had I had you
[1:19:05] you watched me grow up here you watch me
[1:19:08] as a Christian boy raised in a Christian
[1:19:10] Home raised in a place raised in a place
[1:19:13] that that that that I that I that that I
[1:19:16] thought that I knew what was right but
[1:19:18] yet there was no power there was no
[1:19:21] power because I did not have the life of
[1:19:23] it I didn't have the life of it to live
[1:19:26] on the inside of me and I allowed them
[1:19:30] mistakes to hold me back from
[1:19:35] running because Satan ens snared
[1:19:38] me what if this one remembers what if
[1:19:41] that one remember they watch you grow up
[1:19:42] they watch you do
[1:19:45] this ain't it amazing now I'm painting
[1:19:47] my picture but I know I'm painting your
[1:19:49] picture too is that Satan loves loves to
[1:19:53] put you and make you focus on the things
[1:19:57] that you've done and he doesn't want you
[1:19:59] to put your focus on the things that the
[1:20:02] cross
[1:20:06] did but I was in my room one night and I
[1:20:10] was running with everything that's
[1:20:12] within me and I said God if you called
[1:20:15] me to this I'll run with everything
[1:20:17] that's within me but I will not come out
[1:20:20] of this room until you call
[1:20:23] me I was that desperate with
[1:20:28] God I locked myself in that room and I
[1:20:32] wasn't coming
[1:20:33] out and all of a sudden the spirit of
[1:20:35] the Lord spoke to me and said turn to
[1:20:38] Isaiah 30 and 21 and the word of the
[1:20:41] Lord said thine ears will hear a voice
[1:20:43] behind thee saying this is the way walk
[1:20:45] ye in it when you turn to the left and
[1:20:47] when you turn to the right I walked out
[1:20:48] and said I'm called to
[1:20:52] preach I knew what I was was running
[1:20:55] from but when the word of the Lord put
[1:20:59] me in line with his vision I may have
[1:21:03] had mistakes I may have had failures I
[1:21:06] may have had problems but I was called
[1:21:09] by almighty God and though Satan May
[1:21:13] tried to ensnare me though Satan may
[1:21:15] have tried to corrupt me the power of
[1:21:19] God was far greater than the depths of
[1:21:23] Satan could ever ens snare me
[1:21:31] too I love how how Jesus goes down in
[1:21:34] Luke chapter 18 he goes down in
[1:21:37] there and he's walking by
[1:21:40] Jericho and he finds a
[1:21:43] man Jesus is passing by and it looks
[1:21:46] like he ain't going to
[1:21:47] stop but blind barus is sitting there
[1:21:51] he's sitting there he's hanging on to
[1:21:53] every word
[1:21:55] and all of a sudden he hears a commotion
[1:21:57] down there at Full Gospel Lighthouse I
[1:21:59] said what is that what's going on up
[1:22:02] there they said it's
[1:22:04] Jesus it's
[1:22:06] Jesus and when he cried out the more
[1:22:10] even though people tried to stop him
[1:22:12] from saying amen even though people
[1:22:14] tried to stop him and Reign him in with
[1:22:16] his
[1:22:18] words he cried out the more and said
[1:22:21] thou son of David have mercy
[1:22:26] don't have judgment on me have mercy on
[1:22:33] me what did he ask
[1:22:35] for he said What wilt thou have me
[1:22:39] do that I might
[1:22:42] receive my
[1:22:45] vision now notice his vision was stolen
[1:22:49] from him and you think about the things
[1:22:51] that Satan has tried to do in this hour
[1:22:54] he has tried to rob the Church of the
[1:22:56] Living God from her vision to stop her
[1:22:59] to keep her in a place that she can't
[1:23:02] live any higher but God has God has
[1:23:06] elected a vision for the hour and when
[1:23:10] when he looked when blind Bemus sitting
[1:23:13] there in his blindness and when Jesus
[1:23:16] said these words receive thy
[1:23:21] sight thy faith
[1:23:27] ha made thee
[1:23:30] whole come on somebody thy faith have
[1:23:33] made thee
[1:23:35] whole I love it I love it because even
[1:23:40] though there was critics there that was
[1:23:43] trying he was stabilized by capturing
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:47] Unseen you say well that person
[1:23:49] shouldn't shout in church that person
[1:23:52] shouldn't Amen in church that person
[1:23:54] shouldn't clap their hands in
[1:23:58] church come on somebody Jesus had done
[1:24:01] been by this man Jesus had done walk by
[1:24:04] him he done went on but because of his
[1:24:08] shouting because of his need behind his
[1:24:13] shout it perfectly aligned himself for
[1:24:17] his
[1:24:18] healing maybe you don't understand maybe
[1:24:21] you don't understand but I want to say
[1:24:23] this to you God's got a vision for you
[1:24:26] and the vision is a vision that'll line
[1:24:30] up to the
[1:24:32] word I notice I was talking to brother
[1:24:36] Andrew Glover and he this evening he
[1:24:38] said to send you all his greetings I was
[1:24:41] I was conversing with him on some of
[1:24:43] these texts and he sent me this quote
[1:24:45] brother maram said and looking for Jesus
[1:24:47] he said now what is a vision he said
[1:24:49] it's another dimension he said it's a
[1:24:52] six sense brother Bon captures that in
[1:24:55] 1964 and question answers he said you
[1:24:58] see there a
[1:25:10] door you see there you see you're a dual
[1:25:14] person three people in soul body and
[1:25:16] spirit he said I believe you're outward
[1:25:18] senses he said your soul your body he
[1:25:20] said your outside conscience your senses
[1:25:23] he said when when you're awake in other
[1:25:25] words he said you're operated by five
[1:25:27] senses see taste feel smell and hear
[1:25:30] them were only given to you to contact
[1:25:33] your Earthly
[1:25:35] home he said they were not given to you
[1:25:37] to contact your heavenly
[1:25:40] home he said that's there's actually six
[1:25:43] senses in the human
[1:25:46] body because he's number six in the
[1:25:48] Bible he was created on the sixth day
[1:25:50] he's a number six man he is he's got a
[1:25:52] see see taste feel smell and hear and
[1:25:55] Faith now notice
[1:25:57] this his faith sets his
[1:26:01] destination for where he's headed
[1:26:05] for I love what the prophet says his
[1:26:08] faith sets his
[1:26:10] destination for where he's H it
[1:26:14] for faith is not an emotion faith is not
[1:26:17] a feeling faith is a
[1:26:21] revelation come on somebody faith is not
[1:26:24] when you're worked up Faith is not when
[1:26:26] you're shouting faith is a
[1:26:30] revelation that be brings about an
[1:26:33] emotional shout a dance but Faith sets a
[1:26:40] destination I love what the prophet
[1:26:42] would say now out in front of you is a
[1:26:44] well body out in front of you is a well
[1:26:47] body let me go let me go just a little
[1:26:50] bit further in this quote he sets his
[1:26:51] faith his faith sets his destination
[1:26:54] where where he's headed for because
[1:26:55] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[1:26:57] the evidence of things you don't see
[1:26:59] taste feel smell or here but by faith
[1:27:02] when he catches that word it sends him
[1:27:04] into a
[1:27:07] dimension what is a vision it's another
[1:27:10] dimension it's a six sense but by faith
[1:27:14] when he catches that word it sends
[1:27:18] him come on somebody your Revelation
[1:27:21] takes you from this Dimension to this
[1:27:24] that Dimension a dimension where you
[1:27:26] can't live right a dimension where you
[1:27:29] can't have hope to a dimension where the
[1:27:32] Rapture
[1:27:35] is oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:38] your faith set that destination well
[1:27:41] what is it faith says I'm Healed faith
[1:27:44] says I'm whole faith says I have a
[1:27:46] miracle faith says I have a
[1:27:50] right faith I'm Not Looking Through The
[1:27:53] Eyes of My emotions I'm Not Looking
[1:27:55] Through The Eyes of my feelings I'm
[1:27:57] Looking Through The Eyes of the vision
[1:28:00] of the word that Vision has set my
[1:28:04] destination my faith ain't on Le O my
[1:28:07] faith ain't on this world my faith ain't
[1:28:09] in this on these natural things but my
[1:28:13] faith my Revelation is in this
[1:28:18] word because all of your natural senses
[1:28:21] will fail you but faith will never fail
[1:28:24] fail you a vision will never
[1:28:27] fail a vision is thus sayith the Lord a
[1:28:31] vision can not
[1:28:36] fail the reason while I'm in this church
[1:28:39] is the
[1:28:40] Reon cuz I don't want to be lost the
[1:28:44] reason I'm in this church I got a reason
[1:28:47] to be
[1:28:50] here now maybe your faith don't see what
[1:28:52] I see but my faith says I'm going in a
[1:28:56] Rapture my faith says I'm going to make
[1:28:59] it I'm in a
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:07] vision I know a lot of times that we
[1:29:10] want to move the
[1:29:11] Hat we want to make things just work out
[1:29:15] we want to make it work we want to put
[1:29:17] this one Church we're going to put this
[1:29:19] we're going to bring this one in we're
[1:29:20] going to bring that prodical in we going
[1:29:21] to do this we going to do that but it it
[1:29:24] ain't our duty to move the Hat it ain't
[1:29:28] our duty to make things happen it's our
[1:29:30] duty to believe now the prophet said to
[1:29:33] believe the word is to receive the word
[1:29:35] and to let it become life and when you
[1:29:38] receive a word from another world you
[1:29:42] capture something that the world doesn't
[1:29:44] know nothing
[1:29:48] about so
[1:29:50] faith
[1:29:52] is our vision
[1:29:56] well give me an example brother Andrew
[1:29:57] I'm glad that I've got a line of them
[1:30:00] for
[1:30:01] you because John Ryan when he come
[1:30:03] through the prayer line S for ruanne he
[1:30:05] looked there and the prophet said you're
[1:30:08] healed and he went back out there and he
[1:30:10] was still Bri and brother John Ryan got
[1:30:13] back in that line and he stood before
[1:30:15] the prophet and the prophet looked down
[1:30:17] and he said you done been through here
[1:30:19] he said you said I was healed brother
[1:30:21] Rand said you said you believed
[1:30:25] he said by thus sayith the Lord you're
[1:30:27] healed and John Ryan went everywhere
[1:30:30] testifying that he had his vision
[1:30:33] back he had his vision back now maybe
[1:30:37] you don't see the message fully in the
[1:30:39] capture of the eyes Through The Eyes
[1:30:41] through the glass through the glass
[1:30:43] clearly but maybe you're still looking
[1:30:45] through it Darkly but let me put it to
[1:30:47] you like John Ry keep saying I'm Healed
[1:30:50] I'm Healed I'm
[1:30:52] Healed I got my eyesight I got my baby I
[1:30:56] got my healing I got my breakthrough I
[1:30:59] got my joy I got my restoration I got my
[1:31:02] dance I'm Healed I'm
[1:31:06] [Applause]
[1:31:11] Healed what was it his natural vision
[1:31:15] hadn't changed but his spiritual vision
[1:31:19] had maybe you don't see the baby coming
[1:31:22] maybe you don't see Abraham and sayah
[1:31:24] having a baby yet maybe you don't see me
[1:31:26] in the Rapture just yet but I want you
[1:31:28] to know there's a bride on Earth that
[1:31:30] her natural vision has stepped into the
[1:31:33] world of a spiritual
[1:31:34] vision and she's not identified with
[1:31:37] natural
[1:31:40] things come on your job's just a natural
[1:31:43] thing your work's just a natural thing
[1:31:45] your car is just a natural thing the
[1:31:47] things of this life are just a natural
[1:31:49] thing but we're not feeding on that
[1:31:54] if that was all our vision we'd surely
[1:31:55] be disappointed wouldn't we but I got my
[1:31:58] eyes on something
[1:32:01] else I ain't got my eyes on a failure I
[1:32:04] ain't got my eyes on mistakes I got my
[1:32:06] eyes on a cross I got my eyes on a
[1:32:14] lamb I love what brother brandom said
[1:32:18] and looking at the Unseen he said we
[1:32:19] used to see he used to in that old
[1:32:21] church used to sing this little song
[1:32:23] like this he said I've crossed that
[1:32:24] separating line and I've left the World
[1:32:26] Behind he said if there ever was a time
[1:32:29] that the church needs to step across
[1:32:30] that line which separates you between
[1:32:32] faith and unbelief by sight and look at
[1:32:34] the Unseen by faith it's
[1:32:38] now that's when you leave everything
[1:32:40] behind you every care every weary
[1:32:43] everything that says you can't be a
[1:32:44] Christian i've smoked too long I've
[1:32:46] drank too long brother brandom I've
[1:32:47] lived in adultery I don't care what you
[1:32:50] say I don't care what you done though
[1:32:53] your sins be a Scarlet you once you once
[1:32:56] pass that line of barrier of the devil
[1:32:59] trying to torment you say you can't do
[1:33:01] it you can't do it and say I can do it
[1:33:04] for Jesus said that whosoever will let
[1:33:06] him come and drink from the Waters of
[1:33:08] the Fountain of Life freely and leave it
[1:33:11] behind look at your neighbor said leave
[1:33:13] it behind leave your past in the past
[1:33:17] and put your future ahead of
[1:33:19] you the Bible said in 1 Peter 1:8 whom
[1:33:22] having not seen you love in whom though
[1:33:25] now you see him not yet believing you
[1:33:27] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[1:33:30] Glory receiving the end of your faith
[1:33:33] even the
[1:33:34] salvation of your
[1:33:37] souls is out in front of you it's out in
[1:33:41] front of you if you can line your vision
[1:33:43] up with the word there's a lot of people
[1:33:45] that's got eyesight there's a lot of
[1:33:47] people that's got Visions for the day
[1:33:49] there's a lot of people that's got goals
[1:33:51] that they call Visions but this bride is
[1:33:54] in prophetic vision and she's stepping
[1:33:56] in
[1:33:57] March she's stepping in line with it
[1:34:00] she's in line she's in line because the
[1:34:03] prophet told her get back in
[1:34:04] line and when the world tried to get her
[1:34:06] out of line she steps back in
[1:34:09] line because the prophet would say
[1:34:11] there's a well person in front of you
[1:34:14] you see I want to put it in your eyes
[1:34:16] tonight there's a well person in front
[1:34:18] of you the word already sees you healed
[1:34:21] the word wants to change your focus
[1:34:24] to his vision not your vision he said
[1:34:27] right out in front of you stands a
[1:34:28] person just like you just a few minutes
[1:34:30] ago you were sick down here but there is
[1:34:32] a well person standing there and Jesus
[1:34:35] Christ is calling to that well person
[1:34:38] right Beyond
[1:34:43] it I'm G to let you line up yourself
[1:34:46] right here I'm going to let you stand up
[1:34:48] and I'm going to let you recognize that
[1:34:50] there's a well person standing in front
[1:34:51] of you I don't care if it's your mental
[1:34:54] status I don't care if it's whether
[1:34:56] you're questioning a message or whether
[1:34:57] you need understanding on the message I
[1:34:59] want to put this in front of you that
[1:35:01] Jesus Christ is calling to a well person
[1:35:04] come on somebody we are a body of Jesus
[1:35:07] Christ and if you're out there on some
[1:35:08] far off limb you you are not a
[1:35:11] wellbody but Jesus Christ is calling to
[1:35:14] a wellbody he's calling to it he said
[1:35:17] now you just by faith as you close your
[1:35:20] eyes you walk right into that well body
[1:35:23] then just keep walking just keep going
[1:35:30] on if I could put it in the eyes that in
[1:35:33] front of Titus is a wellbody with no
[1:35:36] more meniscus tears no more
[1:35:39] surgeries as a prophet would say just
[1:35:42] walk right into it just walk right into
[1:35:45] it one of these days you're going to
[1:35:47] walk right
[1:35:49] into a body that cannot corrupt no more
[1:35:52] and you're just going to walk by Faith
[1:35:54] you're going to walk right into it
[1:35:56] you're going to walk right into
[1:35:59] it I know what I'm talking about it
[1:36:01] happened this week brother it just
[1:36:03] happened this week brother Chester my
[1:36:05] wife was sitting there
[1:36:07] praying sitting there praying and after
[1:36:11] after coming back from the meetings in
[1:36:12] in Canada or Washington there after much
[1:36:14] speaking I'd completely lost my voice
[1:36:17] and after last weekend I I was in bad
[1:36:20] shape Sunday and Monday I was bad shape
[1:36:22] I couldn't hardly talk sound like I had
[1:36:24] lar Andes I had to sing in a wedding on
[1:36:25] Thursday and I called my sister and said
[1:36:27] look you going to have to do
[1:36:28] it I ain't got a voice but while my wife
[1:36:32] was
[1:36:33] praying I felt a physical Touch come on
[1:36:37] my body and restore my voice
[1:36:49] back because I kept saying this how can
[1:36:52] they hear without preacher Lord and she
[1:36:55] started lining her prayer up and all of
[1:36:58] a sudden was standing out in front of me
[1:37:00] a wellbody and by prayer of faith I
[1:37:03] simply stepped into it now Jesus said
[1:37:07] with man this is impossible but With God
[1:37:10] all things are possible he said the
[1:37:12] Gentile way is to believe the word just
[1:37:16] like when Martha was down there at the
[1:37:17] grave and she'd met the word of God
[1:37:21] before she could ever see the miracle of
[1:37:23] God she had to believe the word of God
[1:37:25] and to act upon
[1:37:33] it I got somewhere I'm going but this is
[1:37:37] the right
[1:37:38] moment if you wouldn't mind playing that
[1:37:41] clip for me and turn the turn the volume
[1:37:47] up well come on
[1:37:50] somebody you might as well
[1:37:53] what's Shannon been praising the Lord
[1:37:55] about his son ain't even made it in the
[1:37:57] building but God has never discounted
[1:38:00] his faith he never asked him did you
[1:38:02] believe me he didn't question his faith
[1:38:05] he kept acting on it he kept believing
[1:38:08] it whether he seen it or whether he
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:13] didn't what are you doing I'm acting on
[1:38:16] my faith I'm beli
[1:38:20] it what is this brother Andrew it's a
[1:38:23] refreshing of the
[1:38:28] Dynamics one of these days you going to
[1:38:30] praise before you see it some of these
[1:38:33] days you going have to shout before you
[1:38:35] know
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:45] it that was one year
[1:38:48] ago today I had no idea I had had no
[1:38:53] idea but the word of the Lord woke me up
[1:38:55] this morning with them words brother
[1:38:57] Shannon and said you got to praise
[1:39:00] before you see it you got to act before
[1:39:03] you know
[1:39:05] it and he sent me that clip this
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:11] evening well he's in the building
[1:39:16] now come on
[1:39:18] Martha come on Martha before you see
[1:39:22] Lazarus you got to act upon it you got
[1:39:25] to speak it your vision has got to be
[1:39:29] fixed according to the word of the
[1:39:35] Lord come on
[1:39:37] somebody we've been waiting for this
[1:39:39] moment we've been living for this moment
[1:39:42] and we're
[1:39:43] here don't let it pass you
[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:39:49] by before you see the mountain before
[1:39:52] you see a roll way still speak to it
[1:39:56] make sure that the words that are coming
[1:39:58] out of your mouth are aligning with the
[1:40:00] vision that you want to
[1:40:03] see how many times did we ask brother
[1:40:06] Shannon how many times did we speak how
[1:40:08] many times did we
[1:40:11] praise we didn't see it but we was
[1:40:14] acting on
[1:40:15] it but now our faith has become sight
[1:40:35] I know you don't believe this I know
[1:40:37] some of you don't believe this but
[1:40:39] there's an angel in this room and he's
