viewing audience online but very thankful to have you here this morning so hope you enjoy yourself this morning and uh i tell you what last night i'll watch some of the most supernatural things i've ever watched in all of my life and i've stood in a lot of prayer lines with with our pastor and i'll be honest i don't remember one that he was able to stay through the whole entire one except for last night hallelujah that was jesus amen i was just i was in all of it all of all the victories that we've seen taking place and then the supernatural strength of the lord that would come and strengthen brother on i told him you're standing where somebody with stage four cancer has never stood before the angel of the lord is with us church and we are seeing him as he troubles the water amongst us we we want to make mention again that brother joe's uh camp meeting missionary camp meeting is cancelled and due to covet breakout there and different places in north carolina and tennessee just want to make mention of those things and i know that that's a hard decision brother joe had to make but we just want to be remembering remembering them also there's this would be news for you we will be canceling our labor day meeting uh brother donnie and brother tim and brother timothy won't be coming at this time due to brother tim and brother timothy's situation with sister karen and all that they have going on there and then also the cove would break out with brother don and just a lot going on right there but we're still going to be having church labor day weekend and if it's okay with you we're going to have a couple preachers that maybe you're accustomed to we're going to have brother ron spencer [Applause] i have brother ron speak on sunday morning myself saturday night and you know hey let's just i mean so we we're still going to be having labor day meetings we just can't publicize that brother reagan and brother pruitt be coming here we don't want anybody's hopes to get crushed having to listen to myself or brother ron but i tell you what i i believe that that just at any moment the coming of the lord is very near i believe the atmosphere is charged with the coming of the lord and we're here seeking seeking him this morning just wanting to draw closer to him and in every way possible amen let's just go to the lord in prayer this morning amen amen heavenly father we so love and appreciate you this morning what a mighty god that you are lord of the many mighty wonderful acts that we witnessed last night lord with our own eyes lord i personally feel the effects of even the angel's presence lord even now lord jesus and many many effects will go throughout this life just like a just like a rock when it hits the water it begins to send out an effect of where it came from lord last night there was a rock of testimony that went forth and i believe that the the ripple effect is driving away all things from your people lord not just now but in the coming days father i pray that you would bless your people minister to them in a very special way lord we pray for the strength of our pastor that you would restore it back to him lord lord jesus we've been blessed now father today is an opportunity lord jesus for you to come one more time with your word and begin to pour out your revealed word of this hour lord i pray god that you would just come in a very special way this morning may we see you high and lifted up every need amongst us every need on the other side of the internet lord the pruitt family the battle that they're facing we know that you're god over every situation you're our high priest and nor we ask father that you would take complete supreme control of this situation for you have preeminence in this service may every word that be spoken be anointed by you now father we submit ourselves under the work of the lord just now in jesus name we pray amen man if you have your bibles this morning we'd like to look over in the book of hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 just one one scripture reading this morning for yourselves but i'd like to i'd like to speak to you this morning on the atmosphere of the supernatural and i've been studying along these lines for many for many months now and you've actually heard a bit of it through through the the ministry and preaching of the word and just been building up some things and then then how the lord led and brother ron yesterday feeling uh to have the prayer line and then to look at these things on the atmosphere of the supernatural i just love how god lays out his work amen and i have to say uh you could line up things in your own human mind and how to set up a meeting of different things but i love it when the lord comes behind and brother branham said in the supernatural he said any person that ever came that come into the atmosphere one time will never be satisfied nowhere else one time in his atmosphere will never be satisfied nowhere else amen hebrews 11 and verse 6 but without faith it is impossible let's say that together impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's read that last part together that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord we know that that no man cometh to god except god first draws him and we we know that that that is one of the greatest things or one of the first things that must be done in worship is that you must recognize that that he is god it is the first thing that is required in worship and you find that throughout the bible that god has laid out his handiwork and laid out who he is all the way down throughout the the old testament and the new testament even over in deuteronomy chapter 6 and 4 he would say hero israel the lord our god is is one lord and before you can ever come to god you see he's got to do the drawing but he that comes must believe that he is and when you come to him you've got to believe that he is the self-existing one that he is the one that does all things and controls all things and what faith does is faith is faith is a substance of things hoped for it is the evidence of things not seen but faith breaks us from this world or in this realm of humanity into a world of into a world of faith and into an atmosphere where all things are possible you see in this world that we live in and in this atmosphere we live in there are a lot of things that are going on and even right now and different things but faith will take you into a heavenly sphere what faith does it transports you from this ground where where things are reasoned out it transports you from this ground where where things are seen and things are things are felt where things are sensed but faith takes you higher into a different world and even an astronaut when you begin to study and watch how an astronaut it what does it do it takes this world because he cannot live in that world but he has to take this atmosphere here up there so that he can live in it and you so that astronaut is built he is taking a trip and it's transporting him into another world and that's what faith is doing for the believer it takes him from this world into another world but something that is different from the astronaut and you is that you are built to live in the world of faith there's a lot of people that can't live up there there's a lot of chickens they can't fly where eagles fly at but you were built to fly into that atmosphere now there's a lot of people that can't follow you into that atmosphere there's a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of so-called or carnal believers that cannot follow the eagle where he goes but that eagle is a special built board of a bird that he has built to go up there and you know that you'll find that if you go to studying out eagles that eagles are a special built bird they're a heavenly bird they're they're testified throughout and laid throughout the old testament that that god even likes his prophets unto eagles that they're able to soar up into another level but you know that eagles actually mate in the sky you so so you see when you begin to watch that ego as he's going up into that atmosphere and if you get up in that atmosphere you'll realize real quick that you're not hooked up with a chicken up there but you're hooked up with somebody else that was built up there and if i want you to know this morning that if you get in that atmosphere one good time you'll find out that you're not hooked up with some denominational creed or some ideology but you're built up and hooked up and made it up with somebody that was built to take you up there because you are a special people that's ordained for the atmosphere of the supernatural and this this faith what it does it takes you from a realm of natural into a realm of the supernatural and we know and realize that the presence of god is essential for the supernatural to ever take place before there can ever be one miracle happen he's got to be present before there can be one change in your life he's got to be present before there could be one particle that fills these pews he's got to be present and what faith is doing it's taking you into an atmosphere where you were destined to be at he is the one that controls and understands and all of these wonderful works that he's doing he's the one that is controlling these things and breaking them over our life and the bible said when when you go to reading over in job chapter 37 when eli you became and he started talking to job and verse 14 he said hearken unto this old job stand still and consider the wondrous works of god dost thou not know when god disposed them and caused the light of this cloud to shine dost thou know the balancing of the clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge and here we look and we have a we have a very difficult life balancing out the different situations that come by our way the different trials but here god is able to hold on to those clouds and even though they're setting up there in that atmosphere and they're full of rain and they're full of buckets of water but god is able to balance it out so that they don't fall out of that atmosphere you see god so designed it that the cloud would stay where it was destined to stay at that the rain would hold in its pocket until god gets a time of release so and i want to tell you this morning get your rain barrels ready god has got the balancing of the cloud hanging over top of you this morning and i'm telling you to get your rain barrels ready god's getting ready to pour out a blessing upon you that you can't hardly handle and when he pours it out you can shake it down press together god's gonna do it because he's the one that controls the atmosphere this morning and your faith is moving into a realm even now where the spirit of god is present to come down that's why it's so important to enter into worship as the song leader is coming forth and bringing songs he's breaking the yoke of bondage by the power of music and god so annoys musicians and and song leaders that they can come in and sing a sweet song or a song of victory and it'll lift your faith into an atmosphere but you've got to believe that all things are possible no matter whether it's sinner or saint you've got to believe before you can ever begin to receive and when you go to look over in hebrews chapter 11 you will see that the that chapter is filled of people and characters of the bible that believed god trusted god obeyed god but do you know that the word faith was only found twice throughout the whole entire old testament you see they didn't have a bible to go by like you got they didn't got tapes to go by like you got but yet they knew how to find god they knew how to seek god they knew how to obey god they know how to find god and you realize that that this person that is diligently seeking after god they will go to any length any length at all to find god and obey his word it's like you and i if we would if we would lose our keys or lose our wallet we would go on to a search party we'd send out our family looking for something and when we find them the search is over but it's different when you go to seeking after god you can find god but yet they're still for more god for you to discover there's still more attributes of him for him to display in your life he's wanting to pour himself out and reveal himself like never before i want you to know that you can never grow tired on searching for god and seeking for god and if you have faith in the almighty god and accept this word you won't ever turn it loose for the bible told us in hebrews 10 and 23 to let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise that's what god is looking for is for somebody that won't waver off of the promises of the word there was a man that came to brother branham one time that had came from all the way from arkansas and brother branham was holding a meeting there i believe it was in memphis tennessee he was holding a meeting there and they this young this this man his girl was dying and she she was dying from pneumonia and the doctors told her told the dog the dad that she only had three hours to live and the man kept the daddy kept persistently asking brother branham to come and he kept kept asking him and he said well i can't leave this meeting i can't come right now i can't leave it but finally brother branham agreed to go and out on the road brother branham was going had some people that was driving him and brother branham said i was praying and the angel of the lord sat in the car with me just for a little piece and he said say to this say this to him thus saith the lord that waters are running clear ahead that's my word to give to him and brother branham said he went into the hospital room and he asked the parents if they would promise to serve god and to testify of him and what he is going to do and he said then thus saith the lord your girl is healed and three days later that little girl returned back to school now here's what he said he said but when the angel of the lord speaks like that there's nothing that can stand before it you see then then it's absolutely my faith well i know it's going to happen there's there's no need of saying anything more about it it's got to happen and he said if that person had been dead and in the grave for 20 years he'd say go there and speak he said i believe that all of heaven would shake out of its orbit before that prayer would ever be refused from being answered because god will do it that's when it's thus safe the lord so i what i'm trying to get this this this illustration or this event is that because a daddy wouldn't let go because a daddy would stay there persistently asking the prophet he would stay there and he was afraid to lose his daughter he was afraid to lose his loved one and so he put his faith into action and then the word that was spoken became god into action oh hallelujah and them that diligently seek him that's what i'm trying to get to you is that you got to go to seek him before the rewarder will come are you with me abel offered to sacrifice by faith he did but he had this testimony that he went on and his uh his offering was accepted enoch had this faith and it was he was not he was translated noah had this faith abraham had this faith but then the rewarder came after he sojourned in a strange land by faith isaac by faith jacob by faith joseph then the rewarder came the rewarder comes on the other side of the faith your prophet said give me a preacher give me a christian give me a housewife that's a christian give me a farmer a factory worker that'll put god first in everything in everything and i'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all that the devil can put on him he seeks god first i want you to think about that's more than just a quote that's more than just just something that somebody said but here's a prophet of the lord saying this that though that you give me this person you give me a housewife that's sitting right here in this house today sitting right here a farmer or a factory worker how many factory workers we got sitting here how many construction workers we got sitting here how many electricians we got sitting here you know your opposition you know you're you know what you do as a as an official or as a worker but you show me somebody that'll put god first and i'll show you somebody that'll be successful in spite of all that the devil puts on them go put them through the trials of life he's the one that balances the clouds and holds the reigns you show me somebody that knows how to seek god put him first above all things above their money above their health above their family above all things because they diligently sought him and i'll show you somebody that'll be successful that'll be successful in the kingdom of god that'll be successful as a husband that'll be successful as a factory worker that'll be successful as a christian no matter what the devil puts on them i'll show you somebody that the devil don't know what to do with because they put god first ah hallelujah proverbs 7 15 says therefore came i forth to meet me diligently to seek thy face and i have found me oh what a testimony this morning to say that i have found you i'd rather try too hard than to not try at all you see well i've looked i've looked one time and i looked and i've tried all my life the bible said that as a man thinketh in his heart so is he i'd rather shoot for the stars whether i hit a stump every single time i'm gonna keep shooting for the stars because i'm in this thing to win this thing i am not a loser i am not i'm not battled i'm not gonna give up i'm not gonna lose i'm in this thing to win this thing to be an overcomer to be a devil destroyer a serpent bruiser and i'm going to win this battle i'm going to overcome i'm going to make it i'm going to take it i'm going to press the battle i'm going to be that one that goes out of virginia i'm going to be the one that seeks god first [Applause] all things ought to be considered prayerfully first seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added i am positive sure this morning if men and women could get on could only get in that position of where their soul their thinking their attitudes would be perfect in the sight of god that would be one of the most powerful churches that have ever existed that's what you ought to do is give them your best give them your best of your life give giving the best of your songs give him all of your talent give him everything you got give him your feet give him your hands give him your eyes give him your mouth give him your ears give him your soul give him your heart give him your praise give everything you got hallelujah he's deserving of the best you believe that this morning now the bible says over in second peter 1 and 10 that wherefore rather brethren give diligence we understand what it means to be diligent don't we all right give diligence making your calling and your election sure you must you must be called or you will be defeated are you with me until you know these things you will be defeated you can come up against the enemy on your own and you'll be defeated but one time knowing who you are satan won't know what to do with you what is it it's because of where you're living at it's because of what you know who you are he said but if you do these things you shall never fall if you do these things you shall never fall well you say brother angel i just keep falling have you come through this line but if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and our savior jesus christ because you made your calling sure there has been an entrance made i want you to hold that before you this morning that there has been an entrance into his glory because you made these things joy and i want to say it to you like paul would say that in ii corinthians verse 14 but thanks unto god which always causes us to triumph in christ and making manifest the savior of his knowledge by every place in every place but i want you to know that there is a door open unto you that nobody else can walk into but the believer i want you to realize if you could set it before your imagination just now that there is a door to all the blessings of god that is set before the believer and you will not fall and you will not fail to get in that door because so an entrance has been ministered unto you and i want to preach to the church of the living god this morning that there's an entrance standing right here that there's an atmosphere that you are born to live in and all you got to do is take the steps of faith and walk right up to that door and you can knock down every devil that stands in your way tuberculosis can't hold you pneumonia can't hold you covered can't hold you you are ordained you're not going to fall off this way or fall off that way you're going to make it because god said i'm going to make a triumph of entry and you're going to have it by the abundance of almighty god come up here a little higher [Applause] i'm opening a door for you this morning some of you come through that line last night asking for the blessings of god i want to tell you that the blessings of almighty god on the other side of this entrance what a powerful thought for so an entrance hasn't been made but to think about that this atmosphere that we speak of that satan is the prince of the power of the air and he controls the atmosphere you remember when brother ron was speaking about it last night that daniel daniel had prayed and he stood there for 21 days and the prince of persia had resisted him had resisted michael from coming to his knee but this was what the angel said but i heard you the first time that you caught before you could ever get to the door he was already there now satan might be trying to hold him back but the angel came by your way and last night as i was standing there i watched the angel of the covenant come and open up a door and says enter in [Applause] [Music] but here he has controlled the atmosphere since the garden of eden since man was condemned and committed to sin all the heavens were shut off from mankind and satan being the prince of the power of the air you remember when isaiah said how art thou fallen o lucifer here was the one that had blocked up and controlled the atmosphere and no man was able to break in or understand where that power is over that atmosphere because that's what atmosphere means or heaven means it means the heavens or the atmosphere above and all of these powers was shut off because of sin that atmosphere that you're living in was shut off that atmosphere was held off because there was sin that was committed and though that there was sacrifices after sacrifices boxes and bulls that that had gave their life but yet man was not able to break in to that atmosphere because there was not a perfect sacrifice yet made but there came one that made an entrance so that you could go into that world so that prayers could break in past that atmosphere so that sin could be removed from your life and when jesus died and rose again there ain't never been anybody there was some people that had died lazarus had raised but there ain't everybody ascended back to where he came from and jesus said the son of man he is coming and he is ascending and here he is for the very first time 40 days after his resurrection here he is scene of 500 ascending into heaven and he broke that atmosphere so that you could go there and he broke every veil of sin he broke every veil of temptation he broke everything that could have been broke and he made an entrance when there was doom that was hanging over this earth hanging over the atmosphere he broke through that there was barriers that had to be broke so he could get through that thing but the blood made a way for him to get through it for you to come up to him because the entrance of the word of the lord said you're going to come through there to think that the atmosphere that you even feel now that you felt last night the old testament prophets don't know what this type of atmosphere is the anointing would come and the anointing would go but they never had an anointing like you got where the anointing would come and live and reign upon the throne of your heart and he would not leave you and he not forsake you but living in this type of atmosphere and realizing that you and i are amateur gods that you and i have the ability to create an atmosphere you ever been around somebody that's all the time all the time happy all the time on the rooftop you see they have found an atmosphere to live in there's some people that don't know they don't know which way is up and they don't know which way is down it's because of the atmosphere that they're living what kind of atmosphere are you creating if you're always bringing about strife and and fusses and all kinds of things i want you to know that temper breach temper and love breeds love and if you begin to let out some love out of your life you would start seeing love around you but if all the time you're fussing and bickering and got a temper to fight a buzz saw man alive you'll never live up here where you're supposed to be at but let the love of god one time come on your soul you'll find an atmosphere to live in where everybody around you on your job say hey hey something different about that man you and i will never know the effect of our atmosphere because of our atmosphere car wrecks can't happen because of our atmosphere jobs and companies are blessed because of our atmosphere car wrecks can't happen before because of our atmosphere restaurants are blessed because of our atmosphere factories are blessed because of your atmosphere there is somebody that's sitting beside you maybe an unbelief because of your atmosphere it so charges them to say hey if they can live that way i can live that way one time one time woodrow wilson went to go get a haircut he walked in there and he sat down and you know how a barber shop set up and there's all kinds of men sitting around it's a it's a great place it's a great place to hear some some of the best stories you ever heard in your life is that a barbershop ain't that right says heather you'll find out you'll hear some of the best stories that and here woodrow wilson walks into a barbershop there came a man in that set right beside him in the chair beside him and he had the same agenda that woodrow wilson had and that was to get a haircut and when he walked in there when he walked in there that man he he never he never really got out and started saying who he was but he began he said it wasn't preaching he said but the people that were sitting there in that barbershop were held spellbound by this man that he was sitting there and he was he was talking he said and woodrow wilson said he said i felt that when i left there that i had just left a worship service there were men that were sitting there because of this man and woodrow wilson said he said i sat there in my chair and after the barbershop just after that man left and i watched the influence of the people how that they were still spellbound and they were astonished at this man because of his speaking and that man nobody knew who he was nobody knew his name except for woodrow wilson and here set the white moody in that chair and because people people realize they didn't have to know his name but there was an atmosphere with the white moody that men would sit in a barber chair and they felt the atmosphere of the holy ghost charles finney was a great man of god he didn't have a church big enough to hold his crowds so he got himself up on a second story in a bay window and he started preaching the gospel of jesus christ he preached hell in such a way when men were two miles away on their way to work they dropped their pails of lunch boxes and they dropped and gave their life to the lord jesus christ because the atmosphere of the preaching of the word [Music] you remember when those doctors of divinity when they went over there and they were seeking after the welsh revival they were looking where the welsh revival was and he was walking down the street and there was a policeman that had a whistle in his pocket and he was just blowing it and spinning it around his finger and those doctors of divinity said hey we're looking for the welsh revival and that policeman said hey you're looking at it i am the west revival i've got it in my heart i went to god this morning that that would be the case that i am the bride's revival you're looking at it you ain't got to look for some day gone by you ain't got to look for william branham you're looking at the people of the bride's revival hallelujah [Applause] you're looking at it you're looking at it teachers when you walk into your school you're not just some another teacher lunch ladies you're not just another lunch lady principals you're not just another principal nurses you're not just another nurse you're a child of the most high god and there are angels that are packed around you that are protecting you and leading and influencing and you're bouncing into them all the time you watch somebody all of a sudden last night was perfect man i'll tell you you couldn't set this meeting up no better but last night i watched people bumping into an angel and all of a sudden you begin to see them break out under the influence of the angel what was it they were bumping into angels all day long and they broke into worship what was it he was standing right there the effects that you feel was because the angel was in the room and when the angels in the room the waters is troubled and all you got to do is step right on in you ain't got to wait for a certain season you ain't got to wait for another prayer line you ain't got to wait for another move of god let it come this morning you ain't got to wait for the preacher you ain't got to wait for the deacon you ain't got to wait here at church let it come in your home let it so influence you that you're not just having church at church but you're having church at home that the angels of god feel so welcome in your house that even in the midst of the worst of all the ages you can have this testimony that i please god devil's in for a bad day i just got hydrated you go to reading over in the bible and you begin to see the supernatural effects of when god comes on the scene it ain't just got to be an angel it could be a child of god that knows that there is a god when you go to reading over in second kings and you find that there was a captain a general by the name of lame naaman that was that was a leper here he was a great man here he was a great man in all of his stature but because of this hidden sin in his life he couldn't go to where he needed to go at but there was a little girl that had been taken that had been taken from her home she was an alien in another part of the world but yet she got under the influence of the atmosphere and the inspiration of god and there she spoke up this little maid spoke up and said i would to god that my servant naman was over in the country of samaria where there is a prophet now there had never been anything in the word that had spoke about elisha healing leprosy there ain't never been a word in the bible that said anything about elisha personally healing anybody but this girl was so influenced because there was a prophet in the land that she knew that there was a god of jacob and the god of abraham that was with elisha and you're gonna read in that chapter i believe it's chapter five you go to reading that and you'll see that naaman sent word to the king and the king rin is close you see there was a major difference in the atmosphere of the king of israel than there was in the prophet of israel what was it this little girl was under the atmosphere though she was in a foreign land she could still testify that there was a god that was more than able i'm not going to get caught up on what naaman had to do and to get what he had to dip seven times you know the story but this little girl brother branham he said you watched the force of that testimony the force of that testimony made naaman come out of his position of hiding that secret sin because of that little girl's testimony i'd say there's going to be some little girls that came through a prayer line last night that have a force of a testimony that they'll look out upon this leprous generation that's so full of sin that said hey i would to god that there would you come to this church where the prophet of god is still amongst us the prophet of the word is still discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart i'd say let the force of a testimony of a child be let loose in this place [Applause] it don't matter what sin you got in amen you can come all you got to do is just listen i'm talking about a testimony that'll make you get up out of your comfort zone get up out of what you think is normal and run i went to god that you come to where it's at hey some people it's afraid to come into a prayer line like last night you watch your spirits as they begin to get close to that prayer line you watch them start backing up because they're afraid that they're going to get exposed don't you ever walk in a prayer line with unconfessed sin because the word of the lord is still calling out sin you watch people that's got things hidden in their life you'll watch when the spirit of god comes and the atmosphere drops into place watch what takes place when i would be god you come up on up here where the water's real running real clear you ain't got to stay back here from devils you ain't got to stay back here from spirits you ain't got to stay back here you ain't got dipped seven times name it just come up here one time one time in his presence and you'll never be satisfied nowhere else you go when i watched a little girl feed about 16 17 years old by the name of sister emma holmes when the angel come into the water he began to trouble the water you watch the fire of the holy ghost fall and that fire in through this building it's the atmosphere of the holy ghost [Applause] what is it it's the atmosphere of a people that are believing it's the atmosphere of sons and daughters of god that are really realizing that all things are possible when you watch a drunk man that's a habitual offender every time it comes to a prayer line every comes to an altar gets drunk on the holy ghost and god speaks to him you know who you are you get drunk and god speaks to you and it renews you all over again what is it it's the effects of the atmosphere something's breaking something's breaking that plane breaks into a into another atmosphere where it can fly out there and when you go into a believing realm something begins to break i just got done going through the book of exodus in the leviticus and i've been studying on the tabernacle witness in the tabernacle of the congregation and i got to read i've been studying on these things and he got to looking over i got to looking over how the setup of of of the tent was set up and different things of how everything was in its order and there there was the outer courts and then the inner courts and then the whole these are holies and on the outer courts on the outer courts was where you had where you had the altar where you had the altar and there was a where the sacrifice was killed and the blood was taken out and everything was taken out of the sacrifice and the horns of the altar are there and he said but you realize and you can go to listen to i believe it's hidden life in christ and i believe it's 1955 56 you can go and listen brother madam if you want to hear it on tape he goes through those things and there there you see on the outside on the outer courts all day long it could be raining man out there but it could also be a bad day or it could be a good day out there but then you move on up into the inner courts there is what is called even determined or determined or termed the holy place and in the holy place there are three pieces of furniture there's the altar of incense there's the table of shoebread and then there is the seven golden candlesticks and you move up where the rain ain't falling where you're not having bad days but then you move up into that spot of sanctification but yet there's a smoke that rises up and your life gets all smoked up but you you see what you're doing you're coming from one atmosphere and into another atmosphere but the high priest that is uh that is able to walk into the next holies of holies into the place where only the high priest could go once a year he could walk in there and you know how he had to be dressed right how that everything they all had to be dipping and running off of him and he'd walk into there he'd walk into that realm and what i want to say to you is that when that priest would walk in there that that that that you couldn't hear anything on the outside it was it i believe brother brandon said that it was a it was soundproof but yet it was built in such a way that that when you walked in there and those golden bells and pomegranates were ringing the people on the outside would still be able to hear you worshiping god just to let them know that you weren't dead yet and when you got on the inside of there there was only one piece of furniture in the holies of holies and that was the ark of the covenant and on the inside of the ark of the covenant was an omer full of the original manna that fell down on the first day it was the original manner that fell down and every priest when he was ordained was able to walk into that hole he's a holiest and he was able to partake of the same original manna that aaron and moses ate on oh what a type of the day that we're living in that even in this hour you can walk into the same presence in the same atmosphere of that same holy ghost that fell down on the day of pentecost and you can partake of the good things of god what i'm saying to you is when you walk into that hole he's a holiest you're walking into an atmosphere where the devil can't get you come on somebody where you're living at up here in this atmosphere the church world don't know what to do with you and satan don't know what to do with that third pole ministry he can't impersonate that [Applause] you're living in an atmosphere where satan himself and all of his devils can't get to you sure they'll get to your spirit sure they'll get to your flesh but on your soul realm they can't touch one hair of your head you're living in an atmosphere of the supernatural where the miracles of god will be released in your life [Music] oh if you felt like i failed [Music] what kind of atmosphere are you talking about i'm talking about an atmosphere that when the daily new record get a hold of this thing what happened down there in elkjet oh come and see and taste and see that the lord is good oh in this atmosphere miracles are produced in this atmosphere the souls are saved in this atmosphere chains are broke in this atmosphere there is a presence of almighty god that'll make a little wesley stand up on his feet and take off running because it's the atmosphere of the supernatural it's an atmosphere that'll drive cancer out it's an atmosphere what babies will be producing it's an atmosphere where newborn babies will come to god it's an atmosphere that'll run every devil for cover it's an atmosphere that you won't leave here but it'll go with your home this kind of atmosphere raises up brain dead people this kind of atmosphere shuts hell up this kind of atmosphere brings god on the scene you're living where the devil can't get you oh hallelujah when solomon's temple had reached its completion and the ark of the covenant was being brought in the bible said in second chronicles 5 13 that it even that it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard and praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice and when the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the lord say for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god you know what i'm talking about he's well i would love to be there with solomon what are you talking about you were here last night you were here last night when everybody was in one mind in one accord that we will see prodigals come back that we'll see miracles poured out amongst us what are you talking about when that milky cloud of the holy ghost began to move in this place you didn't know what to do you couldn't handle your emotions but you just let yourself loose because of the atmosphere of the glory of the lord you look over in exodus i believe it's exodus 40. yeah it's exodus 14 35 he said moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode what showed up in this day in 1963 what didn't leave us that same cloud that'll keep you cool in the daytime out of that pillar of fire that'll keep you warm in nighttime what is it it is the darkest of days and you are here and he's here to make sure that you don't get cold and formal [Applause] i don't know about os let me tell you you move you move off of this atmosphere you stop producing miracles you move off of this atmosphere and you won't see a move of god come by your way well hey i don't i don't clap my hands that loud you ain't got to clap your hands you ain't got to shout but if you move out of the atmosphere of believing brother branham said that it's the hardest thing to do the hardest thing to do is to get people into the atmosphere of believing the hardest thing to do is to get them into the atmosphere of worship wow what are you living in when you see weekend after weekend when there's a people that believe hear me when you see people that walk into church and all of a sudden they start breaking past they're saying i know it's hard to do i know it'd be a whole lot easier to sit there in my pew and look like a bump on a pickle i know it's a whole lot easier to stay at home and sit on the couch i know it's a whole lot easier i know it's a whole lot easier for me to take a weekend off i know it's a whole lot easier but they're breaking past an atmosphere when a prophet would say it's the hardest thing to do you're a people that says hey hey i i know how to get there i i know i know where that door's at i know where that door is at and if i can just walk in there'll be an entrance ministered unto me one more time lord one more time lord one more time lord one more time lord let me walk in where you're at let me walk in where i don't know what to do let me walk in my john 4 and 23 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek as such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him him him in spirit and in truth in the patmos vision he says he said let me give you another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we we have all read it countless times but did not get it in the spirit when reading it did we ask god for his spirit to teach us the real truth of it he said if we did we'd call the elders confess our sins be anointed and pray for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit it is all over there is no other court of appeal god will fulfill his words oh we need to get in the spirit and the things will be done don't go through the acts first but get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do have you ever noticed how the world gets in the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games and their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers or old dried up sticks they enter in right into the field of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate the christians for getting in the spirit of god's word they call us fanatics and holy rollers there is nothing they want to do they they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that the critic won't matter there in his spirit but ignore that you can't accept it you you can expect it knowing where it's coming from but just go on and get in the spirit of worship oh my it's amazing when you go to a ball game don't sit there like a bunch of angels go to a ball game man alive it's it's 30 degrees outside but man they got their they got their chest painted up with their favorite teams colors they breathing out all kinds of smoke and they're just freezing to death but man do they get excited what are they under they're under the influence of the spirit of the ball games you know brother branham come against he come against a man one time he said he said i don't understand about all that hooping and a hollering that y'all got going on down there he said well he said he said well he said it's kind of like this but this man began to talk about a ball game he said you should have been there he said what was that noise i heard about he said i heard all kinds of noise he said oh you should have been at that ball game brother he said they hit that home run and they started screaming and hollering he said man the crowd went wide what was it they were under the influence of that ball game now when i go to a ball game brother andrew i sit there and i take notes and i don't get excited when my grandson hits a ball oh ain't that nice little johnny did a fine job don't you kid yourself don't kid yourself let me tell you one good time i my daughters don't play football but let me tell you they put on a pair of pads and they go out there and they knock somebody out you know what i'm gonna do that's my girl [Applause] reserve yourself remember where you're at what is it you get under the atmosphere of what you're under and some people don't understand why you act the way you act it's the atmosphere of where you're at you remember that time brother branham said he said he said that pentecostal people come up in my church he thought oh man they gonna turn my church into a tavern a tavern a tavern your prophet thought that these people are gonna turn my church into a tavern and he said i thought sat there he said and i seen him he said they got to play in that song there's going to be a meeting in the air he said then i looked down and my old methodist foot got to bouncing i know there's some preachers in the message that's afraid of all of this they're afraid of all this noise don't you worry we are turning this into a tavern where we got people that's trunk on the baptism of the holy ghost and if you let yourself loose one good time your old method is foot like to get the stomp in your feet brother branham said hey he said before i knew it i was out there in the house and i was dancing he said i seen that the devil had tried to take dancing and turn it around but dancing was in the bible when miriam seen that all of her demons had been defeated she began to dance what'd she get under the atmosphere of demons being defeated what were you under the influence of down there you're under the influence of demons leaving and the holy ghost coming what are you doing i'm waving that flag of victory oh what's going on that church down there they got victory over the enemy and the world came to me no harm well i got victory over the enemy and the world can't do me no harm [Applause] now you now you're almost there you're just almost there but you remember when the prophet when you read over in the bible and there was three kings they had went out to battle that was there was a king of edom the king of judah and the king of israel and they went on this battle and they had went a hundred miles without water three days without water and their their jehoshaphat being the only righteous one amongst them said hey is there not a prophet in the land and they started making their way to where the prophet's at let me tell you if you lost the well of water of life you need to go back you might hate me to say this you might be against me to say this but before you can ever have the water of life to overcome this day you have to go back to where the prophet's at [Music] this prophet has the well of pentecostal waters that'll bring a refreshing drink to the king of kings and these three kings took all their armies up there and they went up there to where the prophet was and when the prophet seen who was coming the bible said he was miffy he done got worked up and stood up and jehoram come up there the king of israel he looked at him he said why don't you get back down there yeah he would come up here for help man we'll come up here he said won't you get back down there to the gods of your mothers and fathers if they're so great why don't you get back down there if you think they can produce a rapture if you think they can produce a body change why don't you get back down there what are you doing up here for brother brandon said he doesn't got so stood up and worked up that he looked over there and said bring me a minstrel because the prophet knew what it was when the music got to play in that there was a spirit that came might have walked in here miffy at your wife i worked up because she made you late once again but let me bring you a menstrual and the prophet said that when the menstrual began to play that the spirit of the lord came and a vision broke oh if you can let it break in this place this morning when the music's going forward the hand of the lord will move over top of you and break down those formal shackles down when the spirit of the lord gets in the songs again when he gets in the praise again when he gets into preaching again something's about to change what is it i see the last one coming out of that red sea we're waiting on one it's not you sister caitlin you just happen to be the one walking down there young girl got a real touch last night we're looking for that last one to come out of there we're looking for that last seat what are you preaching like that for we're looking for the last one because when we get the last one over the red sea is gonna shut up and we're gonna leave and have an exodus out
