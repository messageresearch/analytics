[27:50] if you like so we supposed to I was
[27:53] supposed to do this last week make some
[27:55] just some reminders
[27:58] and things didn't work out so here we
[28:00] are this week so first of all I'd like
[28:03] to defend myself for my artistic work
[28:07] that I did during the date night because
[28:10] you know you really shouldn't judge a
[28:11] person by just one drawing really you it
[28:15] might be what you had to work with you
[28:17] know I
[28:19] me ain't that right
[28:22] Doug hey she's got brother brother
[28:25] William preach on Graces now she can't
[28:27] she she can't say nothing to
[28:30] me so so I mean just what I had to work
[28:34] with you
[28:35] know so
[28:37] so I got myself tickled here a little
[28:40] bit
[28:41] so so just some some some reminders here
[28:45] you know we we do this occasionally we
[28:46] don't do it often just you know nothing
[28:49] major just you know as we come in we
[28:51] want to come in find a seat and um you
[28:55] know not move around new talking you
[28:57] know if you need to talk somebody you
[28:58] know just tap them on the shoulder and
[29:00] step out on the porch you know because
[29:02] the VES is open now because you know the
[29:04] crowd and stuff so we we we made a so we
[29:07] could seat everybody so if you need to
[29:09] talk to somebody don't move from seat to
[29:11] seat before church after church it don't
[29:13] matter when it is just Peck them on the
[29:16] shoulder take them out on the porch and
[29:18] say hey carry the conversation on you
[29:19] know this is not a place that we want to
[29:21] do that at you know you know respect the
[29:24] house of the Lord this this is not a
[29:27] social Gathering now naturally it's a
[29:29] social Gathering spiritually so we don't
[29:30] want to we don't want to do things
[29:32] that's you know that disrupt the service
[29:36] or somebody else you know so after we
[29:38] just missed just a reminder you know
[29:41] kids keep keep up with your kids it's
[29:43] tight out here on this porch cars coming
[29:45] by cars backing up don't don't let your
[29:48] kids be playing out there you know we're
[29:50] going to watch over best as we can but
[29:52] it's not really our responsibility I got
[29:54] enough responsibility of two I got you
[29:55] know so so you know you know I got to
[29:59] keep an eye on them so so we we want to
[30:02] make sure we we we you know and and and
[30:04] even after the service is going on we we
[30:07] we we want to be reverent coming and
[30:08] going you know when when you leave try
[30:11] not to run back and forth because
[30:12] there's sometimes there's people still
[30:14] praising worshiping the Lord in the s in
[30:17] the in the building here so we don't
[30:18] want to we don't want to do nothing to
[30:19] disturb it so if your kids please we
[30:22] we've been trying to even lock the doors
[30:25] a little bit after everybody has a
[30:26] chance we're not rushing nobody out and
[30:29] and even when we get out on the porch
[30:31] you know try to give people room
[30:32] especially we you know everybody's not
[30:34] young like me so you know I can maneuver
[30:37] a little bit but we have we have elderly
[30:39] people here that that needs to to get in
[30:41] and out a little better than when I do
[30:44] so try try not to block the steps or the
[30:47] highway I mean we can walk around the
[30:48] corner of the building here and and give
[30:51] people room and especially when if it's
[30:52] not raining or nothing you know it's
[30:54] nice weather outside so just be reverent
[30:58] when we dismiss you know no talking no
[31:01] just if you need to talk again just just
[31:04] go outside and just do it you know try
[31:06] we try to you know we want to limit the
[31:09] amount of movement during the service
[31:11] amount of trips we go back and forth to
[31:12] the
[31:13] bathroom and just parents just keep your
[31:15] eyes on that and uh be responsible for
[31:18] them and then then also drivers when you
[31:20] come around you just need to be careful
[31:22] when you drive around you know because
[31:24] there you know some kids I know how kids
[31:26] are and I was a kid and into things you
[31:29] know sometimes you just take off not
[31:31] look that parents just as you drive
[31:34] around through there be be extremely
[31:35] extremely careful and and just we just
[31:39] want to do the right things and you know
[31:41] going back to you know this is not a
[31:43] place you go back to a social together
[31:45] where you come in and eat and drink and
[31:47] do things it's not a place you do that
[31:49] so you know just try to reverent the
[31:51] house of the Lord as much as possible
[31:52] this you know this is we don't want to
[31:55] be doing those things here in this in
[31:57] the
[31:58] service uh one other thing too is down
[32:01] here at the shed down here we call it
[32:03] the water building that's where all our
[32:05] water and stuff takes place as that we
[32:07] got timers and stuff on the the fall and
[32:09] waterfall down there and and for the
[32:12] water and heal so it won't dry and
[32:14] corrode away we try to keep the grass on
[32:16] that thing so when it rains it it don't
[32:19] corrode the hill out so we want to try
[32:21] to keep that grass growing so we're not
[32:24] telling you you can't use water but if
[32:25] you do use the water please let brother
[32:27] Adam know that so he can check that
[32:31] timer because we don't we have burnt a
[32:33] pump up somehow or another because maybe
[32:36] something happened I don't know but we
[32:38] burnt one pump up we don't want to so if
[32:40] you need water use it but please let
[32:44] brother Adam know so he can make sure
[32:46] everything is set back right and that
[32:48] everything is is functional there
[32:51] because we don't want to do anything so
[32:54] God bless you we love you do what's
[32:57] right for it's the right thing to
[33:07] do as we take up our offerings this
[33:09] morning uh I believe sister Emily
[33:12] Huffman has a special she'd like to sing
[33:15] after sister Emily brother Nathan Noel
[33:35] [Music]
[33:39] all the things that I held dear than it
[33:45] is that whispered in my
[33:49] ear what would I do if they are
[33:52] disappear
[33:57] which is in Fame in all that they could
[34:01] buy come to find they never s
[34:07] satisfied what would I gain if my soul
[34:14] surprised I don't want to love like the
[34:17] world
[34:18] loves I don't want to chase like the
[34:22] world does I only want you

[56:00] this morning amen let's just turn to the
[56:03] the scriptures let's turn to Isaiah 41
[56:06] and verse
[56:08] 10 now I I did this
[56:12] thought last last time I spoke on
[56:15] leadership and uh based it from uh
[56:18] Nehemiah so this morning we're going to
[56:21] uh kind of go over part two uh so you
[56:23] just bear with me this morning and if
[56:25] you didn't hear
[56:26] uh we pray that you go back and listen
[56:29] to it I not it was
[56:32] good just kidding just
[56:35] kidding but we just pray that uh that
[56:38] you would get something from that and
[56:39] draw from it but we'll kind of just
[56:41] recap some of those thoughts that we had
[56:43] there but Isaiah 41 and10 fear thou not
[56:48] for I am with thee be not dismayed for I
[56:52] am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I
[56:55] will help help thee yay I will uphold
[56:58] thee with the right hand of my
[57:01] righteousness aren't you glad that he's
[57:03] with you this morning and he's guiding
[57:05] you and he keeps you in Psalms 37 and
[57:09] verse 5 and it says commit thy way unto
[57:12] the Lord trust also in him and he shall
[57:16] bring it to pass that's what we want
[57:19] this morning don't we we want to commit
[57:21] everything to him amen God bless you you
[57:24] can be seated this morning God bless the
[57:26] reading of the word as I said I want to
[57:30] continue with leadership and maybe if I
[57:32] would title it leadership I want to I
[57:35] believe it would be subtitle it it's
[57:38] different
[57:39] now and when he
[57:41] comes he makes the
[57:43] difference so leadership and it's
[57:46] different now so this morning I would
[57:49] like to kind of just go over some of the
[57:51] thoughts that we had previously and uh
[57:55] if you would like to turn with me to
[57:56] Daniel 9 and verse
[58:05] 1 and in the first year of Darius the
[58:08] son of hus the seed of mes which was
[58:13] made King over the realm of the
[58:14] Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign
[58:17] ad Daniel understood the books the
[58:20] number of the years whereof the word of
[58:24] the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet
[58:26] Prophet that he would accomplish 70
[58:29] years in desolations of Jerusalem and I
[58:33] set my face unto the Lord God to seek by
[58:37] prayer and supplications with fasting
[58:40] and sooth and Ashes and I prayed unto
[58:43] the Lord God and he made my confession
[58:47] and said oh Lord great and Dreadful God
[58:51] keep thy Covenant and the mercy to them
[58:55] that love him
[58:57] and that keep his
[58:59] commandments so I know I I begin with
[59:03] Nehemiah and the reason why we read
[59:05] Daniel is because we want to understand
[59:08] that there was a prophecy that's being
[59:10] fulfilled here and that Nehemiah had to
[59:13] fulfill that prophecy so as I bring
[59:16] forth uh into uh remembrance some of
[59:18] these things Daniel
[59:21] understood that in 70 years desolation
[59:25] would be accomplished of the Jews and so
[59:28] that would
[59:30] begin the uh the wall preparation there
[59:34] and in verse 9 of Daniel or chapter 9
[59:38] verse 20 and it says and while I spake
[59:42] and praying and confessing my sin and my
[59:45] sin of My People Israel and presenting
[59:48] my supplication before the Lord my God
[59:51] for the Holy Mountain of my God yay
[59:54] while I was speaking in prayer
[59:56] even the man Gabriel whom I have seen in
[59:59] the vision at the beginning being caused
[1:00:02] to fly swiftly touched me about the time
[1:00:04] of the evening oblation and he informed
[1:00:07] me and talked with me and said oh Daniel
[1:00:11] I am now come forth to give thee skill
[1:00:14] and understanding so God is sending
[1:00:17] Angel Gabriel there to Daniel so that he
[1:00:20] can have understanding of the scriptures
[1:00:22] of what Jeremiah prophesied
[1:00:26] cuz the Jeremiah Pro prophesied in
[1:00:29] Jeremiah 25:11 and said this whole land
[1:00:33] shall be desolate and astonishment and
[1:00:36] the Nations Shall Serve the king of
[1:00:38] Babylon for 70 years see this is the
[1:00:41] prophecy and Daniel is understanding it
[1:00:44] from what Gabriel is explaining here and
[1:00:46] it shall come to pass when 70 years are
[1:00:50] accomplished that that I will punish the
[1:00:53] king of Babylon and that Nation saith
[1:00:56] the Lord for their iniquity in the land
[1:00:59] of the Chaldeans and I will make thee a
[1:01:02] Perpetual desolation and I will bring
[1:01:05] upon on that land and all my words which
[1:01:09] I have pronounced against it even all
[1:01:11] that is written in this book which
[1:01:14] Jeremiah hath prophesied Against All
[1:01:18] Nations for my Nations and great Kings
[1:01:22] Shall Serve themselves of them also and
[1:01:25] I will recompense them according to
[1:01:27] their deeds according to the works of
[1:01:29] their own hands for thus saith the Lord
[1:01:32] God of Israel unto me take the wine cup
[1:01:36] of this pure at my hand and cause all
[1:01:39] nations to whom I send thee to drink it
[1:01:43] and they shall drink and be moved and be
[1:01:46] mad because of the sword and I will send
[1:01:50] among them so we understand that
[1:01:53] Jeremiah has prophesied this Daniel is
[1:01:57] understanding the prophecy and has the
[1:01:59] vision
[1:02:00] thereof and he goes on down here and
[1:02:04] forgive me for jumping back and forth
[1:02:05] but I want you to understand this this
[1:02:07] morning and it
[1:02:10] says at the be and 70 weeks are
[1:02:12] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[1:02:15] Holy City to finish the transgression
[1:02:18] and to make an end of sins and to make
[1:02:20] reconciliation for iniquity and to bring
[1:02:23] Everlasting righteousness
[1:02:26] and to seal up the vision and prophecy
[1:02:29] and to anoint the most holy for
[1:02:31] therefore and understand that from the
[1:02:34] going forth of the Commandment to the
[1:02:37] restoration to and to build Jerusalem
[1:02:40] see we here we're we're going to that
[1:02:42] building of that unto the Messiah the
[1:02:45] prince shall be 70 weeks three score two
[1:02:49] weeks the street shall be built again
[1:02:54] the wall even in trouble times and after
[1:02:57] three score two weeks shall the Messiah
[1:03:00] be cut off who are we speaking of here
[1:03:02] Jesus and what it's talking about is
[1:03:05] from this time and we know that from
[1:03:07] that time on it is believe it's 486
[1:03:11] years or 386 years I might have wrote it
[1:03:13] down
[1:03:15] anyways from the time from the wall
[1:03:17] being built until Messiah is coming off
[1:03:20] the Mount of Olives so he shall be cut
[1:03:24] off shall be cut off but not for
[1:03:28] himself and the people of the prince
[1:03:30] that shall come shall destroy the city
[1:03:33] and the sanctuary and the end thereof
[1:03:36] shall be the flood and unto the end of
[1:03:39] the war desolation determined and shall
[1:03:41] confirm the Covenant for one week and in
[1:03:45] the midst of the week he shall cause the
[1:03:48] sacrifice and the oblation to cease and
[1:03:51] the overspreading of the Abominations
[1:03:54] and he shall make it desolate
[1:03:56] even unto the consummation that
[1:03:58] determined shall be poured upon the
[1:04:01] Desolation and we go I'm sorry to be so
[1:04:04] scripturally and quota this morning but
[1:04:07] just bear with me on all these things
[1:04:10] amen do you love the Lord amen and in
[1:04:12] Matthew 24 where the Messiah is and this
[1:04:16] Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached
[1:04:19] into the all the world for witness unto
[1:04:22] all
[1:04:23] nations and then shall the end come and
[1:04:27] when ye therefore shall see the
[1:04:29] abomination of the Desolation spoken by
[1:04:33] Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy
[1:04:36] place whosoever readeth let him
[1:04:40] understandeth am aren't you thankful for
[1:04:42] that this
[1:04:43] morning that through God Daniel was able
[1:04:47] to understand the prophecy from Jeremiah
[1:04:50] and through that when Nehemiah began the
[1:04:54] wall he understood
[1:04:57] it's not just a wall being
[1:04:59] built God could have created a wall out
[1:05:01] of nothing he's God he can do that but
[1:05:04] what was it it was Nehemiah he had a
[1:05:07] burden on his heart so God had created
[1:05:10] that burden upon his heart he gave him
[1:05:12] the means to be able to build the wall
[1:05:14] through the king he went and build the
[1:05:17] wall now he had a lot of things that
[1:05:19] didn't go his way A lot of things that
[1:05:21] come up against him but he continue on
[1:05:24] because he had a word from the Lord and
[1:05:26] so Nehemiah wasn't just building a wall
[1:05:30] he was bringing the Israelites back
[1:05:33] together and bringing the identity to
[1:05:35] the Jews back again you understand that
[1:05:39] and we're thankful for that this
[1:05:41] morning and so Nehemiah and the reason
[1:05:44] why we choose Nehemiah is such uh so
[1:05:46] many leadership things that is in there
[1:05:49] but leadership is not merely an
[1:05:52] upholding of position or authority it's
[1:05:55] in inspiring others to reach their full
[1:05:58] potential and guiding them through
[1:06:00] challenges so Nehemiah had to be able to
[1:06:05] have an understanding of what the people
[1:06:07] went through he was one of them that was
[1:06:10] family that was friends that was a
[1:06:13] burden upon his heart now many times
[1:06:17] it's easy to to have people to do
[1:06:21] something that they want to do amen it's
[1:06:24] easy to PE lead people to places where
[1:06:27] they want to go that's easy but it's
[1:06:30] hard to lead people to places that's
[1:06:32] hard that's tough amen if I ask brother
[1:06:37] Nathan I said brother Nathan me and you
[1:06:39] we're going for Crispy
[1:06:41] Cream he's going to come with me we're
[1:06:43] going to enjoy it I call him up the next
[1:06:46] day and I say hey brother Nathan we're
[1:06:48] going to go over to Smileys man it's
[1:06:51] good that's some good stuff right there
[1:06:54] amen and then and then maybe the next
[1:06:57] day I say you know what I'm craving a
[1:06:58] steak let's go to Longhorn you like
[1:07:00] Longhorn I like Longhorn let's eat a
[1:07:02] steak he's like man I'm loving this yeah
[1:07:06] absolutely and then I call Nathan up in
[1:07:08] about a week and I say hey brother
[1:07:10] Nathan now Smileys Crispy Cream and that
[1:07:13] steak that's it's putting on some pounds
[1:07:15] here for me but let's go to the
[1:07:19] gym let's go run a mile let's go work
[1:07:23] out now it might not not work out for
[1:07:26] Nathan to go that
[1:07:29] day he he might say you know what I got
[1:07:32] things I got to do and something just
[1:07:35] come up it's easy to lead people where
[1:07:39] it's easy to
[1:07:40] go it's hard to lead people on things
[1:07:43] like that things like work going to
[1:07:46] church hey it was a struggle this
[1:07:48] morning to get up fix your tie getting
[1:07:50] all nice and pretty some of you drove
[1:07:52] several hours to be here
[1:07:55] you had a little skin in the game this
[1:07:57] morning amen so it was a little bit
[1:08:00] tough but hey you're here God LED you
[1:08:04] here he placed you here in this position
[1:08:06] this morning aren't you glad of that
[1:08:15] amen true leadership is not found in
[1:08:18] titles or Corner offices it's found in
[1:08:21] actions in the willingness to take
[1:08:23] responsibility and in the courage to
[1:08:25] make tough decisions for the greater
[1:08:28] good it's not always
[1:08:30] easy a good leader listens more than he
[1:08:33] speaks understands more than they judge
[1:08:36] and empowers more than they control they
[1:08:39] lead by
[1:08:41] example setting high standards of
[1:08:43] Integrity honesty and humility
[1:08:46] leadership is about building trust
[1:08:49] creating a shared vision and real and
[1:08:51] rallying people around a common position
[1:08:55] and purpose it's about recognizing the
[1:08:58] strengths of each individual and
[1:09:00] leveraging each of them to achieve their
[1:09:04] success now we're not all built the same
[1:09:07] and as I went through Nehemiah last time
[1:09:11] we found that certain people will do
[1:09:13] certain jobs at certain times sometimes
[1:09:16] they'll go over and Beyond sometimes
[1:09:18] they'll do what is just necessary
[1:09:22] amen so you have to recognize there's
[1:09:25] some people that will do that there's
[1:09:28] some people that won't some people that
[1:09:30] you're going to have to just hey we can
[1:09:32] do this you got this you're going to
[1:09:33] have to cheerlead them on a little bit
[1:09:35] more and then there are some that you go
[1:09:37] hey I need you to go do this and they do
[1:09:39] more than what you asked them to and
[1:09:40] you're like
[1:09:42] Wow Come on
[1:09:46] Amen and so that's that's leadership and
[1:09:49] that's being able to recognize each and
[1:09:51] every individual's purpose and what
[1:09:53] they're going to fulfill in life amen
[1:09:56] not all of us is going to be doctors not
[1:09:58] all of us going to be lawyers not all of
[1:10:00] us is going to be junk dealers or
[1:10:02] truckers or we got a lot of nurses in
[1:10:05] here I like I said before I'll hold junk
[1:10:08] now for 11 so you have to find your
[1:10:11] position and what you can do amen so
[1:10:16] Nehemiah helped them to be able to
[1:10:18] accomplish that goal and so I had
[1:10:21] brother Nath Nathan come up here and I
[1:10:24] had my sword And my trial out in my
[1:10:27] hands and we worked and we worked
[1:10:30] together as a bride Believers and that's
[1:10:34] what we're here this morning is we're
[1:10:36] working in a Collective Agreement that
[1:10:38] Jesus Christ is coming again and we're
[1:10:41] working towards a goal this morning amen
[1:10:44] and then there was times that now I
[1:10:46] couldn't work with one hand and fight
[1:10:48] with the
[1:10:49] other and I had to give the sword over
[1:10:52] to brother Nathan and I said brother
[1:10:54] Nathan I trust you to have my back at
[1:10:56] this time at this moment cuz I'm going
[1:10:58] to I'm about a great work but I need you
[1:11:02] to be there with
[1:11:03] me he had my back and many times we're
[1:11:08] going to have to have each other's back
[1:11:11] in life there's things that'll come up
[1:11:13] and and you'll have to call a saint and
[1:11:15] be like listen I need some prayer over
[1:11:18] this right now and I know that you're a
[1:11:20] prayer Warrior and you have my back on
[1:11:22] this you don't even have to tell them
[1:11:24] all you just know that they're going to
[1:11:25] go to prayer fervent prayer over your
[1:11:29] thing what you're Desiring at that
[1:11:32] moment and so Nehemiah was a great
[1:11:35] leader into to be able to do those
[1:11:37] things and
[1:11:39] so they got ridiculed mocked and Scorn
[1:11:43] over it all and so I kind of want to
[1:11:45] start this morning in in
[1:11:50] that the opposition and ridicule that
[1:11:54] was given to them
[1:11:56] and we went over this a little bit but I
[1:11:58] want to Major this morning on these
[1:12:01] facts and Nehemiah in chapter 4 and 1 it
[1:12:05] said and it came to pass that when Sam
[1:12:06] ballot heard that we build it the wall
[1:12:10] he was rough and took great indignation
[1:12:13] and mocked the
[1:12:14] Jews they are just building the wall and
[1:12:18] he's criticizing them mocking
[1:12:21] them in verse two and he spake before
[1:12:24] his brother Brethren and the army of
[1:12:27] Samaria and said what do these feeble
[1:12:30] Jews and what they' fortify themselves
[1:12:35] will they sacrifice will they make an
[1:12:37] end in a day will they revive the stones
[1:12:41] out of the heaps of the rubbish which
[1:12:43] are
[1:12:44] burned now I want you to notice
[1:12:48] something Sam
[1:12:49] ballot is is speaking to people that is
[1:12:53] on his side
[1:12:56] that is in his community in his little
[1:13:00] group and he's making fun of them and
[1:13:03] he's mocking them what are they going to
[1:13:05] do restore these stones out of the
[1:13:07] rubbish oh they're burned what what can
[1:13:10] these feeble Jews
[1:13:11] do and so he was talking amongst his
[1:13:14] Brethren there now toath the ammonite
[1:13:18] was by him and he joined in with him and
[1:13:21] he said even that which they build if a
[1:13:25] fox go up he shall even break down their
[1:13:28] stone
[1:13:30] wall them people
[1:13:32] Jews a little fox as as gentle and good
[1:13:38] as he is he would just tear it down just
[1:13:39] running up over that thing D y'all crazy
[1:13:43] trying to make a wall like that y'all
[1:13:45] can't build nothing I mean you got
[1:13:47] brother alen painting back
[1:13:52] here look look and just make so much fun
[1:13:56] but I want you to understand that they
[1:13:57] was making fun in their little group
[1:14:00] they was criticizing in their little
[1:14:02] group and it is easy when you criticize
[1:14:06] with people that are
[1:14:08] critical and you're not going to go CR
[1:14:10] criticize with somebody that's behind
[1:14:12] the whole work and let's get to it we're
[1:14:14] going to do a work you're not going to
[1:14:16] go to somebody and criticize the work
[1:14:18] while they're doing the
[1:14:20] work I I have found that over and over
[1:14:23] again a Critic will be a Critic no no
[1:14:25] matter where you're at and he will find
[1:14:27] people in his little group that they can
[1:14:30] criticize about and most of the time and
[1:14:34] I want you to understand if they
[1:14:35] criticize at home across the kitchen
[1:14:38] table the children hear it and the
[1:14:42] children become critical amen and then
[1:14:45] the children grow up and they say well
[1:14:47] Mom and Dad was critical of this I don't
[1:14:50] need that and what have you done you
[1:14:53] have caused them to be critical IAL and
[1:14:55] criticize things that they don't even
[1:14:57] understand
[1:14:59] about now you may make it through but
[1:15:02] they might
[1:15:03] not they might not know what they're
[1:15:06] criticizing about they don't know they
[1:15:08] don't understand so be careful what
[1:15:11] you're saying and being critical of well
[1:15:15] it's hot in the church it's cold in the
[1:15:17] church he's way too loud I can't hear
[1:15:19] him at
[1:15:20] all they took my parking spot they took
[1:15:23] my seat
[1:15:25] what are we here for now we're we're not
[1:15:28] I'm not going to ask you
[1:15:31] amen we're here for a
[1:15:34] purpose we're not building a wall this
[1:15:37] morning I've not asked you to do manual
[1:15:39] labor I've just ask you to get behind
[1:15:42] the word help me this morning amen we're
[1:15:45] about our father's business this
[1:15:48] morning
[1:15:51] amen and in Moses brother Brandon would
[1:15:53] say and without a leader we are helpless
[1:15:57] and Christ is our leader and God was
[1:16:00] Moses's leader though he sent an angel
[1:16:03] to lead him I send my angel before thee
[1:16:07] to keep thee in the way and bring thee
[1:16:09] in the place which I have promised and
[1:16:12] the angel was to be a leader to be his
[1:16:15] leader the angel performed Miracles
[1:16:19] Moses never performed any Miracle the
[1:16:22] angel of God in Moses performed the
[1:16:25] miracle and you see what I mean the
[1:16:29] angel of the Lord was with him he's with
[1:16:32] you this morning the angel LED them and
[1:16:36] performed the Miracles hey he's with you
[1:16:38] this morning the angels are guiding you
[1:16:41] this morning he's encamped about you
[1:16:43] this morning aren't you thankful for
[1:16:45] that that we have an angel in this age
[1:16:48] that has given us the message that has
[1:16:50] leading us through this Dark Age this
[1:16:53] age of leadsa
[1:16:54] he's leading you this morning he's not
[1:16:57] going to leave you comfortless God is
[1:16:59] with you this
[1:17:01] morning so there's always going to be
[1:17:03] criticism from people around you and I
[1:17:06] love this quote brother Doug you're
[1:17:09] going to like this man in the arena
[1:17:10] Theodore
[1:17:12] Roosevelt I love this this is one of my
[1:17:16] favorites the poorest way to face life
[1:17:20] is to face it with a sneer there are
[1:17:23] many men who feel a kind of Twisted
[1:17:25] pride and cynicism there are many who
[1:17:28] confine themselves to criticism of the
[1:17:31] ways others do what they themselves dare
[1:17:35] not even
[1:17:37] attempt there is no more unhealthy being
[1:17:40] no man less worthy of respect than he
[1:17:44] who either really holds or FS to hold an
[1:17:48] attitude of sneering and disbelief
[1:17:50] toward all that is great and lofty
[1:17:53] whether in achievement or in that Noble
[1:17:56] effort which even if it fails comes
[1:17:59] second in
[1:18:02] achievement it's not the critic who
[1:18:05] counts not the man who points out how
[1:18:09] the strong man stumbles or where the
[1:18:11] doer of Deeds could have done them
[1:18:13] better the credit Belongs To The Man in
[1:18:17] the arena right amen whose face is
[1:18:21] marred by dust and sweating blood who
[1:18:24] strives ently who HS who comes short
[1:18:27] again and again because there is no
[1:18:29] effort without Heir and shortcoming but
[1:18:33] who does actually strive to do the Deeds
[1:18:36] who knows great astonishment enthusiasm
[1:18:40] excuse me the great devotions who spends
[1:18:44] himself in a worthy cause who at best
[1:18:49] knows at the end of the Triumph and high
[1:18:52] achievement and who at the worst if he
[1:18:56] fails at least he fails daring
[1:19:00] greatly so that his place shall never
[1:19:05] his place shall never be with those cold
[1:19:08] and timid Souls who neither know Victory
[1:19:12] nor defeat amen Give the Lord a hand
[1:19:16] clap of Praise this
[1:19:18] morning we're not in the seat of the
[1:19:21] scornful this morning we're not in the
[1:19:23] seat of this critic this morning because
[1:19:26] the critic don't count you count for
[1:19:28] something this morning you're about
[1:19:31] something this morning congratulations
[1:19:33] you're making a difference this morning
[1:19:39] amen
[1:19:42] glory sir them poor and timid Souls that
[1:19:45] know no Victory nor defeat they don't
[1:19:47] know what it's like to step out and say
[1:19:49] I'm going to take on this storm head
[1:19:52] on but you do
[1:19:55] each and every one of you has been
[1:19:56] through a lot each and every one of you
[1:19:59] could say how in the world did I ever
[1:20:01] get to this position this seat where I'm
[1:20:04] sitting at this morning how did I get
[1:20:06] here cuz you've been through many things
[1:20:09] many tolls many dangers but you've
[1:20:12] overcome amen and granted to thee that
[1:20:15] overcome amen there's going to be a
[1:20:17] kingdom for each and every one of
[1:20:20] us amen so as we speak on these things
[1:20:24] this
[1:20:25] morning it's a character building those
[1:20:28] critics will create character in each
[1:20:31] and every one of
[1:20:33] you and a lot of times you don't even
[1:20:35] listen but sometimes you
[1:20:38] go okay you know what if that's the
[1:20:42] case like Nehemiah did there was a point
[1:20:46] and a time when they was fighting with
[1:20:48] sword and
[1:20:50] trial to create
[1:20:52] something and they said you know what
[1:20:54] we're going to have have to you know
[1:20:56] what I'll
[1:20:57] do when the trumpet sounds you gather
[1:21:00] over
[1:21:01] here because there is a wink link right
[1:21:05] there so sometimes you take and go you
[1:21:07] know what maybe that that was a good
[1:21:14] point but brother Brandon would say it
[1:21:17] like this in
[1:21:19] influence and I believe if a nation
[1:21:24] or a people or a church or an individual
[1:21:27] no matter how much the critics criticize
[1:21:31] you just do the right
[1:21:33] thing just do the right thing no matter
[1:21:36] how much they criticize no matter what
[1:21:38] they say what they do do the right thing
[1:21:42] and he says they have to have respect
[1:21:44] for you
[1:21:45] anyway right down in their heart he
[1:21:48] Saidi found that to be true see be
[1:21:51] honest and be upright people
[1:21:55] and they will respect
[1:21:57] you just do the right thing as brother
[1:22:00] Alden says you do the right thing and
[1:22:01] the right thing gets
[1:22:02] done
[1:22:05] amen so with that Integrity that
[1:22:09] devotion in your life that says you know
[1:22:11] what no matter what happens I'm going to
[1:22:14] do the right thing no matter who
[1:22:16] criticizes let me just do the right
[1:22:21] thing and you will be an influence
[1:22:24] an influence is the capacity to have
[1:22:28] effort on character development or the
[1:22:31] behavior of someone or
[1:22:34] something or the effect in itself so you
[1:22:38] have great influence this morning each
[1:22:41] and every one of us has influence about
[1:22:47] us I enjoy uh college baseball and one
[1:22:51] of the college baseball coaches that I
[1:22:54] enjoy listen to in their speeches is uh
[1:22:58] head coach Tim Corbin from
[1:22:59] Vanderbilt and I get a lot of good
[1:23:02] inspiration from him I'm raising a young
[1:23:06] man and so I I look at what other people
[1:23:10] are doing to create leaders in their
[1:23:12] Community how are they doing that what
[1:23:15] are they doing and so Tim Corbin tells a
[1:23:18] story of character about a man that or a
[1:23:23] boy while he was a coach at Clemson he
[1:23:26] went and the head coach told him said I
[1:23:28] want you to go recruit this guy he's
[1:23:31] great great athlete he's going to do a
[1:23:32] lot of good things and we want him said
[1:23:35] all right so he went and he watched him
[1:23:38] and he said I like to get to the games
[1:23:40] early just so I can see how they
[1:23:41] interact how they do things what they do
[1:23:44] he said so when I got to the game I
[1:23:47] watched this this kid that we was there
[1:23:49] for
[1:23:51] and he was by
[1:23:53] himself didn't really interact with his
[1:23:56] team a lot had to go try to find
[1:23:58] somebody just to warm up he said so I
[1:24:02] thought well that's kind of odd that's
[1:24:03] kind of odd that he would do something
[1:24:04] like that you know great athlete like
[1:24:07] this a lot of time the athlet is one of
[1:24:09] the more popular ones or the leaders on
[1:24:12] their
[1:24:13] teams and so then it come to his Bat and
[1:24:17] his at bat and he was on deck and he
[1:24:19] said that he looked up at his mom in the
[1:24:22] stands and he went like this and said
[1:24:24] and so his mom thought okay well I'll
[1:24:26] bring him his Gatorade and so his mom
[1:24:28] walked down the steps went and handed
[1:24:31] his Gatorade over to him said she kind
[1:24:34] of struggled to do it but she did it and
[1:24:36] said he got it and he took a drink of it
[1:24:38] barely put the cap back on and just
[1:24:40] tossed it over to her like whatever
[1:24:43] never said Thank you never said I love
[1:24:46] you never had no interaction just didn't
[1:24:49] respect her and he
[1:24:51] said you know what I think I'm done
[1:24:54] I think I'm done he said we continue to
[1:24:57] watch this kid and he had a great game
[1:24:59] wonderful
[1:25:01] game and he goes back to the head coach
[1:25:04] at Clemson and the head coach at Clemson
[1:25:06] says what do you think he
[1:25:10] said oh he's a great
[1:25:12] athlete he's going to get a full ride
[1:25:15] somewhere definitely D1 great great
[1:25:19] that's what I thought you was going to
[1:25:20] say he said
[1:25:22] but I'm going to tell you no don't go
[1:25:25] after him don't even don't even waste
[1:25:28] your time on this guy he said because he
[1:25:30] lacks
[1:25:32] character he lacks character he said and
[1:25:35] if he will disrespect his teammates his
[1:25:38] coaches his own mother he will not have
[1:25:41] any respect for
[1:25:43] you none he said you know what the head
[1:25:48] coach of Clemson he said I have enough
[1:25:51] trust in you that I'm going to okay so
[1:25:54] they let him go they didn't even recruit
[1:25:56] him no more he went to a D1 college he
[1:26:01] got drafted out of out of college within
[1:26:05] the first round and he said he went on
[1:26:08] to
[1:26:09] go and play
[1:26:12] on several several several several
[1:26:16] teams and see what happened was is that
[1:26:19] kid never learned character and respect
[1:26:23] for others
[1:26:24] so he never was able to get along with
[1:26:28] anyone and so I want you to understand
[1:26:30] this morning people are watching
[1:26:34] you watching you from a distance
[1:26:37] watching how you respect others what
[1:26:39] will you say to others how will you do
[1:26:42] things that's
[1:26:44] influence that's influence young people
[1:26:48] when you
[1:26:49] may kind of speak at your mom or say
[1:26:52] something to your dad real harsh
[1:26:54] there's going to be somebody that sees
[1:26:56] that and
[1:26:58] go I don't want to have no part with
[1:27:01] that and especially other parents when
[1:27:03] they see a child do or say something
[1:27:05] about that kid says something about
[1:27:07] their own they don't want their children
[1:27:09] to hang out with those type of
[1:27:11] children because they don't want them to
[1:27:14] take on those characteristics and that
[1:27:18] influence amen because there is great
[1:27:21] influence in each and every Act
[1:27:24] and everything that you
[1:27:26] do
[1:27:28] amen and brother Brandon would say it
[1:27:30] like this unless we suffer with him we
[1:27:34] cannot reign with him you have to suffer
[1:27:37] to Reign the reason for this is that
[1:27:41] character simply is never made without
[1:27:45] suffering you're going to have to go
[1:27:47] through some tiles and trials and test
[1:27:49] in your life character is a
[1:27:52] victory character is a victory
[1:27:54] it's not a
[1:27:56] gift a man without character can't reain
[1:28:00] because power apart from character is
[1:28:05] satanic you may have power you may have
[1:28:09] a lot of things in your hand but if you
[1:28:12] don't have character to go with what you
[1:28:15] have it's satanic you cannot be
[1:28:19] used it will never be able to be
[1:28:21] developed you will never have respect
[1:28:24] for leaders or a boss on the
[1:28:26] site you may have the knowledge more
[1:28:29] smart and better than what any boss or
[1:28:32] anyone on your job site might
[1:28:35] have but you have to have character to
[1:28:38] understand where they are coming
[1:28:41] from but
[1:28:43] Power I like this power with character
[1:28:47] is fit to
[1:28:49] rule amen aren't you glad of that that
[1:28:52] power with character is fit to rule this
[1:29:01] morning so
[1:29:03] Nehemiah was building character amongst
[1:29:06] each and every one of them so I'd like
[1:29:09] to kind of transition this morning from
[1:29:11] Nehemiah to to
[1:29:13] another type of leader and brother
[1:29:15] Brandon would go over leadership in a
[1:29:18] message and he would use two young
[1:29:22] rulers and this morning I would like to
[1:29:24] go to Matthew
[1:29:26] 19 and verse 16 this
[1:29:31] morning do you love the
[1:29:34] Lord amen thank you for bearing with me
[1:29:36] this
[1:29:37] morning
[1:29:44] amen Matthew 19 and 16 and behold one
[1:29:49] came out and said unto him good Master
[1:29:53] what good thing shall I do that I may
[1:29:57] have eternal life it's a great question
[1:30:01] great question and he said unto him why
[1:30:04] callest thou me good Jesus speaking to
[1:30:07] him here why callest thou me good there
[1:30:10] is none good but one that is God but if
[1:30:14] thou Wilt enter into
[1:30:17] life see they were living but there's
[1:30:22] life
[1:30:24] keep the Commandments and he saith unto
[1:30:27] him which
[1:30:29] Jesus Jesus said Thou shalt not murder
[1:30:33] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[1:30:35] shalt not steal Thou shalt not be bear
[1:30:38] false witness honor thy father and
[1:30:41] mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:30:44] as
[1:30:45] thyself and look what he says here the
[1:30:47] Young Rich Young Ruler he says the young
[1:30:50] man saith unto him
[1:30:55] excuse me all these things have I kept
[1:30:58] from my youth up what lack I yet I've
[1:31:02] done all these things but I want eternal
[1:31:08] life and Jesus said unto him if thou
[1:31:11] will be perfect go and sell what thou
[1:31:14] Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt
[1:31:18] have treasure in heaven and come and
[1:31:21] follow me
[1:31:24] go sell what you have give to the poor
[1:31:28] and you'll have the greatest gift the
[1:31:30] greatest treasure no man can ever
[1:31:33] fathom but you see he was only seeing
[1:31:37] materialistic
[1:31:39] things he was only seeing what all he
[1:31:43] owned but when the young man heard that
[1:31:46] saying he went away
[1:31:48] sorrowful for he had great possessions
[1:31:54] so this Rich Young
[1:31:56] Ruler as he was growing
[1:31:59] up his mama would lead him and we all
[1:32:02] must be led we all must be guided around
[1:32:06] as a little
[1:32:07] child and so before long the Rich Young
[1:32:10] Ruler
[1:32:11] he he had to had to have some lessons
[1:32:15] and some things that you know he he had
[1:32:18] to learn so he had a teacher and so
[1:32:20] that's the way of our life our mother
[1:32:22] will lead you then you have a teacher in
[1:32:24] your life that'll kind of teach you some
[1:32:26] things you're going to have to learn
[1:32:27] some developmental skills communication
[1:32:30] mathematics and I know young children
[1:32:33] you're about to go back to school and
[1:32:35] it's going to be tough don't be
[1:32:41] critical I mean my nowadays they hardly
[1:32:44] give any homework I asked Titus almost
[1:32:47] every time he gets home from school like
[1:32:48] you any homework no what' you do in
[1:32:51] school today nothing
[1:32:54] not a
[1:32:56] thing my
[1:32:58] goodness that's it's amazing to me not a
[1:33:02] thing not a
[1:33:03] thing so you need a teacher to help you
[1:33:06] learn some of the things and how to do
[1:33:11] nothing I guess that's what they're
[1:33:13] teaching nowadays I don't know Sister
[1:33:16] Sarah is that sister Faith is that what
[1:33:17] they're teaching
[1:33:19] nothing
[1:33:20] no yeah don't be critical
[1:33:24] they're teaching a lot these days
[1:33:26] there's more of it
[1:33:31] amen
[1:33:34] hallelujah so he had a teacher that
[1:33:36] would lead him and guide him into some
[1:33:39] of these things and so after he learned
[1:33:41] so much then he has a father that says
[1:33:45] you've learned these things I've sent
[1:33:46] you to school you've went to
[1:33:48] University now I'm going to teach you
[1:33:50] about the father's business and I'm
[1:33:52] going to show you how to great
[1:33:54] have great possessions in life and so he
[1:33:56] taught the rich younger all these things
[1:33:59] and he had many great things he probably
[1:34:02] drove the Range Rover the nicest car he
[1:34:05] had all these great things lived in a
[1:34:07] nice Castle
[1:34:09] somewhere but you know what there was
[1:34:11] something on the inside of him that said
[1:34:13] you know what I'm I'm lacking something
[1:34:15] and I don't know what it
[1:34:17] is because many times that what we come
[1:34:20] to in our life because you you can have
[1:34:23] everything in this whole world you can
[1:34:25] have riches you may be poor but you do
[1:34:28] other things alcohol drugs smoke
[1:34:31] whatever it is but you're still liking
[1:34:32] something there's still a desire on your
[1:34:34] heart that says something's
[1:34:37] there so when you find that something
[1:34:39] all that will
[1:34:41] beat it'll dissipate when you find that
[1:34:44] thirst it it'll cure it all and so he
[1:34:48] had all these things but what did he
[1:34:51] lack us he wanted eternal life now this
[1:34:54] morning I'm not asking each and every
[1:34:56] one of you to sell everything you have
[1:34:58] you don't have to sell it all you don't
[1:35:00] have to give it all away to the poor but
[1:35:03] I am asking you to be
[1:35:05] willing to give it
[1:35:08] all be willing to give it all it's not
[1:35:12] ours and I'm going to get to that a
[1:35:14] little bit more later but none of this
[1:35:16] in this life none of these materialistic
[1:35:19] things is ours God has a hold on each
[1:35:21] and everything everything in life but be
[1:35:24] willing to give it all and that's what
[1:35:26] he was wanting I want you to be willing
[1:35:29] to give it all and come follow
[1:35:32] me just just that simple thing just be
[1:35:36] willing to give it all and come follow
[1:35:43] me so as we talk about those things I
[1:35:47] want I want to he was not willing to do
[1:35:50] that and he went away
[1:35:52] sorrowful but God God's given you more
[1:35:54] than than money lands and riches he's
[1:35:57] given you life health and strength but
[1:35:59] above all he's givv you this
[1:36:04] word and I want to read the parable this
[1:36:07] morning of the
[1:36:11] talents in Matthew 25 and verse1
[1:36:14] 14 and Jesus says the parable of talent
[1:36:17] says for the Kingdom of Heaven is a man
[1:36:20] traveling into a far country who calleth
[1:36:23] his own servants and delivered unto them
[1:36:26] goods and unto the one he gave five
[1:36:29] Talons unto another he gave two and to
[1:36:33] another
[1:36:34] servant one every man according to his
[1:36:39] several ability and straightway took his
[1:36:42] journey so the good servant has given
[1:36:46] some of his possessions to these
[1:36:48] servants according to their abilities 5
[1:36:52] 2 and one each one of them he's given
[1:36:56] something and so each one of them I'm
[1:36:58] going to skip some of these scriptures
[1:37:00] here but and so the good Master then he
[1:37:03] comes
[1:37:06] back now the one he
[1:37:10] went and he digged in the earth and hid
[1:37:14] the Lord's
[1:37:15] money I'm going to give a little bit of

[1:40:15] something with it this morning and in
[1:40:17] the meantime Nathan has went and sat
[1:40:20] down with
[1:40:21] it and he's not going to going to do
[1:40:23] nothing with this and he's just sitting
[1:40:26] there and he said you know what they
[1:40:28] gave me one and I'm scared of this
[1:40:29] master because he owns a lot of good
[1:40:31] things and I don't want to mess up what
[1:40:34] he's given me and I think this is
[1:40:35] probably probably the best I ain't I a
[1:40:37] want to do nothing with it dude but the
[1:40:40] servant that had even two now what did
[1:40:43] you
[1:40:44] get well she got four Hallelujah it

[1:41:08] Nathan how many did you

[1:41:15] okay one so so he's got one now how did
[1:41:19] you increase it you you didn't okay well
[1:41:24] you probably thought I was bad guy and I
[1:41:27] probably wouldn't give it back if I if
[1:41:28] you knew so but you know
[1:41:31] what since you didn't want to do nothing
[1:41:33] with it I'm going to go and I'm going to
[1:41:36] do something with the one that wanted to
[1:41:38] do the most with what the lord gave her
[1:41:40] and I'm going to give it to
[1:41:42] Annie and she did the most she had to
[1:41:45] make two
[1:41:52] trips oh
[1:41:56] yeah it's improv
[1:42:01] here now
[1:42:04] Nathan why would you do that why yeah
[1:42:07] know I just didn't understand why he
[1:42:08] would do something like that but he
[1:42:10] probably thought I was a bad master and
[1:42:12] that I would take more from him than
[1:42:14] what he had and I would take maybe what
[1:42:18] he had and what he had collected and and
[1:42:20] I want but you know what
[1:42:23] he's not like
[1:42:26] that but God wants you to increase what
[1:42:31] he's given
[1:42:32] you amen so now I've given you example
[1:42:37] of the money this morning but God is not
[1:42:40] wanting the
[1:42:42] money he's wanting
[1:42:46] you and he wants increase on what he's
[1:42:51] given you
[1:42:54] he's given you this
[1:42:57] Bible this word of
[1:43:00] God now many people will lay it on a
[1:43:05] shelf and they'll say he's a good Master
[1:43:08] now I don't want to mess up anything
[1:43:10] that he's told me so I'm not going to do
[1:43:12] much with
[1:43:15] that okay but what did he say to the one
[1:43:20] said depart from me I never knew you for

[1:43:36] want you to take and I want you to do
[1:43:38] something with this I want you to take

[1:44:49] want them to increase in this they may
[1:44:52] do great things in in this whole world

[1:47:50] morning God's so good
[1:47:53] God's so good you must do something with
[1:47:55] it God has your
[1:47:58] back the other Rich Young Ruler that
[1:48:01] brother Brandon would talk about is
[1:48:03] Moses and Moses as a child his mother
[1:48:07] could see that there was something
[1:48:09] different about Moses and so she took
[1:48:11] and she put him in the bull rush and
[1:48:13] said Lord be with you and said the
[1:48:16] little the little daughter followed the
[1:48:19] Moses down the river while the
[1:48:21] crocodiles came the angel protected
[1:48:24] him and she watched it all the way into
[1:48:28] Pharaoh's camp and
[1:48:31] when the daughter of pharaoh found this
[1:48:34] baby she begin to teach it begin to
[1:48:37] raise
[1:48:39] it but he wasn't just there just to
[1:48:43] learn things he wasn't there just to be
[1:48:45] a ruler God laid something on him more
[1:48:50] than just to be another pharaoh nor than
[1:48:53] just to be another king of Egypt but
[1:48:56] there was something a burden on his
[1:48:58] heart that says my people my
[1:49:03] people and you would see what he did
[1:49:06] Moses got in the way of his own self at
[1:49:10] first
[1:49:12] Moses did what he thought that he could
[1:49:14] do and a lot of times a man or woman
[1:49:17] will try to do stuff their way thinking
[1:49:20] this is what God wants God just wants
[1:49:22] you to surrender it to
[1:49:24] him and Moses killed a man and went to
[1:49:27] the back side of the desert but at the
[1:49:30] backside of the desert when Moses had
[1:49:34] nothing
[1:49:36] else says Moses I'm going to use
[1:49:39] you are you willing to give it all Moses
[1:49:43] for your people and he would say well
[1:49:46] who Am I who am I that I would lead a
[1:49:50] people out of
[1:49:51] Egypt I I know Pharaoh I know the
[1:49:54] hardness that they're under but I am a
[1:49:56] one
[1:49:57] man and brother Brandon would call him a
[1:50:00] onean
[1:50:01] Invasion one man Invasion that went to
[1:50:04] Egypt and brought a people out because
[1:50:08] he had the word of the
