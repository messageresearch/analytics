[53:50] this morning and
[53:51] say hello to you again and
[53:54] we never take none of these things for
[53:56] granted
[53:58] amen i got a couple of notes this week
[54:00] if it's okay if i'll share these with
[54:02] you one came from canada
[54:04] and i thought it was just really good it
[54:06] must have been right from the angel's
[54:08] hands he said i was thinking of
[54:11] thinking and praying for you
[54:14] this morning my friend he said we we
[54:17] pray for you often he says
[54:19] i was just thinking of that poor little
[54:21] old demon that gets sent to fight with
[54:25] you every day
[54:28] every morning he whines to his demon
[54:30] friends over breakfast
[54:33] about being assigned to you why couldn't
[54:36] he just get
[54:37] someone easy like the president or
[54:39] somebody
[54:42] he trudges to work knowing full well
[54:44] there's a whipping in store for him
[54:46] today
[54:47] he takes his licks all day and after
[54:49] failing at every task he puts his hands
[54:52] to he's tired
[54:54] very tired then it's time to report to
[54:58] into the boss and he tries to explain
[55:00] once again
[55:01] why he's got nothing to show for his
[55:03] day's work
[55:05] this doesn't go over well at all to say
[55:08] the least satan is surprised
[55:10] that a demon with such a successful
[55:13] track record
[55:16] before is now become so
[55:19] ineffective he's told to snap
[55:23] out of it and he is going back tomorrow
[55:27] and the next day and the day after that
[55:29] until
[55:30] something is to show for his work he
[55:32] asked for reinforcements
[55:34] knowing that inside it's not going to
[55:36] help
[55:38] god always raises a standard against
[55:41] whatever forces that he brings
[55:44] this target is protected every wound
[55:47] that he's been able to make
[55:50] had to be pre-authorized by god
[55:54] that means that any progress that he
[55:56] makes has to be approved
[55:58] by his enemy it doesn't take
[56:02] a general to see that he's losing this
[56:04] battle
[56:06] he licks his wounds crawls into bed
[56:08] knowing tomorrow
[56:10] it's going to be the very same way
[56:16] it kind of makes you feel sorry for this
[56:18] dumb devil
[56:20] but he's the one that chose this work
[56:23] to do he said have a great day
[56:31] i got this one from switzerland this
[56:32] morning
[56:34] he said there aren't so many things in
[56:36] the bible on which
[56:38] a huge amount of glory is bound to it
[56:40] but the trial of your faith and he says
[56:44] and i'm jealous
[56:45] over your beautiful crown god has
[56:47] prepared for you
[56:49] amen came at a good day started out with
[56:52] my sugar about 600 this morning and

[58:27] [Music]
[58:29] and there wrastled a man with him until
[58:33] the break-in of the day
[58:35] and when he saw that he would prevail
[58:37] not against him he touched the hollow of
[58:40] his thigh
[58:41] and the hollow of jacob's thigh was put
[58:44] out of joint
[58:45] and he wrestled with him now just
[58:48] because he's now the angel
[58:50] has inflicted an incredible scar that
[58:52] will rest the rest of his life
[58:55] he didn't he didn't let go
[58:58] and the angel said and he said let me go
[59:02] for the day breaketh and he said i will
[59:05] not let thee go
[59:07] except thou bless me and he said unto
[59:11] him
[59:12] what is thy name and he said jacob
[59:16] and he said thy name shall be called no
[59:19] more jacob
[59:20] but israel for as a prince
[59:24] has thou power with god and with men
[59:28] and has prevailed and jacob asked
[59:32] him and said tell me i pray thee thy
[59:34] name
[59:35] and he said wherefore it is that thou
[59:39] dost ask after my name and he blessed
[59:43] him there
[59:44] and jacob called the place pinell
[59:48] for i have seen god face
[59:52] to face and my life
[59:55] is preserved amen let's talk to him now

[1:00:52] and down and
[1:00:53] i'll just i'll just take care of that
[1:00:54] real quick it's because that i'm
[1:00:56] continuing to be on chemo
[1:00:58] and the chemo has affected either the
[1:01:00] cancer or the chemo has affected
[1:01:02] my pancreas and so my pancreas is not

[1:01:30] of like putting diesel in a gas engine
[1:01:32] it don't work no more like that
[1:01:34] so amen i appreciate that that you would
[1:01:36] send me those kind of things
[1:01:38] but my kids will eat it
[1:01:41] amen amen god bless you this morning
[1:01:46] seems like an interesting subject for us
[1:01:49] to take
[1:01:50] jacob of all of the people of the
[1:01:52] scripture
[1:01:53] on mother's day but we must remember
[1:01:57] he was a mama's boy hallelujah
[1:02:01] he was a mama's boy and you know
[1:02:05] he had a brother that was named esau
[1:02:08] that was a daddy's boy
[1:02:12] daddy's boy would hunt go out and did a
[1:02:15] lot of things that was
[1:02:17] very beneficial to the to the local
[1:02:19] family
[1:02:20] he was very he was a very fundamental
[1:02:23] very good guy he was very righteous in
[1:02:25] his spirit
[1:02:27] little brother was a shyster
[1:02:30] he was a brat come
[1:02:33] he was somebody that probably most of us
[1:02:36] in this building would not even want to
[1:02:38] associate with
[1:02:43] he was a booger there's not enough
[1:02:47] adjectives to
[1:02:48] put with it though he come from
[1:02:51] royal family and
[1:02:54] have royal future potential inside of
[1:02:57] him
[1:02:58] his first nature due to the fall
[1:03:03] caused him to be a real
[1:03:06] rascal this man would be an
[1:03:09] a description of grace he would be an
[1:03:12] individual to where in the scriptures
[1:03:14] that god would use him
[1:03:16] for a specific purpose because
[1:03:20] god would no doubt in in
[1:03:23] in any in any form of things
[1:03:26] it's not how you look sometimes at
[1:03:29] things in its beginning
[1:03:31] you see god's got a plan and
[1:03:34] people that you completely give up on
[1:03:37] [Applause]
[1:03:39] people that you completely give up on
[1:03:42] just hang on just a little while
[1:03:45] god's not finished writing the book
[1:03:48] about it
[1:03:48] [Applause]
[1:03:50] you and i would have throwed throwed
[1:03:53] jacob away
[1:03:55] because you and i didn't understand that
[1:03:57] before they were even born
[1:04:02] while they were still wrestling in the
[1:04:04] womb
[1:04:06] god said esau i hate him
[1:04:16] now who did he tell that to his mother
[1:04:20] and his mother would always think about
[1:04:23] what god put in her heart
[1:04:25] maybe not sharing with the world
[1:04:31] nobody wants to share that god chose one
[1:04:33] of my children
[1:04:34] and hates the other one that ain't
[1:04:37] something that you send out on the
[1:04:38] internet
[1:04:41] but god made the choice
[1:04:45] now i want you to think if god ever
[1:04:48] thought of you
[1:04:51] if you were ever an attribute in his
[1:04:54] mind he will never
[1:04:57] ever lose you
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:02] are you with me now it's not you holding
[1:05:05] on
[1:05:07] it's not you that are going through your
[1:05:10] wobbles of roller coasters of life and
[1:05:13] one day is good
[1:05:13] one day is bad one day is good one day
[1:05:15] is bad
[1:05:16] it's not you that thinks well i've got
[1:05:18] to attain to a certain level
[1:05:20] it's god put a predestinated seed on the
[1:05:23] inside of you
[1:05:25] and there's times where you feel like
[1:05:27] giving up
[1:05:28] and you say i quit and god just smiles
[1:05:34] because you're not holding on brother
[1:05:36] i'm saying yes i'll let you go through
[1:05:37] things
[1:05:38] just to let you know who's the boss
[1:05:40] [Applause]
[1:05:43] are you with me now jacob leaves home
[1:05:49] we know that he's tricked his daddy
[1:05:52] he's tricked his brother he has
[1:05:56] now has the blessing he has the
[1:05:59] birthright
[1:06:00] he has the blessing and he would trick
[1:06:04] it out of it
[1:06:05] out of his own daddy and esau note that
[1:06:08] he had the right to the blessing
[1:06:10] and jacob has tricked him tricked his
[1:06:13] blind daddy
[1:06:15] now just think about it just for a
[1:06:16] moment so many times we feel sorry
[1:06:18] for people in different situations but
[1:06:21] god had to have
[1:06:22] isaac blind
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:26] and he staggered in the darkness for
[1:06:29] maybe even decades blood
[1:06:33] couldn't see the daylight
[1:06:36] but had he not been blind he would have
[1:06:40] never never blessed jacob
[1:06:46] you with me and remember this jacob
[1:06:50] was going to be the lineage of israel
[1:06:56] amen you may not have looked at it and
[1:06:58] remember their god's chosen people
[1:07:01] and the scripture says and the god of
[1:07:04] abraham
[1:07:05] and the god of isaac but there was a
[1:07:07] time that jacob hadn't made him
[1:07:10] his god he had a blessing
[1:07:13] he had a birthright but yet he hadn't
[1:07:16] made him his god
[1:07:18] there comes a time in your life where
[1:07:20] you've got to wrestle it out
[1:07:22] and you may be predestinated seed in a
[1:07:24] season of your life that you were aliens
[1:07:27] from the commonwealth of god and maybe
[1:07:29] your parents gave up on you
[1:07:32] amen
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:40] now
[1:07:42] you know sometimes you get what you ask
[1:07:44] for
[1:07:47] and jacob goes to the kindred to get
[1:07:49] himself a wife
[1:07:53] and he meets a man named laban
[1:07:56] laban the first the first one that he
[1:07:58] met in that land
[1:07:59] was a girl named rachel
[1:08:03] she must have been a beautiful woman
[1:08:07] amen i want you to think about this for
[1:08:10] a moment
[1:08:12] because jacob was in a royal family
[1:08:15] amen and in abraham's household
[1:08:18] there were a lot of beautiful women
[1:08:21] sarah was a beautiful woman
[1:08:22] amen right now rebecca was a beautiful
[1:08:26] woman
[1:08:27] so there was probably no doubt a lot of
[1:08:29] beautiful women
[1:08:30] that was around and remember he was a
[1:08:32] rascal
[1:08:33] amen but when he sees
[1:08:37] rachel
[1:08:46] something begins to bounce in his chest
[1:08:48] it ain't never happened in his life
[1:08:51] and now this rascal is attached to this
[1:08:54] woman that he loves
[1:08:58] don't know exactly how he's going to get
[1:08:59] her but he's after her now
[1:09:02] he's on the chase so he meets laban
[1:09:06] and laban is a whole lot like jacob
[1:09:08] sometimes you're a lot like your
[1:09:10] father-in-law
[1:09:14] and so laban sees his potential
[1:09:18] that's and sees there's a blessing and a
[1:09:21] birthright with him
[1:09:23] he liked to have that in his home and
[1:09:26] he'd like to keep him around
[1:09:28] and you know keeping jacob around his
[1:09:31] flocks
[1:09:31] groaned he became more rich
[1:09:35] just having him work in the house having
[1:09:38] him work in the fields
[1:09:40] just having him around the stories that
[1:09:42] were told there was a blessing that was
[1:09:44] with him
[1:09:45] amen and he said if you work seven years
[1:09:49] for the old testament broad
[1:09:52] i'll give you a new testament brought
[1:09:56] but you're gonna have to work seven
[1:09:58] years here for the old testament
[1:10:00] and you're going to have to work seven
[1:10:02] years for the new testament
[1:10:03] [Applause]
[1:10:05] hallelujah through
[1:10:08] jacob's sea through his natural lineage
[1:10:13] god is going to produce the old
[1:10:16] testament
[1:10:16] bride through a rascal
[1:10:20] through a wretched man like paul
[1:10:23] says all wretched man that i am
[1:10:31] seven years of work seven years
[1:10:36] the wedding takes place
[1:10:39] the ceremony happens he goes to his tent
[1:10:44] with his wife
[1:10:45] and he wakes up the next morning
[1:10:49] with a different girl
[1:10:52] it is the older system i'd like to read
[1:10:54] your scripture about her
[1:10:57] in genesis chapter 29 and verse 31
[1:11:00] because she has an important place in
[1:11:02] the kingdom of god
[1:11:04] and when the lord saw that leah was
[1:11:10] hated
[1:11:12] he opened her womb
[1:11:16] but rachel was married
[1:11:20] and leah conceived and bear a son and
[1:11:22] she called his
[1:11:23] name reuben for she
[1:11:27] said surely the lord hath looked upon my
[1:11:31] affliction
[1:11:32] the scripture called her tenderize
[1:11:40] the previous scripture called her tender
[1:11:42] life even
[1:11:43] god saw her as an ugly woman
[1:11:50] amen hey god don't lie
[1:11:57] [Music]
[1:12:02] the scripture bears out as much as
[1:12:03] beautiful as rachel is
[1:12:06] that's how ugly leah was and the reason
[1:12:10] i bring this point to you
[1:12:12] is because no matter how ugly you think
[1:12:15] you are in your life
[1:12:17] [Applause]
[1:12:20] come on church come on church
[1:12:24] no matter how much that you look at
[1:12:26] yourself
[1:12:27] and see the ugliness of your life and
[1:12:30] how things have went in your life
[1:12:32] god's still got purpose for you
[1:12:36] that ought to cause you to shout this
[1:12:38] morning
[1:12:40] though even god called her tenderized
[1:12:43] no though even the moses the prophet
[1:12:46] looked back
[1:12:47] and saw how god looked at her
[1:12:50] but god didn't leave her in that place
[1:12:53] he
[1:12:53] opened her womb
[1:12:57] because out of her six sons
[1:13:00] six tribes half of the tribes of
[1:13:04] israel was going to pass through her
[1:13:07] womb
[1:13:07] amen amen
[1:13:14] now what you just think she lives with a
[1:13:17] man that hates her
[1:13:19] she lives with a man that disdains her
[1:13:22] she lives with a man that thinks she's
[1:13:24] ugly
[1:13:26] now watch these scriptures and leah
[1:13:29] conceived
[1:13:30] and married a son and she called his
[1:13:32] name reuben
[1:13:35] for she said surely the lord hath looked
[1:13:39] upon my affliction
[1:13:41] and now therefore my husband will love
[1:13:44] me
[1:13:47] reuben will become the eldest leader
[1:13:52] of jerusalem of israel
[1:13:59] notice the words surely the lord
[1:14:02] hath looked upon my affliction
[1:14:06] and now therefore my husband will love
[1:14:08] me amen
[1:14:10] and she conceived again and bear a son
[1:14:13] and she said because the lord hath
[1:14:16] heard that i was hated
[1:14:21] he had therefore given me this son
[1:14:25] and she called his name simeon
[1:14:31] and she conceived again and bear a son
[1:14:35] and said
[1:14:36] now this time will my
[1:14:40] husband come in union with me
[1:14:44] join unto me
[1:14:51] can you read into these scriptures her
[1:14:53] complex
[1:14:54] yeah can you read any of these
[1:14:57] scriptures for complex
[1:14:59] because i have borne him three sons
[1:15:02] therefore was his name called
[1:15:05] levi levi
[1:15:09] his children would become the servants
[1:15:13] in the temple
[1:15:15] are you with me they would become some
[1:15:17] of the most anointed
[1:15:19] servants that god would have and it
[1:15:22] would come through a womb
[1:15:24] that's right that god productionated
[1:15:28] all right
[1:15:31] you're right
[1:15:37] now i want you to just notice
[1:15:40] this next and she conceived again
[1:15:45] and bear a son
[1:15:49] now notice this there comes a time in
[1:15:52] your life
[1:15:54] that you realize i've been placed in the
[1:15:56] kingdom
[1:15:57] for such a time as this
[1:16:05] and she said now i will praise the lord
[1:16:10] notice now she's not concerned were
[1:16:13] jacob loves her or not
[1:16:16] oh i feel like preaching she's not
[1:16:18] concerned where everybody else loves her
[1:16:21] or not
[1:16:22] but i'm going to name this boy judah
[1:16:25] [Applause]
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:28] now i will praise the lord
[1:16:33] for every scripture that points back
[1:16:36] to out of the tribe of judah will talk
[1:16:40] about my womb
[1:16:42] we'll talk about the seed that passed
[1:16:45] through my womb
[1:16:46] i'm a part of the kingdom of god
[1:16:51] jesus the lineage of jesus
[1:16:54] is going to pass through my womb
[1:16:59] come on church so no matter about how
[1:17:02] bad you're hated
[1:17:03] no matter how ugly life seems to be
[1:17:06] through the womb of your soul
[1:17:10] god has chosen
[1:17:22] god has chose to place his seed
[1:17:26] in you i want you to think about this of
[1:17:30] all of the billions of people on the
[1:17:32] earth
[1:17:35] whether it was rahab or tamar
[1:17:40] or ruth it wasn't their flesh that
[1:17:43] preserved them
[1:17:46] help me now don't let your minds go
[1:17:48] drifting here at this point
[1:17:51] but listen it wasn't their flesh or
[1:17:53] their name
[1:17:55] that preserved them it was the seed
[1:17:59] in the womb
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:03] it was the royal seed that was placed in
[1:18:06] the womb
[1:18:07] whether it was kmart right
[1:18:14] or whether it was sarah any of these
[1:18:18] women
[1:18:18] it was a seed that went into the womb
[1:18:22] there's been churches churches and
[1:18:24] bridesbridge
[1:18:26] there's been women churches of the earth
[1:18:29] that thought they were so special
[1:18:31] but because he placed his seed in the
[1:18:34] womb of your
[1:18:35] soul that's what makes you renewable
[1:18:44] glory that's what places you
[1:18:54] wasn't that you were so special
[1:18:57] it was he chose something inside of you
[1:19:01] that makes you special
[1:19:04] [Applause]
[1:19:07] jacob is making his way home because
[1:19:09] somewhere you got to go back to the word
[1:19:13] the birthright is not to be over there
[1:19:14] in laban's house
[1:19:16] it's to be over here and he's got to
[1:19:19] make a journey with his wives and those
[1:19:22] boys everything that he's got
[1:19:30] he's got to go back home now

[1:19:36] you
[1:19:36] his brother still looks at him that's
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:40] as a rascal amen a traitor
[1:19:44] a guy that's a stinker that is a
[1:19:47] disloyal man
[1:19:49] that will steal everything you got
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:56] his brother is in on a mission

[1:31:00] and you felt like you were all alone and
[1:31:03] your life was a mess

[1:31:06] were destroyed in your nature
[1:31:10] and the only thing that would change you
[1:31:12] was
[1:31:14] god

[1:32:45] so nancy wrastled it out not because she
[1:32:48] was a good little girl
[1:32:51] but god knew what kind of plan that she
[1:32:53] had in her life
[1:32:55] god knew what leah had in her life
[1:33:00] and homer then met the same
[1:33:03] angel of god
[1:33:06] and his life became changed
[1:33:10] listen when you meet him
[1:33:13] it's more than this
[1:33:15] [Applause]
[1:33:17] then preachers begin to call him out
[1:33:20] you're called to preach you're called to
[1:33:21] preach
[1:33:22] and other people would look at him and
[1:33:23] go not him
[1:33:26] not him he won't be in church no town
[1:33:31] but you see he met an angel
[1:33:35] now i brought you an up-to-date
[1:33:37] experience now i want to take you back
[1:33:39] jacob was left alone and he meets a man
[1:33:50] and god don't talk to him he fights with
[1:33:52] him
[1:33:56] brother danny this ought to suit you
[1:33:58] real well
[1:33:59] he just fights with him god knows what
[1:34:02] it takes for every individual
[1:34:08] when jacob recognized this was god
[1:34:13] when he recognized this was god he
[1:34:15] refused to let him go
[1:34:20] now let me just say this to you the
[1:34:22] angel asked him his name
[1:34:24] the angel knew his name
[1:34:27] but he needed jacob to identify himself
[1:34:30] as a rascal
[1:34:33] you've got to come to a spot in your
[1:34:35] life that you can identify yourself that
[1:34:37] i'm lost
[1:34:38] i need god
[1:34:41] you can sugarcoat it all you want to you
[1:34:44] can powder sugar it
[1:34:45] you can do what you want to
[1:34:49] but without god you're lost
[1:34:54] but i got a predestinated seed you still
[1:34:56] got to get a birth
[1:35:00] easy believism will never give you a
[1:35:02] birth coming to churches sitting on a
[1:35:04] pew will never give you a birth
[1:35:06] being my best buddy will never give you
[1:35:08] a birth you've got to wrestle it
[1:35:11] out with god
[1:35:14] you got to die to your sins
[1:35:18] you got to lay it all on the altar
[1:35:21] god's not asking for half your life he's
[1:35:24] asking for all your life
[1:35:30] well i'm going to say i'm going to save
[1:35:32] those old dirty clothes just in case i
[1:35:34] don't make it
[1:35:35] i'm going to save those old dirty rock
[1:35:37] and roll just in case i don't make it
[1:35:40] i'm going to save those old dirty movies
[1:35:41] just in case i don't make it you ain't
[1:35:43] met god yet
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:47] i'm gonna be buddy buddies with those
[1:35:48] old dirty friends you ain't met god yet
[1:35:51] when you meet god it won't be you
[1:35:53] leaving your friends
[1:35:55] it'll be your friends leaving you
[1:36:14] jacob held on
[1:36:19] i could tell you about my testimony
[1:36:22] of holding on and the months of dying
[1:36:25] out to my self-will
[1:36:28] this is not abracadabra
[1:36:32] this is not two seconds of crying and
[1:36:34] whining and now i'm better now
[1:36:37] this is where you're really truly god
[1:36:39] feels sorry for your sins
[1:36:41] those sins would have sent you to hell
[1:36:43] and now god has made a grace provision
[1:36:45] for you
[1:36:46] that he's going to make a way for you
[1:36:48] you don't have to go to hell
[1:36:49] i want to make a way for you brother ron
[1:36:51] i i don't believe the message and i
[1:36:53] don't believe this and i don't believe
[1:36:54] that
[1:36:55] still there's a savior for you
[1:36:58] you don't have to go to hell whoever's
[1:37:01] listening to this right now
[1:37:02] you don't you may not understand nothing
[1:37:04] about william branham you not understand
[1:37:06] nothing about me

[1:37:13] meet jesus he will lead you and guide
[1:37:17] you into
[1:37:17] all truth

[1:38:12] jacob held on
[1:38:19] the sun was starting to come up
[1:38:22] and the angel said let me go
[1:38:26] let me go he said i'll not let you go
[1:38:31] because i don't want to live another day
[1:38:35] like i have lived god wanted to hear
[1:38:38] that
[1:38:39] amen i don't want to live another day
[1:38:43] like what i have lived i'm talking to
[1:38:45] somebody here this morning
[1:38:47] you don't have to remain the same next
[1:38:50] week next month

[1:38:58] one day can put people in prison
[1:39:02] one day can get girls pregnant

[1:39:48] house in washington dc
[1:39:50] owning more land than any other
[1:39:54] person in the united states of america

[1:40:06] husband
[1:40:11] when he gets to the white throne
[1:40:12] judgment
[1:40:14] and he's standing there god's not
[1:40:18] impressed that he was a computer
[1:40:20] guru
[1:40:26] how much their foundation give away
[1:40:29] whether you know that or not he's been
[1:40:32] skipping his taxes for a long time
[1:40:38] he puts his charitable donations into a
[1:40:40] foundation
[1:40:41] his own money into his own foundation
[1:40:43] that's a handy way
[1:40:46] handy way to skip taxes they want to
[1:40:48] point at presidents pointed some of
[1:40:50] these
[1:40:50] idiots
[1:40:54] they've been thieves for a long time
[1:40:56] finding out their adulterers their sin
[1:40:58] behind the camp

[1:41:31] another to point to
[1:41:34] they know there's a hail
[1:41:42] brother ron that's a little wrong no one
[1:41:45] just
[1:41:46] did what jesus just did jesus said the
[1:41:49] rich man
[1:41:51] when he was in hell
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:56] because he couldn't wrestle it out in
[1:41:57] his life dimension whatever his life
[1:42:00] was he was rich
[1:42:03] but in hell he lifted up his eyes
[1:42:06] he got religious in hell
[1:42:12] and he said if you just give a drop
[1:42:16] of water on my tongue
[1:42:21] one drop let me just say in his life no
[1:42:24] doubt he had phenomenal servants that
[1:42:26] was willing to give their life to take
[1:42:28] care of him
[1:42:28] and a lot of families lived off of his
[1:42:31] wealth
[1:42:32] they looked up to him they saw a whole
[1:42:34] lot of him but when jesus looked at him
[1:42:36] he saw him in hell
[1:42:39] but there was a man that that was
[1:42:41] outside of his door that was a beggar
[1:42:46] god thought of more of that becca
[1:42:51] then he did the rich man
[1:43:11] in my hands i'm holding life and death
[1:43:14] and i'm presenting it
[1:43:21] don't get resentful in a moment like
[1:43:23] this
[1:43:26] this ain't the spot to get resentful
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:32] don't give me your excuses of why you
[1:43:34] can't serve god
[1:43:39] what are you stopping for the gift don't
[1:43:41] just work at the end of the service
[1:43:47] and god has taken out on mother's day
[1:43:50] the
[1:43:50] opportunity to give you a chance to turn
[1:43:54] your life around
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:43:58] and i'm doing my job
[1:44:03] i'm doing my job i'm trusting god
[1:44:06] because he told me
[1:44:07] if you'll trust me i'll use you like
[1:44:09] never before
[1:44:12] i don't know where this service will go
[1:44:14] but if you're on your way to
[1:44:16] you don't know jesus i want you to know

[1:44:53] again the rest of my life
[1:45:10] i was preaching a meeting at brother
[1:45:12] danny stevens
[1:45:19] brother jason jackson preached with me
[1:45:22] brother timothy pruitt preached with me
[1:45:25] but the tim pruitt preached with me
[1:45:30] and i spoke
[1:45:33] on the first morning there
[1:45:36] god showed me a vision
[1:45:42] and in the vision i saw
[1:45:45] myself going through the worst torment
[1:45:48] the worst darkness i'd ever went through
[1:45:51] and i began to go down in a in a ravine
[1:45:55] that had no bottom to it
[1:45:58] and it was the worst road that i'd ever
[1:46:00] travel
[1:46:03] as i traveled down this road
[1:46:06] the roads were tore up it was looks like
[1:46:09] earthquakes everywhere and i was walking
[1:46:14] and at first when i was walking there
[1:46:15] was light with me
[1:46:17] but then it became total night and it
[1:46:20] got darker
[1:46:21] and it got darker and it got darker and
[1:46:24] darker
[1:46:27] and on my way into this pit
[1:46:32] i led soul after soul
[1:46:37] to jesus christ
[1:46:40] and when i reached the bottom of the pit
[1:46:44] that i thought i'd never get to
[1:46:47] there was a girl there and i knew who
[1:46:50] she was
[1:46:52] and i asked her are you ready to walk
[1:46:56] out
[1:47:00] and she said now i'm ready
[1:47:08] and we turned and we began to walk out
[1:47:11] of that
[1:47:11] dark place
[1:47:20] and we walked and we walked until we
[1:47:23] walked into the sunlight
[1:47:25] amen at that point i didn't know i had
[1:47:27] cancer
[1:47:31] there's some things that god don't let
[1:47:33] you know
[1:47:39] let me just drop a couple things here
[1:47:41] hope you're patient with me just for a
[1:47:43] minute
[1:47:44] because i'm after a soul
[1:47:55] do you know that i had cancer throughout
[1:47:58] my body
[1:47:59] when god raised up brother doc
[1:48:03] and brought him back to life

[1:48:18] body for the last

[1:48:28] your body
[1:48:29] even things that you don't know you got
[1:48:31] going on in your body
[1:48:33] amen
[1:48:41] when the doctor laid his hands on my
[1:48:43] knees the other day
[1:48:46] and i asked him the question how long
[1:48:48] will i be stage four
[1:48:49] he said you'll be stage four the rest of
[1:48:51] your life
[1:48:54] he said but every day is a miracle do
[1:48:57] you think that made me crawl up in a
[1:48:58] hole in one and
[1:49:01] say pity me i want you to know god sent
[1:49:05] me into this pit with a purpose
[1:49:11] he sent me in this pit with a purpose
