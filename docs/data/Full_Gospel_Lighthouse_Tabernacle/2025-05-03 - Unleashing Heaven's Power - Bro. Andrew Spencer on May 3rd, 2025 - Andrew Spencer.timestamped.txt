[29:57] hands as they drove the nails in

[35:12] my favorite
[35:17] part. And like a

[37:10] away and turned your back to all of my
[37:19] sins, but for me you gave your life.
[37:24] [Music]
[37:30] You chose to be my
[37:37] friend. And when you could have walked
[37:46] away and turned your back to all of my

[38:05] You chose to be our friend.

[38:41] [Music]
[38:45] The more I seek
[38:48] [Music]

[39:02] The more I find
[39:09] you, the more I love you.

[39:22] the cup in your hand, lay back against
[39:28] you, and
[39:30] breathe. Feel your
[39:35] heartbeat. And this love is so
[39:40] deep. It's more than I can stand.
[39:45] I melt in your peace. It's
[39:55] [Music]
[39:59] overwhelming. The more I seek

[40:30] love you.
[40:35] I want to sit at your feet, drink from

[41:37] deep. It's more than I can
[41:42] stand. I melt in your peace. It's
[42:09] overwhelming. I want to sit at your
[42:13] feet. Drink from the cup in your hand.
[42:19] Lay back against you and
[42:23] breathe and feel your
[42:29] heartbeat. This love is so
[42:34] deep. It's more than I can
[42:39] stand. I melt in your peace. It's
[42:44] overwhelming.
[42:48] [Music]
[42:52] [Applause]
[42:58] Is that your desire?
[43:00] I just love the Lord. Don't you? This is

[43:07] I love him.
[43:09] Amen. Let's stand. We prepare to turn to

[53:40] what he is to us.
[53:43] Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[53:49] keeper, light in the darkness. My God,
[53:54] that is who you
[54:01] are. Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[54:08] keeper, light in the darkness.
[54:12] My God, that is who you
[54:20] are. Even when I don't see it, you're
[54:25] working. Even when I don't feel it,
[54:28] you're working. You never stop. You
[54:32] never stop working. You never stop. You
[54:37] never stop working.
[54:39] Even when I don't see that you're
[54:43] working. Even when I don't feel it,
[54:46] you're working. You never stop. You
[54:50] never stop working. You never stop. You
[54:54] never stop
[54:56] working. Even when I don't see
[55:01] cancer, even when I don't feel
[55:05] like, you stop. You stop
[55:10] [Music]
[55:18] [Music]
[55:23] working. You never stop. You never stop
[55:27] working. You never stop. You never stop
[55:31] working.
[55:33] Even when I don't see it, you're
[55:36] working. Even when I don't feel it,

[55:56] promise, light in the

[56:03] That's who we are.
[56:06] [Music]
[56:09] Way made, miracle worker, promise
[56:14] keeper, light in the darkness.
[56:19] [Music]
[56:20] [Applause]
[56:24] Father, we come before you
[56:30] tonight. And Lord, we
[56:32] realize that you're in the room.
[56:36] We realize, Father, that we have entered
[56:38] into a very sacred
[56:41] moment. A spot that we would call it
[56:44] heavenly places, a place
[56:48] predestination can only put us
[56:51] in. Father, we have come here tonight,
[56:55] Lord, to see you, to see you face to
[56:59] face, to hear your word, and for our
[57:02] lives to be changed. Father, I pray that
[57:06] tonight that every person here under the
[57:08] sound of our voice, Lord Jesus, would
[57:11] feel the impulse of the Holy Ghost
[57:14] moving in this place, transforming
[57:17] lives. Lord, I pray tonight that you
[57:20] would take complete control of this
[57:22] service for your glory. Father, may
[57:25] lives be changed. Lord, you have dealt
[57:28] with me very heavily in this subject
[57:30] matter tonight. And I pray that by the
[57:33] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that we
[57:35] would speak the things that thou hast
[57:37] laid upon our heart. Now God, I'm
[57:40] completely insufficient on my own. But
[57:43] Lord, if I can yield my vessel to you
[57:46] and the people of God can begin to pull
[57:48] the very gift, Lord, that you placed in
[57:51] me, Lord, we will begin to see signs and
[57:54] wonders follow the believer. So Father,
[57:56] we dedicate this service to you and for
[57:59] your glory. So we pray in the name of
[58:02] Jesus Christ these special things. Amen.
[58:06] Amen. God richly bless you tonight. If
[58:09] you have your Bibles, we'd like to look
[58:10] over in the book of
[58:12] Luke, the book of Luke, chapter 11, and
[58:16] then down to Mark, Mark, chapter
[58:19] 12.
[58:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:33] We had a
[58:34] beautiful wedding here
[58:40] today. So thankful our pastor, brother
[58:44] Ron, did a just absolute wonderful job.
[58:47] And we just want to welcome all of our
[58:48] visitors here that were here in for the
[58:52] in for the wedding. We just want to make
[58:54] you feel welcome. Amen. And we just love
[58:56] you with the love of the Lord. Amen.
[59:00] Lukeap 11 verse one. And we just like to
[59:04] uh by the help of the Lord maybe just
[59:05] take a little thought tonight on
[59:08] unleashing unleashing heaven's
[59:11] power. Luke 11:1 says, "And it came to
[59:14] pass that as he was praying in a certain
[59:17] place when he ceased, one of his
[59:20] disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us
[59:22] to pray." As John also taught his
[59:25] disciples, and he said unto them, when
[59:28] ye pray, say, Our Father, which art in
[59:30] heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[59:33] kingdom come, thy will be done, as in
[59:36] heaven so in earth. Give us day by day
[59:40] our daily bread. And forgive us our
[59:43] sins, for we also forgive everyone that
[59:46] is indebted to us, and lead us not into
[59:49] temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[59:52] And he said unto them, "Which of you
[59:54] shall have a friend and shall go unto
[59:56] him at midnight, and shall say unto him,
[59:58] Friend, lend me three loaves? For a
[1:00:00] friend of mine in his journey is come to
[1:00:02] me, and I have nothing to set before
[1:00:04] him." And he from within shall answer
[1:00:07] and say, "Trouble me not. The door is
[1:00:09] now shut, and my children are with me in
[1:00:11] bed, and I cannot rise and give thee."
[1:00:14] And I say unto you, though he will not
[1:00:16] rise and give him because he is his
[1:00:18] friend, yet because of his opportunity,
[1:00:22] he will rise and give him as many as he
[1:00:24] needeth. And I say unto you, ask and it
[1:00:27] shall be given you. Seek and you shall
[1:00:29] find. Knock and it shall be opened unto
[1:00:32] you. For everyone that askketh
[1:00:34] receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth,
[1:00:37] and to him that knockketh it shall be
[1:00:39] opened. Also, Markap 11 verse 22. Just
[1:00:44] want to confirm we have that clip ready
[1:00:46] for later. Okay, just wanted to line up
[1:00:49] the ending for the service this evening.
[1:00:52] Amen. Mark 11 and verse 22. And this is
[1:00:55] a very very familiar scripture to us and
[1:00:57] we realize that this is the scripture
[1:01:00] that our prophet was sitting there in
[1:01:02] the woods and he was contemplating on
[1:01:04] this scripture. It's very powerful
[1:01:06] scripture and it has great impact upon
[1:01:09] the believer today. I truly believe that
[1:01:12] if you can harness what brother Brandham
[1:01:14] says in perfect faith and you can
[1:01:16] capture what Jesus is saying to you
[1:01:18] right here, I really believe with all of
[1:01:20] my heart that you can move mountains in
[1:01:22] your life. Jesus answering saith unto
[1:01:25] them, have faith in God. That's the
[1:01:28] answer right there. That's the answer to
[1:01:31] your mountains. That's the answer to
[1:01:33] your problems. For verily I say unto
[1:01:35] you, that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:01:38] mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou
[1:01:41] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[1:01:44] in his heart, but shall believe that
[1:01:47] those things which he saith shall come
[1:01:50] to
[1:01:50] pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[1:01:56] Therefore, I Jesus say unto Andrew
[1:02:00] Spencer, what things soever you desire
[1:02:05] when you pray, believe that you receive
[1:02:09] them, and you shall have them.
[1:02:13] How many believes that? Amen. God richly
[1:02:16] bless you tonight. May you be seated in
[1:02:18] the presence of the Lord. As we said,
[1:02:20] we'd like to just take a little thought
[1:02:22] on unleashing heaven's power. And to me,
[1:02:25] one of the greatest things about the
[1:02:27] Bible is to me how personal that our
[1:02:31] Lord Jesus Christ is to each and every
[1:02:33] one of us. I believe that no matter
[1:02:35] where you are in life, no matter how old
[1:02:38] you are, no matter how young you are,
[1:02:40] that our Lord Jesus Christ can make
[1:02:42] himself so personable personable to each
[1:02:45] and every one of us on our level. He
[1:02:47] knows how to come and speak with
[1:02:49] children and he doesn't mind taking time
[1:02:51] out of his busy journey to be able to
[1:02:53] stop and minister to our little
[1:02:55] children. And he isn't too busy to come
[1:02:57] by the elderly that might feel like they
[1:03:00] have maybe missed their journey or their
[1:03:02] days of their days of sojouring and
[1:03:05] being able to be effective. I believe
[1:03:08] that our Lord Jesus Christ can come to
[1:03:10] every one of those believers in their
[1:03:12] situation and in their needs. And
[1:03:14] brother Brandham would say this. He
[1:03:16] said, "I think that the main thing that
[1:03:18] I'm trying to bring to you is the
[1:03:20] reality of the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:03:24] that you might see him and know that
[1:03:27] it's him by his identified promise for
[1:03:30] the day." Again, the prophet said, "The
[1:03:32] greatest pleasure that I know of is to
[1:03:34] be to be to pray until I can realize
[1:03:38] that I'm in the presence of God and
[1:03:40] recognize it." He said, 'I think that
[1:03:42] ought to thrill be the thrill of the
[1:03:44] church is the presence of the Holy
[1:03:47] Spirit seeing the God that made the
[1:03:50] promise standing amongst us and feel his
[1:03:52] presence and see his word and see it
[1:03:55] vindicated. It ought to give faith to
[1:03:57] make cripples walk, blind see, death
[1:04:00] hear, and dumb speak. If we can realize
[1:04:03] that we are in the presence of the
[1:04:05] almighty God, then we ought to be able
[1:04:07] to recognize that no matter what we are
[1:04:09] facing, that every every statistic and
[1:04:12] every objective that the enemy might put
[1:04:15] upon our lives, that that presence that
[1:04:17] we recognize has the ability to change
[1:04:20] our complete situation. But you and I
[1:04:23] have got to be able to come in a direct
[1:04:25] approach and a divine approach to be
[1:04:27] able to approach him as he truly is. We
[1:04:30] don't want to approach him as just a
[1:04:32] janitor, even though God doesn't mind
[1:04:35] being a janitor. We don't want just to
[1:04:37] approach him as as the engineer, even
[1:04:39] though God doesn't mind being an
[1:04:41] engineer. We don't want just to approach
[1:04:43] him as a president because God, we
[1:04:46] realize that God doesn't even mind
[1:04:47] working in presidents and he doesn't
[1:04:49] even mind working in kings. But what we
[1:04:52] have to approach him as, we've got to
[1:04:55] approach him as the great I am. Because
[1:04:57] we realize that when we approach him as
[1:05:00] who he is, that then those blessings
[1:05:02] that you and I have need of in our life,
[1:05:05] then those things that we have need of
[1:05:07] will begin to be be able to release
[1:05:09] himself to us. So, we don't want to just
[1:05:11] come before him with some half-hearted
[1:05:13] loose worship, but we want to come
[1:05:15] before him as the great I am, realizing
[1:05:19] that he holds all the power of heaven
[1:05:21] and earth. He holds the earth by his
[1:05:24] very fingertips. It is his word that
[1:05:26] controls all things. And if we approach
[1:05:29] him in the divine approach that God has
[1:05:31] set up through the word, then we realize
[1:05:34] that God will release our desires that
[1:05:37] we have in him. Is that right? Now,
[1:05:39] brother Madden would come and he would
[1:05:40] teach us and tell us many things. And he
[1:05:42] would say to us that the greatest
[1:05:44] hindrance that the gospel has ever had
[1:05:47] has been education. And we realize that
[1:05:49] that we do not know God by education and
[1:05:53] we do not know God by intellectualism
[1:05:55] nor by reasoning or nor by science. But
[1:05:58] if we're going to know God, we've got to
[1:06:00] know him in a very personal way. We've
[1:06:03] got to know him by faith. Brother Marham
[1:06:06] said that faith is something that is
[1:06:08] born in you, something that God gives
[1:06:10] you. He said as he grabs Hebrews 11,
[1:06:14] it's the substance of things hoped for.
[1:06:17] It's the evidence of things not
[1:06:19] reasoned. He said that's where it comes
[1:06:21] from. Through there, through the
[1:06:23] unadulterated power of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:25] Christ that makes a creature a new
[1:06:28] person. It baptizes him a new in the
[1:06:30] Holy Spirit. Washes him, hangs him up,
[1:06:33] and seals him into the kingdom of God.
[1:06:35] Then he stands there knowing where he's
[1:06:37] at. All the devils in hell couldn't
[1:06:39] shake him away from it. He said, "You
[1:06:41] might even turn a machine gun on him,
[1:06:43] but that won't shake him away from it."
[1:06:45] You see, if you have a personal
[1:06:47] knowledge and a personal experience with
[1:06:49] the great I am as the God of all of
[1:06:52] heaven and the God of all the earth,
[1:06:55] there is no devil in hell. There is no
[1:06:57] demon spirit that can disrupt the plan
[1:07:00] of almighty God in your life. I want to
[1:07:02] say this to you. The message of the hour
[1:07:05] did not just come to us to prove that
[1:07:07] William Brandham was Malachi 4. The
[1:07:09] message of the hour did not come to us
[1:07:12] just to watch miracles happen in the
[1:07:14] first and the second pull. But I believe
[1:07:16] that the message of the hour came to
[1:07:18] identify us as a third pull people that
[1:07:21] gives us the same access and the same
[1:07:24] abilities that you watch William
[1:07:26] Brandham operate in the opening of the
[1:07:28] word. The message didn't come just so we
[1:07:30] could see miracles. The message came so
[1:07:33] that you and I could realize that we
[1:07:35] have been released to be sons and
[1:07:37] daughters of almighty God and that you
[1:07:39] and I have a representation by
[1:07:42] predestination and that we are built to
[1:07:45] withstand all the ws of the devil. Look
[1:07:48] at your neighbor and say we are built to
[1:07:50] overcome the pressures of Leoa.
[1:07:56] We are built to overcome the pressures
[1:07:59] of Leosa. And I tell you, it's very
[1:08:03] powerful when you begin to recognize the
[1:08:05] confidence that God has in his bride.
[1:08:08] That she can stand in the worst of
[1:08:09] times, in the worst and the darkest of
[1:08:12] ages, that you and I have been given an
[1:08:15] access and an ability to enforce our
[1:08:18] God-given rights that Almighty God gave
[1:08:20] you and me. He gave it to the little
[1:08:23] bitty girl that's got the baptism of the
[1:08:25] Holy Ghost. He gave it to our grandmas
[1:08:27] that are 90 years old. He's given you
[1:08:29] your God-given rights. Well, you say, "I
[1:08:32] might be small and I might be old." Let
[1:08:35] me remind you what the prophet said.
[1:08:37] It's not the size of the dog in the
[1:08:39] fight. It's the size of the fight that's
[1:08:42] on the inside of the dog. This message
[1:08:45] came to put you into astronaut kind of
[1:08:48] faith to believe that all things are
[1:08:50] possible and no devil in hell has a
[1:08:52] right to withstand you. Come on,
[1:08:54] somebody. He didn't come here just to
[1:08:57] make you a coward. The message came to
[1:08:59] give you courage and to be bold and to
[1:09:02] stand before God like a son. Not like a
[1:09:05] servant, but like a son and to make
[1:09:08] every demon recognize that it's got to
[1:09:11] bow
[1:09:13] by the name that you operate in.
[1:09:17] Well, come on now. I believe that we're
[1:09:20] in the hour where we recognize that we
[1:09:23] are astronauts and that you and I cannot
[1:09:26] be fed by by by Wesleyanism and we
[1:09:30] cannot be fed by we cannot be fed by
[1:09:34] Lutheranism. I'll say it like this so
[1:09:36] maybe you understand it just a little
[1:09:38] bit better. You cannot put hay on the
[1:09:41] inside of a rocket because you cannot
[1:09:44] feed you cannot feed this message people
[1:09:47] what you was feeding back there in days
[1:09:50] gone by. It might have been good for
[1:09:51] your horse and buggy but let me say
[1:09:53] this. You can never put that kind of a
[1:09:56] hay or that kind of a fuel on the inside
[1:09:59] of a rocket, but an astronaut has got to
[1:10:02] have rapturing faith that's been
[1:10:04] released by the message of the hour. And
[1:10:06] it was the opening of those seals that
[1:10:09] made you realize
[1:10:12] the power that you have in prayer.
[1:10:18] Brother Manam said, "You watch." He
[1:10:19] said, "Now the astronaut," he said, "you
[1:10:21] can watch it on the screen." That
[1:10:22] astronaut, he doesn't know where he's
[1:10:24] at. He's simply moving and he's
[1:10:26] controlled by a radar power. You can
[1:10:28] look at it. Brother Man said that you
[1:10:30] got a radar power, too. He said it's
[1:10:33] prayer. Prayer is the radar power that
[1:10:36] directs the astronaut. He said, "You ask
[1:10:38] the father anything in my name and I'll
[1:10:40] do it." He said, "You can tell the way
[1:10:43] the astronaut is traveling by the way
[1:10:46] the churches are praying."
[1:10:49] You can tell the way that the astronaut
[1:10:51] is traveling by the way the church is
[1:10:54] praying. If the church is praying, well,
[1:10:57] we believe that the days of miracles are
[1:10:59] passed, then the astronaut is going to
[1:11:01] go to the ground. If the astronaut, if
[1:11:04] you get yourself into a church that
[1:11:06] disbelieves any promise in the Bible,
[1:11:09] you are going to watch an astronaut come
[1:11:11] right back down. But if you can put your
[1:11:14] people and get a church that fully
[1:11:16] believes in the authority of what God
[1:11:18] has said and has spoken in his word, you
[1:11:20] will see a church that'll rise in power
[1:11:23] go higher and higher. I say this that
[1:11:25] she is unlimited in her power. She is
[1:11:28] unlimited in her faith. She is unlimited
[1:11:31] in what she can do. It isn't just for
[1:11:33] days gone by. It isn't just for the
[1:11:36] pastors. It isn't just for the strong
[1:11:38] ones. It's for every person that is
[1:11:40] birthed under the kingdom of Almighty
[1:11:42] God. And I say it's time that you
[1:11:46] unleash heaven's power in this place.
[1:11:50] Now, Brother Man Brother Man was asked
[1:11:53] the question in
[1:11:55] 1964 after the seals have been released.
[1:11:59] How can a Christian get deeper in the
[1:12:02] love of
[1:12:03] God? Read the word and pray.
[1:12:07] This is after the seals. And the
[1:12:10] greatest revelation that has struck the
[1:12:12] United States and all of the world is
[1:12:16] read and pray. How will I know God
[1:12:19] better? It's not to know all the
[1:12:21] breaking of the seals, but to read and
[1:12:24] to pray. What does Satan fight you so
[1:12:27] hard on? Read and pray. Read and pray.
[1:12:31] Read and pray.
[1:12:34] Jeremiah 33 and says, "Call unto me and
[1:12:37] I will answer thee and show thee great
[1:12:40] and mighty things which thou knowest
[1:12:43] not." So prayer reveals God's hidden
[1:12:46] power. Psalms 145 and 18 says, "The Lord
[1:12:50] is nigh unto all of them that call upon
[1:12:53] him and all that call upon him in truth.
[1:12:58] Now brother man said and thou knowest
[1:13:00] all things. He said it's prayer. It is
[1:13:03] the most vital force that God ever put
[1:13:06] in the hand of mankind. The most
[1:13:09] effective force that is known to man is
[1:13:12] prayer. Do you believe that it is prayer
[1:13:16] that changes things? Again he said
[1:13:18] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:13:21] was ever put in the hand of mankind. The
[1:13:25] prayer of faith shall save the sick. Now
[1:13:29] to me, I'm so glad the prophet did not
[1:13:31] say it's so the most powerful force in
[1:13:34] the hand of preachers is the power of
[1:13:38] prayer. I'm so glad that he did not say
[1:13:41] in the hand of the strong Christians,
[1:13:44] the most vital force is prayer. But he
[1:13:47] said in the hand of all mankind, the
[1:13:50] most vital force is the power of prayer.
[1:13:54] So God will hear the old and God will
[1:13:57] hear the young and God will hear the
[1:13:59] weak and God will hear the strong.
[1:14:03] Let me give every mother in this place
[1:14:05] that feels like they are not being
[1:14:08] useful and all they're getting done in
[1:14:10] their daily life is just is just
[1:14:13] motherhood duties. Let me give you
[1:14:15] sisters a very powerful quote from your
[1:14:18] prophet. Will you receive it?
[1:14:22] And so a good praying wife or mother can
[1:14:24] do more for the kingdom of God on her
[1:14:27] knees at home than sometimes the
[1:14:30] preacher can do on the platform.
[1:14:35] That's for Sister Abigail. That's for
[1:14:37] Sister Gabrielle. That's for Sister
[1:14:39] Sarah. That's for all of these mothers.
[1:14:42] That's for every one of you here.
[1:14:43] Sometimes your prayer can be more
[1:14:46] impactful than a preacher standing
[1:14:48] behind the platform. The reason why we
[1:14:51] have service conventions like we are in
[1:14:53] is because somebody decided to pray.
[1:14:58] You can be as forceful with praying as I
[1:15:02] am forceful in my preaching.
[1:15:05] I say it's high time that we have our
[1:15:09] mothers. Hallelujah. It's Mother's Day
[1:15:12] next weekend and some of you are sitting
[1:15:15] here and your prodals are out there in
[1:15:17] the world. Mothers, your prayers can be
[1:15:20] more impactful sometimes than a preacher
[1:15:23] behind the platform.
[1:15:25] Well, how do you know? How do you know
[1:15:27] that he hears you, brother Andrew? First
[1:15:29] John 5:14 explains it perfectly. And
[1:15:33] this is the confidence that we have in
[1:15:35] him that if we ask anything according to
[1:15:40] his will.
[1:15:42] It's not asking for a new Jeep. It's not
[1:15:45] asking for a new Toyota. It's not asking
[1:15:47] for a new home. But if we ask anything
[1:15:51] according to his will,
[1:15:56] he hears us. And if we know that he
[1:16:00] hears us,
[1:16:04] That's how you got power in prayer is
[1:16:06] when you know that he hears you. When
[1:16:09] you know that you have talked to
[1:16:10] Almighty God and you didn't ask it in
[1:16:12] your own humanity and your own vanity
[1:16:15] but you are asking from the very heart
[1:16:18] and the word of Almighty God that if we
[1:16:20] know that he hears
[1:16:22] us
[1:16:24] whatsoever we
[1:16:27] ask we know.
[1:16:31] Somebody say we know that we have the
[1:16:34] petitions that we desire of him. Let me
[1:16:39] say it like this. Prayer is like a very
[1:16:42] it's a it's like a spiritual
[1:16:44] sword. Prayer is like a spiritual sword
[1:16:47] that is handed to a soldier in battle.
[1:16:50] And without that sword, he stands there
[1:16:52] before his enemy completely defenseless.
[1:16:56] He stands there and if he doesn't have a
[1:16:58] hope of it, he stands there and the
[1:17:00] enemy will whip him. But brother, when
[1:17:03] he's got faith in his hands, when he
[1:17:05] puts when he puts prayer upon his lips
[1:17:08] and he begins to talk to Almighty God,
[1:17:11] when he lifts that up in prayer, I say
[1:17:13] that heaven moves. I say that even
[1:17:16] sickness has got to go. That's right. I
[1:17:19] say if you'll start putting the word of
[1:17:21] God upon your lips, I'll tell you that
[1:17:23] every mind battle will leave you. I say
[1:17:26] that every fear has got to leave you.
[1:17:29] Every condemning spirit, every
[1:17:31] oppression spirit has got to leave you
[1:17:33] when you put the word of God upon your
[1:17:36] lips. Sickness, demons, powers, all the
[1:17:39] things of the world have got to leave
[1:17:42] you because God did not give you the
[1:17:45] spirit of fear. He gave you the spirit
[1:17:47] of power and of love and a sound mind.
[1:17:52] You see, just like Arnold Vanerford when
[1:17:56] he changed the dynamics of the battle
[1:17:59] for Switzerland that day, just like
[1:18:01] prayer, you see the tides of war changed
[1:18:04] that day when he made that decoration
[1:18:06] that I'm going to liberate my family and
[1:18:09] I'm going to liberate my home and I'm
[1:18:11] going to liberate my country. That's the
[1:18:13] same way that prayer, the sword of faith
[1:18:15] and prayer in a believer's hand, you ti,
[1:18:18] you change the tides of war. When you
[1:18:20] put prayer back up on your lips, I
[1:18:23] believe one thing for sure that prayer
[1:18:25] is a lost art today.
[1:18:28] I believe that people know how to
[1:18:30] Instagram and Facebook better than they
[1:18:33] know how to pray.
[1:18:36] Well, come on, somebody. You can tell me
[1:18:39] about all your prayer requests, but tell
[1:18:41] me how much have you prayed.
[1:18:46] Let me ask you, when's the last time you
[1:18:48] went through your prayer list and you
[1:18:50] checked people's names off instead of
[1:18:52] adding more people's names? That's the
[1:18:55] kind of power. Now, I'm not condemning
[1:18:57] you and I'm not whipping you around. I'm
[1:18:59] challenging you in a positive way
[1:19:02] because every single one of us have to
[1:19:04] spend more time in prayer.
[1:19:07] I read a statistic the other day that
[1:19:09] made me cry that the average Christian
[1:19:12] prays 3 to five minutes a day.
[1:19:16] What are we doing with our time? That's
[1:19:18] right. What are we doing with our time?
[1:19:22] Brother Brandham said that if you want
[1:19:24] to be the greatest indebted to this
[1:19:27] meeting, he said simply don't pray.
[1:19:31] He said don't pray. He said you can give
[1:19:33] all your finances to the meeting. And he
[1:19:36] said that would do a great thing. He
[1:19:37] said but the greatest thing that you can
[1:19:39] do for a meeting like this is to set
[1:19:41] aside an hour or two before this meeting
[1:19:45] and come and pray and your prayers will
[1:19:48] be answered. I wonder how many times
[1:19:50] have we set aside an hour or two to pray
[1:19:53] for our Saturday and Sunday services.
[1:19:56] I'd say that lives would be completely
[1:19:58] changed. There would be things upon our
[1:20:00] prayer list. Come on. I'm not condemning
[1:20:03] you. I'm just preaching the word of God
[1:20:05] to you because even I need more time in
[1:20:08] prayer. But if we took this serious
[1:20:13] and spent an hour before we got into
[1:20:16] church and prayed,
[1:20:19] let me say it like this. Prayer is a
[1:20:22] great communication to God. But let me
[1:20:25] say it even further. Prayer is
[1:20:27] activation. Because prayer will activate
[1:20:30] the Holy Spirit in your life to go after
[1:20:33] situations and condemn the devils that
[1:20:35] you have prayed about. Because there are
[1:20:37] demons that are after our children. But
[1:20:39] what must we do, brother Andrew? Pray.
[1:20:43] Come on, somebody. We've got to pray
[1:20:46] like never before. Now notice what the
[1:20:49] prophet
[1:20:50] said in the greatest battle ever fought.
[1:20:53] He said, you see his attack. He said,
[1:20:55] watch, listen closely this closing. He
[1:20:58] said his attack is what? Is to
[1:21:00] disbelieve God's word, that's his
[1:21:03] attack. You see, listen, if he can get
[1:21:06] you to disbelieve or disbelieve that
[1:21:09] your weapon is equivalent, if he can get
[1:21:11] you to believe that your weapon is not
[1:21:13] strong enough, he's got you disarmed. He
[1:21:15] said, "But when you lay that down, that
[1:21:17] finishes your fight. You're done." He
[1:21:20] said, "But hold on to that weapon,
[1:21:21] brother, and don't you lay it down."
[1:21:24] What are you saying? I'm saying if I was
[1:21:26] a devil,
[1:21:29] if I was a devil, I tell you what I do.
[1:21:33] I would steal every moment that you have
[1:21:36] for prayer, I would steal it away from
[1:21:38] you. Every time that you begin to think
[1:21:41] about prayer, I would begin to put
[1:21:43] something else on your mind. If I was a
[1:21:46] devil and I realized how impactful
[1:21:48] prayer was, I would make you think that
[1:21:51] your prayers can never be heard. If I
[1:21:53] was a devil, I would make you think that
[1:21:56] you still have so much sin on your life
[1:21:58] that your prayers cannot be answered by
[1:22:01] God. If I was a prayer, if I was a
[1:22:04] devil, I would make you think that only
[1:22:06] the deacons and the elders had the right
[1:22:09] to pray. If I was a devil, I tell you
[1:22:12] young people, don't get down on your
[1:22:14] knees, find some more entertainment. if
[1:22:16] I was a
[1:22:18] devil. But if I was God, I'd say, "Turn
[1:22:21] it on the devil and start praying and
[1:22:24] start whipping demons and start calling
[1:22:26] on God." If I was a devil, I'd try to
[1:22:29] rob prayer right out of your
[1:22:31] [Applause]
[1:22:35] life. Hallelujah.
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:43] You say, "Well, so many times the devil
[1:22:45] makes you feel like you're a little old
[1:22:48] insignificant
[1:22:50] nothing." It's amazing how the enemy
[1:22:54] likes to go after our little ones and
[1:22:56] make them think that that make them
[1:22:58] think that they're not strong enough.
[1:23:00] But let me remind you young people that
[1:23:02] Josiah became a king at 8 years old. And
[1:23:05] he began to pray and he started putting
[1:23:08] the word back in his rightful place. And
[1:23:10] he started to see the kingdom of God
[1:23:12] come back in his place. And I say little
[1:23:15] babies, I say little bitty boys and
[1:23:17] little bitty girls, if you will begin to
[1:23:19] pray, I will say that your mama and
[1:23:22] daddy will have a greater relationship
[1:23:24] with you. You might think you might
[1:23:26] think that your mama don't got time for
[1:23:28] you. But if you'll get down and pray,
[1:23:30] it'll bring create an atmosphere in your
[1:23:32] home that'll make your mama get right
[1:23:34] back with God again. I say, mamas and
[1:23:36] daddies, if we see our little ones
[1:23:38] praying, don't you just walk by. You get
[1:23:41] down on your knees and get to praying
[1:23:43] with them little ones.
[1:23:47] You see, it matters who you yield your
[1:23:49] vessel to. Brother Brandham picks it up
[1:23:52] when he starts talking about Mark
[1:23:53] chapter 5 and he starts looking at
[1:23:55] Legion. He said when he began to look at
[1:23:57] Legion, how that them demons had
[1:24:00] completely taken over Legion's life and
[1:24:02] completely utterly destroyed his mind.
[1:24:05] He said when the devil when them demons
[1:24:07] saw that the Lord Jesus Christ was
[1:24:09] there, he said the devil recognized who
[1:24:12] that was.
[1:24:14] The devil recognized who that was. He
[1:24:17] said, 'Now don't you say, don't say they
[1:24:20] don't recognize you. They do. You
[1:24:24] believe devils recognize Christians. He
[1:24:27] said, "Certainly they do."
[1:24:29] So it ain't if I pray, it's if you pray.
[1:24:36] Certainly they do. Devils tremble when
[1:24:40] the weakest of saints goes to their
[1:24:42] knees. What a power and a privilege it
[1:24:45] has been given to the church of the
[1:24:46] living God. When you fall on your knees
[1:24:48] in prayer, even devils tremble to the
[1:24:51] weakest of them.
[1:24:54] Think of
[1:24:56] it. And here we
[1:24:59] are. We have an open
[1:25:02] book. The seals have been released to
[1:25:06] us. We are a restored people. We see the
[1:25:11] fruit at the top of the tree. It's
[1:25:14] because the evening light has shone upon
[1:25:18] us. But it's amazing to me that we are
[1:25:21] the most forgetful
[1:25:23] people and we forget how to pray. We
[1:25:27] forget what God said. Brother Brandham
[1:25:31] said in the meanest man in Santa Maria,
[1:25:32] he said, "You think of the modern
[1:25:33] American people, what is it?" Well,
[1:25:35] dad's down at the pool room and mother's
[1:25:37] out with some pet society somewhere on
[1:25:39] the beach stretched out. Daughter's down
[1:25:41] at the canteen or down at the rock and
[1:25:43] roll. Junior's got his hot rod on the
[1:25:44] street. There you are. One's got a
[1:25:47] hamburger. One's got a hamburger. He
[1:25:50] said, "There's no home life and there's
[1:25:52] no prayer life." Again, he would say in
[1:25:54] testimony, he said, "Now you Christians,
[1:25:56] don't stay in that lukewarm condition
[1:25:58] anymore. Lay aside anything and
[1:26:00] everything. Just get as close to God as
[1:26:03] you can. Walk with him. talk with him.
[1:26:05] Let everything else be secondary but
[1:26:08] your prayer life.
[1:26:10] Let everything else be secondary but
[1:26:13] your prayer life. Stay right with him
[1:26:15] all the time. He said, "Now, I don't
[1:26:18] know why I stopped in my speech to say
[1:26:20] that, but I could prove this to you. I'd
[1:26:23] be willing to say that that was a spirit
[1:26:25] of God there that was speaking right
[1:26:27] now. A warning to you." That's right.
[1:26:29] Remember, I'm saying that under the
[1:26:31] anointing of the spirit of God, let
[1:26:34] everything else be secondary but your
[1:26:37] prayer
[1:26:39] life. I I have I have a question before
[1:26:41] I get into some
[1:26:46] preaching. We could point
[1:26:48] back to our prayer warriors a day going
[1:26:55] by. But where's my prayer warriors
[1:26:57] today?
[1:26:59] Again, I'm not condemning. I'm only
[1:27:03] preaching because God put this on my
[1:27:04] heart. And I cannot preach it unless he
[1:27:06] puts it on my heart. Let me ask you,
[1:27:09] where's my prayer warriors today?
[1:27:11] Where's my mamas? Where's my daddies
[1:27:15] that refuse to let the devil come in and
[1:27:17] steal their children? Where's the young
[1:27:20] people that refuse to give in? That
[1:27:22] refuse to give in to Leosa and let Satan
[1:27:25] come in there and rob from them the
[1:27:27] greatest time of their life. Where's our
[1:27:29] young people that decide, you know what,
[1:27:32] I'm not young enough. I'm not too weak.
[1:27:35] But I believe in the power of
[1:27:37] intercessory prayer. Where's our young
[1:27:39] girls that refuse to give in to Satan
[1:27:42] and say, "You know what? Instead of
[1:27:45] having a party, let's have a prayer
[1:27:47] meeting.
[1:27:49] Instead of our young boys getting
[1:27:51] together and having a good time, why not
[1:27:54] we have some young boys that begin to
[1:27:57] spend time in prayer together? We say,
[1:27:59] "You better be careful, Brother Angel.
[1:28:01] You'll create something." I pray to God
[1:28:02] we create something.
[1:28:06] I pray to God we create something in our
[1:28:08] young people and our young boys and in
[1:28:10] our mas and daddies to get back to
[1:28:13] intercessory prayer where we pray heaven
[1:28:16] down and we Hallelujah and we put hell
[1:28:19] off of our premises anymore.
[1:28:27] Let me ask you, what is more powerful
[1:28:30] than prayer?
[1:28:33] Nothing.
[1:28:35] Hallelujah. God has given you and I the
[1:28:38] most powerful weapon that can ever be
[1:28:41] placed in the hands of mankind. It's the
[1:28:44] power of prayer. He said, "It's the
[1:28:46] power of prayer. It's the power of a
[1:28:49] committed spirit. It's the power of the
[1:28:51] Holy Ghost." And he said, "We stand in a
[1:28:53] corner like a bunch of cowards
[1:28:55] sometimes." He said, "But God wants men
[1:28:57] and women who are gallant, who will
[1:28:59] stand out there and take their place.
[1:29:01] God wants a hero, but could you be one?
[1:29:04] He said, "Well, I'm too afraid, Brother
[1:29:05] Andrew." I'll say, "What fear operates
[1:29:07] on is feelings. But what faith operates
[1:29:10] on is the word of God. Fear will make
[1:29:13] you make hasty decisions and it'll make
[1:29:15] you abandon the truth. But faith will
[1:29:18] make you come right back to the word of
[1:29:19] God again." I'll tell you like King
[1:29:22] David did it. King David one time he
[1:29:25] recognized that he could not abandon the
[1:29:27] word of God and he was out there
[1:29:29] fighting a battle but he had to stop the
[1:29:31] battle. He had to stop the battle. And
[1:29:34] in 2 Samuel 5 and 19 the Bible said that
[1:29:37] David begin to talk to the Lord and ask
[1:29:40] the Lord if this was the time to go up
[1:29:43] and destroy the Philistines. Will you
[1:29:45] say brother Andrew them are demons? It's
[1:29:47] my opportunity to run them out of run
[1:29:50] them out of my family. Run them out of
[1:29:51] my camp.
[1:29:53] David first prayed.
[1:29:56] He knew them Philistines was demons. But
[1:29:59] he knew that he had to pray first. He
[1:30:01] knew he had to talk to God that had the
[1:30:04] ability to run them devils out of there.
[1:30:07] And if you'll start talking to God
[1:30:09] before you start talking to them demons,
[1:30:13] God will show you what time it is. He'll
[1:30:16] tell you with assurityity that you're
[1:30:18] going to win the battle. Like brother
[1:30:20] Matthew stood right here tonight and
[1:30:23] said, "We're winning."
[1:30:26] I take that as a sign to you mamas that
[1:30:28] has spent some time in prayer about
[1:30:31] somebody talking about prayer
[1:30:34] again. That a word has spoken unto you,
[1:30:37] you're going to win.
[1:30:42] Glory to God.
[1:30:46] You said, "Well, I I'm just surrounded
[1:30:47] by fear." Overcoming fear is trusting
[1:30:50] the word.
[1:30:53] Fear always brings something with it. It
[1:30:57] always brings the devil's
[1:30:59] language. And all of a sudden, fear
[1:31:01] makes you start talking the devil's
[1:31:03] language. You know what Satan's arsenal
[1:31:06] is?
[1:31:11] Forgetfulness. Hallelujah. To me, it's
[1:31:14] amazing how that you have been word
[1:31:16] taught all your life and all of a sudden
[1:31:19] when the trial comes up, you know, now
[1:31:22] come on, somebody don't let me preach to
[1:31:24] myself
[1:31:26] here. It's amazing that you are been
[1:31:29] word taught. I'm going to tell you what,
[1:31:30] I was raised in diapers in this message.
[1:31:32] But you let something come up and all of
[1:31:34] a sudden the devil will put
[1:31:36] forgetfulness on top of you and you'll
[1:31:37] start forgetting what God said. It's
[1:31:39] amazing when you start looking back to
[1:31:41] what what Israel began to forget as soon
[1:31:43] as they got out of the land of Egypt.
[1:31:45] They remembered all the nine plagues.
[1:31:48] They remembered when the 10th one came
[1:31:49] around. But let them get outside the
[1:31:51] city and all of a sudden they forgot
[1:31:52] what happened back there. It's amazing
[1:31:55] when you go through one victory and you
[1:31:57] get ready to go into another trial, you
[1:31:59] begin to forget what God did for you
[1:32:02] just right back there.
[1:32:05] But I love what the psalmist said in
[1:32:08] 119:16 that I will delight myself in thy
[1:32:10] statutes and I will not forget thy word.
[1:32:13] Verse 83 said, "For I am become like a
[1:32:16] bottle in the smoke, yet do I not forget
[1:32:19] thy statutes." Verse 93 said, "I will
[1:32:22] never forget thy precepts, for with them
[1:32:25] thou hast made me alive."
[1:32:27] 109 says, "My soul is continually in my
[1:32:31] hand, yet do I not forget thy law."
[1:32:34] Verse 141, "I am small and
[1:32:41] despised." I'm hated and rejected,
[1:32:43] Brother Andrew. Yet do I not forgive thy
[1:32:46] precepts. Verse 153, "Consider my
[1:32:50] affliction and deliver me, for I do not
[1:32:53] forget thy law. Amen. Verse 176. I have
[1:32:59] gone astray like a lost sheep. Seek thy
[1:33:02] servant. Come after me. I was gone like
[1:33:06] a lost sheep. I lost my faith. I lost
[1:33:10] what I was meant to do. But seek after
[1:33:13] me for I do not forget thy commandments.
[1:33:17] He will never leave me and he'll never
[1:33:19] forsake me. I might have went away.
[1:33:23] I might have went away, but he never
[1:33:26] went away.
[1:33:28] I might have walked away from the
[1:33:30] message. I might have walked away from
[1:33:32] my faith, but hallelujah.
[1:33:35] He never left me.
[1:33:38] Well, Jesus, I'll never forget what you
[1:33:41] done for me. Well, Jesus, I'll never
[1:33:44] forget how you set me free. Jesus, I'll
[1:33:49] never forget how you brought me
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:54] out. I have gone astray like a lost
[1:33:57] sheep. Seek thy servant for I do not
[1:34:01] forget thy commandments.
[1:34:03] Well, how can I forget?
[1:34:07] Come on, somebody. How can you forget
[1:34:09] what he done for you? How can you forget
[1:34:12] how he brought you out?
[1:34:17] It is said that a man that is in
[1:34:20] constant fellowship with the
[1:34:22] Elohim is
[1:34:25] invincible. I'm talking about somebody
[1:34:28] that
[1:34:29] knows that they've been with Jesus. You
[1:34:33] remember when brother Bisll was talking
[1:34:35] about when he was being on the hunting
[1:34:36] trips with the
[1:34:38] prophet, he said, "I I was to take the
[1:34:41] second watch." He said, "Brother
[1:34:43] Brandham took the first watch." He said,
[1:34:45] "When brother Brandham came to me and
[1:34:47] woke me up for the second watch," he
[1:34:49] said, "I went and sat where the prophet
[1:34:50] was." He said, "It was like I had
[1:34:53] entered a lover's bedroom." He said,
[1:34:56] "Because the prophet had been talking to
[1:34:59] Elohim. Jesus went aside to pray. Jesus,
[1:35:03] the great I am, took time to talk to the
[1:35:06] father." Well, who are you talking to?
[1:35:08] I'm talking to the father that sealed
[1:35:11] his life on the inside of me. I'm not
[1:35:13] talking to the airwaves. I'm not talking
[1:35:16] to what's around me. I'm not talking to
[1:35:18] a picture. I'm talking to the one that
[1:35:21] placed a gene seed on the inside of me.
[1:35:26] Well, I'm too
[1:35:30] busy. Susanna Wesley was a mother of a
[1:35:34] Philadelphiaian church age messenger.
[1:35:36] She had 19 children. She lost some of
[1:35:38] them in their infancy. And even in her
[1:35:41] busyiness of life, she took two hours a
[1:35:44] day to pray every single day. It was
[1:35:48] said, I was reading this week that it
[1:35:50] was said amidst the busyiness of the
[1:35:52] chaos of a busy household, sometimes
[1:35:55] Suzanne Wesley got so busy, but she knew
[1:35:58] she had to pray, she would take her
[1:36:00] apron and throw it over top of her head
[1:36:02] so that she could have a private space
[1:36:04] of prayer time. I'd say it's time for
[1:36:07] mamas to take their apron and throw it
[1:36:09] over top of their head. I'd say it's
[1:36:10] time for brothers to take their head out
[1:36:13] of the news. Take their head out of
[1:36:15] what's going on in politics. Take their
[1:36:17] head of who what Pope is coming in, what
[1:36:20] Trump is doing. Wow, has Biden fell off
[1:36:22] the map. Take your head and put it
[1:36:25] between your knees and talk to Almighty
[1:36:27] God.
[1:36:36] Well, what if I can't get on my knees?
[1:36:39] I'm too old to get down. I have a hard
[1:36:41] time getting up. It's not the posture of
[1:36:45] your body. It's the posture of your
[1:36:47] heart.
[1:36:51] Let me say this that some of the most
[1:36:53] powerful prayers are prayed in the car.
[1:36:57] Some of the most powerful prayers are
[1:36:59] when you can't get down on your knees.
[1:37:00] Some of the most powerful prayers is
[1:37:02] when you brothers are walking through
[1:37:04] Lowe's or Home Depot working on a job
[1:37:06] and mamas are working through their
[1:37:07] school and they just need a minute and
[1:37:09] all of a sudden they turn back and they
[1:37:11] realize I've got power over the
[1:37:14] situations of my life and they start
[1:37:16] talking to Papa God and they don't
[1:37:18] realize they know that they're not just
[1:37:20] communicating with God. They are
[1:37:22] activating Almighty God. That same
[1:37:24] pillar fire that was while you're with
[1:37:26] William Brham has been activated in your
[1:37:29] life, in your faith, in your home, in
[1:37:31] your
[1:37:33] family. I say it's high time that you
[1:37:37] unleash heaven's
[1:37:41] power. Hallelujah.
[1:37:44] Jesus said in Matthew
[1:37:46] 18:18, "Verily, verily, I say unto you
[1:37:50] that whatsoever you bind on earth shall
[1:37:53] be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you
[1:37:55] loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:37:57] heaven." Again, I say unto you, that if
[1:37:59] two of you agree on earth as touching
[1:38:01] anything that they shall ask, it shall
[1:38:04] be done for them of my father which is
[1:38:07] in heaven. For where two or three are
[1:38:09] gathered together in my name, there am I
[1:38:13] in the midst of them.
[1:38:17] It's more than two or three in here. I'd
[1:38:19] say if I was you, I'd start passing
[1:38:21] notes back and forth. Come on, young
[1:38:23] people. You've been passing notes back
[1:38:25] and forth in church. You might as well
[1:38:26] pass some notes back and forth. Let's
[1:38:28] agree to this that tonight's going to be
[1:38:30] my night of deliverance. That tonight's
[1:38:32] going to be my healing. Why don't you
[1:38:34] pass some faith to this brother and that
[1:38:36] brother and said if two or three agree
[1:38:38] with us on this one thing we shall have
[1:38:40] so whatsoever things we ask in the name
[1:38:43] of Jesus Christ just like the believers
[1:38:45] in Mark chapter 2 when they are created
[1:38:48] enough faith to bring a man and tear off
[1:38:50] a roof and drop him down they said
[1:38:52] there's two of us that got the same kind
[1:38:55] of faith and they activated the faith of
[1:38:57] the father and all of a sudden a death a
[1:39:00] man that was on his bed that man Jesus
[1:39:03] Jesus looked at him and said, "Rise up
[1:39:05] and walk."
[1:39:07] I say to you, dead center, rise up and
[1:39:10] walk. Get out of your paralyzed faith
[1:39:12] condition.
[1:39:24] I'm talking about believers that are
[1:39:26] bold. I'm talking about believers that
[1:39:28] are strong.
[1:39:32] Let the weak say,
[1:39:35] let the weak say, I'm When the weakest
[1:39:38] of Christians go on their knees, let
[1:39:42] them say, "I am strong."
[1:39:48] Elijah was a man like you and I. Elijah
[1:39:51] had ups and downs like you and I. Elijah
[1:39:54] had trials like you and I. Elijah had to
[1:39:57] deal with Leosa, Jezebel's like you and
[1:40:00] I.
[1:40:02] But
[1:40:03] Elijah begin to talk to
[1:40:06] God. He said, "You know what? It's time
[1:40:09] that we lock up
[1:40:10] heaven. Let it not rain for three
[1:40:15] years." Well, I'll tell you what the
[1:40:18] rest of James said. Is there any six
[1:40:20] among you? Let him call for the elders
[1:40:23] of the church. Let him pray over him,
[1:40:25] anointing him with oil in the name of
[1:40:28] the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall
[1:40:31] save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
[1:40:33] him up. If ye have committed sins, they
[1:40:36] shall be forgiven you. Confess your
[1:40:39] faults one to another, and pray for one
[1:40:41] another that you might be healed. The
[1:40:44] effectual fervent prayer, that word in
[1:40:47] the Greek, it is energ.
[1:40:55] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:40:58] man avaleth much. If you read it in the
[1:41:02] amplified, it shows that the dynamics of
[1:41:05] God will bring it to pass.
[1:41:09] A righteous man, now the prophet said,
[1:41:11] "Now, a righteous man is not a sinless
[1:41:14] man, but a righteous man is a man that
[1:41:17] confesses his sins."
[1:41:20] And Elijah was a man like you.
[1:41:24] But Elijah was a righteous man. And
[1:41:26] Elijah locked up the heavens. But when
[1:41:29] it was time for the harvest
[1:41:31] rain,
[1:41:34] Elijah
[1:41:36] Elijah released a rapturing faith kind
[1:41:38] of rain that would produce a harvest.
[1:41:45] the most powerful weapon in your
[1:41:48] hand. And I know you
[1:41:51] brothers, y'all got some powerful
[1:41:53] weapons. And we ain't going to call them
[1:41:54] out by
[1:41:56] name. Some of you do not have
[1:41:59] certificates. And some of them your
[1:42:02] granddaddy give to
[1:42:04] you. But I say this to you, what you got
[1:42:08] in your gun safe is not the most
[1:42:10] powerful weapon.
[1:42:13] Come on, somebody. You can have a
[1:42:14] bazooka gun. You can have a 458 SOCOM.
[1:42:18] You can have the greatest of the
[1:42:19] greatest of the weapons. And that will
[1:42:22] not impress the enemy that you're facing
[1:42:24] in this hour.
[1:42:27] But let your home start dropping down to
[1:42:30] their knees. All of hell starts getting
[1:42:32] scared. The most powerful weapon in your
[1:42:36] home is prayer.
[1:42:40] Can you imagine what it was like for
[1:42:42] Isaiah when he's up there on the
[1:42:44] mountain and all of a sudden he comes
[1:42:46] down and God speaks to him said, "Go
[1:42:48] down there and speak to the king of
[1:42:50] Israel. Tell Hezekiah to make yourself
[1:42:53] ready cuz you're going to die." And as
[1:42:55] Isaiah starts walking down through the
[1:42:57] city, he starts going down through there
[1:42:59] and the people recognized that a prophet
[1:43:01] was in the streets and they started
[1:43:03] asking, "What are you here for? What are
[1:43:04] you condemning us for?" He said, "It's
[1:43:06] not for you, but it's for your king."
[1:43:08] your king is going to die. And Isaiah
[1:43:11] walked into the bedroom where Hezekiah
[1:43:13] was laying there sick. All of a sudden,
[1:43:16] when he pronounced judgment that he was
[1:43:17] going to die, Hezekiah turned his face
[1:43:20] to the wall and he started praying. I
[1:43:22] say prayer is the most powerful weapon
[1:43:24] that you can put back in your family.
[1:43:26] Prayer changes things. Prayer changes
[1:43:29] situations. Prayer even changes God's
[1:43:32] mind because he turned around and he
[1:43:34] prayed a short little prayer. and said,
[1:43:36] "God, I need more time to do more for
[1:43:38] your kingdom. God knows why you're
[1:43:40] asking. God knows your objective. God
[1:43:43] knows what you're going to do with more
[1:43:45] time." And
[1:43:46] Hezekiah, because of his prayer, changed
[1:43:49] the mind of God. The prophet said Isaiah
[1:43:52] was already on the outside of the city.
[1:43:54] Can you imagine what was running through
[1:43:56] Isaiah when all of a sudden, thus
[1:43:58] sayaith the Lord strikes him. I'd say
[1:44:00] Isaiah wasn't even embarrassed because
[1:44:02] he knew that he knew the power of thus
[1:44:04] sayaith the Lord. He walked down there
[1:44:06] with thus sayaith the Lord and he was
[1:44:08] going to walk back in there with thus
[1:44:09] sayaith the Lord. Thus sayaith the Lord
[1:44:11] will never embarrass a prophet and thus
[1:44:14] sayaith the Lord will never embarrass
[1:44:16] the prophet's people.
[1:44:20] Come on now. You know that William
[1:44:22] Brandon would say things, but when he
[1:44:24] said, "Thus sayaith the Lord," you could
[1:44:26] paint, you could bank all of heaven upon
[1:44:28] it because it was going to come to pass.
[1:44:30] Well, thus sayaith the Lord, you're
[1:44:32] going in a
[1:44:33] rapture. Thus sayaith the Lord, I see
[1:44:36] you marching in step onward Christian
[1:44:39] soldiers marching as to war. You may
[1:44:42] have not been walking that way, but
[1:44:44] Hezekiah, it's time to pray.
[1:44:49] I'd say mamas, daddies, I'd say I'd get
[1:44:52] myself together. If you're not with your
[1:44:54] mama, if you're not with your husband,
[1:44:56] I'd say I'd get a hold of them tonight
[1:44:58] before we leave this building. And we
[1:45:00] grabbed together by the union of faith
[1:45:02] and
[1:45:16] prayer. It is the most beautiful
[1:45:22] thing. He's a story. It's just a story,
[1:45:27] but it proves the power of
[1:45:32] prayer. But tell you some some black
[1:45:35] folk that was riding in a in a in a
[1:45:37] Cadillac and they was going down the
[1:45:39] road and the grandma was sitting up
[1:45:41] front and all of a sudden one of her
[1:45:42] grandsons in the back got deadly sick.
[1:45:49] And mama was a Christian. Grandma was a
[1:45:51] Christian. And she went in and they was
[1:45:54] driving past the home and she went into
[1:45:56] the home. She says, "Sir, we got a bad
[1:45:59] situation. My grandson is deathly sick
[1:46:01] and I need to pray. Do you have a
[1:46:04] closet because she recognized what Jesus
[1:46:07] said that when you pray, enter into your
[1:46:10] closet?" And she walked into that closet
[1:46:12] and she started talking to God. And
[1:46:14] before she got out of that closet, that
[1:46:16] little boy that was deadly sick in the
[1:46:18] car come knocked on the
[1:46:21] door. You know, the prophet told us that
[1:46:24] there is a prayer line. There is a
[1:46:26] prayer land. Brother Brandham was
[1:46:28] dealing with a with an elderly man one
[1:46:30] time in the land of discernment. And
[1:46:32] he's standing there. He said, "Now, I
[1:46:34] see an elderly man standing out there
[1:46:36] before me." He said, "Now," he said, "I
[1:46:37] see you've got several things wrong." He
[1:46:39] said, "One of them, you've got a rupture
[1:46:41] in your life." He said, ' But the other
[1:46:43] one, he said, 'You've got a cough.' He
[1:46:44] said, 'You got a bad cough.' He said, 'I
[1:46:46] see what it is. He said, 'You got
[1:46:47] tobacco.' And he said, he said, he said,
[1:46:49] that come that coughing that you got
[1:46:51] come from smoking. He said, now if
[1:46:53] you'll just throw that away, he said,
[1:46:55] God will heal you. He said, now you was
[1:46:57] just praying just a minute ago, Lord, if
[1:47:01] you'll let that man turn towards me,
[1:47:04] I'll believe you and I'll be healed. He
[1:47:06] said, now brother, I'm not I'm not
[1:47:09] reading your mind. He said, 'But there
[1:47:11] is a prayer land and in that prayer land
[1:47:14] there you was a praying. He said, I seen
[1:47:16] you just a few moments ago. So, brother,
[1:47:19] I'm telling you that there is a prayer
[1:47:21] land. So, all of your prayers that seem
[1:47:24] like they have gone unanswered, they're
[1:47:26] there in a land. Some of you have prayed
[1:47:29] for things that have never happened. I'd
[1:47:31] say don't you give up on them prayers.
[1:47:34] This is more than Disney World. Don't
[1:47:36] give up. This is more than just giving
[1:47:38] up and don't giving up on your dream.
[1:47:39] This is talking about prayer, the most
[1:47:41] powerful weapon. Don't you give up on
[1:47:43] your prayers. You prayed them prayers in
[1:47:46] faith and they're sitting there in the
[1:47:47] land waiting for God to release it.
[1:47:51] One place, Brother Man is talking with a
[1:47:54] boy in a line of discernment. He's
[1:47:56] talking to him. He's got him right in
[1:47:57] front of him and he starts talking to
[1:47:59] him. said, "Sir," he said, "now the
[1:48:02] reason why you're standing here," he
[1:48:05] said, "is because of mama that's done
[1:48:08] went on to glory, she had prayed many of
[1:48:11] prayers for this moment. And the reason
[1:48:14] why you are here is because that mama
[1:48:17] prayed.
[1:48:20] Your grandma prayed a lot of prayers."
[1:48:26] Hallelujah. You look at these shiflet
[1:48:28] boys. You look at their grandma, the
[1:48:30] power of prayer that they put on them
[1:48:32] boys. And you look at the family that's
[1:48:34] here.
[1:48:36] You look at You look at Homer
[1:48:38] Fraser. You look at him done gone. But
[1:48:41] God ain't forgot one of his prayers.
[1:48:45] Some of you are in this room right now
[1:48:48] because a man of God took the power of
[1:48:51] prayer seriously.
[1:48:54] What are you saying, Brother Andrew?
[1:48:56] I'll just say it like
[1:48:57] this. That
[1:48:59] prayer is like a great big
[1:49:06] river that it's got power behind
[1:49:11] it. But prayer is like the dam that
[1:49:15] holds up that
[1:49:17] river. That dam holds back all of that
[1:49:21] power all that time.
[1:49:23] It holds back all that power all that
[1:49:25] time. But if you by the token of prayer
[1:49:30] can begin to release and begin to turn
[1:49:33] those and unlock that dam, you'll begin
[1:49:35] to watch the very water and the very
[1:49:38] strength of your prayers and the life
[1:49:40] that is behind them gates that have been
[1:49:42] shut up. All that power that's behind
[1:49:45] them damn walls. They're backed up and
[1:49:47] they're damned up. I say if you'll start
[1:49:49] praying the power that is contained
[1:49:51] behind them walls when you begin to
[1:49:53] align your faith with the obedience and
[1:49:56] a s and a complete surrender. I say that
[1:49:59] prayer will unlock that gate. that
[1:50:02] prayer will unlock that gate and all of
[1:50:04] a sudden that power that is behind your
[1:50:07] prayer will begin to start flowing
[1:50:08] freely and all of a sudden you'll start
[1:50:10] seeing life and all of a sudden you'll
[1:50:12] see momentum behind your prayer and all
[1:50:14] of a sudden your prayers will be
[1:50:16] unstoppable forces in everything that it
[1:50:18] touches.
[1:50:21] But I say this, there's too many
[1:50:24] people there's too many people that are
[1:50:27] beaver damn Christians. They have shut
[1:50:30] off the floor. Oh my because they forgot
[1:50:33] how to pray. But Isaiah 41:18 says, "I
[1:50:38] will open rivers in high places and
[1:50:40] fountains in the midst of valleys and I
[1:50:42] will make the wilderness a pool of water
[1:50:44] and dry land springs of water."
[1:50:48] I want you to know that the power of God
[1:50:49] is not absent in your life and it is not
[1:50:52] obsolete.
[1:50:54] It is just waiting for you to unleash
[1:50:56] it.
[1:50:59] It's waiting on you to unleash it. So
[1:51:02] the power you need over your life is in
[1:51:05] this room. All you got to do is pray and
[1:51:07] ask and believe and it'll come open.
[1:51:12] Well, how powerful is prayer? Brother
[1:51:15] Maram was a very personal friend with a
[1:51:17] man by the name of Dr.
[1:51:18] Stonewall. And Dr. Stonewall had taken a
[1:51:21] lie detector and had completely turned
[1:51:24] it in a way that he could see it when
[1:51:27] somebody tells the truth if it was true
[1:51:30] or
[1:51:31] not. And he stuck it on a believer when
[1:51:35] they
[1:51:37] pray. He said that when he stuck it on
[1:51:40] that believer, he said you could see he
[1:51:43] said it went so past far farther past
[1:51:47] when they begin to pray. He said, 'But
[1:51:49] they took that instrument and they put
[1:51:51] it on a dying woman and they that dying
[1:51:54] woman be to pray and brother Brandham
[1:51:56] said it was not just a power. He said
[1:51:59] but it was a supernatural power that was
[1:52:01] coming out of that woman. He said it
[1:52:04] went completely over on its on its
[1:52:06] statistics. It completely went over. It
[1:52:09] was said that out of that woman's
[1:52:11] prayer, there was enough power to send a
[1:52:13] radio signal 55 times around the world
[1:52:17] by a woman that was praying in the
[1:52:20] supernatural.
[1:52:21] I'd say that if you would begin to pray
[1:52:24] in the Holy Ghost and pray in the
[1:52:26] spirit, then all the powers of heaven
[1:52:29] will be released right through your
[1:52:31] faith and through your surrender. That
[1:52:33] is why Paul said unto us in Ephesians
[1:52:36] 3:20, "Now unto him that is able to do
[1:52:39] exceedingly abundantly above all that
[1:52:41] you could ever ask, according to the
[1:52:44] power, the power that is behind you,
[1:52:49] according to the power that work within
[1:52:51] us."
[1:52:55] Paul said that you got the power. You
[1:52:58] got the power to do all things.
[1:53:01] Let me let me put it even more personal.
[1:53:04] There is somebody in your family that
[1:53:06] has the key to the power behind the
[1:53:11] damn. There is somebody on your job that
[1:53:14] has the power to release heaven on your
[1:53:17] job. There is somebody in this church
[1:53:20] that has the power to release God and
[1:53:23] eluce all of heaven's power. But the key
[1:53:27] is faith. But your prayer has got to be
[1:53:30] the one that opens up the rivers that
[1:53:33] have been trapped behind your prayer
[1:53:36] life.
[1:53:40] Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
[1:53:44] That Satan does not know what to do with
[1:53:46] a people that know how to pray.
[1:53:50] Let me say it in the words of
[1:53:52] Moses through the lips of Almighty God
[1:53:55] in Deuteronomy 28 and1 that it shall
[1:53:58] come to pass that if you will open up
[1:54:01] the rivers and you will unlock the dam
[1:54:05] that if thou shalt hearken diligently
[1:54:06] unto the voice of the Lord thy God, and
[1:54:08] to observe and to do all of his
[1:54:10] commandments which I command thee this
[1:54:12] day, that the Lord thy God will set thee
[1:54:14] on high above all nations of the earth.
[1:54:17] And all of these blessings shall come
[1:54:19] down this river and shall come upon you
[1:54:22] and come on your family and come on your
[1:54:24] job and come on your church and come on
[1:54:27] your children and they won't just come
[1:54:29] on you but they'll overtake you if thou
[1:54:32] shalt hearken unto the voice of the
[1:54:34] Lord. These blessings will be unleashed
[1:54:37] when you obey the
[1:54:40] voice of the Lord. Amen.
[1:54:44] Prayer don't just change your
[1:54:46] situation. It revives your soul. It
[1:54:50] heals your wounds. It births miracles.
[1:54:54] God said in sec 2 Coronicles 7:14 that
[1:54:58] if my people which are called by my name
[1:55:02] shall humble themselves and pray and
[1:55:04] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[1:55:07] ways then I will hear from
[1:55:12] heaven. The prophet said that a son of
[1:55:16] God has got more
[1:55:19] power than an archangel in heaven does.
[1:55:24] Prayer from a saint will go a million
[1:55:27] times higher than an
[1:55:30] angel. Jesus said men ought to always
[1:55:33] pray
[1:55:35] and not faint.
[1:55:37] So Jesus said don't just visit prayer
[1:55:41] but live in prayer. But I'll tell you
[1:55:45] what I really
[1:55:46] believe that people are
[1:55:49] afraid to unlock that power.
[1:55:54] The reason being is because it will
[1:55:56] change their normal.
[1:56:04] I wonder if you really
[1:56:06] prayed for your family. I wonder if you
[1:56:10] really prayed for the Holy Ghost. I
[1:56:12] wonder if you really prayed to get rid
[1:56:14] of your habits.
[1:56:17] Don't fear the flood. Live in the flow.
[1:56:24] Don't fear the flood. Don't fear the
[1:56:26] power. Just live in the flow. Don't you
[1:56:30] worry about what's going to change your
[1:56:31] normal. Don't you worry. Don't you worry
[1:56:34] about if you start really living what
[1:56:36] the message says at your job. Don't
[1:56:38] worry about it. Just live in it. Don't
[1:56:41] just don't get all shook up about what's
[1:56:43] going to happen if you really pray in
[1:56:45] front of your up front of your friends
[1:56:47] at school. Live in the flow. Don't be
[1:56:51] afraid. If you really get under the
[1:56:53] uncction of the Holy Ghost, you might
[1:56:56] dance.
[1:56:58] I'm scared. What it really might make me
[1:57:00] do, I tell you what it probably will
[1:57:02] make you do is shout off your makeup.
[1:57:04] It'll make you shout out all your bobby
[1:57:06] pins. It'll make you shout out all of
[1:57:08] your all of your your second mask and
[1:57:11] your third mask and your fourth
[1:57:13] mask. If I was you, I'd stop lying about
[1:57:16] being a Christian and live in the flow
[1:57:18] of a Christian. If I was you, if I was
[1:57:23] you, I wouldn't just take what I'm
[1:57:25] saying, but I'd find out what God really
[1:57:28] says about me.
[1:57:35] I'm coming.
[1:57:37] to a
[1:57:39] spot. But you've got to get to a
[1:57:45] spot where you don't
[1:57:47] care what happens in
[1:57:51] prayer. Do you understand what I'm
[1:57:53] saying? I'm saying you got to get to a
[1:57:55] spot in your prayer life that you pray
[1:57:58] through so
[1:58:01] much that some of you sisters that got
[1:58:03] more of the Holy Ghost than maybe your
[1:58:06] boyfriend or your husband that you won't
[1:58:09] care what
[1:58:12] happens. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:58:15] sorry. No, I'm not sorry. That wasn't
[1:58:18] me.
[1:58:20] But you got to break through in prayer
[1:58:22] into such a place that no matter what,
[1:58:24] kind of like Daniel
[1:58:25] did. There was going to be people that
[1:58:28] made fun of him and there was going to
[1:58:29] be people that was going to put him to
[1:58:30] death. But Daniel did not change the way
[1:58:34] that he lived just according to some
[1:58:36] what Donald Trump was going to sign
[1:58:38] into. He didn't change because of what
[1:58:40] king or what pope. Daniel was still
[1:58:42] going to pray. Daniel didn't care if the
[1:58:45] king had done signed a decree and he was
[1:58:47] trapped into it wrongly. Daniel was
[1:58:49] still going to pray. And when Daniel
[1:58:52] knew, it's powerful. Daniel knew that
[1:58:55] these things were going to happen. But
[1:58:57] the Bible said that Daniel went into his
[1:58:59] upper room and he got down on his knees
[1:59:02] and he threw back the curtains and he be
[1:59:04] to pray three times a day.
[1:59:07] But to me, the most powerful thing that
[1:59:09] the scripture depicts to us is that just
[1:59:13] like he had done a four time
[1:59:18] The time to pray is not after the decree
[1:59:20] is made. The time to pray is before.
[1:59:23] And when it is already in your life, it
[1:59:27] will not change according to what some
[1:59:29] man says.
[1:59:31] I feel like preaching right now. Your
[1:59:34] prayer life will not change. Your shout
[1:59:36] life will not change. Your
[1:59:37] circumstances.
[1:59:40] Come on, somebody. You getting drunk in
[1:59:42] the Holy Ghost. You speaking in tongues.
[1:59:44] You enjoying the moving of the Holy
[1:59:46] Ghost will not move because of some
[1:59:49] backsliden preacher that doesn't believe
[1:59:51] in the moving of the Holy Spirit.
[1:59:54] But because you have already met the
[1:59:56] offer, no matter what they say, you have
[2:00:00] already talked to him. And he says it's
[2:00:03] all right to dance. He says it's all
[2:00:05] right to shout. He says it's all right
[2:00:07] to sing. He says it's all right to pray
[2:00:09] in the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:12] [Applause]
[2:00:26] Jesus
[2:00:27] said that I give unto you the keys of
[2:00:30] the
[2:00:33] kingdom of
[2:00:35] heaven that whatsoever thou shalt bind
[2:00:38] on earth shall be bound in heaven.
[2:00:43] And whatsoever you loose on
[2:00:47] earth shall be
[2:00:50] loosed in
[2:00:54] heaven. Brother Random said this. He
[2:00:57] said, "If God will make demons
[2:01:01] here, God can stand here and with one
[2:01:06] prayer make every devil in this building
[2:01:09] leave.
[2:01:12] with one prayer.
[2:01:16] As you brothers prepare that clip just
[2:01:19] now, I want you I want to preface this
[2:01:22] quote and I'd
[2:01:24] like to
[2:01:27] invite I'd like to just close this
[2:01:30] service to me the greatest preacher
[2:01:32] that's ever walked in shoe leather. But
[2:01:35] I want to preface this quote. I want you
[2:01:38] to listen to what the prophet
[2:01:41] says when he talks about when prayer is
[2:01:44] made. He talks about Satan and he talks
[2:01:47] about the pressures trying to keep you
[2:01:50] from praying. But when prayer is
[2:01:54] made, I want you to listen close to it
[2:01:58] before this clip plays. Brother Brandham
[2:02:00] says this. He said, "Now moving up close
[2:02:02] to me now comes a spirit of death." He
[2:02:04] said, "It's black, hideous. The veil is
[2:02:07] parting back. I see a woman examined.
[2:02:09] It's a cancer. It's come to take your
[2:02:11] life. Jesus Christ comes to give you
[2:02:13] life. Who do you believe that tonight?
[2:02:16] The Lord Jesus. He said, "Every cancer
[2:02:18] sufferer in the building, stand to their
[2:02:20] feet at this time for the defeat of one
[2:02:22] of the arch enemies of the human race.
[2:02:25] Will you stand to your feet? Thou demon
[2:02:27] called cancer. You might hide from the
[2:02:30] doctor, but you can't hide from God.
[2:02:32] You're exposed. come out of these people
[2:02:35] in the name of Jesus Christ, you are
[2:02:37] defeated. Go on your road.
[2:02:42] I have never noticed this
[2:02:44] before, but the pressure that's erasing
[2:02:47] in the building when prayer is made, the
[2:02:49] pressure leaves. Amen. Amen. It's it's
[2:02:52] being healed. I've never seen it like
[2:02:54] this before. The pressure God bless you,
[2:02:58] sisters. On the name of Jesus Christ, go
[2:03:00] and be made well. Amen. Hallelujah. Come
[2:03:04] believing.
[2:03:07] You were healed standing right back
[2:03:08] there just a few moments ago. Now go eat
[2:03:10] whatever you want to. Jesus Christ.
[2:03:12] Glory.
[2:03:17] You believe.
[2:03:19] All right. Look here at me just a
[2:03:21] moment. You believe me to be his
[2:03:22] prophet? There's something strange about
[2:03:24] you. It's a You've had arthritis. Ever
[2:03:28] arthritis case in the building? Raise
[2:03:30] your hand. or if you can't stand.
[2:03:32] Almighty God, author of life, I now in
[2:03:35] the name of Jesus Christ by the legal
[2:03:38] rights of the cross and by the anointing
[2:03:40] of the Holy Spirit that you're now I
[2:03:42] condemn every suffering devil of
[2:03:45] arthritis and ask it to leave this
[2:03:47] audience at this time in Jesus Christ's
[2:03:49] name. Amen. You're defeated. It's gone.
[2:03:52] Your ass go across the platform
[2:03:54] rejoicing.
[2:03:56] Amen. Everyone that
[2:03:59] Amen. marvelous. Our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:04:03] you believe it. That condition left you
[2:04:04] standing there in a condition. Do you
[2:04:05] believe it left you while you were
[2:04:06] standing there at the believing at that
[2:04:08] time? In the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:10] Christ, I condemn the enemy and ask that
[2:04:13] it goes in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Go
[2:04:16] rejoicing, sister, thanking God for his
[2:04:18] goodness and his mercy. Heart trouble
[2:04:21] means the more to God than nothing else.
[2:04:23] Every person with heart trouble, stand
[2:04:25] to your feet at this time and say, "I
[2:04:27] accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my
[2:04:28] healer." And a glorious shout, "Almighty
[2:04:31] God, I condemn the enemy of this woman's
[2:04:33] body and the enemy of everyone in here.
[2:04:36] Come out, Satan, in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:04:55] Something strange happened at that time.
[2:05:01] Someone who was here at suffering with a
[2:05:04] heart trouble that was in a wheelchair
[2:05:07] should have raised at the time and have
[2:05:09] been healed. Someone is bound in a
[2:05:12] wheelchair that's crippled up by a devil
[2:05:14] of heart trouble should have raised. I
[2:05:16] didn't get the vision of the person just
[2:05:18] who it was. It looked like a dark
[2:05:19] complexed person that raised. All right,
[2:05:21] bring your bring your patient. You
[2:05:23] believe with all your heart that Jesus
[2:05:25] Christ, the son of God, will make you
[2:05:27] well standing here. Oh God, I condemn
[2:05:30] this enemy and ask that he goes through
[2:05:32] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless
[2:05:34] you, sister. Go believing with all your
[2:05:37] heart. Bow your heads just a moment,
[2:05:39] will you, Reverend?
[2:05:51] Almighty God, a deaf spirit moving over
[2:05:54] this
[2:05:54] woman. It's the enemy's business to do
[2:05:57] this. Cause her to be killed. But thou
[2:06:00] art here to deliver her. Faith cometh by
[2:06:03] hearing, hearing of the word. She
[2:06:06] cannot. If she cannot hear, how could
[2:06:08] faith come? I ask that you deliver the
[2:06:11] woman. Come out of her, Satan. I adure
[2:06:13] thee to leave the woman in the name of
[2:06:15] Jesus Christ. Leave her.
[2:06:19] You hear me?
[2:06:22] Can you hear me now? Can you hear me
[2:06:24] now? I missed a whisper. You're healed.
[2:06:27] Your nervousness is gone. Go on your
[2:06:29] road rejoicing and praising God. And you
[2:06:31] can hear. Let's say thanks be to God.
[2:06:33] Thanks be to God. You were healed when
[2:06:35] you come up through the line down there
[2:06:36] when the heart trouble crew was healed a
[2:06:38] while ago. You was healed also. will go
[2:06:39] on your road rejoicing, thanking God and
[2:06:41] saying, "Praise be to God." Would you
[2:06:43] come, lady? You believe with all your
[2:06:45] heart. You believe me to be his servant.
[2:06:48] If God will reveal to me your trouble,
[2:06:50] will you accept your healing? It's in
[2:06:52] your back. Is that right? Jesus Christ
[2:06:55] can make you whole now. Do you believe
[2:06:56] that?
[2:06:58] Father, in the name of thy son, the Lord
[2:07:00] Jesus, I condemn this devil. It's bound
[2:07:02] this woman. You laid your hand on one
[2:07:04] that had been bound for many years and
[2:07:06] loosed her. And I do likewise tonight to
[2:07:09] this woman in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:07:11] Go on your road rejoicing, sister, and
[2:07:13] be made well for God's glory. All right.
[2:07:16] You believe, sir, with all your heart.
[2:07:18] How many in here believe right now for
[2:07:19] your healing?
[2:07:21] This will be a marvelous time for
[2:07:22] everybody to be healed.
[2:07:26] I'm going to ask you to do
[2:07:32] something. Oh, here's the lady.
[2:07:36] Oh
[2:07:37] sister, you should rise. You should
[2:07:40] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Put
[2:07:43] your hands over on her while the rest of
[2:07:44] the audience puts their hands on one
[2:07:46] another for a prayer just now. Come sir,
[2:07:50] you believe that Jesus Christ is sure to
[2:07:51] make you well. Satan, leave the man in
[2:07:54] Jesus Christ's name. There she is up out
[2:07:57] of the up out of the chair. The power of
[2:08:00] God. I seen the woman in a vision going
[2:08:01] without the chair. There she is. Let's
[2:08:04] say praise be to God. afflicted, twisted
[2:08:07] in here or sitting in a wheelchair, she
[2:08:09] rises in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:08:11] There's a there she stands healed and
[2:08:13] well. Every person in here wants to get
[2:08:15] healed, stand to your feet right now.
[2:08:17] Rise up out of the wheelchairs. Throw
[2:08:19] away your crutches. Almighty God, in the
[2:08:22] name of thy son, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:08:24] I condemn every devil's spirit. I
[2:08:26] liberate these people through Jesus
[2:08:28] Christ's name. Satan, you're a loser.
[2:08:30] You're defeated. Come out of the people
[2:08:32] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:08:33] Amen. Amen.
[2:08:37] How many wants to receive their
[2:08:40] healing? You see, what was Satan trying
[2:08:43] to do? He was to trying to block that
[2:08:46] woman. He said, you could see, he said,
[2:08:49] he said, I've never noticed this before.
[2:08:50] He said, but there's so much pressure in
[2:08:52] this room. He said, but the pressure
[2:08:53] leaves when healing comes. That woman
[2:08:57] was tried to be blocked by Satan. But
[2:08:59] all of all of a sudden a prophet spoke a
[2:09:01] vision over top of her life and Satan
[2:09:05] could not stop that vision because it
[2:09:06] was thus sayaith the Lord. It's thus
[2:09:09] sayaith the Lord by his stripes I am
[2:09:12] healed in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:09:15] Every person in here right now under the
[2:09:17] sound of our voice, Jesus said, "What
[2:09:20] things soever you desire when you pray,
[2:09:23] believe that you shall receive them and
[2:09:25] you shall have them." As a musicians,
[2:09:29] come let us bow our heads and pray.
[2:09:31] Heavenly Father, we come before you in
[2:09:33] the name of the most high God. There is
[2:09:36] no God like you. Lord, we realize, Lord,
[2:09:39] that you have come and you have laid
[2:09:41] this upon our heart for your people's
[2:09:43] sake. You have spoken unto us directly.
[2:09:46] It is time to unleash heaven's power.
[2:09:49] You said when you were standing here
[2:09:50] right before you left, all power in
[2:09:53] heaven and earth is given unto me.
[2:09:55] Father, you told us to go into all the
[2:09:57] world and to baptize them in the name of
[2:10:00] the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, we have
[2:10:02] done that. We have committed everything
[2:10:04] that we are under the gospel and the
[2:10:07] kingdom of Almighty God. And we stand
[2:10:09] here, Father, as righteous men, men that
[2:10:12] have confessed our sin, men and women
[2:10:14] that believe what you have said in your
[2:10:16] word. And we ask, Father, that you would
[2:10:19] hear our prayer through the blood of
[2:10:20] Jesus Christ. And the prophet taught us
[2:10:23] that when we pray in the name of Jesus
[2:10:25] Christ, it's as if our Lord is praying
[2:10:28] that. So, Father, I pray for back pain
[2:10:31] that it would leave in the name of Jesus
[2:10:33] Christ. I pray for every person that has
[2:10:36] suffered with cancer. I pray that that
[2:10:38] cancer would leave in the name of Jesus
[2:10:41] Christ. For every person that has dealt
[2:10:43] with problems in their kidneys, with
[2:10:46] different infections in their colon, I
[2:10:48] pray that the name of Jesus Christ would
[2:10:51] be over top of them and Satan would have
[2:10:53] to bow and obey the name of Jesus Christ
[2:10:56] that is here in this room. May every
[2:10:58] young person that has for that has
[2:11:01] forgot to call on your name at lunch,
[2:11:03] that has forgot to whisper a prayer
[2:11:06] before they go into school. I pray,
[2:11:08] Father, that you would give them the
[2:11:10] boldness that you gave the apostles to
[2:11:12] stand there before the Sanhedrin council
[2:11:15] and to stand there and proclaim the name
[2:11:17] of Jesus Christ. I pray that you would
[2:11:19] give us access to that boldness tonight
[2:11:22] that we believe that it isn't for days
[2:11:24] gone by, but we believe right now in
[2:11:27] this very special spot that the Holy
[2:11:29] Ghost would come near and you would
[2:11:31] dispose of the devil in our life.
[2:11:34] Father, I can hear a prophet say in the
[2:11:36] breaks that just at that time when the
[2:11:39] church is going up, then you begin to
[2:11:41] dispose of the enemy. Father, we realize
[2:11:44] that we are facing an enemy that is
[2:11:47] nothing but a bluff. He might have
[2:11:49] arrow. He might have a bow, but he ain't
[2:11:50] got no arrows for it. So, he's simply a
[2:11:53] buff, a bluff. Father, we know that your
[2:11:56] word is a sharp two-edged sword. So,
[2:11:59] Father, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:12:01] Christ that it would go through this
[2:12:03] congregation and it would begin to cut
[2:12:05] off unbelief and it would begin to cut
[2:12:07] off complexes and it would begin to cut
[2:12:09] off stigmas and heart problems would be
[2:12:12] fixed in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:12:15] sugar diabetes would be fixed in the
[2:12:17] name of Jesus Christ. That kidney
[2:12:19] problems would be fixed in the name of
[2:12:21] Jesus Christ. There would be feelings of
[2:12:24] the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus
[2:12:26] Christ. fear would leave in the name of
[2:12:28] Jesus Christ and faith would rise in the
[2:12:31] name of Jesus Christ. Father, I pray
[2:12:34] that you would liberate your children,
[2:12:36] those that are listening on the way of
[2:12:38] the internet. Father, I pray that you
[2:12:40] would unleash heaven's power. Father,
[2:12:43] may you hear our prayer coming through
[2:12:45] the blood cell and may you release,
[2:12:48] Father, the things that we speak over
[2:12:50] our prayer just now.
[2:12:53] Now, brothers and sisters, I invite you
[2:12:56] to lay your hands on the brother beside
[2:12:58] you, the sister beside you and to join
[2:13:02] your faith
[2:13:04] together. You got a decision to make
[2:13:06] right now. Joshua had a decision to make
[2:13:09] one day and he turned and he said, "Son,
[2:13:12] stand still." Moses had a decision to
[2:13:15] make one day and he stretched out a rod.
[2:13:18] The prophet had a decision to make one
[2:13:20] day and he said, "I'll speak a squirrel
[2:13:22] in the existence here and a squirrel
[2:13:24] there and a squirrel here." But you got
[2:13:26] a decision to make right
[2:13:28] now. Will your prayer life change? Will
[2:13:32] your family be a powerhouse of a
[2:13:35] family? I say from this night on, Full
[2:13:38] Gospel Lighthouse will be a powerhouse
[2:13:41] of a church greater than what she ever
[2:13:43] has been. I pray for every person that's
[2:13:46] listening to me by the sound of my voice
[2:13:48] tonight across them airwaves that prayer
[2:13:51] would strike them that they would have a
[2:13:52] faith in their heart to believe that
[2:13:54] right now the God that William Brandham
[2:13:57] the will the God that William Brandham
[2:13:59] sought and the William Brham that
[2:14:01] preached this message to us and taught
[2:14:03] us that he's alive he's the same
[2:14:05] yesterday today and forever that you'll
[2:14:07] recognize right there where you are that
[2:14:09] almighty God is hearing your prayer now
[2:14:12] you
