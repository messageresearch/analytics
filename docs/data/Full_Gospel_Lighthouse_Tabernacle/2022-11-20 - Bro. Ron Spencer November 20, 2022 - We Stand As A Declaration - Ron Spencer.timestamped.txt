[50:43] Lord
[50:44] it'd be wonderful to us so good to see
[50:46] each and every one of you this morning
[50:49] I always think Sunday morning is so
[50:51] special and well what a service we had
[50:53] here last night
[50:55] [Music]
[50:57] and we're going to have a baby
[50:59] dedication today
[51:01] first of all I want to say how glad we
[51:03] are to have brother Kenny with us
[51:07] his Widowmaker was stopped up third 98
[51:11] percent
[51:13] and God rich in his Mercy
[51:18] they were able to put a stent through
[51:20] that
[51:21] and he's sitting here and that just
[51:23] happened just a few days ago and he's
[51:25] sitting here with us this morning and
[51:27] amen and we are so thankful for that
[51:30] brother brother Kenny our prayers have
[51:32] been with you
[51:33] and you've got a good nurse sitting
[51:35] beside of you I commissioned her to take
[51:38] care of you
[51:42] that's a big deal right there boy amen
[51:45] and so God bless you brother Kenny we
[51:48] sure will love you with all of our
[51:49] hearts and
[51:51] say that behind our backs behind your
[51:55] back and we sure love you with all of
[51:57] our hearts and
[51:59] amen for the clearance we we are sure
[52:02] praying for your family
[52:04] and uh
[52:05] we were we were honored to be able to
[52:08] stand for Eugene and uh and for the
[52:12] family there Loretta his wife and
[52:15] and
[52:17] we were honored to lead him to the Lord
[52:20] he went to the same doctors had the same
[52:22] type of cancer
[52:24] that we we struggle with he he had had
[52:27] it about 14 months maybe and maybe a bit
[52:30] longer than that
[52:33] they gave him the same medicine the same
[52:35] type of treatments
[52:39] and the Lord chose to take him home and
[52:41] so
[52:42] and so we just are praying that for
[52:45] those that were at the funeral that God
[52:47] would strike their hearts
[52:49] they could turn their their focus
[52:50] towards the Lord and so that's what our
[52:53] our greatest focus is today and so turn
[52:57] our hearts toward him and so amen maybe
[53:00] this is your first service in the house
[53:01] of the Lord and maybe a little shouting
[53:04] might terrify you for a moment but you
[53:07] know we worship God
[53:11] the Jews worship God they stand and
[53:13] dance at the welding wall for all day
[53:15] long and so they did that for centuries
[53:18] and so
[53:19] people in the world go to ball games and
[53:21] they get all excited and
[53:24] the devil don't say anything about that
[53:26] but you
[53:27] you let somebody get excited in the
[53:29] house of the Lord and people get real
[53:31] nervous it's the devil that gets nervous
[53:37] brother biscoll
[53:40] we had a conversation one time as we
[53:42] were going into a meeting
[53:45] and
[53:47] he said brother Rhonda you get nervous
[53:50] I said I do I do get nervous as I'm
[53:52] getting ready to preach and he said I
[53:55] asked another great man one time about
[53:57] that
[53:59] brother Branham he said brother Brandon
[54:02] you get nervous he said oh yeah I get
[54:04] nervous
[54:05] he said I get nervous because of the
[54:07] responsibility of the word
[54:09] he said but another nervousness is the
[54:12] devil gets nervous
[54:16] Hallelujah because he knows he's getting
[54:18] ready to be defeated
[54:20] amen we're honored to be able to
[54:22] dedicate a little fella today he's named
[54:26] very special Enoch Joseph
[54:29] I thought about this as
[54:31] they have named him Enoch
[54:35] it's to be their last child
[54:39] unless God does something else and so
[54:43] is capable in your family so
[54:46] and so
[54:48] they've named their last child Enoch
[54:50] Enoch is a name of rapture
[54:53] we know that that Enoch walked with God
[54:57] it's a name of rapture
[54:59] Joseph was a type of Jesus Christ
[55:02] lived so perfect I was just a little one
[55:04] little blemish in his life
[55:07] he was born October the 18th
[55:10] my brother's birthday
[55:13] now people that are born under that sign
[55:16] our people that are people are very
[55:19] peaceful
[55:23] partnership is very important to them
[55:27] and their real family people
[55:29] and they'll like people that'll mirror
[55:33] themselves
[55:34] you so where brother Ron just is signs
[55:36] important absolutely that's God's first
[55:40] Bible and you're born under your side
[55:43] and if you look at if you look at your
[55:45] sign the date that you're born under
[55:48] it'll actually tell your life story
[55:53] the scripture says in Deuteronomy
[55:56] chapter 6 and verse 4.
[55:58] hear o Israel
[56:00] the Lord our God is one Lord
[56:03] and doubt shall love the Lord thy God
[56:05] with all thine heart and with all thy
[56:08] soul and with all thy might
[56:10] and these words which I command thee
[56:12] this day shall be in thine heart
[56:15] Thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[56:18] thy children
[56:19] and shall talk of them when thou set us
[56:21] in thy house and thou shalt walk and
[56:24] when thou walkest by the way and when
[56:26] thou lies down and when thou lies riseth
[56:29] up
[56:31] I thought of this scripture as for you
[56:34] [Music]
[56:36] except the Lord build a house
[56:40] they labor in vain
[56:42] that build it
[56:44] except the Lord keep the city the
[56:47] Watchman
[56:48] waketh but in vain
[56:52] it is vain for you to rise up early and
[56:55] to set up late deep breath of Sorrows
[56:59] for so he giveth his beloved sleep
[57:04] Lo children are an inheritance of the
[57:08] Lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[57:11] reward
[57:13] as arrows are in the hand of a Mighty
[57:16] Man
[57:17] so are children
[57:19] of the youth
[57:20] happy is the man
[57:24] that half his quiver
[57:27] full of them
[57:29] they shall not be ashamed but they shall
[57:32] speak
[57:34] with the enemies at the gate amen God
[57:37] bless you

[1:02:25] this is brother Murphy Wong
[1:02:28] and we were at brother biscal's after I
[1:02:30] preached there after I just got the
[1:02:32] diagnosis
[1:02:34] and we had been called
[1:02:36] that we had cancer
[1:02:39] and we had the meeting and I preached
[1:02:40] courage
[1:02:41] go wash
[1:02:43] and take it back
[1:02:45] and we go to brother Tom Ray's house and
[1:02:48] we're all fellowshipping together it's
[1:02:49] probably 70 people there and I'm
[1:02:52] standing at the fireplace
[1:02:54] and I'm standing beside brother Murphy
[1:02:56] Wong
[1:02:58] and brother Murphy is standing there
[1:03:00] you'll enjoy this we're standing beside
[1:03:02] brother Murphy and brother Murphy's
[1:03:04] we're there and I said brother Murphy
[1:03:08] I see a child
[1:03:10] and he was thinking in his mind him and
[1:03:12] his wife
[1:03:14] Tracy
[1:03:15] he said oh no brother Ryan
[1:03:24] and I said I just see the vision of it
[1:03:27] I said no it's your daughter
[1:03:29] what we didn't know was his daughter it
[1:03:32] was impossible for them to have children
[1:03:37] you know God likes impossibilities
[1:03:42] you can't tell God it's impossible
[1:03:52] so this is both sets of grandparents
[1:03:56] brother Louise and sister Shirley
[1:04:00] and they're really proud of that only
[1:04:03] grand baby
[1:04:05] amen and brother Murphy and sister Tracy
[1:04:09] God knows how to take care of
[1:04:13] impossibilities
[1:04:15] what was a vision
[1:04:17] now is a reality
[1:04:20] give God a great big hand
[1:04:26] thank you
[1:04:31] for those that don't believe God does
[1:04:33] those things anymore we just say Satan
[1:04:36] you're alive
[1:04:38] amen amen
[1:04:47] amen all we are is a tool in the hand of
[1:04:50] the Lord
[1:04:51] amen so when God shows you a vision you
[1:04:54] you declare it you stand on it you have
[1:04:56] faith to believe it
[1:04:59] foreign
[1:05:11] I had a very emotional experience this
[1:05:13] week
[1:05:17] God deals with me in the night
[1:05:22] I thought Connie had her hand on my leg
[1:05:27] and I
[1:05:29] I know that we've been married
[1:05:33] a long time
[1:05:39] and that's just not what she does
[1:05:44] it was about four o'clock in the morning
[1:05:46] and I propped up and I looked
[1:05:49] and the angel of the Lord was setting
[1:05:52] on the bed and had his hand on my leg
[1:06:02] I thought that was pretty special
[1:06:09] laughs
[1:06:11] he's with us
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:16] amen any good to us
[1:06:19] the doctors told me this week stay on
[1:06:21] the course your labs are looking good
[1:06:23] got a good report
[1:06:26] continue to take the chemo of course
[1:06:28] they believe I'll take it the rest of my
[1:06:29] life
[1:06:31] and if that's the way it is and that's
[1:06:32] the way God chooses I am okay but I
[1:06:35] believe for a miracle
[1:06:37] and they're working on the support drugs
[1:06:40] to try to help me out that we're having
[1:06:42] some we're having some issues on the
[1:06:44] sideline and and so their their doctors
[1:06:47] are trying to help me
[1:06:49] and uh and so weird they said over the
[1:06:51] next six weeks it should begin to help
[1:06:54] and so they've changed some meds up for
[1:06:56] us and thank you for your prayers thank

[1:07:00] that are on the internet that pray for
[1:07:01] us thank you for that and uh I I danced
[1:07:05] over here just a bit ago because I think

[1:07:32] we've been speaking on I find I I find
[1:07:34] no fault
[1:07:36] but I want to speak today on we stand
[1:07:40] with a declaration
[1:07:44] I want to read the first scripture that
[1:07:46] we'll read and then you can be seated
[1:07:48] and I'm going to give you one scripture
[1:07:50] after another
[1:07:51] second Thessalonians chapter 3 and verse
[1:07:55] 13.
[1:08:01] and this is a very important scripture
[1:08:03] how many have you ever felt frustrated
[1:08:05] intimidated wore out
[1:08:10] yep I'm speaking to the right group
[1:08:18] but ye brethren
[1:08:22] we consider that ourselves part of that
[1:08:25] be not wary
[1:08:28] in well-doing
[1:08:30] I want you to read that with me
[1:08:32] but ye brethren
[1:08:34] be not weary
[1:08:36] in well-doing may the Lord bless the
[1:08:39] word this evening you can be seated
[1:08:45] Philippians chapter 3 and verse 14
[1:08:49] I press towards the mark
[1:08:53] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:08:56] in Christ Jesus
[1:08:59] in Matthew chapter 28 and verse 18 and
[1:09:03] Jesus came and spake unto them saying
[1:09:06] all power say that with me all power is
[1:09:11] given unto me in heaven and in Earth
[1:09:14] in John chapter 15 and verse 17 sister
[1:09:18] Stephanie sorry we're giving you a
[1:09:20] workout if ye abide in me and my words
[1:09:23] abide in you
[1:09:26] you shall ask
[1:09:28] what you will and it shall be done unto
[1:09:31] you
[1:09:32] sometimes we expect things and we forgot
[1:09:35] to ask for it
[1:09:37] Revelations chapter 3 and verse 21 to
[1:09:41] him that overcometh
[1:09:45] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:09:48] even
[1:09:50] as I also overcame and am set down with
[1:09:55] my father in his throne
[1:09:59] Romans chapter 8 and verse 31.
[1:10:03] what shall we then say to these things
[1:10:06] I want you to read this with us if God
[1:10:08] before us
[1:10:10] who can be against us let's say it again
[1:10:13] if God be for us
[1:10:16] who can be against us
[1:10:19] I wanted to reckon I wanted to remind
[1:10:22] you God had sent his message he has sent
[1:10:25] his prophet
[1:10:28] the bride is on the scene and there's
[1:10:31] nothing can stop this
[1:10:35] Jesus is coming
[1:10:39] the resurrection is going to happen
[1:10:43] dead Saints are going to come out of the
[1:10:46] ground and there's nothing that the
[1:10:48] devil can do to stop it
[1:10:50] Hallelujah
[1:10:55] and I want to remind Satan he has been a
[1:10:58] philosopher of the scriptures all of
[1:11:01] these decades and even centuries and he
[1:11:04] knows
[1:11:05] that Jesus is coming and the
[1:11:08] resurrection is at hand and the Rapture
[1:11:11] of the church is getting ready to take
[1:11:13] place and he cannot stop it
[1:11:22] brother random is going to speak in 1965
[1:11:27] invisible Union of the Bride
[1:11:30] it's one of the most powerful sermons of
[1:11:33] all the message in a few hours his lips
[1:11:36] will be sealed
[1:11:37] we would term his the greatest Prophet
[1:11:39] that ever lived on the Earth
[1:11:41] he's one to a generation
[1:11:44] he is a prophet to where that God will
[1:11:46] unfold the word to the bride
[1:11:48] the seals will be revealed the Thunders
[1:11:51] will be revealed the mysteries of God
[1:11:54] will be revealed everything that was
[1:11:56] hidden in the Bible will be revealed
[1:12:00] he is praying in this sermon and I want
[1:12:02] to just take a moment to just share this
[1:12:05] with you oh God knowing
[1:12:08] seeing how fragile we are knowing that
[1:12:11] we're walking on the brittle threads of
[1:12:13] the life of this Mortal life not knowing
[1:12:16] what time that we're going to be
[1:12:18] summoned to answer on high literally
[1:12:22] these are some of the last sermons he'll
[1:12:25] preach his lips will be sealed not
[1:12:28] knowing
[1:12:31] let us O Lord lay aside everything in
[1:12:35] her heart everything in our mind looks
[1:12:38] straight to your word tonight for you to
[1:12:41] come and interpret it living oracles
[1:12:44] Granite may your spirit fall on us
[1:12:47] anoint the word to our heart what that
[1:12:51] we might go from hence this evening
[1:12:54] people that are that are that we are
[1:12:57] that we might have a closer Insight on
[1:13:01] Jesus Christ granted Lord that we might
[1:13:04] understand the day that we're living in
[1:13:07] and the preparation of God for his
[1:13:10] people in this hour this great crucial
[1:13:13] dark time that we're now living in God
[1:13:16] anoint us not only as a speaker but hero
[1:13:19] and together
[1:13:22] might our hearts tremble at your word
[1:13:25] for the fear of the god is the beginning
[1:13:28] of the wisdom Grant these things father
[1:13:31] for we ask it in the name of Jesus
[1:13:33] Christ amen
[1:13:36] he said I'd like to title these few
[1:13:39] remarks that I was going to make here
[1:13:42] and some scriptures I'd like to follow
[1:13:44] up closely
[1:13:46] if the Lord is willing the Thanksgiving
[1:13:49] message
[1:13:51] to the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:13:55] Christ I'd like for you as a body of
[1:13:57] Believers to go listen to that this week
[1:14:02] he said I'm thankful to God to be living
[1:14:05] in the time of the closing Saints
[1:14:08] of the world's history
[1:14:12] I don't know if if I would have had a
[1:14:17] say-so before the foundation of the
[1:14:19] world
[1:14:20] and if God would have laid out the whole
[1:14:23] program to me and said to me I want you
[1:14:26] to preach
[1:14:27] and now what age do you desire to go to
[1:14:31] to the Earth to preach
[1:14:34] I would have chosen this age
[1:14:38] I'd like to make this declaration today
[1:14:40] I would have chosen this age
[1:14:50] it's a golden age
[1:14:53] I certainly would have loved to have
[1:14:56] been here during the time of the visit
[1:14:58] his visit to the Earth but still I think
[1:15:02] right now is the greatest times
[1:15:06] because it's a time that he's coming to
[1:15:09] take a people that he's redeemed
[1:15:13] I'm part of that sentence
[1:15:18] nearing the resurrection
[1:15:20] when all the redeemed will come forth
[1:15:24] and our loved ones are a part of that
[1:15:27] sentence
[1:15:31] what a glorious opportunity that we have
[1:15:34] to speak to a dying people a great time
[1:15:38] we're enthused about it
[1:15:41] and we know that history is closing out
[1:15:44] and the world's history will soon be
[1:15:46] over and then we're going to step into a
[1:15:49] new day to a new great Millennium as one
[1:15:53] believer I believe in a millennium a
[1:15:55] millennium reign of Christ A Thousand
[1:15:58] Years upon the Earth the physical Return
[1:16:01] of the Lord Jesus to take a physical
[1:16:03] people glorified by his cleansing blood
[1:16:07] Give the Lord a great big hand right
[1:16:10] there
[1:16:17] huh
[1:16:18] he was a man when he was dying on the
[1:16:21] cross crying for mercy
[1:16:23] he said that's right but he was God on
[1:16:27] Easter morning when he broke that seal
[1:16:32] what's in the Tomb and he rose up and
[1:16:34] ascended on high ever living to make the
[1:16:36] intercession every man woman that's ever
[1:16:40] amounted to a hill of beings believe
[1:16:43] that
[1:16:45] he's the same yesterday and forever
[1:16:48] believeth thou this
[1:16:50] yes sir he is just as great right here
[1:16:54] among us tonight as he was then last
[1:16:58] night I thought was a pivotal sermon
[1:17:03] for you to be an overcomer take that
[1:17:06] sermon and listen to it over and over
[1:17:08] again
[1:17:09] elalon lives on the inside of us
[1:17:15] he is our healer
[1:17:20] but brother Ron you're you're standing
[1:17:22] there with fourth stage cancer you're
[1:17:25] taking chemo every day doesn't matter
[1:17:29] it does not matter
[1:17:31] because Satan with all of his forces
[1:17:34] cannot take my life
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:46] he said be persistent
[1:17:50] Hold Your Position in Christ hold your
[1:17:53] confession hold fast your confession in
[1:17:57] Christ how important is that that's our
[1:18:01] declaration today I am identified with
[1:18:04] Jesus Christ
[1:18:05] [Applause]
[1:18:09] Jesus saith unto him no man that having
[1:18:11] put his hand to the plow and looking
[1:18:13] back is fit for the kingdom of God
[1:18:17] this is one of my favorite scriptures
[1:18:19] and you've heard it thousands of times
[1:18:21] year of God little children
[1:18:24] and I've overcame them because greater
[1:18:27] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:18:30] the world
[1:18:36] this is one of my favorite quotes
[1:18:39] God's purpose
[1:18:42] can never be defeated
[1:18:47] I want you to say that with me God's
[1:18:50] purpose can never be defeated there is
[1:18:54] nothing that can defeat it so how happy
[1:18:56] we ought to be today rest upon a
[1:18:59] beautiful revelation of the Living God
[1:19:01] that there's neither things present nor
[1:19:03] things to come there's no sickness no
[1:19:06] sorrow no death no pearls
[1:19:10] nothing can separate us for the purpose
[1:19:13] of the Living God what God has imagined
[1:19:16] in his mind what God has purposed in his
[1:19:18] heart
[1:19:19] to bring to pass there is no demon
[1:19:23] there's no power there's nothing that
[1:19:26] can separate God from his great Immortal
[1:19:29] interpretal
[1:19:31] Eternal plan
[1:19:33] it's going to be just as he said it
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:41] God deposited his eternal seed of life
[1:19:44] on the inside of you Timothy
[1:19:48] there's no issues of life
[1:19:52] there's no devil in hell can take that
[1:19:55] out of you
[1:19:57] go ahead and give him a praise right now
[1:20:08] we're in the season just before the
[1:20:10] coming
[1:20:11] we're seeing blending of dimensions
[1:20:15] purple hair blue hair
[1:20:19] Sodom and Gomorrah everywhere
[1:20:22] no moral no moral function whatsoever
[1:20:27] politics is rotten the sports world is
[1:20:30] rotten governments are rotten
[1:20:34] everything is rotten education's at its
[1:20:37] end
[1:20:39] teachers cannot teach moral values
[1:20:42] anymore
[1:20:44] matter of fact you can't discipline your
[1:20:46] own children
[1:20:49] the mouth of hell has enlarged itself
[1:20:52] but in all of that we make our stand
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:20:58] God knew in this day there would be a
[1:21:00] pride that refused to compromise
[1:21:04] that refuses to be polished up by the
[1:21:07] world that refuses a watered-down gospel
[1:21:14] that refuses to be a mixer of the world
[1:21:18] but we will take our stand
[1:21:28] the Stop and roll our shoulders back and
[1:21:30] take courage
[1:21:31] God's with us
[1:21:34] if God be for us who can be against us
[1:21:38] be strong of good courage
[1:21:41] we'll believe us
[1:21:45] we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:21:53] we fight
[1:21:56] you may not put a poster on your back
[1:21:59] you may not put a sign up
[1:22:01] but you tell the devil you're not

[1:22:34] he fights our battles he wins our Wars
[1:22:41] we cast out Satan with Holy Ghost
[1:22:43] boldness
[1:22:44] he has authorized us to take our tongue
[1:22:48] which is the most Supernatural thing
[1:22:49] about us and take the word of life and
[1:22:53] speak a world into creation
[1:22:57] I'm not talking about the sun moon and
[1:22:59] stars but you can have peace in your
[1:23:02] marriage

[1:23:09] now give him a hand right there
[1:23:17] you can have children that respect you
[1:23:21] I'm not talking about being a dictator
[1:23:23] but you can be a leader to where your
[1:23:25] children can look up to you
[1:23:30] you can live an overcoming life
[1:23:33] you can't have a home of Prayer
[1:23:40] we will
[1:23:43] not maybe we will defeat Satan
[1:23:47] [Applause]
