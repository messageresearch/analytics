[18:36] days. So, amen. Let's just all pray and
[18:39] believe together. Our [snorts] gracious
[18:41] father, as we come to [music] you, Lord,
[18:44] and Father, what a great honor it is to
[18:46] stand
[18:48] before an awesome God.
[18:50] And Lord, we take these requests before
[18:52] you, [music] Father, as
[18:55] may seem little to some, but Father is
[18:58] big to others. [music]
[19:00] And Lord, when you come by, Father, you
[19:03] make the difference.
[19:05] And Lord Jesus, we're praying
[19:08] tonight, Lord. Just
[19:11] just come by, Father, in your own way,
[19:13] in your special way. Lord, there's needs
[19:15] in this building, Father, that wasn't
[19:17] mentioned. There's needs in each and
[19:19] every heart, Lord, that as they uplifted
[19:22] that hand, there was something laid
[19:24] behind it. [music] And Father God, we're
[19:27] praying for Brother Kelly tonight. Lord,
[19:31] may that vessel, may that man just step
[19:33] [music] aside and Lord, you use that
[19:35] vessel. He's traveled the miles. He's
[19:37] put in the time. Lord, may we put
[19:39] [music] in our time, may we pull from
[19:41] the gift. And Lord, may the preaching be
[19:44] so easy. May, Father,
[19:46] that last one.
[19:49] And maybe, Father, it might not be the
[19:51] last one. Maybe it be someone here that
[19:54] just needs a little closer walk. Maybe
[19:56] someone here has got financial burdens.
[19:57] Lord, we don't know what it is, but
[20:00] we're praying, Father, for each and
[20:02] every need. All the [music] the cancers,
[20:05] pray and for our pastor.
[20:08] And Lord, we know, Father, that
[20:13] your great plan in your great economy,
[20:15] you knew what we have need of. And you
[20:18] knew, Lord, we're going to come to you.
[20:21] So, Father, we commit the service in
[20:22] your hands. We just want to tell you,
[20:25] Lord, how much we love you and
[20:26] appreciate you. Thank you, Lord, for
[20:28] being so good to us.
[20:30] And Father, we commit the [music]
[20:31] service. We commit all things.
[20:34] In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it
[20:36] all. Amen. [snorts]
[20:39] Amen.

[48:23] brethren, you have no need that I write
[48:26] unto you.
[48:27] For yourselves know perfectly that the
[48:30] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[48:32] the night.
[48:34] For when they say peace and safety, then
[48:38] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[48:40] travail upon a woman with child, and
[48:42] they shall not escape.
[48:44] But ye brethren, this is speaking about
[48:47] you, but ye brethren are not in
[48:50] darkness. Thank God for that.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; That that day should overtake you as a
[48:56] thief. Ye are all the children of light
[48:59] and the children of the day. We are not
[49:01] of the night nor of the darkness. Let's
[49:06] just ask the Lord to bless us tonight.
[49:07] Father, we we bow in your divine
[49:10] presence uh today, Lord, with
[49:13] thanksgiving in our hearts, Lord, for
[49:15] your grace and your mercy. Even Lord,
[49:18] coming through thanksgiving this week on
[49:20] Thursday, Lord, we have so much to be
[49:23] grateful for and thankful for. Above
[49:26] all, Lord, we thank you for eternal life
[49:28] that rests within our souls, Lord.
[49:30] We thank you for keeping us Lord in the
[49:32] way Lord bringing us safely. Father I
[49:35] pray Father for Brother Ron,
[49:38] Sister Connie,
[49:40] the ministers of this assembly, the
[49:43] deacons trustee, the leoty. Lord, may
[49:45] your grace Lord rest upon each and every
[49:48] one of them. Lord, you know, Father,
[49:51] what there is in their hearts, Lord. You
[49:53] know what need they would have, Lord, in
[49:55] their lives, Lord. I pray, Father, that
[49:57] you would take control of this service
[49:59] tonight, Lord. The little thoughts,
[50:02] Lord, that you've laid upon our heart,
[50:03] Lord. Give us clarity of thought,
[50:06] Father. May, Father, our voice, Lord,
[50:09] become one with yours, Lord. And if
[50:11] there would be anything, Lord, that
[50:12] would be said, Lord, would you stop us,
[50:14] Lord, so that we would only say what you
[50:17] would have us to say tonight, Lord? We
[50:19] completely yield our members onto you.
[50:22] We thank you, Father, for healing the
[50:24] sick, Lord. Be with those Lord that are
[50:27] distraught. Lord, may your grace rest on
[50:29] each one. We commit this service onto
[50:31] you now for the glory of God. Take
[50:33] control Lord of the speaker Lord as I
[50:36] would yield myself to you soul, body and
[50:38] spirit for the glory of Jesus Christ. In
[50:40] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[50:43] bless you. You may have your seats
[50:45] tonight.
[50:46] Amen. Why don't you look at your
[50:48] neighbor and and let them know that God
[50:50] is in control.
[50:53] God is in control.
[50:56] God is in control. I'd like to speak for
[50:58] a few moments tonight on a thought um
[51:02] that I've been looking at at home
[51:03] prepared for this time.
[51:06] Brother Brandham in in many messages, he
[51:09] talks about very precisely about when a
[51:12] person would have a child or a baby and
[51:15] how that you make preparation for that
[51:17] child. We can look through the scripture
[51:19] and we can see the hand of God on
[51:22] generations that have gone before us.
[51:25] And we know that God is in complete
[51:27] control of what is ever transpiring.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that Satan can't
[51:32] touch a hair on your head without first
[51:34] getting permission from Almighty God.
[51:37] So no matter what you're going through,
[51:39] what you've come through, and what you
[51:41] may be about to go through, we know one
[51:43] thing that we can settle in our hearts
[51:44] is that God is in control, and God
[51:48] doesn't allow mistakes to transpire, but
[51:50] he knows each one. He knows exactly what
[51:53] what you would be dealing with at any
[51:55] given time. He's God
[51:59] &gt;&gt; and he knows all things.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. in in the book of Isaiah u and I
[52:05] just want to just lay these two
[52:07] scriptures prior to moving forward in
[52:09] our thought today and that is arise
[52:12] shine for thy light has come Isaiah 61-2
[52:15] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[52:17] thee for behold the darkness shall cover
[52:19] the earth and gross darkness the people
[52:21] but the Lord shall rise upon thee and
[52:23] his glory shall be seen upon thee and
[52:26] then in Zechariah which are very
[52:28] familiar scriptures to each one of us
[52:30] but it shall be one day which shall be
[52:32] known to the Lord not day nor night. But
[52:34] it shall come to pass that at evening
[52:36] time, it shall be light.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; From before the foundation of the world
[52:41] was ever laid, before there was a
[52:43] molecule, before there was an atom,
[52:45] anything was put in its place or a human
[52:48] heartbeat, God had thoughts and
[52:50] attributes that he wanted to express.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; He had a purpose and he had an internal
[52:56] eternal intention.
[52:58] God's not haphazard when the way he does
[53:00] things like some people maybe conduct
[53:02] their business affairs. But God is very
[53:04] precise in whatever he does and whatever
[53:06] he will do.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where you would be
[53:10] sitting tonight.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly what the thoughts would
[53:13] be. He knew every song that would be
[53:15] sung tonight. He knew every thought that
[53:17] would ever transpire because he's
[53:19] almighty God. Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; When he makes a plan or he prepares to
[53:24] make a plan, everything is going
[53:25] according to his divine purpose. That's
[53:28] why brother Brandham could tell us even
[53:30] in invisible union that you're going to
[53:32] a wedding in the sky. In God's mind,
[53:34] it's already concluded.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; We're just we're just living out the
[53:38] revelation of it.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; We're coming through a time period maybe
[53:42] that is a lot of darkness upon people's
[53:44] lives and upon people's hearts and and
[53:47] the way they conduct their affairs. But
[53:49] the bride of Jesus Christ has got the
[53:51] light of the word. She's walking in step
[53:54] with a composer. She's standing
[53:56] according to the divine purpose of God.
[53:59] She's not moved from left to right.
[54:01] She's not she's not moved by winds of
[54:03] doctrine. She's standing very sure in
[54:05] this hour. Just as the North Star would
[54:08] stand sure, you're standing sure in this
[54:10] hour. And we can we can say that that
[54:12] it's only God's amazing grace to each
[54:15] and every one of us because God purposed
[54:17] to have a bride.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; And there's going to be nothing that
[54:21] Satan can do or he can say that's going
[54:23] to stop it.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Uh he can try with all that's within him
[54:27] and try to move one way or another way.
[54:29] But I I just want to let you know is
[54:31] that God's eternal purpose will not go
[54:34] unattended.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; He's already attending to it. We're just
[54:39] part of it. Amen.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; And when he purposed, he he'd have a
[54:43] bride. He wants a bride that's going to
[54:45] reflect his nature.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; He wants a bride that's redeemed by his
[54:49] blood.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; We really have nothing to do with it
[54:52] outside of a yielded vessel onto
[54:54] Almighty God.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; He wants a bride that is washed in the
[54:58] waters of the word. Amen. He wants a
[55:00] bride that's sealed by his spirit.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Not just an anointing on the flesh,
[55:06] &gt;&gt; but he wants something that is going
[55:07] goes down deeper than that. You want
[55:09] something in the soul realm where where
[55:11] something that anchors to the rock of
[55:13] ages.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; That you know who you are in Christ.
[55:16] That you're unmovable in Christ. You
[55:18] stand assured in Christ. Amen. You have
[55:21] a revelation of who you are. You have a
[55:23] revelation of the word of Almighty God.
[55:25] God has been gracious to you to open
[55:27] your eyes to what's transpiring in the
[55:30] day we're living in. Therefore, we can
[55:32] say that we're not children of darkness,
[55:34] but we are the children of the light.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a purpose in your life.
[55:40] Amen. God, he will say, "I I have a
[55:42] people who will bear forth my name. I'll
[55:45] have a wife who shares my throne. I'll
[55:47] have a bride who walks in my image
[55:48] that's filled with my life."
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a reason.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was looking at that just a
[55:55] little thought at home a couple of days
[55:58] ago, how great our God is. Our God is so
[56:01] great that that that he could he filled
[56:04] all space and time, but yet he comes so
[56:06] small that he can live within your
[56:08] heart.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's God.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're fulfilling our part of
[56:13] the role.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can look at it through
[56:16] scripture from Genesis through
[56:18] Revelation. The Bible is the unfolding
[56:20] of the great eternal purpose of Almighty
[56:23] God.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the sranian church age,
[56:26] brother Brandham said the heart purpose,
[56:28] the eternal purpose of God was to take a
[56:30] bride of his own choosing that was
[56:33] purpose was in himself. And being
[56:35] eternal was decreed before the
[56:37] foundation of the world. He said, "Watch
[56:39] carefully now and see this. Before there
[56:41] ever was ever a speck of stardust,
[56:44] before God was God, which is God is an
[56:46] object of adoration, and no one was
[56:49] there to worship him. So he was at that
[56:51] time only potentially God. And he was
[56:54] known only as eternal spirit. The bride.
[56:57] Amen. Let's say the bride.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; The bride was already in his mind. Yes,
[57:02] she was. She was existing in his
[57:04] thoughts. And what about those thoughts
[57:06] of God? They are eternal. Are they not?
[57:09] Amen. So we can say with assurance that
[57:12] we are children of the day that we are
[57:15] not children of the night.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a plan. God had a purpose.
[57:20] God had you on his mind. He put your
[57:22] name in the lamb's book of life before
[57:24] the foundation of the world. He took a
[57:26] picture of you in and put it in the file
[57:28] of predestination only for it to be
[57:31] fulfilled when we move to the marriage
[57:33] supper of the lamb. God is doing it all.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we wonder why am I going
[57:40] through what I'm going through and ra we
[57:42] should rather look at it. Lord I'm here
[57:43] to walk with you faithfully day by day,
[57:46] hour by hour, minute by minute, moment
[57:49] by moment. I'm here to fulfill the
[57:52] purpose that you have for me in life.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God wants us to fulfill
[57:57] his word. He allows Satan to come after
[58:00] us. And that's what's that's that's
[58:02] Satan's job is try to disrupt things,
[58:04] but God won't let him to go any further.
[58:07] Amen. But make a way of escape for you.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm very thankful for God's
[58:12] program. when you when you realize you
[58:14] watch your children or you watch things
[58:16] transpire and you can sit back and see
[58:19] the handywork of almighty God. I I want
[58:22] to say church, we are a very blessed
[58:24] people in the hour that we're living in
[58:26] today.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Other generations did not have the
[58:30] revelation that you have.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are privileged.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; I'd like to draw our attention to now
[58:37] just for a moment of time to Genesis
[58:40] 1:es 3 and 4. And we know it so well,
[58:43] many of us. And God said, "Let there be
[58:45] light." And there was light. And God saw
[58:48] the light that it was good and divided
[58:50] the light from the darkness. From the
[58:53] very beginning, God's word has always
[58:55] done one thing consistently. It
[58:57] separated.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; It separates and it draws a line of
[59:01] distinction. God divided the light from
[59:04] darkness. You read through Genesis
[59:07] chapter 1 and it said, "Let there be a
[59:08] firmament in the midst of the water. Let
[59:10] it divide the waters from waters. God is
[59:13] moving things always into a certain
[59:16] position.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. God divides truth from error.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there is only one truth.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; But there is many errors. There's many
[59:26] blurred lines and thoughts of confusion
[59:28] that blur people's minds. Amen. God, he
[59:31] he divides right from wrong.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; There's still what is right. And what
[59:36] was right 20 years ago, 50 years ago,
[59:38] was still what was right for today.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we continue to go further on,
[59:44] everything starts to seemingly get
[59:45] watered down. But I want to encourage
[59:47] you, not for the bride of Jesus Christ.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; I probably have said this here many
[59:51] times, but we we are not under legalism
[59:54] in this hour. We are under the amazing
[59:56] grace of almighty God.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And his grace is what keeps us
[1:00:01] from doing things that that's outside of
[1:00:03] his divine will. Amen. The Ephesian
[1:00:06] church age, they strayed from the truth
[1:00:08] by the fourth generation. But the bride
[1:00:11] of Christ will not, let's say, will not.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Will not stray from the truth. But she
[1:00:16] will stand very steadfast in the hour.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it is the hour of light
[1:00:22] and it's the hour of illumination. It's
[1:00:24] time, Amen, that we put on the full
[1:00:27] armor of God. It's time that we put have
[1:00:29] the full revelation of the word of God.
[1:00:32] Amen. And not compromise. Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not a compromiser.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; He He What is right is still right and
[1:00:40] what was wrong is still wrong.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hope this okay tonight.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Righteousness is still
[1:00:46] righteousness and unrighteousness still
[1:00:48] unrighteousness. It doesn't matter how
[1:00:50] you package it. It doesn't matter what
[1:00:52] label of the message you put on it.
[1:00:54] Unrighteousness is still unrighteous.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; God has never changed his mind. What
[1:00:59] Brother Brandham taught in the 50s and
[1:01:01] the 60s, Amen. is still good for me
[1:01:04] today. It is still good for us today.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He separates the bride from the
[1:01:09] world.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are a separated people.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; He separates life and death. When you
[1:01:16] look in scripture, he separated the
[1:01:17] wheat from the tears.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He let them grow together and and
[1:01:21] we know this. We know the revelation
[1:01:23] behind it. But there came a time when
[1:01:26] the combine is doing the separating.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is the angels of heaven.
[1:01:31] Amen. He separated the five wives and
[1:01:33] the five foolish virgins.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He separated Abraham and Lot.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham was one that had
[1:01:41] revelation. He saw he saw three people
[1:01:44] but it was Lord.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Lot saw two people and it was Lords.
[1:01:49] Amen. There was a separation. And when
[1:01:52] he separated him, that's when the
[1:01:53] promise came. When we separate oursel
[1:01:55] from all unbelief, that's when the pro
[1:01:57] that's when that's when the promise
[1:01:59] comes. He separated church spiritual
[1:02:01] from church carnal.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We could talk of many, many
[1:02:05] things. God's separating.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not a mixer.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a separator. Brother Brandham
[1:02:12] in the door in the door. He said there
[1:02:14] is a segregation. The bride of Christ is
[1:02:16] segregated from the rest of the
[1:02:18] churches. That's exactly right. Church
[1:02:20] natural and the church spiritual. Church
[1:02:23] carnal and the church of the world. It
[1:02:25] always has been. Jesus came to his own
[1:02:27] and his own received and not. But I like
[1:02:29] the next few words. But as many, let's
[1:02:32] say many tonight.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; As many as received him, what did he
[1:02:36] gave them? He gave them eternal life.
[1:02:39] And there's only one way you can receive
[1:02:41] him. That is if you are predestinated
[1:02:43] son and daughter of the living God
[1:02:46] without your name on the lamb's book of
[1:02:48] life. The Bible says you will be
[1:02:50] deceived in this hour. But if your name
[1:02:52] is on the lamb's book of life, amen, you
[1:02:55] can't even help it. You are just born
[1:02:57] for one purpose and that is to serve
[1:03:00] Almighty God.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; I think we can have a shout in the house
[1:03:04] tonight. Amen. God is in control of your
[1:03:07] life. Amen. He's in control.
[1:03:11] He's cutting away all carnality from us.
[1:03:14] He's taken away all unbelief from us.
[1:03:16] He's taken away all doubt from us. And
[1:03:19] it doesn't matter what the devil traps
[1:03:21] the devil has laid for us. God is in
[1:03:23] control of our life. Amen. The word
[1:03:26] which is Christ, it cuts between truth
[1:03:28] and error. Amen. It it takes away. It
[1:03:32] looks at faith and fear. It looks at
[1:03:34] light and darkness. And it it looks at a
[1:03:36] believer, make believer and unbeliever,
[1:03:38] but it it separates them. Amen. Truth is
[1:03:41] always, as brother Brandon would use the
[1:03:43] word an oddball that's threaded to the
[1:03:45] word.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's something that tightens down
[1:03:49] tight. He said it's to draw out the
[1:03:51] bride from the world. Set it aside for
[1:03:53] something different. Yes, friends, we
[1:03:55] may be a nut to the things of the world,
[1:03:57] the people of the world, but we are only
[1:04:00] drawing out that which is threaded for
[1:04:02] this.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're threaded to the things
[1:04:05] of God, blessed are your eyes that can
[1:04:08] see and your ears that can hear.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can say that with assurance.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; But Genesis chapter 1, it was not just
[1:04:16] the beginning of creation, but it was
[1:04:18] the beginning of God's pattern of
[1:04:20] separation. I just want to look at that
[1:04:22] for a few moments of time. if you'll
[1:04:24] bear with me today.
[1:04:26] And God saw the light that it was good.
[1:04:28] And God divided the light from the
[1:04:30] darkness. It was the first time that God
[1:04:32] said that it was good.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; He separated light from darkness.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before light could exist, life
[1:04:40] could exist on the earth, light had to
[1:04:43] appear because light reveals.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you walk in in and I've been in
[1:04:48] a cave one time in my life, and I have
[1:04:50] to be honest with you, I'm glad I I
[1:04:52] don't have a desire to to look into
[1:04:55] caves and and to
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; explore caves. That's not my calling in
[1:05:00] life. I'm I'm really happy. I I've told
[1:05:03] Sister Mara, I'm glad I live in this
[1:05:05] generation where you can have lots of
[1:05:07] light bulbs and flick a switch and turn
[1:05:09] on the lights.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; I don't like dark at all. I remember
[1:05:13] sitting in the in standing in those
[1:05:15] caves because with when darkness you
[1:05:18] can't see nothing. You can't even see
[1:05:20] your hand in front of you.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; One little strike of a match and you can
[1:05:23] see the whole cave illuminated. And and
[1:05:26] I like that message brother Brandham
[1:05:28] said there's someone that can turn on
[1:05:29] the light.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know there's only one person
[1:05:33] that can do that and that's our Lord
[1:05:34] Jesus Christ. Amen. But it takes light
[1:05:37] to reveal.
[1:05:39] It takes light to bring order out of
[1:05:42] chaos.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; It takes light to drive out all
[1:05:45] darkness.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Light is the atmosphere where God
[1:05:49] works within.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; He only works within light. It takes
[1:05:53] light to ripen fruit on the vine. And we
[1:05:56] can say in this hour that we're living
[1:05:58] in an age of maturity.
[1:06:01] Amen. God is not coming for a a
[1:06:04] girlfriend that's a just a young bride.
[1:06:08] Somebody asks, "How how old was I when I
[1:06:11] married Sister Mara?" We we'll leave
[1:06:13] that till after the service.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; But God God knows all things. He's not
[1:06:19] coming for someone that's immature.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; And the only way we could have maturity,
[1:06:24] and I just want to drop this in here at
[1:06:26] this point. The only way we can have
[1:06:27] maturity in this hour is through the
[1:06:29] revelation of the word of God for today.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; It's not the first poll that I'm
[1:06:34] interested in, although I thank God for
[1:06:36] it. second poll, but I'm interested in
[1:06:38] the third pull of of the message of the
[1:06:40] hour.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which brings into light full
[1:06:44] revelation
[1:06:45] that we have need of in order to have a
[1:06:47] body change. There's no other generation
[1:06:50] of time that has the privilege that you
[1:06:52] have and that I have in this hour except
[1:06:55] for ourselves because God has brought us
[1:06:58] the third pole or he's brought us the
[1:07:00] opening of the word. We no longer have a
[1:07:02] closed word, but we have an open word.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what does an open word do? It
[1:07:07] brings light. What does light do? It
[1:07:10] reveals. It reveals every shortcoming in
[1:07:12] our life. It reveals everything that's
[1:07:14] not according to the word of God in our
[1:07:16] life. Amen. It's God's word that does it
[1:07:20] through the anointed ministry of the
[1:07:22] hour. Amen. God did not let the light
[1:07:25] and darkness blend together. No, he
[1:07:29] divided them. This shows that God never
[1:07:32] mixes truth and error. He never mixes
[1:07:35] righteousness or unrighteousness. The
[1:07:37] world is looking for mixers.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; People that want to mix everything into
[1:07:42] it. And I sometimes wonder sometimes
[1:07:44] even in our own ranks if there's not too
[1:07:46] many mixers
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; wanting to bring in all kinds of things
[1:07:50] because the power of God doesn't move
[1:07:52] anymore. But I I still believe in the
[1:07:54] oldfashioned power of God. I still
[1:07:57] believe in the Holy Spirit moving. I
[1:07:59] still believe that the Holy Spirit can
[1:08:02] change lives. that can take care of
[1:08:04] addictions, that can take care of of
[1:08:06] things in your life. It doesn't matter
[1:08:08] what it is. Some people think, well,
[1:08:10] maybe we need something else in order to
[1:08:12] help our young people. I'll tell you
[1:08:14] what, our young people need, our
[1:08:15] middle-ag, our old people, we all need
[1:08:17] the same. We just need more of God,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; and we need the Holy Ghost in our life
[1:08:22] in the soul realm, and it'll take care
[1:08:24] of everything.
[1:08:26] The reason why they have to have
[1:08:27] programs in this hour is because there's
[1:08:30] no longer the moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:33] and conviction of the of the thing from
[1:08:35] the things that are wrong.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; It's because we've allowed mixing to
[1:08:39] come in instead of the pure word of God.
[1:08:42] But I want to declare today is that we
[1:08:44] believe in the true word of God. And the
[1:08:47] word of God is what takes care of every
[1:08:49] issue of every person at any time,
[1:08:52] anywhere, under any circumstance. Amen.
[1:08:55] It's God's word that does it. I say in
[1:08:58] this hour, let the flashlight of the
[1:09:00] word come on a person's life one moment.
[1:09:02] It'll change that person and their whole
[1:09:05] desires that they have.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why the best the best
[1:09:13] marriage counseling is coming to service
[1:09:15] and hearing the word.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me tonight.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. People want to have somebody sit
[1:09:21] down and counsel and counsel. I'll tell
[1:09:23] you what we need is we need more of God
[1:09:25] in our lives to get rid of our stubborn
[1:09:27] spirits and our and our difficult times
[1:09:30] that we have and put Christ back on the
[1:09:33] driver's seat again till you have love
[1:09:35] for one another. Amen. Is this okay
[1:09:38] tonight? I hope this okay. Amen. We need
[1:09:41] that in our lives. We don't need mixing
[1:09:43] in our lives. What we need is the word
[1:09:45] of God preaching the power and the
[1:09:47] demonstration that changes lives.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; It's not a time for mixing. I I every I'
[1:09:57] I've read the Ephesian church age book o
[1:10:00] over and over again and I every time I
[1:10:02] come to the one spot in it, the first
[1:10:03] generation had the power of God. Second
[1:10:06] generation it dwindles. The third
[1:10:08] generation it dwindles. in the fourth
[1:10:10] generation. No vestage of light even
[1:10:12] compared to the first at all. I look at
[1:10:15] and say that's not going to be me.
[1:10:18] That's not going to be the church. And
[1:10:20] Amen. That's not going to be what what
[1:10:22] God's going to say about me. We're going
[1:10:24] to stand true to the word of God. Amen.
[1:10:27] And our children are going to hear the
[1:10:29] truth of the word of God. Not a watered
[1:10:31] down message, BUT THE TRUE MESSAGE of
[1:10:33] the hour that changes people's lives.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for mixers. God is
[1:10:43] looking for separation from the things
[1:10:44] of the world.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we would be holy unto God.
[1:10:49] That's why the Bible is very clear in 2
[1:10:51] Corinthians says, "Wherefore come out
[1:10:53] from among them, and be you separate,
[1:10:54] sayeth the Lord, and touch not the
[1:10:56] unclean thing, and I will receive you.
[1:10:58] I'll be a father unto you. You shall be
[1:11:00] my sons and daughters, saith the Lord."
[1:11:02] Amen.
[1:11:04] God wants us to separate from all of our
[1:11:07] unbelief. Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of times people have in
[1:11:10] their mind that separate from this
[1:11:12] person, that person. I look at if
[1:11:13] somebody wants to pull me into the
[1:11:15] world, I don't want to have any
[1:11:16] fellowship with that.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you. Amen. If they
[1:11:20] they just want to say, "Well, it doesn't
[1:11:22] matter this way or that way." I say,
[1:11:23] "Yeah, it matters. God God's word
[1:11:25] matters."
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it was one word off in the
[1:11:28] beginning, then then Satan's going to
[1:11:30] look for a place to bring one word off
[1:11:32] in the end time. Amen. But the bride
[1:11:35] can't fail. And I I I'm so thankful for
[1:11:37] that. That's why I say in the beginning,
[1:11:39] God is in control because the bride of
[1:11:41] Jesus Christ cannot fail.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's going to stand.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what the devil
[1:11:51] throws at us, there is going to be a
[1:11:54] bride. We believe we're part of that
[1:11:55] bride. And I and I believe that that we
[1:11:58] we're gonna walk off of the face of this
[1:12:01] earth one day. Amen. And there's no
[1:12:03] devil in hell going to stop it.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's doing what he's doing. But
[1:12:08] I'll tell you what, God is doing what
[1:12:10] he's doing. And God is preparing. Amen.
[1:12:13] Satan is preparing for tribulation
[1:12:15] period, but we're preparing for a
[1:12:17] rapture.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say that if you got anything
[1:12:22] in your heart at all, I don't know most
[1:12:23] of the people anymore, but if you got
[1:12:25] anything in your heart at all that's not
[1:12:26] in tune with the word of God, I
[1:12:28] recommend you before this service is out
[1:12:30] today. Let God take it out of your life.
[1:12:34] Amen. Don't go another day with it in
[1:12:36] your heart. Say, "Lord, I'm here
[1:12:38] tonight. Take whatever I need to take
[1:12:40] out of me. TAKE MY NATURE. LET DIE TO
[1:12:44] MYSELF AND LET CHRIST REIGN IN MYSELF."
[1:12:46] AMEN. LET JESUS be the Lord of all in my
[1:12:49] life. AMEN. MAY MY LIFE BE A WITNESS AND
[1:12:52] A LIGHT TO THOSE THAT CANNOT that do not
[1:12:55] that I would reflect Jesus Christ in
[1:12:57] this hour we're living in. Amen. It's
[1:12:59] not a time, amen, to pushing it off and
[1:13:03] PUSH IT OFF. I SAY IF YOU GOT SOMETHING,
[1:13:05] DEAL WITH IT. AMEN. Let the HOLY GHOST
[1:13:08] TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AMEN. SAY,
[1:13:10] LORD, HERE I AM TODAY. I'm I'm HERE TO
[1:13:13] TO LAY DOWN EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT OF
[1:13:15] YOURS. AMEN. I may not know you, but he
[1:13:18] knows what's in your life. AND HE KNOWS
[1:13:20] YOUR THOUGHTS IN HEAVEN. SPEAK LOUDER IN
[1:13:23] HEAVEN than what your words do on this
[1:13:24] earth. AMEN. SO I SAY, CHURCH, DO WHAT'S
[1:13:27] RIGHT IN THE hour we're living in.
[1:13:29] Commit your heart to the Lord. Don't let
[1:13:31] it go another day.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel very impressed upon my
[1:13:36] heart. Amen. GOD WANTS US TO separate
[1:13:39] from the things of the world. Amen.
[1:13:41] Separate from our carnal nature.
[1:13:43] separate from just being a lukewarm
[1:13:45] church man or BE SOMEBODY THAT'S ON FIRE
[1:13:48] WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. LET THE FIRE
[1:13:50] FALL IS MY PRAYER. AMEN. STIR EVERY
[1:13:53] HEART AND EVERY PERSON. AMEN. UNDER THE
[1:13:56] UNCCTION OF THE WORD OF GOD TODAY. AMEN.
[1:13:59] We're not mixers in this hour, but we
[1:14:01] are CHILDREN OF THE LIGHT AND THE WORD
[1:14:03] OF GOD IS WHAT'S BURN SHOULD BE BURNING
[1:14:06] IN EVERY ONE OF OUR HEARTS.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:11] It's all
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need Christ. We need Brother
[1:14:15] Brandon the thinking man's filter. He
[1:14:16] said God has a filter. That's his word
[1:14:18] and it's a separator for it's a water a
[1:14:21] separation from sin. Amen. He said
[1:14:23] that's the thinking man or the holy
[1:14:25] man's taste. Amen. That's what we need
[1:14:27] in our life. We need that holy man's
[1:14:29] taste in our life. Those messages speak
[1:14:33] largely in the hour that we're living in
[1:14:34] today.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God commanded the light to shine
[1:14:38] out of darkness and has shined in our
[1:14:40] hearts to give the light of the
[1:14:42] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:14:44] face of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's God.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And he's all light.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Light in the scripture represents truth.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; We know the truth shall make you free.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Light in the scripture means vindicated
[1:15:01] word or manifested word. Our lives
[1:15:04] become the living word of God.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Light in scripture is revelation
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; or it's an unveiling.
[1:15:13] Amen. You can you can take a car and and
[1:15:16] I like cars and you can have a car
[1:15:19] something that somebody made from some
[1:15:21] whatever company and they want to make
[1:15:23] it kind of a display to the world and
[1:15:26] they'll put it underneath a veil or
[1:15:28] underneath a covering and you know that
[1:15:30] it's a car and you know something might
[1:15:32] know something about it but you don't
[1:15:34] know the color, you don't know the
[1:15:35] style, you don't know the engine, you
[1:15:37] don't know any of those parts about it.
[1:15:39] But when they pull the cover off of it
[1:15:41] then it reveals what is there. Amen. And
[1:15:44] God has revealed what we need for this
[1:15:46] hour.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's no longer in darkness.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we look at Cain and Abel and
[1:15:53] maybe get ahead of myself here, but if
[1:15:54] we look at Cain and Abel, Abel offered
[1:15:57] by by revelation, which was light.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; God received his offering. Ca Cain
[1:16:03] offered by the workings of his own hand
[1:16:05] and God refused his offering. But the
[1:16:09] beautiful thing is is that God allowed
[1:16:11] Cain re room to repent
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; and to offer the same sacrifice. It was
[1:16:16] Cain's decision not to repent.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And offer the same sacrifice. When
[1:16:21] when brother Brandham was in Chicago at
[1:16:23] the ministerial association and when he
[1:16:26] was there that with all the ministers
[1:16:28] and they were going to try to trap him
[1:16:30] in his words and he stood up in the
[1:16:32] front of the people and and he said
[1:16:34] talked about water baptism. Show me in
[1:16:36] your Bibles where it's wrong and
[1:16:38] different doctrinal truths. Amen. Of the
[1:16:41] day. And many came to him and said that
[1:16:43] they were going to get rebaptized. They
[1:16:44] said, "We know it's the truth." But not
[1:16:47] one of them ever came. Amen. They had re
[1:16:50] room to repent, but they never repented
[1:16:52] of of their false doctrines. Amen.
[1:16:55] That's not so with the bride.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherever you come from, God has
[1:17:00] pulled you out. Amen. But he's here to
[1:17:02] put you into his word. Amen. And the
[1:17:05] word does not conform to us. We conform
[1:17:08] to the word of God in this hour. Amen.
[1:17:11] It transforms your life into a living
[1:17:13] image of Jesus Christ. Amen. Living upon
[1:17:16] the earth. Somebody say, "Praise the
[1:17:18] Lord."
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Darkness represents human
[1:17:21] reasoning and it represents confusion
[1:17:24] and deception.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Darkness is all about reasoning.
[1:17:29] Amen. The same sun, that same rain that
[1:17:31] matures and ripens the grain also ripens
[1:17:34] the tears. Amen. The tears are being
[1:17:37] gathered. Amen. We could speak on that
[1:17:39] for the for the rest of the weekend. How
[1:17:42] the tears are being gathered together.
[1:17:43] We see what's happening in Christianom
[1:17:46] as known as the carnal Christianom of
[1:17:48] the world. They're gathering.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they're gathering to to their
[1:17:53] ideologies. And they're gathering to
[1:17:55] man-made confusion. And they're
[1:17:57] gathering to a trinity doctrine. and
[1:17:59] they're gathering to all of that. But
[1:18:01] the bride of Jesus Christ, praise the
[1:18:03] name of the Lord, she is gathering to
[1:18:05] the word in this hour. Amen. And she is
[1:18:08] not going to come up short. SHE'S GOING
[1:18:10] TO COME UP 100% ON THE MARK. AMEN.
[1:18:14] BECAUSE GOD IS THE ONE WATCHING OVER HIS
[1:18:16] OWN SEED. AMEN. HE DID NOT ENTRUST IT TO
[1:18:19] A MAN. AMEN. HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO
[1:18:22] STAND IN THE midst of the seven golden
[1:18:24] CANDLE STANDS. IT'S GOD WHO'S IN CONTROL
[1:18:27] OF IT ALL. AMEN. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A
[1:18:30] MAN. THIS IS ABOUT JESUS CHRIST IN THIS
[1:18:32] HOUR. AMEN. JESUS MANIFESTED AMONGST THE
[1:18:36] PEOPLE.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO'S PREACHING IT.
[1:18:40] IT'S ABOUT CHRIST BEING MADE REAL IN
[1:18:42] FRONT OF THE PEOPLE.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; It's all about Jesus.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; He's the one in control.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the light of the world. The
[1:18:52] rest is in darkness. in in the message
[1:18:55] in the message God turn on the light.
[1:18:57] Brother Brandham was speaks in here and
[1:18:59] he said the Jews thought they were
[1:19:01] worshiping in true light.
[1:19:03] Amen. But they thought they were
[1:19:05] worshiping the ve the same God that they
[1:19:07] were turning down the very one they
[1:19:09] thought they were worshiping. They were
[1:19:11] crucifying. They were making fun of the
[1:19:13] very God and making him a laughingstock
[1:19:15] of the people. The very God they thought
[1:19:17] they were worshiping. I I listened to a
[1:19:20] little clip of of a charismatic minister
[1:19:23] and and just recently they were talking
[1:19:25] about William Brham and they were
[1:19:28] talking about how in discernment it hit
[1:19:30] every time. It was perfect every time.
[1:19:32] But they said, "But when it came to the
[1:19:34] word, how far he was off." I listened to
[1:19:37] that and I thought, "My, you're so blind
[1:19:39] and you're leading the blind and you're
[1:19:41] you're all blinded to the things of
[1:19:43] life." And I just thought of it, how
[1:19:46] could it be true that God would hit
[1:19:48] every time and every prophecy was 100%
[1:19:51] and the be off on the word. That was
[1:19:53] only that catch the attention of the
[1:19:55] real believer. Amen. And the real
[1:19:57] believer saw that and said, "That's only
[1:19:59] God can do that." Amen. And you saw it
[1:20:01] and you SAW THE LIGHT AND SOMETHING
[1:20:03] QUICKENED IN YOUR HEART AND THAT SEEING
[1:20:06] OF GOD THAT WAS PREDESTINATED IN YOUR
[1:20:09] LIFE CAME ALIVE. AMEN. AND YOU CHANGED
[1:20:11] YOUR VERY DIRECTION OF LIFE.
[1:20:14] AMEN. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:20:17] AMEN. GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING
[1:20:19] THAT'S TRANSPIRING.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We are PREPARED FOR THIS TIME, AND
[1:20:26] we're prepared for this hour. AMEN. IT'S
[1:20:28] NOT MY PREPARING, BUT IT'S GOD THAT HAS
[1:20:30] PREPARED IT, AND IT'S GOD THAT IS MAKING
[1:20:33] it come to pass.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandman continues down. He
[1:20:39] says, "But the hours at hand when the tr
[1:20:41] when the light is shining, the gospel
[1:20:43] light in his power of the resurrection
[1:20:45] of Jesus Christ manifesting himself that
[1:20:49] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:20:50] today and forever." Amen. He lauded that
[1:20:53] for this day. The things that he
[1:20:56] promised for this day must happen in
[1:20:59] this day.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; So we have a portion of the word they
[1:21:02] never had in other generations. And and
[1:21:05] they wish they would have saw what you
[1:21:07] can see. Amen. But the seals were close
[1:21:10] to them. The thunders were close to him.
[1:21:11] The mighty angel was close to him. The
[1:21:13] book of Revelation was closed to him.
[1:21:16] Amen. But you COULD SAY IN THIS HOUR
[1:21:18] THAT THE SEALS have been open in THIS
[1:21:19] HOUR. THE THUNDERS HAVE COME FORTH IN
[1:21:22] THIS HOUR. THE MIGHTY ANGEL CAME DOWN IN
[1:21:24] THIS HOUR. AMEN. AND GOD HAS OPENED HIS
[1:21:27] WORD. AMEN. TO THE BRIDE OF CHRIST.
[1:21:29] AMEN. NOT FOR ARGUMENT PURPOSES, BUT
[1:21:32] THAT OUR LIFE WOULD BECOME THE MERE
[1:21:34] IMAGE OF THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE WE ARE
[1:21:36] BONE OF HIS BONE AND FLESH OF HIS FLESH
[1:21:39] AND AND SPIRIT OF HIS SPIRIT AND WORD OF
[1:21:42] HIS WORD. AMEN. When you SEE THE BRIDE,
[1:21:44] YOU SEE A REFLECTION OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:21:47] AMEN. WHAT IS CHRIST LOOKING FOR? HE'S
[1:21:49] LOOKING FOR A BRIDE THAT REFLECTS HIS
[1:21:52] VERY IMAGE.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RIGHT?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; The things that happen must that he
[1:21:57] promised for this day must happen in
[1:21:59] this day. If the church won't accept it,
[1:22:02] God is able of these stones to rise up
[1:22:03] children onto Abraham. He'll get his
[1:22:06] message over because he's always done it
[1:22:09] and he always will do it.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he goes further down. He said,
[1:22:14] "But they're traditions that separated
[1:22:16] them from the real light of the word."
[1:22:20] Amen. I would say I wouldn't want that
[1:22:21] to be on my resume. Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Traditions separating me from the word.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Traditions that we bring in with
[1:22:30] us that we have to lay down.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just refer to a couple
[1:22:36] scriptures. Psalms 119. The word is a
[1:22:38] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[1:22:40] path. The word is going to lead you. In
[1:22:43] St. John 8:12, I am the light of the
[1:22:46] world. He that followeth, he shall not
[1:22:48] walk in darkness, but he shall have
[1:22:50] light of life. In Ephesians 1, the eyes
[1:22:54] of your understanding being enlightened.
[1:22:56] In 1 John 1:5, I love this. Then this is
[1:22:59] the message we have heard of him and
[1:23:01] declare unto you that God is light and
[1:23:04] in him is no darkness at all.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; There's no darkness in God.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; There's no obscurity.
[1:23:11] God didn't do do things in a back room.
[1:23:14] He does everything very visible before
[1:23:16] the people.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That no person can say we didn't
[1:23:19] know. They all know.
[1:23:22] Amen. But it's a choice.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Their choice was to reject it and your
[1:23:27] choice was to receive it.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; From Genesis Revelations, God separates
[1:23:34] his own from the world. When we look at
[1:23:37] Noah, we can see that Noah was separated
[1:23:39] from a world that was under eminent
[1:23:41] judgment.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; He's building an ark.
[1:23:47] I often think on year 90, year 110,
[1:23:52] year 118, he's preaching the same
[1:23:54] message.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; It's going to rain. They say, "No, come
[1:23:58] on. It's not going to rain. It's going
[1:24:00] to rain." And when he was when he was
[1:24:03] building his ark, he only built it for
[1:24:06] eight beds.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; There was an extra room on it. And the
[1:24:09] merry supper of the lamb has got exactly
[1:24:11] the right amount of chairs by
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I always like to have a little
[1:24:16] plaque card when I sit down. I know
[1:24:18] where I'm supposed to sit because I'm
[1:24:19] looking forward and when I get to
[1:24:20] heaven, I'm going to look for my plaque
[1:24:22] card.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Sister Mara, this is where we're
[1:24:24] sitting. Where are you sitting? We're
[1:24:27] sitting close to the bre brothers and
[1:24:29] sisters from Virginia, from Elkton.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; We're sitting together in marriage
[1:24:33] supper of the lamb. We're
[1:24:34] fellowshipping.
[1:24:36] [applause] The same light that changed
[1:24:38] us is the same light that changes us
[1:24:39] all.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a glorious time.
[1:24:46] Abraham was called out from his country.
[1:24:49] He was separated.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Him and Lot were separated. Israel was
[1:24:52] separated from Egypt.
[1:24:55] And the Bible says in Exodus 11:7, "That
[1:24:57] you may know that the Lord doth put a
[1:24:59] difference between the Egyptians and
[1:25:01] Israel."
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; You put your name there.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; He puts a difference between church
[1:25:07] spiritual and church carnal.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; It's God that does that. The church, the
[1:25:12] bride is separated from the world.
[1:25:14] There's a distinction
[1:25:16] to the world and to the charismatic
[1:25:18] world and to the denominational world.
[1:25:20] We're we're strange people, but we are
[1:25:24] pilgrims and strangers.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just coming through life.
[1:25:28] That's why the Bible says come out from
[1:25:30] among her. And I'm so thankful that I
[1:25:32] was able by the grace of God to come out
[1:25:34] from amongst
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; the world as it were, the cosmos.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. and come into the revealed word of
[1:25:40] this hour.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. In in the Samarian church age, he
[1:25:44] says he says God had ordained that his
[1:25:46] people act different from the world.
[1:25:48] They are not of the world and they don't
[1:25:50] look like the world and they don't act
[1:25:53] like the world. They are crucified unto
[1:25:54] the world and the world is crucified
[1:25:56] unto them. He says, you see, one
[1:25:59] difference between Israel and the rest
[1:26:00] of the nations was God. Put God to one
[1:26:03] side and Israel was like any other
[1:26:06] nation.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God is brought out of the
[1:26:09] equation, then we are no different than
[1:26:11] any other people.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I had my one of my uncles who was
[1:26:16] in a in a Pentecostal church in and for
[1:26:19] most of his life in in different
[1:26:20] different churches. He told me one time,
[1:26:23] Brother Robin was actually speaking. He
[1:26:24] came one Friday night. He's my dad's
[1:26:26] older brother. And he told me, he said,
[1:26:28] ' Kelly, he said, 'I want to tell you,
[1:26:30] he said, 'The spirit of God used to move
[1:26:32] in our church, but now it's only
[1:26:34] programs,
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; and it's people putting together things
[1:26:38] in order to create hype in the church.
[1:26:40] Amen. The word of God doesn't need help.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; The word of God is the word of God.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't stir your heart, then I
[1:26:47] would look at your revelation because it
[1:26:49] should stir up your heart.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's your life.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It becomes your everything. And I
[1:26:56] said, "God forbid that would ever
[1:26:58] happen." But then you hear all of the
[1:26:59] programming that we're doing is some of
[1:27:01] the people are doing and I'm thinking,
[1:27:02] my I don't want the world in the church.
[1:27:04] We need to push the world out of the
[1:27:06] church.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we don't need programs.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need something to whip
[1:27:11] the people up into into emotional
[1:27:14] atmosphere. What we need is the Holy
[1:27:16] Ghost. Let the Holy Ghost take control
[1:27:18] of it. Amen. He'll He'll get you dancing
[1:27:21] when you're supposed to dance and he'll
[1:27:22] get you shouting when you're supposed to
[1:27:24] shout. Amen. and he'll get you crying
[1:27:26] when you're supposed to cry. Amen. It's
[1:27:28] God that does that.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart.
[1:27:32] And I and I believe you can't put God on
[1:27:34] a box and say, "God, you can only move
[1:27:36] this little bit right over here because
[1:27:38] otherwise you're going to move outside
[1:27:40] of our tradition." I say, "Let God be
[1:27:42] God. Let God move like God wants to
[1:27:44] move." Amen. And let ourselves get out
[1:27:46] of the way that God can take full
[1:27:48] control. AMEN. BECAUSE LIGHT HAS COME IN
[1:27:51] THIS HOUR AND LIGHT HAS SHONE IN OUR
[1:27:53] HEARTS IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. AND THE WORD
[1:27:56] IN IS IMPRESSED UPON OUR LIVES and our
[1:27:58] hearts.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a dead letter. IT'S A LIVING
[1:28:02] REALITY.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE WORD IS CHRIST BEING REVEALED
[1:28:06] AMONGST THE PEOPLE OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:28:08] AMEN. THAT THEY COULD REFLECT THE same
[1:28:10] imagery as what he is.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; I say thank God in this hour for light
[1:28:15] in this hour.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need light in the hour that
[1:28:19] we're living. It doesn't matter if you
[1:28:21] call yourself a Christian. Anybody can
[1:28:23] do that. That's brother Brandham. The
[1:28:25] point is whether or not you have the
[1:28:27] spirit of God in you. For without that
[1:28:29] spirit, you are reprobate and you're
[1:28:31] none of his. AND THAT'S A STARK REALITY
[1:28:34] OF A OF A QUOTATION THAT he would leave
[1:28:37] for us. Amen. But I don't put myself in
[1:28:39] the place of a repbate. I put myself in
[1:28:41] as an eagle in this hour. SPIRITFILLED,
[1:28:44] SPIRIT LIVED, SON AND DAUGHTER,
[1:28:46] DAUGHTER, SON OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN.
[1:28:49] I'M ONE WITH HIM. HE'S ONE WITH ME. WE
[1:28:52] BECOME ONE IN THE HOUR that we're living
[1:28:53] in. Amen. When we and brother Brown
[1:28:55] said, WHEN WE RECOGNIZE WHAT THE RAPTURE
[1:28:57] IS, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE RAPTURE. I
[1:29:00] SAY, LORD, GET RID OF EVERYTHING THAT'S
[1:29:02] NOT OF YOU IN MY LIFE. AMEN. IN THE
[1:29:04] PEOPLE'S LIFE AND ALLOW CHRIST TO BE
[1:29:06] PREEMINENT AMONGST US ONE more time.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. LET THE LORD MOVE IN ANY WAY HE
[1:29:12] wants to move. Amen. Let he let him JUST
[1:29:16] COME OVER THE PEOPLE. I feel like
[1:29:17] speaking in tongues right now. AMEN. LET
[1:29:19] HIM MOVE UP THAT LIKE IN A WAY HE'S
[1:29:22] NEVER MOVED BEFORE.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And there's only one way that can happen
[1:29:26] IS WHEN WE GET RID OF EVERYTHING THAT'S
[1:29:28] NOT OF GOD. AMEN. PUT AWAY ALL THE
[1:29:31] THINGS OF THIS LIFE.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Have a conference with Almighty
[1:29:34] God.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be a called out church.
[1:29:39] I don't I don't want. Brother Brham
[1:29:41] says, "BUT THE PEOPLE WANTS MIXERS, BUT
[1:29:43] GOD CALLS her separators. Separate
[1:29:45] yourself from it. Yoke not up with
[1:29:47] unbelief." That's God's way of doing it.
[1:29:49] The world has a different conception.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And I say in this hour, it's the truth.
[1:29:54] They have a different conception, but we
[1:29:56] have a conception as well. And that
[1:29:58] conception is the word of God.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Kind of watching the time a little bit.
[1:30:04] I don't know when I even started.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got a lot on my fork. I'm
[1:30:09] just trying to see if I can bring it all
[1:30:11] to you.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; The world today is in a spiritual
[1:30:14] eclipse.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; When light is rejected, darkness takes
[1:30:18] over.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; There's no longer a moral compass
[1:30:22] amongst the people.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it is in America, but
[1:30:26] in Canada, there's no morality anymore.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; The world's gone completely insane.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Darkness is upon the people. They
[1:30:35] have ears that can hear and they have
[1:30:36] eyes that can naturally see, but they
[1:30:38] cannot see where they're going. Amen.
[1:30:41] Spiritually, they're brift. They're
[1:30:43] completely in in a state of chaos.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I knew knew of a couple that that
[1:30:49] were in in a some type of modern church.
[1:30:52] And I know the know the couple quite
[1:30:54] well and and shacked up together and
[1:30:57] going to church and praising Jesus. And
[1:31:00] I say like, how in the world can you
[1:31:01] have that in in the church of the living
[1:31:03] God? Amen. There's no moral compass.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; They're looking for something that makes
[1:31:08] you feel good.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; But the bride is looking for something
[1:31:11] that that will help her to do what's
[1:31:13] right according to the word.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's religious darkness upon
[1:31:18] the people. People professing light, but
[1:31:20] yet they're walking in darkness. False
[1:31:23] religion covers the true light through
[1:31:25] tradition, organization, and formality.
[1:31:28] And the results of that brings
[1:31:30] organization, programs, and psychology.
[1:31:33] Amen. Because when God is taken out of
[1:31:35] the picture, you have to resort to
[1:31:37] something else. And that something else
[1:31:39] is psychology, organization, and
[1:31:41] programs. But in the end time, in the
[1:31:44] end time, the same pattern, it repeats
[1:31:46] all the way through time. Organized
[1:31:48] religion rejects a revealed word and
[1:31:51] embraces ecumenical unity, which is a
[1:31:53] man-made light. And we see that
[1:31:56] happening in the hour that we're living
[1:31:57] in. Amen. Everybody wants to get along.
[1:32:00] And I say I get along with every person,
[1:32:02] but I there's one thing when it comes to
[1:32:04] the word of God, that's where I stand
[1:32:06] alone with the word.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the word or it's nothing.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; But religion is a darkness. That's like
[1:32:12] a satanic camouflage. You know, you're
[1:32:14] all in hunting season here. And I I come
[1:32:16] and disrupt maybe some of your hunting
[1:32:18] time. But but it's hunting season for
[1:32:20] you all. And you put on your camel, what
[1:32:22] are you trying to do? You're trying to
[1:32:23] disguise yourself. But Satan's also got
[1:32:26] his own camouflage. Amen. He's got
[1:32:28] people that say they love Jesus, but
[1:32:30] their life don't even match up to one
[1:32:32] part of the word of God. Amen. We we we
[1:32:36] don't want camouflaged Christians. We
[1:32:38] want Christians who are born again, sons
[1:32:40] and daughters of the living God. Amen.
[1:32:43] Nothing to hide. There's when you when
[1:32:45] you take a covering that hides truth
[1:32:46] under a cloak of good works and unity.
[1:32:49] Amen. Brother Bram said they'll outwork
[1:32:51] us any day. But the Bible tells us that
[1:32:53] you give all your money to feed the
[1:32:55] poor, give your body to be burned, do
[1:32:58] all those things. But if you don't have
[1:32:59] God in your heart and your life, it is
[1:33:01] absolutely not even accounted by
[1:33:04] almighty God. Amen. What is he looking
[1:33:06] for? He's looking for a people who walk
[1:33:09] according to the light of their day and
[1:33:11] their hour. Amen. I'm thankful for
[1:33:13] Wesley's day. I'm thankful for Luther's
[1:33:15] day. Amen. I'm thankful for 1906, Zuza
[1:33:19] Street day. Amen. All of them were one
[1:33:22] stepping stone closer to what we have in
[1:33:24] this hour. But I'm very thankful for the
[1:33:26] light of the word of God for the day
[1:33:28] that we're living in. Amen. We're not
[1:33:30] walking in darkness. Amen. We're
[1:33:32] baptized according to Christian baptism.
[1:33:34] Amen. We don't act like THE WORLD. WE
[1:33:36] DON'T LOOK LIKE THE WORLD. WE'RE A
[1:33:38] SEPARATED PEOPLE. AMEN. WE ARE NOT THE
[1:33:40] CHURCH CARNAL, BUT WE ARE THE THE CHURCH
[1:33:43] OF THE LIVING GOD. SPIRITUAL CHURCH OF
[1:33:45] THE LIVING GOD, WALKING IN STEP WITH THE
[1:33:48] KING of Kings.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. One day we're going to be sitting
[1:33:52] with him in his throne. And what a grand
[1:33:55] time that's going to be.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; And see does not air with the shock.
[1:34:02] Brother Bram says our modern
[1:34:04] denomination depend on education to some
[1:34:06] man-made theology to explain all things
[1:34:08] away. They accept it. They won't take
[1:34:11] the world that says Jesus Christ is the
[1:34:13] same yesterday, today, and forever. They
[1:34:15] won't take Malachi 4 and and won't take
[1:34:18] all of these other promises pertaining
[1:34:19] to this day and said how the churches
[1:34:22] how the prophet said it shall be light
[1:34:23] in the evening time. They don't take
[1:34:25] this. They want to hop around what some
[1:34:28] Pentecostal organization killed a 100
[1:34:30] years ago eating on half half rotten
[1:34:32] matter. That's right. That's no good.
[1:34:35] Notice church is so carnal feeds itself
[1:34:37] on a worldly carry and dead things of
[1:34:40] the world just like the vulture does.
[1:34:41] church politics. They don't let the Holy
[1:34:44] Ghost send a man to a church. They'll
[1:34:46] have to have a politics and see if the
[1:34:48] denomination going to receive him or
[1:34:49] not. It's getting that way everywhere,
[1:34:51] church. Amen. And brother Bram said, "Do
[1:34:54] you ever see an eagle compromise?" He
[1:34:56] said, "No, sir. There is no compromise
[1:34:58] in him. Neither does a genuine Let's
[1:35:00] say, I'm a genuine Christian."
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Say it. I'm a genuine Christian.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither does a genuine
[1:35:08] Christian. He ain't soft. He'll hunt
[1:35:09] till he finds it." Amen. Yes, sir. He'll
[1:35:12] find his meat. He wants fresh mana.
[1:35:14] He'll get down there and dig till he
[1:35:16] finds it. He'll fly higher and higher.
[1:35:19] If there's none in this valley, he'll
[1:35:20] just raise a little higher. And the
[1:35:22] higher you go, the more you can see. So,
[1:35:25] it's time for eagles of this day to get
[1:35:27] to flying higher. Dig into God's
[1:35:29] promise, not live on vulture food that's
[1:35:31] been killed years ago. Amen. And I say,
[1:35:34] WE DON'T WANT VULTURE FOOD. WE DON'T
[1:35:36] WANT THINGS FROM THE DAYS GONE BY. AMEN.
[1:35:38] WE CAN PREACH SANCTIFICATION ALL DAY
[1:35:40] LONG, BUT SANCTIFICATION MADE WAY FOR
[1:35:43] THE BAPTISM HIMSELF OF THE HOLY GHOST TO
[1:35:46] COME IN THE HEARTS AND LIVES OF the
[1:35:47] people. Amen. I say, LET THE LORD COME
[1:35:50] INTO EVERY life and every heart.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; true believer can't walk in darkness.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're still all together.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. light separates them
[1:36:09] automatically.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; The bride is not deceived by
[1:36:13] denominational reasoning
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; or worldly compromise.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; We know the Bible tells us there shall
[1:36:19] rise false Christs and false prophets
[1:36:21] and show great signs and wonders and so
[1:36:23] much it would deceive the very elect.
[1:36:26] But it is impossible.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; The very elect will not be deceived.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Cain represented the church without
[1:36:34] revelation.
[1:36:36] He worshiped. It was emotional. It was
[1:36:39] sincere. It was beautiful. But not
[1:36:40] according to the revealed word.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; God only will accept one thing. That's
[1:36:46] his own word.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; He built an altar. He offered sacrifices
[1:36:52] of his own hands. He bowed down in
[1:36:54] devotion. Yet re God rejected it because
[1:36:57] it lacked the revelation of the blood,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; the very life
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; for their day.
[1:37:06] Lady Yosia boasts of religious wealth
[1:37:09] and success. And I heard those guys
[1:37:11] boasting, these charismatic guys. Oh
[1:37:13] yeah, my plane is worth 38 million. And
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; I thought, yeah, your plane is worth 38
[1:37:17] million, but what's that going to do to
[1:37:19] get you in the rapture?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; It might get you from point A to point B
[1:37:23] on the earth, but it's not going to
[1:37:25] certainly get you into the rapture.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; It's the wrong kind of rocket fuel.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the wrong stuff. Amen.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have what it takes to get
[1:37:36] through all the barriers of life.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And go off into the eternities.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's lacking something. So they
[1:37:43] can have their planes.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; They can have their jets. They can have
[1:37:47] their Mercedes or what their fancy cars,
[1:37:50] whatever they have.
[1:37:52] Doesn't mean it's wrong to have one.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; But when they boast about it, Brother
[1:37:57] Brandham talked about it.
[1:38:01] I like one, too.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; But it's not going to get you in the
[1:38:06] rapture.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; It's going to give you a good ride from
[1:38:10] point A to point B.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with a good ride.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Help me, Jesus.
[1:38:22] [applause]
[1:38:29] The modern church, they offer their they
[1:38:31] offer music.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; They offer creeds and dogmas.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; They offer building programs and and
[1:38:38] excitement, but they reject the revealed
[1:38:41] word.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Cain was very religious but rejected
[1:38:44] God's provided way. The same thing
[1:38:46] repeats in this age. Amen. It's a repeat
[1:38:49] of it. Cain's altar was beautiful but
[1:38:51] lifeless.
[1:38:53] Abel's altar was simple but it had
[1:38:55] living life that was taken on it. The
[1:38:59] difference between them was revelation
[1:39:02] but always find even in in St. Matthew
[1:39:04] 13, I believe, is when Jesus gave the
[1:39:06] parable of the seed, the swer. And the
[1:39:09] disciples asked him, why are you given
[1:39:11] everything in a parable? And he said,
[1:39:14] because it's been given to you to
[1:39:15] understand the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:39:17] of God, but to them in parables, less
[1:39:19] seeing they could see, and hearing they
[1:39:21] could hear. Amen. That's why we can say,
[1:39:24] "Blessed are your eyes that can see, and
[1:39:26] your ears that can hear in this hour."
[1:39:28] Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; In the rapture message, brother Ram said
[1:39:30] Cain and Abel didn't have a Bible to
[1:39:32] read,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; but it was revealed to Abel by faith,
[1:39:35] which is a revelation. Abel offered unto
[1:39:38] God a more excellent sacrifice than that
[1:39:40] of Cain, which God testified that he was
[1:39:43] righteous. Amen. So in Eden, there was
[1:39:47] two worshippers.
[1:39:49] There was light and there was darkness.
[1:39:50] They were standing side by side, Cain
[1:39:52] and Abel, the church and the bride. And
[1:39:55] brother Bram said has been twins all the
[1:39:57] way from the beginning of time.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; It was twins then Cain and Abel. It was
[1:40:01] Jacob and Esau. Jesus and Judah. Now we
[1:40:04] have church carnal and church spiritual.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Back to twins again. But the truth is
[1:40:09] still marching on.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Both claim to serve God, but one
[1:40:13] was founded on reasoning and the other
[1:40:15] was founded on revelation.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; One reasons about the word and they can
[1:40:20] put everything in a certain order. The
[1:40:21] other one is by revelation. Amen.
[1:40:23] Reasoning can be changed, but revelation
[1:40:26] cannot be changed when it's anchored in
[1:40:27] a heart.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because it's true light.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Abel's Cain's spirit lives on. Abel's
[1:40:34] spirit lives on in the bride.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Humble, blood wash, and spiritled.
[1:40:39] And this was a distinction of
[1:40:41] separation. The bride and the church at
[1:40:44] that time. Revelation versus reasoning.
[1:40:48] Abel's recognized God's plan and offered
[1:40:51] rightly. And the Bible recognized her
[1:40:53] day in its message. Brother Brandham the
[1:40:55] off and offer spiritual sacrifices
[1:40:57] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:41:02] Recognition led to acceptance. When Abel
[1:41:06] rec received his revelation, he
[1:41:08] recognized God's provided way.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it changed him.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Noah recognized God's
[1:41:15] warning, he built an ark. That's right.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Against all the common understanding of
[1:41:20] that day, he built an ark.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; When Abraham recognized Elohim in in
[1:41:24] human form, he received him.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses recognized the voice from
[1:41:29] the burning bush. Who are you? He said,
[1:41:32] I am that I am.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is your name? I am. Amen. I
[1:41:37] want to say tonight, he's still the same
[1:41:38] I am.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; He's never changed. Amen. He's only
[1:41:42] revealed himself more and more and
[1:41:44] unveiled himself more until now. We can
[1:41:46] see the lovely one amongst us today.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Peter recognized Jesus as the Christ.
[1:41:53] Paul recognized the pillar of fire. He
[1:41:55] said, "Who are you, Lord?" And the
[1:41:57] pillar of fire spoke back to him. He
[1:41:59] said, "I'm Jesus." Amen. Whom you
[1:42:02] persecute? Why do you kick against the
[1:42:04] pricks? In other words, I'm trying to
[1:42:06] move you forward, but you're not
[1:42:07] allowing me to. Amen. But he was chosen
[1:42:10] by God. Amen. If you're chosen by God,
[1:42:13] you're going to come the hard way, the
[1:42:15] easy way. any way at all, you're going
[1:42:17] to come because God is not going to lose
[1:42:19] one.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got that assurance in my
[1:42:21] heart. Sometimes we I've heard people
[1:42:24] talk about their children this or that.
[1:42:25] I said, "Look, it God did not give me
[1:42:28] serpent sea children. He gave me
[1:42:29] children."
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I I claim every one of them in the name
[1:42:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every one of them can't get in
[1:42:38] on my experience or on your experience.
[1:42:40] They have to have their own experience.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that experience has to change
[1:42:45] their lives like it changed your life.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or what we'll have is just a bunch
[1:42:49] of lukewarm Christians. But God is not
[1:42:52] coming for a lukewarm church. Come on,
[1:42:54] church. He's coming for a church that's
[1:42:56] on fire for God. AMEN. ONE WHO KNOWS HER
[1:42:59] POSITION IN THE WORD, WHO STANDS UPON
[1:43:02] THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. THERE'S NO
[1:43:04] LUKEWARMNESS GOING IN THE KINGDOM OF
[1:43:06] GOD. AMEN. BLOODBOUGHT, HOLY GHOSTFILLED
[1:43:10] CHILDREN OF ALMIGHTY GOD. [cheering]
[1:43:13] It's gone.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Is looking for his children.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; So people think, well, but my children I
[1:43:21] I I always give this testimony and I'll
[1:43:23] give it again. I my mom and dad are in a
[1:43:25] certain season of life. My mom's my
[1:43:27] dad's 89. My mom is 84. And and I can s
[1:43:31] I saw God work in their life. Amen. To
[1:43:34] the place where where they were looked
[1:43:36] like there was no hope for them. But God
[1:43:39] completely changed their life.
[1:43:42] My mom's only desire right now is to be
[1:43:44] in church.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I say, "Well, that's a good desire.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; That's the best desire you can have."
[1:43:51] And we try to do whatever we can do to
[1:43:53] make try to get her into church. Amen.
[1:43:55] Because it encourages her.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. 10 years ago, it would not have
[1:44:00] been going to church. But now, God did
[1:44:02] something in her heart.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And such a thirst
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; for the things of God. I was speaking to
[1:44:08] one of my younger brothers who doesn't
[1:44:10] serve the Lord. And he and he told me
[1:44:11] the other day on the phone, he said he
[1:44:13] said, "You know, Kelly," he said, "I
[1:44:14] don't know if you know I read my Bible."
[1:44:17] I said, "No, I didn't know that." He
[1:44:19] said, "Well, I do. I read it every day."
[1:44:21] He said, "How can I not read it?" I got
[1:44:22] on on my phone in three versions.
[1:44:26] So he started quoting me quoting me
[1:44:28] scripture
[1:44:29] and I was listening to him quote quote
[1:44:31] to me and I didn't have time to really
[1:44:33] talk to him at the time but I thought
[1:44:34] Lord give me the wisdom I have need of
[1:44:36] in order to draw him back into the into
[1:44:38] the things of God.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's 59 years old. He's been
[1:44:42] straight from God for for 40ome years.
[1:44:45] Amen. But it doesn't matter how long.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Come on church. It don't matter how
[1:44:49] long.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The promise is that when you pray
[1:44:52] you expect a result. I don't pray with
[1:44:55] it might be or might or a hope. So I
[1:44:57] pray that God is going to move on the
[1:44:59] scene. Amen. And touch their lives.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've seen it happen in my
[1:45:04] daughter's life. I've seen it happen in
[1:45:06] my my parents' life, my brother in
[1:45:08] Australia. They're still serving the
[1:45:10] Lord. Amen. I LOOK AT IT. GOD IS STILL
[1:45:12] GOD. AMEN. We just got to trust his
[1:45:15] word. AND AMEN. DON'T GET IN A HURRY
[1:45:17] WITH GOD. JUST BELIEVE IT AND LIVE A
[1:45:19] LIFE
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; THAT SHINES THE GOSPEL LIGHT IN THIS
[1:45:24] HOUR. AMEN.
[1:45:26] There there's that song that where it
[1:45:28] talks about shining the gospel LIGHT AND
[1:45:30] I SAY LET IT SHINE IN THIS HOUR.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:36] When you get revelation, it brings
[1:45:38] relationship between you and God.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; It's a relationship. This is an age of
[1:45:43] confusion and mixture. An age of mixture
[1:45:46] where light and darkness walk side by
[1:45:48] side where truth is where they want to
[1:45:50] blend truth with air and where people
[1:45:52] mistake noise for anointing.
[1:45:55] Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Can I just preach for a bit?
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That doesn't mean we don't have
[1:46:00] noise. I if I if I didn't have any noise
[1:46:02] in my church, I' I'd bury it.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; I I'll be honest with you. Brother
[1:46:09] Brandham, he talked about Saskatoon.
[1:46:11] Said we were mos backed. I said that's
[1:46:13] not going to be me.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Nope. When I meet him on that
[1:46:16] day, I said, "Nope, that's not going to
[1:46:17] be me." I had a minister one time said,
[1:46:19] "Yeah, you guys are mossback. Your
[1:46:20] prophet says you guys got no no moving
[1:46:22] of God." I said, "No, that's not me.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; That's not me.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Sorry, that's not me."
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can you can hold that quote if
[1:46:30] you want to, but I said, "You better put
[1:46:32] it to somebody else cuz it's not me.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be our church." No.
[1:46:36] [applause and cheering]
[1:46:43] Because where the Lord is there there is
[1:46:45] liberty.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm looking at it in
[1:46:48] relationship to the world and what the
[1:46:51] way they view it and the way they look
[1:46:52] at it. Some people look at it. Well, we
[1:46:55] have all this moving and so God's
[1:46:56] moving, but I look at what you're what's
[1:46:58] it producing in your life?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's not producing something in
[1:47:04] your life, I would forget about it.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; I would I would I would keep searching
[1:47:08] until something would change to the very
[1:47:10] inside of my inside. Amen.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And the message knoweth it not. Hope
[1:47:19] this okay.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; He said now don't forget this. You'll
[1:47:22] see the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:47:24] Ghost is people can live in the spirit.
[1:47:26] They can dance in the spirit. They can
[1:47:27] shout in the spirit. They go to church
[1:47:29] in the spirit and they can be absolutely
[1:47:30] with the real spirit of God anointing on
[1:47:32] that spirit but still be lost. And just
[1:47:34] as devil possessed as they can be
[1:47:36] without that spirit. Amen. With that
[1:47:40] spirit. Excuse me. And you say, "Well,
[1:47:42] Brother Kelly, where does that put us?"
[1:47:44] You you know what's in your own heart.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:49] I know sometimes people look at that and
[1:47:50] it's maybe goes a little bit different
[1:47:52] different than sometimes the way we look
[1:47:54] at things. But I look at I've seen
[1:47:55] people anointed by the spirit of God and
[1:47:57] they leave the church and they go
[1:47:59] smoking and drinking and whatever come
[1:48:00] back and have the same experience again.
[1:48:02] Something's not right with that life.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That life needs to change.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We have a saying back home. You
[1:48:10] shouldn't jump any shout any higher than
[1:48:11] you're living. And I I say that's the
[1:48:13] truth. But if you're living really high,
[1:48:14] then shout real high.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let them let the anointing move
[1:48:18] upon you.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's not you you can be
[1:48:22] anointed and still be wrong. And brother
[1:48:23] Bram was looking at a flesh anointing
[1:48:26] that had not changed the inside of a
[1:48:28] person's life. What are you talking
[1:48:29] about, brother? I'm talking about
[1:48:30] separating.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about separating unbelief
[1:48:35] from the truth.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. take away all unbelief out of our
[1:48:39] lives.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I believe if if all unbelief
[1:48:43] is gone, I say in respect to myself,
[1:48:45] there's no unbelief, then it doesn't
[1:48:46] matter. If I'm sick, he's my healer.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; If I'm depressed, he's the my depression
[1:48:53] fixer.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'm under, if I'm feeling down
[1:48:57] and out, he's the one that gives me joy
[1:48:59] in my step.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we need to get our joy
[1:49:03] shoes on and put them on and just give
[1:49:05] the praise of God. Whether we feel like
[1:49:07] it or we don't feel like it.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because sometimes we don't feel
[1:49:11] like it. But I say whether you feel like
[1:49:13] it or not, give God the glory. Give him
[1:49:15] the praise. Amen. May there be a
[1:49:17] separation from our from unbelief to the
[1:49:20] things of God. Amen. He's a healer. He's
[1:49:23] a savior. He's a deliverer. He's our
[1:49:26] everything. AMEN. HE'S GOD IN THIS HOUR.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip just skip a little bit
[1:49:37] here. The Jews were expect were
[1:49:40] expecting the Messiah, but their
[1:49:41] expectation blinded them to his coming.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; They expected a warrior. God sent a
[1:49:46] lamb. Amen. They were looking for a
[1:49:49] conquering king, not a sacrificial lamb.
[1:49:51] They expected a throne, but God brought
[1:49:53] the cross. They wanted deliverance from
[1:49:56] Rome back in their day, but God offered
[1:49:58] them deliverance from sin. Amen. And I
[1:50:01] believe that the church is looking for
[1:50:02] God to deliver the church from from all
[1:50:05] unbelief that would be hindering this
[1:50:07] moving of the spirit of God.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Churches today are expecting a world
[1:50:12] revival, but they've they've failed to
[1:50:14] realize the revival in the bride.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is having her own
[1:50:18] revival.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is a revival? The revival
[1:50:22] isn't, Brother Bram said, is not
[1:50:23] necessarily putting in more numbers, he
[1:50:25] said, but it's taking what's in your
[1:50:26] life. Amen. And reviving it all over
[1:50:29] again. Amen. Where where the gospel
[1:50:32] doesn't become dead and and mundane to
[1:50:35] you, the gospel becomes living to you
[1:50:37] and alive to you.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's still the same living living
[1:50:41] word of God today is what it was the day
[1:50:43] that you got saved.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Churches are expecting, like I
[1:50:46] say, a world revival. I I I I watch I
[1:50:49] look at some of that stuff and there
[1:50:50] there's a big revival happening in our
[1:50:52] province over. They they had a prophet
[1:50:54] that told them to buy a certain land,
[1:50:56] then they got a revival. But you look at
[1:50:57] it and say, "What revival do they have?"
[1:50:59] There certainly is no word revival.
[1:51:01] Amen. But the bride is having a word
[1:51:03] revival. Amen. And it's not based upon
[1:51:06] emotion, but it's based upon knowing who
[1:51:09] you are in Christ.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an anchor to you. It's it's
[1:51:13] it's something that holds you within the
[1:51:15] veil. Amen. in Ephesians uh chapter 567
[1:51:20] 26-27 that he might sanctify and cleanse
[1:51:23] it with a washing of the water by the
[1:51:24] word that he might present it to himself
[1:51:26] a glorious church not having spot or
[1:51:28] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:51:30] should be holy and without blemish. I
[1:51:33] say that's for us for this day.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. No other age had the had the
[1:51:38] responsibility of the word like we have
[1:51:40] it in this age. And the message that in
[1:51:43] the message Satan Zena and brother Aram
[1:51:45] said Eve was was tested on one word but
[1:51:48] we're tested on every word of God in
[1:51:50] this hour. Some people look at it. How
[1:51:52] are we going to make it? He's already
[1:51:54] made it for you.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You just got to stand according to
[1:51:57] the word of God. Amen. And when the
[1:52:00] light of the word strikes your heart, if
[1:52:02] there's something that's in your life, I
[1:52:03] say get it out of your heart as quick as
[1:52:05] you can get it out of out of your heart.
[1:52:08] Amen. The message of today is leading us
[1:52:11] into the rapture.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; People might think that there's going to
[1:52:15] be another message coming. I say it's
[1:52:17] too late for that. The message has come.
[1:52:20] Amen. Malachi 4 has come.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; There is no eighth church age. There is
[1:52:25] no eighth church age. Hope I'm not
[1:52:26] stepping out of line here. H church age
[1:52:28] messenger. There's none of those things.
[1:52:31] Those are man-made philosophies and
[1:52:33] doctrines. They are not the light of the
[1:52:35] word of God. There was seven stars in
[1:52:37] the hand of Jesus. There was seven
[1:52:39] candlestands. Amen. That he walked in.
[1:52:42] We are in the consummation of the
[1:52:44] gentile age. Amen. And light has come in
[1:52:47] this hour and it's shining brightly in
[1:52:49] this hour. Amen. And trying to get us to
[1:52:52] reflect the very image of JESUS CHRIST.
[1:52:55] AMEN. DON'T LET IT GO BY YOU. AMEN.
[1:52:57] ACCEPT IT IN THIS HOUR AND LET YOUR LIFE
[1:53:00] SHINE IN ALL THE GLORY OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is a time when the mechanics
[1:53:06] and the dynamics are coming together and
[1:53:08] they're creating a force within your
[1:53:10] life. You say, "Brother Kelly, what
[1:53:12] force?" You can live above the things of
[1:53:14] this world in this Satan's Eden of this
[1:53:16] darkness and this dismal age we're
[1:53:19] living in. Amen. The devil and the and
[1:53:22] the world are underneath your feet.
[1:53:23] AMEN. AND YOU'RE STANDING ACCORDING TO
[1:53:25] THE WORD OF GOD. THERE'S only one way
[1:53:27] you CAN DO IT IS BY THE LIGHT of the
[1:53:29] gospel of Jesus Christ. There's no other
[1:53:31] way in this hour for it to happen. It
[1:53:34] takes the light of the word. Mysteries
[1:53:36] that were hidden since the foundation of
[1:53:38] the world. THEY'VE BEEN REVEALED in the
[1:53:40] hour that we're living in.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, church. Amen. The hidden
[1:53:44] revelation of the seven seals are made
[1:53:46] known in the hour that we're living in.
[1:53:47] What for? Just for more material? No. to
[1:53:50] show us who Christ is in this hour. That
[1:53:53] we can see our image that we're to come
[1:53:55] to in this hour. I want to say in this
[1:53:57] hour, the bride is not trying to become
[1:53:59] the word. She is the word manifestation
[1:54:02] of this hour. Standing faithful to the
[1:54:05] word of God.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; The son of man ministry is Christ
[1:54:08] revealing himself through the word, not
[1:54:10] through man-made wisdom, but through
[1:54:12] vindicated revelation in this end time
[1:54:15] hour. Amen. As it was in Abraham's day,
[1:54:18] so it is today. Elohim came down
[1:54:20] discerning the very thoughts in Sarah
[1:54:22] Sarah's heart. So the same God has come
[1:54:25] again in this hour manifesting the world
[1:54:27] calling out his elect before the fire
[1:54:29] falls. Amen. The same pillar of fire
[1:54:32] that followed Israel is here again
[1:54:34] leading the bride to her rapture time to
[1:54:38] her resurrection time. The bride
[1:54:40] recognizes a voice of of the voice of
[1:54:44] the bridegroom and she moves on with
[1:54:45] that in this hour. I want to conclude
[1:54:48] here tonight with just this one one last
[1:54:51] thought in in recognizing the Danish
[1:54:53] ministry where and we're very familiar
[1:54:56] with this Danish and its message.
[1:54:58] Brother Bramson said Israel's back in
[1:54:59] the homeland and natural force put
[1:55:01] Israel in the homeland but the power of
[1:55:03] God will put the people in the bride.
[1:55:05] The world forces one way and this way
[1:55:07] and the world forces that way. But God
[1:55:09] forces upward. The spirit of God, which
[1:55:11] is the word of God, my word is spirit
[1:55:13] and life, will put the bride in her
[1:55:15] place because she'll recognize her
[1:55:16] position in the word. Amen. And I
[1:55:19] emphasize that shield. Let's say that's
[1:55:21] me.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Say it one more time. That's me.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; She'll recognize her position in the
[1:55:26] word. She's in Christ will put her in
[1:55:29] her place. Amen. No national force will
[1:55:32] do it. But the national force did drive
[1:55:34] Israel to the homeland. the national
[1:55:36] force, the council of churches will
[1:55:38] drive every organization into it. But
[1:55:40] the power of God, praise the name of the
[1:55:42] God, will rise the bride into glory out
[1:55:44] of it. He said, "Oh people, recognize
[1:55:47] your day as Jesus warned you. The sign
[1:55:49] of Sodom and the church's condition of
[1:55:51] this day." Look what he said in this day
[1:55:54] would take place. Listen to it real
[1:55:55] close. The sign of Sodom would take
[1:55:58] place in this day. Sign like Abraham
[1:56:00] that day before Sodom that was called
[1:56:02] out. All these things was prophesied
[1:56:04] will take place that will be taking
[1:56:06] place now. Watch the day you're living
[1:56:08] in. We've went over it. He said and he
[1:56:10] said he has promised to send you
[1:56:12] heavenly light to ripen the word seed
[1:56:14] that will be sown for this day. I want
[1:56:17] to say that he has sent his word and he
[1:56:20] has sent his light.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are now moving on in the
[1:56:25] word of God.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride will be identified. This
[1:56:29] is the feast of the trumpets. The bride
[1:56:31] will be identified in him. Any woman
[1:56:33] must be identified with her husband for
[1:56:34] the two are one. And Christ's bride has
[1:56:37] to be identified with him for the two
[1:56:39] are one. And he is the word, not the
[1:56:41] denomination, the word. We are to be the
[1:56:43] children of light. And the light is the
[1:56:45] word which has made light for this day.
[1:56:49] He continues on. Children of light,
[1:56:51] accept his word. Keep walking and
[1:56:53] watching more unfold. He said, don't
[1:56:54] leave it. No matter what somebody says,
[1:56:56] stay in that and just keep walking with
[1:56:59] it. walk, watch it unfold and reveal
[1:57:02] itself. The word is a seed and a seed is
[1:57:05] the right kind of ground that will bring
[1:57:07] forth its kind. And I say that it will
[1:57:10] bring forth of its kind. Amen. The light
[1:57:13] has shone in the brightly in this hour.
[1:57:16] Amen. There was a day that it was a
[1:57:18] little bit dismal, but now the light has
[1:57:21] shone in the evening time. I believe
[1:57:23] that we're part of the evening time
[1:57:25] people. We're walking in light in this
[1:57:28] hour as he's in the light. Amen. Not of
[1:57:30] a former age, but of the hour that we're
[1:57:32] living in in the hour of today. Amen. I
[1:57:36] say God bless you. Amen. And may the L
[1:57:38] spirit of the Lord continue to be with
[1:57:40] you. God bless you, Brother Andrew.
[1:57:44] [applause]
[1:57:54] Can we give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:57:56] praise tonight? [applause]
[1:57:58] Hallelujah.
[1:58:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:58:05] Hallelujah. Kissy.
[1:58:08] See. Hallelujah.
[1:58:11] Hallelujah. Before I spoke a word, you
[1:58:16] were singing over me.

[2:21:48] the waters around them. They were

[2:22:05] They failed to [singing] remember.
[2:22:10] The [music] master was [singing] nigh
[2:22:14] and he [music] spoke the words
[2:22:18] and the winds all stood still.
[2:22:24] Even the [music and singing] waters

[2:23:58] all of the time.
[2:24:02] [music] And when trials [singing] come

[2:42:04] Say, "Come my soul." Oh, don't you dare
[2:42:08] shine. Oh, lift up your soul cuz you got
[2:42:14] a lion inside [music] of us. Oh, give.
[2:42:19] [singing]
[2:42:21] Can we sing it again now? [music] Say,
[2:42:23] "Come on, my soul."
[2:42:26] Come on, my soul. [music and singing]
[2:42:28] Oh, don't you get shift.
[2:42:33] Oh, you got [music] a lion inside of us.
[2:42:39] Oh, [music]
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. [music and singing]
[2:42:47] I'll throw up my hands and I'll praise
[2:42:51] you [music and singing] again. again and
[2:42:52] again.
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, all that I have is a hallelujah.
[2:43:00] [singing and music]
[2:43:04] Hallelujah.
[2:43:06] [music]
[2:43:09] I know it's [singing] not much.
[2:43:12] Nothing else fit for a king
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; except for a heart singing.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; I [music] can say
[2:43:40] that God has prepared
[2:43:43] us for this time. [music] Amen.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; God has prepared every one of these
[2:43:49] moments, every one of these [music]
[2:43:51] lives,
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; every one of you represented here, and
[2:43:54] God is in control of it all.
[2:43:59] As brother Kelly was preaching tonight,
[2:44:02] I'll just be honest,
[2:44:04] brother Kelly stood like a statesman,
[2:44:06] [music]
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; and this quote just kept coming in my
[2:44:08] mind while brother Kelly was just
[2:44:11] ministering the word.
[2:44:13] Brother Brandham said, "When a baby is
[2:44:14] conceived in the womb of a mother, when
[2:44:17] that one cell goes in there, another
[2:44:19] cell builds on top of that, [music]
[2:44:21] it's not one cell of a human and the
[2:44:23] next of a dog and the next of a cat and
[2:44:25] the next of something else. It's [music]
[2:44:27] absolutely straightly human being. And
[2:44:31] when a man is born of the spirit of God,
[2:44:33] he don't inject anything into his life.
[2:44:36] It's unadulterated word of God
[2:44:38] vindicated for that hour. [music] He
[2:44:40] takes the full word of God. He don't put
[2:44:43] no creeds, nothing else into it. It's
[2:44:46] [music] purely unadulterated. God's word
[2:44:48] made manifest amongst you. He said,
[2:44:50] "Look in the Bible. You see what age
[2:44:53] that we're living in. When you see these
[2:44:55] great things being made manifest, when
[2:44:57] God promised to do it, he always does it
[2:45:00] at the end of each age. When the church
[2:45:02] has come to the turning place and it's
[2:45:04] turned from the word back to sin and
[2:45:08] worldliness, worldliness is sin." The
[2:45:10] Bible said, "If you love the world, the
[2:45:12] things of God, [music] the things of the
[2:45:14] world, the love of God's not even in
[2:45:16] you." But we've not turned back to the
[2:45:19] world.
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; We are at a turning point. Brother
[2:45:22] Brandham said, "It took a master
[2:45:24] craftsman to be able to turn the
[2:45:26] corner." [music]
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; And this message tonight, as I watched
[2:45:29] the man of God stand there like a
[2:45:31] statesman and build sale on top of sale
[2:45:34] on top of sale, he was not building a
[2:45:37] lukewarm church. He was not building a a
[2:45:41] denominational kind of a church. He was
[2:45:43] building sale on top of sale like a
[2:45:46] mother and a father when they're when
[2:45:48] they're having that little child when
[2:45:50] it's conceived in there. This bride has
[2:45:53] been taken on the word of God and it's
[2:45:55] building sail on TOP OF SAIL AND SIN
[2:45:58] DROPS OFF ON THIS SIDE AND we get a
[2:46:00] little BIT LIGHTER AND WE START CLIMBING
[2:46:02] INTO RAPTURE and grace. SAIL ON TOP OF
[2:46:05] SAIL UNTIL WE COME TO THE PERFECT
[2:46:08] STATURE OF THE PERFECT MAN of God.
[2:46:11] [music]
[2:46:12] &gt;&gt; We are prepared for such a time as this.
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, Queen Esther. I know you got a
[2:46:19] line on the inside of you and you know
[2:46:21] how pertinent this message was to you.
[2:46:26] I say that tonight was that kind of
[2:46:28] night when the king extended his scepter
[2:46:30] to you. One more time say you got grace
[2:46:32] to come here to my presence. DON'T YOU
[2:46:35] WORRY ABOUT WHAT ANYBODY else says.
[2:46:37] Don't you worry about what anything
[2:46:38] else. I EXTENDED MY SCEPTER of grace
[2:46:41] towards your life AND YOUR FLESH HAS
[2:46:44] BEEN SEPARATED. LIGHT HAS BEEN
[2:46:47] SEPARATING DARKNESS ALL THROUGHOUT THIS
[2:46:49] BUILDING TONIGHT. And if you knew what I
[2:46:52] knew,
[2:46:53] YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT GOD'S GREAT
[2:46:56] LIGHT, HIS GREAT SPOTLIGHT HAS SHINE
[2:46:59] DOWN across this congregation tonight.
[2:47:03] And I begin to watch the waters roll
[2:47:05] back and darkness roll back.
[2:47:09] And I want to say this because I feel
[2:47:11] the presence of the Lord here is that
[2:47:13] God said it is good. [music]
[2:47:18] I say what has happened in your life,
[2:47:20] God says it is good.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; I say what brother Michael did while he
[2:47:24] was leading the worship here tonight. I
[2:47:26] say it's good.
[2:47:29] [applause and music]
[2:47:33] It's something amazing [music] when the
[2:47:36] spirit of the Lord begins to work all
[2:47:38] over the building. Brother Matthew, my
[2:47:41] brother, had text me before service
[2:47:42] said, "If you wouldn't mind, I'd like
[2:47:45] for you to sing There is a blood."
[2:47:49] And I had it here in my notes to sing
[2:47:52] [music] cuz that's what I'm doing while
[2:47:53] I'm building notes while a preacher's
[2:47:56] preaching. I'm building songs to [music]
[2:47:58] fit right in with the message. And I
[2:48:01] just felt to stop and invite Brother
[2:48:03] Michael. And his song is [music] There
[2:48:06] is a blood.
[2:48:09] I say God's in control of this building.
[2:48:12] I say God's in control of your thoughts.
[2:48:15] I'd say when you speak something in the
[2:48:17] atmosphere, something happens.
[2:48:20] CAN YOU SAY THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
[2:48:22] TONIGHT? Can you GIVE GOD PRAISE AND
[2:48:25] SAY, "GOD HAS DONE SOMETHING GOOD IN MY
[2:48:29] LIFE TONIGHT." Won't you look at your
[2:48:31] neighbor, shake their hand, AND SAY,
[2:48:32] "GOD HAS DONE something good in my
[2:48:35] life."
[2:48:37] Hallelujah.
[2:48:40] Well, I just want to praise his name.
[2:48:43] My goodness, what a meeting
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; where the king comes.
[2:48:49] It's everything to me, ain't it?
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't it to you the same way? Do you
[2:48:54] love the Lord with all your heart?
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to let you be
[2:48:58] dismissed tonight and [music] go in the
[2:48:59] name of the Lord. Come expecting. I tell
[2:49:02] you, my heart's full.
[2:49:04] And there's a little song that says,
[2:49:05] "I'm drinking from a saucer cuz my cuz
[2:49:08] my cup's [music] overflowing."
[2:49:10] I say, "Let it just pour on out all over
[2:49:13] us, saturate our beings, and I want to
[2:49:16] soak it up like a big old sponge." And I
[2:49:18] don't want to leave anything here this
[2:49:19] weekend. I come expecting. And I believe
[2:49:22] you have, too.
[2:49:24] Let's receive something from the Lord. I
[2:49:27] want you to do something. I want you to
[2:49:28] pray that God would deal with Brother
[2:49:30] Kelly in his night season tonight to
[2:49:32] [music] come. You know good and well
[2:49:34] there'll be more people here tomorrow
[2:49:35] that wasn't here tonight. And I want you
[2:49:37] to pray specifically for those people
[2:49:39] that God would do something. Use our
[2:49:42] brother Kelly in the middle of his night
[2:49:43] season that God would speak directly to
[2:49:46] him to say a word for our brothers and
[2:49:48] sisters. For every one of us. Can you do
[2:49:51] that?
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; Don't pray for yourself tonight. I want
[2:49:53] you to pray for your brothers and
[2:49:55] sisters in this time of thanksgiving and
[2:49:57] gratitude. [music] Aren't we thankful
[2:49:59] for brothers and sisters that'll fight
[2:50:00] for you? that'll pray for you.
[2:50:04] [applause]
[2:50:05] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. It's
[2:50:08] good to be in the house of the Lord. God
[2:50:10] bless you. You're dismissed tonight in
[2:50:12] Jesus name. [music] God with you.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:50:59] [music]
