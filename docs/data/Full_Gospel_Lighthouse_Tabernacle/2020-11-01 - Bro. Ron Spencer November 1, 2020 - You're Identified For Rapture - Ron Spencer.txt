little fish about that long out in the middle of the ocean saying i better drink of this water sparingly i might run out someday that's nothing compared with what the blessings god's got for you could you imagine a little mouse or the great garnerers of egypt saying i just better eat a few grains each day because it might not last through the winter why i could never eat it in a thousand lifetimes neither could you officer the blessings that god's got later from you if you live 10 million years you're on earth there'll still be plenty of blessings for you left for he is the inexhaustible

when we can all be back together as a as an audience and amen and so but i thought last night was awesome i i and i want to thank the sister anna and all of those that worked on that the youth thing that for the pastor appreciation that was just we've had laughs and tears and all of those things and and i love these guys with all my heart and so amen we we we certainly do appreciate the lord he's just really really good to us amen amen every one of them has got a separate action that they do and they love you and we thank the lord for that good to see brother meadows here and the family with us this morning i was thinking about it this morning early and i thought you know now that home has a representative to step back this way you know sometimes we look at it as great morning when we lose one but we realize that that in a few days when that resurrection happens she'll walk down the walk and you come around the corner and you go i know her i know her amen hallelujah so we just are we thank you for those comments brother donnie i certainly felt the presence of the lord at that funeral and god knows how to aim so unction his word and so we're just we're we're thankful for that he's just really good to us last night when andrew spoke he's still jesus that sounds so simple but so profound and he's still jesus and he's the same yesterday and the same today and forever and his power does not diminish anything in that glorious amen we love the lord this morning and so good to see you and amen he's wonderful to us we i i've got something i want you to pray about and i i just don't know kind of what's going on i i have a i have brain scans and lung scans and all the kind of blood work and see every doctor i think in the neighborhood on november the 11th 11th november 11th is an important day in history november 11th has been an important day it's one of the days to worry that angels stopped the war and they still ain't figured out how that war stopped brother brahm said angels stopped it and so i'm looking at it as a day of armistice day or or a day to worry that it that cancer's going to realize it's got to leave and so i'm looking for some really good news and so we thank the lord for that you know brother branham said in this day that there would be limbs restored you know and sometimes we get caught in a certain avenue of a thought that well we'll see an arm or we'll see a leg or we'll see a deal and we in this year have seen a body destroyed and we've seen a body restored amen amen standing right in your pulpit and you saw it go we watched it go all the way down into july and watched it couldn't go i could did not work a day with the boys and then all of a sudden get a touch and from that point on never miss a day amen amen haven't missed a weekend since so amen that's even more important than that so we love you with all of our hearts this morning sorry to have you standing but i just want to read some scripture for you this evening if you will turn with me to psalms chapter 27 and verse 1. so good to have you in the house of the lord those that are listening in glad to have you here as well and i just think it's so wonderful that we have so many friends around the world and new friends that we understanding that we've got four new converts that have that have came in and one day we'll be able to tell you the story but we're certainly thankful for that and i think it's four different professors that have given their heart to the lord in getting baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and and what i'm being told is that this is being played and you'll like this brother in bluefield where brother gabriel went to school it's on seven different tvs there in the school they're watching this live and not only are they watching this live but there are some portuguese children that are young or college people that are there that don't comprehend english as well as they should and so it's being translated live in portuguese at that college as well and it's also going on in pennsylvania too and so in a college there and so if you trust me i'll use you like never before amen amen hallelujah i want to speak to you today and because this is your scriptures i want to speak to you on your identification you're identified for rapture that's your purpose i want you to think about that for a moment it's your purpose sister linda good to see you here amen of course sister joyce too but sister lin had been sick we're glad to have her back psalms chapter 27 and if you remember this this is where brother branham took his text for the rapture the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell and host should camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing that i have desired of the lord that i will that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble boy we've got that now for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up on a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will saying yea i will sing praises unto the lord you may be seated and may the lord bless the reading of his word today in the sermon identification this was the text that brother branham would use he said let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus and that's enough to preach for a year let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant that was made in the likeness of man and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god hath also highly exalted and given him a name which is above every name and that's through all time caesar's not above him augustus is not above him alexander's not above him pharaoh's not above him whatever whatever presidents that is elected this week is not above him are you with me now that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things that are in heaven and things in earth and things underneath the earth and every tongue should confess that jesus is christ the lord the glory of our father in the trial brother branham makes this statement he says though we be alienated though we're in a dark world of unbelief and sorrow and sickness and death yet he said let's act like sons and daughters of god that's quite a statement didn't it we are sons and daughters of god of the king it ought to change our attitude everything no matter what the rest of the world is we must hold on to the rights of god we remember that this is not our home these are some profound words now this is not our home and we're not of this country we're not of this world we're born of the spirit of god which is above now remember when god said let there be let there be let there be it's not an evolving end to that's what it is are you with me now he said if you would ask me for a tree i'd give you an oak tree i'd give you an acorn it has the potential in it it's not going to produce pine it's going to produce an oak tree are you with me every seed produces of its kind now man comes along and through genetic manipulation has destroyed a lot of things and they've done that with the word of god that's why there's 40 000 denominations or thoughts or opinions but god's words never change god's an unchanging god when god said let there be grass green grass he could have said it let it be purple and that's the way it would be even today that grass does not have to try to be something else it is exactly what it is seeds of reproduction many of you look in the mirror and as you get older you see your father you see your mother i was standing in front of the mirror the other day and i i looked there and i i thought there's my dad i heard somebody the other day say you look more like your dad and i thought that's a compliment that's a compliment i i think we should look like our father and i as i just kind of uh thought on those things over the last couple of weeks i thought i hope i look like my heavenly father you see it was god's placing of a germ of wheat and even in that germ of weed he identifies it has certain characteristics inside of it that produces what it is men have tried to reproduce a hand but that hand i want you to just look at your hand now god produced that hand for you that hand works that hand has strength that hand can grip that hand can feel that hand can show tenderness and kindness it can show also it can show the strength of a father or the strength of a mother it can show to a a baby's bottom that you love it while the baby goes daddy mama please don't do that don't then we're going it's hurting me more than i always wondered about that but you see god made that hand man in his great knowledge cannot produce that in in all the schools of the world they can't reproduce one that works and feels and touches and and can do everything that that can do because god made it and he made it in his own image hallelujah are you with me now now in god making your hand every one of us would have fingertips and it would have identification markers even on your fingers and you can you can be identified by your fingers you can also be identified by your eyes nobody's got eye prints exactly like you you see you can go through the whole world and i hear i have seen people that look exactly like another person brother ray lambert has a twin and brother harold hildebrandt's church brother ed head of hammer meister's church and he has an absolute twin and i shake his hand and and i tell him your twins doing real well but their fingerprints are not alike their eyes are not alike you see god builds us as an individual so different and in the infinite sea of god's mind god chose you and built you and knew how tall you'd be and what you'd be like and even through the fall what your weaknesses would be and the strains of your humanity but you see god chose you you didn't choose god are you with me you wasn't looking for god you were making decisions going the other way but god rich in his mercy came after you and you have may have run for decades and you may have run for years you may still be on the run you may still be doing your own thing in life and think well i'm getting by but well god will one day find you he knows how to get a hold to you you say well brother run but i've made so many mistakes and i continue to make mistakes and i continue to fail and i'm so embarrassed about even my savior amount myself let me just remind you god loves to abolish sin did you catch that god loves to destroy sin he loves to take his blood oh we ought to be shouting about right now because when you were born your forefathers all of their sins fell down on your little sweet humanity and though you be so sweet and so kind and charlie doesn't make any hardly anything that would make you mad but you passed your weaknesses of humanity down to him brother nathanael sister caitlin passed through that through the chromosomes past weaknesses on him but there's a blood of jesus christ that can break the chains of sin and you don't have to stay alienated from the commonwealth of god oh but i was a sinner let me just say this to you you always was a son of god you just acted like a sinner you just had a lot of bad habits there was a lot of things stowed on you but you never was you never was a pig you always was a sheep oh glory [Applause] hallelujah no i think it's sometimes fitting some of the things that people brings to us and they they don't know that they're doing just exactly the right things but god leads them brother denny brought us a you would be very aware of what this is it's a seal from the railroad and he didn't go chop it off no railroad nowhere but these are railroad seals and they're old and he brought brought a few of us a seal well the seal is very important in the message brother branham talks about the inspector and an inspector's got an important job he goes inside of the railroad car and he checks it and makes sure that it's packed right now if it would be dry pack he would go in and make sure that everything is tied in exactly right and he would make sure and not just to make it look good on the you know just to just to make it look make it l as it's stacked right but it has to be it has to be held down and and it has to be tied down right it has to have the chains in the right place and the board's in the right place because it's got a journey that's got to be made and it may be hundreds of miles or even thousands of miles or even maybe transported even overseas and you see once he gets done he identifies himself with that boxcar and not only does he put a seal on it but that seal also has a has a signature that goes with the paperwork with the number of that seal i can attest that this boxcar is ready for the journey because when it goes down the goes down the railway there's going to come some shaking there's going to be some turbulence along the way and i've made a seal that they're going to make it through the journey are you with me now that's why you got to have the holy ghost where things get tied down right in your life are you with me because cause god can't live in a contaminated vessel and so there's certain things that's got to come out of your life and you got to tell it i'm not putting up with that no more god help me cleanse me from this thing in my life and as it comes up because we've got a journey to make and that journey is for rapture there's a destination that goes with that seal are you with me and let me just say it's a phenomenal find to break the seal many many years ago i had the job of putting making sure that trucks were packed right with what they call desiccators which are large large containers of lava nitroglycerin and we would use a product to to stabilize it then we put it in tractor trailers or trucks or even box cars and put it in there and we had certain we had certain standard barriers that we put in around it held it and each each container held 1500 pounds of nitroglycerin which is basically looks like stem milk with a product in it to keep it stabilized but yet you don't want to play with that and so you'd place that in just right you'd make sure it's just right because there might come an accident because you're driving down the interstate and some of them are hauling hey some are hauling paper cups some are hauling steel beams some are hauling plywood but some of those trucks are hauling atomic weapons you better hope that the guy that put the seal on wasn't in a hurry to go get his coffee and so many times there's too many churches want to put a seal on and say oh this is rapture material when you're steel are you with me and you can list the sins and it's just simply unbelief listen sin is only unbelief why do people do what they do they don't believe well brother ron why is this dre why is this one dressed this way why was this one do this you know the internet's put stuff out now that people just you wonder why that they would put their picture like that but they're really telling what's on the inside of them why i'm not ready for the rapture and listen and listen let me just say this to you brother frazier many years would stand here one of his how many remembers his statement your sins will find you out how many remember he said he said your sins will find you out god has a law that you can't go through this life what you do in secret will be brought to light and you think well i'm getting by with tonight don't kid yourself it's only an attribute of unbelief let me just say if you really believed you do something about it someone sent me a note last night said pray for me i'm just anxious i have all kind of anxiety and you know pray for me and you had a good list of stuff today and i simply sent them a note do what you need to do well brother on that's pretty cruel before you can get a seal i can't do it for you i'll bow on my knees and pray for you you got to do what you got to do i can't pray for you i can't live right for you you got it somebody help me preach right don't get clapped but i'm only getting started i'm only getting started i'm not going to give you a 40 minute version today we're going to be here satan's been giving me a hard time i'm getting ready to give him a real hard time so i'm going to preach to you and give you a rib eye salad sweet potato apple pie and ice cream with a cherry on top and you can drink sweet tea and coffee if you want to we're going to burn the devil's head for a little bit cause we're identified for [Applause] rapture i've heard people say that well preachers are just legalists they didn't like brother branham because of they wanted him to not preach on women now he is the messenger identified we're talking about identification for rapture let me just let me just stop here just for a moment moses had a job and his job was to get people across in an ark okay build an ark and he worked 120 years and he preached that 120 years he was the designated germ seed of life to preach a message and though it seemed to tarry the vision would come to pass and there was nothing that satan could do to stop when the bellows of the deep opened up and the heavens opened up listen those people outside of the ark became believers that old man was a foggy that old man was a lot of different things they made a lot of fun of him but today he was god's messenger let us in but you notice it wasn't noah's message it was god's message god sent a man out of a desert named moses as a one-man invasion to go to the mightiest army the mightiest political power the richest nation and to command them to let my people go and sitting there with his raised up in him eye to eye moses walked in there and told him let god's people go 40 years had separated their fellowship and now moses didn't look like the moses that left moses didn't talk like the moses that left he didn't carry himself with the royalty that he left but he had been in the presence of god and he had a message it didn't matter that none of those egyptians believed him or not those jews were leaving they were identified for our exodus out of there listen they've been there for 400 years with a promise that they're coming out but this generation was identified for exodus and the slaves they were being whipped and they were being tortured but they were identified for an exodus but neither could moses preach noah's message and noah couldn't preach moses's message when brother branham comes he has a message now you know some people want to pick apart brother branham and they want to make a whole matter of fun of his humanity i'm going to go some places right here you see god builds a man and fits him for the nature of the people so here god brings a man from literally the backwoods of kentucky with a with the ability to storytell to where it made you feel like you were there give me some levity now how many of you feel like that when brother branham picks up an apple off of the ground and an infidel is sitting on the porch you feel like you've been to that house and brother brown's spinning that apple in his hands and he and the man's telling him said yellow jackets done eat them up i have what you want and then he turns and looks at a post and he talks to him about the law of nature you know the sap's leaving that tree let me just set a a couple water there when it when it goes down said will will the water and that go back down that post no well what what intelligence tells that tree you're telling me there's no god but what intelligence tells that tree it's kind of like you look out here this is god's great artwork what intelligence tells those trees that was green and beautiful only uh maybe 60 days ago now some of them are red some of them yellow some of them are all different colors and it just works listen you can do what you want to you can stand on the edge of this parking lot and say winter don't come don't come i hate snow don't come i hate ice don't come i don't want below 40 degrees don't come but i don't like zero weather you can stand there all you want to you can't stop it are you with me the flood was coming you couldn't stop it the exodus was coming you couldn't stop it jesus was coming you couldn't stop it brother branham was standing there and he had a unique gift and it was the son of man on display in this age and god was embodying a prophet to to stand there some of this is as fresh to me as it is to you too and i'm just i'm enjoying this as much as you are but i'm not i want you to just watch this i really didn't know where this quote would fit in but here it is he says now i'm going to pray for you the bible says that the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise them up and if i have found grace in your sight by the working of the holy spirit i'll pray with all my heart right now that the holy spirit will witness to you that the work is finished oh god my father i come in jesus name to pray for this people who has now honestly and sincerely have confessed their wrongs oh blessed god made this be a night that they'll never forget may the holy spirit come in every heart just now and move out all everything and all the sickness from their body now watch what he does now i now challenge the devil to a debate you ever heard john hagee do that you're probably not listening to him but i guarantee you've never done it now watch these next words satan you are aware that you're whipped [Laughter] identified now he's identified now brother adam's going to identify him and he's going to tell him exactly where he's at your identification tells you exactly where you're at let me just stop there just a moment he said brother ron why did you make those statements about the internet just a few moments ago i was only trying to catch you up to the identification that god knows everything about you i just read an article the other day that now it's going to trend is going to be that they're going to search your internet and all of your behavioral practices to know who you are and they can know who you are by even what you like and you just pin and go i like that i like that i like that and you may like somebody a a naked woman in a bathtub with a whiskey jug in her hand and you like that some hollywood star and you dislike that you're identified with that character then are you with me the man that was the marlboro man he was a john he was a friend of john wayne never smoked in his life you know right never smoked in his life but he had the look he had the ranch he had the characteristics so they put him on a horse and he held a cigarette in his hand and he had to go back and apologize to his children and his grandchildren don't look at what i advertised all those years but he was identified help me preach now i'm not identified with hank williams jr [Applause] i'm not identified with some nascar star i'm not identified with some nfl guy i'm not an inner i'm identified with jesus christ i am not ashamed of this gospel hallelujah hallelujah i've got to hold to something i'm not ashamed to be identified with to make a rapture you're gonna have a seal and not everybody in this building's got a sale i'm not judging you you're judging you you're judging you your life is telling you what you are now the holy ghost will brood over your life let me just share this with you people will walk out of this church or churches around the world and they'll think they'll think that they're going and getting by with it but every once in a while the spirit of god will come back and haunt their soul because they've grieved their soul away listen if you grieve god away he will hey he's preaching today he will come and haunt you and you'll feel conviction and and it'll stay there for a few days and you'll want to get back in church or maybe even come for a month or two and then right back in the world again and you'll cycle and cycle and cycle it's because they grieve their soul away they had a chance to repent listen brother ron that's wrong let me just say cain was given a chance to repent god told cain serpent seed do is your brother and you'll be forgiven you've accepted your sacrifice but he refused to repent america is at that point america is at the point they have refused to repent tuesday they'll prove it don't get nervous about it don't you wish you had one you notice the other day we had a supreme court judge rights all over america if you read her qualifications she's way overqualified but if you notice what she was she's a catholic and if you remember kavanaugh they gave him an all kind of problems but now it's all catholic and a jew there on our supreme court brother branham said that in 1954 and it's been fulfilled in the last couple of weeks someone told me the other day said what about that beautiful woman that brother branham talks about in with the white house when is that going to be fulfilled have you been asleep have you been asleep miss universe has been miss trump the last four years well brother gone they're going to have cars that can drive them down the road have you been asleep you thought i was talking politics i was actually talking visions [Music] oh one day one day one day one day it's going to happen and it's already happened and a prophet standing there said this is going to happen and that's going to happen and that's going to happen and listen let me just say it wasn't what william branham's opinions was it was god's thoughts because this isn't the message of wicked brahim this is the message of the lamb and it only came to put magnification on this book to open it up to where you could understand it this wasn't feeding on the mind of a man it's feeding on the body word of the son of man and your your identification as the predestinated seed of god is when you hear it you're like hattie right you say that's absolutely the truth all glory that's absolutely the truth i may not understand it but i believe it with all my heart [Applause] oh three years a vision i held close to my heart whitney's gonna have a baby three years i carried it with his name and i refused to say it i refused to utter that name across my lips and i held it because it was like it was like i was holding a mandate of god it wasn't hold real tight to this now catch this real quick are you with me you know who i'm talking to it wasn't a question of if it's going to happen so it doesn't matter what the devil whispers in your ears it doesn't matter what he says and it doesn't matter the critic and it was an impossibility for her womb and then after his hips were destroyed and his human anatomy was destroyed it looked like it was totally impossible can you imagine how many times satan whispered in my ear if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before and he when he was born when he was born listen when they came through the prayer line that night in august and i said the angel of god is visiting your house and it's time for the vision to be fulfilled and sister autumn and brother jonathan was next in line and i looked at him and i said any same angel is visiting your house and they both go to the same doctor not knowing in total secrecy and show up at the same time god's really neat how he works now mr critic let me just say this to you you couldn't stop it you see it's the devil that gets in the details it's the devil that tries to stop you in every way oh i feel like preaching he tries to stop you because he knows what you're identified for [Applause] you're not tree germ seed you're not camel germ seed you're not denominational germ seed [Applause] you're the germ seed brod the predestinated broad of jesus christ and there's nothing there's nothing that the devil can do to stop it satan's tried everything that he can to do to stop the word of god bring me a paper towel i preached at brother joe green's camp meeting last year it was last year wasn't it i appreciate his camp meeting last year in north carolina while i preached two preachers in particular tried to stop me while i was preaching say 800 people there maybe and two men try to stop me preaching and they literally put their heels in the ground and they tried to stop me listen a demon sphere to try to stop you while you're preaching and because i could see where it was coming from i wanted to be i wanted to i wanted to be delicate with it but i wanted to get them to know i know where it's coming from and i stopped and i said now you stop holding back on me now because they were turning away from the message and they had been messaged preachers for a long time and they're turning away from the message of the hour and they come to that meeting to cause problems it won't stop god and i i stopped two or three times and i said let up let up you know who i know now who you are and finally i stopped and i said i'll call your name. if you don't stop you see i'm not scared because i know where i'm at i'm not scared once he tells me i'm not scared are you with me that's the reason when you sit in this building right here it's a good place to repent because it's me it's not me that can see your sin there's another one preaching and if you're the seed of god he'll call you out in your bathtub they eased up they quit they stopped they backed off i finished preaching it was just a just a shake in the building that reverence of god and i could feel the angel on the platform last night we were visited by an angel it was in the back room is this okay and i was telling sister sarah and brother gabriel because we got here early because of the funeral and i just we had been just small talking i'm getting off channel here for a moment but this is this is a good spot for you to relax and so i was just talking to them and i was just and all of a sudden i felt the channel to move about brother biscuit being in the car and i said you know i always pondered brother nathanael i always pondered about when brother biscuit tells his story and i've heard it i've heard i've heard it from brother biskell i've been with brother biskell and preached conventions all over the world and and i heard it over and over again about and there was something that was always in my mind about when the angel drops in the car he's forward looking back into the car blaine is in the back seat brother branham his face turns ashen his beard is standing out and he's tilted his head back and brother biscuit said my head was thrust brother kenny he said my head was thrust against the window and he said i looked out of the corner of my eye and he said brother branham looked like a dead man and he said it was a being that was in the car but if you remember what he talks about and he's told it for decades they were talking about brother branham talks about could this be the ministry of elijah and he said in that moment the angel drops in the car you don't need 10 000 people there you don't need ten thousand people well brother ron we believe brother briskell and brother biscuits made mistakes in his life so have you so have you well how can we believe that the witness of one man we believe the witness of mary a teenage girl that met an angel of the lord and he called her by name because she was identified she was identified to be the mother of jesus christ the very incubator to carry the word of god [Applause] we believed her and i was sharing that testimony with them and as i came to that angel dropping in the car he came in the back room brother gabriel's testimony because he stays with me a bit he move in with me if he wants me to i like having a state trooper living with me there's a young man that's been raised in the message but he had a desire to meet the god of this message it's not enough to know the message it's not enough to know the books and the quotes and the tapes and all of the things you want to know jesus and he told me this morning he said i want to be in that supernatural presence he said i want to be in that it's because he's identified identified for that there's a purpose we're identified for this hallelujah my boys want to come to this place they're identified for this it doesn't matter what you live in no matter what you go no matter what you drive this is only temporal you're identified for rapture hallelujah in north carolina i was coming toward the end of the service and i knew the angel was on the platform i say that with incredible reverence and i hope you understand that i don't pretend to be a prophet but i am a message preacher and this message is accompanied by the angel of the lord i don't have to back the message up he is here to do that i don't have no special revelation on it i don't have some way out supernatural gift all i know is if i put my finger in a bucket of water and pull it out that's how important i am find the whole that's how important i am but i do know this god's got a purpose in my life and satan has done everything that he can do to destroy this body but he can't stop this he has proved he don't have enough to stop this ministry [Applause] let me just say this to you church he has proven and vindicated to us i don't have enough to stop the god in ron spencer satan that's made his challenge he's proved it he's actually vindicated us that he don't have enough he would have if he could have [Applause] lightning strikes strokes hurt full forty feet afar stage four brain and lung condition brother ron are you daring the devil no i'm just telling him i'm looking at him squaring the eyes i'm not muhammad ali but is that the best that you got because i got a god behind me i'll only be a few more minutes now and i'll pick this up next sunday and i said if god can't operate out here he'll operate behind a carton and that's exactly how i pointed behind the curtain and in that building many of you have never been in that building that building is a monster auditorium it holds i don't know how many people but it but it holds quite a few people and it has huge because it's theatrical orchestra all different kind of things has huge curtains and they're black curtains i could go into the details of why they use black because it's there's a reason for it but anyway they use black curtains it's because it shines it shows everything in front of it that's what it does it shows everything in front if you if you put white or red or blue it'll absorb what's in front of but when you use black it stands out it's kind of like a diamond hey it's coming up here like a like a fire hose it's kind of like a diamond you don't put a diamond on a piece of white cloth to try to show it off you take a diamond and if it's two carrots you put it on black curtain cloth because just throw a little light on it with that black curtain cloth and every every diamond that's inside of that piece of rock will scream out that's why you take god's diamonds and put it in laodicea and you could put it in the worst day in the worst hour under the worst conditions and you put a little light on it and every attribute of that diamond will shine [Applause] oh glory to god let it shine let it shine so i'm stepping off of the stage and i'm done i take my bible i take my coat matthew is my guy that takes care of me always even here have someone that's designated to take care of me because it's like you're standing in two worlds at the same time like what i'm doing this morning some of you're not aware of this some of you eaten or whatever but i'm standing in two worlds i'm operating in two dimensions i step through behind those curtains and i start to step to the office and all of a sudden the spirit of god whirls me around and caitlyn that is standing right back there so many people that are that are on the internet can you just okay sister caitlyn can you stand can you get a shot before next week there will be a thousand people see you so wave adam she was praying for a baby isn't that right and she's praying for baby and in that presence god spoke to her some words that were very private and then turned to nathan nathanael and brought them two together to the very weak the very day a year later the very day a year later charlie was born not ron spencer god sister jackson came and she got a real touch from god her husband walked up said you've been neglecting the gift 17 years you need to be more sincere and give yourself to it and now he's preached in many churches many meetings since that time 17 years he'd fought it but god knew it another and another and guido interesting interesting that this would be the time to one year ago today gato died a real friend of mine a real friend of mine and i'm not going to go into the privacy issue he was a real friend of mine oh we might as well stick a sword in the devil anyway it was right up here on big meadows how many knows what big meadows is that for years he had asked me years he'd asked me said brother ron i have a question for you and it seemed like whenever he had asked me that something would come up and we wouldn't get to the question you'll like this and he comes here and homer would call him jido never could say guido but he'd call him cheeto and we go off on big meadows on monday and he and his wife and sister connie and their daughter jessica they're probably going to watch this maybe watching now and brother guido would say he told me he said brother ron i have a question and he throw his head back we were standing at the lodge and we we just walked through we were going to have coffee and he said i he said i just have a question and i looked and i saw it was real sincere i turned and there were some chairs sitting there there were tall chairs and you put your feet on the top rung and you'd sit there and so guido guido put his knee right against my knee and he was sitting there and he went i have a question brother ron i've been wanting to ask you this for years and i said just a moment brother guido before you ask me let me tell you what your question is you try that i said you were 15 years old when it happened now that you know that i'm in another world let me tell you your best friend that was with you his name was eddie and he went my god and i said i want to tell you guido you're forgiven let me just say this to you god could look down your path today not through me but god could look down your path call your name your friend's name if your friends are not drawing you closer to god run from them run from them in the name of jesus christ i adjure you run from them and be identified with this christ today run to an altar run to a place of mercy that guido right after the baby charlie right after dwayne and i stand before guido and i said guido they blind on you and the same god that told you you had a letter in your in your briefcase the other night at a temp meeting is telling you now there's a train coming for you guido and it's okay to get on and one year ago today that train came it's the kind of train that came and got sister meadows he's looking for passengers today and it's more than a song a long black train it's chariot i was asked this week sir with that condition in your body are you afraid to preach and he knew something about tumors in the brain he said those things could just bust and in a second you'd be dead and i looked at him and i said my congregation will know what to do and the angel that's standing right there this morning he knows what to do can you give me about five more minutes are you okay i'm probably gonna go somewhere and cry wow when all this is over because i've just seen myself in the book we've just how did you get here and you're sitting on the front row you're sitting on the front how did you get here five years ago you'd never put yourself here but it's god rich in mercy that knows exactly where to go get you he brings you and you go i don't know if i'll ever go back to that church again and then all of a sudden you go again and then you were sitting away back there and you came here in a skeleton crew and you were only people here that said here and i took chairs out and said it was one of the most supernatural events i've ever been a part of and here you're sitting in the very front row you didn't put yourself here god you didn't put yourself here neither one of you john pat you didn't put yourself here good bill this church started in your basement look around look around you probably didn't want no part of it look around brother joe look around brother joe's always had a statement i'm the most important person that a people will meet today because i can introduce them to god a god of eternal life [Applause] moses was ordained to walk up to pharaoh and say let my people go noah preached his last message god's going to destroy the world with water he's going to baptize this earth because it's like a new birth it's got to be washed you got to be baptized maybe he couldn't put it all together but he knew god helped him deconstruct this art and now he's gathered the animals in and listen this may be my last sermon but i'm going to preach it to you god's going to destroy the earth with water for the sins of they have committed and he walked inside and god shut the door and noah couldn't get back out and neither could he open it up i'd like to say this to to the world and whoever would say this sodom you can't stop the rapture washington d.c you can't stop this rapture they've shut the church down in switzerland and the church is down in france and the churches in ireland and the churches in england and they may try to shut them down in america because of covet again but let me just say you can't stop this rapture this will not keep till next week katie cassie

to where the devil can hear it rhonda ronaldo i didn't seal myself god sealed me and when he puts a seal on him he knows what's inside of it the seal represents ownership and we're still for a purpose not for the first exodus or the even the second but for our exodus our rapture we were more than just to fulfill satan in a church we were more than just to sit in a certain pew or have a certain family we were put here we stepped out of eternity to the dna of humanity and we have a lot of thoughts and failures that you look at and you see in the mirror and you feel and you struggle with oh help me preach now you struggle with your humanity you struggle with your thoughts you struggle with your opinions but god's not worried about the struggle with humanity he's got a seal with the predestinated seed of god and you're identified for rapture gabrielle the rapture or the missing of people cannot happen without you if you just caught that if you just caught that audience it can't happen without you something came to me a few moments ago while i was preaching you remember just not long ago you were having almost like a dream or a vision and you saw jesus standing looking out a window that house had to be built in a certain way and that wind is the most important window in that house and i've heard you say that when you go by that place it has a certain atmosphere to it well
