you're worried and there's a lot of situations but aren't we glad that we've got jesus amen boy i sure enjoyed last week with brother wayne [Applause] he is a powerful speaker and and we're just honored to be friends with him and his family and had miracles with them and we were preaching brother josh bennett's meeting together and evidently we got the devil mad and so amen i'm sure he stays mad at us then that awesome meal that we had afterwards uh amen i i sure hope you enjoyed that want to apologize to you i was just so sick that day i i i you know you ever thought about calling in but that day i felt like calling in and then went to the mill and i looked at wayne i said i'm leaving and i and i and we did and so i i trust in all of that you can you can have a little patience with me and amen god bless you maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to say lord would you just come by and remember me amen father you see all of our hands today we have a great need that you would sweep by our way and you're such a great god you hear and you answer our prayers now i ask you father that you see every hand now you're the kind of god that can go to each person and be so personal to them with the kind hand in the doctor's field they call it bedside manner but lord you're the kind of god that can be so personal that we know that it's you that's working and not some feeble man lord we're not looking to a man even today even as i stand here lord i i'm not standing here just to try to prove something it's because of you and lord i i trust you even this morning that you'll give me wisdom speak to our hearts something that's been laid heavily on my heart as the week has progressed i asked you that you would anoint us in a very supernatural way last night's service repentance i thought that was one of the greatest messages i ever heard on repentance right attitude the right atmosphere and lord every one of us have to repent every day brother branham said i have to check up every hour of the day lord god give us a spirit to where that we would have a willingness to repent a willingness to surrender ourselves to you touch your lord touch your children today sweep across this audience we are already aware of your presence here now bless your children in jesus name we ask you amen and amen and amen amen god bless you if you will turn with me to matthew chapter 5 and verse 13. amen matthew 5 and verse 13. amen amen amen amen hey man are you with me now jesus is standing and he's talking about us even here today you're the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost his savior wherewith shall it be salted it is sends forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under the foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill and cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they might see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven i'd like to for us to read that scripture together there if we can let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven you may be seated i had two such dreams this week that i would want to share and base this sermon on awesome job on that song one of the dreams was that another minister and myself we were together somewhere i just say this somewhere because i have no basis of of what it was it was just the theme of it i just don't know and we was asked to inspect a building and this building had no foundations the walls was leaning the floor was kind of it was kind of it was an unlevel it was it was waving people were wanting to live in that condition but they ask us is this a livable situation whether it was a church or whether it was a people we were instructed to tell them to tear it down to the ground and restart it and have a right foundation when i heard the sermon last night on repentance it reminded me of that dream sometimes you got to go back right back to the start or those little things that have crept into your life brother wayne spoke last week he said that door going open back and open back and open he said at night he said that one fly or that one mosquito in the room or maybe just multiples of them you hold the door open long enough sometimes it's kind of like that principle of of the strong man of the house the scripture tells us that one enemy will come back and he will see if if the the floor is garnished if you're filled with the holy ghost and if the strong man christ is not living inside of there he will return to the house but he brings seven worse there was a young man that left the message and he called me in a very abrupt conversation it was matter of fact it was so abrupt that i recorded the conversation because he made a life threat to me and so he told me he said i can control myself and i said let me just say this to you no human being without the holy ghost can control themselves men can make vows and men can make promises but humanity always disappoints us are you with me humanity will disappoint you that's why people can do so good for a certain spell of time and then all of a sudden they hit a bump and the devil will leave them for quite a spell but then he'll come back and then they'll just disappear it's because the enemy re-enters again and begins to charge their lives and takes them into chaos sin is a road that will take you further than you ever thought you ever people go a certain way and then they think i'll never go there i'll never go there brethren would make that statement he would say look at your life he said you're either tonight you're either going to be a better christian five years from now a pillar of the church or you could be in hell or a drunkard or all of these different things sometimes we we don't realize that we're charting a course we're chatting of course choices that are made and that's why repentance is so important never lose the value of of true repentance without true repentance there's no sealing of the holy ghost now you know i'm not faking another this week was i found myself going to a a huge never seen anything quite like it a huge building a huge place to where that i needed a token to get in and i had a it was a it was kind of a symbolic i had a token and there were people that were trying to get in but didn't have a token but i was standing there with a token and it seemed like that that connie and my family were taken to a different sort of gate but i was taken alone in a certain situation to this gate and i had a bag on my back it was kind of like a i don't know how to say it can i use the term hippie sack and and it seemed like the man at the gate was there he he looked at he called me by name and and i recognized him but i really didn't know him and he said ron what are you doing with that bag i said well i brought it with me and he said well here just pour it out here and i poured it out and he said there are burdens he said you've been carrying a lot of burdens in your life he said no you can't bring them here i went into the feast and i won't take time but i went into the feast and saw many loved ones there but i once i saw one sister that i led to the lord that she was deaf and dumb and she was just full of conversation telling me how much she loved me and how good it was to see me oh what a place that's going to be the scripture said out of the mouth of babes this week we had a situation happen in whitney and davie's home i'm gonna do the best of this i he says mom and dad does everyone have jesus in their heart and whitney says no baby they don't and they respond to him you must ask him to come into your heart and he said that's he said he says that's right he said the ones who have jesus in their hearts have lights around them and the ones that who don't they're dark i want to remind you just a moment he's three years old i want to think for a moment as i heard him i heard that conversation had been had and the week was progressing i i thought for a moment i saw him three years before he was ever born and through all the impossible odds he came on the earth and now you know now he's beginning to see this light as a small child i pray that's in every one of our homes not just for isaac but in every one of our homes that our children see there's a difference here i i we might want that for your children i i want that for your home listen this is a must-have this is more than just a message that we're associated with this message is christ and we came from god and we're going back to god now if i could just take these thoughts just for a quick summation we're being sealed for the journey this is our final preparation hours it's time to go it's time to go and i want to say some some things here to the today jesus would say in luke chapter 14. a certain man made a great suffer and made many and he sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bitten come all things are ready and they with one consent begin to make excuse the first said i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs to go and see it i pray that you have me excused another said i have five oxen and i must prove them i pray that you have me excused and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come so that servant and showed his lord these things that the master of the house being angry said into his servant go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor the man the hot and the blind and the servant said lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the lord said unto his servant go out into the highways and to the edges and compel them to come that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of these men which forbidden shall taste of my supper what a state this was not a preacher saying this this was god himself and listen there were many more qualified than us many more qualified than us that tasted of the great things maybe even of the message of the allah but came so close and walked away and jesus they had all their excuses and i'm going to say some blunt things here in just a moment but how close that we can come and miss it we can easily talk of the rich young ruler how many people has occupied pews i'm not just talking about here i'm not just talking about a single person or or a group of people that don't matter just believe the sign situation that happened about 10 years ago in the message where are those people at now when the folly of all of that nonsense fell apart and our lives are fell apart it's kind of like a feather tick pillow you throw it in the air and all of those those feathers go everywhere now to get it all back in the bag you it's impossible for you to get it all back in the back it's kind of like a rumor it's impossible to get it all back in the back genesis chapter 7 and verse 16. this is noah and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh and god commanded him and the lord shut him in and the flood was 40 days on the earth and the waters increased and bear up the ark and it was lift up above the earth i want you to just notice noah didn't shut the door many years ago in the 80s they began to preach that mercy was over i'm really glad that mercy was not over mercy is not in the feeble hands of any man it's not in the feeble hands of any man me and you still need mercy we still need healing we still need repentance jesus would use this quotation blessed is he who is not offended in me brother wayne touched it last week how close that we can come and miss it listen to brother branham he said i talked to my nephew a while a little catholic boy and said he said uncle bill i've run from pillar to post going everywhere trying to find something night after nothing before this meeting started he has been crying and at night time he's been dreaming dreams and coming in running up to the altar we're preaching and making confession that's that he's been wrong and i said melvin no matter where you try to go how many churches you join how many hail marys you say how many blessings that you get from man you've got to be born again notice how close he was to a prophet of god his uncle and he was missing what god had put before him in his life i'll live what about this message think deeply about it does this message offend you many times we want to argue with certain points of the message and this is something that have always i may have never said this from the pulpit but i always has been a backdrop of my ministry brother branham was fellowshipping with an angel brother branham was not just fellowshipping with men with the full gospel business men are powerful men brother branham had met an angel in a cave brother branham's ministry is going to fulfill malachi 4 5 and 6 and revelations 10 and luke 17. listen he is fellowshipping with an angel that watched creation come into existence watched adam and eve in the garden of eden watched every trial throughout the scriptures i will take brother branham's thoughts over any man that might gulge your hide just a little bit but you and i have not fellowshipped with that kind of fellowship and i want to say this to you brother branham recognized that that angel that picture that we most of us have hanging in our wall that that was the only supernatural photo of the pillar of fire that's ever been recorded in history we would have missed that had it not been a prophet said that's him we were lost in our denominational thinking and we needed to be washed we need to be washed and repent of our creeds and our dogmas and our and the things that we were taught are you with me the dress codes of the denominational systems we need to be washed of those things where you can have a preacher that's married four or five different times or smokes or drinks listen the holy ghost is more than just an emotion the holy ghost is life and we needed a prophet that exhibited not only the word and signs and wonders but the life [Applause] but brother ron haven't you noticed that brother branham made mistakes he was a human being we don't worship william branham i don't know if you've not been around here long enough but we don't worship the man william branham but we have incredible respect for him but if you turn that microscope on yourself [Applause] but don't you know he made mistakes here and there and here and there here and there why don't you turn that on your denominational preacher why don't you turn that on the leaders of the world [Applause] god had an intention to send this message to gather his attributes to prepare them for resurrection to prepare them for rapture to overcome this layout of sea and age listen not just to come not just to survive not just to walk through it but to overcome it [Applause] in many places brother branham would compare it to like a railroad boxcar we've got people here brother denny actually brought me a seal i hope that was okay it's a seal i used to use those seals when i was working at a certain spot and and he said he said after it's all packed in that box car he said it and they closed that door and put the seal on it it's sealed for its destination and the railroad companies would put you in the penitentiary for a lifetime if you break that seal it cannot be broken it's sealed to its destination we are going to be sealed to our destination and he said not just everybody on the track can just open it up and look at it and examine and looking over and throw things in or out you can't do that no sir no sir he said now another place he said that inspector he came through and he he shook it and he went through and if he could see anything that was loose now i'm preaching to you if there's anything loose he would condemn it that's what's the matter that's what the matter with the inspector is going tonight it's going by our light of our lives and the reason we don't get the holy ghost we might carry on and act like we've got it but the fruits by your fruits you're known that's how you're known and he shakes it to find out that there's any loose places of unbelief a little loose place over here a loose place over here and he condemns it and sets it back again it's got to be packed right now like that sermon last night i'm not just saying this because andrew preached it my son but i thought it was priest in the right attitude not down to you or not being overbearing but it was a great sermon this is our opportunity to get things right not after we die and i don't care i don't care if your last name's branham no disrespect there but you got to be born again you're going to face god and i don't want to face an angry god that boxcar has got to go over some rough roads when you become a christian there's some some really tough things that you're going to have to go through there's some really tough things that you're going to go through if you don't have him there's going to be times on your road that you're going to feel like giving up i had a lot of texts sent to me this week but there was a text that was sent to me this week that said brother ron i'd some point i'd like to have a dinner with you he was he was away from here he said i'd like to have a dinner with you he said he said i'd rather have a dinner with you than any superstar athlete or the president he said because your life has been such an example of jesus christ i thought oh god help me help me that i never disappoint one person i pray that they can see jesus christ may that be your testimony today someone asked me are you going to preach this weekend i said yeah i'm going to tell the world i'm still alive [Applause] jesus turns to simon is it simon i prayed for you that thy faith fail thee not he said because satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that faith failed not and when thou art converted i want you to just notice simon had been one of the lead disciples and i want to say something here you could be one of the leaders in this church and if you don't have jesus satan's going to sift you like wheat he's going to flip your world upside down and no doubt you'll deny him thrice but jesus prayed for you and if you can ever come to a conversion if you can ever come to a conversion to work you quit arguing well i don't know where brother brandon was right or not or i i don't know if this church is right or not if you ever become convinced are you with me i'm going to preach to every one of you you ever become convinced this message has got rapture in it it's got resurrection in it it's got overcoming power in it it's got how to raise your family how to raise your children how to raise above the nightmares of life it's got the sealing power inside of you satan's tried every scheme that he can to destroy it he's tried every rumor that he can to destroy he'll do that to you too but there's a seal of the keeping power on the inside of you where god seals you for your journey not just from camp meeting to camp meetings or trial to try help me preach but for your journey i'm not here just for tomorrow i'm not here just for next week i'm here to the rapture [Applause] and as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord i am committed i'm not turning back i'll never never never never go back there's nothing to go back to [Applause] it's a powerful scripture and it's only just a few words remember lot's wife i've preached a lot of conventions in my life i trust i've had an impact i really do this stage in my journey i trust i've had an impact i trust i will continue to have an impact but now i want you to hear these words and i want you to hear them real clear i want the internet to hear this clear do we want to stop and think about the tragedy of being left behind do we want to stop and think about the tragedy of being left behind things that we couldn't let go weights that bound us to the world jesus told he gave a sermon about excuses i don't want to fulfill that part i don't mind being part of that compelled to come unqualified horrible past of life but yet god rich in mercy reach down and grab the hold of me and i could be an inspiration stand with this message but i don't want to be a part of those that bought land or bought oxen or married somebody i don't want an excuse how many people have excuses about just not coming to church oh brother ron i believe that really really i believe what you're preaching i've been watching it on the internet i believe what you're preaching one of these days i'm going to get in church really it's one thing to tell me your excuses and it's another thing to come when this building is empty buildings all across the message are empty and there's no generals to preach to you because god confirmed his word i'm screaming like noah out the door of the ark i cannot imagine the compassion as noah's watching the animals come he didn't make that happen he didn't have the ability to make that happen only god can make two of every kind gather themselves to the ark he he just did his work and he preached every day he did his work and he preached every day 120 years that's what i've been doing here for about 22 years i've been standing faithful in this pulpit [Applause] i preach with this same kind of passion since 1984. let me just say this to you but there will come a time when our lips will be closed noah did all he could noah did at all listen we cannot in our frame of humanity produce a body change but we can believe a message with everything that's within us and let that message you eat the book you eat christ what does that mean you hear people in their conversation they're so politically charged because they're eating fox news or cnn they're reading their books let me just tell you about political books they're full of demons they'll still be going on in the tribulation period and they won't even know that the rapture took place denominations will still be having their churches they'll be moving right on saying how bad the world is how bad abortion is how bad the gas rates are how bad russia is how bad all of these things are and they've slipped right into the tribulation period because somewhere they made a choice we're not going to listen and we're going to crucify that message that has come because it discredited our our denomination and our preachers and our creeds and our dogmas you know sometimes i know the preacher comes down your alley and all of a sudden calls you out it's then that you can repent or it's then you can hold on to it and get mad and get an attitude i don't have it in front of me this moment but it was an angel of god that nudged the prodigal son to go home that's what brother brahm said nudged him to go home it wasn't you that got yourself in church matt it's your name matt tyler tyler don't get discouraged i probably won't remember tomorrow but this morning something told me to go over to your dad's vehicle and i walked over and i spent some time with them then you came over you said some really nice things to me and as you were saying some really nice things you you expressed the desire of your heart that you wanted to know christ and i felt him whirl standing right there in that parking lot i felt him whirl and when i felt him world we begin to pray and the presence of god whether you know it or not an hour before church there was a boy right here that's sitting here with us could you just stand just now is it okay and god met him in the parking lot he'll meet you he's after you [Applause] you didn't bring yourself you don't hold yourself it's him that's holding on to you thank you five wise invite foolish virgins i want to identify myself as wise brother on one day what about today what about today what about this moment what brought you back to church sister janetta you didn't bring yourself back oh god you're here what brought you here god brought you here whether you sat in the front or where are you setting it back the same god that's standing on this pulpit with me now knows how to go to where you're at and to your situation he knows exactly what's going on in your life elizabeth he cares he cares about your situation he cares it's not the temporary moment he cares about the eternal part of you that flesh part that spirit part that you battle with but that seal that's the that's so part the devil can wrestle with your flesh don't he roger he can wrestle with your spirit and cause you to become depressed he can cause you to have anxiety and i don't care how long you've been a christian but that spirit can come but if he is sealed on the inside of you now god is not the kind of businessman that puts a seal on you and then takes it off puts a seal on you and takes it off well i feel like a christian today well he put a seal on you well i don't feel too much like a christian i almost feel backslid it's not a based on your feelings this isn't based on your feelings whether you're screaming through nineveh or you're in the belly of a whale god's got you in his hands and i stand here and preach this morning with that thought in mind whatever is happening in my body god's still a healer [Applause] and i'm finished finished you can keep standing tuesday morning what i experienced i couldn't do nothing about all i knew was i felt like i was going to sleep and matthew was working feverishly to keep me awake i stand with consolation today that i had no fear because i've been sealed for the journey and i want that same i want that same thing for every person in this building yes this is not about me and it's not about your neighbor it's about you it's about you and maybe you just say brother ron would you just pray for me this morning just pray for me to pray for me i want this to be more than a sermon a few thoughts that are pulled together [Music] what about you first excuses that you've had in your life but my family or my friends or others around me why don't you just come to a spot that it's me and jesus it's me and jesus it's not me and cousins it's me and jesus me and this message me in this life
