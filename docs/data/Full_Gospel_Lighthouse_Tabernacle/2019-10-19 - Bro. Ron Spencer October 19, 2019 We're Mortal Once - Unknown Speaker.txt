========================================

till tonight so I'm going to I'm going to deliver this sermon we're mortal once we're mortal once a man James 14 and 4 for 14 and I want to read that scripture just before I sorry I threw you a curveball but it's one Scripture but I want you to go to job 14 James 4:14 is a favorite scripture of brother homers and you heard him quote it for so many times for those that were here whereas you know that not now know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little while a little time and then vanish it away but there Homer would use this statement it's like the vapor overtop of a teapot joke 14 in verse 1 now this only applies to if you're born of a woman so that gets us all a man that is born of a woman it's a few days notice these next words and full of trouble he that cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continue with naught and that's not thou dust thou open Dyne eyes upon such a one and bring us me into judgment with thee who can bring a clean pounding out of an unclean thing not one see if these days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass turn from him that he might rest Teli he shall accomplish as a Highland his day for there is a hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again that the tender branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and stop there of dying the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud bring forth browse like a plant but man diet and wasted the way yeh man giveth up the ghost and where is he jobs having a conversation about his own mortality with God as the waters fail from the sea and the flood decay ahthe and dry it up so man laugh down and rise with not till heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep or that uh that thou wood has hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me in secret until they wrath be passed that thou wouldest anoint me set a time and remember me if a man die shall he live again all of the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come thou shalt call and I will answer thee that will have a desire to work of nine hands you may be seated this afternoon quite a question wasn't it job is the oldest writings of the of the entire Bible and as a man he realized he was under the Adamic curse because they'd eaten offered the Tree of Life and it looked like to the human element man dies he wastes us the way you know even if you live to be nine hundred years old at that time there came a stage of old age and that age becomes golden it becomes very inconvenient it comes a time in your life to where your life is not out in the world so much until it's kind of it's kind of if we could say it institutional lives even their own homes it's around a kitchen a living room a bathroom and a place to sleep and you don't go very far from the bathroom are you with me now I think about people that have great great houses and great great places that they live in but at the end of the time if we come to a place like a nursing home we've only got a cubicle traitor of our life is Ronald Reagan was quite a precedent going to get into politics but he was he was a well renowned president but we came to the end of his life his last 10 years he lived and in a in a fog we would know that fog is all hi MERS and to which that he still thought he was a president and put on his suit every day and they they had an oval office in his home to which he went in and worked every day it was very private it was very it was very hidden from the world the family knew but the world didn't know but he was coming to the end of his life whatever it was he was coming to the end of his life Jesus would be the only one that could stand in two dimensions at the same time if we might say that he God became flesh or he with me now God became flesh and brother branham said Jesus was either God or his new greatest deceivers that there ever was Jesus was standing there with his disciples and he made this phenomenal statement he said let not your heart be troubled we use it as a funeral text many times let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also brother Branham would say that's not a place of brick and mortar in stones it's another body hallelujah are you with me now Jesus took those up on the mountain and then we said the disciples came unto Him and he opened his mouth and and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God verse 13 year the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost his Savior wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under the foot of men you're the light of the world a city that is set on a hill which cannot be hid neither do a man light a candle in and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they might see your good works and glorify the father which is in heaven the men would use this term he said you're reflecting your inheritance you're reflecting where you came from your life here is reflecting another world when I walk into McDonald's and I seen green hair and all different kind of I realize they're reflecting where they come from and where they're going and I also realize that this is not the hour of judgment this is the hour of light and so your presence will will maybe be a testimony to them and it may be the only witness or sermon they'll ever hear are you with me so brother madam said God produces kind after kind cow produces cattle horses produce horses camels produce camels but if God's going to give birth he produced his sons and daughters of God so Jesus would say I came from God and I'm going back to God and if we were in him that's our same origin and that's our same destination so we was predestinated to life from before the foundation of the world so God not only knew our beginning and our mortality but he also knew our end I would use this statement our future is clear I like that our future is clear now we came into this earth and we're born were born of woman so we come through the womb of a woman and I don't want to go into the birthing of it but I want you to understand the mother carries the egg the father carries the sperm which is the blood of life and brother Brandon would say in 100 million things that are to be future home he would go the last five sermons he would talk about the gene seed of God and he would begin to talk about the groaning of our birth birth pains will be a sermon that he'll speak on that even Jeremiah would talk about that he knew me before I was even formed in the belly God knew me David we'll talk about that God knew him before the foundation even when I was in secret the scripture talked about but our mother will will begin to carry life and will get excited about she's carrying life and then that life will will come to a place to where it's ready to be born but in that secure world where that baby is born it don't wanna leave mama's womb serves the process of dropping to a spot and you'll hear sisters ghost she's dropped she's dropped you women to pay more attention to those girls with that situation than I do I don't know what they're talking about she's dropped it's gonna happen in a couple of days I know that about cattle so I and but what is happening that maybe has come to a spot to where it's going to be forced from the womb are you with me now now you don't know anything about being in there neither do you know anything about being in the mind of God but how did you know your name your mother and father told you your name and you believed them how did you know you came from God God told you and we believe him Galileo and we were forced from our mother's womb now that's the beginning of mortal life but on the other end of it we'll be forced and they'll be groaning that takes place from this realm to go to that room are you with me now I don't know about you but I have a deep desire to go there I have a deep longing to go there that's my goal I've never been there but it's become such a reality so whatever time on my earth this days it is about being there those words are important Jesus would say this because he being God in flesh I am the resurrection and life what a statement I am the bread of life I am my father are one he would come to a spot to where he would say I have finished the work thirty three and a half years what a space of time only a condensed space of time but in the space of that time it had such a strain and such a stress on that mortal piece of clay until he looked like a man past fifty why because he had the sin of the whole world the strain of all humanity was on him and if he doesn't complete or accomplish the work we're lost and yet he has to be put under every temptation that man can face every strain of devil that man can face and he has to overcome at all now the scripture says that he would he would tell and I didn't look to something forgive me but he would tell especially a lady that washes his feet go send no more in that moment in that moment of that conversation with the Messiah and that woman she was changed from a prostitute are you remember that's how she got the money to come what wash his feet under the Old Testament she would have just repeated the process but under the Messiahship when he speaks to her he speaks the life to her go and sin no more that Dominion has no more dominion over you anymore come on Church because he was the breath of life he was the expression of God said another piece of clay and thousands even millions saw him in the flesh but missed who he was how many people miss who you are would you just think about this it be a prophet that would tell us that you're one in a million and then he would begin to describe to you that 999,000 that being one in a million all of those other seeds die they die jubilee happens because once it comes to life but that nine nine nine nine nine nine nine whatever perish no fear Ross nobody cries no weeping but those are rejoicing for the one don't you just think about this brother Brandon would use a term I'm trying to be cautious brother Brandon would use a term how that God watched over our seed he preserved it even since Adam he would use the term called that we were pre-planned of God he would say that we're the living physical attributes of God that he thought of before the foundation of the world God watched over that so he knew we were coming and like a father and mother they prepare a room God prepared for you he's also preparing for you lay a great wedding supper there won't be one extra seat but I'd like to just take just a negative side here just for a moment brother Branham called all humanity flesh the unredeemable flesh fodder that's a pretty difficult statement but it's just the reality for me dearly described grace to you you've got to realize there's a lot of lost let me just give you a couple of facts in the last hundred years in the Battle of war a hundred and eight million soldiers have given their life in the last hundred years that's a lot of people it's estimated that 1 billion people have give their life due to Wars since Adam it's a lot of father I made the statement in Switzerland a few years ago and brother gido was sitting he was sitting there and I turned to brother G do and I said get oh I don't know your history about 400 people I said brother gido I don't know your history but when your grandfather was at war he said I know my grandfather was at war he said I didn't know that my parent my grandfather was at war no doubt he'll watch the service but he said I didn't know he said but when you said it that God watched over my natural seed while your grandfather was at war he said that became alive to me he said my grandfather must have been at war and he said God watched over him and not a bullet could destroy his life because he was carrying G those seed of life and about a month or two brother Dino sent me a picture and it was in an envelope he sent me a picture here's my grandfather that was carrying my seed of life I would say many of us sitting here tonight whether it was the American Revolution or the Civil War or the wars that we fought of late our fathers was carrying our life they can tell where you came from by your DNA markers they can tell whose Kenda who by the DNA markers they've got it down but that's not a new thing for God that's not a new thing for God God knows all the way back to the beginning and he knows your time of life I want you to listen brother Branham census we're all they going to be mortal watts what a statement this is this is the last time for all eternity will ever be mortal this may be the last night that will ever be mortal tomorrow we may be immortal so let's do what we can for mortal beings while we're mortal and can help them let's work while it's called day from night cometh when no man can work God doesn't forget his children he swore by himself he said he said oh I just can't go on satisfied I mustn't go by myself these hands will only be mortal once these lips will only be mortal watch the scripture said the grave can't praise Him [Music] my brother my sister you will only be mortal once he said you don't know how I I would like to take time take every man here and go eat with you sit down and talk with you talk about heaven about Jesus I would love to do that time won't permit it but I'll make an appointment with you when we step out of time into eternity I want a thousand years with each one of you and when I get through I'll have no less time than what I did to begin with are you listening I get badgered a little bit by my close friends when we're preaching conventions and I've made this statement before I made it here oh how I'd like to come to your house and maybe drink your coffee set on your porch and eat your chocolates and the next day at the service will be a box of chocolates but one day we'll be in a round to where we can make that appointment and spend a thousand years together you ever been around somebody that after five minutes there's nothing more to say you can help me preach after an hour two hours some people never run out of words yes just just continue to go on and on and on not necessary I'm still listening that's where you fix your car I was together with a special friend the other day and someone was sharing their life story with them but I could tell he wasn't clicked in so after we were gone and that was all over with I just asked him I said where did you click out and he said well when they got to a place it was no longer fruitful I just decided I would try to figure out what I was preaching tomorrow well now you know some of our secrets and when we get through it we'll have no less time than when I did when I began but now it's night and it's the day of man daylight comes the day of the Lord now we must labor I can't be a servant of man and a servant of God at the same time I must serve God so I can win men to his creator God so that we can keep that appointment I read that quote because we must keep that appointment many times we we think oh well I'll break the appointment at the dentist or I'll break the appointment at the at the veterinarian clinic I'll break that appointment one appointment you keep brother and says we want everything just just everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy life wasn't intended to be easy life is a struggle anything that's got life and it is struggling look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get some kind of a system that takes it easy and we're wrong I get to clean a chimney for a man that was at one time the vice president of the Radford Army Ammunition Plant and I when I would go I went there for years I think I went there 15 years to its place every year he was he was in the bed through the years who you build up relationships I don't know if it was the last year of the year before that I asked him a question I said how did you get here because I knew that he was a vice president of the company and he's a well looked up to man they said how did you get up to here and he said I'll tell you what happened when I retired I give up he said I thought my life is over and he said I'd go and set my car but I had nowhere to go and after a while I got tired of sitting in my car and he said I just stated Beth that's not even existence you got a struggle to keep your life I don't like a treadmill but I have excited that it's changed my life I don't know if it'll add a day or an hour or a week I don't know anything about that all I know is there's a time for me but this life I must try to keep myself in as good a shape because I'm responsible to this body I love Krispy Kreme Doughnuts I love the things I love sweets I love it as much as anybody else but I know that that thing can destroy me so I'm responsible for that which I take in somebody help me preach I don't need no anonymous to tell me don't eat that or don't eat that let me just say that's the rules of life are you with me now my brother on I can't walk walk a hundred yards somewhere another you can walk 200 yards somewhere another walk 300 yards someone come on there's paralytic said decided I'm going to stand up and after a while they stood up they were determined I'm not is this okay I was in a home of a man and I know I mind on the live but this may help somebody I sent a home of a man I weighed over 500 pounds and his computer he had everything laying right in front of me I said what got you here he said easy have you changed your way of habit no I continue eat what I eat but he can't get out of that I said how do you get your food they they bring it to me I said stop you're not doing this man any favors what about our spiritual diet what about our children what they / take off we're enablers in this day if we're not careful we're an apple the wrong kind of diet it's a struggle well I'm just going to give up I'm just going to quit I'm just gonna sit down here and quit Oh what goods that gonna do you eventually somebody's going to have to take care of you because you're going to meet an appointed time you've got to fight for life don't get mad at me I'm preaching you something that's God laid on my heart you can lay down and die and quit and fold your hands or you can have all the nurses and the doctors and the medicines in the world but if you're not determined don't tell me I'm a man that was on eight different kinds of blood pressure medicines I'm a man that had two two maybe three heart attacks two different strokes one stroke lady in a hospital for eight days and couldn't stand the light of day I could quit I could say I'm gonna I'm gonna take it easy well I grew up beside of a man when I was when I was turning about 20 years old he was retiring and they said he was a serious man that ever worked said he didn't want to stress his heart said he really didn't want to do anything heavy because he didn't want stress his heart well you know time tells you a lot of stories that man that minun died at 95 years old with a good heart so he did not go worried about his heart but instead of enjoying life somebody help me preach he was afraid to mow his own yard because he was you know I sometimes take that way about people sitting in church you thought I would leave that alone the crossed arms and said let somebody a man the same man let somebody else worship the Lord that's somebody else saying let somebody else pay their tithe like somebody else do the things this is not a spectator sport [Applause] hallelujah you have to fight through Laodicea and you could just succumb to the idea of sloppy easy living or us me and just an entertainment gospel but that's not over commerce of this bright edge we must have determination and a will to do the Father's will to destroy the works of the devil brother Bram said you're only mortal once and that one time is the only time that you're going to be mortal and this may be the time that you've got to make your decision you're either going to move up with God or stay where you're at brother Branham says this he said this'll Worth Lita burn out go here you know what it is this body is like an old coat that you wear a coat that you want swear but now you have one that is so much better you don't use it anymore what do you do you hang it in a closet for you've got a better one you got a you got a better coat it's more up today than the one you used to wear that's worn out what it is that it is that garment and you are inside of that there that garment only done what it bore your image you won't need that no more you've hung it up and it's a rag that's the way this old body is I know a lot of us prep it and take care of it you better there's only one you got are you waiting I saw sign the other day if I knew I was gonna live this long and took better care of myself it's the only one you got and that's the way this body is it's more the image of the heavenly yes it is not you you're the inside of that body the Spirit of God is only inside of that body and that's what makes the outside come into subjection because the inside is pulling it bringing into the line of the word it's you're inside you're inside your being this body is just an old coat and someday what would you do with it for you as the garment for a while that is like this earthly garment this body your real body your real self is on the inside of this old goat brother haven't said you've never seen me and I've never seen you I don't care what kind of walls I better not go there someday I will hang in the Earth's Hall of memory of you that's quite a statement someday it'll hang in Earth's Hall of memory of you you'll put it out yonder in a grave and someday we'll be put a stone up said here lies Reverend so-and-so or John so and so or so and so and so and so it'll I there as a memorial of you the people just seeing you in this what you was your real you what was on the inside of that but that old code itself just bore the image of the heavenly old people have you major restoration to change your coat have you made reservations for heaven remember you must have reverent reservations you can't get in without them he said I'm talking in modern language now that you know if you go to a hotel you have to have reservations so did you have reservations well I'm sorry everything is filled up you're the old coat because you failed to make reservations there's nothing more disappointing in preaching a sermon in a funeral to where people have made reservations that funerals not the time to judge it's the time to comfort it's the time to give hope but you can't do one think about the person in the casket Ecclesiastes chapter 9 and verse 4 says a living dog a living dog it's better than a dead lion let's go on statement a living dog is better than a dead lion said life is a precious thing in its humblest form it's greater than tell it is better to be least in the kingdom then greatest outside of it hey I want to just nail some things tonight I'm home I'm gonna nail some things it is better to be the least in the kingdom then the greatest outside of it are you with me you young girls and young boys to sing God thinks more of your talent then Lady gaga I was in a conversation here while back and they was talking about this person actually it wasn't long ago just a few days ago you can go back and listen this whole thirteen-year-old girl walks up and she literally blows the congregation away with her incredible god-given talent and there were some statements that was made set off a talent scout would get a hold of that and I said a talent scout would send her to hell that might seem horrible but let me just say this you it'll put you on a path it'll put you on a path that'll take you the wrong way Oh wasn't that great that that person won American Idol erm oneness or why not no I'll tell you that's the greatest detriment that just happened to that individual they've just signed a contract with Satan himself I just prayed for a young man that said I have an opportunity to go pearl I said really he said I can go pearl in baseball he said what should I do I said you're asking the wrong one I'm looking for soldiers in the kingdom of God that inherit eternal life that's what I'm recruiting for I'm actually a recruiting agent for men that want to serve God for eternity I look a little things a little differently I'm sorry sometimes you see stars and their wife it's just a trophy bride then they've got a monstrous house and maybe a 40 million dollar mansion but if I could ask you what the scripture says what is the end of it brother Branham said there were two men brothers what was gen one was John is it one lived beside the tracks the other lived in Chicago and he was quite a banker he was quite a top civilized man who had a great education he become the president of the bank and this one went up to see him and when he got there his wife wasn't home and he said they were standing at the front door and he was showing him everything that he owned his monstrous house and he was showing me and he said if you stand right here you can see the top of the bank where I'm the president and he said this is what all I owned and after a little while his wife walked in and she'd been out at a party all night long and she was dressed like she'd been at a party and she walks in he thought about his own wife and children at home he couldn't hardly feed him his wife was trustworthy she was a real lady probably didn't have a new new dress in her whole closet nobody listening to brother I'm tell this story and he's telling him about all that he owned when he came down to the end his brother I asked him how much do you own up there a living dog is greater than a dead lion the thief on the cross as he was breathing was greater than Caesar come on what would you give in exchange for yourself I think about many years ago many years ago I was in a meeting and a young man he said I could go and make more money in a week or two and I could make in a year here but I have to be away from home and they live a completely different lifestyle I just simply asked him why are you asking me the question actually your brother-in-law was standing beside of me Paulo Fontaine when I answered this young man's question we're out so our wheel in God's will but to me it's no match to me it's no match you gain the whole world and you've lost yourself what do you have Homer would say no new house behind hearses a man remarked one time he said if he knew that he had 30 years of life before him it would not be an unwise thing to spend 20 years of those years of the thirty mapping out a plan of living and putting himself under rule for what he could do with ten years well arranged then thirty years spent haphazardly a man will do little by himself if that life isn't channeled by God I found this last weekend or actually three weeks ago and it's just kept resounding back to me and I want to share this with you Spurgeon shares this he says there are hounds up on the track of every thief murderer liar in foot upon every center of every time each sin leaves a trail the dogs of judgment will be sure to sin it out and find their prey there is no disentangling yourselves from the meshes of guilt no possibility of evading the penalty of transgressions very wonderful have been the ways in which persons who have committed crimes and have been brought to judgment a trifle becomes the telltale the method of deceit gives a clue of the manner of discovery wretched the men who bury their secrets in their own bosoms their own conscious plays traitor to them your sins will find you out we have rhythm thread of men taking their sleep to their fellows and babbling in their dreams the crime that they committed years before God would have this secret disclosed no I have seen neither could other tongue have been bold but the man turned Kings evidence against him selves he has thus brought himself to judgment listen only the blood of Jesus Christ can we men sense are you with me Spurgeon said do i address anyone who is now practicing a secret sin you would not have me to point you out for the whole world to see nor do I believe me that sin is no can I read that to you again Spurgeon is preaching to 12,000 people at his auditorium metropolitan auditorium and he's just made new statements before and he said do I address anyone who is now practicing secret sin and he was not a prophet like brother Branham but brother Branham could stand arrow in the prayer lines and see your entire life brother Bisco said I was sitting on the log and he said he was less though he was looking right straight through me you know and you've had special moments in time where God became so real you knew you couldn't hide anything I'd like to say this to you deal with it now said you would not have me to point out you out to the whole world nobody nobody wants to be shamed or blamed nobody wants to be and we don't want to do that we don't do that but you know can I say that you know and he said believe me the sin is known all right with me I knew you wouldn't be shouting tonight but Grant said you might have to make your decision tonight if it is I pray that you'll throw everything you'll throw everything loose remember I don't care what it is if it's a job if it's a family if it's loved ones if it's associates if it's your partners whoever it is turn loose of everything even that he that puts his hand to the plow and turns to look back is not worthy of the plowing lay aside every weight and the sin was just so easily beset you what is it lay aside every weight the unbelief that does so easily beset you and run this race with the patience that is set before you nobody else can run for you nobody else could take your place you can't take Billy Graham's place Billy Graham can't take your place choosing of a bride brother Brennan says in many things of life were given a choice the way of life itself is a choice we have a right to make our own way choose your own way that we want to live education is a choice we can choose whether we're going to be educated or whether we're not going to be educated that's a choice that we have right and wrong is a choice every man every woman every boring girl has to choose whether they're going to try to live right or not live right choice is a great thing your eternal destination is a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of of where you'll spend eternity this is coming from season of a bride he said before the service ends tonight there will be one time that if you turn God turn down turn God down many times there will be one time that you'll turn him down the last time all brother run but I got dealt with me but I escaped it and he may never do again he said there is a line between mercy and judgment Billy Andrews stood in his pulpit many years ago and he said was preaching in the tenth meeting and he was coming down and he was preaching and it was preaching and he came down to the altar call and he started counting ten nine eight and two kids teenagers that were dating two kids got up and was very irreverent and they walked out the tent and he said it's her last time I'm pleading with you come to God I'm only telling the story help me and they laughed anything as a matter of fact one of the Deacons went to those children and those people said he's calling you it may be your last time and they laughed at him and they went down the road less than five miles and they missed a stop sign and ran and took cliff and it was 54 inches from the front bumper to the back bumper for mortal once I set in the restaurant but the Mike Price and myself a set in the restaurant and the man said he was there when Elvis Presley said in that and he pointed at a at a corner said he said in that corner right over there and play music and said there'd be a lot of people come to play music with him and they would dance and he would sit there as a boy I was sitting in that restaurant know Elvis Presley only a memory and in the dimension where he's at there's no mercy but you remember there were three preachers that dealt with him before he died and he told all three of them I sold my birthright for popularity and money and women he told them all those three things and I can't get back to God what a place I don't want to be on that I don't know who I'm reaching after tonight but gods in a business whether on I've been 40 years serving Lord I do it with all my mind you're not the fish I'm trying to catch tonight are you with me but I want you young people even older people to realize every service give it everything you've got never never say new koch god gave us a cure for sin but men taffert tampered with it change the mode of baptism took away the deity of jesus christ who he really was they took an experience of God and made it a hand shaker put your name on a book earth become a part of our society come a part of our work you must be born again I was writing these notes down this week and I thought about what heaven to breed you gave me a CD just a moment ago and I looked down and it it caught my eye let me just say this to you in heaven there will not be one adulterer not one in heaven there will not be one murderer and you can make out your own list because I'm not going to give the list there not be one there that will be none of them there alone my brother Billy Andrews others have said it Henry Greene would say it I repeat it now one Bob's head woman there said because of what heaven is it's not this earth that's heaven there will be one rock-and-roll party their country stars won't be recognized there I know a lot of us we get a certain idea of who's great who's not great I'll tell you what what man costs Greg black calls foolish [Applause] brother branham had an experience that was beyond the curtain of time do you mind if I just take the time to read this adjust he just breaks in I'm just gonna break into the vision or actually translation he says I was watching and every one of those women coming up and hugging me saying all precious brother we're so glad to see you and I thought everyone dressed just a little like but they had their hair you know red hair black hair blond hair they was coming by and they was all young and when she got to me I thought I'm just gonna see what she says and she looked at me and she said our precious brother she hugged me and we just went on and other woman who came and hugged me next heard noise I I looked over this way and Here Come another bunch of men young young fellows all in the age about 20 they had dark hair blonde hair they all had white robes on barefooted and they run to me and begin to hugging me and hollering precious brother and I thought and I turned back around and there I was still laying there and I thought this is strange just then a voice was talking to me and I never did see it the voice it said you have been gathered you have been gathered to your people and and and then some man picked me up set me up this way in a big high thing like this I said why did you do that in Earth he was a leader I said I I don't understand this and the voice was talking to me I I never could see the voice now it was just above me it was talking to me I said well if I had passed on I want to see Jesus he was so he was all my life and I want to see him and so he said you can't see him now he is a little higher you see it was just below the altar the sixth place where men go not the seventh where God is in that set to mention it was a six and they were they were all there and they were passing by and look like they were just actually millions of them I never seen them and I sit there and these women and men running by and hugging me calling me brother I sit there and that voice said you have been gathered to your people like Jacob was gathered to his people I said all these my people are they all branham's know they're your converts to Christ and I looked around and there were real pretty woman ran up and she just about about the same and she threw her arm around me she said oh my precious brother she looked at me and she said my she looked like an angel and she passed by and the voice said didn't you recognize her no I didn't recognize her you let her to Christ when she was past 90 you know why she thanks so much of you that pretty girl was past 90 you're talking about laying off an old coat yeah that pretty girl was past 90 listen up brother branham is he even that pretty girl was past 90 yeah she can never change no more now I got a lot of thoughts right here not a lot of thoughts one of those thoughts is I've got more to go to heaven for then I had yesterday I think the sister Benton just now she's just on this dimension breathe in her last breaths maybe even tonight maybe already gone since service started breathing her last breaths she's no more conscious she's done past that stage of consciousness but it's not over and the man that sang in this pulpit for years and years and decades I just want to be a blessing I just want to be a blessing if he would send it in some games maybe you even thought will he ever quit singing that song and somebody would get happy about it and and he and he'd start and he'd go and he'd sing it again and and if somebody else got blessed he'd sing it again and maybe some of you were born others were made happy and he told his wife just two days ago he said it won't be long now and I won't be far behind why we've heard about a dimension where an 80 year old woman steps into a new body even brother Branham couldn't recognize the woman that he led to Christ just only just only a matter of time ago and now it's hand even realized who she was oh brother on but that's brother branham story well let's just take the scripture two men on the road to Emmaus and they walk with Jesus for six hours and can't recognize him I say many times people have come to this church and sit in these pews and wind through service and maybe you thought it was almost like rapture and they went I didn't get nothing out of it it depends on which Dominion you're feeding from sister Carol Kinser been a freshest friend of our family for many many years Sammy and I started out ministering together and he preached a phenomenal preacher about 60 years old he goes up gets into tree stands with these grandsons and he gets in the tree stand but today would be his last day it's a very hard thing on his grandchildren they didn't know it was his last day you know sometimes we just don't know sometimes we have an idea sometimes we don't know one morning I got up and the Lord spoke to me said it's time to go to brother Steve's bedside today's the last conversation you'll have you don't know what it felt like to drive down that driveway and I knew the few moments that I would have with him would be our last you're talking about making it effective he sat there but the Jeff I'm sure you can remember this he sat there and he said remember that vision you had about 20-30 years ago of me and I said yes Steve he said remember I got there first I was walking down the road with Thomas and a man named Jim and a man named Dan Dyer Jim you don't my real men and I'm walking down the road and we come to a spot and there stands Steve and he's stand-in there and he said I'd like to give you some angel food heavenly manna I was setting talking to him in a wheelchair and I was thinking about many years ago way before I was ever a pastor here God told me that we would meet an eternity and he also told me in that vision whether I even recognized or not he would beat me there and now I'm having a conversation with him about a vision that I had almost 30 years before you talking about blending of time and eternity Steve and I converse ated for a bit and they were setting up the bed and you remember they were setting up the bed in there in the room setting up the bed and he he just knew his time was close it time was at hand listen they'd listen to brother branham and sermons all through the night he's believer and remember we we took the video of brother Homer preaching his memorial service while he was in Fontaine we got him dressed up and combed his hair he forgot to put his teeth in if you remember he preached about about 12 minutes if I have it right and do you have that do you guys have that okay make sure you have that below Mr preached and he said may during this service something supernatural happened because Steve was a believer you may think I'm out on a limb but we're only mortal once we're only more to watch and while andrew was preaching here and he was preaching the pillar of fire came across your flower sister Judy and the bulbs just opened up I love it here with me now your last breath here is the first one there I'd say we're winners I thought all my brother Ben says oh my and I was afraid of this why these people are real they wasn't going anywhere they wasn't tired of being there why can't I see Jesus well well now he will come someday and he'll come to you first and then you'll be judged and these people are your converts that you have led you mean by being a leader that he'll judge me yes does every leader have to be judged like that yes what about Paul he'll have to be judged with his well if if his group goes in so will mine I'm just about done now cuz I preached exactly the same word and that's it where he baptized in Jesus name I did too and millions screamed out all at once said we're resting on that I'd like to say I'm standing here tonight and being mortal once I want to preach as long as God gives me strength and let me just bring a couple of thoughts together to finish this I don't want to do it haphazardly I don't want to come to church just for the thing to do what's a good thing to be thought of I want to give my whole heart my whole heart I want to give everything that I have houses will come and go cars will come and go grass will coming though jobs are coming though things of life will come and go but this is the eternal thing that we're doing tonight moms and dad teach their children how important this place is how sacred this place is at any moment it could be your special night your special night I'll be gone brother Reyes next week because I've got unfinished business there but many years ago I stepped down like I'm stepping right now it was a man walked up and he said I've left the Amish community you've heard me tell this before I left the Amish community and I've lost my business I've lost everything my back is shot it's gone there's a man my height I look right into his eyes you know you can tell him man a man is at that spot and I'll never forget the statement that came out of my lips so what is your hobby and he said I have I have a real small green house I really enjoy I prayed for his back and for his green house and now his green house is the biggest green house in Ohio not because a man had the ability but because of a man was standing at the right place at the right time when Jesus came can I tell you one more story this is where I get in trouble sometimes I was sitting into Chinese hotel I'm not gonna tell you in the name but I sent him to Chinese hotel and I was sitting in the room of a brother that's very precious to us and a brother from Canada and a brother from China was doing business together and they wasn't surviving they wasn't making ends meet and this was a last-ditch effort in their business and it seemed like everything was gone and we would go to a meeting and we'd been in two weeks of meetings and now we've come to the end and I'm sitting there just totally toast and I'm actually sitting on a window well Thomas you and I we cleaned chimneys together and I would always enjoyed sitting on the hearth of a chimney I talked to the customers maybe preach to them maybe we talked about life and I just find a place to sit down I've never had the ability to said Indian style on the floor but I'm close whether I'm standing or sitting so and I was just sitting on that window well and I'm just sitting there and and they're just busy in the room and about 30 people had been in the room only just only moments before and they preached in the room because we preach in service we preach in rooms and and the brother was just standing there God spoke to me said bless his business and I stood in a little circle about this size and they said God just spoke to me that he's going to bless your business and I took both of their hands and I held their hands I just got a request only a couple of weeks ago pray for them they've got so much business they don't know what to do with in both of these cases I'm not talking about pennies I'm talking about mega dollars God owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills money don't mean nothing to are you with me homes don't mean anything to God but he said he bless you but I want to tell you you put God first in your life and if we're mortal once let's put God first in our lives in everything [Applause] god bless you God bless you God bless you I apologize for not feeling so well but I want to give my best whether I feel well or don't feel well and went to Switzerland this year and I preached a sermon on I have no regrets no regrets because I've used this policy in my life every day I want to serve Him with everything that's within me every day is not a church today but it's a day that I can pray it's a day that I can study it's a day that I can get along with God no every day is not a 100 board 100% or stays pressed and I think we need days of rest at times but even in those days of rest do the right thing there's a song says I'd rather have Jesus do we have the words for that song you've been asking for me to sing a song okay [Music] I'm a plan [Music] [Music] [Applause] that was Sigma testimony [Music] be faithful [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I look very much like a man I've had a quarter for every time I've been told this [Music] walked into the total stranger in the other day of church he'd never been in that church before he just looked over at me with his go out and shook my head and he said I don't know if you've ever been told this [Music] but if you read Teddy Roosevelt story his wife died six hours later his mom died and he made a big X on the diary that day and he said today the light died in my world they took down all the pictures of his wife all the pictures of his mother forbade his children to ever call her name again cause he didn't notice [Music] you see this is only the beginning [Music] look around at my children and I've told them for my life I've got brother branham's images and pictures and our Lord Jesus images I said it's good to know who William Branham was but it was even more important to know the God it's important to know me but it's really important to know the God that lives inside of me [Music] that's the important part tonight it's important to come to this service but the most important thing you can have is to know him [Music] other on this is a syphilis sermon I've ever heard what did you do with the last 24 hours what do you do with the last 24 hours it's a small sampling of what you've done with your life what would you do with the next 24 hours I know many of us don't have very big big plans but whatever it is I want to serve God with it could you just help me now cuz you're only mortal once and I'd say just as much as I'm sitting at that table that by the tempered others those words across the table and he said remember we're only mortal once jump dead in my heart for now 34 weeks just over and over again I I don't mean to be reflective of it now but I want to say this to you what have we done with our lives what have we done [Music] what have we done what you bring what you say god bless you tonight god bless you and less the broken pieces Oh [Music] I [Music] fire Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] I wanna be [Music] my [Music] you're smearing [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] not feeling free full
