about two o'clock this morning i was with him and we had a wonderful time and so you should be the beneficiaries tonight so amen god bless you we certainly we certainly are thankful to see you this evening amen so glad to have you in the house of the lord tonight and we so love you with all of our hearts and amen we miss brother joe and sister ruth and they have at our graduation and so we're just we're proud that our buddy has graduated michael has graduated and wow how time flew amen feels like only a few days ago we were dedicating him to the lord and so time just goes so it's like a vapor and it just goes and it just passes by us and so amen sister mary we sure have been praying for you today losing a good friend like sister hope for those i don't know how many of you would remember sister hope but her husband and her were two of the sweetest people on earth and so amen so we want to pray for the family there and then they have adopted some girls and there's quite a situation with all of that so i would ask you that you would remember them in prayer and that god would just be with them in a special way amen that god would touch them we lost a special preacher this week and that was that was brother ernie villanueva i mean to remember brother ernie amen ernie ernie was around here many years ago i knew him i knew him since a young man and so i think brother tim pruitt actually actually prayed him through to the holy ghost and so he said i held him till he got it amen and so amen so we love brother ernie brother ernie was probably the most powerful positive speaker that i ever was and he was a motivational speaker as well in the work realm and uh and he actually was quite quite a friend to ours to our family my mother enjoyed feeding him gravy and biscuits and he would he was the kind of fella that you could just take into your home and just enjoy it and he was always so cordial and so nice and so uh we he he is at a great reunion now amen and so i'm sure he's done shook my mom's hand and brother homer's hand and telling them how everything's going on down here so so we certainly will miss brother ernie and he is getting his reward even now and so and many more rewards to come i find this interesting that i i kind of keep certain things this is the first note that brother ernie ever sent me amen and i would say that's about 30 years ago and so i want to read it for you tonight in his behalf and so that's all right it's two pieces of it didn't and so and you'll remember you'll notice this one real quickly it had effect on me if god is your partner you better have big plans d.l moody is the one that spoke that sermon and so amen i've been blessed by it by that thought so many times because it's a reality to me the next note that he sent me he's he said this prayer takes about one minute pray it sincerely and then those who you send it to pray have them to pray for you believe it and receive it it's a powerful prayer and when you're down to nothing god is up to something father in the name of jesus bless me even while i'm reading this prayer and bless the one that sent this to me in a very special way open supernatural doors in our lives save and set us free give us a double portion of your spirit and we take back everything that the devil has stolen emotional health physical health finances relationships our children jobs our homes and marriages council cancel every plot and plan and scheme the enemy has devised against us in the matchless name of jesus and i declare that no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper god bless you brother ernie even now amen god bless you if you will turn with me in your scriptures tonight i know sometimes you would think or people would think that we actually orchestrate these services and have songs to line up like that they have tonight and and uh well there's somebody higher orchestrating than than us but i'm going to speak to you on praising in the storm amen how you like that praising him in the storm i will praise him in the storm and i've had it for a few weeks and it's just been waiting this way and so you know you don't orchestrate these things but you know i i have been thinking over it over the last few days there's nobody more qualified to preach this sermon than myself because i'm not looking at a storm to come or one that i've been through but i'm fighting right through one and so right here in the storm hallelujah we will praise him in the midst of this storm amen had a wonderful day today had a miserable one yesterday but i just told the devil in that miserable day i said wait a lamar way to lamar yeah so it's my turn amen turn with me to matthew chapter 8 and verse 23 this afternoon if you will we sure love you with all of our hearts or greet you in the name of the lord amen we sure miss andrew and andrew's actually i i forgot to do this god bless you those in ohio that was expecting me tonight well i'm home and we hallelujah for that too so amen amen i i just didn't feel to go and so i'm here amen i hope you enjoy that so amen amen god bless those people that's like a second home to me matthew chapter 8 and verse 23 amen and when he had entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there are rows of great tempters in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and the disciples came to him and woke him saying lord save us we perish and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the seas and there was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner of a man is this that even the winds and the seas obey him amen may the lord bless the reading of his word and you may be seated this evening now christians aren't the only ones that get storms hallelujah just waiting on you to settle in christians are not the only one to get storms it's not a new thing for you to get storms you just expected it when you were a sinner you kind of expected you reap what you sow i'm not doing well and so these things are going to come but after you become a christian sometimes you think well i shouldn't be getting this kind of a storm in my life this shouldn't be going on i'm doing good i'm serving the lord but what you realize that there was a time in your life that you were swimming with the with the river but when you become a christian you turn around and the waves sometimes seem to be bigger and stronger and the wind sometimes they seem to be a whole lot more august to it but i want you to understand even a sleeping jesus [Music] hallelujah even asleep in jesus is greater than the storm [Applause] hallelujah we preached so many times that we go wake him we go waking go wake him go wake him he's in the boat with you but if you will notice jesus reminds them you're of a little faith those storms couldn't have done anything to you because i was in the ship so even a sleeping tired wore out jesus is more greater than your biggest storm [Applause] say well i haven't heard from him i haven't dreamed about him i haven't got a word from the lord i haven't got anything come my way is he anywhere is he 10 million miles away let me just say he's in the boat you didn't get in the storm that he didn't see coming he made a provision for you you'll get out of it he made a promise i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world i'll take his word i'll take his word every time matthew chapter 14 and verse 22 and straightway jesus come constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go before him into the other side while he sent the multitude away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when evening was come he was left there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and the fourth watch of the night jesus went into went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway jesus spoke to them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid i don't mind telling you when he speaks it sure calms my heart and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me to come into the water come on unto thee on the water and he said come on and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked out on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind blusterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me you don't have to pray 52 minutes sometimes you don't have it and then immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him thou a little faith almost repeating words that they had heard before how much god could say to us tonight ron have more faith have no faith now oh thou have a little faith wherefore didest thou doubt and when they come into the ship the wind ceased and they were in the ship and came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god i think after our storm many times that's when we can stop and praise him but god wants praise in the middle of your storm now to back that up let's just turn to uh james chapter one and verse two and i i just want to i want to lay a foundation this evening for tomorrow and and i believe we're going to have a good time this weekend my brethren counted all joy when you fall into divers temptations hallelujah really difficult to do it's mind-boggling for you to do because it's not in your nature when you're having trouble to praise him it's not in your humanity when things are gloomy looking bad you're getting bad reports things are going wrong you'll blame the doctor you'll blame the teachers you'll blame everybody around you where did i sin where did i fail you didn't get enough you didn't get a letter from god telling you the storm was coming but now you find yourself in it and instead of whining and bellyaching and i've got it worse than any other human beings ever had it in my life and you know knowing this that the trine of your faith worth the patience god said it's going to make a way but sometimes you've got to wait and your faith is going to put to a test we as a body of believers i'm getting ready for go to major scans on monday we as a body of believers are looking every time we go to the cancer center to hear the words zero cancer that's the final report that's what we're believing for [Applause] but i don't fall apart when they tell me that it's still active and it's growing i don't fall apart i don't fall apart when they tell me that it's affected another organ or affected this or it's killed this organ or it's destroyed that organ i don't fall apart because i realize there's an in-report that i'm going to get are you with me doctors are there to help me through the trial and help me brother brown said he believed in doctors he said do you trust them he said take their medicine amen i'd like to thank the lord that my medicine's been paid for for the rest of this year that's 30 000 a month i thank god for that miracle two weeks ago they called me and asked for a credit card one of the pharmacists called me and said the pharmacist somewhere another and they call me said we need your credit card said we're charging 23 000 for the medicine that we're getting ready to send you and i said i'm not paying it come on i said they're gonna pay for it and i i don't need to pay for it they're gonna pay for it for me they did it last year they'll pay for me for me and and he and he spent about a half an hour on the phone trying to convince me we've already filled it this i said listen i i don't have to pay for it it's paid for for men they hadn't approved it but i was speaking by faith are you with me listen it sometimes your burden seems pretty serious right in front of you but you don't have to receive the devil's report no i'm not going to go along with that are you with me now he told me that but this is your property you're you're owed i said i'm not paying you so this week when i got it in the mail free i thanked him who's the great doctor [Applause] himself but let patience have her perfect works for for that you may be perfect and entire one and nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and abrade it not and it shall be given him let me just say this to you sometimes you don't have an answer god's always got one he's always got the answer for you but let him ask in faith not wavering for he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed and let not that man think that he shall receive anything from the from the lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways that's the reason why i have always spoke to you with what the prophet said never think a negative thought going to come through your mind but you don't have to harbor them you don't have to marry them don't let them become a part of you we should have a great expectation let me just say this to you and this might be of a help this is just free to you this is a 30 year old note on top of a 30 year old note if you live in negativity you will live a negative life if you expect defeat failure will always be at your door you do not have to accept mediocrity you don't have to failure does not have to be your epitaph on your tombstone come on church so many people are always looking at the negative side oh that hit a nail they're always wanting to you know when prayer requests go across this pulpit and i was just sharing this just earlier prayer of course go across the pulpit pray for me the doctors are looking at something and they're looking and they're looking and they're looking and they're looking hey listen i've already got the worst report that you can get so nothing that they can say monday is going to affect me if i can feel this good in this storm just wait till the storm is over with [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i realize that we touch a lot of people because of so many people are affected by cancer and we get so many reports in almost every week of pray for me i i'm suffering with cancer one of the pastors in europe actually his daughter they just sent word even today that his daughter has cancer and she has lung or actually breast cancer and and brother gerd actually sent me a note today to be remembering them in prayer let me just say this to you cancer has a lot of fear that goes with it and there's a lot of torment that goes with it but let me just say this you our god is bigger than every cancer in the body [Applause] so i could choose to live in a negative room are you with me i did all the things that i need to do and one of the doctors told me the other day said are you working on your uh what they call that bucket bucket list well i'm not expecting to die so no need me starting a bucket list anytime soon all that was free verse 10 but the rich and that he is made low because as a flower of the grass he shall pass away when i read that scripture i think about men that no doubt was on the scene when john wesley was here or even martin luther was here or even columba was here that were millionaires and here was some of these preachers that were absolute pulpers those millionaires they couldn't take it with them but those men that were paupers that preached the gospel they took it all with them are you with me there's your glass full for the sun is no sooner risen but with the burning heat but it withers the grass and the flower thereof falleth and grace of the fashion it it of it is perish so so also is the rich man faith away in his ways this is a powerful scripture hang on to it blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that loved him so in your temptation storm god will make a way of escape for you [Applause] are you with me the pulling string on your life brother branham will remind us as ministers be careful with popularity money or women are you with me we were talking on the way down the road tonight and and uh just talking about temptations and and i said well one of my greatest temptations is sugar not women but sugar a dozen of this krispy kreme donuts has been on my my shelf today and that thing has been like a devil calling me all day i have overcome except for this morning how do i know what my temptation is brother ron that which pulls on you that which pulls on you and your temptation may not even be your wife's temptation may not be your neighbor's temptation or somebody else in the church but god wants first place in your life and many times those temptations will destroy your body spirit and your soul [Music] but every man that is tempted when he is drawn away with his own lust and enticed i skipped the scripture let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god amen for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed let me just say young people satan will never stop pulling on you even when you're grey-headed and can't see and definitely can't hear he will not stop pulling on you whether you're strong sitting in church or in a nursing home he will be after you and because you won't bite on one bait won't mean he won't quit fishing but god will be with you in your storm then when lust is conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death do not err my beloved brethren every good gift and perfect gift is bore is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither a shadow of turn of his own will begot he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creature wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to heal this is incredible scripture tonight swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath hallelujah probably ought to read that 14 times but those that are having a problem with that tongue tonight remember this life and death comes right out of your tongue you want to create a bad atmosphere just use that tongue the wrong way brother ron i don't know what you're talking about tell your wife tomorrow morning how ugly she is you're probably going to miss service you will create an atmosphere but if you turn that to praise the older you get the more beautiful you are of all the trillions of women in the world god picked me to live with you you're the most beautiful wonderful woman in the world and i'm glad we're going to live together for eternity [Applause] it's a truth it's a true church wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity and naughtiness and receive with with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your lives but be your doers of the word and not hearers only this is powerful scripture because so many people want to be spectators even at church spectators don't they don't want to participate hallelujah it's kind of like going to a banquet i watch people i'm gonna keep my head down here for a minute i watch people and they'll go to a bank that's just extremely prepared and they walk in and maybe it's a potluck dinner and they bring a dish about this big expecting to feed 300 people when it comes time to clean up they run from a broom like they've never it looked like a witch is riding on it they feel like they're too good to be a part of all of that let me just say this to you if you're lazy i'm going to preach to you we're a working church here we're a team here we're a body of believers here well i'm going to leave that up to this one and i'm going to lay and leave it up to this why do i mention something carnal because it becomes spiritual you're not careful you're just hearing the gospel you're never praying you're never doing study on your own you're never giving an encouraging word to somebody else are you with me now as well preach to me help me preach praising in the storm it's a principle that you've got to have in your life when everything looks like it's upside down it is the time to start thinking joint i know a man that was a preacher his world flipped upside down it was torn completely apart absolutely totally apart and he thought suicide was the answer so he's just started before he killed himself he just started thanking god i know this man he just started thanking god for everything that god had done and before it was done he had a revival and that moment changed his life and he said just as i was getting ready to take my own life god gave me a brand new life for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way verse 24 and straight forth forgetteth what manner of man he was but whosoever looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continue therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed let me just say god is a rewarder you will never do anything for god that he don't turn and bless you for it are you with me now are you with me if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue this was one of brother homer's favorite scriptures right here but deceiveth him his own heart this man's religion is in vain so if the holy ghost doesn't bridle your tongue you need another dose give the lord a good hand right there [Applause] the scripture says and we read this last week god is our refuge two weeks ago a very present help in trouble god don't go into a crisis meeting saying oh mercy they've run into a bunk he saw it a long time ago so he has prepared you whether you realize it or not before abraham was ever asked to go up on a mountain to take his son's life abraham had had a lot of trials before that to get him ready to believe that god that would ask him that and if he did take his life he'd raise him back up so in the midst of his storm knowing he's going up there to take the boy's life he told the boys that were with him we will be back you got to trust god brother ron i'm just going to quit because i'm having such a horrible time you've listened to the wrong voice the voice is always telling you of the devil god don't love you the people don't love you you ain't got a relationship with the lord and that is only telling you if you've reversed that he's telling you even the devil's telling you subliminally god loves you and he'll never give up on you but my job is to tell you that god don't love you he don't care about you your name never gets called up you know i could care less if my name ever got called here long as it's called there and then he says well done ron amen therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea the waters thereof roar and be troubled the mountains shaken the swelling thereof there is a river and the streams where i shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right right early the heathen rage the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge are you with me come behold the

no fishing so therefore there is no condemnation so quit letting your past whip you over and over and over again put that storm out of existence psalms 23 and verse 1 very familiar to all of us the lord is my shepherd powerful words he is my shepherd and i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside of the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil you can walk through your storm for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me i was standing there when my mother passed she had talked to me and andrew she was as calm as probably more common than i am right now we talked a few things how are we doing how are you doing uh we talked about how much we loved her how much we thanked her the doctor had already prepped us that she was getting ready to pass it just any minute and the doctor just asked her one more time why don't you just if just let us let us try to help you she said i'm ready to go and about that time the switch just went she went why wasn't she upset and fearful brother brown said i don't want to be a coward when it comes down to dying so many people romanticize death songs of death talk of death constantly involved death is there let me just say something about death to a christian death is your taxi cab well let me put it up into a new room it's your uber driver and you've been a christian all your life and you committed it to christ and death is on its door and it's come it couldn't come a minute earlier and it couldn't have been a minute later it's a tool in the hand of god to transport you from here to heaven paul said to be absent from this body is to be present with the lord are you with me i know we had such a fear of coving but let me just say this your sister matters transformed from this body that was couldn't hardly get herself out of a couch into a body where she's running she doesn't have a grey hair he got melvin from a from a situation in a nursing home having it set in a wheelchair or in a nursing bed to a body that was well never to be sick again it gave brother homer two legs in a second are you with me so god intercedes for us even in our time of death sometimes we look at it wrong and sure we sorrow sure we we we're we're sad to see our loved ones go home sure we grieve but it should be a time of rejoicing in the storm no more pain no more agony no more irs no more presidential elections that's enough to praise god about raphael we're getting in we'll get won't be long we'll be into october and we've just elected a president they'll start running in october for the next term well i better get off of that luke chapter 11 verse 9 and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you now this is in your red letter edition bible so that means that this is jesus i say unto you ask amen you heard me a few weeks ago talk about if you don't pray you have to ask ask specifically tomorrow morning i'm going to share with you i'm going to bring a deer to church i'm actually going to bring a deer to church tomorrow morning hallelujah because when i preached identified for rapture let me remember that sermon it's okay it's okay i'm looking down after i walked into the back 12 years since i'd killed a trophy buck these guys are sitting back there and i just felt inspiration i said tomorrow i'm going to kill a buck this wide and i was sitting down and i said tomorrow i'm going to kill a buck this wide and he's going to stand about that tall 4 30 brother andrew texted me said have you seen anything i said not a thing i hadn't seen anything all day in two minutes the buck that i asked for i had saw him flip over like that right there and i said well i just got him they couldn't believe it because they didn't hear the shot in hindsight i should ask for this are you with me but i want to show it to you because it's just as big a miracle as that little boy getting ready to walk [Applause] now the scripture said ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened are you with me now remember who you are how powerful you are you're more powerful than an archangel that's in heaven jesus said this i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruity taketh away in every branch that beareth fruit he purchased it that it might bring forth more fruit now you're clean through the word which i've spoken unto you abide in me and i knew as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abideth in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine and ye are the branches and he that abideth in me and i and you the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me i love this without me you can do nothing jesus reminded us over and over again in his humanity i can do nothing except my father shows me first if you abide not in me he that is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you shall ask what you what you will and it shall be done unto you one of brother branham's uh mentors that was just before brother branham f uh not f f bossworth but smith wigglesworth he would go into a hospital and tell them you quote the scripture until you believe it if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you and he would tell them when that becomes a reality to you you get up and put your clothes on and go home brother homer went to he went to the va hospital and i'm looking for a name real quickly brother abby was in the hospital and brother homer went there to pray for brother abby and and there was a a black man that was laying in another bed and he the two of his sisters was there and you'll remember this story as i began to tell it but two of his sisters was there with him the black the black man and brother homer had prayed for brother abby and and uh those two women came over to brother homer and asked him says will you pray for our brother and i said sure he he said he sure would and so they went over and they told him they said this is a man of god and he's going to pray for you and you're going to get well notice they're positive speaking they've never heard brother homer preach a sermon but they saw a life manifested many times people that work with you get healed because of your prayer they ask you to pray because they see your life [Music] [Applause] brother homer went back two weeks later and he he said did the man die he said no said said after you left said he got well god walked got up changed his clothes and they took him home amen hallelujah oh don't you love the lord don't you just love the lord now watch this just a moment he says many people come to the altar to be prayed for and they have an intellectual faith they believe in their heart their mind they believe it because they've heard it they believe it because they know it's the best policy but that's not what god looks at he don't look at your intellectual faith he looks on your heart where there's an inside and sitting and he said when it comes from your heart all things are possible when you confess your confession meets up with your life your life speaks as loud as your confession does and when your confession says one thing in your life says another. there's something wrong somewhere that's because you've got an intellectual faith and not a faith in your heart and that and that shows that outside the knowledge of god but inside there's a demon of doubting powerful powerful brother branham said give me a preacher give me a christian give me a housewife that's a christian give me a farmer a factory worker that'll put god first in everything and i'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him amen he seeks god first what did god tell me before the trial ever started if you trust me i'll use you like never before are you with me that's the way it is with every born-again christian when he really gets into god and he watches his life and god's word and realizes it's lined up in every bit of it he's got long-suffering gentleness and quietness and maintenance and power and faith love joy and peace he ain't tossed about like a troubled sea he ain't worried about every little thing he ain't jumping here like the bottle stopper on a windy ocean he's set he's pure your home should not be a storm can i preach to you your home needs to be the most peaceful place on earth it needs to be a sanctuary where god is welcome every minute of the day brother on but we just floss and fight all the time get right with god get right with god but it's my wife you chose her it's my husband you chose him it ain't the preacher's fault but you need to get right with god i got a letter this week about how much drama was in this person's life i responded we are a church of no drama i've been at places that has a a box in the back that says any complaint put it here we got the same kind of facility it's a can that stands about this tall and it's got a for a general it's got a white trash can liner in it and you feel welcome to put your complaint there anytime [Applause] i don't have drama in business i don't have drama in my home and i'm going to be a pastor that has no drama as a matter of fact my doctors told me the rest of my life i'm going to have no drama no drama make sure your family no drama well i've been having that policy all my life i don't like drunk well brother on i just have to fuss i just have to get it off my chest go out to a fence post and just stand there and tell that fence post just tell it off just telling everything that's on your mind when you're done repent because you're going to need it be thankful that that fence post won't argue back with you hey that was for somebody i'm preaching on a storm so evidently i found one now jesus christ came from heaven to glory down here to build a church and the material that he's putting in it is time-tested material you might come to an altar and make a confession but when you find blowholes and everything else in there where the world's blown maggots in you and so forth you cannot stand he just pitches you from one side god wants a time-tested church not a christian today and a backslider tomorrow and it's in and out and up and down he can't place you nowhere but he's got a church that's tested went through the trouts through losses through sickness through sorrow through death and still standing with the testimony glory to god we've got a bunch of that in this building you've been through some monster storms and you're still standing [Applause] god doesn't have to give you a pacifier every time as i said a couple weeks ago we don't have adult diapers here i said this to you the other day and i want to say it again to bill for tomorrow what man calls great god calls foolish and what a man calls foolish god calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of god and find out after all what god wants us to do and the only way that i know to do that is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb or a hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will try to change the mind of god in spiritual scriptural signs of the times he said today what they have the nerve to say wonder why what happened to the god of the bible where is that at why you choked him out by your creeds you choked him out by your traditions you tried to place him back in history he is a god of history and what he's waiting on today there's the same god of history that when moses called on him at the red sea the god of history rose up and made a way and when joshua called on the god of history at jordan he rose up and made a way and daniel called on him in a fiery furnace and he made a way are you with me yes whether your name's karen pruitt or elena butts or doug hill god sees a storm at your end he knows what you're going through and he's made a way for you [Applause] hallelujah satan may pin you in a corner he may pin you in a corner with cancer god will make a way of escape he may pin you under a car god will make a way of escape satan may take your family away from you god will make a way of escape god has always made a way i'd like to remind you god's never failed can i give you just a few more quotes you have been given checkbook authority you have not because you asked not sometimes you just got to write the check my mother was famous for taking checks and she'd place him in her bible and when we got her bible there was checks all through her bible and a lot of miracles happened [Music] sometimes you got to just do what it says write the check sign it mrs jesus christ send it through the bank of heaven it may take 25 years like it did abraham to have a son but let me just say when god makes a promise he will make a way [Applause] brother ron but i'm trying my best let me just say this you it's when you give up and say god it's all yours i've made a mess out of my life i've had a lot of trouble god i give you the steering wheel i want you to drive a little bit it's stronger than a country song [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah brother andrew glover spoke these words last week you've heard them almost every weekend since you've been in church he knows that if the people get at the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army you are god's queen living in mortal flesh on the earth but the season of immortality is upon us we're getting ready to be changed are you with me now he made a way he conquered sickness so every sickness that comes across the doctor's lips jesus has already conquered it do you believe that do you believe that he's already conquered it he conquered temptation but brother ron jesus didn't have a computer he didn't have an iphone to have to deal with he conquered the devils that invented the machine [Music] and if you'll spend your time more in prayer and reading your bible and listen to some good hospital wholesome gospel music and the prophet of god and get your mind off of what's seeing the internet [Applause] and fox is trying to tell you hey listen they've all got their own parallels there is a king that's coming and i'm in his kingdom and it will be peace for eternity [Applause] have faith in god i love this quote it's a pet quote of mine oh my how the devil has to recognize the supreme authority of jesus christ not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind who i represent he has to mind who sent me here i love that he don't have to fear me he don't fear me but he has to fear who i represent this fellow here drove up today any state trooper car backed it in i was sitting on the porch it's been a day in my life a state trooper showing up at my house before i was married would have sent chills through me but you see i know who he represents i don't know about you but when you're on the interstate and all of a sudden a fellow like this rolls in behind you it sends chills you hit your brakes and you're doing five miles under the speed limit amen because you fear who he represents i'm using that for an example now i don't know what kind of storm that you came to this weekend with you're not alone can i say this with you you're not alone you gave me a picture last christmas of jesus walking in the water in the middle of the storm it sets literally inches away from where i study because i'm not alone in the storm i'm not alone in the storm and that picture tells me every day ron you're not alone are you with me some days i write r on my calendar for rough day g on my calendar for good day rough day i will live through it and tomorrow's going to come you may may not be fighting cancer or anything that goes with it but let me just say whether it's a good day or a bad day tomorrow's coming and jesus said i'll be with you every day [Applause] and you are an ambassador of god living on the earth he needs you here he needs you here to represent him can i just drop this free to you your prayers are like salt as a preservative to the vegetables in your garden the salt preserves that fruit or those vegetables to keep them from rottening and whether you realize it or not your community would be much worse without your prayers that's bigger than you even got it your practice your prayers maybe are keeping your company going your prayers is keeping not only your home safe but the homes close to you safe [Music] are you with me satan can't get to you because of the angels of god that are compassed about you [Applause] well brother ron but i'm in a storm of my life let me finish with this moses mother joseph was asked to put a baby into a crocodile infested water she was told by with her husband was told by an angel of the lord that he was the deliverer are you with me there's sometimes you can't see it you can't vindicate it but you believe it [Music] and god asked them to preserve him put him in the basket and let him go down the crocodile infested water they couldn't hear it but a prophet of god told us what happened william branham told us said that god lined up gabriel to stand on the bush on that on that on that that that bushel stand on the end of it and when the crocodiles came up simply kick them back down in the water and to line ten thousand angels up and down the river and when he got into the whirlpools and storms of life see that he gets out [Applause] if god can take care of a baby in a crocodile infested water in a basket that had car all over it and put angels all around it he can take care of you i love it when god says i got this i got this i got it you didn't you were praying and he was the last thing on my mind i'm sorry but god spoke to me and showed me a vision that i would pray for him what we are watching now is god at work oh it was just timing brother ron i'll show you time and in the morning let me just say my god is on time my god is on time and let me just say this you i have no doubt in my mind that joseph watched that basket go completely out of sight while her stomach and her heart were falling apart what she couldn't see was the most powerful angels in heaven amen let me just say this what you can't see as the most powerful angels have been assigned to take care of you need a job he's a job maker whatever you need in life he's the waymaker he's got it in control he's got it in control he takes care of you he watches over you don't you love him with all your friends hear seen and unseen won't you just raise your hand to the lord say god you see the storms that i'm going through personally in my life i don't need my name called i don't need my storm to be told but god i heard tonight that you got it father in the name of jesus christ [Music] you know exactly how to meet us
