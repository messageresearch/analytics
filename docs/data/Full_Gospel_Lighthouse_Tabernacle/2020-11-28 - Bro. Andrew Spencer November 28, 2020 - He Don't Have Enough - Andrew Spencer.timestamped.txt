[52:18] amen if you have your bibles this
[52:20] evening we'll turn over in a book
[52:22] first samuel chapter 17 and verse 32
[52:27] i pray you bear with me this evening
[52:30] the lord dropped his heart this thought
[52:32] on my heart ten minutes before i walked
[52:34] out
[52:36] so as i've said before this be like
[52:41] riding a new horse
[52:46] but i found that when god says something
[52:50] he's already confirmed confirmed it to
[52:53] me but
[52:54] i pray that he would confirm it to you
[52:56] tonight
[52:59] i'd like to speak to you on he don't
[53:03] have enough
[53:05] he don't have enough first samuel
[53:08] chapter 17 and verse 32 if you found
[53:10] your place there i just wanted to
[53:12] share some news with you we we had you
[53:15] praying for brother roger
[53:17] saylor and uh he called me last weekend
[53:20] before service and
[53:22] was just relaying some things to us

[53:26] brother roger had found a lump on his on
[53:28] his chest area here

[53:35] and so they were they were doing they
[53:37] were going to do a mammogram thinking
[53:39] that

[53:43] so on monday monday as you know brother
[53:45] roger had to test
[53:47] and they could not find no cancer
[53:52] hallelujah brother roger i believe
[53:56] brother roger did a little shouting

[54:02] uh you know we thank the lord
[54:05] you know we say well it wasn't there to
[54:07] begin with

[54:18] it can't hold and they cannot stand
[54:20] before believers prayer
[54:23] god knows and i want to say to you
[54:27] tonight you may hear me say it a few
[54:28] times
[54:29] but satan don't have enough they don't
[54:32] have enough
[54:34] first samuel chapter 17 and verse 32
[54:37] and david said to saul let no man's
[54:39] heart fail because of him
[54:41] thy servant will go and fight with this
[54:44] philistine
[54:46] and saul said to david thou are not able
[54:48] to go against this philistine to fight
[54:50] with him
[54:50] for thou art but a youth and he a man of
[54:53] war from his youth
[54:55] and david said unto saul thy servant
[54:57] kept his father's sheep and there came a
[54:59] lion and a bear
[55:00] and took a lamb out of the flock and i
[55:03] went out after him and smote him
[55:05] and delivered it out of his mouth and
[55:07] when he arose against me i caught him by
[55:09] his beard
[55:10] and smote him and slew him thy servants
[55:14] slew both the lion and the bear
[55:16] and this uncircumcised philistine shall
[55:18] be as one of them
[55:20] seeing he hath defied the armies
[55:23] of the living god let's go to prayer
[55:25] this evening
[55:26] father we come before you tonight lord
[55:29] we humble ourself before you
[55:31] lord we bow our heads to the dust of the
[55:33] earth from which we came father
[55:35] lord you know the sixteen elements lord
[55:37] that you have created father
[55:39] and lord we are built for a purpose lord
[55:42] jesus
[55:42] and lord you know the things that have
[55:45] that have come up through the dna
[55:47] lord of our history but father i believe
[55:49] that there is a blood that cleanses
[55:52] all of our sins our mistakes and our
[55:54] failures
[55:55] and father we stand here tonight as we
[55:57] unite our faith together
[55:59] lord on behalf of our pastor brother ron
[56:02] lord he is constantly under attack and
[56:05] one might ask how much can a body
[56:07] take but father we're reminded that you
[56:10] paid a price at calvary
[56:12] that you were wounded for our
[56:14] transgressions you were bruised for our
[56:16] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[56:19] peace was upon you
[56:20] and by his stripes we are healed
[56:23] father we stand and believe that all of
[56:26] those stripes were not taken in vain
[56:28] this evening
[56:29] we believe father that when you went
[56:31] there to take those stripes you took
[56:33] them for our pastor
[56:34] you took them for our loved ones you
[56:36] took them for one of each and every one
[56:38] of us here tonight
[56:39] and we stand here upon the bases of your
[56:42] word father
[56:43] that you will not change and you will
[56:45] not you will not move off of your
[56:47] promises father
[56:48] and i pray lord that the angel of the
[56:50] lord would be so real
[56:52] father here that you would make yourself
[56:54] visible to us in this audience
[56:56] but not only here in that hospital room
[56:58] at uva
[57:00] father i pray that you would slip into
[57:02] the room just now
[57:03] maybe unawares to doctors may be
[57:05] unawares to even brother on but i pray
[57:07] the angel of healing would slip into the
[57:09] room father
[57:11] and i would like to remind the enemy
[57:13] tonight that he does not have enough to
[57:15] stop god's promises
[57:16] and i pray that you would show forth
[57:18] your power tonight
[57:20] and a display like you can only do
[57:23] we glorify the god of heaven and we
[57:25] bless your holy name
[57:27] and the church of god says amen god
[57:30] bless you you may be seated
[57:32] this evening as we continue on with our
[57:35] scripture reading the verse
[57:36] 37 and david said moreover the lord
[57:40] that delivered me out of the paw of the
[57:42] lion and out of the paul of the bear
[57:45] he will deliver me out of the hand of
[57:47] the philistine notice
[57:49] david's confidence in the god that he
[57:52] served that the lord that delivered me
[57:54] he didn't put the credit upon himself
[57:56] when he went out with the line
[57:58] he didn't put the credit upon himself
[58:00] when he went out against the bear
[58:01] but he put the credit to where credit
[58:04] was due
[58:05] and he showed that that david was was a
[58:08] very strong believer in god's promises
[58:11] that
[58:11] that this god will deliver me out of the
[58:14] hand of this philistine
[58:16] and saul said unto david go and the lord
[58:19] be with me
[58:21] and saw armed david with his armor and
[58:23] he put a helmet of brass upon him and
[58:25] also
[58:26] also he armed him with a coat of mail
[58:29] and david girded his sword upon his
[58:32] armor and he assayed to go
[58:34] for he had not proved it and david said
[58:36] unto saul
[58:37] i cannot go with these for i have not
[58:40] proved them
[58:41] and david put them off of him and he
[58:44] took his staff in his hand and he chose
[58:46] him
[58:47] he chose him five smooth stones out of
[58:49] the brook and put him
[58:51] in a shepherd's bag which he had in his
[58:54] script and his sling was in his hand
[58:56] and he drew new near to this philistine
[59:00] brother matthew if you'll go and look on
[59:02] my desk there's a sling there and
[59:04] i might need it tonight and the
[59:06] philistine
[59:07] came on and drew near unto david and the
[59:11] man
[59:11] that bear the shield went before him and
[59:14] when the philistine looked about and saw
[59:17] david now could you
[59:18] imagine as as goliath looks down he's
[59:20] looked out upon many uh
[59:22] warriors that's come out to face him but
[59:24] could you imagine
[59:25] how how goliath looked upon this little
[59:28] boy as
[59:28] david drew near david drew near drew
[59:33] near to david and the man that bear the
[59:34] shear went before him and the philistine
[59:37] looked about and saw david
[59:39] he disdained him for he was but a youth
[59:42] and
[59:42] ruddy and of a fair countenance and the
[59:45] philistine said unto david am i a dog
[59:48] that thou cometh to me with staves and
[59:50] the philistine
[59:52] cursed david by his gods well it didn't
[59:54] do no good
[59:56] and the philistines said the david come
[59:58] to me and i will give thy flesh
[1:00:00] under the fowls of the air and to the
[1:00:02] beast of the field
[1:00:04] then said david to the philistine thou
[1:00:07] comest to me with a sword and with a
[1:00:09] spear
[1:00:09] and with a shield but i come to thee in
[1:00:11] the name of the lord of hosts
[1:00:13] the god of the armies of israel whom
[1:00:16] thou
[1:00:16] has to fight this day will the lord
[1:00:19] deliver thee into my hand and i will
[1:00:21] smite thee
[1:00:22] and take thine hand from thee thy head
[1:00:25] from thee and i will give the carcasses
[1:00:27] of the host of the philistines this day
[1:00:29] under the fowls of the air and to the
[1:00:31] beast of the field
[1:00:32] that all the earth may know that there
[1:00:35] is a god
[1:00:36] in israel and i want you to read this
[1:00:38] with me and all this assembly
[1:00:41] shall know that the lord god that the
[1:00:44] lord saveth not with sword
[1:00:46] and with spear for the battle is the
[1:00:49] lord's
[1:00:50] and he will give you into our hands
[1:00:54] why don't you give the lord a handclap
[1:00:56] of praise
[1:00:58] i want to remind you that satan ain't
[1:01:00] got enough
[1:01:02] and the enemy may curse you with his
[1:01:04] gods but he ain't got enough
[1:01:06] and we realize that we are in a battle
[1:01:08] for life we're in a battle for heavenly
[1:01:10] places and
[1:01:11] the prophet would tell us that there are
[1:01:13] that we are facing two powers
[1:01:15] and one of those powers is god's and the
[1:01:17] other is satan
[1:01:19] but that's why paul would tell us in in
[1:01:21] ephesians chapter 6 and 10 finally my
[1:01:24] brethren
[1:01:25] be strong in the lord and in the power
[1:01:27] of his might
[1:01:28] and put on the whole arm of god that you
[1:01:30] might be able to stand against the wiles
[1:01:33] of the devil
[1:01:34] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:01:36] blood but against principalities
[1:01:38] against rulers against powers against
[1:01:40] rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:01:43] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:01:45] places
[1:01:46] wherefore take unto you the whole arm of
[1:01:48] god that you might be able to withstand
[1:01:51] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:01:53] stand
[1:01:54] now you're not going to be able to stand
[1:01:55] against this enemy just facing him on
[1:01:58] your own
[1:01:58] you're not going to be able to stand out
[1:02:00] there in your emotion and whip this
[1:02:02] devil
[1:02:02] and face this devil we are facing a
[1:02:04] devil that has been against us for 6 000
[1:02:07] years he studied our dna
[1:02:09] he knows what you're made of he knows
[1:02:12] what's in your history
[1:02:13] but you are not going to be able to
[1:02:14] stand against this devil and come
[1:02:16] against him
[1:02:17] with all of his power and all of his
[1:02:19] authority which is nothing but a bluff
[1:02:21] and a lie
[1:02:22] but you're not going to be able to
[1:02:23] overcome this enemy by just standing in
[1:02:25] yourself
[1:02:26] but if you can wrap yourself in the
[1:02:28] whole armor of god
[1:02:29] if you can get yourself so enveloped in
[1:02:32] the power of the blood of jesus christ
[1:02:34] that your life is no longer your own but
[1:02:36] you're standing there
[1:02:37] in the blood of jesus christ that even
[1:02:40] if a mosquito come and lays hands on you
[1:02:43] and bites you
[1:02:43] that they'll go away singing that
[1:02:45] there's power in the blood
[1:02:47] i pray that you this evening would get
[1:02:49] so enveloped in the power of the blood
[1:02:51] of jesus christ
[1:02:52] that the enemy that when he gets close
[1:02:54] to you that he has to run for cover
[1:02:57] because the blood is against him the
[1:03:00] blood is against him and he never had
[1:03:02] enough at calvary to stop jesus
[1:03:05] and he ain't got enough now to stop
[1:03:07] jesus and he ain't got enough now to
[1:03:09] stop me
[1:03:10] he ain't got enough now to stop you and
[1:03:13] he ain't got enough now to stop the
[1:03:14] bride of jesus christ
[1:03:17] he ain't got enough now the prophet
[1:03:20] would tell us about that
[1:03:21] back in the day when the indians when
[1:03:23] they would have a contest that they
[1:03:25] would have a contest of strength and
[1:03:27] they would have a tug of war and they
[1:03:28] would put they would put a fire out in
[1:03:30] between those two
[1:03:31] and they would try to pull that losing
[1:03:34] party into that fire
[1:03:35] and brother branham would say that there
[1:03:37] is a contest between
[1:03:38] satan and the church of the living god
[1:03:42] and that those fires that satan has
[1:03:44] created
[1:03:45] that you are to pull satan into those
[1:03:48] fires
[1:03:48] that he created and it's going to show
[1:03:51] who's got the most power
[1:03:53] you are satan but i want to tell satan
[1:03:57] you ain't got enough
[1:04:00] you can build your fires you can say
[1:04:02] what you'd want to
[1:04:04] you can make up your lies you can say
[1:04:06] you're going to kill us but you ain't
[1:04:07] got enough
[1:04:08] you can say you're going to make us sick
[1:04:10] but you ain't got enough
[1:04:12] you can say you got power but you ain't
[1:04:14] got enough
[1:04:15] you can say you're gonna stop a rapture
[1:04:18] but you ain't got enough
[1:04:21] hallelujah we know who's got the most
[1:04:24] power
[1:04:25] so who's in control of all this god or
[1:04:27] satan
[1:04:28] you see satan has always tried to stop
[1:04:31] the move of god and
[1:04:32] always tried to stop the people of god
[1:04:35] of believing in god you'll notice the
[1:04:36] very first thing that satan did
[1:04:39] in the garden of eden was that he caused
[1:04:41] unbelief to enter in and cause
[1:04:44] reason but we know that he's always
[1:04:47] tried to stop the belief in god
[1:04:50] because you see when you go to believe
[1:04:52] in what god says it'll stop the enemy's
[1:04:55] plans
[1:04:56] you see that's what he's trying to get
[1:04:58] you disrupted about this weekend
[1:05:00] is he's trying to stop you from
[1:05:03] believing in what god has said
[1:05:05] but god's got a voice that is going to
[1:05:07] break through the darkness
[1:05:09] he's got a voice that'll break through
[1:05:10] the storm he's got a voice that'll bring
[1:05:14] dead people back to life
[1:05:15] [Applause]
[1:05:17] so we realize that satan has tactics but
[1:05:21] his tactics are never successful
[1:05:23] but he's always trying to trying to take
[1:05:26] away from the power
[1:05:28] he's trying to take away from that word
[1:05:30] you see if satan can make you
[1:05:32] feel like the weapon that you're
[1:05:34] fighting against him with
[1:05:36] is inadequate he's got you whipped right
[1:05:39] there
[1:05:40] is that right he's got you whipped when
[1:05:42] he makes you feel like you're
[1:05:44] like you're like the word that you're
[1:05:46] fighting with is not good enough
[1:05:49] well you see the armor that you're
[1:05:51] fighting with is strong enough
[1:05:53] the word that you're fighting with is
[1:05:54] strong enough but brother random would
[1:05:56] say that it's the hand of faith that
[1:05:59] holds that sword
[1:06:00] you see now when you take that sword
[1:06:03] into your hand
[1:06:04] and you hold it in your hand and you're
[1:06:06] holding it there with a sword
[1:06:07] with a power of faith behind it brother
[1:06:10] branham would tell
[1:06:11] us that when two omnipotents meet that
[1:06:13] the miraculous has got to take place
[1:06:16] and when your faith in an omnipotent god
[1:06:19] and the promises of omnipotent god
[1:06:21] meet together that the promises of god
[1:06:24] the miraculous
[1:06:25] has to happen and satan ain't got enough
[1:06:29] to stop it
[1:06:32] now remember this that christ in the
[1:06:33] true church is a continuation
[1:06:36] of the book of acts but the book of
[1:06:37] revelations
[1:06:39] shows how that the antichrist spirit
[1:06:41] would come into the church and defile it
[1:06:43] and making it lukewarm and formal and
[1:06:45] powerless
[1:06:46] it exposes satan and revealing his works
[1:06:49] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:06:52] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:06:55] right down to the time that he's cast
[1:06:57] into the lake of fire
[1:06:58] he fights that he cannot stand it
[1:07:02] because he knows that if if the people
[1:07:04] get the true revelation
[1:07:06] of the true church and what she is
[1:07:09] and what she stands for that she can do
[1:07:12] the greater works
[1:07:13] and she will be an invincible army
[1:07:17] you see he knows that if you get a hold
[1:07:19] of this revelation
[1:07:21] you know
[1:07:31] goliath didn't know what he was getting
[1:07:32] into that day
[1:07:34] but satan has been against this army for
[1:07:37] quite some time
[1:07:38] and he knows that if you get the true
[1:07:41] revelation
[1:07:42] if you grab ahold of a rock of
[1:07:43] revelation he knows what's coming for
[1:07:46] his head
[1:07:47] he's heard the sound of this thing
[1:07:49] before and he knows that when the people
[1:07:52] of god go to grabbing a hold of their
[1:07:54] sling
[1:07:54] and go to grabbing a hold of the
[1:07:56] promises of god that if they go to
[1:07:59] cutting it loose
[1:08:00] in a hand of faith that he ain't got
[1:08:02] enough to stop that rock of revelation
[1:08:05] even jesus would say that the gates of
[1:08:08] hell would not prevail against this
[1:08:10] revelation
[1:08:12] so he knows that if you get the true
[1:08:14] revelation
[1:08:15] of the true church and what she is and
[1:08:18] what she stands for
[1:08:19] that she can do the greater works and
[1:08:21] that she will be invincible that means
[1:08:24] that you're too
[1:08:24] powerful to be defeated
[1:08:28] that's why paul would tell us to fight
[1:08:30] the good fight of faith
[1:08:31] and to lay hold onto that lay hold on to
[1:08:34] eternal life
[1:08:35] you see because you'll be invincible if
[1:08:37] you lay a hold on these promises
[1:08:39] you'll be too powerful to be defeated
[1:08:42] you see he's always trying to tell you
[1:08:44] that you're never going to win but i got
[1:08:47] bad news for the devil
[1:08:48] the battle has already been won
[1:08:52] goliath didn't know it but 40 days
[1:08:54] before he ever started
[1:08:56] there was a little boy that had already
[1:08:58] been anointed that was already on his
[1:09:00] way
[1:09:01] and he didn't have enough to stop david
[1:09:04] from coming
[1:09:05] he boasted for 40 days 39 days
[1:09:08] 38 days and on down to the one day till
[1:09:11] david
[1:09:12] showed up it's a bad day for the devil
[1:09:16] because there have been some davids that
[1:09:19] have showed up in this hour
[1:09:21] that's not gonna put up with the devil's
[1:09:23] boast anymore
[1:09:26] goliath may have woke up and he may ate
[1:09:28] his wheaties
[1:09:29] but his wheaties didn't give enough
[1:09:31] power to stop this david
[1:09:36] you can eat your old meal you can eat
[1:09:38] your you can eat your
[1:09:39] th hm you can eat anything you want to
[1:09:42] but you d
[1:09:42] wasn't going to eat enough to stop this
[1:09:46] david
[1:09:50] he boasted for 40 days and the bible
[1:09:53] said that there
[1:09:54] came out a champion he'd been a champion
[1:09:57] before
[1:09:58] he'd been a champion over many people
[1:10:00] before and he sent out his voice of
[1:10:03] condemnation
[1:10:06] don't all of you come out here and fight
[1:10:08] me
[1:10:09] just send me one down here you see the
[1:10:13] enemy sent out his voice
[1:10:15] and notice what the enemy's voice did it
[1:10:18] sent fear through the camp of israel
[1:10:21] that everybody that was on the winning
[1:10:23] side was shaken
[1:10:26] everybody that was on the side that was
[1:10:28] going to come out victorious
[1:10:30] was over here trembling because they
[1:10:32] were looking down into a valley
[1:10:34] where there was a man that was standing
[1:10:36] so much tall he was standing
[1:10:38] head and he was standing way above
[1:10:40] everybody else
[1:10:42] had a head that looked like a bathtub
[1:10:47] and they were all fearful because of
[1:10:50] this man
[1:10:51] making his boast notice
[1:10:54] how powerful fear is fear
[1:10:58] stopped and whole army of israel
[1:11:01] from going down into a valley and taking
[1:11:03] what was rightfully theirs
[1:11:06] you see if they would have only realized
[1:11:08] what
[1:11:09] abraham had been spoken what abraham had
[1:11:12] told
[1:11:12] and what moses had prophesied if they'd
[1:11:15] only looked back in the scripture
[1:11:17] and look when the armies of israel had
[1:11:19] been outnumbered before
[1:11:21] they would join they would join their
[1:11:23] faith together with one another
[1:11:25] and they would walk down into that
[1:11:26] valley unafraid
[1:11:30] you see god sometimes will take you into
[1:11:33] a valley
[1:11:34] when nobody else wants to stand there
[1:11:35] with you
[1:11:37] god will take you into a valley when
[1:11:39] everybody else is just standing behind
[1:11:41] you saying you ain't good enough
[1:11:44] he'll make you walk out into a valley
[1:11:46] when everybody's behind you
[1:11:48] and they're grumbling and complaining
[1:11:50] that you're too little
[1:11:52] that you're not big enough that you're
[1:11:53] not strong enough but god's got a plan
[1:11:56] in sending a david down into a valley
[1:11:59] you might walk down into that valley but
[1:12:02] i want you to know don't you walk down
[1:12:03] there in fear
[1:12:04] if god has purposed a valley for you
[1:12:07] satan ain't got enough
[1:12:10] he ain't got enough to stop you in that
[1:12:12] valley
[1:12:12] [Applause]
[1:12:15] oh hallelujah let me say it to you like
[1:12:17] this
[1:12:18] cancer ain't got enough to stop brother

[1:12:24] but the children of israel is not like
[1:12:26] that day the children of israel is right
[1:12:29] behind brother ron

[1:13:01] that that voice falls on some of your
[1:13:03] ears

[1:13:20] too small
[1:13:22] david was told he was not big enough

[1:13:27] but a roof
[1:13:27] a ruddy little fella nothing but a youth

[1:14:46] david had something more than hard
[1:14:49] david had a god that was on the inside
[1:14:51] of him
[1:14:53] david had a god that would come and
[1:14:55] anoint him and he would go and he didn't
[1:14:57] have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:59] david would have an affair but you stand
[1:15:02] here
[1:15:02] as a son and daughter of god fully
[1:15:05] baptized
[1:15:06] robed in his righteousness if david
[1:15:09] could stand there and get so anointed
[1:15:11] that he would condemn the voice of hell

[1:17:06] or what they're doing
[1:17:07] the things that they do and it might
[1:17:09] make you embarrassed by the things that

[1:17:21] bootleggers i can point you back to a
[1:17:22] bunch of nonsense

[1:17:27] it tells me
[1:17:28] is that there is a blood
[1:17:33] oh hallelujah though satan may have
[1:17:36] thought that i was destined for hell
[1:17:39] he didn't have enough
[1:17:45] hallelujah
[1:17:49] you imagine can you imagine what goliath
[1:17:53] thought
[1:17:57] when this little ruddy looking boy
[1:17:58] walked out there
[1:18:03] and he started picking up stones
[1:18:09] he didn't just pick up any stones
[1:18:14] but the prophet said that he picked up
[1:18:16] five
[1:18:17] he picked up faith he picked up jesus
[1:18:21] he picked up grace can you imagine how
[1:18:25] goliath felt when he walked out there
[1:18:27] and that little boy just starts picking
[1:18:28] up
[1:18:29] stones now goliath has watched many
[1:18:34] people walk out and fight him before
[1:18:37] and he's seen him walk out there with a
[1:18:38] sword he's seen him walk out there with
[1:18:40] a spear but they ain't never seen
[1:18:42] he never seen anything like this and i
[1:18:44] can imagine
[1:18:46] that david as he's picking up jesus down
[1:18:49] here
[1:18:50] as he's picking up jesus up off the
[1:18:52] ground you see he knew
[1:18:54] that he only needed one for goliath but
[1:18:56] he needed four more for his brothers
[1:18:59] and i can imagine as goliath is watching
[1:19:01] this take place
[1:19:03] and goliath say what are you going to do
[1:19:05] with those
[1:19:06] i can hear david say wait and see

[1:22:26] that those rocks that were laying there
[1:22:28] in that valley
[1:22:29] had come from another world
[1:22:33] that when joshua and joshua chapter 10
[1:22:36] when he stopped the sun when he was
[1:22:38] fighting his enemy
[1:22:39] that the bible said that the lord rained
[1:22:42] down hailstones
[1:22:43] and that more died with hailstones than
[1:22:46] it did with the edge of the sword
[1:22:49] history tells us that these rocks that
[1:22:51] came out of this valley
[1:22:53] was the same rocks that had rained down
[1:22:55] from heaven

[1:23:18] glory
[1:23:21] these rocks didn't come from a kentucky
[1:23:23] preacher
[1:23:24] these rocks came from god
[1:23:30] he just used a kentucky preacher to let
[1:23:32] loose these rocks

[1:23:37] elkton boy
[1:23:38] will he use a grotto's girl will he use
[1:23:40] a richmond girl
[1:23:42] to let loose of these rocks these rocks
[1:23:45] which are fighting with
[1:23:46] they come from another world and satan

[1:31:02] from getting it
[1:31:06] he didn't have enough he didn't have
[1:31:08] enough when moses come down through
[1:31:10] there
[1:31:10] and they put him down into a rocket dog
[1:31:12] a crocodile-infested river
[1:31:16] it didn't have enough to stop him i know

[1:31:33] years old and say look what daddy said
[1:31:36] but moses had a promise of god that was
[1:31:39] hanging over top of him
[1:31:41] and satan didn't have enough to stop him
[1:31:44] they killed all the other two-year-olds
[1:31:46] and they tried to kill everybody out
[1:31:48] just the same way that they did when
[1:31:49] jesus was on earth
[1:31:51] but they didn't stop moses from growing
[1:31:54] up
[1:31:55] in the enemy's camp
[1:31:59] you can try all you want to you can
[1:32:01] knock me down all you want to

[1:32:10] they tried to throw daniel in the lion's
[1:32:12] den but they didn't have enough when the
[1:32:14] angels showed up
[1:32:16] are you with me they tried to throw the
[1:32:18] three hebrew children
[1:32:19] into a fire but the fire didn't have
[1:32:21] enough to burn them
[1:32:23] when they come out on the other side
[1:32:25] they come out and they didn't even smell
[1:32:27] like smoke
[1:32:28] i'd say to the church of the living god
[1:32:30] when we come out
[1:32:31] we're not coming out smelling like
[1:32:33] leodaceae we're coming out smelling like
[1:32:35] heaven
[1:32:39] oh set a fire down in my soul
[1:32:41] [Applause]
[1:32:47] they tried to stop david

[1:32:58] and they didn't have enough the grave
[1:33:01] didn't have enough
[1:33:02] hell didn't have enough death didn't
[1:33:04] have enough
[1:33:05] all the demons in hell didn't have
[1:33:07] enough but
[1:33:09] jesus did have enough
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:21] they tried to stop this bride
[1:33:25] but they didn't have enough
[1:33:33] you say he gave you the greatest weapon
[1:33:36] when he gave you his word
[1:33:39] if he could have give you something
[1:33:40] better
[1:33:42] he would have but he gave you a weapon
[1:33:46] that will whip the devil
[1:33:47] anytime any place under any circumstance
[1:33:53] it's enough sister sarah it's enough
[1:33:56] sister joanne
[1:33:58] what he's given you brother jim it's
[1:34:00] enough
[1:34:02] it's enough
[1:34:07] when you go into your next trial i want
[1:34:09] you to say that god's already given me
[1:34:10] enough
[1:34:11] when you're in the middle of your trial
[1:34:12] won't you say god's already given me
[1:34:14] enough
[1:34:15] when you coming out of your trial you
[1:34:17] can say god
[1:34:18] has gave me enough oh hallelujah
[1:34:23] you see he gave you his own name
[1:34:27] they tried to tell the disciples do not
[1:34:30] they condemn them from teaching
[1:34:32] in the name of jesus they tried to stop
[1:34:34] them from teaching
[1:34:36] in his own name but they didn't have
[1:34:39] enough
[1:34:40] how could you stop a man that had been
[1:34:43] blind
[1:34:44] and tell him that he could not see no
[1:34:47] more
[1:34:49] you're telling me that i can't see when
[1:34:52] i'm describing everything about you
[1:34:55] how can you tell somebody that's been
[1:34:58] made full of the quickening power
[1:35:00] of jesus christ that they need to sit
[1:35:02] down and
[1:35:03] shut up you can't do it
[1:35:07] they didn't have enough and the bible
[1:35:10] said in acts chapter 3 that when they
[1:35:12] walked in there
[1:35:13] and there was a crippled man laying
[1:35:15] there by the beautiful gate
[1:35:17] that peter and john looked on him and
[1:35:19] said silver and gold have i none
[1:35:21] but such as i have give out thee in the
[1:35:24] name of jesus christ
[1:35:25] and they tried their best to stop them
[1:35:28] from preaching
[1:35:30] but the bible said that they took
[1:35:31] knowledge that they had been with jesus
[1:35:35] i'd say that there's some demons running
[1:35:37] for cover tonight because there's a
[1:35:39] people
[1:35:39] that have been recognized that they've
[1:35:41] been with jesus
[1:35:42] and those demons are running back down
[1:35:44] to hell and they're saying
[1:35:46] satan i don't know what kind of weapon
[1:35:49] you sent us up there with
[1:35:50] but it wasn't enough
[1:35:54] you're gonna have to give us something
[1:35:56] better than that
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:36:01] oh man
[1:36:06] oh man that's too much fun
[1:36:09] they ain't got enough
[1:36:13] they ain't got enough
[1:36:16] you remember the quote brother brandon
[1:36:18] brother andrew brother ron excuse me
[1:36:21] read to you about the little boy finless
[1:36:23] there
[1:36:24] little finish boy
[1:36:30] there's been a lot of critics that rise
[1:36:31] up and say that that didn't happen
[1:36:34] but were they there no
[1:36:38] but two years before that boy ever got
[1:36:41] hit
[1:36:42] by that car there was a prophet on the
[1:36:45] other side of the ocean
[1:36:47] that had seen him in that car wreck
[1:36:50] and that car was used as a weapon
[1:36:53] to kill that boy that boy was laying
[1:36:57] there and his legs sticking through his
[1:36:59] socks
[1:37:00] looked completely hopeless but death
[1:37:02] didn't have enough to stop the vision
[1:37:05] from coming to pass
[1:37:07] brother branham would say that you could
[1:37:08] line up every default and it wouldn't
[1:37:11] have stopped that vision from happening
[1:37:14] it wouldn't have stopped it because you
[1:37:16] see if he would have had enough
[1:37:18] he'd abroad enough but he didn't have
[1:37:20] enough
[1:37:22] so we couldn't bring him and neither can
[1:37:25] he bring enough
[1:37:26] to stop the armies of the living god
[1:37:31] you're not packing your own name tonight
[1:37:33] you're packing the greatest name
[1:37:35] that's ever been named the name of jesus
[1:37:38] christ
[1:37:39] is high above every other name that
[1:37:41] every knee should bow
[1:37:42] and every tongue shall confess that
[1:37:44] jesus christ is lord
[1:37:47] demons have to bail hell has to bow
[1:37:50] cancer has to bail
[1:37:51] sickness has to bow covet has to bow
[1:37:55] in the presence of the name of jesus
[1:37:57] christ hell
[1:37:58] ain't got enough
[1:38:04] hallelujah the fbi said that they were
[1:38:08] going to expose this message
[1:38:10] but they didn't have enough because it
[1:38:12] wasn't the fbi it was too backslid
[1:38:14] preachers
[1:38:16] a maniac in portland said that he was
[1:38:18] going to stop this preacher
[1:38:19] from standing there and he was going to
[1:38:22] expose him
[1:38:23] caught him a snake in the grass spit in
[1:38:25] his face
[1:38:26] but he didn't have enough he said
[1:38:29] tonight you'll fall over my feet and
[1:38:31] that demon screamed out
[1:38:32] i'll show you whose feet you're going to
[1:38:34] fall over
[1:38:37] you see he'd made all of his threats he
[1:38:40] made all of his boats
[1:38:41] but when that little prophet rolled back
[1:38:44] his shoulder
[1:38:45] he said it come out of me he said the
[1:38:47] scripture said
[1:38:48] take no thought for what you're saying
[1:38:50] he said i heard myself
[1:38:52] saying those words he said that man fell
[1:38:56] over top of his feet
[1:38:58] and he said is that man delivered they
[1:38:59] said he said no
[1:39:01] that man worships that spirit
[1:39:05] he said but you can roll him off my feet
[1:39:15] i'm gonna help brother ron tonight
[1:39:19] hey some demons trying to pin his feet
[1:39:21] to the floor
[1:39:23] but i'ma roll him demons off of his feet

[1:39:34] the least you could do is help him roll
[1:39:36] it off of his feet
[1:39:39] the least you can do is pray and roll
[1:39:41] him off of his feet
[1:39:42] the least you could do is help shout
[1:39:44] that wall down
[1:39:46] and roll him off of his feet the least
[1:39:48] you could do
[1:39:49] is pray to an almighty god and roll that
[1:39:53] demon right out of his life

[1:40:35] he said a man in a wheelchair jumped up
[1:40:37] out of that wheelchair
[1:40:38] a woman on a cot jumped out of that
[1:40:40] stretcher and this one jumped up
[1:40:42] and that one jumped up he said what was
[1:40:44] it he said when that is
[1:40:46] when those armies of demon had watched
[1:40:48] the chief tribe of the devils
