[19:56] father this morning as brother Shannon
[19:58] praise you pray with him God bless you
[20:01] [Music]
[20:05] may I just share something with you this
[20:08] morning because
[20:10] as the Lord spoke with me I just said
[20:12] Lord if it be so
[20:14] I'd share it with y'all because it isn't
[20:16] just for me it's for us
[20:19] last week
[20:21] we were on the train and we were coming
[20:23] up the tracks
[20:24] a little Beagle dog come out into the
[20:26] track and I've asked God that
[20:29] while I'm on that train I don't want to
[20:31] take the life of no animal like that
[20:32] because it's a terrible way for them to
[20:35] have to go being hit and run over by
[20:37] that train but a dog when he gets in the
[20:39] track he won't get out he just runs that
[20:42] gauge he won't step out of it
[20:44] and it was just a young dog
[20:47] and as we come up on him and we lose
[20:49] sight of him I just bow my head there
[20:51] and I'm remembering the prayer that I
[20:54] asked the Lord that we've not take no
[20:55] life with no animal no
[20:57] I understand that this whole world
[20:59] there's life and there's death but as
[21:02] the evening progressed and I was home
[21:03] that evening and I was walking the
[21:04] neighborhood with my little dog
[21:06] the Lord started speaking to me about
[21:08] that
[21:09] and he said that dog could live
[21:13] I ain't hearing no audible voice but
[21:14] there's just something in my heart and
[21:16] it's just speaking to me
[21:17] the same angel that was with you and
[21:19] Greg
[21:20] when y'all should have died it's the
[21:22] same Angel that's on that train with you
[21:24] and that dog can be alive and I said
[21:26] Lord if it be so
[21:28] and tomorrow morning when we come up
[21:29] that track and that dog's not laying
[21:31] there I know that that angel got that
[21:33] dog out of that track and I will share
[21:35] it with the people because he also laid
[21:37] on my heart and brother Jason brought it
[21:39] up last night
[21:41] that when this bride recognizes who she
[21:43] is
[21:44] the greater things that he did what we
[21:46] do also you see that's a small thing but
[21:48] I'm telling you that dog should have
[21:49] been laying there dead but it's not it's
[21:52] alive
[21:53] and if we got the faith that we can talk
[21:56] to the Lord and he cares that much about
[21:58] these small things how much more for our
[22:00] loved ones that is fighting these
[22:01] cancers and these needs
[22:03] let's hold it in our heart let's believe

[39:43] [Applause]
[39:55] aren't you thankful that you're on the
[39:56] win inside
[39:57] I was thinking
[40:00] been thinking about it as of lately the
[40:02] last few weekends just
[40:04] just what a privilege it is to be in the
[40:06] presence of the Lord and and to see our
[40:09] young people how they're growing in the
[40:11] Lord and
[40:12] I tell you I've been I've been watching
[40:16] sister and she's not here this morning
[40:18] so it might be the best time to say it
[40:19] but I've been watching sister Erica
[40:21] Hensley's granddaughter I believe her
[40:24] name's Mia
[40:25] and
[40:27] just how sensitive that she is to the
[40:29] moving of the Holy Spirit and
[40:31] she's been here the last maybe six
[40:33] months maybe I'm not sure how long it is
[40:35] but just to see her
[40:37] so impacted by the Holy Spirit
[40:40] the we didn't ask these young people to
[40:42] come forward and to set up here we
[40:44] didn't we didn't ask our daughters we
[40:46] didn't ask our sons we didn't ask them
[40:48] to come up here but they've desired to
[40:50] be as close to the presence of the Lord
[40:51] that they can be
[40:53] and I I think it's it's an admonishing
[40:56] to to the the ministry here that to see
[40:59] these young people feel the poor the
[41:02] Holy Spirit and I tell you it's a
[41:04] blessing to watch these young people and
[41:08] and then you see people that sat there
[41:09] all their life and they're just not
[41:11] moved by it but you see somebody that's
[41:13] so influenced and it just it's you see
[41:16] the heart of a worshiper and a young
[41:19] girl like that and I just think God's
[41:21] doing specific and special things and
[41:23] what he's doing this weekend
[41:26] to have brother Jason here and brother
[41:28] Danny here they've been my friends for
[41:30] for so many so many years and we could
[41:33] go on about all the friends that we have
[41:34] in this world but there's there's
[41:36] nothing like close friends and ever
[41:38] since I was a little child we were we
[41:40] were always connected with the steaming
[41:42] family and and I always thought even
[41:45] when I wasn't living right if I if I
[41:46] could ever if I ever wanted to be a real
[41:49] Christian or if I wanted to look up to
[41:50] somebody I could really look up to
[41:52] brother Danny steaman and he's just he's
[41:54] a man that wants you he he just he makes
[41:57] you feel like a real Christian he makes
[41:59] you feel like you're important and
[42:01] that's the person brother Brandon would
[42:03] tell us about you find out if who makes
[42:05] you important is the man that the man
[42:07] that's great is the one that makes you
[42:09] feel important and brother Danny has
[42:11] such a powerful Ministry and he's been
[42:14] such a friend and I tell you
[42:16] serving our Lord Jesus Christ is the
[42:18] best thing that we've ever done in this
[42:21] life would you stand with us this
[42:23] morning we invite the ministry to come
[42:24] this morning I'd like to sing that song
[42:26] Stay
[42:31] know what it's like

[49:55] Fellowship in Sarasota Florida and the
[49:58] Spencer family has has just been a part
[50:01] of our lives for many years now he's
[50:04] trying to remember how long it was and
[50:06] we came up with 1995 if you're counting
[50:09] that's 27 years it's been a long time
[50:11] and first met brother Ron and he was
[50:14] evangelizing in that time and and
[50:18] come down to our church and ministered
[50:21] there and the rest has been history we
[50:23] just have a close Bond and a real love
[50:25] for for brother Ron and his family when
[50:28] I first met him all of his children were
[50:30] small
[50:31] now his grandchildren are growing up so
[50:33] this is how long it's been and I was
[50:36] young and my children were small now
[50:38] they're grown up and they have children
[50:40] and so it just time doesn't stop but
[50:43] what's wonderful is to see the same God
[50:45] that we serve then
[50:47] still the same God now
[50:49] and our love hasn't we haven't lost our
[50:52] love for him it's grown stronger and
[50:54] stronger what a day we're living in amen
[50:58] and what a privilege it is to be in this
[50:59] day you know we begin to understand a
[51:02] little bit when when we hear a prophet
[51:05] say that all the sages and all the
[51:07] prophets if they could have chosen what
[51:09] time to live and they'd have took your
[51:11] place
[51:12] they'd have said on the front row they
[51:13] would have been here they would have
[51:15] sung these songs and they'd all said
[51:17] Moses David every one of them say I want
[51:19] to live in this time this is the
[51:21] greatest hour it may be the weakest the
[51:24] darkest the most perverted hour amen but
[51:27] it's because the darkness has been
[51:28] condensed because the light is pressing
[51:31] it
[51:32] and it's going home time Hallelujah and
[51:35] he's not going to lose one of us I'm so
[51:37] glad of that so Hallelujah so God bless

[52:50] sing very much anymore and we used to
[52:53] when we was evangelizing we used to go
[52:55] around and sing a lot and and preach and
[52:58] and there's something about when you

[55:32] be careful
[55:34] amen
[55:36] I'm preaching with this lapel mic this

[55:40] other mic was get very loud and and it
[55:44] forgot time so we're going to try to use
[55:47] this this lapel amen
[55:51] praise the Lord
[55:56] that's not the right thing to say before
[55:58] you preach oh is it amen
[56:02] I want a title this morning the Triumph
[56:05] of the woman's seed the Triumph of the
[56:09] woman's seat I've been ministering for
[56:11] quite some time on a subject to home
[56:13] called The Trail Of The Serpent and this
[56:15] is something in the course of the those
[56:17] services that the Lord brought me to and
[56:20] we just want to the help of the Lord as
[56:22] we studying on this this uh Saturday and
[56:25] uh just bring it to you this morning
[56:27] amen First John 3 the 7th verse
[56:30] little children let no man deceive you
[56:34] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[56:37] even as he is righteous
[56:40] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[56:42] for the devil's sinneth from the
[56:45] beginning
[56:46] for this purpose the Son of God was
[56:48] manifested that he might destroy the
[56:52] works of the devil
[56:54] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[56:57] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[57:01] cannot sin because because he is born of
[57:04] God
[57:05] in this the children of God are manifest
[57:08] and the children of the devil whosoever
[57:11] doeth not righteousness is not of God
[57:14] neither he that loveth not his brother
[57:18] amen you may be seated may the Lord
[57:20] bless the reading of his word
[57:25] at the time of
[57:27] the writing
[57:29] sure it's been somewhere around
[57:33] are over 4 000 years
[57:37] since the prophecy that was made in the
[57:40] Garden of Eden
[57:42] the Lord speaking to the serpent and and
[57:47] he would tell him that I will put enmity
[57:49] between thee and the woman and between
[57:53] thy seed and her seed and it shall
[57:57] bruise thy head
[57:59] and thou shalt bruise his heel that
[58:03] prophecy came forth in a very dark hour
[58:06] it came forth when the condition was
[58:10] upon Adam and Eve a Darkness had come it
[58:14] was a fallen condition it was man had
[58:17] lost the consciousness of his presence
[58:19] they had lost their their their Estates
[58:22] they didn't know who they were anymore
[58:24] now they was in fear of God and they
[58:26] made themselves the Fig leaves to cover
[58:28] themselves up amen but they needed
[58:31] somebody greater than them to come down
[58:33] and begin to show them amen that's not
[58:36] the covering I accept and and that's not
[58:38] the way it's going to be and and he
[58:41] spoke a prophecy in that moment and and
[58:44] he spoke it to the serpent and he spoke
[58:46] it to the woman that there will be
[58:48] enmity between your seed amen but amen
[58:52] the woman's seed will bruise amen the
[58:55] the head of The Serpent and the serpent
[58:58] will bruise the heel of of the uh of the
[59:02] woman's seed so we see that has been
[59:04] that enmity and there's been that
[59:06] conflict since the beginning of time
[59:10] and that conflict never stopped at
[59:13] Calvary
[59:14] amen but it moved on because amen the
[59:17] woman's seed would have a seed
[59:21] amen now we understand that amen the New
[59:24] Testament without the Old Testament it's
[59:25] not going to be understood
[59:27] amen and neither without the Old
[59:29] Testament without the New Testament the
[59:31] Old Testament cannot know its
[59:32] fulfillment so to take both of them they
[59:35] come become a whole amen and then to
[59:38] take both of them you see the full
[59:40] revelation of who Jesus Christ is amen
[59:43] the Old Testament was amen the prophecy
[59:46] gone forth he is coming
[59:49] he is coming
[59:50] he is coming the New Testament has been
[59:53] he is here he has been here he was here
[59:57] he was here and not just speaking it but
[1:00:01] validating it and conferring it
[1:00:04] praise the name of the Lord we've come
[1:00:07] to a special time amen and if you bear
[1:00:09] with me this morning I'm going to move
[1:00:11] I'm in pretty fast we have we have come
[1:00:13] to a special time this time is called
[1:00:16] Harvest Time
[1:00:17] not just the Harvest of a of an age but
[1:00:21] the Harvest of the world
[1:00:25] is that right and two vines that grew
[1:00:28] together from the Garden of Eden and had
[1:00:31] enmity with one another intertwined amen
[1:00:34] has come all the way down to this time
[1:00:37] and they have come to their Harvest time
[1:00:39] and it is the time of Separation that's
[1:00:43] the time we're living in now the time of
[1:00:45] Separation one is separating to their
[1:00:48] Harvest and the other is separating to
[1:00:51] their Harvest
[1:00:52] praise the name of the Lord one is being
[1:00:55] bound and taken away the other has been
[1:00:58] gathered together amen so the combine
[1:01:01] can come and pick us up
[1:01:03] that's why we're here
[1:01:05] praise the name of the Lord
[1:01:07] amen the prophet of God said that those
[1:01:10] fruits of those Vines which were at such
[1:01:12] variance will be gathered into separate
[1:01:14] Garners and the two spirits will go to
[1:01:18] their separate destinations
[1:01:20] now we can going all the way back to the
[1:01:23] Garden of Eden I know I mean this has
[1:01:25] been a controversial subject amen
[1:01:27] through through the church ages amen but
[1:01:29] it took a prophet to come Amen in the
[1:01:32] Holy Spirit to show him and bring to
[1:01:34] light amen that the seed of the serpent
[1:01:37] that came in the Book of Genesis he was
[1:01:41] born and I want you to notice he was
[1:01:43] born apart amen from human male
[1:01:47] instrumentality
[1:01:50] right amen the the seed and the serpent
[1:01:53] came amen apart from human male uh
[1:01:58] instrumentality and then in the Book of
[1:02:00] Luke we find the exact account how the
[1:02:04] seed of the woman came apart amen from
[1:02:08] human male instrumentality amen one came
[1:02:12] by the by Satan and the other one came
[1:02:15] by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:19] two spirits
[1:02:21] amen one produced what we know and
[1:02:24] called serpent seat
[1:02:26] and you have to be careful what you call
[1:02:28] serpent seat
[1:02:30] amen because you look like serpent seat
[1:02:34] you say no not me I I wore a long dress
[1:02:36] on my life I had long hair on my life
[1:02:38] it's not that
[1:02:40] it's not a put on Holiness and it's not
[1:02:43] what you've done amen that makes you who
[1:02:46] you are it's who you accept it that
[1:02:50] makes you who you are I want to tell you
[1:02:52] something this morning you can stand in
[1:02:54] a place where the devil amen will not
[1:02:57] know what to do with you because there's
[1:03:00] not a part of your life amen that has
[1:03:02] not been uncovered by the Holy Ghost
[1:03:06] hey man that's the hour we're living in
[1:03:08] if this is the hour of the Harvest amen
[1:03:11] we have come to our fruition amen we
[1:03:14] have the fruits have come to the top
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:19] it is here that God vindicates Amen what
[1:03:23] is prophecy was from the very beginning
[1:03:26] if it had stopped in Jesus Christ it
[1:03:29] would not have been enough but he came
[1:03:31] so that he could bring many sons unto
[1:03:34] God
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:38] and those sons that would come to God
[1:03:40] for many of them they would look like
[1:03:43] they came from the other side
[1:03:46] they would talk like they would come
[1:03:48] from the other side they would act like
[1:03:51] they came from the other side
[1:03:56] now the woman
[1:03:58] Eve
[1:04:01] she thought that
[1:04:03] that Cain came from God
[1:04:07] and you will find that there's a long
[1:04:09] time
[1:04:10] the prophet said that it took her a
[1:04:12] while
[1:04:13] to understand that Cain did not come
[1:04:15] from God
[1:04:16] the life that he had
[1:04:19] The Gift of Life came from God
[1:04:22] but the seed did not come from God
[1:04:27] you know perhaps she was confused
[1:04:29] because she looked at Cain and Abel and
[1:04:32] she said when Cain was born I've gotten
[1:04:34] a man from the Lord and then amen when
[1:04:36] the scripture says and then she bear
[1:04:37] Abel
[1:04:39] and she never said that about Abel
[1:04:42] but she said it about Cain which shows
[1:04:45] the the church amen is confused
[1:04:49] about the life
[1:04:51] and where it comes from and I read you
[1:04:54] the scripture first John he said he that
[1:04:57] is uh committed sin is of the devil now
[1:05:01] what is John talking about he's talking
[1:05:02] about two births
[1:05:05] he's talking about one that is born in
[1:05:07] sin and he's talking another one about a
[1:05:09] new birth
[1:05:11] that's what he's talking about every one
[1:05:14] of you were partakers of the first one
[1:05:17] there's not a person in here including
[1:05:19] every one of us sitting on the platform
[1:05:21] to say we were exempt from being born in
[1:05:23] sin shaping an iniquity come to the
[1:05:26] world speaking lies every one of us came
[1:05:28] like that amen the way of sin was
[1:05:31] already in us the habits of sin the
[1:05:33] hereditary things the ancestral things
[1:05:36] was already in US amen and we were
[1:05:39] committing sin and we were of the devil
[1:05:44] in our life
[1:05:45] but not in our election
[1:05:50] in our life but not in our election
[1:05:54] Amen in our election would become known
[1:05:56] by the word that was sent to the age
[1:05:59] [Applause]
[1:06:01] that's the only way we could know what
[1:06:03] election was is if the voice of God had
[1:06:06] a special sound to us in our heart and
[1:06:08] it might have took a long time for you
[1:06:10] as a Son of God to recognize that voice
[1:06:12] you might have confused that voice with
[1:06:14] the preacher or somebody else but one
[1:06:17] day you realized it was not the high
[1:06:19] priest it was the voice of God that has
[1:06:21] been speaking to you all along
[1:06:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:30] amen and that enemy that held you could
[1:06:33] not keep you
[1:06:42] what what came out of what came out of
[1:06:45] of of Eve what come out of the out of
[1:06:48] her womb
[1:06:49] it was named Cain
[1:06:51] grew listen
[1:06:54] that mankane had the opportunity just
[1:06:58] like you and I have the opportunity
[1:07:02] to be serpent seed does not mean you do
[1:07:05] not hear the message of your hour
[1:07:08] he heard his message face to face with
[1:07:11] God felt the presence of God heard the
[1:07:15] voice of God and knew the will of God
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:21] come on
[1:07:22] but to him it was another Sunday morning
[1:07:25] sermon
[1:07:26] another Thou shalt not do this or Thou
[1:07:30] shalt not do that and who are you to
[1:07:32] tell me that I should act like my
[1:07:34] brother
[1:07:36] you see because God told him amen he
[1:07:39] said if you give a sacrifice like your
[1:07:41] brother gave a sacrifice I will accept
[1:07:44] you what a mercy that God would tell
[1:07:47] serpency amen the serpent son I will
[1:07:50] accept you God wasn't playing with words
[1:07:53] God was not saying I don't really mean
[1:07:56] that when he told the Serpent's son I
[1:07:59] will accept you that man I will give you
[1:08:01] the benefit of my presence I'll give you
[1:08:03] the benefit of my healing I'll give you
[1:08:05] the benefit of my attributes I'll even
[1:08:08] save you
[1:08:09] [Applause]
[1:08:12] hello
[1:08:13] but in the presence of God
[1:08:16] Cain could not accept it
[1:08:19] and when it came when the when the
[1:08:21] satanic Spirit came from Heaven to Earth
[1:08:24] it had even more of a Defiance on Earth
[1:08:28] than it even had in heaven
[1:08:32] because the characteristics of Cain his
[1:08:35] utter defiance
[1:08:37] in the presence of God that he would
[1:08:40] speak back to God the way he did
[1:08:43] wouldn't and and and he was willing hey
[1:08:46] man he was willing to to break the word
[1:08:50] of God
[1:08:52] and kill his brother
[1:08:56] you find the accountant amen you find
[1:08:59] here in the in the Book of Genesis the
[1:09:01] third chapter in the fourth chapter amen
[1:09:03] you find
[1:09:04] excuse me I'm over 50 I got to get my
[1:09:06] breath
[1:09:07] you'll find amen the mark of the beast
[1:09:13] amen placed upon a man
[1:09:16] and what did the prophets say it was the
[1:09:19] mark of the beast was a man went out
[1:09:20] from the presence of the Lord and could
[1:09:22] never hear his word again
[1:09:25] to receive it
[1:09:28] the Bible says the soul that sinneth thy
[1:09:30] Soul shall die
[1:09:31] what that means the very desire to hear
[1:09:33] it
[1:09:34] the effect of it will have no effect
[1:09:36] upon your desire anymore
[1:09:39] your soul becomes so hard
[1:09:41] amen that the word would have no effect
[1:09:43] that's why it's a blessing brother and
[1:09:46] sister amen that you stand in the
[1:09:48] presence of the Lord and it moves you
[1:09:51] and he's not here just to move you and
[1:09:54] to excite you we all love that
[1:09:56] hey I came out of a church and didn't
[1:09:58] even believe in saying amen so we love
[1:10:00] it we love to be moved by the Holy
[1:10:03] Spirit but if there's Holy Spirit he
[1:10:05] leads us he's got a goal
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:09] amen if you're here sick he wants to
[1:10:11] lead you amen from sickness unto Health
[1:10:13] if you're here and you're not believing
[1:10:16] he wants to lead you from doubt to
[1:10:18] belief
[1:10:20] that's what the holy spirit is here for
[1:10:23] hey man just to just to uh to make a
[1:10:27] make a declaration of what what God came
[1:10:30] to do he said now when man was made in
[1:10:33] the image of God
[1:10:35] a man was Jesus Christ and God came down
[1:10:37] in the image of man to redeem man
[1:10:40] and that brought man and God together
[1:10:43] Heaven and Earth hugged
[1:10:46] and kissed each other
[1:10:48] God and man embraced each other as
[1:10:51] fatherhood and sonship when the logos
[1:10:53] became flesh and dwelt Among Us right
[1:10:57] Jesus could say I come from God and I go
[1:11:00] back to God
[1:11:01] and after his death and burial and
[1:11:03] resurrection and Ascension when the body
[1:11:05] was taken up he said at the right hand
[1:11:07] of God now it doesn't mean that God's
[1:11:09] got a right hand because God is a spirit
[1:11:12] amen but what it means that all power
[1:11:14] and authority of God is in Jesus Christ
[1:11:19] that every name everything in heaven is
[1:11:23] named after it and subject to it
[1:11:25] everything in Earth is named after it
[1:11:28] and subject to it it's a name above all
[1:11:30] names Jesus Christ
[1:11:32] now the logos that was in him which was
[1:11:36] the spirit of God the anointing through
[1:11:38] the sanctifying grace of the blood
[1:11:40] brought many sons to God which is
[1:11:44] Anointed with the same logos
[1:11:47] now we see the purpose of God Amen was
[1:11:50] to bring you Amen to the place amen that
[1:11:53] you would understand you are anointed
[1:11:56] with the same word because that's the
[1:11:59] logos you're Anointed with the same word
[1:12:02] that was in him
[1:12:06] now I have the right then if I'm
[1:12:08] Anointed with the same word the same
[1:12:10] same word that Jesus Christ is I have
[1:12:13] the right thing to recognize Satan and
[1:12:15] who he is and tell him what to do
[1:12:21] well Satan will understand about you
[1:12:23] that he has certain rights about your
[1:12:25] flesh he can still make you sick he can
[1:12:29] still Place doubts in your mind
[1:12:32] come on
[1:12:33] I had a man tell me the other day he
[1:12:35] said I know the thoughts I have are from
[1:12:36] Jesus Christ because Satan doesn't know
[1:12:37] my thoughts I said man you sure don't
[1:12:39] know Satan
[1:12:42] come on
[1:12:44] yeah Satan knows how to put thoughts
[1:12:46] this is the greatest I tell you I
[1:12:47] figured out brother that man never
[1:12:49] listened to greatest battle ever fought
[1:12:51] did I say fault of thought amen it's the
[1:12:53] same thing amen because amen this is the
[1:12:56] Battleground
[1:12:57] this is the place of neutrality amen
[1:13:00] where God and Satan chose to make your
[1:13:03] mind the battleground of their thoughts
[1:13:06] that Satan would Place thoughts there
[1:13:07] you can never be healed you can never be
[1:13:10] delivered you can't have the Holy Ghost
[1:13:11] it's not for you and God would place his
[1:13:14] word there I came I healed you I sent my
[1:13:17] words
[1:13:18] come on you're under my delivering power
[1:13:21] right now amen I am here to set you free
[1:13:25] and Satan will say no he's not and God
[1:13:28] will say yes I am and whichever way you
[1:13:30] choose that's the way it's going to be
[1:13:32] this morning
[1:13:38] God did not come here just to have a
[1:13:40] protracted service but he gave every
[1:13:42] minister of this age an Open Door of
[1:13:45] word and power amen and he expects a
[1:13:48] harvest of that word
[1:13:53] Satan right now amen is being robbed of
[1:13:57] his subjects
[1:14:01] because hell has been conquered death
[1:14:04] has been conquered the grave has been
[1:14:07] conquered there's not a place in life
[1:14:09] that Jesus Christ never conquered
[1:14:12] I can meet it this morning then and know
[1:14:15] amen I am more than a conqueror amen I
[1:14:18] can do all things through Christ
[1:14:21] foreign
[1:14:27] I don't even know how to get my coat off
[1:14:29] this morning in Mennonite Church they
[1:14:30] never taught us how to take our coat off
[1:14:40] Now by his Spirit he is creating many
[1:14:44] sons unto himself
[1:14:48] this is what his spirit is doing this
[1:14:50] morning
[1:14:51] God the Creator created himself a part
[1:14:55] of the creation this is the true
[1:14:57] revelation of God
[1:14:59] this was his purpose
[1:15:02] now John said this
[1:15:04] is his purpose
[1:15:06] that he would be manifested
[1:15:09] that we would destroy the works of the
[1:15:12] devil
[1:15:19] this purpose
[1:15:21] took form through election
[1:15:24] that is why I love this statement
[1:15:28] that the prophet said that is why he
[1:15:30] could look down all the way to the last
[1:15:32] age
[1:15:33] amen when all would be over and see
[1:15:37] himself
[1:15:38] still
[1:15:39] in the midst of the church not the
[1:15:42] church that put him out
[1:15:44] but the church that glorifies him
[1:15:46] they would still see him there as the
[1:15:49] author of this new creation of God his
[1:15:53] Sovereign power is bringing it to pass
[1:15:54] and I love what brother Ram said about
[1:15:56] the Sovereign will of God nobody can
[1:15:58] tell him what to do
[1:16:00] nobody can say he's not worthy of that
[1:16:03] salvation or amen you shouldn't forgive
[1:16:05] a man like that and that person over
[1:16:08] there strung out for years he don't have
[1:16:10] no right to Deliverance or that person
[1:16:12] over there with a sex habit he has no
[1:16:14] way of Deliverance you see it's not
[1:16:16] based on your flesh it's not based on
[1:16:19] your worthiness it's based on Jesus
[1:16:22] Christ I am not saved in myself I am
[1:16:26] saved through Jesus Christ
[1:16:31] if I'm speaking to somebody like that we
[1:16:34] give notice to the enemy this morning
[1:16:36] amen you're losing another subject
[1:16:44] devil will tell you you've done too much
[1:16:47] you've marked yourself up you've lost
[1:16:49] your your virtue you have no right you
[1:16:51] there's nobody gonna love you I want you
[1:16:53] to know the Bible said when you were yet
[1:16:55] in sin amen he died for you even how can
[1:16:59] I love him because he first loved me
[1:17:05] he loved me so much that he would allow
[1:17:08] me to preach a message of Love Back to
[1:17:11] his children
[1:17:14] we are not going to settle for less
[1:17:17] brother and sister we're going to take
[1:17:19] all that the Holy Spirit has
[1:17:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:17:30] I could look all the way down into this
[1:17:32] age and still see his church giving him
[1:17:35] glory
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:46] all right
[1:17:55] Jesus said the works I do
[1:17:58] you shall do also
[1:18:01] we've seen the church lay hands on the
[1:18:03] sick we see Devils come out at the
[1:18:05] mention of his name we see people shout
[1:18:08] and rejoice and speak in a new tongue we
[1:18:10] see all these things but that's not the
[1:18:13] only works Jesus done
[1:18:15] amen one of his Works was get behind me
[1:18:18] Satan you shall not tempt the Lord thy
[1:18:21] God Amen he knew when Satan was quoting
[1:18:24] the word wrong
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:29] I just want to make a statement
[1:18:31] amen that when Jesus met him on the
[1:18:34] mountain he met him for you
[1:18:35] and when he met him on the mountain
[1:18:37] after 40 days Jesus was at his weak as
[1:18:40] Satan was at a strongest
[1:18:43] and suicidal thoughts and thoughts of
[1:18:46] glory and and hunger was consuming him
[1:18:50] Satan began to talk to him
[1:18:54] begin to tempt him
[1:18:56] I want you to know every time Jesus
[1:18:58] answered there's three accounts brother
[1:19:00] Benham said it directly corresponds amen
[1:19:03] with the Temptation and the fall in the
[1:19:04] garden the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:19:07] the eyes amen and the pride of life
[1:19:09] every one of them give your life glory
[1:19:12] and and and the sin the lust of the
[1:19:15] flesh amen indulge those appetites first
[1:19:18] oh
[1:19:19] man all these things were flooding Jesus
[1:19:22] Christ
[1:19:23] amen if you go back and read those
[1:19:25] accounts of Jesus answering Satan he
[1:19:28] only answered him out of one book
[1:19:33] he only took a few a few verses out of
[1:19:35] the book of Deuteronomy
[1:19:38] and there is some dispute that that is
[1:19:40] even enough an authentic book
[1:19:44] I love that
[1:19:47] that God would take something that the
[1:19:49] scholars would doubt would be authentic
[1:19:51] and God would take it
[1:19:54] [Applause]
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:55] in just a few verses
[1:19:58] amen he didn't take the whole Bible he
[1:20:01] took a few verses and defeated Satan
[1:20:05] [Applause]
[1:20:10] amen what if you as a church turn the
[1:20:13] full power of the word upon the enemy
[1:20:15] this morning
[1:20:18] I'm not just turning on in Deuteronomy 8
[1:20:20] or one of these verses I can turn upon
[1:20:23] Him Isaiah 53 I can turn upon Him Isaiah
[1:20:26] 61. I can turn upon Him Malachi 4 I can
[1:20:29] turn upon Him Luke 17 30. I can turn
[1:20:31] upon Him Revelations 10 7. full barrels
[1:20:34] drop the bomb
[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:41] foreign
[1:20:44] Hallelujah
[1:20:46] now Jesus said the works I do you shall
[1:20:48] do also see amen the same God the works
[1:20:51] I do more than this for I go into my
[1:20:53] father the church will be a little
[1:20:55] longer in the light
[1:20:59] vindicating his promised word
[1:21:02] Jesus was here for just a short period
[1:21:05] of time
[1:21:07] and his life made such an impact on
[1:21:10] Earth
[1:21:11] that he split time into
[1:21:19] what Jesus did not come to live he came
[1:21:21] to die
[1:21:23] so that we could live this morning
[1:21:26] somebody totally different than any
[1:21:28] other man
[1:21:29] he came to die from the beginning he was
[1:21:32] telling them I if I be lifted up
[1:21:35] the son of man must be lifted up
[1:21:38] he kept telling him I have come to die
[1:21:41] in other words I have come to take your
[1:21:44] place oh we need a savior to Deliver Us
[1:21:46] from Rome no you need a savior to
[1:21:48] deliver you from Hell amen raw hell is
[1:21:51] much greater than Rome
[1:21:56] Rome is just an attribute of hell
[1:21:59] amen but it's not the Final Destination
[1:22:03] so now the prophet says that the church
[1:22:05] will be a little longer in the light see
[1:22:07] as God did his promises in Christ's body
[1:22:10] so is Christ doing his same Works in his
[1:22:14] body the church now making his mystery
[1:22:18] known to his bride tree in the last day
[1:22:20] bringing forth the fruits that was in
[1:22:23] the tree at the beginning
[1:22:25] well I tell you this this is the holy
[1:22:27] spirit's leading this is what he's doing
[1:22:31] he said then he goes on to say that the
[1:22:33] bride body must follow the head for it
[1:22:36] is part of his resurrection and part of
[1:22:38] the mystery you know people said here
[1:22:40] and they will spend all their lives
[1:22:42] trying to figure out the mystery and the
[1:22:44] prophet said you're part of it
[1:22:49] you are part of the mystery
[1:22:53] amen it's how God has revealed himself
[1:22:57] here and raised up the body by the word
[1:23:00] so he Reveals His church and he raises
[1:23:03] her up by the same word it's part of his
[1:23:05] threefold mystery now I know you're well
[1:23:08] taught here and you've listened to the
[1:23:10] to the message brother Branham said that
[1:23:12] three-fold mystery you'll find that in
[1:23:14] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:23:16] said number one it was to reveal himself
[1:23:17] in Christ God above us amen couldn't be
[1:23:20] understood or or felt but God wanted to
[1:23:22] be known God wanted to be more than just
[1:23:25] this great being who was above them that
[1:23:26] could not be understood he wanted to
[1:23:28] come and rub shoulders and be a part of
[1:23:30] the Affliction and and it'd even be said
[1:23:32] of him amen that he um and I wish I
[1:23:35] could remember what was said of him
[1:23:38] the one scripture
[1:23:40] about our afflictions what is it
[1:23:43] see they don't know that you know
[1:23:45] preachers are the most least informed
[1:23:47] people on the face of the earth when
[1:23:48] they're up here sometimes
[1:23:50] amen I hate it when a preacher turns to
[1:23:52] me and says where is that chapter
[1:23:53] because I can't think of it then but I
[1:23:55] knew it but I can't think of it amen
[1:23:58] but the Bible said he tasted the same
[1:24:00] things you tasted
[1:24:01] that you have a high priest who is
[1:24:03] touched by the feeling of your
[1:24:04] infirmities he knows exactly and that's
[1:24:07] not mean that he just he just knows
[1:24:09] yours brother Shannon it means he knows
[1:24:11] yours and he knows yours and he knows
[1:24:14] yours you can go down the line there's
[1:24:15] not a person in this room that has
[1:24:17] escaped his understanding

[1:24:49] that does you might say I'll never be
[1:24:52] like that but if you're sitting here

[1:26:37] days of Noah this is the days of Noah
[1:26:39] that's really what they're saying
[1:26:45] but yet

[1:26:49] it's of this present Darkness it catches
[1:26:51] seeds

[1:27:07] great to me
[1:27:09] and no I don't remember what exactly
[1:27:10] chapter it was in the book of Exodus but
[1:27:12] you'll go find it
[1:27:14] you remember when it was
[1:27:16] when Moses went down and told them let
[1:27:19] my people go that they may serve me
[1:27:22] Pharaoh stood up
[1:27:24] and he said I'm not going to let him go
[1:27:26] and I don't know your God
[1:27:30] you know amen it was an age they didn't
[1:27:32] know who who God was
[1:27:35] because they didn't know his power
[1:27:40] so it just seemed it just seemed like it
[1:27:43] was something randomly placed in the
[1:27:45] scripture because then right in the same
[1:27:48] chapter I think it's around chapter six
[1:27:49] somewhere around there amen you go look
[1:27:51] it up for yourself and and right there
[1:27:54] it places a genealogy
[1:27:57] it's amazing pharah says I'm not going
[1:27:59] to let him go
[1:28:01] and then God begins to give the
[1:28:02] genealogies of the Levites oh well what
[1:28:05] in the world has that got to do with
[1:28:06] this Satan just made a huge claim I'm
[1:28:09] not letting them go and God wants to
[1:28:10] count people
[1:28:11] don't even make sense to me
[1:28:14] why would God want to count people when
[1:28:16] Satan says I'm not letting you go
[1:28:18] I'll tell you exactly why because God
[1:28:20] knows exactly who's his and this is way
[1:28:22] of saying amen this is mine this one
[1:28:24] comes from this one this one comes from
[1:28:25] that one that one comes from this one
[1:28:26] that one comes from that one Satan said
[1:28:28] I'm not letting you go and God said this
[1:28:29] one came for me this one came from me
[1:28:31] this one came from me this one came from
[1:28:32] me this one came from me this one came
[1:28:34] from me amen there is nothing going to
[1:28:37] stop the election of God
[1:28:41] nothing
[1:28:42] no drugs no sin no devil Satan himself
[1:28:48] all the powers of Hell nothing will stop
[1:28:51] the election
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:29:00] blessed be the name of the Lord I had a
[1:29:02] brother tell me this a pastor
[1:29:05] he's dealing with a situation in his
[1:29:07] church or
[1:29:08] where a
[1:29:10] uh one of his members
[1:29:14] was caught having an affair
[1:29:16] with another man
[1:29:18] both of these men were married one was
[1:29:20] from The Message Church one was from a
[1:29:22] denomination
[1:29:23] both of these men
[1:29:26] did not want to be in their situation
[1:29:27] they was in they wanted to be free they
[1:29:30] were secretly
[1:29:31] secretly getting counsel
[1:29:36] going to
[1:29:37] family helps or psychologists or whoever
[1:29:40] they were going to to try try to get
[1:29:42] help and nothing would change for them
[1:29:46] and then it began to be exposed then it
[1:29:49] began to came out you understand both
[1:29:50] these men were family men had children
[1:29:51] you understand the effect the bomb
[1:29:54] effect
[1:29:57] the bombshell effect
[1:29:59] what it would do on those children you
[1:30:01] see when Satan is afflicting you he's
[1:30:03] actually trying to afflict your heritage
[1:30:09] because he wants it to be a testimony
[1:30:12] they had the Bible it didn't work they
[1:30:14] had the message it didn't stop them from
[1:30:15] committing adultery that's what he does
[1:30:18] is he puts everything on display like
[1:30:19] Samson in the Wheelhouse grinding for
[1:30:21] the enemy amen with his eyes put out
[1:30:23] here's this great warrior now as a
[1:30:25] trophy and what did they say our God has
[1:30:28] got the victory over Jehovah it's always
[1:30:30] Satan's purpose our God
[1:30:33] the world is more powerful
[1:30:37] so this
[1:30:39] this came out
[1:30:41] and this pastor's testimony was he was
[1:30:43] talking to this man in his congregation
[1:30:45] on the phone
[1:30:48] and this man was
[1:30:50] complaining
[1:30:52] about his situation nobody understands
[1:30:56] that's one thing the devil wants to
[1:30:58] afflict you with it
[1:30:59] and I in in a pastoral position I'm sure
[1:31:01] you've heard it here it might be
[1:31:03] something exclusive to Florida I don't
[1:31:05] know where people tell me you don't
[1:31:07] understand
[1:31:08] and I always tell them and if I and they
[1:31:12] say that because they're saying I didn't
[1:31:13] go through that I you're not the one
[1:31:15] that committed adultery I'm the one that
[1:31:17] committed auction I always want to tell
[1:31:18] them you're right if I did I would not
[1:31:21] be here and you wouldn't be talking to
[1:31:23] me
[1:31:26] so why complain to me like that
[1:31:29] you're wasting time
[1:31:32] but you should understand that I
[1:31:34] represent one who has all the answers
[1:31:40] I am not going to point to you brother
[1:31:42] William to a plaque on the wall and tell
[1:31:44] you where I learned it I'm going to
[1:31:47] point to you the one who sent his word
[1:31:49] and healed your disease
[1:31:56] so that's an Affliction well it's
[1:31:58] Affliction of the righteous you don't
[1:32:00] understand
[1:32:01] it's really an excuse
[1:32:03] and that's actually satanic talk saying
[1:32:06] I don't want to be free
[1:32:07] because if it can say the pastor don't
[1:32:10] even understand well we'll find a
[1:32:12] sympathizing devil that'll go along with
[1:32:13] it and say yeah we knew he never
[1:32:15] understood that guy
[1:32:17] you see that's the devil that's the
[1:32:19] trail of the serpent
[1:32:21] that he hides upon see that was one of
[1:32:24] the Mysteries spoken of in proverbs 30
[1:32:26] that that that man by the name agor
[1:32:29] he gave he said one of the four things
[1:32:32] that are wonderful too wonderful for him
[1:32:33] is one of them was a serpent upon a rock
[1:32:36] a way it's just hid it just leaves no
[1:32:38] trail of his passing but there's one who
[1:32:40] doesn't know that trail and it's the
[1:32:42] Holy Spirit
[1:32:44] and so this Pastor said I I began to
[1:32:47] tell that man
[1:32:49] that man's saying you don't understand
[1:32:50] what it's like to be attracted to
[1:32:52] another man and and the pastor says
[1:32:54] you're right
[1:32:55] you're right I don't understand he said
[1:32:57] right at that time I felt the Holy
[1:32:58] Spirit tap me on the shoulder
[1:33:00] and say you tell him I understand
[1:33:08] no no
[1:33:12] Holy Spirit wouldn't understand what
[1:33:14] it's like to be tempted by homosexuality
[1:33:18] Woody
[1:33:20] Woody
[1:33:24] and what did it mean in the Bible it
[1:33:25] says all manner
[1:33:28] yet without sin in other words that
[1:33:31] Spirit of that age presented itself to
[1:33:34] Jesus
[1:33:36] in a provocative and attractive manner
[1:33:39] and Jesus met him with thus saith the
[1:33:42] Lord
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:45] all right
[1:33:48] I want you to know the power of the word
[1:33:52] when that Pastor followed what the holy
[1:33:55] because that's a strange one it's a
[1:33:56] challenge for a pastor to say that when
[1:33:58] that Pastor followed the leading of the
[1:34:00] Holy Spirit you tell him you tell him I
[1:34:03] understand when he repeated that to that
[1:34:06] man that the Holy Spirit just told me to
[1:34:07] tell you
[1:34:10] phone went quiet
[1:34:13] then he began to hear that man break up
[1:34:16] begin to weep then the Holy Spirit came
[1:34:19] in and totally delivered that man
[1:34:23] now
[1:34:24] I want to say something else
[1:34:26] it didn't just deliver that man it
[1:34:28] delivered the damn
[1:34:31] both of those men went and stood in
[1:34:34] their home pulpits and and repented to
[1:34:36] the church for their sin and God
[1:34:39] restored both of those men and that
[1:34:41] man's testimony was we've spent hours in
[1:34:44] the in the offices of these medical
[1:34:46] professionals and we've not got any help
[1:34:49] but five minutes in the presence of God
[1:34:54] I want you to know I'm in the presence
[1:34:57] of a god that'll just point a finger and
[1:34:59] the demons will flee
[1:35:07] every devil is subject to the name Jesus
[1:35:10] Christ don't say that name Jesus Christ
[1:35:13] don't say that name Jesus Christ
[1:35:18] they cannot stand before the power of
[1:35:21] that name
[1:35:28] the prophet said that
[1:35:31] we are his body
[1:35:33] the manifested truth
[1:35:35] of his promised word for the last days
[1:35:38] we are his body the manifested truth of
[1:35:42] his promised word to his last days this
[1:35:45] was brother branham's way of saying the
[1:35:47] same thing that Paul said you are living
[1:35:48] Epistles
[1:35:49] read and known of all men people know
[1:35:52] amen what Paul believes by the way you
[1:35:54] live
[1:35:57] now Christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:36:00] works of the devil you believe that
[1:36:03] amen he was manifested to destroy his
[1:36:06] works
[1:36:07] who was he God's word
[1:36:11] which destroys the hybrid
[1:36:14] The Works of the devil
[1:36:17] is that right he was born to be that to
[1:36:20] destroy the works of the devil
[1:36:24] now his body
[1:36:27] is to do the same
[1:36:29] because the body is head and body
[1:36:33] together if Christ is ahead is the word
[1:36:35] his body has to be the same thing amen
[1:36:38] the head was and if he amen was born of
[1:36:42] the word virgin born of the word not
[1:36:45] denominational but virgin born from the
[1:36:47] word but now amen we know that when
[1:36:52] sinning entered in is separated man from
[1:36:55] his entire expression from his presence
[1:36:58] that's what sin and death did but God
[1:37:01] said I have an age this last stage is to
[1:37:04] prove Amen to Satan you want to know
[1:37:07] what's going on right now you want to
[1:37:08] know why we have the struggles and the
[1:37:10] sicknesses and the attacks and the
[1:37:12] trials
[1:37:14] oh I've asked God to heal me
[1:37:17] and I asked him two years ago he healed
[1:37:20] you two years ago
[1:37:21] in fact he healed you at Calvary let's
[1:37:23] just face it
[1:37:25] then why why brother Madam said if God
[1:37:28] would give you everything that you ask
[1:37:30] right when you asked for it he said it
[1:37:31] would make you impatient with him
[1:37:34] but there's something in the trying of
[1:37:36] your asking when you ask
[1:37:38] and then you stand and believe
[1:37:42] Abraham where's your baby it's in that
[1:37:46] box of diapers right there
[1:37:49] really open it up well I see and there's
[1:37:52] diapers that's my testimony
[1:37:55] he's a coming
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:37:59] 25 years that's a lot of diapers
[1:38:03] you know I don't know how Abraham done
[1:38:04] it maybe he did a diaper a year or a
[1:38:06] diaper a month just to prove to Sarah
[1:38:07] we're still going to have it go get some
[1:38:09] Pampers you know just that's going to be
[1:38:11] your belief Sarah you you're you're
[1:38:13] fighting with me you're fussing you're
[1:38:14] saying that I'm getting older it's
[1:38:15] getting past time it's not going to work
[1:38:17] go buy a box of diapers
[1:38:21] can you imagine Sarah well I don't know
[1:38:25] how their stores looked back then
[1:38:32] just a few years after that
[1:38:36] I'm sitting here
[1:38:44] here you have Sister Sarah I have none
[1:38:46] but I will have many
[1:38:51] that's what my box of diapers say
[1:38:54] yeah
[1:38:57] you see you just got to keep on doing it
[1:39:00] because this age is to prove to Satan
[1:39:03] that this church is not like Eve Eve
[1:39:06] gave up at a wrong interpretation and
[1:39:09] then she added to the word go read what
[1:39:10] she said she said something God never
[1:39:12] said
[1:39:14] but here here is his this bride who
[1:39:18] believes the word
[1:39:21] if he said my family is going to be
[1:39:23] saved that's what I'm going to say
[1:39:25] then I'm not going to talk about where
[1:39:27] my daughter's at I'm going to talk about
[1:39:28] how I'm going to read my genealogy

[1:39:35] she's in sin she's she's a lesbian she's

[1:39:40] our genealogy says
[1:39:48] you know so-and-so's on drugs
[1:39:51] you know he was wounded for our
[1:39:52] transgressions
[1:39:54] in fact I'm gonna I want to read
[1:39:56] something to you here I'm on a timer
[1:39:57] Jason
[1:39:59] amen
[1:40:03] this bride I want to make a statement
[1:40:05] about this church I want to make this
[1:40:06] statement about you because this is
[1:40:07] where your faith is you are not like Eve
[1:40:12] you you might say well
[1:40:15] if I was in a perfect church with a
[1:40:17] perfect pastor
[1:40:19] but you're close to perfect brother Rob
[1:40:22] I mean you are perfect in him
[1:40:26] I'm talking like people talk all right
[1:40:28] if I wasn't a perfect church I if I was
[1:40:31] if with a perfect bunch of people where
[1:40:33] there's never any trouble no trials if I
[1:40:36] had the perfect job if I had this
[1:40:39] I would serve God
[1:40:41] we'll ask Eve how that worked out
[1:40:46] she was in a paradise
[1:40:49] she had a perfect husband
[1:40:54] I I've got my glasses off I can't see
[1:40:56] expressions
[1:41:01] perfect Paradise perfect husband
[1:41:03] presence of God deceived
[1:41:07] and God said I'm going to take the most
[1:41:10] perverted age the most perverted people
[1:41:12] at the weakest time and I'm going to
[1:41:15] have a group of people amen that are
[1:41:17] going to serve me and they're going to
[1:41:20] believe me and they're going to prove
[1:41:22] amen we are not like ease
[1:41:27] foreign
[1:41:29] oh you want that perfect Church where
[1:41:32] nobody amen has trouble with anybody
[1:41:34] else but you need to talk to Paul and
[1:41:36] see how that worked out he said I have
[1:41:38] trouble in the church I had trouble in
[1:41:40] the city I had trouble in the wilderness
[1:41:42] I had trouble in the Deep amen I was
[1:41:45] amen I was Shipwrecked amen three times
[1:41:47] amen I was left for dead stoned and left
[1:41:50] for dead I was a basket case in Damascus
[1:41:53] but he was always with me and he never
[1:41:55] left me I was amongst false Brethren I
[1:41:59] had the care of the church and Paul
[1:42:00] never gave up Paul's last words was he
[1:42:04] stood with me and delivered me from the
[1:42:07] life of the Lion
[1:42:09] blessed be the name of the Lord you're
[1:42:12] not going to give up you're not going to
[1:42:14] fall he has presented you spotless
[1:42:19] [Applause]
[1:42:26] your son or daughter of God he knew what
[1:42:28] age you'd be in
[1:42:29] new at times in fact the prophet would
[1:42:31] prophesy over this seed and said she's
[1:42:34] manifested to meet the challenge of this
[1:42:37] hour
[1:42:40] it's not your vote at the voting booth
[1:42:43] it's going to change it it's your life
[1:42:46] that is lived by the word that is making
[1:42:49] ripples that is pushing back hell
[1:42:58] Isaiah said
[1:43:01] in Isaiah 61 10 he said I will greatly
[1:43:03] rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be
[1:43:06] joyful in my God for he hath clothed me
[1:43:08] with garments of Salvation he hath
[1:43:10] covered me with the robe of
[1:43:12] righteousness as a bridegroom dick of
[1:43:14] himself with ornaments and as a bride
[1:43:16] adorneth herself with jewels
[1:43:19] he has clothed me
[1:43:22] he has put the robe of Salvation upon me
[1:43:29] she's presented in a way
[1:43:32] that the people of that age would know
[1:43:34] she's the bride
[1:43:36] amen
[1:43:38] so Paul said Christ has presented
[1:43:40] himself a bride
[1:43:42] Amen to present means somebody to stand
[1:43:45] beside him
[1:43:47] amen it means to provide one to see and
[1:43:50] to question
[1:43:54] God has provided a vessel in this age
[1:43:56] that can be questioned
[1:44:01] you gonna leave too

[1:45:45] baby was declared dead that morning she
[1:45:47] waited till that evening
[1:45:49] and there wasn't a line of ushers that
[1:45:50] could stop that mother from getting
[1:45:52] there
[1:45:55] and her faith produced a vision
[1:46:00] a little baby hung right out there above
[1:46:03] the congregation smiling no teeth
[1:46:06] yeah brother Brown was going to have
[1:46:07] Brother Moore go pray for that little

[1:47:02] persuaded those doctors to keep that
[1:47:03] baby under an oxygen tent
[1:47:06] preserve that baby so that brother
[1:47:08] Branham could fly over from America to
[1:47:10] Germany and pray for this baby
[1:47:13] and this baby they knew would race from
[1:47:15] the dead
[1:47:17] brother Branham prayed and asked the
[1:47:19] Lord what to do and God told him that's
[1:47:21] the hand of God don't touch it
[1:47:25] this wasn't in Mexico this is now in
[1:47:28] Germany
[1:47:29] and you can't always reproduce Mexico in
[1:47:31] Germany
[1:47:34] our Germany in Mexico
[1:47:37] it's what God is choosing to do that'll
[1:47:40] help the people the most
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:45] because God knew if I raised every baby
[1:47:47] uh that was dead
[1:47:50] and then one wasn't raised that person
[1:47:53] would leave
[1:47:56] they would lose hope
[1:48:00] Lord told him don't touch it brother
[1:48:02] Branham called him and said Lord told me
[1:48:04] not to go
[1:48:08] sister statscliff asked brother Brennan
[1:48:11] said brother Branham
[1:48:13] was it because I didn't have enough
[1:48:14] faith
[1:48:17] is that why God said no
[1:48:20] is that why God said don't fly all the
[1:48:21] way over there you're wasting your time
[1:48:22] she don't have enough faith for this
[1:48:25] brother Brahm says no
[1:48:27] you have great faith
[1:48:32] he said it's easy to have faith when
[1:48:34] everything's going the right way
[1:48:35] but when everything's coming against you
[1:48:37] and you're still saying I believe he can
[1:48:39] be raised
[1:48:42] did you have great faith
[1:48:45] brother Branham wrote a letter to them
[1:48:47] I have the letter not not the actual
[1:48:49] letter but I have the copy
[1:48:52] and brother she gone thought enough to
[1:48:55] explain to explain why this happened
[1:49:00] and brother Branham he didn't know
[1:49:02] everything
[1:49:04] but he told him in this letter you know
[1:49:06] the Lord knew what lay down the road
[1:49:11] and he began to relate his own
[1:49:13] experiences
[1:49:15] and he began to tell him
[1:49:17] about his wife passing and then his
[1:49:20] little baby now you imagine the the love
[1:49:22] of a father looking down at a baby
[1:49:24] suffering so hard his her eyes are
[1:49:26] crossed
[1:49:28] and she's dying there's no hope and he's
[1:49:30] laid in hands and and God refuses to
[1:49:33] hear him
[1:49:35] will not answer his prayer
[1:49:41] and then the devil moves up
[1:49:43] said after all you've done for God you
[1:49:45] prayed for the sick God healed him you
[1:49:46] did this you did that and and God won't
[1:49:49] now it's your own baby and God won't
[1:49:50] listen to you
[1:49:52] he's absolutely refuse you and it was
[1:49:55] not at a high time of brother Brown's
[1:49:56] life it was at the lowest time of his
[1:49:58] life
[1:50:00] he lost his wife his daddy had died his
[1:50:04] brother had died his church was
[1:50:05] dwindling
[1:50:07] now his baby's dying
[1:50:10] and Satan moved up
[1:50:13] and said after all you've done
[1:50:16] and then he tempted him
[1:50:19] you ought to just quit
[1:50:24] LeBron said everything the devil was
[1:50:25] telling me was the truth
[1:50:29] these things that happen in his ministry
[1:50:31] everything he's telling me is the truth
[1:50:33] and I opened up my mouth to say if
[1:50:35] that's the way it's going to be then I'm
[1:50:37] no longer serving it was his thought it
[1:50:40] was his energy
[1:50:42] to leave the message God had given him
[1:50:47] that's the way he said but when I opened
[1:50:49] up my mouth
[1:50:51] something down here came up
[1:50:55] and said William Branham
[1:50:57] who are you anyhow
[1:51:01] and then what God did is he showed him
[1:51:03] his grace to even save him
[1:51:07] and it changed see this is what the
[1:51:09] president Lord would do it changed how
[1:51:12] he thought about it and he laid his hand
[1:51:14] said I'll see you soon honey
[1:51:20] now why did that happen to brother
[1:51:21] Branham why did he have to see his
[1:51:23] little baby suffer and die and then now
[1:51:25] he's writing this in the letter to the
[1:51:27] stats Cliffs
[1:51:29] he said and I was asked a while back
[1:51:33] could I I he said I was sitting on the
[1:51:35] hill and seeing something asked me could
[1:51:37] you go through this again
[1:51:39] Could you actually go through that
[1:51:40] trouble again
[1:51:43] all that you lost Could you actually go
[1:51:46] and live it over and he said I'm
[1:51:47] thinking to myself I couldn't do it then
[1:51:49] I remembered
[1:51:51] all the thousands of babies
[1:51:55] that God healed because of my experience
[1:51:58] with Sharon Rose
[1:52:00] that there wasn't another cross-eyed
[1:52:02] baby that I came in the presence of that
[1:52:04] God didn't heal because of my experience
[1:52:06] in that room
[1:52:07] [Applause]
[1:52:12] Vernon wrote to him yes said yes I do it
[1:52:15] all over again you know why because
[1:52:18] every soul is worth ten thousand words
[1:52:22] far greater than the trials and
[1:52:24] afflictions of this Earthly Journey that
[1:52:28] we're in
[1:52:28] [Applause]
[1:52:30] God's using your journey
[1:52:33] for an eternal purpose
[1:52:35] Hallelujah brother Ron he's using your
[1:52:37] journey he's using your journey brother
[1:52:40] Dave yay to the least
[1:52:44] have an impact
[1:52:47] Satan Can't Stop
[1:52:57] we see Jesus when he came he came
[1:52:59] exactly according to the word
[1:53:02] submitting himself exactly to the word
[1:53:04] he didn't come say I'm the one you've
[1:53:06] waited for and I'll do whatever I want
[1:53:08] because of who I am he came and had
[1:53:10] submitted himself he would not have been
[1:53:11] Jesus if he'd done that but he humbled
[1:53:14] himself and took on the form of man and
[1:53:17] and he humbled himself to the word
[1:53:18] submitted himself to the word of the
[1:53:20] hour to be washed in the Jordan suffer
[1:53:22] it to be so for me cometh us to fulfill
[1:53:25] our righteousness
[1:53:28] and he became the matchpiece of every
[1:53:31] believer fulfilling every Old Testament
[1:53:34] type he was Moses on the mountain he was
[1:53:36] David in the valley amen he was Daniel
[1:53:39] Under Pressure come on Church
[1:53:42] he'd been in the water he'd been in the
[1:53:44] fire
[1:53:45] he'd been on the mountain been in every
[1:53:48] trial
[1:53:49] he was Joseph in prison
[1:53:53] he was Abraham believing
[1:53:57] come on Church
[1:53:59] he was a he was the first Adam
[1:54:02] amen we know what Adam was like in the
[1:54:05] beginning because Jesus is called the
[1:54:07] second Adam Adam could walk on water
[1:54:09] Adam could stop the wind
[1:54:13] sick and Adam come he walked on water he
[1:54:16] stopped the winds and the waves peace be
[1:54:18] still there wasn't a demon that come in
[1:54:21] his presence he didn't know what to do
[1:54:22] with them
[1:54:23] [Applause]
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:26] and once you notice and he never healed
[1:54:27] any of them the same
[1:54:31] go read your accounts of all the Blind
[1:54:32] Men that got healed
[1:54:34] he didn't heal them the same one he told
[1:54:36] to go Washington to pull us alone
[1:54:38] spit on the ground put mud on his eyes
[1:54:40] go wash him to pull us alone the other
[1:54:42] one he took out of the city of Therese
[1:54:44] and he took him out let him out by the
[1:54:47] hand prayed for him and asked what he
[1:54:48] saw and pray for him again
[1:54:51] amen he had to get him out of that City
[1:54:53] because he'd already cursed that City
[1:54:56] had to lead him out to where his healing
[1:54:58] was
[1:54:59] you want to be healed in something
[1:55:01] cursed it's not going to work you'll go
[1:55:03] right back to what made you blind but
[1:55:05] God let him out
[1:55:08] told the lepers one leper said I know
[1:55:10] you can heal me if thou will Jesus said
[1:55:11] I will be Thou made hold he's made whole
[1:55:13] ten lepers come to him will you heal us
[1:55:16] he said go back to your priest and show
[1:55:17] yourself do exactly what the word says
[1:55:19] and when they turned and went and obeyed
[1:55:20] they were healed while they walked you
[1:55:22] don't get to tell him how he does it
[1:55:25] you get to believe him
[1:55:27] you get to say he is the same yesterday
[1:55:30] today and forever
[1:55:31] [Applause]
[1:55:35] the prophet said he fulfilled every type
[1:55:37] the Bible says he fulfilled every time
[1:55:39] there was no man like him
[1:55:46] and he is the match piece
[1:55:49] of the Bible
[1:55:51] he is the match peace to every believer
[1:55:55] we can see him in David
[1:56:01] David the adulterer David the murderer
[1:56:04] I don't see Jesus in that
[1:56:07] but I see Jesus in his repentance
[1:56:12] in his steadfastness to get back to the
[1:56:14] word
[1:56:16] I didn't see Jesus
[1:56:18] when Moses was rebelling and and and and
[1:56:21] and breaking the word by smiting The
[1:56:23] Rock twice
[1:56:25] but I saw him in Moses
[1:56:29] when he came down
[1:56:31] with the Commandments
[1:56:33] and so it's been said of old times
[1:56:37] I can see him in every because he's the
[1:56:39] match piece of every believer of the Old
[1:56:42] Testament
[1:56:43] and if he is the match piece of every
[1:56:45] believer there
[1:56:47] he is the match piece of every believer
[1:56:49] here you know you spend a lot of time
[1:56:51] talking about the negative I I did this
[1:56:53] and I did that and I did it and it's
[1:56:55] hard you can't see Jesus there
[1:57:01] but look what he came to do
[1:57:09] let's see
[1:57:11] let's see
[1:57:13] this Mass peace Jesus was different than
[1:57:15] whatever Satan wanted to try to put in
[1:57:19] I just want to drop a thought in here
[1:57:21] is everybody still awake if you're still
[1:57:23] awake say Amen one two three four five
[1:57:26] people counting the Deacon I'm glad the
[1:57:28] deacons are awake
[1:57:30] amen
[1:57:32] are you guys awake
[1:57:35] just a little bit longer my watch hasn't
[1:57:37] gone oh no
[1:57:39] I got 18 minutes remaining
[1:57:41] who gets to set the time
[1:57:48] brother Brandon said
[1:57:50] he preached a message called kinsman
[1:57:52] redeemer he says what is a redeemer
[1:57:57] how does he become a redeemer
[1:57:59] and remember a redeemer redeems you
[1:58:01] completely
[1:58:05] he redeems you he don't he don't redeem
[1:58:07] you so you can be a member in the church
[1:58:10] right and have a party Doctrine
[1:58:13] no he don't redeem you to that
[1:58:17] he redeems you from your sin he redeems
[1:58:21] you from your sickness he redeems you
[1:58:24] from everything that's wrong he is a
[1:58:28] Redeemer
[1:58:31] turn with me in your Bible's most feared
[1:58:33] words of heard at the end of a service
[1:58:35] turn with me in your Bibles
[1:58:38] to Ruth the fourth chapter
[1:58:41] and our reason I said most feared words
[1:58:43] because Satan doesn't like it
[1:58:47] you don't want to see a nail clenched
[1:58:51] he wants you to leave here with doubt
[1:58:53] you see in every Revival there's a twin
[1:58:57] can anybody in here in here tell me what
[1:58:59] Adam and Eve and Abraham and Sarah
[1:59:04] and Jacob and Rebecca had in common
[1:59:09] anybody tell me
[1:59:12] Cain Ishmael and Esau
[1:59:17] oh wait a minute I thought he's going to
[1:59:18] say Abel
[1:59:22] Isaac thank you
[1:59:24] huh and Jacob
[1:59:26] I'll wait a minute
[1:59:28] no I did mess up didn't I Isaac and
[1:59:30] Rebecca know Jacob didn't marry his own
[1:59:32] mother maybe in his age
[1:59:37] whoo
[1:59:39] he redeems us from all wrong
[1:59:42] wow
[1:59:47] remember I corrected it
[1:59:54] yeah why didn't you help me man
[2:00:01] they each they each brought forth a twin
[2:00:06] that interacted with the revelation of
[2:00:08] the hour
[2:00:12] do you know Jesus had a twin
[2:00:16] it was Judas do you know the Holy Spirit
[2:00:19] has a twin
[2:00:22] it's the Antichrist
[2:00:25] and that's why the scripture that I read
[2:00:27] in first John is like he that committeth
[2:00:30] Sinners of the devil he that is born of
[2:00:33] God cannot commit sin
[2:00:36] he's talking about twins
[2:00:41] that's why brother Madison power of
[2:00:43] transformation he said he said the
[2:00:44] deception this hour is a Pentecostal
[2:00:46] move what is a Pentecostal move he's
[2:00:47] talking about the birth of the
[2:00:50] supernatural
[2:00:52] the deception is in the birth
[2:00:56] Satan will come with a false birth
[2:00:59] God comes with the true
[2:01:02] come on
[2:01:06] every birth
[2:01:08] is sovereign
[2:01:13] amen
[2:01:15] so now
[2:01:16] route 4.
[2:01:18] then went Boaz up to the gate set him
[2:01:20] down there and behold the Kinsmen of
[2:01:22] whom Boaz spoke of came by
[2:01:25] so that means there's been something
[2:01:27] going on in the previous chapters
[2:01:29] boy as it told told Ruth there's a near
[2:01:32] Kinsman than I Ruth had made a claim
[2:01:34] upon boys went and laid at his feet
[2:01:37] Boaz when he saw her faith he gave her
[2:01:39] six measures of barley said you're not
[2:01:40] going to go back empty every time you
[2:01:42] come to God you'll never go back empty
[2:01:45] boy as is a type of a redeemer amen he
[2:01:48] is a kinsman redeemer he's at Harvest
[2:01:50] time it's in the Book of Judges the most
[2:01:52] perverted time in the Bible of the Old
[2:01:55] Testament
[2:01:59] but he told her there's another Kinsman
[2:02:00] and I'm going to deal with him
[2:02:03] and so he he called out as this Kinsman
[2:02:05] he went and sat by the gate and he
[2:02:06] called out to this Kinsman he said hold
[2:02:07] such a one turn aside sit down here and
[2:02:09] he turned aside and said down I love it
[2:02:11] that day never the writer of this never
[2:02:13] writes down who that Kinsman was I love
[2:02:15] it that he would not mention his name
[2:02:17] he's not worthy of it because he can't
[2:02:19] do the work
[2:02:21] so don't keep toiling out his name
[2:02:27] don't give the credit to the one who
[2:02:29] don't deserve it
[2:02:33] and he says such a one say here by me
[2:02:36] and he took ten Elders of the city and
[2:02:38] they sat down and they sat down and he
[2:02:40] said unto the to the Kinsmen Naomi is
[2:02:42] coming in out of the country of Moab
[2:02:44] sells a parcel of land which was our
[2:02:45] brother a limilex and he said unto the
[2:02:48] Kinsman Naomi that has come out again of
[2:02:50] the country of Moab selleth the parcel
[2:02:52] of land which was our brother elimilex
[2:02:56] I put it down twice and I don't know why
[2:02:59] well the Lord want me to read it twice
[2:03:01] all right and I thought to advertise
[2:03:03] he's saying buy it before the
[2:03:05] inhabitants and before the Elders of my
[2:03:06] people if you will redeem it redeem it
[2:03:09] but if you're not redeem it then tell me
[2:03:11] that I may know for there is none to
[2:03:13] redeem it beside thee and I'm after thee
[2:03:17] and there's no name man
[2:03:20] this nearer Kinsmen
[2:03:22] said I will redeem it
[2:03:26] why would he say that because although
[2:03:28] hasn't said is there some land
[2:03:33] and Satan can read can take land
[2:03:37] because it's already cursed
[2:03:40] come on and you are born in sin you are
[2:03:44] shaping iniquity
[2:03:45] this land is cursed he can take what is
[2:03:48] cursed
[2:03:49] praise
[2:03:51] come on
[2:03:54] now Boaz is going right by the Word of
[2:03:56] Promise that Moses has wrote down the
[2:03:58] law of Moses how to get the land back he
[2:04:00] he is he is repeating it back to the
[2:04:03] elders and repeating it back to to this
[2:04:06] no-name Kinsman and he's saying this is
[2:04:09] what the word says this is a near a
[2:04:12] Kinsmen of yours they have a parcel land
[2:04:14] they were in Moab he is dead Naomi's
[2:04:17] back here this land has been sold can
[2:04:19] you redeem this land to her inheritance
[2:04:25] he said yeah I can do that I'll take
[2:04:27] that land
[2:04:31] then said Boaz
[2:04:33] when you buy that field from the hand in
[2:04:36] the homie you must also buy this Ruth
[2:04:39] the moabitus the wife of the Dead to
[2:04:42] raise up the name of the Dead you have
[2:04:45] got to bring sons that I should have
[2:04:48] been there in the first place
[2:04:56] you
[2:04:57] have to raise up the name of the Dead
[2:04:59] upon his inheritance and the Kinsmen
[2:05:01] said I cannot redeem it for myself lest
[2:05:04] I Mar my own inheritance redeem thou my
[2:05:07] right to thyself for I cannot redeem it
[2:05:10] then why do we allow Satan become our
[2:05:13] closest friend
[2:05:15] when he has already testified I cannot
[2:05:18] redeem them
[2:05:19] I can get you sick but I can't heal you
[2:05:22] I can get you in prison but I can't open
[2:05:25] the door amen I can take your children
[2:05:27] and bring the sins amen and make them
[2:05:30] magnified in their life but I Know a Man
[2:05:34] who stepped up to the plate in the hour
[2:05:38] of the Gentile bride and said I'll
[2:05:41] redeem you
[2:05:43] don't worry Ruth just rest there with
[2:05:46] the barley that I gave you I'll redeem
[2:05:49] you
[2:05:50] oh I think about that moment I'm closing
[2:05:52] but I think about that moment Ruth and
[2:05:54] Naomi's sitting there watching
[2:05:56] I'm in a chair and they're watching what
[2:06:00] is he saying he's given him the
[2:06:03] opportunity redeem it but you know amen
[2:06:06] my Lord the lord of the Harvest knows
[2:06:09] that nearer Kinsmen better than I could
[2:06:12] ever know him and he knows what he's
[2:06:14] capable of and what he's not capable of
[2:06:17] yeah
[2:06:19] hey man you can lay claim to a land
[2:06:21] that's already poisoned and a land
[2:06:23] that's already afflicted
[2:06:26] Jesus say that's my land that's what he
[2:06:28] offered Satan excuse me what he offered
[2:06:31] Jesus I'll give you the glory of these
[2:06:33] kingdoms I'll give you all of this if
[2:06:35] you just fall down and worship me but
[2:06:36] Jesus the Lord of the Harvest our Boaz
[2:06:39] he knew what he was coming into and he
[2:06:43] knew that Satan could not redeem a
[2:06:45] gentile bride
[2:06:47] Satan has no message for you that'll set
[2:06:51] you free that'll give you the Holy Ghost
