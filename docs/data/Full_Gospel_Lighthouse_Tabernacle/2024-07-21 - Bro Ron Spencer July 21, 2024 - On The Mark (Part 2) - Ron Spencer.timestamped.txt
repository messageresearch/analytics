[59:48] brother Andrew about it and I talked to

[1:00:29] that are working with us God bless you
[1:00:32] God bless you amen last week I spoke to
[1:00:34] you on the
[1:00:36] mark and brother brandham said when the
[1:00:39] saints would go through the through
[1:00:43] the they would pass and they they died
[1:00:46] with a certain expectation looking for
[1:00:49] the Rapture looking for the resurrection
[1:00:52] and they went to the to their death with
[1:00:55] an
[1:00:56] expectation he said if they did not went
[1:00:59] to their death with that
[1:01:01] expectation if God would have told Paul
[1:01:04] that it's going to be 2,000 years he
[1:01:06] said that expectation would have would
[1:01:08] have dissolved and and they just went on
[1:01:11] and they liveed their lives with no no
[1:01:14] no expectation for the resurrection and
[1:01:17] just live their lives very haphazardly
[1:01:20] but he said on Resurrection
[1:01:23] morning he said they'll raise with the
[1:01:26] same
[1:01:27] expectation as when they went into the
[1:01:31] ground last night as I was listening to
[1:01:34] brother Andrew and as he was going
[1:01:36] through those Heroes of Faith and and
[1:01:40] from all the way the Welsh Revival and
[1:01:42] those people that were a part of that
[1:01:45] and each and every one of them that
[1:01:47] lived incredible hero lives they were
[1:01:50] ordinary people just like you and I but
[1:01:53] God lit their candle
[1:01:56] kind of like he lit your candle and you
[1:01:58] know they you know they just sered God
[1:02:01] with everything that was in their hearts
[1:02:03] and just did an incredible incredible
[1:02:06] work that they were there and some of
[1:02:09] them live very poor lives they lived
[1:02:12] very struggling lives and none of them
[1:02:15] had wings on their back come on probably
[1:02:18] never saw the pillar of fire in a lot of
[1:02:21] ways I I'd like to add something to that
[1:02:23] if I can now don't charge me for my time
[1:02:27] now so Columba I actually stood with
[1:02:31] brother George Quinn at Columbus home
[1:02:36] and you you couldn't put that piano in
[1:02:40] his home you think great big castles or
[1:02:42] you think great big houses but that was
[1:02:44] about the size of of his house and it
[1:02:48] was a rock ledge that is still there
[1:02:50] today the house has fell down but
[1:02:52] there's a rock ledge that's still there
[1:02:54] today where he slept and they would take
[1:02:58] they would take skins and they would
[1:03:00] take Furs and lay on there and they that
[1:03:03] was their
[1:03:05] bed you know I think of my mattress and
[1:03:10] sometimes I complain about where I sleep
[1:03:12] but that'd be a tough place to
[1:03:15] sleep and in God's great plan he had him
[1:03:19] as a messenger of the
[1:03:21] day laying on that rock
[1:03:24] ledge now now he would step out from
[1:03:27] there and he'd step out about 40 ft and
[1:03:30] from there there was a big valley that
[1:03:33] was just below him and there was a
[1:03:35] village just to the right and he would
[1:03:38] stand on this rock and he would preach
[1:03:40] and his voice would go out across that
[1:03:43] Valley and hundreds of people would come

[1:03:51] about

[1:03:59] Doug that through the keyhole you could
[1:04:03] see the pillar of Fire shining as he
[1:04:08] prayed and people would come and and
[1:04:11] they would they would go and slip up to
[1:04:13] the house so that they could watch that
[1:04:15] Pillar of Fire coming out of that
[1:04:17] Keyhole amen now I'm sharing this with

[1:04:56] there and I shake Columbus hand I'm
[1:05:00] going I'm going to tell him I was at
[1:05:03] your

[1:05:07] was a warm wind that just came down over
[1:05:10] top of brother George and myself you
[1:05:12] talking about a
[1:05:16] feeling hallelujah oh what a land that
[1:05:19] it will be
[1:05:21] amen amen thank you Lord now when we
[1:05:25] read about to him that
[1:05:27] overcometh Not only was those people on
[1:05:30] the mark come on but we are to be on the
[1:05:35] mark in this
[1:05:36] day there's a there's a couple of
[1:05:39] sermons that I want to preach when I
[1:05:40] come back from Brother Toms and and I I
[1:05:43] want you to just think about this and
[1:05:48] and there's going to be a people that's
[1:05:49] left
[1:05:52] behind they're going to be left behind
[1:05:55] and they're going to have to overcome in
[1:05:57] very difficult
[1:06:01] conditions people that even set among
[1:06:04] us that'll be left behind and you see
[1:06:08] how will they be left behind they don't
[1:06:10] have the Holy
[1:06:11] Ghost they wasn't sincere or wasn't
[1:06:16] committed and this is a very dark age
[1:06:19] and very lazy age and it gets aart Le
[1:06:22] oosa gets a part of it and they get into
[1:06:25] a frame of mind to where that that you
[1:06:28] know it's just going to be all right
[1:06:30] that messenger's been gone for all of
[1:06:32] these years now and the message is
[1:06:34] depleted and may by
[1:06:38] excuses by excuses they find them
[1:06:41] themselves in a very horrible condition
[1:06:43] and listen I I I don't want to preach
[1:06:45] that this morning but there's nothing in
[1:06:47] my mind thinking that I want to stay
[1:06:50] [Applause]
[1:06:53] here there's not a job that's too
[1:06:57] important there's not another person
[1:06:59] that's too
[1:07:02] important there's not a Hollywood
[1:07:04] celebrity that's too
[1:07:06] important there's not the presidential
[1:07:09] race that's too important listen don't
[1:07:12] get yourself all concerned with all that
[1:07:14] God's got that in his
[1:07:17] hands he's got that in his hands Let
[1:07:20] them fight it out let them fight it out
[1:07:23] don't you fight it out Let Them Fight It
[1:07:25] Out
[1:07:26] I'll tell you who will win the one that
[1:07:28] God wants to
[1:07:30] [Applause]
[1:07:38] win but I want us to be on the
[1:07:43] Mark I want to be on the
[1:07:45] Mark I want to be ready like never
[1:07:50] before but let me just say this you each
[1:07:52] and every one of us have a battle that
[1:07:55] we have to contend
[1:07:58] with every one of us sitting here
[1:08:01] everyone in the invisible audience have
[1:08:04] a
[1:08:05] battle in this darkness that you and I
[1:08:08] have to contend
[1:08:10] with I I'll read just a little bit about
[1:08:13] Shadrach mesach and abendigo but God had
[1:08:16] it in his
[1:08:18] hands he also has you in his
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:24] hands there may not be a hundred people
[1:08:27] in your community that really know who
[1:08:29] you
[1:08:32] are are you are you with me now oh but
[1:08:34] I'm more important than 100 people
[1:08:38] really really you have a church here
[1:08:41] about 250 to 300 people that know you in
[1:08:44] a certain way and they realize how
[1:08:46] important you are but let me just say
[1:08:49] this you God
[1:08:51] knows the one that created the heavens
[1:08:54] and the Earth
[1:08:56] he predestinated you to live in this
[1:08:59] specific
[1:09:01] hour you couldn't be born in any other
[1:09:07] day you're not an
[1:09:10] accident and let me just say a couple
[1:09:12] things here you didn't come here to
[1:09:20] lose God didn't bring you here to
[1:09:23] lose to him that overc
[1:09:26] cometh and they overcame by the blood of
[1:09:29] the lamb and the word of their
[1:09:32] testimony you said it last night brother
[1:09:34] Andrew the word that is in our mouth you
[1:09:38] are what you speak your confession going
[1:09:42] under your
[1:09:43] lips when you confess the very word of
[1:09:47] God that is the most powerful thing on
[1:09:49] the earth then God comes along and backs
[1:09:51] it up
[1:09:56] my favorite scripture No Weapon that is
[1:09:58] formed against thee shall
[1:10:01] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[1:10:04] against thee in the Judgment Thou shalt
[1:10:09] condemn this is the heritage of the
[1:10:11] Servants of the Lord and their
[1:10:13] righteousness is of me sayeth the
[1:10:18] Lord now just think about King
[1:10:22] Jehoshaphat think about what he did when
[1:10:24] the army were knocking on the door of
[1:10:27] his
[1:10:28] kingdom 2 chonicles chapter 20 he began
[1:10:32] to seek God I think that's a good place
[1:10:36] to start he begins seeking God's face
[1:10:39] and reminding him of his promise of
[1:10:42] God's supreme power Jehoshaphat cried
[1:10:46] for help admitting his
[1:10:50] weaknesses he didn't know what to do his
[1:10:52] eyes were fixed upon God and and so was
[1:10:55] his
[1:10:57] expectations the result of his
[1:11:01] battle God moved in a powerful way on
[1:11:04] the behalf of him and his
[1:11:06] people we must stay in constant contact
[1:11:10] with
[1:11:13] God don't just seek him when you're in
[1:11:18] [Applause]
[1:11:21] trouble did you hear that don't just
[1:11:24] seek God God when you're in
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] trouble notice his prayer oh Lord God of
[1:11:33] our
[1:11:34] fathers art th thou the kingdom of a god
[1:11:37] of heaven and rulest not that thou over
[1:11:41] all the kingdoms of the Heathen and in
[1:11:44] thy hand is there not power and might so
[1:11:48] that none of the is able to withstand
[1:11:54] thee h
[1:11:57] oh I love that don't you I read this
[1:11:59] portion of a quote last week and I want
[1:12:02] to read this just one
[1:12:04] sentence God's purpose can never be
[1:12:11] defeated amen I want you to turn to your
[1:12:14] neighbor and I want you to say God's
[1:12:22] purpose he didn't say your plan
[1:12:26] your
[1:12:28] thoughts your
[1:12:30] opinions can you imagine if it worked
[1:12:32] out that Humanity had control some of
[1:12:35] you like
[1:12:37] blue some of you like
[1:12:40] purple some of you like
[1:12:44] yellow are you with me but God loves
[1:12:49] blue well how do you know that look
[1:12:53] up look
[1:12:58] up Romans chapter
[1:13:00] 8 verse
[1:13:02] 31 I'm not going any further on that
[1:13:06] thought Romans chapter 8 and verse
[1:13:11] 31 and what shall we then say to these
[1:13:16] things I want you to read this with me
[1:13:18] if God be for
[1:13:20] us who can be against
[1:13:23] us he he that spared not his own son but
[1:13:27] delivered him up for us
[1:13:29] all how shall he not with him freely
[1:13:33] also also freely give us all
[1:13:35] things who shall lay anything to the
[1:13:38] charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:13:44] justify I'm thankful for that right now
[1:13:47] it is not a man or a judge that
[1:13:49] justifies us it's not our best friends
[1:13:52] that justifies us it is God that
[1:13:56] justifies and Justified it is as though
[1:13:59] you never did it in the first
[1:14:02] [Applause]
[1:14:05] place thank you Jesus did you get that
[1:14:09] point brother brother on I'm just I'm

[1:14:34] out of your life you'll get
[1:14:40] healed I'm glad God told me before any
[1:14:42] of this trial took place if you will
[1:14:46] trust me I will use you like never
[1:14:48] before
[1:14:49] [Applause]
[1:14:59] he didn't say if you trust your
[1:15:02] friends cuz after a while their energy
[1:15:05] runs out but if you trust
[1:15:08] me and God's the kind of God that never
[1:15:11] runs out of his bank
[1:15:13] account his healing power does not
[1:15:16] diminish his his saving power does not
[1:15:19] diminish it is God that justifies
[1:15:23] us amen

[1:15:40] scripture who shall separate us from the
[1:15:42] love of

[1:17:15] win for I
[1:17:18] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:17:22] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:17:24] or things present or things to come nor
[1:17:28] height nor depth or any other creature
[1:17:29] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:17:32] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:17:36] lord well my best friend quit
[1:17:42] so preachers fail so if you're in love
[1:17:46] with God let them
[1:17:52] go Philippians chapter 3 and ver verse
[1:17:56] 13 bre I count myself I count not myself
[1:18:01] to have apprehended but this one thing
[1:18:03] that I do forgetting those things which
[1:18:06] are behind and reaching forth unto those
[1:18:10] things which are before I want you to
[1:18:12] read this next verse with me if you'll
[1:18:14] do
[1:18:16] that
[1:18:18] Hallelujah I'm having trouble with my
[1:18:20] vision but I'll get through it
[1:18:25] and there went my
[1:18:27] notes hang on don't read it until I get
[1:18:35] there Brethren I count I'm going to have
[1:18:38] to read it again Brethren I count not
[1:18:40] myself to have apprehended but this
[1:18:42] thing one thing that I do forgetting
[1:18:44] those
[1:18:45] things which are behind reaching forth
[1:18:48] unto those things which are
[1:18:50] before I press toward the mark for the
[1:18:55] prize of the High Calling of God which
[1:18:57] is in Christ
[1:19:00] Jesus now I want you to understand God
[1:19:02] is not in the guessing
[1:19:05] business he's not putting chemicals
[1:19:08] together to see if it'll work come on
[1:19:11] now in the horse in the horse industry
[1:19:14] they will breed this horse to this horse
[1:19:17] and this horse to and they're very
[1:19:19] interested in the
[1:19:21] Bloodlines you've been around a little
[1:19:23] bit welcome too I love horses
[1:19:25] so so anyway they breed these horses
[1:19:27] together they will spend millions of
[1:19:30] dollars in study to try to get the guy
[1:19:34] that can do the Kentucky Derby and the
[1:19:36] Pras and Belmont they'll try to their
[1:19:38] best I don't pay attention to those
[1:19:40] things
[1:19:42] but they'll do their best to have blood
[1:19:45] lines that they know that will work
[1:19:48] because if they
[1:19:50] win if they win that horse immediately
[1:19:53] becomes worth milon ions of dollars
[1:19:55] somewhere somewhere around it's
[1:19:56] estimated somewhere around $30 million
[1:19:59] that horse will be worth
[1:20:02] overnight last year the horse that R won
[1:20:05] the Kentucky Derby they sold him for
[1:20:10] Junk for
[1:20:13] $25,000 and an old farmer
[1:20:16] bought and he so happened to put him in
[1:20:19] a Ricky dink trailer and hired a jockey
[1:20:22] to ride on him
[1:20:25] and he
[1:20:26] won the Kentucky
[1:20:31] Derby what does that have to do with
[1:20:33] your sermon this morning you look like
[1:20:43] junk you look like

[1:20:50] mud don't get your wings out now I'm
[1:20:52] going to I'm coming at you on none of
[1:20:55] you made the who's
[1:20:58] who so go ahead and take the starchy out
[1:21:00] of you without God none of

[1:21:23] a funeral
[1:21:26] wake
[1:21:30] up brother Homer and I preached a
[1:21:34] funeral and when it was over
[1:21:36] with all the children walked up and spit
[1:21:40] on the on the
[1:21:43] casket they had such a disdain and such
[1:21:46] a hatred for the man let me just say
[1:21:50] this to you I don't want to end up like
[1:21:53] that I I don't want to end up like that
[1:21:56] brother Homer brother Homer he did his
[1:21:59] best to get him to to have a chance for
[1:22:02] love once
[1:22:04] again it really hurt his
[1:22:08] feelings but let me just say when it
[1:22:10] comes to the end of my
[1:22:15] road I want people to look and say this
[1:22:18] man was a
[1:22:22] warrior this man was a
[1:22:25] Christian this man was a real pastor
[1:22:29] this man was a real
[1:22:31] father I'm coming to you this man was on
[1:22:35] the
[1:22:36] [Applause]
[1:22:38] mark are you with me
[1:22:42] now now brother random says this this is
[1:22:45] very familiar to you and he says now he
[1:22:49] said right down to the time that he is
[1:22:51] cast into the Lake of Fire he fights it
[1:22:54] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:22:57] people get the true revelation of the
[1:22:59] true church and what she stands
[1:23:01] for she can do the Greater
[1:23:05] Works she will be an invincible
[1:23:09] Army and if you know anything about
[1:23:11] Invincible that means you're
[1:23:14] undefeated there's no way that you can
[1:23:17] be defeated that's the way God looks at
[1:23:22] you I want you to think about it maybe
[1:23:24] you got up this morning your hair was 40
[1:23:27] mil from
[1:23:30] Sunday you brushed it felt like a
[1:23:32] dinosaur got in your
[1:23:34] mouth died and
[1:23:40] rotted there's an
[1:23:48] overcomer you gentlemen your beards are
[1:23:51] tucked out and you're starting to stand
[1:23:53] up a little bit
[1:23:55] and you start shaving that
[1:23:58] face I think probably in heaven we're
[1:24:00] all going to be having
[1:24:02] beards that's that's not a quote you
[1:24:05] don't go look for
[1:24:16] it I I'll get i'll get letters this week
[1:24:19] brother Ron where does it say you have
[1:24:20] to have a have to have a beard
[1:24:29] it is not how you look at
[1:24:31] yourself it is how God looks at
[1:24:36] you it's how God looks at you now so
[1:24:40] many times we walk into church and we
[1:24:43] get all kind of excuses we walk in and
[1:24:45] we're under an atmosphere of defeat
[1:24:47] under an atmosphere of depression we're
[1:24:49] under all different kind of atmospheres
[1:24:51] of fighting that we fought all week long
[1:24:53] hopefully not with your
[1:24:56] wife but you walk in and because you're
[1:24:58] under such a cloud you can't get

[1:25:32] husband all that sin that that's just
[1:25:35] sin too backsliding is sitting in church

[1:26:15] God I come to get in his presence I
[1:26:18] don't care how long we've been a
[1:26:19] preacher how long we've been a servant
[1:26:21] of God or how long we've done this I
[1:26:23] want more of him
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:30] now brother brandom this this is a
[1:26:32] little bit of a long cloak but I believe
[1:26:34] I believe you enjoy it three three
[1:26:37] Hebrew children he says this is to God
[1:26:40] he said I can see him watching and all
[1:26:43] at once a great Angel comes up to his
[1:26:45] right side and stands at his attention
[1:26:47] putting his hand on his sword Gabriel
[1:26:51] and he said father have you look down
[1:26:53] there there the they're the Seed of
[1:26:55] Abraham and they believe in you and they
[1:26:59] prayed all night long and they're going
[1:27:01] right into the death and let me go down
[1:27:04] there and I'll change the
[1:27:08] scene what I want to say there is listen
[1:27:11] you're not ever
[1:27:13] alone you're never alone you've got
[1:27:15] Angels guarding for you and watching
[1:27:17] over for you and negotiating with
[1:27:21] God that's right brother says and I
[1:27:24] believe he could have done
[1:27:26] it and he said that's right Gabriel
[1:27:29] you're a good Angel just stand there and
[1:27:31] here comes another one his name is
[1:27:34] wormwood he's the angel over against the
[1:27:37] waters and he over the waters he said I
[1:27:39] can see him standing attention he said
[1:27:41] father have you looked down at babon
[1:27:45] yeah I watched them all
[1:27:47] night his eyes on the sparrow and I know
[1:27:50] he's watching me I've watched them all

[1:27:55] up down there this morning the seeds of
[1:27:58] Abraham that's took you at your word and
[1:28:03] standing there on it he said you know
[1:28:05] one time you told me to turn the waters
[1:28:08] loose and I have control and you let me
[1:28:11] go down and I will wash babblin off the
[1:28:16] map let me go down there I'll wash him
[1:28:19] off of the
[1:28:23] map brother BR responds
[1:28:26] again and he could have done
[1:28:29] that and I can hear them say that's
[1:28:32] right wormwood you're a wonderful Angel
[1:28:35] you did exactly everything that I told
[1:28:37] you to do that you were created I

[1:32:21] helicopters your way that's right
[1:32:30] Amen brother brandom said there's a
[1:32:32] reason I'm doing
[1:32:34] this for the critic that says don't go
[1:32:37] to
[1:32:39] doctors brother brandom took his kids to
[1:32:42] the doctors he went to the doctors
[1:32:45] himself this going to take me a minute
[1:32:47] well brother Ron how do you know all of
[1:32:49] that I was cleaning a
[1:32:51] chimney standing in a house of an older
[1:32:54] gentleman that had a PhD at Virginia
[1:32:57] Tech and he had a son and he said I just
[1:33:00] got off the phone with it he don't know
[1:33:02] nothing about me he said I just got off
[1:33:04] the phone with my son and he said
[1:33:06] they're studying conscious and
[1:33:09] subconscious and he starts down the line
[1:33:11] he said now he said now sometimes he
[1:33:13] said you ever dream I said yeah yeah I
[1:33:17] dream he said some of them are good
[1:33:18] dreams some of them are bad dreams some
[1:33:19] of them are nightmares yeah yeah that's
[1:33:22] right he said it's like you're awake and
[1:33:24] you're seeing the Saints he said some
[1:33:26] people see that in color and some people
[1:33:28] see that in dark and some people see it
[1:33:30] in images said some don't mean anything
[1:33:33] in the world he said there was a
[1:33:37] man that my son is doing a specific
[1:33:40] study on his conscious and his
[1:33:43] subconscious laid
[1:33:45] together and he could see Visions like
[1:33:49] you and I see dreams amen and said I
[1:33:54] said Wigan brandom he said that's right
[1:33:56] how did you know about
[1:34:07] that
[1:34:10] hallelujah
[1:34:15] amen I missed something there that I
[1:34:17] wanted to say but let me say this to
[1:34:20] you when your critic tells you that you
[1:34:23] shouldn't go to the doctor and you sit
[1:34:24] and take
[1:34:25] medicine that critic may
[1:34:29] also be the Mr
[1:34:32] unbelief
[1:34:34] amen and let me give you another quote
[1:34:37] brother brandham said doctors are God's
[1:34:40] agents on the
[1:34:45] earth they're God's agents on the earth
[1:34:49] oh but brother R there're a bunch of
[1:34:50] hooky spooks
[1:34:53] you're not listening to Brother brandom
[1:34:55] come
[1:34:56] on you're not listening to brother
[1:34:58] brandom they're God's agents on the
[1:35:01] earth well brother Ron have you ever
[1:35:03] seen it work okay you want a story I'll
[1:35:05] give you a story my father cut his
[1:35:08] fingers off when we were doing chimney
[1:35:12] sweeping and I heard the doctor say
[1:35:15] because it twisted them right off and
[1:35:17] and I heard the doctor
[1:35:19] say we'll just go ahead and make stubs
[1:35:22] out of them' and and and this and he can
[1:35:25] live it won't be no danger to him and I
[1:35:28] walked up to that team of doctors four
[1:35:30] of them standing there and I said we
[1:35:33] believe that you're God's agents on the
[1:35:35] earth and we believe if you'll do your
[1:35:38] job God will do his job
[1:35:54] when they put his fingers back on two
[1:35:57] weeks later when they took the the th
[1:36:00] the the things off all of the bandages
[1:36:02] off those fingers were not even
[1:36:08] bruised he he had told my dad said
[1:36:11] they're going to either be black or
[1:36:12] they're going to be blue or they're
[1:36:14] going to be horrible we may have to take
[1:36:16] them off and when he took the bandages
[1:36:18] off he started working my daddy's
[1:36:20] fingers like this
[1:36:23] because there was another
[1:36:26] [Applause]
[1:36:38] physician now wward you're a wonderful
[1:36:42] Angel and you did just exactly what I
[1:36:44] told you to do since you were created I
[1:36:47] created you and you did that too Gabriel
[1:36:50] and but you know I'm going down there
[1:36:55] myself this is my
[1:36:59] job now just when they were getting
[1:37:01] ready to take their first last step I I
[1:37:04] can see him stand up with his Priestly
[1:37:07] robes drop around him where he was
[1:37:09] setting tonight he said they're bloody
[1:37:11] make an intercession Upon Our confession
[1:37:14] for he died to bring to pass anything
[1:37:16] that we asked for where is our faith and
[1:37:19] that is in him and there he stands
[1:37:22] motions this way motions that way and
[1:37:25] here comes a great big cloud White Cloud
[1:37:27] by him he steps upon it and he calls for
[1:37:30] the East Wind The North Wind and the
[1:37:32] south wind and the West Wind to drive
[1:37:34] them like horses and he reaches up and
[1:37:36] grips a h of a zigzag
[1:37:40] lightning brother and I'd like that
[1:37:42] quote just look up
[1:37:44] zigzag and crack it across the skies and
[1:37:48] before they could ever step in step in
[1:37:50] there he was in the furnace amen he was
[1:37:54] in the fiery furnace with him he stood
[1:37:56] in there with a great big Palm fan and
[1:37:59] somewhere like a big tree of life
[1:38:01] Fanning the fiery blazes off of them
[1:38:04] like that and said I just want to talk
[1:38:06] it over with your with my children he
[1:38:09] said I know that you're the Seed of
[1:38:11] Abraham and I gave the promise and I'm
[1:38:14] here to answer it he kept those fire
[1:38:17] blazes off of
[1:38:20] them and they opened it up and said how
[1:38:22] many do you put in there three and he
[1:38:25] said there's more down in there and he
[1:38:27] looks at the Son of God he was he said
[1:38:31] why they after they was tried they
[1:38:34] possessed the Gate of their
[1:38:38] enemy are you with me what about Daniel
[1:38:42] when he's placed in there with a bunch
[1:38:44] of hungry

[1:38:51] there with him maybe he couldn't see it
[1:38:54] but those lines laid
[1:38:58] down and I believe if they laid down

[1:50:10] beings when we start throwing stones at
[1:50:12] each other he's looking at the
[1:50:15] end and when you're on the mark you keep
[1:50:18] his
[1:50:19] Focus you keep looking at what God's
[1:50:22] looking looking at you keep looking at

[1:53:18] never stop that
[1:53:24] it's there it's got to happen I want to
[1:53:27] drop that note there for a reason

[1:53:34] little Finnish Boy comes up off of the
[1:53:36] ground and brother Bram said you could
[1:53:39] line up every devil in
[1:53:41] hell when you know where you are right

[1:53:53] when you know where you
[1:53:56] are you could line up every devil in
[1:54:00] hell that's a huge
[1:54:02] statement that's a Monumental
[1:54:06] [Applause]
[1:54:07] statement and this comes from a prophet
[1:54:10] of God that says if I'm not right may
[1:54:12] God strike me
[1:54:13] dead and right after he tells that
[1:54:16] statement listen he knows where he stand

[1:54:25] earth since the days of Jesus like we
[1:54:29] had in this
[1:54:32] age never had one that could stand there
[1:54:36] and tell you who you are where you come
[1:54:39] from what your condition is what the
[1:54:40] doctor told
[1:54:43] you never

[1:58:14] way this message is full of
[1:58:20] hope this message is infiltrated in
[1:58:23] every line full of grace full of
[1:58:27] Hope but brother Ron there's places
[1:58:29] where he's just really rough do you
[1:58:32] realize where he's at he's trying to get
[1:58:35] them out of some of those
[1:58:38] spots he's trying to bring them out of
[1:58:41] their
[1:58:46] denominations
[1:58:50] Amen brother Andrew I can't imagine the
[1:58:55] responsibility that God speaks to
[1:58:58] you and you're a
[1:59:01] prophet and you know today is not going
[1:59:03] to be a day to where you preach on
[1:59:06] shouting
[1:59:08] on and you know that David is is a
[1:59:14] representation of the Lord
[1:59:18] himself and you know God's blessed David
[1:59:23] but God's revealed to you that he's
[1:59:25] killed another man and taken his wife
[1:59:29] and she's
[1:59:31] pregnant and today you're going to
[1:59:34] preach a sermon
[1:59:35] called Thou Art the
[1:59:47] man here's the difficult thing if David
[1:59:51] covers it up before a
[1:59:53] prophet God could kill
[1:59:56] him he could kill him right
[2:00:00] there he's God's prophet and God's
[2:00:03] Prophet is greater than any King on the
[2:00:10] earth let me say this to you have God
[2:00:13] called me to go to the president of the
[2:00:15] United States of America and preach a
[2:00:18] sermon and he gave me access I would
[2:00:20] preach what God spoke to me to
[2:00:23] preach I'm just dead
[2:00:26] honest and Nathan walks in and he begins
[2:00:29] to talk about a sheep one man's got a
[2:00:32] whole lot of sheep and one man's got
[2:00:44] one boy this sermon was stirring it was
[2:00:47] incredible
[2:00:49] stirring move David
[2:00:52] and he told him that the man that had
[2:00:54] all all of these
[2:00:55] sheep went down and took this man that
[2:01:00] only had
[2:01:01] one now listen this sermon stirs all of
[2:01:04] all of us get stirred by sermons they
[2:01:07] move us one way or another brother BR
[2:01:09] said I can see by your face you know
[2:01:12] some sermons make you happy some cause
[2:01:14] you to remorse or some some different
[2:01:16] things he said I can watch your
[2:01:19] face and David is listening to to Nathan
[2:01:22] preach knowing he's a
[2:01:25] prophet and David knows there's
[2:01:27] something got to be
[2:01:29] done and he said whoever did this got to
[2:01:33] die whoever did this has got to
[2:01:37] die and then he announces his
[2:01:42] text
[2:01:44] David thou are the manen
[2:01:54] brother Doug if you look at
[2:01:56] it David could have had Nathan
[2:02:02] killed he had UAH
[2:02:05] killed he could have had he could have
[2:02:08] had Nathan killed and Nathan would have
[2:02:11] never preached another
[2:02:14] sermon so what's the important part
[2:02:16] right
[2:02:18] here having Nathan killed is it's kind
[2:02:22] of like turning off your preacher and
[2:02:24] saying I'm not going to listen to him no
[2:02:27] more
[2:02:30] amen and God has given you an
[2:02:34] access now watch his watch
[2:02:37] him watch what David does he
[2:02:41] immediately
[2:02:44] repents David's got innocent blood on
[2:02:47] his
[2:02:49] hands brother brandom talks about what
[2:02:51] what will you do with this Jesus called
[2:02:55] Christ he's talking to
