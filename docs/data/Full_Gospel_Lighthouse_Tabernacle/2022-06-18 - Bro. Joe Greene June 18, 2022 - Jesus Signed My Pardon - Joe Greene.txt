amen separated from god amen but i thank god that his grace is sufficient to take care of me amen blessed be the name of the lord god bless you this evening certainly an honor and a privilege to be here i'm going to keep you standing for just a minute because i'm going to be standing it's certainly an honor to be here tonight just a real privilege and a joy for me uh we haven't been here since last labor day i guess it was but we're here tonight and i believe that god has orchestrated this service from before the foundation of the world amen you may think well it's just brother joe just another service but i believe tonight if we come looking for just another service that's what we'll get but i know you're taught well enough to know that we don't come just for another service brother gabriel we come to see god amen and i i have already seen him i've already seen him this evening i just sitting back there and you know as a minister i i don't know how these other brothers are but myself sometimes i i'm a lot like my daddy i like to get into the service and catch the spirit of what's going on you know daddy was that way brother ron as you well know and he could catch the spirit and i pray i have just a little bit of that tonight amen but i sat back there and i was looking at some other thoughts and it just it just wasn't settling amen it just wasn't settling tonight so i just kept lord what am i going to do what do you want me to do what do you want me to say and then i come to these notes that i have before me this evening and then brother shannon began to sing those last songs those last courses and i said thank you lord that's where we need to go so tonight i'm going to preach on jesus signed my pardon amen i know that's simple but that's all right i believe our god hides and reveals himself in simplicity this evening amen so as you're finding your place in the book of romans chapter 8 tonight i just like to thank you for your prayers for my sister mary and her family last weekend we buried her husband of almost 50 years and this is actually the second husband that she lost her first husband died at the ripe young age of 27 with uh colon cancer and i had a terrible death but you know whenever he was dying he was wading up down the streets of or up the riverbank looking for a shallow place to cross he said i want to die i know i'm going to but i'm just waiting for that right spot to cross over and he went home to be with the lord so i the brother dean here last week just unexpectedly uh picture of health for the most part and not really sick of any sort but it just goes to show you when your number is up and when god gets ready to take you home brother ernie then it's your time amen so it behooves you and i to make sure that we're ready for that hour because we don't know in such an hour when the son of man cometh or when he calls us home you know a few years ago we were in the philippines and i spoke at a meeting there and the theme of the meeting was rapture ready and i responded to that i said if you ain't ready to die and meet god tonight you ain't ready for a rapture amen so i i believe tonight that we as a people of god we want to be ready we want to be prepared because we know that the lord is coming for us one way or the other tonight amen so i thank you again for your remembrance in your prayers and your thoughts and and also just remind your camp meeting this year will be august 2 through 5 and uh trust that some of you will get to come i know some of you are planning to and we certainly appreciate the support and uh you're coming and being a part of the meetings and we're gonna have two of the finest speakers i know of whether ron spencer and brother donny reagan and uh if you come i know you'll get fed amen i know you'll be blessed by the word of god and by the ministry of these precious brothers and we certainly appreciate them both appreciate their stand for the gospel to stand for mission work you know we all ought to be missionaries you know i got in trouble one time brother ron i went to a certain place and certain brother was showing me his two boats and i said you know what you could sell one of those and support a missionary he never has to forgive me for that he's a he's a good fisherman amen but you know uh we we have a we have a a vision in our hearts and we're following the vision that god gave my dad many years ago and was just showing some pictures today from the early meetings in the schoolhouse there and ruth and uh it just brings back a lot of memories and a lot of things that the lord has done forgive me for taking just a minute but i i i gotta relax my nerves amen but we we just thanking god for what he has done and all the the help that's been afforded to the brethren in the foreign field the churches built i think brother ron mentioned it here a while back some years ago before dad had passed i think the the the number then was something over 500 different churches that we've helped to build and uh you know it's it's a it's a wonderful thing to give them a book to give them a track to lead them to the lord but if they don't have a place to come together to fellowship like you have here and it won't be it won't be as nice as this it may just be a a brick hut or a bad i know we were there the philippines a few years ago and the brother was needing to put some walls on his church so i asked him how much it would cost and uh the figure came back a hundred and twenty dollars to put walls around the church brother vernon it's just a bamboo sheeting you know woven together bamboo strips but 120 and it just happened to be my birthday so guess what i bought me for my birthday some walls on a church amen so i know those little people there are rejoicing amen in a little church amen so god bless you tonight may we just bow our hearts in prayer precious heavenly father lord how we counted a grand privilege to stand in this sacred place tonight lord where men of god that have stood here lord that you've used mightily and lord that they've spoken your word with great impact and great uh influence upon the people and tonight lord we we want to have that kind of a service that your word would have such an impact that would be moving and stirring in the hearts of your children and lord tonight as i sat back there in the study and just just couldn't settle lord and and i just kept asking you which direction to go and and lord as i looked at this earlier and i thought well you know i'll just put that on the back burner but you just wouldn't let me go the other direction and i i don't know why lord but i believe with all of my heart that you can take this unworthy servant tonight lord and move the man aside you can speak through lips of claim god the words that need to be heard here this evening god i don't know the hearts of the people i don't know their day-to-day struggles i don't know their lives but i do know you and i do know that you know tonight lord so i ask father that you would just come take preeminence in every heart and in every life speak through lips of clay hear through ears of clay tonight lord and let hearts receive the dropping of the word and let your word bring forth of its kind grant it tonight father as we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of our lord jesus christ we humbly pray amen praise the lord romans chapter 8 this evening we want to read verse number 28 through 32 before you have your seats tonight and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things amen may the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word tonight as you have your seeds now i desire that you would just pray for me that the lord will help me this evening to to get out of the way and let him do the preaching amen praise the lord the scripture tells us here we know i want to ask you tonight how many knows that all things that means the good the bad the ugly the ups the downs the ins and outs all things brother dan used to testify and give the definition of that word all all inclusive without exception every one amen all things work together for good to them that love god amen that's a wonderful thing them that love god but it doesn't stop there it says to them who are the called according to his purpose how many knows god's got a purpose tonight amen and we we believe that we are a part of that purpose amen for whom he did for no that means to know beforehand he also did predestinate predetermined amen he knew what this one would choose and he knew what that one would choose so he predestinated us by that foreknowledge of knowing what our choice would be now i know you've heard these things over and over again but just bear with me amen and we'll we'll get somewhere if god will help us this evening amen he said moreover whom he did predestinate or predetermine that they would choose to serve him amen uh he also justified and that word justified means just as if i'd never done it in the first place amen you know i sometimes at home if i mention justification i'll have the brother to drop down the screen that says wide amen as it can be and i said that's what my record looks like this morning this evening amen it's white it's clean and why is that because of of what we said our title is going to be jesus signed my pardon amen he goes on here moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified do you realize tonight sitting here amen if you have been justified you have been sanctified amen you've also been glorified amen you know we look around and sometimes we say well that's just brother so-and-so and sister so and so but you better be careful because they're sons and daughters of god they have already been glorified in the eyes of god and i want you to understand tonight amen what god has done in your life if you've been born again by the spirit of god filled with the holy ghost amen god has glorified you amen and you are just as just as pure as god is by the shed blood of jesus christ and not amen he said what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us i want to ask you tonight who can be against the bride of jesus christ who can be against a blood walls a man blood bought a sinless son and daughter of god amen i want to tell you not even the devil himself can't bring up your past with any stick them to it amen you know in a court of law when the opposing side comes up and they say well he did this and he did that and he did that i want you to understand when the devil comes accusing you this evening amen when he brings it before the great judge of almighty uh almighty god amen god says that's been stricken from the record that has no more value that's not any any consequence amen it's all been done away why because i have signed his pardon amen and he can now go free now that word pardon this evening if we look at it it means release from your guilt amen i want you to understand tonight amen you have been released from your guilt you're no longer guilty amen you're no longer guilty this evening you have been set free tonight amen and we're going to get to it in a little bit but let me just go ahead amen you remember the story brother branham told about the the soldier that ran in the heat of battle and and you know his friend came to abraham lincoln saw him in a restaurant or whatever and asked brother um president lincoln rather for a pardon amen he just took a napkin turned it over and wrote on there amen i abraham lincoln do hereby pardon whatever his name was and the friend took it back to the prison and the guy would not accept it as a pardon i want you to understand if you don't accept that jesus has signed your pardon it will do you no good this evening but if you recognize hey i am free i have been delivered amen there's a story told about amen i believe brother branham mentions it about a guy that's sitting in an electric chair he's got the the thing on his head he's got a band on his arm a band on his leg amen and then all of a sudden here comes somebody busting in the door amen and declares i've got a pardon for him i've got a pardon for him brother branham said that man is just just as free as if he was walking the street because the pardon has been signed amen and his deliverance has been hand delivered i want you to understand tonight amen your pardon has been hand delivered by god himself he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but should have everlasting life this evening amen now we look and we read romans 8 28 to 32 from the lexum bible and it says and we know that all things work together for good to those who love god toward those who are called according to his purpose because god because those whom he foreknew he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son so that he should be the first one among many brothers and those whom he predestinated amen these he also called and justified and these he also glorified what then shall we say about these things if god be for us who can be against us indeed he did not spare his own son but gave him up for a soul how will he not also together with him freely give us all things amen so god has given us not only our salvation but he's given us our healing he's given us our deliverance he's given us our victory he's given us our joy he's given us our peace he's given us everything that we have need of in this christian experience tonight and he's given it to us freely this evening amen and it's there for us to take advantage of but we've got to take advantage of it and not just let it lay on the shelf and say well it looks good or it sounds good amen you remember brother man i'm talking about the old colored man in the museum there looking in the glass case amen looking at that dress that was there amen and brother man i'm asking dad what what's this all about why are you so tore up he said you see that little garment there amen you see that red spot said that's the blood of abraham lincoln well i hear tonight amen i'm not here to share abraham lincoln's blood but i'm here to tell you about the blood of jesus christ amen that cleansed me and saved me from my sins and i he made a way that i could be called a son of god that i could be delivered in this hour and recognized by the shannon amen that i am no longer guilty i'm no longer a slave to sin i'm no longer bound by chains of doubt and confusion and hardship and trouble jesus signed my pardon amen that word predestinated means to know beforehand to know previously to take into account or specially consider beforehand do you realize before the foundation of the world brother gabriel god specially considered you he looked down through the eons of time amen and he looked over the banister of eternity and he looked down here on a saturday night in the month of june amen right before father's day and he recognized amen i am that boy's father and he is going to produce characteristics just like me he's going to produce a seed amen that comes from me his life is going to be a testimony of my grace and of my mercy and of my love oh let me tell you i could go down the aisle tonight and pick every one of us amen god saw you before the foundation of the world and he knew you this evening and i want to tell you if god is for me it doesn't matter what kind of pawn shop the devil sells me in it doesn't matter what kind of trap he gets me in it doesn't matter how low i go or how low i get drugged down thank god his grace is vision and his mercy is everlasting amen his hand amen reaches further down than you or i could reach up tonight [Applause] predestinate also means to grant prior acknowledgement or recognition to someone so god before the foundation of the world he granted you prior recognition prior acknowledgement amen he knew you always sing a song sometime he knew me yet he loved me amen when he was on the cross i was on his mind i'm the reason that he went to the cross i'm the reason that he carried it up the hill i'm the reason that he had the stripes upon his back i'm the reason that he was born come on now help me preach i'm the reason this evening amen that he gave his life i'm the reason that he paid the price i'm the reason that he became sin who knew no sin that we might become the righteousness of god in him you know so many people when it comes time for communion they have such a hard time understanding that he has made us meet in other words we didn't do it ourselves we didn't clean ourself up we didn't save ourselves he has made us meet he brother vernon has made us worthy tonight amen it's not by our righteousness it's by his righteousness this evening i know this is simple you may think amen it's not a message message but i want to tell you what's the greatest message you ever heard amen that jesus christ loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life and i'm so glad that he came this evening i'm so glad amen that he took upon himself a robe of flesh that i might become the righteousness of god in him now that word predestinate it's used when it's speaking about people or persons to approve beforehand you know you go down to the bank you get ready to buy a car you go down to the bank and you say i want to get pre-approved for a certain amount to buy a car or a certain amount to buy a house that means you are approved beforehand that means all you got to do is go pick out your car or pick out your house and tell them i've been pre-approved i want to tell you something tonight church you have been pre-approved by god amen you have been chosen in him before the foundation of the world he has ordained you to life amen the salvation of every believer is known and determined beforehand in the mind of god before the foundation of the world amen romans 8 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren amen so we we are chosen in him amen we we were conformed to the image of his son tonight brother adam would tell us in the message of children of israel he said sometimes i feel like a runaway slave speaking about the the slave there in philemon i believe it is he said when paul found him he wrote back to his master and he said don't then brother bob says put all that he owes you put it on my bill and i'll pay you when i come when i think of that i think of paul there a great christian how that his heart knew that there was a great charge against him and christ by his own blood wrote his pardon at the cross and took his place and he knowed how to feel for other people amen wouldn't it be wonderful if we all had that feeling tonight amen this afternoon brother madam said just take their fault and lay it upon me let me if we'd hear or bear one another's burdens like that now that's the way god wants it this evening he wants us to be considerate of our brother and of our sister you know so many times amen when someone uh maybe slips out into the world and then then god gets a hold of their heart and they come back amen you know what we want to do with our self-righteous attitude many times we want to look down our long nose and say look where they been look what they've done amen but i want to tell you something if they have repented and they have put it underneath the blood of jesus christ god himself cannot find it tonight god himself cannot bring it up with andrew he will not because it no longer exists in the mind of god god can't remember it against you again now the devil won't let you forget it in your humanity he brings it up and he reminds you you did this and you did that and i say devil show me the record you said i did it and my mind tries to make me remember it but i want you to know go to god's record and see what god says about it amen god's record is clear god says amen there's nothing against me this evening amen romans 8 1 there is therefore now not going to be now everybody say now there is therefore now no condemnation to them that be in christ jesus so if you are in christ tonight you don't have to live under condemnation you don't have to live with the devil holding something over your head look what you did look what you said amen but devil i remember what i did when i did that and recognized i was wrong i got on my knees and i asked god to forgive me and let me tell you devil jesus signed my pardon amen it's gone it's not there anymore amen and you cannot bring it up against me you can't hold it against me because god has cleansed me and made me white as snow tonight amen romans 8 27 and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god what's the will of god this evening jesus or the word tells us amen that god sent forth his son into the world that the world might be saved do you realize salvation is for every living human on the earth but so many won't accept it so many won't receive it they'll say oh you know that's for the religious fanatics that's for those people amen that believe in jesus that believe in god and they refuse to accept it just like the soldier boy amen but i want you to understand what did the supreme court of our land say it's not a pardon unless it is accepted as a pardon jesus said i come to seek and to save my own because he knew the rest of them brother josh wouldn't accept it amen matthew 1 21 this refers back to the announcement of of the birth of jesus she shall bring forth a son and thou shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins verse 23 behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name immanuel which being interpreted is god with us and i want you to understand amen that that same god is with us here tonight he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you even in you even to the end of the way and he is here tonight amen if you're if you're sitting under the sound of our voice tonight whether you're here in the invisible audience and you've never received salvation you've never accepted the lord jesus christ amen that's what this service is all about amen that you can recognize that your pardon has been signed and you can now go free this evening you don't have to live as a slave any longer you don't have to be bound by sin any longer why because you recognize there has been a pardon sign and i am receiving that this evening brother adam tells us in proof of his resurrection he said that's the gospel the gospel is that that christ died in the sinner's place that christ taken the sick man's place christ taken the sinner's place christ taken the worried man's place christ taken the maniacs place christ took every place and freed us from every affliction and every sin that the devil put us in the prison house by christ came to pardon us freely everything goes free amen oh i tell you if you're a worrywort you've been set free if you got worries you've been set free if you've got troubles you've been set free if you've got sickness you've been set free anymore brother joe how come i don't see the results of it have you truly accepted it amen first corinthians 6 and 11 says and such were some of you but he didn't stop there he said but you are washed you are sanctified amen and you are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god we used to be sinners you know we say we're sinners saved by grace that we are we thank god for his grace we sang about it earlier but you know we need to declare amen i'm no longer a sinner i'm a son of god i'm a child of the king i have been set free i have been delivered amen i have i have received my pardon and i'm no longer a slave to sin amen colossians 1 15 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature amen verse 18 colossians 1 18 it said and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence and that's what he's desiring tonight is to have preeminence in your life amen to lead you and guide you and the only way he can do that tonight is if you fully accept the pardon and yield yourself to him and allow him to lead you and guide you and direct you and if you do that tonight listen he's going to have the preeminence this evening amen hebrews 1 and 6. i like to quote a lot of scripture or read a lot of scripture some i quote and some are read but i i believe that when we have our foundation in the word of god amen and i believe the message with all of my heart and you i've shared some of that with you will some more amen but i believe that the message came out of the bible amen now revelation chapter 1 and verse 5 tells us and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood now i want you to understand tonight it wasn't the blood of a jew it wasn't the blood of a greek or a gentile it was the blood of god himself it was a created blood spotless sinless it had no sin in it amen it wasn't it wasn't designed amen by the act of sinful uh lust or sinful act this evening it was a spoken word gene cell blood cell of god that god spoke and planted in the womb of mary and it brought forth the son of god a man who knew no sin he didn't have no sin brother randall if he was a sinner amen and had sin in himself amen then you and i have no hope this evening but because he was sinless he was spotless god himself testified when he was there being baptized by john a voice out of heaven said behold this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell or well please amen god testified this is the perfect sacrifice his blood amen will cover not just cover but annihilate the sins of men you know whenever the children of israel brought their sacrifice they laid their hands on the head of that sacrifice and the priest took a knife or a stone or whatever he had and slit the throat the the worshiper had his hands on it as the blood dripped out of that little lambs or turtle of his throat amen and he identified with that lamb i want you to understand tonight amen i have a lamb that i identify with and his name brother demi is jesus christ and his blood was shed for me and not only amen this blood that was shed by the priest amen for the worshiper there amen it only covered their sin but this lamb that shed his blood for me tonight it done away with my sin and it's no longer remembered against me amen the record is clean the record is wide i am as pure as the driven snow tonight why because i have accepted my pardon i have received amen what god has done for me tonight he has made me free this evening my bible said he whom the son has made free is free indeed amen brother bottom tells us in the message the faith that was once delivered to the saints he said if you were sitting in prison we referred to this set to die nine o'clock in the morning they had all your hair shaved off and a big helmet on and your sleeve on the left side rolled up a big brass band around it over your right leg a man was standing with a switch in his hand getting ready to press the button and and he somebody run through the door don't do it don't do it don't do it just in the nick of time amen and he said i've got a pardon from the governor that man is just as free listen you hear brother madam on the tape and someone comes before him and they're not a christian brother ron and he asked them would you like to be a christian and they said yes i would he said all right sister or all right brother he said look he's already called you a brother it don't take in eternity but andrew all you got to do is accept it when the offer is made accept it receive it how many times do we hear brother branham say just just lift your hand now that's an act of faith that shows that you believe it that shows that you accept it sister anna amen and when you when you do that then it you can just say if you hold that faith in your heart it's just as well done as it ever will be brother bynum goes on in that quote he says in every man and woman here tonight who can recognize that this is the faith that we're preaching the faith that you believed for years that was delivered to the saints first that jesus came to pardon you and taken you out of your prison cells of sickness and sin your pardon is freely signed christ signed it with his own blood for he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we're healed he said you're free where's he signed it the book says so two thousand years ago not one word has ever failed after a hundred billion years roll on she will never still never fail god once speaks it he can't take it back i can speak and take it back so can you but once he speaks it it is settled forever i want you to understand amen when he said father forgive them for they know not what they do amen those men that crucified him those standing around their sins were forgiven just as much as yours is because he forgave them whether they accepted it whether they walked on in salvation or not i don't know amen but they were forgiven this evening amen jesus signed your pardon he made a way for you this evening i know this is simple it's okay it's the greatest message you'll ever hear if you need it you know somebody offered a millionaire a million dollars he said well i don't really need it i've got plenty you know it wouldn't do no good he didn't accept it but if you accept salvation oh my it'll change your life tonight amen romans 5 6-10 for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet per venture for a good man would some even dare to die but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him amen for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life oh don't you realize tonight amen he has reconciled us oh my he has brought us back into a right relationship with him amen and now amen through that amen we shall be saved by his life this evening amen matthew 3 17 speaks about a voice from heaven this is my beloved son we quoted it earlier in whom i am well pleased second corinthians 5 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him amen oh i tell you this evening amen so many times we look and we we look at ourself listen don't look at yourself that worshiper he identified with that lamb he laid his hands on it amen he recognized that that lamb was dying in his place amen but that lamb could not take away his desire to continue to sin but i'm here to tell you tonight my lamb amen not only did he shed his blood for me but he took away the desire for sin amen i'm no longer bound by the lustful desires i'm no longer bound by sin i'm no longer bound by ideas amen that would lead me astray thank god i have been set free jesus signed my pardon this evening he became sin who knew no sin didn't say he sinned he became sin who knew no sin that i might become the righteousness of god in him amen first john 4 10 herein is love not that we love god let me just stop there i wasn't looking for god i i lived in church practically my whole life and i had ideas i had thoughts i was doing things i shouldn't be doing i was going down the road i shouldn't be going brother ron but after friday night service brother roby turner preached at the church after friday night service when dad and the brothers went out to mcdonald's that's all we had back then to get something to eat i went home and i want to tell you something god was dealing with my heart in that service that friday night and you know what i did i didn't want to accept it i didn't want to receive it i held on to the pew brother vernon but as dad let me out at the house i went in my room you know dad was pretty strict he wouldn't let us listen to just anything brother jim so i turned on big wag efm gospel station and i turned it on as i was getting ready for bed and the next thing i know i found myself on my knees calling out to god i'm lost i'm a sinner i need salvation i got up the next morning with dad and my brother-in-law somewhere and dad was talking about some people that repented the night before and got saved when we were baptized and he said there's two of them i said no dad there's three he said who's the third one i said that's me amen because i had given my heart to the lord and i wanted to do it right i wanted to take the next step a lot of people they'll repent amen and then they'll sit around and say well you know it'll come after a while i'm here to tell you tonight don't wait if god's dealt with your heart and you've repented the next step is baptism taken on the name of the lord jesus christ amen and when you do that then you have a promise amen that if you'll do that he will fill you with the holy ghost and that's the seal amen that you don't grieve until the day of your redemption this evening [Applause] romans 4 25 who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification oh it's wonderful that he came it's marvelous that he died amen but the bible said amen he was raised for our justification amen listen you know that the story goes a man that they come and carried him away and and drug the roman soldiers or whatever caused them to go to sleep and then they took his body away and it kept being found they paid the roman soldiers to tell that story amen but i want you to know something this morning or this evening amen i know he lives how do i know he lives because he lives in my heart he changed me he took the desires for the things of the world out of me he took the desires for sin out of me and thank god he put a new desire amen and you know what that desire is tonight i want to see jesus because he died for me this evening i want to see and look upon those jasper walls i want to look upon the streets of gold but i want to see jesus amen because he's the one that signed my pardon he's the one tonight brother ernie that made a way of escape from me he's the one tonight that delivered me he's the one that set me free this evening [Applause] he rose that i might live also he lives he lives tonight where he lives within my heart this evening ii corinthians 4 15 for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound unto the glory of god we go back to romans 8 28 all things work together for the good of them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose god has a purpose this evening listen god created the angels he created them to serve and to worship he created the seraphims and the cherubims he created them amen to cry holy holy holy lord god almighty amen and that's all they know you know there's one song that says we'll join the angel singing amazing grace the angels don't know nothing about amazing grace they've never been lost they've never been in the muck and mire of sin they don't understand what salvation is all about they might question why does our father amen why does our creator why did he condescend down and go down and save andrew spencer why did he shed his blood amen for him amen and pardon him you know why i did because he knew that he placed something in andrew spencer before the foundation of the world that he would come out here and he would sing you happy amen and seeing you into an atmosphere of worship tonight and lead you to worship god and then he would come forth and preach the word of god and god would come down and deal with your hearts amen and let that seed begin to take root and begin to grow in you and you would begin to bring forth the life of jesus christ i want you to understand deny the devil don't like that amen but god had a purpose this evening and god's purpose is being fulfilled in brother ron and brother brother andrew brother william brother nade amen and each one of you this evening if we yield ourselves to him you know it's not our purpose it's god's purpose we are called according to his purpose and his purpose is that he would be god above his people in creation he would be god with his people in redemption and he would be god in his people in this dispensation in which we live in amen and that purpose is that lit this lost and dying world that you work with and works around you you go to school with you go to work with you go to walmart with in the grocery store with amen they need to see a representation of almighty god they may never darken full gospel lighthouse tabernacle up on the hill they may never sit in the pew where you sit but your life will be a witness to them your life will be a testimony brother gabriel to all those troopers you work with amen your life brother ron it'll be a witness and it is to people around the world amen showing them that jesus christ is alive and well you know so many times we have critics and they try to say all manner of things against us and against what god is doing but i want you to understand tonight jesus had critics too but it didn't stop him he just kept pride on doing what he was purposed to do he kept right on doing what god ordained for him to do and he walked right up to the cross and laid himself down stretched out his arm brother ernie and said no man takes my life i give it and as he was hanging there trying to catch his breath men standing around he was the son of god why don't he save himself the one cross one thief on the cross said if he is the son of god let him save himself and us ridiculed him criticized him mocked him but what did he do forgive him they don't know what they're doing oh i'll tell you this even i i don't want to be like the critics tonight i don't be like listen let them say what they want to [Applause] they're going to talk about me whether i whether whether i'm doing good or whether i'm not doing good they're going to talk about me if i testify that god's a healer they're going to talk about me they're going to talk about you brother ron if you stand up here and you dance through every service they're going to talk about you oh he's putting on he's just showing off let me tell you yes he's showing off what god can do with a man with four stage four cancer he's showing what god can do with a sinner saved by grace he's showing what god's mercy is he's showing what god's grace is he's showing the power of a redeemed savior he's showing the living god manifesting right in the midst of this people this evening criticize it's all right we know where we stand we know what god's doing [Applause] i've spent the last few days with brother ron and his family different brothers and sisters that was around and i've seen some bad days brother ron is he's an actor he loves drama in school that right he puts on a front so that nobody knows what he goes through but him his family and jesus and i want you to understand if his family don't see it jesus does i know his family does they recognize they recognize the deal that he deals with is this all right brother ron i didn't ask you if i could do this but i believe the lord put it in my heart to do it so i'm going to do it he give me a liver he gave me liberty they won't look at him say he's acting they say he's not sick why would a man spend the money that he's spending to go through all the testing take all the medication that makes him so sick that he can't hardly function but yet he still gets up he's like listen if i have a little headache and i don't feel like doing something you know what i do i think look what brother ron's going through look what he's dealing with my headache ain't nothing my toe ache ain't nothing god has placed him among us for a reason you may think oh it's just a a a quirk of nature that he's that he's going through this let me tell you my bible said all things cancer tuberculosis sugar high blood pressure god don't make you sick he didn't make job sick either but he allowed the hand of the enemy to touch him he allowed the hand of the enemy why did he do that so that he could show in the end god's power to keep and to deliver and to heal and to restore and to make new again and to replenish amen he allowed that to show the world i am jehovah jireh i am the creator i am the provider i am the healer i am the waymaker i am the deliverer i am i am i am the devil don't like it but i do the devil gets mad but i'm glad i preached a message one time the devil's mad but i'm glad [Applause] the devil's mad at a demon destroyer the devil's upset at a devil castor elder the devil's mad at a holy ghost word preacher but us holy ghost word preachers are happy to put him in his place where is his place it's under our feet tonight we have been called to be more than conquerors we have been called to be overcomers in this hour amen and so overcome that means you have to have a battle that means you have to have a fight but thank god i'm not in this fight alone i want you to understand god's got this god's got this too [Applause] i told him at my brother-in-law's funeral last week i said if you ever hear that joe green has died don't believe it and let me just get personal if you ever hear that brother ron has met his reward died don't believe it he can't die the house that we live in it may die but the real me the real brother ron the real brother andrew all these other brothers all of you that have been born again cannot die why because christ has died for you he has signed your pardon you can now go free you know whenever the writer wrote that song he was just thinking about maybe a freedom from sin freedom from a jail sentence but reality brother andrew to a real believer it's freedom from death we don't have to die brother joe we've had so many funerals if they were believers they just went to sleep went to the cemetery with my brother-in-law on monday i said we're not here to bury brother dean we're here to plant him how many farmers we got in the house flower growers seed planters when you sisters go you brothers go when you plant your corn in the garden or your flower bulbs you don't expect it to stay there you expect after a certain period of time there's a little shoot going to come up out of the ground and the next thing you know it's going to put forth some leaves and then some buds and then there's going to be some beautiful flowers some corn or some green beans or whatever amen you are expecting a return because you're just planting it you didn't bury it for it to stay there amen but it's got to rot it's got to die but because it does that it shows that there's life in it and it's going to come forth again amen let me move on brother adelman said in the message faith that was once delivered to the saints as we close this evening musicians you can come and every man or woman in here tonight that can recognize that this is the faith that we are preaching the faith that you believed for years that was delivered to the saints first that jesus come to pardon you and taken you out of your prison cells of sickness and sin your pardon is freely signed christ signed it with his own blood for he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed already done past tense you're free where does he sign it the book says so two thousand years ago and not one word has ever failed and after a hundred billion years roll on she will still never fail god once breaks it he can't take it back i can speak and take it back so can you but once he speaks it's settled for ever not till the next revival you know so many people they'll come and they'll get a quickie and they're good to the next revival or the next service then they'll want to come back and get another quickie i'm here to tell you you need more than just a quickie you need an old-fashioned holy ghost birth you need to be born again of the spirit of god you need to be changed from the inside out and if you ever get that you know brother dan used to talk about his son davey davey still doesn't serve the lord but brother dan had a desire to see him serve god and brother dan always made the statement he said if god ever does for davey what he did for me i won't have to worry about him anymore and a few parents sitting here with lost children backslid children out of fellowship children if god ever does for them what he did for you what what keeps you coming back service after service after service there's so many things in this in this world brother thomas that are distracting and pulling and drawing and trying to to get people to leave the message and leave the word and all these things but there's something there's something down on the inside of you brother randy that keeps you coming back and it keeps drawing you it's like the song says i feel the pull and it's pulling me and it's drawing me to live in a higher plane this world listen they're they're they're so in such chaos they don't know from one day to the next what's going to be and what's going to happen listen we can't tell you the fine details but we know what the word has taught us and what the prophet has taught us and what we're seeing is the actual fulfillment of what we've been taught amen it's it's happening right before our eyes listen i grew up like like your pastor in this message my dad preached this message up and down when when brother branham came to spindale north carolina and you can find four services uh in in the registry preached in spindale my dad was an usher in those meetings it was dad's pastor that brought brother adam to spin dale and and and when when dad and his brother uncle albert they traveled up and down the countryside listened to alan and roberts and cole and the osborne and all the great names but when dad told me and told it around the world when he heard brother adam speak before he even spoke when he come out the door onto the platform before he even said evening friends dad said i found myself just weeping i found myself in tears at the presence that came with him out of that office and that wasn't that little kentucky hillbilly that was the presence of almighty god amen that came through there and dad said when i got my composure and i looked around everybody around me was in the same condition because of that presence and dad said i've heard alan i've heard cole i've heard roberts i've heard theo jones and all the w v grant and all the great preachers he said but when i heard this little little preacher from kentucky i knew there was something more amen you and i most of you how many here you saw brother branham anybody here saw brother madam in person nobody in the actual services amen none of us saw him none of us felt that presence but we we have witnesses that have testified and told us that's what it was about that's that's how it happened that's the reality of it and listen to that i'm not believing it because my daddy told me that i'm not believing it because my daddy taught me about a prophet listen when i was coming up all i heard god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet now the servants went by that we didn't hear it god sent a prophet god sent a message amen and then as time progressed and the books became available and the message became in print the tapes were available the men of god began to hear what the prophet began to say and when they began to catch the revelation of what he was saying listen it's not just to have a book it's not just to have a tape what you got to have is the reality of what was being said right down in here and that's why i'm here preaching tonight not because my daddy preached not because my daddy called me listen my daddy never called me he never told me as a preacher he told brother ron amen and through the discernment told him he's going to be a preacher told him we was going to make some trips together amen and different brothers different young ministers dad through that gift that he had he said you're going to be a preacher of the gospel you're going to preach the gospel you're going to preach the gospel but never did tell me i'm glad he didn't brother thomas because i don't want to be daddy called says connie i want to be called of god and i want you to understand when i when i come to the place to recognize amen it was a calling of god let me tell you amen i i i understood there's more to it than just playing church there's more to it than just saying well i've been called to preach there is a commitment there is a there is a something that you have to to have to have to put your nose to the grindstone as it were amen and get serious with god because what i'm doing tonight and what these brothers do when they stand here before you it's not something to take lightly because your souls rest in our hands and what we tell you a lot of people want to discredit what we tell you they want to say well it's not true and i'm trying to quit they want to say it's it you know it's it's just a man-made thing but i'm here to tell you i have seen and you have to this message works this message works amen and it's it's not a fly-by-night message it's not a message that's up to day and down tomorrow this message is straight solid settled because this message is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever stand with me tonight so we buy our bow our heads in prayer [Applause] ever hear about every eye closed tonight maybe you're here and you're straddling the fence you don't know if this is true you wonder maybe have your questions your concern what what is it all about [Music] i maybe you're saying i've never accepted this free pardon of sin i've never surrendered my heart to the lord jesus i don't understand it i don't know what it's all about but tonight maybe something was said that would just prick your hearts [Music] and cause you to recognize that what he did he did for you the salvation that he provided the pardon that he so freely signed with his own blood was for you would you just slip up your hand say brother joe it was for me tonight i i've not given my heart to the lord like i ought to but i want to tonight every head bowed no eyes looking this is between you and god it's not between your neighbors not between me and you it's between you and god god knows your heart this evening maybe you just want to take another step step out of your seat and come up here to the front and let us pray with you tonight that god would give you that full assurance of that free pardon of sin amen would you just receive it tonight it's yours jesus has signed the pardon [Music] will there be another that would want to come say pray for me pray for me brothers you talk to him right out of your heart it's between you and him tonight he said call and i will answer and i'll show you great and mighty things that you know not of just submit yourself to him heavenly father tonight you see these precious ones lord that have come you see the ones lord that lifted their hands maybe lord they they're not ready to take that next step but god why would they want to hold back tonight you have made a way you have provided lord and you've signed

received it there is where it was settled the old account was settled on that saturday night june the 18th 2022 granite and our father minister to these hearts we pray to each one of us tonight lord
