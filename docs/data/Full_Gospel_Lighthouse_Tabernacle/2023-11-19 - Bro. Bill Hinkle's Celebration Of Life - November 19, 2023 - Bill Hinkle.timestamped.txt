[24:00] again we love you Dad we miss
[24:14] you God bless you today we thank you for
[24:17] all Gathering here today to honor our
[24:20] our brother brother Bill and We Gather
[24:24] here today this is not a a time of
[24:26] necessary
[24:28] um necessarily um sadness on our hearts
[24:31] um it's it's it's sadness that we've
[24:33] lost a friend but we recognize that
[24:35] we've not lost our brother because we
[24:37] know exactly where he can be found at
[24:40] but we've come to celebrate the life of
[24:42] our brother Bill Hinkle today and as we
[24:44] reflect on his journey we remember he
[24:48] was a devoted Deacon a devoted husband a
[24:50] cherished friend and a man whose heart
[24:52] overflowed with love and Bill's life was
[24:55] marked by his unwavering faith and
[24:58] commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[25:01] the Lord Jesus Christ was highest place
[25:03] in brother Bill's life the Lord guided
[25:06] his every step and shaped his character
[25:09] and as I was thinking and reflecting
[25:11] over brother Bill's life these
[25:12] scriptures came to me from Psalms
[25:15] chapter
[25:16] 63 David said oh God Thou Art my God
[25:20] early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth
[25:23] for thee my flesh longth for thee in a
[25:26] dry and thirsty land land where no water
[25:28] is to see thy power and thy Glory so as
[25:32] I have seen thee in the sanctuary
[25:34] because thy loving kindness is better
[25:37] than life my lips shall praise thee and
[25:40] you begin to think about brother Bill
[25:42] Hinkle's life in a in a hole I begin to
[25:45] think about the value of Life about how
[25:48] that this man's life had changed every
[25:50] person that is here and that is
[25:52] represented and I'd say that the
[25:54] building couldn't hold how many people
[25:55] brother Bill actually ministered to and
[25:58] his life affected because many of his
[26:01] friends have already went on beyond the
[26:03] scene but we know and recognize as David
[26:06] would say here that thy loving kindness
[26:08] is better than life and life is such a
[26:10] very powerful powerful thing and we
[26:12] recognize that God is the author of life
[26:16] life is what controls us and we are
[26:18] known by the life that we live and it's
[26:21] been said that your life speaks so loud
[26:23] that I can't hear your testimony so
[26:26] therefore it's a it's it's better to
[26:28] live a sermon than it is to preach one
[26:32] and Bill brother Bill definitely did
[26:34] that the life you live shows what
[26:36] character that you are because the life
[26:38] that you live it always builds your
[26:41] character and the life that you live it
[26:44] reflects where you are or where you are
[26:47] somewhere else is from and you what you
[26:49] are doing in this life is you are
[26:51] reflecting the dimension that you're
[26:53] from and we can look at brother Bill's
[26:55] life throughout all of his life we can
[26:57] look back and you can see that he proved
[26:59] he was a Christian by his life by the
[27:02] way that he lived by the way that he was
[27:04] an example and I believe that is
[27:06] something that our brother Bill did
[27:08] exceptionally well he lived from where
[27:10] he came from
[27:12] eternity by how one lives and preaches
[27:15] life sermon it is the evidence of where
[27:18] his Allegiance lie and I'll say that
[27:20] brother Bill preached his sermon well
[27:24] brother Bill's life exemplified the
[27:26] profound impact faith can have not just
[27:28] in words but in actions that reflect the
[27:31] love that he had for others he was a
[27:33] true pillar in our church community and
[27:36] in our local community bill was not only
[27:38] a man of Faith but a man of works his
[27:41] generosity knew no bounds and his giving
[27:43] heart touched the lives of many in a
[27:46] world that often measures success in
[27:48] grand gestures brother Bill showed us
[27:51] that the small acts of kindness done
[27:53] with love are the ones that leave an
[27:56] enduring Legacy as David would say thy
[27:59] loving kindness is better than life and
[28:02] there must be many interpretations to
[28:04] life because the life that we live here
[28:06] there are many Sorrows there are many
[28:08] heartaches there's there's many there's
[28:10] many things that come by our way where
[28:12] life gets so bad that sometimes begin to
[28:14] people begin to take their own life and
[28:16] contemplate different things and but we
[28:19] recognize that David wasn't necessarily
[28:21] talking about the life that he lived and
[28:24] that's what Paul would say in Galatians
[28:26] 2 and 20 that the life that I now live I
[28:29] live in Christ Jesus so the life that
[28:31] David was speaking about not wasn't
[28:33] necessarily this humanistic side but we
[28:36] recognize that David was speaking about
[28:38] eternal life which is Zoe which is God's
[28:41] own life and we recognize when you we
[28:44] that are Bible Believers we recognize
[28:46] that in the beginning that Adam was made
[28:48] a promise that he would not die and that
[28:50] as long as he did not touch of the tree
[28:53] of the knowledge of Good and Evil Adam
[28:55] had no idea what death was about but
[28:58] because Adam's failure in the in the
[29:00] Garden of Eden all men had to come to
[29:03] this appointment because God had
[29:05] breathed the very Breath of Life into
[29:07] Adam and that is the same exact thing
[29:10] that brother Bill had breathed into him
[29:12] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he
[29:15] attained what is the greatest
[29:17] achievement that there in there ever can
[29:19] be and ever will be be attained is to be
[29:21] a real Born Again Son of God and brother
[29:25] Bill did that with great honor
[29:28] but Adam was told that the day that he
[29:30] would eat of that tree of knowledge
[29:32] thereof that day he was going to die but
[29:34] if you study history out it tells us
[29:36] that that Adam lived to be a 930 years
[29:40] old but he didn't just lose his life
[29:42] when he ate it but he what did he lose
[29:44] he lost the power of life he lost the
[29:47] virtue of life he lost the quality of
[29:49] life I'll say it like this he lost the
[29:52] original life but the one that came and
[29:54] picked brother Bill and chose a a pre
[29:57] ious flower for his garden the other day
[29:59] the Redeemer of life he came and
[30:02] restored and gave life to all Humanity
[30:05] that wants to receive it and I'll say
[30:07] that brother Bill's life exemplified and
[30:10] was an expression of only one person and
[30:13] that is our Lord Jesus Christ when you
[30:15] look at his life as a husband you see
[30:18] Christ in it when you looked at his life
[30:20] as a friend you seen Christ in it and
[30:22] anybody that ever met bill they
[30:24] recognized that bill was larger than
[30:27] life life is so powerful if you do not
[30:31] understand what I speak about today I
[30:32] want you to know that it's more than
[30:34] just a shell that is setting here today
[30:36] it's about life it's about more than
[30:38] what you see in the room today life is
[30:40] only knowing Jesus Christ and if you
[30:42] don't know him you're not living but
[30:45] life is such a powerful thing that even
[30:47] when you see a pregnant mother that that
[30:50] mother that is carrying that child
[30:52] though you may not see that child in the
[30:54] physical form yet but the life of that
[30:55] little child controls that mother in
[30:58] such a way it controls her appetite it
[31:00] controls how she gets up in the morning
[31:02] it controls everything about her it's
[31:04] just like brother Bill's life he was he
[31:07] was the life on the inside of him was
[31:09] controlled by another world it was
[31:11] controlled by the life that was leading
[31:13] him in life and I'll say that brother
[31:15] Bill was a walk in Bible he was a walk
[31:19] in Bible many times preaching sermons
[31:21] here as a as a young man he would finish
[31:23] my scriptures before I would ever get
[31:25] done with him he would finish my
[31:27] thoughts and I would say as a young man
[31:29] brother Bill taught me how to be a real
[31:32] Christian these are the kind of funerals
[31:34] that a pastor dreams about because
[31:37] there's not enough words that you can
[31:38] say about a man like this but yet it
[31:40] would take all day to begin to express
[31:43] how much that he that he truly meant to
[31:46] this community and to this church and to
[31:49] think that where we were 50 years ago as
[31:51] a church at Full Gospel Lighthouse that
[31:53] the church that you see today it's more
[31:55] than a building but this Church started
[31:58] in brother Bill's basement 50 years ago
[32:01] in
[32:01] 1973 and we see how the Lord has blessed
[32:04] that and brother Bill his his the value
[32:07] of his life can never be estimated and
[32:11] it can never be it can never be
[32:13] expressed in the way of as as a human
[32:16] could but we look at the tapestry of
[32:19] brother Bill's life and there are those
[32:21] rare individuals who play a pivotable
[32:24] role in supporting and strengthening the
[32:26] leaders and Bill HL was that man he
[32:29] Stood Beside and supported brother Homer
[32:31] Frasier he empowered brother Ronald
[32:34] Spencer and empowered all of those
[32:36] around him and he made the entire
[32:39] spiritual journey of Full Gospel
[32:41] Lighthouse richer and more
[32:43] vibrant I was looking through the
[32:45] scriptures and I I was thinking about
[32:47] scriptures that would pertain to brother
[32:49] Bill and Paul wrote this in the letter
[32:52] to Timothy about the office of a deacon
[32:55] in ver chapter 3 verse 13 of the first
[32:58] book of Timothy Paul said for they that
[33:01] have used the office of a deacon well
[33:03] purchase to themselves a good degree and
[33:06] great boldness in the faith which is in
[33:08] Christ Jesus and when Paul says that
[33:10] about a man that he a purchased to
[33:13] himself a good degree that word in the
[33:16] Greek it means to take a step it is as
[33:19] of a stare and the meaning of that is
[33:21] the going up of a higher or taking an
[33:24] additional step in dignity in honor and
[33:27] and or in standing and I would say that
[33:29] brother Bill's life was one that was
[33:31] purchased of a different degree of a
[33:34] stepping higher he left behind all of
[33:36] the things that he was to take a step
[33:39] higher into Christ Jesus and as we
[33:42] contemplate the value of life let us
[33:44] remember that it's not about the length
[33:45] of our days but it's the death of our
[33:50] impact brother Bill touched every one of
[33:53] our lives from young to old there's
[33:56] probably not another man in this
[33:57] building besides brother Ron that could
[34:00] say that that we could all say that has
[34:02] had an indeed profound effect in it to
[34:05] think about the admirable goal that
[34:07] brother bill has set and he aspired we
[34:10] we should all to Aspire to have a
[34:12] positive impact on people's lives like
[34:14] brother Bill
[34:15] had the idea that one's person's actions
[34:19] and values can resonate and make a
[34:20] meaningful difference in the world is
[34:25] powerful
[34:28] there's not a greater
[34:31] man that we could
[34:33] express that Express Jesus Christ in
[34:36] this last day like brother Bill
[34:39] hin to think about the man that
[34:45] stood as a faithful Deacon as a a man of
[34:49] God to this
[34:50] community excuse
[34:53] me we all have memories of of our of our
[34:56] brother 's
[34:58] life probably wouldn't have enough time
[35:00] to tell you about all the hunting and
[35:01] fishing stories that took place of
[35:04] losing glasses in ponds and spending 45
[35:07] minutes looking for him with his
[35:11] feet cuz he was afraid to spend a
[35:16] dollar from this Valley
[35:19] being as an example of baptizing
[35:21] hundreds of thousands standing beside
[35:23] our precious brother Homer Fraser in the
[35:26] cold Waters and in the hot summers was
[35:29] standing right there and I would say
[35:31] that that's the Testament of a real
[35:34] Christian how many people could we say
[35:36] that bill Hinkle and Homer Fraser stood
[35:38] in these Waters around this Valley and
[35:40] baptized them not in the name of a
[35:43] trinity not in titles but he baptized
[35:45] them in the precious name of the Lord
[35:48] Jesus Christ there is no other name
[35:51] given amongst men where men should be
[35:53] saved but by that name the memories that
[35:56] we we have of brother Bill leading our
[35:58] youth in worship every Sunday in
[36:01] devotions of setting and leading us and
[36:04] I'd say that many of us young people
[36:06] that still have our Bibles that from
[36:08] when we were a young child it there
[36:11] there are bookmarks there that brother
[36:12] Bill constantly was giving us of
[36:14] something that had a devotional on it or
[36:16] something that we would spend our time
[36:18] reading over but to me one of the
[36:21] greatest achievements in my memory is
[36:23] the undying love that brother Bill had
[36:26] for our Lord Jesus
[36:29] Christ there's so many so many stories
[36:32] we could tell but probably one of my
[36:34] favorite memories is when brother Bill
[36:36] just four years ago was brother Bill
[36:39] enjoyed worship and brother Bill
[36:42] enjoyed he enjoyed songs like Ain't No
[36:45] Grave and I tell you if you wanted
[36:47] brother Bill to get on his feet all you
[36:48] had to do is sing Ain't No Grave and he
[36:50] was on his feet and he'd beat every
[36:52] single one of you young people down here
[36:54] Dance all the way down that aisle and
[36:56] but we got to singing that song four
[36:58] labor days ago and brother Bill was
[36:59] using a cane at that time and he'd went
[37:01] back here and used a restroom and and
[37:04] brother Bill you know he age was getting
[37:07] up on him and but when he come back
[37:08] through that back door you could see the
[37:10] spirit of the Lord start moving over top
[37:12] of him and he got down here about this
[37:13] second aisle he threw at can down and
[37:15] took off running a lap for
[37:21] Jesus Full Gospel
[37:24] Lighthouse we've been graced with the
[37:27] presence of a great man and Full Gospel
[37:29] Lighthouse Tabernacle cannot be
[37:31] mentioned without the H without honoring
[37:33] the legacy of Bill Hinkle his life his
[37:35] prayers his genuine Spirit have woven
[37:38] into the very fabric of this church and
[37:40] has left an indelible Mark that will
[37:42] continue to inspire generations to come
[37:45] Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:7 I have fought
[37:48] a good fight and I have finished my
[37:50] course I have kept the faith henceforth
[37:52] there is laid up for me a crown of
[37:54] righteousness which the Lord the
[37:55] righteous judge shall give me that day
[37:58] not to me only but to all of them that
[38:01] also love his appearing and I say
[38:04] brother Bill you fought your fight and
[38:05] you
[38:07] won I was thinking about brother Bill
[38:09] being a Sunday school teacher and would
[38:11] teach here several times for brother
[38:14] Homer and I was thinking about this a
[38:15] Sunday school teacher wrote this one
[38:18] time said a basketball in my hands is
[38:21] worth about
[38:22] $19 but a basketball in Michael Jordan's
[38:25] hands is worth about $33 million you see
[38:28] it depends it depends on Whose hands
[38:30] it's in a baseball in my hands is worth
[38:33] about $6 but a baseball in Mark
[38:35] Maguire's hands is worth $19 million it
[38:38] depends on Whose hands it's in a tennis
[38:41] racket is useless in my hands but a
[38:44] tennis racket in Pete and pross hands is
[38:47] a Wimbledon Championship it depends on
[38:50] Whose hands it's in a rod in my hands
[38:52] will keep away a wild animal but a rod
[38:54] in Moses's hands will part the mighty
[38:56] see it depends on Whose hands it's in a
[39:00] slingshot in my hands is a kid's toy but
[39:02] a slingshot in David's hand is a mighty
[39:04] weapon it depends on Whose hands that
[39:07] it's in two fish and five loaves of
[39:09] bread in my hands is is a couple of fish
[39:12] sandwiches but two fish and five loaves
[39:15] of bread in Jesus's hand will feed
[39:17] thousands it depends on Whose hands that
[39:20] it's in Nails in my hands might produce
[39:22] a birdhouse but Nails in Jesus Christ
[39:24] hands will produce salvation for the
[39:26] entire world it depends on Whose hands
[39:29] it in and when we put brother Bill into
[39:33] the hands of almighty God the other day
[39:35] it was the greatest hands that there
[39:37] ever had that ever could be put into and
[39:40] in our grief let us find comfort in the
[39:43] knowledge that Bill's Journey doesn't
[39:44] end here and as we say our good B let us
[39:47] celebrate the life of a man who not only
[39:49] belied the message of William random but
[39:51] he lived this message and every aspect
[39:54] of his being he taught it and and he
[39:56] lived it if you want to know what the
[39:58] message is you just simply look at this
[40:00] man right here and may we carry on his
[40:02] legacy by cherishing our Lord Jesus
[40:05] Christ and by honoring him rest in peace
[40:09] our brother D brother Bill de

[46:39] [Music]
[46:49] brother God bless you
[46:54] today
[47:00] today we have lost a friend we've lost a
[47:04] buddy we've lost a pillar of this
[47:07] church but really we haven't lost him he
[47:11] just graduated a little earlier than we
[47:14] would have all would have liked him to
[47:17] do I'm uh when I was writing notes for
[47:21] the sermon today I spent the week
[47:24] thinking about these things
[47:26] I I thought about uh I'm sorry if you
[47:31] didn't recognize how great a man he
[47:36] was what brought me to that that thought
[47:39] was one day I was sitting in a at a
[47:42] picnic and I heard somebody making fun
[47:45] of him I quickly defended
[47:49] him and they was talking about simple
[47:52] Bill and humble
[47:54] bill
[47:56] on that day you'll wish you had what
[47:58] Bill
[48:01] had let's go ahead and praise the Lord
[48:04] [Applause]
[48:14] amen bill was one of the greatest men
[48:16] that I've ever
[48:19] known he was an incredible
[48:23] reader he could have probably been one
[48:25] of the greatest politicians that ever
[48:27] lived cuz he knew how to shake hands and
[48:30] kiss babies and make everybody feel
[48:34] good no matter what your thought of the
[48:36] day was he could talk with you a little
[48:41] bit but the scripture that fits him the
[48:43] best and I've got several here for you
[48:45] today
[48:47] and that says and the scripture was
[48:50] fulfilled which saith Abraham believe
[48:53] God and I believe we could put bill
[48:55] Hinkle's name
[48:57] there and it was imputed unto him for
[49:01] righteousness and he was called the
[49:05] friend of God you're either his friend
[49:09] or you're you're his
[49:11] enemy the scripture Jesus tells his own
[49:14] disciples he said let not your heart be
[49:16] troubled you believe in God believe also
[49:19] in me in my father's house are many
[49:22] mansions and if it were not so I would
[49:24] have told you
[49:26] I go to prepare a place for
[49:28] you and if I go and prepare a place for
[49:31] you I will come again and receive you
[49:32] unto myself that where I am there you
[49:35] may be
[49:37] also and whether I go you know and the
[49:39] way you know Thomas saith unto him Lord
[49:43] we we know not whether thou goest and
[49:45] how can we know the way and Jesus sa
[49:49] unto him I am the way there's not a
[49:53] dozen
[49:54] ways
[49:57] it's not by your
[49:59] opinion Jesus is the
[50:03] way that's actually what's going on in
[50:06] Israel today is they're fighting for one
[50:09] piece of ground called The Temple
[50:11] Mount they're fighting for
[50:13] it and in their fight they don't want to
[50:16] just destroy the Jews but they want to
[50:18] destroy every
[50:19] Christian be careful who you line up
[50:22] with and Jesus said I am the way
[50:26] the truth and the life and to and no man
[50:29] cometh unto the father but my
[50:32] me we realize that death is a defining
[50:38] moment you're either heading in One
[50:41] Direction or you're headed in
[50:46] another Jesus actually talks more about
[50:48] hell than he does
[50:50] heaven if you know your Bible Well he
[50:53] describes what hell's going to be like
[50:55] but I want to say this to you even as we
[50:57] said here you don't have to go
[50:59] there there's still hope for you there's
[51:02] breath in your lungs your heart is still
[51:05] beating it's not my way I did it my way
[51:10] as a matter of fact that's the number
[51:11] one song in the satanic movement I did
[51:14] it my way I want to do it Jesus's
[51:19] way it is the point to where the Final
[51:22] Touch is put on one's personal life
[51:25] that's the portrait that is made the
[51:28] Masterpiece is signed and the and then
[51:31] the the painting is dried never to be
[51:34] changed
[51:36] again it is
[51:39] finished God knows when a man comes on
[51:41] the earth and he knows the day that he
[51:43] will
[51:45] leave I would say this and this best
[51:47] describes brother
[51:49] Bill He Who Walks With God is
[51:54] immortal
[51:56] he looked to where he was aging but he
[51:58] was Immortal his hair was turning
[52:01] gray his
[52:04] eyes through Reynolds
[52:08] glasses safety glasses that was always
[52:18] dirty hell will never get
[52:23] him for a Christian
[52:26] this is as close as we'll ever get to
[52:29] hell but for an
[52:32] unbeliever this is as close you'll ever
[52:34] get to
[52:36] heaven you see God is the architect of
[52:39] our new body he was the architect of
[52:42] Adam and
[52:43] Eve God knows your days coming on the
[52:46] earth he knows when you'll come he knows
[52:48] your nature he knows what you'll look
[52:50] like and he has a Lamb's Book of Life
[52:52] that he elected before the foundation of
[52:54] the world
[52:57] bill was never one that could be rattled
[53:00] he was one that had a word for
[53:02] everything that was
[53:03] said I never seen him
[53:08] stumped God knew how he would prepare
[53:10] for his
[53:11] journey he stepped out of time and into
[53:15] out of Eternity into
[53:17] time and when he picked a wife he
[53:19] couldn't have picked a better
[53:21] one she was a real lady she was a real
[53:24] queen
[53:31] but he's waiting now on the other side
[53:33] of the
[53:34] Jordan cuz marriage isn't over with amen
[53:38] it's not over with he's young now he
[53:41] doesn't possess any gray hair he doesn't
[53:43] need a set of
[53:45] glasses I doubt he's wearing red shirts
[53:47] today but he's got a rope on he'll never
[53:52] get old he'll never fight with dementia
[53:55] ever
[53:57] again he's got special friends here
[54:00] brother Homer is on the other side of
[54:02] the river his mom and Daddy's there he
[54:04] got a daughter named Natalie that's
[54:06] there she went she went on had a
[54:10] visitation whether you believed or not I
[54:11] had a visitation with Natalie just a
[54:14] month or so ago seeing her young in her
[54:17] young
[54:18] body actually had a few words with her I
[54:23] told her how sorry I was for how
[54:24] difficult life was and she said you're
[54:26] so
[54:29] silly her arms had young hair she always
[54:32] had hair on her arms she was beautiful
[54:35] she was
[54:42] glistening told me that she'd see us in
[54:44] a few
[54:46] days I believe she's seeing bill now
[54:50] amen he's not gray-headed no
[54:53] more they probably done some d
[54:57] maning Bill's favorite scriptures are
[55:00] are are some of these for God so loved
[55:03] the world that he gave his only begotten
[55:05] son that whosoever believeth in him
[55:07] should not perish but have everlasting
[55:09] life for God sent not his son into the
[55:12] world to condemn the world but that
[55:14] through him might be saved and he that
[55:18] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[55:21] that believeth not is condemned already
[55:25] because he hath not believed in the name
[55:27] of the only begotten son and this is the
[55:30] condemnation that light cometh into the
[55:33] world and Men loved Darkness rather than
[55:36] light because their deeds were
[55:39] evil Malachi 4 and verse 5 and 6 behold
[55:43] I send you Elijah the prophet before the
[55:45] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[55:47] the Lord and he shall turn the heart of
[55:49] the fathers to the children and the
[55:51] Heart of the children to the fathers
[55:53] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[55:55] curse the Gentiles had to have a
[55:58] prophet and we had it I was thinking of
[56:02] some of the first things that bill would
[56:03] do and he would be shaking hands with a
[56:05] lot of
[56:07] friends but he would shake the hands of
[56:09] Wigan
[56:10] brandham and I would say some of his
[56:12] first words to to him was I believed
[56:15] your message with all my
[56:18] heart Revelations 10 and verse one and I
[56:21] saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven
[56:23] with a cloud and and a rainbow was upon
[56:26] his head and his face was as it were the
[56:28] Sun and feet as pillars of
[56:30] fire verse 7even but in the days of the
[56:33] voice of the Sabbath Angel when he shall
[56:35] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[56:37] be finished as he ha declared to his
[56:38] servants the
[56:40] prophet Psalms 23 he maketh me to lie
[56:43] down in Green Pastures the Lord is my
[56:45] shepherd and he maketh me to lie down in
[56:47] Green Pastures and he
[56:50] leadth and he leadth me be beside the
[56:53] Still Waters and restoreth my soul and
[56:55] he leadth me in the paths of
[56:57] righteousness for his name's sake and
[56:59] yay though I walk through the valley of
[57:00] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[57:03] for thou art with me when it came to
[57:06] this time our God becomes real to us I
[57:10] will fear no evil for thou art with me
[57:12] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[57:13] and thou preparest a table before me in
[57:16] the presence of my enemies and thou
[57:18] anointest my cut my head with all and my
[57:20] cup runneth over

[57:59] all the house of Israel assuredly know
[58:02] that God hath made that same Jesus whom
[58:05] you have crucified both Lord and Christ

[58:09] pricked in their heart and said unto
[58:11] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[58:13] men and Brethren what shall we do then
[58:16] Peter said unto him
[58:18] repent and be baptized every one of you
[58:20] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[58:22] remission of sins and you shall receive
[58:25] the gift of the Holy Ghost you want your
[58:27] sins

[58:32] Judgment Hall and my sins have not been
[58:35] remitted I don't want to stand there and
[58:37] say well I've been a good man that don't
[58:39] count nothing I've been a rich man I've
[58:41] been the mayor I've been this or that

[1:00:23] peace
[1:00:26] and he found
[1:00:32] it our revelation of
[1:00:35] God is lived in our
[1:00:38] lives it's been said maybe even by you
[1:00:41] that he's the greatest Christian you
[1:00:43] ever
[1:00:44] known could we say Amen right there
[1:00:50] amen if you look in Webster's Dictionary
[1:00:53] his picture is there beside a friend of
[1:00:58] God he knew how to love he knew how to
[1:01:07] care this church started in his
[1:01:11] basement
[1:01:12] even with Lindon not being so much in
[1:01:18] agreements you see he had met Jesus
[1:01:20] before he had
[1:01:22] religion but he met Jesus
[1:01:26] amen and when he met
[1:01:29] Jesus it knew it could cost him a lot of
[1:01:34] things cost him a lot of
[1:01:37] friends cost him a lot of prestige with
[1:01:39] these
[1:01:43] neighbors but he said I'll take the way
[1:01:45] with God's despised
[1:01:48] few and Bill offered his
[1:01:51] home I don't know if it's room in his
[1:01:53] basement now now to have church
[1:01:56] but Bill was a
[1:02:02] collector might have heard something
[1:02:04] about some of those services and Linda
[1:02:08] happened to wander down the steps and
[1:02:11] and she had
[1:02:13] religion but she had never had this kind
[1:02:15] of
[1:02:18] Jesus and there she is slain in the
[1:02:22] spirit when she meets
[1:02:26] Jesus and now she's on the same
[1:02:29] Journey what she has fought so hard now
[1:02:33] she's on the
[1:02:35] journey now she doesn't realize what
[1:02:37] lays
[1:02:38] ahead her children are now being raised
[1:02:41] in a in a message
[1:02:43] home and now he's going to be a servant
[1:02:47] to many he's going to take a van and
[1:02:49] he's going to pick up neighbors and
[1:02:52] friends and loved ones and
[1:02:55] he'll get home an hour after you get
[1:02:57] home or maybe two hours after you get
[1:02:59] home
[1:03:00] and he was willing to do whatever it was
[1:03:04] and that was after 4 Hour services or 5
[1:03:07] Hour services and and let me just say
[1:03:10] Church to him was church it was life and
[1:03:13] you've heard us say how he would amen
[1:03:15] and how he would worship and how that he
[1:03:17] would teach the youth and and give us
[1:03:20] teaching messages and and we just loved
[1:03:23] every bit of it he had a way of putting
[1:03:25] things together brother Homer would use
[1:03:29] him
[1:03:30] to to tell us how we ought to act in
[1:03:33] church and and he'd say brother Homer
[1:03:36] why is it my job well now it's alden's
[1:03:38] job and
[1:03:43] so he met every new person here and he
[1:03:46] would write their name down on a card
[1:03:48] and where you're from and he would take
[1:03:50] pictures all over the building and you
[1:03:53] know and when it come to shouting and
[1:03:55] dancing he was all for it and he was
[1:03:57] ready to go he would dance and jump up
[1:04:00] and down and never would known that but
[1:04:03] he jumped up on brother Homer's toe and
[1:04:05] broke his toe while he was shouting
[1:04:08] and brother Homer pull his shoe off and
[1:04:11] he said look what Bill done to
[1:04:13] me and he'd say I don't want to make him
[1:04:15] feel bad brother Roger and myself I told
[1:04:18] this last night but it's worthy to be
[1:04:20] told again we were in Ohio was thousands
[1:04:22] of people there and we were in how we're
[1:04:24] coming to the end of the meeting I'd
[1:04:26] spoke a message on Champions and the
[1:04:28] champion and our great Champion Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ and we broke into worship we had
[1:04:34] a prayer line and and worship went for
[1:04:36] about two hours and brother Roger and
[1:04:39] that's standing there brother Roger just
[1:04:40] raise your hand right there brother
[1:04:42] Roger and Bill had took me they said we
[1:04:46] want to be a part of the meeting so they
[1:04:48] took me up we stayed in the same
[1:04:51] Hotel I'm not going to tell all this
[1:04:53] story but they they shouted two straight
[1:04:56] hours they
[1:05:01] danced said brother Ron but I'm too old
[1:05:03] to do that let me just say this to you
[1:05:05] them two guys took care of every excuse
[1:05:08] anybody will ever have that guy with a
[1:05:11] heart attack that just happened just a
[1:05:12] little bit before that and there brother
[1:05:15] Bill was and he was dancing and it was
[1:05:18] just incredible well I'll just go ahead
[1:05:20] and tell you we got in the car I was
[1:05:22] wore out I was just literally I was
[1:05:24] toast and I laid down on the seat
[1:05:26] brother Roger instructed me to lay down
[1:05:28] and get myself we were 5 minutes away
[1:05:31] from the hotel hour later I wake up and
[1:05:33] they're saying well the sun's that way

[1:06:14] bite of it and it was stale I don't like
[1:06:17] nothing stale so I didn't eat no more of

[1:06:21] Bill I said brother Bill did you eat
[1:06:23] yours every one of
[1:06:28] them brother Bill was the kind of guy
[1:06:31] that would show up at your house and he

[1:06:34] come unannounced who's outside Bill's

[1:07:38] rewards he was a
[1:07:41] fisherman brother Vernon was his partner

[1:07:48] stories and they would fall out of the
[1:07:51] boat together they were friends they did
[1:07:53] everything thing together but in the
[1:07:56] falling out the boat he lost his
[1:07:58] classes 45 minutes later with his bare

[1:08:06] glasses bill was a prayer
[1:08:09] Warrior I was a young man that came to
[1:08:11] this church married sister Connie that's
[1:08:14] in back of the building and I married
[1:08:17] her and I was a young man that needed
[1:08:19] Christ I needed I needed the Holy Ghost
[1:08:21] I've been raised in church but that
[1:08:22] don't make you a Christian
[1:08:25] and so sitting on a Pew don't make you a
[1:08:28] Christian my mom and daddy were incred
[1:08:30] incredible Christians and I would had
[1:08:32] married sister Connie and brother
[1:08:34] Homer's a legendary Christian with
[1:08:36] sister
[1:08:38] Nancy I needed the Holy
[1:08:43] Ghost this is where my journey would
[1:08:45] start with
[1:08:48] Bill uh sister Donna was playing the
[1:08:52] piano and I I slipped down in the corner
[1:08:56] of the piano in the
[1:08:57] wall I don't know where I didn't want
[1:09:00] nobody to see me there but I I just I
[1:09:03] know what I needed I never forget what I
[1:09:05] prayed and this might be something good
[1:09:07] for
[1:09:08] you I prayed Lord my mom and dad are
[1:09:12] incredible Christians and brother Homer
[1:09:13] and sister Nancy are incredible
[1:09:15] Christians Connie is an incredible
[1:09:18] Christian but I'm
[1:09:22] not I don't need my mom's experience or
[1:09:25] my dad's experience even brother Homer's
[1:09:28] experience I need mine that's right I
[1:09:32] don't know when it'll come but I need
[1:09:35] Mine by that time brother Bill had
[1:09:39] wrapped me like an
[1:09:41] anaconda and he had his hands around my
[1:09:44] rib cage and every time I breathe
[1:09:47] he CED
[1:09:50] in and as he prayed for me I we prayed
[1:09:54] for quite a while
[1:09:58] there and as he prayed I heard him begin
[1:10:01] to speak in a Heavenly
[1:10:04] language and I felt the presence of God
[1:10:07] drop
[1:10:08] down on him and I said
[1:10:12] God don't just drop on him drop on
[1:10:18] me that presence dropped on
[1:10:22] me I want want to say this to you I've
[1:10:25] never ever been the same am I went into
[1:10:31] service one man and I walked out a
[1:10:34] different
[1:10:38] man the man Bill Hinkle has always been
[1:10:41] a hero to
[1:10:44] me I've watched his
[1:10:47] life I watched him in the sorrow of
[1:10:49] Natalie going
[1:10:52] home
[1:10:54] I saw the agony of a
[1:10:57] father but
[1:11:00] today today he stands with
[1:11:03] her I swatched him in the early days of
[1:11:07] his mother and father leaving both of
[1:11:10] them being
[1:11:14] baptized I watched him as friends would
[1:11:17] go friends of this church would
[1:11:20] go I got to be really tight with him
[1:11:24] whatever you were doing he was
[1:11:25] interested to be a part of I made him a
[1:11:28] chimney
[1:11:29] sweep I took him I took him to
[1:11:31] incredible
[1:11:33] meetings we did an incredible amount of
[1:11:36] things that I don't have time to say
[1:11:37] about it
[1:11:39] together but Bill Hinkle was a
[1:11:45] friend Seth if you ever had a hero or a
[1:11:49] mentor to look
[1:11:51] to that guy is the
[1:11:55] guy and I'm not talking about having a
[1:11:57] garden where there was 50 million tons
[1:12:00] of manure in
[1:12:02] it I'm I'm not talking about that part
[1:12:05] of his life I'm talking about being a
[1:12:06] real
[1:12:07] Christian raising family in the fear and
[1:12:11] the admonition of
[1:12:13] God that
[1:12:17] guy should he is more important than
[1:12:20] LeBron
[1:12:21] James amen
[1:12:24] he is more important than anybody in
[1:12:27] this world that is an incredible hero
[1:12:30] and an incredible
[1:12:32] Mentor that's only his
[1:12:35] house that he used to live
[1:12:41] in we were privileged to have him as a
[1:12:45] friend I was
[1:12:48] privileged to go rabbit hunting with him
[1:12:52] maybe maybe some of his friends would
[1:12:55] leave him lead him over on trespassing
[1:13:01] land not going to name them here
[1:13:06] but but there's some funny stories you
[1:13:08] could tell
[1:13:10] there but he was a friend to us
[1:13:13] all he was just not my friend or your
[1:13:16] friend he became friends to the children
[1:13:18] in this
[1:13:19] church from the youngest to the oldest
[1:13:24] he made an incredible
[1:13:26] connection and I say this to
[1:13:29] you he was a
[1:13:33] pillar he was a pillar that we all could
[1:13:35] say we were proud to be a part of it I
[1:13:38] was thinking about his
[1:13:41] rewards thank God it's
[1:13:44] eternity cuz it's going to take a while
[1:13:47] to hand out all of his
[1:13:49] rewards I think about maybe I'll get a
[1:13:52] tent and he'll get a
[1:13:56] Castle but if I could say it
[1:14:00] well he live W life well
[1:14:09] done he's dancing
[1:14:13] now he's shouting
[1:14:17] now if he could look down over the
[1:14:19] banister of heaven and preach a
[1:14:22] sermon
[1:14:23] his life
[1:14:27] did brother Ron I'm not so cons I'm not
[1:14:30] so I'm not so
[1:14:34] uh
[1:14:37] Vindicated that life is you know there's
[1:14:40] Life After
[1:14:42] Life well just wait till the second you
[1:14:47] die just wait till the second you die
[1:14:50] and you'll figure it out real quick of
[1:14:52] some things that you should have
[1:14:56] done life after death is incredibly
[1:15:01] important and this is the only spot that
[1:15:04] you can get it
[1:15:07] fixed a lot of people don't want to come
[1:15:09] to funerals is because they might get
[1:15:11] convicted you don't get convicted at a
[1:15:13] ball
[1:15:14] game you definitely don't get convicted
[1:15:17] at a political
[1:15:19] speech but it's a place where that you
[1:15:21] have to really deal with with life and
[1:15:23] death amen and as I finish
[1:15:27] today where will you spend
[1:15:31] eternity the vast the mass majority of
[1:15:34] this
[1:15:37] audience has worship with Bill amen
[1:15:41] hallelujah but if this is your first
