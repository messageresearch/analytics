thanks but as a Believer a Believer is constantly giving thanks to almighty God for all the things that God has done the Small Things the big things and the things that you don't even know that he's done I think those things right there are to be praised right there whether you know it or not it's those things the Small Things the hidden details that make God so great to each and every one of us to see where he's kept us and how he's brought us safely thus far amen so we just want to wish each and every one of you a a very Happy Thanksgiving and may God richly bless you and we pray that you

you didn't listen to it I I admonish you to go back and listen to it and um brother brother William admonishing you to read and dive into the church age book if you don't know the message get the church age book and you will come out knowing the message because that's the very first thing that my papa Charlie and my my father they they T when I when I gave my heart to the Lord and the Lord did something special for me they both set me down and said you dig your teeth in you cut your teeth on on this church age book if you don't understand the godhead you just read the first 20 Pages brother Brandon will dive into the godhead and there's a lot of people that that don't don't even capture that in the first but if you're elect of God you'll see it right there it's the most it's one of the Capstone it is the Capstone revelation of who God is is to see that and if you can see godhead you can see why baptism you can see serpent seed you can see you can see the Eternal salvation you can see all those things laying there and I tell you it's it's it's just a beautiful thing to be a part of this message and and um I just I was just really really pleased last night so thank you brother William I know I know that that didn't just come to you overnight and I know that the Lord uh really used you and I I just appreciate your ministry and um I know Full Gospel Lighthouse does so amen amen if you have your Bibles today we'd like to uh just just look over in the Book of Luke 4 and verse 17 also Revelations chap 10 I want to welcome all of our visitors here uh today we happy to have you in the house of the Lord man as a minister you you're constantly looking unto the Lord to just see the very mind of God and i' I've been studying an actual thought for about two two and a half months or something right at two months and I thought the Lord was going to give us Liberty to speak at this weekend and and uh just just on Friday evening he just uh turned my heart I was actually driving uh my daughter to uh basketball practice and Lord just just dropped this thought in my heart on anoint it by taking the book and I'd like to by the help of the Lord just just speak to you um on these thoughts there's so many ways that we could dive into this but just Gathering some inspiration we'd like to speak to you today on these scriptures here in Luke 4 and: 17 and the Bible said that and there was delivered unto him the book of The Prophet Isaias and when he had opened in the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them are them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and then the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears Revelations chap 10 and verse one amen Revelations 10 and 1 and I saw another mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his feet on his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire brother William just did a wonderful wonderful job tying those things in the scriptures together last night and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer here this morning Heavenly Father we come before you father Lord we we feel so charged by the Holy Spirit to be setting here together Lord there's many places that that Believers are meeting there are some that are meeting in storefronts this morning there are many that are out underneath of a canopy of maybe maybe Palm leaves that that are gathering together there there are those that are underneath of sheet Meadow and they're Gathering and sitting on a post but Lord here we are at Full Gospel Lighthouse sitting in this wonderful Tabernacle that you've blessed us with Father sitting here with our friends and our family Lord Jesus but more importantly Lord we're not just sitting here with you we recognize that you are here and that you have come to speak to us oh God and we invite you Lord Jesus to to take this take this Pulpit just now and to take our hearts Lord and you would Minister unto us by by the reading of the word I pray that you would break the scriptures one more time father and that we would be careful to be able to see you Lord Jesus you you drew near to those that were walking to the road to EMAs and you you made yourself and disguised yourself in such a way that they wouldn't know you and I pray father that today Lord that while the breaking of the word is going forth may we not be may we not recognize may we not fail to recognize your presence Lord may we may we see it's just more than Humanity of the elements of the body that that is bringing and breaking forth but may we see Jesus high and lifted up father I know that there are many needs here Lord God and I have dedicated myself for this service today but Lord I pray Lord as I'm dedicating myself to preach this this meeting today I pray that these Believers would dedicate themselves to hear the preaching of the word that that you would charge them as they are moving forward into this coming week of Thanksgiving that you would give them a word for the situation of life that they would recognize that you have heard their cries that you have seen them in the midst of all the chaos of this life and may they just return and give thanks to you for you have given us a book not closed but open unto us so father we turn and give thanks to the CH to to the true and living God and the Church of the Living God says amen and amen may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord as we say we like to take a thought on anointed anointed by taking the book and and and the Bible says here in John 1 and verse 11 that he he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name now that word if you begin to study out and and your studiers of the scriptures and looking into the the Greek Lexicon you'll find that that this word here in he he came unto his own and his own received him not that word received in the Greek it is it is uh it is pronounced as lambano and that word receive it means to take it means to it means to take with a hand or to lay hold on it is to take up a thing to be carried it's to have have it's to catch and he goes on and he says he said but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God that as many as caught the Revelation as many that that took the Revelation as many that that laid a hold on it and carried it as to run with it to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were not born of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God so the reason why that you are able to lay a hold and and the reason why you have come to this message is because simply that the spirit of God has saw you and ordained your being here he has elected you it wasn't your mother it wasn't your father it wasn't your family genealogy that brought you here you may have your granddaddy may have been in a message and your mother may have been in a message but that's not the reason that you are here God uses families to witness to one another but the reason why you are here is because the very Mind Of God saw you he saw you grabbing a hold of the revelation of the hour and I think it's I think it's powerful to recognize that that God not only he not only calls our parents but he calls you and I as well even even though even though we might have we might have seen them grow up we may have seen their experience we may have seen them go through the the the uh the uh Elements of Life but it is amazing to look that it isn't your mother and your father's Revelation that you're here but it's simply because of the Gen seat of God that that he deposited on the inside of you that that's the reason that you're here that's the reason now now brother brandom what I'm just going to labor some things here on these thoughts this morning and and I I pray that you'll you'll just bear with me this morning now brother manam would say in the anointed ones at the end time he said now anointed one is one with a message anointed one is one with a message and the only way that a message can be brought out is by the one that's anointed and that would be a prophet or an anointed the anointed one and Jesus would say in Matthew 10:40 that he that receiveth you receiveth me and re he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he goes on to say that he that receive a prophet in the name of a prophet or he that he that takes or he that carries or or he that grabs a hold of it to carry it away he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet et's reward and he that is a right receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and brother brandom has asked a question in 1964 in question and answers that said brother brandom if you have time please explain Matthew 10 and 41 he said I would like to know what is a prophet's reward he said I he said he said it's like this he said if they want to know what a prophet's reward is it's to be a friend to the prophet he said that's reward he's your friend like the shunamite woman it might come in handy sometime it did with her he said you watch God servant you see sometimes you don't even realize that you you have become a friend to a prophet and sometimes you don't even realize who you who youve bumped shoulders with but they are the anointed of God and you say well what is that what does that mean brother Andrew it's kind of like maybe I'll just put it in in perspective to you it's kind of like a guide or or a supporter of somebody that is a that is a mountain climber and the guy is standing down at the bottom and he he's standing there and he's watching the mountain climber and he's he's telling he said he's telling them from the bottom said now look if you can if you can just go to your left and you can hang on right there that guy down there at the bottom he's sitting there and he's supporting him he's giving him motivation now you hold on right there because you're getting ready to to come to some steep spots you're getting ready to get into some areas you see that's kind of like you and I it's kind of like you and I have become a friend to a prophet you see we are not able to go up to the heights of the mountain climber but we've been able to stand right there and look and see and enjoy the benefits of what the mountain climber has been able to go up there and see and tell us that he's seen these things he he saw heaven opened up he he saw the revelation of the hour it's a very powerful thing to recognize that the reason why you're benefiting to overcoming in Leia it's because there's somebody that climbed a mountain there was somebody that climbed a mountain mountain and is looking down to you and says this is what it looks like over there Joshua this is what it looks like over there Caleb this is what it looks like it's a good land it's a goodly land it's got a it's got good Heritage in it Hallelujah now we begin to study out the context of anointing throughout the Bible and there's there's so many scriptures that that lay there and I just would like to hit some highlights of of the context of anointing throughout the Bible that we realize when you when you study out the definition of of anointing throughout the Bible you'll see when whenever it is somebody is is is is when God says they are anointed or they are God's anointed or or or they are anointed of the Lord that anointing means to authorize or to set a person for a particular work or a service it signifies that that person belongs to God in a special sense it being he he has chosen he is commissioned for a Divine Purpose just like Jesus could stand there in Isaiah he could read Isaiah 61 and he realized that this was not for another Prophet but this was for him he he saw himself that that he come under the anointing of the Messiah when you study out the anointing in the Old Testament you see the context of it you'll see the roles of the anointed was ones that was priests or Kings and prophets were were anointed and when they when they would come to their position you would find that a prophet would come in there and they would anoint them with oil to signify that they had a dedication and an authority by almighty God to stand in the position that they were in and you see when they come to that spot when many times you you'll see Samuel as he's pouring the oil out upon it is a symbolic act by a prophet that is that is under God's authority to pour out the anointing oil on Saul or o pour it out on David or or to pour it out on Solomon there's two prophets that were anointed in the same way throughout in Old Testament but you're watching it it is a symbology of the holy spirit being poured out upon your life just when you watch the anointing fall or David being anointed to be king it's like you sitting there you didn't look like the right kind of man you didn't look like the right kind of King you was short you was Ruddy you was insignificant but almighty God saw you he ordained you to this position and there are in the Old Testament Messiah prophecies that are laying there that are described as the anointed one and and the Book of Psalms and the Old Testament prophecies would lay in there that would cause the cause the future generations to be looking for a coming king or one that would be anointed or or the Messiah and when you dive into the New Testament and you look at the context of of the word anointed you'll find that Christ the anointed the word Messiah the word messiah in the Hebrew and Christ in the Greek both mean anointed one they both mean the anointed one but when you dive into us as his disciples that all the Disciples of God are are are are what we would say as the anointed ones that we are God's own commission for his service I'm going to give you some scripture here just now for the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 1 and 21 now he which establish us with you in Christ hath anointed us is God the reason why you're here and the reason why you're understanding is because there is an anointing that has been poured out by almighty God when you look at it that you can find that when when they would come that when you look at the context of anointing in the old in the New Testament you'll find that healing anointing was there that the that Jesus would he would send out his disciples he would send them out two by two and he would stand there and he would tell them said now if any man does not receive you dust your feet off of that situation he said but when you come into a city he said You cast out devils and you anoint the sick with oil and you pray the prayer of faith over them you anoint the sick for healing that's why we can stand here and recognize that everything that is given to the Church of the Living God you're anointed for it you realize that you could come here this morning with a sickness in your body and I as a man of God as a minister of God that I'm anointed to pray the prayer of faith over top of you anoint you with oil and you can walk out of here healed do you realize that I'm anointed in the same way to stand here and to preach salvation unto you I'm anointed as a man of God to stand here and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and sons of God in a moment can be saved by the preaching of the word Hallelujah the Holy Spirit anoints Believers and he brings them to an understanding and a guidance and empowerment because the Bible said in 1 John 2 and 20 but you have an unction you have a an anointing from the Holy One and you know all things verse 27 but the anointing which you have lambano received of him abideth in you come on amen thank you Lord David would feel the anointing of God that would come upon him and the spirit of God would partly anoint him and it would partly anoint Moses and it would partly anoint Solomon and it would partly anoint it would partly anoint Daniel and all the old prophets they would come under the anointing but the anointing would leave them and the anointing would come and the anointing would go but Jesus said that the anointing that I've placed on your life it is abiding in you so that's why Jesus would say don't you ever fear to go anywhere he said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you and the prophet Heard a Voice said I the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever that you go so there is a dual anointing there's a physical anointing of laying hands an anointing with oil but there's an spiritual anointing it's the work of the spirit of God in a believer's heart and mind and filling them not with not with knowledge not with psychology but Power because that's what William Brandon would say that that is what the anointing is the anointing is not shouting the anointing is not emotions but the anointing is supreme power under control that's why William Brandon when you would hear him say over and over again that the anointing of the Lord is here I'm waiting on it the anointing of he said the anointing has just left me he said but here it comes here it comes he was anointing him for a Ministry of discernment and taking him through people's lives well you say brother Andrew what are you saying what is the anointing I can say it only by the scripture that it is Christ the word because the Bible said in Isaiah 59 and 21 as for me this is my Covenant with them sayith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in my mouth in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed Hallelujah nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever more so I'm saying this to you that the anointing that is coming upon you it's the word of the hour it's the word of the hour you say well is it just for me absolutely not it's for your seed and for your seed seed it ain't just for brother Charles it ain't just for sister Katie it's for Quinn it's for AA it's for every single one of us every single one you say well how in the world are we going to get in this position I don't understand how your prodal are going to have to come under this anointing but I simply take it by the word of the Lord that we would be there and our Offspring also I don't know how to do it I don't know how to get them there I don't know how to preach come there but ex simply expressing the very thoughts of God and if I can express it if I can push it if I can preach it and you can pull it I don't know how they're going to be there I don't understand where they're going to be standing at when the Revelation strikes them but they are anointed to come to this message Hallelujah they're anointed to come to this message Hallelujah a Baptist message is not anointing them to come here a Methodist message is not anointing them to come here but there is an anointing of the message of the hour that is bringing you to their position how do I get there brother Andrew you're anointed by taking the right that's right I know it's going to get awkward when you sit down at your Thanksgiving dinner this week and there are people that are sitting over across from you that do not believe this message but you stand there as a Son of God they may not believe like you and you ain't got to preach to them you just simply live a life it'll be that life that power that anointing that literally draws him come on sir you can lock them up in a prison and they'll still get out you can put them in drugs and they'll still get out there is an anointing Hallelujah my brother Brandon would say in the message of paradox he said now what is it he said Christ is coming to the body Christ is the word he said we all know the anointing is Christ he said that comes on the word that makes the word live is that right amen he said that is the anointing y'all okay he said we all know that the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes it live I I I I felt that kind of just go over but let me I want to reiterate that and actually yeah I'll just say it he wants to say it again we all know that the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live he said that is the anointing that is the anointing now brother Rand I'm just going to just hear by the inspiration just for a minute I'm coming back to this but brother Brandon was talking to a lady he said I see you out there in a wheelchair he said now he said why would you be in a wheelchair he said except for God wanted to test your faith he said now if if the ministries of the day cannot produce he said if they cannot produce they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that these signs shall follow them that belief he said then you have a right to disbelieve the message he said if signs aren't following that but the reason why the anointing Hallelujah is here it's because Christ makes the word alive that's why I take such uh gumption to come out and I take such courage to walk out and pray the prayer of faith over you no matter how bad the situation is no matter how ugly the place is no matter the condition that you're in or the back pain that you're in I can take gumption as a country boy as a preacher of this message I can stand there and pray it over you because I know there's still power I know there's still anointing I know there's still enough power in the name of Jesus [Music] Christ you ain't got no right to disbelief this message you got no right to disbelieve this message there's power here there's healings here there's signs here there's wonders here so I say this to you be healed in the name of Jesus Christ let me go just a little bit further I'm not talking about your physical body but I'm talking about your emotions be healed I'm talking about your complexes be healed I'm talking about your fears be healed I want you to know I feel healing in the room this morning there's an anointing here for your healing you've been hurt there's an anointing here for that you've been Afflicted there's an anointing here for that that is the anointing Christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the word that quick is the word to make it live he said the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ become one he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible all of it is yours I'm going somewhere today y'all just y'all keep hanging on with me I know I know you're listening t he said but all of it is yours he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible you see you see then if the anointing strikes he said it don't anoint it so if you're standing there and you're believing for your prodical and you're standing under that anointing and the anointing strikes that you can believe it because all of them things are for you if you got if you got certain situations and the anointing of God at the pulpit strikes the heart of the believer back there that's holding on to something that the preacher himself can't see it anoints you to believe it and accept it and it'll make it happen you see it's kind of like these wires it's kind of like these wires that run from Harrisonburg to Elon that are bringing power back and forth through their energy plants you see you see it it can be a perfectly fine wire it can be sitting there he said but you see but it's it's a notot it's not got no power in it he said as as long as it's looking if it looks like the right kind of wire come on you you see you can look at it you can see all the descriptions that that's got that's got the ability it's got the capacity it's got it's got It's it has the ability to power houses it has the ability to light up a light up a air conditioner and a heating pump to bring to bring warmth in the winter and cool in the summer but unless it's hooked up to a conductor it just looks the part and there's a whole lot of Christians that just look the part there's a whole lot of people in the message that try to dress the part but they're not hooked up to a power source it can look the part it can dress the part it can talk the part but unless it is hooked up to a conductor to the power [Applause] source Hallelujah I believe brother brandom said it in wisdom versus Faith he said when Jesus he said when Satan came against Jesus up there on the mountain he said he come up against he said he didn't realize it he said but he singed his feathers when they come up against him he said he hit a 100 billion vote wire when he hit him he said now Satan had a vult too he said but it didn't have no power in it he said but Jesus's wire had some power in it I say Satan's in for trouble if he comes against the Church of the Living God they might be a cage of every unclean and hateful bird but when they come against the power the conductor the Holy Ghost is there he's there to make it live he's there to make it work what are you saying BR I'm saying that you are destined you are prepared to lambano the power 120 volt wire can hurt you it's good for your arthritis every once in a while brother alen should never have it God bless him I put him in some pickles sometimes we was up there working in the Attic one time he looked at me said if I don't do this just right I'll see you on the other side I said well take your time take your time what do I do if you do get hit by kick me as hard as you can and Satan's tried to kick you off this power I felt that he's tried to kick you off his power he's tried to keep you from this message he's tried to keep you from the realities of this message by offering you worldly things let me tell you something you have got to be sold out to this message you have got to be so it cannot be about your money it cannot be about your job it cannot be about your influence in this world world it's got to be about the anointing of the hour you see so many people that are chasing a dollar and chasing this and trying to get rich and trying to get Fame but it'll get them nowhere Mercy I didn't think I'd hurt y'all that bad but I'll say this again it's about the message I know you got to provide I know you got to take care of your family but let Church be church again it's time you get hooked back up to the Dynamo get hooked back into the power I know that every devil in Hell's try to kick you away from the message tried to tell you that that we were that we were nothing but a cult that we were nothing but a bunch of people that were following a man but it's time to get hooked back up to some anointing power if you left the message it's time to come back h Hallelujah get back into it get back to reading your Bible get back to praying get [Applause] back Jesus said when he was in his prayer of intercessory he comes to his prayer of intercessory and he's standing there John chapter 17 is such a powerful powerful chapter but Jesus is standing there and he said father make them one like we are one not the kind of world that the world not the kind of Oneness that the world's trying to produce but let me read it to you from a prophet he said who do you say this is in 1964 he said be one as I and the father one he said be that kind of one he said then how will that be he said the word in us would be the anointed word that is the Oneness of God he said the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you and then you become a messiah of the age that's what a messiah means it is the anointed one and that's why Jesus would say or brother Randon would say in the message Messiah he said he was Messiah he said but you are Messiahs your little lights the same power that was in Jesus is the same power that is in you now G or the Bible said in John 3 and 27 that man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven now we know that the Bible teaches us that all scripture is given by the very breath of almighty God by the very inspiration and we realize that the word that we have read in the old test that the prophecy that came in old time was not by the will of man but it was simply by the will of God and they were moved and they spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost you see there is only one thing that will ever catch the elect of God's mind and that is they are watching for the Fulfillment of Prophecy of what a prophet said you see it's the identification of a prophets of his presence is when he stays with the word that's his credentials is when a prophet stays right there with the word and when when when the angel came to Gabriel or the angel Gabriel came to Mary and he standing there and he's talking to her he's telling her all the scriptures he's telling her how these things are going to be the the reason why Mary had faith enough to believe that angel was because a prophet had said that and the reason why you can stand here and you can receive these things is because you know that it's laying right there in the scripture the message ain't bringing you something new the message is simply clarifying and bringing a light to it so that you can see you see all the things were perfect in the Ephesian Church age until they left the first love but you see way throughout men came in there and they broke off this and they broke off that but that's why the ministry of the seventh angel was so important was to Simply Place everything back and he could not have done it on his own accord he had to get under the anointing of the eagle anointing and stand there under the anointing of Malachi 4 he could stand there he had to have the same holy ghost that Mary had he had to receive the same experience that Paul had but they come there the angel starts talking to her so these things are going to be this way you see the reason why the word could sink into our heart was because there had been some ground that was already prepared for it you see God is never going to say something unless there's somebody out there that's already set up to receive it you see you see he was able to speak those things because he knew Mary was coming he would have never said that through Isaiah's mouth if he didn't see Mary already coming he would have never said that there's going to be a spotless bride unless he already saw you coming I say it like this Christ does not have to have a rebuttal he doesn't have to go back and take anything out of his documents and go back in there and restudy the case he doesn't have to look back in say did I really do that or did I really say that about them he's not having to have a rebuttal this morning he's looking in there and you may not look like the part but you are everything you may not feel it right now but it's all over you reason why she could receive it was because she didn't run around she wasn't manhandled she had put herself in position of urgency so that she could receive the spoken word that's why this message is able to come to you you ain't been manhandled you ain't been handled by denominations you ain't been hand you ain't been handled by men theologies you see well I was in that condition I was in that democracy I was I was in that denomination I was under that power but that's why there's an invisible Union that has taken place you're Justified as if you never was a Catholic you never was an homas you never was a menit you never did it in the first place he put you in position to receive the [Applause] word hallu hallelujah he knew where you'd be at he knew the ground that you'd be planted in he knew the time and the season that you'd be coming but your heart was just life for the seed to fall into and when the seed struck Mary's heart she didn't wait till she was positive she didn't wait for a cycle to stop she started testifying that there was a new cycle that was in position Hallelujah let me say this to you you are in you are in Rapture cycle there's never been anybody in your position before but the reason why you're in this position is because the message of Malachi 4 got you in this position you was no good you was unworthy but the message change your [Applause] story what are you saying brother hendre I'm saying it's time you step in your position it's time we have some more marries before you get healed start testifying about it before you see your prodical get back in here I may not have the ministry I may not have the ministry of brother Donnie I may not have the ministry of brother Tim I may not have the ministry of brother Ron but I will have a Ministry that my Ministry is is liable for going after your prodal and I will go to my grave believing that God is able I'm anointed to believe it I firmly believe that with all that's within Me Jesus wasn't walking around asking himself am I the Messiah am I am I really the one am I am I am I the guy he didn't go around questioning he simply stepped into the position of it he simply knew that he was there to do it he knew who he was he knew it so much that he was talking to a woman like you that was out of shape and she said I know that when the Messiah comes he said he that speaketh unto you he wasn't questioning he said I'm he I'm the guy I'm the guy that's returning your worship back to its rightful position and he that receiveth you receiveth him that sent me now the Bible said in Revelations 10: 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as he had declared it to the servants as prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take it go and receive it to them that received him gave you power to become the sons of God what are you saying I'm saying that the God that was back there in Jesus's day is a god that is standing right here saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it take it take it what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying it ain't William brandom's job no more I'm saying it's your job I'm saying take it I'm saying receive it I'm saying run with everything that you got within you I run as though I had not attained but I'm going to apprehend I'm going to believe this I'm going to run with this message let me get some letters from home and let me tell you that God is faithful God is able God is good God still saves God still got Mercy go and take the book you're not fumbling around trying to figure out your position as the body of Jesus Christ you took it and if you took it hallu if you took it it was a sign of your election it was a sign that you were ordained from almighty God that's why Satan is roaring like a he's going about like a roaring line it's because he recognized that the scripture of Christ The Mystery of God has been revealed that's what he's howling about is that this message is becoming identified in a bride's body she's anointed by taking this book my my I've told you this before that there's some new ones that are amongst us my great grandmother Clara Spencer she she was she was a real Christian lady I never had the opportunity to meet her but but as as a patriarch of our of our family the meetings that you the meetings that you go down and enjoy brother Shawn Martin's there in Christiansburg that was on my that was on my great grandfather's property right there is where my my grandfather Charlie Spencer would plant ters and and tomatoes and different things and and the Lord preserve that preserve that land so that it would stay that it would stay in the family because my grandfather was a my great-grandfather was a he was a wicked man and he was trying to sell family he was trying to sell the land and everything else and CLA Spencer recognized that that if this if this land got sold that she wouldn't be able to provide for her family because it provided nourishment for their family and so all these men came in there and they they had it up for auction and all these people come in there for the auction and it was going up for sale but when it time come time to for the auction there was not one person that bought a razor hand because there was a woman that prayed there was a woman that prayed that she needed she needed some land to be able to preserve her family do you realize that God has got a preservation for the elect of God that when when when when when the CH when the cries of the children of Israel had got down there and God be to hear their cries that God would he would have a conference with Moses back there on the backside of the desert you see and your cries have the ability to preserve the elect that even in the midst of your crisis that you can have a showdown with almighty God and believe and pray and God will have a conference with you and she when she she she was a lady and there's Visions in our family and and my my great-grandmother had a vision of William brandham I know that many of you already know this but she had a vision of William brandham of who Elijah was in Malachi for she didn't know it was William brandham but she she had she had a vision of who Malachi 4 was that that this was going to be Elijah and she she had uh my P Charlie when he he came to the message in 1962 it was handed to him a message on a way of a true prophet and and and brother brandham would tell in the meeting right before that he said I'm going to preach I'm going to preach a sermon tomorrow or or the next day on the trail of a prophet I think it's pretty beautiful to think that that my family was on a trail of a prophet before we ever before we ever really realized it but God had us on that trail and and and she with my papa Charlie he received the message he wanted to share it just like anybody else wanted to share with his family well back in them day they they used to have the in the only Believe Books they had the message books and on the front fly leaf of it they had a picture of William brandom right there in the first and and my P Charlie started going in and he started presenting a message to her and and all of a sudden he he he opens it up and before she can read one word of it she sees William Brandon picture and she said that's Elijah that's Elijah because God had showed her before William Brandon was ever in position he had already showed Claris Spencer and you think about your family history how did you get here where you are how do you understand like you understand there is an anointing that has been placed on your life to come here and receive this message David would say in Psalms 4 5 and 7even thou lovest righteousness and hateth wickedness therefore God thy God have Anointed with thee with oil of gladness above thy fellows you see he would say in the world again Fallen apart the church cannot run without the power of God through the word the Holy Ghost will only confirm the word of God for that's what it's to do the anointing is to confirm the word so the anointing in your life is to confirm the word of the hour so you've not just received an ordinary seal you've received a king's seal nobody can imitate this seal there's nobody can that can plug at it and pull you out of his hand because it's his seal he put it there the king knows where he where he plac the seal the Bible said in Psalms 92 and10 but my horn shall thou exalt like the Horn of a unicorn I shall be Anointed with fresh oil the passion says it like this your anointing has made me strong and mighty you've empowered my life for Triumph by pouring fresh oil over me David would say in Psalms 23 and4 yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prep preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over and I know that we are standing right here in the most wicked and most evil days where the forces of hell are against the Church of the Living God it does not surprise us because hell has fought against the Warlords of Christ over and over and over again but our Jehovah that is a Jehovah jyra he is a provider he has anointed a people and provided a people that will stand for truth I want I want you to know this that the anointing that is upon you to overcome Le osia is more than enough it's more than enough David said my cup runthe have to drink of it sparingly you don't have to wonder at it but you can stand there in this evil day as Paul would say finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and put on the whole armor of God that you might be able to withstand in the evil day you have been anointed to stand against all the forces of hell and David would go through so many trials he was anointed king went back to back to hurting sheep and taking care of sheep comes out on the battlefield he worships before the king he goes out on a battlefield walks down into a valley and he sees all the fall he sees the rise of the economy of the anointed on Saul how that Saul had so completely in his apostasy turned away from the very mind of God and David come to the rise and the fall and he says in Psalms chapter 20 and6 now I know that the Lord saveth his anointed through it all sister C through it all I now know that the Lord saveth his anointed he will hear from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand you see it's kind of like this it's like the sounding of a distress signal on a ship and they're out there caught in the middle of the storm they're out there at Sea and they're tossed about but the captain knows he knows that if he can sound this distress signal if he can get an attention of the coast guards he can send it through the fog they may not be able to see the light but they can hear the sound they can hear the sound and even maybe they don't come just right away but he keeps on sounding and he turns up the volume on his prayer and he keeps turning it up and now he can say now I know now I know that thou has saved thine anointed one I know I know that he will hear from his holy Heaven I know this I know that he's God in the mountain I know he's God in the valley he's that kind of a God because the spirit speaks expressedly of this leoty in church age how that it would be lukewarm and cold and formal she would be naked blind didn't even know that she was so wretched in a miserable stake but God has not made you to be a lukewarm conditioned believer he's not put you here so that you could feel the drafts of of the denominational breezes bro over you but he said in his scriptures that that this is the Zeal of the hour that thou must repent and anoint your eyes with ISAC brother man would say he said now what he said what would remind me of this scripture he said back on him Old Kentucky nights he said when we would be sitting up there and he said the snow would be blowing through the through the rafters of the cabin he said we get that old matter in our eyes he said get that matter in our eyes and he said he said we wake up in the morning said Mama we can't see there something wrong with me I can't see he said she' go in there and she'd take that old hot grease and she warm it up and she' said we'd be coming down the stairs and she'd take that hot grease and she'd rub it and smear it into our eyes you see anointing in Leviticus 8 is when the the anointing is poured over the priest and when it's smeared over the altar he said she would take that hot grease he said and she'd rub it on there and he said before long he said all the matter had come out of our eyes and we could see clearly the reason why the church World sees three Gods is they got too much Family Matters and and they've got too much the church denominational matters that's that's blocking their Vision so they can't focus on who the true God is so that's why you've got to have the Holy Spirit come in and rub the oil over your eyf rub the eyf over your eyes so that you can clearly see it ain't three Gods up up here it ain't two Gods up there it's one God and that same power that same anointing is in you little bride you're not lukewarm brother Mar said them cold drafts have been blowing on the church for quite some time he said they've been blowing on their church he said they've got some theology he said no theology that they've got has came from the book of an unbeliever he said it's come from a book of an unbeliever he said we don't need some psychology how to teach us who God is he said we've got the best book on psychology and it's a Bible he said it come from the mind of God he said that's the only psych Hallelujah that's the only psychology that we need the only book that we need let me tell you something I don't need Dr Dobson's ideas on how to live our how to live a life as a husband and not go down into pornography I don't need Dr doson seven steps on how to live and over coming life I've got the message there is no spot in this message for psychology the only psychology that we need is the [Applause] power Mercy what a beautiful text you okay for some more preaching this morning some of you drove four hours for this some of you drove 10 minutes and you're ready to leave but I done had a good day this morning brother Shannon I done have me a good day this morning I woke up early this morning and me and King Jesus was dancing in the same room and he was dancing with me so I got every right to preach a message this morning if the king of glory would show up in my study and let me have an opportunity to worship P I think I ought to take every opportunity to get under the anointing of the hour to make sure to make sure I don't let coldness get in to make sure it don't get no lukewarmness in bless God the football game's on you see I'm going to I'm going to while while we're here we're going to dive something real quick you see it's who you yield Your Vessel to there are there are two there's two powers in the world today brother Rand will teach us that there's a God's power and Satan's power and it's who you yield yourself to you see you have the ability to yield yourself to the anointing to shut off the lukewarmness you have the ability to turn on the lukewarmness by by who you habitate with and who you allow to come in who you worshiping I'll guarantee you this that there are kids in this room and I'm going to say I'm I'm going to say this but I I don't mean this down raing or or any way because I wouldn't I'm not that kind of man I had people I had people do that to me and I wanted to walk away from this message because people tried to downgrade me because I didn't know everything but I'll never be I'll never be that kind of guy I promise you that I walk I'll walk over hot C before I try to before I ever offend anybody now I won't I won't say I won't take back anything for the preaching of the word but I if I offend you I will I will I will back up so I I when I say this statement I don't mean it to be downgrading or to to to throw cast in it but I'll just let me just say it I guarantee you that there are kids here that know more stats on football games and baseball games and basketball games than know than they know about the scriptures and I guarantee you this that there are people that are here that know more about finances and the things that are happening in the world than they know about the message that's just I mean just that's just a true statement amen and I don't mean that to hurt you at all but I want to I want to expose something right here it's amazing it's amazing to look at it how that you can yield yourself over to the pleasures of life well you say well I know more about the message and then then I do know about those things well that's great well let me give you let me give you an example so I can put everybody on the same level I guarantee you I guarantee you that you have you have no problem being able to stay awake and watch something on your phone or a movie but as soon as you pick up your Bible you Spirit of Slumber comes over you ain't that amazing I mean here you are you're a holy ghost fi person and you as soon as you grab your bible or your church age book and all of a sudden you start diving in there come on ain't that amazing now you know you got the Holy Ghost you know you do and all of a sudden you absolutely if you got the Holy Ghost you love to do it but what is it it is the spirit of the age that you are under that affects every preacher and affects every little bitty child that there is something that is in you that wants to lean on the pleasures of life it's it's the anointing of the age that makes you want to ease yourself into of emotional entertainment that I've got to take care of this and it happens don't me it's amazing what is it it's the spirit of this age that's trying to get you to entertain your flesh it's trying to get you to entertain but there is something powerful about a believer that when they feel that coming on them you know what there's no way I should be more comfortable by watching something on YouTube than reading the word of God and all of a sudden you get a sword in your hand and say wait a minute devil I shouldn't be falling asleep in this sermon I should be woke [Applause] up you see that's the spirit of the age is you think you got enough oil you think you got enough eyesa so you go asleep but when the Midnight Cry comes you ran out of oil but the secret to overcoming Le osia is to get so filled with the oil that your Cup's running over that the anointing is there whether you feel it or whether you don't you stay in the message you stay reading the word you stay prayed up you talk to your children about God you talk to your boss about God let me say this I know there's pleasurable things out there in the world but let me say it like d it said it he said that he said there at the right hand of the Lord are Pleasures forever more there is no pleasure in leosia outside of the pleasure of Jesus Christ that can satisfy the heart of every believing son and daughter of God you heard me say it it's one of my favorite statements give God a chance give God a chance I Absolut be honest I love that statement really oh Katie was talking about what she's going to put on her tombstone maybe I won't tell you what to said no I [Music] will you seen one you seen it all she said and she was talking about deer hunting but let it be said about me Let It Be that's why is it's its own class give God a chance come on kids you give games a chance come on come on now you gave Sports a chance and I ain't against any of it I had myself PlayStation 2 when I was man me and Klein man we we we sure me and we put some Madden together brother I built a guy for a football team and you thought he was Hercules coming out there well you give games a chance come on somebody let me go a little bit further you gave the world a chance come on now you gave drugs a chance you gave layout a see a chance why not give God a chance come on FF Bosworth gave God a chance and he stood there writing the face of his critics and when you give God a chance he'll show up Samson gave God a chance he wasn't a warrior but all of a sudden a Jawbone hit his hand and became a warrior just give me a chance I know how to do it just give me a chance the enemies that you're facing they are Supernatural Devils but you have been anointed to throw down every devil you be like Caleb say give me my Mountain give me what's rightfully in mine Joshua they may have said some awful things about this about this land but it's a good land it's a holy land it's a righteous land and I want it I want it every wind has tried to come in and blow the very light out of your candle trying to blow it out of your life but I want to say this to you that the god that Lit your candle is guarding it he's guarding it he L your candle come on you're a candle he L your candle and you know good and way I ain't going to walk over top and say Judy but if he let you a candle you know you know when you light a candle and you're walking through the wind you got to it starts to get blowed out the flickering of the wind begins to blow it out but you're the guy that Lit it so you know what to do if you're walking into the wind you just guard it come up against you against all the winds they're blowing blowing and he takes you and it's trying to blow you out this way and try to give you all kinds of things and he stands in front of you and he guards you oh no Satan you ain't going to blow this one out ain't going to blow this one out I'm watching over him Ain going ain't going to blow him out why how do I know you're not going to blow him out it's because I know who the I know who lit him up it wasn't his granddaddy it wasn't his father it wasn't his great-grandfather it wasn't his grandfather Hallelujah it was almighty God that L his and the god that is guarding him is a God that was watching over job that put a hedge of protection around him he's that kind of a God he'll watch you he'll take care of you he'll protect you he'll be your Defender he's that he's a god he's a god of the first he's a god of the last he's that kind of a god he's anointed you to stand let Satan Huff let him Bluff let let him say everything against his church but the power the [Applause] anointing you're anointed to take every devil's head off don't you back [Applause] up go ahead and rejoice in the Lord if they don't want to receive this message dust your feet of them if they don't want to receive you they're not receiving him that sent you so dust your feet off dust your feet off dust your feet off he's anointed you to cast Devils down to destroy strongholds this is the anointing this is the atmosphere where eagles are born God is for you he is for you brother mcclard had put me on a book I shared with him I wanted I've been building this sermon for two two months now right at two months I started sharing with him some things and he he pointed me towards a book I always watch moments with the Lord like when he places somebody in your life at the right time amen like you come at a perfect time whether you knew it or not and I always watch when God allows relationships to be built at certain times in certain moments and I always watch when God allows a message to drop to a congregation that it that it's it's for a reason because I I I understand things uh under pastorship I understand things and all of a sudden God will just just drop something and he'll he speak it it's it's it's for this situation brother Matthew had mlar had told me he said now no go listen to this book and I tell you it's been a real blessing to me but I I told Brother William I I had the hardest time last night I wanted speaking tongues the whole entire time last night because there is no impersonation to this message there's no impersonation brother Brandon would go into the he'd go into the seals he'd go into the seals and he would go in there and he'd come on the back side of it and he preach a token he said that was that was the Capstone of his ministry was a token message and both in both Services brother Brandon said there can be no impersonation to it and he's talking he said can be no impersonation like it was in the first and the second pool he said there could be no impersonation to the third pool if you you studied out the message and there's there's nine times brother brandom says this on on my Revelation but Brother brandom start saying that in 1963 in March 1963 he starts preaching the seals he said now my Revelation on it if you study that out brother brandom is talking about that's my revelation of what the seals is that's my Revelation just it won't take you long just go go look it up in the message and type in my my Revelation it it do you heart real good won't take you very long but it's powerful because brother brandham brother brandham goes in there and every single time he says that in the first second fourth fourth seal and he comes in there and he comes in the seventh seal or question and answers on the seals and then he comes in there he comes in there in the seventh seal he said now my Revelation on the seventh seal and he goes in there if you studied out real listen real closely brother manam starts talking about his ministry in Malachi 4 he's identifying that his ministry has a portion to do with the seventh seal and he starts diving into and he says now there can be no impersonations of it because only one Ministry of Elijah can come and turn the hearts back because there was an anointing on the hour and this ministry that you have received it can be no impersonation to it there can be no impersonation he goes in 19 1963 on on September the 1st he stands there and he preaches a token he goes in there and he starts saying he said now you got to kill the lamb you've got to have the blood on your door you've got to have it he said there can be no make belief the lamb had to die there can be no impersonation of it there can be no make belief you know that it's there and there's been every kind of mimic of vultures that have tried to fly at the same height that you flew at that vulture can look like it he can study it out in the you can study it out in the sky and until you get binoculars you'll think it's an eag flying but it's a vulture and brother rham said that that vulture is Anointed to fly too but he can't fly as high as that eagle can go see there can be no mimics of this message because you are anointed to go where nobody else can go and that's why you can stand Toe to Toe with every devil that comes up in Joshua 10 and you've got a right to put your foot on its neck now I just took you in a whole complete circle but I want to come back to that book I was talking about it's called the day of War and the wrer right this and he said the amates were so scared of entering into the Afterlife headless so David's Warriors wanted to swing with everything within them to make sure they took their heads off they didn't want to just cut their hands off they didn't want to just cut their legs off they wanted to cut their head off glory be to God you have been given a king sword and you are anointed to take down every giant upon every devil of disease and complexes and stigmas and unbelief send every amot that you know of to the Grave headless brother randam said he said now if I've got if I'm being attacked by some Beast he said I he said I ain't got to he said I don't have to just cut his hand off he said if I want to stop the sickness he said I cut its head off he said don't just cut its hand off cut its head off go to them little foxes that keep destroying the vine and cut their head off the message came but it didn't just come to talk about Malachi 4 it didn't just come to talk about Mysteries and things it come to introduce you to your bridegroom it come to put you in position that nobody else is Anointed for let me say Lazarus was made for more than the grave I was made for more than just drugs I was made for more than just alcohol I Was Made for More I was made to be a preacher I was made and anointed by almighty God what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying the anointing is here is here to confirm the word it's got everything you have need of in it this message is a great treasure chest and your faith is handed the key it's handed to you to unlock all the healings all the benefits all the blessings all the Miracles some of you need financial help this message unlocks that some of you need mer marital help this message unlocks it now I got the key in my hand and on the other side of it releases Miracles it releases power it releases Supernatural gifts it releases love divine it releases the most beautiful mysteries of who you are I have it but you got to take it it ain't just for me brother Andrew it ain't just for brother William it ain't just for brother Ron himself but you got to take it we're not a bunch of Catholics where we're depending on the priest here and there we are depending on almighty God you're going to win am you're going to win you're going to make it if you'll just run with it if you'll just take it in your hand it wasn't just for my daddy to hear Let us run what about me what about your job what are you doing with this message are you anointed to run with it it lit my candle and I took off running and I've had every devil in hell try to stop me from running I've had every critic in hell I've had every mimic I've had every idea come against me but I'm anointed to run and I'm not backing down and I'm not giving up I was ordained by almighty God I met him I talk with him I found him to be faithful and I'm anointed now don't just clap for me look at your neighbor they're anointed they're anointed they're going to make it they're going to run it ain't going to be me that just believes for prodical it'll be for you it ain't just going to believe it ain't going to be just me that believes that signs of follow it'll be for you I feel so anointed right now to say this unto you that you're going to make the Rapture how do you know it's me how do you know it's me I heard the voice of many thundering shouting press the battle brother press the battle he climbed up on that mountain he told us what it was like he went on the other side he said it's the most Sublime thing he said only perfect love can enter there I was in them voices I was in them voices Sister Barbara I was in them voices we would not have been here if you had not a run press the battle press I'm going to make it I'm anointed to make it I'm anointed to worship I'm anointed to praise I'm anointed because I took this book and I have found that it's got my name all over it it's got my name all over it and there's not one devil in hell that can stop me from taking what's rightfully mine I'm not alone in this battle the King of Kings has showed up in here to show up and SE out he's anointed me to pray for the sick he's anointed you to lay your hands on them he's anointed you to believe for the impossible what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying the grounds are just right for it brother Chris the atmosphere is just right just like it was with sister Mary the grounds were just right to receive it and she heard the Angel's message it's just like he said all things are possible to them that believe that ground is right there Hallelujah let the musicians come sister Kylie I'd like to have prayer with you you love the Lord how many has a need that you'd like to make known to the Lord today I say there's a there's an anointing here for every one of you no matter what you're facing I know some of your problems but I don't know them all and I'm not the kind of guy that I'm going to go asking but I do know this that
