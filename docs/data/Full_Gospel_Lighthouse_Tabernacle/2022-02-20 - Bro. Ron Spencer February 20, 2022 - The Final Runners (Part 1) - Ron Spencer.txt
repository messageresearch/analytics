sees and meets all these requests that's brother gabriel spencer he would come and lead us to the throne of grace at this time [Music] time we draw our swords just as we heard last night it's time we curse every demon from hell that comes and conquers and tries to destroy each and every one of our lives you know as i think about our pastor he's coming out this morning fighting every every gun that's pointed against him every gun that's pointed against his life for all these many years that cancerous demon it raised its head and my dad and it did not conquer that cancerous demon raised his head in the lane of butts and it did not conquer him that cancerous demon raised his head and randy hinkle and it did not conquer him and we have a pastor that's standing here this morning and that demon will not conquer him because satan you can't have his life his life is god we're all children of god our life is his it is not satan's that comes and fights our our life i had a dream about a year ago and i told i told brother ron this just this week and i don't i don't know exactly what it means but i think back to the the sermon of identified for rapture and i know brother ron has identified for rapture as i had that dream i was standing right here i don't know i'll get i was praying and as i turned around i saw brother ron sitting right in this chair and he had red hair and he had a red mustache and i'd never seen him like that in this life i didn't know what he looked like i i'd never seen him with red hair and a red mustache and as i turned back this way a white cloud swept and hit me right in the face and i woke up from and it stuck with me to this day because every battle that that demon tries to conquer brother ron he stands up and he fights every day and every critic that's out there that tries to come against our pastor you just continue to watch as he raises up and as he raises up again go ahead and keep raising up against our pastor because we will stand here with our swords drawn to fight for him let's bow our heads in prayer [Music] gracious heavenly father as we come to you this morning we come to you humbly and we are just asking that we could just be more sincere with you we know what you told our pastor we know what you told the prophet as he came in this hour if we could just be more sincere if he could just be more sincere lord jesus you will use him like never before and lord jesus that wasn't just for our pastor but that was for us as a children of god and i just ask that you will just come and be with us this morning i ask that you will just allow us to move into that presence as you drop down into this service we invite you to come and be with us we invite you to come and anoint our pastor we uh allow it that you will just come and speak everything that we have in need of it seems as every week that demon raises his head and another child of god and that report from the doctor says that they have cancer and the end may be near they may have to go through different different medicines and medications and treatments but lord jesus we believe the report of the lord and your report says that they are healed and we just believe that you will just come down and send that comforter send that peace over top of their life because fear is from the devil and we will not take anything that comes from satan himself we will only take the word that comes from you lord and we just ask that you will just come down and you will just be with us be which with each and every prayer request no matter the mind battles no matter what may come we just ask that you will just be with us and continue to draw us closer to you this morning and that's in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] amen at this time we're going to receive this morning's offering as you come lay here on the altar you can be seated after you've given me brother randall can you come sing for us if you would and after he's seen brother nathan

an atmosphere that we're in amen let's just talk to him just now amen almighty god how we love you we love you because you loved us [Music] those are the greatest words that could ever be said [Music] that you love us he loved us in spite of our mistakes he loved us in spite of our failures [Music] and you place something on the inside of us that reflected you it was a part of yourself lord and we didn't know it for a long time but we were staggering through life one day you touched our lives and from that day would never be the same oh what it's like to spend a little time with jesus father would you just come today anoint lips of clay one more time lord we we all in this room know that i we need a touch but father you're not here just to touch one you're here to touch us all what a special god that you are you know how to take a broken heart a shattered future [Music] you know how to take plans that have been destroyed and make everything right you know how to take that which was so tainted by sin and make it a vessel of honor that it can be used in the master's house [Music] come today lord you see our needs [Music] there's not a doctor that has the answer it's not a physician not a therapist but there's a mighty god that's in this building right now and you're that kind of god that specializes as brother branham would say he said now put that very difficult case at the front of the line oh god you're that same god today lord help us we pray as the word is read it's already anointed but now anoint us lord who knows how many services we have left in life the earth is coming to its end help us father strengthen us lord give us vision after last night what a phenomenal sermon lord that's way beyond the man's thinking come now and speak to our hearts in jesus name we pray amen and amen and amen and amen god bless you this morning we so love you with all of our hearts and amen trust you've had a good morning amen and i'll try to not take you too far into the afternoon but amen i believe the lord's come to minister to our needs and amen amen if you return with me to first corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24 and if god will give me the strength today i'd like to speak to you about you amen the final runners the final runners amen now paul is going to be the first church age messenger and his message won't dissipate but it will carry through all seven church ages and it will be the standard bearer through the dark ages through the very difficult times it will be through people being burned at the stake their heads cut their their all different kind of things through the fox's book of martyrs there will be believers that will have to live in every age and we're not a bunch of quitters god anoints us from the throne and he releases revelations 1 he releases the messenger and then under that messenger they will be anointed to live and overcome are you with me so god knows exactly when you'll be born and exactly what message to send you to equip you for this day now watch how paul puts these things and i want you to just make this very personal to you first corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24 know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that strivet for the mastery is temporary in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptable notice he he just he very very decisively says there's two different worlds we're in this world but we're not of this world now notice now he's even talking about himself i therefore so run not as uncertainly so sophie'd i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway you may be seated today i don't know about you but there's been some things in my life that i looked so forward to events that were going to happen but after i got to the event it just didn't quite meet my expectation when i was in sin i i would go to concert [Music] and one particular time i i sat just just only just a few feet and from the from the one that was singing and you know it just didn't meet the expectation that i had that i thought it was maybe those in the sports world you you've had an opportunity to be a part of be very close to somebody that is a quite a quite an athlete but at the end of the day it just doesn't meet your expectation everybody's going to lose at some point but when we come to this message and we come to what is in god's mind and what god wants to do for us in a concert we were the spectator in the sports world we were a spectator but in when it comes to the message though you be sitting where you are you're not a spectator are you with me now now the word that we are preaching is seed and seeds have power in it and it's not the words of a man brother man will very quickly tell us you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man you're not feeding on william branham and his personality or any preacher of the message and their personality you're feeding on the message itself and the end time message will bring end time results [Music] and this message will meet the challenge of the hour this message is not incapable we're not going to have to rewrite it or or amended or are actually kind of what you might say even embellish it the message that has the seed life of christ on the inside of it will perform it will change your body it has changed your nature it's changed your lifestyle you know that you know that you know you met him and since you met him you've never been the same amen i believe we're going to have church now brother rahm says he says now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach and if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be so lived it's a voice of god that'll bring a reproach to them that reject it he said all right he said here was voices how we need in jeffersonville thousands of live voices the thunder of god thundering out the sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today that's what the message produces let me just say that's what the message produces is undefiled lives without a blemish he said real christians i like that real christians don't you i hate phony i hate artificial i hate put on i hate embellished i like real i like real men i like real women real christians that's the thunder against the devil the devil don't care how loud you can holler he don't care how much you can jump and how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil i think we ought to shake his kingdom [Applause] i thought i would just take a moment here we are all aware that i'm in a very difficult journey sometimes in journeys some journeys are are just a quick trial and some journeys are for the rest of your life or for a long time period and in some of those journeys we as humans we get weary we we begin to question things and we begin to do this or that and and we begin to to think has god forgotten me or and i'm saying this not just for myself trials that that begin to take on leaves of times great difficulties maybe many doctors lots of medicines involved still going to church still saying the same powerful quotes and same scriptures and and you're just hanging on you're just marching forward head down moving forward but god reminds us you're not alone in the fight and i want to say this to you as an audience and those in the internet you're not alone in your fight god puts around you men and women are you with me that they're there they're anointed to say the right things in the right moments to give you courage and give you strength [Music] anybody can quit anybody can say i've had enough but it takes something on the inside of you that grabs your bootstraps and you begin to move forward regardless of the circumstances i'll just mention a few names and i i'm not going to go far here but in my life there's a mike walls and a lloyd just out of the blue that just just write me just just really write me and they just drop me a word drop a word of strength and power just the right moment and when i hear it in their voices they're not just saying it to say it you know i've got friends like tim pruitt and donny reagan these are some of the most powerful generals that's on the earth and i could name a whole lot of other generals but these are men happen to be close friends and i've got a lot of close friends but they're men that have that have fought with the battle been there with me you've got friends like that don't and i'm using i am saying this and i'm stretching just a bit let me just say this you don't never let the devil tell you you're alone did you hear that sister short you're not alone whether you know it or not i was praying you'd be here and it's time for that battle to come to an end [Applause] well they're preachers there's a friend of mine named tim nunnwyler he'll watch this service this afternoon most likely he's in canada he's a trustee in a church there he sings he's a he's a wonderful man he came to a meeting recently drove many hours to the meeting and he said i know i probably won't be able to shake your hand or hug your neck and i saw him in the in the parking lot as i was leaving in the last service and they were ushering me into the car real quickly i said just a moment i got a friend here that's in the background he'll send me a note every week he'll send me a note that has power in it strength in it something just i've actually read some of these things and never called his name but listen that man has a ministry and he'll probably never preaching us in a pulpit are you with me now that's powerful jonas hildebrandt george quinn that writes me every week he's a general in ireland wrote me this i believe just this just a couple days ago and and has about 20 people in his church in that catholic nation and let me just say that's a mega church that's a mega church in ireland these are men and women that have found a way that on the other end of a phone whether by text or word by words and i've only picked out just a couple to use in this example i could spend two weeks here but i want you to understand and please nobody get offended but let me just say they have found a way a channel to release words that have power i want you to get it sometimes when you walk in service and you turn and shake somebody's hand and just say a sentence to them you do not know the trial that your neighbor has went through in a very secret way but your words may be more powerful than the entire sermon [Applause] if we could just live a life in a situation if we are the final runners every day matters every hour matters i'd like to just say this blue devil blue devil i'd like to remind him we are not alone now i i just want to just venture here just for a moment we have a very common enemy he's an enemy that god built as the antitype to light he is darkness god is lot he is hate god is love he is joy satan's depression god tells the truth and he is a liar and he's very good at his enemy as being an enemy god built him so and then he's building him so he would fight knowing he's losing he would fight to the bitter end believing i can overthrow the kingdom of god but the end of the book says he'll be cast into every darkness he'll be totally annihilated so satan can watch he can watch the lights and that dimension he can watch through time remember when he was standing with jesus and said if thou be the son of god i want to just say this to you satan also saw the stars line up he also heard the angels sing the first noel he also saw the angel of god come to a virgin so satan was a witness how can he tell you're a christian because the ambience of light that is around you young people whether you realize it or not your struggle you may not be able to understand your whole life but satan watches that realm of light that comes to you and he will fight you on a level that he can fight you with he'll fight you in your humanity he'll fight you in your mind he'll fight you in your physical struggle is it not any wonder that he's trying to fight myself and many others he don't have a lot of time to do to work and we have brought him much damage [Applause] the little girl called me the other day she's not just any little girl her name is ella ella was a girl that was born with a disease that would handicap her to crawl on the floor very almost animalistic doctors could give her no hope they've worked with her all of her life the last time i was there i got her to walk up to the platform with me and i felt very led to do that amen because satan has put every gun that he can put against her because he can see that light he can see that ambience of light that is around her and if you sit with much with her she can out quote most preacher she can quote more scriptures than than most anybody that i know and yet she has almost an angelic anointing with her yet with that disease that is so handicapped her body she called me the other day and and i was i was i was in my office and she said brother ron she said i just out of the blue had you on my heart and i thought i'm going to do more than just send a text i'm going to call she began to talk for a bit and i just i just said lord let her atmosphere just charge this office toward the end she said i'm getting ready to graduate in a few days they gave her no hope you'll never be nothing she called me here a few mo about a month ago and she said pray for me today brother ron she said i'm going to get my driver's license [Applause] don't tell me about your excuses gird up your loins and fight like you've never fought before she said no i said well what were we going to do with our life ella she said when i graduate she said i've already been accepted i'm going to be a lawyer i said ella i believe with all my heart you'll be one of the best lawyers that's ever been that stupid devil doesn't know what he's got to hold up i want to say that not just for ella but for you as believers that stupid devil doesn't know what he's got to hold up when he's got a hulk of a real genuine believer hallelujah [Applause] prophet said god's purpose can never be defeated roll your shoulders back and tell the enemy this is one sunday morning you're not going to rob my victory from men [Music] when we realize what god has deposited what god has gathered you couldn't have been born in any other age god saved you for the very last listen any coach will have his best runner at the very end god's way above any coach or any olympic official he's got his final runner to run in this last layout of seeing age an age that's unfit to even live in but he's got a people that will not be distracted will not be deterred she is fortified by the word of god she's not going back we heard last night that we were in the vision let me just say the vision has become reality and now the real as long as it was vision you could you could do a lot of things with it you could just kind of say someday someday someday someday but the vision is now reality and now satan has the vision on his hands what was once in the vision of god's mind is now in human flesh born of his bone life of his life power of his power if he's hit on 16 silvers so will the bride the message is more than a picture but it's in human flesh [Applause] now god's strategy is to empty human vessels and shake the world with them what world will you shake the one you work with the community that you live in and you may not even have to open your mouth the power of your life the power of your atmosphere the power of the anointing that is upon you you didn't give that to yourself you didn't go looking for that but god came looking for you and he knew the kind of trouble that you would be in and that did not frustrate him woman at the well the woman at the well do you think god didn't know she had five husbands that one she living with was not her husband but she was going to be one of the greatest witnesses witness of grace witness of mercy witness of what god can take with his creative word and speak to her a woman that was a harlot a woman that had been scarred a woman that had many many many past stories in her life and tons of excuses that was the woman that god chose to be a witness so don't tell me about your excuses [Music] brother ron but us as women we have such a handicap really really first of all it has been scientifically proved that in the feminine gender she thinks much faster than a man you men ought to amend all over this building roll your shoulders back you can think how great you are but you've never won an argument don't be mad at me brothers you know it's a truth only reason you did she let you can remember things that was done on a tuesday of 1982 in the afternoon at four o'clock that's right brother bill brother ron why would you go there then what did god deposit in the feminist part of himself satan you thought i was going to get something stirred i am that's why this bride thinks on a different level because god deposited that on the inside of her and she does take the word of god and she knows what she wants done with it and she does that word [Applause] it is no wonder you tongue tie the devil and he runs back like a little scared puppy dog back into hell because you whip him day after day after day after day [Applause] brother graham said i'm so glad that a man can so completely serve god tell the devil don't know what to do with him i want a scripture okay he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength i want to see a miracle today brother ron you're watching one [Applause] even the youth will fail and be weary young men shall literally fall but they that wait upon the lord but they that wait upon the lord don't get ahead of god don't try to write the book before god writes it [Music] they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run not be weary they shall walk and nothing i want to remind you of with scripture no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that riseth against thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn stay with me here so the enemy torment take his name just take his name just take his name down can i have your name what do you need with my name i'm a demon i'm going to use it against you oh yeah there's going to be a day where i'm standing with god in judgment and i'm going to call your name because you tormented me and god's going to pour his wrath out on you now i may not be able to destroy you today but there's coming a day mr cancer there's coming a day there's coming a day where you're going to regret ever me coming into my life you're going to regret [Applause] you're going to regret making me sick you're going to regret the things that you put me through you're going to regret it [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] you've been going through a battle of the last few weeks brother nathanael satan's going to regret that was on your way to church and was in an accident satan's going to regret that [Music] just because they're your bosses are you with me that don't make them lords over top of you they're going to regret that you may be married to an abuser you don't have to stay with them satan's going to regret that [Applause] maybe i meant revelations 5 and verse 9 i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and the best of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god that went forth into the all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints god don't forget your prayers satan if you're fighting your people which i know you are i want you this is your scripture our prayers are not forgotten amen what place was that okay now this is our part and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to loose the and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and that's redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred tongue people and nation we're that scripture our new song is i'm not a drunk no more i'm not a porn addict no more i don't live a horrible life no more i am redeemed and it's that blood that redeemed me religion wants to take the blood out of it are you with me they want to take the deity of jesus christ out of it they want to take the emotion out of it are you with me but when i think about what god did for me it causes me to be emotional and they sung my new song the preacher walked down the stairs and walked out in the streets he said do you know grace [Music] do you know grace and he was screaming to the tops of his lungs and somebody walked by and he said who are you talking about he said the amazing grace of jesus christ we were worthy of hell we were on our way but god rich in mercy paul was in the last moments of his life and they were sharpening the stone the the the ax that would cut his head off did he have a pity party would you listen these words i have fought a good fight hallelujah may that be said of me i have fought a good fight if i can encourage you this this morning fight with everything that's inside of you don't be some whoopee pussycat that don't has a spineless backbone that just goes along with anything in the world be a real man be a real lady i don't care the cost eternity awaits for us i'm not looking for an easier way i'm not needing to be pumped up i don't need pumped and splenda i need him this first before that it says for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand and i'm not reading that this morning for you to think that my divine is left is is over this is not my last sermon [Applause] i've accepted several meetings this year and i plan to be in them and to be in the meetings i've got to have the strength to do it i could have stayed at home today i felt rough when i got up i feel rough standing right here but i'm not paying no attention to the flesh one pastor told me this week he said brother ron he said somebody called me this week and he said they have some silly little excuse and he said i thought about you why think about brother homer he preached his last sermon in a wheelchair with one leg satan do your best he still won the devil is just stupid why don't you just say it with me devil you're stupid that's it felt good didn't it did it feel good tell your neighbor that feel good so if it felt good do it again go ahead and tell him again you've been picking on me all week and now i've come to church and i want to tell you in church devil you're stupid that felt good then is that now somebody might think that's rude for you to say something about somebody else like that but i'm giving you a license raise your right hand go ahead and raise your right hand this is your oath of office because you're a son and daughter of god you have a right [Applause] not just on sunday morning but you got a right to tell the devil you stupid but we're not done with the conversation yet tell him he's defeated too he was defeated at calvary [Applause] uh hallelujah [Applause] hebrews chapter 11. we could talk about enoch we can talk about abraham we can talk about sarah we can talk about noah verse 32. good place to pick up what more shall i say for the time would fail me to tell you of gideon and a beararch and of samson and of jackknife and of david and of samuel every one of these names are a book of victory and satan knows that they whipped him and so the anointed messenger of the day goes back through the time period and he picks these names up to elevate them and now for 2000 years men and women have read these names and it reminds them oh i feel like preaching it reminds the devil that you couldn't beat bay right and you couldn't beat jeff now and you couldn't beat david and you couldn't beat samson and in the tribulation period he's going to be reminded you couldn't beat ron you couldn't beat dinner you couldn't beat him you couldn't meet donny you couldn't be joel [Applause] satan your kingdom is coming down you cannot win hallelujah [Applause] they did not go down in defeat they may have been sown asunder they may have died of starvation they may have died of disease but they did not go down in defeat i could name many from this audience steve did not go down in defeat he did not go down his feet your mama did not go down in defeat god having provided some better thing for us that they without us cannot be made perfect what a responsibility that puts on us let's just stop just for a moment of all the expectation that god has for us at this time somebody's got to finish somebody's got to be the final runner that means a final representative putin's making all his nonsense and he don't realize there's angels standing there let's just say it how it is even in our oval office they can't do nothing they are handicapped they are handicapped because angels of god are standing there keeping them from destroying the world because we're here you read it in your newspaper you read it of all of the travesties in people's lives innocent people and just tragedies get a hold of them why didn't that happen to you let's just stop and be thankful here just for a moment because there's many times we walk into church and we go god do something for me and he's had angels dispatch at your house and maybe somebody would like to rob houses today and they come by your house and an angel told them not here that's better than having a watchdog not here you go on somewhere else maybe a fire would have started and all of a sudden an angel puts it out so many times we we thank god for what god saved us from we look back in our lives and i so appreciated that brother andrew from a vision how many people's lives have been affected from that vision last year we preached a message here on a sunday morning like this and we were sending it to to edmonton and they were they were streaming at the same time live there's a sister named terry and she's about my age maybe a bit younger you can thank me later and terry is a musician in the church he's never been married she's a musician in the church there and she was a folk singer and a preacher named don babis came into her life and began to witness the message to her her family literally wanted to destroy her because she throwed away her career and they thought she just went off on the deal and she's you know being a single woman she's she's lived a very lonely life in a lot of times and she said that she was sitting on a park bench kind of going through her life thinking about the what could have beens and the what-ifs and kind of feeling sorry for herself and she comes on that sunday morning and god drops in that service 2500 miles away and goes to a park bench and reads what's going on in that life and she gets it you tell me god's not mindful of you i'm going to say something that's going to be way at the left field but i'm going to say it because somebody way higher than me said it david you've been through a lot of difficult things in your life and you my sister have been crushed in a lot of ways but you see god loved david so much to get him here he had to send you through those things to get him here brother honor are you out of your mind that's how personal god is that's how much he loves you that's how much he loves you that's how much he loves your mother when he starts collecting final can runners have some liberty here i guess i do god don't necessarily pick up hollywood actors so one of these most powerful generals is born with a debilitating disease to where he walks on his ankles did that stop him for joe green born with a debilitating disease did that stop god let me just keep coming whitney born with a wound the way that it was born and davey marries her knowing i can't have children with her but i love her so much but god has a plan but brother ron i've been sent through some horrible storms he's walking with you in the storm how did i get here you didn't come here on your own god guided you here and sometimes in the guiding he's put some storms in there right in there right it's put some really bad storms in life there's some really rough days there's been some really ring in the hands it's been has god forgot me and he's sitting here on the sunday morning and said i brought you through all of that and if we could trust god to get us through all of that he can get us there [Applause] hebrews chapter 12 in verse 1 we're foresee and we're compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses for a moment i'd like you to think about who's standing watching you they're better than a super bowl audience they're better than an olympic experience they're not just watching they're encouraging i've come full circle and you heard me mention men like tim nunnweiler you never heard his name before you heard me mention others ella word of encouragement can you imagine from another realm those that have overcome and they're standing there and they're watching you and encouraging you and strengthening you and the devil was telling you you were alone can i give you insight there's thousands of angels and the strong angel himself is here to make sure that this bride and this word does what it says it'll do i'm gonna say something very carnal here just for a moment in a business there's nobody that will do the business like the owner you can go to mcdonald's you can go wherever and you can always tell who's the owner of the shop the owner the constructor the owner of the suit shop the owner of the shoe shop the owner goes the extra mile so god's not just sent some ordinary angel but he himself has come down god himself to accomplish what he should do it's pretty staggering isn't it yeah that's first down i'm not gonna ask who's run one but who knows what a marathon's out like marathon marathon is what 20 help me here cassie what in the world 26 miles 26 miles is what a marathon is now marathon's not for the faint of heart it's not for sprinters sprinters they build their self up they strengthen themselves they they use all the right training to do the quick step i never was there i was never that but the guy that's in a marathon knows i gotta get myself a shake 26 miles is 26 miles and so a guy that's really a marathoner and i'm talking about the real deal he's going to do a whole lot more than 26 miles in a day if he's anticipating winning now in a marathon there's a lot of stars come out i'm gonna run a marathon today i'm gonna run the boston marathon today they get the best they get the number they get their pictures taken this is for you brother david mayor they wave at everybody and they go look who's running in the marathon today so and so he's running in the marathon today he ain't gonna run far he's gonna use more energy on that wave than he is on his feet nobody goes before the whistle and then they have a starting gun they should learn to use those in hollywood and they they shoot and everybody takes off and they start running well you know there's a lot of people hanging on that first first little bit they've been doing that in their living room this thing they seem so bad all sudden water starts coming down their eyes they ain't seen that before and they go by and they need a gallon of water instead of a cup is that all i get and their ankle starts hurting and their shin starts hurting and their knees start hurting backstarter you know ain't no need to be torturing myself i'm done see y'all have a good run see y'all that's what happens in church a lot of people have stood and waved at the audience i'm here i'm here well sit down baby go ahead and take your seat we ain't taking your picture this is going to be more than a little sprint this is for life [Applause] you know the other day there was a marathon went on in louisiana and this little fella was never supposed to walk he was born with a defect in his hip and he was never supposed to walk but so happened god had a different plan i got the video on my phone i could show it to you but little drew was running and the doctor was on the other side watching and here comes the miracle he wasn't setting no records but he was running you don't have to set records here but you're ironic [Applause] i got a whole lot more material but i want to finish here if you just give me just a just a few more seconds now i might if i could just share anything with you this morning and i can be an encouragement to you no matter what you're going through and i mean no matter what you're going through is yesterday was probably one of the sickest days of my life i don't need no pity party i don't need nobody to hold my hair back but these boys have been really good to keep me the sickness from being in the public but there was just no way i could be in service last night just no way so when i woke up at a quarter to six this morning the booger was standing at the bed and he said boy you feel too bad you feel way too bad so i just throw my feet right out on the floor and i sit there same blurry vision same headache i said hmm i believe i'll take a walk i walk every morning on the treadmill no matter how bad i feel how good i feel no matter if i have to stop it and just i'll just tell you no matter if i have to stop it and go throw up get cleaned up i get right back on that treadmill i don't go pity me you're the only one fighting this fight i just get right back on the treadmill because i've always got a sermon going and there's something in that sermon that's going to speak to my heart so i get right back on the treadmill and i get my two bottles of water it's a long-standing joke in my house ron is the only man that can live dehydrated i'm not setting records but i walk three miles every morning and when i get done i get to that three mile mark i don't shout i don't jump i push stop and that's what you got to do sometimes when you come to church sometimes you may not feel like [Music] you might not feel the part but god called you and he put something on the inside of you that got your feet up on the floor and you shook your head and your hair was a mess and your breath smells like a dinosaur died there last night but you get yourself up and you get on your spiritual treadmill and said if god called me to walk i'm going to walk if they call me to run i'm on a run if they call me to dance i'm going to dance i'm going to move forward i'm going to press the mark [Applause] hallelujah we will not be defeated we will not be defeated [Music] making tomorrow be better it might be better tomorrow being better sister short because you made a decision sitting here today that tomorrow's going to be better i've wasted my life long enough i'm going forward i'm going forward i'm going forward devil been picking on you won't you tell him today's your last day to do that kind of deal i'm going forward i'm marching forward i may not take big steps but i'm going to step forward all god requires is you to take the first step he'll help you with the rest of them what about my friends what about your friends what about my difficulties what about your difficulties what about the things that i'm going to have to face what about them if i got jesus [Applause] if i got jesus i got everything i need well i'm gonna need another example you can stay standing and musicians couldn't come brother branham said he could see his end out there at 56. as a prophet he could see things that we can't see and he knew he was coming to an end did that make him quit when he was speaking in shreveport for his last time he makes a statement in the opening service he couldn't go on a certain hunt that hunt was with brother biscuit he just had canceled that hunt with brother biscuit because he wanted to do more for the lord that's what he said and he said said there's brother here that wasn't here isn't here this year that was here last year and he said i may not be here next year what he was saying was absolutely right i may not be here next year and he was saying that to the audience i may not be here next year did that make him deter he preaches some of the most powerful sermons ever preached by a preacher standing in a pulpit and he delivers his heart then he will make a couple different trips and he'll speak some sermons one being leadership and you can hear him talk about and in that sermon he talks about the rich young ruler that he came so close i want to say this in my final statements to you as an audience this afternoon i don't want to come so close and miss it i don't want to spend so much energy and come to the end and a little hiccup it's not a job there's not a woman there's not a bank account worth a hiccup brother vernon just you related something to me the other day and it stuck with me stuck with me thick i i left i left and brother vernon said you remember brother homer would make a statement said he made some strong statements that were hard and said sometimes i kind of i kind of wish he wouldn't talk so hard but he said he would tell it he said he said you have got something in your life that you're putting ahead of god he said god got to take that right out of your he'll take that right out of your life if you put god first in your life in everything you do everything everything how can i how can i keep this fire burning you put him first in everything you do and there's nothing that devil the devil can do to shake you and let me just remind you it's not what you do in public it's what you do privately what you see right here publicly goes to the whole world but what you don't see is the untold hours of study for me now blurred vision bring fog difficulty fighting my way through just to study get get the thought but it's worth it the song says it'll be worth it after all child it'll be worth it after all through all of these trials it'll be worth it after all sister connie i've caused you much problems in your life and i'm sorry but one day you'll stand as my queen through eternity you'll put your arm up under my arm we'll walk up those corridors of heaven when he calls my name you'll walk with me we'll walk up there you won't be a
