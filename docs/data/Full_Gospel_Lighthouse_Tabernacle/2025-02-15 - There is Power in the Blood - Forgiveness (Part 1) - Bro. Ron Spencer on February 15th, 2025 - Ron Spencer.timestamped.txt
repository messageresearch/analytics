[16:20] and and now I look and I've got a
[16:21] beautiful wife with beautiful boy and um
[16:24] about to have a beautiful girl and then
[16:27] with with how he's just carried me
[16:28] through do the job and uh he's he's
[16:30] helped me all along the way and you know
[16:32] if you're on the fence just make that
[16:34] decision make that decision and not only
[16:37] does he bless us but he keeps us safe
[16:39] and and you know I'll take it back just
[16:40] a couple weeks ago I've told a testimony
[16:42] before about how the god SP how God
[16:44] spared my life but here a couple weeks
[16:46] ago um we were we were working an
[16:49] investigation and um somebody set me up
[16:53] and uh we had we had had some
[16:55] investigating agents they were they were
[16:57] kind of sitting around watching the
[16:58] house we knew knew who was there and
[17:00] they set me up said they were the only
[17:01] ones there and so they said just come on
[17:03] in the door you're fine just come on
[17:05] inside and uh so we knew what was going
[17:08] on and naturally if you set if you set a
[17:11] cop up well if you didn't know the next
[17:13] day you're going to get your doors
[17:14] kicked in so um they set me up we kicked
[17:18] in the doors and I was able to go in
[17:20] there and arrest the person that had set
[17:21] us up and I'm also a person that
[17:24] believes in Grace and I sat in front of
[17:27] them the next day and offer them a
[17:28] chance of
[17:29] God I don't care I don't care what
[17:32] anything has ever been done to you
[17:34] that's who I am and that's what I
[17:36] believe Christ sent us to do and I'm
[17:38] just thankful that God has been able to
[17:39] protect me and protect my family and
[17:41] protect us from everything we come in
[17:43] contact with and Grace goes beyond
[17:46] bounds no matter what what lines have
[17:48] been drawn Grace goes beyond bounds I
[17:51] always choose
[17:52] Grace we just take these needs of the
[17:56] Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[17:59] come before you tonight and Lord I just
[18:01] thank about all the all the wonderful
[18:03] blessings you've been able to put in
[18:04] front of us and you've been able to keep
[18:06] us from so many things and keep us keep
[18:09] us safe from from dangers and things
[18:11] that we don't even know that would come
[18:13] and we know that we would have a Prophet
[18:15] come and he would preach sermon after
[18:16] sermon about Grace and Lord he would
[18:18] also preach about investigating angels
[18:20] and how those investigating Angels would
[18:22] come and they would stand before us and
[18:24] they would block one way or the other
[18:26] and we see we see even Moses and how how
[18:28] the angel Gabriel would come down and
[18:30] put his foot on on every nose of the
[18:32] crocodile that would come up and try to
[18:34] destroy and I just believe that we're
[18:36] living in a day that we're living in a
[18:38] day that Lord you're here to protect us
[18:41] and Lord you're here to work miracles
[18:43] and you're here to you're here to be
[18:45] able to move among your children and
[18:47] move among the sons and daughters of God
[18:49] and we're here to take back everything
[18:51] Satan's ever stole from us and Lord
[18:53] Jesus I just believe that you could come
[18:54] down and you've heard the you've heard
[18:56] the many prayer requests you hear the
[18:58] the brother there that brother Randy hle
[18:59] brought up and they've gave him weeks to
[19:01] live but Lord Jesus we live in a day
[19:03] that no matter what doctors say they can
[19:05] offer so many great things but as
[19:07] science goes up so does we see that
[19:09] we're going up higher and higher and I
[19:11] believe that when we ask it we shall
[19:13] take it and receive it Lord and I just
[19:15] believe that every single one of these
[19:16] prayer requests no matter the sick needy
[19:18] no matter how small to how big Lord when
[19:21] we lift it up to you and ask it in Jesus
[19:23] name you will come and you will answer
[19:24] it Lord and I just believe that you will
[19:26] just come down in a mighty way in this
[19:28] service and allow us to be able to move
[19:30] closer to you and move higher and and
[19:32] and move into the calling and the
[19:33] potential that you've that you've called
[19:35] unto us Lord and I just thank you for
[19:37] all that you're doing for us and all

[19:55] sweep your bride away and Lord Jesus I

[38:30] 29 and then Hebrews chapter 9 and verse
[38:39] 20 I want to speak on there is power in
[38:43] the blood amen this is forgiveness part
[38:47] one amen I'm thankful for that today
[38:49] aren't you
[38:53] amen
[38:56] amen brother brandom said this without
[38:58] the shedding of
[39:00] blood there's no remission of
[39:03] sins take the blood out and you've got
[39:06] nothing else but a cold formal Creed
[39:11] life lays in the blood that's right life
[39:15] comes from the blood and the blood comes
[39:19] from the male sect
[39:22] exactly John 1 and verse
[39:25] 29 and the next day day John seeth Jesus
[39:30] coming unto him and said and what a
[39:32] statement this must have been for all of
[39:34] those people to
[39:35] see Behold the Lamb of God which taketh
[39:40] away the sin of the
[39:44] world let's read that together and the
[39:47] next day John seeth Jesus coming unto
[39:51] him and saith Behold the Lamb of God
[39:55] which taketh away the sin
[39:58] of the world let's pray Lord Jesus we
[40:00] love you
[40:01] tonight father we ask you to forgive us
[40:04] of our sins and our mistakes and
[40:07] failures father it's just a joy to serve
[40:10] you with all of our hearts and we have
[40:12] gathered tonight on this evening to
[40:14] worship you we already feel your
[40:16] presence and we put our our licks of
[40:19] fire together and Lord I just ask you to
[40:22] touch brother Andrew tonight all those
[40:25] that are in the building that are not
[40:26] feeling well we ask you that you'd touch
[40:28] them those that are a homesick we pray
[40:31] that you'd touch them in a special way
[40:34] Lord we just thank you for this word
[40:36] this evening may you anoint it anoint
[40:39] the speaker and the hearer we pray in
[40:42] Jesus Christ's name we ask amen and amen
[40:45] you can be seated
[40:51] amen up until this moment this Prophet
[40:55] John it had only been by blood of bulls
[40:58] and
[41:01] goats but when he makes this statement
[41:04] the blood of bulls and goats are no
[41:07] longer a veil amen Behold the Lamb of
[41:12] God which taketh away the sin of the
[41:16] world in Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 20
[41:19] saying this is the blood of the
[41:22] testament which God hath enjoined unto
[41:24] you moreover he sprinkle the with blood
[41:28] both the Tabernacle and all the vessels
[41:31] of the ministry and almost all things
[41:34] are by law purged with
[41:37] blood this is a powerful statement and
[41:40] without shedding of
[41:42] blood there is of blood of no remission
[41:48] listen we got to have
[41:50] blood in John chapter 14 and verse one
[41:54] let not your heart be troubled you
[41:57] believe in God believe also in
[42:00] me in my father's house are many
[42:03] mansions and if it were not so I would
[42:06] have told you I go to prepare a place
[42:10] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[42:13] for you I will come again and receive
[42:15] you unto myself that where I am there
[42:18] you may be also and whether you go you
[42:21] know and the way that you know and
[42:23] Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not
[42:27] whether thou goest and how can we know
[42:29] the way this is a phenomenal statement
[42:31] now and Jesus saith unto him I am the
[42:38] way I am the way and the life and no man
[42:43] cometh unto the father but by me I want
[42:47] you to understand tonight he is not one
[42:49] of the
[42:51] [Music]
[42:53] ways he is not one of the ways that
[42:57] there's not 50 other ways to get to God
[43:00] he's the only
[43:03] way 911 we had a h a
[43:07] tremendous uh catastrophe or disaster in
[43:10] America and they call for a National
[43:13] Prayer and so many different religions
[43:17] came and and they came and many speakers
[43:20] from all of these religions came and and
[43:22] gave their statement and then gave their
[43:24] prayer bringing the United States
[43:27] together after the disaster women
[43:30] speakers then speakers from Buddha
[43:32] speakers from other and they came and
[43:35] they presented their God before America
[43:38] Billy Graham was known as the pastor of
[43:40] of America and Pastor the presidents and
[43:44] now his son is the pastor to presidents
[43:46] they are saying Billy Graham got up and
[43:49] he was being
[43:51] political and he said we all serve the
[43:54] same
[43:55] God let me just say we don't serve
[44:00] Buddha we don't serve Muhammad listen
[44:04] they can run their their horse and
[44:06] change it every so often for Muhammad
[44:09] when he raises and they say he'll raise
[44:11] one day listen Our God went to the
[44:16] grave and he said you can destroy this
[44:19] Temple and in three days I'll raise it
[44:22] back up again we would not be here
[44:25] tonight if it had been four days or 5
[44:27] days or six days but he raised on the
[44:30] third
[44:32] day and when he walked into the kingdom
[44:35] of hell he took over
[44:38] hell and he took the keys of death hell
[44:42] and the
[44:43] grave and he stripped Satan of his
[44:47] power and how we know that the scripture
[44:49] says when Paul came to his time to die
[44:52] when they were going to chop his head
[44:54] off he
[44:55] screamed oh oh death where's your
[44:58] Victory oh oh grave where's your victory
[45:03] at I think this is a phenomenal thing
[45:07] when when we arrive in
[45:10] heaven brother bandam some said someday
[45:13] when life is
[45:15] over friends I've often wondered what
[45:19] will take place when all the redeemed of
[45:22] the ages will stand around and we come
[45:25] and Crown Him King of Kings K and Lord
[45:28] of lords and when Angels shall be bowed
[45:31] their heads and not
[45:33] knowing what they're we're talking about
[45:36] notice what he says Angels that's been
[45:39] with him throughout the
[45:43] eternities When we arrive they'll bow
[45:47] their heads they don't know what it is
[45:49] to sin right they never fail they don't
[45:53] know what it is to be lost they never
[45:56] was
[46:02] lost but we who have been
[46:05] lost listen it takes every one of us
[46:09] in we who have been lost he said and
[46:13] been found and redeemed and claimed back
[46:16] and brought out of the devil's pawn shop
[46:20] by the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[46:23] his sacrifice sacrificial death I'm
[46:26] telling you you talk about screaming and
[46:29] hollering and going on it'll be that day
[46:32] when they
[46:36] redeemed don't tell me not to
[46:39] shout don't tell me not to scream don't
[46:42] tell me not to get
[46:44] excited when we sing Amazing Grace how
[46:47] sweet the sound that saved a
[46:52] Wretch like Me I once was lost but now
[46:55] I'm found I was blind but now I
[47:01] see he said look what a day at Calvary
[47:04] did for you it paid your
[47:08] price right I love this next thing it
[47:12] settled the
[47:15] question your sins be as Scarlet they're
[47:18] white as snow red like Crimson white
[47:22] like wool then you have no sin
[47:27] you are perfectly sinless listen this is
[47:30] a
[47:31] Prophet this ain't some average preacher
[47:34] God's telling you you are
[47:38] sinless look over at your neighbor and
[47:40] say you are
[47:42] sinless God has paid the
[47:45] price I'm trying to
[47:49] behave no matter what you've
[47:52] done or what you do you're still sinless
[47:58] as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ
[48:00] as your savior your sins are
[48:07] forgiven your sins are forgiven anything
[48:10] that is Forgiven is
[48:13] remitted and forgot
[48:16] about you Lord what can wash away my
[48:19] sins nothing but the blood of
[48:23] Jesus then God himself become a Kinsman
[48:27] by taking on human flesh through the
[48:30] Virgin birth and he shed his blood that
[48:33] wasn't the blood of a Jew notice the
[48:35] statement that wasn't the blood of a Jew
[48:39] it wasn't the blood of a gentile it was
[48:42] the blood of
[48:47] god notice the statement that wasn't the
[48:51] blood of a Jew I want you to get it it
[48:54] wasn't the blood of a gentile it was the
[48:57] blood of God we're saved through the
[49:01] blood of
[49:03] God brother Thomas we're glad to have
[49:06] you back too
[49:09] buddy God brought him through that back
[49:12] operation amen now just to recover and
[49:14] you behave yourself while you recover
[49:17] too I'm a good one to
[49:22] talk now remember it wasn't part Mary
[49:26] and part
[49:29] God Amen it was not part Mary and part
[49:36] god Mary's
[49:39] blood was as toxin as anybody else's
[49:44] blood when Adam fell the blood became
[49:48] toxic
[49:50] right listen no man can die for another
[49:53] man's sins
[49:56] and Mary though being a virgin before
[50:00] God her blood was
[50:03] toxic that came from this cursed
[50:06] Earth God borrowed her
[50:10] womb but what about all the statutes of
[50:13] Mary listen I appreciate all the
[50:15] statutes of Mary and we all respect that
[50:18] but she couldn't die for
[50:21] me she is not
[50:24] God listen I know of your Catholic
[50:27] background you worship Mary but let me
[50:29] just say this to you she's our
[50:33] sister she's our
[50:38] sister nothing moved her when the angel
[50:41] came she didn't feel any sensation
[50:44] that's right but she did feel sensation
[50:47] when she received the Holy Ghost in the
[50:50] upper room and came out shouting and
[50:52] dancing and speaking in tongues and
[50:54] brother Bram said if Mary Had to do that
[50:57] you've got to do
[51:01] that listen it was not Mary's blood that
[51:05] paid for your sins it was the blood of
[51:09] Jesus Christ of God that paid for your
[51:14] sins listen we know this let's hammer it
[51:16] down to the devil that Whispers In Your
[51:18] Ear God became
[51:24] flesh not the blood of a prophet that's
[51:32] right now watch what he says through the
[51:36] blood the washing of the blood the
[51:40] taking away the separating of sin that
[51:44] Holy Spirit Woos a Believer through the
[51:46] blood the cleansing of Soul into
[51:49] Fellowship into his Spirit life inside
[51:53] with Christ shut out the world the very
[51:57] nature of God is in
[52:00] you I want you to say the very nature of
[52:03] God is in
[52:07] me still subject to
[52:10] mistakes I'm glad brother BR said this
[52:13] still subject to
[52:16] mistakes but God can't see
[52:21] [Applause]
[52:23] it brother Ron I don't make any mistakes
[52:26] Hast standing you be the preacher
[52:30] tonight but God can't see it because
[52:34] it's covered by the blood now they don't
[52:36] give you a license to sin rob banks and
[52:39] commit
[52:44] adultery God can't see through the blood
[52:48] he said every time he looks through the
[52:51] blood it looks
[52:54] white he looks through the blood and he
[52:57] sees
[52:59] white that ought to make you shout right
[53:03] now now listen many religions have
[53:06] removed the blood there are Bibles that
[53:09] you can get that are very familiar to a
[53:12] lot of us and they have removed the
[53:18] blood they removed the blood from it
[53:22] there's songs that they remove the blood
[53:25] from it right in the 1980s there was a
[53:28] movement that came through the message I
[53:30] was a young Christian literally I was
[53:33] just I was just a couple of weeks old as
[53:36] a Christian and then me and Connie had
[53:39] got married we went to a convention and
[53:41] in that convention and preacher got up
[53:44] and said aren't you thankful we don't
[53:46] need the blood no more and I said listen
[53:48] I know better than
[53:50] [Music]
[53:51] that I know better than that we still
[53:55] got to have the blood
[54:00] your former Pastor brother Homer Fraser
[54:02] P who this church has been built upon he
[54:06] said it's time for us to leave we got up
[54:09] and walked out of that service he said
[54:11] if you don't have the blood there's no
[54:15] life in it
[54:26] let me just say this to you you can cut
[54:28] muscles off of
[54:29] you and you'll still
[54:32] live you can take organs out of you and
[54:35] you'll still live I'm living today with
[54:38] organs that are dead and I use medicine
[54:41] to keep me alive but let me just say if
[54:44] the blood
[54:47] stops if that heart quits
[54:51] beating are you with me your muscles can
[54:54] die your organs can die but you let that
[54:57] blood
[54:58] stop come on help me preach you let the
[55:02] blood stop in a
[55:05] church that church becomes kabad and the
[55:09] presence of God is no longer with
[55:14] it you let worship stop in a church
[55:17] it'll become
[55:19] death because the presence of God
[55:22] indwells and inhabits with the Praises
[55:25] of his
[55:27] [Applause]
[55:33] people let me just say God built Birds
[55:36] to praise the Lord he built every animal
[55:40] to praise the
[55:41] Lord he said everything that hath breath
[55:45] praise ye the
[55:50] Lord and let me just say when a church
[55:53] decides I don't we don't need that no
[55:54] more that church dies
[55:58] oh but brother Ron we're too educated we
[56:00] are too high we have went past all that
[56:02] you're
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:07] dead need to quote anything without
[56:13] emotion anything without emotion is dead
[56:18] and needs to be bured that's
[56:23] right brother Ron but that's just
[56:25] Pentecostal yes
[56:27] from Acts chapter
[56:30] 2 not from the early
[56:33] 1900s but from Acts chapter 2 am there
[56:37] was life in in end there'll be life
[56:39] until the
[56:42] end listen God started his church the
[56:45] way he wanted it he'll end his church
[56:48] the way he started
[56:54] it to reject re worship under the shed
[56:58] blood is to reject
[57:02] life Adam and the Gard of
[57:08] Eden he he didn't get
[57:11] blood but he went in and covered
[57:14] himself brother brandham said religion
[57:17] he covered himself with
[57:19] religion he went and got leaves and
[57:22] covered himself now let's just think
[57:24] about this when Adam
[57:27] fell God came
[57:31] running God came running through the
[57:35] garden running now let's just think when
[57:39] the angels in heaven that part of the
[57:42] angels in heaven follow Lucifer's
[57:45] message under the sin of I will exalt
[57:49] myself you watch people when they want
[57:52] to exalt their will above the will of
[57:55] God
[57:57] you're headed in the wrong
[57:59] direction Paul said I am a prisoner of
[58:03] Jesus
[58:06] Christ listen when that group of angels
[58:09] fell and the war in heaven took place it
[58:12] never moved
[58:16] God but when one son of God
[58:20] fell God came
[58:24] running God came running through the
[58:27] garden screaming Adam where are
[58:35] you that's how important you are to
[58:37] God brother BR said if you were the only
[58:40] one he would have came for
[58:42] you so don't let the devil whisper in
[58:45] your ear that you're not
[58:50] important you might as well go ahead and
[58:52] clap your hands right there
[59:01] sped all through the Old Testament let
[59:03] me just take just a moment to go here it
[59:05] was Abel that offered a
[59:08] sacrifice when Cain offered all of his
[59:12] on the on his on his altar offered all
[59:16] of his
[59:17] works and offered all of his fruit and
[59:21] offered to God and it was a beautiful
[59:24] altar because remember who his father
[59:27] was it was a beautiful offer of worship
[59:31] but K with a little rope around the
[59:35] Lamb's neck pulled it up on that
[59:38] rock and begin to take a sharp Rock and
[59:42] take that that animal's life and it was
[59:45] bleeding and its life was going out of
[59:48] it whose altar that God
[59:54] accept who's alar did God accept brother
[59:58] Ron but they got a huge church and all
[1:00:00] their altars are full of gold on who
[1:00:04] altar did God accept it was the shed
[1:00:10] blood when Adam and Eve walked out of
[1:00:12] the garden it was a shed
[1:00:20] blood oh brother Ron that's brutal
[1:00:24] that's horrible listen it it's not not
[1:00:26] for
[1:00:28] Peter listen we're not trying to we're
[1:00:31] not trying to trying to be a social like
[1:00:34] here we're wanting to get to God not
[1:00:37] some social
[1:00:38] program we're wanting to worship God the
[1:00:41] way he wants to be
[1:00:44] worshiped it was blood for
[1:00:48] Abel it was blood for
[1:00:51] Abraham we have wood we have fire but
[1:00:54] where is the altar
[1:00:56] and he said
[1:00:58] God will provide
[1:01:01] himself a
[1:01:03] sacrifice and remember what he told the
[1:01:06] others he said Isaac and I will
[1:01:11] return he knew if I had to take his life
[1:01:14] got to raise him back up
[1:01:17] again why was he so assured because the
[1:01:20] king had told him at his tent
[1:01:26] he had told him at his 10 thy seed shall
[1:01:29] possess the Gate of their
[1:01:31] eny it wasn't going to be just for Isaac
[1:01:35] but it was going to be generation after
[1:01:37] generation still going on
[1:01:41] today listen God is as good as he word
[1:01:43] if he requires his life and it's an
[1:01:45] ultimate sacrifice why was God asking
[1:01:48] him that because God was going to do it
[1:01:52] himself he was going to give his own son
[1:01:55] he was going to do it
[1:01:59] himself he said I got power to lay my
[1:02:01] life down and power to take it up again
[1:02:05] look through history nobody ever said it
[1:02:08] and did
[1:02:13] it trying to
[1:02:15] behave and Abraham called the place
[1:02:18] Jehovah
[1:02:20] Gyra what a
[1:02:22] place
[1:02:24] Moses
[1:02:26] required Abraham's children wound up in
[1:02:31] in Egypt 400
[1:02:34] years
[1:02:36] Joseph no doubt could tell the stories
[1:02:39] about Abraham and that
[1:02:44] sacrifice the promises that they would
[1:02:46] be
[1:02:47] under Jacob no doubt had shared those
[1:02:50] stories those Brethren nobody out shared
[1:02:53] the stories think about it about 70
[1:02:57] people in a family became over two
[1:03:04] million pretty incredible isn't it it
[1:03:07] was a family of
[1:03:09] Believers now I want you to understand
[1:03:11] when it came down to they were going to
[1:03:14] leave the
[1:03:15] land and God required
[1:03:21] blood he required Blood on the door
[1:03:25] poost
[1:03:27] right he required blood from their
[1:03:31] household he required their perfect lamb
[1:03:35] that's
[1:03:36] right it had to be without spot or
[1:03:40] without a
[1:03:41] blemish and you had to take it and tight
[1:03:44] for three days let me just say this you
[1:03:47] you had to search it over right not a
[1:03:50] blood or blemish or anything on it
[1:03:52] that's right and then had to take its
[1:03:55] life life and place the blood of that
[1:03:58] animal over the
[1:04:03] doorpost now listen don't substitute it

[1:08:56] book written and with within and on the
[1:08:58] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[1:09:00] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:09:02] loud voice voice who is

[1:10:21] adulter became an adulter and then had
[1:10:25] him
[1:10:26] murdered the blood was on David's hands
[1:10:30] and as great a man as he was he couldn't
[1:10:33] even pay the
[1:10:35] price for his own
[1:10:40] sins what about Elijah what about Elijah
[1:10:43] brother Ron Brother BR said he had a
[1:10:46] temper brother Brandon said he was Moody

[1:11:43] me just tell you about the blood Solomon
[1:11:45] built the temple and when he got done
[1:11:47] building the Temple I preached to Andrew
[1:11:49] and the boys yesterday listen when he
[1:11:50] got done building the Temple he offered
[1:11:54] 22,00 ,000
[1:11:56] oxen you think about the sheer volume of
[1:12:00] 22,000 oxen as a
[1:12:03] sacrifice I'll be honest with you I'd
[1:12:06] hated to operate the meat processing
[1:12:10] facility that's nothing compared to the
[1:12:15] 120,000
[1:12:21] sheep you imagine what that value was
[1:12:25] we're talking about
[1:12:27] millions millions of dollars Untold

[1:13:39] a life on the inside of
[1:13:41] you and for you that experienced it you
[1:13:44] come into that presence one
[1:13:51] time now let me say for some of you you

[1:15:02] Isaiah
[1:15:03] 53 he is despised and re rejected of men
[1:15:09] a Man of
[1:15:12] Sorrows God became
[1:15:16] man remember brother R said now in that
[1:15:19] Pillar of
[1:15:20] Fire he couldn't understand what you was
[1:15:23] feeling
[1:15:30] that's
[1:15:31] incredible it's incredible the prophet
[1:15:33] could use and state say it like
[1:15:36] that brother Ron I don't
[1:15:40] understand I'm I'm GNA just bring it to
[1:15:42] a level to where we can all
[1:15:46] understand all of us don't want to hear
[1:15:49] the word
[1:15:53] cancer when we're setting in doctor's
[1:15:55] office none of us want to hear
[1:15:59] that but when you get acquainted with
[1:16:03] it and all of a sudden the doctor says
[1:16:07] you got stage one
[1:16:09] cancer you know what brother Ron's been
[1:16:14] fighting almost
[1:16:17] immediately there comes a spirit with
[1:16:19] that
[1:16:21] thing and the life comes alive in that
[1:16:23] deal but let me let me just say this to
[1:16:25] you there is a
[1:16:29] blood I thank God for doctors and I
[1:16:31] thank God I've been fighting chemo with
[1:16:33] chemo for five years but there is a
[1:16:38] blood there is a blood
[1:16:41] stronger than any
[1:16:45] chemo and I take it in the name of Jesus
[1:16:49] Christ I thank God for doctors I thank
[1:16:52] God but listen once you fall under that
[1:16:56] same thing you're
[1:17:00] acquainted with one another's
[1:17:08] fight notice what he's
[1:17:12] saying a Man of
[1:17:15] Sorrows and acquainted with
[1:17:19] grief as we hid our faces from
[1:17:22] him he was despised
[1:17:26] and we esteemed him
[1:17:28] not sure he he has borne our
[1:17:32] griefs and carried our
[1:17:36] sorrows David didn't do
[1:17:39] that Abraham didn't do
[1:17:41] that follow me I know I'm simple job
[1:17:45] didn't do
[1:17:46] that but this Messiah this
[1:17:51] Jesus can identify with every situation
[1:17:56] listen every one of us in this
[1:17:58] building's got a different
[1:18:01] story every one of us in this building
[1:18:04] has a history
[1:18:07] book are you with me you don't even want
[1:18:09] your children to know about your history
[1:18:12] book there's nothing about Sin that we
[1:18:15] brag about but God who's rich in
[1:18:22] Mercy I caught something right there
[1:18:25] well brother Ron I never did anything
[1:18:26] out in sin what about your
[1:18:30] thoughts that speak louder in heaven
[1:18:33] than your words do on Earth you don't
[1:18:36] want even your neighbor sitting beside
[1:18:38] of you or your husband or your wife come
[1:18:42] on don't tell
[1:18:43] me come on don't tell
[1:18:50] me he hath borne our griefs and carried
[1:18:53] our sorrows
[1:18:55] and yet we did esteem him stricken and
[1:18:57] smitten of God and Afflicted this next
[1:18:59] scripture let's read it together but he
[1:19:02] was wounded for our
[1:19:04] transgressions and he was bruised for
[1:19:07] our iniquity the chastisement of our
[1:19:10] peace was upon him and with his
[1:19:13] stripes we are
[1:19:20] healed counting rosary beads will not do
[1:19:23] it
[1:19:25] lighting a candle will not do it
[1:19:29] becoming a social member of some social
[1:19:31] club will not do it signing every book
[1:19:36] will not do it having a perfect
[1:19:39] attendance at church will not do it have
[1:19:42] a cross hung around your neck will not
[1:19:44] do
[1:19:47] it I find it amazing that our political
[1:19:51] leaders will become religious
[1:19:55] am will become religious all of a sudden
[1:19:59] because it's it's socially correct
[1:20:05] now our president has become
[1:20:08] religious but if you want to know how
[1:20:10] religious is watch him at the
[1:20:12] inauguration he don't bow his head he
[1:20:16] don't close his
[1:20:19] eyes now listen I know you don't have to
[1:20:21] bow your head and close your eyes at
[1:20:22] every prayer he don't know how
[1:20:29] pray and they may call him the Messiah
[1:20:31] if he gets all our debt taking place and
[1:20:33] gets peace to the world somebody's going
[1:20:35] to fulfill the tribulation
[1:20:38] period somebody's going to do the
[1:20:41] job but I'm not looking to Donald Trump
[1:20:44] as my redeemer
[1:20:46] [Applause]
[1:20:56] but brother Ronnie's doing what he said
[1:20:58] he would do yeah but I got a God that
[1:21:01] says has filled us with a Bible and he
[1:21:03] does everything that he says he will do
[1:21:07] he said he would heal me and he does he
[1:21:10] tells me he'll save me and he
[1:21:13] has tells me that he'll put angels of
[1:21:16] guard for my children and watch over
[1:21:18] them said it would bless my
[1:21:22] family come on you might as well praise
[1:21:24] the Lord get under
[1:21:43] it there is no remission of sins outside
[1:21:46] of the
[1:21:49] blood this message is the bleeding word
[1:21:52] of the hour and God's light is in this
[1:21:55] message that's right it's proven all
[1:21:58] over the world every country it's proven
[1:22:00] all over the world there's no Holy Ghost
[1:22:03] for America and a different Holy Ghost
[1:22:05] for Russia right there's not a different
[1:22:08] holy ghost in China right I've met those
[1:22:11] brothers and sisters in China and they
[1:22:13] have the same Holy Ghost that's inside
[1:22:16] listen it just it just radiates out of
[1:22:19] their
[1:22:20] life it radiates out of your life you
[1:22:23] don't have to put it on
[1:22:25] you don't have to act it
[1:22:27] on it just radiates it's a life on the
[1:22:31] inside like a du that just radiates out
[1:22:34] of their
[1:22:37] life this is no social learn

[1:35:00] passed and on down into the lowest parts
[1:35:03] of hell he went and he knocked at the Su
[1:35:06] door of the devil's hell and the devil

[1:35:50] wet on the
[1:35:52] cross I paid the

[1:36:40] me for
[1:36:42] you why did you do that sister Connie so
[1:36:46] you wouldn't have to
[1:36:48] go because under no listen if you was
[1:36:52] born a 10 billionaire
[1:36:54] and you had degrees all over when you
[1:36:57] were born you were born in
[1:36:59] sin and without God paying a price for
[1:37:02] you let me just say we have no
[1:37:06] chance
[1:37:10] amen listen listen
[1:37:12] folks let me just say this to you
[1:37:15] there's only two
[1:37:20] places there's only two places
[1:37:26] and one I am not predestinated to go
[1:37:31] to listen Jesus just didn't die on a
[1:37:34] cross to pay the blood 2,000 years
[1:37:37] ago you was predestinated before the
[1:37:40] foundation of the world stay with me you
[1:37:44] was predestinated before the foundation
[1:37:47] before any of your forefathers was born
[1:37:49] in sin God predestinated you to eternal
[1:37:53] life
[1:37:56] and listen furthermore Jesus died on the
[1:38:00] cross before there was any molecule ever
[1:38:06] created why did he do
[1:38:08] that
[1:38:14] you he died in the mind of God before
[1:38:18] the foundation of the world
[1:38:24] I can hear him say strengthen himself
[1:38:27] Satan I'm the Virgin born son of the
[1:38:30] Living God my blood is still wet on the
[1:38:33] cross I paid the price I've conquered
[1:38:36] and I've come down to take over strip
[1:38:39] you of everything that you claimed that
[1:38:40] you had and he reached over on his side
[1:38:44] and jerked the keys of death hell and
[1:38:46] the grave off of him and he kicked back
[1:38:49] into the place where he belonged he
[1:38:52] conquered hell amen and when he arose he
[1:38:55] had the keys of death hell hanging on
[1:38:58] his
[1:39:00] side so what's the church scared about
[1:39:04] he conquered
[1:39:06] Satan he conquered sickness he conquered
