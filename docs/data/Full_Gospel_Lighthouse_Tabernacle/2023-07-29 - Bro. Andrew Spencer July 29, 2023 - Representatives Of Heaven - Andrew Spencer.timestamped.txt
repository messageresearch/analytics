[36:40] able to express to our family and to our
[36:43] children father and the only reason that

[36:55] Lord what a privilege it is to know you
[36:57] in the power of your Resurrection father

[37:57] that by the preaching of the word that

[38:03] Peter spoke one time that the Holy Ghost
[38:05] fell he didn't lay hands on anybody he
[38:08] didn't have a prayer line he didn't have
[38:10] an altar call but while he spoke those
[38:12] words

[38:17] special Miracles can take place father
[38:19] needs in our bodies things in our mind

[39:33] the Gospel of John chapter 3 and verse
[39:35] 1.
[39:57] amen John chapter 3 and verse 1 and
[40:00] there was a man of the Pharisee
[40:03] Nicodemus name Nicodemus a ruler of the

[40:10] said unto him Rabbi we know that thou
[40:13] art a teacher come from God
[40:16] for no man can do these Miracles that
[40:18] thou doest except God be with him now
[40:21] notice the the scene that is set before
[40:23] us here is a a ruler of the Jews it's
[40:26] not just not just one of the boys but
[40:28] this is a ruler of the Jews he's got a
[40:30] hierarchy in his office and he comes to
[40:33] Jesus at night time because he
[40:35] recognized the authority that he has
[40:37] that he could easily lose his position
[40:40] by coming to one that does these
[40:43] Miracles there's a whole lot of talk
[40:45] about going around Jesus now he's
[40:46] already had his miracles that are
[40:48] transpiring in his life and people are
[40:50] beginning to get rumors are beginning to
[40:52] get stirred but here is somebody that is
[40:55] acquainted with the scripture but
[40:57] recognizes that there is some Authority
[40:59] that is behind this man Jesus for he
[41:02] said for no man can do these Miracles
[41:04] that thou doest except God be with him
[41:07] so we've got to give Nicodemus some
[41:08] credit here he recognizes God in the man
[41:11] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[41:14] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[41:16] man be born again he cannot see the
[41:19] kingdom of God and Nicodemus saith unto
[41:22] him how can a man be born when he is old
[41:24] can he enter into enter the second time
[41:27] into his mother's womb and be born can
[41:30] you imagine how absurd this sounds to
[41:32] Nicodemus this is a man that knows all
[41:34] the scriptures but he never read
[41:36] anything like this laying there
[41:38] and Jesus answered and said verily
[41:41] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[41:43] born of the water and of the spirit he
[41:45] cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[41:48] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[41:50] and that which is born of the spirit is
[41:52] Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee
[41:55] ye must be born again the wind bloweth
[41:59] where it listeth and thou heareth to the
[42:01] sound thereof but can't tell once it
[42:04] cometh and wither It Go of soul is
[42:06] everyone that is born of the spirit and
[42:09] Nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[42:12] can these things be and Jesus answered
[42:15] and said unto him art thou a master of
[42:17] Israel and Noah's not these things
[42:19] verily verily I say unto thee we speak
[42:22] that we do know and testify that what we
[42:25] have seen and ye receive not our witness
[42:29] if I have told you Earthly things and
[42:32] you believe not how shall you believe if
[42:35] I tell you of heavenly things may God
[42:38] bless his word he may be seated here in
[42:40] the presence of the Lord and we we would
[42:43] like to just speak to you just for a few
[42:45] moments tonight on Representatives
[42:48] representatives of Heaven
[42:49] representatives of heaven and we all
[42:52] know what it's like to stand into the
[42:53] face of the wind and feel feel the
[42:56] effects of the wind and it doesn't take
[42:57] it doesn't take long for you to
[42:59] recognize when the wind is blowing
[43:01] especially when we've got heat like
[43:03] we've been having for the past few days
[43:04] but we recognize that that we need a
[43:07] cool breeze to blow across our lives to
[43:09] cool us off in the In the Heat of the
[43:11] day but it's like it's like this it's
[43:13] it's like somebody telling you that
[43:15] there's that there's heat out there and
[43:17] how hot it is but yet they haven't
[43:19] stepped outside at all to tell you how
[43:22] hot it is they've never felt the effects
[43:24] of it but here Jesus Is Telling
[43:26] Nicodemus I have felt the effects and
[43:29] the reason that you are seeing these
[43:30] things is because the effects of who I
[43:33] am is being transpired upon the needs
[43:36] that you're seeing and here Jesus begins
[43:38] to talk to him about about a birth a
[43:41] birth that Nicodemus does and understand
[43:43] because he isn't he isn't fully
[43:45] capturing what Jesus is speaking about
[43:47] and here he tells him he said unless you
[43:49] be born again you cannot understand you
[43:52] cannot see the very kingdom of God you
[43:54] sow you see it matters where your birth
[43:57] from so if it didn't matter then Jesus
[43:59] if this didn't matter at all Jesus would
[44:01] have never started out his Doctrine with
[44:04] this but this is the keynote doctrine of
[44:07] all that Jesus came and preached because
[44:09] if you are not born again you cannot
[44:11] understand the things that Jesus is
[44:14] going The Parables that he's getting
[44:15] ready to break down through throughout
[44:17] all of his ministry if you don't have
[44:19] this key Ministry or this key Doctrine
[44:21] down you're not going to understand what
[44:24] Jesus is preaching about now notice that
[44:26] the Bible said in second Corinthians 3
[44:28] and 2 that you are you are our Epistles
[44:32] Written In Hearts known and read of all
[44:35] men for as much as you are manifestly
[44:37] declared to be in Epistle of Christ
[44:40] ministered by US Written not with ink
[44:43] but with the spirit of the Living God
[44:45] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[44:48] tables of the heart now notice what
[44:50] brother Bynum says here in the message
[44:52] influence he said then we never know
[44:55] just what we're doing what influence
[44:57] what we're doing it's is having upon
[45:00] others the Bible said we are written
[45:02] Epistles read of all men he said that is
[45:04] your life reads so loud to the public
[45:06] until your testimony if it's contrary to
[45:09] the life it's without any effect it's
[45:11] what you are inside of you that people
[45:14] read
[45:15] not so much what you say but what you
[45:18] are see you can pin something on
[45:20] somebody and say this that and so forth
[45:22] but your life being different from what
[45:24] they say your testimony of your life is
[45:27] louder than the testimony that someone
[45:29] could say something about you yeah so so
[45:32] just keep that on mind that that on your
[45:35] mind that we're bringing influences
[45:37] every day and the life that you live
[45:39] prove proves what's on the inside of you
[45:42] you cannot change that it reflects every
[45:45] person reflects outside what he is
[45:48] inside and if we take the testimony of
[45:50] being a Christian and I think that is
[45:52] one of the most solemn things that a man
[45:55] or a woman or a boy or girl could do or
[45:58] would when he takes on the name of
[46:00] Christ that he's going to be a
[46:02] representative of Christ that you should
[46:04] watch every move you make because
[46:07] somebody is watching you it's the most
[46:11] solemn thing that you can do is to take
[46:14] on the name of the Lord because you are
[46:16] then being a representative of our Lord
[46:19] Jesus Christ so it is the most solemn
[46:22] thing that you can do here is a prophet
[46:23] of the age saying to us the most solemn
[46:26] thing that you can do is take on the
[46:28] name of the Lord and when you take it on
[46:30] watch every move that you make because
[46:32] somebody is watching you you may be here
[46:35] tonight the only Bible that every
[46:37] anybody will ever read out there and lay
[46:40] ought to see anymore because they have
[46:41] not read their Bibles you are a walking
[46:43] testimony of what the Bible says
[46:46] there'll be a lot of people that never
[46:47] listen to William Branham but they see
[46:49] the message of the hour working on your
[46:52] life because something happened on the
[46:54] inside so it expresses on the outside of
[46:58] what the message is you don't have to
[46:59] preach them a sermon just leave them a
[47:02] sermon I have found in my Ministry and
[47:04] throughout my life you ain't got to give
[47:06] them 17 tapes and you ain't got to give
[47:08] them all these tracks you just live on
[47:10] the message
[47:11] it's the best witness that there ever
[47:13] has been and there is no greater witness
[47:16] or no greater advertising than word of
[47:19] mouth and when you begin to testify
[47:22] without saying one word how great Jesus
[47:24] is it is the most powerful testimony
[47:27] that there can be
[47:29] now I'm not saying that there aren't
[47:31] things that you can't hand out and
[47:33] there'll be a blessing to people but
[47:34] your life is the most powerful testimony
[47:38] that there is now this word
[47:40] representative it means to exhibit
[47:42] exhibit a similitude or bearing the
[47:45] character or power of another so it is
[47:49] as a council is representative of the
[47:52] people so it's like it's you that you
[47:54] that have factory work or you that work
[47:56] for different companies that company
[47:58] that has hired you a people that worked
[48:01] for that company it speaks of the
[48:03] Integrity of that company or the place
[48:06] that you work for or the business that
[48:08] you work for you see if you see people
[48:10] that are working for such and such type
[48:12] of a law firm or a different Factory you
[48:15] see what kind of people that that
[48:17] company is after you see a company
[48:19] that's hiring all all Burly men you can
[48:21] understand that there is there's some
[48:23] hard labor that's behind it but if you
[48:25] see a company that's just hiring anybody
[48:27] because they need to fulfill positions
[48:29] and maybe it's like a fast food
[48:31] restaurant by the name of McDonald's
[48:32] they're just hiring anybody and
[48:34] everybody because they know that it's
[48:35] just to feel in position and they know
[48:38] they won't be there long so they just
[48:39] want somebody there they don't need a
[48:41] whole lot of brains down there to work
[48:43] at McDonald's and I'm not talking about
[48:44] anybody that works down there at
[48:45] McDonald's I don't know how McDonald's
[48:47] always makes it into my repertoire but
[48:49] it does somehow but anyways but
[48:51] McDonald's is looking for somebody that
[48:53] that can just feel the position but if
[48:55] you look at a place of business or it
[48:57] doesn't have to be McDonald's could be
[48:59] anywhere it could be Walmart or anywhere
[49:01] else but you see a company that is
[49:03] hiring out all kinds of people that are
[49:06] maybe just maybe not high in regard
[49:09] maybe not this that or the other maybe
[49:11] not somebody that has intellects you can
[49:13] tell what kind of company that that
[49:16] you're working for by the position that
[49:18] they're wanting to feel but you see a
[49:20] company that has high regards they've
[49:23] got high standards they're looking for
[49:24] these qualities or or they're looking
[49:26] for this characteristic in this one or
[49:28] they're looking for maybe maybe somebody
[49:30] of a stature that has an intellect or
[49:32] been to college they're looking for
[49:34] certain things in the people that
[49:36] they're going to employ because you see
[49:39] the people that work for the company no
[49:41] matter what the name is it testifies of
[49:44] the company's status it testifies of its
[49:47] of its statement of faith when you hire
[49:49] out when you hire out somebody they're
[49:52] looking for somebody that can carry on
[49:54] the same statement of faith that they
[49:56] believe in they've got to process
[49:57] they've got things that they believe in
[49:59] they got their they've got their
[50:01] qualities of what they're looking for
[50:02] and when they can find somebody that
[50:05] they can hire and put into that position
[50:06] that they are they recognize that they
[50:09] will represent the company in good times
[50:11] and in bad times in slow times and in
[50:14] busy times that this person has the
[50:17] character that we are looking for to be
[50:19] a representative of a company and the
[50:22] higher that you go in the in the pyramid
[50:24] at the higher that you go there are
[50:26] there are less spots up there
[50:28] there there are certain jobs that
[50:30] there's all kinds of people that can
[50:32] work on those jobs but there is only a
[50:34] certain tier of workplaces that allow
[50:37] that there is only a select people that
[50:40] have certain degrees have certain
[50:42] attributes about them that can be hired
[50:44] and then that company spends so much
[50:47] time looking over those individuals
[50:49] looking over their life and looking over
[50:50] where they came from they they look at
[50:52] their family history they they look at
[50:54] their where they went to school at
[50:55] because they're looking for somebody
[50:57] that's got some class to them
[51:00] is that right because they want somebody
[51:02] that can represent their company if
[51:05] they're not there they want somebody
[51:06] that can step in and be a feeling and
[51:09] can have the same mindset as the boss
[51:11] does because they are looking for
[51:14] somebody that can be a representative of
[51:15] the company and when somebody recognizes
[51:18] that or they see that power or that
[51:20] quality in that individual the company
[51:23] can put put all of its power all of its
[51:26] Authority behind that employee because
[51:28] it represents who they are as a company
[51:31] don't you recognize that Jesus has not
[51:34] just chosen anybody but he's chosen the
[51:37] elect of almighty God that he can put
[51:39] his power in that he can put them and
[51:42] make them sons and they know what he
[51:44] wants done with the word
[51:46] you see he's not just pulling anybody
[51:48] off the street he's pulling his elect
[51:52] now that word that word of is a very
[51:55] powerful very powerful word it's real
[51:57] short but it's real powerful
[51:59] it word that word means from or out of
[52:03] it means to proceed from The Source or
[52:06] the author or the agent that is
[52:08] bestowing that is bestowing it it also
[52:11] means to denote property or possession
[52:14] just like when Paul would say in First
[52:16] Corinthians 11 and 23 that I have
[52:19] received of the Lord that which also I
[52:22] delivered of you so Paul is saying to us
[52:25] that the Revelation that I have received
[52:27] that I delivered to you I got this from
[52:30] The Source the source is the Lord so I
[52:33] could not deliver these Revelations
[52:34] unless the Lord had delivered them to me
[52:37] these Revelations that I'm giving unto
[52:39] you they are of they're from The Source
[52:42] the property owner is the Lord notice
[52:45] what Jeremiah would say in Lamentations
[52:47] 3 and 22 that it is of the Lord's
[52:51] mercies that we are not consumed because
[52:53] his compassions fail not you see the
[52:56] reason why there is a mercy is because
[52:58] it's of the Lord
[53:00] it doesn't matter what you're being in
[53:01] it doesn't matter what you go through it
[53:04] doesn't matter where you are if you
[53:05] receive Mercy you received it of the
[53:09] Lord the source of the Revelation is the
[53:12] Lord
[53:13] ain't that powerful ain't that powerful
[53:16] to know that you didn't get your power
[53:17] from yourself but you got it of the Lord
[53:20] ain't that wonderful to know that
[53:22] tonight that the revelations that you
[53:24] received you didn't get them from some
[53:26] man you got them of the Lord
[53:29] when you remember when Gideon's out
[53:30] there and he's out there hiding back
[53:32] there in his threshing wheat back there
[53:34] at a certain spot and he's hiding from
[53:36] the midianites that have come in there
[53:37] and there came an angel of the Lord and
[53:39] began to speak to him and tell him that
[53:42] you're a mighty man of our so he didn't
[53:44] Jared Gideon didn't even recognize that
[53:47] Valor was on the inside of him
[53:49] but there that angel had to tell him
[53:52] that you are a representative of Valor
[53:56] it didn't even recognize that that was
[53:58] there but this Revelation that the angel
[54:01] was given to get in was of the Lord
[54:05] there are certain things laying in your
[54:07] life that you don't know what you you
[54:09] don't know exactly what you're going to
[54:11] express in life you don't know exactly
[54:13] what you're going to be in life but
[54:15] because the Lord seen something in you
[54:17] that was of himself
[54:20] he allows you to be a representative of
[54:23] almighty God you remember when Gideon's
[54:25] out there and he's he's got his numbers
[54:27] and they're going against the midianite
[54:28] Army he's got 30 000 people there and
[54:31] God said there's too many for him and he
[54:33] goes down and he numbs them down he he
[54:36] comes down and he cuts out the cuts out
[54:39] the crowd he goes down to 12 000 people
[54:41] and then he comes down to 300 men
[54:43] because 12 000 men are setting up there
[54:47] and they're drinking water from the
[54:49] brook and what did they do what did they
[54:52] do they bent down and bowed their face
[54:55] they bowed their face before the water
[54:58] it proved what was on the inside of
[55:01] those men
[55:03] because they got down and they didn't
[55:05] look they didn't look at the Horizon but
[55:08] they had been worshipers of Baal and
[55:10] they were going down and they were
[55:11] sticking their face in the water and
[55:13] they were laughing at the water but
[55:15] those 300 men that was going to be with
[55:18] Gideon they had never bowed down to bail
[55:20] before him so they stood there they had
[55:23] their eyes on the horizon they looked
[55:26] down and got water in their hand and put
[55:28] it to their mouth this was a sign or a
[55:30] representation that they had been
[55:32] worshiping the true God
[55:35] you see it matters how you worship
[55:38] it matters how you worship you see if
[55:41] you're going to worship like kora's
[55:43] group you're going to go out there and
[55:45] worship a golden calf think you're
[55:46] worshiping God but if you're worshiping
[55:49] like Moses and Joshua
[55:51] you're going to worship the only true
[55:53] and living God but these men had been
[55:56] bowing down to Baal
[55:58] it showed it showed where they were from
[56:03] now notice notice what brother Branham
[56:06] said here in the thyroid Church age he
[56:08] said God looketh on the heart he said
[56:10] that has never changed
[56:14] ain't that powerful
[56:15] that has never changed and never will it
[56:18] change
[56:22] ain't you glad God didn't look at you
[56:24] the way you were
[56:26] before you got your change
[56:29] God looks on the heart that has never
[56:32] changed never will it change notice what
[56:35] the Bible said in second Timothy 2 and
[56:37] 19 that the Lord that searcheth the
[56:40] Reigns that word search means to track
[56:42] or to follow up he brother random said
[56:45] God tracks down our thoughts
[56:47] I Reigns at the search means to track
[56:50] down Reigns means our thoughts he knows
[56:53] what is in our heart he sees our works
[56:56] which are definitely a definite
[56:58] manifestation of what lies within us it
[57:00] is of the heart that precedes either
[57:02] righteousness or wickedness our motives
[57:05] our purpose are all known unto him as he
[57:08] watches every action now you remember
[57:10] what the angel said to brother Brandon
[57:12] he said that your thoughts are louder in
[57:15] heaven than your voice is here on Earth
[57:17] so it's a very powerful thing what's
[57:20] passing through your mind
[57:23] come on somebody so our motives ought to
[57:25] be on Christ Our objectives ought to be
[57:28] on Christ our conduct ought to always
[57:30] should and present Christ our language
[57:32] should spring we should speak of Christ
[57:34] our actions should prove Christ because
[57:38] we should always be thinking Upon Our
[57:41] Lord Jesus Christ
[57:43] because if we are representative of the
[57:46] one that hung on the cross we want to do
[57:48] it with everything
[57:49] that's within us you remember when
[57:51] William Branham comes and he preaches
[57:53] future home he takes the first portion
[57:56] of the first portion of future home and
[57:58] what does he do for the first 30 to 40
[58:00] minutes he speaks about the character of
[58:03] the people at the meeting
[58:05] what is William random getting ready to
[58:08] break into of the future home of the
[58:10] Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[58:12] bride he's telling us that there's going
[58:15] to be a character in a people
[58:17] that testifies here on Earth of what God
[58:20] has saw in the heavens
[58:23] come on somebody if this message ain't
[58:25] worth living here it ain't worth living
[58:27] there
[58:28] but if it's worth living there it's
[58:30] worth living here
[58:33] is that right
[58:36] but notice now that that's why I notice
[58:39] that's why Jesus spoke to Nicodemus and
[58:41] said you got to be born again you see
[58:44] when he was talking to Jesus about
[58:46] miracles and and the power that Jesus
[58:48] had here's Nicodemus he's got questions
[58:51] he's got Earnest questions some sincere
[58:53] questions he wasn't just coming to him
[58:55] because but he's got some real questions
[58:57] but Jesus didn't waste any time on
[59:00] Nicodemus he took him to the heart of
[59:02] the matter he said if you want to know
[59:03] how these Miracles and this power is
[59:05] done you've got to be born to my type of
[59:07] thinking you've got to be changed You
[59:10] Gotta Die to yourself Nicodemus
[59:13] here's this man here's this man and he's
[59:16] trying to learn of these Heavenly things
[59:19] but he can't learn of them because he's
[59:21] Earthly in his mindset Earthly in his
[59:24] nature you remember what the angel said
[59:26] you can't teach Pentecostal babies
[59:28] Supernatural things so what you're
[59:31] looking at is a people that are
[59:33] Pentecostal babies like a Nicodemus and
[59:35] couldn't go so far he still got to Jesus
[59:38] but it didn't go all the way
[59:40] Judas was in the circle but he didn't go
[59:43] all the way what was lack in Pentecost
[59:47] come on somebody what was offered to
[59:49] Nicodemus is offered to everyone sitting
[59:52] here tonight
[59:56] notice
[59:57] well the man said that this age that
[59:58] we're living in is reaching for
[1:00:00] something he said but they can't find it
[1:00:02] he said the hospitals are full of
[1:00:04] dissatisfied people the insane
[1:00:06] institutions are overrun dissatisfied he
[1:00:08] said they don't know what to do they
[1:00:11] seem to be something that they're
[1:00:12] reaching for but they never can come to
[1:00:14] it what is it
[1:00:16] what makes a man drinking smoke and do
[1:00:18] all those things it's because he's
[1:00:20] trying to satisfy you first that God put
[1:00:23] on the inside of him but you see what
[1:00:25] the devil has done he's presented a
[1:00:27] power or he's presented another way to
[1:00:29] quench his thirst but it never will
[1:00:31] quench his thirst
[1:00:33] now notice what William Branham says in
[1:00:35] enticing Spirits he said a man got
[1:00:37] demon-possessed one time stripped his
[1:00:39] clothes off he said they couldn't put
[1:00:41] clothes on him he said do you see what I
[1:00:43] mean it's enticing Spirits your church
[1:00:46] puts up with it your preachers are ready
[1:00:48] to say anything about it you won't pay
[1:00:50] or you won't pay your tithes anymore he
[1:00:52] said that's the reason he said that's
[1:00:54] the trouble he said my goodness how are
[1:00:57] you going to preach to a bunch of
[1:00:58] buzzards lest you get them converted
[1:01:00] right and be too with God to begin with
[1:01:02] they'll root their nose in dead stuff
[1:01:04] all the time what you need is a dumping
[1:01:07] out an old-fashioned Revival sweet from
[1:01:10] coast to coast to get men and women
[1:01:11] right with God he said let loose are the
[1:01:14] things of the world let loose of petty
[1:01:16] soft pedal preaching amen preach the
[1:01:18] gospel God said so he said if you love
[1:01:20] the world or the things of the world the
[1:01:22] love of God's not even easy even in you
[1:01:24] now notice he said people can jump up
[1:01:27] and down Shadow All Night Long speak in
[1:01:29] tongues like porn Peas on a dry cowhide
[1:01:31] walk right out the next morning with
[1:01:34] enough Timber to fight a bus haul go
[1:01:36] right on out and tell somebody in the
[1:01:37] church something and cause a whole
[1:01:39] church to be broke up it's nothing in
[1:01:41] the world but enticing demon spirits
[1:01:45] so we don't want some carnal
[1:01:47] impersonation here
[1:01:49] we want the real genuine holy ghost that
[1:01:53] was poured out on the day of Pentecost
[1:01:56] now William Bonham you know William
[1:01:57] Bradham preached three kinds of
[1:01:59] Believers and he said he said your
[1:02:01] present attitude shows what class you're
[1:02:03] in you just take the word test to them
[1:02:06] and you'll find out what kind of person
[1:02:08] that there is now I know there's a whole
[1:02:10] lot of people that are I'd rather a
[1:02:11] whole lot deal with unbelievers than to
[1:02:13] deal with make-believers because you
[1:02:15] know where he's stand with an unbeliever
[1:02:16] but with a make-believer they'll stab
[1:02:18] you in the back you never know what
[1:02:20] they're coming with
[1:02:21] but a real believer you can test them
[1:02:23] out put them on the word and they'll
[1:02:25] come out every single time saying the
[1:02:27] same thing that the word says
[1:02:31] well you see you've got to have a change
[1:02:34] in your nature you notice this age that
[1:02:38] we're living in it's the age of the
[1:02:40] people's rights and we're living in an
[1:02:42] age where it boasts of self-confidence
[1:02:44] people got more confidence in themselves
[1:02:46] than they do in God what are they
[1:02:49] they're lovers of pleasure more than
[1:02:51] lovers of God but our goal our goal is
[1:02:55] to rely only upon almighty God to loose
[1:02:58] ourself and rely on his life to rely on
[1:03:01] his power to lead to leave all of our
[1:03:04] nine reasonings alone
[1:03:07] come on somebody you know what William
[1:03:09] Branham said when he was preaching what
[1:03:11] it takes to overcome he said he said
[1:03:13] when you watch The Life go out of a tree
[1:03:16] he said it rots twice as fast and
[1:03:19] whenever the life of Jesus Christ leaves
[1:03:21] your home leaves her family leaves her
[1:03:24] prayer life
[1:03:26] you are rotting where you're sitting at
[1:03:30] Hallelujah
[1:03:31] but if you can get to where the life is
[1:03:34] at
[1:03:35] come on somebody if you can get down
[1:03:37] there you remember them old pump handles
[1:03:39] them all pump handles they used to sit
[1:03:42] out there on top of that whale head you
[1:03:43] had to pump them you had to Prime them a
[1:03:45] little bit so you had a little bit of
[1:03:46] water setting over here and you poured
[1:03:48] it down the pipe and you begin to Prime
[1:03:51] that thing what was it if you didn't
[1:03:52] have the water there you couldn't get no
[1:03:54] water out of the source but the word
[1:03:57] hallelujah the word is the source
[1:04:00] to get the watering of the word upon
[1:04:02] your soul and it might take a little
[1:04:04] priming it might take a preacher coming
[1:04:07] down there and preaching on the godhead
[1:04:08] preaching on this and preaching on that
[1:04:11] but all of a sudden it begins to bring
[1:04:13] up a spring up a whale of Life inside of
[1:04:15] your soul
[1:04:17] if you can get to where the life is
[1:04:20] you see it ain't about emotions
[1:04:23] it ain't about mental understanding it's
[1:04:25] about a change of nature a change of
[1:04:28] Duty you see our duty our duty is to
[1:04:31] empty out and die out but it's God's
[1:04:32] duty to impart his life on the inside of
[1:04:35] you the holy life that was inside of
[1:04:38] Jesus Zoe God's own life on the inside
[1:04:41] of you I'll tell you what you do when
[1:04:44] you have people when you have people
[1:04:46] that try to live a Christian Life
[1:04:50] when they try to live a Christian life
[1:04:52] and they can only get so far
[1:04:54] but brother random said that the new
[1:04:56] birth is far beyond good intentions
[1:04:59] the new birth Changes Everything About
[1:05:01] You
[1:05:02] it changes everything about you it
[1:05:04] changes your mind it changes your dress
[1:05:06] it changes everything about you that's
[1:05:09] the power of being born again but you
[1:05:12] see the road to hell is paved with good
[1:05:14] intentions
[1:05:16] I intended to go to church more I
[1:05:18] intended to pray more I intended to give
[1:05:20] my heart to the Lord but Jesus said
[1:05:22] except amen be born again he cannot see
[1:05:26] the kingdom of God he can't understand
[1:05:28] the very kingdom of God so you can have
[1:05:31] somebody try to tell you what the
[1:05:33] message is about
[1:05:35] and they don't get it it's because they
[1:05:37] don't have the understanding you ever
[1:05:39] looked at them pictures that that they
[1:05:41] got that you've got to look at them in a
[1:05:43] certain way you got to turn your head
[1:05:45] cross your eyes and Dot your t's and
[1:05:47] look in them things a player because
[1:05:49] there's a hidden image in there it
[1:05:51] always messes my eyes up to go looking
[1:05:52] at them things but if you can look at it
[1:05:54] with the right angle and you know how to
[1:05:57] do it you can see the hidden image in
[1:05:59] there
[1:05:59] and that's the reason why a lot of
[1:06:01] people can't understand the message is
[1:06:03] because they don't have the right
[1:06:04] looking glasses on they don't understand
[1:06:06] how to look at it
[1:06:08] but if you can only understand that what
[1:06:11] this message is is Jesus Christ the same
[1:06:14] yesterday today and forever
[1:06:17] come on somebody it depends on where
[1:06:20] your birth from so that you can
[1:06:22] understand the very Kingdom of almighty
[1:06:24] God
[1:06:26] see some people and they're constantly
[1:06:28] trying to live a little bit higher and
[1:06:30] they constantly live a double life
[1:06:32] they're trying with everything that's
[1:06:34] within them to live this message but
[1:06:36] they can't go all the way it's because
[1:06:38] they haven't fully surrendered
[1:06:40] but you see what you do when you
[1:06:42] surrender your life to almighty God God
[1:06:45] can put his blessings upon your life you
[1:06:47] say well I don't think I'm very much and
[1:06:48] I don't think that God can do anything
[1:06:50] with me but do you still want brother
[1:06:52] Andrew I feel like I'm so low in sin and
[1:06:54] I can't get myself out of it don't you
[1:06:56] recognize that that's where real gold
[1:06:58] comes from and real Jewels come from
[1:07:01] it's when you got to go to digging down
[1:07:03] in the dirt to get them out of and you
[1:07:04] might be in a hell hole all kinds of sin
[1:07:07] but that's where we'll go comes from
[1:07:11] and Jesus is hunting out some real gold
[1:07:14] some people that'll stand the test of
[1:07:16] time you can take every medal and break
[1:07:19] it down but gold will stand there
[1:07:22] you can't burn it out you can put us
[1:07:24] through the trials of life you can put
[1:07:26] us through the Pains of life but gold
[1:07:28] stands out the hotter that it gets
[1:07:34] I'm not very much brother Andrew that's
[1:07:36] all right when you when God puts you in
[1:07:38] his hands God's got blessings on top of
[1:07:40] blessings I don't know if I can live
[1:07:43] this life yes you can
[1:07:44] you take that little bitty boy that had
[1:07:46] had five loaves of bread and two little
[1:07:48] fishes what did he do he surrendered
[1:07:50] them to Jesus you see in his hands he
[1:07:54] could barely feed himself but in the
[1:07:55] hands of almighty God he could feed five
[1:07:58] thousand and you may not be able to
[1:08:00] impress anybody but put your life on the
[1:08:03] hands of almighty God and God will make
[1:08:06] a serpent bruise her out of your life a
[1:08:08] real genuine Overcomer
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:12] God wants somebody
[1:08:15] that he can put the tutor over top of
[1:08:17] and said they're just like the father
[1:08:20] they act like you they dress like you
[1:08:23] they handle themselves like you and what
[1:08:26] it means to the father
[1:08:28] when he can send his son out to work
[1:08:31] over a field or work over situations to
[1:08:33] work over this sick person and work over
[1:08:36] this need and pray over them how much it
[1:08:38] impresses the father that he can have
[1:08:41] such confidence in pornependent upon his
[1:08:44] children that they're going to act in
[1:08:46] his name
[1:08:47] it's powerful thing
[1:08:49] it's a powerful thing when you can
[1:08:51] recognize that the father is behind you
[1:08:54] you see that's why William Branham said
[1:08:56] when he's talking about that Pillar of
[1:08:58] Fire that was taken down there if you in
[1:09:00] Houston he said he didn't come because
[1:09:02] of me he said he came because of the
[1:09:04] message of the Pentecostal message that
[1:09:06] I represent you see that Pillar of Fire
[1:09:08] that that world's in this room it's not
[1:09:11] here for me it's here for the message
[1:09:14] the message is Jesus Christ and when you
[1:09:17] begin to speak the message talk the
[1:09:20] message leave the message
[1:09:22] you may not have the understanding to be
[1:09:24] able to see like Elijah's been able to
[1:09:26] see but if you stick around to Hazel God
[1:09:29] will open up your eyes
[1:09:31] you might walk down in there in that
[1:09:33] Valley all afraid and see all the
[1:09:35] Assyrians around you but when Elijah
[1:09:38] speaks a word over you you'll be able to
[1:09:40] see like Elijah seen
[1:09:43] brother Branham said that gehaza
[1:09:45] couldn't see like Elijah could see was
[1:09:48] because the veil was upon him the veil
[1:09:51] was over him brother Byron said that
[1:09:53] that's what hinders each and every one
[1:09:55] of us is The Veil The Veil keeps us from
[1:09:57] the presence of God the veil keeps us it
[1:09:59] limits us this Veil right here limits us
[1:10:02] from where we're destined to live at
[1:10:06] but when Elijah spoke the words over
[1:10:08] gehaza said Lord open his eyes that he
[1:10:11] can see
[1:10:13] what was it William Branham said that
[1:10:15] the veil dropped off of gehaza's eyes
[1:10:17] and he could look out there on every
[1:10:19] Bush and could see all of them as
[1:10:21] Chariots of Fire With Angels there
[1:10:23] sitting there
[1:10:25] what was it brother Branham said in one
[1:10:27] spot that guy that Elijah didn't even
[1:10:29] see those angels sitting there he said
[1:10:32] but he simply knew that Psalms 34 had
[1:10:35] said that the angels of the Lord
[1:10:36] encamped about them that fear the lord
[1:10:39] he didn't even see them there but he
[1:10:41] knew because the scripture said they'd
[1:10:43] be there
[1:10:44] you may not see it here tonight but
[1:10:47] there's angels that are at their
[1:10:48] position the pillar Fires at its
[1:10:50] position the Holy Ghost is at its
[1:10:52] position Believers are at their position
[1:10:54] and if the veil can fall off of your
[1:10:56] eyes tonight
[1:10:58] you'd be amazed at what would happen
[1:10:59] here tonight if you can get rid of what
[1:11:01] happened this week
[1:11:03] well I did this I did that I worked so
[1:11:06] hard I'm just drained brother Andrew if
[1:11:07] you can lay the veil aside
[1:11:10] if you can lay aside your temperament
[1:11:12] for a minute if you can lay aside your
[1:11:14] ideas and come under the action of the
[1:11:16] inspiration of the Holy Ghost you'll see
[1:11:19] the message in plain view
[1:11:23] all right
[1:11:25] is that right
[1:11:27] you see if you're born again
[1:11:30] you got his thoughts if the mind of
[1:11:33] Christ is in you then you're a new
[1:11:35] creature you see a representative of
[1:11:38] Heaven they don't just change their
[1:11:40] outfits
[1:11:44] you can change your outfit for Sunday
[1:11:46] and change it back out for Monday
[1:11:49] but a representative of Heaven don't
[1:11:51] just change outfits they don't change
[1:11:53] their hair they don't change their war
[1:11:55] paint it's because they are a
[1:11:57] representative of Heaven they've got the
[1:12:00] ideas of almighty God they know what he
[1:12:02] wants done with the word they've gotten
[1:12:04] a confirmation of the commission he
[1:12:06] changed their heart and nothing is as
[1:12:08] powerful as a changed heart
[1:12:16] it's not about shouting
[1:12:19] shouting goes along with it it's not
[1:12:21] about dancing dancing goes along with it
[1:12:24] it's not about screaming to the top of
[1:12:26] your lungs that goes along with it but
[1:12:28] if you can sit there and scream and
[1:12:30] shout and and dance all over the place
[1:12:33] but you can't live what this message is
[1:12:35] outside of there I really don't want
[1:12:38] your shout and I really don't want your
[1:12:40] dance I really don't want your screaming
[1:12:42] if you don't have the power of the
[1:12:44] message to back up your sound
[1:12:47] find a message
[1:12:49] find the answer and the answer is Jesus
[1:12:51] come on somebody if I stood up here and
[1:12:54] preach with all of my mind and all of my
[1:12:56] power and I couldn't live it what good
[1:12:59] is it doing
[1:13:00] but if there's a life behind the power
[1:13:03] if there's a life behind the shout a
[1:13:06] life behind the dance a life behind it
[1:13:09] it'll produce the same thing right now
[1:13:15] come on somebody you don't impress me
[1:13:18] with your speaking in tongues if you
[1:13:20] can't live the message you don't impress
[1:13:21] me with your dance if you can't live the
[1:13:24] message but if there's a message to back
[1:13:26] up it
[1:13:27] every devil in hell can run against you
[1:13:30] and it'll never conquer you
[1:13:35] come on somebody God's looking for a
[1:13:37] representative that'll bless his name
[1:13:40] when it's good and when it's bad
[1:13:42] somebody that'll live it
[1:13:49] we've done seen every carnal
[1:13:51] impersonation that there can be but
[1:13:53] there's only one thing that there cannot
[1:13:55] be a carnal impersonation and that's his
[1:13:57] third pull and when this third pool is
[1:14:00] in action let me tell you you'll know
[1:14:02] the real thing when it settles upon your
[1:14:05] heart it's the king's sword
[1:14:09] come on somebody you have to worry what
[1:14:12] the seals are you are the Seals you
[1:14:14] don't have to worry what the shout is
[1:14:16] you are the shout this message is you
[1:14:23] well you better be careful brother
[1:14:24] Andrew you're stretching out there let
[1:14:26] me tell you you can't talk about God
[1:14:28] without talking about me
[1:14:35] that's what they said Michael Jordan
[1:14:36] Dwyane Wade said they said you can't
[1:14:39] talk about basketball without mentioning
[1:14:41] my name let me tell you you can't talk
[1:14:43] about God in this hour without
[1:14:45] mentioning my name you can't talk about
[1:14:47] this you can't talk about this message
[1:14:49] without representing how all the Full
[1:14:51] Gospel Lighthouse because I'm a part of
[1:14:54] this last stage
[1:14:56] come on Abraham one of these days you're
[1:14:59] going to wake up and the change is going
[1:15:01] to be over you you can sit there and
[1:15:03] think well I'm never no good it's just a
[1:15:05] flesh you're not born of the flesh
[1:15:08] you're born of the spirit of almighty
[1:15:10] God
[1:15:14] well Dwyane Wade made it into the sermon
[1:15:16] [Music]
[1:15:19] what is it it's a people
[1:15:22] that looks so close
[1:15:28] it's Jesus again
[1:15:34] that's Jesus again
[1:15:36] that's Jesus getting written you know
[1:15:37] now let me let me just come right here
[1:15:39] for a moment there's a reason why they
[1:15:42] thought William Branham was God
[1:15:46] come on now there's a reason why they
[1:15:48] thought William Brandon was God he
[1:15:50] humbled himself like almighty God he and
[1:15:52] boasts if anybody had rights to boasts
[1:15:56] and talk about how powerful they were
[1:15:58] William Branham could have done it but
[1:16:00] this man looked so much like Jesus that
[1:16:03] the world thought it was him
[1:16:05] I would that somebody would think that
[1:16:08] you're Jesus he would testify about how
[1:16:11] much life you got how much power you got
[1:16:13] how much inspiration you got well I seen
[1:16:16] Jesus and brother Chris I seen Jesus and
[1:16:18] brother Joel I seen Jesus it's a
[1:16:21] testimony
[1:16:24] come on somebody if you humble yourself
[1:16:26] under the message
[1:16:27] [Applause]
[1:16:31] well we got to have all these activities
[1:16:33] to keep our young people no we don't
[1:16:38] come on I didn't told all these young

[1:17:07] Hollywood movie to get you here all I
[1:17:10] gotta do is preach the message
[1:17:14] that's why Satan hates you it's because
[1:17:16] you don't need entertainment Your
[1:17:19] Entertainment is Jesus
[1:17:20] [Applause]
[1:17:22] let Hollywood entertain themselves but
[1:17:24] let the bride entertain herself with
[1:17:26] Jesus
[1:17:31] Hallelujah
[1:17:32] [Applause]
[1:17:34] foreign
[1:17:38] that the message works
[1:17:42] their sister setting all over this
[1:17:44] building
[1:17:46] that was written off by the rest of
[1:17:48] Christendom
[1:17:49] and I'll be honest there's a lot of you
[1:17:51] sitting here that were written off by
[1:17:53] message preachers today
[1:17:58] well I'm going to preach it anyway
[1:18:00] there's a whole lot of people that would
[1:18:02] have cast you out would have never
[1:18:04] received you never received your ties
[1:18:06] would have said that you're not welcome
[1:18:07] here your kind's not welcome here but
[1:18:09] because you had representation by
[1:18:11] predestination
[1:18:14] Hallelujah there's a lot of people that
[1:18:17] cast you out kicked you out and said you
[1:18:19] wasn't a part of it but God had
[1:18:20] something inside of you before the
[1:18:23] foundation of the world so before Satan
[1:18:25] could count me out God had already
[1:18:27] counted me in
[1:18:34] some of them said they'd never leave a
[1:18:35] message
[1:18:36] they said they never lived a message our
[1:18:38] our pastor stood right here when we had
[1:18:41] cheerleaders we had people that were
[1:18:43] strung out on dope had girls come in
[1:18:45] here that look like the world never one
[1:18:47] time preached a closed line religion
[1:18:52] well brother Angel I can give you a
[1:18:55] quote on that if you don't preach
[1:18:56] clothesline religion you're not quoting
[1:18:58] the gospel let me tell you live the
[1:19:00] gospel
[1:19:02] live the gospel
[1:19:07] I got very little confidence in a man
[1:19:10] that can stand up and preach a message
[1:19:12] as hard as he can but he can't live it
[1:19:16] but I can put confidence in somebody
[1:19:18] that can stand there and say let's be
[1:19:20] Jesus to them left right let's represent
[1:19:22] heaven to them
[1:19:24] then they might be of
[1:19:27] heaven
[1:19:32] you know
[1:19:34] he said well that's strong preaching
[1:19:36] brother Andrew you're right it is
[1:19:38] that's all right
[1:19:40] I can take the heat of them preachers I
[1:19:42] want to get on my back
[1:19:44] I never preached to Stephanie Breeden I
[1:19:47] never preached to Melissa Hill I never
[1:19:48] preached to Crystal Huffman how
[1:19:51] to message was shown out to them and
[1:19:54] they became a part of it
[1:19:58] you look at brother Murphy Wong what a
[1:20:00] powerful testimony that he is when he
[1:20:02] first come to the message his wife was
[1:20:04] an unbeliever you know where they came
[1:20:05] from they came from a communism China
[1:20:07] had all kinds I had all kinds of things
[1:20:09] upon them but when brother Murphy came
[1:20:11] to the message he was so afraid of what
[1:20:14] sister Tracy would think about the
[1:20:15] message so he didn't say nothing to her
[1:20:17] so she just come in and sat down beside
[1:20:20] him now granted sister Tracy doesn't
[1:20:22] understand one lick of English at the
[1:20:24] time
[1:20:25] but she's sitting there don't understand
[1:20:28] English and the preacher's just
[1:20:30] preaching away and she don't understand
[1:20:31] anything Murphy's not in interpreting
[1:20:33] anything
[1:20:36] all of a sudden Tracy gets up says Tracy
[1:20:39] gets up walks out to the back and he's
[1:20:41] like man she's mad about this now
[1:20:43] she don't even understand what's being
[1:20:45] preached she's mad
[1:20:47] and all of a sudden she comes back in
[1:20:48] she takes her earrings out
[1:20:50] she begins to clean she didn't even
[1:20:52] understand English but the word the
[1:20:56] presence of the Living God washed the
[1:20:58] sister
[1:21:00] there are people in Africa that are
[1:21:03] sitting here under the message today
[1:21:04] didn't know one thing about it because
[1:21:06] the language barrier there but by the
[1:21:09] preaching of the word they were sitting
[1:21:10] there innate they were completely naked
[1:21:12] and when the presence of the Lord came
[1:21:14] they went and dressed themselves
[1:21:19] come on somebody you get born again I
[1:21:21] ain't got to tell you how long you got
[1:21:23] to have your dress I ain't got to tell
[1:21:24] you how long yet I keep your hair you
[1:21:26] just get burned again
[1:21:31] you just get good and born again and
[1:21:33] it'll live right out of you well how
[1:21:35] Short's Too Short Jesus will tell you
[1:21:43] it's my hair long enough I don't really
[1:21:45] care as long as it ain't cut
[1:21:55] oh you're gonna make somebody mad I'm
[1:21:58] sure glad I can do it
[1:22:02] see that sister she ain't got very long
[1:22:04] hair she ain't living out the message do
[1:22:05] you know that there's some people they
[1:22:06] can't even grow out their hair
[1:22:08] it ain't about if it's long or not it's
[1:22:11] if it's uncut or not
[1:22:14] and if you get off of your high horse
[1:22:16] get knocked down like Paul wood you'd
[1:22:18] let me do the preaching and let the
[1:22:20] message do what it's supposed to do
[1:22:22] [Applause]
[1:22:38] oh
[1:22:40] I can feel that one burning
[1:22:43] well
[1:22:44] probably gonna get more emails than ever
[1:22:46] have
[1:22:49] my phone number ain't even on the on the
[1:22:51] Church website but I'm sure somebody's
[1:22:52] gonna find it this week
[1:22:59] don't count them out
[1:23:02] don't you count them out
[1:23:04] God had enough Grace to get you isn't it
[1:23:06] amazing ain't it amazing
[1:23:10] you can be so judgmental
[1:23:12] to somebody else
[1:23:16] but when you fall
[1:23:18] do you extend the same Grace or do you
[1:23:21] extend the same judgment
[1:23:25] now I'm just preaching and I'll tell you
[1:23:27] this I didn't learn too long I've been
[1:23:30] doing this for too long not to listen to
[1:23:32] Papa God when he begins to talk ain't no
[1:23:33] issue here I'm just preaching what he
[1:23:35] said preach
[1:23:37] but if you are up on your high horse
[1:23:40] I'll help you get down
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:58] well
[1:24:00] well
[1:24:02] I love y'all
[1:24:05] remember I'm saying what was the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost given for and I'm coming to a
[1:24:08] close because we're having too much fun
[1:24:10] up here
[1:24:12] but he said you take a person that's
[1:24:13] lived a good life and they're always
[1:24:15] defeated
[1:24:16] he said oh I'll tell you a good person
[1:24:18] oh I sure love the Lord Brother Branham
[1:24:20] but they're always defeated they never
[1:24:22] get a prayer answered he said you feel
[1:24:24] that little woman with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:25] one time and you watch what takes place
[1:24:28] when she goes before God she's not
[1:24:30] defeated she comes boldly to the throne
[1:24:31] of God believing she has a right because
[1:24:34] she's a daughter of God by birth take
[1:24:37] that little man that's so cowardly the
[1:24:39] Boss Kick him all over the place said
[1:24:40] wait a minute here now something changed
[1:24:43] he's got the Holy Ghost he gives you
[1:24:45] power your life is full of power
[1:24:47] your life is fully he gives you power to
[1:24:49] speak he gives you power to live right
[1:24:54] Hallelujah you see this kind of people
[1:24:56] know
[1:24:57] what he wants done with the word
[1:25:01] now this scripture I'm getting ready to
[1:25:02] read it can either condemn you or it can
[1:25:05] lift you up
[1:25:06] it just depends on where you're living
[1:25:07] at because the Bible says here in James
[1:25:09] 1 and 21 that wherefore lay upon all
[1:25:12] filthiness and superfluity which means
[1:25:14] abundance of naughtiness
[1:25:16] and receive with meekness the engrafted
[1:25:19] word or the implanted by nature which is
[1:25:22] able to save your souls but be you doers
[1:25:25] of the word and not hearers only
[1:25:26] deceiving your own self for if any be a
[1:25:29] hero of the word and not a doer he is
[1:25:32] likened to a man beholding his natural
[1:25:34] face in the glass for he behold of
[1:25:36] himself and goeth his way and
[1:25:38] straightway forgetth what manner of man
[1:25:39] he was
[1:25:42] so it's like a person sitting here
[1:25:45] the message for 30 years
[1:25:48] but live a defeated life
[1:25:52] or it's like this but whosoever looketh
[1:25:55] in the perfect law of Liberty and
[1:25:58] continuous therein he being not a
[1:26:00] forgetful hearing but to do her the work
[1:26:02] this man shall be blessed
[1:26:06] how many likes to be blessed
[1:26:08] this man the consider the message take
[1:26:11] it when it's hot
[1:26:12] and take it when it's not that man is
[1:26:15] blessed in his deed so a person that
[1:26:19] refuses to be corrupted with the world's
[1:26:21] value that man can be blessed notice
[1:26:24] what Psalms 19 and 8 says about it that
[1:26:26] the statues of the Lord are right
[1:26:28] rejoicing the heart the Commandment of
[1:26:30] the Lord is pure enlightening the lies
[1:26:32] the fear of the Lord is clean enduring
[1:26:35] forever the judgments of the Lord are
[1:26:37] true righteous all together more to be
[1:26:40] desired than day of gold yea than much
[1:26:43] fine gold sweeter than also the honey
[1:26:45] and the honeycomb moreover by them is
[1:26:49] thy servant warned and in keeping them
[1:26:51] there is great reward this man is
[1:26:54] blessed in his deed
[1:26:57] Psalm 65 and 4 said blessed is the man
[1:27:00] whom thou chooses and calls us to
[1:27:03] approach Unity
[1:27:07] the reason why you can have the approach
[1:27:08] that you have
[1:27:10] is because you're chosen by almighty God
[1:27:14] now I'm a Believer
[1:27:16] I'm a Believer in God's word in the
[1:27:18] people
[1:27:19] that when it fills their life that it
[1:27:22] gives them the very dynamics of the
[1:27:23] mechanics because we recognize that the
[1:27:26] scripture tells us that the letter kills
[1:27:28] but the spirit gives life
[1:27:31] and I'm not making room for people's
[1:27:32] mistakes but I'm giving them room to get
[1:27:34] to a place of repentance
[1:27:37] I'm a believer I'm a Believer in you
[1:27:40] when the word is in there
[1:27:42] because you are not just standing on
[1:27:44] your own two feet you are representing
[1:27:47] all of heaven when the Dynamics of the
[1:27:50] message come in there that's what
[1:27:52] William Branham said would be that the
[1:27:54] restoration of the hour would be a
[1:27:57] refilling of the Holy Ghost the Dynamics
[1:27:59] of the message
[1:28:01] Hallelujah and when you put that on the
[1:28:04] inside of these bottles sitting here
[1:28:05] what does it do it produces the same
[1:28:08] thing that happened up there on the day
[1:28:10] of Pentecost when 120 so-called Scout
[1:28:13] cowards appear 10 days before now they
[1:28:16] come out boasting and speaking in
[1:28:18] tongues bow in the power of the Holy
[1:28:20] Ghost
[1:28:22] I'm a Believer
[1:28:24] in the word in God's people
[1:28:27] you may not look like the best quality
[1:28:29] material
[1:28:31] but you just let the word wash you
[1:28:35] you let the word wash you
[1:28:38] you see that's why God gives you a
[1:28:41] pastor
[1:28:43] foreign
[1:28:45] because people are like an onion
[1:28:48] they come off layer to layer and they
[1:28:49] make you cry
[1:28:53] God don't give you an evangelist that
[1:28:55] comes through and storm through your
[1:28:56] life
[1:28:57] to be the harbor over your soul
[1:29:00] he gives you a pastor
[1:29:03] when you get down here he'll be right
[1:29:05] there lifts you up
[1:29:09] he reminds you that a righteous man can
[1:29:11] fall
[1:29:12] but he gets back up seven times
[1:29:15] he reminds you that there's a message
[1:29:16] and there is a blood
[1:29:18] that there is able to cover you from all
[1:29:21] of your sins
[1:29:23] thank God that God's got God given
[1:29:27] pastors
[1:29:30] you see because you may not look it
[1:29:32] exactly like the photograph that God
[1:29:34] took before the foundation of the world
[1:29:36] but you're going to get there
[1:29:39] Seth there was a lot of times in your
[1:29:41] life that it didn't look like it was
[1:29:42] going to be very promising that you did
[1:29:44] like the photograph that God took
[1:29:46] and it looked like maybe maybe about you
[1:29:49] brother Joel it just looked like it man
[1:29:51] that dude is not it's just not going to
[1:29:53] get it it's just not gonna it's just not
[1:29:55] gonna get
[1:29:56] but the word began to wash over
[1:29:59] and to begin to clean off your life and
[1:30:01] that's why God speaks in Ezekiel he said
[1:30:04] I will clean you with pure water and I
[1:30:08] will put my spirit in this inside of you
[1:30:10] I'll give you a new heart and a new
[1:30:12] spirit and then I'll give you my spirit
[1:30:14] you see you see there is where a lot of
[1:30:18] people they miss the message but that's
[1:30:20] the message right there get a new heart
[1:30:22] get a new spirit so you can get along
[1:30:24] with his Spirit when it comes brother
[1:30:26] Randall said it's like a mainspring of a
[1:30:28] watch everything if that mainspring is
[1:30:31] off if that new spirit is off you'll
[1:30:33] never live the message but you get that
[1:30:35] mainspring working in action it'll be
[1:30:38] it'll prove Acts 2 and 4. it'll prove
[1:30:40] John 3 16. it'll proved Hebrews 13 and
[1:30:43] 8.
[1:30:45] when the mainspring is there
[1:30:48] that's why Jesus would say in Matthew 9
[1:30:51] and 17 that you can't put new wine in
[1:30:54] Old bottles
[1:30:59] why is that it's because that new skin
[1:31:02] has got to be flexible
[1:31:05] that's why you got to be born again you
[1:31:07] can't handle the message in your old
[1:31:09] dead state
[1:31:11] you watch a lot of people not accepting
[1:31:14] that
[1:31:16] I'll do whatever I want to well you see
[1:31:18] your cowhide you're just dead and dried
[1:31:20] up
[1:31:22] I ain't gonna listen to that old Pastor
[1:31:24] preach the way he's preaching well
[1:31:26] you're proving your old dead cow hide
[1:31:27] right there
[1:31:30] but oh when the pastor gets a preacher
[1:31:33] and he'd go all that new wine gets you
[1:31:35] stimulated on the inside of you because
[1:31:37] you got a new skin
[1:31:39] you begin to get flexible to the word
[1:31:41] it's got life in it you see that wine
[1:31:44] that Revelations got life in it and he's
[1:31:47] got to have room to move but you put
[1:31:49] that all right that new wine on the
[1:31:51] inside of old cranky old woman old man
[1:31:52] they've been born again
[1:31:55] why it's too cold he's too loud he's not
[1:31:57] speaking loud enough
[1:31:59] I'll tell you what if it's so hot out
[1:32:00] there I'm not coming to church I've been
[1:32:02] I've been just thinking about all how
[1:32:03] how I could get dehydrated if I walk
[1:32:05] outside for 10 minutes
[1:32:07] you know he's going to preach it oh he's
[1:32:09] pretty gonna burn my head you old cow
[1:32:10] hot
[1:32:15] you know every once in a while
[1:32:18] but be careful every once in a while it
[1:32:22] feels good to get a good woman
[1:32:23] it reminds you you're still human
[1:32:27] because if you think you got it all
[1:32:29] figured out
[1:32:30] get ready you coming down
[1:32:33] but if you can handle the true word the
[1:32:37] way it's preached like the prophet
[1:32:39] preached it it shows that there's a new
[1:32:42] sin that can handle a new why and don't
[1:32:45] you thankful you've been born again
[1:32:47] filled with the Holy Ghost and that
[1:32:50] there has been a covenant that is made
[1:32:51] don't touch a new wine don't touch the
[1:32:54] oil
[1:32:55] Satan can't touch the Holy Ghost and he
[1:32:58] can't touch this revelation
[1:33:01] the message works
[1:33:03] the message works
[1:33:06] would you stand with us this evening
[1:33:12] you see
[1:33:16] in the world
[1:33:19] in a world when Nimrod was building a
[1:33:22] tower
[1:33:25] and it looked like men were turning
[1:33:26] their back on God God had a man by the
[1:33:29] name of Enoch that was going to type out
[1:33:30] of people for rapture
[1:33:33] in a world in a world that was
[1:33:37] that was debauched in sin
[1:33:39] that God repented that he created man
[1:33:42] God had a Noah on the earth that was
[1:33:45] going to float above the Judgment Waters
[1:33:48] when when there was a whole bunch of of
[1:33:50] God denying people that was living in
[1:33:52] Babylon God had three Brew here children
[1:33:55] when the when men when a king made a
[1:33:57] decree when our King made a decree that
[1:34:00] there would be no prayer made for such
[1:34:02] and such time God had a man that was
[1:34:04] loyal that would pray and knew that when
[1:34:07] he got himself into situations prayer
[1:34:10] had the ability to get him out God had a
[1:34:12] man by the name of Daniel in the midst
[1:34:14] of a Babylonian Kingdom
[1:34:17] when there was an age of philosophers
[1:34:19] and theologians God had Men by the name
[1:34:22] of Peter James and John faith hope and
[1:34:24] charity that he could prove that Jesus
[1:34:26] was still Jesus
[1:34:30] what is it you're here to represent the
[1:34:33] boss
[1:34:35] you're here to represent the laws
[1:34:38] and if I can't represent him
[1:34:41] and all that he is
[1:34:45] if I can't represent him in my speech
[1:34:48] I say Lord clean me up
[1:34:50] if I can't represent him the way the
[1:34:53] message says I should Lord clean me up
[1:34:55] [Music]
[1:34:57] Lord if I'm not presenting the message
[1:34:59] in the right light
[1:35:02] or clean me up
[1:35:04] I don't want anything
[1:35:07] to hinder me
[1:35:09] [Music]

[1:36:09] I got confidence in a man
[1:36:12] that don't say a whole lot but he can
[1:36:14] live what the message is
[1:36:16] more
[1:36:17] than somebody that can boast about the

[1:36:24] I say oh God
[1:36:25] live in me like never before

[1:37:20] anything unless you're comfortable with
[1:37:23] Jesus sitting right beside you
[1:37:26] I tell you you'll think about things
[1:37:28] different
[1:37:29] when the prince of peace and the King of
[1:37:31] Kings and the Lord of lords that's why
[1:37:33] David would say that I have set the Lord
[1:37:35] before me in all my ways that I might
[1:37:38] not sin against him because you can't
[1:37:40] sin
[1:37:42] when you're looking at the Lord
[1:37:44] so God if I'm going to represent your
