[0:05] such an honor to be here as always
[0:09] always coming home if I could ask my
[0:12] wife to come up here she's gonna get me
[0:13] but I was instructed by your pastor to
[0:15] do this well she's coming I want to read
[0:18] a verse of scripture if you don't mind
[0:20] Psalms 37 verse 4 says delight thyself
[0:23] also in the Lord and he shall give thee
[0:27] the desires of thine heart commit thy
[0:29] way unto the Lord Trust also in him and
[0:32] he shall bring it to pass
[0:35] my wife and I had been desiring a child
[0:37] and we've been trying for about two
[0:40] years now and it just seems like every
[0:43] time we would think that we were that
[0:44] way we would come up on another
[0:46] roadblock and and we would begin to
[0:49] think of things that we did in our past
[0:51] that that may affect our future by
[0:57] starting a family and things of that
[0:58] nature and we began to to just pray over
[1:01] the last year and and began to really
[1:04] seek God in the situation because as
[1:07] many of you know I was the only green
[1:10] grandson of brother Henry my dad being
[1:13] the only boy so we want to carry on that
[1:14] lineage as long as the Lord of latest
[1:16] let us stay on the earth here so we
[1:19] began to pray and really seek the face
[1:21] of God with the situation and come camp
[1:25] meeting that Wednesday night when
[1:27] brother Ron was speaking on if he could
[1:29] stand behind the curtain and he wouldn't
[1:31] be able to see him or hear hid and
[1:33] disguise his voice and just just tell
[1:35] you what God has for you my wife was
[1:37] actually behind the curtain the whole
[1:39] time there she was running the
[1:41] PowerPoint and kind of helping with the
[1:44] Psalms and everything and she really
[1:46] began to just pray and cry out to God
[1:49] and she would she would say that if
[1:53] brother on he had already walked off the
[1:56] stage walked past this and walked past
[1:57] her I was still on the stage there and
[1:59] he would come back because she know the
[2:03] gift that brother Ron had in his life
[2:04] and how he yields herself to the Holy
[2:05] Spirit
[2:06] she said if we're to be prayed for he'll
[2:09] come back by
[2:11] and as soon as I walked off the stof the
[2:13] stage behind the curtain really run and
[2:14] turned around and come back our way and
[2:17] he looked at me you know if any of you
[2:19] have been here long enough you've seen
[2:20] brother Ron when he gets in that channel
[2:22] and it looks like he's staring dead
[2:23] through you he looked at me he said go
[2:26] get your wife so I walked over and I got
[2:28] sister Kaitlyn by the hand and we come
[2:30] back over to where he was at and he
[2:32] began to speak words to us and pray and
[2:34] he would say that your future is not
[2:37] affected by the things in your past and
[2:40] it was just just an answer to prayer to
[2:43] us and as he began to say these words
[2:45] and pray over us and when he was done he
[2:47] said you can go have that baby now and I
[2:50] just want to give the devil a black eye
[2:51] right now and here's a picture of a
[2:53] miracle Satan this is a picture of what
[2:57] a miracle looks like
[3:03] I know that many of you it's been here
[3:06] oh wait you're done
[3:08] oh Jesus
[3:21] but I'm not done yet we were prayed for
[3:26] the first week in August this little
[3:29] miracle is due the first week in August
[3:31] exactly a year to the date from we were
[3:33] prayed for now I don't have to stand
[3:37] here and tell you about the miracles
[3:38] that have come to pass that the miracles
[3:40] that are going to come to pass because
[3:42] if you've been in this message long
[3:45] enough for this message has been in you
[3:46] long enough you've seen miracles I can
[3:49] go a step further with that if you've
[3:51] been in this church any amount of time
[3:54] and you still don't believe in miracles
[3:56] and there's no hope for you the God that
[4:01] your pastor yields himself to is not
[4:03] just a God of right of yesterday he's a
[4:06] God of right now he's here to meet your
[4:09] needs

[33:12] and amen you can be seated and say let's
[33:16] have church brother branham is speaking
[33:20] in conflict between God and Satan that's
[33:23] a good place to start in it he said I'm
[33:27] thinking about a little antelope one
[33:29] time that he got out of the refuge and
[33:32] the hounds were were after him and he
[33:35] was running for his dear life and when
[33:38] he come to the fence where the refuge
[33:40] was he he turned around and looked at
[33:43] those hounds because he was safe they
[33:46] could not climb the fence they wasn't
[33:50] built that way
[33:53] and if they touch that fence they'd be
[33:55] knocked back with electrical shock
[33:58] that's the way we are Lord when we get
[34:02] behind the fence the defense of God's
[34:04] Word
[34:05] the electrical power of the Holy Spirit
[34:09] stands our enemy off and he cannot
[34:14] hurdle the fence he's not made that way
[34:19] we think thee that thou has made us so
[34:23] that we can jump for safety Lord into
[34:27] Christ Jesus and we're so glad Lord that
[34:30] we're safe evermore and possessing the
[34:35] gate of the enemy he said he cared
[34:38] enough he cared enough to conquer every
[34:42] enemy for you that you will have to do
[34:48] just to be sincere he conquered death
[34:52] death ain't nothing for me to conquer
[34:55] it's already conquered sickness ain't
[34:59] nothing for me to conquer it ain't
[35:01] nothing
[35:02] Christ conquered it he says he says I
[35:06] just have to it I just have to believe
[35:08] it are you afraid of what somebody else
[35:11] has told you are you afraid of what the
[35:14] doctors diagnosis
[35:15] are you afraid of what the church will
[35:17] say to you are you afraid to to stand
[35:20] and lay aside everything I believed
[35:24] every word and Here I am Lord created me
[35:29] you can't for me and I care for you when
[35:34] he was here on earth he conquered and
[35:36] possessed every gate that the enemy had
[35:38] the royal seed he possessed it by the
[35:41] word he conquered it he conquered the
[35:46] gate of sickness for us that's what he
[35:49] come to do remember sick people he
[35:52] conquered the gate I say a man you don't
[35:55] have to conquer and he conquered it
[35:57] the other man had to conquer their own
[36:00] gate but you don't have to conquer it's
[36:03] already conquered
[36:05] he conquered the gates of sickness and
[36:07] what did they do when he conquered the
[36:09] gates of sickness saying whatever you
[36:12] asked on earth whatever you bind on
[36:14] earth will be bound him on heaven
[36:16] whatever you bind in heaven he says I'll
[36:18] give you the key keys to the gate he
[36:20] conquered the gate of temptations by the
[36:23] word the keys resists the intamin he'll
[36:25] flee from you he conquered it he
[36:28] conquered all sickness he conquered
[36:32] death he conquered hell he conquered
[36:35] death in hell he conquered what others
[36:39] could not conquer because they were of
[36:43] the natural seed and this is the
[36:45] spiritual seed he conquered the gates of
[36:47] the grave and he rose up on the third
[36:49] day for our justification so we're more
[36:52] than conquerors we'll just walk right
[36:55] into it that's into an inheritance we're
[36:58] more than conquerors sickness is
[37:02] defeated death is defeated hallelujah
[37:09] Hallet sofy today many like you believe
[37:12] it hallelujah revelation the church age
[37:24] book he says as I've already said this
[37:27] book of revelations the consummation of
[37:29] the Scriptures it is evenly placed
[37:32] exactly right in the the Canon of the
[37:35] scriptures at the end now you can know
[37:38] why that it says that anyone who reads
[37:41] or even hears it it is blessed it is the
[37:45] revelation of God that will give you the
[37:49] authority over the devil and you can see
[37:56] why they who would add or take away from
[37:59] it would be cursed and it would have to
[38:02] be so for who can add or take away from
[38:06] the perfect revelation of God and
[38:09] overcome and overcome the enemy
[38:18] brother Tim wrote me this and I like I
[38:21] like it general I have lots brother
[38:25] Donnie told me yesterday it's all right
[38:27] to have likes he said Jesus liked
[38:29] certain things but the Tim wrote me this
[38:33] and if he's listening he'll be aware of
[38:35] that he says diseases are demon spirits
[38:40] who like their masters Satan seek bodies
[38:44] to do harm in they come to dwell in
[38:48] order to do harm they are as a thief
[38:51] that comes to steal to kill and destroy
[38:54] all bodies where the Christian are not
[38:58] are vulnerable to Satan's invasion due
[39:00] to the fault demons within sinners use
[39:04] their bodies to do their dirty work in
[39:06] them they use their power to defile and
[39:09] to destroy and abuse other people and
[39:12] animals and the environment Satan then
[39:14] uses these defile ones as his own
[39:17] missionaries to defile other innocent
[39:20] people God almost also must use human
[39:24] instruments anointed and filled by the
[39:27] Holy Ghost to bless to inspire to
[39:30] encourage others who need God's help
[39:33] demons are not to be feared the weakest
[39:37] Christian can use his word to cast them
[39:40] out people fear them because they don't
[39:42] understand their position and have never
[39:44] heard that my their legal defeat of
[39:47] Christ of our Lord the taken of the book
[39:51] of the title and the open of the seals
[39:53] is a triumph of the bloody lamb which
[39:56] opens to us all the possibilities within
[40:00] the book we need not live below our
[40:06] privileges any longer the ownership to
[40:10] our inheritance has never been more sure
[40:16] give the Lord a good hand right there
[40:19] [Applause]
[40:29] let's go back and find some a man of
[40:32] Abraham seed under the Jewish covenant
[40:34] then bring it down to the Gentiles when
[40:37] we were drafted over from the Jewish Age
[40:39] to the Gentile age to take the people
[40:41] for his name let's just say take some
[40:44] man who was the seed of Abraham and see
[40:47] if they possess the gates of their enemy
[40:50] let's take for instance let's just speak
[40:52] a moment when the children of Israel had
[40:55] been carried away down into the
[40:56] captivity into Babylon there cometh Tom
[40:59] first had to come to a trial and there's
[41:02] always trials it's always darkest before
[41:06] the day in nature and you'll always have
[41:09] trials before you can have a victory if
[41:12] there's no war then there's no victory
[41:15] and the Hebrew children down there had
[41:18] been brought to a spot where the King
[41:20] had made a declaration than anybody that
[41:23] would not bow to this image would be
[41:25] thrown into the fiery furnace into that
[41:28] furnace of fire rather and he said well
[41:30] and then they purposed in their heart
[41:33] that they was not going to defile
[41:35] themselves they were going to live close
[41:37] to God the three Hebrew children
[41:39] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they were
[41:42] the seed of Abraham and they had a
[41:44] promise of God that his seed would
[41:47] possess the gates of their enemy
[41:51] and I'd imagine when that trial come up
[41:54] what's the first thing that a child of
[41:57] God has for a refuge when a trial comes
[42:01] notice these next words the greatest
[42:04] weapon was ever put in the hands of
[42:07] mankind prayer heard Andrew speak last
[42:15] night I thought that was a phenomenal
[42:16] sermon you haven't heard it go back and
[42:18] listen to it who is this among us not
[42:23] who that was among us 2,000 years ago or
[42:26] 50 years ago 10 years ago seems like so
[42:30] quickly I've been here 20 years he's
[42:32] your pastor
[42:33] that went quick we can see that God's up
[42:37] to date are you guys okay are you guys
[42:45] okay look over what your neighbor said
[42:47] we're gonna have Church here we can see
[42:55] by the gist of the pictures that were
[42:57] just up here just a few moments ago God
[43:00] did every one of those things no man's a
[43:03] healer no doctors a healer
[43:06] no preachers a healer I know we have our
[43:10] likes and we like this one or we're
[43:12] we're more attached to this minister of
[43:14] that ministry but that man can heal you
[43:18] Jesus is the healer when brother Branham
[43:22] was standing there and that little girl
[43:24] with those blond eyes and those
[43:25] cataracts and rinsed around her and she
[43:28] grabbed a hold to his lapel which he
[43:30] realized who brother Branham was when
[43:34] you realize your moment when you realize
[43:38] your moment like Jacob did when you
[43:40] realize your moment that I'm standing in
[43:43] a special spot
[43:45] there was a special spot that night when
[43:51] I was standing up they were out there on
[43:53] the platform that night and sharing the
[43:55] meeting with brother Tom ray and I
[43:57] preached for about an hour hour and
[43:59] twenty minutes and I preached and it was
[44:02] like I was preaching against a brass
[44:03] wall and I kept asking the audience to
[44:06] get with me
[44:07] get with me get with me and just a
[44:09] couple of people came down for prayer
[44:11] and I'd made a declaration if I could
[44:15] stand behind the curtain and God could
[44:17] use me behind a curtain not even hear my
[44:19] voice when the microphones off and I'm
[44:22] behind the curtain
[44:23] then God did a miracle but it was the
[44:27] same God that was standing behind the
[44:29] pulpit but there was a girl praying the
[44:38] wrong I didn't get nothing out of
[44:39] service but there is a girl praying it's
[44:44] what you pull for it's what you come to
[44:47] see it's what your expectation is
[44:51] [Applause]
[45:00] I'm preaching my way into a miracle I
[45:04] don't know what you came to do you may
[45:07] be watching your watch and you're in a
[45:09] hurry you're dismissed
[45:22] but I am taking God's Word and preaching
[45:25] and cutting my way into a victory what
[45:32] will you do at your last testimony what
[45:36] will you do at your last sermon I want
[45:38] to preach every sermon like it's my last
[45:40] and I've been doing that for a long time
[45:43] so don't think that I'm thinking this is
[45:45] my last I want to give God everything
[45:50] everything
[45:51] [Applause]
[46:13] Paul said it like this in first
[46:16] Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 3 and I
[46:18] was with you in weakness and in fear and
[46:23] in much trembling I was down praying
[46:27] yesterday in my office and I was praying
[46:31] I I just said I was having a moment
[46:34] we all have human moments and I was
[46:38] having a moment and brother Isaiah
[46:40] Brooks he said he was sitting in his
[46:42] office and he said funny he said I had a
[46:47] meeting scheduled and then I was
[46:49] supposed to go to another spot and he
[46:51] said everything was canceled and I was
[46:54] sitting here in my office and he said
[46:56] God spoke to me and he said call Ron
[46:59] Spencer I'd say it's been two years
[47:02] since Isaiah's call me we've text
[47:04] Michael Voris
[47:05] but it's two years since he called me
[47:07] we've spoken a meeting it had brother
[47:09] Henry Simmons last year and and I don't
[47:13] know if I'm gonna stick there but if we
[47:14] do I want you to go with me are you with
[47:19] me are you with me and he said brother
[47:27] Ron he said I want to tell you Jesus
[47:31] wept in his humanity he wept and as a
[47:38] human he got hungry and as a human he
[47:42] got angry but as o'clock he raised up
[47:51] and as God he said Lazarus step forth I
[47:59] having the phone up after I was after we
[48:03] enjoyed a wonderful conversation and in
[48:06] two minutes brother Donnie Regan calls
[48:10] and just for reassurance he begins to
[48:13] talk to me about the dual nature of a
[48:16] man and how a man is human
[48:19] and how we express our human weaknesses
[48:22] he said but the glimpse of God that dear
[48:25] till raise up inside of you and speak to
[48:29] the devil
[48:38] and of course my buddy brother Tim
[48:40] brooked has preached to me all week long
[48:44] he has hired me with atomic power
[48:47] all week long it won't stop today it
[48:49] won't stop next week he said brother Ron
[48:52] you guys shouldn't be so close we are
[48:55] brothers
[49:00] Paul said I was with you in weakness and
[49:03] in fear and in much trembling and my
[49:08] speech and my preaching was not with
[49:09] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[49:12] demonstration of the Spirit and the
[49:17] power for the Ender sent me this today
[49:21] let Satan come in for deep cold to the
[49:24] deep
[49:25] let's Satan take after a believer
[49:30] let's Satan take after a believer and
[49:33] he's got Jesus Christ on his hands
[49:49] let's Satan take after you and because
[49:55] you are who you are

[50:16] hallelujah you may have European or
[50:18] Canadian or Russian or Filipino you may
[50:22] have all kind of flesh DNA that's on the
[50:24] inside of you might be surprised what
[50:27] all is on the inside of you but the
[50:29] great thing about you is God
[50:31] predestinated the seed of God on the
[50:34] inside of you not when you walk to an
[50:39] older but before the foundation of the
[50:43] world and he watched over that seed all
[50:46] the way from there all the way to
[50:49] mankind all the way at this point and if
[50:55] God could get you here he'll get you
[50:58] there hallelujah
[51:15] Acts chapter 3 says Peter said silver
[51:19] and gold have I none but such as I have
[51:25] give a thing in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:31] rise up and walk
[51:35] and he took he mother hand and lifted
[51:37] him up and immediately his feet and
[51:39] ankle bones received strength and he
[51:42] leave me up stood and walked and entered
[51:46] him with them into the temple walking
[51:53] that's a great big word when you never
[51:55] did it that's a great big word when you
[51:59] remember did it hallelujah this is day
[52:06] one he's walking brother on I just
[52:11] started serving the Lord well that's day
[52:13] one and there's a long journey in front

[52:19] comes your way you keep walking if you
[52:22] fall down you get back up again
[52:24] I guess grace you get back up
[52:28] run run but I did this and I did this
[52:30] and I did this and I do this there's
[52:33] nothing that the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:35] cannot take care of Jairus the blood of
[52:42] Jesus Christ power ever work in power
[52:48] yes
[52:56] hallelujah that's the greatest miracle

[53:08] we've seen people come out of
[53:10] wheelchairs we've seen cancers fall
[53:14] we've seen every disease but the
[53:16] greatest miracle is the transformation
[53:20] of your soul from dope addict prostitute
[53:26] no matter what you are and being a
[53:29] religious nut it's just as bad as any of
[53:31] the other maybe worse because you can't
[53:35] save yourself as we will baptize in a
[53:41] few minutes said repent that's where you
[53:45] got to do the repentance not some
[53:48] Catholic father standing over top of you
[53:50] and doing some magic warm you did the
[53:53] sin you do the repentant
[54:06] repentance is to turn away I'm never
[54:10] gonna go back to that place again
[54:13] repentance is not I got caught everybody
[54:20] saw her when they did caught politicians
[54:22] Kings preachers Oh everybody sorry when
[54:25] they get caught but that's not
[54:27] repentance
[54:29] [Applause]
[54:32] everybody wants to come to God when
[54:34] they're in trouble
[54:36] prisons are full of religious people but
[54:41] you know why they can live right there
[54:42] they got boundaries come on you might as
[54:49] well preach with me we got a while here
[54:53] but God wants you to overcome lay on the
[54:56] sill he puts you in the worst day that
[54:59] there is and he gives you an inoculation
[55:02] over sin you can't hold yourself so God
[55:09] gave you something that's an inoculation
[55:11] for the Laodicean flu repent every one
[55:20] of you prophets children kings children
[55:24] my children everybody's got to repent
[55:26] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[55:30] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[55:33] sins well I've been baptized this way
[55:37] that way if it hasn't in the name of the
[55:39] Lord Jesus Christ you have not been
[55:41] baptized right
[55:51] brother on our sprinkle that's a baby
[55:53] that's not bad touched I was sprinkled
[55:56] in a little pool that's not bad does I
[55:58] was baptizing Father Son and Holy Ghost
[56:01] that's not bad does that's not Christian
[56:04] baptism I don't care what the Pope says
[56:10] I don't want care what the Pentecostal
[56:12] associations down here say I don't care
[56:14] what none of them say Father Son Holy
[56:16] Ghost baptized only connects you to the
[56:19] Roman Catholic Church
[56:22] [Applause]
[56:34] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:36] Christ and then you'll be filled with
[56:39] the Holy Ghost because you can't do it
[56:43] with your own emotion
[56:44] oh brother on I got worked up I'm gonna
[56:46] come back to church I'm you're gonna be
[56:48] my pastor forever most times I hear that
[56:51] you're going to be my pastor forever
[56:53] don't never see them again let me just
[56:56] say if it's emotion you'll be gone after
[57:03] about six months you'll be gone because
[57:05] your energies are run out and the
[57:07] battles will come because every Sun that
[57:10] come up the God has to be chastised has
[57:13] to be tested let me just say it a faith
[57:17] that cannot be tested cannot be trusted
[57:31] I'll say it again a faith that cannot be
[57:35] tested cannot be trusted it's not allow
[57:45] me I'm not looking for pity or sorrow
[57:50] I'm looking for you to take the amateur
[57:52] God that's on the inside of you and cut
[57:55] our weight of that threat don't let your
[58:04] fear and your wearing and your agonizing
[58:09] I'm expecting you to pray and I'm
[58:13] expecting you to pray with power not
[58:19] some medal now I lay me down to sleep I
[58:21] pray the Lord my soul to keep if I
[58:23] should die before I wake I pray the Lord
[58:25] my soul to take but I'm talking about
[58:28] talking to God I'm afraid in America
[58:32] that's what we've done we've allowed our
[58:34] self to fall in a rut and we come to
[58:38] church without pray and that's the
[58:39] reason we don't get nothing we want the
[58:43] preacher to do it all
[58:44] we want the singers to do it all we want
[58:47] the minister to get us in revival shape
[58:49] clap our hands knock knock and go to
[58:51] McDonald's and eat this is more than a
[59:00] convenience gospel this message is to

[1:01:18] what you do governments will do what
[1:01:22] they're going to do with one percent

[1:01:26] way it would work in China that's the
[1:01:28] way it worked in Russia that's the way
[1:01:30] it'll work in America they'll put in who
[1:01:33] they want to put in they'll work you up
[1:01:38] and they'll tell you they're going to
[1:01:39] give you all the things that you want to
[1:01:40] get and then well brother on we need to
[1:01:48] defend arms ok defend this if they could

[1:02:03] you'll ever have
[1:02:30] they're not gonna take away my
[1:02:32] high-powered rifle they're not gonna
[1:02:34] take away my pistols they took away your
[1:02:36] Word of God they took away your revival
[1:02:42] out of your churches and you elected you
[1:02:48] some Softsoap pastors that kiss babies
[1:02:51] on the head and will not dare preach on
[1:02:55] women how they are addressed and live

[1:04:01] he'll raise you up in the middle of your
[1:04:04] sickness my god Wow
[1:04:25] somewhere in hell there's a meeting
[1:04:27] going on and head devil saying boys I
[1:04:33] thought your head that got sick boys I
[1:04:39] thought joy done scared deliver on that
[1:04:41] guy we did he had him shaken we had him
[1:04:45] crying he got up he woke up
[1:04:54] he recognized Jesus ascending about what
[1:04:58] are we going to do when Jesus said about

[1:05:33] six foot four weighed quite a bit more
[1:05:36] than I did he decided to fight and he
[1:05:40] decided he was gonna whip me he decided
[1:05:45] that when I got done with him he was off

[1:13:17] not yours but God's get all the things
[1:13:23] away from you and say mister Satan you
[1:13:26] are defeated Jesus Christ stripped you
[1:13:28] of every power that you had when he died
[1:13:30] at Calvary and you're nothing but a
[1:13:33] bluff you can't boss me I'm a lot of
[1:13:36] stuff that don't Bluff
[1:13:38] that's what come from Calvary
[1:13:41] hallelujah don't Bluff don't receive it
[1:13:44] so step aside I'm moving on for Christ
[1:13:48] now it's been said and it's true that
[1:13:51] cowards not ten thousand times where a
[1:13:54] hero never dies God wants people who are
[1:13:57] brave and can take their stand and if
[1:13:59] anything that Christ could use could not
[1:14:02] use in his kingdom
[1:14:04] would be a coward have faith in God
[1:14:18] and the first thing we should find out
[1:14:22] what faith is the Bible says that faith
[1:14:25] is the substance of things hoped for the
[1:14:27] evidence of things not seen
[1:14:29] and this little word faith gets mixed up
[1:14:31] a lot of times with hope and hope and
[1:14:34] faith they're just as much different as
[1:14:36] the day is from not Satan your offense
[1:14:48] to me get out of my way of the name of
[1:14:52] Jesus Christ and he left them said the
[1:14:57] sweetest fro a voice said I've ever
[1:14:59] heard in my life that said don't fear to
[1:15:03] go anywhere don't fear to do anything
[1:15:06] for the never-failing presence of Jesus
[1:15:10] Christ is with you wherever you go I'm
[1:15:16] gonna read it again the sweetest voice
[1:15:19] that I've ever heard in my life said no
[1:15:21] fear to do anywhere and no fear to do
[1:15:24] anything for the never-failing presence
[1:15:27] of Jesus crisis with you wherever you he
[1:15:38] says when a man is inspired and he reads
[1:15:40] the inspired words the two inspirations
[1:15:42] together gives a result no matter how
[1:15:44] well you study the word it'll never do
[1:15:46] you any good till you're inspired
[1:15:47] yourself it takes your inspiration with
[1:15:50] the word that's already inspired what we
[1:15:52] do today with the inspiration over us
[1:15:55] God's sweeping down in that new
[1:15:56] inspiration breathing over us his power
[1:15:58] his love and himself that it might
[1:16:01] inspire us to quicken us and waken us to
[1:16:03] his word and then the word being brought
[1:16:06] into that spirit of inspiration then
[1:16:08] you'll see miracles happen then you'll
[1:16:12] see miracles happen proof of his
[1:16:16] resurrection this is either the Word of
[1:16:19] God or it's a deceiving book
[1:16:26] it's either right or it's wrong it's
[1:16:32] either all right or all wrong
[1:16:39] every word is inspired or none of them
[1:16:45] is inspired I'll come back and get some
[1:16:58] of this that day on Calvary he said Lord
[1:17:09] we know that the Lord now art God and
[1:17:11] after reading this sacred holy word we
[1:17:15] can see that your nature has not changed
[1:17:17] you're always God it seemed like that
[1:17:20] Jesus was not going to have any help and
[1:17:22] he was taken by wicked hands and hacked
[1:17:24] to pieces and spit on and mocked and
[1:17:30] hanging on a cross bleeding and dying it
[1:17:33] seemed like there was no help no were
[1:17:35] tell even he cried to himself my God my
[1:17:39] God why hast thou forsaken me but you
[1:17:42] act in the moment that that when nothing
[1:17:45] else cannot we're given to know Lord
[1:17:48] that if we have any rivers that we
[1:17:51] cannot cross if we have any mountains
[1:17:54] that we cannot go through God
[1:17:57] specializes in doing things and others
[1:18:00] cannot do you are a specialist on the
[1:18:04] job for you know the reason on that day
[1:18:07] on Calvary you be in God the infinite
[1:18:10] one knew this hour must come but when it
[1:18:14] was fulfilled then you showed that you
[1:18:16] were God you showed who the boss was you
[1:18:19] shook the earth and the Saints that slip
[1:18:21] in the ground came out you blackened the
[1:18:24] Sun and the not as the darkness of night
[1:18:26] showing that you were God but you seemed
[1:18:30] to be solid
[1:18:32] let us draw this conclusion that as long
[1:18:35] as we're walking in the spirit led by
[1:18:38] the hand of God no matter what seems to
[1:18:40] be wrong yeah we are facing Calvary God
[1:18:45] will speak in the right hour in the
[1:18:50] right hour at the right time the Randi
[1:18:58] and one of your darkest times you call
[1:19:03] me you said I've grabbed a hold of one
[1:19:06] scripture and I hang on to that
[1:19:08] scripture and I quote that scripture and
