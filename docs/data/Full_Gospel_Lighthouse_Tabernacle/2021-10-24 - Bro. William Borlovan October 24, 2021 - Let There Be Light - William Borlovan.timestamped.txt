[43:51] with having to go out and preach
[43:52] services and things so it's nice they
[43:54] can go out
[43:55] and relax
[43:57] and enjoy the presence of the lord for a
[43:58] reset and i believe october is pastor
[44:00] appreciation mom and we certainly
[44:02] appreciate our pastors
[44:04] and everything they do for the church
[44:05] behind the scenes we appreciate their
[44:07] wives
[44:08] that put them back together
[44:10] and certainly
[44:12] drive them home at the end of a service
[44:13] and kind of help them come back down and
[44:16] and recharge for the next service so we
[44:18] certainly appreciate them very much
[44:20] so god bless you again this this um
[44:22] this morning if you would we'll just go
[44:24] straight to the word thank you musicians
[44:26] if you turn with me to genesis chapter 1
[44:32] you love the lord this morning
[44:34] amen how could you not love him
[44:37] he's so good
[44:38] genesis 1 we'll begin with the one verse
[44:40] the very very beginning of the bible
[44:44] the scripture reads
[44:45] in the beginning
[44:47] god created the heaven and the earth and
[44:50] the earth was without form and void and
[44:52] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[44:55] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[44:56] face of the waters
[44:58] and god said let there be light
[45:01] and there was light
[45:03] and god saw the light
[45:05] that it was good
[45:06] and god divided the light from the
[45:08] darkness
[45:10] and god called the light day
[45:12] and the darkness he called night
[45:15] and the evening and the morning were the
[45:16] first day if you'll drop down with me to
[45:18] verse 11
[45:20] and god said let the earth bring forth
[45:23] grass
[45:24] an herb yielding seed
[45:26] and fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[45:28] kind whose seed is in itself upon the
[45:32] earth and it was so
[45:34] and the earth brought forth grass and
[45:36] herb yielding seed after his kind and
[45:38] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[45:41] in itself after his kind
[45:43] and god saw that it was good amen let's
[45:45] borrow our heads and our hearts to come
[45:47] gracious heavenly father lord we now
[45:49] come to this part of the service father
[45:50] lord
[45:52] lord we just as we come in your presence
[45:53] we're a conscious lord that we're not in
[45:55] the presence of a man we're not in the
[45:56] presence of one another lord we're in
[45:58] the presence of your word which is you
[46:00] father
[46:01] lord this word is is a discerner of our
[46:03] thoughts and intents of the heart and
[46:05] lord we just pray and ask that you
[46:06] overshadow us with your holy spirit may
[46:08] lord may we just rebuke any spirit that
[46:10] will try and hinder the service in any
[46:12] way
[46:12] may faith and freedom and deliverance
[46:14] flow and your healing power father lord
[46:17] forgive us of our sins lord may you may
[46:19] i as a speaker lord
[46:21] lord as that beau lord as that violin
[46:23] lord that we know the story of lord all
[46:25] attitude may you take the
[46:27] my humanity lord may you just get me out
[46:29] of the way that the master can step in
[46:31] lord
[46:33] play something for us lord we love you
[46:36] and we'll give you all the praise on our
[46:37] glory
[46:38] in jesus christ's name amen amen god
[46:40] bless you you're seated i like with the
[46:42] help of the lord to speak this morning
[46:45] on the title of let there be light
[46:48] as we read in the scriptures we just
[46:49] keep this in mind that god created the
[46:52] heavens and the earth and he said let
[46:54] there be light and we know that the
[46:56] spoken word is the original seed so in
[46:59] order for god to prove that he was god
[47:02] light actually had to come
[47:04] if god would have said let there be
[47:06] light and light never would have showed
[47:08] up then that god would have been found
[47:10] as a liar and it is impossible for god
[47:13] to lie
[47:14] now one of the first things god did in
[47:16] creation when he created light is he
[47:18] separated god is a great separator he
[47:21] separated the light from the darkness
[47:24] and god is is brother barron called him
[47:27] a segregationalist not a segregationist
[47:29] of color or nationality but he separates
[47:32] his people because he called us to be a
[47:35] called out people
[47:36] he called us to not be of the world but
[47:39] he called us to come out of her my
[47:41] people so god likes to separate his
[47:44] children and to make a distinction that
[47:46] this is his people
[47:48] and his presence overshadows his people
[47:50] so god divided the light from the
[47:52] darkness and when god created heaven and
[47:54] earth the infinite mind of god is so
[47:56] eternal we and our humanity
[47:59] cannot grasp the infinite mind of god
[48:02] when god created the heavens and he
[48:04] created the earth and he said and he
[48:06] created it we don't know how long that
[48:08] took every seed
[48:10] every seed of botany life that was to
[48:12] ever be on the earth was already in the
[48:16] earth it was only covered by water and
[48:19] then god began in his majestic creation
[48:22] to separate and move the water off to
[48:24] one side and let the dry land appear but
[48:26] the seed was already laying there at the
[48:30] time of creation god knew when he spun
[48:32] things
[48:33] from from his from his mighty hand the
[48:35] pine tree where it would be and the oak
[48:37] tree and all these things because the
[48:38] bible tells us that every seed is going
[48:40] to bring forth of his kind
[48:43] and the power of the sea the power of
[48:46] life the power of the reproduction was
[48:48] actually within the seed itself that is
[48:51] where the power is the power doesn't
[48:53] come
[48:54] from an outside source yes it is fueled
[48:57] by the sun but the power lies within the
[49:00] seed itself
[49:02] so when god created the earth he not
[49:04] only had the seeds of botany life and
[49:07] things already there but he already had
[49:08] our bodies laying there because we come
[49:11] from the earth so everything that our
[49:13] natural
[49:14] physical bodies consist of was already
[49:17] laying here in the earth
[49:19] because whenever we were in our mother's
[49:21] womb our mother ate of the earth and she
[49:23] got the nutrients and our bodies
[49:25] developed within her
[49:27] and we are of the earth that is why from
[49:29] earth we come from to earth we go back
[49:32] again that is the nature that is the
[49:34] cycle of it
[49:36] so whenever god created it he already
[49:38] deposited it so the ingredients that i
[49:40] said of our bodies was already here in
[49:42] the earth so if that was the way
[49:43] naturally then that is that is the way
[49:45] god sets things up naturally then the
[49:48] natural things that god made
[49:50] is for a spiritual reflection
[49:52] so if god did things that way naturally
[49:54] for us and he had everything already
[49:56] taken care of and the acorn was always
[49:59] an acorn and the oak tree will always be
[50:01] an oak tree
[50:03] then he did the same thing spiritually
[50:06] he had you in his mind in seed form
[50:09] before the foundation of the world you
[50:11] always were a part of god and you'll
[50:14] always be a part of god
[50:16] and the sea that god placed within us we
[50:18] still need to be born again
[50:21] the oak can the acorn can have all the
[50:24] you know there's an infinite number of
[50:26] acorns a countless number of acorns
[50:29] within an acorn
[50:31] okay there's countless so the only way
[50:33] to really be able to to
[50:35] to be able to see the power that lays
[50:38] within the only way to be able to enjoy
[50:40] the shade of the oak tree is to plant
[50:43] the acorn
[50:44] and the power within that seed will then
[50:46] begin to express itself through stages
[50:49] and end up being a mighty
[50:52] beautiful thing that you can admire and
[50:54] go and enjoy
[50:55] the shade of so everything that we have
[50:58] need of
[50:59] god places a seed into the soul of very
[51:02] of every elected child of god and you
[51:05] were with him you weren't aware of it
[51:07] just as we weren't aware of being in our
[51:10] great great great great great grandad
[51:12] but yet that does not change the fact
[51:14] that you were there just because you
[51:16] don't remember it and you can't place it
[51:18] doesn't mean you weren't there
[51:20] so you can come you come into this world
[51:23] and you have the as an elected child of
[51:25] god you've got the the germ of god the
[51:27] seed in you but it needs to be quickened
[51:32] just like the acorn can have all the
[51:34] potentials of the mighty shade tree and
[51:36] a trunk so large you can't even wrap
[51:38] your arms around it
[51:40] but it's bottled up in a little bitty
[51:42] acorn that you can hold a child can hold
[51:44] in its hand
[51:45] but in the right environment that seed
[51:48] then becomes quickened
[51:50] and the power from the acorn then
[51:53] becomes an oak tree
[51:55] that is what the born-again experience
[51:57] does to an elected child of god
[52:00] they come into the world and they are an
[52:02] elected gene of god but yet they still
[52:05] have worldly desires yet they still have
[52:08] a pull for the things of the world
[52:09] because they were born the way that we
[52:11] were all born
[52:13] but because what separates god is a
[52:15] great separator what separates an
[52:17] elected child of god
[52:19] from everyone else is that seed
[52:21] potential within your soul that whenever
[52:24] you hear the word of god for your day
[52:26] brother nathaniel and that is the light
[52:28] of the day
[52:30] it then quickens something within you
[52:34] even if you're the only one in your
[52:35] family if you're the only one in your
[52:36] neighborhood if you're the only one in
[52:37] your school if you're the only one on
[52:39] the workplace it quickens something
[52:40] within you because it was already there
[52:44] but yet it has to go through its process
[52:48] and to be born again
[52:51] just because someone is an elected child
[52:52] of god they cannot bypass the new birth
[52:55] no more than you can enjoy the shade of
[52:57] an acorn you've got to go through the
[52:59] birth process
[53:02] satan is always trying to get people to
[53:04] dodge the new birth because it's an
[53:06] unpleasant thing
[53:08] because if you've got to die to yourself
[53:12] you've got to get past your own thinking
[53:14] as we heard last night a seed has got to
[53:16] rot and die before it can live
[53:19] so god watches over his seed
[53:22] god is obligated to his seed the word
[53:25] because as a seed of god you are god's
[53:28] family
[53:29] so the word of god searches out the holy
[53:32] spirit in every age the word will find
[53:35] you
[53:36] and the word begins to call out to you
[53:38] no matter how far you run and where you
[53:40] try and hide and what you try and do the
[53:42] word of god will find you and when the
[53:45] s-o-n light of god then begins to strike
[53:48] your soul and you that is how you prove
[53:51] your predestination that is how you
[53:53] prove your election not by natural
[53:55] genealogy but by the ability that when
[53:58] you hear the word of god for your age
[54:00] you come to life
[54:03] you come to life because the light you
[54:05] cannot stop a germatized seed from
[54:07] coming to life
[54:09] when it's planted in the ground and
[54:11] every one of us an elected child of god
[54:13] has got the seed of god in the earth
[54:16] our flesh is earth is from the earth but
[54:19] within the earth you can't see that
[54:22] attribute no matter if you have open
[54:24] heart surgery or whatever any kind of
[54:26] operation you cannot find that drum of
[54:28] life naturally
[54:30] only god knows
[54:32] but whenever just like you put that seed
[54:35] in the earth you know it's then
[54:36] germatized and it's not some gmo dead
[54:39] seed you know it's germatized because
[54:41] when you plant it sister heather it
[54:43] comes up and you know you've got
[54:44] something original
[54:46] so whenever the whenever you have a gene
[54:48] seed of god deposited in your soul
[54:51] you and and your people around you
[54:54] know that because of your because
[54:56] whenever the the light of the day the
[54:58] light of the hour strikes your soul it
[55:00] brings you to life
[55:03] if you're a rock it will not bring you
[55:05] to life
[55:06] but a seed has no choice but to come to
[55:09] life brother jerry you don't have you
[55:11] have a choice but yet god predestinated
[55:13] you
[55:14] so you can't help seeing it is what i'm
[55:17] trying to say
[55:18] because god called you to it
[55:21] in second corinthians 4 6 for god who
[55:23] commanded the light to shine out of
[55:25] darkness hath shined in our hearts to
[55:28] give the light of the knowledge of the
[55:30] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[55:34] so imagine telling someone
[55:37] that they're that imagine someone being
[55:38] in such a mental state that they are
[55:40] that they are denying
[55:41] that there's a sunshine outside
[55:44] that they that they refuse to see the
[55:46] sunlight that they don't believe you
[55:47] begin to try and describe to them of how
[55:49] warm it makes you feel and how wonderful
[55:51] it is
[55:52] and how it gives you light and how and
[55:54] how it does and able to grow your garden
[55:56] and they refuse and they go in the
[55:57] basement and refuse to believe that
[55:59] there's the sun outside yes you win
[56:02] there would be something mentally wrong
[56:03] with that person
[56:05] and there'd be something mentally wrong
[56:07] with spiritually wrong with a person
[56:08] that could that would deny
[56:11] the acts and the things that we've seen
[56:12] in this end time
[56:14] it is
[56:15] undeniable
[56:17] and god is obligated to you
[56:20] god will never fail you
[56:22] the devil may tell you that god has
[56:24] forgotten you
[56:25] but that's not true
[56:28] your human spirit will tell you god has
[56:30] forgotten you
[56:31] but that doesn't make it true
[56:34] until
[56:36] what god says is true and what god says
[56:38] that he would never leave you or forsake
[56:40] you
[56:41] now brother bran preached he referred to
[56:43] preaching about pastor lily you're you
[56:46] take you you listen to tapes you know
[56:48] that he talks about pastor lily a lily
[56:51] it's also called the lotus l-o-t-u-s
[56:56] and you can go online and look and there
[56:57] there there are some absolutely
[56:59] beautiful flowers
[57:00] now a lotus flower load of seed broth
[57:02] shannon it begins it has its origination
[57:05] not just in the earth but it has its
[57:08] origination in mud
[57:10] it has its origination at the bottom of
[57:13] a pond where all the silt settles
[57:16] where all the all the yuckiness of a
[57:18] pond as it was it all goes down there
[57:19] and settles and that is where this load
[57:21] of seed begins
[57:23] and as it begins to grow it grows and it
[57:26] stretches for the sunlight and it comes
[57:28] it can grow in up to eight feet of water
[57:30] and it goes but there's a driving force
[57:33] because it's a german because the
[57:34] germatized seed
[57:37] nothing can stop
[57:39] that flower from growing all the way up
[57:41] to the sunlight
[57:43] and when it gets to the sunlight it then
[57:45] blooms the most beautiful one of the
[57:46] most beautiful flowers you've ever seen
[57:49] and that's a lot like us
[57:52] we come from a very very muddy past
[57:54] we've come from a very very muddy
[57:56] beginning and many times whenever we but
[57:58] it takes the light of god to make us
[58:00] bloom
[58:01] and when we get there and we bloom in
[58:03] the presence of the sun
[58:05] people can see the the the the flower
[58:08] and the bees then begin to enjoy and the
[58:10] birds
[58:12] but they don't realize what it took you
[58:14] to get there
[58:16] they don't realize they enjoy the flower
[58:18] and we enjoy the beauty but you'd have
[58:19] to realize the mud that it came out of
[58:22] you we have to realize that it's the
[58:24] potential was within it to stretch for
[58:27] the sunlight
[58:29] now i was doing a little research on
[58:31] this lotus flower and we know that
[58:33] sometimes whenever you have a fruit tree
[58:35] if there's a drought it begins to you
[58:37] know can cast forth this fruit early
[58:39] it can be there's flowers
[58:42] we grew up in a nursery so i know just a
[58:44] few things about
[58:45] some flowers i forgot a lot but anyway
[58:47] there's a hydrangeas
[58:48] and we know that you can control the
[58:50] color of the bloom based on the acidity
[58:53] i don't remember which is which but you
[58:54] add lime or things you can make it blue
[58:56] and you can do things and it can be
[58:57] controlled by its environment
[58:59] if you want more roses you've got to
[59:00] plant them in the right type of type of
[59:02] soil the interesting thing about the
[59:04] lotus flowers they say are known
[59:06] to be think spiritually are known to be
[59:08] resistant to pollution
[59:12] and can even
[59:14] purify the water that they grow in
[59:17] you're not susceptible spiritually
[59:19] speaking when you come to the earth and
[59:22] you're reaching out and we were all born
[59:23] in mud and we all have a past that we're
[59:25] not happy about
[59:27] but there's no need in worrying about it
[59:29] there's no need in going back there's no
[59:30] need in caring that doesn't matter
[59:33] what matters is now that you've bloomed
[59:36] for the gospel of jesus christ you're
[59:38] god's flowers that's what matters now it
[59:40] doesn't matter what you came out of
[59:43] it doesn't matter what matters is that
[59:44] you have pressed forth and you've broken
[59:47] through and you're now living for jesus
[59:50] christ
[59:52] so eat so that you can even purify so
[59:55] you're not affected as a child of god as
[59:57] a holy ghost filled child of god when
[59:59] you go to school when you go to your
[1:00:00] workplace
[1:00:02] you're not affected by the pollution of
[1:00:03] the world you're not affected by your
[1:00:05] co-workers you in fact then give them
[1:00:08] something to enjoy because the
[1:00:10] atmosphere and presence that you have
[1:00:13] so each night they say they submerge
[1:00:14] into the murky water but each morning
[1:00:16] they re-bloom without the residue of
[1:00:20] their environment
[1:00:22] praise the lord
[1:00:24] they bloom
[1:00:25] and that's what we do despite what's
[1:00:27] going on in the world despite who's in
[1:00:28] the white house and how much we like it
[1:00:30] or how much we don't despite what the
[1:00:32] economy is doing despite what's
[1:00:33] happening to our 401ks we're blooming
[1:00:36] we're not we're not making our home down
[1:00:37] here we've got to plant our potatoes and
[1:00:39] do what you've got to do
[1:00:41] however we're looking up
[1:00:44] we're looking up so it took a lot of
[1:00:46] grace to get us from mud to bloom
[1:00:49] there's a lot of grace to take us from
[1:00:51] from down there to up here but we're not
[1:00:53] now that we don't go back to the mud we
[1:00:56] bloom in the presence of the sun
[1:00:59] now what is light
[1:01:01] now this morning we're speaking
[1:01:03] spiritually speaking we all know what
[1:01:05] light is naturally
[1:01:07] but everything in the natural is a type
[1:01:10] of the spiritual
[1:01:12] god made it made a buzzard
[1:01:14] to reflect the spiritual application
[1:01:16] but god made an eagle to reflect another
[1:01:18] spiritual application
[1:01:19] god made a crow to reflect one spiritual
[1:01:21] application and god made a dove to
[1:01:23] reflect another one it's mysteries
[1:01:25] that you can look at and we look at
[1:01:27] creation now and fall
[1:01:29] and see what god is doing so what is
[1:01:31] life
[1:01:32] brother adam says now if god said
[1:01:34] let there be light
[1:01:36] and there was no light that wasn't god
[1:01:38] said that see
[1:01:40] when god says anything he must back up
[1:01:44] what he says
[1:01:45] and when the word of god has been
[1:01:47] vindicated the word has been vindicated
[1:01:50] that
[1:01:51] is light
[1:01:53] now how does god vindicate his word he
[1:01:55] vindicates his word by bringing it to
[1:01:58] pass
[1:01:59] so when god said let there be light that
[1:02:01] was a sea that went out that was a
[1:02:02] spoken word that went out but when and
[1:02:05] so we don't know how long it took
[1:02:07] when god said let there be light he said
[1:02:10] it that was a seed
[1:02:11] but then whenever light appeared that
[1:02:13] then became a vindication that what god
[1:02:16] said was
[1:02:18] true so
[1:02:20] that is what real light is now the word
[1:02:22] itself the prophet speaking
[1:02:25] isn't light
[1:02:27] until it's a vindicated light
[1:02:30] so there's a process that it goes to
[1:02:32] from seed to light
[1:02:34] when it's spoken it's then a seed
[1:02:37] because the spoken word is the original
[1:02:38] seed but whenever it's manifested it's
[1:02:41] light let me give you an example god
[1:02:43] said that there'd be a church without
[1:02:44] spot or wrinkle
[1:02:45] that was a seed that was a spoken word
[1:02:48] is she here
[1:02:50] so then what does that make her
[1:02:52] the light of the hour
[1:02:55] that makes her the light of the day just
[1:02:57] as it made him the light jesus and we'll
[1:02:58] get to it here briefly but jesus was
[1:03:01] literally a manifestation of his own
[1:03:03] word
[1:03:05] so whenever the word prophesied that he
[1:03:07] would come forth it was then a seed it
[1:03:08] was circling the earth brother jason and
[1:03:10] then when it became when it when it
[1:03:13] planted itself in the in the virgin womb
[1:03:15] of mary and jesus
[1:03:17] breathed his first breath of air
[1:03:20] as our savior
[1:03:22] that was light
[1:03:24] because the word that was spoken is now
[1:03:26] made manifest
[1:03:28] so keep the title in mind let there be
[1:03:31] light
[1:03:32] so whenever we come to church and we
[1:03:33] hear the word preached
[1:03:35] it's for you
[1:03:37] when the word comes forth and it's for
[1:03:39] you the seed you grab it
[1:03:42] and you remember remember that parable
[1:03:43] that jesus spoke of the word is a seed
[1:03:46] so if we shout in the presence of god
[1:03:49] and amen and then we drop the seed right
[1:03:50] when we get to that back door
[1:03:52] it brings no fruit
[1:03:55] the seed has then got to be taken with
[1:03:57] us taken home
[1:03:59] and you don't put the you don't put the
[1:04:00] seed
[1:04:01] on your table you plant it
[1:04:04] you don't plant it in the natural earth
[1:04:05] you plant it in you you plant it in your
[1:04:08] soul in the ground of faith well a seed
[1:04:10] needs more than just dirt and seed also
[1:04:12] needs moisture
[1:04:14] and how do you how do you actually water
[1:04:16] the seed with praises with the holy
[1:04:18] ghost with faith with believing
[1:04:21] and then the sun shines on it
[1:04:23] and it will bring forth exactly what's
[1:04:26] already in the seed
[1:04:27] so if you need healing
[1:04:29] and you and and the healing is for you
[1:04:32] in the name of jesus christ healing is
[1:04:34] for you
[1:04:35] and if you say i believe that
[1:04:38] that it's not brother william's words
[1:04:40] it's god's word and you say i believe
[1:04:43] that and you take that seed and you take
[1:04:45] it with you and you let it get into your
[1:04:47] heart that is why we always have to
[1:04:49] prepare our hearts for service
[1:04:51] you don't just go in if you want to
[1:04:52] plant a garden and it's been winter and
[1:04:53] the grass is growing in the weeds you
[1:04:54] don't just go
[1:04:56] if you know anything about gardening you
[1:04:57] don't just throw seeds over all the
[1:04:59] weeds
[1:05:00] you got to till it first you got to
[1:05:01] prepare it first so that whenever the
[1:05:03] ground whenever you throw the seed on
[1:05:05] there you sow it it then you then can
[1:05:08] cover it up and expect a crop
[1:05:10] so we have to prepare our hearts how by
[1:05:13] prayer you pray for the minister you
[1:05:15] pray for the song leader you pray for
[1:05:16] the servants you pray for the saints and
[1:05:18] then whenever we come into his courts
[1:05:20] with thanksgiving in our hearts our
[1:05:22] heart is until
[1:05:23] and ready for the word
[1:05:26] that is how
[1:05:28] because remember if you come in here
[1:05:31] with a hard crusty spirit
[1:05:34] seed can't get in there when the spirit
[1:05:36] falls what happens whenever sometimes
[1:05:38] even when a drought happens
[1:05:39] and the water hits the earth it just
[1:05:41] runs off
[1:05:43] you want to be you want to be so open to
[1:05:45] the spirit you want to be so so plowed
[1:05:48] up dissed up
[1:05:50] to where whenever the word is preached
[1:05:52] that seed can fall in your heart don't
[1:05:54] let the birds get it
[1:05:56] don't go out and let the cares of this
[1:05:58] world choke up that seed
[1:06:00] because remember after the good after
[1:06:02] that good sorrow went and sowed seed
[1:06:04] whenever you go out there and you face
[1:06:06] monday morning on the job or in school
[1:06:09] you then have the enemy coming and sow
[1:06:11] seeds of doubt
[1:06:13] sow seeds of this sow seeds of that and
[1:06:15] if you aren't careful and you don't keep
[1:06:17] them plucked out they're going to grow
[1:06:19] faster weeds why is it that weeds always
[1:06:20] grow quicker than your crop but it does
[1:06:24] so then weeds of doubt will try and
[1:06:26] spring up and choke out
[1:06:29] the promise that you accepted
[1:06:31] then it don't become fruitful
[1:06:33] so it's god laying in the sunlight so
[1:06:35] when god said let there be light and it
[1:06:37] was vindicated then that is light
[1:06:40] in john 1 in the beginning was the word
[1:06:44] and the word was with god and the word
[1:06:46] was god the same was in the beginning
[1:06:48] with god all things were made by him and
[1:06:50] without him was not anything made that
[1:06:52] was made
[1:06:53] in him was life
[1:06:56] in him was the light of men
[1:06:58] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:07:00] the darkness comprehendeth it not
[1:07:03] jesus is the light of the world
[1:07:06] there was a man sent from god whose name
[1:07:08] was john
[1:07:09] the same came for a witness
[1:07:12] to bear witness of the light
[1:07:15] that all men through him
[1:07:18] might believe
[1:07:21] he was not that light but he was sent to
[1:07:24] bear witness of that light now john was
[1:07:26] jesus later identifies him as a light
[1:07:29] but what the scripture is saying is that
[1:07:30] he wasn't the
[1:07:32] light
[1:07:34] jesus christ is the light of the world
[1:07:37] so if john the if jesus had a forerunner
[1:07:39] the first time he came why do people
[1:07:41] have a problem with him having a
[1:07:42] forerunner the second time he came
[1:07:45] if john was a bright and shining light
[1:07:47] why do people have a problem with god
[1:07:49] sending a prophet to be a bright and
[1:07:50] shining light
[1:07:52] what god does once he's got to keep
[1:07:54] doing
[1:07:56] jesus said in john 5 35 he was talking
[1:07:59] to john he was a bright
[1:08:01] and shining light
[1:08:03] they were willing to walk for a season
[1:08:06] willing for a season to rejoice in his
[1:08:08] life
[1:08:09] now the message of the hour
[1:08:12] we call it the message of the hour
[1:08:14] because it is the light of the hour
[1:08:18] whenever the sun rises in every hour
[1:08:21] across the horizon the sun is in a
[1:08:22] different position so if you want light
[1:08:26] you have to be where the sun is
[1:08:29] so if that is the way naturally speaking
[1:08:31] if you want spiritual light you have to
[1:08:33] be brother mike you've got to be where
[1:08:36] the sun s-o-n is
[1:08:39] you cannot be if the sun
[1:08:42] is way over there in the horizon and
[1:08:44] it's getting ready to set we cannot be
[1:08:46] here in elkton virginia
[1:08:47] upset that the sun is getting ready to
[1:08:50] set and we want the sun to be here if
[1:08:52] you want the light you've got to go west
[1:08:55] so to be in the light
[1:08:57] you've got to be where the light is
[1:09:00] now that's really simple but when you
[1:09:02] really think about it spiritually that
[1:09:03] is actually a pretty a pretty profound
[1:09:06] thought
[1:09:07] you've got because the message like i
[1:09:08] said is the light of the hour it is the
[1:09:10] first step
[1:09:12] in the second coming of the lord jesus
[1:09:13] christ
[1:09:15] and we are a superbly blessed people to
[1:09:18] be made privy of this
[1:09:20] because the church world is expecting
[1:09:22] jesus to break the eastern sky and to
[1:09:24] come down and for the resurrection to be
[1:09:26] on fox news the second coming of the
[1:09:28] lord is a secret
[1:09:31] and so whenever god sent a prophet he is
[1:09:34] tipping us off to this
[1:09:37] so
[1:09:38] how do we know
[1:09:40] because when god sent this message to us
[1:09:42] it is jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:09:45] today and forever
[1:09:47] it is literally a repetition an exact
[1:09:49] repetition brother shannon
[1:09:51] of the very ministry that jesus christ
[1:09:53] had the first time
[1:09:55] the word foretold that this message
[1:09:58] would come
[1:09:59] just like the word foretold that the
[1:10:02] messiah would be born of a virgin
[1:10:06] jesus himself referred
[1:10:08] to brother browner
[1:10:11] you say how he when he was speaking to
[1:10:12] his disciples in matthew 17
[1:10:14] and his disciples asked him saying
[1:10:17] why then say the scribes that elias must
[1:10:20] first come
[1:10:22] and jesus answered and said unto them
[1:10:24] elias truly shall
[1:10:28] that's in the future
[1:10:29] first come and restore
[1:10:32] all things
[1:10:33] now when john the baptist introduced
[1:10:35] jesus christ did he introduce
[1:10:38] a part of jesus
[1:10:40] just or did he introduce all of jesus
[1:10:43] christ
[1:10:45] he introduced all he jesus wasn't just
[1:10:47] an old testament prophet an old
[1:10:49] testament prophet was a part of god
[1:10:50] moses was a part of god noah was part of
[1:10:52] god
[1:10:54] david was a part of god but when jesus
[1:10:56] came he was all of god amen so if john
[1:11:00] the baptist
[1:11:01] introduced all of god
[1:11:04] then so will elijah come and in this day
[1:11:06] introduce jesus christ fully
[1:11:09] so in verse 12 but i say unto you now
[1:11:11] he's speaking of john the baptist that
[1:11:13] elijah is come already
[1:11:16] and they knew him not
[1:11:18] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:11:20] listened listed likewise also shall the
[1:11:23] son of man suffer of them
[1:11:25] this message is identified with the
[1:11:27] pillar of fire
[1:11:29] just like jesus was
[1:11:32] this message brought the exact same
[1:11:34] ministry just as he did the first time
[1:11:37] what you read about in the pages of the
[1:11:39] bible
[1:11:40] think about what a blessed people we are
[1:11:42] how many millions of people brother
[1:11:44] thomas do people read
[1:11:47] in the scriptures
[1:11:48] and say i wish god still did that
[1:11:51] i wish i lived in bible days again
[1:11:54] i wish that i could see the eyes
[1:11:57] of the blind open
[1:12:00] but we read it and we can say amen he
[1:12:02] does it in our day
[1:12:04] god sent the word he does the exact same
[1:12:06] thing we are living in bible days this
[1:12:09] is the greatest hour to be living in
[1:12:12] this is the greatest hour to be walking
[1:12:14] around with a promise in our hearts
[1:12:16] brother joe that we're actually
[1:12:18] expecting a body change
[1:12:22] we're actually expecting a body change
[1:12:25] we're actually expecting our loved ones
[1:12:28] the ones that are dead in christ to
[1:12:30] raise from the dead we believe that
[1:12:32] we're walking in that faith
[1:12:36] because of the word that's been sent to
[1:12:38] us
[1:12:39] because we know there's a land beyond
[1:12:41] the river
[1:12:42] because god allowed his prophet to go
[1:12:44] there
[1:12:45] remember what he said he said that when
[1:12:46] i wa he said we always thought he said
[1:12:47] before the opening of the seals he said
[1:12:49] we thought that everyone would go up
[1:12:51] there and play harps and and just float
[1:12:53] around on clouds and he'd see brother
[1:12:55] neville but couldn't shake his hand but
[1:12:56] when god translated him he realized
[1:12:58] there he can touch him he can hug him
[1:13:02] he's seen his converts there he's seen
[1:13:04] you there he's seen me there
[1:13:07] god allowed him to be caught up brother
[1:13:09] jeffrey and see that and then to come
[1:13:11] back and say there's a land beyond the
[1:13:13] river
[1:13:14] when his first wife passed away he says
[1:13:17] remember she told him she said brother
[1:13:19] bill why'd you call me back
[1:13:22] she said you preached about it
[1:13:24] you've talked about it but you don't
[1:13:25] know what it is
[1:13:28] she was experiencing something at that
[1:13:30] time that the prophet himself didn't
[1:13:32] know
[1:13:34] he believed him but he didn't know but
[1:13:35] there came a time
[1:13:37] that he that god took him up and he was
[1:13:39] able to see
[1:13:41] sister mita think about this he's seen
[1:13:44] sister mita and her theophany while
[1:13:45] sister mita was asleep next to him she
[1:13:47] wasn't crossed over
[1:13:50] so whenever he was caught there he was
[1:13:53] caught there because god needed a
[1:13:54] representative brother to come back and
[1:13:57] tell us that place is real don't stop
[1:14:01] whatever you do get perfect love
[1:14:05] because nothing but perfect love is
[1:14:07] going to get in there and the bible says
[1:14:08] if you say you love god but hate your
[1:14:11] brother you're in darkness
[1:14:13] so love is connected to light
[1:14:17] so we had
[1:14:19] god allowed us to have a prophet
[1:14:22] to come back and say that place is real
[1:14:25] that place is real don't you stop it
[1:14:26] gave him such a renewed passion to
[1:14:29] preach his gospel like never before
[1:14:32] this message has got three pulls
[1:14:34] just like jesus did
[1:14:36] this message is rejected like jesus did
[1:14:40] was people love the fishes and the
[1:14:43] loaves
[1:14:44] people love the miracles
[1:14:46] but when he turned around one day
[1:14:49] brother don and he said i and my father
[1:14:51] are one
[1:14:53] who
[1:14:54] that got him
[1:14:57] everybody loved the prophet
[1:14:59] everybody loved the miracles everybody
[1:15:00] loved the money to bring in everybody
[1:15:02] loved the crowds but whenever he then
[1:15:04] stood up and began to preach his
[1:15:06] doctrine the doctrine of jesus christ it
[1:15:08] wasn't his they rejected him
[1:15:13] that's how you know jesus christ is the
[1:15:15] same yesterday today and forever because
[1:15:16] it repeats itself remember spirits
[1:15:19] people die but spirits don't
[1:15:22] the spirits that crucified jesus christ
[1:15:24] when he was here on the earth and
[1:15:26] literally nailed them to a cross in them
[1:15:28] pharisees are not in them spirit them
[1:15:30] the flesh man is gone
[1:15:32] but the spirit is still here and it
[1:15:34] still crucifies the word of the hour
[1:15:41] this message makes us aware and lifts
[1:15:43] our spiritual amnesia
[1:15:45] it lists our spiritual amnesia and it
[1:15:47] tells us where we came from and where
[1:15:48] we're going
[1:15:49] it takes us all the way from where were
[1:15:51] you when i lay the foundations of the
[1:15:54] earth and the sons of god shouted for
[1:15:55] joy it takes you from there you know
[1:15:57] where you are
[1:15:59] you were in the mind of god
[1:16:02] before the foundations of the world were
[1:16:04] laid you are already in his mind
[1:16:07] it takes us from there
[1:16:09] all the way to behold i create a new
[1:16:11] heavens and new earth
[1:16:13] we can see the entire picture because he
[1:16:15] is unveiled before us
[1:16:18] he's available for us in luke 17
[1:16:22] very familiar scripture for jesus
[1:16:24] speaking here
[1:16:25] for as the lightning that lighteth out
[1:16:27] of the one part under heaven shineth
[1:16:30] unto the other part under the heaven so
[1:16:32] shall the son of man be in his day
[1:16:35] but first he must suffer many things and
[1:16:37] be rejected of this generation
[1:16:39] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[1:16:42] it be in the days of the son of man they
[1:16:44] did eat they drank they married wives
[1:16:45] they were given in marriage until the
[1:16:47] day that noah entered into the ark and
[1:16:49] the flood came and destroyed them all
[1:16:51] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:16:53] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[1:16:55] they sold they planted they build it
[1:16:58] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:16:59] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:17:01] heaven
[1:17:02] and destroy them all
[1:17:04] even
[1:17:05] thus
[1:17:07] shall it be jesus was speaking of a
[1:17:09] future day
[1:17:10] that's this day
[1:17:12] even thus
[1:17:14] shall it be
[1:17:15] when the son of man is revealed
[1:17:17] it's very important to understand that
[1:17:20] god didn't send us a prophet just for
[1:17:21] head knowledge saints
[1:17:23] we it gives us faith and understanding
[1:17:26] you say why is it so important to
[1:17:27] understand well in the bible there was a
[1:17:29] sarah phoenician woman who needed
[1:17:31] something
[1:17:33] her daughter was grievously vexed with
[1:17:34] the devil
[1:17:36] and she approached god and called him
[1:17:38] thou son of david well she was a gentile
[1:17:41] and she didn't get what she wanted until
[1:17:42] she became god's provided way
[1:17:45] of worship
[1:17:47] god wants to be worshipped a certain way
[1:17:49] and that is where we've got to get
[1:17:50] beyond our own thinking the world has
[1:17:52] got to get beyond their own thinking
[1:17:54] they can't have you we can't have a cain
[1:17:55] mentality say it's got to be this way or
[1:17:57] i'm sorry
[1:17:59] wherever god is that's where i want to
[1:18:01] be wherever the light is that's where i
[1:18:04] want to be because if you're not in the
[1:18:05] light you're in darkness and when you're
[1:18:07] in darkness you're going to stumble
[1:18:09] it's only human nature whenever they're
[1:18:11] lost and you hear stories of people
[1:18:13] getting stranded and they're lost and
[1:18:14] they're stranded for
[1:18:16] you know for days in the wilderness and
[1:18:18] just pitch blackness when they see the
[1:18:19] slightest little light
[1:18:22] they're attracted to it
[1:18:24] because that means there's a hope
[1:18:27] for being found
[1:18:28] that means there's a hope for rescue
[1:18:30] when they're out at sea and the storms
[1:18:31] are raging and they get a glimpse of
[1:18:33] that shoreline no matter how the waves
[1:18:35] are tossed and they get a glimpse of a
[1:18:36] lighthouse then they then know to
[1:18:39] go there
[1:18:41] so how much more spiritually
[1:18:43] if you're in darkness whenever you see
[1:18:45] the light this bright and shining light
[1:18:47] that you actually run to it
[1:18:51] now remember brother mark made a comment
[1:18:53] yesterday about the light that the light
[1:18:55] should be used to light the scripture
[1:18:57] not to be blinded at
[1:18:59] god sent us a prophet to be a light on
[1:19:01] the scripture
[1:19:03] not
[1:19:05] to concentrate on
[1:19:07] and ignore the scripture
[1:19:10] remember the story of the statue of
[1:19:11] liberty when brother went up there and
[1:19:13] there were little dead little birds
[1:19:14] everywhere and he asked the god what
[1:19:16] what is it he said we had an awful storm
[1:19:18] last night
[1:19:20] and he said instead of using the light
[1:19:23] to guide them
[1:19:24] they were flying into the light
[1:19:28] and they got killed
[1:19:30] god has sent light upon the scripture so
[1:19:33] that we'll know how to walk in
[1:19:35] so you hear the term son of man son of
[1:19:37] man god comes in three sons names
[1:19:40] and it's important because that is what
[1:19:42] has the church world all confuses
[1:19:44] because they believe there's three gods
[1:19:45] how is it that god god the father and
[1:19:47] god the son it's simply dispensations
[1:19:51] and it's a dispensation it's just how
[1:19:53] god deals with his people for a certain
[1:19:55] period of time
[1:19:57] so whenever god came to the earth in
[1:19:59] jesus christ he kept calling himself son
[1:20:01] of man son of man because he was the god
[1:20:04] prophet in the old testament the
[1:20:05] prophets were called son of man son of
[1:20:08] man
[1:20:09] well then they crucified the son of man
[1:20:13] well he died
[1:20:14] he took our sins to hell and he ascended
[1:20:16] well where was god then
[1:20:20] god changed masks
[1:20:22] he then
[1:20:23] stepped into the dispensation of the son
[1:20:25] of god the holy spirit
[1:20:27] and he then could come and live in you
[1:20:30] it's the same god that just changes his
[1:20:32] sensation his brother and dramatized it
[1:20:34] the same when he went to that play and
[1:20:36] the same actor just changed mass that's
[1:20:38] all god does
[1:20:40] so he's son of god holy ghost he dealt
[1:20:42] with the church ages with the holy
[1:20:43] spirit and then in the millennium
[1:20:46] jesus christ who's now the holy ghost
[1:20:49] will come down and we will physically
[1:20:51] literally see him in his corporal body
[1:20:54] and he will literally be ruling and
[1:20:56] reigning with us for a thousand years
[1:20:58] jesus christ will literally be on the
[1:21:00] earth you can literally touch him you'll
[1:21:03] literally spill the nail prints in his
[1:21:04] hands
[1:21:06] there's a lot of things we won't
[1:21:08] remember none of our past we won't
[1:21:09] remember none of the mud you won't
[1:21:10] remember nothing
[1:21:13] but one thing that god i believe will
[1:21:15] allow us to remember
[1:21:17] is them nail prints
[1:21:20] he's going to leave that
[1:21:22] nail prints in his hands
[1:21:24] and a scar in his side
[1:21:27] as a memorial of what he did for us
[1:21:31] remember when he makes himself known to
[1:21:32] the jews and they ask him where did you
[1:21:34] get them scars
[1:21:35] what happened
[1:21:37] he said in the house of my friends
[1:21:39] he didn't say and you are the ones that
[1:21:41] killed me you jews
[1:21:42] he said in the house
[1:21:44] of my friends
[1:21:46] love covers a multitude of sins
[1:21:49] so he came the first time as son of man
[1:21:52] he's then in the church ages as son of
[1:21:54] god
[1:21:55] and he'll be in the millennium as son of
[1:21:57] david but it's jesus christ the same
[1:22:00] yesterday today and forever
[1:22:02] now he was son of man here
[1:22:05] he was son of god here
[1:22:08] and he'll be son of david but in between
[1:22:11] son of god and son of david he returns
[1:22:14] back
[1:22:16] in the son of man ministry
[1:22:18] and that is what this church is built on
[1:22:21] on the son of man ministry revealing
[1:22:24] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:22:26] and forever doing the exact same works
[1:22:28] that he did when he came the first time
[1:22:30] as son of man
[1:22:32] jesus said even thus shall it be in the
[1:22:35] days when the son of man is revealed
[1:22:39] but it's a secret coming the church
[1:22:41] world knows him as the son of god and
[1:22:42] they're looking for him to come as son
[1:22:44] of david they don't see this son of man
[1:22:46] ministry
[1:22:47] with the same sign jesus himself said as
[1:22:49] it was in the days of lot as it was in
[1:22:52] the days of sodom and gomorrah the same
[1:22:55] sign
[1:22:56] is given
[1:22:59] god veiled behind flesh brother branham
[1:23:01] was not god
[1:23:03] but god came and stepped into his
[1:23:05] prophet would turn around
[1:23:07] with his back to the people and begin to
[1:23:09] discern thoughts
[1:23:13] who was that he wasn't a man it's the
[1:23:16] son of man ministry again but you know
[1:23:19] that ministry is not to the world he had
[1:23:21] opportunities to fly on airplanes he had
[1:23:24] opportunities to be televised nationally
[1:23:26] but he wouldn't sell out
[1:23:30] because
[1:23:31] it was not meant for the world it was
[1:23:34] meant for the bride it's the bridegroom
[1:23:37] call it's the
[1:23:39] come here
[1:23:40] it's the latter that romeo put up to
[1:23:42] juliet's window
[1:23:45] that's what this message is
[1:23:47] and we're such a blessed people to be
[1:23:49] made aware of it and to understand and
[1:23:51] to hear the bridegroom call and to walk
[1:23:54] in the light of the hour it's where god
[1:23:56] is
[1:23:57] i want to be where he is
[1:24:00] so if people can break and get beyond
[1:24:02] their own thinking and if he don't come
[1:24:04] in my methodist box then i don't want
[1:24:06] then i'm sorry or if he didn't come out
[1:24:08] of the pentecostals
[1:24:11] or he don't come from this church or
[1:24:12] that church it doesn't matter god
[1:24:15] bypassed the entire thing
[1:24:18] and went and got a seventh grade
[1:24:20] education
[1:24:22] man from kentucky with common complexes
[1:24:24] just like you have just like i have
[1:24:27] and he
[1:24:28] and he took that humble man and he
[1:24:30] raised him up and gave him and the angel
[1:24:33] of the lord would come to him and give
[1:24:34] him such inspiration and divine
[1:24:37] revelation that it would astound
[1:24:39] theologians
[1:24:41] when jesus was 12 years old he went
[1:24:44] remember when they lost him in jerusalem
[1:24:46] there at the feast
[1:24:48] he had he had he had the the high priest
[1:24:51] and he had an educated people absolutely
[1:24:53] just confounded
[1:24:55] with the wisdom
[1:24:56] he didn't get that from himself
[1:25:01] so praise the lord for the light
[1:25:04] in zechariah 14 7 but it shall be one
[1:25:06] day which shall be known to the lord not
[1:25:09] day nor night but it shall come to pass
[1:25:10] that at the evening time
[1:25:13] it shall be light
[1:25:16] this is the light of the hour walking in
[1:25:19] it children
[1:25:21] walking in it
[1:25:22] when god moves
[1:25:24] you move and that goes that way that's
[1:25:27] from a church age that's even in your
[1:25:28] own life
[1:25:30] when god is trying to take you to a
[1:25:31] higher level follow him
[1:25:34] john 12 46 i am come enlightened to the
[1:25:37] world that whosoever believeth on me
[1:25:38] should not abide
[1:25:40] in darkness
[1:25:43] as i said earlier that god does natural
[1:25:45] things that we can look
[1:25:46] and it condenses great mysteries
[1:25:50] just like the sun rises from east to
[1:25:52] west it cannot be denied by the biggest
[1:25:55] atheist there is it cannot be denied
[1:25:57] that the sun rises in the east and sets
[1:25:58] in the west amen
[1:26:00] well as the sun does that
[1:26:03] so does the spiritual sign
[1:26:06] as the sun raises in the east and sets
[1:26:08] in the west so god shine his word on the
[1:26:11] eastern people first
[1:26:13] and it begin to move west and it began
[1:26:15] to move west as god unfolded himself he
[1:26:18] started in the book of acts there that
[1:26:20] was on the eastern people the apostle
[1:26:22] paul and then it moved over the
[1:26:23] reformation and it kept moving then john
[1:26:25] wesley was a little further west and
[1:26:26] then it crossed the sea in this end time
[1:26:30] and brother william branham came out of
[1:26:31] america
[1:26:32] you can't go no further west
[1:26:34] you're back east again so that means
[1:26:36] we're at the end time
[1:26:39] as the as the light shines
[1:26:43] so does the spiritual light
[1:26:45] so if jesus christ was the light of the
[1:26:47] world the light of the world and it was
[1:26:49] a vindication of the word what does that
[1:26:51] make if he being the head what does that
[1:26:54] make the body
[1:26:55] the same thing
[1:26:57] where the head goes the body must follow
[1:27:02] so if he was the light of the world
[1:27:05] you're the light of the world
[1:27:07] you're the city that's set on a hill
[1:27:08] that cannot be hid
[1:27:13] in saint john 3
[1:27:16] now this is this this is jesus speaking
[1:27:18] he's not pulling any punches
[1:27:20] he said he that believeth on him
[1:27:23] is not condemned
[1:27:25] he but he that believeth not
[1:27:28] is condemned already
[1:27:30] because he hath not believed in the name
[1:27:33] of the only begotten son of god
[1:27:36] and this is the condemnation
[1:27:40] that light is coming to the world
[1:27:42] and man love darkness rather than light
[1:27:45] because their deeds were evil
[1:27:48] that there judges the entire do you
[1:27:50] realize that that statement there by
[1:27:51] jesus christ himself judges the entire
[1:27:53] church world
[1:27:55] whenever god sent this message he didn't
[1:27:57] do it in a corner
[1:27:58] he took his profit from from the hills
[1:28:00] of kentucky but that's not where he
[1:28:02] performed the miracles uh his entire
[1:28:04] ministry that's not where it's not in
[1:28:06] some corner it's to the world
[1:28:09] these you know so many message churches
[1:28:11] now are broadcasting their services to
[1:28:13] the whole world the prophet sermons are
[1:28:15] being translated and going to the whole
[1:28:16] world we're not ashamed of this gospel
[1:28:19] but the condemnation is that light was
[1:28:22] presented to them
[1:28:24] but yet they chose darkness instead of
[1:28:27] the light that's where the condemnation
[1:28:28] comes in
[1:28:29] is whenever they're presented with the
[1:28:31] truth
[1:28:32] and they choose darkness over light
[1:28:37] jesus makes a very interesting statement
[1:28:39] in luke 11 35 he says take heed
[1:28:42] therefore that the light which is in
[1:28:44] thee be not darkness
[1:28:47] so that sounds kind of strange how can
[1:28:49] light be darkness well
[1:28:50] the pharisees and the sadducees have the
[1:28:53] law of moses
[1:28:55] that was the light of the hour at one
[1:28:56] point
[1:28:58] but then whenever the the that light
[1:29:01] came
[1:29:03] they crucified it
[1:29:05] so the light that they thought they had
[1:29:07] of moses and the sabbath-keeping and all
[1:29:09] the laws and commandments it then became
[1:29:11] darkness to them because they rejected
[1:29:13] the light when it came
[1:29:16] so the each of these denominations now
[1:29:18] some of you school teachers
[1:29:19] can probably help me up front here but
[1:29:21] the denominator is a part of a uh and i
[1:29:25] may not get this right forgive me but
[1:29:26] just generally speaking a denominator is
[1:29:28] kind of like a part of a fraction of an
[1:29:31] entire number something along them lines
[1:29:33] close enough okay
[1:29:34] so we understand that a denomination
[1:29:38] is part
[1:29:40] of a hole
[1:29:42] you can't i don't recommend it but you
[1:29:44] can sit in a denominational church and
[1:29:45] find something to say amen about
[1:29:49] the brother can come out and he can say
[1:29:51] something jesus christ the son of god
[1:29:53] believe on the name of the lord jesus
[1:29:54] christ
[1:29:55] you know and be saved and all these
[1:29:57] things and you can you can find
[1:29:58] something to say amen about
[1:30:01] but yet
[1:30:02] there's not
[1:30:04] full light it's not total light but we
[1:30:08] want to walk in light we don't want
[1:30:09] because see
[1:30:10] each denomination has got a portion of
[1:30:13] light
[1:30:14] and when that light came they said well
[1:30:16] this is it this is what we believe and
[1:30:18] even though god moved on they wouldn't
[1:30:20] follow the light
[1:30:22] so the light they had became darkness
[1:30:26] the light they had now became darkness
[1:30:28] and now they're you know giving away
[1:30:29] free hot dogs for for for membership or
[1:30:32] doing whatever
[1:30:34] has anyone here
[1:30:36] ever gotten a car from brother ron or
[1:30:38] from andrew saying please come to church
[1:30:42] would you promise to come to church at
[1:30:44] least three months out of the year
[1:30:49] it's laughable
[1:30:52] it's laughable
[1:30:53] why because the word draws you here
[1:30:56] the word is what draws you here
[1:30:59] there's a deep that's calling to the
[1:31:01] deep and because he said where the
[1:31:04] carcass is the eagles will be gathered
[1:31:05] together
[1:31:07] now if you're not feeling good or you
[1:31:08] may you know they may check up on you
[1:31:10] that's not what i'm saying that's just
[1:31:11] love and that's just you know you okay
[1:31:13] and let us know if you need anything
[1:31:14] that's different but i'm talking about
[1:31:15] commitment cards or something silly like
[1:31:17] that
[1:31:18] never have never will
[1:31:21] because if the word doesn't satisfy your
[1:31:23] soul there's nothing for you here
[1:31:25] there's nothing for you here but the
[1:31:27] word
[1:31:28] if you can't take eagle food
[1:31:31] let me put it this way
[1:31:33] there's no you know when you have
[1:31:34] chickens and things there's always
[1:31:35] scraps off the dinner table and there's
[1:31:37] potato peels and there's carrot shavings
[1:31:38] or whatever there's none of that here
[1:31:41] there's there's no chicken food here
[1:31:43] this is this is carcass this is meat
[1:31:46] we're meat eaters here no offense to any
[1:31:48] vegetarians we are spiritual
[1:31:50] meat eaters
[1:31:52] we're meat eaters here the eagles got a
[1:31:54] beak to rip
[1:31:57] the chicken has got a little scratch
[1:31:58] here but we have a beak
[1:32:01] and we want meat
[1:32:03] we want the word of the hour we want the
[1:32:05] fresh kill and whenever we circle
[1:32:08] we circle and we we see where there's a
[1:32:10] fresh kill that's where the eagles come
[1:32:12] right where the light is
[1:32:14] the buzzers they're looking for
[1:32:15] something dead they're looking for that
[1:32:17] that
[1:32:18] stench
[1:32:20] they're looking for that that's what
[1:32:22] that's what gets them going
[1:32:24] we've only got fresh meat here we've got
[1:32:26] fresh meat over here
[1:32:28] jesus said no man when he lighted a
[1:32:31] candle put it in a secret place
[1:32:33] when your light gets lit sister whitney
[1:32:36] when your light gets lit you're going to
[1:32:38] tell somebody about it you want to let
[1:32:39] others know hey
[1:32:41] i may not be able to explain how it
[1:32:42] happened but this is how my light got
[1:32:45] lit and then you begin
[1:32:47] to shine your light
[1:32:49] neither putteth under a bushel but on a
[1:32:51] candlestick that all which come in may
[1:32:53] see the light
[1:32:56] in saint john 8 31
[1:32:59] this is also
[1:33:00] very very important and that judges the
[1:33:02] entire church world
[1:33:05] then
[1:33:06] jesus said to those jews which believed
[1:33:08] on him now let's read that real slow
[1:33:10] then jesus said
[1:33:12] to those jews which believed on him they
[1:33:14] weren't unbelievers they weren't people
[1:33:16] at that time ready to crucify him
[1:33:19] they were believers they were following
[1:33:20] the ministry
[1:33:22] he then said if
[1:33:25] ye continue in my word
[1:33:29] then
[1:33:30] are you my disciples indeed
[1:33:33] that's crucial
[1:33:35] because he knew that he only had a
[1:33:37] certain amount of time left and then he
[1:33:39] would have a body that would pick up and
[1:33:41] that he would then begin to do the works
[1:33:42] through his church so he knew that the
[1:33:44] elect of that age would be in the upper
[1:33:46] room he then knew that they would be
[1:33:47] with paul he knew they'd be with peter
[1:33:49] and they would follow the word if you
[1:33:51] continue in my word so how many people
[1:33:54] that call themselves christians
[1:33:57] call themselves a disciple of jesus
[1:33:59] christ and they don't continue
[1:34:02] in the word
[1:34:04] jesus said
[1:34:07] we're in first john
[1:34:09] he said if you walk in the light
[1:34:13] that god is light and in him is no
[1:34:15] darkness at all
[1:34:16] but if ye walk in the light
[1:34:19] as he is in the light
[1:34:23] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:34:25] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[1:34:28] from all sin
[1:34:30] that's how you're a real disciple of
[1:34:32] jesus christ
[1:34:34] is whenever the word unfolds
[1:34:36] and you go with it
[1:34:38] that proves
[1:34:40] that you're seed because you're growing
[1:34:42] amen
[1:34:43] do you know how you know you're born
[1:34:45] again
[1:34:47] is when you grow
[1:34:50] is when
[1:34:51] real spiritual birth
[1:34:53] real growth
[1:34:56] not you know you do better for your
[1:34:58] neighbor now than you did last year
[1:35:00] about this time or you give them or or
[1:35:01] you do something that you wouldn't
[1:35:03] normally that's that's just good works
[1:35:04] and that has this place i'm talking real
[1:35:06] spiritual maturity and growth where you
[1:35:08] can look down
[1:35:09] you you lotus flower can look down and
[1:35:11] say oh
[1:35:12] i came from a muddy beginning
[1:35:15] i really had a stretch forth for the sun
[1:35:18] but now i'm a bloom for jesus christ
[1:35:22] i'm a bloom for jesus christ and someone
[1:35:24] can come by and enjoy
[1:35:25] the beauty
[1:35:27] not the beauty within yourself but the
[1:35:29] beauty of the character of jesus christ
[1:35:32] the secret to having
[1:35:34] is giving
[1:35:37] if you want more of god
[1:35:39] give more of your time to him
[1:35:42] if you want more time
[1:35:45] because it all seems to be getting away
[1:35:47] from us
[1:35:48] then give more time to god
[1:35:51] if you want more blessings
[1:35:54] invest more in the kingdom i'm not i'm
[1:35:55] not talking monetarily here necessarily
[1:35:57] i'm talking with your time with your
[1:35:59] prayers
[1:36:00] prayer is so important
[1:36:03] prayer is so important how many times
[1:36:05] will brother branham give credit to the
[1:36:07] success of his meetings to some widow
[1:36:09] woman praying somewhere
[1:36:11] how many times would he give success to
[1:36:12] brother kidd and all in his ministry to
[1:36:15] his wife cracking corn on on the
[1:36:17] railroad tracks and things
[1:36:21] it's prayer that does
[1:36:22] it you can't do nothing apart from
[1:36:25] prayer
[1:36:26] and brother ram said in in
[1:36:30] in christ is revealed in his own word
[1:36:31] now the greek word for revelation is
[1:36:34] apocalypse which means unveiling
[1:36:36] the unveiling is perfectly described in
[1:36:38] the example of a sculpture unveiling his
[1:36:40] work of statuary exposing it to the
[1:36:43] onlooker it is uncovering revealing what
[1:36:45] was previously hidden
[1:36:47] now the uncovering is not only the
[1:36:49] revelation of jesus christ
[1:36:52] but it is the revelation of his future
[1:36:54] works in the oncoming seven church ages
[1:36:58] so right now jesus christ is not here in
[1:37:00] his corporate body but he's in his bride
[1:37:02] amen he's veiled behind human flesh
[1:37:06] he's in the bride right now
[1:37:08] see down through the church age we've
[1:37:10] started off from the foundation from the
[1:37:12] first church age when the seed went in
[1:37:14] the ground the complete seed then it
[1:37:16] come through the feet luther so imagine
[1:37:18] there being a statue here
[1:37:20] of of of a man or a human and as the
[1:37:23] sculpture begins you're the audience and
[1:37:25] the sculpture it's all he's worked on it
[1:37:27] put so much time and love and care into
[1:37:29] it and it's just an absolute masterpiece
[1:37:31] and he goes and he begins to unveil it
[1:37:33] and all he gets to is the feet
[1:37:35] and you get upset oh i seen it that's
[1:37:37] awesome and you run out
[1:37:39] have you really seen it
[1:37:42] but do you know that's what people did
[1:37:43] spiritually whenever the feet being like
[1:37:45] luther as god was revealing himself and
[1:37:47] his bride and as soon as the move of god
[1:37:49] went and god is getting ready to show
[1:37:52] himself in the beauty of of his bride
[1:37:55] and when people seen just the feet they
[1:37:57] denominated like luther and said oh we
[1:37:58] got it
[1:38:00] whenever the sculpture goes a little bit
[1:38:02] higher
[1:38:03] we don't want it we do we just want the
[1:38:05] feet
[1:38:06] within the sculpture god continues to
[1:38:08] lift up that blanket
[1:38:10] and it exposes a little bit more now you
[1:38:12] can see the legs and that was the
[1:38:14] methodist and then they then then they
[1:38:16] get up and jump out and run
[1:38:18] it ain't over yet
[1:38:20] continue ye in the light
[1:38:23] so then as the sculpture continues to
[1:38:25] unveil
[1:38:26] the masterpiece and then it's the body
[1:38:28] of christ working from the feet to the
[1:38:30] head he is the head so as it works its
[1:38:33] way up it works his way to the mouth and
[1:38:35] that's pentecost
[1:38:37] that's tongues
[1:38:39] gifts
[1:38:40] well they get up and run out
[1:38:43] they think they've seen it all they
[1:38:44] think they've arrived they think that's
[1:38:46] the head that's it this is god's this is
[1:38:48] god's promise it was god's promise but
[1:38:50] it wasn't done yet
[1:38:53] sit still it wasn't done yet
[1:38:56] and then god unveils a little bit higher
[1:38:59] and you see the eyes
[1:39:02] the eyes is a symbol of a prophet
[1:39:05] a prophet that can look and see what's
[1:39:07] coming down the road
[1:39:09] do you know the
[1:39:10] eyes
[1:39:12] is the last moving faculty you have in
[1:39:14] your body
[1:39:16] that you can move you can maybe move
[1:39:18] your nose you can move your lips and
[1:39:19] different parts of your body your eyes
[1:39:21] eyebrows that's it
[1:39:23] after that is the mind
[1:39:26] so after god sends a prophet
[1:39:28] this message the last move of god what's
[1:39:31] next but the intelligence the very mind
[1:39:34] of christ himself
[1:39:38] and that's given to you
[1:39:40] remember what he said
[1:39:42] in the church book those in the bride do
[1:39:46] only his will
[1:39:48] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:39:50] have thus saith the lord
[1:39:53] for they keep still
[1:39:56] now if a word is a thought expressed
[1:39:58] it's got to come through the mind
[1:40:00] so if the bride has thus saith the lord
[1:40:02] she doesn't speak nothing
[1:40:04] that the mind of the lord hasn't given
[1:40:06] her to speak
[1:40:09] so we have the mind of the lord but if
[1:40:11] he didn't say it then we better keep
[1:40:13] still
[1:40:15] where the lord has spoken let us speak
[1:40:17] where he's kept silent let us keep
[1:40:19] silent
[1:40:21] that is why you've never seen one thus
[1:40:22] saith the lord fell in this message
[1:40:24] that's why you've never seen one thus
[1:40:26] saith the lord fell on tape because it
[1:40:28] wasn't the mind of a man
[1:40:30] no matter how impossible no matter how
[1:40:32] much then bones were crushed in that
[1:40:33] little boy from finland no matter how
[1:40:35] that little two inch fish no matter how
[1:40:37] much of his intros were pulled out it
[1:40:39] didn't matter
[1:40:41] thus saith the lord spoke it
[1:40:44] and it had to happen
[1:40:46] because that is the mind of the lord and
[1:40:48] that is the age we're coming to
[1:40:50] that is what is promised but it can't be
[1:40:52] within ourselves it's got to be the mind
[1:40:55] of the lord they know that it has to be
[1:40:57] god doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:40:59] word
[1:41:00] he did not complete all of his work
[1:41:03] while in this earthly ministry so now he
[1:41:05] works in
[1:41:06] and through the bride
[1:41:09] that's very humbling
[1:41:11] that you're
[1:41:12] god's body
[1:41:14] that you are the body of jesus christ on
[1:41:16] the earth
[1:41:21] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:41:23] for him to do certain things that he
[1:41:25] must now do but he would now fulfill
[1:41:28] through the bride that work which he
[1:41:30] left
[1:41:31] for this specific time
[1:41:35] so we're light we're the light of the
[1:41:37] hour
[1:41:38] not within our flesh
[1:41:40] in our flesh there is no good thing
[1:41:43] in ourselves in our humanistic
[1:41:46] capabilities there's nothing we have to
[1:41:48] offer nothing you can offer to god
[1:41:50] nothing you can do
[1:41:53] we're all
[1:41:55] creatures from the mud we're all seeds
[1:41:56] they're just in the mud but that is what
[1:41:58] separates that that's the thing
[1:42:00] that is what separates
[1:42:02] the elect from everyone else
[1:42:05] is the seed the predestination that god
[1:42:08] placed within you
[1:42:10] to have a reaction to the
[1:42:12] light because remember when spiritual
[1:42:15] light when it goes over it is not quick
[1:42:17] in the rocks
[1:42:18] it does not quicken the non-germatic
[1:42:20] seed
[1:42:22] it quickens the seeds
[1:42:25] so you go from seed
[1:42:27] to light from prophetic word to
[1:42:29] manifestation one day a prophet said
[1:42:31] despite of how it made himself sound
[1:42:33] even to his own ears he said the people
[1:42:35] that shine that walked in darkness have
[1:42:38] seen a great light they that dwell in
[1:42:40] the land of the shadow of death upon
[1:42:42] them hath light shined
[1:42:45] and then jesus
[1:42:46] hundreds of years later
[1:42:49] he does something
[1:42:52] and leaving nazareth
[1:42:54] he came and dwelt in capernaum which is
[1:42:56] by the sea coast and the borders of
[1:42:57] zebulun and nepthala
[1:43:00] it sounds simple he just he just moved
[1:43:03] that it might be
[1:43:04] fulfilled
[1:43:06] which was spoken by isaiah the prophet
[1:43:09] see it was a seed
[1:43:11] at that time it was just spoken but then
[1:43:13] it was circling circling and jesus was
[1:43:15] upon the earth and he had this seat to
[1:43:17] fulfill he had this bit of portion of
[1:43:18] scripture fulfilled he had this one and
[1:43:20] he was aware of it
[1:43:22] and he walked in in the father's will
[1:43:24] and this scripture was fulfilled this
[1:43:26] scripture was fulfilled this scripture
[1:43:27] was fulfilled
[1:43:31] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:43:32] spoken by isaiah the prophet
[1:43:34] saying the land of zebulun and the land
[1:43:36] of nephthalem by the way of the sea
[1:43:38] beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles
[1:43:41] the people which sat in darkness
[1:43:43] saw great light
[1:43:45] and to them which sat in the region of
[1:43:47] the and the shadow of death light
[1:43:50] is sprung up
[1:43:52] why is it that before your conversion
[1:43:54] you hated church or you had no thought
[1:43:57] for church or you can ever imagine being
[1:43:59] in church you never read the bible you
[1:44:01] never prayed you couldn't care less
[1:44:03] but all of a sudden you look back eight
[1:44:06] feet back as it was referring back to
[1:44:07] that lotus flower you look eight feet
[1:44:09] back and you say man
[1:44:11] god brought me out of some serious mud
[1:44:14] it was awfully dark down there
[1:44:17] but one day you thought that was your
[1:44:19] only world because sometimes the lotuses
[1:44:20] can stay dormant there was one there was
[1:44:22] one load of sea they said
[1:44:24] they found that estimated to be 1300
[1:44:26] years old
[1:44:28] and they planted it and it came up
[1:44:31] so sometimes they based on the seasons
[1:44:33] they can sometimes lay dormant
[1:44:35] and you can just be living your life in
[1:44:36] darkness and think you've got it made or
[1:44:38] realize you don't have it made however
[1:44:40] you're still in mud
[1:44:42] and you're sitting there in mud and you
[1:44:44] think that's your only world and you
[1:44:45] think that's all you've got in that
[1:44:46] sticky nasty mud but then one day
[1:44:49] whenever the season is just right
[1:44:52] that sun begins to to come over that
[1:44:55] nasty old pond you're in at the very
[1:44:58] bottom
[1:44:58] nobody even knows you're
[1:45:00] there but god does
[1:45:03] and that sunlight that warm sunlight
[1:45:04] begins to warm the water the right time
[1:45:07] of the year it's july or august
[1:45:09] warms up the water
[1:45:11] and something stirs up in you
[1:45:14] you've been laying in that mud for years
[1:45:16] and years and years
[1:45:19] maybe even for generations family
[1:45:20] speaking
[1:45:22] your family has got no history of
[1:45:24] christianity your family has got no
[1:45:26] history of doing good it doesn't matter
[1:45:29] it don't matter
[1:45:31] no matter what kind of last name you're
[1:45:32] born with your everyone is born in the
[1:45:34] mud
[1:45:35] but whenever that sunshine begins to
[1:45:37] light all of a sudden something there's
[1:45:39] there's a spiritual chemistry change
[1:45:42] within the very depths of your soul and
[1:45:44] you begin to all of a sudden
[1:45:46] feel like something is stirring within
[1:45:48] you
[1:45:50] god is trying to quicken that seed with
[1:45:51] the presence of his light and then all
[1:45:53] of a sudden you burst forth
[1:45:56] and there's still a lot of darkness
[1:45:57] between where you are and where you got
[1:45:59] to be
[1:46:00] but you keep going and the more you grow
[1:46:02] and the more you stretch for the light
[1:46:08] the higher you get
[1:46:10] the less dark it becomes
[1:46:12] and then you burst forth
[1:46:14] and you bloom
[1:46:16] you bloom for the glory of god
[1:46:18] and do you know that whenever the sun
[1:46:20] goes down they close up
[1:46:23] they need the sun to shine to their
[1:46:24] potential
[1:46:26] they need the sun to shine to their
[1:46:28] potential
[1:46:29] and the sun is up in this end time
[1:46:32] the sun is up
[1:46:34] it's harvest time
[1:46:36] and when you whenever the farmers plant
[1:46:38] their crop and everything god has
[1:46:39] seasons time so perfectly because when
[1:46:42] the wheat comes up and it's only this
[1:46:43] tall it cannot handle the july and
[1:46:45] august sun
[1:46:46] it's got to mature first it's got to
[1:46:49] mature and when it gets
[1:46:51] strong enough to be able to support that
[1:46:52] kind of sun and then it's time to bake
[1:46:55] all the greenness
[1:46:57] all the immaturity all the spiritual
[1:46:59] immaturity it's time to be baked out
[1:47:02] and the more spiritual immaturity that
[1:47:04] begins to be baked out
[1:47:06] the the heads begin to bow
[1:47:11] the green ones are still up
[1:47:15] the more
[1:47:16] that god revealed to this prophet
[1:47:20] the more humble brother branham became
[1:47:23] they say after the seals he was not the
[1:47:25] same
[1:47:27] the more
[1:47:29] you have the more god entrusts you with
[1:47:33] the more is required of you
[1:47:35] to whom much is given much is required
[1:47:38] we have a pearl of great price
[1:47:42] we have
[1:47:43] a priceless
[1:47:46] pearl in our possession
[1:47:50] god is is going to hold us responsible
[1:47:52] to how we live
[1:47:54] to this word amen
[1:47:56] because we are without excuse
[1:47:59] every single service
[1:48:01] service in and serve us out god does the
[1:48:04] miraculous
[1:48:07] if you're not aware of it
[1:48:09] that is because of your own spiritual
[1:48:11] condition
[1:48:12] but god does something and he says
[1:48:14] something in every single service and
[1:48:17] every single tape you listen to god has
[1:48:20] got something for you and every single
[1:48:22] leaf of the bible god has got something
[1:48:24] for you
[1:48:27] so let us rise and shine
[1:48:30] let us be lights
[1:48:33] not lights the bible is more than just
[1:48:35] good works
[1:48:37] god didn't come and just die
[1:48:39] and die the horrible death that he died
[1:48:40] just we'll be better neighbors
[1:48:42] just so that we can donate to build
[1:48:44] hospitals or just so we all that's fine
[1:48:47] it's wonderful it helps humanity but god
[1:48:49] has done so much more than that
[1:48:52] god has called us to be lights to our
[1:48:54] generation
[1:48:56] a city set on a hill
[1:48:59] that the word will literally live itself
[1:49:01] out through you
[1:49:04] that the word that you read about the
[1:49:06] very the very fruits of the spirit the
[1:49:08] very way jesus walked the way jesus
[1:49:11] talked is actually people can see it's
[1:49:13] actually not just here
[1:49:16] it's
[1:49:18] five foot tall
[1:49:19] it's
[1:49:20] five and a half foot tall
[1:49:22] it's got a dress and long hair it's got
[1:49:25] clean cut
[1:49:26] haircut it's got a beard
[1:49:31] it's got
[1:49:33] no hair
[1:49:36] that covers everybody
[1:49:38] it's got
[1:49:40] flesh
[1:49:41] flesh and blood
[1:49:44] that's what god wants
[1:49:47] he's coming
[1:49:48] you remember and i'm coming to a close
[1:49:50] here i didn't get to nowhere near this
[1:49:52] but do you remember that story brother
[1:49:54] tells that little boy that was so scared
[1:49:55] that lightning was was
[1:49:58] thunder was clapping and he just called
[1:50:00] his mom and he was just so scared and
[1:50:02] she prayed him and said son it's okay
[1:50:03] it's just just you know
[1:50:05] jesus is with us he'll he'll protect us
[1:50:08] what's wrong and he said i want jesus
[1:50:10] with some skin off
[1:50:11] he wanted a mama to sleep with him he
[1:50:12] wanted jesus with some skin off
[1:50:15] so that's what this world is looking for
[1:50:18] he's looking for jesus the world's
[1:50:20] looking for reality
[1:50:23] there's so much fake in this world
[1:50:25] and let me just say this because i just
[1:50:26] feel to go here you young people
[1:50:30] everything you see
[1:50:31] in advertisements
[1:50:33] everything you see in
[1:50:35] let's just say it's in movies or
[1:50:37] whatever or billboards or social media
[1:50:41] 99.9999
[1:50:43] of it is fake
[1:50:46] it's fake
[1:50:47] whether it's looks
[1:50:49] praise the lord
[1:50:51] whether it's looks
[1:50:53] whether it's a certain
[1:50:55] um
[1:50:56] lifestyle they're trying to project and
[1:50:58] what what does that do it's a trap
[1:51:01] it's a trap because then it makes you
[1:51:03] chase something
[1:51:04] that is not really real
[1:51:08] you know and
[1:51:09] you have young and this has been going
[1:51:10] on for decades but it's really ramped up
[1:51:12] now in the age that we live in you have
[1:51:13] young people that chase a certain look
[1:51:16] or a certain body or whatever it may be
[1:51:18] and then they find themselves
[1:51:20] over the hill if you will
[1:51:23] and they haven't achieved it because
[1:51:25] they're changing they're they're chasing
[1:51:27] a mirage
[1:51:29] this word is not a mirage
[1:51:31] if he said that you can be the statue of
[1:51:33] a perfect man you'll get there
[1:51:36] you're making progress
[1:51:39] that's what god has called us to do
[1:51:41] musicians can come on up if you can
[1:51:43] stand with me
[1:51:45] you know when brother bram was preaching
[1:51:46] the church ages
[1:51:48] he was preaching the church ages and he
[1:51:50] was going through each church age and he
[1:51:52] was drawn on a blackboard the moon
[1:51:55] and about how much darkness and the
[1:51:57] light of the moon was actually
[1:51:59] represented by the elect of each given
[1:52:01] age they were classified as the light
[1:52:03] because the church is the type of the
[1:52:05] moon
[1:52:06] so there was so much darkness in each
[1:52:08] age and as according to the amount of
[1:52:10] word they had revealed for their given
[1:52:11] age
[1:52:12] was signified by the light
[1:52:15] well at the end of that service
[1:52:18] there's this wasn't done in a corner
[1:52:20] this was in a service packed out the
[1:52:21] tabernacle the pillar of fire comes down
[1:52:25] and on the very back wall begins to
[1:52:28] project the exact same thing
[1:52:30] supernaturally
[1:52:33] that brother brandon just drew on the
[1:52:34] blackboard
[1:52:36] that was god's vindication
[1:52:39] of the message that was god's
[1:52:41] vindication one of the many
[1:52:43] that said that whatever my servant just
[1:52:45] taught you was right he drew it with
[1:52:48] chalk
[1:52:49] and god projected it on the back and the
[1:52:50] pillar of fire
[1:52:54] now brother graham said that therefore
[1:52:56] we must be
[1:52:57] that word bride
[1:52:59] and what is that word bride
[1:53:02] but the manifestation of the hour
[1:53:05] god said you would be here
[1:53:08] that was seed
[1:53:09] and now you're here believing his word
[1:53:12] that makes you light
[1:53:14] you are
[1:53:16] the light of the world
[1:53:18] jesus said i'm the light yep but you're
[1:53:20] his body
[1:53:22] you know jesus said i am the light and
[1:53:24] then he comes around and says ye are the
[1:53:26] light of the world
[1:53:28] a city that's set on a hill cannot be
[1:53:31] hit
[1:53:32] and you know in the new heavens and the
[1:53:33] new earth
[1:53:35] whenever everything is set up just so
[1:53:36] wonderfully and every pain will be over
[1:53:38] every old age any kind of care and
[1:53:41] concern will all be wiped away
[1:53:43] the bible says
[1:53:44] the city had no need of the sun
[1:53:47] neither the moon to shine in it
[1:53:50] for the glory of god
[1:53:52] did lighten it
[1:53:54] and the lamb
[1:53:56] is the light thereof
[1:53:59] his son had a beginning this s-u-n had a
[1:54:01] beginning
[1:54:02] and it's got an end
[1:54:06] last story uh
[1:54:08] brother ram told of a little girl
[1:54:09] remember when they went down in that
[1:54:10] cave in carlsbad new mexico
[1:54:14] they went down in a cave and that guy
[1:54:15] turned off the light and it was just so
[1:54:17] dark so dark
[1:54:19] there's a little boy a little girl in
[1:54:20] there and they being that little this
[1:54:22] little boy's little sister began just
[1:54:23] screaming her little head off she was
[1:54:25] terrified
[1:54:26] it was dark
[1:54:28] and that little boy reached out and
[1:54:29] comforted her and he said don't fear
[1:54:32] little sister
[1:54:33] there is a man here that can turn on the
[1:54:37] light
[1:54:39] you may be in a dark cave this morning
[1:54:42] you may be in the pits of despair you
[1:54:44] may be in the mud and you feel like
[1:54:45] you've been in mud for a long time
[1:54:48] but don't fear
[1:54:50] there is a man here that can turn on the
[1:54:52] light
[1:54:54] you do your best to live for god
[1:54:56] and you sometimes you can just feel the
[1:54:58] pressure of the age and and the evil age
[1:55:00] that we live in and you feel the
[1:55:02] darkness
[1:55:03] that you go out and everywhere you look
[1:55:05] just darkness darkness everywhere you
[1:55:07] turn there's darkness the news is
[1:55:08] darkness everything is darkness
[1:55:11] but one day there's a man here
[1:55:14] that will turn on the light
[1:55:16] and the promise of the resurrection and
[1:55:19] the promise of the body change
[1:55:22] will go from seed
[1:55:24] to light
