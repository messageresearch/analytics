bless you sister laura amen quite a fight whenever you're dealing with tumors it's quite a fight and so hey i've outlived four months so that's a good deal amen we're so glad to have brother gene gordon sister tanya with us tonight and you as well and and and sister betty is this the first time you've been back sister betty i i i hope it's okay but i want to you know i don't never say hello in two minutes so but her husband was quite a friend of mine and he was kind of one of those friends that uh you knew when you were buddies with him and uh i had the honor to speak his funeral and terry was a real friend he let me hunt in his tree stand and i don't think he let hardly anybody else hunt in his tree stand but he let me hunt in these streets dan we became buddies and i knew that there was just a little something lacking in in his life and we were at the camp meeting and i believe it was two years ago is that correct and it was i had made the statement that you know if god will move even if he has to move behind the curtain and as i as i spoke that evening uh sister charnick got healed we prayed for her and a few others but there really wasn't a great stir in the open audience and i just i just stepped behind the curtain and when matthew was attending to me and and as as as i was maybe brother alden as well and as i stepped behind the curtain i went behind those big curtains and just when i did i felt that world of wind come and i turned and i prayed for nathaniel and sister caitlin and they were childless and was had great issue with that and god just spoke a word to them and then little charlie was born almost exactly a year later amen and we're so thankful for that what a miracle that was then another one and then another one and then there was brother dwayne jackson that had been struggling with a call for 17 years and god speaks directly to him and then brother guido was standing there and brother guido is is standing and he's just as he's standing there and i i remember the prayer that i prayed for him they've told a lie on you guido and they've come against you but god will handle that now guido i see a train coming for you and it'll be okay for you to get on and brother guido just throwed his hands in the air and he grabbed me up and he began to speak in in another language and and uh it was just an incredible moment when i whirled around i turned and terry was standing there tears was running out of his eyes and he said i can serve a god like that it was a moment for me and i grabbed terry and we begin to pray as we begin to pray the spirit of god fell on him and i believe the testimony is he was different from that second don't have to have a thousand people just you and god and i believe tonight terry's waiting on us amen sister betty we're glad to have you here with us tonight amen give her a great big hand we love you amen today has been a special day in the spencer household and the climate household ah sister sarah won a raffle to get pictures taken it was a setup raffle but it was a she won and she didn't know that today was the day she was going to get asked will you marry me and she said yes so our our church has become even more intertwined now and amen i would like for them to come and we will pray with them and we're we're happy for them should i get a mask no amen amen we're going to take pictures so you're going to take those off we're so happy for them amen amen god bless you so love you i so love you i'm thankful for what god did in gabriel's life this year when i was having my brain tumor taken out the next day he came into the room to be with me and the room was full and he wanted a word with me and that room just emptied you know everybody had a reason to leave and it just emptied and when it emptied i was able to deal with him and he's never been the same amen and there ain't no going back now amen we're so happy for you we're so thrilled for you we as an audience are thrilled for you the other half of our audience is thrilled and now the world is thrilled for you yeah brother branham teaches us a man chooses a wife to reflect his character and you're a real lady and so now we get to see the inside of gabriel what he was looking for all along brother branham says that we step out of eternity into a space of time and we'll spend time here together and then one day we'll step back into eternity again so we're beginning to see the reflections of god in your life and you've taken a step forward and you were introduced and you came through that phase and you found there there was a lot of things that you liked about each other and now you've chosen to spend the rest of your lives together but we never want to do it without god and so today we're going to ask god to bless your engagement in a public way jesus we love you with all of our hearts we're so thrilled for gabriel and sarah our families are so intertwined father you have blessed our lives today when she was asked and she said yes lord i ask you that you would bless them bless this engagement period may you watch over the decisions that they will have to make in so many ways dear god

serve amen we're excited to have brother william come and speak for us tonight and i believe he's going to be able to preach in this atmosphere tonight amen this atmosphere like this is a preacher's dream and so as brother william comes to speak tonight you just pull on the gift of god we're hungry and we're wanting to be fed this evening we're certainly thankful for all the events that are taking place in our lives we're also very excited for sister charity spencer tomorrow morning at her home place at their she will be baptized in a cold icy river and she will be taken on the name of the lord jesus christ our prayer is when she comes in that icy water that god fills her with the fire of the holy ghost amen we're certainly thankful give the lord a handclap of praise as brother william comes tonight let's sing that song amazing grace will always be my song of praise amazing grace who shall always be my song of grace [Music] was i do not know [Music] [Applause] just why [Music] all my faults and he saw [Music] [Music] where my jesus died he died for me how am i the lord he ever came to love me so he looked [Music] god bless you brother william amen god bless you good to be announce the lord amen there's no other place to look up there's no other place to look but up amen what a testimony you shall forever look up amen brothers and sisters it's certainly good to see the house of the lord appreciate all the songs of worship to our lord jesus he's so worthy he's so worthy we can never praise him enough we can never give him enough honor and glory for what he's done for us in this end time amen to not keep you standing we'll just go to the word if you'll turn with me to saint john chapter 11. we'll read in several places but we'll just take one at a time this evening greet you all in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ john 11 25 jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this and then if you turn with me to ephesians chapter one i'm sorry ephesians chapter two verse one and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom we also also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus amen let's bow our heads and our hearts to him the gracious heavenly father we truly thank you lord jesus for this opportunity father lord to come in your presence this evening father we thank you lord jesus for your presence that's already here father lord and we just want to submit ourselves to you father lord one more time i pray o god that you forgive us of our sins i pray that you help me oh god to get out of the way speak through me hear through your people or that together father we'll give you all the praise honor and glory we love you lord and commit ourselves in this service into your hands in jesus christ's name amen god bless you you're seated with the help of the lord i'd like to title this sermon the voice of your resurrection i would like to make this very very personal because we know that salvation is a very personal affair we don't go in together as a group we don't go together by association we don't go in because of who our parents are we don't not we don't who our parents are what family background we come from does not put us in the body of christ and it doesn't take us out of the body of christ aren't you thankful for that romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you that's one of the biggest ifs in the bible if the spirit of christ that raised up if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll also quicken your mortal body so the voice of god is the word of god jesus said that my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow so it's important that as the word goes in every service that you that you understand that is god speaking through the chosen vessel and you must receive it as the word because if you receive it as just the a brother standing here and speaking his opinion you won't get anything but if you receive it as the word of the lord you'll get the reward of the word that's being said you'll receive the promise because the word is the seed brother jim and whenever the word is planted in your heart and you receive it it will then bring forth what that seed is if you get a peach seed and it's not a hybrid seed and you plant it in the ground a peach tree will grow up you take the spoken word of god which is the original seed into your soul and the word will come out if you need healing take that part of the word into your soul if you need deliverance take that part of the word into your soul it doesn't matter what you have need of you take that spoken word into your heart and it'll bring forth the promise of god in first peter 1 18 for as much as ye know that you are not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by the tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreign before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these times last times for you who by him do believe in god that god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god seeing that you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again ye must be born again without being born again you will not see this resurrection without being born again you will not see a body change that's why jesus said you must be born again it's a requirement of every person god requires it not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so god deals with us gentiles as individuals god calls us we come into the world as as a sinner we come into this world with no hope for salvation but there there but there's within the inside of every well on the inside of every elected child of god is a seed is an eternal seed germ of god but it must be quickened you come into this world a sinner you come into the world with the with the desire for the things of the world so there must come a point where you hear the voice of god and the voice of god is directly to you and it becomes a personal resurrection now isaiah 49 says can a woman forget her suckling child you know satan many times tries to tell you that god has forgotten you satan many times tries to tell you that god doesn't hear your prayer isaiah says can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of a womb yea they may forget yet i will not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me whenever you hear the term that you've heard your name we've got to hear our name being called when adam and eve fell in the beginning they heard god running after them saying adam adam where arthel when the word is being preached and you feel the conviction in your heart that is god calling out your name because where the bride of christ is not beaten to submission the bride of christ is corrected out of love so when the word comes forth and it sometimes can cut you it can sometimes step on your toes but it's god's love it's his correction to you and that is god speaking directly to you that is a revelation that you must grab when the word is coming forth you must reach out and grab the promise of god that is your way of hearing adam adam where art thou when the word is speaking and you feel that conviction in your heart that is god speaking to you don't shun that away when you feel that inclination toward god that's god satan's not going to put that inclination in your heart satan will try and get you to run but whenever you feel the conviction conviction is a blessing conviction is a wonderful thing people hear the word of god and it does nothing for them people some people's conscience are seared so if you still have a desire for god in your heart and if you're in this church tonight that means you must have a desire for him so when you hear the conviction of the word as the word is coming forth and you're feeling a prick in your heart don't bury that listen that is the voice of god to you calling out to you and he's calling your name don't wait for a literal your literal earthly name being called that is why when the bible says whosoever will that's so much more wonderful than saying your name to your earthly name because whosoever will surely means you so jesus can never forgive you forget you i'm sorry jesus can never forget you he knows right where you are jesus wants to forgive you satan is trying to get you to run but jesus is trying to draw you so it's impossible to meet god without there being some sort of resurrection lazarus could not stay dead in the presence of god one day jesus was going through a little city of nain and a widow she already lost her husband and she lost her only son and there was a funeral procession going down and jesus the very resurrection himself stepped on the scene and changed things because there can be no death in the presence of the of the tree of life or the prince of life so there was no choice but for that widow's son to raise from the dead zacchaeus was not a well thought of man in his day he was a tax collector he was a turn code and he would he would believe that people drive their money and actually charge them more taxes than what they really owed and he pocketed he would not you would not want him to be your tax man you would not want him to be your neighbor and you would not think very highly of zacchaeus but yet when he was in the presence of jesus he changed people didn't want anything to do with zacchaeus but yet he had a wife whose name was rebecca and rebecca never quit praying for him so your spouse may be wondering somewhere your spouse may not be here tonight your spouse may be backslidden but keep praying for them because the prayers of rebecca finally caught up to zacchaeus and he began to get stirred he couldn't sleep anymore so one day he got up and he wanted to see who jesus was for himself and he climbed in the tree and we know the story and that same that that prince of life came through and he's seen zacchaeus was well hidden and he said zacchaeus should come down today i'm going to your house and jesus wants to come to your house you may be hiding you may think you're hiding but jesus knows where you're at you may be hiding behind behind your talents you may be hiding trying to hide in the world you may be hiding in church people hide in church but jesus knows where you're at and jesus knows your spiritual condition so when you meet god you don't have a choice but to come to life there was even a dead stick in the old testament when aaron put his rod left his raw there in the in the tabernacle of witness a dead stick came to life it bloomed it bore almonds in the presence of the prince of life now there's a spiritual principle i want you to hold in mind everything always happens brother shannon in the spiritual first before you see it take place in the natural that's a spiritual principle throughout the entire scripture abraham had to believe god for that son first he had to receive it first in his heart and then the word then the actual son manifested that's how healing takes place you accept the word you believe the word you you claim your healing you profess your healing and then your body actually falls in subjection to the word that you've received but the healing takes place here when you come to god and you give your heart to the lord and he saves you it takes place first and there may still be some things hanging around but then people start seeing that difference you come to god and you get born again and he gives you the holy ghost it happens on the inside first and then the outward will line right up to it because people can try and line up the outward and the inside not be right seek ye first the kingdom of god then all these other things will be added unto you brother braham said in the message if god be with us then where is all the miracles that's a great question isn't it god is with us which is why we're seeing miracles he said you know just sound a trumpet don't shake that don't shake down a wall that you can run a chariot races around sounding a trumpet but god said he's speaking of joshua going around jericho just just march around the wall seven times and the last day march 7 and 13 times as you go around the wall at the last time let the priest go with before with the ark and sound a trumpet and when the trumpet sounds the walls will shake down what do they do he saw the miracle of god after he acted on the word of god where is your miracles brother ram asked now here's a prophet of god who has seen countless miracles who could write volumes of books on the miracles that god has done through his ministry and he's asking the question where's your miracles he said act on his word first you act on his word first you cannot put the miracle before the word you put the word first and then the miracle follows always put the word first how could the walls be shook down and leave one little house standing at harlot's house because she acted on the word of god why did the rest of them die and she lived she acted on the word of god and she saw the miracle of god that's the way to find it act on the word confess you're healed when you don't feel healed confess you're saved when you don't feel saved confess the word then watch the miracle act happen confess the word and then you watch your body line up with that word claim your loved one saved and then watch them come in start praising him for your miracle now as you because in the mind of god you've already received it when you receive the word it's finished it's finished it doesn't matter if you don't see it when you receive the word and you receive the promise in your heart and you believe it that settles it abraham believed god for that son that is why when god told him to take him up on the mountain it might have challenged his humanity at one point but you see there in the scripture where he said you stay here he told the servants because i'm the latter going up and we're coming right back to you he didn't care if he had to kill isaac he knew that he'd already received him as one from the dead you think of the woman at the well in st john chapter four brother branham refers to her probably in his prayer lines as he's trying to get the people see it in the scripture because here's the important thing to always remember the message is the scripture made manifest it's not don't then in your mind the message is a manifestation of the scripture so it will be found in the scripture because it is the word of god so he would he would be he would dramatize and build the scene of saint john chapter 4 to get you to realize that it was the same messiah the same god on the platform with his prophet doing the same work so the woman at the whale when she was sitting there we all we're all very familiar with the story she's sitting there and she couldn't come when the honorable women came and she sat there but when jesus came and asked her for her drink she recognized the word made flesh she recognized the word made flesh first then after that after she received the word she then had a ministry to go tell she had a ministry to go tell the people of samaria come see a man who's told me all the things i've ever done isn't this the messiah so there's a ministry and she types the bride there's a ministry for the bride there's a ministry for you as an individual when you receive something you've got to tell somebody something it's quite interesting that she had five husbands jesus said she had five husbands and the one that she was living with was not hers but jesus was hers jesus was the seventh man jesus was the seventh and complete jesus completed her she had to look nowhere else when she found him you can try many things in life you can run anywhere you want you'll never find nothing to match him you'll never find a relationship you'll never find an amount of money you'll never find an amount of fame to match him so when she went home she was like legion she was a changed woman and the whole city was moved and stirred by her testimony in saint john 4 god is the spirit of jesus speaking and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him i know that messiah cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things jesus said unto her i that speak unto thee am he now jesus one time told a bunch of religious people that i and my father are one and they reached down and picked up stones that are ready to kill them jesus tells this prostitute that i am he and she believes what is the difference you had religious people the prophet of god said the religious people were clean on the outside but the inside of them were black and smutty and sinful and here you had a woman that took that took a wrong choice in life and her body was not pure but she was redeemable on the inside because she was able to experience a resurrection when she heard the voice of the messiah she had an elected seed in her that came forth to life when the s-o-n shined on it you put the seed in nature you put a seed in the ground brother mark and when that that warm sunshine shines on it it has no choice but to come to life an elected son or daughter of god when they hear the word when they hear the sun shine the s-o-n shine the voice of god the voice behind the voice when it quickens them there's no choice but to come to life you're like you you we come to the world like dead sticks we're just walking through life dead but whenever we get in the presence of the sun we have no choice if we're an elected child of god but to come to life you may have people trying to hold you back you may have people that come against what you believe you may have some people that attack which you believe that people are attacking this message but you know the sun quickens the seed to life not rocks you can be surrounded by rocks but god has come to quicken the seed in you and when he speaks the word to you it causes a resurrection within you and it causes you to come to life it causes you to hear that eagle scream because of the sea that you have and it causes a resurrection within you whenever when your acquaintances might have just left it laying there because if it's what's on the inside and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked to the woman yet no man said what seeketh thou well i talk is doubt to her the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the city and said to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ the bride is saying come see the man christ jesus come see the man christ jesus speaking through his word there was another young lady that has had a visitation one time by the name of mary mary had a supernatural supernatural angelic visitation and she was just an average little girl she was just a teenager but mary became pregnant by the spoken word of an angel the spoken word of god by an angel she received the spoken word in her brother branham said in the church age book the word of promise came to the virgin mary but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her she believed the word of the angel she said be it unto me according to thy word do you know mary had to believe something that's never been done before she had to believe what the angel of the lord spoke to her that when she because faith cometh by hearing and she was that predestinated virgin to carry the body of god the body of the lord jesus and she believed the word and when she received it in the spiritual first then all of a sudden after about three months she started showing and a few more months went by and she started showing she couldn't quite cover it and and then people had realized that something had happened you receive you become pregnant with a word and people will notice and you know mary after she received the word this visitation of an angel she had a ministry she had a ministry when she went to visit her her cousin elizabeth who was pregnant with with jesus christ forerunner who hadn't moved and he was dead in her womb in luke 1 30 and luke 1 41 and it came to pass when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost mary became pregnant with the word of god and then went and told somebody and god spoke through her and quickened life to someone else where does the life come through it comes through the body the body of christ and there's people that try and say that the bride don't have a ministry she absolutely has a ministry there's two scripture examples right there where the bride had a ministry and life was transferred through the body by the power of the spoken word and elizabeth as soon as she heard the salutation of mary the babe in her womb leaped for joy and she was filled with a holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb for whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe in my womb the babe leaped in my womb for joy the power of the spoken word will bring you life no matter what condition you you're facing right now when the word goes forth you grab it right now don't wait till sunday don't wait till monday you grab it right now while it's passing by because when the word passes you by that's like jesus passing you by because he's the word so when that word passes by you reach out and grab it because it's for you how many times the prophets lament and say she's missing it oh god help her jesus christ was passing by that person's way and they let it go by don't let him go by your way without you touching him so the the power of the spoken word elizabeth received the holy ghost the john came to life by the testimony by the word that mary said and we find in the new testament why peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on them that heard the word you receive it while peter yet spake the words the holy ghost fell on them while brother so-and-so is speaking the word the holy ghost can fall on you while brother so-and-so is speaking the word you can get the holy ghost you can get your healing you can get deliverance while the word is going forth don't let it go by your way don't let it just pass hear your name being called recognize that it's you it's not your neighbor it's not it's for you it don't matter if you're in the living room it don't matter if you're on the internet it's for you receive it god's word don't know no distance you know zachariah six months before mary's visitation of the angel zechariah met the same angel but disbelieved and god took away his ability to speak because he didn't believe the word of an angel but mary six months later received a visitation from the same angel and said be it unto me according to thy word and she was able to speak life not of her own self but she had something within her that when she spoke out that quick in life and whether life is quickened to you by listening to a summer of the prophet or life is quick unto you in a church here in a minister preach it's the word of god to you it's the word of god to you when jesus was here on earth and he lived his life and he was crucified and they stuck that spear in his precious body and he cried out with a loud voice there was a resurrection that happened there was a resurrection that happened when jesus cried with a loud voice the bible says that the old testament saints that is why it was so important for them to be buried in jerusalem that's it was so important for them to be buried in israel is because that's where the messiah was coming so when he cried out with a loud voice that it's finished they they came out of the graves the grave cannot hold the body of jesus down and neither can the grave hold down the body the bride body of christ there are saints that are sleeping in the dirt there are saints that are still on the earth and jesus said in the beginning of our text that whether they're that when they're whether they're dead or alive he said i am direction the the i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die but believe us thou this believe us thou this in romans 8 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren whom whom moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified when that seed that's placed in you before the foundation of the world it's like a lily brother talks about the lily it's born it's in the very very bottom of the pond it's underneath the mud it's got to come through the mud and the muck and that dirty nasty pond and it's stretching out for the sun it's filling out for the sun but that seed can't be stopped and there's no choice all that the father has given me will come to me think about this you're in you're in god's hand and satan can't take you out you can't do nothing to take yourself out god called you and if you're elected and you have that seed in you and you're feeling the pull there's a word for you tonight to come forth there's a word for you tonight like when jesus stood and he's he put back them small shoulders and he said lazarus come forth the word is crying out to the elected to come forth come out of her my people because before there can be a natural resurrection there's got to be a spiritual resurrection those that are sleeping in the ground that are waiting on you and i they they were spiritually resurrected first in their life then god called them home and they're guaranteed a resurrection they're guaranteed not by man they're guaranteed by the god of heaven their resurrection just like those that are alive and remain are guaranteed a rapture but you got to have the token in your hand you can't go in the rapture without the token you cannot go in the rapture without being born again that is your token it doesn't matter what anybody else says you cannot get into the rapture without the token nobody can get you if you've got that token nobody can take you out of the rapture brother rem said now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifested in the sun and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we do not become seed by rebirth now understand this because you are born again is not what made you a child of god you were a child of god which gave you the ability and what on the inside to hear the word and be born again that's the difference you were always a child of god but you had spiritual amnesia but you're always a part of god you are always in the mind of god because if you weren't in the mind of god at the beginning then you won't be at the end but if you were at them in his mind at the beginning there's nothing that that can happen to keep you from being there not a single thing not a single devil in hell not every devil in hell can keep you from being there on that day because in the mind of god you are already there already there so it don't matter what satan whispers in your ear nothing else matters it's what god seen of you at the very beginning earth is when you take a picture now it's not so much now so much more but back back in in the old days as they call it when they would take a picture they had to take it in the dark room to develop it to bring out what the picture was earth is like a dark room where it proves your predestination it proves your election you prove your election to the devil god called you before the foundation of the world he thought of you and he he he knows everything but he's not looking so much at where you're at now he's looking at the finished product that is why the holy ghost is given to you based on predestination because god looks at you now you look at yourself not how other people look at yourself he looks at you at the end and he says he was with me before time and he's going to be there at the very end what happens in between who your family is you can't help that who they're not don't matter what you do in life what kind of job you have all that doesn't matter what matters is that you are in the mind of god and that now you're here hearing the voice of god and it's causing a resurrection on the inside of you that's bringing you forth to life but it's doing nothing for the rocks out in the world in the flesh we're no different in the flesh we still enjoy the things of life in the flesh we still get hungry we still get thirsty but it's the soul that we're talking about that's what separates the bride from the church because i my testimony is i'm in the bride i'm in the bride god will have people good people good people like your neighbors that may not be sitting here and they're good people they'll give their shirt off your their shirt off their back if necessary they've done good things for you the good people god has a place for them the blood of jesus saves the blood of jesus goes in places we can't even imagine but here tonight brothers and sisters we want to be in the bride we don't want to go to the tribulation period we want to escape it one of my favorite scriptures second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new so every elected child of god were quickened by the word of their day i'll give you a little more detail if you sit right here tonight and you're elected and you have the holy ghost and it's a promise if you don't don't be discouraged it's a promise unto you it's a promise but if you're a believer a true believer of this message that god has sent if you would have lived in the days of noah there would have been nine souls on the ark it doesn't matter what age you're expressed you're an elected child of god and you would have heard the word for your day because you're a thought of god and a thought is a word expressed god's voice in every age and every church age messenger awaken quickened and resurrected the elect of that age why are we here why are we sitting here right now because god sent a prophet many of you are married to who you're married to or are going to be married to who you're going to be married to because god sent a prophet think about that that affects your whole life now some of you might have come in and already had your spouse after you heard the word and god had already arranged that but i'm trying to make the point how this word goes so much deeper and the influence of the word goes so much deeper than just your natural life than just every day and you don't really realize how much it governs our lives god then messengers are very important because they are god's light in each age and they're so important that in the book of revelation jesus jesus has them in his right hand seven stars in his right hand and each one is a messenger given to each age to call out and their message causes a resurrection it's it's a voice of the resurrection of the elect in that age and it gives them the new birth when they hear the word when they receive the word for their day they're sealed in the body of christ but under their messenger the bible also calls and his voice was as the voice of many waters so under each messenger you had god called men that were under the same anointing speaking and preaching the same word not going above the messenger but they're speaking the same word they're preaching the same thing we're preaching the same thing brother branham preached we're preaching everything that that's preached has got to be come out of the message has got to come out of the word has got to be found in this bible it's the same message that's being preached and i love how brother andrew last week mentioned that diamond he preached the word has been preached but sometimes you may be even hearing it tonight from a different angle tomorrow you hear from another angle it's the same word but it can whenever you feel it strike that's faith grab a hold of it so brother braham said that the voice of any waters is the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there god took his prophet home but yet the word is still going forth the word just like it was through mary is still going forth and it's bringing it's quickening life in the elected people the word is being preached it's the same message he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches most every that has most everyone that has a normal birth have ears to hear but not everyone has got the ability to spiritually hear what the spirit says so if tonight you're sitting here and i trust that you are and you got the and you got the hunger in your heart to hear the word of god you are a very blessed people we're living in an age when people hate the truth they have no think of this they have no desire for the truth so what did the bible say because they have no dis they because they have no love for the truth god will give them over to a lie so what about this age what is the message that could be a sermon within itself what is the message the message is found from genesis to revelation the message is jesus christ the message is the supper invitation of luke 14. we don't have time to reel these scriptures so if you're taking notes just drop these scriptures down and go back and read but this but the the message is the supper invitation of luke 14. the message is the bridegroom call of matthew 25. that's the message right there while the bridegroom terry they all slumber and slept but at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go yet to meet them that's what the message tells us behold jesus christ our bridegroom he cometh prepare yourself to meet him ephesians 5 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light that's the message calling out to you and to me to come out to be quickened the message quickens us it brings us life in isaiah 60 arise shine for thy light has come that's the message and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and grows darkness to people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee so you have two conditions in the world at the same time you've got darkness and you've got light just like in just like in the first exodus you had darkness in egypt but you had light in goshen at the same time the message is the shout of first thessalonians chapter four brother ram clearly identified the shout as the message so when there's a shout that goes forth and i'm not going to shout but it's supposed to wake you up unless i see too many of you sleeping then i may but the shout is a message and it calls the the church to attention it calls the elected to the attention it calls them it calls them out because remember the rapture we refer to the rapture but the rapture is actually a process the rapture is the shout the voice and the trump so if the message is the shout if you're truly baptized into the body of christ brother jim and you're in the body of christ and you've accepted the word and it's it's given you a born-again experience then you're already in the rapture you're already in the shout and so those those saints and we no doubt most all of us have got have got loved ones that are resting and they are waiting and they're waiting for the for they're waiting on us and resurrection morning they're going to rise they've already partaken of the shout so they're going to hear the voice to raise up from the dead to raise up out of the ground so you can't miss it when you're a part of the shout you're going to be a part of the voice and you're going to be part of the trump you're going to be gathered around how can you really receive if you've got the token life of jesus christ in you you're going to be there it's guaranteed that you're going to be there it's not a good chance it's not more than likely you are guaranteed to be there because you're holding the token you're holding the token if you're just holding church that's no guarantee if you're just holding a doctrine that's not guaranteed if you're whole in the world that certainly ain't that's not guaranteed in fact that's the the only way to make it in this rapture because we're starting to see pre-tribulation things we're starting to see the world as it's gone and it doesn't matter what what your political conviction may be the best president of any of our lifetimes right here nothing changed morally because she rejected the truth there might have been a nice policy lower taxes or whatever it may be but morally speaking america has been on the decline since she rejected him since she rejected the truth she's been on the decline in the world the church world brothers and sisters they missed it they're calling for revival they're calling for america's best days is yet to come the bride's best days are yet to come but this country has rejected the gospel which is why she's in the trouble that she's in any one of our young children any one of our young people anyone that has been heard the word could solve all the world's problems they go to summits and they go here and they go there he is the answer to every problem in this world but they don't want it they don't want it in fact we're at the second crucifixion of the word because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and when he came the first time they crucified him when he came the second time when the word was presented and the word the full word came they rejected it and they crucified it so if there was a resurrection after the first crucifixion there's going to be a resurrection after the second crucifixion now when brother rand preaches the third seal he says the bride hasn't had a revival yet see now he was preaching the seals there there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet we know she's been stirred see we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again see yeah he'll send it he promised it now people people can get a little uneasy and they may get a little fidgety when they hear certain words there's no reason to be afraid of the word thunder it's in the scripture it's very very important a thunder is simply a voice so if there's seven thunders there's seven voices and it takes them seven voices to wake the bride up you see to wake her up to say come out of her my people and so that wakes the bride up see there's you've got to be resurrected spiritually before you can be resurrected naturally you've got to be you've got to receive the born-again experience and change your soul before your body can be changed so the voice of your resurrection when john his forerunner came john the baptist he was preaching and you know he he must have been a lot like what the messiah was going to be because remember they came and asked him are you the messiah they confused him with the messiah people thought brother branham was god but he's not but john introduced the lamb of god just like god's prophet introduced the lamb of god now remember when john introduced jesus christ he introduced all of god he introduced god in his fullness and so did brother william branham this picture right here the world hates it the world attacks it satan hates it but he knows it's true satan knows that that pillar of fire right here would come down in them services and cast him out you see this man here he was a vessel he was a sinner at one time and he had to be saved just like you he had to be saved just like you he had he had a pull for the world he wanted to be a boxer he wanted to be a writer but he had to surrender it all so he could be used of god now we don't worship the man but we listen to what he said because this pillar of fire right here is jesus christ you read in the bible that whenever paul was persecuting the church when jesus came and he was god in flesh and they killed him and he rose from the dead he said i come from god and i go back to god when paul was cruising when paul was persecuting the elected church the bride and he was on his way to arrest the church the elected word of god he was struck off a horse by this light and paul said when he said jesus said paul paul why persecute without me now think of this paul did not physically even see jesus but jesus said why persecuteth thou me so that means the body of christ is jesus christ so he said paul paul why persecute without me and he said paul said who are you lord now paul was a very indoctrinated man and he knew the law and that pillar of fire spoke back and said i'm jesus that pillar of fire is the same pillar of fire that would actually go and lead moses leave the children of israel that pillar of fire would would come and go throughout scriptures that pillar of fire is what each and every one of us must meet you don't have to see it but you've got to meet it because the holy ghost remember when on on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost came that it separated itself tongues of fire it's like tongues of fire that pill you have a portion that pillar of fire is with every elected child of god now god took god took his dear prophet home he did his job but that pillar of fire still with the bride that pillar of fire has been seen in the church in our church and i believe with all my heart the pillar of fire is here because he promised to be do you know satan attacks that picture because he hates it so much oh by the way he attacks this one too but you know this is peace to you this is peace to you but his judgment to the world whenever john seen jesus christ come he was preaching for a while and he seen jesus christ come one day and he said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world he later said he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because the bridegroom's voice this is my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase and john said i must decrease whenever brother branham's job was done god took him home he's at rest he's at peace but god still got work to do and so god did not take the pillar fire away when he took the prophet away ram said in the voice of the sign john calling out the elected and give it over to christ when he come i love that i must increase i must decrease he must increase in john 1 35 again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he said behold the lamb of god and the two disciples heard him speak and they follow jesus when you really hear the voice behind the voice it won't make you follow a man it'll make you follow jesus because when you look in the scriptures do you know that john still had disciples after jesus after he introduced jesus he introduced jesus jesus came he he lived he did his work he died he was very resurrected and in the book of acts there were still people that were disciples of john and they were so blinded by the light they could not see who john introduced that's a repeat it's important we worship jesus christ but god sent a prophet to us to introduce him to us just like he sent eliezer to bring rebecca to isaac so whenever he heard him speak there was a disciple there were two disciples that heard john speaking and they said behold the lamb of god their disciples shifted their attention to jesus christ and one of them's name was andrew and remember we were dealing with go and tell the woman at the well after she had her experience she went and told somebody andrew went and got his brother he got his brother peter and said we found the messiah jesus called philip philip went and got his friend nathaniel see we have a work to do we have someone to tell malachi 3 revealed isaiah 53 the lamb of god he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we were healed when that man when that god man came down john identified him as the lamb of god and malachi 4 we were promised the prophet and did he send him he sent him and he vindicated him but it's to introduce jesus christ is to awaken and given the then give the bride a resurrection but you can't hear a man you've got to hear god brother ram dealt very heavily with the voice of the sign see just like whenever jesus came on earth people loved his miracles people loved it when jesus fed 5 000. people loved it when he changed the water to wine people loved it when he raised the dead people loved it when he cleansed the lepers but whenever he began to preach and one day he said that i and my father are one then they picked up stones and when jesus christ came in this day they love the miracles they love the discernment they love seeing people get up off wheelchairs but when he preached the word and the voice came they rejected it they refused it because remember the coming of a prophet is a sign that god is ready to speak god don't just do things haphazardly god don't just have you here haphazardly i believe god has us here because there's something he's wanting to speak so the coming of a prophet within himself is a sign that god is getting ready to speak jonah was in the belly of the fish and when he came out that was a type of resurrection but that wasn't it jonah just didn't come out of the fish and everybody was so amazed and impressed and everybody went home jonah had a had a message there was a voice to follow that sign and then the voice was repent or perish and that's the same voice that follows this sign people invited this man on purpose to draw a crowd and bring in money people try to use his gift for their own personal gain but when he began to preach they rejected him so think of what the blessing it is that the very thing the the very thing that people rejected him over is the very thing that attracts you we weren't we god took his prophet home we would love to be in his prayer line i'd give anything to be in his prayer line but god took him home but why are we gathered here because of the voice because of the voice because we heard the voice of god not the voice of a man the voice behind the voice and it caused a resurrection within us and it quickened us to life in the queen of sheba brotherham said an evil and adulterous generation seeks after signs and there will be no sign given them but the sign of jonah for as jonah was in the belly of the wealth three days a night so the son of man must be in the belly of the well three days and nights now you spiritual minded people open up what's that what's that don't just read right over it let the spirit catch it for you what kind of a generation was seeking after a sign this generation this is that evil and adulterous generation that would seek after a sign everywhere every little sign they seek after it said there'd be no sign but the sign of jonah what was jonah the sign of the resurrection hallelujah the resurrection jonah when he came out of the well was a prophecy of what jesus would experience in the earth when brother branham would take people and would and that same pillar of fire would come and stand he said not two foot from where he was standing and that would reveal this pillar fire the presence of jesus christ the logos would tell the people what what they've done what they will do and brought deliverance and healing and salvation to people that was the sign to prove that he indeed raised from the dead that was the sign of the resurrection but there was a voice pushing behind that sign the pillar of fire was here to say that there was a voice that was ready to speak god sent the prophet for what it wasn't just for signs and wonders that was to catch the attention of the people because he had something to say because it was elected child there was elected seeds of god that would come 50 and 60 years after god took him off the scene that would be quickened by the words that he said that god spoke through him so there's two signs a pillar of fire and a voice the voice of the sign is what's quickening the elected of this age and it's preparing us for a resurrection and a body change that's what we're on the very cusp of we are on the very edge of the resurrection we're on the very edge of the body change the accuracy of the word is 100 percent and has never failed it's the voice that wakes up the elect the signs just get her attention but you must hear the voice of god speaking if we just come to church and we only hear a man preach we get nothing out of service but if you can look past the man and just and just know that he's just dust and that and that he's just trusting god to set him aside and speak through him then you can get a blessing out of it but as long as you only see the man you'll walk out and just get with the word of a man but look past the man in revelation 18 4 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not her plagues aren't you thankful for an ear to hear aren't you thankful for a heart to receive the word of god aren't you thankful that while the world is dying while the world has got all their hopes and political ambitions got all their hopes on an election or has all their hopes on the next election whereas all their hopes on what their 401k is or the stock market that's a miserable way to live but our hope is in the word and the word has never failed amen listen to our feet the musicians will come in john 5 28 marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice so there's coming a time when everybody is going to hear his voice but we want to hear his voice now because when everyone that's in the graves will hear his voice then it's the day of judgment and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation so he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches ye must be born again when you hear the voice behind the voice and you really receive the word for your day it will bring about a change it will bring about a born-again experience and you'll never be the same and the holy ghost the born-again experience is the token it guarantees you a place it is a reservation at the wedding supper nobody else can take your place you've got your place reserved because you hold the token amen let's bow our heads and pray the gracious heavenly father lord jesus we thank you so much father for this
