Once I gather you under my knees, I will bring you the call again. Maybe they play that softly as we go to the prayer requests this evening. Want to remember each and every one of our elderly that God would just touch them in a supernatural way. I want to pray for brother Ron Vest's friend's father Joe Cow's needs a touch from the Lord. Want to remember brother Jeff Breeden that God would just touch him drive out that cancer as well and sister Wanda Hinkle and just remember her and the family there as well as sister Teresa Delaney. I want to pray for them as well as brother Bill there. I want to remember our pastor this morning that God would just touch him, strengthen him in his body as he brings the word of life to us. How many would have an unspoken request you'd like to lift up before the Lord this morning? Amen. I'm going to ask brother Matt McClard if he would just come pray over these needs for us. Lord bless you. I got 30 seconds. Everybody take a deep breath in right now. The Bible says, "Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord." Come on, somebody. Your team just won the national championship. Would you maybe lift your voice? But you got a God that walked up Mount Calvary and he saved your soul and gave you the Holy Ghost. He healed your body. He's taking you in a rapture. I don't know about you, but if you got breath in your lungs this morning, why don't you give him praise? Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Glory. Glory. Glory. The Bible also said they entered his courts with praise. Ain't it good to be a Christian? Amen. Let's bow our heads. Father, you're in the building this morning. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your mercy. Thank you for your grace. Thank you, Lord, for being longsuffering, Lord God. When we give up on oursel, Father, you didn't give up on us, Father. God, we've come together to gather, Lord, and to give you praise and to worship you, Lord, to hear your word, God, just to commune with you, Father. And God, we count it a great blessing to be in your midst, Father. Lord, everyone that's here, Father. God, I pray that you'd minister to every need, Lord. God, you see where they're weak, Lord. You see where they're struggling, God. God, you see where they need a word of encouragement, Father. God, you've tailor made this service, Father. God, that they would hear your voice. And Father, so we push back every demon that would try to break that or hinder that voice from being heard. But God, when they hear it, may they know it's straight from the mouth of God speaking to them, Father. And God, may they give joy. May they give their hearts to you this morning. And Father, I pray you bless Brother Ron. Lord, God, move him out of the way. Lord, use him like you've never used him before. God, may you minister through him, Lord Jesus. Move him out of the way. Not his thoughts, but God, may the anointing of God speak through our brother this morning, God. Lord, I pray for the ones that are sick. God, I pray you pass by that way right now. God, anoint their faith. Lord, the work's already done. We're already healed. It's already done. But God, may you just anoint their faith this morning to believe, Lord, and to start speaking over that cancer, to start speaking over that demon, Lord, that would try to hinder their life, Lord. Father, we just take this service committed to thy hands, Lord, knowing you do all things well. And God, we're just expecting great things this morning. Come and have thine own way. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. At this time, we're going to receive this this morning's offering. You give us God's blessed you. Have brother Marcus with us this morning. Glad to have him. We ask him if he would come and sing for us if he would. Then we'll have the adult choir after him this morning. God bless you. You can be seated after you've given. I've I've heard the song sung recently as a congregation. I was 12 years old. was the first song I sang in the house of the Lord and it was always a prayer in my heart was a part of it sounds like maybe for the ministry but we all know God uses us all in different ways of the ministry and preaching is not my calling we know but little nostalgia for me but I think it's a song of worship Jesus use me dear Lord I'll be a witness if You will help my weakness. For I know that I'm not worthy, Lord of thee. [Music] Oh, and by eyes of faith, I see thee upon the cross of Calvary. Behold your Lord I cry. Let me thy servant be. Oh Jesus [Music] use me. And oh Lord don't refuse me. Oh for surely Lord there's a work that I can do. Oh, and even though it's humble, oh, just help my will to crumble. Oh, though the cost be great, I'll work for you. Oh, and I'll stand for thee, dear Jesus. All even if death should come my way. Oh, I'll spread their gospel to the fallen here. Lord, and if it be thy will, Lord, ought to go across the sea. Oh, just help me to be willing to say yes. Jesus, [Applause] use me. Oh, Lord, don't refuse me. Oh, for surely surely there's a work that I can do. Oh, [Music] if it be my Lord for me all to praise his name. Oh, he's that lily, the lily of the valley. Lord, you're the bright and a morning star. You're the fairest, fairest of 10,000 to my soul.

This might be one of the most important sermons that I've ever preached to you. You must keep your spirit clean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 3 and verse 14. These are the conditions of the age that you're you're having to condemn with. And unto the angel of the church of the Leoysians, write these things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works. Thou art neither cold nor hot. And I would that thou were cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. And because thou sayest, I am rich and increase with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, blind, and naked. And I'd say this, we can agree with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich and in white raignment, that thou mayest be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear. And anoint thine eyes with that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Amen. God may God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. I mentioned to sister Connie this week what I was planning to speak on Monday and when I just said the words it the spirit of the Lord just filled the car and I thought this is a special moment. I remember many years ago in our young ministry uh once again when God calls a man he calls his wife. in our young ministry. We we had we had went through some things and and one particular fellow had stabbed me and pretty bad and murdered m maybe murdered me in his in his thoughts and you know sticks and stones may break your bones but words will never hurt. Well, that's not exactly true. And I could tell that it was wiring on Sister Connie. And and and it was a it was a day, it might have been a Saturday that I can remember. And I told her, I said, "Sister Connie, we need to take a walk." And so we own 90 acres of woods and we have a brother Homer built a road all the way around that so we could hunt there. And so, and so anyway, uh we were just taking a walk on that road and I said, "Connie, I'm your husband, but I'm also your pastor. I'm your shepherd. Now, today, I need to talk to you." Now, in talking to you, I need to just to just to tell you some things that that this will help you. No matter what happens in life, no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult that people say things against you, all of that is planned. God knows all about it. God doesn't ring his hands, but you have a responsibility, Connie. You got to keep your spirit clean. &gt;&gt; So today, I want to take you all on a walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I was telling Andrew the other day, I said, "You know, you know, Brother Brandon would share that when he was walking for that place where he would go and uh and and people wouldn't pay their light bill and he would go house to house and he would sit on their porch and talk to them." Let me just tell you something. I want to be really honest with you. I don't know if I've ever been late on a bill in my life, but I would purposely not pay my bill. &gt;&gt; For brother Brandham to come and sit on my porch &gt;&gt; for a while and just begin to tell a few stories and and he would sit there and you know what an atmosphere that that would be like &gt;&gt; and uh you know just have him there. I remember brother Shrewsbury before I get too started. Brother Shrewsbury said he was he was having a hitch on his on his vehicle welded. They were out in out in Colorado and and they were in the same vicinity where brother Brandham hunted. And uh this guy looked up at his license plate and it said West Virginia. And he said, "How closer are you to Jeffersonville?" He said, "Well, a few hours away." And he said, "Why would you say Jeffersonville?" He said, 'Look down the road right there is a store. It's got a porch on it. And he said that that that porch, Brother William Brandham, I don't know if you ever knew him. Said, "Yeah, I preached the message that he preached." He said, "Well, he used to come and sit on that porch when he would come here hunting." &gt;&gt; And he said, "We'd fill that porch up just to listen to his stories." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not brother Brandham, but I'd like to take you on a walk. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He said in dedication of a building, he said, "This tabernacle now belongs to God Almighty." He said, "You belong to God. God Almighty, always keep yourself clean. Keep your church clean. keep it upright so that anyone who travels might love to come in and fellowship with you and have such a sweet spirit till you can reach out a hand to anyone and offer them help. I want to say this preface before I'm preaching this sermon. I don't have anyone in mind. I just I just feel led to preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says now he said stay with it. Don't never let that spirit of worship and that clean holiness ever die among you. &gt;&gt; I think that's so powerful. &gt;&gt; Never let the spirit of worship and that clean holiness ever die among you. Can you imagine what he was seeing in the church world in that day and what we would see in the church world in this day? They let it die. Keep that light burning for if it's a lifeline of the church. He said, "That's right. It's Christ in his church." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would mention a few sermons that I that I've drawn a lot of things from. Is your life worthy of the gospel? &gt;&gt; The token and the greatest battle that's ever fought among many others. Brother Brandham would tell us that that God chose a place where the battleground would be in our life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It would be in our mind. &gt;&gt; I think if we were all honest today, we could raise our hands and say, "I battle in my mind." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I battle in my mind. No matter how long you've been a Christian, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You know, sometimes the devil beats you around. You've been a Christian for 30 years and still things come into your mind that &gt;&gt; where where did that come from? &gt;&gt; I was singing a love song to Connie this morning and it wasn't Amazing Grace. And and you think, where did that come from? Don't vote me out. Now, if there's a place that we've got to stay is under the blood. &gt;&gt; That's the place that we've got to stay. We got to stay in the spirit. Create an atmosphere. If you remember, brother Ram says, "And isn't anything too hard for the Lord?" You remember the visitation, Melzdc is on his way with the angels and steps into a body. And brother Ba explains how the theophony works. and and and here on earth on the day of the visitation, the day God himself is going to visit in their home, &gt;&gt; they've been walking with God now for decades, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you know, Sarah's getting old, Abraham's getting old, and he's still believing the promise. And it just so happens to be a day to where Sarah is in a mood. &gt;&gt; Stay with me now. &gt;&gt; Sarah's in a mood. She's thinking about Mrs. Lot. The caravans go by her house and they've got nice hats and they got nice clothes and &gt;&gt; we're out here in a desert and things are hot and things are dusty. She was in a mood, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But he said Abraham was sitting outside. Sometimes it's a place you got to go set. And he was sitting outside and he was keeping Brother Brandon said he was keeping himself in an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Keeping himself in an atmosphere. He didn't know God was coming. &gt;&gt; God hadn't sent him a letter that I'm coming by. No messenger had came. No one had came to talk to him and said, "Now listen, God himself in a theophony body is coming." &gt;&gt; But yet he kept himself in an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You say, "Where where is that important, brother Ron?" We are ready for rapture. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be just another typical day. We've already had our messenger. There's not another one coming. &gt;&gt; Greatest man since Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I appreciated what brother Andrew said about him last night. There'll never be another messenger. &gt;&gt; We as the five-fold ministry all have our different gifts. &gt;&gt; We're all part of the toolbox that God used, the dressear that God uses. None of us tries to imitate brother Brandham or try to be like him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We don't need impersonators. &gt;&gt; But but we understand that we've got to be ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we could understand readiness, &gt;&gt; I did a study and I preached when I was at my dad's church because I met a general and he began to talk to me about the readiness of the nuclear. And he had been a general in the nuclear department. And he just shared a few things with me. Nothing that was secret, but he shared a few things with me. He said, "You don't understand readiness. He said, "We're ready." He said, "Because if a bomb would come from Russia, &gt;&gt; we've either got to intercept it or we've got to send one there." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Once the exchange begins to happen, there's no stopping." &gt;&gt; There's no stopping. But before a bomb can drop, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; an atomic bomb can drop, listen, they're getting ready to come. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; They're getting ready to come. You can say, "Oh, but we're America's going to be in a revival." They're coming. &gt;&gt; They're coming. Los Angeles going to have an earthquake. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's not up for battle. Sodom and Gomorrah is here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Political system is rotten. Educational system is rotten. But there's a bride &gt;&gt; that has kept herself in an atmosphere. We got to have our heart ready. &gt;&gt; We got to make sure you you know I think about it. I I I think about, you know, how we must stay clean. I don't think I can describe it well enough. Our holiness just doesn't fit. We got to have God's holiness and and God's righteousness. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why we got to repent. It's why we got to have a prayer life. The the word you have a relationship with God. You say, "Well, brother Ron, I'm a young person and I don't know how to pray." Talk to God like he's your best friend. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Now, don't text him. &gt;&gt; Don't text him. Talk to him. Come on, &gt;&gt; talk to him. Because out of your being, you speak. &gt;&gt; And if you listen to somebody long enough, you know what's inside their heart. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? The power of God wants to reside in your life. It wants to live inside of you. It won't live in It won't live in the structure here, but he wants to live on the inside of you. But if God wants to live there, he will not live in an unclean vessel. &gt;&gt; You can't be one way on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; I don't think I need to preach this, but another way on Monday. &gt;&gt; You can't present yourself one way and then not another way &gt;&gt; and be accepted by God. Now listen, this world will never be comfortable with us. &gt;&gt; So you're always going to feel that little badger working on you. &gt;&gt; Listen, you'll never be won over by the world. &gt;&gt; And listen, you're going to always feel left out, rejected. &gt;&gt; You're always going to feel, well, I'm a little bit of an odd bird. Well, that's okay. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's okay to be odd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, my mind, my mind. I just so many things in my mind. The scripture says renewing of the mind. &gt;&gt; There's things that you must pray for. God, help me &gt;&gt; to have these memories &gt;&gt; taken from my mind. Brother Matt Watkins said something the other day and I don't never want it to be forgotten. &gt;&gt; Feelings are overrated. &gt;&gt; Look over at your neighbor, say feelings. Now, you can't pour living water in a contaminated pipe. &gt;&gt; I used to work in a facility and I I was a chief operator in nitroglycerin. We made nitroglycerin and and then from that we contaminated the water by by making nitroglycerin and through that we had to have chemicals to treat it and then there was a phenomenal filter system and then that that water had to be able to be turned back into the river. So I was responsible to make sure that I could drink the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. that I could drink the water that I had now filtered. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And if you think about that today, could your neighbor say that life that you are living &gt;&gt; is the life of Christ. I'm not talking about quotes. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about pictures on the wall. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm not talking about he said, she said, but do they recognize the power of the living Christ &gt;&gt; coming out of your life? &gt;&gt; I want you to remember remember there's seven holes in your head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Two ears, two nostrils, and two eyes. The ears and the eyes are the gateway to your soul. Be careful what you're allowing to go in them. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, I realize I'm going to get to that other one in a minute cuz that's the one that causes you trouble. &gt;&gt; Now, I realize that we're young. We're we're busy. We got to be entertained &gt;&gt; every moment of the day. That's the why that that's the why we don't like long sermons because we we lose our our thoughts our you know we you know because commercials even now are 28 seconds it seems like and there's 10 of them so we lose track so quickly and that's why gaming becomes such an issue. &gt;&gt; Before long our children are gaming. I mean, they're gaming and gaming and gaming and gaming and it takes you somewhere and your mind, you don't realize the influence that's behind the game. &gt;&gt; Parents, you're responsible. &gt;&gt; I know I'm not telling you nothing new, but you're responsible to hold the token over your house. &gt;&gt; Just like a dress, just like a pants. You know, we preach on boys that with their skinny jeans and their great big necklaces and all these different kind of things, but where does the influence come from? &gt;&gt; Girls, where the where's the dressing comes from? Before long, the heels are like this and the heels are like that. Brother Tom Ray said the other day said, "I'm gonna bring a chainsaw to church." I haven't looked. So, I'll have Matthew do that. But the one that causes us the most trouble is our tongue. &gt;&gt; Life and death is in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; That's what your scripture says. And you can create a negative atmosphere &gt;&gt; by just a few words. &gt;&gt; But what about the opposite of that? Let's create a powerful faith atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Notice every one of us are influencing somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; One of my neighbors, we were chasing cows last week and and uh when I got home, I was in my suit and there was about eight cows in my my my my fields and uh I said, "Well, I got to find out where these are coming from." And so I went to I went to one neighbor. No, not there. They're not mine, but you can go over to that one. But he's got a bad dog over there. Well, I never saw the dog. And I went and he's big old boy like brother Josh back there. And he come out and he looked at me in a suit. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm on my buggy and and I said, "I can show you where the cows are." You know, he came back a little bit later and and uh we got one set up and then we came back another and got another set up and we still had one missing. So he asked my granddaughters, he said, "Where's that fancy guy at?" So he knocked on the door and here I come out in sweats and a t-shirt. fancy guy's gone. Glory. &gt;&gt; So, we spent the evening. 9:00 was the last time that we were still still out looking for one of them. And another neighbor, I I pulled up beside him and we begin to talk about life and how life was. And talk about something. He said, "I want to I want to tell you something. If I've ever saw a Christian, it's you." &gt;&gt; I tell you, I thought I felt like weeping. I'd hardly I'd h hardly had any conversation with him at all. He said, 'If I've ever sought a Christian, it's you. And he said, 'I mean something to me. He said, I'll tell you what it means to me. If I had a real need, I'd call you and say, would you pray for me? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not really not talking about just me. I'm talking about you. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you. Could your friends call you up and say, "I got a need." Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram say I've always I've always thought this is a powerful quote. If you want to find out how great you are, &gt;&gt; put your finger in a pool of water or a bucket of water and then pull your finger out and try to find where you put your finger in. &gt;&gt; He said you're nothing. &gt;&gt; God can can do without you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam's just laying it right down for us. &gt;&gt; God can do without you. He can do without me. But we cannot do without him. We have to have him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he is life &gt;&gt; and he alone. Not to know a book, not to know this or know that or some creed, but to know him is life. to know him as a person as Christ in you, the word made flesh. Jesus would even say it, I can do nothing &gt;&gt; except my father showed me. And I think it's about 17 different ways that he says that in the scriptures. If Jesus could say that, &gt;&gt; oh, don't you love the Lord? In Psalms chapter 51 and verse 6, I'd like you to pick that up with me. Psalms 51 and verse 6. This is a powerful scripture because David just opens his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold, thou desires truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part that thou shalt make me to know wisdom. Purge me with hissip and I shall be clean. Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out my iniquities. Notice these next words. Let's just say it together. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Notice these words. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with a free spirit. David of all people could say this. David was forgotten as a child. You you imagine how difficult that is to be forgotten. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the boys are lined up, who's going to be the next king? &gt;&gt; Jesse doesn't call him. &gt;&gt; Listen, that leaves a chip on your shoulder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That gets in your spirit. &gt;&gt; And then when it comes to battle Goliath, when he walks up, his brothers make fun of him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he starts fighting the battle of intimidation. All right. &gt;&gt; Another chip on the SP. You imagine it gets in your spirit. &gt;&gt; He goes before Saul and Saul makes fun of him. &gt;&gt; Then he goes before Goliath and Goliath makes fun of him. &gt;&gt; Then he kills Goliath. Then war after war, he's killing his thousands. And the girls begin to sing. He's killed his tens of thousands. Saul has killed his thousands. David's killed his tens of thousands. He winds up in the house of Saul. &gt;&gt; And Saul now wants to kill him. &gt;&gt; You ever get to a spot to where you go, I can do no right. [Music] &gt;&gt; He gets married to Saul's daughter. Then he finds himself exiled &gt;&gt; without a home, without family, &gt;&gt; but I want to remind you all of these journeys, all of these parts of the journey, he's still God's. &gt;&gt; He's still God's. God's still got a plan. God's potential is laying inside of him. I don't care what stage of the journey that you're going through and how your feelings are getting hurt and the difficulties of the valley of the shadow of death &gt;&gt; and your spirit is constantly at war, you're still God's. I thought about going back from exile, back to his wife. And now Saul has given his childhood wife that he won in the battle of Goliath to another man. &gt;&gt; You talking about life stinking? &gt;&gt; I'm finally home. Well, obviously he got her back. &gt;&gt; I don't know specifically if I'd want her, but David, the ark of the Lord is being restored back to its rightful place. And David gets so excited, &gt;&gt; he dances. Right? &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've you look at it, but he dances 17 miles. &gt;&gt; Listen, he dances. &gt;&gt; He's more than his flesh. He's in the spirit. &gt;&gt; He dances. &gt;&gt; You know, people don't want emotion in the church are dead. &gt;&gt; But they don't get that out of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, Brother Bram said such and such. I can't find it. I got the same message you got laying in front of you. &gt;&gt; I find Brother Brandham dancing around a tree. &gt;&gt; I find Brother Brandham sitting on the platform and dangling to his feet. I find him running up and down the aisles. I find him going all across. &gt;&gt; So I'm not reading the same message. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, "Anything without emotion is dead." &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, we don't like your emotion. Cut it off. We don't need you watching. No way. &gt;&gt; What are you doing, brother? I'm keeping my spirit clean. &gt;&gt; And he gets done dancing and he comes back to the house and his wife is making fun of him. Right? &gt;&gt; Listen, there's no careful how I say this. &gt;&gt; There's nobody can get to your heart or to your spirit like somebody close to you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But the devil won't only use your enemy. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He'll use your closest friends. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, let me just say this to you. I don't care how old you get, you're still going to be at war with this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to call your ages now, but you can be my age and your friends all of a sudden turn into a bunch of teenage girls Barbie dolls in a drama class and you think, "What in God's names happened here?" &gt;&gt; Amen. But in spite of all that, you have got to keep your spirit clean. &gt;&gt; They will get it worked out. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, how does that work? You remember when you was a little child, your mom and daddy had a tiff. &gt;&gt; Boy, I'm preaching to angels. and your mom and daddy had a little tiff in the kitchen and you as children went, "Oh my goodness, they're arguing. They're getting loud." And you go up and you pray. Well, your mom and dad go somewhere and fix it. &gt;&gt; They go somewhere and fix it and it's over. &gt;&gt; It's over. But you as a child don't know it's over. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That happens as grown-ups, too. &gt;&gt; God will go fix it and then you few in your flesh, if you're not careful, are still in the same mind frame. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So, you got to keep your spirit clean. That's good. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; I got a reason for saying that. Cuz many times people will come into church and they've had a history in their life and you're thinking about their history, but they went and got it fixed. And they're not the same person anymore. &gt;&gt; So you got to get your spirit clean. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm preaching the right sermon to the right people. Hallelujah. That's a great thing. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5. in Jesus's preaching. And he opened his mouth and he taught them, saying, "Blessed are the pure and poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." In the scriptures, it talks about a man writing about himself that he was the meakest man in the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you can tell me who that was? &gt;&gt; Moses. Moses wrote had to write about himself that he was the meakest man in the earth yet he was tempered and that temper was not in a good way. But we're not going to talk about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want you to think, Matthew, you're going to like this. Meekness is not weakness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was a one-man invasion. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Into the greatest military power of that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The high civilization of that day. He comes in not in a three-piece suit, &gt;&gt; but with a long stick in his hand. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; With I am in his lips. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; He was not a weak man walking in. He was a meek man walking in. &gt;&gt; A one-man invasion. Listen, that nation did not realize that their history was about over with. &gt;&gt; They had fought no a lot of wars, but they were coming to an end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, show me a picture of the end. If we could show the picture of the United States has had their messenger. That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't come out of no halls of great learning. &gt;&gt; He was met by an angel &gt;&gt; in a cave. &gt;&gt; And listen, America was going to get a warning. &gt;&gt; There was going to be a lot of great speakers come on the scene at the same time from Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and I don't want to go down the whole list, but a phenomenal speakers. But one man had an angel with him &gt;&gt; and he was going to send a message around the world. &gt;&gt; He would preach to presidents and he would preach to great congressmen. The miracles that would follow him were beyond phenomenal. &gt;&gt; But that was only to catch the attention. But there was a bride [Music] &gt;&gt; that could exemplify humility and meekness. &gt;&gt; But don't let that catch you. We are the most powerful people in the earth. &gt;&gt; We are not a bunch of drama students. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not a bunch of people that are up and down all the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if I'm in. I wonder if I'm out. Listen, we're steady sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; We're powerp packed individual. When the weakest of Christians go on their knees, they shake the kingdom of hell. &gt;&gt; Our families are strong. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Our families, our character is strong. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. This message works. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus would say this, you're the salt of the earth. If you remember what salt is used for is to preserve, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's to preserve. Many of you are gardeners here. Now, listen. I love fresh tomatoes. I love them. I love them. I love them too much. I love fresh peaches. I love fresh apples. &gt;&gt; I love fresh donuts. &gt;&gt; Catching you. See if he was asleep. But you can't keep tomatoes but just a few days. &gt;&gt; You can't keep apples but just a few days. I'm I'm coming to you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So you got to put salt in them. You got to put a brine to them. I don't know how to do it. I just trust you. And you can eat them babies 10 years later. &gt;&gt; If the seal has not been broken, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But too many times, churches become rotten &gt;&gt; because their spirit is not clean by the salt of the word of God. And before long, church members &gt;&gt; are just rotten. Pull pits become rotten. &gt;&gt; Listen, there ain't nothing about rotten I want to eat. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take but one bad apple to run a bushel. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's left alone, it'll contaminate others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It'll contaminate others. Now, there's sometimes we have our little children as they begin to grow up and they've got cute ways. They're naughty, but they're cute. If you leave that alone, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; they get past the fouryear-old &gt;&gt; and before long, little brats become bitter breaths. &gt;&gt; And you know what we'll do? We'll blame the teacher &gt;&gt; cuz we don't want to take responsibility. Stinking teachers &gt;&gt; and then we'll blame bosses. &gt;&gt; We'll blame UVA teachers. You know, once they go up, they'll keep because you didn't do your job. &gt;&gt; You didn't take responsibility. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I love my child so much. We put him in the corner. What if that don't work? &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, I just love my baby so much. That ain't love. &gt;&gt; If you love them, you'll straighten them out. &gt;&gt; If you truly love I'm not talking about beat him with anger. &gt;&gt; Have a conversation. This is why I got to do it. &gt;&gt; Not that you got such a hot head and things ain't going your way. &gt;&gt; Let me say this right here. No home should be an abusive home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No home. &gt;&gt; No home. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, my wife my my my wife beats me. &gt;&gt; My husband beats me. Leave. &gt;&gt; Leave his stinking. &gt;&gt; Not going to finish it. Leave him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz it will not get better without a conversion. &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother, I'll marry him and I'll straighten him out. No, you won't. You ain't got &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, I I can straighten people out. Okay, go on a diet. Go on a diet and come back to me three weeks later and tell me you haven't had sugar. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I got weak, brother. I got weak. And there that crispy crew and it looked so lonely. I had a bowl of spaghetti that big. The posture was so great. I just couldn't resist. &gt;&gt; And you can change. You can't change yourself. &gt;&gt; You can't change yourself. Well, Brother Ron, how do I keep my spirit clean? Prayer. &gt;&gt; Reading your Bible and praying and listening to the message. Stay in the atmosphere of God. &gt;&gt; Don't You don't need self-help books. &gt;&gt; You don't need to go to Barnes & Noble and spend $500 on how to help yourself. &gt;&gt; The only guy you're going to make rich is the guy that wrote that book. &gt;&gt; I get so tickled to have a book out, How to Become Rich. You read this book, you'll learn the secrets of how to become rich. &gt;&gt; $49.95. &gt;&gt; You know who got rich? The guy that wrote the book. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, who do I go to right here? &gt;&gt; This book right here &gt;&gt; will take care of your financial situations. Brother Ron, you're tell you're you're messing with me now. Okay, &gt;&gt; brother, I want to take my money and I want to make an investment into my future. I don't know if you know this or not, and I'm not a money preacher, but when that plate passes by you, &gt;&gt; you are making an investment in your future, &gt;&gt; that's just not an investment for here when you get to heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The things that you've done on earth for Jesus, then when you get to heaven, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; now I'm going to meddle. Jesus said in Luke 17 verse1, "Don't you tighten up on me &gt;&gt; cuz we're walking. Don't you can't tighten up and walking. You'll hurt your back." Then said he unto the disciples, it is impossible but that offenses it is impossible but that offenses will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But woe unto them through whom they come. &gt;&gt; Listen. Offenses is going to come your way. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna say it again. Offences is going to come your way. Is this working? &gt;&gt; Offenses is going to come your way. &gt;&gt; But notice the next part. But woe unto them. &gt;&gt; Don't take your gun out and shoot them. &gt;&gt; God will take care of you. &gt;&gt; He will fight for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So when somebody says something, don't empty your mind. You need that. &gt;&gt; But woe unto them whom they come. &gt;&gt; That's right. They are going to have a payday. &gt;&gt; Notice now, brother, I need proof. Okay, next verse. It were better for them that a millang stone was hanged about his neck, and he was cast into the sea than he that should offend one of these little ones. I don't think you got it. Let's read it together. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you read it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look to your neighbor. Say, "Did you get that?" So the next time, &gt;&gt; the next time somebody gets in your spirit, &gt;&gt; remember this scripture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They have a payday coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As sure as the sun will come up tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is part of keeping your spirit clean. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't you try to fix it. &gt;&gt; God's got it. &gt;&gt; This is what I told Sister Connie probably 25 years ago. I said, "You don't have to fix this." &gt;&gt; And she didn't have to fix it. You just do the next part. Forgive. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take heed unto yourself. If any brother trespass against thee, rebuke him. And if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespasses against thee seven times a day, and seven times in a day, turn again and thee to thee and saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him. He don't say it just once, he says it twice. And then Matthew chapter 18 verse 21. And then came Peter to him and said,"Lord, how often of all people that ask this, Peter, there always going to be one in the crowd, baby." And then Peter said unto him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?" Now, he was looking for a hammer. &gt;&gt; Amen. till seven times. And Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee until seven times, but until 70* 7. &gt;&gt; So don't make fodder out of them at the supper table. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't kill the preacher at the supper table. &gt;&gt; Forgive him. Not just once to soothe your conscience. &gt;&gt; 490 times a day. &gt;&gt; Why, brother Ron? To keep you clean. &gt;&gt; Ain't going to keep him clean, &gt;&gt; but to keep you clean. &gt;&gt; Now remember, character is the only thing that you're going to take with you. You're not going to take asphalt, gold that is in heaven. You're not going to take your gold. Brother Homer, almost every funeral would say there's no U-Haul following &gt;&gt; the casket. Amen. &gt;&gt; For most of us, there's not great big executives of the world coming to see our funeral. &gt;&gt; I've got friends that I if I would have a funeral, I got friends that would show up looking like the mafia. Don't get mad at me. They're still my friends. &gt;&gt; Cuz you've got to have friends in the world as well. &gt;&gt; But you can't let them influence you. &gt;&gt; That's right. You got to influence them. &gt;&gt; So, I was I was with Sister Wanda the other day as she was getting her chemotherapy. Now, listen, they will never let me preach in there. I've been there. They'll never let me go there and preach. But, you know what they did? They let her come and be a patient. And she's preaching to them &gt;&gt; with her life. &gt;&gt; You remember there was two birds that left the ark. &gt;&gt; Two birds. One of them was a dove. Brother Brandham preaches several sermons on the lamb and the dove. preaches on the on the wings of a snow white dove and he uses a dove over and over as a type of the spirit of God. A dove doesn't have to wash himself. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to get in the pond and figure figure it all out and get himself washed up, then go over in the ground and shake himself off. &gt;&gt; There's something the all that is on the inside of him. &gt;&gt; Sure, he gets dusty. Sure, life gets on him. Right. Come on. &gt;&gt; But there's an oil on the inside of him that pushes all of that out. &gt;&gt; Help me finish now. &gt;&gt; Sure, we're going to live in this world and we're going to get stuff on us. &gt;&gt; We're going to make mistakes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get it down. We're going to make mistakes. &gt;&gt; But God don't throw you away with a diaper. God puts a oil inside of you, the Holy Ghost, that you repent immediately. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's just there's something about the checker station of the Holy Ghost that when you think something wrong, it's it's just a checker real quick. I mean, &gt;&gt; it's better than IBM or better than Apple. You say something that you shouldn't have said &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden you just go, I'm sorry. Hey, listen. I'm sorry. I I I am sorry. I don't know what made me say that. I I am sorry. You come in in the wrong mood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sarah got visited by God and she was in a bad mood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say, God comes visits us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll feel a sweep of the warmth presence in your kitchen. &gt;&gt; You'll be down praying and all of a sudden you feel that presence of God. &gt;&gt; I don't want to have to go run and hide anything. That's right. Good. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't want anything on the slate that I've done or said that I'm be ashamed of before God &gt;&gt; cuz he already knows. &gt;&gt; Someone came to me many years ago and said, "Brother Ron, but I got I got all this thing in my life and I'm so ashamed." I said, "I want to tell you. I'm going to give you a news bulletin. God already knows." &gt;&gt; He already knows. Just ask him to forgive you. Okay, I'm going to have to quit, but I want I want to take you on a walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember brother Brandham was working at that job and this is the reason I told the story that he would go down and sit on people's porch and &gt;&gt; talk to them. We'd all love to have him come talk to us. I mean, really, I Yeah, baby. Brother Brandon marries two people, marries two couples. You remember that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you haven't heard it lately, go back and listen to Choosing of a Bride. He'll he'll tell you about marrying two couples. It's good for this front row. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's &gt;&gt; good for this front and bad now. The second row, third row back there. And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good for you girls, too. It's two couples. One is rich. come from two very wealthy, established families. You know, somebody had asked him to marry him and you know, he said he had to go through all different kind of things, kneel down and say all these things, go through it. They were rich. He had a lot of different things. And and he said, uh, it turned out they had a great big old house, huge house. Then there was a another couple that his brother said he brought to him and and brother Brandham said I didn't want to marry him. He said I had to figure out if they were old enough to get married if they had permission to get married. He said I had talked to them for a little while and I figured out they they really loved each other. &gt;&gt; Didn't have any money but they loved each other. Let me let me say this to you. Money does not make the world go round. And when you first Christian, can I talk to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz these guys ain't getting it. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, Christian, you guys have been married how long? &gt;&gt; Don't fail this test. You've been married two months, man. It's been great. It's just awesome. Now, I know by history that you're not a millionaire. I don't know. How about you, girl? I just don't know. Don't leave me hanging. Don't you leave me hanging. And so I I don't know. I presume that you're a millionaire. There's going to be times since you're not a millionaire. There's going to be times to where things are difficult. Money's tight. You don't want to ask mom and daddy. You just asking God, "God, help us. God help us." Those things are character building in your life. There's things that you're going to see that other people have that you'd really like to have in your home, but you can't get on the top of the ladder without climbing. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to have to drive some beetle bummers &gt;&gt; and you're going to have to, you know, maybe not have the best furniture in the world, but you've got love. And I want to tell you that's the greatest thing that you can have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the greatest thing that you can have. But trying to keep up with the Joneses will make your spirit impure. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? The Joneses have to be responsible for the money that they have &gt;&gt; and you have to be responsible for what you got. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, Brother Brandham marries this young couple. His brother tells him and brother Brandham preaches a simple simple wedding for them and they get married. Now, today he's going to take a walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish the sermon with this. He's going to take a walk and I'm going to walk to your house. Ain't that nice? &gt;&gt; Ain't that nice? You'd like to me to shake your hand and hug your neck? Well, that's what I'm going to do right here for you. I'm coming to your house. So, first of all, he goes down over the railroad tracks. He hears that this couple is living, you'll like this, living in a railroad car. That was kind of popular in that day. They was living in a railroad car and they had cardboard for a a door and tacky buttons he would say over it. And he says, "I was being just a little bit of a hypocrite." And he said, "I slipped up to listen." And when he slipped up to listen, the husband had been downtown and he'd walked by a store and he walked by a window that had the most beautiful dress and he was thinking, "I would love I'd love to get that for her." Well, of course he would. He loves her with all of his heart. She's in a sack dress, a made sack dress. Those are popular then. I remember I remember my grandmother used to wear sack dresses, my great-grandmother especially, and uh not gonna go any further, but anyway, brother slipped up and she's sitting on his lap. Sitting on his lap and he's explaining to her, I walked, he tells the story, I walked down the street and I walked by a window and I saw this dress and I'd just love to get it for you. She didn't create an argument with him. She said, "Oh, honey, the one I've got is so nice. I don't need a new dress." And he said, "They had love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to sort it. Then he goes to the mansion. &gt;&gt; He goes to the mansion. When he goes there, he slips up and there's a little tussle or what we call a tiff that's going on. They had been at a party and dancing and she'd been dancing in another man's arms and they were having a tiff over this. Money didn't fix their problems. &gt;&gt; Right. Being in the who's who of a of great factory owners didn't fix the problems, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And brother Random asked the question in choosing of a broad, which one would I rather be? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why is sermon like this important? You are the bride of heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; This world is not our home. &gt;&gt; Millionaire or not millionaire, it don't matter. &gt;&gt; Good car, bad car, don't matter. Good lawn mower, bad lawnmower, don't matter. &gt;&gt; We got to have character. &gt;&gt; We must have the character of Jesus Christ. an extra chair at our table for Jesus. He's always welcome. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell a personal story that I know to finish. Brother Brandham had a lot of scoffers and critics. We all know that Jesus had them. David had them. You got them. Brother Brham had two opposites. He had one group that wanted to worship him as God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's wrong. &gt;&gt; And the others was criticizing everything that he was doing. Couldn't do no right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never do no right. But William Brandham, the ministry of William Brandham was Christ in action in this day. &gt;&gt; He was a God man on the earth. TL Osburn would call him a Jesus man on the earth. And I'd say we could all say that would be correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all could say that. That would be correct. We saw the actions in the life of Jesus Christ living on the inside of him. &gt;&gt; People didn't come out to hear him preach. They come out to see God in action. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what people want to hear here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to see God here. That's right. &gt;&gt; Every service should be a convention service. &gt;&gt; This might be a quieter sermon, but let me just say, if we get this today, &gt;&gt; your homes will be different. Your life will be different. &gt;&gt; What if brother Random slipped up to our home? Slipped up our home. I wonder if the shutters would have to be closed real quickly. I wonder if a fight would be ensuing. Or I wonder if she'd be sitting on the lap &gt;&gt; and you just be talking about the love of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Random was in Switzerland at a hotel. Brother Random was not only the most powerful, but he also the most humble to me. That's what made him even more powerful. He was not the one that was always talking at the table. He was listening at the table. Table was full of preachers. The story tells me that it was about 20 different preachers that was sitting there. who's who preachers that was taking care of brother Brandham, the host host pastor, the host people. And brother Brandham was sitting kind of in the middle of the table. The host pastor looked over at him and he said, "Brother Brandham, there's a man that's walking around the table and he doesn't seem to be finding a a seat." I want you to catch this. And brother Brandham leaned into him and he said, "That's the angel of the Lord. He won't be needing a seat." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes if he comes to your house, what kind of a presence does he find? I'm not just talking about the structure of your house where it's brick or mortar or vinyl siding. I'm talking about this house. &gt;&gt; This house. &gt;&gt; I met Sam in the office just a few moments ago with his wife. I don't have to know him a year to know that the Lord lives in his house. &gt;&gt; There's nothing better than to have Jesus living right here. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about signing your name on a book. I'm not I'm not talking about doing all kind of rituals. I'm talking about to really know him. I don't care how long that you come here. Your attendance is wonderful. No matter how much tithes that you give, that's I so appreciate that. That goes into the kingdom of God to do a lot of different things. But let me just say this to you. What means more to me than anything in this world is to see that atmosphere around you that is Jesus. That's the most important thing in your life because if that's there, &gt;&gt; love will be there. &gt;&gt; Power will be there. &gt;&gt; Influence will be there. &gt;&gt; Every part of the body of Christ will be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living on the inside of you. You won't have to tell where you go to church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You won't have to tell who your pastor is, but the power of Christ will mean more than anything in your life. Could you say amen? &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. There was a woman that had one child. That child was the money maker of the family. that child died. You can imagine how difficult it was to realize that life as we know it is over. But she didn't realize that the rabbi of rabbis, the Messiah of Messiah was coming to the funeral. You know, he wouldn't walk to where that they were going to do all their rituals, but brother Bram said he would walk to a culvert and he would set down on a culvert. Now, here's what brother Bram said because he would give us insight. He said Jesus had a headache and he was sat on that cart all day long. He wouldn't even describe to the disciples why he was there. He wouldn't tell them nothing about what I'm here to do today, but he was waiting on the funeral. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he had a plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That woman, her life was devastated because of this death. &gt;&gt; But Jesus had an answer for that. &gt;&gt; I want you to know in this service, you may think, "Well, he's a million miles away." when he's sitting real near to you &gt;&gt; and he's got an answer for you. &gt;&gt; Now, when the barrel passes by and they're carrying that that boy on the top and they've got they got flowers and things as they would have over top of him and maybe singing songs, singing songs of sorrow. Jesus didn't lament the situation. He stopped the funeral. &gt;&gt; Amen. when he stopped the funeral, he spoke life to that child. &gt;&gt; Now, we don't know the rest of the story, but that child from that day forward, no doubt he asked a question, what happened? What happened? We really don't know. Maybe it was a heart attack or we really don't know, but you died and we were having a funeral for you. I don't remember anything that happened. But all we can tell you is Jesus came by and the way that we hear it, he sat there all day. We didn't even know he was there. But he said all day waiting on nuts to come by. Now, maybe you drove 20 miles, maybe you drove two hours, maybe you drove four, maybe you drove eight, but whether you know it or not, Jesus, come by, he knows how to take a stony heart, [Music] make it a heart of love, a heart of joy. He knows how to take a bickering tongue, make it a heart that'll sing love songs. He knows how to take the desires of your flesh and turn it all the way around and make you an individual that you never thought you'd be. A prince among men, a queen among ladies. I don't know if you've been looking around here, but you're the kingom of the crop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether you in Walmart or on your job or in your school, you're the queen of heaven. And if I can say anything to you, keep your spirit clean. Keep your spirit clean. Whatever comes your way. Keep your spirit clean, brother Ron. But you don't know. Keep your spirit clean. &gt;&gt; Don't let it affect you. Cuz what it'll do, it'll affect your prayer life. It'll affect your marriage. It'll affect your love to your children. It'll affect your love to God. It'll block up the holes to where the the Holy Spirit can flow into your life. And I want to tell you Jesus is here to help you with that today. Amen. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, as we felt the love of God all through this service, Lord God, we pull ourselves up to the altar and say, "Father, I want to be drinking from the wells of living water. There is a fountain in the house of David. God, I ask you don't let nothing get in my life. Nothing get in my life. Lord God, nothing. No matter what happens, what goes Lord God, come and live in my life like never before. Forgive us, Father. Lord, I dedicate my life to you. I dedicate my family to you. I dedicate this church to you. Thank you for this walk today that we've had. May we be better Christians. We pray in Jesus Christ's name I ask you. I've had a few loss in my life. I've walked with Sister Connie. One day, little Reagan was having a horrible day. She was out of control. Dad and mom was fussing and fussing and she just wasn't getting it. I said, "Baby doll, why don't we take a walk?" I took her by the hand and we started walking. You remember that? How old would you been? Four, five years old. You know, God has to take a walk with us sometimes cuz we just lose it. I took her by the hand. I walked with her. I said, "Baby Do, you don't know this, but you're somebody special. You're a daughter of Jesus. not just a daughter of Andrew and Katie and a granddaughter to me. But I said, "You don't have to act like that. That's a devil that's trying to make you act like that." You know what? By the time we made that loop, she was in a complete different atmosphere. I'll tell you, love will change your life. Love will change your life. Turn to your neighbor and say, "Love will change my life. Amen. Let's sing it to you. I love you with all my heart. [Music] Lord, and I'll come running back to you. Oh, draw me. [Music] Oh, draw me, Lord. And I'll come running back to you. Oh, you alone are all that I need. you for you all my days. For you are all that I need. I am the complete draw me. Oh, draw me, Lord.

And as the thunder rolls, I barely hear you whisper through the rain. I'm with you. And as your mercy falls, I raise my hand and praise the God who gives and takes away. Oh, and I'll praise you in this storm. And I will lift my hands for you are who you are. No matter where I am and every tear I cry. Oh, you hold in your hand. You never left my side.

And as your mercy falls, I raise my hand and praise the God who gives and takes away. [Laughter] Lord, I'll praise you in this world and I will lift my hands for you are who you are.

And I never ever want to drive away the dove of the Holy Spirit. But even so, God, if I have, may I repent and turn back to you so the dove of the Holy Spirit will fly to my heart. [Music] Let the oil of the Holy Ghost bathe over our souls, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let it cleanse us from within and without, oh Lord Jesus. For we know, God, that before us is the greatest event that has ever been known. We have heard the shout. We have heard the cry of the midnight hour. We've been woke up. This bride has heard the thunder of her master's call. We can't go back to sleep to these revelations, Lord Jesus. [Music] Lord, you're a God that is rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; You're a God that wants communion with your children. And Father, [Music] we want you to have a place that you could dwell in that you could say, "That's my house. That's my dwelling place." Oh, Solomon's temple was beautiful. as it moved on and on. But the glory of the latter house shall be greater than the former. Father, we love you, [Music] Lord. I want to love you more [Music] than I ever have before. Lord, you're so easy to adore.

Let's just all pray and believe together. Our gracious father, as we just come to you, Lord, we've heard from you. And father, as we just depart from these buildings, may the word of God that we heard don't depart from our heart. And Lord, no matter the situation that comes, no matter the time the what the enemy's got to throw at us, Lord, we know you're a very present help in the time of need. And Father, you've proved that to me. You've proved it, Lord, time and time again. But father, this weekend, Lord, it was manifested in such a way that even an unbeliever couldn't doubt that almighty God was with us. And Lord, I just want to say thank you for the prayer of the saints. And Lord, how much it means to a believer to know other believers are praying. And Father, the kindness, the love that was showed. Father, I just pray Lord Jesus, you can repay a hundfold. But Father, more important than that is the hundfold that we've received today. And Lord, as we depart, may your presence, may what we've heard, may the people that come in contact with us, may they see Christ inside of us. May we represent you Lord here on this earth in such a way till they get salty. And father we love you. We appreciate you. Thank you L Lord for your grace and mercy. And we do commit all things in your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] You're dismissed at this time. God richly bless you. Lord, I want to love you more than I ever have before.
