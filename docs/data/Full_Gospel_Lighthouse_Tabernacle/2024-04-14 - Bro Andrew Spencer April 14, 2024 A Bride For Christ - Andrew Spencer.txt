each and every one of you this morning so honored that you're here for not just the service but also for the wedding today and we're so looking forward to what brother Andrew has to bring forth this morning what a wonderful service we had with brother Isaac last night and and I just so enjoyed that isn't God good to us I'd just just like to say thank you for your prayers for me me over the last couple of weeks and and uh before we went to to Louisiana Youth Camp the Monday before on that Saturday before that we had begin to have some heart issues and I begged the cancer doctors to let me go to the camp and I told them I'd be a good boy and they wanted to put me in the hospital and they're good doctors they wanted to put me in the hospital to help me and run EKG and that didn't show anything but they knew the story was the story and so we went to Louisiana by God's grace we had incredible meetings on Saturday night I spoke over about an hour and a half and then we had a thre hour prayer line I don't know there was lot of you that was in that prayer line and you knew what what that was all about amen thank you Lord I didn't make it to the service till the next morning because it was just too weak and we got on an airplane that evening and I had a good day Monday and then on Tuesday morning I woke up and I was very I was very sick and then I I went to a doctor and kind of told him what was going on he said well you need to be seen I didn't tell Connie that but and then I went to we went to eat and uh then after that we had a couple of things to do when we were on our way home I said uh I think I'm going to need to be seen and and I said well maybe maybe we'll wait till tomorrow I'll get on the treadmill in the morning if I have trouble in the morning uh I'll let you take me to the doctor how many men are in the building I just described every one of you go ahead wives punch your husbands that's it's a truth the squad picked me up on on on T Tuesday and they took me to the hospital at AMC and then then we were there and as we were there and they begin to work on me they told me my EKG was good everything was looking good and then they pulled blood work and said we got a problem and then and then right while they were working Matthew was getting ready to go home had already started home and he had left about 10 minutes and then I had a massive heart attack the doctor told me on the way down to the to the to the cathb he said had this happened anywhere else you would be in real bad trouble and so God knows exactly where for you to have a massive heart attack at and so so we was an AMC and a couple stance were put in on there then they were nervous about working on the Widow Widowmaker and so they sent me to UVA and there we begin to be have work done on us again and God was just good to us and uh that's all I can say we've had a week of recovery I i' I've never known what this kind of weakness was all about but here we are and uh given time we'll be back on the battlefield again and so I'm just honored that I can be with you I'd like to thank you for your prayers thank you for God's mercy and his goodness to us brother horn we just don't know where we're going to have to walk in this life do we and so amen and we we we what we're doing now is we're we'll walk a we'll walk a bit and ride a little stationary bicycle a bit and rest

brother Sean I'm so sorry that I can't be at your meeting this year and but if the Lord's willing and gives us another year and Israel don't blow up the whole world let her blow her up let her blow

come before you today Lord in the presence of The Great I Am Lord we recognize you're the god that set up all of these things father to recognize that you are in the building father Lord we come to this moment Lord to celebrate the greatest victory over death Hell In The Grave to show that there is a rising of the S so n again in this hour father and I pray God that you would just begin to bless this day father Lord you've seen all of these events father Lord this wedding that is taking place just after this service father Lord you see brother Chester sister Hanah father you see their desires father how that you would line this out father Lord to be right after the preaching of the word to take on each the brother Chester's name I pray father that you would come today and that you would seal this service father with your presence oh God lord may you vindicate this marriage with an amen oh God now God we turn ourselves over to you father any man can take the pages of the Bible and begin to flip over and read through the book but Lord it takes you to reveal the very heart and the Very secrets of this book I believe that you have things in store for us today so father we commit this service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles today we'd like to look over in the Book of Genesis chapter 24 verse 34 and we again would like to say we welcome all of our visitors here and just want to make you feel as welcome as as possible and certainly excited for for this day and so uh I believe brother Chester and sister Hannah might be setting a new trend here and uh this is uh this is a pretty neat deal never done this before so but they they so desired to just to have the presence of the Lord and just kind of right behind the service here so you know what this might just it just might turn out to be something new here so it may not be for everybody but it's all right I like it so that's okay hopefully you like it so amen do you love the Lord today amen Genesis CH 24 and verse 34 and the Bible said here and he said I am Abraham's servant and the Lord hath blessed my master greatly and he has become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and men's servants and Maid servants and camels and asses and Sarah my master wife bear a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath notice what elzer is doing here he's laying out a foundation to Rebecca's family that all that Abraham has is because of the supernatural notice he said and my master made me swear saying thou shallal not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell but Thou shalt go into my father's house and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son and I said unto my master per Adventure the woman when not follow me notice he said and he said unto me the Lord before whom I walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my Kindred and of my father's house may God bless his word he may be seated today in the presence of the Lord I'd like just to take a few minutes and speak to you on a thought today on a bride for Christ a bride for Christ and to me this this this book of Genesis chapter 24 is one of the most beautiful books most beautiful chapters in all all the Bible it begins to express to us the the greatest one of the greatest love stories and it's amazing to me that you can you can read all of Genesis chapter 24 and you can see the very message of the hour laying right there as God is calling out a body but the reason to me that it is so beautiful is because I don't just see Rebecca in the picture I see myself in the picture and I believe that if we can just take a glance back and as brother as brother Isaac would say last night just take a look again if we can just take a take a look into the holy word of God we can really see and capture the very Mind Of God by Revelation and we know that what we see in the natural is a type of what we are seeing in the spiritual as well brother bandam said if you want to see where the church is at he said look where women are at and you watch the conduct of women and you see them but you're watching what is happening right now amongst the body of Jesus Christ it's a it's it's telling us of what is happening in the very Mind Of God because William Brandon would tell us in the Christ the mystery of God revealed he said God had in the back part of his mind he said he had something that he was going to try to do that he was going to achieve he had some motive that he was going to do he said in God was all of these attributes attributes of father attributes as a son attributes as a Healer he said but in him was love and all of these great attributes that we see today all of those attributes were in God and they were expressed they were in God but now they are expressed but this we know that God does not have new thoughts towards you and I God's not trying to fall in love with you god already loves you he already loves you he's not trying to figure out any many Mighty Mo choose one here or there but God knows exactly the one that he selected before the foundation of the world and we know that that the prophet would come and he would preach a preach a message on a choosing of a bride and in there brother Brandon would lay out some very powerful things that all of our life they it has choices in it the way of life it's a choice it's we have a right to make our own way we we choose our own way that the way that we want to live he said education is a choice right and wrong is a choice your Eternal destination is a choice he said but there's another choice that we have in life and he said that's a life's companion he said a young man or a young woman that's stepping out of life has been given a right to make a choice he said that young man chooses the young man woman the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both man and woman they have a right to make a choice and there we go all the way back back into the Garden of Eden and you can see that when when God created man that man was made there he was made in the very image of God and there there we recognize that there he was all by himself and God saw him he saw that he was walking in him but there was something on the in on the inside of God that he was wanting to express through his man Adam he was wanting to express something because if God did not have it on the inside of him he would have never expressed it through Adam but he was looking for a wife that he could call by his own name so he caused the Deep Sleep to come upon Adam and out of Adam he brought Eve and there Adam would call her the woman of life he would call her and say now she is now bone of my bone she's now life of my life my brother Brandon would say he said now he said but God God Adam did not have a choice in this matter he said he didn't have a choice in this matter because God gave him that woman he gave him that woman he said and you seen IM me imately what her character was when she turned down the word of God and her motives was turned over to reasoning and turned down the headship but I'm so grateful to know that in this hour that there is a second Eve that has chosen a different headship and her headship is not her knowledge but it is the intellectual properties of almighty God that she is completely not led by and persuaded by reasonings and intellectual modern ways but this Lady of Grace is led by the very Spirit of almighty God and we recognize that if he was the word then this church this bride has got to be a bride of the word is that right because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God but you go down in verse 14 and then the word was made flesh so if he was the word in the flesh then this bride's got to be the word in flesh is that right now notice what he says to us in the church age he said Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their Brides today he said the bride today does not simply decide that she's going to take a certain man or for a husband no sir it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride because the Bible said in John 15 and 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1 and9 and Romans 9 and11 says that the purpose of God according to the election might stand he said you can't read it any other way to me it's a very powerful thing you can't read it any other way that the purpose of God according to election might stand now notice what he says he said the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God if you want to know his heart if you want to know God's heart he said notice the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing this bride is not man chose She's Not Elected by some board but she is chosen out of the very mind of almighty God and that choosing that his purpose was in himself being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed therefore we could be reborn so let me say it to you like this in a greater magnitude before re Becca ever got down there to the whale she was already chose before she ever watered the animals she was chose before you fell in sin you was already elected before you had mistakes you was already chosen before you got in drugs you was already chosen you may have not look like the elect at one point of your life but because the genan seed of God was deposited on the inside of you he chose you because of that seed and he draws himself I want to say it to you this morning that this Supernatural presence has put you in position for the wedding that has taken place it's without the presence of the Lord that every meeting is just a protracted meeting but this Supernatural presence of the Angel of the Covenant has put you in position let me put it in other terms this is a pre-arranged marriage let me put it to you a little bit clearer this is a predestinated marriage you didn't set this up it daddy didn't choose you your mama didn't choose you but almighty God chose you before the foundation of the world just like the angel was directed to go down there and directed Phillip to go down there and preach to the unic it was the Angel's job to direct him but it was Philip's job to to direct The Germ seat of almighty God and just like the angel was leading elaser Hallelujah just like he was leading elaser it's that same angel that was directing elzer but it was elaser that begin to drop in the very secrets about Isaac he told him that these are modern Vince made clear by prophecy he she begin to tell him about leadership she begin to tell him he begin to tell her about his future home that he's made for his Earthly bride but the Heavenly bridegroom and she be to tell him about the token that'll be placed over your life what was it elaser knew elaser knew when he had a conversation with Abraham and he put his hand underneath of his thigh elaser had the assurance that the angel was going before him then he could decide to go because he had something that was there to back him up and I believe that every Christian every man of God every preacher if they can come to a spot where they re where they've reached and met a met an acquaintance with the angel of the Lord they got every assurance that the angel has went before them you can stand there in the face of criticism and you can stand there because you've got a job to do and that's to get Christ to wife it doesn't matter if you're a if you're a janitor your job is to get Christ a wife it is your job as a minister to stand there and preach and get God a wife and God is not wanting something of the world he's not want something that that looks like the world that dresses like the world he's wanting a woman that's got the kind of character that matches his character she's bone of his bone she's life of his life she's power of his power her Hallelujah her attention is his attention her ideas are his ideas and when elaser knew that the angel was going before him Abraham the father the father of Isaac begin to load down the camel train with all of the blessings that he was not going to pour out on denominations but he was going to pour them out on the Bride of Jesus Christ let me say this to you there is not something that elaser was packing that was for another woman but what elaser was packing was for this Rebecca it was not for the other Church ages it was not for the other Generations but this woman Hallelujah elaser didn't tell her now honey this is for another day this is for and this is for another hour but he be to pour out that Isaiah 53 is for you he begin to pour out that Isaiah 54 no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper what did he do he did exactly like the Song of Solomon would say that he brought me to his banqueting house and His Banner Over Me Is love you study that out you study that out you begin to see he didn't just bring her to any house he brought her to the house of wine what did elaser do he brought her to a wine of stimulation of Revelation that would take her into a realm that she can't expl expain on her own what is it it's a supernatural message that draws the attaction of the attraction of the Bride to the bridegroom what was it when El eer was watching what was he doing he was watching for character he was looking for character and when he saw her down there at the well when he done made a supernatural call and he seen her down there and she begin to begin to do his very prayer begin to act out the very prayer of elaser what was it brother brandom said it showed that she was willing to go before she ever spoke a word her actions showed that she was ready to go and before you go in a Rapture your actions are going to show that you're going in a Rapture what was it she had character that she was willing to surrender her own power her own energy over to his power to his anointing and that's one thing that God has always counted his character remember mam said the elaser sweated it out until he found character he said character for Isaac the bride which the church is a type of he said you know that he said that was the natural seed Abraham he said but this is the Royal Seed of Abraham he said well if elaser the messenger was hunting out the bride and trying to find character he said if that man has come a messenger of this last day trying to find the bride for Christ he will not look look in a denominational membership he will look for character that's willing Watch God's character first then get her ready to meet Isaac and after he had found the character then he get her to stand still long enough to listen to the message of Isaac that shows what kind of character that you are that you stood still long enough to let the message of the hour wash you wash you of traditions wash you of ideas what is it it's a union that's taking place that's what God's looking for somebody that'll adhere to the word of God somebody that'll listen to it you're not just wanting some man's not just wanting he's not just wanting any type of woman he's wanting a woman of Grace and if you see a man choose that type of woman it shows what's on the inside of that man if he chose if he chose some Jezebel if you chose some worldly worldly thing it shows what's on the inside of a man but if you see a man choose somebody that is fit fit by the message of the hour it shows the very character of that man that is laying on the inside of him you remember when brother randam when he said I was going to take a walk and I was going to go check on them couples I was going to go check on them couples that I'd done married and one was up there on that hill and he said they didn't have to work for their money they didn't have to do anything they' inherited all their money he said so I thought I'd just walk up there he said I went up there to that great big old mansion and he said there I was was he said I stood out there and he said there there was a bickering on the outside he said they was fussing because they had went to a dance the night before and she'd got into the arms of another man and he was upset about it and when brother Brandon went and knocked on the door there they came and ran and they was holding each other's hand said howdy brother brandom oh yeah what was it brother random said it was a paint in fire what is it a paint of fire is a is a deception it's showing you it's for days gone by and he'll never get warmed by it again he said what was it it was a put on now I know good and well you Brothers don't want some put on you want a woman that you get home at night that's a real thing is that right so brother Adam said I took a walk he said and I walk down that hill and he said I'd married another couple and he said I walked down there and he said they didn't have much money he said but they had a box car he said they made a box car their home he said there they was they took those tacky buttons and put it up there he said' and they didn't have much money and they counted out their money here and there brother horn and said this one's for that this one's for that he said but honey I so longed to get you that dress down there that's hanging in the shop she said honey I got a good dress and he said the question came to me William brandom who is the rich one in the picture let me ask you Brothers if you got all the money in the world but your wife can't live to the message what do you have I don't believe that we ought to try to offer ourselves up to Jes Jesus Christ as some halfway woman but we ought to dress oursel fully in the message of the hour when you go to choose a wife you see really what's on the inside of that man we really didn't know what was on the inside of brother Chester until we seen when he chose sister Hannah but it showed the very character of the bridegroom when he chose the bride and when you choose a wife you are wanting a woman that can match your life you want a woman that'll match your goals you want a woman that'll match your intensity you want a woman that'll match your passion you want a woman that'll match your motives you want a woman that'll match your future you want a woman that'll match your goals you don't want to have two heads in a home you want a woman that'll look the part that'll dress the part that'll be the part that'll dress herself in Hallelujah in front of the world that'll dress herself as a body of Jesus Christ and when nobody's looking she'll dress herself like the body of Jesus Christ and when elaser was looking for that type of woman he prayed a certain prayer and when Rebecca come down there brother manham said that the angel of the Lord was up there wooing on Rebecca's heart before she ever came down to the whale she made a marched down there but why did she go to the whale Sister Barbara she went down there because the angel was directing her to go by the whale why do you love this message so much you didn't get here on your own there was an angel that woed you to the Waters of Life hallelujah what was it when she got there she matched the message let me say this to you when you get there when the Rapture takes place there's going to be no trimmings taking place God's not going to have to cut off lust off of you God's not not going to have to cut the world off for you you are being judged right now the word of God is cutting every excess of the things of life off of you because he wants a wife that looks like him a woman that dresses like him a woman that speaks like him a woman that acts like him and it's the angel of the Lord that begin to call to her and brother maram said now notice this he said why didn't them other woman come down there the call was made the prayer was made but why didn't the rest of them women come down there brother Ram said it was because they weren't blood relation that shows right there why you were able to come to this hour come to this message is because you're a blood bought body of Jesus Christ you're led by the very spirit of God and it's a connection coming together it's a union that's coming together today that the born again the Holy Ghost filled people is connected with God are led by the Holy Spirit what is it what draw you to this attraction that is taking place on the mountain it's somebody that has chose you before you chose yourself you didn't make yourself the bride he made you the bride because when he slipped on the wedding band of unmerited Grace upon your finger it showed right there brother random was asked a question will the bride go in the Rapture he said oh that's easy yes it's for you let me tell you the wagon wheels are rolling down the street and it's for you it's not for everybody else it's not for the people that think they're in it it's for you you have spent the last year of your marriage of your engagement preparing yourself dressing yourself and I know there's a lot of people that's ridiculed you because of the way that you've dressed yourself but when it come to the last day when when the when the when the Rancher's son when he told her I'm coming back on this day for you she prepared herself she dressed herself and the dress fit her perfectly Al she'd been working on it and it looked just right it looked just right Hallelujah and he came not for the scoffers on the porch but he came for this Lady of Grace brother bam said it's just like it's just like there when the angels that are seen on Jacob's Ladder ascending and descending he said it's kind of like that drama what is it he said Romeo and Juliet he said what is it he said them Ang are coming down he said the ladder set up against the wall and he said he comes over there and says I'm here for you honey this message attracted you this message called you this message the reason the very idea that the message came by your way ought to signal to you that you are somebody more than just another lady it's a sign to you that you are she let me say this to you when you meet him you will not be disappointed you won't be disappointed because elaser has done such a great job he's give you 1,00 sermons he's laid in Revelations and secrets and Mysteries all about your Isaac and you won't be disappointed when you come down to the Altar and I want you to know when you come to the altar with this Lord Jesus he's not going to be a runaway groom he'll be right there to catch you he'll be right there waiting on you let me tell you get yourself in trouble this groom will be right there he will be your protection he will be your God and he throws a veil off of you and shows that I'm your head now I'm your protector I'll take care of you that's what is taking place in this building today you're going to see it in the natural but that's what taking place in the spiritual it's a change of headship that is taking place you no longer take your thoughts but you say let this mind be in me which was in Christ Jesus it's a transition of your headship to his headship and I want to say that the headship has found a body that he can fully rest himself in notice verse 63 and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening time and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she lighted off of the camel this word light it off it means to accept she fell down from herself and she begin to accept the headship in the field notice what is this telling you it's telling you about your rapture for she said unto the servant what man is that that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant has said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself and the servant told Isaac all things that he had done and Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she became his wife Hallelujah he's not going to meet us here but he's going to meet us in the middle of the air why would you come back to this world if this is the last place they beat you and they scorge you but he's going to meet you in the middle of the air and you have fully accepted the power that has led you right unto your Isaac this Holy Spirit let's bow our heads as the musicians come father today is a special day a moment that you have set up a moment that you have chosen elect father may we see in the natural what is taking place of this message that has called us unto you The Germ seed of God in our lives being awakened by the very Holy Spirit and father I pray that you would begin to bless this service Lord with your presence father as we'll begin to transition just now from the natural of the feeding of the word I pray father that your holy presence would be in this building and let it be like a transition on that Resurrection morning on the seventh hour watch that we will begin to take a transition and there we will sit down at the marriage of the Lamb Lord I pray that you would just begin to seal this service today with a holy kiss in the name of Jesus Christ May His blessings be upon this day amen and amen God richly bless you as we begin to transition just now [Music] [Music] oh
