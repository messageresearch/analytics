[45:56] amen
[45:57] first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13.
[46:07] I want to speak to you tonight on an
[46:09] inspired word
[46:11] to an inspired seed
[46:19] all of your Bible is inspired
[46:24] it is the Breath of God
[46:27] it is God's thoughts in word form
[46:31] he used 40 different writers
[46:34] and through them inspired them
[46:36] and if you can think about Moses writing
[46:39] the the first books of the Bible Moses
[46:42] wasn't there
[46:43] so God allowed him to see what happened
[46:45] in the Garden of Eden he allowed him to
[46:48] go through Abraham's life
[46:50] he allowed him in all of those and just
[46:53] actually took him right through it that
[46:55] was not the thoughts of Moses that was
[46:58] the thoughts of God being pulled through
[47:01] Moses whether it's Ezekiel or Jeremiah
[47:04] or Nahum
[47:06] or brother Branham
[47:08] the message of this day is the inspired
[47:12] word of God
[47:14] as a matter of fact it is the opticals
[47:17] on the inspired word
[47:20] because even even this year this book is
[47:23] still the the number one seller
[47:28] as much as it's hated it's still the
[47:30] number one seller
[47:32] and I am thankful for that but but you
[47:34] know many men write books of theory and
[47:37] books of their own thoughts but this is
[47:40] God's word
[47:43] and you know we've had it in colleges
[47:45] and they've had great institutions that
[47:47] tried to decode the Bible but God sent a
[47:50] prophet in this day
[47:54] he sent a prophet to a bride-believing
[47:58] people that would catch the word
[48:01] and the reason you could catch the word
[48:03] is because God predestinated a seed
[48:09] on the inside of you you can literally
[48:12] said in the same church beside of one
[48:15] person that is not inspired
[48:17] because brother Brown says in non-seed
[48:19] there's just nothing to Quicken
[48:22] you can't make a goat a sheep
[48:26] but for a sheep he just says that's the
[48:29] truth
[48:31] Hattie Wright said that's absolutely the
[48:33] truth brother Branham
[48:35] and and and let me just say this you
[48:37] that's what we do we don't have to
[48:39] explain it we just believe it
[48:43] I don't even have to understand it all I
[48:46] just believe it with those thoughts in
[48:48] mind I want to speak to you on an
[48:51] inspired word to an inspired seat
[48:54] and the reason it's relevant to you
[48:57] is because that predestinated seed on
[49:00] the inside of you
[49:01] and this is your love letter
[49:04] that works for you
[49:06] Paul wrote this 2000 years ago
[49:10] but it's to you
[49:12] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[49:14] brethren
[49:16] concerning them which are asleep
[49:18] that you sorrow not even as others which
[49:21] have no hope
[49:23] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[49:26] rose again
[49:28] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[49:31] will God bring with him and we can say
[49:35] Amen to that we believe that for this we
[49:38] say unto you by the word of the Lord
[49:40] that we which are alive and remain
[49:43] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[49:46] prevent them which are asleep
[49:49] I want to read that scripture aloud with
[49:51] each and every one of you
[49:53] for this we say unto you by the word of
[49:56] the Lord that we which are alive and
[49:59] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[50:03] not prevent them which are asleep
[50:07] Hallelujah for the Lord himself shall
[50:10] descend from heaven with a shout and
[50:13] with the voice of the Archangel with the
[50:15] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[50:17] shall rise first then we which are alive
[50:21] and remain shall be caught up together
[50:23] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[50:26] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[50:29] the Lord wherefore Comfort one another
[50:32] with these words amen you may be seated
[50:35] tonight may God bless his word
[50:40] in Revelations chapter 19 and verse 6.
[50:44] and I heard as if it was a voice of a
[50:47] great multitude as a voice of many
[50:49] Waters as the voice of Mighty thundering
[50:52] saying hallelujah for the Lord God
[50:55] omnipotent reigneth
[50:57] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[50:59] honor to him for the marriage of the
[51:01] Lamb has come
[51:03] and his wife
[51:04] has made herself ready
[51:09] and you say Amen
[51:11] and your amen's right there says so be
[51:13] it I'm identified with that scripture
[51:17] and to her and that's you what's granted
[51:21] that she should be a raid and find linen
[51:23] clean and white for the final end is the
[51:27] righteousness of saints and he saith
[51:30] unto me right blessed are they
[51:32] which are called to the marriage supper
[51:35] of the lamb and he said unto me these
[51:38] are the true sayings of God
[51:41] in Revelation chapter 21 I want to read
[51:44] about your future and I saw a new Heaven
[51:47] and a new Earth
[51:50] amen
[51:52] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[51:54] were passed away
[51:57] and there was no mercy
[52:00] and I John saw the holy city the New
[52:03] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[52:05] heaven
[52:06] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[52:10] husband
[52:11] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[52:14] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[52:17] with men and he will dwell with them and
[52:20] they shall be his people and God himself
[52:24] shall be with him and be their God I
[52:27] want to read that verse again and I
[52:29] would like for you to read that with me
[52:31] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[52:34] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[52:37] with men and he will dwell with them and
[52:41] they shall be his people and God himself
[52:44] shall be with them
[52:45] and be their God
[52:50] this is a tremendous scripture
[52:53] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[52:56] their eyes
[52:57] and there shall be no more death
[53:01] nor neither sorrow
[53:03] nor crying neither shall there be any
[53:06] more pain
[53:07] for the former things are passed away
[53:10] and he that set up on the throne said
[53:13] behold I make all things new
[53:17] brother Fred that's enough to shout
[53:19] about right there
[53:21] behold I make all things new
[53:24] when I look in the mirror I'm glad for
[53:26] that
[53:27] and he saith unto me right for these
[53:30] words are true and faithful
[53:33] and he said unto me it is done I am
[53:36] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[53:40] end and I will give unto him that is a
[53:43] thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life
[53:45] freely
[53:46] now this is our scripture and he that
[53:49] overcometh
[53:52] shall inherit all things
[53:56] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[53:59] son
[54:01] I want you to say he's talking about me
[54:10] I want you to read the scripture with me
[54:12] now
[54:13] he that overcometh
[54:15] shall inherit all things
[54:18] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[54:22] son
[54:23] God predestinated you to live in the
[54:26] darkest wickedest
[54:29] Satan's Eden that there's ever been
[54:33] it was an age to which the witch even
[54:36] the prophet couldn't even see past 1977.
[54:42] let me just give you a for instance how
[54:44] many is born after 77.
[54:47] Hallelujah you babies
[54:54] I preaching to a kid crowd here
[54:56] [Applause]
[54:59] I want you to just think about this
[55:02] brother Branham preached in a time where
[55:04] there was no internet
[55:08] no Facebook
[55:11] none of this nonsense
[55:14] to where that the news was just boom I
[55:18] mean just everybody's got the news that
[55:20] they're and let me just say if you feed
[55:22] on that all the time you're going to be
[55:23] a depressed person
[55:27] because the first thing you get up and
[55:29] you are looking I don't care what Avenue
[55:30] that you listen to
[55:32] you you just look at all the murders and
[55:35] the nonsense that is going on
[55:38] [Music]
[55:41] and you just look at how the world is
[55:43] falling apart but if you can look at
[55:45] another book
[55:50] you'll be inspired
[55:52] okay
[55:53] to another world
[55:56] brother Brandon would stand there and he
[55:59] would stand and stand in Two Worlds at
[56:01] the same time
[56:02] and you being a patient
[56:04] and you've maybe traveled 1500 miles
[56:08] to be in the meeting your wife is sick
[56:11] and you stand for a long time to get a
[56:14] prayer card
[56:15] and then brother Branham at random
[56:20] at random maybe a hundred prayer cards
[56:23] are given out 200 prayer cards maybe
[56:25] even 500 prayer cards are given out and
[56:28] brother Branham will just call out a
[56:30] call out a uh maybe 15. and you get
[56:34] called
[56:37] and you get called and you know there's
[56:39] been huge lines waiting on those prayer
[56:42] cards but now you get called
[56:44] and you walk to the stage and you stand
[56:46] you may stand for quite a while as
[56:49] brother Branham is just taking his time
[56:50] with each individual now listen God told
[56:54] him where to start
[56:57] and it wasn't brother Brown I'm picking
[56:59] out certain individuals and
[57:02] and and and here now their name is being
[57:05] told to them
[57:06] and their condition is being told to
[57:08] them and you know there's something
[57:10] standing between you and I
[57:14] brother Branham didn't have a thing in
[57:16] his ear telling him what was on the
[57:17] prayer card
[57:21] he had none of that modern technology
[57:23] that as that disposal that's a gift
[57:26] today
[57:28] brother Brown had a road generally a row
[57:30] of microphones and he would ask which
[57:33] one is working and I want to speak that
[57:35] everybody in the back can hear
[57:37] sound systems were much different takes
[57:40] were much different it was a new Gadget
[57:44] God knew exactly where to put the
[57:47] prophet
[57:49] where he could operate in a supernatural
[57:52] realm to where every night
[57:55] there wasn't some Facebook challenge
[58:00] I find it interesting that it took
[58:02] almost 50 years after his death for
[58:04] people to start wanting to challenge
[58:06] that
[58:10] are you with me now
[58:12] after his death it's all over listen the
[58:15] messages it's done
[58:18] it's not been delivered it's not up for
[58:20] debate
[58:22] but it was for an inspired people that
[58:26] could hear the word of God
[58:29] and you were one in a million that
[58:31] caught the word
[58:33] and just as a patient standing on the
[58:35] stage you said that's me
[58:40] you said that's me
[58:43] listen the message isn't for everybody
[58:47] though we'll treat everybody as well as
[58:50] we can treat them
[58:51] because one of them might be a believer
[58:55] we don't want to treat anybody rude no
[58:57] matter what faith that they're a part of
[58:59] we want to treat them with respect
[59:01] brother Branham did
[59:03] brother Brown was very respectful to
[59:05] oral Robertson Billy Graham and and many
[59:08] of those people out there and he taught
[59:10] us to be respectful to them
[59:14] are you with me
[59:16] now
[59:17] why I would say that is you know he he
[59:20] would be in California he would talk
[59:22] about people running off to the
[59:24] mountains too to hide and get away from
[59:27] God
[59:29] John steaman was up in those mountains
[59:32] trying to get his wife away from this
[59:34] message
[59:36] and he moved her all over the United
[59:38] States trying to get her away from the
[59:40] message
[59:42] but one day the seed struck
[59:45] one day the seed came to life
[59:49] and he became a phenomenal Pastor his
[59:52] son Danny it's a phenomenal preacher
[59:55] well I wanted the best and he stands
[59:58] there and he preaches the word of God
[1:00:00] his brother-in-law Bill Hershberger
[1:00:02] other members of the family her real
[1:00:05] believers
[1:00:07] what a paradox that God prepares
[1:00:12] he bypasses a million
[1:00:15] many times in cases better looking
[1:00:21] better educated
[1:00:24] better jobs
[1:00:26] God knows where to find you
[1:00:29] he knew exactly where to find you
[1:00:32] but this is our moment
[1:00:35] here we stand in this moment
[1:00:38] we could truly save this day is this
[1:00:41] scripture fulfilled
[1:00:43] now you remember when brother Brady was
[1:00:46] sitting into services and brother
[1:00:48] Brandon preaches this day as a scripture
[1:00:50] fulfilled
[1:00:51] and then what is the attraction on the
[1:00:53] mountain brother Brady found a certain
[1:00:56] seat in in the place and he had a letter
[1:01:00] in his pocket it was a letter from his
[1:01:02] wife
[1:01:03] and that letter told him that she was
[1:01:06] having trouble with her feet
[1:01:09] and and serval are called and then all
[1:01:13] of a sudden he calls brother Brady
[1:01:15] telling where he was from
[1:01:17] what country he was from
[1:01:19] what his name was tell him the condition
[1:01:22] of his wife
[1:01:24] and her feet
[1:01:27] brother Brady would be a testimony
[1:01:30] of this message around the world
[1:01:36] these things don't happen by chance now
[1:01:39] I've got to drive this down I'll
[1:01:41] probably finish in the morning this
[1:01:43] doesn't happen by chance
[1:01:45] God was not taking a chance on finding
[1:01:48] you he knew where you would be at
[1:01:57] we see the bride's Revival happening
[1:02:01] these were things that brother Homer
[1:02:04] as our founding Pastor here
[1:02:07] he longed to see
[1:02:09] he longed to see the moving of God every
[1:02:13] service
[1:02:14] he longed to see a people that loved
[1:02:16] this message with all their heart
[1:02:20] not a bunch of make-believers
[1:02:23] not a bunch of people that just want to
[1:02:25] be there for the emotion but wanted to
[1:02:27] be here for the word
[1:02:29] and the word could ignite their life
[1:02:33] he longed for these kind of services
[1:02:38] the scripture tells us that these all
[1:02:40] died in faith
[1:02:45] they didn't give up
[1:02:47] but these died in faith believing
[1:02:51] now it becomes your turn
[1:02:54] your cycle
[1:02:57] it's happening Among Us
[1:02:59] don't take it for granted this is not
[1:03:02] just other services
[1:03:04] as I'm preaching you this to you tonight
[1:03:08] no doubt I could go to many different
[1:03:10] churches in the nominal World it
[1:03:13] wouldn't mean nothing to them
[1:03:16] but because of who you are
[1:03:20] the vision of God is becoming a living
[1:03:23] reality
[1:03:24] now we get excited as we are approaching
[1:03:27] the resurrection and Rapture and seeing
[1:03:29] God this message live in humanity
[1:03:32] we're seeing we're seeing the book of
[1:03:35] Acts happen among us we're seeing
[1:03:38] tongues and interpretation of tongues
[1:03:40] we're seeing Miracles and we're seeing
[1:03:43] people the greatest Miracle is people
[1:03:46] living
[1:03:47] living the word and you're written
[1:03:50] Epistles it's not something you don't
[1:03:52] have to make yourself do but this is
[1:03:55] like breathing
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:04:00] you don't have to be beat to believe the
[1:04:02] message you don't have to be beat to
[1:04:04] come to church it's a love affair
[1:04:07] [Applause]
[1:04:10] God's wife is on the scene and this
[1:04:13] layout of C and H
[1:04:15] ate Satan's Eden
[1:04:18] brother Branham would get tore up in a
[1:04:20] restaurant
[1:04:22] in a restaurant he would see a woman and
[1:04:24] she had some stuff over her eyes
[1:04:29] another brother had to stop him he said
[1:04:31] she's got a terrible disease
[1:04:35] said she must I've seen horrible
[1:04:37] diseases all over the world but she's
[1:04:39] got a terrible disease
[1:04:41] and the brother caught him and said
[1:04:43] brother Branham that's paint
[1:04:48] that's paint
[1:04:50] now if we could transfer him to 2023
[1:04:55] .
[1:04:57] how he felt in that restaurant
[1:05:01] can you imagine how difficult for that
[1:05:04] Prophet that lived in Two Worlds how
[1:05:07] difficult
[1:05:10] it would be for him to function
[1:05:15] listen that gift just didn't happen in a
[1:05:18] Pulpit
[1:05:20] are you with me now but he would he
[1:05:23] would he would see a woman
[1:05:25] with paint on her eyes and we become so
[1:05:28] grieved in his spirit
[1:05:31] now we see him
[1:05:32] he's he's like us typical men he's went
[1:05:36] shopping with his wife and he said in
[1:05:38] there an escalator
[1:05:40] because he had been transported into
[1:05:42] hell when he was a boy
[1:05:45] and he felt like he was falling and
[1:05:47] falling and falling he would never stop
[1:05:49] falling that's what sin will do to you
[1:05:53] that's what happens when people leave
[1:05:54] the message oh I'm not going to go that
[1:05:56] far you can't stop yourself
[1:06:00] there's no edges of the cliff to where
[1:06:02] you can stop yourself
[1:06:04] because sin will take you further than
[1:06:07] you ever thought you would go
[1:06:10] [Applause]
[1:06:13] setting these pews and and become
[1:06:15] homosexuals later
[1:06:17] lesbians later
[1:06:19] divorce later
[1:06:21] it's because you can't
[1:06:24] you can't live this message in the world
[1:06:29] [Applause]
[1:06:36] sorry I have to say those things
[1:06:40] it's just the truth
[1:06:44] brother Brian would see those women come
[1:06:46] up
[1:06:47] over the escalator and they're speaking
[1:06:50] in another language
[1:06:51] and they've got those hairdos and
[1:06:53] they've got that paint all over
[1:06:54] themselves
[1:06:57] and he would tell us
[1:06:59] that the Lost is Among Us
[1:07:04] can you imagine how difficult it is for
[1:07:06] him to preach Souls
[1:07:08] now in prison
[1:07:11] the Eternal lost
[1:07:13] is Among Us
[1:07:15] let me just say sitting in a service
[1:07:16] like this is Grace
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:07:23] don't never take this for granted
[1:07:26] don't never take it for granted
[1:07:30] our brother Marcus sits here what a
[1:07:32] miracle that that is
[1:07:34] a god rich in Mercy a cycle of over 20
[1:07:37] years
[1:07:39] a spiraling cycle
[1:07:42] it seemed like it would never end
[1:07:44] but God rich in Mercy reached into the
[1:07:47] whirlpool of his life
[1:07:51] because a seed was laying there and
[1:07:54] Jesus said I'll not lose one
[1:08:00] I might lose one
[1:08:02] sister Judy Hensley said him back there
[1:08:06] it was her brother-in-law
[1:08:08] as he's beginning to deteriorate in her
[1:08:10] life they took him in and took care of
[1:08:12] him Leo was a deacon here he was a man a
[1:08:15] pillar of this church
[1:08:17] and through that that God rich in Mercy
[1:08:21] touched brother Ted and sister Judy
[1:08:25] are you with me
[1:08:27] listen do you good if you hear their
[1:08:29] story
[1:08:32] she was running a little shop and Ted
[1:08:33] would come in and flirt with her
[1:08:38] they had histories both of them had
[1:08:40] histories God's not so interested in
[1:08:43] your history
[1:08:44] he's interested in your future
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:59] I was speaking to a minister this week
[1:09:02] and we were talking about people that
[1:09:04] are coming in
[1:09:05] as they're coming in now
[1:09:07] we're in the season of compel them to
[1:09:10] come
[1:09:12] the compelling them to come one by one
[1:09:15] they're coming
[1:09:16] we're in the season of the bride's
[1:09:18] Revival and they're coming in listen
[1:09:21] they're going to be very disqualified in
[1:09:24] a lot of ways
[1:09:27] but so was you
[1:09:30] there was a lot written on your list of
[1:09:32] History
[1:09:34] and God had to wipe and clear the deed
[1:09:39] that's owed against you you were worthy
[1:09:42] of hell
[1:09:44] are you with me and God cleans you up
[1:09:48] and in the cleaning you watched some of
[1:09:51] us had a lot of cleaning to do
[1:09:53] but he knows how to clean your spirit he
[1:09:56] knows how to clean your mind he knows
[1:09:58] how to clean your body up
[1:10:00] he knows how to clean your piercing he
[1:10:03] knows
[1:10:04] he knows how to clean your pants
[1:10:06] [Applause]
[1:10:08] he knows how to
[1:10:09] he knows how to dress you
[1:10:11] [Applause]
[1:10:19] Hallelujah
[1:10:21] any amazing God
[1:10:24] now this Bible
[1:10:26] that we have here tonight
[1:10:29] every bit of it's inspired
[1:10:32] it's all God's word
[1:10:36] and then if you receive the word
[1:10:39] you received God
[1:10:44] it's not up for negotiations
[1:10:48] many times when we come to the difficult
[1:10:51] parts of the scriptures
[1:10:54] it's you know we just ate the book
[1:10:57] and maybe there's parts of the book
[1:11:01] that's written in there that was
[1:11:03] difficult for you a long time
[1:11:07] yeah
[1:11:10] but just keep eating
[1:11:15] maybe maybe it was hair for your sisters
[1:11:19] maybe it was rock and roll for your
[1:11:21] brothers
[1:11:25] you just keep eating
[1:11:28] you see the word cleanses
[1:11:33] it just cleanses
[1:11:50] brother Brian makes a statement I think
[1:11:51] is so profound
[1:11:53] this is either the word of God
[1:11:56] or it's a deceiving book
[1:12:01] it is either right
[1:12:04] or it's wrong
[1:12:10] and if even one portion of it
[1:12:13] is wrong
[1:12:14] it's all wrong
[1:12:18] brother Homer would make a statement
[1:12:19] he'd say
[1:12:20] you know if you have a pie
[1:12:25] and one of those apples is rotten
[1:12:28] just one the whole pie is rotten
[1:12:34] if you're at my house I'm the official
[1:12:37] potato pillar
[1:12:42] I can do something
[1:12:48] and so being the official potato pillar
[1:12:50] I come across rotten spots
[1:12:54] and so I begin to cut those rotten spots
[1:12:57] out or I just throw the potato away
[1:13:01] now if I come to a mercy
[1:13:04] potato
[1:13:08] nothing stinks worse than a
[1:13:11] there's some Jesus smell worse but
[1:13:15] but if I just
[1:13:17] ah put it in there
[1:13:20] that whole pot
[1:13:23] now becomes contaminated
[1:13:28] a few drops of heavy chemical poison can
[1:13:32] destroy a reservoir
[1:13:37] then when we come to denominational
[1:13:39] thinking
[1:13:40] [Applause]
[1:13:42] and we start bringing in denominational
[1:13:44] thoughts
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:48] a new way of thinking what you don't
[1:13:50] realize you've made this a deceptive
[1:13:53] book
[1:13:54] and before long you're tearing Pages out
[1:13:58] well that's not inspired it's not for
[1:14:00] this day
[1:14:03] it's not for this day anymore listen
[1:14:05] this is an eternal prescription
[1:14:08] and if it was baptized in the name of
[1:14:11] the Lord Jesus Christ it's still the
[1:14:13] same way today
[1:14:15] if it's one God it's still one God today
[1:14:24] if it was serpent seed it's still
[1:14:27] serpent seed today and if you've got to
[1:14:30] have the Holy Ghost whether you live in
[1:14:31] America or in Africa or in Zimbabwe
[1:14:36] wherever you're at it's the same Holy
[1:14:39] Ghost today
[1:14:41] [Applause]
[1:14:46] now brother Branham explains to us he
[1:14:49] said now
[1:14:50] it took 10 years
[1:14:53] for Elisha to fit Elijah's rope
[1:14:59] ten years think about that
[1:15:02] he said God didn't trim the robe to fit
[1:15:06] Elisha
[1:15:11] I want you to follow this
[1:15:13] he he didn't trim he didn't trim the
[1:15:16] road to fit Elisha
[1:15:20] he trimmed Elisha
[1:15:24] so that's what goes on with you brother
[1:15:26] on why do we have to go to church for
[1:15:28] decades
[1:15:31] above
[1:15:34] he's still working on me
[1:15:38] to make me what I ought to be
[1:15:40] it took him just a week to make the moon
[1:15:43] and stars
[1:15:45] Sun and the Earth Jupiter and Mars
[1:15:49] how loving next words great patient he
[1:15:52] must be
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:56] he's still working on me
[1:16:01] sometimes you get under pressure and you
[1:16:03] know why you're still here
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:08] all of a sudden something
[1:16:12] your worst enemy is this piece of Flesh
[1:16:16] it don't give you a right to sin but
[1:16:18] you're thankful for Grace
[1:16:22] you know what I hear Brother Branham as
[1:16:25] he enters the pulpit how honest and how
[1:16:28] humble he was father forgive me of my
[1:16:31] sins
[1:16:34] his sins
[1:16:37] he tells us about his house
[1:16:39] he said I was I come in and I could tell
[1:16:41] there was a lot of tension in the house
[1:16:43] I'm gonna paraphrase here
[1:16:45] I could and he said I could tell there
[1:16:47] was a lot of tension in the house and he
[1:16:48] said I just started whistling
[1:16:52] singing a little song and he said she
[1:16:54] was there standing beside of me he said
[1:16:56] I put on an apron
[1:16:58] he said I washed the dishes
[1:17:02] here's a guy that's talking with the
[1:17:03] angel
[1:17:07] here's a guy that sees some of the most
[1:17:09] phenomenal visitations that there is
[1:17:11] here's a man that is walking in Sunset
[1:17:17] has a sword appear in his hands he's on
[1:17:20] top of the mountain and seven angels
[1:17:22] come down and reveal this book
[1:17:26] listen if the seals aren't revealed and
[1:17:28] the Thunder's released we're not going
[1:17:30] in no rapture
[1:17:33] we got to have a prophet if brother
[1:17:34] random did not fulfill Malachi 4 5 and 6
[1:17:38] and reveal the Seven Seals and the
[1:17:41] Thunders
[1:17:46] we are in a mess
[1:17:48] but it happened
[1:17:51] Glory
[1:17:53] [Applause]
[1:18:02] thank God
[1:18:05] but he had to fight difficult things in
[1:18:07] his life
[1:18:10] now let me just take you to a spot
[1:18:12] this is okay
[1:18:16] I'm taking my time because
[1:18:18] you know sometimes on Sunday morning I
[1:18:20] just preach one service and I can go 100
[1:18:22] miles an hour
[1:18:24] a minute for a three-day weekend this
[1:18:26] weekend so
[1:18:28] brother Brian was standing in Finland
[1:18:31] and he later tells the story
[1:18:33] that little dead boy
[1:18:38] somebody was arguing that with me
[1:18:41] one time and they said that didn't
[1:18:43] happen I said was you there
[1:18:50] was you there
[1:18:52] the only way that you can discredit that
[1:18:54] was you there
[1:19:02] you listen when brother Brian was
[1:19:03] explaining
[1:19:04] the that that cloud
[1:19:07] and he's talking about that cloud for
[1:19:09] the first time
[1:19:10] you can go you can go look it up
[1:19:12] when he's talking about that cloud that
[1:19:14] everybody wants to discredit
[1:19:16] I want you to watch him you go go you
[1:19:19] can go and listen to it and he and he
[1:19:20] and he's talking about that cloud how it
[1:19:22] came down it formed and the angel was
[1:19:24] there
[1:19:25] brother Edmund way
[1:19:27] Falls dead
[1:19:31] if I was dead and they come and check
[1:19:32] and he falls dead
[1:19:34] because he talked about it he had a
[1:19:36] complex
[1:19:37] and so he falls down
[1:19:41] now brother random has just explained
[1:19:43] that cloud
[1:19:45] now God is either right or he's wrong
[1:19:50] and so brother Branham steps off at the
[1:19:53] stage and goes to him
[1:19:55] and calls him by name and he resurrects
[1:20:01] are you with me
[1:20:03] God's not going to honor a lie
[1:20:09] that's not going to fill you with the
[1:20:10] Holy Ghost with you drinking and
[1:20:14] got all kind of porn habits in your life
[1:20:16] God don't live with the Devil
[1:20:19] [Applause]
[1:20:22] are you with me and listen it's the
[1:20:25] truth
[1:20:28] and so God amends his word
[1:20:31] brother man would step up behind the
[1:20:33] pulpit and he said if I'm not told you
[1:20:35] the truth may God strike me dead
[1:20:39] and then have a prayer line
[1:20:43] we're not dealing with a half soul
[1:20:47] listen this ought to make you shout here
[1:20:50] listen if all of that is correct then
[1:20:53] what he said about you
[1:20:56] then what he said about you is correct
[1:21:03] is this microphone working if all of
[1:21:06] that is correct
[1:21:08] then what is said about you is correct
[1:21:24] he said you just don't know how it feels
[1:21:27] you know where you're at all the Devils
[1:21:29] out of hell if he'd line up everything
[1:21:31] there was in hell up
[1:21:33] and he'd never stop it
[1:21:36] it's there it's got to happen
[1:21:39] notice what he says I want you to take
[1:21:41] this and think about it I spoke this in
[1:21:44] North Carolina
[1:21:46] and brother Joe Greene's meeting
[1:21:48] standing on the stage
[1:21:51] and I said you could line up every devil
[1:21:54] in hell
[1:21:55] seek every how powerful
[1:21:58] not just one is
[1:22:00] but every Fallen Angel
[1:22:04] that fell out of heaven and was cast
[1:22:06] into the Earth
[1:22:08] that operation the realm of hell
[1:22:11] you could line them all up
[1:22:14] and they couldn't stop it
[1:22:23] now remember a note to this side in the
[1:22:26] vision and I prayed
[1:22:28] he said you have to do just as you've
[1:22:30] seen it and I knelt down and they all
[1:22:33] gathered around and I said
[1:22:35] now watch
[1:22:39] the saith the spirit of God
[1:22:42] This Boy's Life will return to him
[1:22:49] it wasn't an if
[1:22:54] foreign
[1:22:58] call me a false prophet
[1:23:02] brother Chris you just have to say
[1:23:04] brother Branham had to know where he
[1:23:06] stood
[1:23:07] I'm doing something here I brought you
[1:23:09] this far you've got to know where you
[1:23:11] stand
[1:23:14] it's not just for enough for brother
[1:23:15] Brian I'm a brother Ron or brother Homer
[1:23:17] brother Andrew these men of God other
[1:23:19] people all through this audience you've
[1:23:21] got to know where you stand
[1:23:24] there's no wishy-washy you've got to
[1:23:26] know where you're standing because Satan
[1:23:28] would like to keep you here in a
[1:23:30] tribulation period but this word says
[1:23:32] you've got a rapture
[1:23:36] he'd like to destroy your family and you
[1:23:39] stand there on the word of God and say
[1:23:41] you can't have my wife you can't have my
[1:23:43] husband you can't have my children I've
[1:23:46] got a token applied I've got a covenant
[1:23:49] with God
[1:23:52] Hallelujah
[1:23:58] don't let the devil steal your home
[1:24:01] don't let him steal your job don't let
[1:24:04] him steal your health
[1:24:06] all right
[1:24:08] [Music]

[1:24:13] you
[1:24:15] I don't lay at home with the Molly grubs
[1:24:19] I don't I don't go around with a
[1:24:21] negative spirit this message has taught
[1:24:23] me to speak positive
[1:24:27] think positive speak positive
[1:24:30] sure there's a reality to cancer sure
[1:24:33] there's a reality to heaven to take
[1:24:35] chemo every day sure it's like having
[1:24:37] the flu almost every day of your life
[1:24:39] but listen to you God's greater
[1:24:45] oh
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:52] brother man uses his term
[1:24:55] he said we're more than conquerors
[1:24:58] we just walk right into it as an
[1:25:01] inheritance
[1:25:04] more than conquerors
[1:25:07] now we are dealing
[1:25:09] with a defeated enemy
[1:25:14] we're dealing with a defeated enemy
[1:25:17] don't resurrect it
[1:25:20] he's on the canvas don't help him get up
[1:25:24] he was defeated at Calvary
[1:25:27] don't make him no more than what he is
[1:25:31] we're dealing with a defeated enemy
[1:25:33] sickness is defeated death is defeated
[1:25:36] hell is defeated everything is defeated
[1:25:40] brother Tom sprole is watching from Ohio
[1:25:42] tonight his mother is they're just
[1:25:45] they're just saying she could go at any
[1:25:47] time she's got some horrible situations
[1:25:48] in her life let me just say this to you
[1:25:51] if it's her time to go there's nothing
[1:25:55] that the devil can do to steal her soul
[1:26:00] and she will step into a well body
[1:26:04] but if it's her time to live
[1:26:09] there's nothing that the devil can do to
[1:26:11] keep her in that condition
[1:26:14] [Applause]
[1:26:21] I walked into
[1:26:25] your father's room
[1:26:28] he was on a kidney dialysis
[1:26:30] forgive me brain fog sometimes sets
[1:26:35] help me
[1:26:37] sitting beside a Brenda
[1:26:41] I know Garland but I want to call her
[1:26:44] name
[1:26:45] Janetta it wasn't going to come
[1:26:49] I'll say it like Homer would say I knew
[1:26:51] I did it
[1:26:54] my brother was sitting right here and he
[1:26:57] but the woman said I know you I know
[1:26:59] your name
[1:27:00] and he went he kept going kept going
[1:27:01] kept going going to the man finally he
[1:27:03] was in his 90s he finally said his name
[1:27:05] he said that's right I knew I'd get it
[1:27:12] I walked into brother Garland's room and
[1:27:15] they were telling him he was going to
[1:27:16] die at any moment only had hours to live
[1:27:19] and I walked in and I said you're going
[1:27:21] to be a winner either way
[1:27:25] and there's nothing the devil can do to
[1:27:27] get keep you from getting a well body
[1:27:31] but if it's God's purpose and he's going
[1:27:33] to raise you right back up
[1:27:36] do you know Garland lived in that body
[1:27:39] for several years
[1:27:44] not a few moments God raised him right
[1:27:47] back up
[1:27:48] listen there's nothing impossible for
[1:27:51] God to do
[1:27:57] we're dealing
[1:28:02] we're disputing
[1:28:06] with a conquered enemy
[1:28:10] and he's a squatter on our land
[1:28:19] Brother Ray I'm going to pray for your
[1:28:21] sister tomorrow

[1:28:35] and you hear of these crazy people that
[1:28:38] just move into people's house and squat
[1:28:41] it's in the news now
[1:28:44] and they just move into these big homes
[1:28:47] and hotels and squat and refuse to leave
[1:28:54] Ray's got something in his house
[1:28:59] and he's a very good Christian man
[1:29:05] it ain't going to be good
[1:29:07] if I could just say it
[1:29:10] it ain't gonna be pretty
[1:29:14] there's things that's going to happen
[1:29:17] and maybe after it all happens they'll
[1:29:19] call you
[1:29:27] because you have a deed
[1:29:30] and that deed has your name on it and
[1:29:33] I'm sure sister Seuss
[1:29:36] probably yours
[1:29:38] and it has your name on it it don't have
[1:29:40] squatters it don't have a list of 200
[1:29:42] people on that
[1:29:46] and so they're drinking your coffee and
[1:29:48] they're eating your pizza and they're
[1:29:50] they're sitting in your favorite chair
[1:29:52] but you've got a right
[1:29:56] you got a right to get them out of your
[1:29:59] house
[1:30:01] I know we live in a nonsense age but we
[1:30:04] still got rights
[1:30:07] [Applause]
[1:30:12] we've got rights God given rights when
[1:30:17] Satan comes and starts squatting on her
[1:30:20] health
[1:30:22] we can either start believing the
[1:30:24] doctors report or God's report
[1:30:28] God's report is inspired
[1:30:32] whose report will we believe it's more
[1:30:36] than a song it's a word
[1:30:40] by his stripes we are healed
[1:30:45] if he abided me in my word abide in you
[1:30:47] ask what you will
[1:30:58] you remember brother Brandon would talk
[1:31:01] he'd talk about it
[1:31:03] a police officer
[1:31:07] and he said he may be as skinny as he
[1:31:09] can be
[1:31:13] and he's got a badge on it
[1:31:20] I hate to go into a place
[1:31:22] where they got music playing and they're
[1:31:24] talking about murdering police officers
[1:31:27] they ought to throw them people that
[1:31:28] write that stuff up
[1:31:30] put them in jail
[1:31:34] I'm gonna get on my saddle here just for
[1:31:36] a minute
[1:31:36] but these people that don't want police
[1:31:40] and then they turn around and hire
[1:31:42] security
[1:31:54] these crooked politicians will say
[1:31:56] anything to get people's votes
[1:31:58] and they don't want to defund the police
[1:32:00] and defund this
[1:32:02] you you just go ahead and get rid of all
[1:32:04] the police
[1:32:07] you're going to need a gun
[1:32:12] you're going to need angels all the way
[1:32:15] around your house
[1:32:22] brother Ron we're going to put that on
[1:32:23] the internet we're a blow up America I
[1:32:27] could care less
[1:32:30] but most of us don't have a hundred
[1:32:32] thousand dollars to pay for security for
[1:32:34] a month
[1:32:37] these guys need a raise
[1:32:41] they risked their life for me and you
[1:32:58] well you're just advocating
[1:33:00] police officers tonight well let me just
[1:33:02] tell you you're not going to make a
[1:33:04] Rapture without a pastor
[1:33:06] [Applause]
[1:33:18] well brother Ron I'm just going to push
[1:33:20] play well with sermon
[1:33:31] I tell you why people don't want a
[1:33:33] pastor
[1:33:34] because they don't want a real man of
[1:33:36] God that's a suit has a supernatural
[1:33:38] gift in his life that will come to your
[1:33:40] kitchen
[1:33:41] that'll come to your car and start
[1:33:44] telling you the conversations that's
[1:33:46] going on in your life
[1:33:48] but a real man of God
[1:33:51] he's not after your billfold he's after
[1:33:54] getting you in a new body
[1:33:56] that's what I'm interested in I'm
[1:33:59] interested in getting your children in a
[1:34:02] Rapture not just you interested in
[1:34:05] getting your children in a rapture
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:15] [Music]
[1:34:24] well we're all listening to what
[1:34:26] Joseph's telling us to listen to
[1:34:29] come on
[1:34:33] does he have the Holy Ghost for every
[1:34:34] Sovereign Church
[1:34:40] I have great respect for him but he
[1:34:43] stepped outside of his gift
[1:34:47] he may be brother branham's son but he
[1:34:49] stepped away out of his gift
[1:34:52] God called a five-fold Ministry
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:34:58] and I don't care if a guy can't preach
[1:35:00] his way out of a paperback he's going to
[1:35:02] say one sentence that's going to come to
[1:35:04] your heart and your life he may stagger
[1:35:07] through and it may be the ugliest sermon
[1:35:09] in the world but somewhere another if
[1:35:11] you prayed and you pull on the gift of
[1:35:13] God
[1:35:24] I'm not against you listening to tapes a
[1:35:26] matter of fact I advocated that's I
[1:35:28] listened to them all my life I listened
[1:35:30] to one this morning
