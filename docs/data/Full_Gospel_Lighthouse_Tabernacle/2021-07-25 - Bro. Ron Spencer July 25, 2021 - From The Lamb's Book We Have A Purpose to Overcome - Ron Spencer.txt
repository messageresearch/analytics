well we certainly love you with all of our hearts and we are thankful to be a part of your meeting and i've been there for many years we were trying to calculate this morning we've been there about 20 20 different times and so we we have family there and so we love them with all of our hearts and i'd like to greet brother harold and sister leanne and and melody and joel and also also wendy and debbie they're they're children and so we just love them with all of our hearts and uh spent a whole lot of time with them watched the children the younger two grow up and uh had a great time with him and enjoyed playing soccer with with joel in the yard a whole lot of time so he was he was about the size of isaac at that time and as he began to grow he got he got to swim and then he got to have a little motorbike and and we love them with all of our hearts brother harold so i'm so glad to see that you're doing so well i got a family portrait this week and and uh we we certainly appreciated that brother ed and sister sandy we love you with all of our hearts i think it's one of the most incredible compliments that a man can have is when he's been the pastor of a church and there's a legacy that is there like brother harold has been a general through all of these years that a young man actually the same age that i am brother ed has raised up there in the church and been been filling with as a pastor there uh for these numbers of years now and and i'd like to say this to you god doesn't regress he progresses and so he he just he knows exactly how to handle everything and we're a team we're a body of believers we're not a one-man operation we're a body of believers other young ministries have raised up their brother andrew dodd brother moses i may miss a couple but god bless you i i'd like to send a hello to brother jake and sister mary i the first time i ever went to edmonton i i got to stay in in their homes and and uh i certainly enjoyed that now wherever i'm at i make myself at home i figure if you invite me in i'm like jesus i'm gonna make myself at home and so i i would go to the refrigerator i'd go may i go help with the coffee and i and and sister mary actually enjoyed that and um but we had great times there brother dole all the deacons and i'm going to miss generally after sunday night service we get to go to brother jake's house and we have a feast and so i'm going to miss that tonight but maybe sister connie will fix that up here on this end and so the luxury of both congregations you didn't have to get on a plane you didn't have to make a flight you didn't have to have hotel rooms but you've been able to be here i understand that there's people there that have that have flew to the meeting that you're gathering there in edmonton and i'm glad that you're able to gather again i i i so hope that this cova just goes away and and uh you know it was just like here we had to be under covered conditions for a while and and um and we all got our good taste of that and uh sure glad that it's over amen for for us for temporary anyway and so we're glad to have a a reprieve for just a bit and so during the reprieve and during your meeting we're just asking the lord did you just come in a special way amen sister terry i'm actually going to preach you will hear yourself in the theme of this service i just sister terry was a country singer and god sent a man named don babis by her way and she received the message of the hour didn't know nothing about god and here she was in a in a place called white horse which is literally well you can look it up on the map it's a long way from anything but god knows how to find you amen and and and if he can take a sister terry and make a real daughter of god out of her a lady of grace he can do that for anybody and so i'd like to say hello to her and i'd like to say thank you for the saskatoon pie next year amen amen amen and so we love you with all of our hearts i'd like to thank you personally as as i would come and forgive me for making a few announcements but i'd like to thank you personally to those that are edmonton and wherever you are this morning i'd like to thank you for your prayers and your continued prayers for us during this battle of cancer for those that don't know we have struggled since last or thought since last year from christmas time we found out last a year and a half ago i had i had cancer and the cancer spread from the lymph nodes to the lungs fill my lungs up and then cancer went into my brain and i still have one tumor was removed i was about the size of a lemon and and then and then there's two two remaining tumors that are there and uh brother nathaniel you would know 16 mm or whatever or uh and eighteen amendments is the measurements of those i just found that out this week but i went to the doctors this week and they they they looked at me and and um one doctor says he's the sickest man that that comes to his clinic and he's a picture of health he said his god's working for him so amen so uh the other doctor which is the head the head doctor that has taken the case uh uh which is just an incredible doctor she has been with us through the whole time and she just said we're going to stay the course she said nobody's doing as good as you're doing on the medicine she said you're taking the the highest chemo that we can give you and it's working she said we can't we can't bump it up uh we don't want to take it away she said we're giving you the highest chemo that we can give you if it spreads it spreads you know but prayers prayers and medicine is helping it out god god takes care of that and i'm thankful i'm thankful for that and i'm thanking you for your prayers and your continued prayers and and um i i love it when they say nobody's got the same energy that you've got so amen that just tells us that god's working amen we want to remember brother tim this morning sister karen and we're we're praying for the entire family and the body of believers there we are believing that just as much as he has preached so many times oh thou suffering stand and be healed now we know that god's in control of every situation and if it's her time to go there's not a preacher in the world can keep her here there's not a doctor can keep her here but if it's not her time to go there's not a devil in hell can take her life and so and so we stand on the promises of the word of god amen and we know we know we serve a god and as a reminder as a reminder if she takes her last breath her their next breath will be in glory and she'll be having a reunion with many people that she's loved and walked with and and god watched over her life through these decades and she's been a real wife she's been a real mother she's been a real grandmother she's been a real friend to the bride of jesus christ she's conducted herself as a queen and we'd like to say thank you thank you sister karen and we love you our hearts are heavy with with that and uh we're friends sister connie and i will be flying out in the morning because i got permission to fly amen and so we're thankful for that that's a really really big deal did you hear that brother david mayer did you hear it brother tom ray i got permission to fly so amen written permission and so we're thankful for that the danger of that is the brain tumors would bust and so you know god's in control of all of that too and so amen amen if you will remember us we'll be flying in the morning extremely early and then and then we'll be coming home most likely somewhere around thursday and uh that could change but we we will we will i would like for you to pray for us tomorrow amen so good to see each and every one of you here this morning have new friends with us we're glad to have you with us in the house of the lord put yourself up under the table make yourself at home enjoy enjoy eat eat you don't understand something just just lay it aside after a while you'll like chicken too so amen we love you with all of our hearts we have us i have a special friend here this morning brother aidan horst and sister mary we're so glad to have them with us from ohio and uh brother aidan brother aidan had a special miracle happen many years ago somewhere around 20 years ago and and so i i'd like to share that with you and let's share it with the world if we could do this just for a moment brother aidan was we were in in a meeting in ohio and and we i was just praying for different ones as as we were just coming down the aisle and brother aidan stepped out into the aisle and and we both were younger men then stepped out into the owl and he had a he had a back condition that he was there to be prayed for and so he came to me and he said brother ron he said i've got a really bad back condition that i have and he said he just explained it he said my businesses went away he said and i just can't put it quite like he said it but i need a financial blessing so we begin to pray and i have to say i've never ever had another experience like this but brother aidan as we prayed i began to pray for his back in the middle of the prayer i just asked him i said what's your hobby i just i just stopped and praying and asked him i said what's your hobby and sister mary even asked him why'd you say that and i said greenhouse he said greenhouses i got a green a little greenhouse i don't know what size it was then but it was obviously a lot smaller than it is today very much smaller you know god healed his back completely thank you brother aiden do you mind coming here just a moment we want to we want to we're going to talk about what god's done you have a microphone i'm going to ask him a couple questions and amen give brother hayden a great big [Applause] brother aiden's a shy man so i i'm putting him on the spot here the whole world's getting to watch you just now bro you know if god is your partner you better have big plans and god is sovereign how he does this he knows who he can trust he knows who who will be blessed and he knows what they'll do with it amen and brother aidan is one of the most humble men that i've ever met and one of the most godly men i've ever met how many children do you have brother we got five children grandchildren 19 grandchildren 19 and working amen how many acres is your greenhouse now the greenhouse is five acres it started off with a ten by twenty if that was your question earlier ten foot by twenty and it is now five acres the governor came to your your place too it wasn't necessary it was uh sunny purdue the agriculture guru i'm not sure what you would call him little farm boys like us don't know those terms but he did there was another just below cabinet member that came as well and we were too ignorant and dumb to know all these high-floating people so i guess you'll just have to kind of forgive our wording here but they uh they called a couple days before they came and said now we want to come in there and check you out the day before sunny actually comes and i say well maybe this is a little bit more than what i expected so they came in there three or four guys and checked everything out make sure we weren't gonna do anything funny so the next day they came in with their crew and there was i'm kind of guessing a little bit but between three and four dozen people with the media and the protectors and everybody else that was there so it was pretty amazing to us so he was sharing with me with this last night he says you know we get everything ready under this five acres of greenhouse and he said then he said the day before we open nobody's there and they have nine cash registers and i can catch them they have nine cash registers thank you the fields are full of cars it's amazing we're talking about hundreds and hundreds and even they have food trucks actually come out to be able to feed the people that comes and and god just continues to let it grow and be blessed by it amen that's right and it's all god it's all god absolutely and those hands and those that pray for us i think it's absolutely interesting that that we're on the subject of an unlimited god i didn't know brother aidan and sister mary were coming he has something on his heart that he is praying about and so amen we're we're just thankful that we can be a part of his life and and uh thank you for being here amen we love you with all of our hearts and amen i believe those miracles need to be shared or we're living in real supernatural times and you know if god can do that he can perform a resurrection and we're reminded that 14 years ago this man that's preaching to you this morning was brain dead and and they were going to harvest my organs in hours and i woke up because i needed to preach to you this morning amen amen and that didn't happen in a backwoods hospital that happened at uva and so dr buck walter said these miracles are the most documented miracles they can be and so we're just thankful for what he's doing and we're reminded that cancer is not big enough to to whip my god and so amen amen god bless you this morning and god bless you in edmonton we will do our best and uh we just have some things on our heart that god has spoken to us about thankful for last night's service that to me i've heard i've heard i'm not degrading anybody but i've heard a lot of people attempt to speak on a phoenix but last night i believe was one of the greatest greatest masterpieces i've heard on that if you haven't heard it go back and listen to it rising from the ashes and if we all look at our lives we're a part of that and amen if you just look how the burnover of our lives is god comes down and takes the old man makes a new man out of him and amen we all are can testify of his mercy and his grace and his love and he's still in the saving business and he's still in the healing business and he's still in the given the holy ghost business and so amen let's stand to our feet this morning and amen thank you for your patience with us and and uh you know i realize i realize in a convention services sometimes we get a little bit longer and you just be patient with us and enjoy this you didn't have to fly 16 hours to do it so you're here god bless you for being here and you pull on the word and god will help us all here this morning i'd like for us to turn this morning to genesis chapter 13 and verse 14. and i'd like to look on an unlimited god and and i'd like to give it a title to as well from the lamb's book we have a purpose to overcome amen our purpose is to overcome genesis chapter 13 and verse 14 these scriptures are for background and the lord said unto abraham after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward southward eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to give will i give it thee to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered remember god's speaking to a man that doesn't have any children and it's impossible for them to have children and god's giving him a promise chapter 15 in verse 1. and after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abram said lord god what will thou give me seeing that i go childless and the steward of my house is eliza of damascus and abraham said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the lord came now listen not the word of his friend the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine error but he shall come forth out of thine own bowel shall be thine air and he brought forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be so counting sand and counting stalls we realize the stars is the first bible in heaven and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldeans to give thee this land to inherit amen genesis chapter 22 and verse 14 and abraham called the name of the place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time notice these words now and said by myself have i sworn you've got to swear to the greater and remember there is no greater than god so he swore to himself saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hath not withheld by his own only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy and in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed because thou has so be obeyed my voice may you you can be seated may the lord add the blessing to the word amen brother andrew sent me this this this morning and i want to just share it with you if you can god knew who abraham was but god challenged his faith so that abraham could know who abraham was did you catch that god knew who abraham was but god challenged his faith so that abraham could know who abraham was now you realize i'm not just going to preach on abraham this morning we're going to we're going to get to your house now i want to just share something with you as i just read dust to stars and count the sand i was i was at brother kelly hildebrandt's and i saw this coin and i really very much liked this coin because it was a it meant something to me and uh it has a it has a pebble of sand in it and it's a special coin it's a d-day coin and it's commemoration of the world war ii d-day and it was operation overlord and i liked it of course it was a it was a limited edition and no way i could get my hands on it but i'd invited brother kelly to come here last last uh november before before the cancer struck and brother kelly would generally come in the day before of the meeting brother kelly flew to from saskatoon to calgary and the plane was delayed and then it was he canceled and he couldn't come then the next day he flew to toronto uh then he was was told there that the planes were canceled and he wouldn't be able to be here so saturday night comes and i speak and i take brother kelly's place and and i speak a sermon god had spoke to me don't worry that has been a resounding sermon that's been in my heart don't worry this was before anything the any diagnosis that was going to take place and and so anyway brother kelly was not going to get here on sunday morning to be able to speak so right in midway of saturday night service i just said well instead of having sunday morning we'll have sunday night and so and so brother kelly arrived and remember i remember the words i said satan is trying to block the visitation of the message that he is to deliver sometimes we come to church and we think well that's just a man speaking but if it's a man is has a holy ghost ministry in his life it's more than a man speaking he's speaking as an oracle of god and the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and so it literally it becomes personal to every person in the building brother kelly would come on sunday afternoon and and brother kelly would as he stepped to the pulpit i didn't know anything as he stepped to the pulpit he he says i've got a special present for brother ron and it's this coin and that night he preached a sermon from this coin and this coin is saying operation overlord it's a d-day with a piece of sand in it it's going to mean more to you in just a moment and it's a it's an eisenhower statement that says we will accept nothing less than full victory so i take this very personal cancer stole a lot of things away from me but i'm going to take back everything that it stole away from me not me but god is going to take back everything that it stole away and we will accept nothing less than full victory this piece of ground with sand that was a man from this church that ran the beach at normandy he ran that beach and he said when i when i left the boat he said friends begin the comrades begin to die around me and he said the water turned red and he said i couldn't understand why i lived he said as i got on the sand he said he shut hundreds of lives were perishing in seconds from those big guns and he said all i knew to do was keep running and he said i made it through the water i made it through the sand i made it to the wall and he said i asked myself how did i get him and it would be many decades later that he would be sitting in this church and he would be sitting about where you are brother roger and he would be sitting there and he heard a sermon on predestination how god watches over you and watches over your life and he protects you and your life is orchestrated and driven by god and he said i realized when i ran that i ran that run that day and i always questioned in my life why did i live and all those others didn't live he said i realized that i had protection with god [Music] so that one piece of sand means incredible amount to us there's another little article i've got many more i'd like to share a couple of more next maybe next week but a brother jackson in in texas he sent me a a badge that i could wear and it's a honey badgers badge because my boys call me a honey badger and it says fear no evil now you know the statement about a honey badger they're cute but they're dangerous i'm not calling myself cute this morning amen hallelujah amen but i'm a grain of sand what abraham was looking across i'm one of those grains [Music] one of those stars that abraham was looking at i'm one of those stars and like abraham had to go through all of those trials to recognize who abraham was you're going to have some trials of life remember this eternal life you always was you have eternal life and there's only one form of it and that's god you were his attribute and he thought of you and knowed you before the foundation of the world you were in the lamb's book maybe you couldn't see yourself there but you was there was looking at the picture of brother harold and sister leanne and their children this week and i remember the vision of of sister leanne being brother harold's wife and and i i remember that and so you know i could only see that far and so that's all he allowed me to see but you see glock saw further than harold and leanne he saw melody and joel and he sees past your children and your grandchildren he's been doing this since before the foundation of the world hallelujah are you with me now remember the statement i came from god and i'm going back to god amen the scripture says in romans 4 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise be sure to all the city not to only that which is of the law but that which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made the father many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be as though they were and he said who against hope you ever come to a dead end who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seek be and be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of sarah's womb notice these next words he staggered not at the promise of god [Music] through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform i want you to notice there's not a promise in the scriptures that god can't fulfill amen your amens ought to have been better than that there's not a promise in the scripture that god's not able to fulfill now sure you're going to have some night seasons in your life the book of life is going to talk about many things that you'll go through let me just give you a few examples sarah that we're talking about even now endured 90 years of the frustrating humiliation of barrenness but god had a promise for her job that the book of job it tells us of all the tragedy the horror because god and satan had a meeting and god was the one that raised it up have you considered my servant job because satan said i've been running to and fro in the earth seeking whom i may devour remember satan's job is to kill to steal and destroy so listen don't get on his team you may have pleasure in this life and sin in this life sin is pleasurable for a season it is pleasurable the scripture says it's pleasurable for a season you can make it your god and for your flesh you'll find it pleasurable but the end is death separation from god job is there he's rich he has many children his family is blessed people of the earth come to see him and counsel with him and one by one trials begin to come and he winds up on the ash heap scratching his balls god came to him god came to him and he got a revelation that he would see god and god didn't come down and talk to him and have a pity party with him and ask him about his trials and ask him about his turmoils and ask him about the situation of the life god talked to him about eternal things and he says where was you job when i laid the foundations of the earth so in the midst of the darkness of your trial in the midst of the darkness of your trial are you with me now satan may take your life that you'll step into eternal life [Applause] a lot of times we have grief here but i want you to understand for a christian death is a friend it's only a doorway we step through it's our it's our little uber driver that gets us over to that realm hallelujah where we're promised a resurrection we'll never sorrow we'll never make we'll never have a situation that we have to have crisis in ever again cancer will never have a hold of that body where was you and i laid the foundations of the earth isaac endured darkness of blindness and it would be the will of god because he would have two sons and god would say now jacob will love him but esau i hate him that ought to give us confidence and grace by you're saying here today that god loves you that's not saying that god don't love those people out there in the world god loves the whole world but you make decisions that send you where you are i want you to understand today god don't send you to hell he makes a way of provision for you he don't sin you may blame your neighbor you may blame other people for your problems you may blame a lot of people but look at the mill your worst enemy is you don't blame nobody else don't let him come out of your lips to blame somebody else it's you it's you point it to your chest it's me your choices will take you somewhere in life [Music] i choose heaven i want you to understand i choose jesus [Applause] hallelujah shadrach meshach and abednego they roll off of our lips and we know them as the three hebrew children that had to take a stand amongst all their country brethren their government you may have to stand against your government one of these days too but we refuse to bend or bow and god met them in the fire and understand this today there's always room in your trial for the fourth man you may feel pinched and you may feel shut in there's always room for jesus in your trial he's in the boat bartimaeus experienced blindness and he spent a lifetime of blindness but i want you to understand one day jesus came by and he began to scream at his opportunity thou son of david have mercy upon me don't overlook your opportunities in life [Music] i said this the other day i feel impressed to say it again today many times the scripture says blessed is a man that endureth in his trials i want you to understand god in your trials of life makes a way of escape to keep you from falling but you need to take the way of escape be like joseph and take your coat off it may take you to prison but i'll not defile myself come on god i'll make a way of escape for you legion was found in the tombs he was founded the tombs and demons had destroyed his family destroyed him let me just say this you demons will destroy you in your life they may seem innocent at first that when they come in but lust will take you somewhere down the road envy will take you somewhere down the road it don't come in and say i'm going to destroy your life but a little lust a little pornographic spirit will break up your marriage [Applause] i'm preaching to you this morning you may hide it in your chambers but god knows all about it [Applause] but i want you to understand you can overcome that thing through the blood of jesus christ jealousy is a green night devil that will destroy you and eat the christ out of your lives somebody has more than you do just say thank god that they've got more than than what i've got but may they have the responsibility to know how to handle it are you with me now don't be jealous just work harder be content in whatever you had lazarus wound up in a tomb being jesus's very friend sometimes you think jesus has forgot you but he'll never forget you the human bra lab grab bag of life will take you in a lot of different directions just because you wind up in a nursing home facility doesn't mean god forgot you it's just a part of adam's curse but you can have the angels of god visit you every day of your life and stand guard over top of you are you with me [Applause] lazarus found himself in a tomb and listen even when jesus came back and he begins to tell his sisters where have you laid him they begin to explain to him by now he stinketh and he asked them to roll away the stone there's going to be times in your life that you're going to be asked to roll away the stones sure jesus could have spoken to destroy that stone in a moment's notice but sometimes he asked you to overcome when you come to that thing in your life and you're looking at your phone and it takes you to the wrong site you've got to have the grit in the backbone [Applause] come on help me preach now you're going to have the grit in the backbone i'm not just talking about pornography now i'm talking about those gossip sites [Applause] i'm talking about those gossip innocent like sights that hurt and break and destroy people's lives [Music] but you gotta rise above that thing cast it out of your life and say i refuse to be a slave to this enemy [Applause] [Music] maybe you have a habit in your life and and your thing has controlled your life and maybe it was alcoholism and it's a tough thing or smoking or actually drugs it's a tough thing to overcome because addiction actually gets in your body it can be sleep aids that can get in your right body can actually become just literally just actually grip you in such a way pain medicine can do the same thing but there's sometimes you've got to come to a spot to where you've got to tell that enemy you're not going to control my love and listen you've got to fall out of love with that demon and how it makes you feel because it's destroying your life [Applause] it's destroying your life it's like bad friends [Applause] it's like the wrong kind of associates they'll take you somewhere either you will influence them or they will influence you amen preaching to a whole lot of people here let me just say your friends will take you somewhere they're dirty spirits that get off on you let me just say if you can't get it any plane or that you sleep with dogs you get their fleas [Applause] [Music] then you ask yourself why isn't my marriage working you got the wrong kind of friends sometimes you've got to look at your friends say hey we can't go the same way i serve god i'm not the old man that i used to be listen god's got unlimited power hill [Music] and we're talking about overcoming we can talk about abraham overcoming job overcoming isaiah overcoming all of these biblical persons overcoming they didn't have halos they didn't have wings they were men and women just like me and you they had to make choices god asked them to have only one god he asked him to put him first listen if you can't put god first in your life you will wind up in disaster no matter what you do [Music] you can't put him first i'll serve god when i get time i find it amazing that elvis presley's last words he's he's talking about i can't get to god three different preachers was praying for him i can't get to god because i sold out i sold my birthright [Music] i sold my birthright listen in hell cadillac's won't mean much [Applause] popularity won't mean much brother ron you're not the judge oh no no i'm not the judge and i'm glad i'm not the judge right now but your life is the judge and once you're in that dimension you can't fix this dimension come on you're only more than once help me preach now i'm on a line i'm chasing t-shirts hats remember different characters marilyn monroe dale earnhardt for racing fans have almost committed a an atrocity right there i heard so many people talk about a man that was going to heaven but he was flying a bird the last second that he left your life will be your worst enemy once you're standing in that dimension your life that you live here don't blame your mama don't blame your daddy help me preach i'm going to preach next week on a man up it's time for the bride of jesus christ to man up it's time to fight the devil on his ground and take the i'm tired of him coming on my ground i want to go on his ground and take the offensive i'm licensed i'm licensed i might as well carry this everywhere i go i'm licensed to fight the devil for those that don't know it was badger skins that was around the inside of the holies of holies that was the town what the tent was made of was badger skin so god hid himself behind badger skins in the old testament are you with me now so he's hiding himself behind by your skins here today that's why isaiah said we did esteem him smitten and afflicted of god yet he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed the perfect image of the ma god man god amorpha had changed from the supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death god's perfect masterpiece you wasn't god you're displayed through your father and your mother in the lineage all the way down and you came god knew what day you may be born he knew what hour that you would be born he knew what minute you'd be born he knew your hair color he knew your eye color he knew your disposition he knew all the ins and out about you remember in your natural you was made like that but god deposited a seed so he knows what's laying on the inside of you he deposit a seed of eternal life and one day it becomes quicken in your life and you become transformed more than vows more than turning over a new leaf but you become a new creature in jesus christ god don't rapture you in a moment right after you become born again and recognize who you are now you begin overcoming now you become overcoming brother ron it feels like sometimes ending a war welcome to reality remember time intercepts with prophecy the word becomes reality spoken words that were thoughts now come to pass and it comes to pass in your life because god's not going to rapture books tapes pictures on the wall statues gonna rapture human vessels when he was on earth he said he said he cut through every superstition every doubt and made a prayer line from earth to glory in his ascension for those people that don't believe in prayer lines for those preachers that don't believe in prayer lines you're the devil first of all you need to get that unbelief off your life but he cut through every superstition and every doubt and made a prayer line from earth to glory in his ascension and he went up and sat down at the right hand of the majesty overcomer the mighty conqueror absolutely death couldn't hold him hell couldn't hold him earth couldn't hold him i feel like about ten thousand votes is up here right now and when he was here on earth he was given he was given the lowest in the city to the lowest people and he give to the lord and that was what name had done to him he went to jericho the lowest city the smallest man had to climb up in a tree to come down to to look down at him that's where man put him he was a foot wash flunky the worst job that he could be given he became the lost he became the lowest name that could ever be given beelzebub the prince of devils man gave him the lowest name the lowest place and sent him to the lowest regions of the lowest hill god raised him up and sent him to the highest heavens and a name of bro a name above every name he would have to look down to see heaven thy throne is exalted above the heavens of the heaven and the greatest name that was ever named in heaven and earth [Music] he said that's what god did to him man put him at the lowest and god made him the highest from the lowest to the highest last night you heard about your gutter life that's right your gutter life god knew where you was at and an unlimited god that has purpose in your life raises you up are you with me he don't just raise you up to see if he can he raises you up because he's got a purpose in your life [Applause]

have a lot of agriculture raising fruit you know when that little apple tree is just about one half of one inch that every bushel of apples that'll ever come off of that tree is in it right then in that little bitty microscopic scene every apple is in it right then you're talking about an unlimited god god didn't make the earth just hand them an apple it was evolution hand them an apple every the thousands of bushels is inside of that seed you can't number the trees that's on the inside of that brother ron that's way off abraham was standing childless and god said count the sand of the sea count the stars of the heaven every blossom is in it every branch is in them right then tell me where it comes from where's it at where does it come from what do you do you take the little seed you plant it that little tree comes up and it's planted and you have to keep watering it it has to drink more of the portion it has to drink and drink and drink so much until it pushes out and it pushes out limbs it pushes out leaves it pushes out apples it's all in it [Music] god gives you everything that you need for life's journey in the baptism of the holy ghost but you got to do some drinking to push it out [Applause] every word of god is a seed and if that seed can be planted it's the the inexhaustible fountain of life which is christ the believer has to drink beyond his imagination drink and push out push out everything that you have need of because it's in you listen quit begging from god just keep drinking [Applause] just queen just keep drinking we're planted together in christ and

and i want you to listen real good you don't have to amen you don't have to jump and shout but pay zero attention to people that are always caught up on petty stupid things don't let their jealousy and their nonsense even stay in your ears [Applause] because most likely they're not headed where you're headed anyway so don't give it any energy [Applause] soak it in like i'm doing this coke ron i don't believe in preachers drinking coke i don't believe in sugar diabetes either but god bless you brother ahead sometimes i forget where i'm at now listen i only have just three or four trucks and

about stars so you know that fell right in there could you imagine a little fish about that big way out you under the atlantic ocean saying i better drink just a little bit of this water i might run out could you imagine a little mouse about about that big down there in the garners of egypt saying i just better eat two grains a day because i might run out before summertime that's nonsense that's not i want you to think about this we're dealing with an unlimited god [Music] and brother branham uses this example of a fish in the ocean and a mouse in the gardens of egypt and you're a son and daughter of god that has more authority than archangel in heaven there's unlimited promises at your resource this is your this is your book this is your holy land this is everything this is your title deed not just one scripture not just one promise you're living a defeated life won't you just start writing down promise scriptures i want you to start writing them down i want you to start quoting it to yourself do you know why we sing we come in and we sing it's singing a testimony there is going to be a meeting in the aisle and we sing the testimony and it reminds our soul and our ears that i'm a part of that [Applause] brother ron i don't i don't like singing don't go to heaven i don't like loud music don't go to heaven this is the quietest world you'll ever be in but if you go to hell you're in trouble there because there's going to be screaming and gnashing a and everybody's going to be an enemy but you don't have to go to hell god's made a way of provision and he said i am the way i am the truth i am thank you brother ryan i don't like people amen and i don't like people shouting i don't like all that don't go to hell don't go to heaven but let me remind you of one scripture that says let everything that hath breath praise ye the lord and i want you to remind you the only excuse you have for not praising god is if you're clinically dead and i as your people as your pastor when i look out and you got your head between your knees and you're always sulking i just consider you dead one day i'll bury you in a casket but until then raise up and live you got an opportunity to praise god now's your time the scripture says to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me and my throne to him that overcometh put your name in the scripture even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne i want to remind you of a few things we are pre-planned we are built to overcome so quit acting like you're defeated and rise up and take your place in the scriptures if a book of acts is going to be written behind it let them write a scripture about you overcoming in your life you're called you're elected to this place you've been anointed to meet the challenge of the hour you've been given all the equipment that you need in the word of god god has not equipped you just to fight with a rock or even a sling but you've given everything in the word to to fight at your disposal the scripture says that we're going to be the overcomers of this age that's regardless of the situation he sung about champions we're the champions of this age we

listening today compliment you dr cropley i want you to understand he said this man's driven he walks two miles a day he's given my testimony this man is known around the world his words i'm not embellishing i don't lie it may be in the notes somewhere another but he get listen to the world i have you give a test to them give a testimony about you what do your friends say about you [Applause] let's just give them a microphone what will they say about you i'm not talking about your critic i'm talking about your friend what will they say about you this young man's been with us basically lived in our home since the diagnosis and had some incredibly low times you know some of you some of you no doubt have different wars and i wouldn't want to walk yours and you wouldn't want to walk mine but brother gabriel has been with theirs through the whole time and he he seen he's seen the journey first six months was incredibly difficult as a matter of fact it was hard for me to get out of a recliner because my energy was so low it was in one of the lowest days i would i would calculate one of the lowest days sitting in that recliner with the devil whispering in my ear you know isn't he stupid isn't he stupid he should have known this was coming but it didn't look to him like this was coming because he can't see that there's a sermon there because satan can't see your future so he has to fight with you where you're at and god just so put it on brother aidan's heart to call me facetime me and i answered and he said brother ron you've always wanted to come to the greenhouse to see the miracle but today i'm going to give you a tour of the miracle he's got he's got family none of his family is ever there at the same time on this day it's unchoreographed he starts walking and every one of his family members are there so as he's walking and he comes to a section maybe it's the roses or maybe it's a different flower maybe it's this one there would be somebody there that was working and they would stop and and talk to me and say brother ron we love you we love you with all of our hearts we love you we thank you come on church come on church you guys are amazing upstairs can edmonton see that all right so listen he toured me he didn't know i was having my lowest debt but god put it on his heart come on to tour me through five acres of greenhouse and people told me they love me they love me they love me they're praying for me and i got to see all of his family amen amen let me just say when the devil tells you you're all alone let me just say there's a great cloud of witnesses that are with you [Applause] hallelujah give the lord a great big hand right there we could talk about congressman upshaw for decades that said in a wheelchair was debilitated we could talk about georgia carter there was a little girl that was nine years in a bed and read a promise book and and that she prayed that god would send a deliverer and god came on the scene for her we could talk about a blind man in bombay or a blind man in mexico or a woman with a dead baby we could talk about hattie wright and her two sons coming to the lord we could talk about sister mita and the tumor that was on her on her on her ovaries we could talk about the memphis woman that was praying where's my elijah at we could talk about the storm being spoken out of existence we could talk about the three squirrels that came into existence we could talk about king george being prayed for that was debilitated king george yes elizabeth's father king george that was prayed for brother brandon prayed for him the next day a crippled man ghost plays golf [Applause] this was not done in a in a in a backwoods somewhere another but around the world seven times hundreds of thousands of cases stood on the platform and they heard their name called their address called and let me just say this it was more than a prayer it was a deliverance they came into this service go thy way as your faith is so be it done unto you their faith was read god knew their name god knew their condition and walked across that platform brother brown being the brother the prophet of the hour and the gift was on display those people knew they had met more than a man they met god i'd say tonight i felt him here last night i feel him here this morning it's more than a church service more than a man but god's on the scene we heard sermons like the seven seals the church ages who is this melchizedek we heard god as reeled in his own word we heard god as his own interpreter mighty god unveiled the token the masterpiece we heard all of these messages it didn't come from the mind of a man it came from god god was equipping you he was equipping you to overcome that's right listen the potential is in you god don't have to deposit more it's already in you i won't be much longer you don't need to have to be pumped up every service you shouldn't need to be primed the seed has already got life on the inside of it every resource is at your disposal god will give you the strength and the energy like he's given me over the last year and a half i've not walked by his own energy i made a decision one day many of you know that i was walking before that i've walked for for a few years walked every day on a treadmill walked up walked up and down my driveway walked wherever i went i i let me just say this to you i i knew i needed to be healthy i knew i needed my family has had heart conditions in their lives and i was fighting my natural dna not realizing that there was little cells of cancer that was in there and so for about about six months i wasn't able i didn't have the strength i'll be honest with you i didn't have the strength i'd come and sit in this in this church and many times during copenhagen i'd come and sit right there and i'd sit there and literally pray that i could keep my head up in service i preached and hung onto this pulpit and i hung on this pulpit not knowing how long i could preach or how long but does it sound like today that i'm a stage fourth cancer if i can do anything and give you a piece of motivational speech here just right now you might be struggling you say well brother ron i can't walk two miles three miles i can't walk that much a day walk a tent [Music] put one foot in front of the other and walk a tenth and tomorrow walk two tenths and the next wild might walk a quarter of a mile and the next one [Applause] and next next walk walk a half a mile and the next day walk come on church i don't care if you have to quit turn around sit down for two hours walk [Applause] this time listen hang with me just a few more minutes walk be determined i'm going to do more tomorrow than i did today just keep walking [Applause] brother ron i can't do that swing your arms you in a wheelchair swing your arms if all you can do is move your finger i got a quote now all you can do is move your finger move that finger and have faith tomorrow you'll have two fingers moving and before long you'll have a hand [Applause] moving hallelujah [Applause] [Music] hallelujah come on church don't accept mediocrity i didn't say it right but it don't matter no way don't accept it you don't have to live a defeated life don't give me your senses why you can't serve god i'll give you every reason in the world why you can't i'm not interested in an easier way i'm just not interested forgive me i'm going to take you back in my young life i wasn't interested in coming into church and sit down folding my arms watching the clock if that's your interest here go home go home we're not interested in people who won't be halfway christians we want real christians [Applause] if you're god somewhere else go serving go serving but i got news for you a ball will not give you eternal life rock and roll music will not give you eternal life dressing like a jezebel it won't give you eternal life [Applause] [Music] jesus will amen we're not interested in an easier way it'll be offered but we're not interested i was offered politics many years ago but i wasn't interested that's right kristen i don't want to be a professional liar if they give you enough money you'll lie you'll twist the truth to fix it are you in man you can put an abraham lincoln and a george washington into every county and it won't turn this nation around only jesus is the answer the scripture says be you therefore ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh let me just advise you i would be a high intensity when i walked into service many years ago i took notes before i was ever a preacher because i felt like god was going to speak to me whoever if they could not preach their way out of a paper bag somewhere in that service if i pulled hard enough god was going to speak to my life but i had to be attentive if you walk out of this building today and say i didn't get nothing's cause you didn't put nothing in you see if you don't plant some corn seed you will not have a harvest in the fall don't expect tomatoes if you don't plant them [Applause] amen don't become allow church to become common now let me just give you some pointers here and then then i'm going to give you just a couple more things don't allow church to become common don't come here and look over and see what so-and-so's got on to where you'd shoot me and i wouldn't couldn't tell you somebody told me the other day you preached in the same suit well that's all right i like it i like it and it fits it's not falling off it fits don't have a whole lot of holes in it i really like it i got anointed in it last time i feel like i get anointed in it at this time [Applause] it doesn't matter if both of my socks are the same color so many people are looking for carnal things now i brought you to a trap you can hear a sermon for about an hour and remember the carnal part of that that's right two weeks ago some of you were mesmerized by kissing
