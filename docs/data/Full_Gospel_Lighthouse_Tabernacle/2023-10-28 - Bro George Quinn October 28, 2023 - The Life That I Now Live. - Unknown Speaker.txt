Lord so it's wonderful you may be seated just and and I I said I'm not going to keep you all night but uh Hallelujah I'd love to amen praise God um amen uh I was going to take an hour or something and write down all about what's happened and all that but I've I've bypassed that and um I know that uh you all most of you would understand that my wife passed away and in March at the end of March amen and she had the the vascular dementia so if you want to find out what that is you can look it up but that's what you had it wasn't alimer and it was um different a different uh the front lobe of the brain is what what she had so but uh it was a wonderful experience to be with her throughout the time of her illness and uh I did care for her uh myself um but uh the time came when they told us it would come and the time came when she was started to go down and we realized that it was getting close and then how the Lord took her the last day of her life as one of the most precious days that I've ever lived to see her just go into the presence of God the very house that she was born in to see her just left and the spirit of God just you could see her spirit lifting descending out of her and when the Medics came and all that and uh I knew they would never resuscitate her I knew she'd went home and that night when I was in in in bed well we we with the joy of having her for about an hour and a half after the police had left because it was they'd call it sudden uh but and all the Medics had left uh they were waiting for the coroner to see what he was going to do well I did not want the coroner to cut her up and find out what's I didn't want that but God spurred us from that so I'm I'm so glad now I know there's there's people suffering tonight with that in assembly here but amen I just trust and pray that all will go well God has a great way of doing things and the tender hand of Jehovah is so precious and he'll always deal with you that way amen praise God I'm so glad about that and uh that night I was telling brother Ronald that you know that night uh it seemed that she came to me and she wanted and I know my wife I was married to her just just a couple of months short of 50 years just a couple of months short but I know my wife and that night she seemed to be trying to draw me over to the other her side she wanted it was so and I know know that's she would have liked that that when she was in something like that she would want to share it with me and she seemed to be calling and pulling into to to that way and and my my it was wonderful and I just told her I can't go it's it's not for me at this time so ah it was it was awesome and uh amen I know she's in that the off anybody you believe in that don't you you believe in that the anybody hallelujah it's real praise God it's real as you and I are sitting here more real amen more real tonight amen so I just wanted to pass that on very quickly amen and uh I thank you for your prayers and I want to I want to say that what touched me to the to the core of my being what when your pastor spoke about her he said I thought he was going to speak for a couple of minutes and and he went on for about 20 20 minutes and even at the end of it he said you'll excuse me for being a little bit emotional it was just so touching what he said that woman from proverbs 31 and that's what my wife was she was a dear she never stood my way at all and all the years that that I was over preaching in different countries she never stood my way once and and and I just thank God for her and I'm looking forward to the to the reunion I'm looking forward to the reunion cuz it's coming Hallelujah yet coming so so we thank the Lord for that I really all my life brother Ronald I'll tell you what I I I'll cherish that moment that you can be here in this uh platform so we thank God for that amen and you know life goes on it really does you might have something missing amen you might miss their physical presence but sometimes you would feel her there and brother Branham said they're only as close as you want them to be that's what he said and I believe believe that amen how are you doing praise God brother madow how you doing remember you used to sit up here God bless you tonight Hallelujah and uh amen so so we're so thankful amen uh for that amen and life goes on the assembly goes on and funny enough uh after she departed uh we got another family into the fellowship when I was pleased with that amen praise God and uh so yeah so we're we're pressing on over there uh amen every week just like

Andrew you know I'm thinking here ah you know that's right that's like like numbers in the Bible for our young people tonight amen numbers in the Bible you got to get your mathematics right praise God hallelujah and and and so I was thinking about that uh I'm thinking about coming here and I was thinking yeah number one you know what is it number one's God hallelujah and and and there's one God he stands that number stands alone it stands alone you can't if you if you try to divide one you get 3/3 and Jesus isn't one/ third of the godhead is that right he's not one/ third of the godhead he is the godhead hallelujah praise the Lord and and and number two the for witness you know number two for witness Hallelujah the two witnesses that are to come and they will come because God said they're going to come hallelujah amen praise the Lord and um amen out the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every every uh word be established amen and he sent them out two by two praise God so we love that amen and three the Divine Perfection and when when you look at three it's God's Divine Perfection and you see it all over uh the shop amen he's perfected and not three offices and it is the first of the four perfect numbers 3 7 10 and 12 are the perfect numbers and you multiply them and you've got 2,000 520 that's the time of Israel's judgment and the dispersia and now I thank God he promised he' bring them back I was in Israel what a time I had in Israel oh I could keep you longer brother Andrew I'll tell you than you preach really could have started going into what happened in Israel amen and uh praise God I ended up in the River Jordan baptized in a moment and it was just incredible uh yeah so yeah that tree it's it's wonderful amen and and you can go end it all the time holy holy holy is the Lord because it's three and then he came by the water the blood H amen and not only that but by the spirit that birth witness the spirit of truth that should come three and of course there's three Bibles amen now I was talking on my journey but I'll just say it this much to you tonight very quickly I said when you go into the three Bibles you've got the Stars amen the young people might know this if I asked the the the young people I said maybe even some of you older people thinking well we are we we're in the Zodiac brother Bram said well that day it was pierces amen two fish praise God and one of them was going up the way cuz this is from the oldest zodiac and and the other one was kind of horizontal and and they were joined and and you know it was then it was the bride going up and Israel joined to them the Ruth and the Naomi praise God we've got they've got a we've got a tie in there and he said that was then but that ain't n we've moved on praise God and way back in the day I'm in because I'm what 25 multiplied by uh three okay so you can work out the m and that that's what age I am now but way back in the day when the heppies were there they were singing this is the beginning of the age of a Aquarius and they missed it a million miles but we didn't miss it because if you looked up in that ancient zodiac there he is the son of man pouring out the water Hallelujah out of the big vessel coming on and he's pouring it out on the earth and that's what what we got to drink off tonight hallelujah amen wonderful and and and you know uh when we looked at the the pyramid and going up that seven the the seven stands right up going up there uh to to the uh to the Big Stone that's on the top and when you get up it's about 3ot high at the top of them seven Ines and when you get up there what you find is there's a place called The Prophet's chamber yeah it's right there and and and you you can touch it praise God if you get up there and uh there's a boss on it but I'm not going to start preaching this tonight I just wanted to to say it quickly and so uh the the main point would be that when you leave that prophet's chamber the next chamber is the King's chamber the next you're the you're the queen remember that you've come right up from the Queen's chamber right through the prophet's chamber and now you're going to the king's chamber and and it's lovely to think about it that it's it's it's about 4 F feet high and you got to bow to get into that King's chamber Hallelujah you got to bow to get into that and brother Bram said a full head of wheat always bows and it so it does praise God because you're thankful amen for what God has done for you and and it's so wonderful that there amen and uh you know fors the fors the Earth amen the Four Winds and praise the Lord the four seasons of the world are the the year which I've really I've really enjoyed I think it re once there was one night when I was in Georgia there was a massive big Thunder bang you know and it rained and it was over in about 5 minutes and that's I was in bed so I didn't even see it amen and and every other day has been perfect and we've had some lovely weather up here he took me on his little cart and we've just went around and we walked together and wow I'll tell you it's been wonderful it's really been wonderful Hall Hallelujah so yeah and and five Grace for by grace are you saved Hallelujah by Grace nothing that I could have done to deserve God's only son Grace amen hallelujah uh through faith everything works through faith and Faith Works by love never forget that Hallelujah and six the number of man Adam was created the sixth day and then you've got 666 what is it man trying to prove he's God and he can't do it John Lennon Imagine there's no Heaven imagine there's no God imagine it's just only us here that's not the truth there is a God there is a Creator hallelujah praise the Lord and so uh the seven is the Perfection not the the Divine Perfection is God but the spiritual Perfection is the bride seven seven Church ages Hallelujah and we're right there the last one amen and he created the world in seven days amen and and we know that That's A Thousand Years is as a day with the Lord so thank God he done it on his own way in his own uh time and and he created it and the last thing was his the climax of his creation was making you and I that's it making man in his own image hallelujah praise the Lord and um the lovely thing about seven is uh you can't do it with one but you can do it with two but when you come to seven you got three and four three and four so if you look at the Divine Perfection and go going on with the four which is the Earthly number then you find God in some form in the Earthly number and here he is in the bread of Jesus Christ tonight Divine Perfection sitting in you and I tonight I think that's wonderful I think that's wonderful and you know uh Ronald I had a on on our ministry here I had a I was thinking deeply about Divinity what does it mean to be divine amen and uh I got a I got to been thinking about that um and it's wonderful there's only one Divine person and brother Bram was talking to a a a woman and she said I can prove that Jesus wasn't God so she started to say well he wept and he got hungry had to sleep and all he said yeah that's right that's a man he said but when he Stood Beside the tomb of Lazareth he proved he was divine yes he did when he called him out and so that the lovely thing about it is amen that uh praise God that that there's only one Divine person and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen and and you know I thought well what's the difference between deity and Divinity and and and this is what hard I think amen you forgive that but praise God and I come to find that amen the Divine person amen uh Divinity is the distinctive nature or the very essence of God Divinity is what makes him what he is God is love Hallelujah that is divine love Love's Divine or Love's excelling and Divinity speaks of what he is praise God and so and what he does and divine Authority and and for you and I we talk about divine revelation divine revelation brought us to the place we are tonight amen it's just wonderful amen the Lord Of Glory Hallelujah well could I just read you something here this only the only place and I'm going to finish the numbers I'm just going to cut that short but listen and in in uh Peter amen if I've got this yet second Peter right and just this is uh where it'll give it to you and you know in in Romans chapter 1 and verse 20 it talks about that he showed forth his godhead and and and and really the translation you can read There is he showed forth his divinity that's what that's if you check it up yourself and so praise God in in in chapter two of Peter amen leading us right up to the stature of a perfect man amen and and and this is what he says just let me read this here to you amen praise God hallelujah amen he says uh amen uh for if God spur not uh yeah let me see hold on I am in Chapter 2 here yeah and I want to get uh verse 1 to3 all right see so let me see here and uh amen praise God hallelujah yeah I am in second Peter

yourself amen the Lord just doesn't want to it Hallelujah yeah but the divine nature amen and the divine power that was granted to us amen given unto us all uh things that pertain to life he's given you everything that pertains to life tonight praise God everything everything Hallelujah the divine power has done that that we can become partakers of the divine nature amen that's it I want to be partakers of the divine nature I really do Hallelujah so praise God let's get on down to this amen and um you you will forgive me Indulgence this is the way it came to me that morning and so I'm just doing it now we will get to we will get to uh the life that I now live Hallelujah but before we do I was thinking that morning about some of my my favorite quots and for the young people too and maybe not so young one of my favorite quotes is this amen where brother brandham said amen you know we believe the five comments of Elijah I'm not going to go through them but we believe them hallelujah amen and there's one coming with Moses and he said there was two that time Moses and Elijah that would come to Israel and they're coming amen but this this quote he says now the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders wow so some people don't even know what the seven Thunders are there what well you know he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders that's what he's saying amen and praise God uh uh Amen in Revelation 10 and he goes on to say which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so that's your seven Thunders are there then the the the the the message that Hidden Mysteries that are contained in the Seven Seals and and he says I love this and he says that literally them divinely revealed mystery truths will literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers well I thank God for that tonight I know my heart's been turned back Amen to the Pentecostal fathers Hallelujah and and to see what I've seen in the Earth folks I'll tell you so many things and I know a lot of you Ronalds has seen far far more than I've ever seen but I'll tell you what I've seen a lot amen and that would take another another uh uh night's Journey but amen it's wonderful and and praise God he goes on to say now but consider this also the prophet Messenger will in his nature and manners H as were John and Elijah uh the people of this Prophet messenger's day will be as they were in a day well it's a terrible age we're living in amen you know that you don't need me to tell you that all what's going on in in the public uh realm and in John's day he says and he says and since it's only the children whose Hearts will be turned it is only the children that will listen so I'll tell you what when you're listening tonight and I know you are your heart's been turned back to the Pentecostal fathers amen and one thing about brother George here when I'm up there in heaven and they're telling me about their first church and what they saw and and it'll be wonderful and I'll be very courteous with them and say that's wonderful praise God and then we'll tell them what we saw hallelujah what we saw hallelujah amen oh yes it's so wonderful praise God thank you Hallelujah and the second one it's a beautiful thing I preached on memorials uh like joa did when they crossed the Jordan took out the big rocks and all and set them up but the one that I loved most was there the church has labored uh against against sin for 6,000 years against unbelief and the 7,000 is the Millennium Millennium and a memorial now when you get there remember this it's this Millennium what you're going to enjoy is a memorial to all creation that God has redeemed his church amen that's what it is hallelujah is not wonderful amen praise God and when he lets Man live through that thousand years it's a type and a memorial that he will never no more destroy man is that wonderful Hallelujah and there'll never be no more sin is not even better hallelujah praise God hallelujah and that's right we're right there now Hallelujah so I you know when I be on tax him with with Ronald amen and sometimes I leave him fairly long tax amen and sometimes he can give me a fairly Short tax saying wonderful but I don't Hallelujah I told him I said if you don't if you don't answer it's okay you know amen but I will tell you one thing the day he got the text just after my wife passed away that and she looked so sweet

same voice that spoke on the Mount of transfiguration the same one like the son of man and when he spoke there in Revelation one and the same one that you've heard today in the days of the voice amen of the seventh angel that was to come the same voice is in the bride tonight that's why look that's why the prophet had to go Hallelujah that the word could come to the bride amen it's not right Hallelujah it had to be that way praise the Lord because if he was still Liv even today be a no no whole man but the word would keep coming to the prophet Hallelujah you'd have to go there where the Prophet is there but now the word is coming to the bride amen and that's it's a living word praise God and that's what we're living by tonight amen so yeah and and that girl had an epileptic fit but

somewhere and people are listening to you at different places and and brother Ronald was listening to us in Connie when I was down there in blackburg wasn't it blackburg yeah blackburg brother sha Martin yeah we had a lovely night that night it was wonderful and so thank God that amen the come higher we're in a higher order tonight Hallelujah yeah and what could be higher than to go into the

scriptures and I love them too Hallelujah and what could be higher than we're going to be in the New Jerusalem one day amen hallelujah praise God what could be higher than that wonderful and so amen this is the deity amen Revelation and the wonderful thing is he said you have little strength you have not denied my name that's a very very wonderful thing because you know why amen uh the first time the name been spoke of since in the age right back there they lost the name and Luther come out uh with a name that he was alive and was dead that's right father Son and Holy ho ghost they and niia they lost the name and that was a wonderful victory for the devil to take the name out amen I'm going to sell something in just a couple of minutes about that but here we are and uh amen and he says but here comes out the name of Jesus again in between these two ages and here the open door there's a revelation what he was the deity the Revelation that he's God Revelation one that he's God hallelujah amen and so Hallelujah he said I am Alpha and I am Omega I'm the Supreme I am the first and I am the last that's what he said and so Hallelujah now uh the light comes from the East it sets in the west it's been a dismal dark time the Dark Ages terrible time terrible time amen why why was it terrible time CU they lost the name they're talking every even today the first thing a priest will say when he comes up onto the platform is in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost and I don't know what he's talking about and nerous heat amen praise God hallelujah see amen what did he say in the first church age I am he that that was which is and which shall come I am the first and the last I am Eli that's what he said the almighty he said it three different times there's another three for you amen and praise God made himself deity to the first church age before he went into the last Church age he said I've sat before you open open door I want to see the Revelation here it is where he would build his church that the name would be restored back to this and he says it praise God he says it the only way that he could take his church is back to the revelation of what he was and so when he got them up to kardish pan I remember Andrew preaching and describing all about all the idol and underworld and all that one night yeah and praise God that he says to him who do you say that I am well you're not the father Son and Holy Ghost like that I mean that's offices that's that's that's not a name and he said he said but what the people Jeremiah you know John the Baptist back what is it they weren weren't sure but he said who do you say that I am and that's the thing God can just say to you who do you say that I am amen praise God hallelujah and and Peter said Thou Art the Christ Thou Art the son of the Living God hallelujah and he said blessed are Dar Peter flesh and blood has not revealed that to you he said my Father in Heaven has revealed it and he said and Upon This Rock of who I am I will build my church and that's how he's done it with you with me with us all here tonight that know and loved the Lord Amen brother Marcus said all of us he's done it exactly the same by by revealing who he is amen and thank the Lord that we've got that tonight and do you believe it do you believe that he built a church like God Amen yeah yeah I was uh I just thr this in very quickly I was talking to one of my neighbors I go across to see them they're Presbyterians amen and you can see a lot about that but uh she was telling me that what they do there is when they get to a certain age they must read out a couple of things to them you know and they'll say Do you believe this do you believe that do you believe that yeah yeah yeah yeah do yeah okay then you're a presbyterian I and you're going to heaven and you're predestined and all that and that's fine that's wonderful oh wow but you know she said the last person that they did that with about two years ago she said she's living with a man she has a little child with him and she doesn't go to church that's where that gets you amen but praise God you know you're sitting here in this church tonight Hallelujah and you ain't going to hear any Guff like that Hallelujah but you will hear that God is in that new birth business Hallelujah the new birth business amen nothing less nothing less than that there amen and praise God so that is that is so true amen and uh the the last age had the name it had to be restored amen and praise God down from his glory ever living story it's wonderful it's wonderful I'll get on I'll get on as fast as I can amen because I've got more to come amen and exactly on Sunset Mountain I always look at the cloud picture that's our property get your hands off it if you don't believe it get your hands off it we believe it Hallelujah we know what happened and brother Bram was there that day and the Rocks came down and he was caught up in the air Hallelujah and he said go back to Jeffersonville the seeds are going to be opened amen hallelujah well wonderful amen and and brother Brown says the the Angels themselves were his wig just like in the in the day they still do it back home where they put the White H on you know uh over their head amen so praise God that's wonderful amen the Revelation amen and brother Bram said that that uh the Revelation as given to John by Jesus himself corrects the error of Eternity so Hallelujah so that's wonderful amen now okay now would you like a little handful on purpose here you know sometimes God gives you a little handphones on purpose amen and you know last last week Believe It or Not uh when I was leaving the motel I left my jacket in it and so I didn't even realize till I was way down in Georgia but I said well I usually keep things like that you know so maybe I'll get it back then brother Joe turned around and said they've got no record of it they don't know where it is and you've lost it and you'll give me another another a bit bigger than I am but it kept me warm and he gave me a jacket now he let me take it back to Ireland but the thing is when I went back a week later to that motel and uh by 3:00 I was getting out of the the car and uh the little manager came across she wanted to make it personal and she says oh Mr Quinn she says your jacket's been fir Hallelujah so I said oh God loves to do nice things for his people he loves to do nice things for his people amen I got my jacket back Hallelujah and she told me what happened they had found it and they put it in the lost and find place and somebody had put stuff on it and but eventually they got it anyway so that's the wonderful thing amen handfuls on purpose just to show you about the Supreme deity for a moment amen praise God you know when Moses went down to Egypt he only had a judgment rod that's all he had praise God and that's not a lot I mean you know as Pharaoh would say how many divisions have you got how many battalions have you got how many tanks and chariots have you got he ain't got none of that said well what have you got he said I've got a rod well that ain't going to do you much good against my Army amen said well okay let's see and then when he began say Let My People Go and you know he said if you don't the Lord's going to pour out these these uh curses on you amen and and so he raised up the rod and and my goodness all the different things that Came Upon them and flies and lice and all kinds of things and frogs oh till it was covered the land of Egypt then Lucas and and then the very last one with the the death of the firstborn what a time that was what a time that was one time I read brother around that that you know the firstborn usually had a a little bed uh they were nearest the floor so therefore when that that came in the door they would have got it first but I'll tell you what the firstborn were going to die no matter where they were sleeping Hallelujah and so amen and here he was and three times again three times uh Moses is recorded as using the rod bringing the plagues on the Egyptians crossing the Red Sea why cry speak and he would raise up that rod and see what happens Hallelujah and the Sea began to move and let them across wonderful so Hallelujah that is that is gr glorious amen and then hallelujah when and this is good too because when uh they were fighting the amalekites and josa was down doing his business and and and the they were winning when Moses had the rod up but then he got tired and so they they said well you sit here on this rock and and hold up the rod and and Aaron was on this AR and and her was on the other arm and as he held that Rod up they got the victory amen that was the Judgment rod in operation now can you imagine tonight that we're sitting here in this building and we've got the name that is above every name Hallelujah the name of Jesus Christ in my name shall you cast out Devils Hallelujah I've done it amen and some of them are tough cookies too you know that as well amen but they will leave Hallelujah if that person wants delivered I've never seen it happen any other way amen and so praise God we've got the name it's it's it's it's the power it's the strength behind the name that makes the devil tremble so you ought to be brother Joe it's lovely to see up there amen tonight God bless you amen and uh Hallelujah you know that name is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow you know there in when brother Brandon was up there in that that place and that the guy came out there way up in Washington state or wherever and and he was going to really go for brother Bram and he said because you challenge me you will get to my feet Hallelujah and he just crumbled up and fell down that was because there's power in the name there's power in the name there's Authority in the name wow oh Lord Jesus help us to use it more every day when we're alive amen use that name amen and and amen Our God our judgment name is that Rod tonight amen so it works it works it really does work if you ask anything in my name and believe it I will give it to you it works folks it works young people amen i' I preached for over in India a lot lot of young people come and say would you pray for my exams would you pray for them going into college and at Works Hallelujah it works Hallelujah wow amen and you know there was one time brother Bram was challenged by over in Europe and and and and way back in the tent my goodness and the winds were blowing and everything these people were trying to really disrupt the meaning really bring it down and and and you know there was one time when when this this wizard you would call him he challenged brother brandham uh to to uh show us power well he thought it was a billy gram or something coming along you know and so uh he said well what is it and he said no know you you've challenged you've challenged God here amen and praise the Lord so what happened was he actually lifted the table off the floor and he turned around he said to brother Bram he says no he said put it down and there was a challenge praise God and brother Branham just looked at it looked at him and he said right he said okay let's let's do it he said in the name of William Bram come down and it start where it was folks do you hear me it stay where it was amen

Ghost come down and nothing happened imagine that nothing happened in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost oh they were really smirking by that really smiling see just another another joke and brother Bram you'd know how he was where brother Ronald where he would just tell over and the head would go back and the hair would kind almost stand up and he just turned around and he said in the name of Jesus Christ come down and that table head the floor so hard amen and where did that wizard go amen he went with his tail between his legs that's where he went amen there's power in the name Hallelujah and it works amen okay okay amen I hope you're not looking at the time but I'm going to try and get on to the life that and I live yeah yeah I've got a lot if I went into this other message on it I spent a lot of time with my people on it going right back to the beginning right in the the Garden of Eden and then hard the fall came and where we were and and then we were born in sin ship and iniquity oh my but it was Paul that wrote these beautiful words amen praise God the life that I now live now that's an implication that he had lived another life and we know he had lived another life may as a little boy there over in maybe Ephesus or or or where he was born amen uh uh Tarsus I think it was but amen yeah when he was born there he was raised Amen in that Pharisee tradition got the best schooling there was and then would get bigger he he went to hear uh gel and he sh under the feet of gel the best there was the smartest there was that that he could get his education and and you know Paul would arose to Great Heights in the phy religion yes yes but you see Hallelujah there was something going to happen because God had another purpose and another plan for that man's life aren't you glad Hallelujah aren't you glad because it's the same as you tonight amen hallelujah oh my I'll get into that in a moment praise the Lord and so here he was and um amen one day his life was changed Forever on the way on the road to Damascus Amen to arrest the Believers he met with the pillar of fire oh boy that'll change everything Hallelujah you meet with God and God speaks to you that'll change everything Amen in your life amen and so here he was and um amen he said who are you Lord and he's blinded and he can't see it and he hears the voice amen it's good to hear the voice it's good to hear the voice you know remember Isaac Isaac said cuz his eyesight was going and he said well he said your skin feels like asau but your voice sounds like Jacob you know so praise God you

that was dangerous I'd be driving through Belfast you know wooo going to college and you know it all you you know you're WR you know it all like you know and I'll tell you what God was gracious to us but one one night he spoke to me and he says what happens if you had a car or if you had another vehicle and you're gone I said I'd be lost and I would have been but that got me that started me on the journey and when I was 18 a few events which I haven't time to tell you about but oh my about 2:00 I was wrestling and wrestling and I didn't even know if there was a god really I thought there was

not kept it but he has kept me oh all the way my savior leads me what have I to fear beside who I've trusted in who's always been my guide always been my guide led me every step of the way I heard your pastor one time say we don't have fear about what's in front of us praise God I've never had a n of fear when I went on to the the mission field and I've had some some times over there I'll tell you what in Vietnam wow they were they were they were not good people but I'll tell you what thank God he kept us amen I had a dream you know when God's going to post you about something he'll give you a dream or something and I had it and I knew there were after me but I also knew they weren't going to catch me amen cuz he said no Hallelujah I've got this it's wonderful like the quarterback I've got the ball he said don't you worry you just keep going on and I'll tell you what he led us all the way through yes he has and that was 1965 and you know something I'll just tell you this of a May because because there was a couple of Christians in in in in in the department that I worked in in the big area and one of them was a storan and I was talking to him one day and he said George he said I I hear you become a Christian I said that's right and uh amen he said well he said you know that's wonderful he said I'm about 55 and it's it's later than life he said I can't really offer God very much he said but you know George you can offer him your whole life I said that's right and that's what I intend to do offer him my whole life take my life and let it be consecrated Lord to thee take my moments and my days let them flow in ceaseless prayers and then there was another fellow that I was talking to and he said something that was really really good he said you know George he said let me tell you something he said my advice to you is this find out what God is doing and when you find out what God is doing get OT with all your heart amen no half measures 110% when you find out what God's doing get end it with 110% and that's when I found out that that brother Bram had come on the scene that he was calling it a bride Hallelujah I got into it with 100% amen 110% and I have no regrets amen when my wife passed away should believe what you believe tonight Hallelujah should believe this message absolutely 100% And I believe it too hallelujah amen wow I was talking to the The Undertaker and I said to him I said you know when we lowered her down I was telling Ronald yeah we we did that and lowed her into the ground and and I said to the Undertaker just to make sure I got it

book it for me if the Lord tiries just put me right in there beside my wife amen hallelujah so that's wonderful why cuz we know there's a day coming when they'll hear the voice of the Son of God it's and the bride whatever it comes and and the dead in Christ will rise and we're not just gessing it at her oh oh I really hope so we know amen I know where she is tonight sister Connie I know like your

they were nice to meet the door and all then they said we got to do do our thing and so they left and and there I was I got up to the the the the the balcony and I'm sitting there there's the minister he was actually a Scottish person living in Canada and so uh he had renowned for being a real man of of of prayer and God and so anyway uh people would come out to the front and he would touch them they would fall over and they would touch them and they'd fall over well that was that but but after that was all over he started to come up to STS because their site the minister Suite was at the back on the balcony at the back so he was walking along and he got level with me amen and he stopped and I'm looking there I'm looking ahead and he said you and I said yes sir me he said yeah you he said do you know God wants to anoint you and I said yes I do and he said well stand up so I said okay stand up so you know I didn't want to I didn't want to be pushed over so I just put my feet like

of fact he got rid of everything he said I counted it but but d that I may win Christ is that wonderful all the theology all out of your you know you know John John Calvin and the Calvin institutes oh man I would dve anybody mind that Andrew but I'll tell you what here's the thing folks John Calvin could see predestination in the Bible but he couldn't see high and high is it it's because you were in the mind of God I'll talk about it just in a minute that's makes predes ation real if you were there that Eternal mind there's an eternal something about you absolutely can I look at these people

wonderful and I thank God for it tonight the ministry that he's given amen and and you know Hallelujah it was uh this new life he had uh received the new birth amen and that transformed him into the man that he was amen and isn't it lovely where where where Paul talks about if any man be in Christ he's a new creation he's a new creature Hallelujah all things are gone amen could you imagine I would hate to think that there would be somebody here tonight saying these cigarettes these cigarettes are pulling on me they're pulling on me my goodness I'd have no more to smoke a cigarette or a

is it not wonderful it works it really works now I'm coming right down here a little bit hallelujah amen so so Timothy a great follower of Paul love to meet Paul one day amen but I'd love to meet ordinary Christians too there's a little fellow in the in in the Roman times and he may have been a slave I don't know but uh he became a Christian and then uh the authorities got him arrested and whatever not and they asked him to recant and he wouldn't do it and every time he said I'm a Christian and uh so they were trying to explain to him you know all you got to do is there is there little liage and some little vegetables here just bow down and you know he said I am a Christian he wouldn't bow hallelujah praise God they got him right into the the the the the Roman arena there in and in the coliseum in and in Rome and and here was his last chance all you got to do is B under that that little thing that little lady whatever and and and acknowledge it and worship it and you go out the door alive even if you don't mean it nobody will know you didn't mean it and he said I am a Christian and they put him to death and I want to shake his hand one day I want to shake his home and say thank you your testimony helped me Hallelujah because I also I'm a Christian Hallelujah I also am a Christian just like you and and and you know Ronald might tell you some of the things that i' I have went through but boy what a right it's been been a real roller coaster but he's never failed he's never failed and I've never been afraid amen even in India when the police came and and I said to the people after they left I said the the Lion's got me in his mouth and now we're going to find out can he close it can he snap the the teeth closed well I found out he couldn't hallelujah amen and God delivered us and I sent sent a brother around I said you know really when that dream came all them years ago brother Branham saying I hear you're going to India and and and and then he he reminisced about when he was in India then hallelujah he said God bless your ministry in India and I believe it was that that cap all them authorities in their place they should have deported me and they couldn't and they didn't and I can go back or have been back one sense and God willing I want to go back one time more amen praise God he's a warrier he doesn't seem it is amen and praise God yeah Hallelujah just to be with the bride one more time amen and so the Lord is faithful amen and and he hunted for you he hunted for me and he found us praise God he really did amen and Paul says you've known my Doctrine you've known my manner of life we can say that about brother brandham you've got the tips if you're unsure read it all up listen to it and you'll find out what God is saying and he never contradicts himself God never contradicts himself amen and so praise the Lord and you he could say the same thing you know my Doctrine I know the doctrine brother Bram brought and he said you know my manner of life I know how he lived praise God where where he couldn't even he told his wife one day would you in that tax case that the attorney wanted to see him and he said oh please just just tell him I'm not available he went in the another room and then he was so condemned by it that he went down to the attorney and he said sir I'm sorry he said I wasn't in the same room but but but I should have took your call amen so that's the kind of man he was lot of people don't know that that's the kind of man he was praise God and we know his manner of Life his purpose his faith his longsuffering his love and PS and charity amen and praise God hallelujah amen what a wonderful thing Paul was what a wonderful man brother Bram was Hallelujah we love him we love the prophet and folks

my name is in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah and the only way you can prove it is go right back to the beginning Hallelujah when you were in the mind of God and he thought about you Hal huah and and the first thing is he called you he called you it's like the call of the mountains The Call of the Wild but this was the call of God and that call came to you wherever you were and he called you Hallelujah and you heard and you answered the call ain't that wonderful praise God I did too we all did different ages don't matter my I I I was really tickled when you baptize that little girl 5

the servants but will be the wife of the bridegroom Hallelujah and so let me finish it off amen praise God Amen and so when he called me and I answered that hallelujah amen and I know that who I am I'm Justified as if I never did it in the first place you know folks you're doing a disservice to God when you say but what about my past if the blood means anything it means that God looks at you

rejoicing at that truth amen and I'm glad so I let forgetting those things that are past Paul says let us press on okay amen just a few little moments praise the Lord and and we're there amen and
