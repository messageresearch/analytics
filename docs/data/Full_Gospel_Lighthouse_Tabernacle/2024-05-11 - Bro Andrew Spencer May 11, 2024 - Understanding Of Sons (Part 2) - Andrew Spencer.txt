pass but so we're just we're certainly proud of sister Carly and uh and uh hopefully that she can turn around and teach them a few things so amen it's good to have my my good friend brother Matthew mcclard and his wife sister Dorothy they've become family to us and and uh I told him I said let's just do this more often so amen amen isn't it good to be a Christian amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to turn in the scriptures to to uh a very familiar uh portion of scripture there in Malachi 4 and verse 5 and also Revelations chapter 1en amen Malachi chap 4 and verse 5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children it's powerful how powerful that this ministry is that it would literally turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse Revelations CH 1 verse one and we realize that we are living in this hour we're living in the Fulfillment where we've seen the ministry of Malachi 4 and we are blessed people to be able to say that we understand by by the scriptures by Revelation that that was none other than William Mari and brandham but we just don't want to Simply see brother brandom's portion of scripture we want to see we want to see the great one in the picture we want to see God in the picture we want to see Elijah in the picture and we want to see ourselves in the picture at our hearts have literally been turned back to the apostolic Doctrine amen Revelations chapter 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show under the servants things which must surely come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant vant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw notice the scripture blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord and I'd like to continue our thought from last weekend on the understanding of sons and we realize that it is that it is the it is our heart that has been turned to the word that gives us a great understanding of the hour that we are living in for we recognize that this is one of the greatest times to be living in and what the we realize that that the Scribe of This Book of Revelation was John but the author of it was none other than Jesus Christ it is the only book throughout all of history that Jesus Christ literally wrote every single word of when he was here on Earth he stood there and he wiped out he wiped out what he was saying when the when the women were coming where the men were coming against a woman that had been caught into ad dotry he had wrote something in the sand but he wiped it out but this book of Revelation is the only book that was ever written by Jesus Christ and we recognize that by this by this letter that we recognize that there the Bible said that the time is at hand so what is that time it is the time when the revelation of Jesus Christ has been revealed to the body of Christ and Christ has been revealed not a dead God but in alive Living God right here amongst us and brother brandom said in the church and its condition he said so what could be any more better he said be any better for us to do today than to know that we are at the church for to EMB better ourselves or to broaden our understanding he said how many would say that's what I'm here for Lord see let's see I want a better understanding he said if we're going to have an understanding of God it must come out of God's word for the word is what God gave us to feed our hungry Souls so if we're going to EMB better ourselves if we're going to have a deeper Revelation if we're going to have a greater understanding we've got to Garner it right out of the very word of God and we don't want an intellectual understanding we don't want a knowledge of of intellectual knowledge but we literally want a revelation from almighty God to come sweeping down throughout the portals of heaven and begin to transfer us from this world of mortality into a world of immortality and and Jesus when Jesus would teach we know that when Jesus would teach that Jesus would use he would use he would use Parables and his disciples would ask him said why are you always talking to the people in riddles why are you always talking to them in Parables and he said it in this way in Matthew 13:11 he said because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to them that it but to them it's not given and it's so powerful to recognize that you understand what the master has been laying out the things that he's been that others can't see that others can't understand he's given it unto a generation to a people that can believe and a people that can understand who they are and have found their position by the preaching of the word they understand that they're living in a powerful moment of time and to me as a minister one of the coolest things that you can or maybe I shouldn't say it that probably ain't the preacher way to say it but one of the coolest things to say or the greatest things to say is to watch literally Revelation strike somebody it's one of the neatest things that you've ever watched you see somebody that's struggling on something or you see somebody that's maybe dealing with water baptism and they don't understand it or or they don't understand the godhead but it's one of the greatest things to be able to watch them as you begin to preach the word of God as the Revelation begins to drop in they begin to get illuminated by the preaching of the word and you literally see the light bulb come on I can imagine all these teachers that are sitting here that they have been throughout College Years they've spent time studying and they they spent some time looking at different things of how that they can teach a little child how that they can learn I think it's a powerful thing for for a teacher to be able to look out there and they studied these things they've looked at it but now they take what they have learned and they begin to drop it over to those students and then they begin to catch what the teacher has been giving out to them and then the light bulb comes on I'd say that's a powerful thing when a teacher can stand there and say I've done my job and they can move on to the next grade but this what has been given out no man has anything to do with this no preacher has anything to do with this except by the preaching of the word I if I learned you how to have the Holy Ghost somebody could learn you out of it if I learned you how to be heal somebody could learn you out of it but it's a powerful thing when Revelation strikes you because no devil can take it away from you no man can take it away from you no Doctrine can take it away from you but simply by the preaching of the word and Revelation strikes your heart what is it it's the preaching of the word that brings a revelation to a people that they have an understanding that he's talking about me it's like an artist it's like an artist a teach or somebody that's that's before a class and they're they're literally trying to teach a class how to draw out a certain figure or something i i s and I I said a while back and I I watched a teacher as they were they were teaching a an art class people that had wanted to sit down in a in a in a in a great arena there and wanting to draw something and the the teacher up on the platform had the idea of what he was going to teach to them before he ever let it out of his mouth and he would literally tell them now do this and the people would do that and they by the end of it they literally had what the teacher had they had it on their paper and that's exactly what Jesus Christ has done he has stood here and he's given us an understanding there's nobody that could nobody else could do it nobody else could put it on the paper nobody else could make it clear but there was somebody up in the portals of heaven and said this is my generation this is my belie Believers this is my hour I've got to give her an understanding that's what we watch in the Book of Revelation is that God in his artwork begin to draw out he started out in the beginning of Revelations 1 he draw in the certain parts of who Jesus was in his beginning but then you go down all the way to the end of the book of Revelation and the artwork has come into full view there Jesus Christ is not sitting alone but he's sitting there with his Queen to be he's sitting there with his wife Hallelujah brother bham said in the revelation of Jesus he said the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized he said Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize he said now I'm not talking about the Book of Revelation and you he said I am talking about all Revelation he said it is tremendously important to the church it is tremendously important to the church church then brother brandom goes in there to Matthew chapter 16 that we know that Jesus be to ask them whom do men say that I the son of manham and then he be to teach there brother ROM begin to teach on what the church was built on it was not built on a man but it was built it was not even built upon the man Jesus Christ but it was built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ was and what is a revelation it is simply faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you because we realize we pick it up in Hebrews chapter 11 and the Bible said that by faith Abel offered a greater sacrifice or more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain by faith Noah built an ark by faith Enoch walked by faith Abraham believed God by faith Moses forsook the things of Egypt it's by faith that gives you a revelation to recognize the hour that you're living in now Paul would say in 1 Thessalonians 2 and 13 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as in the truth the word of God which effectly effectually worketh also in you that believe how many thankful to be a believer here tonight so we're watching the physical we're watching the Revelation begin to work in you that believe now the Bible said in Deuteronomy 4:5 behold I have taught you statutes and judgments even as the Lord my God commanded me that you should do so in the land whether you go to possess it notice he said keep therefore and do them he's given the he's given his children statutes and judge judgments that land that you're going to go in there he said now keep them therefore and do them he said for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the Nations so if you're going to have any knowledge if you're going to have any understanding you've got to keep the law that God has given unto them that this would be your sight that this would be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the Nations which shall hear all these statues and say surely this great nation is a wise and an understanding people I'd say that that is the same way that the Nations have to look upon the body of Jesus Christ whether they receive it or not but there is a people in this land that recognize who they are they've been given a wisdom from Heaven they've been given an understanding from heaven for what nation is there so great who have God so nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him foro I don't know if you just catching what I'm putting down but you have a partnership with of Heaven you didn't get this understanding on your own you didn't get this from a pull pit you didn't get this from a book you didn't get this from seven steps of a book that you bought at Barnes & Noble you have a partnership you have an authority you have Heaven on your side you have a father and a son relationship that he's literally taking you through the scriptures he's guiding you through the scriptures he's teaching you through the scriptures he's he's not going to let you fail he's not going to let you fall he's not going to let you give up it's a relationship that he ordained by almighty God he set this up Hallelujah now we know that by the message and we recognize that Redemption has two parts that has two parts it's a coming out of and it's a going into that's why William br would say that there's got to be another Ephesians he said it's literally of coming out of unbelief and going into Faith he said it's another Ephesians he said it's a another Exodus as we would say it like that because Exodus means to come out of and we recognize the hour that we're living in we're living in the hour of the Third Exodus is that right but we recognize when we saw a prophet and a pillar of fire show up in the fir in the first Exodus it was a sign know that the first Exodus was at hand and at the second Exodus the prophet was the pillar of fire but in this generation in the Third Exodus the prophet and the pillar fire Has Come Again by the same anointed pillar fire and the same anointed system to bring a people from a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost into a spiritual land of our future home Hallelujah that's what he said he said we must have an exodus to come out out and to go into for the Rapture tell somebody I'm in that I'm in that and that is exactly what the message of the hour has done it brought us out of systems it brought us out of bad situations it brought us out of chaos and it placed us in a position that Sons and Daughters of God are destined for that's what the message did for you you couldn't have done it on your own when William Brandon preaches on May the 10 of 59 he preaches a sermon on Mother's Day and there brother random goes in there and he starts talking about when we begin to get on that side and we begin to see Jesus in his glorified body and we'll have a body like his glorious body brother bam said that there he will come and take his Majestic finger and he said all the questions that we had in our mind he'll come with that Majestic finger and he'll start unraveling and untangling all the knots he literally C in there and untangle the things in our mind how can this be how did I get it over here how did I understand those things but a majestic finger has come by the power of the message and has unraveled the knots some of you by your understanding shouldn't be in the room some of you by your understanding or by men's understanding should not be believing this message but by the power of an understanding that is greater than Humanity you are setting in the building by God's grace that's why the song says that we'll understand it better by and by we'll understand it better you may not understand everything right now you may not understand everything that you're going through you may not understand why you had a kind of weak like you had but I want you to know it's your season to be blessed you may not understood every trial you may not understood every test you may not understood why the enemy kept attacking you but I want to say by the word of the lord it's your season and you're in perfect season so if I can give you an understanding it's your season to be blessed so stop living a cursed life God didn't send you this message to curse you and condemn you God sent you this message to bless you bless you coming in bless you going out make you the head not the tail put you above and not beneath it's your season look at your neighbor say it's my season I don't know if you're in season for it but I'm in season for it I'm in season for it well we're passing days brother Andrew we ain't fully got there to them days I got bad news for you I'm there you said we ain't went far enough in our Doctrine I'm sorry I have said well I don't believe it like that I have I do I understand what the prophet said about this I understand what he said about this generation I'm not going down in defeat when job was lacking understanding a revelation sweeped down from heaven and gave him an understanding when he asked him job where was you where was you job I didn't see you in defeat I saw you shouting for joy and I want to tell Full Gospel Lighthouse you've had some times of mourning but it's time that you start living out the part that God seen you [Applause] in oh Blessed Be name of the Lord Blessed Be y'all know that y'all know that story when brother brandom brother brandom's up there hunting he's literally he's up there hunting he said it was like a real hazy foggy morning and he said I looked out there and he said out in front of me he said was three rainbows that was perfectly in line he said and he said I started walking to them how could they be how could them things be because William brandham had an understanding he had an understanding that that rainbow shouldn't be there but there was a supernatural element about William brandham that called him to walk to that to walk to that rainbow and he said I started walking and he said it was like the holy spirit said that's close enough right there brother he said then I begin to scream out oh God what would you have your servant to know and a voice screamed out that Jehovah of the old is Jesus Christ of the new he said it was simply confirming to me that all of my years of ministry was not in vain he said it was a confirmation that my message of him was right in line so the message that you have received it's not a message of William brandom it's a message of him it's a message of Christ it's a message of the anointed one it's a message of the Messiah and I dare let any devil rob you of your blessing I know every devil in hell has been after you because the weekend that you had last weekend but I'm here to serve notice on the devil we won't put up with it so get out of here devil get out get out of our mind get out of our spirit get out of our home get out of our worship get out of our spirit get out of here there's a blood there's an anointing well somebody give God praise for a moment he's the Lord that planted it and he's the Lord that Waters it so let's water it come on somebody you know I didn't say them things over you last weekend that was an anointing and all of hell has been trying to rob you of a dispensational change you know you fought it in your spirit you know you fought it in your body you know you fought it in your mind so where did that come from then dismiss the devil get him out of here this is my service this is my time the time's at hand it's time to dismiss the devil it's time to enjoy his presence it's time to have full Victory go ahead go ahead [Applause] I'm giving you I'm giving you what you were built to do I'm giving you rights Satan tried to rob you from your rights but I come to give it back to [Applause] you that's what Paul said that I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth within me so the message is a life it's a life and you see people that constantly sitting under the message and they don't understand the message it's because they don't have a life there but all you have to do is come under it come under this token come under this life there's power here we still got a token we still got a blood hallelujah what is it in this hour he's beginning to reveal his hidden secret Mysteries to his bride he's Whispering his sweet I love you there's one thing very powerful about keeping a secret it's got to be for the right moment it's got to be for the right time when you husbands try to plan a get away for your wife and she spoils a secret everything goes disarray you know my teeny was the world's worst at Keeping a Secret world's worst not it wasn't it wasn't for understand me understand it wasn't that she had a had a mouth that she wanted to tell anything and everything but with us grandkids she couldn't keep a secret if she had us a gift and she had us something I never forget Tonight Whitney we all knew it all the Spencers knew we Whitney was getting a horse and I'm pretty sure dad was packing a baseball bag or a shotgun to take care of Papa for giving her a horse that day but but we all got we got there real late we done moved up here we done moved up here and back in 2000 and we got up here and Papa Charlie done bought her a done bought Whitney a horse and she done he's keeping a big secret we got there late at night and you couldn't see a lick of thing we did that on purpose we got there and we we all went straight to bed and Tiny stood out there she said Whitney do you know what you getting in the morning no I don't well she take her out there we had them big old glass windows out there out in the front of her little house one of them shotgun house had a big circle in it you completely run around that thing over and over again I'm pretty sure Papa Charlie playing that but she took said Whitney go out there do you see anything out there at the barn she no tiny I don't see anything well honey in the morning you're getting a horse she went back to bed but Whitney didn't the secret had been given away but in this generation it was a secret time for a secret moment that the time was at hand that even brother said that when when Spurgeon Spurgeon set his writers down and said don't took that don't touch that book of Revelation because there's coming a prophet in the last day and he'll reveal those things because it's at this time William brandham said William Bram said it in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said he was letting out his Secrets he was revealing he was Reve he was letting it out when you let it out you can't get it back right it couldn't they couldn't get Whitney back to sleep after that let me tell you how can you L us back to sleep in Le Osa I done heard a secret I done heard that he's coming it's done let out he's done revealed himself he's here he's coming don't you worry don't give up don't back off he's coming what is it Revelation Webster says that Revelation or reveal means to make known and he goes in Webster would go on to say that reveal in Divine truth that Revelation means brother man picks it up said the Revelation it is Christ's way of making himself known to his church I love what brother brandom goes on and does here in Christ of mystery he goes into Matthew chapter 16 and whom the men say that I the son of man am and then he goes in into Matthew 17 on Mount Transfiguration and it goes right back in to Matthew 16 of whom the men say that out of the son of man him because there we recognize that in Matthew 17 that Jesus Takes with him Peter James and John up there and he takes him up there it's faith hope and charity that he takes up there and he goes up there and there they begin to see Elijah and Moses and Jesus and his body Shone with the glory of the Lord and Peter said it's good for us to be here let us build three Tabernacles you see where a c where he was living at he was living in the moment because they were still thinking at that time that he was going to be a general or a warrior but you see he could not take them into Matthew 17 without them going into Matthew 16 there's got to be a revelation before there can be a Transfiguration are you with me before you can be trans figured you have got to have a revelation of who he is and the Bible said that there came a cloud and out of the cloud came a voice and said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when it was gone away they saw no man but Jesus they saw no man but Jesus and when the message turns your eyes you don't just see elaser you see Isaac you don't just see William brandom in that picture you see the pillar of fire in that picture what was it the message turned your thinking you don't think them kind of thoughts no more there's a lot of people that look at that picture of pillar of fire that happened in Sam Houston Coliseum down there and all they see is William brandham but to you and I we see Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel over Revelations 10:7 what was it the message turned what is it it's a sign that supreme power is right here that supreme power is with this message well I don't know if I can I don't know if I can go all that way let me tell you that William brandham said that the angel of the Lord accompanies the message wherever it goes so I can say that supreme authority is here if you can recognize your position that supreme power that supreme authority that Supreme judgment that a supreme word is here what happened in this generation what happened out there in 1963 what happened out there in in m in Sabino Canyon what showed up out there them Angels was meeting your Prophet to tell him to go back home don't just leave it closed up William brandom but turn it loose let it out let it out if you saw that picture for sis and there you re you you see we're all very familiar what is that up there that's our Lord Jesus Christ now that's packed in Life Magazine notice it wasn't in Luke luk magazine it was in Life Magazine cuz you ain't just looking at this for one in moment this is life this is power and William brand caught that he caught that and here he comes back and it is the rising of the sun he begins to preach that message he said there just the other day he he said it was put to me at my kitchen table that there in that Life magazine in that in that in that magazine there he said there they begin to see show me this said William brandom have you seen these things and he looked at it then the angel of the Lord told him turn it to the right he said notice what he said he said turn it back the way that it's supposed to be turn it back the way that it's supposed to be and when William baram said he said now look that's Christ up there that ain't Jesus that's Christ up there what is it it's the anointing it's Revelations 10 it's a sign in the heavens and you hear the crowd and it is the rising of the sun you hear the crowd say he said look you see his eyes you see his features there he said that's our Lord turn it back the way that it's supposed to be what is it it's turned towards what is it the head is looking on his body if you'll turn your understanding back to the way that the message supposed to be you'll have power in your message again come on somebody if you preach it the way it's supposed to be preached you have power in it come on somebody we didn't take that picture our critics took that picture what is this message it's none other than Jesus Christ it was him in Sabin Canyon it was him that was out there on them Waters and said give that little fishy back his life it was him that said speak worlds into existence and they came into existence it was him that said pray the prayer over sister ma before the doctor touches her the tumor will be gone it was him there's a there's a young brother I may not I may not just call his name but there's there's a young brother that's that's going around and he's taking testimony videos and I'm I'm going to share something I don't know if it's exactly been told everywhere yet but I'm I'm going to tell it but it was as a young brother he going to different ministers and he's he's taking testimonies of of of what the message is and kind of their testimony of of how they came to the message and so we this this brother was sitting down with brother darl waren and he was kind of giving his testimony of things like that and his daughter and all the different things of of of what the message was and how he came to the message and he comes down to the end of it and he's got he's got his camera up on a tripod he got his camera up on a tripod and he's there videoing brother Daryl and he he said brother darl he said what is the message to you and I asked brother darl this while I was down there in Johnson City a few weeks ago he said he said I he said I said well that was the first revelation that I caught when I came to the message is that the message is Christ he said when I said that he said that camera he said it he said it started going on that on that tripod [Music] and he said and and the brother that was doing The Testament said I don't know what what that is he said that's never happened happen to me before when they go back and review the footage when brother Daryl said he said to me the message is Christ the camera shifted from Brother Daryl over to the pillar of fire picture and then over to the Hoffman's head of chist fulfilling exactly that this message is Christ what's a message to you brother Andrew it's nothing else Hallelujah come on somebody if nature testifies that Jesus is real how much more has son and daughters of God should we stand up and identify ourself with a purifier in this generation I am not ashamed I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of that cloud I'm not ashamed of the pillar of fire am I'm not ashamed of Mark 16 [Applause] Hallelujah that biso said he said he said I there I was he said I i' done giving I've been giving this little cam recorder and he said I was videoing our footage while we was out there hunting and he said he said he said brother Brandon probably fired me fired me for being a videographer after that he said he said I was learning all things and he said their Bud was working on them horses and that that horse you remember so that horse raised up he said that he said that's just a mean old horse he said that that horse raised up and kicked Bud right in the chest brother bisco said I he said I looked he said I told brother brother brandom said look he said if we don't get if something don't happen he said that horse going to kill butt and brother brother biso said I was videoing on that camera and he said he said all of a sudden he said he said that great big horse is coming he said he said it zoomed in real quick and come in there he said he said all of a sudden he said I turned around and he said that horse was just shuttering and completely calmed down he said and I turned around and he said brother brandham was putting his hat back on brother Bisal said that even nature had to testify that he was a prophet you know when we was here when we was having brother Steve Thomas's funeral how many was here that day he was here it's a sign we had brother Steve Thomas' funeral this been told a 100,000 times but we're going to tell it again because this ain't our story this is his story we had brother Steve Thomas laid out here in in his casket of be beautiful beautiful decoration and we' asked for a special privilege from almighty God to come and hold us up in that service and people throughout this building begin to testify that they saw the pillar of fire hanging over the ministry while they were delivering the word and the pillar of fire sweeped across where we had these bouquet of flowers and the pillar fire as it swooped across flowers begin to open up in the presence of the sunlight what am I saying unto you you've been given an understanding to recognize that you're not alone in this world and if you're not alone if nature testifies that we're not alone how much more should you give witness do I have a witness that there's a people that understand who they are when they looked up there they didn't see Moses had seen Elijah they saw Jesus only what was it when Moses was up there on Mount SII it simply changed his face when he come down he had to put a veil over his face he said the shepherd Prophet Moses he said who Jehovah was in in a portion he said just a portion he he said his face he had the word in his mouth he said but notice when the Great Shepherd was in the presence of the shakina what did it do it changed his whole countenance he said he wasn't just a part of God he was all of God he was Emmanuel he said that's why it had to be Shepherds because you are living in an hour that you understand that you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on supreme power on supreme authority when Jesus is there in Matthew chapter 4 and Satan begins to tempt him with the kingdoms of the world world and said if you'll do this I'll give you all of the kingdoms of the world Jesus simply answered him with it is written brother random said that Satan was wondering he said but Jesus Knew by experience Satan knew it by knowledge he said but Jesus knew it by an experience that he was the son of God and by the token Life by the power by the anointing you understand you understand by an experience you don't have to take no thought what you're going to say Jesus said when it comes to your time he said because of me you're going to be delivered up there into the synagogues you're going to be delivered before the prisons he said but take no thought what you're going to say that's what the scripture said he said he said and it shall turn to you for a testimony notice in Luke 21-14 settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what you shall answer for I will give you a mouth where's the word at in this generation it wasn't in our hands it's in her mouth come on somebody where's the word at in Revelations 10 I know it'll cause bitter Waters I know it'll cause a war but where's the word at in your mouth that word never failed in those early Apostles as long it was in their mouth and that word will never fail in your mouth I will give you a mouth some of you need to shut your mouth and get his mouth I'm at home I can say it shut your mouth and get his mouth you heard me brother Andrew some of you needed to hear it for I will give you a mouth not just a mouth and wisdom that goes for Trump that goes for Biden every one of them's got a mouth but ain't got no wisdom behind it but I will give you a mouth and I will give you wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gain say nor resist it I'm giving you such a power I'm giving you such a liberty that's your Devils that's your enemies that depression that anxiety that complexes that back pain I'm giving you a mouth of wisdom stop the mouth of your [Applause] liance I know I'm fighting against it but I want you to know I dismissed that devil long ago because he's given you Authority he's giv you a power he's giv you a way weapon and there's no weapon that is formed against you that shall prosper every gate in hell has been stopped by this revelation of not William Branham of not a church but by Jesus Christ when Peter and John walked by the beautiful gate that day and there laid that man had laid there all them days when Jesus went to the synagogue there his boys walked up there and said today is your day said look on us such as I have give I Thee in the the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk let me tell you something what the scripture said and he ran leaping he ran leaping when's the last time you leaped your way to church when's the last time you danced yourself to church when's the last time you had such a prayer meeting that you came in here speaking in tongues drunk on the Holy Ghost when's the last time well if it ain't if it's been a long time look on on us look on us when's the last time you had a prayer meeting and you broke through and all of Heaven came down when's the last time that you got so drunk on the holy ghost that you didn't know what your name was and the Bible said in chapter 4 that when the Pharisees and the captains and the Chiefs when they came before for them he said the Bible said that they took knowledge that these men had been with Jesus why you acting the way you're acting let them take knowledge that we've been with Jesus let them take knowledge that cancer has to Bow because we've been with Jesus let them take knowledge that barness has to Bow because we've been with Jesus let them take knowledge I've been with Christ let him take let them take knowledge this ain't Pentecost this ain't a restoration of gifts this is a restoring of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost come on somebody we didn't get our criteria out of a man's book we didn't get our criteria out of some Creed we got our crer out of Acts chapter 2 I'll tell you what the Bible said the Bible said that deacons had such an understanding that the Bible said in Acts chapter8 and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which philli spoke hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did this Deacon had an understanding that he stood up and preached the word that all of them gave heed to what Philip spoke hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did the preacher didn't do it the Deacon did it come on somebody it ain't just brother Ron's job it ain't just brother Andrew's job it ain't just brother William's job it ain't brother just brother Matthew and brother Matthew's job it's your job I tell you what this is showing is that deacons have more power sometimes than some Pentecostal preachers that they had to take knowledge by The Miracles and the Divine gifts that was there in which Philip done well I tell you what it's time that some Churches turn loose their churches back to the deacons if the preachers can't produce signs and miracles come on somebody if we're a Mark 16 church and we're a church in action then there's got to be signs following us come on I'm not teaching you something new I'm teaching you Bible Doctrine come on if AA Allen could stand out there while he was drunk while he was drunk stand out there and preach the word as a drunkard preach the word read some of these same scriptures that you read take people by their feet go watch it on YouTube take them by their feet and their feet grow out three inches take people that ain't got no voice ain't got a voice and after he prays for them they turn loose singing like a mocking bird leave that meeting go get in a car and a brother that was a preacher in this message said he would watch him go up there to the liquor store people watched him check into hotel rooms under the name of William brandham and go under there and live with a prostitute for a night you see how Wicked he was a drunkard and do them kinds of things but the anointing come on the anointing of an Angel was released in this generation and men were operating under the power of an Angelic meeting in this generation because the Covenant is not built upon who you are the Covenant is built on faith and them people thought they were watching Jesus come on now now maybe I'm like Gideon if God before us then where be all of his miracles if or Roberts if AA Allen if Jack co could have that and not live right I'm not saying anything about them other brothers I don't know their entire life but they were not your Prophet messenger AA Allen had so many miracles but live such a dirty life if them brothers could stand there and pre pre this gospel and produce them type of Miracles how about you Housewives how about you little girls if God be for us if God be for using where be all of his miracles give me some Jim Noel's give me some Ray Lamberts give me some Randall Griffiths give me some Dorothy mlars [Applause] you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you shall cast out devils and they shall leave you shall take up any deadly thing and it shall not harm you and you will speak with new [Applause] tongues God's this message and there will be Miracles come on somebody he said I am the vine and you are the branches and if you be in me and my word by being you abide ask what you will and it shall be given unto you come on somebody you have watched a bunch of grafted lemons grafted onto an orange tree but William brandham said if that orange tree ever brings forth another Branch it'll produce oranges that's why you're a continuation of the book of Acts that's why there's Miracles following you that's why signs are following you you're a branch and the same life is Flowing from the vine Hallelujah you ain't looking for somebody just stand there and quote the word he ain't looking for somebody that just simply spit things off but let me put it in ad do terms he's looking for a body that's got an experience he's looking for a body that knows how to move he's looking for a body that understands their position they're not placing things in the past not placing things in the future they're putting the present H that he is that I am that I am if you look in the first Exodus in Exodus 12 and the Lord called for them to come out called for them to come out what was it it couldn't be anything else but the blood of the Lamb come on somebody is the blood still there daddy daddy I hear the neighbors crying I hear that I hear the cry in Egypt daddy is the blood still there I'm your oldest son daddy is the blood still there daddy and the daddy would take him out and show him son there is a token there is a power there is an anointing for Gospel Lighthouse is the blood still there or are you caught up young boys playing PlayStation all nights in the hour are you caught up looking at things that that you shouldn't be looking at is the blood still there is the blood still there son let me show you something that innocent lamb gave his [Applause] life there's a blood there hallelujah what was he giving him he was giving his son an understanding you don't have to worry you don't have to fear put it away put it away put it away and take a look there is a blood there it ain't just a chemical it's a token life it's the life of Jesus Christ you don't have to worry you can hear the cries of Leota you can hear the cries of Egypt you can hear the cries of pharaoh you can hear the cries of Biden you can hear the cries of Palestine you can hear the cries of Israel but don't you worry son I paid your price come on now put your shoes on put your shoes on eat this book Eat This lamb eat all of it don't just leave part of it in there come on somebody throw your habits out and eat the lamb throw your jealousy out and eat the lamb there it is I rebuke that jealous spirit in the name of Jesus Christ stop wanning other people's gifts stop trying to hide gifts Hallelujah come on eat the lamb eat the lamb enjoy this lamb I'll tell you what this lamb will do it'll take you out of Egypt and put you in the promised land eat the lamb eat the message digest the message put your shoes on come on somebody you got to be ready you got to be ready because just in two chapters we going to have oursel a dancing party eat the [Applause] lamb hallelujah hallelujah is the blood still there [Applause] are you willing to come out to go into because that's the hour that we're living in come out of traditions come out of your habits come out of your ideas don't get mad at me it's a spirit of God I ain't talking about some person I'm talking about a spirit and no Spirit has its right in the Church of the Living God we have a blood we have a token in this day we've been given a token which is an antitype of the type of the natural token we've been given the supernatural Supreme token all that foreshadowed was been has been given to this generation has been given a token and now we have the Holy Ghost is our token it is our identification that we have accepted the death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus a human life to come back on us but it was God himself manifested in the flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons I'm going to read it again it was God himself manifested in flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons that now we are Sons and Daughters of God that is the token it is our identification of the Passover it's our identification that we have believe God and God has accepted us how do I get adopted brother Andrew Acts 2 and 38 come on somebody receive you the Holy Ghost for the Bible said in that Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father you have not receed the spirit of of bondage again because you see they were living under the old Covenant of the law which required Works which required a performance-based life which depends upon man sufficiency which simply produces spiritual bondage that's right that's right the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God you see by the Cross by Jesus giving his life at the cross living by the New Covenant of Grace it provides not a performance-based life but a relationship based life Hallelujah you're not depending on your own Works you're not depending on your own self but you're depending upon God's sufficiency so therefore this relationship that you have with the body and the headship it it brings about a relationship that results in in spiritual Liberty and as the Bible said that where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty let me tell you this Liberty that this message has brought to you it has not only given you a power and a liberty to shout it's not only giving you a liberty to dance and to speak but it's given you Liberties to act like a Son of God like Mark 11 and speak to the mountain be thou cast from here to Yonder it's given you a liberty to allow signs to follow you come on somebody this message has given you a liberty to live a holy life this message has given you a liberty to dress right according to Deuteronomy 22 and5 this message has given you a liberty to speak the word under Authority like Matthew chapter 8 when the Centurian came to him and he said I have a servant that lay sick in my home he said don't you ain't got to come into my house but simply speak the word and my servant will be healed and Jesus said I have found not so great a faith all in all of Israel in this man because he understood Authority and Jesus goes in Matthew 9 and he declares and he does Miracles because he watched we are watching the son of man in his authority and in Matthew chapter 10 he turns around and gives that same power back to the Church of the Living God and then he turns when Luke picks up what Jesus does he picks it up in Luke 10:18 and he says and he said unto them I behold Satan last lightning falling from Heaven what was it it was when the church was receiving her power that Satan lost his position is that right it was when the church received her power that Satan lost his position and it's the same way every single time that a son and daughter of God grabs a hold of a revelation Satan loses his power come on somebody when you grab a hold of something and said I'm not a slave to fear no more Satan loses his power when you reach up there said I'm not a spirit of fear I'm not a spirit of bondage I've not received those things but he's come to give me a sound mind of peace and of life and since they Gabrielle it's his mind Hallelujah I'll tell you what you ought to do you ought to cast that devil out that's what Jesus did when he came here he cast that devil out and that's what William Brenham said in the greatest battle every fought that God's Army is commissioned to do the same thing kick him out ah I'm coming I'm bringing it to you Revelations 12:9 and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil call him anything you want to cast him out which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out in the earth and the Angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation I'm saying this to you don't wait one more moment you live one more second with the devil it's too long now it's come my salvation I'm free from Pain I'm free from torment I'm free from anxiety I'm free from depression I'm free from pain in my body I'm free from Leota I'm Sav from sickness I'm saved from depression and now has come salvation and strengthen the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives under the death it's time to have yourself in Exodus 15 it's time to sing the song of Moses you got the blood on the door you done marched all the way out here you done watched him in Exodus 13 you done watch watch him in Exodus 14 as a pillar of fire came down the rest of the world don't want to identify it but there at the Red Sea it's still a sign that the pillar of fire came down and stood between them and all of Egypt that when the shores go back on the Red Sea you can still see smoldering sand that has burned been burnt in place where Footprints are still here 4,000 years later it's a sign that we will walk over we will come out and we will leave come on somebody it's time that you go into your Exodus 15 Hallelujah therefore Rejoice Rejoice you heavens and ye that dwell in them I'm saying that this message has given you Liberty to [Music] Rejoice sister Gabrielle I was woke up real early this morning and I had this thought on my heart it just kept coming to me just kept coming to me and we're here tell them it's their season to Rejoice it's your season it's your season now I ain't telling you that by my emotions and I'm not telling you by that by Illusions I'm telling you that by the word of the Lord therefore Rejoice can I give you some scriptures for your season that you're in Psalms 32 and11 I'm coming down be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous and Shout for Joy all ye that are upright in heart verse chapter 31 And1 rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright praise the Lord with a harp sing unto him with a salry and an instrument of 10 strings sing unto him a new song play skillfully with a loud noise for the Lord for the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth and when Jesus had given the church power and Satan had fallen like lightning he stood there in verse 10 chapter Luke 10: 20 and said not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven in no other age can you know that you're chosen like this age you going to catch up with where I'm already at the devil's already been cast out but don't Rejoice about that Rejoice because you can't get lost Rejoice Rejoice because your names are written in heaven and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight now we don't think that Jesus really got all As Pentecostal as all y'all well y'all know I'm about Bible man you know I'm not going to preach to you anything unless it's in the Bible ain't that right cuz I ain't got no Authority on my own word because I can tell you anything and it can fall to the ground but if I tell you something and there's an authority behind it that in the same hour Jesus Rejoice say it with me rejoice in the spirit the word properly means to Jo for Joy I just can't picture Jesus
