[50:08] Powers against the rulers of the
[50:10] darkness of this world against spiritual
[50:12] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[50:15] unto you the whole armor of God that you
[50:18] may be able to withstand in the evil day

[50:27] with truth and having on the breastplate
[50:30] of righteousness amen I pray that the
[50:33] Lord bless the reading of the word as
[50:34] you have your seats as you read that
[50:36] scripture you notice it doesn't sound
[50:38] like that that the people are getting
[50:40] ready to go on a picnic
[50:41] he's talking about to be strong and put
[50:44] on the whole armor of God and and to be
[50:47] courageous and how we're going to be
[50:49] um wrestling against not against flesh
[50:51] and blood but against principalities and
[50:53] Powers he's describing a conflict he's
[50:57] just it's not a picnic that we're
[50:58] reading about here but but he tells us
[51:00] that when we've done all that we can do
[51:02] to stand to stand in other words go
[51:06] beyond what you're even capable of after
[51:09] you've done everything you can do when
[51:12] you have nothing left to give give some
[51:14] more but where does that come from where
[51:17] does that extra come from where does
[51:18] that strength come from when you don't
[51:21] have the strength to stand
[51:22] that's where he comes in the picture
[51:24] you've done all you can do and you're
[51:27] about to give up and you're about to
[51:28] quit and you can't go anymore he says
[51:30] stand now if he commanded you to do that
[51:32] but he's already spoke that he
[51:34] understands you've done all you can do
[51:36] but he commands you to do that then he's
[51:38] obligated to come and give you the
[51:40] strength and the ability to continue
[51:43] standing amen we're in a tough spot
[51:45] we're we're in an evil time and
[51:48] sometimes it feels like I just can't go
[51:50] on you just keep standing he's going to
[51:52] provide exactly what you have need of
[51:55] Amen
[51:57] we're going to speak tonight for a
[51:58] moment on the final stand
[52:01] the final stand and we're standing in
[52:05] uncertain and Troublesome times but but
[52:08] only uncertain in the sense of Earthly
[52:10] things amen it's only uncertain in the
[52:13] sense that our politics are corrupt it's
[52:17] only uncertain in the sense of of the
[52:19] education system has become the
[52:21] indoctrination system it's uncertain in
[52:24] the sense that economies are unstable
[52:26] things out here in the world are
[52:29] unstable so tonight if my Hope was in my
[52:32] job if my Hope was in a 401k or in a
[52:36] retirement plan or in Social Security or
[52:39] My Hope was that the government's going
[52:41] to do the right thing to take care of me
[52:42] I would be the most miserable of people
[52:45] tonight amen but that's not where our
[52:47] hope is tonight Our Hope has been turned
[52:50] away from the things of this world and
[52:52] our hope has been turned not from the
[52:54] day today but to a never-ending day to
[52:57] Eternal things that's where our hope is
[52:59] tonight it's in the unfailing God who
[53:02] has given us an unfailing word and
[53:04] tonight we look at that we know if he
[53:07] can't fail we can't fail because he's
[53:09] leading us into battle it's him leading
[53:12] the charge it's him guiding it's him
[53:14] providing if he's unfailing he's never
[53:16] failed he's not going to start tonight
[53:18] Church he's not going to start tonight I
[53:21] look at his track record and I see
[53:22] victory victory victory victory victory
[53:26] what will we have tonight in the house
[53:28] of God Victory after Victory after
[53:30] Victory you can't lose you're not gonna

[53:43] done all to stand stand there for you
[53:46] are not gonna lose tonight
[53:48] Hallelujah there will be victory
[53:53] if my Hope was in those things I'd be
[53:55] pretty shook up tonight
[53:58] and the fact is things are pretty stable
[54:00] compared to what they're going to be
[54:05] I don't want to be what they might call
[54:06] a Debbie Downer
[54:09] if there's any sister Debbie's here
[54:11] tonight I'm sorry
[54:13] or anything oh I don't know I gotta go
[54:15] that one I know there's a sister Nancy
[54:17] in this church

[54:24] things are not gonna get better
[54:27] but all of these things that the rest of
[54:29] the world is looking at is going to pass
[54:31] away
[54:32] the good of it the bad of it and the
[54:34] Ugly of it is all gonna go because it's
[54:36] temporal
[54:37] and it's fleeting
[54:39] and they're All Shook Up but they don't
[54:41] know what to do about it
[54:43] they don't know where to turn that they

[55:33] falling apart and yet our minds are
[55:35] completely out peace or are completely
[55:37] at peace how is it because in his arms I
[55:40] feel protected in his arms I feel safe
[55:43] in his arms I'm secure there's no place
[55:46] that I'd rather be how can it be that
[55:49] way because whether it's good times or
[55:52] whether it's bad times whether it's well
[55:54] times or whether it's sick times whether
[55:57] it's Rich times or whether it's poor
[55:59] times I'm gonna wake up I'm gonna put on

[1:05:39] now you want to entertain angels look
[1:05:41] for them prepare for them have an
[1:05:44] atmosphere ready for him and get your
[1:05:46] head out of the news cycle
[1:05:47] he was in the tent door looking
[1:05:50] and because of that
[1:05:52] he received a body change
[1:05:55] let's turn our eyes back to the truth
[1:05:56] tonight
[1:05:57] turn our eyes back to the message
[1:06:00] back to the task at hand
[1:06:02] and begin to focus once again on what am
[1:06:04] I called for
[1:06:06] because by staying focused on all those
[1:06:08] other things you're literally getting
[1:06:10] engrossed in what they're called for
[1:06:13] I'm not called to what they're called to
[1:06:17] so why would I feed on what they feed
[1:06:19] them
[1:06:20] I'm called to something different
[1:06:22] so that's where I want to put my focus
[1:06:24] tonight
[1:06:27] what am I called to
[1:06:29] why am I here what am I to manifest what
[1:06:32] did he manifest
[1:06:33] why was the son of God manifested to
[1:06:36] destroy the works of the devil well
[1:06:39] listen here bone of his bone and flesh
[1:06:41] of in flesh prophet of God said that the
[1:06:43] church would have the same type of
[1:06:45] ministry repeat that the group The Bride
[1:06:47] would have the same ministry as the
[1:06:48] groom we got some work to do why am I
[1:06:51] here let's refocus why are we here to
[1:06:54] tear down the works of the enemy and
[1:06:56] you're not going to do it without
[1:06:57] battles you don't win victories without
[1:07:00] battles so instead of griping and
[1:07:02] getting down and getting upset I look I
[1:07:05] know sickness ain't fun I've been there
[1:07:07] trouble in the home ain't fun I've been
[1:07:09] there those things ain't fun but we got
[1:07:11] to start looking at them as an
[1:07:13] opportunity for the word to be manifest
[1:07:15] in our bodies an opportunity to dare to
[1:07:18] tear Satan's kingdom now you dare come
[1:07:20] into my home you dare attack my daddy
[1:07:22] you dare attack my pastor you dare tear
[1:07:25] up the peace in my home this is an
[1:07:27] opportunity for me to take the word put
[1:07:29] it on my lips it'll be the same as deity
[1:07:32] speaking and what happened when you face
[1:07:34] the groom is the same thing that's going
[1:07:36] to happen when you face this bride
[1:07:39] it's an opportunity for victory
[1:07:43] you never won a game you didn't play
[1:07:48] you never won a battle you didn't fight
[1:07:53] and I'm gonna tell you if every devil is
[1:07:55] going to be under our feet collectively
[1:07:58] think about this now
[1:08:00] then every demon even the most perverse
[1:08:03] ones
[1:08:04] are gonna come against people of this
[1:08:06] bride and be overcome by them
[1:08:10] in order for every demon to be conquered
[1:08:12] somebody's got to conquer it
[1:08:15] these are not characterless events
[1:08:18] we look at it so well the bride's going
[1:08:20] to overcome and the bride's going to
[1:08:22] Rapture and somebody's gonna yeah
[1:08:25] but we got to quit looking out there for
[1:08:27] fulfillment
[1:08:28] and saying what is it I am to fulfill
[1:08:31] what part am I supposed to fulfill
[1:08:34] because it's not just somebody it's you
[1:08:38] you have a part to fulfill amen
[1:08:41] we're at war with the Devil that's our
[1:08:44] purpose
[1:08:46] we're at war with the devil and we are
[1:08:48] on the front lines
[1:08:49] and this just this isn't just any battle

[1:14:39] Army here
[1:14:42] for one final offensive
[1:14:44] one final push
[1:14:47] one final attack
[1:14:49] an offensive is a military operation
[1:14:53] that seeks through an aggressive
[1:14:55] projection of armed forces to occupy
[1:14:58] territory
[1:15:00] or gain an objective
[1:15:02] or achieve some larger strategic goal
[1:15:05] designed with one purpose in mind
[1:15:08] to defeat you
[1:15:11] he's got one more offensive
[1:15:13] every enemy troop is masked in this age
[1:15:16] every one of them's gathered in laodicea
[1:15:19] for you
[1:15:23] but let me tell you tonight
[1:15:25] they're not being gathered for your
[1:15:27] destruction
[1:15:29] they're being gathered
[1:15:31] for their destruction
[1:15:33] oh all the Pharaoh's Army came down
[1:15:36] there and they thought it was for the
[1:15:37] destruction of Israel but the Red Sea
[1:15:40] wasn't for Israel's destruction it was
[1:15:42] for Pharaoh's destruction and Satan has
[1:15:45] loosed all his forces down here in this
[1:15:47] day and they're gathering around and
[1:15:48] they're laughing and they're sneering
[1:15:50] and they're coming closer and closer and
[1:15:52] God's look at going yep he fell for it
[1:15:55] again he's brought them all into one
[1:15:57] place again so we're going to wipe them

[1:16:09] that we're coming to it is the
[1:16:11] destruction of the enemy it is the
[1:16:13] destruction of cancer it is the
[1:16:15] destruction of anxiety it is the
[1:16:17] destruction of depression that suicide
[1:16:19] spirit is not going to destroy you you
[1:16:22] are going to overcome it and it will be
[1:16:24] the destruction of suicide his Army's
[1:16:27] all in one place easy target
[1:16:30] it will be the destruction of Satan and
[1:16:33] his forces
[1:16:36] they've all gathered in this age and
[1:16:37] there's never been a more unbelieving
[1:16:39] age
[1:16:40] than the age we live in now
[1:16:43] just speaking of America
[1:16:46] I saw a statistics at 163 million
[1:16:48] Americans do not attend church
[1:16:52] of any kind
[1:16:54] 163 million
[1:16:58] this is the age of doubt and unbelief
[1:17:01] brother Brown told us that unbelief is
[1:17:04] the most horrible thing that there is in
[1:17:05] the world
[1:17:07] he said the greatest devil the chief of
[1:17:09] all devils
[1:17:11] is unbelief
[1:17:12] the chief of all Devils has infiltrated
[1:17:16] this age through schools
[1:17:18] through entertainment
[1:17:20] through the news and worst of all
[1:17:23] through religion
[1:17:25] the chief of all Devils infiltrated
[1:17:28] through religion Satan has taken 6 000
[1:17:32] years since the fall of Man to study
[1:17:33] your weaknesses
[1:17:35] he knows us better than we know
[1:17:37] ourselves
[1:17:38] he is poked and he is prodded
[1:17:40] and he has brought his whole Army here
[1:17:42] and set it in a ray for the battle
[1:17:45] 200 million demons released from the
[1:17:48] river Euphrates
[1:17:49] and you
[1:17:51] are the target
[1:17:53] think about it they have purpose within
[1:17:56] themselves that you will not rapture
[1:17:58] that you will not be victorious
[1:18:01] that you will not have peace you will
[1:18:02] not have joy that you will not overcome
[1:18:06] and they have created an Eden of hell
[1:18:08] here upon the Earth
[1:18:10] I read some of these things
[1:18:12] it says anxiety disorders are the most
[1:18:14] common mental illness in the United
[1:18:16] States affecting 40 million adults
[1:18:20] think about it what we talk about at the
[1:18:22] beginning Banks collapsing
[1:18:24] foundation's shaking
[1:18:26] jobs
[1:18:28] economies Wars if that's where our hope
[1:18:31] laid I'd probably be peeled up like one
[1:18:33] of them people too
[1:18:36] listen them people ain't trying to be
[1:18:37] pillhead them people are looking for
[1:18:39] peace
[1:18:40] I understand it's real battles I
[1:18:42] understand anxiety is real if that's
[1:18:43] something you struggle with I ain't
[1:18:44] knocking that you can be delivered from
[1:18:46] it
[1:18:48] there's one in the house that'll deliver
[1:18:50] you from that tonight I understand
[1:18:52] depression is a real thing I've fought
[1:18:54] that demon it's very real but you can be
[1:18:57] delivered from it
[1:18:58] you don't have to walk around bound down
[1:19:00] by Thing by that thing held down living
[1:19:02] below your privileges
[1:19:04] there's there's there there's a freedom
[1:19:05] in the house of God that'll loose you
[1:19:07] tonight you'll never have to carry that
[1:19:08] burden again
[1:19:10] we don't downplay those things and act
[1:19:12] like that they're no big deal they are a
[1:19:14] big deal
[1:19:15] they're real and 40 million Americans
[1:19:17] struggle with anxiety
[1:19:19] 18 of the entire population is on
[1:19:23] anxiety medication
[1:19:26] 17.3 million Americans yearly struggle
[1:19:29] with depression
[1:19:30] one person every 40 seconds in this
[1:19:33] country commits suicide
[1:19:36] it is the second leading cause of death
[1:19:38] amongst teenagers
[1:19:42] 40 million Americans say they regularly
[1:19:45] visit pornography sites
[1:19:47] one in every five mobile phone searches
[1:19:50] is for pornography
[1:19:53] Aaron my kid don't struggle with that
[1:19:57] get your head out of the sand
[1:20:00] and recognize the attack that's coming
[1:20:02] against your children
[1:20:09] four percent
[1:20:11] of Christian men
[1:20:14] and 15 percent of Christian women say
[1:20:18] they watch pornography at least once a
[1:20:20] month
[1:20:22] thank you
[1:20:24] this is the most unbelieving age
[1:20:28] that has ever been it is the most sinful
[1:20:31] age that the world has ever seen when
[1:20:34] those statistics are being pulled from
[1:20:36] the so-called Christian world
[1:20:38] think about that
[1:20:40] but that's what happens to the Christian
[1:20:42] world when you don't hold the line
[1:20:45] when you give a little bit when you give
[1:20:48] a little bit of ground listen it's a
[1:20:50] bottomless pit it's a slippery slope so
[1:20:53] these discussions on well why does this
[1:20:54] little thing here matter and why does
[1:20:56] that little thing there matter because
[1:20:58] we're instructed in the word not to move
[1:21:00] the boundary stones
[1:21:01] he set the boundaries for a reason if he
[1:21:04] put the boundary there it matters if
[1:21:06] it's in the word it matters and when you
[1:21:08] start moving it a little bit listen the
[1:21:09] enemy ain't just after your joy the
[1:21:12] enemy ain't just after your peace those
[1:21:13] are just little places he's nibbling
[1:21:15] trying to get a foothold but he's after
[1:21:17] your family he's after your soul he's
[1:21:19] after all of it so I say he can't have
[1:21:22] none of it listen why we want to wait
[1:21:24] till he gets inside the house to do
[1:21:26] something about it I say if he steps on
[1:21:28] your property get the double barrel
[1:21:30] shotgun out and get out there and blast
[1:21:32] him out of there quit wait until he gets
[1:21:34] in the bedroom quit wait until he gets
[1:21:36] in the house deal with it now deal with
[1:21:39] it tonight stand out and say I will
[1:21:41] fight you're not taking my kids you're
[1:21:44] not taking my joy you can't have my
[1:21:46] marriage you can't have my victory deal
[1:21:49] with the thing fight for it fight for it
[1:21:52] it's worth fighting for your children
[1:21:55] are worth it your marriage is worth it
[1:21:57] your soul is worth it
[1:22:04] fight for it
[1:22:09] it's what happens when you don't hold
[1:22:10] the line
[1:22:14] it's what happens when you give a little
[1:22:15] ground
[1:22:16] you end up the cage of every unclean and
[1:22:18] hateful bird
[1:22:21] but in the midst of that unbelieving age
[1:22:24] in the midst of all that stuff we just
[1:22:26] read
[1:22:27] there is a people standing for truth
[1:22:29] there is a people standing for the faith
[1:22:31] and they're not just standing for a part
[1:22:33] of it they're not just standing for a
[1:22:35] little bit they're saying give me my
[1:22:37] mountain
[1:22:38] give me all of it I believe all of it
[1:22:41] from the beginning to the end you can't
[1:22:42] just hand pick I like this and I don't
[1:22:44] like that there's a people standing for
[1:22:46] all the words tonight amen all of it
[1:22:49] they believe in the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:51] Ghost they believe in the moving of the
[1:22:53] spirit they believe in the Supernatural
[1:22:56] they believe in living under the token
[1:22:58] men God called men and women who stand
[1:23:01] for truth that stand for all of it
[1:23:04] why because they've been turned back by
[1:23:06] the message of the hour turn back to the
[1:23:09] original
[1:23:09] and they say
[1:23:12] this is good ground

[1:25:20] anointing of a man I saw another Mighty

[1:25:40] Satan down you're anointed to Rapture
[1:25:42] that's what your anointing is in this
[1:25:44] day you have been anointed to hold the
[1:25:47] line when nobody else could when
[1:25:49] denominations have fallen away when this
[1:25:51] one's run and that one's run when
[1:25:53] websites are making people flee I look
[1:25:56] around and I say we're still holding the
[1:25:58] line I still got Brothers on this side
[1:26:00] sisters on that side and we're still
[1:26:02] here fighting
[1:26:07] you know in a battle there's times where
[1:26:09] the enemy goes on the offensive to take
[1:26:11] the position that you hold
[1:26:14] to take what you already possess
[1:26:18] and in those situations you must hold
[1:26:20] the line and what does it mean to hold
[1:26:22] the line it's to Hold Your Position in
[1:26:24] the face of the enemy
[1:26:26] to hold against an offensive meant to
[1:26:28] break you
[1:26:29] to hold the line you must be
[1:26:31] uncompromising
[1:26:33] unrelenting and unyielding on the
[1:26:36] promises that God has given you
[1:26:38] and that's what's going on in this day
[1:26:40] is Satan has come to challenge our
[1:26:42] position
[1:26:43] to challenge our position and and what
[1:26:46] Satan has done in this day is a sort of
[1:26:48] what's known as a blitz Creek
[1:26:51] he has masked all his troops and he's
[1:26:53] attempting a shock in all technique
[1:26:56] to get you fearful and to make you move
[1:26:58] from your position
[1:27:00] and a blitzkrieg was a technique that
[1:27:02] Hitler would use during World War II it
[1:27:04] means lightning war in German
[1:27:07] and it was the it was it was fast
[1:27:10] powerful strikes where the Germans would
[1:27:12] use tanks and artillery and swiftly
[1:27:14] strike at your lines through an
[1:27:16] overwhelming Force to break through
[1:27:18] and it would seemingly come out of
[1:27:20] nowhere
[1:27:21] everything would be calm and quiet the
[1:27:23] battle seemed to be died down and all of
[1:27:25] a sudden a blitz Cree all their tanks
[1:27:27] all their artillery all their men all of
[1:27:29] it in one spot and it would hit you with
[1:27:31] the full attack whenever you weren't
[1:27:33] prepared
[1:27:34] and even if you were prepared it seemed
[1:27:36] impossible to withstand and during this
[1:27:39] time period Nations crumbled before
[1:27:41] Hitler and his military in the early
[1:27:43] years of World War II as he ran rough
[1:27:45] shot all through Europe fear gripped the
[1:27:48] world
[1:27:48] people literally had came to accept and
[1:27:51] believe that Hitler was going to control
[1:27:53] the entire world could anyone stand up
[1:27:56] to Germany in this Blitzkrieg machine
[1:27:59] and as the war though as it began to
[1:28:01] drag on into late 1944
[1:28:03] the tide of War had actually shifted
[1:28:06] and seen and things began to favor the
[1:28:08] allies and Hitler's invasion of Russia
[1:28:10] had bogged down
[1:28:12] he had been turned back in North Africa
[1:28:14] and the Allies figured that the
[1:28:16] surrender of Nazi Germany was very near
[1:28:19] the ending had become clear and it
[1:28:23] seemed as if Hitler would recognize this
[1:28:25] as well but instead of surrendering what
[1:28:27] Hitler did is he prepared one final
[1:28:30] offensive
[1:28:31] and it sounds exactly like the day that
[1:28:33] we're living in
[1:28:34] a message came in power and
[1:28:36] demonstration
[1:28:38] night after night Satan was defeated the
[1:28:40] bride was called out and we're marching
[1:28:43] you know more each and every day tearing
[1:28:45] down his kingdom the Rapture is at hand
[1:28:47] it seems like the writings on the wall
[1:28:48] brother Matt it's all almost over
[1:28:51] the writing's on the wall right we're
[1:28:52] going to win how many believes that
[1:28:54] we've seen the back of the book we're
[1:28:56] going to win the writings on the wall
[1:28:58] and it seems like Satan would recognize
[1:28:59] that as well
[1:29:02] but instead
[1:29:04] Satan mounts one final offensive
[1:29:07] listen it's in the closing hours of War
[1:29:12] it's in the I read a thing the other day
[1:29:14] that said on major construction projects
[1:29:16] they'll go years without an accident
[1:29:19] and in the closing days they'll have a
[1:29:22] major accident or fatality because
[1:29:24] people let their guard down
[1:29:26] oh we did it
[1:29:28] oh we made it man the raptures at hand
[1:29:30] we've defeated him it's over I mean I
[1:29:33] mean look at the the there is a spoken
[1:29:35] word bride upon the face of the Earth
[1:29:37] how incredible the message has been
[1:29:39] successful we're called out it's
[1:29:41] finished brother Andrew
[1:29:43] and that relaxing moment he's massing
[1:29:46] his forces
[1:29:47] he listen
[1:29:49] victories I hate to tell you this don't
[1:29:50] lead to less fighting
[1:29:55] victories lead to more fighting
[1:29:58] because the minute you take something
[1:30:00] you're gonna have to fight harder to
[1:30:03] hold it than you did to get it
[1:30:07] and the minute you take something from
[1:30:09] the enemy he's going to amass his forces
[1:30:10] and he's coming back stronger than ever
[1:30:13] you're going to have to fight to hold it
[1:30:15] everything you take you got to be ready
[1:30:18] to defend
[1:30:19] listen tonight don't let him steal your
[1:30:21] Victory don't let him steal your healing
[1:30:24] don't let him steal your joy I got joy
[1:30:26] tonight don't let him steal it I got
[1:30:28] peace tonight don't let him steal it I
[1:30:30] got victory in my heart don't let him
[1:30:32] steal it don't let the fire die out keep
[1:30:35] the fire burning Throw Another Log on
[1:30:37] the Fire tonight protect it be ready to
[1:30:39] fight
[1:30:40] because I'm telling you he's coming you
[1:30:42] got to hold on with all your heart
[1:30:44] Revelation 2 25 says but that which you
[1:30:47] already that you have already
[1:30:51] hold fast till I come
[1:30:53] he said you already got it but you
[1:30:55] better hold on to it
[1:30:56] you better protect it you better be
[1:30:58] ready don't let the fire die
[1:31:01] because Satan's mounting one final
[1:31:03] offensive against the bride around the
[1:31:05] world and
[1:31:07] they'll forgive me for a little bit of
[1:31:08] History I tend to like it
[1:31:11] Hitler believed that Germany had one
[1:31:13] last chance to strike at the heart of
[1:31:15] the Allies in the West
[1:31:17] Hitler ordered his commanders to prepare
[1:31:19] an all-out offensive against a strategic
[1:31:21] soft spot in the Allied line located in
[1:31:25] the densely forested region known as the
[1:31:27] ardanes
[1:31:29] the result would be
[1:31:31] the largest military battle in American
[1:31:34] history
[1:31:36] we call it today the Battle of the Bulge
[1:31:39] but if we're speaking spiritually
[1:31:41] it's the greatest battle ever fought
[1:31:44] even though victories at hand and even
[1:31:46] though we can see the Finish Line the
[1:31:48] enemy's making one final push and I ask
[1:31:51] you tonight are you ready for it
[1:31:55] is the token applied
[1:31:57] or their sacrifice being made per
[1:31:59] Adventure
[1:32:01] are you praying for your kids are you
[1:32:03] guarding the door of your home in the
[1:32:05] door of your heart because I'm telling
[1:32:07] you he's got a Punch coming
[1:32:09] he's gonna throw a punch at you he's
[1:32:12] gonna attack you when you least expect
[1:32:14] it you got to be ready for it because
[1:32:15] he's building up this offensive
[1:32:18] in the ordined region was known to
[1:32:20] American GIS think about this now listen
[1:32:22] to American soldiers as the honeymoon
[1:32:25] sector
[1:32:26] because it's where you went when you
[1:32:28] were battle fatigued to rest
[1:32:31] it's where they sent people to relax
[1:32:33] it's where they sent green soldiers to
[1:32:35] kind of get used to how things went on a
[1:32:38] day-to-day basis because no fighting
[1:32:40] ever happened there
[1:32:41] it was a relaxing place where they
[1:32:44] leased
[1:32:45] expected it when they least expected it
[1:32:49] listen if you don't think you can get
[1:32:51] hit out of left field with something you
[1:32:54] didn't see coming
[1:32:57] listen everything can be fine and the
[1:32:59] word cancer can spin your head around
[1:33:00] like that
[1:33:02] it can be just a normal Tuesday and
[1:33:04] everything's good or a normal Thursday
[1:33:06] and everything's good then all of a
[1:33:07] sudden out of left field you get hit
[1:33:09] with a blitzkrieg and your life is
[1:33:11] turned upside down in one moment's time
[1:33:14] your whole life can be turned upside
[1:33:16] down but I'm Not Gonna Leave You There
[1:33:17] hanging upside down One Moment In The
[1:33:20] Presence of the king one moment in his
[1:33:22] present a lifetime of sin can be wiped
[1:33:24] out a battle of sickness can be wiped
[1:33:27] out depression can be wiped out you can
[1:33:29] be changed forever with one encounter
[1:33:31] with one moment one time in his present
[1:33:34] it can be in a cabin it could be a youth
[1:33:36] camp and it'll have you running all over
[1:33:38] the place saying I'll never be the same
[1:33:40] I'll never be the same because One
[1:33:43] Moment In His presence sure the enemy
[1:33:45] can hit you in a moment it can do a lot
[1:33:47] of damage how frustrating it must be to
[1:33:49] the devil he can be after you for years
[1:33:51] and years and years he can put 30 years
[1:33:53] into your life 40 years into your life
[1:33:55] drugs alcohol drinking sex sins year
[1:33:58] after year after year after year after
[1:34:00] year one moment gone one moment erased
[1:34:04] one moment filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:06] sealed saved finished over what are you
[1:34:09] fighting tonight what are your balance
[1:34:11] tonight where you at tonight One Moment
[1:34:14] One Moment just step into that presence
[1:34:17] tonight for one moment and it'll be
[1:34:19] finished
[1:34:21] One Moment In His presence
[1:34:31] so on the morning of December 16th
[1:34:35] with a thick Mist blanketing the
[1:34:37] mountains
[1:34:39] a German fighting force numbering 200
[1:34:42] 000 men
[1:34:44] and one thousand tanks
[1:34:46] launched an all-out attack on the
[1:34:48] unsuspecting Allied veterans
[1:34:52] they would describe eerie
[1:34:54] red and purple light streaking through
[1:34:56] the fog
[1:34:57] followed by the bone chilling sound of
[1:34:59] what they called screaming memes
[1:35:02] Rockets
[1:35:03] and earth-shattering detonation
[1:35:06] in every direction
[1:35:08] everything's good in my life brother
[1:35:10] Aaron
[1:35:11] everything's good
[1:35:13] and then Tuesday comes
[1:35:16] in every direction
[1:35:18] in every direction we think we're
[1:35:20] prepared
[1:35:21] oh I'm ready for anything
[1:35:23] well quoting the great Wordsmith
[1:35:27] Mike Tyson
[1:35:34] he said everybody's got a plan
[1:35:36] until they get punched in the mouth
[1:35:41] everybody's got a plan
[1:35:43] until they get punched in the mouth
[1:35:46] you better have a plan to fall into
[1:35:48] Jesus you better have a plan to put on
[1:35:50] the whole armor of God you better have a
[1:35:52] plan to run into that strong tower
[1:35:54] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:35:55] save you when these things hit you
[1:35:57] oh yeah I got a plan but what are you
[1:35:59] going to do when the bullets start
[1:36:00] flying and the airs start piercing and
[1:36:02] and this one Falls away and Dad Falls
[1:36:04] away and Mom Falls away and a thousand
[1:36:06] falls on the left and ten thousand falls
[1:36:08] on the right when you can't see anything
[1:36:10] and it's fogging in the middle of the
[1:36:12] forest and there's Rockets blowing up

[1:38:55] future that trial is still there
[1:38:58] he wants you to think about in the
[1:39:00] future I'm still sick

[1:39:20] quit letting temporary things affect
[1:39:23] Eternal decisions
[1:39:24] he is not in my future
[1:39:26] he is nowhere in my future
[1:39:32] it's a good land to make our stand on
[1:39:34] Church
[1:39:36] it seems that the time as time goes on
[1:39:39] there's less and less people
[1:39:40] willing to stand for all of it
[1:39:43] they'll stand for their favorite part
[1:39:46] they'll stand for their favorite
[1:39:47] Doctrine or their you know their
[1:39:49] favorite part about Holiness or some
[1:39:51] little thing that can allow them to lead
[1:39:53] into legalism or too much or they'll
[1:39:56] find a peace they like and they'll stand
[1:39:57] for that
[1:39:59] it seems actually today the further we
[1:40:01] go along people tell you more about what
[1:40:02] they stand against and what they stand
[1:40:04] for
[1:40:06] I believe we're a people that stand for
[1:40:08] things
[1:40:12] I want to stand for all of it anymore
[1:40:13] but somebody has to stand for all of it
[1:40:15] and when you stand for all of it it
[1:40:17] means a constant battle because you're
[1:40:18] always going to be attacked on every
[1:40:20] flank there's going to be an attack here
[1:40:22] and then there's going to be attack here
[1:40:23] because you're standing for the whole
[1:40:24] thing and so it creates a front it
[1:40:27] creates a place where you're easily
[1:40:28] attacked and the minute you hold back

[1:42:54] selfish relationship he comes and he
[1:42:56] gives the word and he gives the word and
[1:42:58] he gives the word and then we get up and
[1:42:59] walk out and he's going

[1:44:25] attack on the land that has been
[1:44:27] restored to me
[1:44:32] and by the one that gets me is somehow
[1:44:34] you you imply that because we let the
[1:44:36] spirit have free reign in the service
[1:44:38] that somehow the word has been put aside
[1:44:41] and it isn't given the preeminence
[1:44:43] maybe you don't understand why I'm so
[1:44:46] excited
[1:44:47] brother Aaron the seals are open that's
[1:44:49] why I'm excited the word is restored

[1:45:09] we're shouting
[1:45:13] yeah
[1:45:14] this is a line that we must hold
[1:45:18] it's a line that we must I'm not willing
[1:45:20] to give one inch of the supernatural
[1:45:21] back

[1:45:36] back it's been restored and I'll stand
[1:45:39] on it I'll fight for it hey in my
[1:45:41] opinion a restored word deserves
[1:45:43] restored worship and original word
[1:45:46] deserves original worship how's that the
[1:45:49] way they did it on the day of Pentecost
[1:45:51] when they Spilled Out into the street
[1:45:53] and they said these men are drunk
[1:45:55] original word original worship
[1:45:57] restoration of the whole thing

[1:46:37] sister gets free and gets to shouting
[1:46:40] screaming or brother gets free
[1:46:42] gets to shouting dancing puts me in mind
[1:46:45] of War
[1:46:49] makes me think about the Rebel Yell
[1:46:56] listen
[1:46:59] this whole Union soldier said one time
[1:47:04] he said one time if you heard the Rebel
[1:47:06] Yell and you said you wasn't scared you
[1:47:08] never heard it
[1:47:13] hang on with me for a minute though
[1:47:16] he said it wasn't the yell
[1:47:18] is because we knew what was coming
[1:47:20] behind it
[1:47:22] say what do you think it sounds like
[1:47:23] down in hell when people get loose and
[1:47:26] somebody shouts the victory it ain't the
[1:47:28] shout they know what's coming they know
[1:47:30] what's coming we're coming we're coming
[1:47:33] to take it back oh it ain't the shout
[1:47:36] they know we're coming they got death on
[1:47:39] their hands there's freedom in the house
[1:47:41] of God they can't hold us they can't
[1:47:44] stop us they can't move us back in Edge

[1:47:50] our land it's our healing it's our
[1:47:52] Victory it's my Rapture it's my family
[1:47:55] I'm coming whoa oh I'm coming
[1:48:01] Hallelujah
[1:48:06] and if one of those Devils said they
[1:48:08] heard it and didn't get scared they must
[1:48:11] not have heard it I say let them hear
[1:48:13] you in hell tonight we're coming
[1:48:21] Hallelujah
[1:48:24] Hallelujah
[1:48:26] Hallelujah
[1:48:31] [Applause]
[1:48:49] you give me five minutes
[1:48:52] and we'll wrap this up
[1:48:54] because we're still in the middle of the
[1:48:55] Battle of the Bulge
[1:48:57] you can't leave history undone
[1:49:03] the attack was on
[1:49:06] and America wasn't ready for it
[1:49:09] two regiments
[1:49:11] of the 106th division
[1:49:13] were quickly surrounded by German
[1:49:15] infantry
[1:49:17] leading to the single largest field
[1:49:19] surrender
[1:49:20] of Allied troops in World War II
[1:49:23] more than 6 800 American soldiers
[1:49:26] were taken prisoners
[1:49:28] 84 American prisoners were
[1:49:31] executed by German SS in the largest
[1:49:34] mass execution of American soldiers in
[1:49:36] the war
[1:49:38] can't surrender
[1:49:41] I don't care where you're at tonight
[1:49:44] brother and I've tried and I failed
[1:49:47] I sought God and I didn't get nowhere
[1:49:50] I tried to give up these habits
[1:49:53] I'm just gonna quit he'll kill you
[1:49:59] no matter where you're at no matter how
[1:50:01] hopeless it looks
[1:50:03] listen help's on the way
[1:50:06] they'll surrender
[1:50:08] surrender is not an option you'll never
[1:50:10] gain Peace by making deals with the
[1:50:13] Devil
[1:50:14] Israel will never have peace with
[1:50:15] Palestine by giving them their land
[1:50:17] they want to destroy Israel they ain't
[1:50:19] worried about getting their land they
[1:50:21] want them wiped out
[1:50:22] every little thing you give him is just
[1:50:24] a foothold
[1:50:26] and if you surrender anything he'll
[1:50:27] destroy you with it
[1:50:29] just 24 hours after the initial
[1:50:31] bombardment German tanks had broken
[1:50:34] through the thinly defended center of
[1:50:36] the ordained region rolled West to the
[1:50:38] Muse River creating the infamous bulge
[1:50:40] in the Allied line that gave the battle
[1:50:42] its name
[1:50:43] using the weather and the intelligence
[1:50:45] breakdowns to their advantage the Nazi
[1:50:47] offensive appeared to be working
[1:50:49] in church if we take a minute and look
[1:50:51] around
[1:50:52] I'd say the blitz Krieg
[1:50:54] the devil appears to be working
[1:50:56] destroyed Society
[1:50:59] just in a matter of listen this world
[1:51:01] ain't where it was 10 years ago
[1:51:03] it has been hit with the Blitzkrieg and
[1:51:05] it's falling apart
[1:51:07] and how many people is working
[1:51:10] and the world stood there with baited
[1:51:12] breath
[1:51:13] they thought Hitler was about to roll
[1:51:15] right through the allies
[1:51:17] and everybody thought this would be
[1:51:18] Hitler's greatest victory
[1:51:20] there was a few Americans in that Forest
[1:51:23] the 101st Airborne
[1:51:26] there was a little bitty group
[1:51:27] determined
[1:51:29] we won't surrender
[1:51:31] no matter what
[1:51:32] we won't surrender
[1:51:34] and if Hitler thought that the outmanned
[1:51:36] Americans were going to lay down and let
[1:51:38] the German tanks roll all the way
[1:51:39] through to Antwerp he was sadly mistaken
[1:51:42] in the middle of it all at a place
[1:51:43] called bastogne
[1:51:45] the 101st Airborne was pinned down and
[1:51:47] surrounded by not not the Infantry for
[1:51:49] five days
[1:51:50] now listen to this we talk about
[1:51:51] circumstance we talk about symptoms
[1:51:54] here's where they were at
[1:51:55] they dug trenches in a wide peripheral
[1:51:57] perimeter around by Stone they had no
[1:51:59] warm clothes they were in summer clothes
[1:52:02] look
[1:52:03] they ran out of rations
[1:52:05] they've been shot to Pieces the
[1:52:07] temperature at night was negative four
[1:52:09] degrees below zero
[1:52:11] soldiers were crippled by frostbite and
[1:52:13] trench foot Medics had no supplies so
[1:52:16] they did amputations with kitchen knives
[1:52:18] with no anesthesia
[1:52:21] when things look worse for the Americans
[1:52:23] here we go
[1:52:25] when things looked worse for the
[1:52:27] Americans the Nazi field commander
[1:52:28] issued an official call for surrender
[1:52:32] I'll read it to you
[1:52:34] just a small portion of it
[1:52:36] says there is only one possibility to
[1:52:38] save the encircled USA troops from Total
[1:52:42] Annihilation and as I'm reading this
[1:52:44] just hear the devil talking like this
[1:52:47] that is The Honorable surrender of the
[1:52:50] encircled town in order to think it over
[1:52:52] a term of two hours will be granted
[1:52:55] beginning with the presentation of this
[1:52:57] note
[1:52:58] if this proposal should be rejected one
[1:53:01] German artillery corpse and six heavy
[1:53:04] battalions are ready to annihilate the
[1:53:06] USA troops in and nearby Stone
[1:53:10] the order for firing will be given
[1:53:12] immediately after this two-hour term
[1:53:20] you got to have men that ain't afraid
[1:53:23] you got to have men that ain't rattled
[1:53:25] and shook
[1:53:28] they said that the men
[1:53:31] sit there and stare at the general and
[1:53:32] waiting to see what his response would
[1:53:33] be
[1:53:38] so he took that note and he crumpled it
[1:53:40] up
[1:53:42] do it in the trash
[1:53:44] and scribbled
[1:53:46] one of the most famously blunt Bluffs in
[1:53:49] the history of warfare
[1:53:52] sent it back to the Germans
[1:53:54] and he opened it up and it had one word
[1:53:57] he said
[1:53:59] nuts
[1:54:01] you think we're about to surrender to
[1:54:03] you
[1:54:04] nuts

[1:55:33] can't help you I'll have to forgive me
[1:55:34] about Stonewall Jackson
[1:55:38] in the very first battle the union just
[1:55:40] shelling
[1:55:41] and the confederacy's falling apart and
[1:55:43] they're fleeing
[1:55:47] there was a general there I believe his
[1:55:49] last name was B
[1:55:50] and he robbed his horse up to
[1:55:53] Stonewall Jackson he says we're being
[1:55:54] whipped we're being pushed back
[1:55:57] you know Jackson being the not running
[1:56:00] type
[1:56:01] he didn't say well boys we better we
[1:56:03] better skin out
[1:56:04] we better get out of here
[1:56:06] his response was then I'll give him the
[1:56:08] bayonet
[1:56:10] he says we'll stay so B runs and ride
[1:56:14] this horse back to his men to try to
[1:56:15] rally him
[1:56:16] and y'all know the famous line I'll
[1:56:18] probably butcher it but he says rally
[1:56:20] he says
[1:56:22] he says let us
[1:56:24] determine within our hearts to die here
[1:56:26] today
[1:56:26] and we'll be victorious he said look
[1:56:28] there stands Jackson like a Stonewall
[1:56:31] he says rally
[1:56:33] on the Virginians
