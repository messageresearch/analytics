here before I make any other comments tonight and we'll just make some comments later but let's go to Joshua chapter five and we'll read from verse two Joshua chapter five and verse two so appreciated the word the Lord last night and we're hungry and we shall be filled a man I believe that God has something for us and then his promises are true a man and he has this the food that we new need to in due season Joshua chapter five and verse two we're going to just pick up where you left off last night brother Wayne Amen at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again to children of Israel the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcise the children of Israel at the heel of the foreskins and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised for the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord and to whom the Lord swear that he would not show them the lamb which the Lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk in honey and their children whom he had raised up in their stead them Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass and when they had done circumcise in all the people that they abode in their places till they were home and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you give me verse 10 if you will please there and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month even in the plains of Jericho verse 11 and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover unleavened cakes and parts corn in the self-same day god bless you you can be seated Amen in it great to be in a brand meeting tonight [Applause] in the pranam meeting when I was a boy there's Branham meeting you could hardly get a seat in the building people drove for hours to be there and got there early to get in their building this is a Branham meeting we're preaching the same message amen the same glorious message Amen certainly good to be here I was just want to say I appreciate brother run Spencer and all the church here and then the Spencer family everybody that has made us so welcome and gave him us such wonderful hospitality whom we always appreciate being back together with friends again and loving the Lord together and serving him together and that's what we're that's what this is all about amen and we have come to see Jesus tonight and we're looking to him tonight just to speak to our hearts and reveal himself to us I just wanted to make mention you know we saw just a little bit of the discernment line at the beginning of the service and I was 16 years old when I might not even been 16 yet but I was just a young preacher boy when they they got that film the Deep Ecology the deep I saw it for my first time it was in the church service hit you know it's old impacted in my life and I had a dear friend of mine at that time that was a close friend brother George liquors who went on to be with the Lord in a situation back in 1980 but in this time he had a young daughter and every time they would you know as they visited us in our home this baby had a an able ruptured navel that stuck out about like this and the mother is a little bit embarrassed by it and would sit holding the baby by the stomach like this and would hold that navel in but every time she moved her hand it would pop back out again and they showed this brother and his family were from Alabama and they showed us this film that he called us to the deep in their church the little girl was about two years old and you know so they just had a wonderful meeting rejoicing you know as it crescendos at the end we didn't show that but you know may there be a great revival break out in in your area was a was the the prayer hand down and so you know just ended with a great crescendo and so as they walk back into their home that that night with a little baby and the mother's arm and you see carried it she walked by the Huffman's head of Christ and the baby stopped her only two years old now could barely talk stopped her and says mama that man and pointed to the picture of the hoffmans head of Christ and she pulled up her skirt and said that man look and her neighbor was totally healed hallelujah I just wonder who she saw in that meeting that man he wasn't brother branham that man pointing to Jesus amen when Jesus comes ever tempters power is broken I'll tell you he's here tonight and then because he made a promise he would be here I want to thank you for your for for you know each one of you I have here with us I think there's about thirty three of us from meeting in light tabernacle that drove the thousand fifty miles that come to be here with you this year and I'm honored to have the folks from the church we all just stand here wherever you are throughout the building here and then I'm just really happy to have you here with us god bless you thank you thank you man appreciate you coming and being a part of this meeting and for the last seven years we have been here and been apart with you in these meetings so it's just just a joy to be back together again amen so you know they they wanted to come this year and be a part of the meetings so we're just happy for all of them to come my wife and and my son here the Timothy and my my son-in-law brother Aaron of ministers and they their wives and families are here so we're just really happy for each one of you that has come together amen well we come from the east and the West amen we've come to meet with the King to dine and his guests I heard you I heard you prayin for brother Kenneth Middleton while ago and the other service just wanted to mention I'm a you know appreciation for you pray and brother Kenneth was a young man he was a Christian but he fell away in the sin and he's strayed away from God and many years later he would come back to God a broken I'm crippled wheelchair-bound unable to walk without a walker because of his terrible sin Laden past he struggled with believing he could be forgiven and you know it one day he was sitting by his phone and you know while being home alone even he he had a little place by it the telephones long before mobile phones were around and he was praying just done the Lord said Lord you know I love you and you know that but I would just like to hear you say I love you and he you know he sighed and got up from on a walker and painfully struggled to the refrigerator or somewhere there to to refill his mug with tea and he walked and scooted the mug around the kitchen counter as he walked around praying the same prayer over and over again lord I love you and you know that but would you could I just like to hear you say that you love me could you do it please just this once just let let me hear from you that you love me how many kind of feel that way sometime you know you love the Lord but you just like to hear him say I love you and you know so he painfully pushed his muggle around the counter back to his chair and he was praying as he went and reaching the chair he sat down and and finished his prayer and said a man and reached to get a drink of the tea or whatever he had got in the phone rang and I was in my barn during the morning chores and the voice of the Lord spoke to me and said go and call Kenneth and tell him these words I love you quickly I ran to the phone and and made the call as a Kenneth I don't know what this is all about but God just spoke to me and told me to say these words to you I love you brother Kenneth begins shouting he had a revival filled with assurance that God indeed did love him amen now that was quite some years ago he's much older now been through a lot and yet he still continues with an unfailing faith and the love of God life hasn't been easy for him he's had done 30 stents in his heart six balloon procedures several heart attacks his heart was only operating thirty to thirty-five percent plus he's been fighting cancer in his body for the past several years it was last just before our fall meetings that your pastor brother Ron comes to and ministered to us he was on his deathbed and the doctor called her the family in and told him this is it and I was preaching on the the power of the sons of God and and being adopted as sons of God knowing our position in Christ and speak in the word I walked in there in that hospital with the ministry from the church and I said now brother Kenneth it's time for you just to ask what you will and gotta give it to you he said well I want to be in church on Wednesday night I don't want to miss the meetings that man who is death warmed over and got up out of that bed was at the meetings a whole meetings yeah Exodus the hospital room that day he said I'll be in church Wednesday night see you there and so you know it was four months ago now that the doctor said he had cancer in the blood it's leukemia lymphoma and it is spread through one-third of his bones and the lymph nodes and his stomach was so large his stomach has split you know just swelled way out and the doctors said they could burst any minute and he had cancer over and over I'm 50% of his body they estimated and put him on a small pill to boost his immune system but he's had no chemo or radiation they couldn't do that because of his heart condition two weeks ago now we have a doctor's visit and the doctor came in the exam room he came in smile and said let me shake the hand of an off some man and he said wow wow wow he said the blood work showed there's no cancer not fully comprehending the news he he asks the doctor again about the cancer and the doctor said what cancer there is no cancer is gone and I just can't explain it but your lymph nodes is normal your blood work is normal and furthermore he said that we've done an examination on your heart and it's a muscle and it never rejuvenates or restores itself but he said my examination shows your heart is now operating perfectly I can't explain it this just don't happen hallelujah hallelujah amen you can expect the impossible because there's nothing impossible with you whatever you say a man is in your mouth you confess what God's Word said that song that was sung a moment ago it means a lot to me I guess I have played it over and over and over I believe we ever arrive back to the homeland of the Bible and so that's our homeland after a dispara of the 2000 years where the church drifted away from the original word that was given at Pentecost in that in the by the Apostle Paul as a word was revealed I believe we are now in the midst of the fulfillment of Scripture it's a very wonderful hour that we're in and as I read to you a moment ago I believe that it is time for a recession as we have entered back into that homeland that all of the generations that has not been circumcised filled with the Holy Ghost it's time to be filled with the Holy Ghost get the world cut off of you amen so we're here but we have returned here to our homeland to see the Messiah that's why we have come we have come to see the return of Christ not to perpetuate the ages not to break over into another Church age with the need of a new messenger but we we have come to the fulfillment of Scripture we're right here at the fact the winding up of the Gentile dispensation I believe we're so nearer that I believe that even those witnesses that will be going to the Jews Moses and Elijah already here a man I believe they're already born I believe they're already here oh man they have to be for us to leave they have to be ready to step in their ministry they're just waiting on their Commission maybe they're you've gotten misunderstood ways and don't understand about their mysterious life that God revealed it to him in his time a mountain we Everest we are here to see the Messiah dome we have received the message of the exodus and let me wow while I got you ruffled just a little bit about those Jews and those are Moses and Elijah I don't think I'm one of them I'm leaving here before they come on the scene and they won't be a Gentile there'll be a Jew so you can you just go ahead and put your my lighter mantle down and you know your Moses rod and you know because the next the next move of God after we leave here is to Israel a man and you know if you're left behind and you're not an Israelite or Jewish person you you're gonna miss it because there won't be another Gentile saved amen now I'm gonna read my real scripture Exodus chapter 12 and verse 1 is where we're going to be focusing a bone tonight as we look into this as you've seen the scene in Joshua as they entered into the land that came back into the Passover we're going to read in Exodus chapter 12 and verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning a month it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking to all the children of Israel sayin in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers alive for a house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him in his neighbor next to you under his house take it according to the number of the souls and every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year and you shall take it out from the Sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it three places where the blood must be applied and they shall eat the flesh in that that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it wrong not sudden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs with the pertinence thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it unto the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token among the houses where you are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day shall be unto you for memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations you shall keep it a Feast by an ordinance forever then turn with me to numbers chapter 33 will read from the third verse and they departed from ramiz's in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand that means it went out triumphantly in the sight of all the Egyptians for the Egyptians buried all their firstborn which the Lord had smitten among them upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments wherein the day in an hour where the Death Angel is certainly in the land as brother Wayne was preaching last night about the four horse riders and you know his poise right now the rider is already here he's already he's always been there it's been a wider red and a black but now it melts together into one and the same rider now has been identified by the Eagle anointing his death you hadn't started his full ride as in unleashed in his full power yet and he will not until the brightest leaves from here and goes in a rapture but we're already seeing three tribulation plagues coming up on the earth we're already seeing the insanity that is coming upon the world today as a death angel is in the land and brother Branham would tell us as he preached the message after the token desperations and he would kind of demonstrate it like you know I would imagine the children when they saw those big black wings drop down from the sky like a smoke settling over the city and the screams coming from every house and the children might have went to their daddy and said daddy are you sure we're under that token and he could go to that door and look upon the posts a little and say son according to the word I am positive that's according to what the Prophet told us and he has the word of the Lord said when I see the blood I'll pass over you take a lamb for the house and I brought all you children in you're my oldest but my firstborn and that's the one that's dying that's all dying out there but there is the blood that's what thus saith the lord was surest my son rest at ease because god made the promise you say well daddy but why do you got your shoes on and why you got your staff in your hand and why you got that piece of bread and one end and a lamb in the other hand why isn't bitter herbs and things what are you eating it what is a sweat running off of your face about son death is about to strike so it was a time of desperation I want you to know we are in a very desperate hour that sin that abides on every side there's every kind of evil that is coming in I'm on there things are getting darker in fact the prophet of God will not be able to allow to see our day he said I can't see past nineteen seventy seven it got so dark and we are now advanced many years into the hour of darkness well is so dark a prophet couldn't see beyond that date are you with me now but let me tell you we have heard the prophets and what his instructions are listen Exodus 12 22 and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lentil and the to Cyprus with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning listen they were instructed to stay behind that blood amen until the trumpet sound and we ought to stay behind the blood we are to stay there behind the working of the Holy Spirit the blood of Christ are you with me a man until the trumpet sounds notice as we look at this brother band said in the token the Israel was commanded Australia under that blood until the marching orders come don't go out from under it once under that token they were sealed in there don't leave that they were stayed right there until the midnight struck and the trumpets blowed and when the trumpets blowed the old ram's horns began to blow and each one marched out with his provision going to the promised land now Paul would tell us that he would tell us that Christ is our Passover lamb that we also are to have a Passover in 1st Corinthians 5 and 6 he said no you're not a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even Christ our Passover notice his word Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feasts noticing where let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth so you see you know Paul is teaching us that we are continually keeping a feast in other words we are constantly in Passover that's what we're going to speak tonight in the Passover every day for taking of Christ I RAM and man with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth you must keep this feast communing with Christ not only of truth but also with sincerity and Magnum brother branham would see a vision about in turn back into the promised land and he said it was a great highway that he saw as they were going down this highway but he said he noticed everybody on the highway was afraid and he said you know I wonder what is everybody afraid about and the boys came back and said there's such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that his death when his traction hey man and we're living in that day where there's a Death Angel in the land and you must be under a token are you with me he would see it there he would see they saw him take after a friend of his and he was just one jump ahead of him running from him running for his life and the thing was about to get him he screamed out Oh God don't let it get my brother and it turned toward him and he said the closer it got to him the slower it become until it had to stop something was holding it off I don't know what you want but that's the way I want to be I want to be in such a place in a position with God with the death angel comes my way and he's coming he's coming in all kinds of form every kind of sin imaginable or unimaginable he is coming in every kinda way creeping right into our homes coming into our churches a man coming in the lives of what was would seemingly be stomped Saints for many many years but I'll tell you when he hates for me I want something I want to know there's a power that holds him off that he cannot reach to me are you with me and looking back we can see where the serpent has been SURS that yusuf said on our platform Deacon's that used to serve in our churches among trustees and many many young people even what seemed to be stalwart Saints that have fallen away they haven't been bit by the death angel hey man oh yeah we can see at them but brother I wanna I want us to be able to bind that Mamba that snake the one that if you bind you can bind everything beneath him are you with me he said if you can bind this one you can bind everything beneath him and I believe that we are people there is a people in the land that will bind the serpent of Jack and be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hallelujah and if you can bind up when you can bind everything beneath him and a voice came to me from above he said you've been given the power to bind him the worst are any and I want you to know that's not just something given to one man a man went away wait a minute you know we get into some problems here a lot of times but when Moses got the 10 commandments that was his real getting the Ten Commandments a man when he got a message from God that was Israel getting a message from God when brother Branham received a sword in his hand that was you getting a sword in your hand when a message come in this day is not William branham's message it's your message [Applause] you've been given power to bind him the worst or any and he said well God what must I do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere so well God forgive me for my insincerity and let me have sincerity a man and he's said when I raised up my hands to him again there was a great something came over me and just lifted up me up and seemed like that my whole body was charged with something hallelujah don't you want to be that way i mandated that you if you've come into a greater sincerity in your life until your whole being is just charged with satin something that can bind the power of the serpent it's passed to him that all leaven is purged and we come to a greater sincerity now we often think a Passover as a meal that you know it's served kind of like Thanksgiving Day you know for us as Americans meal that lasts all day you know how it is you so you get the table spread and you eat it and then you eat on it all day and you know but Paul says our Passover is Christ and if we're in Christ then each day we are keeping the feast amen you are to be in Passover from the moment you get the Holy Ghost amen the blood applied with his three stripes come on now Amen the blood applied upon your body upon your spirit and upon your soul and you are to be in Passover until the call comes to cut out for the Exodus until the trumpet sounds you are to be in Passover you're to be in fellowship in communion with Christ now until the trumpet sounds you must stay behind the blood of the Lamb feeding on the Passover meal and then making ready to leave for you're going to be in Passover until the day you leave from here hey man now so death was in the land and we must have the token displayed with every within every aspect of our lives and all the leaven of sin removed I'm under sue and this is a manifestation that you're looking for and brother Branham said there's something that takes place in you see there's something that changes you your whole system your old spiritual system it's made new again and you become a new creature in Christ as the Bible puts it a new creation hey man now did you notice did you notice in the scripture that we were reading the israelites were to go out and they were not to go out anymore after the token of the blood the Holy Ghost is applied and not only do you not go out but the death angel can't get in hallelujah amen you don't go out and he can't get in there's a blood that holds him off there's a power that keeps you now or a tribulation or trouble are you with me or great sorrow or whatever you go through in your life there's a power there are blood hallelujah there is a blood and that blood is a seal in your distain behind that bladder Colossians three and three said for your dead to sin and your life is hid with Christ in God brother Branham would often say when he would quote that scripture sealed by the Holy Ghost i man in Israel in the church he said I'm glad to say as Paul of all before the king in the way that is called heresy so worship I the god of our fathers hallelujah heresy crazy foolishness unto the world but glorious to them that are in Christ and joy dead hallelujah yes sir hid away in Christ said well the devil come and got me no he never you went out to him the Bible said you're dead in your life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost how could the devil get to you you went out that's right devil never got to you it's like it was in the days of Noah when God's at the door are you with me and when judgment waters couldn't come in and they couldn't get out and I'll tell you there is a seal of the Holy Ghost a man that have sealed you behind that blood where you're safe and you're secure hallelujah but you gotta stay in the house behind the blood and brother Brennan would say in hidden life with crises and that's what the church needs today is a hidden consecrated life you can't be Dibble Dallin around along with the world and impersonating acting like them and hid with Christ because you're trying to find of the world you're trying to live like the next Church you're trying to belong to a better organization or wear better clothes or do so and so that's that's not comply with Christianity Christianity is a sanctified life hidden life with God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost that's what the real Christian life consists of not how well you can do this sir how well you can sing that's alright how well you can preach that's fine but that isn't it it's a hidden life consecrated the Veil the curtains wrapped around you and you're dead and you're buried and you're hidden God to Christ sealed in there by the Holy Ghost the devil can't get to you he can't do it he's got to come to the same process you did if he did that he would be your brother so he can't get to you a man he can't come through that oh you said but brother branham I receive the Holy Ghost yeah two good things of God yeah but you're in the courts out yonder and that's the reason it don't hold on then next to you and the next sort of that's the reason this next year you're doing pretty good and next year you're back in the world and this revival you're doing fine by the revival zone and when the revivals gone then you're going somewhere else and now with the world and you say oh I receive the Holy Ghost I spoken down I shouted that's all right I have nothing to say about that but why didn't it hold out that's it that's what the world is looking at that's what the people are saying if you're professing this high calling then why are you living that way hey man you know the best thing is to live a sermon instead of preach one your written epistles you can't do it in yourself you can impersonate it for a little while but your sins will find you out you better just consecrate yourself to God and get on the inside and shut the doors behind you and burn every Bridge there is behind you and launch out hey man I know that's the truth he says I know it'll work if it hadn't been for that I don't know what would have become of me hallelujah hey man you say what brother Tim there's a lot of failures on the way well I'll tell you you know there has been a lot of failures but I'll tell you there's some that are still standing this day hallelujah Amen still standing to this day hallelujah a man that has not give up that hasn't quit that hadn't turned around that hadn't went back into sin a manager still living a blob wash life I'll tell you it's not only possible it is provided for you this is a kind of like God wants in your life is a constant overcoming life where you're walking with Christ and fellowship and with him in Passover it's the night of the Passover and we're still in that night brother Branham said there are three watches of the night for the Jews but he said for us there are seven watches and we've had the last watchman to come out and the last watchman has come out the seventh messenger and he told us the mornings coming and the reason is getting darker it was because the Sun is approaching and is pushing the the darkness back are you with me a man so it's the night of the Passover no one's out on the streets there's no curfews that's been imposed by the Egyptians but there's no parent no parties there's no drinking there's no carousing all the true Israelites have applied the bud and they closed the door let's shut away a man inside the house the Passover lamb has been accepted and it's being eaten leaven a type of sin has been removed their loins are girded about them the robe is tucked in your belt for walking and running this chapters in your hand his shoes are on your feet they're getting ready to leave hallelujah that's what the Passover does it gets you ready to leave you are to eat it prepared for the trumpet call hallelujah on love the trumpet call and we go pray up now we prayed up we're walking with him we're in fellowship with him we're in communion with him it's not these not just a one-and-done thing it's a life preparations are being made ready to leave brother Branham sitting who do you say this is we're in the critical hour of the world is but to church the real church not the denomination but the church itself is ready for the greatest triumph that ever made the coming of the groom to the bride hallelujah we've been in the journey a long time amen but I'll tell you what I am ready I'm more ready than ever hallelujah I started preaching this message when I was 15 years old but I'm more ready than ever for the bridegroom to come for the greatest triumph that has ever been but the blood must be applied he must be applied with hyssop faith it's got to be in three places it's got to be in the body it's got to be in the spirit round and it must be in the soul you see just to get it in your flesh is not enough just said just to conform to message standards is not enough and to show all the blood has been applied look at my holiness look at my dress look at the way I am and then that's not enough just to get it up on your spirit round and your emotions get excited that's not enough I'm mad yes it must of course come upon your flesh and it must come in your spirit round but it must be capped off with it coming within the soul of man there's a divine order to this do the side post first then cap it off with the seal of God a man and we're here in the homeland where people are coming back into Passover the feast the blood must be applied you must have the presence of the Lord in your dwellings are you with me can I say there are three places of Passover also the blood must be applied with hyssop with faith upon the church we've got to have the Holy Ghost in the church a man ever service we come here we got to get the blood flowing [Applause] hallelujah you know Eagles don't eat dead carcasses a man that had been dead for you for four days and r-rahman stinking come on they take the fresh kill meat of the word hallelujah where the revelation is flowing and the blood begins to flow whenever blight is he tear into it the Holy Ghost gets all over you hallelujah you've gotta have the blood in your home the tokens gotta be applied and ever dwelling and it must be in the temple of your body all three temples we are in Passover and we will not leave being in Passover until we're called out of this dimension in the great exodus ahead when the trumpet sounds this time of Darkness is a time of darkness upon the earth a time where impersonations abound now I may be taking a little bit too much time tonight but I'm going to just speak for a little while tonight and Trust the Lord will just give me some wisdom here I know you you you have sat in here an hour or hour and a half before the service started nearly an hour before I come out to preach so you know it would be a pity to dismiss now you see you see it's a time where there's darkness on the earth were impersonations abound as Janice and Jan breeze who whispered Moses with their impersonations and you know they were able to convince many not to get under the blood are you with me I mean it would actually harden the hearts of many not just Pharaoh but many do you know some Jewish scholars say that only one in five Israelites left Egypt with Moses I wonder if that's true you know only 20% of the Jews left Egypt and this so demoralized some because a majority of the brother brother brother remained behind no wonder as they got along the journey somewhere they kept talking about let's return back you know they're back there they're back there eating garlic and they're back there but they forgot they were slaves let me have my freedom [Applause] hey man but I want you say you know what an hours to be living in an angel an angel came you know the heavens open seeing things happen moving from heavens that mention right into this dimension are you with me a man and the Anna to you in 1946 an angel of God um I visited a little Kentucky preacher and it heralded one of the greatest divine healing moves ever in order to forerun the his second coming are you with me God has done some extraordinary things in our age went to the extreme to get you to believe I'll give you one example right up from my place is Little Rock Arkansas may be a three-hour drive I was by the School of the Deaf here recently and then passed by there and I just marveled as I thought of it and we thought of the testimonies a man where'd that was a hundred and fifty two deaf and dumb people received their hearing after being visited by a forerunner of his second coming that's incredible I was I've been wrong and I I was was there in some it was in Germany a couple of years ago and we were preaching there and in the meeting there was other preachers there too of course but in the meetings are a little lady walking around with a hearing aids in her hand and she says ah you know I don't need these anymore anybody want these she said I was sitting in the service and then I went to the shower and as I was in the shower there I had my hearing aids out and I could hear children outside playing I can hear birds with singing and said I you know I could hear the shower running I don't need these hearing aids anymore that was one person but we're talking about a hundred and fifty two of them because God was doing some extreme things to get you to believe are you with me a man deport Romney his second coming to get us in preparation start believe it VIN became that God was sending a message for an accident 19:55 brother branham was taking a careful examination of his ministry and the divine healing campaigns had turned into men to a rat race of who has the biggest tent who has the most subscribers to their magazine it was all about preachers and their ego a man you know I tell you I I think sometimes we should have learned our lesson many years ago about personality cult followings a man I'm not interested in a personality cult following I want people to get in love with Jesus I can do one thing what we're here in this meeting let's get in love with Jesus let's come to know human power of his resurrection that will save you deliver your sexy free sector soul on fire with glod yet the man who the angel came to and who was the most gifted William Branham had no magazine no tent and no ego just a sincere desire to help God's people I'm brother Branham said one day I was praying and God gave me the name the type of voice of healing and the rank would write with my ministry the voice of one crying in the wilderness and so forth so I gave it to name the voice of healing he had a magazine yet William Branham simply signed a magazine over to Gordon Lindsay and even the organization that they had formed the voice of healing signed it over to Gordon Lindsay along with his tent and later he would actually have to rent his own tent from the voice of healing that was paid and bought with money's that was collected in his meetings brother Branham was Hayley and three witnesses he said I started in I organized it a little paper said I we I organized a little paper called a voice of healing they still have it here well I found out then there's lots of finances and stuff hooked up to it so I washed my hands of that stuff a long time ago so the voice of healing is not my paper I have nothing to do with it not at all that belongs to brother Lindsay at three-port Louisiana they would move it from three port to Dallas Texas cuz three port didn't have a a an airport at that time and come to find out I got into that I thought I was kidding out of organizations and I got into one and it was still just almost organized down to every one of them in there and I belong to just the Lord Jesus and then I can come and go anywhere I wish to and wherever he whatever he leads me to do I can be free let me give you a little history here you know this this man William Branham was so humble and so sincere too sincere and too dedicated to God's service to desire a big organization you know he wanted to devote his time in prayer and waiting on God and meeting with the angel and seeing the visas many of them before even walked out to the platform he didn't want to be strapped with all the finances and the worries and on the other hand all Roberts built a university named it after himself and he joined the United Methodist Church because they offered more linen see and doctrinal and moral issues than the Pentecostal Holiness Church so he positioned himself as being more mainstream denomination so he could be more popular and accepted carnal historians looking back on this can't understand they can't wrap their mind around why the man with the greatest gift who met an angel not one time but hundreds of times his ministry accompanied night after night by the pillar of fire yet they want to paint him as being too illiterate or perhaps too naive or too simple to build a huge Kingdom from and for himself they just can't understand why man wouldn't want to Kingdom and yet this is not the truth the truth was he just wasn't interested in kingdom building and super egos he gave up his own paper to the voice of healing that God gave him the name of gave the tempter to a Gordon Lindsay and the voice of healing and then paid rent on the tenth a tenth purchase from money that comes from the campaigns and this man was one who met the angel he had a gift that set him apart and above all the other healing evangelist and he could have been a multi multi-millionaire but refused it now 1955 he would quit and go home because it wasn't enough money to cover the campaigns and he said I told God if it wasn't you know if I have to beg for offerings and and everything else he said I'll just go home and he was fifteen thousand dollars in debt this was over in California that was equivalent to a hundred and thirty thousand dollars in today's money and he goes home broke Durance this subsequent and investigation and I got this from Wikipedia his manager Gordon Lindsey was taking most of the money for his own use William Branham had a salary of seven thousand dollars while Lindsay made $80,000 to manage his campaigns in today's money brother branham made a salary of about sixty two thousand dollars a year while Lindsay pocketed seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and all this went to the voice of the healing foundation which would be later changed to Lindsay's Christ for the nation in Dallas Texas in its Bible school and our University made you know on the funds you know it was like Elijah Elisha refused the money from naming the leper who was healed but forget Bukka haze' the servant took it and became a leper if brother Branham didn't want the money well Linton's he did so he built a kingdom with it so it wasn't it all that God had failed to provide it was that men with their own greed and agendas were misusing the funds and now the field had become crowded with impersonators who were touting the biggest tenth the biggest magazines were the most subscribers the most miracles and television programs and the man who was visited by the angel with the real message was pushed aside by the masses impersonators Aros brother Brandon goes out there's only one met by an angel the only one with a true gift now the others were anointed but William Branham was set apart and known as a man sent from God I've not what we say about him that's what they said about him they called him a 20th century of prophet and man they called him a prophet visit South Africa all Roberts comes to see Jack Cole comes to see brother Branham talks about all Roberts Vinson in there he's a little ragged Tenten I was in the final auditorium and he said he sat on my sidelines and was in the meetings and afterwards he said brother Branham you think God would hear my prayers he said he'll hear anybody's prayer Laurel he said now I sit in his sidelines Jack cope went to see you remember the story many of you probably have read it or heard about it he went to the meeting as a skeptic he was Assembly of God preacher and it was a you know he had heard about the miracles and the gift and you know he he was skeptical of it he said he was and he said but there was a man who was blind and he had no eyeballs and brother Branham told him that in three days eyeballs will form in your head and you after that you will see well I'll not Jax listening to this and he kind of scoffs at this and then he said anybody could say that you know this man if he disappears off the platform who know where he is next you know there's thousands of people out here and so you know but Jack sitting on the platform and on his way out brother Brandon passes by him and stopped touch him on the knee is knee and prayed softly and he says you're not sick you're just worn down from preaching meetings but don't be skeptical you were doubting whether this is of God or not I want to tell you that this is of God and we are both fighting the same devil go on and continue in your revival for you were also called to pray for the sick by the way every preacher every man called of God is called afraid for the sick in fact every believer even the little mother at home is called a cast Satan out what Jack said I went home you know walking on cloud nine you know I'm gonna have a healing ministry and he said I decided to go back to the meeting in three days and he said I come back and he said I found that man and sure enough eyeballs had been formed in his head but he still it he couldn't see but he said by that evening the man were blind men was seeing and shouting all over the place the glories of God he said William Branham was born four dispensational purposes and I say amen to that well Jagger's come to see him before long did you know they the field is crowded with impersonators and you know again you know you wind up with wood with all Roberts with a ministry one of the most recognized preachers worldwide died a disgrace with false prophecies Jack go start out humbly enough but as his ego grew in his quest to be the best he wouldn't measured or roberts10 and built her one foot bigger her few inches bigger so he could out having the biggest tenth the biggest magazine with the most subscribers and Jack would be the first to die was off to seeing the 38 years of age hey Allen began with his tenth began being arrested for drunkenness finally found dead at the age of 59 police found his body in the room strewed with with pills and empty liquor bottles a 12 to a investigation on top see the coroner's report concluded he died from liver failure brought on by acute alcoholism and the coroner reported that when Allen died he had a blood alcohol content of point 36 which is enough to ensure a deep coma and Bol Jagger's another a similar God preacher who was inspired by the miracles that he saw in brother Brandon's meetings no doubt starting out humbly but see and he could be enriched by the crowds that were attracted and not having an angelic visitation or the gifts he started promoting the sale of blood and oil and that he got from a woman's body sold it for the purpose of healing then vitamins from the Dead Sea and then baptized into eternal life claiming they would never dive he baptized him and that wasn't enough the Pentecostals started manufacturing tongues and impersonated the gift of tongues by confusing the language with babbling are you with me a man in 1955 brother branham has certain vision and he's shown the third tall and he was shown that his managers were mishandling the funds misuse and the funds that their emphasis was on money so he saw them taking the offering but no altar call was given and they muttered wasn't well wasn't Christ left with twelve when he told him the truth and this would be the very thing that would happen a man because again they their emphases turn from helping the people and healing and delivering and Seussian people saved under the emphases was all we took the offering and didn't finally you know they that that mattered will wasn't Christ his brother Brent said well you know who just miss he's just missing the meeting so well was in Christ you don't let for twelve when he told him the truth and this this was a foul of the healing campaigns sometimes you wonder whatever happened to it that's what happened it became all about money prestige popularity nobody you know who wanted to attract crowds and the masses could preach the truth troubled about the impersonators brother Branham sought the Lord and he had a vision of the third pole we're in the tenth miracles were performed in a little room away from the eyes of the impersonators but then he also saw that the church had to come away from had to come away from carnally impersonating the new birth and they were they were receiving an impersonation and it was either Billy Graham's intellectualism and his intellectual conception are the Pentecostals fanaticism to extremes all right now so you some brother branham beginning to preach on why Pentecost failed and they wouldn't grow up in Christ that wouldn't take the word that wanted to just perpetuate the babyhood Ephraim wanted to plant corn in manassas field in other words everybody wanted a healing ministry for the money and the fame and the power and the glory that went with it and Pentecost was refusing to go deeper into the genuine experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Branham preached the impersonation of Christianity that not only were the healing gets me and impersonated but the Christian life was being impersonated by claims of either shaking the preachers hand and either believe is amore some fanatical sensation or a manufactured tongue and yet lives were not changed and instead there was a cheap impersonation of the gospel I'm talking about Janice and Jambres now a man that would call some to disbelieve and lose heart a man brother Branham would preach the hidden life with Christ showing why people can't keep the victory the manner wasn't lasting their light kept going out he pointed out that they had failed to come into the holiest of holies hey man can I bring you back down to the Passover to come behind the blood they had failed to come to the holiest of Holies where the same pot of manna are you with me which rather where that was on the the original Pentecost that never breeds worms and never gives tail are you with me I ran the day royally refusing to come to that manner among the original Pentecost a man will come with it's a kind of glory light the pillar fire never dims or goes out to come into a place where dead-stick place and the presence of God comes to life and bears fruit hallelujah I know it's true because I was a dead stick [Applause] hallelujah that laid in the presence of that Shekinah glory and came to life hallelujah were Aaron's rod blooms and the presence of God he was showing that your life must be in Passover in communion sealed away with Christ where you are sealed in and Satan is sealed out with a constant fellowship with Jesus a man the hidden life were one is in Passover and will not be impersonated Amanda the veiled shut between you and the world come on a man where the life of Christ is present now I'm going to take you to the scripture that he preached from Ezekiel 36 and verse 25 where he began to preach and this is exactly where it lays in the Old Testament of the new birth that was promised when he said to Nicodemus oh you know you're a master in Israel and you don't know what I mean when you say you must be born again it was written in the word that a new birth was coming and then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and will cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments to them and Oh hallelujah you said well in the land that I have gave your father's and you shall be my people and I will be your God there are people returning back to the homeland and that is about the Holy Ghost that puts you into this land brother Branham shows it's a new heart is your intellect and it's a new way of thinking it's God and large in the mind and making the Word of God believable a man that's what the new heart is and yet you can have your thinking change and not have received the hell of the Holy Ghost an impersonation of Christianity he explained so God had to give you a new heart not a patched up one a new heart that your intellect that you think with a new way of thinking and when he give you a new way of thinking yes that's right the Bible looks to be reasonable I used to didn't believe it that I believe it now see that's your great revival they say yes I don't want to go to hell I want to accept Christ that's all good that's good that's just your first step are you with me hey man there's there's three places the blood must be applied are you with me this was Billy Graham in his revival the Spirit of God was moving and thousands would flock to you soldiers haven't received a new heart a new thinking why the Bible's reasonable I don't want to go to hell I will make heaven my home and if a rock star our movie star a ball star says so and thinks it's the right thing to do well I'll become a Christian too here's some years ago I was in our cabin there with my friend brother Dan Dyer was there with me and and and I don't normally turn on the television my wife will tell you I hardly ever look at something like that but nevertheless I've flipped on the channel and saw Billy Graham let's together what's this so I watched him and they had given criticism that the song just as I am was was causing people to move so Billy Billy decided that service he would not even have a song when they sing but before you know he has the his sermon that he preached his own he has a rock star come out and play a song and testified that he had given his heart to the Lord and he sings a little said a little jingle there and then he has a coach Shiva of a soccer team which this was in England this film was so you know this guy comes out and tells about how him and his wife had received Christ as her personal Saviour in their life had been changed you know these things you know movie stars and great men are accepting cry is the right thing to do it's acceptable you know it's a it's them it's the what we ought to do today you know the right thing to do I become a Christian too but the Holy Spirit is not a noose hop though it will change your thinking a man a new thought now we bring that concept into the message and hold on here and you must have your thoughts changed I mean what God is doing great things God sent a prophet I believe it the seals were opened I believe that serpents see that just makes sense what is God doing he's giving you a new heart and then you beginning to look at the word wow that's a--that's a reasonable I can understand that I can accept that wow that makes sense make simple a lot more sense than eating an apple right a man but you know and that's what we do around the message we give people knowledge and they receive it but that's only a new heart hey man it's like Billy Graham did he gave people knowledge that Jesus loved them and died for them and they accept that knowledge and believe it but what do they have just a new heart a man it's not enough to keep the Death Angel away it's not enough to take you in a rapture hey man now you know they get a new heart the brother branham said in God's provided a lamb not in electro fate that's what's the matter with our our revivals today now here we get it Billy Graham's axilor many great men all Roberts great evangelists on the field has calmed this nation back and forth altar calls have been made enough to convert a thousand Americas but the reason it's only it's only the people are brought to an intellectual faith even they would just go a little deeper till that faith come from the intellectual and soak down into the soul it would last but the reason about 80% 90% of the converts said that comes in I was gone before six months is gone it is because it only had an intellectual conception but when it becomes an experience of being born again of the Spirit of God that anchors to eternity now there's an election side the message now it is a new heart and suddenly it's wonderful that the word is believable a man and we gain understanding that of the great mysteries but still that isn't it Paul would say until I understand all mysteries and all knowledge and yet not have to charity which is the basic element of God's nature that comes by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I'm nothing now you see that's the hyssop hyssop represents faith the blood is applied by faith but you can have all the hyssop you want and wave it in the face of the death angel and it won't save you from his wrath and then the tribulation is coming and you need faith just as Israel needed hyssop but you must have the blood applied and when your faith wasn't given to you just accept a creed or a statement of faith the hyssop without blood it's just hyssop believe them the message is not enough believe in the seals are ugly is not enough it's only hyssop your faith is not to be in the seals your faith is to be in the blood that was sad personally for you [Applause] hallelujah your faith was be anointed it must be plunged it must be dipped in the blood the Holy Spirit and applied to seal out the Death Angel striking the doorpost with hyssop that's not dipped in blood will accomplish nothing a man their spiritual Israelites today who claim to believe and have a hyssop in their hand say but yet but they have not a trace of blood because you can see the death angel is all over them are you with me it comes in their house with television with Hollywood dress with makeup with pornography with slothful lazy lives and no desperation and no sincerity and no dedication hey man they're not in fellowship with God they're not in communion they're not in Passover brother banner would say in the token message apply a church now don't fail will you now don't don't don't let the Sun set don't don't don't don't rest day or night don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token you say I believe yes I go yeah I believe the message that's all right but then that's good but you must have the token do you hear Branum Tabernacle you must have the token displayed a man without it all you're believing is in vain you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right and that's fine but that's not it when I see the bud that's the token hallelujah oh don't let me just use a word dairy that gets a little bit ambiguous token the token is the Holy Ghost when I see the Holy Ghost I will pass over you a man it's the only way that you can escape the Death Angel and the tribulation that is coming so don't just come this far and say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into Christ you say well I believe every word said brother Branham that's good but that's just being able to read take the message and take it in your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ being you when I see that I'll pass over you but God said also I'll give you a new spirit now this is the other side of the pendulum you're on one side you got you got you got a new heart the other side a new spirit you must supply the blood here you must supply there are you with me I'll give you enough I'll give you a new spirit now this is the opposite side of intellectualism the new spirit again is not the Holy Spirit amen that's when the seed of your emotions gets cleaned up and may new and you shout and you dance and you rejoice a man just as a new hard earth new thinking is important to your overall experience you need a new spirit a man the impersonation of Christianity said now notice the order of the scripture it's it's perfect God said I'll take away the old stony heart you can't receive nothing then he said I'll give you a new spirit now that ain't the Holy Spirit and that's where the mistake has been made a lot of people come to the altar to pray and they get down to praying and praying to get the feeling a little better they might get up and go on and jump around a little bit and after a while they just bounce bounce bounce back again they never received the Holy Spirit no matter how much they bounce or how much they scream or how much oil run out of their hands and they had bloody faces or how much they spoke in tongues or how much they shouted or what they did there's nothing at all to do with it that was only human emotions they got a new spirit and they rejoice with it hey man I'm gonna say something he said I wanted to sink deep and may God help there is the emotional side of the so-called Holy Ghost Church today they get a lot of build-up fanaticism and run off here because they disregard the word they are only go they go only together oh we had a great meeting hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now when you do that and don't bear the fruit of the Spirit then you're in the new spirit you didn't used to do that that's right but God gave you a new spirit why the spirit you had you couldn't even get along with yourself so how you're gonna get along with God [Applause] hallelujah hey man I'm glad to come into church and get your spirit lifted shout a little bit and release some of the grief troubles of the AIDS and the things that you're in but that ain't the Holy Ghost it might be the spirit moving on your emotions but that itself is not the Holy Ghost so you can believe and have a new heart and yet not have the Holy Ghost you can get a new spirit and you can shout and then you have your emotions charged by the word and not have the indwelling spirit but God will still take you beyond what can be impersonated into a hidden life with Christ where the world and sin is cut off and you are behind the blood that's why says in verse 27 a man because going through with you a man he caps it off with blood right over the notes from only both sides right here to get right deep down into the soul are you with me over the doorpost and I will put in my spirit not a new spirit not a new heart not a new thinking all we believe seven seed in the seals we believe God's in a probably not just a new thinking I mean not just a new shouted I didn't used to shout but now I get my motion stirred when I come to church it's more than that I will put my spirit within you and will cause you to walk in my statutes and you Sal did you hear me you shall keep my judgments and do them hallelujah are you with me it'll be the inside teacher it'll be an indwelling power it'll be my spirit moving in your life bring in your body bring in your flesh bring in your secret bringing your adder breathe it all under the blood I'll put my spirit within you and will cause you it won't be you no longer living the message it won't be a bunch of rules and regulations anymore it won't be an external law it'll be the Holy Ghost living on the inside of you swelling on the inside springing up and eternal us [Applause] and you shall keep my judgment and you shall do them I can't live the Christian life you can't live the Christian life brother branham could live the Christian life only God can live the Christian life and you gotta get him on the inside of you and you shall in the land that I gave your father's Yuval right in this word you won't believe that's where you dwell right in this word are you with me now amen I keep you and you shall be my people and I will be your God blessed are the people whose God is the Lord I will be your God you will be my people spirit [Applause] won't be you find it anymore - over flowers over a man they'll be the Holy Ghost liveth dad on the inside of the inside [Applause] blessed be the name of the law hallelujah we have returned back through the land and in the land there is a Passover and there you the Holy Ghost when we're sealed away with him with the world sealed out hallelujah Lord God just what should be my moment hallelujah hallelujah this worship in the moment glory to God hallelujah fill this house where we're sitting with the Holy Ghost let him come like a rushing mighty wind let him come in to fight himself over ever life whatever heart we're the first baptism of the Holy Ghost every Christian should have that experience before they say anything about being a Christian your own experience Alleluia ah yeah we but you know we want to substitute we don't want to be we don't want to be Pentecostal so we'll just take an intellectual conception of the message a man now listen to me but we have an eternal prescription it still works I'm here to tell you still works the Taira prescription still works around unless we get some quack pharmacist that kind of mess with the prescription amen but if will keep it the way the word said hallelujah brother Brennan said what's the matter with the Pentecostal church today we live too close to Hollywood we got too much a Hollywood evangelism study the old-fashioned type that digs down and cleans up and boils out and gets men and women right with God you know that's right he said I'm just the old-fashioned kind that likes the old-fashioned religion that's the way I got it down at the altar was somebody beating me in the back till I come through and that's what we need today instead of amongst this triad repentance and putting her name on her church look I don't know yeah there is a hidden life where the veil drops around you sealing the world and sent out a pot of manna that never gets stale you never get tired of eating it hallelujah no you don't ever get stale and old to you the light of the Sun of gloats the kind of glory never dims and dead streaks comes alive and her fruit-bearing hallelujah oh yeah you say but-but-but brother Branham said that the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit sealed cannot be broken you've all heard me saved the people said the devil made me do that no no no the devil didn't make you do it you just wasn't sealed in so then because when you're sealed in he's sealed out hey man he's home I think of that now but those were the new only one new heart are an intellectual change or a new spirit an emotional charge but without the Spirit of God in 12 of them they'll go through the trial of tribulation brother Branham said they will wind up in the tribulation because they are actually not under the blood he said they claim they are but they're not a man he said how could they go through a trial to prove he Rifai them when the bleached blood of Jesus Christ takes every symptom of sin and stuff away from him you're already dead your life is hidden him through God sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what are you gonna be jobs for what are you gonna get your fur for your purification what do you have to be purified from when you're perfectly in Christ sinless hallelujah save us Oh hallelujah that's we it is it's got to be applied Church a man has got to be applied everybody passing by talking to you has any associates with you seeing the blood is applied and the token of the life that was in that blood is upon you and you're safe from wrath that alone not membership I might just call you're sitting on the message pew don't save you you can go to my church brother Donny's church go to go to brother Ron Church doesn't matter where you go and man membership will not save you there's only one thing you must come under the blood you must receive the Holy Ghost and Israel was commanded to stay under the blood till the marching orders came are you with me now hey man now if you're watching your clock I probably won't go past 10 o'clock but if I do I just do amen hallelujah if you is it a ballgame you still be locked in this is better than the ballgame stay in the house was the order don't leave eat on the lam under the protection and the blood until you're called out in a rapture this must be eaten in a state of preparedness ready to go from the slaying of the Passover lamb to cow from at Calvary until now it's been night you stay in the Passover until the trumpet sounds in the morning a man exodus 12:22 take a bill to hyssop dipped it in the blood that's in the base and strike the lentil the sous I posed for the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning so you see we can see the evening shadows are approaching and wrath is about to fall and God he is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost and it's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass and listen because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer amen now brother Branham would preach this sermon the token and he said it was a sermon needed to follow the seals it's a sermon declaring that the token the sign God's requiring is the literal life of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost and that the blood of Christ the Holy Ghost that is a prerequisite for the rapture now after the token message he'll preach sermons like desperations that evening and he and he kind of continues the same song and he says um he refers back to the morning sermon on the token he said this morning referring to the token sermon he tells us a message here's two-ply the token get the holy ghost he said the message this morning to me was to me the highlights message of my entire ministry some of you like to preach the highlights it's the token the literal life of Christ must be in here someday I'll tell you how I come about but I know that everything has worked for months and months and months after that one message moving up to come to that place that was a Capon of time of it and he said I believe with all the messages I ever brought that was absolute was ordained of God outside court surrender Commission like the seven seals and things that was directly the Word of God I'm talking about a message to preach I believe that one was it see the one that's needed to follow the seven seals now watch that would come after the seven seals are uniting their people you're not in signs a red light flashing and like that last day sign of women getting prettier and what men what they would do all these signs of the Holy Spirit leading up and then come right back here the capping off of all those messages since the seven seals it's all capped off in this one thing the token that we're all right see just checked ourselves and see that we're in the faith now I want to get something to the one that's needed to follow the seven seals the token the sign that the Holy Ghost the life of the blood has been applied to our life is what has been needed come on now after nearly forty years a preaching on the seals the mighty angel the open book and discovered what how we got off to the church ages it's past for us to come back to a book of Acts church hallelujah come back to a book of Acts Church come back to the Holy Ghost and man daddy is it damn daddy are you positive 1 positive that's according to the word that the Prophet told us he has the word the Lord when I see the Blood I pass when we take a lamb I brought all your children in you're my oldest my first more that's the one that's dying out there but there is the blood that's what thus saith the Lord was listen this is what the message for the Exodus is you must get the Holy Ghost a man you say well I brother Jim we understand we understand the seals in serpent seed and predestination do you got the Holy Ghost man why are people dying out there how come we're hearing the screams how come I'm hearing screams of pastors and say then we'll come on Winston I they get filled up like a little jagged that's just after a few minutes of preaching they they want to be gone just in a few minutes there's no real no real capacity in them for the word anymore around there they have no capacity they got a little capacity anymore then or you know they can only take so much and then you want to go home they just want to entertainment caddy why are your shoes on why you got to stop in your hand well you got a piece of bread and one hand lamb and the other why is the bitter herbs what have you eaten what's a sweat running off your face the death things I hear it coming I hear the cross ah I'm aware I'm aware of youth camps where in this past youth camp we cast out ten major by the grace of God by the power the Holy Spirit wasn't me but by the power of the Holy Ghost cast out ten major manifestation of demon powers that's right hey man I know where they come in we found out where they come in they came in through your game boys into your sex and your pornography they come in to the movies you were watching and you open up yourself to evil spirits are you with me a man and a demon come in you didn't even realize and then another comes in or the first thing you know you're addicted [Music] I called me the other day and fussed at me and he said you know he was talking to me because you know I he was from another state now I'll keep it as confidential but he can't called me and he said you know you talked to my wife and she's been mad at me ever since I said to all you know she coming was asking for help because you were in pornography yeah he said I I've I've cut down on that a little bit said I've been you know I was spending five hours a day in pornography he said but I have the Holy Ghost I said no son you don't have to hold the guys it ain't there there's no power in you to keep you from sin well I hadn't looked at it in the last few days you know and when I do I just skip to it a little bit and get out of it I'm not like I was I said you need to change there is a power Amen - come come in there and change your life I said you you neither even a new thinking where sin makes you sick that it's not appealing anymore there's no attraction anymore and it ain't somebody standing over your shoulder or preacher beating you over the head or subtle all that is being applied to you of some legalistic affair it's the Holy Ghost that will keep you in the hour of temptation Alleluia amen you talk about you talk about a move of the Holy Ghost we saw young people with Gameboy videos stacked up with thousands of dollars worth all their gods and their idols and their wasted years wasted lives and then take them and beat them into smithereens and burn with fire I'd rather burn them with fire than to burn with fire man but you see again you see what we want today we want something we can come up to the altar and spend a few minutes here and get one and done we just want to experience at the altar and then just go about our lives as usual [Music] you see I want to get it to you it's more than the initial striking of the blood a man it's more are you with me it's more than just taking faith and applying the holy is here and here and here but it's that you are behind that blood and you come in fellowship and you enter into Passover hallelujah where you are keeping a feast with the Lord there's a fellowship going on there's a communion and no it's not just on Sunday morning or Sunday night it's every day of your life never you never get out of Passover and in the Passover you take the whole lamb I hate that caught put up a calendar hey man you see you see he would take the whole lamb don't don't cut of it don't don't cut it apart the Baptist's only won't their favorite part that's all they won't for Passover the Methodists takes another part but this Passover must be nothing rejected the whole land a man nothing excluded nothing separated nothing pulled apart not a bone of it broken the whole lamb real Passover isn't your just your favorite quotes or your favorite scriptures a man or your favorite preacher real Passover is eating the whole lamb don't break it apart and roast it with fire are you with me a man in order to really have Passover you gotta have a fire in your dwelling hallelujah and to get a fire in your dwelling you've got a have you've got out the word of the Word of God and you gotta have it lit with a fiery experience let's set you on fire hallelujah Lord and God there's got to be a fire leaping and roaring around that lamb can I tell you the fire must touch the word and bring it to the right temperature where is done well prepared hallelujah amen the Bible said don't eat it raw is that right heat not a bit wrong or sudden at all with water but roast with fire his head his legs and with the pertinence thereof now there are some parts that ain't as desirable as other parts but in Passover you take it all hey man it's the head all the way to the tail it's the feet it's everything they would take there from what I understand it would put a skewer from head to tail then they would put another skewer and open up the cavity to expose it to the fire and it would go through this way a perfect cross and then they would roast it over the fire turning every part of it around the fire to get it on and that's what's a matter with a lot of our churches today we're not getting the fire of the Holy Ghost around the word and it's too wrong for the people to really get any benefit out of it many times it's just a cold Creed we're not getting it hot enough mmm but build up that fire amen we're not getting the fire the Holy Ghost surround the word and it's just too raw a man but build it up amen I let the flames of the Holy Ghost wrap itself around that word until the juices are running out hallelujah glory to God Oh hallelujah hey man that's what we need we need the fire come around that word until the juice is the line for the lamb just starts bubbling out of the world [Applause] lelou yeah ah ah but dead preachers give out dead sermons and dead sermons killed I don't serve it sodden with water amen because then you can soak the lamb into the lamb any kind of doctor and the flavor that you want so don't boil it in water it is to be flavored by the fire hallelujah amen you must realise how danger it is to misconstrue the word in time evangelism brother Brendan said we find out at the beginning when the messenger was sent to misconstrue his word or to doubt one word it was Total Annihilation and eternal separation from God then misconstrue that messengers word Eden saw eating saw the sudden lamb soaked in water with all kinds of additions of wild gourds that flavor the meat mixing the word with intellectual ideas of man the first thing you know we got death in the pot and this is added 11 back to the Passover meal and it leaves the people vulnerable to the death angel a man it makes a bunch of carnal believers like lot who barely escaped the burning of the tribulation I had and yeah God can use lots in here they're like coins in his hands and God uses pennies but friends our message is not to collect pennies our message is to get that silver dollar 100% Word of God Alleluia oh yeah but this is this is a day in the hour and I've got to skip some things to get to where I'm going hey man but let me tell you friends you see it'll-it'll come in your life it'll change your views your view of sin and abortion that important can you imagine message girls are now saying message girls are now saying it's my body and it's our freedom to kill our babies you know why but you know why would women want to do that you know why the application for abortion is because we're living in fornication so if they decide not to marry this man they just kill his baby and there won't be obligated to him - nothing John oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I mean it's out that the death angels in the land changing the mind insanity coming in are you with me hey man you know a recent survey revealed among Christian men ages 13-18 is 81 percent actively seek out pornography 76 percent of 18 to 24 and ages 18 to 24 and 65 percent of men 25 to 39 nearly half of Christian men ages from 36 to 60 56 percent of Christian women actively seek out pornography ah and we're meeting it in prayer lines we're meeting it you know in and lives are being wrecked and homes are being wrecked hey man we got men are just as worthless as they can be spending hours with a little-bitty King boy you know you know I was serving their God some animate something another and playing with these things and sex subjects and murder and every time the other vice and feeding on that instead of feeding on the lamb hallelujah amen I would say you're changing preaches tomorrow but it you won't get any better i man it'll be just as hard this will be the truth I've heard other dolly preaching up to no well let me tell you 300 if you ever get the immortal life of the Holy Ghost inside of you it'll throw your body subject to God a man that he that's born of God that not commit sin and there is therefore now no condemnation took them that are in Christ Jesus for their walk not after the flesh but after the spirit oh yeah Alleluia so when the Holy Spirit moves in you your body quickly turns to it whatever the Holy Ghost says hey man it's the unleavened bread of Christ and it makes you to live a holy life amen oh yeah death is in the land we got California lawmakers recently passed a measure forcing pastor to embrace the LGBTQ theology you're facing it in your skills you're facing it everywhere you're facing on the job we're seeing the nation is turning quickly from lamb to lion our dark are to dragon are you with me man and those that are left behind in this Exodus will be hunted down and slaughtered and then we got churches under attack they're dying there's lethargy lukewarm age has altered the mind of the people did you know dulling their senses and America the religious nation of America over a hundred a day will close across America only to be left to skeleton of a building with no people and even now the youth are gone uninterested in what they have to offer the death angel is bringing sin and sodomy and perversion and abortions and I've had message people write me write me and say brother Tim this is our third child and we can't afford it would it be all right to abort it and I hit delete because you're not worth [Applause] God's gonna have a people that are filled with the spirit that are walking in the world a man are you with me recently a message youth conference there they they announced where they they were gonna have a Youth Conference because they're there they're kids who are young people were eat up with pornography and homosexual and all these things and said and they said and and you know we we reject the thought if you just get the Holy Ghost that fixes it and I'd say you know what that's because they ain't never got the Holy Ghost they don't know what it is and then because when the Holy Ghost comes it'll make a man be a real man a woman be a real woman make a real lady out of her that's what the only ghosts will do it or take pornography and sin and evil all these things out of your life oh yeah and then we see those that have been solid in the faith for years look like pillars in the church now rejecting the truth and living sordid sinful conditions are you with me now hey man oh but we're predestinate oh yeah we believe we're predestinated we believe God's gonna pick us up in the rapture and clean this up and without any effort or desire on our own to do it you must come under the blood and it must be more than getting the blood on your flesh and you quit cutting your hair and paint in your face and smoke it it must be more than getting in your spirit realm and having your memory and your senses purged it brings you into intimate fellowship where you eat the lamb and the bread unleavened there's a soberness but in the midst of that soberness and then bringing it down to close now hang on just for a few minutes there was a soberness yet the same time there was a joy in Everhart this is our last day of slavery this is the last night in Egypt hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory in the midst of that soberness in the midst of the Death Angel we got a Joey within our heart this is the last age there will not be another this is a last message the trumpet is about to sound and this is the day of our freedom [Applause] ah there won't be another Turkey there won't be another age to follow there won't be another message this is the last we're not perpetuating the aegis we're here at the end time are you with me now daddy daddy got slavemaster you know he was that slave master you know he was the firstborn to tonight daddy he's gonna be dead he will never threaten your life again daddy his whip well a silent never will that hand ever move to pick up a whip

dead but we are gonna leave out of here triumphantly and Egypt will be burying their dead cuz I will execute judgment on all their gods hallelujah the night of the Passover father has taken the slain
