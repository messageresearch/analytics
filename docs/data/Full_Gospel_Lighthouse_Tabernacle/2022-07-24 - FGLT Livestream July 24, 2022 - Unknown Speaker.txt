welcome to come not just her home but our church amen brother joel is here this morning his father is a friend of mine he's going to be having open heart surgery on friday and they're going to be taking five different veins from his legs and do an open heart with him and i told him we would pray with him this morning so brother joel if you're coming amen by proxy we send word to your father he's quite a friend of mine known in many years [Music] the one that created the heart you you made the heart like you made your own throne even so much so that it's described in ezekiel [Music] how that there's four great chambers representing the the surface [Music] every blood vessel that goes out of it is a type of the heart and the throne of god is because you want to live in the heart of a man not just the physical part but you want to live lord the life chamber i pray that you would send your word may his doctors begin to work i pray that the angels of god would stand present the sight of that man of that believer and i ask you to send your word comfort this family strengthen them father lord i ask you that you would do a work and as they do their work may you be there to heal him and rehabilitate him give him life in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen now we believe amen amen i love you i love you with all my heart amen amen amen just a second our sister's going to minnesota and today is her last sister ruth she's named after the queens of the bible and we've enjoyed having her with us and sister ruth if you'd come we would like to have prayer with you as well this morning and she asked me if i could come to her wedding whenever she gets married in life and amen that might take me some places amen sister ruth we've enjoyed having you here the same holy spirit that's been in this building wants to go and be with you you're a great girl god bless you heavenly father just now your presence that is here i ask you to touch sister ruth today [Music] oh

christ's name amen amen your parents should be very proud of you i am [Music] [Music] hallelujah any good to us amen what a wonderful time that was here yesterday for the children and we certainly appreciate those that did what they did sister katie and all your team thank you for doing that and we were able to be here a few moments with you and and uh boy that looked like a lot of fun maybe we'll have an adult day one day and like andrew said we'll have a prayer line amen amen god bless you i would like for you to remember us wednesday we fly sister connie and i fly to edmonton canada for brother ed hammermeister is overseeing that church now and it's the edmonton church and i've been there for many many years and i'll be preaching in the meeting saturday and sunday evening and we're going to try to work it some way where if we can just speak to you after church work it somewhere away and archive it on our youtube and so if that would be possible and so if you would remember us there i will be speaking with brother tim pruitt and maybe speed seated just for a moment i just want to share something with you amen thank you i believe this meeting has some incredible significance to it it was about two years ago that maybe even just a bit more than that i had a i had a dream vision i i don't remember at this point but i've got it written down brother tim's got it written down i think some of my family has it written down that we were working in the darkness and we were standing in the darkness and we were doing our very best to get people into the light it was in the evening time and you could just see images of people that seemed like a lot of people that were going backwards and forwards and and uh we were preaching with all of our passion and i looked across the way and brother tim pruitt was on the other side of the gate and we're doing our best to get people and when the the gate was open and there was great light and and on the other side of that light was much singing it sounded like angels singing and there was like beams of light it was like your fingers beams of light coming out and and when we actually drove by brother tim pruitt's church i looked at his window seals and they had this his night his church's evening light and it had those beams of light that was going out and brother tim and i have never spoke that meeting there at together at edmonton and when we begin to put it together brother harold hildebrandt actually asked us to come before his passing brother timothy pruitt will be speaking with us unbeknownst to any of us the pope would arrange to be at edmonton on the same weekend i think that has incredible significance to it because in the darkness of all of this there's a light that's still standing and and that will have a lot of that will have a lot of uh precedence in that city because of the pope will be there at the same time but whether the world wants to admit it or not the the two or three uh most powerful preachers is going to be there and so and so so if you would just remember us in prayer that that that meeting would have significant importance and so if you'll pray for us we have did that meeting by live stream over the last two or three years and this will be our first time back there to do that so you would remember us in prayer that god would give us the strength to do it and he would help us to be able to do that and then we will come back and get home about midnight or about one o'clock actually when we get home um on tuesday morning and then we will once we get up and get ourselves shuffled back in the in the groove again on tuesday tuesday during the day we will travel to brother joe green's meeting brother joe greens is the missionary meeting that will be going on generally that it happens at that school many of you have been at that school but this year they are they're having it in their church and uh so i feel like it'll be much more powerful in the church uh than it would be at that great big school where the lights are in your eyes and everybody's scattered all over the place and and this one's scattered here and that one's scattered there and you can't see anybody in the building and uh you know sometimes it's a little more cramped in spaces and so you know we we kind of get used to our own luxury you know sitting with two seats beside of us and we're okay but you know it's it's okay to be a little bit crowded and so uh we're looking forward to that meeting we believe in brother donny reagan and myself will be speaking there and so i'd like for you to pray for us there as well as brother joe that is conducting the meeting and pray that god would just be with us in a special way then only a couple weeks from then or maybe four or five weeks from then we will be having our labor day meetings and and i'm sure we'll be we'll be full here but actually our church is probably much bigger than even branham tabernacle and so you can imagine the crowd sources there so amen so you remember those meetings brother tim pruitt brother timothy pruitt brother donnie reagan will be speaking in those meetings here for us and so there's a great things and and a lot more on our schedule and and uh we're we're just praying that god would just give us the strength to do it all of this is a miracle for me to be able to do it the doctors on monday and tuesday gave us a green light and we had very dif we had very difficult days with those those days and left some residue with us for the week and so we're just taking it one day by day and uh god gives us the strength to get through one day and then we'll we'll take tomorrow when it gets there and and here's the way i look at it if today's a bad day yesterday was pretty rough and i just figured well tomorrow will be better and it is and so we're certainly thankful for that today and so amen we love you we we certainly appreciate all the prayers from everywhere brother barry coffey uh checked in on me this morning just before coming to the pulpit and said he just felt led to pray for me and so we we're thankful for that that god would call on men to to to have prayer for us and this morning kind of has an incredible significance for for me myself as i watch this as it begin to come together it will have some significance for this church and there's a song that kept coming to me and and i i'm no i'm no singer so i'm just going to kind of say it to you if that's okay and it says some through waters some through the blood you might find that song some through the fire but but all through the blood some through great sorrow and god gives us a song in the night season all the day long versus in shady green pasture so rich and so sweet god leads his dear children along where the water's cool flowing bathes the weary one's feet god leads his dear children along second verse sometimes the mount where the sun shines so bright god leads his dear children along sometimes in the valley the darkest of night god leads his dear children along through sorrows bewellness and evil suppose god leads his dear children along through grace we can conquer defeat all our foes god leads his dear children along away from the mire and away from the clay god leads his dear children along a way up in glory eternity's day god leads his dear children along did we not find it some through waters some through flood some through the fire but all through the blood some through great sorrow but god gives a song in the night season and all the day long amen amen in that sermon brother branham preaches what is the attraction on the mountain and there was a man sitting there that had great significance to this church and that man was thomas brady thomas brady was sitting there not knowing too much about brother branham but he had a letter in his pocket from sister brady and that that letter was that she was having trouble with her feet and she wasn't able to work and and many of you know they were working kind of almost like indentured slaves at that point in jamaica and and they were working for a very wealthy wealthy family that actually built a home like the old slaves would do and they built it like that and actually had people working for him kind of in that same order mother tom and sister brady was there gloria was there she was a priceless lady uh they they'll probably watch this service because they watch them brother tom is now is as now his mind is a little slipping you know sometimes i feel like mine's slipping a little bit but uh but anyway brother tom was working there and he would come to america about once a year and he would come to america and brother henry greene was was taking care of him and they took him they actually took him to jeffersonville and and so he would tell us the story many times standing in this pulpit how that hundreds and hundreds of people would wait outside and with the doors would open at one time they'd all run in and he said it was the most unchristian thing he'd ever seen and they would run in and the first night he he would get set in the back or the first day he would get set in the back and and then the next day he got to sit up a little bit closer and he had he had in his pocket uh a letter from sister brady about and she had asked him when you're with the minister would you would you have them to pray for me and he had not had nobody to pray at this point and he's sitting there with that with that letter in his pocket and brother brother branham is going to speak what is the attraction on the mountain and he says what is the attraction it's jesus fulfilling his word and i'm just going to preempt this just for a minute because that's the way it feels to do it and just preempt his word and that's what he's doing again today he would say it was god on the mountain with noah and it was god on the mountain with moses and it was it was god on the mountain in a burning bush and it was god on the mountain with mount carmel and it's been god on the mountain with the sword and he was taking people from a historical reference to prophecy being fulfilled and he and and i'm going to read the text in just a few moments but he said what was prophecy now is fulfilled and what he's going to say about revelations 10 what was prophecy is fulfilled and let and i want to go even further than that so many people want to point to a cross but jesus ain't on the cross [Applause] that's where he was at but if you want to know where he is at here he is what you are experiences of the bride's revival or the appearance of him in bride form a people that didn't wash themselves but a word came to wash them to prepare them to get them ready you are the attraction on this hill [Applause] now i want to link some things together before i preach so please don't count this time together for me when we think about where we are you didn't put yourself here god put you here well i tell you what i made a choice to be here did you you didn't make a choice to be born but i would agree with someone who said it the other day every seed has the right to be born every seed has a life to be born [Applause] brother homer brought us up on this hill this hill was was full of trees he said we're going to put a church here i have to be very honest with you i didn't see it but god had showed him many of you a lot of you are new but many of you worked hard on this hill cutting this is a beautiful hill here now but many of you worked extremely hard cutting trees stumps all different kinds of things heavy equipment came and began to work and this building was built in about a year many of you labored very hard on this hill and there's a light that shines out there with a cross on it and this place has represented the lighthouse sitting here on this hill this building has been dedicated for worship and as andrew said last night we preached the message here and let me just say this to you the message is the bible i started preaching early to gabriel this morning this message is the bible we're the most fundamental believers that there is on the earth we believe the bible we have an open book the author of the book opened the bible for us it's like netanyahu sit there before all those men and said here is our title deed to israel this god gave us this land i want to stand with passion in my heart this is our title deed to be the bride of jesus christ hallelujah i like it that way too don't you i think sometimes we have a lack of appreciation of even what we have one day this place will be a vacant sinner it'll slip right into a tribulation period and they won't even know it but it'd be vacant we won't need it no more i'm afraid people take for granted that this is the way that will always be but it won't be like this forever it just won't be like this this will be i think we lack the appreciation of maybe not even knowing the cost of what it took to get to this spot lots of people want to be where you're at but they don't want to pay the cost to get there many refuse to commit commitment sometimes is takes a little skin sometimes it takes life life commitment you don't believe that just wait till you end an event and about two or three or you're standing there to clean up everybody enjoys the event i'm one standing before you here maybe no other preacher has stood where i stand but i am committed just because that god chose for me to have this journey don't mean that i quit and i walk away just because that i go like monday and tuesday and i continue to be told every day is a miracle so enjoy that day i would say that every time that i preach to you is a miracle so enjoy that service we're on a mission i won't don't want us to lose focus don't get tied up in drama of your own family's humanity it's just stuff it's just stuff whatever you have in life your house your home your cars whatever you've got all of that stuff and it's temporary don't get tied up in all of the nonsense of life jobs and situations and just family faces you know just get above that just raise above that when there storms that pilot just pulls the lever back and he raises the plane that eagle what he does it just raises himself above the storm many men have quoted this great men if you hear i died don't believe it i will be more alive than ever before you've heard me say from this pulpit never ever ever ever give up and every time the doctor tells me every day is a miracle i believe that within my heart because satan swore that i would not live to see this day sometimes in the darkness of your life god's working you know we don't orchestrate these services but sometimes you don't see he's working but he's working he's working there's a lot of distractions that'll come your way jobs homes situations of life flat tires but come your way there's a lot of miserable people around you miserable people want to make you miserable hurt people want to make you hurt hater only breeds hate and it fights to hate you it's a it's a life mission to destroy you maybe it's because of jealousy well listen if you ever want to get ahead in life work i i know it's a four-letter word but work work not everybody are talented to be able to get on a team and they've got ultra talent but i find that a lot of talented people are lazy and just like coaches they can see past the talent and see the lazy part so they'll choose an individual that'll work double as hard and they'll pick that one because when nobody's looking they're working i'm going to preach now when nobody's looking and there's nobody screaming their names and there's nobody applauding them they're running they're weightlifting they're you you're doing their technique and even in spite of that sometimes the coach will have to cut them i said well but does that make you quit life no it makes you get back up and say i'm going to try again i'm going to try again satan anoints people that are driven to tear you apart but i want you to remember who anoints them and the god that's greater in you is greater than it's in every one of them so you just set your wings a little bit higher now i want to say something before i even read my text here stupid people will do stupid things you just don't have to lower yourself to their standard can the whole congregation say amen so what we do is we keep our focus we overcome we are on a mission we're taught to have self-control we're sealed with the holy ghost and satan can't get to that gene seed that's on the inside of you and god put an armor around you and you have the spoken word of life and the power of life and death is in your tongue brother ron but i'm surrounded by crazy people well let's just i'll give you a statement for the morning you can put it on your on your refrigerator the more i know about people the more i love my dog jesus said these words these things must be so we're given the challenge rise above it rise above it we're on a mission now you say well brother ron why did you give us this little exhortation before you started preaching i had a conversation the other day sitting with some brothers and brother vernon was there and he said something he said and this was something that brother homer had to fight for years people made fun of worship preachers made fun of worship didn't like how we worshiped here well let me just say this is still the house of worship it will always be welcomed here therefore i take that as a consolation let's stand to our feet this morning in luke chapter 19 and verse 33. luke 19 and verse 33. amen amen maybe you have a need on your heart you just would like to say lord come and touch me today come near my pew come where i'm at i have a need on my heart this morning i i need a touch from in my body and uh i just need him to touch me today lord jesus we love you with all of our hearts and we dedicate ourselves to you i've already said enough that we could dismiss and go home lord you've laid these words on my heart for this morning i ask you that you would anoint our hearts lord we've so enjoyed the worship we so enjoyed your presence now we ask you the lord that you would just come and do a work among us every hand that went up lord even my own body i i don't even want to describe i just i just i just know that you're the healer i know that you're greater than the effects i know that you're greater than every situation i pray that you touch your children even now father we as a group of believers we're not looking for pity we're just taking you at your word and we're marching onward we got a sword in our hand help us today strengthen us father for this hour in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and amen amen god bless you god bless you turn to your neighbor and say let's have church as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why ye lucy the colt and they said the lord hath need of him and they brought him to jesus and they cast down their garments upon their coat and they set jesus there on and as he went they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen and they began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice with all the mighty works that they had seen they began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen hallelujah blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the pharisees from among the multitudes said to him master rebuked thy disciples and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out i want to say this you i don't want no stone i don't want no stone to cry out in my place and when he was come near he behold the city and wept over it saying if thou had us known even thou at least in this day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for the days shall come upon thee that thine eyes shall cast a trench about the incapacity round and keep thee in every side and they shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation you may be seated today in the name of the lord may bless his word this text has been written read millions of times men have stood as we recognize listen jerusalem with all of their prophets and all of their men of that day most holy men they were not recognizing the king was allowing them on this day to worship him this was going to be a mass worship millions of people would be in that city the city would be moved that jesus was coming he was fulfilling multitudes of scripture as he was riding into jerusalem this would be an entry that would seem triumphant listen folks boaz himself was riding off of the hill the redeemer was riding off of the hill the coming king was riding off of the hill that day on a cult the fall of an ass the son of man was riding off a hill he was greater than any feeble man he was greater than any angel that was in heaven this man would be tore apart that the covenant of the earth between god and man he would tear him apart for me and you let me just say even to this this church jesus will never be just one of the boys the reason they took up stones to stone him he said i and my father are one and by saying that he represented they were not trinitarian and the jewish they were not trinitarian they didn't see him as three gods or three separate persons when he said i am him they knew that their churches had missed his coming he did not have their calling cards and he did not have their representation and so they had to crucify him sometimes that's what the modern churches do today brother andrew didn't have this at his disposal but in saskatoon when the meeting was set up for brother branham to be there the churches in the local area the so-called pentecostals and the latter round movements told their people not to come to the church not to go to that huge facility where brother branham was going to be preaching but do you know all those preachers went about 300 people sat in that place brother gunther was one of those preachers that was there but he wanted his congregation to be there brother gunther's church out of all of those ministers but the garther's church raised up to believe that god had sent a prophet brother kelly hill de brant his church is now the that church not regressed but progressed but that church still holding the banner high are you with me now are you with me brother vernon's father many many of you father grandfather great grandfather he went to the church here he went to the the armory where brother branham would preach and and brother branham would stand there and preach preach seven different sermons if my mind serves me correct one of them being as an eagle stir that's nest and that's one that's popular but anyway and then uh god's projected love and so i hate i hate nats they're not real tasty it flew in i didn't want to leave i'm just going to call your name brother vernon is a representative family sister francis your father he went to that meeting and said in that meeting and watched brother branham and he and he was not against brother branham yet there was preachers all through the area that was against and warning people not to go to that meeting it snowed during that week it was a it was a difficult place a difficult time and to even get to the meeting but it was a packed place and and so brother branham would be there to preach no way that your father could have the mind eye to see a church like what we have today and as he sat there listen to the prophet of god speaking maybe with his broken kentucky language and the message going forth listen he came to this area a lot of people had chances at the word a lot of people had chances at the word but let me just say this to you here he was as a representative and now his son would raise up to speak this this truth to preach this truth and he was reading other material and and a brother handed him the message of the hour and he grabbed a hold of it he grabbed a hold of that message and he began to he began to read it and said this man is preaching what i believe what's in my heart this man believes in worship doesn't take away from the word of god and his eyes became open and he began to build a church here we are today and it's around the world that this this has went our brother here he got a hold of the message in a refugee camp now he sets here on our platform today his wife is in minnesota with her family taking care of the little child but let me just say this you god knows how to lead us in many different directions god leads us along sometimes we get the idea that this is the way it's always been i was sharing with andrew i hope i'm not going to steal any thunder here but i was sharing with andrew at the late season of the harvest it comes at time to where that they they throw the seed and the shuck in the air and they throw it in the air and they pick a windy day because the wind blows the chafe away and so they throw it in the air and they throw it in the air and they throw it in the air and they throw it in the air and they just keep throwing it in the air and there's a reason for that it's because the wind of the cares of life they'll blow you they'll move you but real seed just keeps falling back down and you can't shake a real seed you can't shake a real seed of god you came from god and you're going back to god i'm not saying this in no direction but you will never end this life change a goat into a sheep but you'll spend a whole lot of time working on goats and maybe there's a devil in sheep's clothing and once in a while you'll see the pastor wherever they're at have to destin to find out if it's a devil we don't have that problem here hallelujah thank the lord thank you jesus well brother ron i want to know this in this situation i want to know that situation in this situation i sung the boys a song this week mind your own business oh won't you mind your own business mind your own business and you won't be mined in mine save you a whole lot of trouble save you a whole lot of trouble i just gave you a sermon right there within a little song that needs to be sung in a lot of places amen that might keep down people wanting me to come preach for them so now let's just remind you who jesus is the scripture says that go ye therefore and teach all nations and baptize in them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost those were titles they were not names unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace all of those are titles but his name is the lord jesus christ when you say wonderful he is wonderful when you say counselor he is counsellor when you say he's the mighty god he is the mighty god when you say everlasting father he is the everlasting father when you with what so therefore when you teach and and go into all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and the and of the holy ghost you must baptize them according to acts chapter 2 and verse 38 repent and be baptized every one of you none excluded every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins you must revoke the jurisdiction of satan off of you that he no longer holds the title to your deeds anymore [Applause] now let me just say this to you well brother on we come to church we sit we sit like church mices we sit like a bump on a log why should we be happy that alone that satan don't hold our title deed anymore it's enough to rejoice about i'm no longer a slave i'm no longer a prisoner he don't own me no more i've been bought by price jesus signed my pardon i'm free we can see the characteristics of god we can take let me just take you through the bible for a moment we can see him in creation when he said let there be and her son brother branham explains how he spoke it and son came into existence and then off of the sun clinkers of of balls began to roll and he would stop them at a certain spot god was writing his first bible and if you remember when god's writing his first bible he does everything in order because when he's talking to abraham down here and he told him he said count the dust of the sand that's your natural seed he's talking to a man that is childless and he tells him said look up can you count the stars of the heaven that's god's first bible that's what enoch built the pyramid off of that was god's second bible and when you look up that represents me and you and if god put us there there's not a devil in hell that can shake us from that position if you can ever get it that you're not holding yourself here some of you that are moody to speak to you some of you that are melancholy some of you that are up and down one day one day you meet them they're on top of the world they're sailing in the brightness blue skies the next day you meet them they're in the mud pits down in the slum come on church some of you were around me yesterday you didn't you couldn't tell that i was sick you couldn't tell that i i was having a real rough day god's greater than the rough days if you could just realize you're not the one holding on oh brother ron i'm going to fall at that one false boy you ain't going to be here long i'm glad that i'm not dependent on even sister connie and i thank god she's not depending on me remember that wind if you don't have the seed inside of it the wind will blow you away we can see him in the power of his creation we could see him in a cradle how he got there how he arranged the whole sequence of events mystery of his birth even the stars aligning we can see him in disasters how did he preserves you and i in the disasters of life through difficulties the difficulties of the very deep shadows that we have to go through god's not just the god of good times he's also the god of very difficult times don't never blame god for the difficulties don't never turn on god it's an enemy that comes to kill to steal and to destroy might be a beautiful place if you would look but don't you worry she's going to change in just a few days we're headed toward a lawless society to where they don't want police officers anymore they're going to get their wish they don't want real judges as a matter of fact there's a there's a law on the books right now that they're going to vote on to do away with all presence did you hear about that this week it's on the books this week they're going to vote on that this week do away with all prisons now those in prison want to get out but they ain't good people they ain't good people they are there because they did something wrong can you imagine what the tribulation is going to be like so don't you cross your arms and get defenses against me i'm not preaching to you politics i'm telling you get ready to leave this world [Applause] brother branham says and after he reads the revelations 3 that's to him that overcometh you've got some time today nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love to understand that this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted 120 years it's a message then it is to all generations in the span he says now history just keeps repeating itself and in the generations of israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next third generation the embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth generation maybe no vistage whatsoever of the original flame so that would mean paul would not even recognize his own church in about third or fourth generation or martin luther wouldn't recognize his own church in about a hundred years or john wesley now my mother was a cheerleading uh she was a queen of auburn high school beauty but she was a cheerleader and my daddy liked her looks my daddy was a pentecostal boy and and and he took her to a to after three years of dating he took her to a tent meeting where brother fulcher was in and they were having a shouting meeting she had been raised a dead methodist as quiet as it can be and so dad got converted and he said i guess i can't see you no more she said now hold on just a minute charlie you need to give me a chance at this word as i would watch my mom dance in the spirit of god and i saw her life since i was a little boy i was raised in a home where that home was filled with tape listening to it was a home to where we prayed it was a home to work dad would pray in the night and you could hear him speaking in tongues from the basement i still believe in it where it would break through my dad was not a wealthy man by no imagination my dad actually would if there was a an animal on the road a fox or whatever on the road or maybe a an animal to where we could take its skin off we would skin that animal so we can have gas money to go to church tomorrow night he was passionate about serving god he was passionate about believing this message you know that he believed it with all of his heart one of his greatest fears was the fire dying in the next generation and the next generation and the next generation because no man can hand off the fire no man can hand the fire off it isn't from generation to generation to generation every generation must have its own revival that's why i believe in youth meetings that's why i believe in promoting what andrew is doing here in this church that's why i believe that you youth have to have your own experience with god my mother one of the last meetings that she went to she went to a church that was supposed to be a message church but it was dying it was a song that was sung my mother danced she danced that night and one of the deacons came and set her down my mom called me after service i wasn't there she called me after service it was in north carolina she called me after service and they don't no longer believe the message but she called me and said said they set me down i wasn't doing anything wrong and i said mom it wasn't them people they don't want that but god wants it i want to remind you and it was only months before she is to pass and go beyond that veil of tears and i said mom i want you to know this we will never set you down [Applause] here's where i want to go there's too many morgues too many preachers that can get a computer and can take an intellectual id and produce churches but they're only producing dead seat that's not what this message is about when it comes to worship it's more than just just singing a song or playing and i'm not talking about rock and roll music i'm talking about real worship jesus wanted on his on his first entrance into jerusalem he wants it right now because the scripture says that he inhabits the praises of his people [Applause] i want to be extremely cautious here because i don't want nobody to think i got a bad attitude toward people but i want to tell you this there's a reason a lot of people can't worship god because they don't have freedom they're still slaves they're still slaves and they haven't got over themselves i know this is going in a whole lot of directions there's a lot of times that preachers can't preach this because they ain't got it and a lot of people that want a clean fish really can't catch fish and you there's a real secret to this you gonna lack is there's a real secret to this the reason a lot of churches are not growing is because they haven't learned how to fish and you can't clean fish until you catch them [Applause] well brother ron we want everything in order okay okay well i i just so happened to i would have loved to been there when jesus was there joe wouldn't you like to bend there when he's walking up the hill and as he's walking up the hill people are getting healed of paralytic conditions cancers let me just say there ain't nothing that the green bay ball game could have been more louder than those people getting healed of cancer and told their sins are forgiven you can now go free and then bartimaeus he knew he had to get louder than all of them so he began to scream because this is his only chance at the word and he began to scream thou son of david have mercy on me have mercy upon me i don't want to be blind no more have mercy upon me i heard about what you'd be like when i was sitting on my mother's lap i heard you was coming it's my opportunity to praise you it's my opportunity to rejoice with you so a woman goes to she hears jesus is at a house to where he's not welcome and so she looks at the event and ain't nobody washed his feet nobody's giving him a new robe nobody's put perfume on him she says i'll do it i'll do it and she went and got all of her money not half of it you ain't got all oh oh god wants all your life he don't want you to serve him and serve all the gods of the world he wants all of your life and when she come in the anointing of god hit her and she began to cry and those tears began to fall down on his feet it don't matter how he was sitting it matters that she was crying she didn't have a towel but she took her hair brother brown said you pentecostal women would have to that's cut your hair you'd have to stand on your feet on your head the smell of that manure got in her hair the smell of jesus got on him that's what happens here sometimes the smell of jesus gets on us the smell of jesus gets on us now brother branham had to contend with some of these spirits he says this in samson the philistines be upon thee the communists of someone the world is upon thee the devil is upon thee they go back and they see the spirit of god perform miracles and do things of his resurrection what jesus promised and they say you know i think brother branham got a lot of mental telepathy my pastor said that's of the devil you poor hypocritical deluded infidel all polished up you're a wolf in a sheep's clothing jesus said if you'd knowed me you'd have known my day but you've got a bunch of souls that try to make you like the rest of the world we want a bunch of men of god who don't compromise on the word but preach the truth and stand on the baptism of the holy ghost but what the world has done it's it shaved off all of your power off you were born nazarene or pentecostal but the world certainly shaved your power off it's just as starchy as the rest of them and and water what are we going to do what's going to happen there's one glorious thing that we can think of at the end of this text while samson was bound and he said we can't have revival listen to brother billy graham revival is over in our day revival in our day the rest of them revival in our day how can we have a revival when we're bound thought about your sermons over the last couple of weeks he said we're bound the holy spirit within our organizations and traditions we can't have the holy ghost revival i know that's scorching in hot weather but but it's the truth how can we have the holy ghost revival when you're so bound and starchy a form of godliness the bible said they'd have a form of godliness but deny the power the power of what the power of organization the power of the world the power of the church the power of the holy ghost that's the secret place in the church and when the church adopts educated preachers big buildings finery in the state of old-fashioned holy ghost they would be better off in a mission again how how are you going to have a revival of the holy ghost and people quench it this is our prophet how can you have a revival i'm not just talking about for this building and buildings around the world i'm talking about persons quench it bound and afraid of it that's where the trouble lies the philistines is on thee but the blessed one give us hope while samson was in jail what's the first thing that they'd done they caught the secret they bound him they took his power away they found his secret they found your secret and the world found your secret you women you bob your hair it's just like the rest of the world you mean go around and act like the world tell jury jokes go out smoke a few cigarettes and run around with your neighbors wives and everything else like that have a little social drink to hold your job i'd rather lay on my belly and eat soda crackers and drink branch water and stay clean and pure before god than to compromise on any kind of a job that's right that's true branham tabernacle worley is this creeping in among you what about you have you exposed your secret have you exposed the secret that god gave you when you were wallow into the sawdust a few years ago have you let it sleep slip out by social formal worship what's happened to you god can come down and perform a miracle and go right down through the audience and tell people the secrets of their heart and everything heal the sick and the afflicted do signs and wonders and preach the gospel as hard as they can by the holy spirit and people say well i guess that's all right we enjoy listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired brother branham was dealing with that in 1959 how much more as that spirit wants to escalate it's not going to stay in the pentecostal hole in this movie let's move right into the bride social form of worship social form of worship wants to calm the holy ghost down let me just say this you if that's trying to get on you shake it off when used to be the preaching of the word the old saints with tears in their eyes would rise in their feet walking sobbing maybe not saying a word just walking around two or three times it's set down so filled with the holy ghost the word fed them man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god remember when jesus came down off of that mountain those people got under a spirit and they began to worship with all their heart there was an anointing that hit them they pulled down the palm branches they throwed their clothes in the way there was an anointed same group will be screaming crucify him in a few days but god's anointing hid them and they began to worship him preachers came and said don't do that tell them not to do that tell them rebuke them for worshiping you and jesus said if i do the rocks will cry out brother homer's favorite sermon from brother branham was amnesia was a reason why he had i spent a lot of personal time with him he preached to me about every day there was a reason that that sermon was his favorite sermon as he saw the modern pentecost forget where they came from they came from a movement to world that bullets being shot through the windows and women dancing in the holy ghost bullets falling off of their dresses people continued but worley is in god among them so much so that brother branham would never be welcomed back in those kind of assemblies but i've said it now and i'll say it again as long as i live brother branham's message is always welcome in this pulpit why should we worship we have found our future home we have found our theophany in this word we have found the open book we see where we are we're the blood washed the redeemed bride of jesus christ we stand as our wedding garment is placed upon us we're washed by the word of the lamb the creeds and dogmas of denomination has been washed away from our lives we've had to repent of a lot of things in our lives but that's a zeal of this hour repent from false doctrines for repent from false leadings allow ourself to get clean now you say well what does that mean brother iran there's always spirits in the earth and you'll be attached to certain spirits and that's like a little spirit of lust to get on a man or a woman bad as a in this day as it is anyway but they'll begin to kind of begin to look at a little pornography before long a little spirit ignites and that's the only thing that they relish during the day it's just to get back to that little pornography get back to the little point and that little pornography will become video after a little while and after a while their mate won't satisfy them preaching to you their mate won't satisfy them because they are not going to do what and before long they're chasing the wrong kind of a woman and they never thought they'd be there they never thought they'd have illicit illicit acts outside of their marriage vows they never thought they'd get there but sin takes you further then you ever thought you would go and before long you wake up in the wrong bed [Music] that's what happens in churches that's what happens in churches before long it's all right to sit still dead before long you don't have time to pray before long you don't have a breakthrough in your life and so all of a sudden you see everybody else rallying and you go what's going on because you didn't keep your focus don't blame your neighbor don't blame the one across the hill you didn't keep your focus we're gonna get on a plane wednesday now i cannot just get up in the morning connie fixed me bacon and eggs sit there and enjoy the morning bacon and eggs and enjoy it and drink i'm not drinking much coffee now but i can't just sit there and drink my my little whatever i'm drinking and just drink that down and go well maybe we ought to head over to the charlottesville and get on a plane you got your bags packed well there's a few more things i need to pack well well it's packing so we pack it up and we get it in the car we put it in the car i'm doing something here i get it in the car and i go around and i park in charlottesville and i walk in and i go i'm ready to fly that baby's gone that baby's gone i'm not prophesying your connie that baby's gone you're supposed to been here at 6 30. actually we called you at six o'clock and we called your name over and over and over again a lot of people in churches like this one are doing just that the rapture has been told about us for decades don't say i didn't hear it your mind was listening somewhere else and you were worshiping this and this and this and that and you missed the king there was a lot of people busy getting a wife and getting getting a plow on the field and doing a lot of different things or getting a house and they missed the king don't miss the king i actually listened to brother tim pruitt three times last week three times he preached it sunday morning and i listened to it three times brother tim sermon was somewhere around over just over two hours he'll be coming here and at labor day we know what he is before he comes here we love the word people can go to cracker barrel and sit for two and a half hours [Applause] we begin to talk about bypassing our theophany bypassing bypassing being born again and raised up through your parents just to become adult again to become 18 years old again bypassing that you made a statement that just kept resounding in my heart he said maybe there's some among you maybe some of your family that you want to see them saved said try to get them saved before the rapture because after the rapture the grace will leave the gentiles and go to the go to the jews and if they're not saved now they'll never get saved i just said a real important thing and you're standing there in your young body and your loved ones will see you in that young body it'll be their only opportunity to see you in that young body and hopefully it will give them enough strength to give them strength to get through the tribulation period and maybe give their lives for it you think about what grace and strength will be we preached this message for decades now i've been preaching since 1984 for decades now and now we're coming to an end we're standing on the very cliff of the end coming right there how many people are sitting in pews like that and they sit there for decades listen it's coming and while others were worshiping i don't want to be one of those that missed it i preached this in 2003 in lima ohio i don't know many any of you heard it also and i preached it just before in the autopsy of a dead church at billy andrews thanksgiving camp meeting i think that's before recordings but i used this quote in 1965 brother branham says he said a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church wanted these screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 2 38 youngans around her she don't wanted them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately be put out of her denomination they had one back like in their churches while they'd throw her out real quickly why are you letting such of this going on you see she's pregnanted with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks that they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth andrew was preaching a meeting in ohio and it was overheard by several people as andrew is preaching in ohio at a camp meeting that a lot of things are going on a preacher said it in the meeting and he said that guy's just like his daddy i'm proud of andrew but i couldn't give this to andrew but he met the same pillar of fire that i met a long time ago those screaming shouting acts 2 38 miserable creatures i'm one of them [Applause] now i wanna i wanna one of the most precious pictures that hangs in my office is this picture hangs at home this is brother branham standing on the top of a pulpit top brother random got excited he jumped up on the top of the pulpit my understanding more than one time jumped on top of the pulpit got to speaking in tongues and was was waving his feet backwards and forwards when he came to himself he was down in the middle of the aisle going around and around speaking in tongues that's my prophet [Applause] my understanding is brother branham and after the church was over with a lot of times he'd have his coat going like this outside the building that's my prophet you don't believe that he was up on a mountain and he got to worship in the lord and he was going around the tree speaking in toms animals was watching him that's my prophet [Applause] if you're in a hurry this probably ain't the meeting you want to be in a hurry for i i got a little bit more to go if i can do this with fourth stage cancer how about you the doctor said dr timmons looked at me the other day and he said we look at your x-rays he said you got all kind of cancer in there let me just say i don't care if it feels completely up with cancer god's greater than that he'll take those dead cells and breathe through those dead cells and i'll stand here and preach the word of god to you as long as i got breath in my lungs you guys are pentecostal yes sir acts 2. none of us here have ever been in a modern pentecostal church so you can't accuse us of that we got this from the message this worship came from the message this music came from the message [Applause] i'm going to send you a letter this week brother ron i got a trash bin for that oh i got a trash bin for that block and delete are two great weapons i can prove anything that's without emotion is dead this is a prophet so your religion hasn't got any emotion in it bury it somewhere and get one that's got life in it well brother branham that's emotional it's just emotional well i can scientifically prove to you that anything without emotion is dead so if your religion hasn't got any emotion to it bury the thing because it's no good it's dead i've had brothers tell me said we need to take the emotion out of it well take the emotion out of your marriage take the emotion out of your marriage and get yourself a mannequin i ain't gonna stay long here too many people carnal i ain't staying too long here god ain't marrying no mannequin he ain't coming back for pictures on the wand paint's in your library if birds praise the lord and cows praise the lord and every animal praises the lord and the creatures in the sea praises the lord he's gonna marry a wife that's going to worship him hallelujah oh everywhere jesus says there's a lot of noise where god is makes a lot of noise i don't know why it is but they do anything without noise without emotion is dead i'm taking my time so you get it that's scientific and if your religion has got little no emotion in it you need to bury it i have read you just only a few of quotes of the prophet of god i don't need to read you the hundreds that is there can i read you one more anything that's alive has emotion and anything that doesn't have emotion is dead and excuse the expression but i think it all we ought to bury some of this emotionless religion because it's dead it has no emotion to it anything that has not emotion should be buried because it is emotional the new birth oh listen you can get the birth without the emotion but let me just say emotion comes with it emotion comes with it speaking in tongues comes with it seeing visions comes with it dreaming dreams comes with it anointed to worship comes with it everything that hath breath praise ye the lord [Applause] i don't know about you but i tell jesus every day how much i love him every day i try to do it before that i even speak it to anybody else because he's my king i
