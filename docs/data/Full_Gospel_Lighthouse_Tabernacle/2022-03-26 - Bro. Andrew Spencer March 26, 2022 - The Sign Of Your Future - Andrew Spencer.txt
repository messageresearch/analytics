over this service father we declare that you're here we sense the moving of the holy spirit and we're asking father lord for a work that only you could do in the name of jesus christ amen amen if you ever bibles this this evening we'd like to look over in the book of exodus chapter four and then to hebrews chapter one exodus chapter 4. say amen when you have it this evening amen and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod and he said cast it onto the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it and the lord said unto moses put forth on hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they might believe that the lord god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was a leprous as snow and he said put thine hand in thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh brother branham would draw our attention right here and say look it's divine healing and it shall come to pass that if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass that if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take out of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land hebrews chapter 1 and verse 1 we're also thankful to have brother thomas frazier back in the house of the lord this this evening after his surgery there he's he's there in the back so we're just we're mindful that he's here and we're certainly thankful that the lord has brought him through and amen hebrews chapter 1 god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the pro fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the majesty on high may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to take a thought this evening on on this on this subject from these from these texts here i'd like to take a subject this evening on the sign the sign of your future the sign of your future and brother branham would say that that we find out he said the burning bush was a sign it was it was given to attract the attention of moses and he said that's what god gives a sign for is to attract the attention of the people again he would say the burning bush was given to moses to attract the runaway prophet's attention and he turned aside to see what it was then the sign gave a voice the sign itself gave a voice now now these voices and signs are to alert to the people of god's word it's just about ready to be vindicated always a sign is to attract the attention the attentions of the people now many of you bible readers here and are thinking now are different passages in the bible and we're going to come to some of them he said but when a sign is given it attracts the attention of the people because god is getting ready to speak notice what he says he said he wants an audience he wants an audience he wants somebody that's going to listen to what he's going to say now he always does that his word alerts them the sign is an alert to attract the people to to to attract the attention of the people that the word is getting ready to speak and every time that you begin to see god move he doesn't move without a purpose whenever god moves he is doing it to bring about and vindicate his purpose and bring about and vindicate his word and we realize that that here was the pillar of fire that moses moses that was a shepherd out there on those mountain hills he'd been out there for 40 years and run away run away from the things that he knew he grew up in the laboratories of science of down in egypt he knew all of those things and had great had a great time down in in egypt but yet something was pulling him out into out into another world on the backside of a desert and there his attention was attracted to a bush that was on fire but notice it was not that the bush was on fire maybe he'd seen a bush on fire before but this bush was not consumed and there was something that was drawing him the attention of the prophet notice attention of the prophet to go up there on that mountain and see what this was about and when he turned aside to see then god began to speak unto him and notice it's whenever people begin to turn their attention away from the world and turn their attention onto god that god begins to speak to them but when you keep your mind on the things of the world god will not necessarily come down to you yet he's obligated to speak to you and he's obligated to move by your way but if your mind and your attention is on laodicea you'll miss what he's doing right here in the midst in the midst of the congregation but moses was attracted to a sign that was taking place up there brother branham said that that pillar of fire was assigned to the prophet he said and notice a sign has got a scriptural voice behind it but he would also say that a prophet is a sign is it right a prophet is a sign and we believe that we are living in an hour that we have received a sign to this generation but notice this sign that was coming that was there before moses moses said he'd recognize who he was he recognized that he was run away he'd recognize the certain things in his life that were leading him out of egypt things that were that they were not laying there that he couldn't get out of himself but there was something that god had put there before the foundation of the world it was a word that was attracted to the word and when you begin to see the word in this hour it began to attract you to the word and they didn't attract you to luther's message this word of this hour didn't attract you to wesley's message but the word of this hour attracted you to the last day message and notice what has attracted you has the ability to get you out of every chaos of laodicea and notice what was attracting moses his attention up there it had the ability to be able to get him out of the trouble and get all of israel out of the trouble that they were in notice what that voice said he said i am coming down to deliver notice that pillar of fire he was bred the pillar of fire was reminding moses notice what the voice was saying he was reminding moses about the promise to abraham he was reminding him that he was that he was a part of abraham's seed he began to tell him i remember what i told abraham i remember when i told him that his seed would sojourn in a strange land notice what the pillar fire was doing it was reminding him of the promise and the pillar of fire was saying that i'm here because of the promise i want to say this and declare it unto you that the reason that the pillar of fire is still in the midst and still in the congregation of the church of the living god is because there's a promise here and notice god is always obligated to stick to his promise and i want you to know i found a quote the other day that brother branham said that god is guilty unless he brings his word to pass god is not going to let his word fall on the ground god will not be guilty of not neglecting one promise god will be guilty of bringing it to pass the reason why the son of man is in the midst of the church of the living god is because there's a promise people there's a chosen people there's an elected people that have decided they are not taking the way with the day we're with the way of the world but they have chosen to follow the way under the lord's despised few they're not worried about what laodicea is doing they're not worried about what russia is doing they're not worried about what's going over in the world in the middle east but they are concerned with a promise they are concerned about what's going to take place because it has attracted their attention this promise has moved them into a realm that only a prophetic eye would be able to take him into notice he said i am coming down to deliver he didn't say how he was going to do it but he was going to bring them out of egypt and he had heard their cries he'd heard their groans he heard their prayers notice he said brother brandon said they were only waiting on god and god was only waiting on them he had his prophet out there in the wilderness but he was only waiting for the people to call him into action notice they were waiting on god but god was waiting on them i would to god that there be somebody that would rise up in the middle of laodicea that said let god be god and let his word be the truth let every man be a liar god is going to have somebody that's willing to raise him into action to call him on the scene say god i still believe that you're still in the wonder working power business i still believe that you're able to heal i still believe that you're able to drive out cancer i still believe in the promises god's got somebody that's willing to move past their own self [Applause] moses had to get past his own self to me to me one of the greatest miracles we see that there was a sign there was one sign there was two signs there was three signs but the miracle that i see up there on that mountain was moses getting past his own reluctance and many times as you getting past your own flesh god don't want your flesh god don't want your flesh he's wanting your soul so that he can operate your flesh he's not worried about how big you are he's not worried about how little you are he's not worried about how smart you are [Applause] what did he take out there he took a bunch of illiterate disciples and he made a church of the living god out of them and he shut down the very gates of hell in front of the sanhedrin what is it god was not willing that their past would stand in their future he was not willing that they would go down as much just a bunch of fishermen he was not willing that they would go down it's just the people that walk with jesus he was wanting them to be known as a people that was walking and being in jesus hallelujah he's the same right now now notice notice when god shows he shows the phenomena and he attracts the attention of his prophet when the prophet got down there he showed the phenomenon notice it took in a phenomenal prayer to attract the attention of the prophet but when the prophet got down their egypt he showed them phenomena because he was god's voice how could a man pick up dust and throw and say thus saith lord and not even a not a flee in the country in a couple hours from then it's crowded full of fleas not a fly nowhere at all at all he'd say let there be flies and the first thing you know that big old blowfly began to fly around and they were bloating the people everywhere who what man could do that it was god using that prophet making his word a sign to give a call that we're going out of each now what what good sense would it make if god would just simply send them a prophet send them a sign if he didn't have an ability to get them out of their trouble what good would it have done for god to send william branham if he didn't have the ability to get us out of creeds to get us out of dogmas to get us out of stipulations of the world but he has an ability i say in the son of man there is an ability not just to get you out of each other but it gets you into the promised land [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't it was a man it was god using that prophet making his word a sign to give a call that we're going out of egypt he said now you're going to be my mouthpiece you go on down there and i'll be with you and when he got down there the promised word that he had promised was vindicated that was the voice of the son you remember when brother branham was up there in that cave and he meets that angel up there you remember i'm talking to message people ain't i i'm talking to a message church i didn't leave you all i didn't leave y'all y'all didn't turn into something else while i left did you i'm talking to a message church is that right you remember what that angel he told him he said just like the prophet moses was given two signs so shall you be received and you shall have two signs one will be a gifted a sign of the hand and the other will be able to discern the very secrets of the heart and you notice what was doing that it was not the man william branham it was something supernatural this was not some some seventh grade kentucky hillbilly a player that was dividing dividing perfectly dividing the word it was some intelligence up there it was an intelligence that was taking him through the scriptures it was an intelligence that was taking him through the promises aren't you thankful that that intelligence didn't leave us where we were but he's taking us to where we're going [Applause] this was not the intelligence of some man this was the intelligence of almighty god i happen to believe that he met that angel a prayer i happen to believe that those signs that were produced are the same things it's a voice behind those signs that's still in the church of the living god [Applause] notice when brother branham comes into the seventh seal he said now he said he said now he said you could he said you could up here on this platform he said there could be he said there could be trumpets laying over here he said a whole bunch of trumpets laying over here he said but he said he said it's not the man that's doing the work he's talking about the ministry he's not it's not the man that's doing the work he said but it's something on the inside of him that's making it come out of him he said you could take these trumpets he said all of them look the same all of them have the abilities he said but it takes an intelligence to be able to sound out to sound out the music of it it's not the man william brown it's not ron spencer it's not tim pruitt it's not donny reagan it's an intelligence behind it it's not myself he said it wasn't me he said i was just the body that it was you said i was standing close [Applause] he said it's what i surrendered myself to and you are now feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man what the church world is looking for is setting right in the heart of the church of the living god it's a sign it's a sign of your future a prophet's a sign we have the gentiles have received their last sign but you notice that something that is always on the question of people what about their future what what will come of them what what will their future be how how old will they be when they get married how how fat will they be will i live with this type of situation well well i have diabetes i don't know why fat got in there but it got in there hallelujah i'm not worried about how fat i am we got a statement around here if we can't be skinny we'll make our friends fat but it's all hallelujah that's not the safe the lord right there okay i understand that's me that's a safe answer right there but it's hard help me jesus but it's always a question on people's minds what about their future will i will i ever get married will i ever get delivered will i always go through this well with the same thing that my daddy died with well i die with that it's something it's something there in their future and i know there's a bunch of hocus pocus today that that you can go out on the street and somebody can read your palm and they they can they can have card readers they can you can lay your hand on a crystal ball and they can tell your future tell your fortune and they call them fortune tellers they call them mediums but you know that that medium or that fortune teller is asking you questions they're asking you questions to get things out of you to get things out of you so that they can give you an answer that'll make you happy i ain't never been to one i never had to be at one i never had to ask about what my future was by a palm reader or some fortune teller i had a book right here tell me what my future was so why should i pay good money to somebody that's going to tell me a lie or something that i'm telling them when i've got a book that's already told me what my future will be it says i will not be weak but i will be strong it doesn't say that i'll go down to feed it but it does say that i will be an invincible army it doesn't say that i'll be run over by the devil but it does say that i will smash the mouth for the enemy he said he'd be my adversary he'd be my advocate and he'd be an adversary to my adversary he'd be an enemy to my enemies he said i would not go in defeat he said i'd live it out i'd be this message she'd be bone of his bone life of his life power of his power [Applause] so if we're going to believe something why don't we believe a book that's never been wrong why don't we believe a book that's never failed why don't we believe a book has got promises about you there's more promises about you in this book than even jesus that even the disciples that were there in the old testament new testament you're laying right here in the foundations of the book what's the book about it's about a bride and a bridegroom well i'm gonna tell you right now he's a good groom he knows how to take care of his bride he ain't gonna leave you waiting down there on the altar he ain't gonna leave you down there you ain't gonna have to run away from him when he gets down there he's gonna be everything that you dreamed of he will be your sustainer you ain't gotta worry about him and his bank account he's got unlimited funds he's got unlimited power he's got a limited truth he's got health he's got strength [Applause] oh you ain't got to worry about your future with him you watch some young girls when they get married they don't know they don't know what their future is going to be like they don't know what kind of house they're going to live in whether they're going to be in a shannon they're going to be in a match some of you worry some of you some of you i know katie was worried lord have mercy she prayed all the way down altar and i was praying she wouldn't run away but some people get nervous some people get nervous when they're walking down the aisle but you ain't gotta be nervous walking down the aisle with the holy ghost he'll be your guide he'll be your sustainer he's your everything he's your all in all he can get you out of trouble he knows how to get you out of trouble when you make a mistake and you don't know how to get out of it he said i will make a way of escape under thee there's a lot of nervousness about futures western state is full of people that are nervous and anxiety full of anxiety about the future go just go do a study through the message on deep thinker that you're crossing bridges before you get there that it causes nervousness and condition causes stomach trouble that nervous condition causes stomach trouble which causes an ulcer notice go study those things he said you're always taking on somebody else's problems and we live in a world where ain't nothing but an age of neurotics you've got to have a bunch of narcotics to take care of the neurotics but there's a prophet would stand here he would say you you're a deep thinker you go through these things you're always crossing bridges before you get there you're anxious about these different things he said but if you'll believe me to be his prophet he said if you believe me to be his prophet will you accept his suffering that he took there on the cross for your perfect healing then you're going to walk away healed notice he was able to look into the past but he didn't leave him at their past he took them to their future notice this book holds your future it holds god's plans but it also holds satan's future notice what david would say in psalms 31 and 15 that my times are in my hand deliver me deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from them that persecute me brother branham said in shalom he said do as david did put your future in his hands he said don't look to anything else but david said here he said my time is in his hands he said my time is in his hand he's my rock what is he's revealed to me he is the revealed truth that my time is in his hands my time belongs to him i am in his hand because he holds the time he said i don't know what the future holds but i know that he holds the future so he that holds the future holds me he said i just put myself in his hands he said i walk like david did my time is in his hands he knew that god held the future he said but david didn't know what the future was but he know that god had the future and i don't know what the future is none of us do but we know who holds the future notice david said my time is in your hand to think about this that the times of your trouble are in his hands the time of your the time excuse me i went out to oklahoma it was 80 degrees one day and it's 30 degrees the next day and i did everything in the world but try to cough up a lung out there but notice david said my times are in your hands so times of prosperity were in his hands times of adversity was in his hands time of darkness was in his hands time of times of times of desertion and temptation were all in his hands now notice if all these things were in his hands surely our joy is in his hands our peace is in his hands our comfort is in his hands and if these things could be trusted over to the hand of the lord then why won't we allow our troubles to be in his hand notice all of our time is at the disposal of our good and faithful servant jesus christ so nothing can happen to you unless god allows it we are immortal in this world until our work on earth is done and satan can make all kinds of attacks against you he can destroy he can destroy your character he can try to destroy your mind he can try to destroy your reputation but we're not like the church of years gone by we're not living off of past reputations we're living off a future reputation that we're not going to be lived leaving left here like the rest of the rest of the cannon fodder but there's a world that's calling our name there's a world that's calling us to come up a little bit higher and satan can send his threats and satan can send his ideas but we've had a prophet we've had a prophet say that you're an invincible army that you're too powerful to be defeated satan will warf you hit war with you but my future is in his hands he'll make you sick and put you in a corner but god has my future the doctors can whisper all kinds of things but god has your future men can give up on you friends can walk away from you sickness can rob you but god has your future i don't know about what's going to happen god's got this god ain't shook up god ain't in surprise god ain't looking god ain't upset by who ain't in here and who ain't setting in their rightful place god knows where they're at god's gonna have a body and it won't be a freak body it won't be a hitless body he's going to have every part sitting at the members place you ain't got to worry about the pew besides you god's already got it figured out you said well i all this has got to happen that's got to happen and this has got to do this i got to lay my hands on them no you're putting god in a box you're trying to say god's got to do this before it can do that god's got your future god's got your family god's got your money god's got your health god's got your future i'm gonna preach with you and preach without you this evening but satan can do everything that he wants to do he can try to stop god's plan but god doesn't try to do anything when god says something he does it and god said that i am for you and there is no weapon that is formed against you that shall prosper i trust him with my life i trust him with my health i trust him satan can go around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but he ain't gonna get me he ain't gonna give me i got enough courage to look at devil in the face and said you lost the battle 2 000 years ago you will lose it again i got enough courage to believe that i am a part of this bride that the bride is a part of the group what's he doing what does that bride do over in the eastern countries when it's a wedding going on when it's a union going on she takes her veil and places it over on his shoulders and it's saying that he is now responsible for her i take her under my full control i will be her head i will beat her protector i will be there in the dark moments i will be there in the good moments i will be her power i will be her strength don't look ahead look up don't be crossing bridges before he get him look up he said my time is in his hands and just like a river just like a river out there that we drive past so many times that river that stream can never get higher than its source it's coming from somewhere it's coming from somewhere the stream can't get no higher than a source and you can't get no higher than your god you can't get no higher than the fountain so let me put it to you like this troubles can do what they want to but they'll never get higher than god sickness can do what it wants to but i never get higher than god your desires can do what they want to but they'll never get higher than god this ain't some legal agreements you've got with god saying god if you do this or god if you do that god's got an unconditional covenant with you notice this ain't a legal agreement between the husband she ain't got some prenuptial agreement that if you do this or i'll do that all the money's gone god ain't got some prenup set up for you this is a union it's a life it's a holy ghost he's the head we're the body i just simply choose to listen i [Applause] i ain't like somewhere some women that they're the neck of the head and they roll that thing everywhere they want to i wear the pants in the family brother if you've got to say you wear the pants in the family you don't wear the pants in the family i ain't turning him he's turning me he's got the whole world in his hands oh you just wait till he gets home early i show him something different oh no this is a union this is a love affair this ain't something that was set up in a lawyer's office this was set up before the foundation of the world and i got a promise for you god's not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you he'll be with you even in you to the end of the world grieve not you the holy spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption satan can do everything he wants to but the bible said jesus said when he was talking about the door he said i am i am the door and he said i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish look at the neighbors say paris i can't do it i can't fade away i can't move off of his promises i can't move off of him go ahead and elbow your other neighbor i can't move off of his promises he gave me eternal life i cannot perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hands oh somebody i want you to know you're not in the hands of a man you're in the hands of almighty god god gave you eternal life you cannot perish you cannot be defeated where were you job when i saw the sons of john sons of god shouting for joy i saw you i didn't see you down there living in laodicea going through misery going through criticism going through all those things so that you could come out on the other side just by the skin of your teeth i gave you a promise i saw you shout for joy and if god saw me shouting before the foundation of the world then that's just what i'm gonna do [Applause] you can't stand in my way devil i'm gonna shout if he saw me dancing i'm gonna dance if he saw me preaching i'm gonna preach say what you want to about me i was seen carrying this gospel that little boy right there hello seth martin he ain't a little boy no more he's becoming a man but the blood of a million bulls and goats could never pay for him they only covered him it only covered him but one drop of this blood one drop of this blood was once and for all it was settled in heaven god's got an agreement with you seth martin the blood covers you it only not only covers you but it covers your family history it covers your granddaddy's mistakes it covers your great granddaddy's mistakes and satan can lie to you all he wants to brother nathanael but god's already paid for you god's already made a way for you god's already seen you and god is an infinite god he's an omnipresent god he's an omnipotent god and if god saw me ain't no devil in hell going to make him unsee me [Applause] hey my father that owns a cattle in a thousand hills he paid for me he gave his own life for me he set his own blood for me and the devil ain't got enough funds to get me out of the god's hands [Applause] he ain't got enough funds to get me out of god's hands he can attack you and give threats he can prophesy your demise but you will not go down to feed it you got a sign you got a sign brother branham would preach a true sign overlooked and when jesus was walking on the shores of galilee they overlooked him they missed him but you've not missed him you've entertained him you've worshipped him you've said at his feet you said thou art worthy thou art worthy to be praised you're entertaining the one that set you free it's a sign it's a sign this ain't some man worship this ain't some prophet worship it's a king of king that you're worshiping you won't just get it finished here we will be doing it throughout the eternities of the eons of time i'm trying not to go there but i am worshiping him not i am worshiping him not because of what he got me out of i'm not worshiping him not of what he got me out of i'm worshiping him what he saved me from [Applause] my own choices got me in trouble my own choices let me down wrong roads my own choices but his election his election overrode my decision [Applause] [Music] even when i thought i wasn't worthy enough he said you will be my messiah in this world [Applause] you're a sign i'm not i'm not even going i i ain't got the five pages of notes but i i ain't gonna get to them all but you're a sign you're assigned to the rest of this dying generation that there is freedom in the kingdom of heaven there is liberty where the spirit of the lord is you're a sign and when the veterans when they were coming back from the wars they said that when they got up there and they got a pair of them harbors and they began to see that woman that was standing there with a torch in her hand they said that was a sign of their liberty they said everything that they loved was on the other side i want to say this to you there's a lady that's standing in this day she's an elected lady she's been chosen to stand in the harbor you can go and you can crash around her the waves can roll around her but she's got the fire of the holy ghost sitting at the throne room of her heart and it's a sign to lay out a seal that if he sets you free he can set your brother free he can set your wife free you are assad that whom the son is set free is free oh it's good to be free it's good to be free [Applause] you're a sign you're a sign brother brown preached signs of his time voice of the sign super sign the messiah signed and he would come down and he preached modern events made clear by prophecy i mean no we know that a sign points you either where you're going or where you're at it's what a sign does it points you where you're at or where you're going and we realize that that men of old they've seen the times by the prophet's prophecy abraham was led by a voice he'd heard that voice it said it said get apart get a party heard that voice said everywhere you look everywhere you look eastward westward northward every southward everywhere you look it's yours he wasn't just giving him that land so he had something to look at he was giving him some possession he didn't give you this message just so you can look at it he didn't give you this word so that you could look at it he'd give you a possession walk through this land have some troops go out josh walk through this possess it but abraham had heard a voice that told him that you're going to have a son and it won't be it won't be is me hell but it'll be a son and his name should be isaac he'd heard that voice all of his life he listened to that voice he told him that about a promised son he told him i'd be your seahawk he told him i'll be your buckler he heard it it was a promise to him but when melchizedek came it was vindicated that this was the time for isaac to show up and isaac was the fulfillment of what that voice had spoken jonah was a sign he was assigned to those heathens when he didn't want to go down there he didn't want to go down there and bust a bunch of layout of scenes and tell them that god's still safe he didn't want to go down there and a bunch of heathens and tell him that god could get him out of it he said oh brother brandon said oh don't make fun of him he said he wasn't backslid he was right moving right into the plane of god he said there's some people that make fun of him and call him backslidden telling me what say jonah wasn't a christian he said but they'll sit there in their pew and look at their symptoms and say well if god won't do it for me then i'm not gonna serve him but jonah got down there in the belly of that prepared fist for him and he said all these things are lying vanities you see he was moving right into the perfect plan of god's sign and he had to be swallowed by a prepared fist and it went to the bottom of the bottom of that sea but when he come out and he sowed his sign to those ninevites those ninevites worshipped that whale they worshipped that sea god and when they saw that man walk out of there it was a sign to them but they didn't just look at the sign they heeded the voice [Applause] john the baptist was a sign of preparation he was a sign of preparation that there's one coming after me he was a forerunner to the messiah there's a voice of one crying in the wilderness and john would stand there and say i indeed baptize you with water but the one that is coming after me is greater than me he will baptize you with the holy ghost and with the fire he was pointing to one that was coming john was a signpost to get ready but when jesus was standing there on the jordan river he wouldn't say he was coming he was saying that he's here notice what brother mayor said in super sign he said he said he said god showed abraham the end from the beginning of what was going to take place god manifested in a man his super faith son man that could destroy this son they that man could not destroy this son he said they could destroy isaac they could destroy jacob and successors after them but this super son this super son could not be destroyed abraham the seed of abraham this faith that not by it not the natural seed but the faith that abraham received not by a law of circumcision but by the faith in the word and abraham's super faith son which was jesus christ now all his other sons died but this son could not be killed he was killed but he couldn't stay dead and the grave couldn't hold him he's still the same yesterday today and forever notice when jesus was standing there he was standing there and he he would heal the sick he healed the blind he healed the blind of god he healed the lepers when he stood there and he took five loaves and fishes he blessed them and they broke them and they followed him they followed him for the sign but when the voice began to say that i and my father are one the voice changed their direction they were only following it for the signs now we know that the bible says in mark 16 that these signs shall follow them that belief well you guys ain't nothing but a bunch of sign followers you know some it's a funny thing what jesus said right there he said these signs shall follow them everywhere i go on monday they follow me on tuesday they follow me [Applause] i have received my son it is the son of man again in body form these signs shall follow them that belief and if we are preaching a message doctrine it'll produce message works if we approach it if we're preaching john 14 12 that the works that i do shall you do also then these signs will follow you he said have faith in god speak unto this mountain and have so how you pray whatsoever things you pray when you pray desire whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe them and you shall have them let me say this if we're preaching a baptist theology what we will get is a bunch of baptist setting here if we're preaching a methodist theology we'll get a bunch of methodist setting here but if we're preaching the message we'll get a bunch of eagles [Applause] the reason why the rest of the world can't follow this into their future is they weren't destined to fly up here but you are not some earthbound chicken [Music] you are built for another level let me say this your future is not just to come to church and just to lift your hands every once in a while and lift your hands and praise him and sing to him and go out the same way you walked in your future is to walk out of here be so much like jesus that one of these days that you'll have a testimony just like enoch did that that he had this testimony that he pleased god and one of these days when the spirit of the lord gets to move in you're going to walk like enoch walk and you're going to change like sarah changed i just happen to believe you can call me crazy you can say i'm a fool but i happen to believe that i'm one of these last final runners of this message that's going to run this thing right in not into the grave but i'm going to run this thing right into the rapture you forgive me you might think we're too much but i happen to believe that full gospel lighthouse is a part of that body that in a moment in a moment in a twinkling of an eye this mortal will put on immortality what is this happening in these services you get so high and lifted up there sometimes i'm preaching man i feel like i could jump through the roof hey sometimes i feel like i could jump better than michael jordan and grab hold of that chandelier man i could just do something and sometimes i better not for the fan you better be close to something like it happens something bad gonna happen to me but you watch it you get the praising god and all of a sudden you begin to let loose you begin to move into another atmosphere you are getting that you are getting a temporary rapture you're moving from this world when i say this world i'm talking about your troubles i'm talking about what you went through this week i'm talking about what your boss said about you i'm talking about your wife what she said about you when you move out of this flesh world and you move in past what you see see past what you see and think past what you think and you get a temporary rapture it's only a sign it's only a sign that there's one coming that one of these days you're going to be worshiping so much oh no you ain't going back down there no more you don't have to live with troubles no more this is a sign there's a body that's got to be connected to a headship you got a few more minutes and i'll [Applause] i'll try to get you to where i'm where i'm going moses met that pillar of fire paul met that pillar fire it was that same you forgive me for being stuck on this i know that you've been i know you've been hearing me say these things but it's in my spirit but moses had met that pillar fire and paul had met that pillar fire he was able to go further than what the disciples had walked they said they walked with him he jesus everybody walk of jesus down on the street but paul had an experience that was higher than just walking with him he met him after his ascension and what was it when he seen him it was the same pillar of fire that was leading the children of israel and when jesus was standing there when jesus was standing there in front of the sanhedrin court he said that i am before abraham was i am it was that same pillar of fire in the body of jesus when moses got up there and he'd seen that pillar fire it was a sign to him notice he told him he said he gave him three signs he gave him three signs one would cast your rod down he turned into a serpent second it would turn put your hand to your bosom he said brother branham said look what he did he put his hand over his heart he said he put his hand over his heart it's divine healing he said but look what he was doing he said you can hear it in why it had to be shepherds he said he put his hands he put his hand over his heart he put his hand right into the bosom and he said right there was laying all those hidden mysteries that had to be brought out notice all those things that were laying there were brought out to the people this is what's going to get you out what's in your hand little bride what is it ain't a rod it's the name of jesus christ in your hand is the most powerful name that's ever been spoken on oh no no mortal done every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord he said but notice the third sign that he gave him he said brother branham said i'm just paraphrasing here and you go back and listen to what i had to be shepherds he said but he gave him two signs he said the two signs were were pertaining to his occupation they were pertaining to his person he said but the third sign was not pertaining to moses at all he said it wasn't pertaining to his occupation as a shepherd he said the two the two signs were he said those two signs had a voice behind them he said but the third sign didn't have a voice behind it i got studying that i got studying at a while back i'm going to tell you what i about tour i about tore that ship lap off my office that brother alden and them they helped me put up in there i got studying that and all those two signs got a voice behind him and that voice will back up those signs and you're standing here in this hour and you're assigned to a generation you're assigned to this laodicean world there's a voice behind you that will back up you're not just some school girl you're an ambassador of heaven all of heaven is backing up what you say notice that third sign that third sign he said it wasn't pertaining to him didn't pertain to his person he said but it did pertain to pharaoh well i might be by myself and i don't know how many pieces how many pieces of uh uh this of this plaster we got here but i think i could tear it off by myself here in a minute he said it wasn't pertaining to moses and it wasn't pertaining to the children of israel he said but it was pertaining to pharaoh he said notice you go back here and you study that you study that quote what brother burnham said he said god was not just showing to the children of israel but he was showing to pharaoh that he was god over the nile and he was god over the god of the nile [Applause] i thought you know man that's that's uh that's very that's that's that's amazing now you know i got to study in that thing i thought man that's powerful he's he's not just god over the nile but he's god over the god of the mouth and if you go to studying out egyptian history you'll go back there and you'll find that they got a god that they call happy anybody heard of that dude today if you're happy and you know it fill your wallet if you're happy and you know it inflation won't hurt but they got a god down there man i'm having too much fun up here they got a guard back here that they call hoppy hoppy hey tell me help me help me help help me i'm gonna try to contain myself right here but this god hoppy you know the egyptians were connected with that now if you take the nile away from them you take away their prosperity you take away their business you take away their livelihood and he was saying that i'm not just god of the over the now but i'm god of the god of the nile and that god happy that he has his name means the god of fertility and the god of life and god was not willing that this sound would be overlooked god was not willing that these things would stand in their way he was showing to them that he was god over everything he was god over the nile he was god over god's the one of life god's the one of fertility god's a sustainer ain't even pertaining to you let me say this in a little more clear view for you death ain't got a voice death ain't got a voice death can't speak to you little bride death can't even talk to you ron spencer you were not birthed here to go by the way of the grave you were birthed here to overcome cancer and the god of the nile is not the one that makes you fertile the god of the bible the same god william branham introduced to us is the god of the miracle hallelujah brother bannon said those two voices those two signs had a voice behind him he said they wasn't just talking about what moses is going through it was a sign of their future deliverance you didn't just follow this voice for the fishes and the loaves you didn't just follow this for the first and the second pool oh i know i know there's a lot of people you look back in jonesborough arkansas as 28 000 people that came came they stayed there for two weeks just wanting to get into the building where they had now they were coming they were attracted there was something in that tent that was attracting them but i want to say in the tent of the living god he said i'll meet you in there i'll meet you in there that is the third pool you are the king's sword you will produce what the king's sword is because you stayed with this voice it's a sign of your future you stayed right here when jesus asked will you also go peter where am i going to go lord i can't go back to that hog wall i came out of i can't go back there i can't go back here to that world i was brought out of i can't even cross the bridges i burnt the bridges down lord only you have the words of eternal life he's working in a body and what you're seeing when you see him move in the midst of the congregation when you see him come down and declare himself that the pillar of fire is here that the pillar of fire's still moving and young people young people can't even open their eyes because a pillar of fire is so visible in the room what is it it's a sign of the resurrection when young people come up with troubles that only the only doctor jesus could take care of [Music] let me tell you ain't no psychologist ain't no psychiatrist can take care of the problems of the world of this day but i've met a doctor cancer is not too big for him depression is not too big for him homosexuality is not too big for him your depression's not too big for him dr jesus take a look in his take a look in his script back he's still got the same promises that were for them back there they're for you today i am the lord thy god that heals all of your diseases you got a future young people your future's not in a bottle your future's not out there your future's not out there with some scandalous young girl or some crazy young man your future is in divine in the divine one that is god almighty you got a future you got a future you remember when brother branham had went over there and he disobeyed the angel's voice you remember when he went over there to africa and he disobeyed he got in trouble by listening to those men and he got those amoebas got those parasites and he was laying there he was laying there and he was thinking he was thinking about a future will i will i always deal with this well well i always battle this type of thing and then all of a sudden he fell into a trance he said he said there he was and he said and as you were thinking on your way as you were thinking about your future he said he took some old and i don't understand this he said but he took some crumpled up paper he took some crumpled up paper that was laying there beside the bed and he said he stretched it out towards the heavens he stretched it out towards the heavens it said william branham your future is clear little bride i want to say to you portion of the blood of jesus christ i want to say to you your future is clear [Applause] safety can do what it wants to you it can try to support you it can try to stop you but hey ain't got enough to stop you hell ain't got

demons are back air when those demons back there and i believe it's mark chapter five when they come out when they come out and that man named legion brother stephen when they come out brother parents said he'd never come out there gabriel if legion wouldn't have pushed his way out there you'd have never gotten this church you'd have never gotten that hospital room you'd have never got to this holy

he said it's those devils getting nervous it's those devils getting nervous knowing that they're about to be defeated if there's anybody that's nervous seth it's the devil i got to study in question and answers this evening and brother branham said that when those demons walked out there they met their match they met their match they met their match and i'll say this jesus was more than a match for them and i heard a prophet's voice said you're more than a match for the devil you're more than a match for this layout to see and flu you're more than a match to the further depression of pain you're more than a match for the depression and anxiety and the demons and those demons begin to scream out seth malachi gabriel sarah i happen to believe that you're you've got jesus sitting on the

lake of fire can i be a help to the one that kicks that kicks that devil right in the mouth and knocks him down a lake of fire can i be a help [Music] devil you had your time you had your time but you

his hands [Applause] brother tom when the roll is called up yonder you'll be there [Applause] i'll be there you'll be there oh give him praise in the house of god and i saw a new heaven and a new earth coming down out of heaven abraham was looking for a building for a city whose builder and maker was god brother branham said if he would have only looked up he was walking right underneath of it just take a look up just take a look up the main shadows them's clouds oh when you're far away from it it just looks like a terrible storm but the closer you get them's angels it's watching over you hallelujah mary mary was able to look back at the prophet's prophecy and recognize this was her time this was a time daniel was able to look back by the understanding of the books he'd been down there
