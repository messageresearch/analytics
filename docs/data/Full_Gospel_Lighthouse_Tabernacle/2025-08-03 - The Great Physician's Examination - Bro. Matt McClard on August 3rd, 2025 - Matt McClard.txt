Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, as we come before you in prayer, Lord, we want to exalt you this morning, Lord, and tell you just how much we love you and how much we appreciate you.

May you just be with them as they return home. We love you. We commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. As we prepare to take up the offering, I believe Sister Hannah and Sister Anna have a special force this morning if they'd come and sing for us. And after them, Sister Julia [Music] I hear the doubters say you don't see many mirales these days. And I see so many broken ones just waiting for the answers to come to those who've grown weary. I've got good news. So hold on. Be strong. Keep trusting. It's true. &gt;&gt; The healer hasn't lost his touch. is still the almighty, the unchanging God. The power is still showing up. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I know there's much. The healer hasn't lost his touch. I've been a desperate soul, a voice crying out to be made whole. And I felt the empty head. So helpless in that lonely place. But I found him faithful and I've seen him move. This is my story and I'm living proof. The healer hasn't lost his touch. He's still the almighty, the unchanging God. The power still showing. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I know this much. The healer hasn't lost his touch. Oh, he still restores and he still redeems. &gt;&gt; He still renews. And I still believe the healer hasn't lost his touch. He's still the almighty, the unchanging God. The power still showing love. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I know this much. The healer hasn't lost his touch. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I love you, Lord. For your mercy fails me. And all my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] Cuz all my life you have been faithful.

[Music] For from you are all things. Do you are all things you deserve it? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many loves you? &gt;&gt; Come on now. You know I'm going to call you out. Let's let the Lord know we love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Let him know, Lord, I'm thankful for where you brought me from. Lord, I might feel cold this morning, but I'm going to sacrifice my feelings. I'm going to praise you in the house of God. I want to let the Lord know I love you and I'm going to let hell know you lose. [Music] Amen. You love him this morning. Well, I got a little bit of a testimony I got to tell you this morning. Uh and mainly because I don't want to misconstrued. I was on my way to work Tuesday morning about eighth of a mile, tenth of a mile in front of me, the dump truck, left front tire went out. We're going 70 75 miles an hour. And man, he threw everything in the back of his dump truck all the way. It looked like a big cloud of dust. Couldn't see either lane. Couldn't see past it. Was coming off the overpass there at Fischerville. And smoke the dust settled and he's on the side of the road, flipped upside on his left side, and immediately catches on fire. So I pull over. I'm like, what do I do? So we get out of the car and I run across 64, get about halfway there. I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's what what you know. Halfway there, I told Brother Gab, I'm like, "Am I dumb? You know, thing's on fire. You're running toward it." He rolls out. I get about halfway there, he rolls out. So, I did not pull him out. I did not go in there after him. I did not get burned. I did not cut a anything. He rolls out and he's on fire. Shirt's on fire. His hair's on fire. Starts rolling on the ground. I helped Patty him out and I said, "Buddy, we got to get away from this thing right now." And he looks at me and goes, "I got to get out." I said, "You're out. You're out." So, we kind of convinced him. I said, "Man, we got to go." We walked away about 50 yards and three or four more times while we were standing there, it blew up. Paramedic showed up. Another paramedic showed up. They just stopped on the road. God knows what he's doing. I told the police officer what happened. and I walked to my car and drove away. &gt;&gt; It was like I was in a movie. It was like how in the world I tried to call my wife and she wouldn't she was at work and I called Andrew. I'm like literally I think it took me three or four hours to pull myself together about what just happened. I got a hold of the state police the next day, got the guy's name. I called him. He was a VCU. He called me back. His name is Luther Clevenger. He's burned bad. But he was ever so thankful that I was there. And I give God praise. &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking before I came out here, if I was two seconds earlier or a second earlier, I could have been on the left side of him going with him. You never know when it's your time. You never know. I'm telling you, I went away from there. I'm like that I had to convince myself it happened. It was like that happened. that really happened. But don't misconstrue it. I didn't pull him out. I'm no hero in my mind by any means. I believe everybody would have done the same thing. But I just forgot to tell you, so you heard it from me. Amen. So, Amen. How many loves the Lord today. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm excited to be in church. &gt;&gt; I'm excited to hear what the Lord's got to say. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's go into the word of God. How many enjoyed that last night? Man, that was good. I thought, man, I got to follow that. He just explained the whole message. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I needed it. &gt;&gt; I know there's some of you just started walking in this message. How many to help you? &gt;&gt; Good to hear it explained out. Simple. &gt;&gt; I love God's gifts. &gt;&gt; I love Brother William, man. Able to take something like that and just go. My brain would have been you guys been like, "Sorry, my pastor done labeled me Red Bull." So, here we go. I wasn't even in the building. I heard it afterwards. Matthew chapter 9, if you have your Bibles, we're done. How many uh appreciates our musicians? &gt;&gt; Amen. I was going to tell Sister Katie, Sister Connie, and Sister Cassie, we miss you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we kind of miss those guys that are with you. No, we we truly miss them when they're gone. It was weird sitting over there by yourself. I'm gonna say, "Yeah, baby. You ready?" Brother William, just calm my nerves here. Brother William said, "You know," he said, "When your wife sends you that and you feel the vibe behind it," I was like, "Yeah, baby." I was like, "It ain't church unless we have one of those." But Amen. Matthew chapter 9, if you have your Bibles, let's just bow our hearts before we open the word. If you have a need upon your heart, why don't you just lift your hand? Say, "Father, come by my way. Move him out of the way. Father, speak to my heart, Lord. Father, we bow our hearts before you, Lord, in your presence, Lord, knowing you're an ontime God. You're real, Lord. You're a God that can be felt be touched by the feeling of our affirmities. Father, Lord, we come together, Lord, as a needy people, Lord. each one of us, Lord God. Lord, we're in need of you to pass by our way, Father. There's things, Lord God, we want to talk about, Lord, there's things we don't understand, but Father, I pray that the Holy Ghost would come, Lord, and begin to just speak directly, Lord, to your people's need, Lord. You know what they have need of, Lord. You knew this meeting before the foundational world. Lord, you set it all up, Father. And God, you don't set something up for it not to be great, Lord. So, God, we come in expectation today, Lord, of a great outpouring of thy spirit, God. May you move amongst your people, Lord. And may we leave here, Lord, like those on the way to Emmas, Lord. Did not our hearts burn within us as you talk to us along the way. And Father, we'll be very careful to give you all praise and all glory for you are worthy of it all. Lord, I pray that you be with Andrew this morning. Father, use him again, Lord. Strengthen him in his body, Lord. Be with his voice, Father. and God, minister your word, Lord God, that those people might be completely set free in your name. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles this morning, let's turn to Matthew chapter 9. Yeah. Start reading at verse 11, then we'll go to Psalms 41. Matthew chapter 9. Let's start reading at verse nine. And Jesus path forth from this from this. He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of cuspen and said unto him, "Follow me." And he arose and followed him. And it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the house. Behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his his disciples, "Why eatth your master with publicans and sinners?" You know, I don't think Jesus likes that attitude. And when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, they that behold need not a physician, but they that are sick. But go ye and learn what that meanth. I will have mercy and not sacrifice, for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. In Psalms chapter 41, just want to pick up one verse there. Psalms chapter 41 verse verse four. I said, 'Lord, be merciful unto me. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee. You may have your seats this morning. Just want to take a thought if I might by the help of the Lord. And the great physician's examination. &gt;&gt; The great physician's examination. I don't know if you know it or not, but you just walked into a hospital. &gt;&gt; I know there's probably about 15 or 20 of you just got nervous. How many I know there's people that walk in a hospital. My dad walks into a hospital and he immediately gets nauseated. He goes, "I don't know what the smell of is. I don't know what it is about it, but you just walked into a hospital today and there's a great physician that's in the building &gt;&gt; and he's here to give you an examination and he's here to let you know what you have need of." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you go back there to Matthew, that word whole means to be strong, to be strong in body, to be robos, robust, to be in sound health, to have power, to have power shown by extraordinary deeds, to exert, wield power, to have strength, to overcome. How many say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. We've come into the house of God and you raised your hands stating, "Father, I have a need this morning." And I don't know what that need is, but there's a God in heaven that knows your need this morning. I believe there's some people in the house of God that have need of healing this morning. Not just physical healing, but they have need of spiritual healing. As we walk along this walk and we fight our battles, there's times we get wounded. There's times we get hurt and we need to get into the hospital. And that is church. &gt;&gt; This is church. Amen. We don't come just to find out where we're doing good. We come to find out, Lord, where do I need to do better? Lord, what can I do? Where do I need your touch? I don't come just to play church. This is something very important. There's physical healing. There's spiritual healing happening in the church of the living God. And we're here this morning. Let the great physician touch your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David himself, anointed of God, would say, "Lord, heal my soul." &gt;&gt; What was that third poll? There was healing in the soul. Saints of God, we need healing today. There's some of you, I don't know where you've been. I don't know what's happened in your life. You've come through some very hard things. And healing sometimes takes time. &gt;&gt; It takes time. You don't get healed overnight, but little by little by coming to church and getting into the spoken word, that word comes over your life and it begins to touch you. It begins to heal you. I know I'm preaching this morning. How do you know that, brother Matt? I'm an example of the healing power of sitting in a church service. &gt;&gt; How many's ever come to church &gt;&gt; and maybe you fought the whole way you didn't want to come? &gt;&gt; Hey, be honest with yourself. You didn't feel like it. You didn't feel like a Christian. You felt like the worst. &gt;&gt; But you got in the presence of God and the word of God begin to came over your body. What was it? It was the great physician speaking to your need. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you didn't miss it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Brother say this. So, I believe there's a need for a healing in tonight more than a physical healing. I believe it's a spiritual healing of the sickest body I know of. The body of Jesus Christ is the sickest body I know of. It's so broke up in so many different denominations and factions and you almost could put the message of the hour right here, too. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. And we're so And so we're trying to do our best for the gospel to heal the broken body that all the people might come together in one great unity. I didn't say compromise, but the word of God brings the body together in one great unity. That's what this message came for. Not to separate us from this, that, and the other, but to bring us together in one great unity. Brother Bam said this is what this is that was in I never read where I get these from. But if you want my notes, I will send them to you. &gt;&gt; God gave it to for you anyway. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you can understand what I wrote down, go ahead. Doesn't we would see Jesus. This is in go away Jesus in 63. But there's more to the ministry than divine healing. See, the sickest body I know of tonight is a so-called body of Jesus Christ. It needs spiritual healing. How many believes if it needs it, there's a great position that's on the scene to give it. &gt;&gt; Say, "But man, I'm doing pretty good." Amen. That's all right. You still need a hand of God. &gt;&gt; There are people had cancers for years, didn't realize they had it. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's good. You can have something hidden in your life that God wants to expose today. And it's not to to beat you down. It's not for you to hurt. It's not for you to say woy woy woy. It's for you to say if the great physician showed it to me, then the great physician has grace and mercy that I can walk differently than what I came in. The great physician does a wonderful job. &gt;&gt; You know, in the medical field, they talk about selling somebody up. So basically when you come to restoration, hey, MRI is wonderful. It's a great place. Go lay in that tube and get beat on. You know, they they try, oh, Matt's a great guy, but let me tell you about my Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I got enough time. He's the greatest that ever walked the face of the earth. He's the greatest physician. He's never lost a case. He's never misdiagnosed a case. He always says the right word at the right time. He knows exactly what he's doing. He knows exactly what you have need of. Even though you don't know what you have need of, even though you resent the word of God when it comes over top of you, why don't you quit doing that and say, "Listen, that's God speaking to me. I need to hear that." Well, glory. So, you get to the hospital. What do you got to do? Check in. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a process. First of all, UVA, man, you got to park who knows where. Listen, I have to park a mile away. Just food for thought, I guess. I don't know. But you got It's all stressful. You got to go here and then my appointment's at 2 o'clock and I got to get here and I got to go here and I got to get 64 is a mess. It's the way it all works. But you got to go to registration. You know why you got to go to registration? You got to get identified. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Let's preach some some identification. Who are you this morning? Do you know who you are this morning? Do you know what this message called you to be? Amen. Do you know who you are? Or have you got some spiritual amnesia that Dr. Jesus need to make need to bring to your remembrance where he brought you? What he's done in your life? I know what it's like to go through trials. I know what it's like to go through valleys. Brother Andrew said it. That's one of the tricks of the devil. He tries to get you. How many How many's ever forgot what God did yesterday? &gt;&gt; I'll give you an example in the Bible. What they did, it says they broke the five loaves and fishes and fed 5,000. They got in a boat and the boat started rocking and they already forgot what God did for them the day before. &gt;&gt; Couldn't the God that fed you here get you out of the storm over here? Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; You get some. You forget who you are sometimes dayto day. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just preach where you live. That's all right. You go ahead and live with me. Sometimes you forget who you are. &gt;&gt; But let's identify this morning with a supernatural God that is supernatural and he's on time every time. He's not just an intellectual God. He's a God that's supernatural. And I have a supernatural birth. &gt;&gt; They want to know your name. &gt;&gt; You know what your name is? Mrs. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What's your identity? I'm identified with this message. &gt;&gt; I don't care if people want to hide from it. I'm identified with William Mary Brantham. He was my prophet and he gave me the word of the Lord for this hour and I'm feasting on the word of the Lord and it's changing my body. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I got to catch one scripture. Let me back up. You ready? My soul thirsteth for God. Hungry and thirsty. This is Psalms 175. Hungry and thirsty, their soul faintth. You know what? If you're hungry and thirsty, why don't you just eat? If your soul's fainting, if you feel like you can't walk, listen, we had some people fainting last week. If you feel like you can't walk the right way and you ain't got enough strength to walk, well, let me tell you, why don't you just feed &gt;&gt; for the man I turn the tape on and I don't understand anything. That's all right. You turn that tape on and say, "Father, give me the understanding. Speak to my heart. Give me one word, Lord." &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by what? Hearing. So when you get that food and that faith begins to, you know what you do? You just keep on walking. &gt;&gt; Sorry for the backtrack. It was good. &gt;&gt; You know, spiritual amnesia, but the man would teach us comes by shock, worry, getting between two opinions. Listen, some of you have been shocked by something in your life. Maybe somebody died quickly. Maybe a diagnosis shocked you and all of a sudden, yeah, it got quiet. I am one, don't I? All of a sudden, you begin to I guess God doesn't really love me. I don't really have what I what I thought I Okay, these thoughts don't go through your mind. &gt;&gt; But recognize where that thoughts come from. &gt;&gt; And say, you know what? I know who I am. Yay. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. If he send me to hell, I'll praise him. Wherever he sends me, that's the time to really show him, Lord, I love you. &gt;&gt; Some of you need to do it. &gt;&gt; But I only do that when I feel like. &gt;&gt; Won't you sacrifice your feelings and say, "You know what? I don't feel like it, but he's worthy of it all. He's worthy of it all. He's worthy of my hands being lifted up. He's worthy of my mouth singing praises. He's worthy of my shout. He's worthy of my dance. He's worthy of everything I've got. He's my God and my savior, my great physician. And he's in the building this morning. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he'll bring all things to remembrance. &gt;&gt; So, as you're sitting there and God begins to remind you, look where you came from. Look where you came from. Look where you came from. Brother Vernon, he's brought you a mighty long way, ain't he? &gt;&gt; You know what? He doesn't stop there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He going to take you all the way, buddy. &gt;&gt; He's brought you a mighty long way. I know sometimes we get in the trials and the hardship. We forget that. But let God speak to your heart. Say, "Did not I beat you here? Did not I financially bring you through there? Did not I touch you when you were sick? Did not I hear your plan? Then why would you be doubting right now? The same God that brought you through the Red Sea is the same God that's taking you to a promised land. The same God is in the building. &gt;&gt; Oh man. You know, some people don't want to be identified with the supernatural, but I don't know about you, in this day and age, we need the supernatural moving in our midst. They don't want it. Send it my way. &gt;&gt; I want to see Jesus in every way that I can see Jesus. When I look at brother Gabe, I want to see Jesus. I want to see God moving in the midst. &gt;&gt; Examination. Uhoh. 1 Peter 4:17. For the time has come that judges must begin where? &gt;&gt; House of God. &gt;&gt; Right. And it first began at us. David would say this, "Search me, oh God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts." Brother William hit this last night. Says, "We try to make our weaknesses excuses. This is in perfect strength by f perfect faith. We want to tell how big we are, how great we are. I think that one of the things that God gave me to text for was to get that out of our mind. See, there's little things that we do and that's what we come to church for is to find out where our faults is and the things we might better oursel by. And the church said, &gt;&gt; if you know you could serve God better, wouldn't you want him? &gt;&gt; But if it involved you sacrificing some more of you, would you want to? &gt;&gt; It wasn't the same answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the way we come to church is to find out where our faults is, the things we better might better ourselves by. If we come to church for any other objective than this, I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church. &gt;&gt; Let that sink in for just a minute. Be like David. Lord, if there be any wicked way in me, &gt;&gt; sometimes we're blind to oursel. We couldn't be wrong. And then God shows the light and says, "You are." &gt;&gt; Give me an example, brother Matt. Paul &gt;&gt; had the scriptures, had the word lined up, going about doing what he thought everything was right. And there came a light. Aren't you thankful for a supernatural light that's amongst us this morning? He's here to give you revelation. He's here to give you understanding. He's here to change your life. I want to hit some excuses. Oh my. &gt;&gt; If we come to church for any other reason objective than that, I'm afraid we won't get too much out of it. He says, "There's so many of us likes to testify and likes to think we're insufficient. Therefore, we make that an excuse." Let me read that again. There's so many of us that like to think, let me read it. There's so many of us that like to testify or likes to think we're insufficient. And therefore we make that an excuse. I have no education. I have no bu ability. I'm unable to do this. If you keep that up and do it that way, keep going that way. You can't amount to anything. Oh my. Got quiet. Brother Matt, what can I do? What can't you do? I believe it was said to you last weekend, why can't you? Why can't we? Why can't we believe? Why can't we speak to our mountain? Not brother Ron. Not brother Andrew. Not brother Matt. Not brother William. Not brother Matthew. Why can't you? [Music] &gt;&gt; What kind of excuse is coming up in your mind? Well, brother Matt, I got too much of a pass. Hold on. Go to God's book. Where's your past at? &gt;&gt; I've searched all the way back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can't find it. Then why make that your excuse? If God can't see it, why don't you get past that excuse and say, "Lord, if you want me, you got me. You got all of me. Lord, you got my faults, my failures. You got me. &gt;&gt; Some of you are still looking. Quit looking. &gt;&gt; It ain't there." &gt;&gt; Boo. Romans 1:20, for the invisible things of him from circation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and god godhead, so that we so that so that they are without excuse. Let me tell you, the Bible says you ain't got no excuses. &gt;&gt; Well, preacher, brother Matt, &gt;&gt; healing is happening in the building right now. &gt;&gt; Do you realize God's bringing up those excuses why you aren't closer? You got all kinds of excuses. Well, I'm busy and I got a busy job and I got this. Do you really? &gt;&gt; Do you really? I'm sorry. I'm an evangelist. You leave me alone. This how we go. Amen. We dig right down there to the problem because that's where God is and that's where God wants to work cuz he doesn't deal with just the surface. He goes deeper than that. He's going down to the root of the problem and he wants to see you made whole. Have power to do what he said you do. Let me give you the I think the number one excuse there could be I mean it could be somebody else's. That preacher looked at me funny. That ain't the number one excuse. They look at you funny cuz they can't breathe. You look different if you can't breathe. That next breath's important. I can't. &gt;&gt; Let me smash your excuse with the word. You ready? &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me. Now, it didn't say learn all things. It said do. So, do means there's action. Oh, glory. Come on. The works that I do, ye shall do also. So, the the part that says I can't. No, you can't. But if you can yield, then God can. The problem is I can't because you can't yield. But quit making that an excuse to say, "Father, I've come this morning and I need healing." That that excuse never takes from my lips again. &gt;&gt; How you going to do it, brother Matt? I don't know. &gt;&gt; Think Moses walked up the Red Sea thinking, "Well, it going to work. He was human. &gt;&gt; I'm sure that thought was &gt;&gt; What do you got in your hand? You got prayer. &gt;&gt; Why don't you start using your prayer for your I can't &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I presently struggle with, but Father, I want to do better. Lord, I've come to the physician." Listen, sometimes a physician just tells you do better. &gt;&gt; You're doing good, but do better. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the physician sees potential in you. He knows what lays inside of you. He knows that predestinated seed's coming to fruit and it's coming in your life. And sometimes you just need an encouragement. Do better. &gt;&gt; How many with an honest heart would raise their hand and say they could do better? &gt;&gt; Well, then do it. &gt;&gt; Good preaching, brother Matt. Yeah, I was. You confessed it. You said you needed it. &gt;&gt; How you going to do it? I can do all things. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Christ is in the building. &gt;&gt; Then why don't you tap into Christ this morning and watch a difference happen in your life? Glory. Some of you did run well. &gt;&gt; But what's your excuse now? &gt;&gt; Scriptures. The Bible says run that you're going to obtain. And if I believe I'm right, they're obtaining a corruptible crown. If you go back and look this up, it was talking about the Olympics. &gt;&gt; How many's ever seen Olympian Mike Michael Phelps? You know what he did? He ate right. &gt;&gt; He slept right. &gt;&gt; And he exercised to complete the goal. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that was for that was a crown that's going to rot. &gt;&gt; But the crown that's set before you, why don't we run well? Why don't we run with everything we got? I'm not saying the fastest, but get to running. Run to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says, "For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." He knows what you're going through. How many ever feel like you're going through it alone? &gt;&gt; You know what? He's not more than an inch from you. He's right there with you. &gt;&gt; I don't feel him. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the word said he'd never leave me nor forsake me. Even when I feel like I've left him, he never leave me nor forsake me. Healing's happening in the building right now. How many say amen? The listen, no man can do that. But the word of God through the anointing of Jesus Christ as he begins to speak over your life, there's healing. It has to come to something. It will not return void. But there's a supernatural act happening on the inside of your soul. You may not have felt anything. You may not have thought anything. But you have come into the presence of the shikina. That almond tree never failed anything. But it went through the whole process in the shikina glory that when they took it out of the shakina glory, it brought forth life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about my doctor. How many's ever been to your family doctor and they said, "Well, I got you an appointment with three other doctors." Well, yep. I'm sure the Chris is probably fresh. You got an orthopod to look at your hip. You got anologist to look at your head. You got a vascular doctor to see if everything else is right. And 16 scans to make sure everything's okay. &gt;&gt; I understand why people don't want to tell the doctor anything. &gt;&gt; All right. Some of you men go to the doctor and you've had all kinds of symptoms but won't ever tell them. Go ahead, sisters. All right, we'll flip that around. How many of you men have seen your wife go to the doctor and they never mention the problem? You're in trouble, man. All by himself. But let me tell you, when you come through those doors, &gt;&gt; when you come through those doors, don't you be afraid to ask God for help. Don't you say, "Father, I need help." Come on, somebody. He's here to help you. He loves you. He cares for you. He's got more grace. He's got more mercy. One touch of the Master's hand and all things become new. I want to get through to this because this is this is a lot of the problem right here. We'll come to church knowing we need something. &gt;&gt; But we'll sit there and reason it out. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're we're down home right now. But Romy saying, "Amen, buddy. Come on. You come to this hospital, know that my God has got everything that you have need of. You said, "Brother Matt, I don't even know how to fix myself." That's right. He ain't he ain't planning on you fixing yourself. That's why he died, took all the authority, paid the price, that now he can come here and give you everything that you have need of. There's healing in the building today. There's spiritual healing. There's natural healing. Let your faith reach out and say, "Father, you're in the building. I'm tired of living this way. I'm tired of living a halfway life. I'm tired of giving you half of my heart. I want to give it all. &gt;&gt; My God's every doctor there is. &gt;&gt; He's an eye doctor, ain't that right, Brother Teddy?" He's an eye doctor, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to stand up for just a minute. Huh? &gt;&gt; Won't you let the devil know he's an eye doctor &gt;&gt; right there? He stands as a witness and let the devil know you aren't going to keep his sight. You aren't going to hold him back. He stands as a witness. He didn't go out for prayer. The angel Lord passed by his way and here he stands able to see. I'm not just talking about a natural healing. I'm talking about a supernatural revelation of the word of God that now you don't see this message is just a bunch of dos and don'ts and God sent a prophet but it's the reality of Jesus Christ in this age in this hour and it's open your eyes to let you know not only who he is but who you are come out of her my people. Hallelujah. He's here to put some eyes have on you. &gt;&gt; Well, man, I feel like I need to see more. &gt;&gt; How many wants to see more? &gt;&gt; Well, you're in luck. Not in luck. You're blessed. &gt;&gt; You're more than luck. You've been blessed before the foundation of the world. Cuz blessed are your eyes, for they see. Listen, not everybody sees what we see, saints of God. And let us never forget that. Not everybody sees what we sees. But when we seize it, I'm making up words. When we seize it, why don't we just go ahead and say, "Thank you, Lord. I'm so thankful. I see what you've revealed to me." &gt;&gt; It's not that I can just take it from Genesis to Revelation, but when I look in the mirror of the book and it reflects back in my life, &gt;&gt; you can tell like they were with Peter, he'd been in the presence of Jesus Christ. Listen, saints of God, there's a supernatural presence here this morning. And Jesus Christ is in the building. And the great physician is opening your eyes to see who you are. &gt;&gt; What's been Andrew's message the last couple times? &gt;&gt; Well, not this last one, man. Last Saturday was good, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; That was good. It's all good. Why? Because that's what we It's the most important thing to a believer. We come to church to hear the word of God. We don't want to leave hungry. How many likes, Listen, you young boys, how many like going to a restaurant that you know their portions are not going to be enough? I love Panera, but my goodness, I don't get full. [Music] They got great food, but it's like, where's the rest of it? Tastes good, but I want more. But you don't come to the house of God and you belly up, you ain't got to worry about what God's going to give you cuz he going to feed you like no other. &gt;&gt; He going to give you the best smorgish sport you ever had. And he makes it just as real and it's hot and as fresh and it's so good. &gt;&gt; How can you tell it's good? Cuz the smile on your face says, [Music] "Give me some more of that." &gt;&gt; I like where that came from. Honey, you can do that one again. Well, praise the Lord. Andrew's message has been what? Focus. Focus. Focus. Do you not realize who that is that's telling us it is not Andrew Spencer? &gt;&gt; Yes, Andrew studies this message. Yes, Andrew's in his Bible. Yes, Andrew spends time in prayer. But when we get to this point right here, we are nothing unless he comes. But when he comes and he anoints the man of God and they begin to say things that are not even in their notes and he's letting his bride know, now is the time to focus. Now is the time to let your eye be single. Cuz when the eye is single, the whole body brings forth light. You are the light of the world. It's time for the bride to focus &gt;&gt; and let the light shine. Glory. Ghesa came into a position in a battle he couldn't see. How many's ever been in a battle and thought you were there fighting it by yourself. &gt;&gt; You ain't by yourselves, sis. Sister Wanda, you ain't by yourself. Not only are we with you, the angels of heaven are encamped about you. &gt;&gt; Brother Andy, we love you. Keep your germs away from Sister Wanda. You know, Brother Andy, he like that. It's time we get so focused. Want you want you to be honest with yourself. Lord, I'm not really spending as much time in the message as I should. God sees your hand. But there's healing in the building. Lord, take my desire for the things that I'm wasting time for. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Why don't you confess it to him? Say, Lord, take my time from the things that are stealing my time. Take my time for Come on, somebody. take my time, Lord, that I can focus like you're asking me to focus, Father. Lord, I've heard your word. It's the word of the Lord. I agree with it. I amen it. But, Father, don't let me just be a hearer. Let me be a doer. &gt;&gt; You think we have good church services churches now? You wait till we all get focused in on one one desire and one goal. I'll be honest with you, they'll send the fire department out here. They'll think this building's on actually on fire. But it's nothing more than the presence of Almighty God. They'll be able to see it from the mountaintop. Saints of God, I believe in my God like that. &gt;&gt; He's the best heart doctor &gt;&gt; ever known to man. &gt;&gt; They have heart transplants, but that's a used heart going into a new body. But God does heart transplants. He takes an old stony heart. How many of you How many some of you men hard as nails? Nobody going to tell you nothing. Nobody going to change your mind. &gt;&gt; And you got in the presence of a heart doctor that said, "Really? Let me touch you one time." And all of a sudden, that heart becomes so fleshly. As brother Daryl said, "God squeezed my heart and it came out my eyes." &gt;&gt; He's the best physician that ever walked the face of the earth. My God is the best heart doctor. If you've got a blockage right now, if you've got a blockage where the blood of Jesus Christ ain't flowing to, let me tell you, make way. It's coming. The grace of God is coming to your place and saying, "I know you maybe can't walk like you used to walk or you can't do what you thought you could do, but I'm here to tell you, my blood is sufficient." &gt;&gt; Sometimes you get out of rhythm. Sometimes she gets it beaten a little too fast or a little too slow. But aren't you thankful for a message that said, "Onward, Christian soldier." [Music] &gt;&gt; What it do? It put your heart right back in line with the word of God and say, "We're moving onward." I want to preach to the one that's stagnant right now. Why do you have to stay there? What excuse do you got? &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay there. &gt;&gt; The great physician says, "Get up. Be thou made whole, and walk." &gt;&gt; Brother Matt, I've never been able to walk like that. That's all right. That just means it's a greater miracle you can share with somebody that I couldn't do it. There was no way I could. I tried multiple times. But I tell you what, I came to a service on an August morning and the hand of the Lord reached out to me and said, "You can walk. Not only can you walk, you can live it, you can speak it, you can breathe it. In fact, it's who you are." &gt;&gt; He heals the brokenhearted. &gt;&gt; How many's ever been brokenhearted? &gt;&gt; Hurts. Listen, I'm going to talk to young people. Listen, young people, don't you dare run to get in a relationship. &gt;&gt; I know they're pretty, brother Matt. Mhm. You have something precious beats right here. &gt;&gt; And it's your heart. Let me tell you that hurt. It hurts bad. &gt;&gt; Pray over it. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray over it. That's free. He's the best surgeon that ever lived. Brother Matt, he's a surgeon. Mhm. Yep. He's an anesthesiologist, too. He is. Put that in the scriptures, brother Matt. He took Adam and put him to sleep. &gt;&gt; And then he performed surgery and he brought forth a bride. &gt;&gt; Let's take that right back to Calvary. Our master went to sleep and God took the bride right outside of him and he placed her on the face of the earth. And here we are in bride time. The greatest surgeon, he's still working. How do you know that, brother Matt? There's a sword going out through the people right now. And doubts being cut off. Fear's being cut off. Complex is being cut off. He's doing surgery on you right now. How many watch an old Zoro movie? How many ever watch an old Zoro movie? Do you realize the word of God goes and it cuts fear out of your life? Well, when it does, why don't you just stand up and say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; You know, some of you don't even recognize it's gone. &gt;&gt; But when you walk in these buildings and you stand up the end of service, you're a completely different person than when you sat down. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God performed surgery on you. God's the greatest surgeon there ever was. &gt;&gt; He's still cutting. Oh, glory. Why don't you open your heart wide? Why don't you open everything you are? Listen, you ain't got to be afraid here. We're We're in the presence of God Almighty. You ain't got to be afraid of being cut and hurt. God, when he does surgery, he does it the right way. &gt;&gt; Let me read you this quote. [Music] Some of you need an anesthesiologist. Some of you need to rest your minds. &gt;&gt; I know sometime you get in that time of life and your mind just &gt;&gt; peace be still in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Peace. Sometimes our mind runs and runs and runs and runs and runs and runs and you just want to go to sleep. &gt;&gt; You just want to rest. Let me tell you, all is well, brother Matt. But but but all is well. We have heard the message shalom and all is well. For there is a place a perfect rest behind that inner veil. That's where you're at. &gt;&gt; So rest little bride. rest for all is well. Brother Matt, why you singing? Because there's healing in singing. I'll take it anyway. I can get it. There's healing in love. There's healing in sin. There's healing in the word. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. That's him. Let me tell you how that works. In the middle of singing, God says, "You're healing right here by singing to him." &gt;&gt; And then he beats me back to David as David played the heart. What did it do? Those evil spirits left them. &gt;&gt; Who can do that? The great physician. And let me tell you, he's here. &gt;&gt; You ain't got to guess about it. He's here. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm going say this. You're the great doctor. You're the great surgeon. This is in prayer now. Lord, let these people who are sick tonight in their body, and their soul that they may just commit their case into your hands, the great physician, stubborn man. There's you committing the case. What are you talking about, brother Matt? Saying, "Lord, I really do need help. I've sat in some marvelous services. I've seen your power move many times. But Lord, it's me today. I don't want to leave out of this presence without a touch and my life changed. Amen. I might not be completely whole, but Father, I'll be on my way to healing. &gt;&gt; I know if you you don't do a halfway work, you do a full way work. &gt;&gt; Listen, when you see that little pedal move the mountain, you better rejoice just as much as that mountain moved. &gt;&gt; Because the same power that made that pedal move, that little pebble &gt;&gt; pebble move, is the same power that's going to move the whole thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says your He says commit their hands unto commit your case under your hands. The great physician operate them the father. I forgot to start my timer. &gt;&gt; I'll start right now. Father, to the extent that all their doubt would be taken away. Now your word says you are the same yesterday there. We pray you use that for a knife and bring that knife down and declare yourself to be the same. I'll be with you even in you. And the Lord when the people sees that you're here, may their faith climb above every disease that is in the building, the sin of sickness, and be healed. For we ask it in Jesus' name. And full gospel says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; He's the best counselor you ever had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. He's the best counselor. You got problems with your friends, don't go talk to the other friend about it &gt;&gt; because you just sinned. &gt;&gt; You Oh, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Somebody touch. I'm trying to heal you again. Don't hurt you. Well, he's the best counselor. When you don't know how to deal with something, when you don't know which way to turn, there's a great physician that has never misguided one case. &gt;&gt; But the problem of it is, have you asked? &gt;&gt; But Matt, uh, I thought he knew. He does know, but he's waiting on you to ask. &gt;&gt; Glory, Sister Wanda. You go to every this doctor, that doctor, this doctor, multiple, right? Come to one. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, he showed up this morning. And he didn't show up just to just for you to look at him. He came to take your case. He came to let you know, I care about the little things in your life. I care about the problems you got going on. I care about the spiritual disease that has plagued your life for years and years and years and years. I care. I've known about the whole time. And this meeting is for you. &gt;&gt; You're not meeting with Brother Matt. You're not meeting with Brother William. You're meeting with the Lord Jesus. And he's here. &gt;&gt; He's a specialist. &gt;&gt; He's a specialist. How many ever heard that? You got to go to the specialist. There's only one guy in the whole country, and you got to go to Houston, Texas to talk to him. Aren't you glad all you have to say is, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I need help. &gt;&gt; I'm calling you on your name." And let me tell you, he's on the scene. &gt;&gt; Cuz you got a checkbook and all you're doing is signing your name and say, "Lord, I've come to draw on what you did for me. You went to Calvary for my healing. You went to Calvary for my iniquities." Oh, glory. Let me get on your iniquities for just a minute. Things that you know you do and know you shouldn't do, but you do anyway. &gt;&gt; He's the healer of that, too. &gt;&gt; He was bruised for your iniquities. And when he took it, he didn't complain one bit. They're going to need me in 2025 in August sitting in there. They're going to I want to let them know I didn't complain. In fact, I was happy to take them. I know what it's like to walk in your shoes. I know what it's like to go through the things. I know what it's like. That's why I came. That's why I died. That's why I took stripes. Because I am your healer. &gt;&gt; He had an attribute to be a healer. Then there had to be somebody that needed healed. And I'm telling you this morning, the word of God is doing a wonderful work right here &gt;&gt; in our midst. All right, I got to wrap this up. I got a long way to go. You guys are awesome. &gt;&gt; You're awesome. You know that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're awesome. He's the best ear doctor you ever had, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Aren't you thankful, Brother Shannon? Through all the other voices, there's a still small voice. saying, "Come on, buddy. I didn't stop it. I haven't left you." I know it doesn't seem like it's a big loud voice. I know sometimes we're like, "Matthew, you're an idiot again. Quit it &gt;&gt; again." You heard me. I want But it's a still small voice. &gt;&gt; And sometimes he doesn't even have to say anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many You're coming with this big game. Your kid does something. They didn't have to hear one thing. Let me tell you, he saw it. &gt;&gt; And he's not here to kick you, &gt;&gt; to pour salt in your wound. He's here to pour in the oil and the wine. He's here to say, "I know you're wounded, but you've come to the right spot this morning. I'm healing you. &gt;&gt; I'm healing you." How many would agree this morning there's healing in the house of God? Oh, Lord. Praise your name. &gt;&gt; Praise your name. I got to hit this one. Actually, I got two more and then I got I haven't even got to the examination yet. &gt;&gt; It's all right. We're going to close. 15 minutes. I'm done. &gt;&gt; All right. Who's keeping track of time? Go ahead and raise your hands. All right. I asked. You're not in trouble. You're human. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 15 minutes. You tell me. All right. Here we go. [Music] I love that kid. He's honest as I'll get out. And he's the best speech pathologist we got. You know what God is telling his little bride? It's time for you to open your mouth. It's time for you to start saying these quotes over your life. It's time for you to start saying the word over your life. It's time for you to rebuke the devil. It's time for you to realize you got a voice. And your voice is thus sayeth the Lord in this hour. He's the greatest speech therapist to let you know you can speak and the devil will have to move. I'm not saying maybe move. He has to move. Brother Timmy, he has to move. All right. Why can't we? &gt;&gt; Sorry. Repeat. &gt;&gt; What is it sitting there telling you you can't do that? God's here to take that out of your life. That your path between here and heaven is nothing but a clear line. That when you speak, it's as though Jesus himself is speaking down here on the face of the earth. Come on. spoken word bride. Come on. You got a speech therapist telling you, "Why don't you loosen up your vocal cords? I got some singing to come from your life." &gt;&gt; What's he going to say, brother Matt? Amaz. Come on, somebody. I am redeemed. What's he going to say? &gt;&gt; Don't try to sing those three songs together. He's the best orthopedic surgeon you ever saw. How do you know that, brother Matt? Ezekiel said, "Can these bones live?" &gt;&gt; And he begin to put those bones back together. &gt;&gt; Come on, little body. We need those bones over there. We need those bones over there. We're on the same team. We can't go together. We can't go without them. &gt;&gt; How about it, internet? We need you. &gt;&gt; We're on the same team. the sickest. The very point of this message was to bring a body together, &gt;&gt; not to separate her, not to maim her, not to twist her thinking. &gt;&gt; So I say to you, if you've got those thoughts against those people, why don't you draw your circle bigger and start praying for them? &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy on them. &gt;&gt; If I was there, I'd want somebody to do that for me. Because evidently, I need an eye doctor cuz I ain't seeing it right. &gt;&gt; He's the greatest neurologist you ever seen, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can be touched by your feeling of your infirmity. He's very sensitive to his bride. &gt;&gt; How many brothers are sensitive to their bride? Okay, don't answer that. Some of you probably aren't. My wife is me. &gt;&gt; She's a part of me. &gt;&gt; When she's upset, I got to dig it out of her cuz she won't tell me. When I'm upset, she ain't got to guess. [Laughter] Poor thing. Brother Ron made fun of us, but God brings two opposites together. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it begins to mold the character of the one that's crazy. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for my helpmate. &gt;&gt; You reach over and grab her hand and squeeze it one time. I want to bring healing to some marriages right quick. &gt;&gt; Vernon, it's been a long time she sat beside ain't it? &gt;&gt; Still care the same for you, don't you? I know you've been through hard times. I know you've said some stupid things. But why don't you just hug one another as you leave this building and say, "Honey, I still love you more today than I did the day we got married." &gt;&gt; Because you know what Jesus is telling you? He said, "Little bride, my hands open. It's about time. Even so come." Oh, Jesus. Oh, glory. I don't know about you, but I'm longing for that day to walk hand in hand with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the greatest neurologist there ever was. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me hit something. How am I doing? &gt;&gt; Good. All right. This was the only one raised his hand. Guts. Now remember, not if you heir or fault against a brother, but if the brother has something you against you, go to him and reconcile. Tell him that you've had a strange feeling about him and you want to make friends and pray and go down at the altar and get the thing out of your midst of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "A funny feeling." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we're doing some We're exposing some wounds right here. taking the Yeah, you've covered it up. Not let anybody know. But I tell you what, Gabe, that guy one time. Hi, brother Gabe. God bless you, buddy. I love him. But we do this. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God's not pleased. &gt;&gt; This many people together, you're bound to have a bazillion opinions. But let me tell you, we're one body. &gt;&gt; We're one family. &gt;&gt; We have one goal. &gt;&gt; And we're all in this together. &gt;&gt; I know some of us are weird. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us rub the other one the wrong way. &gt;&gt; But if you have a funny feeling, you're wrong. &gt;&gt; I know that wouldn't land very good, but that's all right. Preach it. &gt;&gt; God's wanting to tell you, get that thing healed. &gt;&gt; It's time for this body to come together. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Matt, I can't." Then you get to praying, "Lord, help me." I've been there before. &gt;&gt; Lord told me I had something against somebody. I think I've told this here a long time ago. I had Lord showed me I had an enemy. So I started studying on enemies. You know the only enemy you got? The devil and yourself. &gt;&gt; Your brother is not your enemy. that devil that's on him. Yeah, that's your enemy. But your brother, you should be able to love them and treat them the same as you would the one you loved. Is not that an example we have in our very pulpit right here. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Is that not the example that our prophet set for us? &gt;&gt; That brother Billy Paul would say, "You couldn't tell the difference from his enemy or his friends." And brother Billy knew who they were. Because I guarantee you, brother Billy had some funny feelings and wanted to take them out back a little bit. &gt;&gt; Brother Matt. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; That was his daddy &gt;&gt; who he'd seen labor and give everything he could to everybody he possibly could and then for them to stand behind him and talk bad about him. You're talking about some overcoming. Well, come on, little bride. Have you ever done anything wrong? &gt;&gt; Were you guilty? &gt;&gt; And what did the father say to you? Father, forgive them. They know not what they do. Then why can't we with the same spirit do exactly the same thing? &gt;&gt; I want to drop the mic, but I'm not going to. It's good. All right, let me start the examination. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a quick examination. You know the first thing you do when you go to the hospital? Step on the scales. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll just say this. Virginia's been good to me. Ah, happy, happy, happy. When you step on the scales, those scales don't lie. &gt;&gt; Those scales say, "Yep, that's it." Then you look at them and say, "Is that calibrated right?" Yep. Yesterday. Oh, by the way, this word never changes. So, it's always calibrated the right way. It's not for us to change the word. It's for us to weigh and balance out with the word. The Bible says in Daniel when they had the writing on the wall, it says to kill, which means to be weighed in the balance and to be found wanting. I don't know about you, this is not an age to be found wanting, but this is an age to be filled with the Holy Ghost the way he wants you. Listen, if you ain't filled and you want another filling today, I want my cup flowing over that the whole world knows I got what I say I got. &gt;&gt; Not only that, it's got me. &gt;&gt; Next thing I'm skipping. You know those scales? You know what they identified? Those weights of sin that do so easily beset you. How many's ever been in service and been like, "Don't go there. Don't talk about my cell phone. &gt;&gt; Don't talk about that worldwide web &gt;&gt; that catches people." And what's a web do? It's a spider. Keeps them right. &gt;&gt; What's it trying to do? Hold you down. &gt;&gt; I already went there. Sorry. So the doctor tells you, great physician says, "Hey, you got to lose some weight." How many wants that weight to go? Man, where's that button? Everybody's trying to pop a pill and this and that and that. Do whatever you want. But a lot of times to get weight off, it takes a little bit of discipline. &gt;&gt; How many thinks brother Jim's looking good? &gt;&gt; Amen. lost like 50 lbs. I think he said, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; I bet he feels better. You get the weights of sin off of you, you begin to feel better. You begin to walk a little lighter. You begin to not doubt whether God's in your life. You begin to walk in the true word that God has for you. And you put your hand like Enoch and you're going to one of these days walk right out of here because there's no weight. There's nothing of the world holding you down. You know, sometimes you got to quit eating certain things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I know. Oreos, chocolate chips, milk and cookies. Oh, speaking my language. Yep. Speaking your language, it shows. And then sometimes along with eating right, you got to start exercising. The Bible says to exercise your senses. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but you got a sense of faith. Why don't you start exercising your faith that God, you said you didn't like this. I believe I can overcome this. Father, I struggle with this. My father struggle with this. My family struggle with this. But Father, the blood breaks every chain of bondage. And Lord, I'm going to exercise my faith that I can, I will, I do believe. And from that, Father, I'm going to walk with you. Glory. Brother Brandon said faith had what I was want to flex in the pulpit. I did it. But those muscles don't just go pop, but you got to do over and over. It might be a little bit of weight, but you do it 100 times. And then the next day you do it 150. And then from there, the Lord adds more to you. Come on, faith. Come on, little bride. Come on. Start exercising your faith. Mas, won't you pray over your children? I believe your prayer has just as much effect as a husband's prayer as a pastor's prayer. Your prayer moves mountains. &gt;&gt; All right, there comes your excuse. I can't. Why not? &gt;&gt; Why can't we? Thank you, Andrew. Andrew, set me up. Good. Next thing, you know what it's gonna do? How I'm doing? I got five minutes. How much time? Yeah, you got to tell me now. All right. Next thing you do, open your mouth. Thermometer right in your mouth. You know, Leodia, each one of these church aids, he came down and diagnosed them. He came down and diagnosed every one of them. And the great physician told him, "If you'll do my word, if you'll do my word, he that have an ear, let him overcome." The great physician in this end time said, "You are lukewarm. You're neither cold nor hot." He took the thermometer and he placed it right in your mouth. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I want to be on fire. &gt;&gt; Listen, come on, somebody. I'm not talking a little fire. I'm talking like Stephen, a barn barn burning on a windy day. Listen, there was no putting that semi-trail out. If that guy was in there, there was no way I was getting him out. &gt;&gt; But I'm talking to a bride. Listen, let me read you these quote. I'm going finish. I'm going finish. Brother man would tell us, "Stay constant in the state of revival." &gt;&gt; That means there's no excuse to go down. &gt;&gt; I know you don't like me tearing your excuses down, but it's time to go. It's time, little Brad, &gt;&gt; the great physicians in the building. Let me finish here. I ran across this this morning. He said, "He just healed a group of them." Now, that's what when you when you can do something when revival is going on, but let the revival fire dial die down. You can hardly The people are still Christians, but they're not revived into the spirit, the great atmosphere. And that does something. That's why you create that atmosphere at your home. You create the atmosphere. Brother Gabe in the cop car. He was telling me he got caught in a coffee jam the other day. He said, "Listen, a couple messages." He said, "I was having a good old time." Listen, saints of God, there's no excuse. We've got the message in our pockets all the time. If you don't have it on a message app, then get it. &gt;&gt; You can hear the voice anytime, anywhere, any place. &gt;&gt; Brother Matt, I don't have reception. Download it at home. took your excuse away. &gt;&gt; Get into this message. Why? Because we've got to feed on it. He's the best gastronologist there ever was. You need to eat the right thing to produce the right thing. Come on, somebody. The Revelations 10:8 says, "What? Eat the book." There's been a little book. Brother William preached it last night. The seals are open. The book is open. This is a new book. And as we eat this book, it takes an effect on our body and our body has forgiveness for others. Our body has love one for the other. Our body is whole. &gt;&gt; You guys going to kill me. Is the people are still Christians, but they're not revived in the spirit. It's just like in a forge in a black blacksmith shop. You got to get the iron hot before you go to pounding on it on the ammo. You don't you'll never straighten it out. &gt;&gt; I know. I just stuck a thermometer in some of your mouth. And even though you sit in these kind of services, you can still be as cold &gt;&gt; as a bump on a pickle in a fridge. My show, let me know. I don't care if you're sitting in services where God's moving. What's the thermometer say in your mouth? What's it say in your mouth? Listen, he's a great physician. And he's also a consuming fire. I don't know about you, you get close to a fire, &gt;&gt; it get hot. You draw nigh to me, I'll draw nigh to you. And I guarantee you, you cannot stay in the same lukewarm cold condition. Listen, you see these people dancing down here. You said, "But man, I've never danced." That's all right. Come on down and get into it. Come on down and just raise your hands. Maybe you're not a dancer, but why don't you raise your hands and let the world know whose side you're on? &gt;&gt; Well, glory. I'm not saying you have to dance. I'm not saying that. Don't quote me as that. But I'm just saying let the world know. Let God know I'm on this side. &gt;&gt; That boy got some happy feet and I'm happy to see it. Let me quit. &gt;&gt; How many loves him? &gt;&gt; I got to hit this one more thing. We're done. The root of bitterness. &gt;&gt; Some of us have every right to be bitter about something. &gt;&gt; You tell me the situation, I'm probably you've told 40 people and they've agreed with you 100%. But you know what God says? You have no right to do it. [Music] Brother Matt, how do I get that out? It goes way deep. 25 years ago, and that thing's blossomed pretty good in your life &gt;&gt; cuz you've done nothing but water it with your testimony, &gt;&gt; man. It gonna be a while before I get back up here. I tell you that. But why don't you just turn right around and say, "Father, I forgive them." &gt;&gt; And Lord, help me to be able to come to the place that I'm able to meet them face to face and say, "I forgive you. You hurt me really bad, but I forgive you, and I'm trying my best to love you." You know what it does? It grabs that root of business from the bottom. I hear it shaking right now. Hallelujah. Devil, you thought you had the hold. But as as the great physician, maybe he's diagnosed your case this morning. But let me tell you your prognosis. The thoughts that I had of you are to bring you to an expected end. And it took a service like this for me to diagnose your case, come right to your pew and let you know I am your healer. Musicians come. Hallelujah. Psalms 107 and 20 said he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions. I just caught that. Their destructions cuz you stay in that condition. It's going to be your destruction because right now you have a choice to make. Lord, I heard a great physician. And Lord, I don't want to just be a hearer of the word, but Lord, I want to be a doer of the word. And Lord, I can't do it. That's right. But the Bible says, pray this word back to him. I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me. How about you say it again? I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. How many's been strengthened this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know why? He's here. Why don't we make him welcome? Why don't we tell him how great he is? When we tell him how awesome of a God he is, &gt;&gt; why don't we tell him, let's just make love to him for just a few minutes. Key, sister, I love this song. In moments like me, I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus [Music] in moment like these. Why don't you tell him this morning? I lift up my hand. I lift up my hands to you. Sing it with all your heart. How many thankful he's been here this morning? Hallelujah. Singing I love you, Lord. singing, "I love [Music] you, Lord. I love you, Lord. I [Music] In moments like these, I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands. close to you, Lord. [Music] In moments like these, I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to you. singing how singing I love you Lord. [Music] Singing I love [Music] you Lord. singing, "I love you, my Lord. I love you." Let's pray together. Maybe just raise your put your hand over on your neighbor. pray one for another. Was this brother Ron last night? He said, "There's a light that goes between you. There's power in your prayer. Why don't we just heal? There's healing in the building this morning. Why don't you let your prayer go forth? Don't pray for yourself. Pray for the one next to you. Maybe a husband, you know her needs. Just begin to pray over them with everything you got as we pray. Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we bow our heads, Lord, in your great great physician's presence. Father God, we humble oursel, Father. God, you see us. Lord, you see every need that's represented in the building, Father. God, I pray that you touch each need right now. God, you've ministered your word, Lord. And your word said it went forth and it healed them, Father. So, Father, may they start seeing healing where there were wounds, Lord. Lord, where there was bitterness, God, may they see new life spring from it, Lord. God, where there was hatred, God, may they see your hand in love come, Father. God, you see the physical healing that needs to go on in the building. Lord, as we lay hands on one another according to thy word, they lay hands on them and they were healed. God, I pray right now, bless each one, Lord Jesus. We give you praise. We give you glory. Thank you for passing by our way in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. Reach out and touch the Lord. I think it's F. Reach out and touch the Lord. You'll find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry. He's passing by this moment. Your needs to supply. Reach out and touch the Lord as he goes by.

How many could say that the word of the Lord is good? &gt;&gt; By show of hands, did he speak to you this morning? &gt;&gt; I know he came by my way. Brother Matt, thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Let's give him a hand, a clap of praise. My God is awesome. My God is awome. He can move mountains, keep me in the valley, and hide me from the rain.
