come around october they're going to get another edition hallelujah congratulations amen it's just fulfilling scripture husbands love your wife amen amen amen amen he's good to us at me amen today i would like to look at an orchestrated masterpiece i just feel to share some things that's on my heart i'd like for us to go to isaiah chapter 53 remembering that every prophet being a writer they would write the words of god as god would speak to them maybe some songwriters that are sitting in the building today that or even that will hear this you get us you get a song kind of like a preacher gets a sermon and you may just get a couple of words and then it will add from one word to another word it was a man one time and i'm sorry to pull it this way but there was a man one time that was and share what two different ways a man one time went to to nashville and he he was young he was he was just a skinny boy and he went into the producers and said i have a gift to be able to write songs and sing them and so he handed him a couple of songs and he said well here's a an empty paper if you're really gifted if there's here's an empty paper you you go outside and sit down at that chair and you write us a song and come back in just a few minutes and then we may believe in you he sat there for a little bit and he came back in about 15 minutes later there was a song there that became one of the top songs that was ever sung today i met you on the street my heart fell at your feet i can't help it but i'm still in love with you his name was hanker williams the song that you heard just a little bit ago was quite a writer and he lost it all in losing it all his family had went across the seas and he had had to stay back his entire family would would perish in the middle of the ocean you know not no doubt the devil whispered in his ears and so he chartered a ship and he got on that ship and he they took him to the place where that happened that wreck happened and he was standing there feeling really sorry for himself about all of his loss and he was leaning looking down into that water the words of it is well came to him so let me just say this to you whether it's cancer where there's very great difficulties it's well we're just hours before the rapture and we're believing we're getting ready to step over and no matter how dark that your world is there's sunshine coming down your way amen and we so love you today with all of our hearts now isaiah is quite a writer as well isaiah is going to write some scripture and he's going to tell us behold a virgin shall conceive now he would say the believers of that message and maybe the for hundreds of years they wondered why didn't it happen if he was a prophet but that word would circle for hundreds of years and then would be manifested on the earth one day you got under inspiration and these are more than just mere words but this is the power of god released isaiah chapter 53 and says it like this who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground and he hath no form nor calmliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid is it where our face is from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne out griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him smitten stricken and smitten of god and afflicted i love these scriptures i want us to read this next one together if we could but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen maybe you ever need your dr sherrod this evening just raise your hand before the lord almighty god we're a very needy people just moments ago i received a video from ukraine a church standing rejoicing special services going on there today father you're with them in an incredible storm and it just proves to us that your eye is on the sparrow and you're watching over our lives the god that is in ukraine is the same god that's here and around the world this morning angels have been dispatched to watch over us they're greater than any presidential guards that there could be but father we ask you now that you would come and touch our bodies and minister to us lord minister across this audience just now lord may there come a supercharge from the heavenlies down lord come by my way and touch my own body lord across this audience may it be a sweep of your presence now as the word is released and words have power words have inspiration words have strength dear god i ask you that you would anoint vocal cords and ears to hear and we give you all the glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen you may be seated in revelations chapter 21 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful these words have been written about 2 000 years now they were vision form god thought it then it became inspiration and john begin to write it and it's been read for about 2 000 years uttered across human lips but today i stand before the great orchestra that is preparing to step from this dimension to another dimension revelations 5 same writer same author and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain has redeemed us to god by the blood of every out of every kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign upon the earth isaiah chapter 60 and verse 1 arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising let me just back this up just for a moment with the scripture for a foundation in ii peter chapter 1 and verse 16 for we have not followed comingly devised fables but we have been made known unto you the power and the coming of the lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty this is more than just some poetic justice we stood there and saw the glory of god we were in that holy mountain when moses and elijah appeared and we heard the voice of god we're more than just preachers we've met him verse 19 we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost i'll just read some more if i if i can take it from the book of elijah if i can do this just now he said the church has not realized recognized her day like israel back in her promised land she she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there why national force put her in her place and now i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride oh what a gathering the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life we'll put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then then she's in christ will put her in her place no national force will do that but the national force did drive israel to the homeland national forces will put the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god the power of god will um we'll raise the bride into glory that's what we're under that's what we're experiencing about a year ago i was awakened with a vision wasn't a dream i was awakened with a vision and this vision was total darkness it looked like it was just right at evening time just like like it was so dark you could just barely see for those hunters that's one of the prime times for hunting and it's just right at dusk you just you can just barely see and i was standing in that darkness in front of a great big gates and i was standing i was preaching on the other side of the gate i saw brother tim pruitt working brother tim pruitt is preaching in louisiana today brother donnie is preaching in johnson city men around the world are standing at their pulpits proclaiming in the midst of this darkness under inspiration orchestrated by god himself this message is more than a man this was not william branham's message this was the lamb's message and we stand under the influence of that message and we scream to a lost and dying world and we're screaming into the darkness coming to the ark of safety before it's too late as we would gather one after another the gates would open and i heard the most beautiful singing i'd ever heard in my life and as it was just beyond that gate and the light was so bright and it seemed like the light was coming out of that gate like beams of beams of light shining and i looked at it and i i thought how glorious those beams of light is one by one people were stepping from that darkness into that glorious light and i thought of our job i thought of our situation our passion to preach the message you know some time ago our worship came under criticism songs would be taken from of the blood would be taken out of churches they wanted people not to rejoice well we wouldn't have none of that here i want you to understand this is a place it was trees on this hill this hill needed to be bulldozed this hill needed to be be arranged it hasn't always been like it is many of you men have worked incredible but this church was built to serve god this was built to be a lighthouse to shine in a dark world our worship is not to a man or to excite one another but our worship is to jesus christ birds worship horses animals scream out to the maker an eagle was brother kenny and sister rachel took pictures an eagle just right down the way here flew down over top of their car and we were coming by just as he had his camera and that eagle screamed down over top of our car and was making its way back up i i don't know if i've ever been quite that close to a wild eagle like that and i thought about this place as a white place that's welcome it's a welcome place for eagles when brother harold shifflett was was taken way too soon we were loading his body into the into the casket three eagles begin to fly around the front of our building here i i think god has a great way of how that he takes his children home brother brandon would stand and tell us about going beyond the curtain of time there wasn't nobody else talking like that excuse me this age has been shown every sign and we're not going to get another but brother branham he talked to us can you imagine how difficult knowing the criticism but he would walk to the pulpit and talk to us about the angel of the lord in the cave talk about the angel lord is here now and knowing there would be a collection of people that make all kind of fun of it call it everything in the world he would tell about the going beyond the curtain of time and experience beyond any mortal words and we found ourself in it when we screamed we're resting on that this is not the end this is this is only really the beginning where we'll step one day beyond that realm and many of our loved ones have stepped an experience in that now and he would stand in he and he would say it and he would say it with all honesty and then he would tell us whatever you do don't miss it talk about what an atmosphere that it is there was a story that was related in the in historical days moody would actually be one of the ones that would begin to tell the story about an armor and company's son of how that all the girls that was in the community there didn't fit the character that he was looking for a lot of girls a lot of pretty girls but he was looking for but he was sent he was sent west to to go to a ranch to look to see if he could find a wife and all the girls there dressed themselves up they planned to party they had live music and this boy as he began to as he began to watch the event what he was seeing was just like home and he was looking for something that was real not artificial or not put on he was looking for something real and so he excused himself the party went on the music went on and he was standing beside of the corral maybe having his foot up on the corral watching watching the night maybe looking at the stars and he hears the swish of water and there was a girl that was there that was throwing out the the water from washing the dishes barefoot she didn't have a beautiful dress and she wasn't all fancied up and he began to have a conversation with her and as he begins to have a conversation he finds that in her she was the reflection of what he was looking for orphan child but she was what he was looking for you how are what our lord jesus has been looking for since before the foundation of the world he knew where you would be he knew what condition that you would be in he was not ashamed of how he found many of you in trouble and in deep sins he would provide the blood that would wash away every stain of your life he would bring you peace he would bring you strength [Applause] it would be more than churchianity it would be more than signing a book or shaking a preacher's hand or turning over a new leaf but he would give his own life to live on the inside of you for you see he would deposit something on the inside of you that you were looking for all your life and in that moment it just clicked and you came to life and in that moment you would never be the same he sealed his conversation and his promise with the kiss she had to go back to cleaning dishes now i want to just pull some things together here to those other girls it was just like i'd like to tell y'all how the angel came and met me in a cave i i i'd like to tell you i like to tell you i was hunting and i got three squirrels i tell you i tell you i saw a vision of 42 inch caribou i'll tell you sir if you can believe your eyes will come open i'll tell you mr spencer you're going to be well [Applause] you see one night i was in i was struggling and i had a dream i dreamed these boys and us and connie that sitting on the stage and she's sitting there because i asked her to she don't want to but i asked her to i believe one day when generals of god are gathered together and brother jackie will be standing pretty close to each other and we'll hear our name called i'm going to be cheering for you jackie benton amen i'm going to be cheering for you you like william branham step toward the stair steps seem like in that dream the men were gathered together great generals brother jackie you'll walk up you'll walk up to those stairs and a really precious woman will put her arm under your arms and you'll start walking up to the steps i told sister connie coming down the road today i said sister connie one day i'll walk to those stairs oh yeah and i walk up and you'll put your arm under my arm and we're gonna spend eternity i read a i read a song to you today i saw a new heaven and i saw a new earth that's what we're built for in this dream i saw brother branham we were sitting kind of like you are now and i was sitting quite on the edge and brother branham was speaking he was young he had on the most beautiful suit i'd ever seen it was a it was a fabric like i'm i've not ever seen here and he was i was kind of enamored with that i i liked that and he was kind of speaking he was telling kind of telling stories kind of almost in the same vein of talking like i am now and he was just kind of going and he came toward the end of the sermon and and he turned and he walks right straight to me i was sitting about where that that speaker would be and we were sitting on the line connie was sitting beside of me and the boys were sitting there william was sitting with us and he just walked right straight to me and he just kind of come right right to me and he handed me a book he said would you like to have the book that i've used tonight and it was the way of a true prophet and i told him i said brother branham i believe this message with all my heart and i preach it with everything that is within me and he just patted me on the cheek he just patted me on the cheek and he said you're gonna get well ron [Applause] now these are just seasons of inspiration that i'm just dropping to you brother branham would preach a sing a song at the end of snow white dove and as he would sing it he would come to the last verse and then he would make up a verse now that verse was his life though i have suffered in many ways i cried for healing both night and day now maybe in your life you went down a lot of very difficult very difficult situations but god knew before he released you into the earth the difficulty that you would have to go through knowing the things that you would have to go through he he he prepared for your coming and i want you to understand never feel like you're ever alone god's with you he's made some promises to you i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you to the very end and you may feel like you're at the bottom of your bell you may feel like that you've just turned your drink over you may feel like the world is upside down put it on the wrong side i can't see that side but i understand this god knowed before even your arrival all of your valleys all of your hurts all of your sorrows all of the things that you would go through he knew it all and yet he prepared for your arrival he prepared for the strength that you would need to get through it just as any great orchestra would be any great orchestra there's there's an elected people that comes understand when the national convention or the national orchestra is played not just anybody gets to show up and play it's just not to just anybody it's to a select group of people and just when the devil whispers in your ear remind him this i didn't put myself here [Music] i can't even keep myself here but god that is rich in mercy place something on the inside of me that allows me to be a part of this great orchestra my life is playing the music my life my time period is playing whoa it's playing scripture it's playing a song you may not hear it but the angels stand in awe of your life [Applause] i understand not everybody can play the trumpet not everybody can play the drum not everybody can play the piano but everybody's got a part now don't you worry about casting people out of the orchestra god knows who he invited and quit looking at yourself as some feeble member there's no big eyes and little views god don't have a bunch of stars that he brings together where everybody stands and barrels everybody's apart and complementary to one another we're not feeding on personalities here we're feeding on the body word of the son of man our whole ambition is that our life plays the sheep music perfectly when we can get past that i'm the important one when we can get past it's all about me and realize it's only all about the music the reason that you see people that think that they're so important they really haven't been born again yet [Music] the reason that people can't get beyond themselves is they haven't met christ the reason that people shun the holy ghost and the experience of god living in her life is because they've never met him and if can you can you i heard andrew speaking last night try to explain the burning bush experience you can't try to explain the electricity in a cave with an angel of god and every time he comes it almost takes your life knowing as you're telling the story he's only standing a few feet away now some of you were delivered the the sheep music and you got it when you first started playing nobody likes to be around the one that first starts maybe it's a banjo it's the most obnoxious thing in the entire world sister cassie played in a lot of special concerts she married a redneck she was still in college and she was preparing to play in a lot of special places and play in the music and she said she was playing one day and she looked she looked across the room and there was matthew and he had a recording of a turkey call and he would listen to the turkey call and he cut it off and he'd try to do it and he listened and she's playing bach in one room and turkey call is going on in the other room don't try to explain god don't try to explain god god knows how to put all of these things together and he's got him coming from australia and from south america and he's got him coming from all over the world every nation every nation under her banner is stepping forward hallelujah [Applause] brother brown saw one just kind of stepping out of line a little bit and he screamed stay alive stay in line and if you hear us preaching and all of a sudden it comes to your address listen thank god for that because that is the that is the conductor screaming to you sailing but brother ron i've struggled he knows your struggle he didn't tell you away he knows your your insecurities and your complexes he knows your private situations he knows the things that dominate your life yet you keep reading you keep reading you keep reading whether it's acts 2 38 or romans 8 or psalms 23 you just kept reading and you read the word and you apply the word and you read the word and the token is applied and the life that's in the word lives now on the inside of you and now you just breathe it's no longer trying to do it you just breathe now so we're going to have a massive concert we'll just call it reunion day could we just do that let's just call it you know for lack of a better word let's call it reunion day you know that's kind of where you get everybody together you don't just get the ones that are here together but you get those that are that died in faith they come together i mean the message is there we've had a prophet you know and everybody's doing their place in the world they come together and there comes a time you know there's a certain time that's set now don't you worry about time you you'll be there don't you worry sometimes you get in a hurry but it ain't time yet are you with me and it's not way out yonder but now it's getting real close and so it's time to start bringing people into their spot now remember now remember this the world's gonna get to be a spectator are you with me now now i've always marveled at people that come to a place like that i i had a reason for wearing a bow tie those kind of concerts are they're dress-up concerts you don't wear your hog pins attire you know you wear your your very best now you know and and you have a seat number and and and you go and you're sitting there and if you've got an appreciation for orchestra you're going and you're sitting in the seat you know there's not a word that says turn off your cell phone it's not a word quit watching movies while the service is going on nothing that says that your sports team that it's going to work out but you sit there in full attendance you're ready because you know that the greatest orchestra that's ever been played is now getting ready to play now some of those people have came from australia and some of them have came from south america and some of them came from tennessee and some from arkansas and louisiana and even us from virginia will come to take our place it won't be about what size home we have what kind of car that we drive the difficulties that we've been through over the last weeks all of that will be hidden are you with me it's kind of like charleston heston getting ready to play moses they're not going to tell us how many wives that he's had and how many children and grandchildren and all of this is going to be in his life and how rich he is or where he lives at all you're going to see is moses it's not about our trouble help me preach it's not about what we're going through in our life this is not about cancer my life is not defined by cancer it's not been defined by by fire or fallen off of a house it's not defined by that it's defined by the sheep music that i've been able to be a part of when i realized my life is more than my humanity my weaknesses and my failures [Applause] god wants to borrow a body that he can play a message through so when i take my place i'm not trying to outdo anybody else setting amongst millions i'm not trying to be better than anybody else the sheet music that is laid before me i don't even get the option of trying to play it like i want to play it the composer heard it a certain way and no doubt he throwed away a lot of paper but one day he created a masterpiece when you hear beethoven you don't hear his sorrow how he lost his hearing and he became isolated from the world this may this may be a shock to you but i'm one guy that loves classical music probably the biggest redneck preacher in the message and here i love classical music you probably love things that i don't love but god built me that way he built me that way sister connie and i sometimes just prepare we're preparing for bed and we're about an hour before going to bed and i'll just start playing her music and she'll just sit over in the other other thing looking at recipes and ron's playing her love songs and classical music and i remind her you want this music to keep playing because the day the music stops in this house gonna be tears so sometimes we need to appreciate the music while it's playing i preach in my heart i don't know any other way but i pray for my heart and the reason i want to go here is i'm afraid too many people walk in to services like this and they keep asking themselves the same question why am i here with an attitude you say brother ron but that's way out of line because i picked up on your spirit and i want to tell you don't bypass your day of grace people in hell would love to have your pew they were millionaires and billionaires and they were hollywood stars and they were great people in life but they didn't have time for jesus but god gave you time for jesus don't let your seat i don't have time for it explain that in hell why you didn't have time to read the shoot see sheet music why you didn't have time to surrender your life to be a part of the greatest orchestra that's ever been assembled just because you're talented just because you can you can do great things in life don't mean you're committed how many people go through college and waste four and five years and hundreds of thousands of dollars how many doctors wait on patients they really hate their job how many people that get into an airplane and want to become an astronaut but there's only just a handful about 10 a year is selected for the program a lot of people go to church but not everybody gets to play in the orchestra i'm not going to get done so i'm just going to finish it like this i'll tell you i throw the dishwater out i know this don't mean nothing to you but i throwed the dishwater out and i heard his voice he caught my attention and he talked to me i'll tell you i'm just gonna be honest with you i may be like joseph but i'm gonna be honest with you he told me that he didn't want women like you but he asked me would i be his wife and he told me in about a year he's going to come back for us he told me a year from now abraham you're going to have a baby he told me a year from now tim pruitt you're going to have a baby that you can hold in your arms if you knew what i knew i could hear those girls go she is so silly isn't she so vain that she thinks that the owner himself come here and he picked her i need some eggs i need some eggs and and i need you to i need you to make up my room okay i'll do it i'll do the best that i know how to do and she just kept working and they did their year they did their whirly-ism they went to their parties they went to their nonsense they didn't have time for church she sat there she watched them but you you see she was the only one with promise you know there will be churches churches and there will be bride's brides but you're the only one with promise you can make fun if you want to you cast aside if you want to or you can get on the ark you know when it came down and let me just let me just finish for you for the strength of my body let me just say this to you when it came down to the last couple of days she was getting that dress ready none of the other girls had a revelation get the dress ready she was getting a dress ready and you know what when she put on the message of the hour it fit she didn't have to pull out a part and pull out a part and pull out a part and she didn't say this is for them or this is for that or this is somebody else's thought we need to rewrite the bible she didn't have to go all through that she just said i put it on i've eat the book and it lives [Music] [Applause] now maybe this is what some of you are experiencing right now she walks out on the porch and she's dressed they didn't get breakfast this morning she had did that for the last time i like this part she washed dishes last time she made her own bed up last time she swept the four the last time took her chemo last time i'm laura [Applause] she walked out now the fun really started i don't know if you're watching my internet but i want you to know i'm making a prophecy here this is more than a sermon we're going to come to this building last time we're going to walk in our pew last time we're going to be singing songs last time we're going to be screaming amen the last time because the orchestra has been assembled and you're hearing the music called rapture resurrection you're hearing it being played if you can identify what's going on in our churches it's called bride's revival it's called third pool we were waiting for the junction to change and if you don't understand the music it sounds like a bunch of racket to you but if you know what the composer wants and the director calls for it you just play your part [Applause] there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet bar and by and i'm going to meet you meet you over there beyond the sky such singing you have heard never heard by mortal here it'll be glorious i do declare for god's own son will be thy leading one at that meeting in the air you have heard of little
