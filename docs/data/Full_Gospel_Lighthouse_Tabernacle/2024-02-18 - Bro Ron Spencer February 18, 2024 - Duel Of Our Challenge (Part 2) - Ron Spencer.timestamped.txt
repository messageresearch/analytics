[1:08:13] this pull pit he was my height and he
[1:08:15] was a little bit thicker than I am and

[1:08:50] coming down on him and his vicious claws
[1:08:52] if they ever got a a halt of him it was
[1:08:55] instant death and he chased him across
[1:08:59] the couch and he chased him under the
[1:09:02] cabinets and he chased him through the
[1:09:03] living room and he chased him all over
[1:09:06] the place and and finally he got up on a
[1:09:08] bookshelf where there was a bottle of
[1:09:10] wine that was open and he ran up that
[1:09:13] bottle of wine and he went down in it
[1:09:15] and he
[1:09:21] went finally got to the bottom and he
[1:09:24] pushed and he he came back up and he
[1:09:27] worked his way out of the top of that
[1:09:29] bottle of
[1:09:32] wine and he'd got into enough wine while
[1:09:35] down
[1:09:38] there he said where is that

[1:09:51] into a bottle of wine of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:58] are you getting me and you may GLE for a
[1:10:00] little
[1:10:02] while and you may think I'm going to
[1:10:04] drown but just
[1:10:06] wait climb out the
[1:10:09] top devil you picked on me all week
[1:10:13] long where is that devil
[1:10:19] at the scripture tells us and I'll just
[1:10:22] paraphrase for you
[1:10:24] Paul we know the devil just told the
[1:10:27] this man that was standing there and he
[1:10:30] was trying to cast The Devil out and he
[1:10:32] says Paul we
[1:10:34] know and Jesus we
[1:10:38] know but you we don't
[1:10:41] know I wonder if he knows who we
[1:10:45] are I wonder if we've got enough of the
[1:10:48] power of the Holy Ghost living on the
[1:10:49] inside of us that we are a proper
[1:10:52] representative of Jesus Jesus Christ and
[1:10:55] he's literally terrified when we wake up
[1:10:58] in the morning and we begin to shake the
[1:11:00] kingdom of hell when we pray that's the
[1:11:03] most powerful thing that we do is pray
[1:11:06] and read our Bibles and arm oursel for
[1:11:09] the day don't never
[1:11:11] neglect don't never neglect to not do
[1:11:14] that notice the scriptures in
[1:11:17] Revelations chapter 9 12 and verse 9 he
[1:11:20] said and the Great Dragon was cast out
[1:11:23] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:11:26] and and Satan which deceiveth the whole
[1:11:28] world he was cast out into the Earth and
[1:11:31] his angels were cast out with him and I
[1:11:34] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:11:37] has come salvation and strength and the
[1:11:40] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[1:11:42] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[1:11:46] is cast down which accused them before
[1:11:49] God day and night notice these next
[1:11:51] words and they over came
[1:11:55] him I'm a part of that they and they
[1:11:59] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:12:02] and by the word of their
[1:12:06] testimony amen give me just a moment my
[1:12:09] eyes are not working well for me Hebrews
[1:12:12] CH 12 and verse 1 wherefore see and we
[1:12:16] are also compassed about with so great a
[1:12:19] cloud of
[1:12:22] witnesses
[1:12:24] Homer
[1:12:25] Wayne your moms and dads that have
[1:12:27] passed on they're watching now now it's
[1:12:30] your turn to run the race let us lay
[1:12:34] aside every weight and the sin which
[1:12:36] does so easily beset us and let us run
[1:12:40] with patience the race that is set
[1:12:42] before us now notice what our Focus has
[1:12:45] got to be looking unto
[1:12:49] Jesus looking under Jesus you'll get
[1:12:52] disappointed if you look into and
[1:12:53] anybody else the author and the finisher
[1:12:57] of our faith who for the joy what set
[1:13:00] before him endured the cross and
[1:13:02] despising the shame and is sat down at
[1:13:04] the right hand of the Throne of God
[1:13:07] brother brandom called the enemy on the
[1:13:10] scene and he preaches a series actually
[1:13:12] I think it's five different times on on
[1:13:14] the
[1:13:15] trial and brother brandham was they
[1:13:18] might have thought it all it's just
[1:13:19] another sermon but it really
[1:13:22] wasn't brother brandom just didn't pick
[1:13:24] a text just to be picking a text but he
[1:13:27] was actually bringing the
[1:13:30] enemy to a
[1:13:32] standoff may we call it a
[1:13:35] duel somebody's going to die in a
[1:13:41] duel somebody's going to die in a duel
[1:13:44] I'm sorry somebody gets
[1:13:46] shot somebody wasn't quick enough or
[1:13:49] somebody wasn't accurate
[1:13:51] enough brother BR said I'm going to have
[1:13:54] a a court trial and the case is the word
[1:13:58] of God promised versus the world what a
[1:14:03] statement the word of God
[1:14:06] promised versus the world now we're
[1:14:10] going to set it like a court trial for
[1:14:12] just a little bit before you come to
[1:14:15] this prayer line he said the word of God
[1:14:18] versus the world now that's the case the
[1:14:22] cause for this and indictment is a
[1:14:24] breach of promise that of God's promises
[1:14:28] they claim that God hasn't kept his
[1:14:31] promise the prosecutor Attorney in this
[1:14:34] case is Satan and and he is the world's
[1:14:39] witness because he is of the world the
[1:14:42] defendant of this case is almighty
[1:14:48] God the defense witness of the case is
[1:14:52] the Holy Ghost ghost and we're going to
[1:14:55] call them to a trial just for a few
[1:14:57] moments and he lays it out the
[1:15:00] prosecuting witness that he is bringing
[1:15:03] to defend this case is Mr
[1:15:08] unbelief Mr skeptic have you ever dealt
[1:15:11] with any of these
[1:15:13] guys and Mr
[1:15:17] impatient I'm going to ask you again
[1:15:19] have you ever met with Mr unbelief
[1:15:23] Mr
[1:15:25] skeptic also can be called Mr
[1:15:28] critic and Mr
[1:15:31] impatient now we're going to give them a
[1:15:33] trial the court is called to order the
[1:15:36] prosecutor calls his witness Mr unbelief
[1:15:39] and he takes his stand first now I'm
[1:15:42] going to let you go and listen to those
[1:15:45] sermons that you'll get it better but
[1:15:48] I'd like to just kind of bring it and
[1:15:50] bring some events to to be a reminder to
[1:15:53] today of whose side that we're
[1:15:57] on I'd like to remind the devil today if
[1:16:01] you're want to have a duel with the
[1:16:02] bride of Jesus Christ around the world I
[1:16:06] want to remind you that it wasn't too
[1:16:09] many years ago in the time of Eternity
[1:16:13] it wasn't too many years ago Satan you
[1:16:17] watched brother brandham go to a
[1:16:22] cave and you watched brother random in
[1:16:25] that cave he was praying about some
[1:16:28] things and you watched an angel walk in
[1:16:31] the entrance of that cave and as he
[1:16:34] walks in the entrance of that cave he
[1:16:38] begins to tell our Prophet
[1:16:40] now fear
[1:16:42] not I'm sent from the presence of the
[1:16:46] Lord and he begins to tell him of his
[1:16:50] commission how that he would go around
[1:16:52] the world world and he would begin to as
[1:16:56] he would tell him in a paraphrasing he
[1:16:58] would pray for kings and potentates and
[1:17:00] he would he would pray for great and
[1:17:02] have great meetings around the world
[1:17:05] even brother brandham would begin to
[1:17:08] tell him like Moses you know all of his
[1:17:12] excuses like you
[1:17:15] do but I want to ask you Satan did that
[1:17:20] not come to
[1:17:22] pass
[1:17:23] did not that angel stand at the pull pit
[1:17:26] with him at every
[1:17:28] service and they would ask brother
[1:17:30] brandom do you get
[1:17:32] nervous no no the Angel's standing with
[1:17:36] me and he told me to do this I want to
[1:17:39] ask you little bride no matter where
[1:17:41] you're at around the world we shouldn't
[1:17:43] be
[1:17:44] nervous we shouldn't be tore all to
[1:17:46] pieces we shouldn't let Mr skeptic and
[1:17:49] Mr unbelief come so against us and tell
[1:17:53] we falter and fail he's with
[1:17:57] us that's greater than a mighty preacher
[1:18:00] that's much greater than a mighty
[1:18:01] General our Lord Jesus Christ The Mighty
[1:18:04] Angel we're under his
[1:18:09] influence I'm glad to be standing where
[1:18:11] we are today could I just take you to
[1:18:14] another place very quickly it's in
[1:18:20] Houston it's in Houston there's a large
[1:18:22] crowd crow that is there estimates are
[1:18:25] it's in the
[1:18:26] thousands and and there's a doct
[1:18:30] best who's been a skeptic that don't
[1:18:32] believe in Divine Healing and he wants
[1:18:35] to be the representative of the church
[1:18:38] that will stop this movement stop this
[1:18:41] fanatical movement and and put a heart
[1:18:44] to it why he's he's a man that's great
[1:18:48] learned and he's quite a speaker well
[1:18:51] he's even he's so confident he's he's
[1:18:53] hired he's hired photographers to stand
[1:18:56] on the scene and he knows he's got
[1:18:58] people that's there behind him and and
[1:19:01] and so you know brother brandham is to
[1:19:03] be the man that he's going to Crossfire
[1:19:06] but he doesn't realize that brother
[1:19:07] branham's got a
[1:19:12] representative and Dr Bosworth says
[1:19:15] brother brandom I'll take this there's
[1:19:17] no need in you getting into an argument
[1:19:19] or all of that I I'll take this for you
[1:19:22] you know he was an old steady man yeah
[1:19:25] he was a steady man he was a real friend
[1:19:27] to brother brownon when a lot of
[1:19:28] preachers had walked away he was a real
[1:19:31] friend to brother brandham and he said
[1:19:33] now don't be arguing oh I won't
[1:19:35] argue I I won't argue at all I won't
[1:19:38] fuss with him at all and you know Dr
[1:19:40] best makes his case and and you know he
[1:19:44] does a fine job of making his case but
[1:19:47] Dr Bosworth he just hinges the entire
[1:19:51] debate on one question
[1:19:54] question I want to think about that
[1:19:56] Satan just one question you couldn't do
[1:19:58] nothing with
[1:20:00] it you couldn't do anything with one
[1:20:03] question you're smart you're intelligent
[1:20:06] you you've known you've got a great case
[1:20:08] load that you have had all the way down
[1:20:10] from the fall and even in heaven you
[1:20:12] created a war but you stumbled in I want
[1:20:15] to remind you you
[1:20:17] stumbled you stumbled in Houston and you
[1:20:21] couldn't answer one question
[1:20:24] what does the compound names of
[1:20:28] Jehovah have to do with Jesus
[1:20:32] Christ well he knew if he answered that
[1:20:37] question Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Nissa if
[1:20:41] he answered that question he's tangled
[1:20:44] up in his own
[1:20:46] fight and then he begins to make
[1:20:48] accusations but he doesn't realize
[1:20:50] brother brandham is up in a place and he
[1:20:52] had promised I'm going to stay up there
[1:20:54] out of the freay but there's an
[1:20:58] angel you challenge a duel and you
[1:21:00] challenge a fight God IMM
[1:21:03] it Goliath challenged God made
[1:21:07] it are you with me put him put men in a
[1:21:10] lion's den God will go there put them in
[1:21:13] a furnace of fire God will go
[1:21:17] there put them against a r sea god'll go
[1:21:21] there put a ride just before the coming
[1:21:24] of the Lord god'll go
[1:21:29] there when the enemy says it ain't going
[1:21:31] to happen look how far you've been and
[1:21:33] look how dark it is look at a world
[1:21:35] falling apart it's supposed to got to go
[1:21:39] [Applause]
[1:21:43] there he steps down out of the audience
[1:21:46] as he walks down and he comes down and
[1:21:50] comes through the people walks to the
[1:21:53] stage well that's greater than any
[1:21:55] president ever made a
[1:21:59] walk he steps to the
[1:22:02] pulpit and brother Brandon was very
[1:22:06] courteous to Dr
[1:22:08] best he wasn't in no fighting Mode God
[1:22:12] don't have to fight he was very
[1:22:15] courteous and he actually was thankful
[1:22:16] to him he was
[1:22:19] thankful he was very nice to him
[1:22:24] and then he begin to ask the audience
[1:22:26] how many of you been healed in the
[1:22:27] meeting this
[1:22:29] week and thousands of people raised
[1:22:32] their hands stood to their feet there's
[1:22:35] the
[1:22:36] answer it's more than just preaching a
[1:22:39] sermon but there's the
[1:22:41] answer there's the answer he heard a
[1:22:44] whirl start coming through the building
[1:22:47] whirl come down he' heard that whirl
[1:22:50] before you see brother Brandon wasn't
[1:22:52] standing standing alone isn't that right
[1:22:55] Satan and neither are we standing alone
[1:22:57] isn't that
[1:22:59] right we're not standing here by our own
[1:23:02] accord isin't that
[1:23:04] right and that whirl came down across
[1:23:07] the place and as it comes and they're
[1:23:09] taking
[1:23:11] pictures listen a greater than William
[1:23:14] brandham was standing
[1:23:17] there you say well brother Ron you guys
[1:23:19] call his name too much oh I don't think
[1:23:21] we'd ever do that
[1:23:23] are you with me now he was God's
[1:23:25] representative to the
[1:23:27] Earth and and they catch a they catch a
[1:23:31] a Mystic light a supernatural light now
[1:23:35] the important one in the picture is that
[1:23:39] light but that light was not ashamed of
[1:23:42] the
[1:23:45] man I don't care where the critics
[1:23:48] are I don't care where the critics are
[1:23:51] that light was wasn't ashamed of that
[1:24:02] man could I take you to Bombay
[1:24:06] India and brother brandom is standing
[1:24:08] there and all of those witch doctors are
[1:24:12] are power against
[1:24:15] him you know he you know sometimes in a
[1:24:18] duel you have to come to a spot it's
[1:24:20] like a it's like a showdown
[1:24:23] you you go along for so while and and
[1:24:25] it's like a showdown all of a sudden all
[1:24:28] of the sudden something's something's
[1:24:30] beginning to
[1:24:32] happen and and here a blind man comes
[1:24:35] before him and and brother Brand's had a
[1:24:39] vision and operating by Vision he had
[1:24:43] confidence he wasn't just doing it on
[1:24:45] his
[1:24:46] own brother jimy was standing there
[1:24:49] knowing in the next few minutes what
[1:24:51] what he had saw in VIs Vision was going
[1:24:53] to take place in
[1:24:56] reality it had happened with a boy in
[1:24:59] Finland that was dead and he'd saw the
[1:25:03] vision two years ago and told them to
[1:25:06] write it down on the fly leaf of the
[1:25:07] Bible and listen when he kneeled down
[1:25:11] beside of him he said you can call me a
[1:25:13] false prophet if he's not off of the
[1:25:15] ground in a few
[1:25:18] moments oh today they want to fight it
[1:25:20] but they wern't fighting it there
[1:25:24] are you with me now and so and
[1:25:28] so there he is standing with this blind
[1:25:31] man now he could have just prayed he
[1:25:34] could have just prayed for him and it
[1:25:36] would have been well but he turns to the
[1:25:40] to those witch
[1:25:42] doctors those Idol
[1:25:45] worshippers and he says which of your
[1:25:51] gods
[1:25:52] right which of your Gods can come heal
[1:25:57] this
[1:25:59] man I'd like to say gods of the
[1:26:03] world which of your Gods can turn our
[1:26:06] bodies young
[1:26:07] again can bring our dead loved ones from
[1:26:10] the
[1:26:11] grave we got a message that we'll do
[1:26:16] it but which of your Gods can do that
[1:26:20] which of your Gods can take girls like
[1:26:22] that's sitting here tonight and make
[1:26:24] them uh like real pillars of
[1:26:28] fire young men that have been tainted by
[1:26:32] life and turn their life and make them
[1:26:35] pillars I'll tell you this God that's
[1:26:38] living amongst
[1:26:41] us he accepts a
[1:26:46] challenge why of course nobody stepped
[1:26:49] forth they knew their God couldn't do
[1:26:51] that such a thing
[1:26:53] and he turns and begins to pray for the
[1:26:56] man and in a few moments that man begins
[1:26:59] to worship
[1:27:00] God I'd like to take you to
[1:27:03] Mexico where there's a woman that's been
[1:27:06] in the in the meeting
[1:27:08] before and that morning her baby dies
[1:27:12] and she goes to the doctors and the
[1:27:14] doctor said go bury your baby it's
[1:27:17] dead but she had seen a living
[1:27:20] God she heard more than a church service
[1:27:25] but she saw a living
[1:27:27] God and in witnessing that Living
[1:27:31] God she didn't want to bury her dead
[1:27:34] baby there was something inside of her
[1:27:37] if I can get to
[1:27:40] Jesus it may be a lot of trouble but if
[1:27:43] I can get to Jesus I won't have to bury
[1:27:46] my
[1:27:47] child it had rained all day long and she
[1:27:50] had wrapped that life less baby waited
[1:27:53] till service hundreds of ushers couldn't
[1:27:57] keep her away and finally she gets to
[1:28:00] brother brandom and and she's making
[1:28:02] such a noise and brother Billy Paul says
[1:28:04] that you know she's came through all
[1:28:06] these hundreds of ushers and she won't
[1:28:08] turn back the baby's dead and he finally
[1:28:12] turns into a brother and he says won't
[1:28:14] you go
[1:28:15] pray she don't know who I
[1:28:18] am won't you go pray and he begins to
[1:28:21] make steps to go
[1:28:22] a vision breaks just a
[1:28:25] moment bring the
[1:28:27] baby he
[1:28:29] knew I'd like to say to death this
[1:28:32] morning death you couldn't hold that
[1:28:34] baby the same as you couldn't hold Jesus
[1:28:38] the same as you couldn't hold
[1:28:41] Doug we've seen a showdown in this
[1:28:48] church Hallelujah brother brandom took
[1:28:51] that little life less baby in his arms
[1:28:54] and began to pray and he said as I
[1:28:56] prayed I felt warmth coming that
[1:29:01] blanket life came back to that
[1:29:05] baby where's your D at there
[1:29:13] Satan you had our savior's body for for
[1:29:17] three
[1:29:19] days but in all your power
[1:29:23] you couldn't corrupt our Lord Jesus
[1:29:27] Christ you had him in hell you had keys
[1:29:31] you had
[1:29:32] arrows but he came to your
[1:29:35] house and when he came to your house he
[1:29:39] took your
[1:29:41] keys he defeated hell death and the
[1:29:46] grave and in spite of all your power on
[1:29:50] Resurrection morning
[1:29:52] Jesus Christ came up out of that
[1:29:56] grave now I want to remind you today
[1:29:59] that we was inside of
[1:30:02] him and you couldn't corrupt him then
[1:30:06] and if we was inside of him you couldn't
[1:30:09] corrupt us then and neither can you
[1:30:13] corrupt us
[1:30:15] now give the Lord a good hand right
[1:30:20] there
[1:30:25] we have a cloud hanging in the back of
[1:30:27] the building as you go out of the
[1:30:28] building it's illuminated
[1:30:31] there I want to remind the
[1:30:35] enemy he knows why that Cloud's
[1:30:39] there the Skeptics can say what they
[1:30:42] want to but Satan himself knows he
[1:30:46] knows there had been a lot of people go
[1:30:50] to the desert and want to find find
[1:30:52] something greater out of the book maybe
[1:30:54] to be un able to untangle the codes of
[1:30:57] the
[1:30:58] Bible but God sent the prophet
[1:31:01] there on a commission and he would be
[1:31:05] hunting Havalina
[1:31:07] Hawks and seven angels came down and
[1:31:11] revealed the the Seven
[1:31:14] Seals that would be revealed that would
[1:31:17] unlock the
[1:31:18] Mysteries and would also expose Satan
[1:31:21] himself self all the way down from the
[1:31:24] beginning of time you see the church
[1:31:27] world had on a white horse Christ
[1:31:32] riding and many of the Great teachers of
[1:31:34] the day had Christ riding on a white
[1:31:38] horse but listen when the seals were
[1:31:41] released and a cloud was formed our
[1:31:44] Prophet came back to Jeffersonville and
[1:31:47] begin to release the Seven Seals God had
[1:31:51] revealed in Simplicity the breach
[1:31:54] between the church
[1:31:56] ages and the and the the
[1:32:00] seals and I want you to understand that
[1:32:03] that releases the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:06] our names was in the
[1:32:08] book even John rejoices when he sees his
[1:32:12] name in the book Satan the reason you
[1:32:15] hate the Book of Revelations is is
[1:32:18] because it exposes your
[1:32:20] works
[1:32:23] and we would have been just another
[1:32:25] formal lifeless group of people right
[1:32:28] but the very life of Jesus Christ is in
[1:32:32] the Bride of Jesus Christ doing the
[1:32:35] works of Jesus
[1:32:38] Christ and we recognize that that enemy
[1:32:41] was riding in Paul's day the mystery of
[1:32:44] iniquity was already working in his day
[1:32:47] it is rode all the way down to this age
[1:32:50] as a pale horse rider
[1:32:52] but God always meets The
[1:32:56] Challenge whether it's a liing anointing
[1:32:58] a man anointing or an ox anointing or an
[1:33:02] eagle anointing we're anointed in a
[1:33:05] prophetic
[1:33:06] work God meets The Challenge it wasn't
[1:33:09] just to brother brandom but it's to
[1:33:13] you hallu are you catching it just for a
[1:33:16] moment you see this is more than just
[1:33:19] about brother
[1:33:20] brandom
[1:33:26] it's more than about brother
[1:33:29] Frasier it's more than about me more
[1:33:32] than about Andrew more than about our
[1:33:35] favorite preachers around the
[1:33:38] world it's about
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:42] him it's about
[1:33:45] him now you would be disappointed you
[1:33:47] drove two or three hours to this service
[1:33:50] and and you didn't didn't feel that that
[1:33:57] presence I don't care how many services
[1:34:00] I've been in since a boy that presence
[1:34:03] is always
[1:34:04] there now maybe you come in an attitude
[1:34:07] to where that you're not going to get
[1:34:08] you're not going to get nothing out of
[1:34:10] service maybe because you didn't
[1:34:12] prepare but if you properly prepare for
[1:34:15] the
[1:34:16] service and you take your position in
[1:34:20] church
[1:34:22] now there's two opposing Spirits even in
[1:34:24] church and one will try to get you
[1:34:26] critical and one will look at the watch
[1:34:28] and one one will do this and the songs
[1:34:31] wasn't right and this wasn't right my
[1:34:33] favorite singer didn't sing and he'll
[1:34:34] try to get you to think about your
[1:34:36] tractor at home or you know your grass
[1:34:38] has got to be mow or it's really cold
[1:34:40] outside I wonder if my car will start
[1:34:42] after a while don't you
[1:34:45] worry but if you can break through that
[1:34:50] Humanity if you you can break through
[1:34:52] that Humanity I don't care what the
[1:34:54] problem that you fought all week long if
[1:34:56] you can break through
[1:34:58] that and say God I've came to this spot
[1:35:02] come and meet me at my
[1:35:07] Pew come and meet me right
[1:35:10] here on
[1:35:16] brother brother
[1:35:20] sharik
[1:35:22] I heard him many years ago and I'm going
[1:35:26] to tell the story the best that I can
[1:35:28] remember brother charik from South
[1:35:31] Africa he's always had tent Ministry
[1:35:33] throughout throughout his life as a
[1:35:37] minister he said his mother and father
[1:35:40] would go to brother branham's meetings
[1:35:41] in South
[1:35:43] Africa and
[1:35:46] and they didn't know if he was a true
[1:35:49] Prophet or he wasn't a true Prophet they
[1:35:51] they just were sitting there and had a
[1:35:53] lot of questions in their mind but
[1:35:55] sister sharik which was his mother was
[1:35:58] sitting there there was a woman in a red
[1:36:00] dress sitting right beside of
[1:36:03] her and she seemed to be a little bitty
[1:36:07] woman and as the meeting would go on and
[1:36:09] it would come to the prayer line as
[1:36:11] brother brandom would many times do he
[1:36:14] would pray for the patient and then he
[1:36:15] would said now you know I'm waiting on
[1:36:17] something and then he would watch over
[1:36:18] the audience and see the pillar of fire
[1:36:20] moving and he would begin to call out
[1:36:22] people this one and that one come to
[1:36:24] their situations God's an ontime God
[1:36:27] wherever you're
[1:36:28] at and so he comes and and literally
[1:36:32] they're a long way back in the meeting
[1:36:34] and and he says no doubt your father's
[1:36:37] heard this many times sister Debby and
[1:36:40] so and so he was sitting there and it
[1:36:43] was a lady in a red dress and he
[1:36:46] said may God heal you of that bone
[1:36:50] disease and then he moves to the next
[1:36:52] patient and sister sharik listened to
[1:36:55] Bones
[1:36:58] cracking she used the term
[1:37:02] popping popping back into place popping
[1:37:06] back into place popping back into place
[1:37:09] and when that woman got undone popping
[1:37:12] she was over six foot
[1:37:18] tall Satan was you there

[1:57:53] like this but we
[1:58:00] win we
[1:58:10] win brother BR says in God of this evil
[1:58:12] age he said has God lost
[1:58:14] control or is he permitting another
[1:58:17] agency to control the two answer to this
[1:58:21] question to my opinion there's two
[1:58:24] opposing spirits in the world today at
[1:58:27] work now there can't be more than two
[1:58:30] there's only two heads one of them is
[1:58:32] the holy spirit at work and the other
[1:58:35] one is the spirit of the devil and in
[1:58:38] these last days in
[1:58:40] deception he said I base my thoughts
[1:58:43] right here on the that I will use for
[1:58:46] the rest of this text the rest of our
[1:58:48] message to Spirits one of them is God's
[1:58:51] Holy Spirit and the other one is the
[1:58:54] devil Spirit working in deception notice
[1:58:57] these next sentence the people of the
[1:59:02] Earth are now making their
[1:59:09] choice now the people of the
[1:59:12] work now Putin made some incredible
[1:59:15] statements last week of how he was going
[1:59:17] to attack us last week this week since
[1:59:22] we preached here last Sunday he made
[1:59:25] some attacks statements at how I'm going
[1:59:28] to attack the west and then he sent up
[1:59:31] nuclear warheads into this
[1:59:34] space to travel around the Earth and
[1:59:37] when he needs it he sends it where it
[1:59:39] needs to
[1:59:41] go now he can't do that without
[1:59:44] permission from
[1:59:47] God God raises up men men to fulfill his
[1:59:51] word I don't mean to scare you but Putin
[1:59:54] can't do anything without God letting
[1:59:56] him do
[1:59:59] it are you with me are you with me the
[2:00:02] pope can't do anything unless God lets
[2:00:05] him do it Israel is fighting for their
[2:00:08] boundaries I don't care what critics of
[2:00:11] uh the critics of Israel is doing I
[2:00:13] don't care the sympathizers of Palestine
[2:00:16] I don't care the sympathizer of Hamas I
[2:00:19] don't care the sympathizers of all of
[2:00:21] all the people around that I know we
