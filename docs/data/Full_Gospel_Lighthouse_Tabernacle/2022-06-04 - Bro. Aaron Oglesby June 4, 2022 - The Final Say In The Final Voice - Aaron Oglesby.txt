revelation the third chapter we'll read some they're out of revelation 3 and also out of revelation 10 and as you're turning i just want to say what an honor it is to be with you again i was i was uh talking to brother andrew earlier and just reminding him that the very first time i ever preached anywhere outside my home church was right here so this church this congregation has a special place in my heart and even far beyond that you know there's there's certain people that god puts in your life on this journey and we have we have friends we have dear friends then we have those friends that are really more than that their family and we feel that way not only about the spencer family but but about this church and this congregation you know i've always been a like a sister church to us and so y'all are family to us we love and appreciate you we're thankful for your stand for what's right thankful for your stand on the message of the hour amen so i just pray that god will come down tonight and have his way as we fellowship around his word and i pray that each one of us can be encouraged tonight in his presence amen so god bless you we're going to look now in in revelation 3 and 14. we're going to read one verse then we're going to read verse 21 as well it says and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god skipping down now to verse 21 to him that overcometh do you see yourself right there in that scripture tonight amen to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne amen if you would now turn with me over to revelation 10 7 verses that we should be very familiar with i'm going to read down through verse 11. it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen i pray that god will add his blessing to the word as you have your seats wonderful words of life prophetic words as we get into this tonight what i'd like to speak to you on for a little bit is the final say in the final voice the final say in the final voice it's very important for us as christians it's very important that we recognize the supreme authority of god in and over every situation every situation that you may face everything that you're going to come up against understand that god is in total and complete control there is only one who has the final say there is only one who has the final say and that is the lord jesus christ our opening scripture there described him as the amen the faithful and the true witness amen this is somebody that can be counted on it's somebody that you can put your hopes and dreams in it's somebody you can rest your very soul with he is the amen he's true and he's faithful prophet of god would say i looked up in the dictionary webster's according to webster's it's perfect in itself unlimited in its power primarily an ultimate and an ultimate is the amen that's all an absolute it's the unlimited empower the word absolute it's perfect in itself that's all of it that settles it an absolute it's used many times it's the last word it's the amen you hear people say absolutely that's all that's the last thing it's unlimited c that takes it from here on there's nothing else in its way it's the amen that's all that's what he is the amen see he's got the last word to say so i want to tell you tonight that no matter what's going on in your life there's one that holds it all there's one who has the final say you can look to him you can trust in his word it is the final say in your life tonight he is the amen aren't you glad tonight that he is the amen aren't you glad tonight that he has the final say my opinion of you tonight is not the final say the doctor's report tonight is not the final save what you've been going through and the things the devil has poured out on you and the things he's saying is definitely not the final say but there's one that said i have washed you i have given you the holy ghost i will give you a rapture i have gone to prepare a place that's the final say that's all that matters that's where i'm looking tonight he is the final say in our life tonight church hallelujah he is the final say the plans that the enemy has made for you and has been telling you for years and telling you you're going to fall and telling you you're not going to make it is not the final say but the i am god the one who blew the galaxies off his hands the one who created everything the one who made the very body you're in he says i'm in control of it i have the final say over it and i'm going to take care of my word he has the final say in your life he is omnipotent he is the amen that means that not only does he have the final say brother andrew he is the final say it's not just that he's in control of it that is what he is that's how we can trust it's important sometimes in our emotions and when we when we get down and we look and we say how we say why and and god how did did the devil get away with this how did he do that and we began to ponder within ourselves and and that's how though in these situations we can trust we can fully trust him when things happen that we can't understand it would be so hard to deal with things it would be so hard to trust and understand if every time our life got turned upside down or every time we lost a loved one or every time things just went totally opposite from the way we thought it should have went that we felt like it was the devil that had had the final say if we felt like oh my goodness he the devil did this that dev no that's not how it works though he had no say in it whatsoever it was not the devil that had the final say my god had the final say there was no victory for the enemy there was no victory for satan god had the final say in the situation even if you can't understand how it turned out he was in control he had the final say the enemy did not get a victory there was no victory for the enemy we can rest knowing tonight that he had the final say there was no defeat in our life god's hand was in it because the devil does not have a say in our lives listen it's not a democracy the devil don't get a vote he has no say in how this thing's going to turn out he has no say in whether or not you make it your name was written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world so the first day is the final say the first thing it said is the end of it all you're gonna make it he don't get a vote he don't get a save hallelujah oh this is a monarchy it's one king one voice he said you're gonna make it you're gonna make it hallelujah [Music] glory to god [Music] the finals say the plan of god is never defeated stormy skies rough waters dark trials they are not signs of sin in your life or god's disapproval in your life get that out of your head or that satan's gaining victory over you because things ain't going exactly right maybe you're being molded may be tested and tried but god's purpose will be fulfilled in it whatever it is what we have to learn how to do and it's difficult sometimes is to find the purpose in the trial find the purpose in the trial in recognizing that it's working together for your good now here's the reason so many of us myself included for years couldn't understand that scripture because you look at that all things work together for good and you just can't make some things be good no matter how you look at it i don't care what you say that ain't good the problem is we're basing it off of what's good for us here what's good for this what's good for my bank account what's good for my physical health what's but he ain't worried about that so much when he says it works together for your good he means your eternal good what's it going to take to get you there what's it going to take to get you eternal life and all things you go through are working together for the good of that it is working together in accordance to that plan and for your eternal good jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected end thoughts here means plans if you look it up the thoughts means i know the plans that i have for you i've already planned it out i know exactly what's going to happen yes and it may not seem good but it's working to an expected end you're going through these things but it's going to get you right here where i need you to be satan has plans we see them all through the bible peter satan has desired to sift you as wheat that's his plans but i've prayed for you he has plans and throughout the scripture we constantly see them time and time again because our god is the is the amen he's the one that has the final say so so whenever his word is spoken it will not return unto him void no matter what it has to go through no matter what a situation rises we see in the very beginning satan begins making plans that he's going to be exalted and he's going to be worshiped and he begins to make all these big grand glorious plans and even though it would seem there was some level of success he's then cast out of heaven and his plan doesn't work in heaven the way he thought so he comes down to earth and we see him in the garden doing what making plans he's making plans and he's trying to find his way back in trying to find his way back into a position of authority into your position and he wants to take that and he's working and he brings deception and he has a plan to regain power and cause man to fall and he brings a twisted version of the word understand it was still a version of the word the most dangerous things aren't just bald-faced lies they're things that have a version of the word mixed in with them and he brings a twisted version of the word and he changes one little word let me tell you something every single word of this matters every little part matters we got to get to the place where we quit looking at this as maybe not so as important as this and this doesn't matter as much as this if it's in the word it matters if the prophet of god spoke it it matters we can't just look at it well maybe that was his opinion and maybe this and maybe that listen if it's on the message if it's in the bible it matters tonight all right it's very important oh well that's a little old-fashioned and maybe that's his opinion well okay let's just entertain that for a minute maybe it was but i'll take the opinion of someone who spent so much time in the presence of the angel versus your opinion where is your vindication when has god spoke through you when has the dead been raised in your ministry but he brings deception by twisting one little part and he causes adam's bride to fall and then we know that adam fell with or not deceived but he willingly goes and the whole earth under adam falls and satan believes i've won he begins to feel like he's one and and now sin and death are going to reign in mortal bodies but right here in this moment we learn something very important we serve a determined god we serve a god who ain't going to give up on his plan he's not going to give up on this bride and no matter what the devil's telling you he is not going to give up on you he has not given up on you it doesn't matter what he has to do it doesn't matter how far you've gone our god is still fighting for you and the devil is telling you things that are absolute lies my god has the final say in your life my god has the final say in your life and he's not giving up on you he is determined that he will have victory in your life satan thinks he's one and we learn in that moment in earth the worst moment of earth history as it were right there love projects you know that's one thing that the devil can't never understand he can't never figure it out he don't understand he ruined your life he put smut over your life he put sin in your life he calls you to do things you're ashamed of things you're embarrassed of things you would never tell and he thinks i got him now oh yeah he can't have him now i've covered him up but he just can't understand l o v e it doesn't matter what he does to you you're god's child you're god's son you're god's daughter and he loves you and he'll come searching for you and he'll fight for you it don't matter where you're at tonight he says i love you i love you i died for you i'm calling you satan just can't wrap his mind around it he can't do it god says that's my child i love them hallelujah he loves you tonight [Applause] in that moment love projects and a savior is promised brother william even mentioned this in his prayer and when god says something it's an absolute brother brown says there in the garden that morning when sin was so black jehovah come in there stood his couple standing condemned there would be no more human race they had to die death on the human race give the world back to the wild beast there'd be no human race but in the darkest hour in that time when all hopes was gone grace come pouring through said i'll give you a savior a messiah oh it's a wonder how god could ever do it god's amazing grace in the garden of eden that give them the promise of a just one who could come through the woman the woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's head the guilty one and his head shall bruise her heel to show there had been an affliction to the church but he promised a triumph what provided a savior grace he goes on to say in revelation 21 3 and 4 the tabernacle of god is with man god has tabernacled him man by redeeming him by these three process now god is going to redeem the earth and the tabernacle in the earth with his subjects of the earth which he brought forth from the earth and through sin it fell but he had to let it go on but now he sent jesus to redeem that fallen earth which we are a part of there not one hair of your head will perish jesus said so he said i'll raise it up again at the last day see why you're part of the earth the germ of god the life of god was designed in the womb of a woman which was the earth all right and then the life of god came in so he was the beginning of the creation of god see and then that blood of god that was there by that germ when it was shed at calvary dropped back upon the earth what for to redeem the earth now it's been justified it's been sanctified called and claimed and now is to receive its baptism of fire and be cleansed for jesus and his bride when satan fell he not only wanted to destroy you he wanted to destroy every part of god's creation he wanted a destruction of the earth but god was so determined he said i'm even going to redeem the dust that i've called my people out of i'm going to redeem every last part of it hallelujah we got to get it out of our minds tonight that satan has a saying god is in absolute control of everything his word is absolute and he is limitless in his power he is limitless now this is important to know because satan does have power satan has power but his power is a limited power whereas the power of our god is limitless what limits the power of the devil what limits him you can limit the power of the devil by the power of the holy ghost in your life by taking the word upon your lips and putting the devil in his place by not giving ear to the word that he speaks to you by not putting that word that he speaks on your lips quit giving a voice to the devil oh he can talk in your ear all yours but don't repeat anything he says don't give him a voice don't speak his word i got a word you can speak if you've got something you need to say tonight by his strengths i'm healed how to lead to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me and my throne oh the promise is unto them and unto their children unto as many as the lord our god shall call there's something to repeat there's something to put on your lips you can limit the power of the enemy he only has whatever power you relinquish to him whatever you give to him his only voice is when you speak what he tells you he has the power to whip up a storm you have the power to say peace be still when god says stop he has to stop when he's told that's far enough he can't take another step look it's time you tell him tonight it's time you let him know tonight this time you take the word of god upon your lips you say devil you ain't taking another step in my life you ain't taking another step in my marriage you ain't taking another step in my home you can't have my health you can't have my children you can't have my praise you have taken it back tonight you've gone as far as you're gonna go in my life i'm gonna walk with god i'm gonna overcome i'm taking another step tonight oh you've gone far enough you're not going to tear up the church you're not going to come in and go stride you're not going to come in and cause division amongst the brothers you've gone far enough furthermore i will not be a tool to cause vision i will not be a tool to cause strife no but i will be one that comes in unity of the holy ghost to press towards the mark of the high calling hallelujah i will be used by the holy ghost is who i will be used by it's time some of us say peace be still you've gone far enough you will not rob my joy you will not rob my peace you're not look some of us let him have our praise way too long he deserves your praise matter of fact he deserves more praise than you could ever give him so he sure at least deserves that much too many of us oh when i get to victory you ain't never seen a dance like that when i get the victory i'm gonna shout all over the place the thing is sometimes we forget our victory's on the other side of the praise sometimes the dance is on the other side of the red sea i'm just gonna walk on out i'm gonna go ahead and give him some praise i'm gonna go ahead and shout i'm gonna go ahead and bless his name there you go take your praise back take your joy back take your shout back we have a right to praise him we have a right to rejoice hallelujah take your praise back tonight god's gonna get my praise hallelujah [Applause] we got too many people want to sit down until their favorite song comes on or their favorite singer scenes are too worried about the sound ain't right tonight or the air is too cold why are we here why are we here oh we're here to worship we're here to praise we're here to lift up the name above all names he deserves it let me tell you what if you'll ever enter in enough you won't notice that you won't notice those around you you won't worry if they're doing you won't care who's on key off key wherever they are i'm here to praise the lovely name of jesus hallelujah oh hey we here we see so much because we ain't doing nothing we recognize everything that's going on because we're busy doing nothing oh but then but then all of a sudden oh i like that song no i'm just going to tell you i said it at home i said some of y'all if people say where do you worship at you couldn't tell them even like tabernacle you'd be lying that might be where you go to church but i don't know where you worship oh i know i'm preaching in a place that knows how to worship i know i know i'm just saying hey don't be ashamed of your worship don't be ashamed of worship every now and then you just need to let the devil know i'm still here you told me i wasn't gonna make it you told me i was gonna fall you told me i wasn't gonna overcome devil i'm still here i'm still standing i'm still fighting i'm going all the way i can't stop i won't stop there's something on the inside of me it won't let me stop it won't let me turn around hallelujah still here still fighting glory hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] i know circumstances of life is hard i know this is a god that defies circumstances he's a god that defies symptoms you may be in a bad spot tonight you may have had a rough patch well i've been there man that's the things i don't like it when people try to tell y'all just grab your bootstraps boy it's gonna be okay life is hard your trials are real we got a real adversary it's a real battle [Music] it's war it ain't no joke it ain't no joke but we serve the mighty conqueror whose attributes he has passed down to you which makes you a mighty conqueror so in this battle you're in let me tell you once again you're going to win it you're going to overcome it we will see miracles we will see giants fall we will walk on water whatever your situation is in just look back to him get your eyes off the wind get your eyes off the waves and walk towards jesus tonight because he is the final say look i don't care how long you've been in that sick condition i don't care how long you've been holding on to that bitterness how long you been holding on to that unforgiveness letting things swell up and fester up on the inside of you you can let it go tonight you can walk past it tonight you can overcome those things tonight so my god shows up and things change it don't matter how long you've been in that lost situation it didn't matter if lazarus had been dead four days he didn't say i wish i'd have been here he didn't say if i'd have been here things would have been different he said where'd you laying where'd you lay him at tonight where'd you lay your hopes where'd you lay your dreams where'd you lay your piece at tonight where'd you lay it at where'd you lay the ones you've given up on where'd you lay your children at tonight wear the hat because he's still rolling stones away tonight he'll show up in your situation where'd you lay it at tonight oh he's here tonight to do the work he's here tonight to meet your need where have you laid all those things where's your joy buried at look i know man life's real things come in your childhood people did you wrong in church you got scars from maybe things you don't even want to talk about that's real stuff man people scarred you people did you wrong and so in the course of all that you begin to believe the lie that says you ain't very much you ain't worth very much you ain't gonna make it you ain't worth nothing then those lies become your grave clothes and you get wrapped all up in those lies and wrapped up in those complexes let me tell you what sometimes if we hold on to the truth the way we hold onto a complex we'd be all right we'd be some free people tonight but we let complexes ruin our lives and ruin our families and create cycles and we view everything through a complex we view what the preacher says through a complex we view what our neighbor says through a complex and we can't rightly divide nothing anymore because you're looking at the world through a lie and these things become grave clothes and then you get put in the grave and the enemy rolls a stone over the entrance of everything god intended you to be i'm saying tonight roll the stone away i say roll the stone away let's push the stone away hey let me tell you something jesus didn't even roll the stone away he had some sisters go roll the stone away some of us need to come with the attitude that tonight it may not be me wrapped up in great clothes but i'm going to push some stones away i'm gonna put my shoulder in there i'm gonna worship i'm gonna praise i'm gonna create an atmosphere where people can be set free where the lost can be loose loose them and set them free tonight [Applause] push the stone away glory the finals say yeah i say the devil's had enough say in your life tonight we've let him have enough god had promised a redeemer he had promised a savior and here he was standing there at the tomb of lazarus some 4 000 years later the manifestation of every old testament prophecy standing there in the flesh here he was god was skin on him doing the works of god but in humanity the second adam he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast he does it and it is done forever none can take from what he says or add to it so let it be so let it be aren't you glad that you serve that kind of god you can know exactly where you are with him at any time and all the time he is the amen god and won't change these things saith the amen i like that it means that whatever he said is final it means that whatever he said to the first age and to the second and to all the ages about his own true church and about the false vine is exactly right and it won't change it means that what he started out with in genesis he will finish in revelation he has to for he is the amen so let it be we saw right there that he began to plan for redemption there in genesis and then now through time every story and every type every life lived is building towards the manifestation of a redeemer prophecies of his coming types and shadows looking forward a spoken word son of god born of a virgin one who would restore one who would heal the sick one who would wipe away the curse who could make the blind see in the death here and here he stands standing right there in their midst the full manifestation of all the word of all of it doing exactly what the word said he would do and the entire time from genesis all the way down to this moment satan trying to stop it at every turn watching trying to figure out wait this one here and that one there and so he'll have this one kill this one and well he must have missed something because it's still moving on here and then he goes here and he tries to stop it but god's raising up something over here and he's always one step ahead because see our god is the final say he's the amen he knows the beginning from the end but satan has to react to what he sees going on he has to react to it so he's got you down and he feels like he's got you snuffed out and all of a sudden one sunday morning you wake up and you're going to church and he's going wait what's going on here we got to put a stop to this here because i thought i had him here but something moved here in his bedroom during the night and all of a sudden before he knows that you're down at the altar weeping your way to calvary he tried to stop it he tried to snuff it out he tried to get this when he tried to bring complexes and he tried to bring revival and death and sin and curse but somebody is going to be a cycle breaker and before he knew it there you were breaking the cycles of your family of your daddy of your granddaddy overcoming because he didn't see it coming he thought for sure he had you covered up and you can see it all down through the old testament no matter what he tried always trying to stop what god's doing no matter what he did and the thing is no matter what he did he never realized that but he was always playing right into the hand of god amen the whole time you could see that with with the jews and nazi germany the whole time putting them back in their homeland you see it at calvary he would have never let that blood strike the earth he would have never let him have those stripes if he knew you'd have been healed from him he'd never let him shed that blood if he'd known it was gonna wash you from the sin's curse he'd never let it happen especially knowing that once he died and rose again he was gonna send back the holy ghost and instead of one jesus there's gonna be thousands of them he had to deal with they was going to be all over the place and every time he turned around there's one there's one there's some in virginia there's some in louisiana there's some in tennessee everywhere i go there's jesus jesus jesus how do you know it's jesus because he's doing the same things he did on the shores of galilee every time he shows up i'm cast out everywhere he shows up the sick are healed the death here in the blonde sea it's jesus he would have never let it happen but the plan of god cannot be stopped because his plan is the final saying and so many times am i going to make it that the devil told me what the devil's saying oh he's in my hair and i'm not gonna your name is already written down before the foundation of the world listen he can do what he wants to do he can't stop it he ain't got enough he ain't got enough he's released 200 million million whatever number that is demons from the river euphrates and it ain't enough he can't stop you he can't stop your family he can't stop this bride i'm telling you you will make it you've already made it you are the spoken word bride of jesus christ standing on your feet think about that this message smoke you into existence you were here because a message went forth and it created what i'm looking at tonight a people restored back to the original with the original power just like in the book of acts he can no more stop you than he stopped jesus he couldn't stop the true church born in the upper room he tried to stomp it out with persecutions tried to cover it up with false doctrines tried to make the church cold and formal say oh just believe and you got it tried to stomp out the real fire and what it is he began to eat the leaves off the tree but the amen had already said i will restore before he ever took one leaf off the tree the amen said i'm going to restore the tree because he's always ahead he always has the final say the amen had already spoke behold i sent unto you elijah the prophet out comes william brown out goes a message and out from that message comes you standing here in the last day it's incredible when you begin to look through the scripture and you can see and you see these people and and many times it's stories and it's oh i see that one and they live this life and i see now how that event ties into this event because there was a prophecy that said that and then i see this and all of a sudden you're reading along and you go that's me that's me what was all this about it was about me it was about you and you and you and you and you it was all about me it was all about a bride it was all about one that would match him on the earth once again in this final day i'm in there i'm in the word which means i'm in the plan which means i can't be stopped which means everything he promised about me will come to pass i will not be stopped and i will not be hindered but what started in genesis is still marching right on the full plan of redemption the plan that i will have a bride without spot or wrinkle i will have it yeah and the thing is i didn't say it i say it all the time but i mean it i look at myself and i look at my life and i go i alone would mess that scripture up i got plenty of spots i got plenty of wrinkles but there's blood and there's a plan and there's a word spoken that i don't have to bring that word to pass he does so i can just trust and say that's the final say he's the one that said it it has to come to pass one thing after another pointing that we have a determined god determined that i will have a bride that will not fall and yet an enemy determined i'm going to stop this i'm going to stop this confident that just like in the garden he can make this bride fall so confident and yet my god was so confident that he said i go to prepare a place for you you think he's worried about whether or not you're going to show up he's already went to prepare a place he's already went to prepare a place for you he's so confident that you're coming that his plan is going to work that you were going to reach full manifestation of everything he thought of you before the foundation of the world brother brown says now for nearly 2 000 years god has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck adam to get a masterpiece off of him part of a rib a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect masterpiece that he struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the new testament that's all he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled now see the the new and old as husband and wife see and it taken the old to foreshadow the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece in the making well i don't feel like a masterpiece well neither do i but don't worry about what you feel like tonight the finals say the amen the the the faithful witness has said you're gonna overcome you're gonna fulfill everything there so it doesn't matter what you feel like or what the enemy's saying tonight trust in the amen god tonight [Music] it's already 8 20. help me lord early in the ephesian age paul was his warning for i'm jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste version to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled he through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ so way back there in the early church the false vine got to intertwine itself around the true vine and we found the deeds of the nicolaitans and they got the people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship no longer resembled the early days after pentecost and so satan attacks just like he did eve and he just changes one little thing here and one little thing there and he tries to get people to to move out from behind the protection of the word it seems so innocent at first but what it is is an opportunity for the wolves to come in an opportunity and soon that the deeds of these people become the doctrines and before long the church has lost their first love and cold formal worship begins to move into the services and experience is now traded for head knowledge and the problem with trading that other than the fact that it's unscriptural that's enough of a problem but the problem with it is when it's based off a head knowledge you begin to accept things that you wouldn't have originally accepted because there's no leadership of the holy ghost in your life so if somebody can make it sound pretty and make it sound right and sound reasonable you'll begin to drift in that direction and so what happens is the church begins to rely on men to provide them with what they need instead of the holy spirit and you've created a hierarchy of nicolaitanism men become leaders instead of the holy ghost and now the divide between the truth and what you are being fed on begins to grow more and more apart that's why you find so many that hate moving of the spirit because with the moving of the spirit they'll be set free from that spirit of bondage that they're sitting under so behind the guise of i want to protect my people they keep them from meetings where there's the holy ghost or they keep them from hearing other ministers and you don't need to listen to this and you don't need to listen to that and the whole time what it is is unlike paul they don't desire to espouse the people to christ they desire to espouse those people to themselves and so they build walls and they build kingdoms until it no longer even resembles what god started in the upper room it no longer resembles the truth that was revealed in this day you go and there's there's no message there and so once again back to the ephesian age as this began to happen and they began to be drawn away from the original just like in the garden satan thinks i made her fall i got her again she's fallen again she stepped out from behind the protection of the word she began to debate and satan thinks this one is falling just like eve but let me remind you and i'm going to keep reminding you that amen had already said i'm going to have a bride that amen had already said i'm going to restore but it looks like she's fallen too and we we've passed down through the fourth age and now when it seems so dark and there isn't anything left it seems like from the original tree that was planted there on the day of pentecost and yet that tree has been eaten down and the caterpillar and the locust has eaten it down to nothing but there's a scripture laying there that says i will restore i will restore brother brown says but what he was god's perfect prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory going to say something directly if he's the bridegroom tree do you believe it from the garden of eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bride tree she has got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in the female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride the works that i do shall you do also is that right and he begins to restore the broad tree back to where listen we look around all the time and say the world's evil the world's evil the tree of knowledge of good and evil has reached its height and brother branham says we fail all the time to see how powerful the church is getting the world is evil the world is evil but look at the church on this side if that tree has reached its height and it's reached full maturity there must be a people on earth who is reaching the height of their power that is reaching full maturity the bride tree restored once again in this day and luther breaks away from the false line and preaches justification and wesley breaks away preaches sanctification the tree being restored and yet there's still claims on the tree satan still had claims over the church there were still false baptisms there were still teachings of false godheads the tree wasn't exactly producing the fruits that the groom tree had produced this was not yet bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh although there were glimpses of it this was not the ministry of christ being repeated so what must this tree produce in this day what must the final say in the final voice look like in this day he said there's got to come in this last day a restoration of the church a bride tree that was eat down back yonder by canker worms and palmer worms all kinds of insects that eat all the brotherly love and the fruits away from it there's got to come a church again whose barriers will be broken the holy ghost will have the right of way among the people when you do you'll see the same signs and wonders that happened back there in them days amen thus what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close he said there is no other pattern there is no other pattern that is what we are to pattern after so so go ahead and call me pentecostal i will wear that like a badge of honor because brother branham says that's the pattern that's who we're supposed to match just like the first stage the first church the upper room that's what i'm patterning after because that's what we're supposed to pattern after and so down through the ages there were glimpses but there had to be more than the azusa street revival and a restoration of the gifts make no mistake about it it was a restoration and it was a move of god was it the original grain again no we know that we know that it was it was the life moving through but also when we point back to that move and act as if it was nothing and act as if it's unneeded i'm a simple person so i look at it and i tend to believe that if god thought it needed to be restored then he must have thought we needed it otherwise why restore it why were those things put back in the church but brother tim has a saying that he says that he got from somebody it's not original to him and he says so but he says god started the church the way he wanted it and now he wants the church the way he started it he started the church the way he wanted it and now he wants the church the way he started it and so god decides that it's important that i restore these he goes through a lot of trouble to restore these and i feel like that's very important that we don't just willingly hand over back to the devil something that god thought you needed something that god felt needed to be in the church something that he thought needs to be restored and we go i don't need that anymore god thought you did god thought you needed it he felt like he needed we needed the supernatural working in the church so he restores this and once again there's fruits of the spirit and the trees beginning to take shape but there must come something else something to turn us turn us to what and we're getting there brother brown says but what i said was that because of the unchanging god with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect act of god and then judge by that standard that is how it's done the true church will always try to be like the original that pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one and just like in every other instance the amen had already spoken laying right there in the scripture was malachi 4 all along already ahead of anything that the devil can do already laying there behold i send to you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he will turn the hearts back to the faith of the fathers turned back to something turned back to the original and then that message comes forth in power with a restored word with the restored position who are we tonight church you are the restored bride of jesus christ restored back to where you were supposed to be in the beginning restored back with full authority restored back with the ability to speak the word and put the word on your lips you are the restored manifestation of the spoken word of god sitting here in elkton virginia tonight that's something worth shouting about that's something worth praising the lord about that he wasn't gonna let the devil win but he had the final say he had already spoken and because of that here we are victorious overcomers he was determined i will have a bride and here we are we're standing on our feet we're overcoming the enemy we're not some weakling we're not some layout of sin but we're on fire we love the lord we're pressing the battle we're overcoming that's who you are that's who you are [Applause] hallelujah thank you jesus what is it a restored word brought restored power called forth a restored bride a restored bride he says and now remember you christians were his thoughts before there was a world you are the manifestation of his thinking [Music] and what was it that he did when he was here on earth he went about tearing down satan's kingdom he went about overcoming he showed that the grave didn't have victory he showed that that sickness didn't have to be feared and just as the groom did those things when he was walking on the earth now there is a bride doing those things there is a bride look you say nothing can stand before jesus i say nothing can stand before you nothing can stand before you when you walk in faith nothing's going to overcome you because not only did he have and he is the final say you are the final say he said you are the final voice to the final age you get to speak last you get to say the final words to this age i say devil get out of my way devil you can't hold me here devil you can't have my children you can't have my family why what gives you the authority to say that i've been restored back to the original they weren't afraid of sickness they said silver and gold have i none but what i got i'm gonna give you something tonight in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk i don't got a lot to give you but i can tell you tonight you've been restored back to authority to power and you can speak the word tonight you're the final voice you have the final say it's in your lips it's in your life it's for you to speak tonight hallelujah it's been placed back in you tonight [Applause] i'm gonna try to start bringing this down satan thought that the church was defeated once again have won false doctrines false baptisms but the amen had already spoken he had a message prepared that was that would produce the people in this last day the message was the final say on all the mysteries the seals water baptism godhead no eternal hell hell all the loose ends wrapped up listen luther couldn't have the final say there were things wrong wesley couldn't have the final say there were still claims on wesley pentecost couldn't have the final say there was too many claims on them but in this day in this day every claim was stripped away the seals were torn off everything was brought back in order according to the word the seals everything every claim brother brandon would say that every claim he ever had was stripped that day on calvary so even if you go back there to the beginning there was no claim on your life it was man that had allowed those claims to come back in it was accepting the doctrines of man and false teachings that put those claims back on the church but in this day he came in the evening time it shall be light i'm so thankful for the evening light today he came and stripped it all off and he restored you back to where you are on speaking terms you have authority you have power that's where you stand at tonight it wasn't until this day that the final say could even be spoken it wasn't until this day that one could say you are the final voice that could've never been said before you you i feel like so many of us expect fulfillment and so we look for fulfillment but the problem is we're not ready to be the fulfillment we're looking oh it's when's it gonna be fulfilled when you get up and fulfill it when you realize it's me that's gonna do it i'm the overcomer of this age i'm the one the promise was sent to behold i send unto you elijah the prophet it's yours it's your victory [Music] you say whether aaron seals is open the word is restored that's why we don't need all this emotion and stuff listen i'm not sure what it is that excites you but the opening of the word and the fact that it's all been restored is exactly why i'm excited that's exactly what's bringing the emotion that's exactly well that's why david danced that's why john said all heaven and earth heard me shouting that's why he's going to get my praise it's because the word has been restored listen it's a false accusation when you say well that's just azusa street pentecost you can't lay that claim on us because we're not word rejecters we're not word rejecters we've accepted the opening of the word we see our names on the last book of life that's why i'm excited that's why i can praise that's why i can worship i saw my name when the word was open that's me that's me i'm gonna make it i can't be stopped i can't be defeated the words open and i'm in there i saw my name that's why i'm excited tonight church hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus he's got to realize you are his hands you are his feet you are to be his boys you are to perform the works oh not me brother i've had a couple bad weeks i messed up i lost my temper i said something to my kids [Applause] i'm gonna go ahead and tell you there's forgiveness for that one guarantee yeah thank you lord not me i hadn't i've just been struggling i've been having the hardest time guys how many times you got to hear that this is a fight and that this is a war you know what happens in fights brother andrew you ever been in a fight i'll leave you alone you know what happens in a fight even if you are the baddest man you get hit you get punched you get wounded and some people's like the devil hit me i must not be a christian he hit you because you're in the ring he hit you because you're fighting for the right he hit you because you're standing there saying i ain't gonna be moved he hit you quit griping about it and hit back swing back throw something back answer the bell tonight these are the championship rounds we're at the very end it's round number 12 and somebody's still standing devil i'm here once again i'm here maybe i got tired maybe i had to go to my corner for a minute but i heard the bell ding ding ding i'm answering the bail i'm back in it i'm coming back for more this is the final push finish the fight finish the race it's going home time it's the championship rounds hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i'm trying there is a bride here there is a spoken word bride and there's many that's claiming they are that bride it ain't for me to say whether you are ain't but what i can do is look at the vision i can look at the word i can see what the bride's supposed to be and then i might go hmm i'm just saying i mean tell you something there ain't no honesty like self-honesty when's the last time you was honest with yourself when's the last time you dug real deep about those things that's been hindering you real deep you saying i ain't but no i ain't saying that i'm saying bride deal with things that when they see them people with the holy ghost when they get convicted they don't blame other people they don't get mad at everybody else for their shortcomings they're willing to look at themselves and go i need to deal with this i need to deal with this but you get in a lukewarm condition real quick and let something go against you it's everybody's fault it's everybody's fault but yours i don't know i'm gonna move on how's the bride gonna conduct herself make sure we line up with that word listen the visions already happen you can't change the vision you gotta line up to the vision visions already happen we gotta step in line with that vision you can't be a part of that group that is the final voice to the final age and not be matching it word for word you can't be speaking things contrary to the word and be part of that final voice if it does something different from the groom brother brown would say it isn't the bride if your attitude is it's us for no more you ain't the final voice if your attitude is to put others out because they don't agree with you you're not the final voice matter of fact brother brannon would say something pretty harsh he said now isn't that just like the nicolaitans we have with us today they curse everyone that won't go their way when all you know is condemning others it just shows that you've never experienced the grace of god for yourself there's no you don't know what grace is because you've never experienced it so you want to point at everybody else's shortcomings and failures listen this is a message of grace that's what this mess this message came crying grace grace and we throwing stones at everybody and try listen noah's message was a message of grace we get things so twisted it's a message of judgment it's this no no no it warns you of the judgment that's coming and so therefore it's grace it's saying you don't got to go through that you don't got to be a part of that and here's how you avoid it get in the ark get in the boat run to jesus the door is open tonight get on board run to it you can be safe your family can be saved the door's still open get on board that's the message that's the message it's grace to you tonight it's grace to you tonight [Applause] if you're preaching mercy is over you're not the final voice if you're preaching division you're not the final voice the final voice is getting as many people in the art as they possibly can you know the final voice to the jewish dispensation was jesus and in that moment the final voice being crucified said father forgive them you trying to send everybody to hell and say they ain't going the rapture you ain't part of the final voice if your life is speaking judgment upon your brother pointing out their flaws you know some people really really hate and i don't understand this to see the success of others have you ever had those conversations maybe you hadn't i know i saw a lot of y'all come in with your halos but have you ever had those conversations where people are like oh yeah you know he's a good brother but i mean you know they just don't really know him like i do and they hate to see somebody be successful and hate to see others admire and say man that's a good brother i mean they're all right but i mean we get a minute i got i can tell you some stuff and nothing just yeah oh it's nothing bad just a few things you want to tear down other people's reputation and crucify them you are not the final voice you're not but if your life is crying lord forgive them bring them in jesus save from jesus lord i love that brother i want to see him saved i want to see him filled with the holy ghost and lord if it's not him per adventure it's me lord save me lord help me help me be honest with myself so much here i've run out of time the final voice the voice of the groom expressed through the bride he says this stump's growed from wesley from luther to wesley to pentecost and now is honing out those pentecostals and those that got the baptism of the holy ghost and shall come someday the headstone jesus christ in these last days and we'll have to have a ministry just exactly like his his whole spirit as it gets closer closer closer closer the negative becomes so positive that after a while the negative and the positive blends together church and christ to make one for where flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen do you believe it it shall be light in the evening time we're here today he said i've been to the pyramids in egypt and them stones are laid in there so perfect you can take razor blade and hardly go between them they fit perfectly how they built it they don't know how and the sphinx and so forth but look right here where that headstone's supposed to fit it's honed if they ever could find the headstone it would fit so perfectly snug it would bind the whole thing together that's the bride of jesus christ when the headstone comes there'll be a church here on earth to receive it it'll have a ministry just exactly like his it'll just go right up in there bringing up the feet luther and all the rest of them for
