[42:56] Lord Jesus to come and break the bread
[42:58] of life just now let me get out of the
[43:01] way so that you can do a good job in
[43:03] this place in Jesus name we pray amen
[43:08] amen if you have your Bibles this
[43:09] evening would like to look over in the
[43:11] Old Testament 1st Samuel chapter 8 verse
[43:17] one 1st Samuel chapter 8 verse one and
[43:20] then John chapter 18
[43:45] Hallelujah 1 Samuel chapter 8 verse
[43:49] 1 and it came to pass when Samuel was
[43:52] old that he made his sons judges over
[43:55] Israel now the name of his firstborn was
[43:59] Joel and the name of his second
[44:01] abah they were judges in
[44:04] beerseba and his sons walked not in his
[44:07] ways but turned aside after lucer and
[44:10] took bribes and perverted judgment then
[44:13] all the Elders of Israel gathered
[44:16] themselves together and came to Samuel
[44:18] unto
[44:19] Rama and said unto him behold Thou Art
[44:22] old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways
[44:26] now make us a king to judge us like all
[44:30] the nations but the thing displeased
[44:34] Samuel when they said give us a king to
[44:37] judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord
[44:41] and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken
[44:44] unto the voice of the people and all
[44:47] that they say unto thee for they have
[44:50] not rejected thee but they have rejected
[44:53] me that I should not Reign Over them
[44:57] John chapter 18 and verse
[45:08] 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment
[45:11] Hall again and called Jesus and said
[45:15] unto him art thou the king of the Jews
[45:20] Jesus answered him sayest thou this
[45:23] thing of thyself or did others tell it
[45:27] thee of me pilate answered am I a Jew
[45:31] thine own nation and the chief priests
[45:34] have delivered thee unto me what hast
[45:37] thou done and Jesus answered my kingdom
[45:41] is not of this world if my kingdom were
[45:44] of this world then would my servants
[45:46] fight that I should not be delivered to
[45:48] the Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[45:52] hence and pilate
[45:54] said pilate therefore said unto him art
[45:57] thou a king then Jesus answered thou
[46:01] sayest that I am a king to this end was
[46:04] I born and for this cause came I into
[46:08] the world that I should bear witness
[46:10] unto the truth everyone that is of Truth
[46:14] heareth my voice may God bless his word
[46:18] you may be seated
[46:20] tonight in the presence of the Lord and
[46:22] by the help of the Lord tonight I would
[46:24] like to I would like to speak to you on
[46:26] a thought on the demand for a king the
[46:30] demand for a king and we we realize and
[46:34] we see that the Bible teaches us and
[46:36] we're this a very familiar scripture
[46:38] that even the prophet would preach a
[46:40] text from this that the Bible said in
[46:42] Proverbs 3 and 5 trust in the Lord with
[46:45] all thine heart and lean not unto thine
[46:47] own understanding and in all thy ways
[46:50] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[46:54] paths and we'd like to just take a
[46:56] little thought and maybe just build
[46:58] build a little thought here tonight to
[46:59] lay some ground for some future thoughts
[47:01] that the Lord has dealt with us on on
[47:04] this thought on the demand for the king
[47:06] and we realize that when people demand
[47:09] Earthly Solutions without trusting God
[47:12] that they often miss God's perfect will
[47:15] and we find that throughout all
[47:17] throughout the Old Testament you see it
[47:19] you see it predominately when men begin
[47:22] to trust in their own leadership and
[47:24] when they begin to trust in their own
[47:26] integrity that you would begin to see
[47:28] people fall and you would begin to see
[47:30] people you would begin to see people
[47:32] that would lean upon them and you'll
[47:33] watch when people begin to lean on their
[47:36] own understanding that men will begin to
[47:38] adopt the ideas of other religions
[47:41] because they find that their religion
[47:43] has no power in it but what really
[47:45] happened is they got away of the truth
[47:47] of the hour and you find that when you
[47:50] study out the Book of Judges and just to
[47:52] go back and maybe maybe just lay some of
[47:54] these things in here you'll find that
[47:56] you you find a shift of power from the
[47:58] Book of Judges all the way to 1st Samuel
[48:01] chapter 8 you'll watch that that Samuel
[48:04] was one that Samuel was one of the
[48:06] rulers or one of the judges over over
[48:08] Israel but you'll find that there is a
[48:10] shift of power that that men were you
[48:13] you'll see it that men were leaning on
[48:15] the judges they were leaning on these
[48:17] rulers that were over top of Israel and
[48:20] even under Divine leadership of prophets
[48:22] they were they were leaning on that and
[48:24] then you begin to watch the transition
[48:26] from from the the judges then you begin
[48:28] to watch it as it transitions over into
[48:31] the leadership of of monarchy where a
[48:34] king would rule over them and just to
[48:36] gather the state that Israel was in here
[48:39] that you would begin to see all the way
[48:41] from the Book of Judges there they come
[48:43] in and they they don't kick out there a
[48:45] lot there's a few of them that do not
[48:47] kick out the inhabitants of the land and
[48:49] they begin to adopt in and they begin to
[48:51] worship false gods and bring in idol
[48:54] worship and different things and just to
[48:56] see where where Israel was in that time
[48:59] they were experiencing a very turbulent
[49:02] time here and you it's very
[49:04] characterized as we look in the church
[49:06] ages you'll see it that it's a repeated
[49:08] cycle of sin and death and Revival of
[49:11] fire of Oppression and and repentance
[49:15] and then deliverance and and back and
[49:17] forth you constantly watch those Cycles
[49:19] as they're repeated and you can watch
[49:21] the periods as as it's highlighted
[49:24] through the Book of Judges and you can
[49:26] see is will struggle there as they're
[49:28] struggling there to remain faithful to
[49:30] God because they have adopted all of
[49:32] these ideas of worshiping of idols and
[49:35] and idol worship but right in the midst
[49:37] of the judges they are when they begin
[49:40] to adopt they begin to adopt these
[49:42] Canaanite was Canaanite practices and
[49:45] cycles of apostasy as they would come in
[49:48] the the Book of Judges is summed up in
[49:50] this that men would do it's said in
[49:53] judges
[49:54] 21-25 that men would do what was right
[49:57] in their own eyes and you watch as as
[50:00] the church Ages was roll out you watch
[50:02] throughout the seven Church ages without
[50:04] the leadership of the Holy Ghost you
[50:06] will watch as men begin to do as their
[50:08] own minds sought to do and they they
[50:11] thought they would do it their own way
[50:12] but they were lacking a very powerful
[50:15] leader which was the person of Jesus
[50:17] Christ himself but you watch right in
[50:20] the midst of right in the midst of the
[50:22] judges right in the midst of the seven
[50:24] Church ages right between judges and
[50:27] Samuel there is a beautiful book that is
[50:29] placed right smack in the middle of it
[50:31] it's the Book of Ruth and you watch how
[50:34] how the children of Israel they were
[50:36] they were Jewish in their descent in
[50:38] their lineage and they were called the
[50:39] people of almighty God and here's a
[50:41] woman that that is Gentile in her
[50:43] descent she's a moabitas she knows what
[50:46] it's like to worship false gods she
[50:48] knows what it's like to worship idols
[50:50] but here's this woman she remains
[50:53] faithful to God and you study out the
[50:55] Book of Ruth you will see Ruth as she's
[50:58] making her decision you will see Ruth in
[51:00] her deciding and her and her serving
[51:03] then you will see Ruth resting and then
[51:06] you'll see Ruth rewarded it's it's a
[51:08] powerful thing when you studyed out that
[51:10] all the way from Men's Leadership right
[51:13] there God smacks a bride right in the
[51:15] middle of it and it shows that there is
[51:18] a coming King that is a people that are
[51:21] set up they are set up for kingship
[51:26] because God has going to have somebody
[51:29] that is going to prepare away so that he
[51:32] could have a lineage by the name of
[51:34] David a davidic lineage because he had
[51:36] to have somebody that was going to be
[51:38] faithful to God even when they seemed
[51:41] like nobody else was being faithful God
[51:43] had a woman when the church world wasn't
[51:46] faithful to God when the denominations
[51:49] wasn't faithful to God when the when the
[51:51] Bishops wasn't faithful to God there was
[51:54] a little bitty old woman she may only
[51:56] had a storefront church but when she was
[51:59] that kind of a woman that had the kind
[52:01] of relationship though she'd never seen
[52:04] God though she never felt God she hadn't
[52:07] even taken of the
[52:09] Mana but there was something on the
[52:11] inside of this little woman that was
[52:14] calling for her I would call it
[52:16] predestination that was leading her to
[52:19] the position that she was supposed to
[52:21] stand
[52:24] in and then you see be a very powerful
[52:28] woman stepping into the
[52:31] scriptures she may not seem powerful but
[52:34] she's very
[52:36] powerful this woman is without
[52:40] child she's she's not able to have she's
[52:43] not able to bring forth
[52:47] children and men are mocking
[52:49] her because she's not able to bring
[52:52] forth a child
[52:58] the people that are closest to her are
[53:00] mocking her because she cannot
[53:03] produce so Hannah begins to pray and
[53:07] Hannah begins to worship and she goes up
[53:11] before the priest and she gets so under
[53:14] the atmosphere of prayer that Hannah
[53:17] begins to act like a drunk woman she so
[53:20] drunk under the influence of this prayer
[53:23] that Hannah is moved by the Holy Ghost
[53:27] that the priest sees her and thinks and
[53:30] thinks that she's so drunk but she was
[53:32] not drunk because she was stammering on
[53:35] strong wine but her prayer had become so
[53:38] prolific to her that she could only
[53:41] stammer she could only sit there under
[53:43] the influence of the Holy Ghost you say
[53:47] what would make Hannah pray that kind of
[53:49] a prayer to move her into that kind of
[53:53] position because if Hannah does not pray
[53:56] then a Samuel is not
[53:59] produced so Hannah had to get in this
[54:02] kind of a condition where she couldn't
[54:04] have a
[54:07] child so that she could set up a
[54:10] prophetic world that would transition
[54:13] the Israelites from judges to a true
[54:17] davidic
[54:19] kingship and you wonder why you're in
[54:23] the condition that you are it's because
[54:25] God is wanting you to
[54:28] pray because he is going to be
[54:34] king let me just go ahead and say that
[54:37] God is going to be king over your
[54:39] finances God is going to be king over
[54:42] your prayer life he is going to be king
[54:44] over every sin he will be king over
[54:47] every doubt he will be king over every
[54:50] demon
[54:56] and Samuel was set up as a leadership as
[55:00] the last judge and a
[55:02] prophet Samuel L Israel in spiritual
[55:05] renewal and great victories and it's
[55:08] amazing to see that quickly how quickly
[55:12] as the prophetic the prophetic is set up
[55:16] that the children of Israel begin to
[55:17] lean on this prophetic they begin to
[55:20] lean on his on his gift they begin to
[55:23] lean on everything that Samuel would say
[55:26] and they had got away from the they had
[55:28] got away from true worship but a real
[55:31] Prophet will set up true worship in
[55:34] spirit and in truth and when Samuel
[55:37] comes to them in 1st Samuel chapter 7 he
[55:40] comes in there and he restores through
[55:42] worship he comes back there and kills he
[55:45] kills a sacrifice sets up an army sets
[55:49] up an altar and God the Bible said that
[55:51] God thundered out a great Victory
[55:54] because these things were set up and
[55:56] immediately it's a quick it's amazing
[55:59] how quickly that the children of God can
[56:01] forget how powerful that their God
[56:03] is you see well that's not possible it's
[56:06] a I'm a real I'm the part I'm a part of
[56:08] the Bride of Jesus Christ I see the
[56:11] supernatural but you get sick one time
[56:13] in your body you start to get that
[56:16] feeling in your head well maybe it's not
[56:18] just a
[56:20] headache am I talking to you maybe maybe
[56:23] it's tumors maybe it's cancer maybe it's
[56:25] this and all of a sudden you begin to
[56:27] doubt what God did Even though last
[56:30] weekend he did something
[56:32] Supernatural but how quickly the enemy
[56:35] comes in there and robs you of how great
[56:38] the god that is your
[56:41] king he'll immediately come in there and
[56:43] immediately they begin to
[56:46] ask they begin to demand a
[56:51] king they have seen God split the Seas
[56:54] they have seen God stop the sun they
[56:57] have seen God they have seen God do all
[57:00] the
[57:01] miraculous even in Gideon's life they
[57:04] saw the miraculous even in Deborah's
[57:06] life they saw the miraculous even in
[57:09] Samson's life they saw the miraculous
[57:11] but these
[57:13] people were
[57:15] demanding a
[57:18] king and the reason why these people's
[57:21] desire had got so demanding was it had
[57:26] stemmed from the very
[57:30] thought they had rejected God's
[57:33] rulership they had rejected his direct
[57:36] Rule and they were it was reflecting of
[57:39] the lack of the trust that they had in
[57:41] almighty God and just to lay this here
[57:45] in in 1 Samuel chapter 8 you I'm not
[57:48] just going to bounce and hit the
[57:49] highlights real you see God's
[57:51] instruction to Samuel after he hears
[57:54] this He commands the people of God to
[57:56] listen to him that he he he gives him a
[57:59] solemn instruction and he forars him
[58:02] that this is going to be the
[58:04] consequences of what happens if you if
[58:06] you have a king So Samuel warns the
[58:09] people from the Lord that this man's
[58:11] going to be a military man he's going to
[58:14] take your sons he's going to put them in
[58:16] an army he'll put them over chariots and
[58:18] Horsemen and Runners he will set up
[58:20] military leadership he will put your
[58:23] daughters in labor he will Seize Your
[58:25] Land and all of your resources he will
[58:28] take he will take a tenth of your grain
[58:30] and your Vineyards and set up taxes he
[58:33] will set up the the best of enslavement
[58:36] servants and take your best animals he
[58:39] will put a tax on your best livestock
[58:43] and there's going to come a time that
[58:45] you are going to get to a spot that you
[58:48] will literally cry out in regret for
[58:51] praying for a king
[58:56] but the people were so
[58:58] stubborn that they refused the
[59:01] leadership of the Holy Ghost and even
[59:04] though they knew the consequences of
[59:07] what was coming they demanded a
[59:10] king you see what God was saying to them
[59:14] if you do this you are going to lose
[59:16] your freedoms right the prophet said in
[59:20] the rejected King he said and this he
[59:22] said and this seemed to be that Israel
[59:25] wanted to pattern themselves like these
[59:27] Kings like these people he said but it
[59:29] has never been in any age God's
[59:31] intentions for his people to act like
[59:33] the people of the world or to be
[59:35] governed or controlled like the people
[59:37] of the world God's people is always a
[59:40] peculiar people or a different people or
[59:43] a called out people or a separated
[59:46] people and all allog together different
[59:49] in their actions in their ways in their
[59:51] manner of living that's what the people
[59:54] of the world has you see by your actions
[59:58] you choose who you are making
[1:00:02] King when you choose to skip church you
[1:00:06] are choosing who your king is when you
[1:00:09] choose to deny God the tenth of your of
[1:00:13] your sacrifice you are choosing who your
[1:00:16] king is I'm not looking at you for a
[1:00:19] reason but when you choose to worship
[1:00:22] the idols of leosia more
[1:00:26] more than the King of Kings you are
[1:00:28] choosing who your king is but there is
[1:00:32] something powerful about men and women
[1:00:35] that choose to be like the true and
[1:00:38] living example the one that gave up his
[1:00:41] very life he set up his kingship before
[1:00:44] the foundation of the world and when he
[1:00:47] got here he said I must be about my
[1:00:50] father's
[1:00:52] business the world constantly wants to
[1:00:54] be like this one or be like that one but
[1:00:57] ask for
[1:01:00] me I want to be like
[1:01:07] Jesus you see no matter how much Samuel
[1:01:11] tried to persuade the people
[1:01:13] continually they went out to him day and
[1:01:17] night and said we want a
[1:01:21] king and the prophet said he said it's a
[1:01:24] very much a parallel of to today because
[1:01:27] that man seems to have that same
[1:01:30] idea they don't seem to be able to grasp
[1:01:33] that that God still rules man instead of
[1:01:36] man ruling man I pray you forgive me I
[1:01:41] was out in that wind just just a few
[1:01:43] minutes and it seemed to wipe my voice
[1:01:45] this
[1:01:50] week it's the same thing
[1:01:54] today men look on the
[1:01:56] outside instead of the
[1:01:58] inside because they wanted to be exactly
[1:02:01] like the amots and the
[1:02:04] Philistines they had looked out there
[1:02:06] and they had saw what Le osia had and
[1:02:09] they wanted it for their own they seen
[1:02:12] how everybody else worshiped and they
[1:02:14] was able to get by with cutting off
[1:02:16] their skirts and bringing them up a
[1:02:18] little bit higher and trimming their
[1:02:20] hair and able to get by and call it
[1:02:22] worship you see they wanted that kind of
[1:02:25] worship ship but they didn't realize
[1:02:28] when they were accepting that kind of a
[1:02:30] worship they were rejecting not Samuel
[1:02:33] not William pranam but they were
[1:02:35] rejecting the
[1:02:40] king so they wanted the biggest church
[1:02:45] they wanted the finest Scholars so they
[1:02:48] picked out a Saul brother mam said he
[1:02:51] was a seven foot kind of a man had dark
[1:02:54] hair grease back he said he was he was
[1:02:58] that kind of a guy he said he was super
[1:03:00] handsome he said but when it come to
[1:03:02] what God picked out it was a little
[1:03:05] bitty old Ruddy red hited boy red hitted
[1:03:08] boy that was made man after his own
[1:03:12] heart because he when he was setting up
[1:03:15] the davidic kingship he stood there
[1:03:18] before all of Jess's sons and said man
[1:03:22] looks on the outward appearance but God
[1:03:25] looks on on the heart and there's a lot
[1:03:28] of people in a lot of churches today had
[1:03:31] said serve God serve God from your heart
[1:03:35] just follow your heart and it'll always
[1:03:37] come out right that is not scriptural by
[1:03:40] what by no means you follow the word and
[1:03:44] you'll come out right you follow your
[1:03:46] heart the heart is a deceitful thing and
[1:03:50] the heart will rob you of what God has
[1:03:53] for you
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:57] you see the reason why David was a man
[1:03:59] after God's Own Heart was because God
[1:04:02] had deposited something before David was
[1:04:04] ever born of Jesse he was born a king
[1:04:09] you see a prophet does not go into and
[1:04:13] develop develop the abilities to become
[1:04:15] a prophet gifts and callings are without
[1:04:19] repentance David was born a king he did
[1:04:23] not join into a King's family even
[1:04:26] though he married Saul's daughter but
[1:04:29] the reason why David could become king
[1:04:32] was because God set him
[1:04:38] up you see the reason why you are a
[1:04:41] people after God's Own Heart it's what
[1:04:44] he put on the inside of you you may not
[1:04:47] look like the biggest church you may not
[1:04:50] have the most profound ways of speaking
[1:04:53] things but God has predestinated you and
[1:04:58] ordained you against all ODS he knew
[1:05:01] that you would stand here he knew that
[1:05:04] you may not be beautiful you may not be
[1:05:06] handsome you may not be the most
[1:05:08] smartest but you were
[1:05:15] his when our King
[1:05:19] came he was
[1:05:21] despised and rejected of men and there
[1:05:25] was no beauty that we should desire
[1:05:29] him when he stood there the Pharisees
[1:05:33] even though he was 30 years old the
[1:05:36] Pharisees thought he had so much
[1:05:38] pressure on him they deemed him to be a
[1:05:41] man about the age of 50 because the
[1:05:44] prees of your sin was upon this
[1:05:49] King you don't realize
[1:05:52] this but ever since the garden you you
[1:05:55] have been demanding a
[1:06:01] king now brother random said this in a
[1:06:03] in church age he said just as the early
[1:06:06] church started out under the pure
[1:06:07] Ministry of the holy spirit with signs
[1:06:10] and wonders and
[1:06:11] manifestations such as prophecy and
[1:06:14] tongues and interpretation wisdom and
[1:06:16] knowledge and healing and so in the days
[1:06:19] of Israel when they left Egypt they were
[1:06:22] under the leadership of the spirit of
[1:06:24] God manifesting in gifts God was the
[1:06:27] leader of the people actually he was
[1:06:30] their King he was a father King he took
[1:06:33] care of Israel like a man takes care of
[1:06:34] his family he fed them he fought their
[1:06:37] battles he smoothed away their
[1:06:39] difficulties and settled their problems
[1:06:41] he just busied himself over them and
[1:06:44] they were only a
[1:06:46] nation they were the only nation to
[1:06:49] which he was truly God but one day they
[1:06:51] got to looking around and they saw the
[1:06:54] Philistines over and the other nations
[1:06:56] was Kings over them and it caught their
[1:06:58] eyes and they decided that they ought to
[1:07:00] humanize their
[1:07:02] leadership so they wanted a king he said
[1:07:05] now God was going to humanize the
[1:07:06] leadership himself in the in the person
[1:07:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ but they got
[1:07:11] ahead of him you see Satan knew the plan
[1:07:13] of God so he put it in the hearts of the
[1:07:16] people to get ahead of the word you see
[1:07:19] Satan will put it in your heart to get
[1:07:22] ahead of the plan of God you know
[1:07:24] somebody you see it on their life that
[1:07:27] they are elected you can see the Holy
[1:07:29] Spirit working on them but don't you
[1:07:31] clean them up let him clean them
[1:07:35] up God did not set up
[1:07:39] humans to clean humans he set up the
[1:07:42] Holy Spirit to bring in Sons and
[1:07:46] Daughters of God the humanizing of the
[1:07:49] leadership is our Lord Jesus
[1:07:53] Christ blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:07:56] God knows who is and God know who isn't
[1:08:00] so let him be
[1:08:04] God I say this unto you your children
[1:08:08] will receive the Holy Ghost but let him
[1:08:11] give
[1:08:13] it you will receive your healing but let
[1:08:16] him work
[1:08:18] it you are in position for your Miracle
[1:08:21] but stand fast in the faith
[1:08:27] don't put it on brother Ron don't put it
[1:08:29] on brother Tim don't put it on one of
[1:08:31] these brothers laying their hands on you
[1:08:33] put it back in the hands of
[1:08:38] Jesus that's the problem with so many
[1:08:41] marriages they have taken their marriage
[1:08:43] and put it in their own hands and they
[1:08:45] took it out of the hand of God it's time
[1:08:49] that you revisit your vows when you were
[1:08:51] standing there before God and all of
[1:08:54] these Witnesses
[1:08:56] it's time that you put your marriage
[1:08:59] back in the hands of God it's time that
[1:09:01] you put your business back in the hands
[1:09:03] of God it's time you put your finances
[1:09:14] back how tragic that was little did they
[1:09:21] realize I tell you what I'm going get
[1:09:24] the devil
[1:09:27] he Afflicted my voice I might have to
[1:09:29] preach this again so it's so it's real
[1:09:31] profound for you but I I'm going get the
[1:09:35] devil he said how tragic that was that
[1:09:37] little little did they know or realize
[1:09:40] that when they were asking God to let
[1:09:42] them be like the rest of the world they
[1:09:44] were rejecting him because God had
[1:09:46] ordained or ordained that his people act
[1:09:49] different from the world they're not of
[1:09:51] the world they don't look like the world
[1:09:53] they don't act like the world they are
[1:09:55] crucified under the world and the world
[1:09:57] is crucified under them because the
[1:09:59] Bible said in 2 Corinthians
[1:10:04] 6:17 wherefore come out from amongst
[1:10:07] them and be ye separate save the Lord
[1:10:09] and touch not their unclean thing and I
[1:10:11] will receive you and I'll be my be a
[1:10:14] father unto you you be my sons and
[1:10:16] daughters sayith the Lord Almighty you
[1:10:18] see the difference between Israel and
[1:10:20] the rest of the Nations was God you put
[1:10:23] God to one side and Israel was like any
[1:10:25] other Nation when Samson cut off his
[1:10:28] hair he was like any other man you put
[1:10:30] the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside
[1:10:32] and the church is nothing but the world
[1:10:35] with God's name attached to it you could
[1:10:38] take Samson he was just a little bitty
[1:10:39] old guy but let the spirit of God get on
[1:10:42] him and he could tie up foxes he could
[1:10:45] destroy a thousand
[1:10:47] Philistines but without that power he
[1:10:50] was helpless and so are you if you move
[1:10:54] without the holy Spirit you're helpless
[1:10:56] if you act without the Holy Spirit
[1:10:58] you're helpless if you dance without the
[1:11:01] Holy Spirit you're dancing in the
[1:11:05] wrong but if you worship with the Holy
[1:11:08] Ghost then your worship is right if you
[1:11:10] dance with the Holy Ghost then you're
[1:11:12] dancing is
[1:11:21] right the world and the church are all
[1:11:23] of the same lump just like Jacob and
[1:11:26] Esau were of the same parents but the
[1:11:29] spirit of
[1:11:30] God makes the
[1:11:34] difference you see
[1:11:37] sisters that
[1:11:39] wear wear a Holiness
[1:11:47] standard but the difference between you
[1:11:49] and them is a spirit of
[1:11:52] God there are a lot of people there are
[1:11:55] a lot of women that do not cut their
[1:11:57] hair because they read it in the
[1:11:59] Bible but the difference between you and
[1:12:01] them is the spirit of God there's a lot
[1:12:05] of men that are still men that are
[1:12:08] morally good
[1:12:09] men are you with me they're still good
[1:12:12] men they still believe in rightful
[1:12:14] things they still read their Bible but
[1:12:16] the difference between you and them is
[1:12:20] the spirit of
[1:12:21] God I'll show you how big the difference
[1:12:24] is when the tribulation comes you're not
[1:12:27] counted in the tribulation because of
[1:12:29] one difference the spirit of
[1:12:34] God you said well is this message really
[1:12:37] worth living for I'll say it is because
[1:12:41] this message will get you out of a
[1:12:43] tribulation and put you in a
[1:12:48] Rapture you see the difference between
[1:12:51] us and them we have a king
[1:13:01] H you see God is Sovereign on all of his
[1:13:06] ways that God sees before you ever make
[1:13:10] a choice that 450 years before 1st
[1:13:15] Samuel chapter 8 there in Deuteronomy
[1:13:17] Deuteronomy 17 and4 he said when you
[1:13:21] call for a king when you call for a king
[1:13:24] I will set it up this way when you come
[1:13:26] into the land and you ask for a king he
[1:13:29] said it'll be one that I choose so he
[1:13:32] knew that they were going to ask for a
[1:13:34] king he but notice his sovereignty in it
[1:13:37] he said but he'll be one that's taken
[1:13:39] from your brethren that I choose you see
[1:13:44] how powerful God
[1:13:46] is even in your own
[1:13:48] choices that was leading you astray he
[1:13:52] was in your desires
[1:13:55] you know the Bible said it's one of the
[1:13:56] most powerful scriptures in Psalms
[1:13:59] chapter 37
[1:14:00] and4 that he will give you Delight
[1:14:03] thyself in the Lord and He will give you
[1:14:06] the very desires of your
[1:14:12] heart excuse me now
[1:14:17] notice the church world didn't want the
[1:14:20] Holy
[1:14:22] Ghost you hear Brother brand I'm sitting
[1:14:24] there
[1:14:25] brother bham is is not just one of the
[1:14:29] guys brother bham is standing with the
[1:14:32] elite of the age he stands with
[1:14:35] presidents he stands with Governors he
[1:14:37] stands with congressmen he goes and he
[1:14:40] actually sets with Kings and praise for
[1:14:42] kings and he is sitting there with the
[1:14:44] leaders of denominations and he's
[1:14:47] standing there and they are rejecting
[1:14:49] the Holy Ghost there are certain
[1:14:52] denominations that will reject you
[1:14:54] because you you say holy ghost instead
[1:14:56] of Holy Spirit and brother Brandon was
[1:14:59] talking to a Catholic woman one time and
[1:15:01] he said to her he said unless you go up
[1:15:04] there and get drunk on the Holy Ghost
[1:15:07] like the Mary like the mother of Jesus
[1:15:11] like she went up there say he and that
[1:15:13] woman said you mean to tell me that I
[1:15:15] got to go up there and Frolic and get
[1:15:17] the Holy Ghost like they got it he said
[1:15:19] 'absolutely you do she said 'w I don't
[1:15:21] want to go to heaven then he said 'w I
[1:15:23] highly doubt you'll ever be there'
[1:15:25] I don't care if the Pope's in
[1:15:27] heaven I want to go to
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:34] heaven some of you a little bit worried
[1:15:36] about that
[1:15:38] statement I don't care who's here I want
[1:15:41] to be there I don't care if Elvis
[1:15:43] press's here or marelon Monroe's there I
[1:15:46] want to
[1:15:49] go I don't care
[1:15:55] and I don't want to see my worst enemy
[1:15:58] go the other
[1:16:00] direction but the world doesn't want
[1:16:03] this Holy Ghost the world doesn't want
[1:16:05] what you
[1:16:06] got because they they they they want a
[1:16:09] refined worship they want somebody that
[1:16:12] looks apart that says amen just right
[1:16:16] doesn't sweat all over the place doesn't
[1:16:19] hoop and holler and gets out his message
[1:16:21] in 15 minutes
[1:16:26] that's
[1:16:27] true I was dealing with a man one time
[1:16:30] that was fixing my Fork Clift he was
[1:16:32] surfice in my for Clifton he's standing
[1:16:35] there I forget which denomination he was
[1:16:37] he's he's standing there telling me real
[1:16:39] good guy real good guy and he standing
[1:16:43] there and he was telling me about he
[1:16:45] said you know he said we're looking
[1:16:46] about getting a different Pastor he said
[1:16:48] he's a good guy and he said but likes to
[1:16:50] get to
[1:16:51] drinking likes to get drinking he said
[1:16:54] he said I'm okay with him drinking he
[1:16:55] said but he can't show up to our church
[1:16:57] our church things our our programs
[1:17:03] drunk I think it's time you change
[1:17:06] churches no you don't need to change
[1:17:08] pastors you need to change
[1:17:11] churches you see they want that kind of
[1:17:13] it well the pastor didn't just suit me
[1:17:15] just right so we'll we'll just vote in
[1:17:17] another
[1:17:20] one you know brother Brandon was
[1:17:22] standing there and he would sit there
[1:17:23] and he said now he said what you had
[1:17:25] it's a genuine Holy Ghost he said but
[1:17:28] you wouldn't leave good enough alone he
[1:17:30] said and you went in there and you
[1:17:31] organized it he said that was a true
[1:17:33] holy spirit that fell back there 40
[1:17:35] years ago he said but you wouldn't leave
[1:17:37] it alone and you begin to organize it
[1:17:40] and said this is the way it's got to be
[1:17:42] but the prophet said that God's church
[1:17:45] is free God's church is bound by No
[1:17:48] Boundaries from sea to Sea it's gods and
[1:17:51] every human being under the Earth
[1:17:53] belongs to God so God sets the
[1:17:56] boundaries not maning their wisdom of
[1:17:59] how much you got to read your Bible and
[1:18:01] how much you got to pray and how many
[1:18:03] tapes you got to listen to and how much
[1:18:05] wisdom you got to
[1:18:07] have I'll say it like this how bad do
[1:18:10] you want the Holy Ghost like Mary got it
[1:18:13] like Peter got it like Paul got
[1:18:18] it come on some you don't need seven
[1:18:21] steps to get the Holy Ghost Jesus said
[1:18:24] except you be born
[1:18:26] again you cannot even understand the
[1:18:29] kingdom of
[1:18:34] God let me go a little bit further you
[1:18:37] don't have to lean to No Man's
[1:18:39] understanding you don't have to lean to
[1:18:41] No Man's ideas of what it takes to get
[1:18:43] the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what it
[1:18:45] takes the Holy Ghost it says acts two
[1:18:48] prescription of repent and be baptized
[1:18:52] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:18:54] remissions of your sins and you shall
[1:18:56] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost This
[1:18:59] Promise is unto you and to your children
[1:19:02] and to them that are as far off as many
[1:19:04] as the Lord Our God shall call you ain't
[1:19:07] got to lean to some Bishop's idea you
[1:19:09] ain't got to lean to some Pope's idea
[1:19:12] there's a king that is the King of Kings
[1:19:15] and the Lord of lords
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:26] I love when Hosea 13:9
[1:19:30] says oh
[1:19:32] Israel thou Hast destroyed
[1:19:35] thyself but in me is thine
[1:19:39] help I will be thy King where is any
[1:19:43] other that may save thee in all thy
[1:19:45] cities thy judges of whom thou
[1:19:49] sayest give me a king and
[1:19:52] princes I gave thee a king of mine anger
[1:19:55] and took him away in my wrath so God is
[1:19:59] showing that if you trust in human
[1:20:01] authority it'll lead you to
[1:20:04] disappointment but if you trust in God
[1:20:07] it'll bring his blessings because the
[1:20:09] Bible said in Jeremiah 17:5 thus sayith
[1:20:12] the Lord cursed be the man that trusteth
[1:20:15] in a man and maketh flesh's arms and
[1:20:17] whose heart departeth from the Lord for
[1:20:19] he shall be like a heath in the desert
[1:20:21] that's a tree without moisture and shall
[1:20:23] not see when good cometh but shall
[1:20:25] inhabit the parched places in the
[1:20:27] wilderness in a salt land and not
[1:20:29] inhabit it blessed is the man that
[1:20:32] trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the
[1:20:34] Lord is for he shall be as a tree
[1:20:37] planted By the Waters that spreadeth out
[1:20:39] her Roots by the river and shall not see
[1:20:41] when he cometh but her leavf shall be
[1:20:44] green and shall not be careful in the
[1:20:45] year of drought neither shall cease from
[1:20:48] yielding
[1:20:49] fruit that's a man that trusts in the
[1:20:53] Lord this world is so demanding of you
[1:20:56] and
[1:20:59] I where are you going to spend your
[1:21:01] energies out where are you going to
[1:21:03] spend your extra time at why don't you
[1:21:05] come over here why don't you come over
[1:21:07] there it's constantly somebody wanting
[1:21:09] you to go to this party or that party or
[1:21:12] come over here and and do this and do
[1:21:15] that but who are you going to let rule
[1:21:17] your
[1:21:20] life maybe I'll just talk to
[1:21:23] you who who you going to let rule your
[1:21:26] life who you going to let be who you
[1:21:29] going to let be your
[1:21:30] king when Israel was in this spot I'd
[1:21:34] say they never
[1:21:36] intended they never intended on getting
[1:21:38] a saw that would allow some amonite King
[1:21:42] to
[1:21:42] live they never expected to get a Ahab
[1:21:46] that would turning him back and bringing
[1:21:48] a jezebel wife I'd say they never
[1:21:50] intended to get a jobor that would bring
[1:21:52] in false worship and deny the almighty
[1:21:55] God I say you they never intended they
[1:21:58] never intended to get a Herod in there
[1:21:59] that would kill the King of Kings they
[1:22:02] didn't know what they were asking for
[1:22:04] when they said give us a king give us a
[1:22:08] king but in the age of mu and I are
[1:22:10] living in the prophet would preach and
[1:22:13] in the God of this evil age he would
[1:22:14] stand there he would stand there and say
[1:22:17] he said no he said God he said either
[1:22:19] God has lost control or there's or
[1:22:22] there's something going on there's there
[1:22:24] two opposing spirits that are at work
[1:22:27] there's two opposing Spirits he said one
[1:22:29] of them is God's spirit and the other
[1:22:31] one is a devil's Spirit he said but God
[1:22:34] is bringing a bride and the reason how
[1:22:37] he's bringing a bride is because he's
[1:22:39] bringing a Vindicated message and he's
[1:22:42] bringing in this bride so you
[1:22:46] realize oh man I wish I had the voice of
[1:22:49] 10,000
[1:22:50] angels the reason why you are under this
[1:22:53] kingship it's because a Vindicated
[1:22:56] message came by your way you see the
[1:22:59] evil spirit is out there and he's
[1:23:01] preaching unbelief and and idolatry and
[1:23:04] the unpure word but God's spirit is
[1:23:08] gathering in a people and he's setting
[1:23:10] up Kings and Priests in this generation
[1:23:15] Hall the Bible
[1:23:17] said in Proverbs 25 and
[1:23:21] 28 he that hath no rule
[1:23:25] of his own spirit is like a city that's
[1:23:28] broken down and without
[1:23:31] walls so imagine your heart as a
[1:23:36] fortress with strong walls and a locked
[1:23:39] gate that God's word is the foundation
[1:23:43] of that
[1:23:44] Fortress and that Fortress provides you
[1:23:46] with
[1:23:48] security it protects you from spiritual
[1:23:51] enemies it guards off every every attack
[1:23:54] of the
[1:23:56] enemy but every time you begin to doubt
[1:24:00] God's word and you begin to let unbelief
[1:24:02] and sin get in
[1:24:04] there it's like you are unlocking the
[1:24:07] gate to this
[1:24:09] Fortress and every time you begin to let
[1:24:11] unbelief come in and saying well those
[1:24:13] things are for days going by you're
[1:24:15] leaving the gate
[1:24:17] open and every single time you allow
[1:24:20] disbelief to come in and so well it it
[1:24:23] maybe it's for this brother for that
[1:24:24] brother you're leaving the gate open you
[1:24:27] look at the example of Eve there and all
[1:24:29] of a sudden the serpent starts talking
[1:24:31] to her and he starts telling her said
[1:24:33] now surely surely God didn't mean what
[1:24:36] he meant and immediately when she said
[1:24:39] when she said what he told me these
[1:24:41] things and she begin to open up the gate
[1:24:44] and all of a sudden unbelief got in and
[1:24:47] it created the greatest crevice in the
[1:24:49] Fortress then and you look at Judas you
[1:24:54] look at Judas he was walking with Elohim
[1:24:57] in flesh he was as close as anybody was
[1:25:01] close to him but as soon as he allowed
[1:25:05] temptation to start coming in and the
[1:25:07] enemy to start whispering lies that
[1:25:11] surely I love what the prophet said and
[1:25:13] lean not to an I own understanding he
[1:25:16] Judas he said Judas really believe that
[1:25:19] Jesus had got himself out of this
[1:25:22] mess he was leaning on his own
[1:25:24] understanding and as soon as he was
[1:25:27] tempted to turn him in and deny him for
[1:25:30] 30 pieces of silver the crevice begin to
[1:25:34] crack the stronghold begin to the thing
[1:25:38] got ajar and all of a sudden the enemy
[1:25:40] kept coming in there you think you can
[1:25:43] handle these things you think you can
[1:25:46] handle the little bitty Temptations but
[1:25:48] I'll tell you what it'll do Judas
[1:25:50] thought he could handle it but I'll tell
[1:25:52] you where to leave you it leave you
[1:25:54] hanging on a
[1:25:56] tree because Judas was not willing to go
[1:26:00] where Peter was willing to go Peter
[1:26:03] didn't look like the man Mary didn't
[1:26:06] look like the woman but they were
[1:26:08] willing to go to Pentecost and Judas
[1:26:10] wasn't willing to go
[1:26:13] there Judas his
[1:26:16] Spirit went back to
[1:26:19] Sean but Jesus when he was hanging on
[1:26:23] the cross he Spirit Hallelujah went 50
[1:26:27] days later and was released on the day
[1:26:29] of
[1:26:30] Pentecost you see the power of the
[1:26:34] spirit that was on the
[1:26:36] man because one went to hell but one
[1:26:41] Hallelujah ascended to the
[1:26:45] heights
[1:26:47] Hallelujah and they opened up the gates
[1:26:50] and said who is the king of
[1:26:53] glory he is the god that is mighty in
[1:26:59] battle and in your
[1:27:01] life when you start
[1:27:05] listening to your country
[1:27:09] music I'm talking to you cuz I can't
[1:27:12] preach if I could preach I'd preach but
[1:27:15] as soon as you let that music of country
[1:27:21] music well it's not a problem for me
[1:27:25] come on as soon as you start listening
[1:27:27] to your rap music well it's not a
[1:27:29] problem for me as soon as you start
[1:27:32] putting in that Copenhagen one more time
[1:27:35] well it's not a problem for me as soon
[1:27:38] as you start looking on things you
[1:27:40] shouldn't be looking for I'll tell you
[1:27:42] what you're doing you're creating a a
[1:27:43] huge
[1:27:46] crack I love what Peter Peter says in 1
[1:27:50] Peter 5 and8 be sober be vigilant
[1:27:53] because your adversary the devil's going
[1:27:56] around like a roaring lion seeking whom
[1:27:58] he may devour so he's literally creeping
[1:28:00] around looking for the ones that that
[1:28:03] are just hanging on to them addictions
[1:28:05] and hanging on to them things of the
[1:28:07] world and hanging on to
[1:28:09] this and I'll tell you what you're doing
[1:28:12] let me just let me just let me just say
[1:28:14] it like this you are hanging a sign on
[1:28:18] your door Thieves are welcome
[1:28:22] here you let the door open you let the
[1:28:26] door open all of a sudden jealousy got
[1:28:28] in there unbelief got in there fear got
[1:28:32] in there complexes got in there you see
[1:28:35] your heart is demanding of a king but
[1:28:39] who are you going to allow to be king
[1:28:42] because when brilliam brandham comes
[1:28:43] there and future home in 1964 he takes a
[1:28:46] whiteboard or Blackboard and he draws
[1:28:49] out two hearts he draws out two hearts
[1:28:52] and he puts a snake in one and a Dove
[1:28:54] and another one and he says this one is
[1:28:56] the
[1:28:57] Pharisee he said but this one is the
[1:29:00] woman at the well he said but the
[1:29:02] difference was was she had
[1:29:06] representation by
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:10] predestination you see it matters who
[1:29:14] you let be king of your
[1:29:19] life you let Satan become the king of
[1:29:22] your ideas
[1:29:24] and I guarantee you you will live a
[1:29:26] miserable
[1:29:28] week you let him crown you with a crabby
[1:29:33] Spirit you watch what kind of weak
[1:29:35] you'll
[1:29:37] have but if you let King of Kings and
[1:29:41] the Lord of lords set his crown of Love
[1:29:44] on your heart everybody around you said
[1:29:47] what have you done with your life
[1:30:00] brother random lays in
[1:30:01] there it lays in there on the
[1:30:06] historical of the progression of
[1:30:09] salvation of justification
[1:30:11] sanctification and the Holy Ghost of a
[1:30:15] Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostal
[1:30:18] movement he said come all the way up to
[1:30:21] the Holy Spirit to the baptism of the
[1:30:23] Holy Holy Spirit and I love what brother
[1:30:25] random does when he lays those things in
[1:30:28] there he comes on the backside of it he
[1:30:29] said but here we are in the end time he
[1:30:33] said here we are back to the person
[1:30:36] himself it's no longer it's no longer
[1:30:40] guessing if he's there if he's the king
[1:30:42] of your
[1:30:42] heart he is the king of your
[1:30:45] heart he's the king of your emotions
[1:30:49] he's the king of your life I'll tell you
[1:30:51] the Gospel of Jesus Christ it'll work on
[1:30:54] the most rankest
[1:30:56] Sinners it'll work on the lowest of
[1:30:59] lows the gospel if it be preached it'll
[1:31:03] produce power it'll be it'll produce
[1:31:06] demonstrations it'll produce
[1:31:08] Miracles if it's preached in its
[1:31:11] fullness it'll make blls lie down it'll
[1:31:15] make Hornets go back to its nest it'll
[1:31:18] make a tree wither up and
[1:31:20] die so I know that if it's preached in
[1:31:23] it's power
[1:31:24] that it can save the lost it can redeem
[1:31:27] the broken it can restore those that
[1:31:30] need
[1:31:31] restoring it can bring you back to
[1:31:40] fellowship I love what brother bam does
[1:31:42] I'm I'm just trying to drop some some
[1:31:45] points
[1:31:47] here brother bham goes
[1:31:50] in 1956 in Perfection and brother Bram
[1:31:53] lay some very powerful things in that
[1:31:56] sermon he goes in
[1:31:58] there and he said Jesus goes to the
[1:32:01] lowest of hell and he gets down there
[1:32:04] and I love what brother Bron does he
[1:32:05] said he goes down there and he does
[1:32:07] undoes he said he undo the kink in the
[1:32:11] Rope he undos the kink in the rope and
[1:32:14] he bridged the gap for man get to get
[1:32:16] safely crossed back to
[1:32:19] him he said and running
[1:32:21] down running down he said he said what
[1:32:24] he did he went in there and he unkinked
[1:32:26] the chain he said now over top of that
[1:32:29] chain runs the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:32] it restores man back to the rightful
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:40] position there was a man one
[1:32:43] day that was sitting in
[1:32:46] a that was sitting in a prison
[1:32:51] cell and he was worthy of death
[1:32:55] he's worthy of
[1:33:00] death he had stole he had cheated he was
[1:33:04] a murderer he was no
[1:33:07] good and he knew that he was be about to
[1:33:10] be put to life put to
[1:33:12] death he could hear a crowd on the
[1:33:15] outside screaming all kinds of things
[1:33:23] today's
[1:33:26] Passover they they demand The Prisoner
[1:33:29] on this
[1:33:32] day I'll be surely put to death
[1:33:36] today and all of a
[1:33:38] sudden here comes a guard the prison
[1:33:41] guard walking down through the cell and
[1:33:44] he comes in and he hears the keys of
[1:33:49] jingling and he begins to cry and he
[1:33:51] begins to scream out they're going to
[1:33:53] put me death
[1:33:55] today and the prison guard opens up the
[1:33:58] door and said
[1:34:00] barabus go on do what you want to go on
[1:34:04] do what you want to you're free he
[1:34:07] looked at the prison guard said how am I
[1:34:10] free how am I free and brother random
[1:34:14] said oh I was that
[1:34:20] baramas I was
[1:34:22] saamis I was worthy of
[1:34:25] death he said how am I able to go
[1:34:31] free how am I able to he said let me
[1:34:33] show you something he you see up there
[1:34:36] on that Hill he said you hear that sound
[1:34:39] bumping up that road right there you see
[1:34:42] that man carrying that load that man
[1:34:46] took your
[1:34:47] cross so that you could go
[1:34:51] free and the prophet started singing
[1:34:54] Amazing Grace and he said I was a
[1:34:57] worse than
[1:35:02] Barabas I was that
[1:35:05] barabus but I needed a
[1:35:09] king I needed a king because a king is
[1:35:14] not a King Without a kingdom you see
[1:35:17] Satan is not the king of your life only
[1:35:21] if you allow him to give him to have
[1:35:23] access to your kingdom so take your
[1:35:26] heart away from him tell him your heart
[1:35:29] is the kingdom of almighty God but my
[1:35:32] life needed a king that could restore me
[1:35:36] and my heart was demanding a
[1:35:41] king
[1:35:44] Hallelujah because my king knew that men
[1:35:48] would reject you my king knew that men
[1:35:51] would talk about you my king knew knew
[1:35:53] that men would talk about this message
[1:35:55] you believe
[1:35:57] in but he saw
[1:36:01] you he said oh
[1:36:03] no you see if my kingdom was of this
[1:36:06] world then my kingdom would fight but
[1:36:10] because my kingdom is not of this
[1:36:13] world
[1:36:15] hallelujah hallelujah you see my kingdom
[1:36:19] if my kingdom was of this world then my
[1:36:21] kingdom would fight but Jesus turns to
[1:36:24] his disciples and said the kingdom of
[1:36:26] God will be within you and William
[1:36:29] brandham said that the kingdom and the
[1:36:32] powers and the Holy Angels all of their
[1:36:35] backing is in every son and daughter of
[1:36:38] almighty
[1:36:40] God so every demon has to flee cancer
[1:36:44] has to move sickness has to leave
[1:36:47] depression has to take its
[1:36:50] hold brother Matt every demon that has
[1:36:54] Afflicted your entire move of coming
[1:36:56] here has to leave because you are not
[1:36:59] under the kingship of Satan you are
[1:37:02] under the kingship of almighty
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:17] God cancer has to obey
[1:37:21] right right
[1:37:24] because the king of a jungle is a line
[1:37:28] and everything shuts up when the king
[1:37:31] Roars and in this age We Have Heard It
[1:37:34] In Amos 3 and 7 we have saw it in
[1:37:37] Revelations 10 The
[1:37:39] Lion The King The King the lion of the
[1:37:43] tribe of Judah hath
[1:37:45] prevailed every demon has to Bow every
[1:37:48] accuser has to Bow every sickness has to
[1:37:52] Bow I say this unto you in the name of
[1:37:55] Jesus Christ Le oosa has to take its
[1:37:58] hand off of God's Property and bow to
[1:38:02] the name of Jesus
[1:38:08] Christ you have that clip for
[1:38:11] us no clip that's all right I'll preach
[1:38:16] just a minute till they get that clip
[1:38:18] cuz it's worth it if you if you're okay
[1:38:21] to work for a minute how love the
[1:38:34] Lord Satan likes to set his boundaries
[1:38:38] you just wave your hand at me when
[1:38:40] you're ready Satan likes to set his
[1:38:42] boundaries and say you can only go this
[1:38:45] far he likes to set things and say you
[1:38:47] can't go past
[1:38:48] this trouble can trouble can come
[1:38:51] against you but I love what the prophet
[1:38:53] said is that God harnesses trouble he
[1:38:58] puts it like a a horse it puts puts puts
[1:39:01] it in a in a horse's mouth he he puts it
[1:39:03] like a bit in a horse's mouth and it
[1:39:05] controls that trouble so trouble can
[1:39:08] only go so far as God will allow it so
[1:39:12] the things that are hindering you have a
[1:39:14] boundary on it the things that are
[1:39:16] afflicting you have a boundary on it I
[1:39:20] want I want to say this to you I want
[1:39:24] you to expect the greatest experience of
[1:39:27] an outpouring of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:39:30] life because God has no
[1:39:33] boundaries God has no boundaries on who
[1:39:36] gets
[1:39:37] a on who get set free the only boundary
[1:39:42] limits that he has is his
[1:39:44] election but Satan can only go so
[1:39:50] far just like the SE can only go so far
[1:39:53] on the side of the ocean Banks the moon
[1:39:56] has the ability to say you'll go no
[1:39:58] further I say there's power in The Bride
[1:40:01] of Jesus Christ to look at
[1:40:04] trouble if you're bone of his bone life
[1:40:07] of his life power of his power put those
[1:40:10] Reigns in your
[1:40:13] hands and harness the
[1:40:17] trouble how much has Satan Afflicted
[1:40:19] your family how much has he taken away
[1:40:21] from you I'd say it's time to take it
[1:40:24] back in the name of Jesus Christ you are
[1:40:27] put here because a king a king is a king
[1:40:32] if he's got a kingdom and Jesus spoke
[1:40:36] predominantly about you being a king in
[1:40:39] this age
[1:40:41] right you know that he talked about you
[1:40:44] being a king
[1:40:47] right he talked about you being a king
[1:40:51] he talked about it in Revelations
[1:40:52] chapter 3
[1:40:53] he talked about it in Revelations
[1:40:55] chapter 5 he talked about it in
[1:40:57] Revelations chapter 19 he talked about
[1:41:00] it and he talked predominantly about
[1:41:02] this age that to them that overcometh
[1:41:06] will I grant to sit with me in my Throne
[1:41:10] notice the prophet said and how can I
[1:41:12] overcome he said now he said now when
[1:41:14] Jesus I feel good right
[1:41:17] now he said when he said how can I
[1:41:19] overcome he said he would notice what he
[1:41:21] said he said he didn't say on my Throne
[1:41:24] he said but in my Throne he said when he
[1:41:27] said a king has a domain just like just
[1:41:31] like in John chapter 14 and2 in my
[1:41:34] father's house is many mansions he said
[1:41:37] if you study that back all the way into
[1:41:39] the Greek and the Hebrew he said a man a
[1:41:42] father was over a domain and he had a
[1:41:46] Thousand Acre Farm he said but it wasn't
[1:41:49] called a farm it was called his domain
[1:41:52] and Adam when he was was there in the
[1:41:53] Garden of Eden he was under his domain
[1:41:56] to control the
[1:41:58] powers he controlled the winds he
[1:42:01] controlled the waves he named the tiger
[1:42:04] he named The
[1:42:05] Lion it was under his
[1:42:11] domain at one point brother bam said
[1:42:14] this would choke you to
[1:42:16] death he said but when man fall they
[1:42:19] lost their Dominion he said but in this
[1:42:22] hour
[1:42:23] but in this hour there will be sons and
[1:42:26] daughters that raise up that will
[1:42:28] literally take the very power away from
[1:42:31] Satan and tell him what to do that's why
[1:42:35] the prophet is standing there and he's
[1:42:37] writing down the letter when the spirit
[1:42:39] of God tells him pick up your pen and
[1:42:41] write he said notice the bride and the
[1:42:44] groom are in Perfect Harmony that she
[1:42:47] only does his will she only she only
[1:42:50] operates by the mind of Jesus Christ
[1:42:53] that's why you have the mind of Christ
[1:42:56] you have the ability to operate healing
[1:43:03] right I'm going go farther you and I
[1:43:09] have the ability to Pardon
[1:43:12] sins by the preaching of the Gospel now
[1:43:17] the Catholic the Catholics they they
[1:43:19] they they they what's the word
[1:43:27] Catholics they they turn
[1:43:31] that say it
[1:43:33] again they turned it they they perverted
[1:43:35] it they perverted it and said that they
[1:43:38] had the ability they had the ability to
[1:43:41] remit sins but we realize that there's
[1:43:44] only remission of sins in
[1:43:47] baptism they perverted it but when you
[1:43:50] come under the kingship of a born again
[1:43:53] son and daughter of God the reason why
[1:43:56] you understand the mind of Christ is
[1:43:58] because you've receiv received the mind
[1:44:00] of Christ and the reason why you
[1:44:03] understand like a king is because
[1:44:05] there's a king that is AE over your life
[1:44:09] so every demon every Power every
[1:44:13] sickness is under your domain that's why
[1:44:17] when brother William stood here and he
[1:44:20] talked about a bruised Hill you realize
[1:44:24] that he was talking about you because
[1:44:27] Satan is under your
[1:44:31] feet
[1:44:33] everything
[1:44:36] everything is
[1:44:40] under how many's got a need in their
[1:44:44] body you're a king and a
[1:44:47] priest but you didn't make yourself that
[1:44:50] way he made you that way
[1:44:53] now some of you have got I just be real
[1:44:57] open right here you've got needs in your
[1:44:59] body you've got financial needs you've
[1:45:01] got physical needs you've got spiritual
[1:45:04] needs but he put you here not to be
[1:45:07] ruled by
[1:45:08] Satan but he put you here to rule
[1:45:12] Satan I want to go just I want to bring
[1:45:15] this all the way
[1:45:18] around ever since the Garden of
[1:45:21] Eden God has been demanding a
[1:45:29] king he's looking for a
[1:45:32] housewife to be a king of her
[1:45:36] home to rule her home as a Fifth
[1:45:39] Gospel and when Satan comes in there and
[1:45:43] he afflicts your little children and
[1:45:44] gives them fever give them fever and
[1:45:46] give them gives them flu bugs you have
[1:45:49] the ability as a housewife to make Satan
[1:45:53] obey
[1:45:56] you I believe it's that
[1:45:59] powerful I believe that it was somebody
[1:46:03] that turned loose the supernatural when
[1:46:05] Mariah breit was dealing with alapa and
[1:46:10] somebody took trouble and they harnessed
[1:46:12] it and said we will receive a restored
[1:46:16] Glory I believe it was somebody that was
[1:46:19] sitting in the office of a king
[1:46:23] when Edmund way died right there in the
[1:46:26] prophet's Ministry and the prophet said
[1:46:29] Edmund wake
[1:46:33] up I believe it was somebody under
[1:46:37] kingship when there was a woman that was
[1:46:39] sitting at the back of the building that
[1:46:40] had died in the prophet's message and he
[1:46:43] told Billy Paul go back there and pray
[1:46:45] for he said oh no daddy oh no Daddy I'm
[1:46:48] not going to touch that brother ran him
[1:46:50] all of a sudden and said Mary
[1:46:53] and she snapped back and said what
[1:46:54] brother brandham I believe that he was
[1:46:57] operating under the rulership of a
[1:47:00] kingdom and the kingdom of God is within
[1:47:05] you if you are a king then you have
[1:47:09] access to
[1:47:11] everything in the
[1:47:14] Kingdom then you can tax what you
[1:47:19] want you can tax what you want
[1:47:23] you can take what you want you can give
[1:47:26] what you
[1:47:28] want I'd say it's time that you turn the
[1:47:31] tax back on the devil he robbed you with
[1:47:33] cigarettes he robbed you with alcohol
[1:47:36] now it's time to tax him I get some
[1:47:42] benefits it's time to give it's time to
[1:47:46] give Satan what he's deserving
[1:47:57] I believe Hatty R was operating under
[1:48:01] some
[1:48:02] kingship I believe she recognized that
[1:48:05] was her
[1:48:08] domain she could have had a million
[1:48:10] dollars she could have had whatever she
[1:48:12] wanted
[1:48:14] to but she asked for the most precious
[1:48:18] thing she asked for something that would
[1:48:20] not pass away
[1:48:23] brother mam said he said in this domain
[1:48:26] that you're
[1:48:27] under he said it reaches from eternity
[1:48:30] to
[1:48:37] Eternity brother Doug is
[1:48:41] powerful that when you feel like you had
[1:48:45] failures he didn't see
[1:48:47] failures when you feel like you carried
[1:48:49] some things from your own father he
[1:48:51] didn't see them things
[1:48:54] because your domain and this domain that
[1:48:56] you're under is from eternity to
[1:48:59] Eternity he didn't see your
[1:49:01] faults brother Christian didn't see your
[1:49:03] failures he didn't see your doubts he
[1:49:06] saw your
[1:49:08] faith he saw what he deposited on the
[1:49:11] inside of you
[1:49:22] are we ready I want I want it so loud

[1:54:44] Hallelujah Revelations
[1:54:47] 1911 and I saw heaven open and behold a
[1:54:51] white horse and he that sat upon him was
[1:54:54] called
[1:54:56] faithful and true and
[1:54:59] righteous and he doth judge and make
[1:55:03] war his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[1:55:07] on his head were many crowns and he had
[1:55:11] a name written that no man knew but he
[1:55:13] himself and he was clothed with a
[1:55:15] vesture dipped in
[1:55:16] Blood and his name is called the word of
[1:55:20] God and the armies which were in heaven
[1:55:23] followed him that's
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:35] you that's my
[1:55:38] king and the armies which were in heaven
[1:55:41] followed him upon the white horses
[1:55:44] clothed with fine linen and
[1:55:46] white
[1:55:49] clean you ain't spotted
[1:55:53] you never was
[1:55:55] spotted you were just spotted here but
[1:55:59] in his
[1:56:02] mind
[1:56:04] white and

[1:56:11] say that over your life sister April you
[1:56:12] were white and clean I want you to say
[1:56:16] it so loud till you believe it I'm white
[1:56:19] and I'm clean
[1:56:24] Hallelujah and out of his mouth goeth a
[1:56:26] sharp sword and with it he should Smite
[1:56:29] the Nations and he shall rule them with
[1:56:32] a rod of iron and he treadeth The Wine
[1:56:34] Press of the fearness with the
[1:56:36] fierceness and the Wrath of the almighty
[1:56:38] God and he hath on his vesture and on
[1:56:41] his thigh a name written king of kings
[1:56:45] and Lord of
