[56:47] was on the ark a lot of times with
[56:48] brother brandham
[56:50] so and so there we go and so
[56:57] amen
[56:59] amen I'm going to get there

[57:05] of our
[57:06] hearts amen just hang in there brother
[57:08] Dylan we'll get you baptized after a
[57:10] while and
[57:14] so I thought as the songs were being
[57:16] sang this morning they seem to just line
[57:18] up
[57:20] perfectly and this morning before even
[57:23] getting here I got a note from brother
[57:24] Seth coffee who is young preacher uh
[57:28] those that would know Sister Carla that
[57:30] would be in her family and he sent me a
[57:33] note that he had went through a really
[57:36] bad bout of depression I actually asked
[57:39] him would it be okay to share this with
[57:41] you he went through a bad bout of
[57:44] depression and he was just didn't know
[57:47] how he was going to come out of that he
[57:49] just you know I'm a preacher I shouldn't
[57:51] be going through this and and so he'll
[57:54] be listening to this and so this will
[57:56] help him as well and so he said I
[57:59] shouldn't be going through this I'm a
[58:01] Christian I shouldn't be going through
[58:03] this and brother Andrew had put out a a
[58:06] video and and in the video it was a it
[58:09] was testimonies it was testimonies that
[58:12] we had shared about the fire going
[58:15] through the fire you recently put that
[58:17] out and so and he said there was just
[58:19] one line in there that spoke to him and
[58:22] it said it just boom brought him out of
[58:26] of
[58:28] itah and so he said it just seemed like
[58:32] I was just going on and he
[58:34] said I I just something was holding me
[58:39] and I said well I sent him a text back
[58:40] and I said well that's quite interesting
[58:42] that you would send that this morning
[58:45] because I'm going to speak on what is
[58:48] holding you come on
[58:51] Amen I want you to just think about some
[58:54] things and I'm going to just share a few
[58:56] things before I go
[58:57] forward we are living in extremely
[59:01] Supernatural
[59:03] times brother Brandon would go through
[59:05] some times of when his baby died and the
[59:09] enemy would come to him and begin to
[59:11] talk to him and he said just when I was
[59:14] getting ready to give up something in me
[59:18] amen spoke out 1962 he came to another
[59:23] spot it's a transition of his ministry
[59:25] going from Evangelistic work even into
[59:29] even into prophetic work and he is at a
[59:32] time to where that he wants to get away
[59:34] from the pressures of life and even he
[59:37] was on the trip and I would like to
[59:39] share this at another time if I can in a
[59:41] more emphatic way but he was on the trip
[59:44] with brother bisc and brother bisell had
[59:46] no idea that brother brandham had these
[59:48] thoughts in his mind but he said I
[59:50] wanted to go away and be a
[59:54] Trapper he wanted to get away away from
[59:56] things the pressures of life here we are
[1:00:00] in a very pressurized age and in this
[1:00:05] pressurized age it seems like that Satan
[1:00:08] is using every force factor that he can
[1:00:12] to get into us because he don't have
[1:00:14] much longer to work with you and
[1:00:16] I knowing that you're the final voice to
[1:00:20] the final age and knowing that you're an
[1:00:22] invincible Army and and your position
[1:00:26] right just your position in prayer and
[1:00:29] your position in the body of Christ
[1:00:32] makes you more powerful than any other
[1:00:35] people on the Earth Satan knows that he
[1:00:37] has to use everything that he can to
[1:00:40] bombard your mind and bombard your
[1:00:44] spirit and in he in the spirit he uses
[1:00:47] your imaginations and your conscience
[1:00:50] and your memory and your affections and
[1:00:52] those things and and your imagination he
[1:00:55] goes in there and he begins to work but
[1:00:58] there's a place that he can't get
[1:01:02] to now he can work on your flesh and he
[1:01:05] can work on your spirit but there's a
[1:01:10] place even brother brandham said that
[1:01:12] God and the devil found a place to fight
[1:01:15] at it was in your mind and brother
[1:01:17] Brandon would preach a sermon called the
[1:01:19] greatest battle that's ever
[1:01:22] fought and call it greater than any of
[1:01:25] the other Wars that have ever happened
[1:01:27] but it takes place in your mind that's
[1:01:30] the place that they chose to fight at
[1:01:34] but in your
[1:01:37] soul in your soul is the place that he
[1:01:41] can't get
[1:01:42] to and that's where God placed that seed
[1:01:46] of eternal life down on the inside of
[1:01:53] you and we could sing the song something
[1:01:56] keeps holding me when your flesh and
[1:01:59] your spirit would give
[1:02:02] up it's that seed Gene of life that's
[1:02:05] been predestinated and elected by God
[1:02:10] not by some feebleminded man but by the
[1:02:14] infinite God God chose
[1:02:18] you I want you just think about the
[1:02:21] supernatural things that we're beginning
[1:02:23] to
[1:02:24] watch Maybe in a few
[1:02:28] days tombs from 2,000 years
[1:02:36] ago tombs from 2,000 years
[1:02:40] ago bodies that have went back to the
[1:02:43] gases and the
[1:02:45] ashes that are no longer to be found
[1:02:48] like granulars of
[1:02:51] sand will resurrect
[1:02:57] are you with me now we resurrect and
[1:03:00] step from that Dimension to this
[1:03:05] Dimension I think here's an incredible
[1:03:08] one all of us will be in one
[1:03:16] Accord all of us as a bride will be in
[1:03:19] one
[1:03:21] Accord we'll step into the
[1:03:24] vision so some of us are gray-headed
[1:03:27] some of us wear glasses some of us are
[1:03:30] stoop shouldered but in a
[1:03:33] moment in a moment all the agonies of
[1:03:38] your life will be
[1:03:42] fixed the impossibilities that there's
[1:03:45] no way for you to see in this moment
[1:03:47] everything will be fixed in that moment
[1:03:56] in spite of all the leoy and pressure
[1:03:58] that is around us every force that Satan
[1:04:02] is trying to keep keep you out of your
[1:04:06] position dimensions are
[1:04:08] blending Heaven and Hell Is has has
[1:04:12] loosed its forces upon the
[1:04:15] Earth and you're either influenced from
[1:04:22] Heaven you're either influenced from
[1:04:25] heaven
[1:04:26] or another dimension that would none of
[1:04:28] us want to go
[1:04:30] to and if you haven't had a reason to
[1:04:33] shout yet let me just say if you're
[1:04:35] influenced from Heaven it's a good spot
[1:04:38] to shout
[1:04:46] hallelujah
[1:04:48] hallelujah can I pick up from
[1:04:51] there and he said and when I saw him I
[1:04:55] fell feet is
[1:04:57] dead and he had his right hand upon me
[1:05:00] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[1:05:05] and the
[1:05:09] last I need a bigger book can I borrow
[1:05:12] your
[1:05:19] Bible feel not I am the first and the
[1:05:22] last I am I am he that was dead and
[1:05:25] behold I am alive forever more amen and
[1:05:29] have the keys of hell and of death Mark
[1:05:33] chapter 10 and verse 27 and I've just
[1:05:35] got a several scriptures here and Jesus
[1:05:38] looking upon them said and this is
[1:05:41] incredible scripture especially after
[1:05:43] I've just brought you through what we
[1:05:44] brought you through with
[1:05:48] men it is
[1:05:52] impossible but with God
[1:05:55] With God all
[1:05:59] things are
[1:06:02] possible now just to back that up Luke 1
[1:06:06] and verse 37 says it just almost the
[1:06:09] same way for with
[1:06:12] God
[1:06:15] nothing I want you to put some emphasis
[1:06:17] on that
[1:06:19] nothing
[1:06:21] nothing shall be impossible
[1:06:26] Isaiah chap 53 and verse 1 and it's some
[1:06:30] of our favorite scripture who hath
[1:06:32] believed our report and to whom is the
[1:06:34] arm of the Lord revealed for he shall
[1:06:38] grow up before him as a tender plet as a
[1:06:40] root out a dry ground and he hath no
[1:06:43] form nor cess and when we shall see him
[1:06:45] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:06:47] him notice the scripture he is despised
[1:06:51] and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[1:06:55] a quain with grief and we hid as it were
[1:06:57] our faces from him he was despised and
[1:07:00] we esteemed him not I love this
[1:07:04] part surely he hath borne our
[1:07:07] griefs and carried our sorrows yet we
[1:07:11] did esteem him stricken and smitten of
[1:07:14] God and
[1:07:15] Afflicted what powerful
[1:07:20] scriptures but he was
[1:07:23] wounded read this with me me and he was
[1:07:26] wounded for our
[1:07:29] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:07:32] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:07:35] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:07:42] healed
[1:07:49] Hallelujah I want you to notice that
[1:07:51] scripture it is written in such a
[1:07:55] personal
[1:07:57] away let's read it again and he was
[1:08:00] wounded for
[1:08:03] our he was bruised
[1:08:07] for the chastisement of our peace was
[1:08:10] upon him and with his stripes we
[1:08:18] are there's not a timestamp on that
[1:08:28] so that means that every
[1:08:31] reader amen boy he's here every reader
[1:08:36] when they read that scripture it is
[1:08:39] personal to
[1:08:41] them it came from the prophet's
[1:08:45] lips and it's putting on paper and then
[1:08:49] though it's been there for thousands of
[1:08:53] years it can jump off of the
[1:08:56] page and regardless of your condition of
[1:09:01] sin regardless of your depth of sin
[1:09:05] regardless of your condition of your
[1:09:08] body the same
[1:09:11] blood can take care of that in this

[1:14:52] into Hallelujah and is safe let's read
[1:14:57] it together the name of the Lord is a
[1:15:01] strong tower the righteous run into and
[1:15:05] is
[1:15:07] safe John 7 and verse 38 said he that
[1:15:11] believeth on me as the scripture hath
[1:15:15] said out of his belly shall flow
[1:15:20] rivers of Living Water
[1:15:25] I'd like to just take a few quotes here
[1:15:27] and just drop some things to
[1:15:30] you how did Jesus carry out his
[1:15:35] commission brother BR says in blind
[1:15:37] bardus and this is this is two different
[1:15:40] I've got two different places I'm going
[1:15:41] to pull from Jesus with his head
[1:15:45] back he's walking toward Calvary Jesus
[1:15:49] with his head back walking on the priest
[1:15:53] screaming at him making fun of him
[1:15:56] others crying
[1:15:58] hosana but did you notice the whole
[1:16:02] burden of the whole world rested upon
[1:16:07] Him
[1:16:09] Calvary dark hours in
[1:16:13] Gethsemane and all as he went he never
[1:16:18] noticed their
[1:16:20] scoffing come on
[1:16:25] he's walking toward
[1:16:27] Calvary brother Brandon would just have
[1:16:29] two sentences here I want to catch he
[1:16:32] had something on his
[1:16:34] heart as he's going to
[1:16:37] Calvary the
[1:16:39] decision has been
[1:16:44] made another place brother brandom would
[1:16:47] say and I just want to capture this
[1:16:49] quote he said let's just turn our our
[1:16:52] cameras to another picture
[1:16:55] sometimes I think as brother brandom's
[1:16:56] preaching being a prophet he's looking
[1:16:59] and he's actually preaching to us the
[1:17:01] vision that he's seeing that's
[1:17:05] right he said 4,000 years
[1:17:09] later we're in
[1:17:11] Jerusalem we're at a window and I hear a
[1:17:15] voice I hear a noise what is it a
[1:17:18] screaming mob hollering some poor man
[1:17:21] has come up against it and we'll raise
[1:17:24] up the shade and look out the window
[1:17:26] coming from down the streets there comes
[1:17:28] an Old Rugged
[1:17:30] Cross bouncing over the cobblestones
[1:17:33] bearing rubbing out the bloody
[1:17:35] Footprints of the
[1:17:36] bearer he's going to
[1:17:40] Calvary his back is beaten his ribs is
[1:17:43] showing through
[1:17:44] nurly there he starts up the road
[1:17:47] walking along as he's going look at him
[1:17:50] I look all over his back and there's
[1:17:52] little red spots all over His Garment as
[1:17:56] wo throughout the seam look at those
[1:17:59] little red spots what are they directly
[1:18:04] they're getting bigger and bigger and
[1:18:08] the bigger and the first thing they all
[1:18:11] run into one big
[1:18:18] spot there goes the second
[1:18:22] adom one brought death
[1:18:25] and here he's going one bringing
[1:18:28] life there's the one who took life out
[1:18:30] of the world and here's the one that's
[1:18:32] bringing life back to
[1:18:38] it the second Adam with his own blood
[1:18:42] hidden against his legs like that the
[1:18:44] Son of God going to Calvary to Bear Away
[1:18:47] The Sins
[1:18:49] Yonder and through the shedding of blood
[1:18:52] to perfect man and woman
[1:18:57] unconditionally no man can come to me
[1:19:00] except the father draws him and all that
[1:19:03] comes and I'll give him everlasting life
[1:19:06] and raise him up at the last day oh my
[1:19:10] there it is he's going up there I can
[1:19:12] see his little old bloody and that old
[1:19:15] something stinging around him death
[1:19:18] buzzing at him like a bee as he's going
[1:19:20] Yonder to the crucifix a bee coming
[1:19:24] around him
[1:19:25] saying oh I got you now I got you now
[1:19:31] and as it went moving and moving on that
[1:19:33] little bee was going to sting
[1:19:36] him God himself made flesh in order to
[1:19:41] take away
[1:19:43] sin I don't think we can preach this
[1:19:45] profoundly
[1:19:47] enough he says God the father and the
[1:19:50] spirit could not taste death of course
[1:19:53] he was super
[1:19:55] Supernatural but he had to be be made
[1:19:58] flesh and there he was dragging that
[1:20:01] cross on and that bee stinging around
[1:20:04] him death but you know what insects bees
[1:20:08] you all know that here you raise a lot
[1:20:11] of honey in the in this country and if a
[1:20:13] bee once stings it leaves its
[1:20:18] stinger and it cannot sting no more and
[1:20:21] God himself coming unfolding himself Out
[1:20:25] of Heaven made a flesh in the form of
[1:20:28] man took upon him the form of man and
[1:20:31] was going Yonder to Calvary to Anchor
[1:20:34] that sting of
[1:20:36] death and that sting stung the Son of
[1:20:40] God on the way to Calvary and he
[1:20:43] anchored and he pulled the stinger out
[1:20:45] of
[1:20:47] death and to death today death has no
[1:20:53] stink for
[1:20:57] believer Hallelujah for we are perfected
[1:21:00] in Christ Jesus there's the blood that's
[1:21:05] the blood of Christ and what it
[1:21:08] does the sting of death Paul when he was
[1:21:12] going to chop his head off that old bee
[1:21:15] busing around him and he said death
[1:21:19] worri is your
[1:21:22] stink grave where is your
[1:21:27] Victory but thanks be to God who gives
[1:21:30] us Victory through our Lord Jesus
[1:21:43] Christ brother B said what was
[1:21:45] it he said the Son of God 1900 years
[1:21:50] something ago this
[1:21:52] afternoon he was led from prison
[1:21:55] he was taken to the Judgment
[1:21:58] seat and from there the Hall of
[1:22:01] scourging from there to gol gotha pulled
[1:22:05] upon a
[1:22:06] hill Simon the
[1:22:10] Serene helping him to Bear the cross and
[1:22:15] there died on the Rock of Ages his blood
[1:22:19] beat out of him his body stripped
[1:22:23] Hallelujah great big old gobs of
[1:22:27] mocking of mocking Soldier
[1:22:30] spit upon his
[1:22:33] face and he had said if my kingdom was
[1:22:37] of this
[1:22:38] world I would ask my father and he would
[1:22:42] give me Legions of angels that would
[1:22:45] come and fight for me but this is not my
[1:22:52] kingdom but thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:22:57] done I think this is incredible how
[1:23:00] brother Brandon puts these things
[1:23:02] together and it will be here pretty soon
[1:23:06] thy kingdom come thy will be done now he
[1:23:09] quotes Billy
[1:23:11] Sunday and he said when Billy Sunday
[1:23:13] said one time he says that in every tree
[1:23:17] sat an
[1:23:19] angel and he said he could just pull
[1:23:22] your head hand loose and Point your
[1:23:25] finger that's all you'll have to do
[1:23:28] we'll settle the question down here my
[1:23:32] ain't that the
[1:23:33] truth Angels hanging on every
[1:23:38] tree sometimes we see the the power of
[1:23:40] God in what he says and what he does but
[1:23:43] there's a lot of even more power in what
[1:23:47] he didn't
[1:23:51] do are you with me now what do you mean
[1:23:54] by that that brother Ron he could have
[1:23:55] called 10,000
[1:23:57] angels but you and I would be lost
[1:24:01] today he could have give up but he had a
[1:24:05] commission on his mind he knew he was
[1:24:08] sent here to die for the Redemption of
[1:24:11] me and
[1:24:13] you this was more than a
[1:24:15] king this was more than a great leader
[1:24:19] this was more than a great prophet this
[1:24:21] was God that stepped out of heaven and K
[1:24:24] flesh for me and
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:34] you I shared this with them this
[1:24:38] morning this is something that I just
[1:24:41] just touched my heart I was
[1:24:44] actually I was actually going through
[1:24:47] that Jonesboro where brother Brandon
[1:24:49] prays for that blind girl how many
[1:24:52] reminds that remembers that blind girl
[1:24:58] and she was there and cataracts had
[1:25:00] wrapped around her
[1:25:02] eyes to where she could no longer see
[1:25:05] doctors had let it go too far and
[1:25:07] wrapped around her Optical
[1:25:10] nerves and she was blind they had heard
[1:25:13] about the meeting they had heard about
[1:25:15] other Miracles happening they actually
[1:25:17] rented a bus to be able to come
[1:25:19] there when brother brandham prays for
[1:25:23] her when he prays for her listen there's
[1:25:26] there's thousands of people around that
[1:25:28] don't even know this is happening amen
[1:25:31] and I think that's incredible brother
[1:25:33] random is walking through a parking lot
[1:25:36] and it was a huge place I've been there
[1:25:40] he's walking through this huge Place
[1:25:43] thousands of people is there and brother
[1:25:46] brandom steps through and he steps
[1:25:49] through them all and he finds this black
[1:25:51] girl that is screaming for her daddy
[1:25:55] and she's lost and brother Braham has a
[1:25:57] conversation with her now the meeting's
[1:26:00] going on brother Braham has a
[1:26:02] conversation with her and she's telling
[1:26:05] him that we've come to see the
[1:26:09] Healer see the Healer and and brother
[1:26:12] brandham says that
[1:26:15] that he always told us that he wasn't
[1:26:18] the Healer Jesus Christ was the Healer
[1:26:22] and he's trying to get her to realize
[1:26:24] that Jesus is the Healer and she says
[1:26:27] but I got to get to that man you
[1:26:30] remember when she discovers that this is
[1:26:33] brother brandom that she's talking to
[1:26:35] she grabs him by the lapel of the
[1:26:38] coat and refuses to let him go wouldn't
[1:26:42] you I want to say this to you this is
[1:26:45] her moment I don't know how many years
[1:26:48] she lives but this is her
[1:26:50] moment I want to capture that how many
[1:26:54] real Supernatural moments do we get in
[1:26:58] life don't let it Escape you be
[1:27:01] sensitive to
[1:27:02] it and she grabs him and she holds on to
[1:27:05] him and she makes a statement to him she
[1:27:08] said
[1:27:10] on if you can give me to the Healer I'll
[1:27:14] be able to find my daddy
[1:27:26] listen if you can get me to
[1:27:28] Jesus everything will be all right if
[1:27:32] you can just get me to him preacher if
[1:27:34] you can get me to him he'll fix what I
[1:27:38] need
[1:27:44] fixed we didn't come to see a
[1:27:47] man we didn't come to get under the
[1:27:50] inspiration of a man we come to see
[1:27:53] Jesus
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:28:02] in brother branham's
[1:28:04] prayer he reminds the Lord of
[1:28:08] Simon the
[1:28:12] Serene because he was an Ethiopian man
[1:28:15] he was a black man he had two
[1:28:19] sons and he and he's brother Brandon
[1:28:23] reminds him
[1:28:26] that Simon carried your
[1:28:32] cross and in just a couple of
[1:28:35] moments that which was
[1:28:37] blind is now
[1:28:43] healed I begin to look at Simon Serene
[1:28:47] history has a lot of different things to
[1:28:50] say about
[1:28:51] him he was a man that was literally
[1:28:54] standing in the
[1:28:56] audience you know nothing happens by
[1:29:00] chance with
[1:29:02] God there's nothing happens by
[1:29:06] chance and he's standing in the audience
[1:29:09] and every we cannot even fathom what a
[1:29:13] wild scene that that
[1:29:15] was they were beating Jesus they were
[1:29:20] spitting on him they were mocking him
[1:29:23] they were doing everything that they
[1:29:25] could against
[1:29:27] him he was on a
[1:29:30] mission Thorns were down in his head to
[1:29:33] where that he would have stroke every
[1:29:35] time his heart
[1:29:36] beat blood had filled his eyes and now
[1:29:40] ran over his face was dripping off of
[1:29:42] his
[1:29:45] chin his ribs were
[1:29:49] open you could
[1:29:52] see as they would pull it
[1:29:57] Poli robe off of him his organs were
[1:30:01] beating inside because they had beat him
[1:30:03] in such a horrible
[1:30:07] way and still he's pushing
[1:30:10] on but I want you to just notice this
[1:30:13] man is standing at a very appropriate
[1:30:18] Place God watches over everything
[1:30:24] it's estimated that that cross weighed
[1:30:26] 88
[1:30:28] lbs cuz he's only carrying the
[1:30:31] top 88
[1:30:34] lbs there was no
[1:30:37] way for him to carry that three quarters
[1:30:40] of a mile to where he had to go and so
[1:30:43] they pick a
[1:30:45] man out of the audience to pick that
[1:30:49] up and to walk along theide of our
[1:30:53] savior
[1:30:56] this man will be known through the
[1:31:01] eternities as a man that carried the
[1:31:04] cross with
[1:31:06] Jesus I don't know what it felt like to
[1:31:09] look in his eyes those bloody eyes that
[1:31:12] day but I want you to know this there
[1:31:15] had to be every ounce of courage that he
[1:31:18] could give this Jesus called the
[1:31:21] Christ let's get this job
[1:31:25] done he must have felt the human energy
[1:31:28] and the god
[1:31:30] energy to move one step at a
[1:31:33] time I cannot imagine his anger as a
[1:31:38] man for them to keep pushing Jesus to
[1:31:41] the
[1:31:42] ground and keep spitting on him and keep
[1:31:46] beating him
[1:31:48] am
[1:31:51] amen I found a sentence that made more
[1:31:56] sense to me than ever
[1:31:58] before Jesus couldn't die on the
[1:32:02] road he couldn't die on the road so he
[1:32:05] had to have somebody to carry his
[1:32:08] cross he couldn't die there cuz he had
[1:32:10] to get
[1:32:12] there don't you worry about God's
[1:32:15] Mission being
[1:32:18] accomplished don't worry about you
[1:32:20] thinking what the rapturous way overd
[1:32:22] don't you worry it'll be right on
[1:32:27] [Applause]

[1:34:00] Victory Day brother random says God lets
[1:34:02] disappointments
[1:34:04] happen to show Victory or if we could
[1:34:08] only see that you'd only see that these
[1:34:11] things that seems to be so burying you
[1:34:14] and upsetting you they are
[1:34:17] trials they are things to stand still
[1:34:21] and focus your glasses on the word of
[1:34:23] God and speak the word and this walk
[1:34:26] just walk forward and that's all that
[1:34:29] there is to
[1:34:32] it well brother Ron that's you know that
[1:34:35] must be just for you know you preachers
[1:34:37] don't have any
[1:34:41] trouble well if if you look at it that
[1:34:44] way probably we
[1:34:47] don't or you might all talk to some
[1:34:49] other
[1:34:50] preachers how many remembers the juniper
[1:34:53] tree
[1:34:55] Elijah's juniper
[1:34:58] tree brother Bram said some things here
[1:35:01] and he said men who deal in the
[1:35:04] Supernatural who stay in the presence of
[1:35:07] God when you see God's program turning
[1:35:09] down and you preach it and you just try
[1:35:12] your best and and do everything that God
[1:35:15] tells you to
[1:35:16] do and still they walk away from
[1:35:20] it it's heartbreaking
[1:35:25] and he said talking about Elijah he said
[1:35:29] poor little fella
[1:35:31] skinny laying there with his gray hair
[1:35:34] hanging out over his
[1:35:35] shoulders and God
[1:35:37] said God
[1:35:41] says my servant needs some
[1:35:44] rest think about that my servant needs
[1:35:48] some
[1:35:50] rest God's mercy to his servant
[1:35:54] he just laid him down on the on a bunch
[1:35:56] of weeds and and he went to
[1:36:01] sleep I wish I could put this in picture
[1:36:03] for him for you it's just so beautiful
[1:36:06] he said I'd imagine there was 10,000
[1:36:08] angels watching him
[1:36:11] sleep there's one assurance that the
[1:36:14] believer has though the world turned him
[1:36:17] down yet God loves him the world may
[1:36:21] call you Holy Roller they may call you a
[1:36:24] atic but if you're true to God there's
[1:36:27] one sure thing God loves
[1:36:31] you and his angels are encamped about
[1:36:35] those who fear
[1:36:37] Him I'd imagine on every Lim all around
[1:36:40] through the place was swarms of angels
[1:36:43] and God came down and said my poor tired
[1:36:47] servant he's so nervous and tore up
[1:36:51] and he don't just know what to do I want
[1:36:55] to pick an angel standing here that's
[1:36:57] got the softest
[1:37:01] hands don't you scare him walk over and
[1:37:05] stroke his brow right
[1:37:08] easy and I want the best
[1:37:13] cook I want the best cook among you go
[1:37:17] there and get all the vitamins that you
[1:37:18] can find and and put it in cornmeal
[1:37:24] the world's turned him down but I'm
[1:37:27] going to treat him
[1:37:29] right God's talking to his angels the
[1:37:31] world has turned him down but I'm going
[1:37:34] to treat him
[1:37:38] right Hallelujah that means praise our
[1:37:41] God now now don't get scared of that he
[1:37:46] said bring forth the best that we got
[1:37:49] cook him a corn
[1:37:51] cake and set him down found some
[1:37:54] water and this soft-handed Angel went
[1:37:57] over there and stroked his little
[1:37:59] servant of God on the
[1:38:01] brow and remember if you've done your
[1:38:05] best God still got those
[1:38:08] angels in order he loves to just the
[1:38:11] same as he loves you just the same as he
[1:38:14] did
[1:38:17] Elijah and he stroked his brow and
[1:38:20] Elijah woke up and I may hear him say
[1:38:23] something like this the Lord God who
[1:38:26] loves you you've done your best Elijah
[1:38:29] I'm only sitting here with those signs
[1:38:31] for a witness in that day of judgment
[1:38:34] that they'll have to stand there it
[1:38:36] alone you've done just what you what
[1:38:39] what I told you to do I know you're
[1:38:41] tired and weary now and the Lord God
[1:38:44] creators of heavens and earth have sent
[1:38:47] me to here to feed you this bread and
[1:38:50] this water
[1:38:55] and Elijah rubbing his eyes and raised
[1:38:57] up little old frail shaking hands took a
[1:39:00] hold of bread and ate
[1:39:02] it now notice these words just then the
[1:39:06] great Angelic choir came out formed a
[1:39:10] little panoramic around him like that
[1:39:13] and be to sing the songs like no mother
[1:39:17] could coup to her baby to sleep and let
[1:39:21] him sleep again
[1:39:24] then father uh turned around and said
[1:39:27] you know I love
[1:39:29] him so much the journey is great and
[1:39:33] he's got a lot to go through yet but I'm
[1:39:37] not through with him so I've got to feed
[1:39:39] him
[1:39:41] again and he called the angels and
[1:39:44] dumped in another great big bundle of
[1:39:46] vitamins and and cooked up another great
[1:39:48] big corn cake and set him a cruise of
[1:39:51] water and stroked his brow fed him again
[1:39:53] again I got news for you Elijah was
[1:39:55] tired and wore
[1:39:57] out if you got Angels rubbing your brow
[1:40:00] and cooking you cakes and giving you
[1:40:02] water in the middle of a desert
[1:40:04] spot and then you go back to sleep after
[1:40:07] that you're War
[1:40:13] out and so God did it all over again for
[1:40:16] him well that was Elijah but how many
[1:40:18] times does he do that for
[1:40:20] you he'll refresh you and get you you
[1:40:23] back up and going and then you'll go
[1:40:25] through more battles and he'll come
[1:40:27] right back to you and bless you again
[1:40:29] and bless you again and bless you again
[1:40:32] somebody preach with me
[1:40:41] now these men didn't have Halos over
[1:40:43] their head and wings on their back
[1:40:45] they're humans like you and I they go
[1:40:48] through battles and they go through
[1:40:52] battles may you can't see the angels
[1:40:54] that are attending to you but they
[1:41:01] are he woke up feeling better I would
[1:41:05] too and he went from that spot 40 days
[1:41:10] and 40
[1:41:12] nights now watch what brother Bram does
[1:41:14] with that he said I imagine if there's a
[1:41:18] doctor that's a listen in wouldn't you
[1:41:21] like to know what was in those vitamins
[1:41:25] that they
[1:41:26] used that would keep a man on a corn
[1:41:29] cake and a glass of water for 40 days
[1:41:33] and 40
[1:41:39] nights that's the power of
[1:41:43] God sister Katie yesterday she made us
[1:41:46] some brown beans I'll be honest with you
[1:41:49] probably the best brown beans I've ever
[1:41:51] ate I really mean that that was was just
[1:41:53] really really good and we was just
[1:41:56] missing the corn
[1:42:06] cakes now can I turn her Focus to
[1:42:08] another
[1:42:14] place there was a Believer just like me
[1:42:17] and you called naboth how many remembers
[1:42:21] naboth naboth
[1:42:23] was a descendant of
[1:42:26] Abraham and if you remember when
[1:42:29] MDC was with with
[1:42:32] Abraham the
[1:42:34] king that had no beginning of days or
[1:42:37] ending of nights God God in a theic
[1:42:42] body and he's talking to Abraham about
[1:42:44] his
[1:42:45] children and he says thy seed shall
[1:42:48] possess the gates of their enemy so that
[1:42:51] means that they're going to have some
[1:42:52] Wars
[1:42:54] they're going to have some real
[1:42:56] battles and
[1:42:58] so as he's talking to him Abraham
[1:43:01] couldn't see one
[1:43:05] child you see Abraham couldn't see
[1:43:08] himself like God could see
[1:43:12] Abraham just the same way you
[1:43:15] are you're an invincible Army you're the
[1:43:17] final voice you're just hours
[1:43:21] before before the coming of the
[1:43:27] Lord God's time you're just only just a
[1:43:30] few minutes
[1:43:33] away so don't get in no go don't go get
[1:43:36] in no great big
[1:43:37] hurry but you see naboth owned a piece
[1:43:40] of property that Ahab
[1:43:44] wanted naboth's property was given to
[1:43:47] him by
[1:43:49] God are you with me and listen listen
[1:43:53] even the boundaries were laid out and
[1:43:55] they were given to him by
[1:43:57] God and
[1:43:59] so he was taken care of his Vineyard and
[1:44:02] he had a beautiful
[1:44:04] Vineyard and this Vineyard was so
[1:44:09] perfect and so wonderful that the king
[1:44:11] wanted
[1:44:13] it the king Ahab wanted it and Jezebel
[1:44:16] wanted it and so Ahab had a desire that
[1:44:20] he could have that and Neo refused to
[1:44:23] give the message
[1:44:28] up he said God gave me this message it
[1:44:31] was given by an angel from God it was in
[1:44:35] my family's Heritage and I refused to
[1:44:38] give an inch of this message
[1:44:41] up from the boundary of deity of Jesus
[1:44:45] Christ all the way to communion I'll not
[1:44:49] give it
[1:44:51] up I may not understand it all but I
[1:44:54] believe
[1:45:03] it he doesn't ask us to understand it he
[1:45:06] just ask us do you believe it and I say
[1:45:09] I believe
[1:45:11] [Applause]
[1:45:16] it
[1:45:20] so Ahab wants this piece of property and
[1:45:23] I'm just going to because it's a long
[1:45:24] time and and I'm running out of
[1:45:26] minutes and
[1:45:28] Ahab you know he goes in and he's cing
[1:45:33] he's all upset he's having a horrible
[1:45:37] time brother brandham said that he laid
[1:45:40] his head in je Jezebel's
[1:45:42] lap and she said as she stroked his head
[1:45:47] I'll get it for
[1:45:51] you I'll get it for for you don't you
[1:45:54] worry Ahab I'll get it for you and she
[1:45:58] devised a
[1:46:01] plan to cause men to create a lie to
[1:46:04] take it away from him his property away
[1:46:07] from him now I want you to understand
[1:46:10] that that this was property given by
[1:46:16] God if the enemy comes on your property
[1:46:19] the devil is going to answer for it
[1:46:26] listen if you're sitting here with
[1:46:28] cancer or whatever disease don't you
[1:46:31] worry one little
[1:46:34] Iota the devil is going to answer for it
[1:46:38] if these caus broken bones or broken
[1:46:41] hips or broken whatever and you're
[1:46:43] suffering let me just say don't you
[1:46:45] worry little bride the devil is going to
[1:46:49] answer for that
[1:46:58] now let me just share this quote I it's
[1:47:01] just too good and if if I go over time
[1:47:03] you get paid extra
[1:47:07] anyway we find out that
[1:47:10] Micaiah Micaiah was God's
[1:47:13] Prophet said he examined and he knowed
[1:47:15] what God had said through the real
[1:47:18] prophet and the prophet before him what
[1:47:21] did he say he said this Ahab because
[1:47:26] you've shed the blood of
[1:47:29] righteous the blood of the righteous
[1:47:33] nabo the dogs will lick the
[1:47:38] blood also and
[1:47:42] Jezebel and that's just exactly had to
[1:47:45] come to pass be because God had said how
[1:47:48] that that Prophet prophesied good when
[1:47:51] evil was against
[1:47:53] it are you with me now are you with me
[1:47:58] how can I tell this leot toan church
[1:48:00] ages the good things when God has spoken
[1:48:03] against it you're naked you're miserable
[1:48:07] and you say I'm rich I have better I
[1:48:09] have churches like the methodists and
[1:48:11] the Baptist and the Presbyterians I have
[1:48:13] this I have that the best that there is
[1:48:16] and that's right but don't you know
[1:48:19] you're naked and miserable and blind
[1:48:23] to the real thing that God has
[1:48:24] manifested it'll go right through you
[1:48:27] like the moving right right out people
[1:48:31] be believe people before it's too
[1:48:36] late now I want you to just watch
[1:48:43] this Ahab and Jezebel they have 400
[1:48:48] prophets and they create a Great
[1:48:51] Horn and they come out there and they're
[1:48:54] all prophesying one
[1:48:58] voice they're all prophesying one voice
[1:49:03] go on Up And Take
[1:49:05] It Go On Up And Take It Go on up and
[1:49:09] take it but
[1:49:11] Jehoshaphat brother say was a
[1:49:15] Pentecostal said he was a Pentecostal he
[1:49:18] said don't you have one more 400 but
[1:49:21] don't you have one more more he said yes
[1:49:24] sir we do but I hate
[1:49:30] him I imagine they hated brother brandom
[1:49:32] in this day as
[1:49:34] well I imagine that's what a lot of them
[1:49:36] would say well you know we we got all
[1:49:38] this Unity amongst us and brother
[1:49:40] brandom's calling us blind naked and
[1:49:42] miserable and poor the the World Council
[1:49:45] of churches and we're hooked to the
[1:49:47] and I I imagine they they
[1:49:49] absolutely boycotted these meetings I'm
[1:49:51] getting ready to go to Saskatoon
[1:49:53] I'm going to stay right across when
[1:49:55] brother where brother brandham stayed
[1:49:57] literally right across the road from
[1:49:59] Brother brandham state do you know that
[1:50:01] those sorry outfit
[1:50:06] Preachers did the same thing that they
[1:50:08] did right here in Harrisonburg they told
[1:50:11] their people not to go to the meeting
[1:50:12] but they
[1:50:16] went bunch of sorry outfits they held
[1:50:19] their people away
[1:50:24] are you with me that's why brother
[1:50:27] brandom would say the disappointments at
[1:50:29] the judgment will not be the
[1:50:31] drunk will not be the Harlot but it'll
[1:50:35] be against those preachers that withheld
[1:50:38] the
[1:50:39] truth many of them know the truth but
[1:50:43] because of their pocketbook let me
[1:50:49] preach but because of their position
[1:50:59] brother Ron will withhold your check
[1:51:01] keep
[1:51:04] it just go on and keep it I'm not here
[1:51:07] for your money no
[1:51:08] way I'm here for your
[1:51:11] soul and I here with a vision to get you
[1:51:14] from here to there to preach this
[1:51:17] message that's got Rapture in it
[1:51:34] they went up there and talked to M
[1:51:36] Micaiah they warned him what he had to
[1:51:38] say what he
[1:51:41] would you know what Micaiah did he went
[1:51:43] up there and blessed them they
[1:51:46] knew they knew when he blessed them this
[1:51:50] wasn't right
[1:51:52] this wasn't right can you imagine
[1:51:55] brother Bram said go ahead you know God
[1:51:58] loves you a bunch of
[1:51:59] Jezebels
[1:52:02] on God loves your pant wearing he loves
[1:52:05] your sissified
[1:52:08] men they had to know something ain't
[1:52:11] right with this picture that's what we
[1:52:14] preach but that ain't what you
[1:52:18] preach come on you bet might as well
[1:52:20] amen you're on the right side
[1:52:25] he said go on
[1:52:27] up go on
[1:52:29] up something ain't right something ain't
[1:52:32] right and then he broke into the where
[1:52:34] he was he saw the vision of the word
[1:52:37] Micaiah said I saw God sitting upon the
[1:52:40] throne and he called all the delegates
[1:52:42] of Heaven said who can go down there and
[1:52:45] deceive
[1:52:47] Ahab watch what he says and one lying
[1:52:51] spirit came up and fell before God a
[1:52:57] liar and said Remember the that lion
[1:53:00] spirit that got into those
[1:53:04] prophets I got a couple things to do
[1:53:06] with so don't get done with me he said
[1:53:08] they ought to have known then that the
[1:53:11] spirit was on him wasn't according to
[1:53:14] the word of God but they were so carried
[1:53:17] away because everything they everything
[1:53:20] that Kings and the prophets that they
[1:53:21] said was everything was fine and that's
[1:53:24] what the church has done today yes
[1:53:27] they've got away from oldfashioned
[1:53:30] experience you had years and when you
[1:53:32] stood in the street in a corner and
[1:53:34] preached the gospel and said come out of
[1:53:36] those denominations and call yourself a
[1:53:38] pre free people nay because you've
[1:53:41] wrapped in it again like a hog to the
[1:53:46] wall now can you imagine God doesn't
[1:53:49] send an
[1:53:50] angel to get on those 400
[1:53:53] Men He causes a Lon
[1:53:58] spirit let me just say something to you
[1:54:01] right
[1:54:03] here in our political
[1:54:07] system God's Got A
[1:54:12] Plan there's a pope let me go here
[1:54:14] before you get too mad there's a pope
[1:54:16] setting in
[1:54:17] Rome that seems like a very innocent
[1:54:21] human being right
[1:54:23] that kisses babies and rubs them on the
[1:54:25] head and makes all good kind of
[1:54:27] statements to say but one day there's a
[1:54:30] spirit from hell that's going to come on

[1:55:09] him are you with me it don't have to be
[1:55:11] that
[1:55:13] way it don't have to be that
[1:55:15] way in brother Danny steeman Church
[1:55:18] there was a beautiful woman she's an
[1:55:19] older woman and I don't remember
[1:55:22] remember her name
[1:55:25] today but she played in some of the
[1:55:27] movies with Elvis
[1:55:30] Presley and she had she had gained that
[1:55:33] kind of a
[1:55:34] Fame I sat across the table we talked
[1:55:37] about it and I I asked her I said what
[1:55:40] made you leave she said when they wanted
[1:55:42] to take my me to take my clothes off she
[1:55:46] said I'm going home to
[1:55:49] Mama and she walked out of Hollywood let
[1:55:52] me just say this to you God paid the
[1:55:55] debt now I'm bringing it to an end God
[1:55:58] paid her
[1:55:59] debt listen she didn't die no pulper she
[1:56:03] married an incredible
[1:56:05] man incredible man listen and listen she
[1:56:11] came to the message of the hour notice
[1:56:15] the protection of
[1:56:18] God some of you little ladies here that
[1:56:21] was in the world God watched over
[1:56:25] you and maybe you would have even chose
[1:56:28] to win a different way and that's the
[1:56:29] way you was going but the seed that was
[1:56:32] within
[1:56:34] you is what held
[1:56:40] you maybe he wasn't raised in the
[1:56:43] message how did you get here I'll tell
[1:56:45] you God brought you here
[1:56:55] and if I could say this if God watched
[1:56:58] over you
[1:56:59] then all through your
[1:57:05] journey I can say a million things right
[1:57:08] here but if God watched over you
[1:57:11] then when you had no knowledge of who
[1:57:13] was watching over
[1:57:17] you well let's just go ahead if you
[1:57:19] thought you'd send away your day of
[1:57:21] Grace and there was something still
[1:57:23] pulling on
[1:57:25] you how will I ever get back how will I
[1:57:28] ever get
[1:57:29] [Applause]
[1:57:49] back some of your old books
[1:57:52] was
[1:57:56] stinkers I'm coming to an
[1:57:58] end brother
[1:58:01] Dylan what in is important in your
[1:58:05] life is not what took place in the old
[1:58:08] book that's
[1:58:10] right can everybody stay with me just
[1:58:12] for a
[1:58:16] moment what is important in your life is
[1:58:18] not in the old
[1:58:19] book you as a man
[1:58:23] human
[1:58:24] being live in the same house that the
[1:58:27] old king lived in your
[1:58:31] memory will always be
[1:58:34] there but the seeds that you sowed
[1:58:38] bad they will come up but you sow enough
[1:58:42] good seeds to choke those seeds out
[1:58:48] [Applause]
[1:59:01] brother Jason would you stand just now
[1:59:04] yeah right
[1:59:08] there he had a really bad old
[1:59:11] book and you probably know some of his
[1:59:14] story but 99% of this audience doesn't
[1:59:18] know Jason's old story that's right and
[1:59:21] neither does he need to share it with
[1:59:25] them he did his time and that Jason is
[1:59:30] over
[1:59:39] with
[1:59:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:56] Satan May war with you what you used to
[1:59:58] be but you constantly remind him that's
[2:00:02] the old guy that used to live here I
[2:00:05] don't take his
[2:00:10] mail
[2:00:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:15] [Applause]
[2:00:30] give me just one or two more minutes you
[2:00:32] can be seated just a
[2:00:34] moment I'm I'm just going to preach to
[2:00:37] you is that all right because I'm
[2:00:40] actually preaching to Mary sitting right
[2:00:42] behind
[2:00:43] you and I'm preaching to
[2:00:50] you you came with him
[2:00:53] what two or three years ago first time
[2:00:55] you'd ever been here but something got a
[2:00:58] hold to
[2:00:59] you and you only come with
[2:01:02] him because he was he was with you and
[2:01:05] he brought you
[2:01:07] here since that service you have hardly
[2:01:11] missed one service you've been
[2:01:14] here I want to ask you what held
[2:01:19] you you couldn't hold yourself
[2:01:23] God held
[2:01:26] you what held
[2:01:28] you it's the same thing that held
[2:01:31] Jesus as a man that caused him to keep
[2:01:35] taking one step at a
[2:01:37] time it was the same thing that held
[2:01:40] Elijah under a juniper tree when he was
[2:01:43] ready to give up it's the same thing
[2:01:46] that held
[2:01:47] nabbo that said God gave me this
[2:01:50] property and I refuse to give
[2:02:03] up but maybe sister Kimberly would ask
[2:02:05] the question but he died you're not
[2:02:09] reading the rest of the
[2:02:11] chapter it's not written there but
[2:02:14] listen he stepped from this Dimension to
[2:02:16] that
[2:02:18] Dimension he never lost an inch of his
[2:02:21] property
[2:02:22] [Applause]
[2:02:24] if I die
[2:02:27] today I'll be more alive there than I am
[2:02:30] here
[2:02:31] [Applause]
[2:02:58] about two months ago I'm preaching
[2:03:01] here and then I'm
[2:03:05] done I'm preaching here I'm full blast
[2:03:07] in the
[2:03:08] service and I'm
[2:03:12] preaching and all of a sudden God speaks
[2:03:15] to me and says call Katie and Hunter
[2:03:19] down to have prayer for them and for
[2:03:22] that
[2:03:26] baby Quinn has been under doctor's cares
[2:03:30] and they've did a phenomenal job with
[2:03:32] him but Hunter and
[2:03:34] Katie which you sometimes don't realize
[2:03:38] it was in a service like
[2:03:42] this in the middle of a
[2:03:44] sermon that God just said just a moment
[2:03:49] I got a case that I've been working on
[2:03:51] and I want them to know I'm working on
[2:03:53] the
[2:03:54] case they don't know what's laying ahead
[2:03:57] but I want to give them confidence and
[2:04:01] courage they're going to be days and
[2:04:03] weeks under doctor's care but the great
[2:04:06] Physicians telling them I got this
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:22] there are sometimes that a service is
[2:04:25] more than a
[2:04:29] service
[2:04:32] amen
[2:04:34] amen can we just bow our heads a
[2:04:48] moment now God just didn't direct me to
[2:04:50] preach this sermon like this just to
[2:04:53] leave it
[2:04:55] done but I want to ask
[2:04:58] you who in this building has been going
[2:05:01] through
[2:05:02] Wars the last couple of
[2:05:05] weeks yes thank

[2:05:25] going to have angels to rub your head
[2:05:28] and I'm going to give you corn cakes
[2:05:29] that'll sustain

[2:24:35] water W he can save your soul if you
[2:24:40] give him control get ready for that
[2:24:45] judment
[2:24:47] day I said let's all go down to the
[2:24:53] river oh there's a
[2:24:55] man walking on the
[2:25:00] water where he can save your
[2:25:03] soul you give him
[2:25:06] control get ready for that judement
[2:25:10] [Music]
[2:25:27] our God is a faithful
[2:25:29] God he is mighty to be
[2:25:32] praised the Bible tells us in in Matthew
[2:25:35] chapter 28 that Jesus told us to go
[2:25:38] therefore and to teach All Nations
[2:25:40] baptizing them in the name of the father
[2:25:42] Son and the Holy Ghost and Peter grabbed
[2:25:45] the revelation of that and stood there
[2:25:47] on the day of Pentecost and said
[2:25:50] Brethren they asked him said men and
[2:25:52] Brethren what shall we do he said repent
[2:25:55] in the name of Jesus Christ be baptized
[2:25:57] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:25:58] remissions of your sins and you shall
[2:26:00] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:03] there's a lot of people that do not
[2:26:04] believe that God still gives a holy
[2:26:06] ghost but Peter stood there on that day
[2:26:09] as as the leader on the apostolic age he
[2:26:12] stood there and said and This Promise is
[2:26:14] unto you and to them as many as our Lord
[2:26:18] Our God shall call amen if you wouldn't
[2:26:21] mind just flashing up Romans chapter
[2:26:34] 6 verse one
[2:26:39] please what shall we say then shall we
[2:26:43] continue in sin that Grace May abound
[2:26:45] God forbid how shall we how shall we
[2:26:49] that are dead to sin Liv in any longer
[2:26:50] therein know ye not that as many of you
[2:26:54] as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[2:26:56] baptized into his death therefore we are
[2:26:59] buried with him by baptism into death
[2:27:02] that like as Christ was raised up from
[2:27:05] the dead by the glory of the father even
[2:27:07] so we also should walk in a newness of
[2:27:10] life for if we have been planted
[2:27:13] together in the likeness of his death we
[2:27:15] shall be also in the likeness of his
[2:27:19] resurrection this last verse knowing
[2:27:21] this that our old man is crucified with
[2:27:24] him that the body of sin might be
[2:27:27] destroyed that henceforth that we should
[2:27:30] not serve
[2:27:31] sin for he that is dead that's right is
[2:27:35] freed from
[2:27:46] sin just just forgive me a little bit
[2:27:49] about this just for I'm I'm super
[2:27:51] excited about this moment I woke up
[2:27:52] praying about these
[2:27:54] things several years ago probably five
[2:27:57] or six years ago you brought brother
[2:27:59] Dylan to our home and brother Dylan was
[2:28:01] in a bad place and we watched the Lord
[2:28:05] completely take a man that was that was
[2:28:07] strung out on drugs in that moment and
[2:28:09] clear him up clear him up in a matter of
[2:28:12] seconds but Dylan went back to those
[2:28:14] things again but this time it's
[2:28:17] different that's
[2:28:19] right for he that is dead is free from
[2:28:23] sin the old man has
[2:28:27] died that uh that quotation from the
[2:28:30] fourth seal
[2:28:32] sister you forgive me we got some we got
[2:28:35] some demons to bury here you can't have
[2:28:38] a resurrection you must be crucified to
[2:28:41] the things of the world in order to be
[2:28:43] resurrected in Christ and if you're
[2:28:45] going to depend upon your intellectual
[2:28:48] conceptions and so forth you'll never be
[2:28:50] born of the spirit of God you've got to
[2:28:52] forget like Paul did and all that ever
[2:28:55] know and know nothing among you except
[2:28:57] Christ Jesus born a new of fresh oh if I
[2:29:01] could get if I could get it to you see
[2:29:03] it's it's a birth that makes a new
[2:29:07] generation or a new creation the G very
[2:29:10] Greek word here as I was looking it up
[2:29:14] in the Greek Lexicon the other day the
[2:29:16] word birth means creation when it says
[2:29:20] you are a new creatures in Christ Jesus
[2:29:22] there's a word there creature is the
[2:29:25] word creation you are a new
[2:29:28] creation in the world but in in Christ
[2:29:31] Jesus you've been born a new that was
[2:29:33] from question and answer so let me have
[2:29:35] uh from the fourth seal let me why why
[2:29:38] we got that scripture why we got that
[2:29:40] quotation there that's what the Bible
[2:29:42] said in 2 Corinthians 5: 17 that if any
[2:29:45] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[2:29:47] the old things are passed away brother
[2:29:50] David Pierce was was when he first gave
[2:29:52] his heart to the Lord he came here he
[2:29:55] was he was shung out he was he was an
[2:29:57] alcoholic and he was he was he was a man
[2:30:00] that had been ever since he was 13 years
[2:30:01] old that was drinking liquor ever since
[2:30:03] he started from those days
[2:30:06] on but he had a he had a little app on
[2:30:08] his phone and he was looking at it and
[2:30:11] he was walking back he was walking back
[2:30:13] to the liquor
[2:30:15] store and while he's walking back to the
[2:30:17] liquor store it pops up on his phone if
[2:30:20] any man be in be in Christ he is a new
[2:30:23] creature he said it's over that's the
[2:30:25] last time he ever touched it ever
[2:30:34] again this is exactly what brother Ron
[2:30:37] was preaching today that's what the
[2:30:39] blood of Jesus Christ does to the true
[2:30:42] child of God when the confess when they
[2:30:45] when he confesses that sin and stands
[2:30:47] there justified in his mercy and his
[2:30:49] goodness
[2:30:50] even if it's great till God said I can't
[2:30:53] even remember it anymore and he's
[2:30:56] absolutely my
[2:30:59] son verily I say unto you if you say to
[2:31:03] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[2:31:05] in your heart but believe in what you
[2:31:07] have said it shall come to pass you can
[2:31:10] have that what you said you are redeemed
[2:31:12] son amen that's true I've seen squirrels
[2:31:16] to appear Yonder in the six different
[2:31:18] times that I knew
[2:31:20] one that would be sitting here just as
[2:31:23] he can create squirrels the same as he
[2:31:25] can create flies or frogs or anything
[2:31:27] else he's God the Creator right and when
[2:31:31] no mortal being but when that sin of
[2:31:34] that mortal is confessed and dropped
[2:31:36] into the Clorox of the bleach of Jesus
[2:31:39] Christ that bleaches all sin that he's
[2:31:43] purely that he is purely that he is
[2:31:48] purely I got to find he is purely
[2:31:51] unadulterated without sin without fault
[2:31:54] he that is born of God does not commit
[2:31:58] sin for he cannot sin well you see how
[2:32:02] is that possible because the Bible said
[2:32:04] in 1 John 3 and9 for he cannot commit
[2:32:08] sin for the seed of God remaineth in him
[2:32:11] it ain't brother Shannon seed it's God's
[2:32:14] seed that dwells on the inside of him
[2:32:16] the old man is dead that's right and if
[2:32:19] anybody comes up from your past you just
[2:32:21] telling them the old Dylan ain't here no
[2:32:23] more that's
[2:32:24] right for I am alive in Jesus
[2:32:31] Christ oh yeah the bleach stands between
[2:32:35] him and God how could it ever got there
[2:32:38] when it breaks it up and sends it right
[2:32:40] back to the one who perverted amen woo I
[2:32:43] feel religious I tell you I get
[2:32:45] stimulation now as it begins to reveal
[2:32:48] so when he confessed his his sins it
[2:32:51] ain't his sins no more it goes back upon
[2:32:54] the head of the one that perverted it
[2:32:56] from the very beginning that's why Satan
[2:32:59] tried his very best to keep him from
[2:33:01] getting here it's because he didn't want
[2:33:03] him confessing and all the things that
[2:33:05] he ever was are over and back upon the
[2:33:09] head of Satan now the blood of Jesus
[2:33:12] Christ makes Dylan shifflet a Brand New
[2:33:15] Man in Christ Jesus
[2:33:29] today it is my
[2:33:31] honor to bury brother Dylan
[2:33:34] shifflet from this day forth you will
[2:33:37] never never remember him as the man that
[2:33:40] was but you will remember him as the man
[2:33:43] that Jesus Christ is going to make him
[2:33:47] remember this
[2:33:48] day brother

[2:34:15] the rest of your world that what Christ
[2:34:18] has already begun a good work in you and
[2:34:20] he will finish it now God gave us a
[2:34:23] promise that if we repent of our sins
[2:34:26] that word means to turn away to never go
[2:34:29] back
[2:34:30] to for the remissions of our sins that
[2:34:33] he would give us the Holy Ghost you have
[2:34:35] repented you've asked for forgiveness
[2:34:38] now our Lord Jesus Christ is standing

[2:35:09] one Jesus Christ and I ask that the
[2:35:12] anointed one would come here today as I
[2:35:14] get ready to bury brother Dylan shifflet
[2:35:17] in this watery grave I pray pray father
[2:35:20] that you would raise him up to walk in a
[2:35:22] newness of life and I pray God as I
[2:35:25] stand here in this water I pray that you
[2:35:27] would forgive him and that you would
[2:35:29] feel him from the crown of his head to
[2:35:31] the souls of his feet may he may you
[2:35:34] raise him up to be a witness of the holy
[2:35:36] spirit that God still changes and
[2:35:39] delivers and sets free so father
[2:35:41] according to Thy word where you told us
