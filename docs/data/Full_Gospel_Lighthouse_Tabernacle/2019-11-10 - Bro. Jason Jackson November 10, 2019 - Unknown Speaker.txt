you give them strength we pray bless the brother bran and sister Connie Lord in the ministry here and the songs enough everything that's been said and done tonight Lord has been for your glory not for a man to take honor Lord but it's been all about you and father we welcome you into this place now may you have the preeminence and this sermon we pray for it's in Jesus Christ's name a man and a man you love the Lord Jesus this evening a man good to see you sister Mary I was told you were hearing me and sister Mary's knowed each other ever since we were little kids so we grew up at the same place in the same church and and so we we have a lot of a lot of memories and a lot of things in common as far as that goes and we're certainly you tell brother Chris I said hello if you would please if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to turn to the First Samuel chapter 17 and while you're turning I'd like to kind of stay along the same direction from last night maybe and we know that in the writers revival we're gonna have to fight for it it's not just given to you on a silver platter so to speak but you gotta fight you've got something to do because we're in the greatest battle that's ever been fought is right now there is even two forces tonight working in this building and in your mind and this is your time to decide who's gonna win the battle amen there's gonna be a showdown there's gonna be those who's going to oppose the bride's revival there's gonna be some that don't understand they were maybe born back years ago maybe they've not caught up with the revelation of the hour or whatever it may be but there's gonna be some who's gonna try to stop it but what God has started no man can put it out amen you please bear with me tonight is you bout cause me to lose my voice last night and I thank you for that because it was such a privilege to preach to you it and we'll blame it on the weather First Samuel chapter 17 verse 44 and the Philistine said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh into the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field then David said to the Philistine David's going to speak now comes to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou hast defiled and this day well the Lord delivered thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the carcass carcasses of the air of the hosts of the four listening this day unto the fowls of the air into the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly this is you shall know that the Lord save it not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and He will give it unto your hands may the Lord that is blessing this evening you can be seated this is where the rubber meets the road this is a great showdown that's happening we can look at it as well it was just a Bible story of David and Goliath but it's more than just a Bible story this is something that is happening in our time right now there is a showdown there is a battle for what is right and what is wrong there is a battle for this brides revival that we Abed him and David said this battle is the Lord's battle it wasn't David's but I don't even though David could say this day I will smite thee and the Lord will deliver thee into my hand now we can learn a lot from this passage of Scripture if we would study it because we will learn that Satan is always a boaster he's always throwing out boast and he's always telling you how good he is and how strong he is and is always telling you how a weak you are how I'm worthy you are how worthless you are but let me just tell you something when the enemy comes and begins to tell you how worthless you are and how useless you are you need to tell the devil I must be a threat to you otherwise you wouldn't be telling me these things and rest assured if the devil's got his mouth moving he's lying to you there will be a lie come from somewhere when he speaks to you I might as well get rid of this I ain't been able to preacher pulling those on but maybe once or twice in my life and tonight ain't gonna be the night he also be better than the Lord side he wants to always put you down he wants to always beat you down but that's when you must have confidence in who you are you have been preached who have been told by for a weeks now from brother Andrew I had no idea what brother Andrew had been preaching on Eagles and and upon your anointing and how you were placed in things but God has a way of orchestrating things and God is able to orchestrate things so that you would be able to have confidence and who you are to be prepared for the battle that lays ahead so Satan wants to be a boaster he wants to have a better Kingdom than that of my colon and we know that he was cast down out of heaven he took a lot of the Angels with him and he started building his own kingdom well we could preach on that for a while kingdom builders such as Absalom that's a whole no this message such as stay over but Goliath now he exhibited the very characteristics of his master David exhibited a very characteristics of his master you will exhibit the very characteristics of your master whoever you service who you will exhibit the character richness of if you serve the Lord listen you can't serve both God and man you have to choose you this day whom you're gonna serve you either serve God or the devil cuz there's two forces doesn't come together tonight but I said how do you know two forces come together cuz you came here I came here God come here and the devil come here and the devil is one of the most faithful members of gospel life Tanner I'll just tell you I'll include my church he's the most faithful member to Christian Tabernacles ooo he's there every time the doors are open you rest assured he's gonna be there and he's here right now and right now he's warring and some of our minds he's a week we got battles going over thinking about what school we're gonna do tomorrow we're thinking about what we went through last week and God trying to get us the night to rise above what we have been living in and later Asiya he's trying to get our attention on the heavenlies that's why he sent you a bride revival that's why the prophet of god told us in the last days that a revival would come but it would be after the opening of the word and he said it'll be a quick short work I believe that's what's happening now we don't understand necessarily what the quicksort work of me or how how long it'll be because in the mind of God and God's time things are a lot different than our time but we do realize that we're in a battle right now what actually inspired this thought is when I watch sister Elena's testimony I watch part of it and she read the quote out of the greatest battle ever fault and she sit and she read this quote Satan's following you along that great big kingly priestly Goliath trying to scare the lever out of you he's right but God see the devil can put forth his most brother album but God said God said there's going to be a mighty or me God said you're going to be an invincible ornament God said you're gonna overcook God said these things and if God said it gotta back it up if you'd allow me just Kelly lady just a little bit of a foundation here about Goliath we want to size up our enemy let's look just for a moment at how big Goliath actually was from the measurements in the scripture he would have been conservatively nine foot three inches tall that's conservatively the average male in America is five foot ten hey tall her new buddy your compared to Goliath and your tall boy now the size of his armor says was it costed coke weight five thousand shekels of bronze he carried a spear or javelin that and that was as thick as a Weaver's being which would have been about two or two-and-a-half inches in diameter the kind of spear he had was made of iron and weighed six hundred shouts now I safe to say that Goliath his protective coating in u.s. pounds was somewhere between seventy eight pounds and 156 pounds they have a couple different estimates of what it actually weigh you imagine putting on the coat of seventy six pounds you gotta be a man just carry it now David's wanting to go up against this man and David was but a ruddy little feather he wasn't very big at home but learners match when God is in it the length of a spear was said to have been 26 feet two and a half inches around 26 feet long that head alone weight 17 pounds now he appeared to be an invincible army he appeared to be greater than God's God's man he appeared to be greater than God's people because God's people are scared of him but when David went in before Saul Saul said David here's what you've got to do you've got to put my armor oh then if I gotta put your armor oh wait you the one out there if your armor can protect me yellow body we don't know actually if David said that but it probably went through his mind in him it would have went through mine why don't you go do it well puts it on him weights him down he says you know what there's one thing about your armor it's not been proven your armors not been proven but let me just give you just a little bit of background Oh King Saul lived forever let me give you what happened one time a bear came out and another time a line come out and I feel fortified behind what I have it might not look like much but I have confidence listen oh brother Jason all we have is the Bible let me tell you it's not just the Bible it is the infallible Word of God it'll hear whatever devil that there's ever been ever David Power has to bow to the name of Jesus and you're fortified this evening with the gospel and behind the word of truth helmet our salvation the shield of faith the sword waving in your hand now Satan I'm coming to meet you nothing else has been proven but the word you know this brother branham when he goes to battle he's he's in meetings it was always the word that he had to lean on you can't lean upon a man you can't lean upon a gift you have to lean upon the word the word will never let you down relevance and Ruffini all the words of a man a man's words will fail you but God's words cannot fail us you meet me in the name of science and culture and everything else but David said I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel I'm coming after you huh everything has to give way to the name of Jesus brother I'm said death can't stand and I can't even stay there he said Satan's army brings in diseases and God's army is commissioned to cast them out every time Satan throws anything on you God's army is the cast him out what are we out of fear cast him out as the very technique God used only Satan's army uses destruction discord one-sided situations and he's there to destroy your confidence he's there to destroy your mind he's there to destroy everything in his but let me just ask you when the devil got into heaven and reasoning coming up here and all the things that happen what happened to him God cast him out once you expect us to do when he comes into our mind when he comes into me just bringing reason and doubt and discord and unbelief you are commissioned by God that I start taking away from you you don't have to live without say listen you don't have to live defeated you'll have to live oppress and depressed it you don't have to live with anxiety cast out all waste cast down the sin program says this he says your Buffett resurrected in Christ Jesus sitting in heavenly places and every devil is under your foot and he goes and if he starts to stick his head back up and then it went what dot dot dot I guess they didn't get it rest on the tape so I'm gonna put something there okay all right stop his head back down oh don't let him get it up stop it back now you have that commission or whatever demon power under your feet you have that authority you have that power land within you nothing is greater than you are because the work is on the inside of you you're dead in your life is hitting Christ oh god you're dead to your senses your daddy your conscience you have to be dead to your own human will dad the reason dad to everything and then you're buried with him and wherever he is there you are also so when a doubter comes into your mind do not entertain him I had somebody asked me though they should listen I had some bad thoughts come through my mind I thought surely with the Holy Ghost those thoughts wouldn't come through my mind I said the Holy Ghost don't keep the thoughts from coming do you mine but the Holy Ghost only inside of you will keep the thoughts from setting up a nest in your mind you don't have to let it put roots there you can't repel came for the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee why are you gonna resist him with the word resisting with a word get behind middle you're defeated ya liar keep resisting him buddy the only he has to that's the God's Word and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shook who is his soldiers your soldiers listen these are God's generals but you are just as important because what good would they be without you and where would you be with a live how could you hear unless he sent a preacher and how could he be reach unless he be sent and how could he be sell unless he be called a God blessed God has sent you a card called management in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up certain I read the scripture last night run this quoting it now it wouldn't harm if they lay hands on the sick and they shall recover RAM says he goes dim when the enemy comes in like a flood as he is today what did God say to do about it he said the Spirit of God would raise up a standard against it Oh Jason that standards the Bible I'll go with that standard - but brother Ben stops and he asked the question and he says are you one of them are you a standard you are to be able to stand up for another believer northern able to stand up for each other listen you are kings and priests unto God and a priest as an intercessor so you are to be able to go to battle for one another will the brothers down in battle pick him up [Applause] we're told in James 4:7 is I just quote resist the devil and he will flee you gotta hold him off by the word you can't hold him off by your intellectual thinking well if I could just think hard enough and I could stand on the word when all hell's against you stand on the word magician but I just love the presence of God hey I love the presence of God - I'm just gonna ask you if you ever been in a drought though you're been in a spiritual drought you're praying pray and pray seems like they're bouncing off the ceiling lord waeng my prayers they are but God's trying you so he ain't left you during those times there are those times where you think there's only one set of footprints and that's all you can see that wasn't your footprints that was gone carrying you God was picking you up and taking you through those piles and taking you through those times hallelujah he's the chief captain he's told us how to handle the word he's told us how to line up with his word well sometimes we see a child get attacked with a my goodness how brave that devil is will he attack Jesus Christ and he come to him with three attacks then just got ones I'm saying the taxi you don't just attack you once he'll come again and again and if you get the chance he'll just keep coming ro Graham said he'll attack you with a disease certain it'll be there and he'll come right back and say but the days of miracles are past you know and if God cared about you you wouldn't be in this condition well you know sometimes God allows things that happen to us just so he can get a testimony because how would you know I was a healer if he never let you get sick brother nd you are know how to experience the healing power of God from cancer fear not allowed you to get cancer now you can testify to somebody else brother hell he never want to let you have cancer and not be able to still you heal your heart disease he's that same Lord Jesus listen if God C Smith the healing God can do the healing [Applause] he comes at Jesus three times just be ready for it huh and then on the third attack he comes with unbelief in God's Word but I'm calling a wild attack he made on him and Jesus was the word Satan didn't believe for when he come to him he goes if thou be the Son of God he had a doubt there that he was the son of God but when he come in there I said if thou be the Son of God let me see a miracle happen let me just say something I can't produce miracles brother drew can't produce miracles brother Branham couldn't produce miracles Jesus Christ even in his own humanity could not perform a miracle until he first saw the father do it man cannot make these things happen it has to be the power of a living Lord Jesus and if Jesus was the word and he attacked the word bro Tom said Satan flew in there like a pair of stormtrooper fooling their own Jesus like he said like that and Jesus took the word and slashed him to pieces with it and he say it's Retton and Jesus said but it's also written cause Jesus knew where to take him in the word that would counteract Satan's attack and he defeated him with the word you're never going to defeat the devil with a reforming program Christian comedians supposed to be Christian in here John Christie maybe follow him please don't raise your hand I hope you don't raise it after what he made it to last week supposed to be a Christian but here he is he comes out and he's he's forced relationships he's cheated with married women he has completely destroyed the confidence that anybody had any oh yeah he's publicly come down and confessed it but look at the damage that's already been done and now in the day of social media he's toasted and he's trying to get therapy and well that's fine but therapy won't fix his problem I sink in last night if I could only talk to the man not that I could personally help him but I can take him the war that could help I can listen I'm not degrading the man for falling and failing and you can't expect no more doubt of somebody that don't have the Holy Ghost but we have the Holy Ghost today if I could party to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would change his very desire he may want to fight the devil with if he could taste this Brides revival I think of the time brother Roman said if I could have just got to Marilyn Monroe but a satan can get us to disbelieve our weapon satan can get you to disbelieve your weapon he's already got you defeated and listen but greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world so you had to rise up above it and listen some things we're gonna battle complexes in our life that's part of this big old kingly priestly coward and the devil who put complexes I brother branham suffered with a complex he even admitted to it and he called out brother way and he said brother way had a complex and he resented what just now he resented what brother Brahim said because he thought brother Branham was just being mean to him and arrogant and brother branham was only trying to help him and he dropped dead and then he went back her and raised him from the dead and asked God to have mercy and God raised the man back up again see he's a merciful God so when we make mistakes and when we do falter and fail let's run the Father Lord I've made a mistake God I need your mayor say listen God didn't call you here just to live defeated lives God called you here to be overcomers cuz he said blessed is he who overcomes somebody's gonna overcome I was listening to the I was reading the marriage of the lamb on the airplane coming over here brother mem said somebody's gonna have to overcome and don't expect God to push you through a pipe and pull you out on the other side cause that ain't overcoming bro listen I just want God to set me free and deliver me program said you have something to do you quit it kind of like the little in do you know he quacks up her he puts his peace pipe on the offer on the table didn't feel right because God didn't need his peace by know if people take cigarettes and put them on the platform thing gut don't need your cigarettes God don't smoke God needs you and until you're ready to put you on the altar then there what's the use of it and here's a little Indian he finally just lay himself up that right here I am take me that's why God is looking for tonight here's some people who live with herself on the altar of going Lord use me Lord speak through me Lord kidney victory and let the mind that was in Christ be also in me stay with the word he said stay with the word and he defeated the enemy every listen down brother I'm says when the enemy attacks tries to say to you you got to do this that and what are you going to do stay with the word that's right what are you gonna do then take the word what is the word the Bible say have we just read it for the Spirit of God is the word so you look here and take the helmet of salvation in the sword the sword of the Spirit what's the spirit that comes through your mind comes in through your mind enters into you and the sword of the Spirit is the word and what does that spirit fight with what does the Holy Spirit fight with he said sensations feeling the word the word he said Oh glory glory it fights there's what I like how he said it it fights with the healing word he fights with the healing word he said his word and he healed the people glory to God how am I ever gonna overcome it's gonna take the healing word for you to be able to overcome by not come in and heal your scars God come in and deliver your complexes God come in and change your life oh brother Jason you just don't understand all the problems I got I bet your pastor does I don't cuz I don't really I know a lot of your names and some of you personally but I don't know I don't live here and they don't tell me what to preach and they don't tell me what your problems are so I have no idea I like it that way you know I had a man maybe he'll watch this and you'll get rebuked for it so he asked me one time he said anything special you want me to preach on anybody you need me to hit G no more knowing than that I probably shoulda preached that Wednesday night listen Church we have to get past our faults and our failures we have to get past those busy playing games we need a god who's real we need a God who deserves our faults in our hearts come on tell you what the devil will make you a picture he'll make you he'll make you an offer he'll want to make you an offer I've had plenty of offers from the devil and they looked pretty good and then I had to step back and God but is that what he wants me to do I want to be in this perfect will I want to know that I know that I know that I'm doing what God wants me to do I don't want to do what Jason wants to do we have to get past those things we have to take the Word of God with a strong head of faith the two-engine sword and stand there and fight your enemy he said you take the sword let the spirit come to your heart open up your mind save thy Word is truth and he says and you do this Sister Sister on the front you do this sister they were this truth Lord ain't gonna pay any attention how I feel or what anybody else says I ain't gonna pay no attention to it but the doctor said but the doctor said but God said by His stripes you're already healed listen he doesn't pay the price for everything at Calvary don't let the devil take him back and give you something back again that God has delivered you over cuz I'm here I can tell you once he takes it from you and you let it come back it's a whole lot harder to get rid of that's exactly right he says Oh Lord you come down you've made me a free moral agent you are my son and he said all right I open up my heart and mind come in Lord Jesus and grab the faith the sword of the Spirit thus set the Lord and scream hallelujah amen don't feel like it I'm just telling you what he said you scream hallelujah amen then cut down every enemy that's in front of you cut every enemy that old spooky feeling spirit made you feel cutting away with the word our strength is the joy of the Lord is my strength get away from me I'm lacking and cut him with a word and he said and if he don't leave the first time keep walking take the word keep chipping keep chopping how many devil the feeders do we have in here how many serpent bruisers so you know who you are there so you are know then when the devil comes against you that's God the preacher didn't shake my hand brother Ron don't never have no time for me you're not acting like an eagle ah [Music] cousin Eagles gonna fly above it well a brother on will just take an hour out of every day and talk to me on the phone I can overcome you got the answer already ain't happen he wasn't called to be a babysitter called to be a servant of God call only be a devil to feeder how to be a circuit bruiser and if he's got a constantly baby said how can he do what not call him to do I sure hope that ain't been happening here but let me tell you when God calls a man he equips a man he retains a man are we royal seeds of Abraham or are we just issued a seat huh listen Church we've been in the message now some of us for 50 or 60 years we ought to be grown up we ought to be mature Eagles by now we're already able to soar in the heavenlies by now we are now being stuck down here still yet the horn well you know I just don't really know if brother Branham was a prophet or if you're only to that base you're missing a whole on life you're missing all the message because the message wasn't just God sent a prophet we thank God for sending Malachi for we thank God for that but the Prophet had a message and his intention was for you eat let's to get the message you're anointed you called for this very day in our muscle problems prayer he says Lord we know we're at the end time and the people need straps Satan's charging handle and I'm putting the Word of God in their hands right now in their hearts we defeat Satan with this word come out of these people in the name of Jesus Christ relations I wasn't in that service I was I was there you're not old enough to be their brother BAM but no not to be with George Washington when he crossed the Delaware either but he was there haha I was there in his mind I remember bro many thought somebody went beyond the curtain of time and he's seen all the millions of believers there and he come back to the tabernacle and he said I've seen every what have you though were there he saw me I know people that were sitting in that service comes whole hallelujah I'm gonna make it now huh I can't miss a program saw me there well just because you're 80 years old and you were sitting in the meeting don't mean that because I'm 42 I couldn't be there too but because he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not a respected person if he loved one you'll love the other if you meet God on the same ground listen Church you've not have know how to fight this devil he wants to tell you you're worthless he wants to tell you you're not good enough well devil I just know who i am i am the predestinated church in the last days i know that the seed has been planted on the inside of me i know that i'm in a holy spirit filled Church and i know i'm a seed sowed by the word of god and brother Ram says be careful Singh be careful why is he telling me to be careful because you recognized who you were you caught the revelation this isn't just Malachi for Malachi warhead and Luke had Luke's child movement and revelations 10 verses 8 through 11 then he was preaching knew there had to be some John stuff Ruben said John is surprised type you had to come honestly you have to take the books you have to eat the book you have to be comfortable this word has to be your life this is your revival hallelujah we're devil defeat or serpent bruisers devil don't have nothing over a child of God he don't have the upper hand even though he has studied us for 6,000 years you would think by now he'd know how to handle somebody that's filled with the Spirit of God now brother I've said he's had 6,000 years to study man and he knows her weaknesses and he knows her failures but for some reason he keeps missing the power in the blood he keeps me sent missing that the Holy Ghost is greater than what he is he keeps missing these things therefore he keeps attacking you and if you let him attack you he'll keep attacking you but somebody has to stand up my David and say enough is enough today I cover the name of the Lord today I'll cut your head off be careful saying you've actually just now got something to really praise god about you thought you had something to praise him about when you come to Pentecost or badness or whatever you might be you felt a sensation God changed your life you were happy right but now you really got something to praise God about it's much deeper than that now it's much deeper than just emotions you know we love emotions brother and said something without emotions is dead it ought to be buried but the thing is it goes much deeper now because now you have been anointed in this hour to be a giant slayer you've been anointed in this hour to pull your sword and to cut down every Goliath of depression ever Goliath of anxiety every Goliath that would come in your way you have and getting a charge and David said the panel is the Lord's and David didn't stop right there and he said and the Lord has given it into our hands so you've been equipped to defeat to death you know you as I said you got something to actually praise God for now I'm just going to when I grew up most of my life you could ask sister Mary Jane this they wasn't a whole lot they wouldn't none of this that was taboo she's back her laughing she knows it's true she's praying you don't put the camera on her we were told what I need don't need your props brother brems said I can't preach without brother I was getting something out of the service to that woman started screaming and then I couldn't get nothing out of your preaching if you shoot cold shivers all down my spine he said honey I can't preach without that happened I can't priests well I had I'm saying a man of the word listen church you have something to praise him about how because you've been given the full revelation now Loretta car I had a preacher tell me one time you said brother man may never move more than three foot away from this desk huh he was making recordings he couldn't get away from it except that that preacher didn't happen to be in Birmingham Alabama when brother Branham preached spiritual amnesia and my uncle happened to be there and he said for the whole service brother Branham paste the platform which was about 50 foot wide dragging this corded mic with him brutes and spiritual amnesia and it doesn't really matter if brother Branham did that or not every move through four three feet away it doesn't matter every gift is different we're not the pattern or live or different after the prophet of God there was one of those to an age we understand those things deep said well we don't need all this clapping they didn't clapping brother brems meekness what you didn't listen to enough tapes yet cuz I hear them when I'm pretty sure he probably wouldn't at the Baptist Church weren't even when they clap but he was probably over at the Pentecostal side over the same leezar over at the Church of the heart or something and when brother man would get preaching he'd say some boy they just go to clapping like crazy now go yeah what's gonna do with this tape but let's just give him the benefit of the devil let's just say they didn't clap they didn't shout and they didn't get happy let's look at the setting brother Branham was preaching it he was not preaching to believers like we have the opportunity to he's preaching to a group of people and there may be five out of a thousand that believe just what he's preaching and some of them may not really believe some of them might have just been along for the loaves and the fishes so they say you was right on that part that they didn't clap or nothing in the church but now they let me tell you when the word is being preached to believers today they have the freedom we're in crisis made me free there is Liberty I have the freedom the priests gone like our water praise God don't tell me I can't worship God I have a full seven-course menu for the seals have been revealed I got something to praise him about brother Branham was preaching the national rings and Baptists and pilgrims home with us they didn't understand what he was preaching about but I do I do so now the majority of the people we listen to preach to today the majority of them are profess to be believers well let's just go back and give those unbelievers just one tape the third seal bromance preaching the third seal and he gets down there or touch not they all in the one and he says well the oil is a type of the Holy Spirit and the lines are type of stimulation and all of a sudden you hear the crowd begin to erupt and relabel said that's what I'm talking about right there they got stimulated on the line and all of the Holy Ghost that's what we get stimulated oh it ain't because the music's beating cuz ain't no music right now you don't have to have say that's what they

fight with now you've been given a tour you've been given the Holy Ghost by your side [Applause] let me tell you something Nevel I Bandon we abandoned we ain't bowing worthy ACK [Applause] where's that devil app bring it here let me let him come to me and meet me face to face oh no he's a coward he'll hide behind the guard hides behind their great big thick seventy-six pound coat hides behind fix me up done got to while waist I kept my circle and you're thankful you get to a ballgame you know what yes this is the greatest time that you'll ever have while you're here on earth it's not washing them throw their God down a field with a football but when I see somebody take the old leather back book and me getting to open the Bible and find the word apart but what he said about me he said about me I told my Terps at home so don't tell me how to listen Paul said I wasn't my God in the way that's called heresy well Jason you just get too wild thank you that's a compliment well you pace across the platform my grandpa did that it's hereditary come from good genes oh he was a he was a Christian he was saved you know I mean he wasn't something he went some way they tried to live something that he was I never got the opportunity to meet him just hear the stories of my dad and him talk about him but he was a real man of God just like you are just like your pastor is just like your sister pastor but you know what that would make brother Ron happy because you love his son how much more ordered make God happy when we have loved one for the other when were able to look above the faults and failures of one another and somebody rise up listen I've had people get up might years ago they give Church run Nihon singles but do you know how they live did you see if they talk to Jesus or not you wouldn't in the room you wouldn't in their life I don't care what a person has been [Applause] Church is a place for healing church is a place for surgery church is a place for transformation to take place and if you don't create an atmosphere how's that ego ever gonna give birth [Applause] Oh Jason I I just think we oughta have things a little more quiet go ahead and preached about you last night intellectual theologians who only want to teach never have a power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost my Bible said there's all five of the gifts are to be in the body of Christ so if there's something that's teachers god bless them we have to have teachers but none say they positionally place you into the body but you also gotta have a gospel preacher that can preach the power of God so slow till it will deliver people while they're setting interviews listen if you ain't gotta if you ain't got that kind of ministry coming through or here something's wrong with the church I preached this a couple of weeks ago myself so you know what the five ministering gifts along with the nine spiritual gifts I'm putting the church to keep the church clean people get scared of them because they might get exposed well be like David be a man after God's own heart when your stands reveal with that it's pretty simple repent repent and come back to God there is a merciful God listen to me church tonight we we have something to praise him for now we have something to rejoice it because David said the battle is given to you and now he sees pulling me down now he's getting down to the rubber me Saru now he's facing the Goliath glasses come on boy you want some of this boy baby looks at me cuz you know I ain't afraid of you I got faith I got grace I got Jesus Christ women ain't afraid he picks up five smooth stones brother Timothy just was recently your to go in at that brook and he picked up some smooth stones and he'd give me one of them and it was as smooth as it could be but it was in the shape of a triangle I thought that's pretty good free sharp punch whatever it might have been but he went loose of that stone it wasn't David strapped that place the rock there it was the God whom he had faith in and it ain't it ain't all your power it's the God and whom you have faith in the knife then I give you ever desire of your heart that'll rapture you out of here someday it's in hope listen you believe in God believe also with me for in my father's house are many mansions if it was not so I would have told you but I go to prepare a place I don't parachute here in a minute so be ready God says I'm coming to give you victory in this hour you have been called to be victorious you have not been called God called us in this hour to
