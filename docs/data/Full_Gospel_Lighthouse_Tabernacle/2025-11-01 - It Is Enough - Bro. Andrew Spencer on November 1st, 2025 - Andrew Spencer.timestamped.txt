[17:31] want to hear us come to you and talk to
[17:33] you, Lord. and not just some simple
[17:35] prayer that we would just ask you of
[17:36] things but Lord to [music] be able to
[17:38] thank you for the blessings and thank
[17:39] you for the opportunities that you have
[17:41] given us in this life and great friends
[17:43] and great fellowship Lord great great
[17:45] pastors Lord a building that we could
[17:47] [music] come to and Lord as we say that
[17:49] we just we we could just feel for the
[17:51] believers in Jamaica the ones that
[17:52] [music] Lord they would go through such
[17:54] turmoil and a storm this week and they
[17:56] would see just properties and their
[17:58] buildings destroyed and but Lord Jesus
[18:00] we're so thankful that the [music]
[18:02] reports have came that no lives would be
[18:03] lost. And for my knowledge, Lord, and
[18:06] Lord, any injuries or anything that
[18:07] [music] would come from that, Lord, we
[18:08] just we just pray that they would just
[18:10] be able to feel the prayers from around
[18:12] the world that would just go and [music]
[18:13] be there with them. And Lord Jesus, you
[18:15] saw the storms before it would get
[18:16] there. And Lord Jesus, we know that when
[18:18] you bring storms, [music] it's it's to
[18:20] be able to bring us closer to you. And
[18:22] those storms do nothing but strengthen
[18:24] us, Lord. And we [music] know that Paul
[18:25] would say that we would be grateful in
[18:27] the trials and grateful in the in the
[18:28] test, Lord. and each and everything that
[18:30] we would go through. I would just pray
[18:32] that we would be able to see you in it
[18:33] and be able to give you all the glory
[18:34] and praise [music] back. And Lord, we're
[18:36] so thankful to be able to see our
[18:38] pastors back home and be able to hear
[18:40] the great miracles and great testimonies
[18:42] of what they brought overseas. And Lord,
[18:44] I just ask that you would just bless
[18:46] them for going and going and being there
[18:48] with the people. And we recognize that
[18:50] it is a bride not just here in Elton,
[18:51] Virginia, but it's a bride all around
[18:53] the world. And we need to stand together
[18:55] like never before and be able to put our
[18:57] arms together and be able to walk
[18:58] because [music] there is great darkness.
[19:00] But Lord Jesus, you've given us a light.
[19:02] You've given us a light to be able to
[19:03] spread to the world and allow those that
[19:06] may not be believers be able to see that
[19:07] there is still God on this earth [music]
[19:09] and they they can reach out to us and be
[19:11] able to ask for a prayer in need. Lord,

[19:16] would just bring forth the word. Be with
[19:18] him and ignite the words and inspire him
[19:20] to be able to just bring the word to
[19:22] draw us higher to you. Be there with
[19:24] Matt as he's at home. I believe that you
[19:25] could just touch his back [music] right
[19:26] where he is at. And we just thank you
[19:28] for all that you are doing. In Jesus
[19:30] name we pray. Amen.

[19:44] know, there's a verse in this that
[19:45] [music] says just a few more weary days.
[19:48] But I heard the words of a prophet and
[19:49] he told me never to let my testimony
[19:51] [music] be negative. So I'm not claiming
[19:54] any weary days. Just a few more
[19:57] victorious days. How about that? Amen.
[20:00] Some glad morning [singing] when this

[25:51] surprise
[25:54] and [music] he brought [singing] me to
[25:57] my knees
[25:59] when God [singing]
[26:00] ran. [music]
[26:06] I [singing] was so ashamed
[26:09] all [music] alone [singing] and so far
[26:13] away.
[26:15] [music]
[26:17] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[26:17] &gt;&gt; And now I know
[26:21] he's been waiting [singing]
[26:23] for this day. [music]
[26:28] I saw him run [singing]
[26:30] to me. He took me [music] in his arms
[26:34] and my head to his chest. Said
[26:37] [music and singing] my son come home
[26:39] again. Lifted my face. wiped the
[26:43] [music and singing] tears from my eyes.
[26:45] With forgiveness in his voice, I felt
[26:49] his love for [music] me again. He ran to
[26:53] me. He took me in his arms, [singing]
[26:57] held my head [music] to his chest, sent
[27:00] my son, [singing] come home again,
[27:03] lifted my face, wiped
[27:05] [music and singing] the tears from my
[27:07] eyes with forgiveness in his voice. He
[27:11] said [singing] son.
[27:16] He [music] called me [singing] son.
[27:22] He [singing] said, "Son, you know I
[27:25] still love you."
[27:31] He read to me. [singing]
[27:36] [music]
[27:42] I saw him run [music] to me.
[27:53] And then I read to him
[28:00] [music]
[28:02] when
[28:04] God
[28:06] re
[28:16] [applause]
[28:49] is the [music and singing] face that I
[28:51] see in the mirror.
[28:55] The [music] one I [singing] want others
[28:58] to see.
[29:01] You [music] are showing [singing] the
[29:03] way that I walk in my life.
[29:07] The love [music and singing] that you've
[29:09] given to me.
[29:13] My heart desires [music and singing]
[29:15] to be like you.
[29:19] In all that [music and singing] I do,
[29:21] all I am.
[29:26] Do they [music and singing] see Jesus
[29:29] in me?
[29:32] Do [music] they [singing] recognize
[29:35] your face?
[29:37] Do [music] I communicate
[29:40] [singing]
[29:41] your love
[29:43] and your [music]
[29:45] grace?
[29:49] Do I [singing] reflect who [music] you
[29:52] are
[29:55] in the [singing] way I choose to be?
[30:00] Do [music] they see Jesus
[30:04] Jesus [singing and music]
[30:06] in me?
[30:10] [music]
[30:12] Well, it's amazing that you'd ever use
[30:16] me,
[30:18] but use me the [singing] way [music] you
[30:21] will.
[30:23] Help me to hold out a heart [music] of
[30:27] compassionate
[30:28] grace,
[30:30] a heart that [music] your spirit
[30:32] [singing] fills.
[30:35] May I [music] show forgiveness and mercy
[30:41] the [music] same way you've shown
[30:43] [singing] it to me?
[30:49] Do they [music and singing] see Jesus
[30:52] in me?
[30:55] Do they [singing]
[30:56] recognize [music]
[30:58] your face?
[31:00] Do [singing] I communicate
[31:03] your [music] love
[31:06] and your grace?
[31:10] [music]
[31:11] Do I reflect who [music and singing]
[31:15] you are
[31:18] in the way I choose to be?
[31:23] Do [music] they see Jesus [singing]
[31:27] Jesus
[31:29] in me? [singing]
[31:32] [music]
[31:35] Now I want [music] to show all the world
[31:39] that you are
[31:41] the reason [music and singing] I live
[31:44] and breathe.
[31:47] Do [music] you be the one [singing]
[31:49] that they see
[31:52] when they see me? [music]
[31:57] Do [singing] they see Jesus
[32:01] in me? [music]
[32:03] Do they recognize
[32:06] your face?
[32:09] Do I [singing and music]
[32:10] communicate
[32:12] your love
[32:15] and your grace?
[32:20] Do [music] I [singing] reflect who you
[32:24] are?
[32:26] In the [music] way I choose to be.
[32:32] Do they [singing] see [music] Jesus?
[32:36] Jesus
[32:38] in me.
[32:46] [applause]
[32:48] [music]
[32:49] My Jesus
[32:53] my [music] savior. [singing]
[32:57] Lord, there is none like you
[33:04] all [singing] of my [music] days.
[33:08] I [singing] want to praise
[33:12] [music] the wonders of your might.
[33:26] My [music]
[33:27] [singing] comfort,
[33:31] my shelter,
[33:35] tower [singing]
[33:36] of reuge.
[33:40] [music]
[33:42] Let [singing] every breath this your
[33:44] prayer.
[33:47] All that I am
[33:52] never [singing] cease [music] to work.
[33:57] Shout to [music] him.
[34:03] Shout to [singing]
[34:04] the Lord [music]
[34:06] all the earth. Let us sing.
[34:12] [music]
[34:13] Power [singing]
[34:14] and might
[34:17] praise [music] the king.
[34:22] Mountains [singing] bow down and the sea
[34:28] will roar
[34:30] at the [music] sound
[34:34] of [singing]
[34:35] your name.
[34:38] [music]
[34:40] Oh, I sing [singing] for joy at the work
[34:45] [music]
[34:46] of your hand.
[34:49] Forever I love. [music and singing]
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Forever
[34:55] I stand.
[34:59] Nothing [music and singing]
[35:00] compares
[35:02] to the pro.
[35:13] Little girl was [singing] lying there.
[35:16] Yes, he do.
[35:18] Little girl was lying there.
[35:22] People all were weeping.
[35:27] They just laughed at Jesus when she said
[35:32] she's only.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; When he took her by [singing]
[35:39] the hand,
[35:42] she began to [music] live again.
[35:47] Some begin to praise the [singing] Lord.
[35:51] Some [music] begin to say,
[35:55] [singing]
[35:57] "He's in [music] the house.
[36:02] Death has to flee. [singing]
[36:06] Now there is not
[36:11] where [music and singing] darkness used
[36:13] to be.
[36:16] Now [music and singing] there is hope.
[36:21] There's [music] no more doubt.
[36:25] Oh, praise [singing]
[36:27] his name.
[36:30] Praise in the house. Is this your story?
[36:34] [music]
[36:38] I was like that little girl [music]
[36:42] dead.
[36:45] How many thankful that touch till Jesus
[36:48] [music] touched [singing] this heart of
[36:50] mine and gave me life?
[36:55] [music]
[36:57] I am just a house of pl glory. But
[37:01] [music] ever since [singing]
[37:03] that blessed day,
[37:06] there's a light that shines in me for
[37:10] all [music] the world [singing]
[37:12] to see.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:23] [music]
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, now [singing] there is
[37:29] where darkness [music] used to be.
[37:34] Oh, now there is hope.
[37:39] Oh, there's [music and singing] no more
[37:41] now.
[37:43] Oh, praise [music] his [singing] name
[37:48] for He's in the house. Let's sing it one
[37:52] more time. He's [music] in the [singing]
[37:55] house.
[37:57] Oh, death [music] has to flee.
[38:03] Oh, now there is light [music]
[38:07] where darkness used to be. [music]
[38:12] Oh, now there is hope.
[38:17] Oh, there's [music]
[38:18] no more doubt.
[38:22] Let's praise [music]
[38:23] his name.
[38:27] He's [music] in the house. [singing]
[38:31] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap,
[38:34] an offering unto the Lord. Amen.
[38:37] [applause and music]
[38:39] It's wonderful when he's in the house.
[38:44] Amen. I'm just reminded of that
[38:46] scripture. When they heard [music] that
[38:48] Jesus was in the house, when it was
[38:51] noise that Jesus was in the house, my
[38:54] things started to happen and things
[38:55] started changing. It matters whose house
[38:58] he's living in. Amen. Amen. And God
[39:01] bless you tonight. It's good to be in
[39:03] the house of the [music] Lord with you
[39:04] and happy to be back from happy to be
[39:07] back from the other side of the world
[39:09] and uh we had a wonderful time and I
[39:11] bring greetings from the believers there
[39:13] in Poland and we were able to go and be
[39:15] a part of those dedication meetings and
[39:17] the Lord certainly blessed us and just a
[39:20] fine fine group of believers there and
[39:23] uh they appreciate it. they appreciated
[39:25] you uh loaning us this past weekend
[39:28] there to be a part of those meetings and
[39:30] the Lord blessed us in a a bountiful way
[39:33] and so Amen. It's wonderful to go but
[39:36] it's even wonderfully even greater to
[39:38] come back. So Amen. There's nothing like
[39:41] the presence of the Lord. Amen. Amen. If
[39:44] you have your Bibles tonight, we look
[39:46] over in the book of Revelations chapter
[39:47] 22 and verse 17.
[39:50] There's many things that we could say
[39:53] about our experiences there in Poland
[39:55] and maybe the Lord will give us space at
[39:59] some point to tell some of those things.
[40:02] and just a just a wonderful time and the
[40:05] believers did a wonderful job with the
[40:07] with the church building that they have
[40:09] there that they created a church and we
[40:12] were part of that at full gospel
[40:14] lighthouse and just so thankful uh I was
[40:17] able to go and uh experience uh the
[40:21] concentration camp of Ashawitz there and
[40:24] there's nothing um easy about that but
[40:27] it was a great experience um it was an
[40:29] overwhelming experience and let me say
[40:31] it like that. And just to think that the
[40:34] same night that the same night that
[40:36] Israel got back into their homeland and
[40:38] became a nation, you your prophet was
[40:42] meeting an angel of the Lord. And it's a
[40:44] signal to us that we're we're right
[40:46] where we need to be at. Amen. Amen.
[40:49] Revelations chapter 22 and verse 17.
[40:53] And the spirit and the bride say come.
[40:57] And let him that heareth say come. and
[40:59] let him that is a thirst come. And
[41:02] whosoever will, let him take the water
[41:05] of life freely. For I testify unto every
[41:08] man that heareth the words of the
[41:10] prophecy of this book. If any man shall
[41:13] add unto these words, God shall add unto
[41:15] him the plagues that are written in this
[41:18] book. And if any man shall take away
[41:20] from the words of this book of this
[41:23] prophecy, God shall take away his part
[41:26] of the book of life and out of the holy
[41:29] city and from the things which are
[41:31] written in this book. Also Hebrews
[41:34] chapter 6 and verse 13.
[41:38] [snorts]
[41:44] Certainly want to be remembering brother
[41:46] Matthew tonight.
[41:50] He he he and brother William did a
[41:52] phenomenal job last weekend. Just a
[41:54] phenomenal job. [applause]
[41:58] I I so proud I so proud of them and
[42:02] they just they just a wonder we have a
[42:04] wonderful team of ministry here at Full
[42:06] Gospel Lighthouse and he was able to
[42:08] minister. He actually had to go to the
[42:10] ER last week just in so such bad pain
[42:13] and and but he was able to minister
[42:15] through it and then um then we had quite
[42:18] a bit of work this past week and
[42:20] slinging some wheels in his back just in
[42:22] bad shape. So just praying the Lord
[42:24] touch him abundantly and and uh I
[42:27] believe he's more than able. I woke up
[42:30] this morning just uh
[42:32] this sermon might not be for nobody
[42:34] here, but I just thinking, Lord, maybe
[42:36] this is for somebody out there on the
[42:38] internet, but I I just pray that the
[42:40] Lord touched brother Matthew tonight,
[42:41] and maybe maybe the Lord just go by his
[42:43] way, and I know that the angel of the
[42:45] Lord's been known to go through some
[42:46] neighborhoods before, so I'm I believe
[42:49] you'll go by the way of Brother Matthew
[42:51] tonight. Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13.
[42:54] I'm sorry for I just want to talk to you
[42:56] for a little bit. I missed you. So, and
[42:58] uh
[43:00] so so maybe we'll just talk a little bit
[43:02] to you tonight about God about what God
[43:04] has laid on their heart. Hebrews chapter
[43:06] 6 and verse 13. For when God made
[43:09] promise to Abraham because he could
[43:12] swear by no greater he sweared by
[43:14] himself saying surely blessing I will
[43:18] bless thee and multiplying I will
[43:20] multiply thee. And so after he had
[43:22] patiently endured he obtained the
[43:24] promise. For men verilely swear by the
[43:27] greater an oath for confirmation is to
[43:29] them an end of all strife. There is no
[43:32] more argument. There is no more argument
[43:35] when God speaks. Wherein God willing
[43:37] more abundantly to show unto the heirs
[43:39] of promise the immutability of his
[43:41] counsel confirmed it by an oath that by
[43:44] two immutable things in which it was
[43:46] impossible for God to lie, we might have
[43:49] a strong consolation.
[43:51] Ain't it wonderful to have a strong
[43:53] consolation?
[43:55] Who hath fled for refuge to lay hold
[43:58] upon the hope set before us? Which hope
[44:01] we have as an anchor of the soul both
[44:04] sure and steadfast which enterth into
[44:07] that within the veil. Whether the
[44:09] forerunner is for us entered even Jesus
[44:12] made an high priest forever after the
[44:15] order of Melzdc. Let's just go to the
[44:17] Lord and speak to him just for a minute.
[44:19] Father, we love you so much, Lord. It's
[44:22] an honor, Lord Jesus, to be in your
[44:24] house and to worship, Lord, our the
[44:26] great I am, Lord, with brothers and
[44:28] sisters. Lord, we recognize, Lord Jesus,
[44:31] that you are here. You said in your
[44:33] word, where two or three are gathered,
[44:35] in my name, there I will be in the midst
[44:37] of them. And Father, we recognize, Lord
[44:39] Jesus, that you have come here tonight,
[44:42] Lord, with a great obligation, Lord
[44:44] Jesus, to release your word to your
[44:46] children's heart. And I pray, Father,
[44:48] that you would just move across this
[44:49] audience tonight in a special way, Lord
[44:52] Jesus. You see every one of their needs.
[44:54] You see see every circumstance of the
[44:56] life that they are in. And I pray, God,
[44:58] that you would just minister to them in
[45:01] a special way, Father. Lord, I believe
[45:03] that you're that kind of a God tonight
[45:05] that you can just go right to the very
[45:08] secret of our heart and minister to us
[45:10] on the things that we've been maybe just
[45:13] going over in our mind. Lord, you're
[45:15] that kind of a God that you're a
[45:16] discerner of the thoughts of our heart.
[45:19] So, Father, we invite you just now to
[45:22] minister to us. And we give you liberty
[45:24] in this place tonight in the name of
[45:26] Jesus Christ. Amen. May God bless his
[45:29] word. You may be seated tonight.
[45:37] I've had this thought that's just been
[45:40] reeling on my mind
[45:44] ever since I was able to we were able to
[45:46] go to brother Tim's meeting and then
[45:49] then as we come back home and then to be
[45:51] with the believers there in Poland, the
[45:54] this thought just kept coming to my
[45:56] heart. It is enough. It is enough. And
[46:00] and I believe that many times that when
[46:03] we come when it comes to our walk of
[46:05] life that we wonder, are we really being
[46:09] enough?
[46:11] Is is the things that I'm doing for the
[46:14] Lord, is it enough? I I wonder if I if
[46:18] I'm if I'm alone here tonight or if
[46:20] that's something that that you ponder
[46:22] sometimes. If am I am I doing enough? It
[46:25] is it enough? And and have I done
[46:28] enough? Have I have I went enough? Have
[46:31] I Is my worship enough? Is my faith
[46:34] enough? Because honestly, as Christians,
[46:37] our true desire is to live a life that
[46:40] is pleasing to him in all manners.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Because we recognize as human beings
[46:45] that we all have limitations upon upon
[46:47] ourself. And we we often let oursel
[46:50] down. And I'd say that if we'll be real
[46:52] honest, we've often let God down in some
[46:54] senses. But you know there there is
[46:57] nobody there is nobody that wants to do
[47:00] more for Christ than a man or a woman
[47:02] whose heart is set on fire of the Holy
[47:05] Ghost.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to think about that
[47:08] thought, is it enough? And when you hear
[47:10] when you hear man start saying, "Is it
[47:13] enough?" you'll hear it and you'll see
[47:15] that there's a question mark behind it
[47:17] when it's coming from the very mind of a
[47:20] man. And man is beginning to admit that
[47:23] he has limitations when he says is it
[47:25] enough or it is enough or am I doing
[47:28] enough? And but when it when you look at
[47:30] it into a divine when you look into it
[47:34] in the divine uh concept of the word
[47:37] that you'll look at it in that concept
[47:39] it is enough. It shows a divine finality
[47:43] to it. is that when God begins to
[47:46] declare that something it is enough, God
[47:49] is saying that he is marking the end of
[47:52] that season or his almighty power by his
[47:56] hand is drawing a line in it by his
[47:59] authority. You see man sometimes will
[48:01] get to that spot and say is it enough
[48:04] and am I doing enough? But when he gets
[48:06] to that position, you see, man may want
[48:09] to do more or man might want more time
[48:11] or man might want more explanations on
[48:14] certain matters or maybe man might want
[48:16] more control. But there comes a moment
[48:19] in in every person's walk of life and no
[48:22] matter the scripture or the drama that
[48:25] God would lay in for certain
[48:27] characteristics is that God will come
[48:29] behind it and say that the matter is
[48:31] completely settled. You see, there are
[48:34] several times or several moments
[48:35] throughout the scripture where God will
[48:37] just come in and say, "That's enough
[48:39] right there." And he'll stop judgment
[48:41] when the when the angel was when the
[48:43] angel was going through there. When
[48:44] David was when David had numbered the
[48:47] children of Israel to see how many he
[48:49] had, the angel of the Lord went through
[48:51] there and he he had finally come to a
[48:53] spot and it said, "It is enough." and he
[48:55] stopped the judgment of God and he come
[48:57] to a place and when God says it is
[49:00] enough it's it's bringing closure to a
[49:02] situation or it's the end of that
[49:04] person's phase or their journey of that
[49:07] life or or come to the end of his life
[49:11] and we could say it that nobody said it
[49:13] greater than our Lord Jesus Christ when
[49:15] he's hanging there on the cross and he
[49:17] said it is finished he was bringing a
[49:20] finality to the thought that all ALL THE
[49:24] SINS THAT HAD been laid out there for
[49:26] generations upon generations that God
[49:29] was saying it is enough.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE COULD SAY IT IS ENOUGH TO
[49:35] THINK THAT EVERY SIN THAT YOUR MOTHER
[49:38] AND YOUR FATHER AND YOUR
[49:39] GREAT-GRANDFATHER ALL THE WAY BACK THERE
[49:42] TO THE GARDEN OF EDEN THAT THE LORD
[49:44] JESUS CHRIST CAN LOOK AT IT AND SAY, "IT
[49:47] IS ENOUGH." HE CAN LOOK AT HIS OWN BLOOD
[49:51] AS IT'S BEING SHED ON THE CROSS AND HE
[49:54] COULD SAT THERE AS HE'S SPEAKING IN
[49:56] TONGUES AND SAYS, "IT IS FINISHED."
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Many times when you begin to look
[50:04] through the scriptures, you begin to
[50:06] find that people get to that place and
[50:08] they've just had enough. They get to a
[50:11] place and the scriptures actually record
[50:13] people record where people get to a
[50:16] place where they're exhausted. They get
[50:19] to a place where they're overwhelmed.
[50:21] They get to a place where they're ready
[50:22] TO QUIT AND THROW in the towel. And when
[50:25] they get to a place and said, "It's
[50:26] enough." You see, what their enough is
[50:28] confessing is, "I cannot do it in my own
[50:31] power."
[50:32] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT'S WHERE GOD strength
[50:36] becomes visible. And I thought brother
[50:38] Matthew JUST DID A VERY ADEQUATE JOB
[50:40] ABOUT SPEAKING IT LAST WEEKEND ABOUT MY
[50:43] STRENGTH IS MADE PERFECT IN WEAKNESS.
[50:46] You see, BECAUSE WHEN WE COME TO THE END
[50:49] OF OUR ENOUGH, IT'S OFTEN WHEN GOD
[50:52] BEGINS TO OPEN UP A DOOR OF TRANSITION
[50:55] OR IT'S A NEW BEGINNING BECAUSE WE DON'T
[50:58] REALIZE THAT WHEN WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF
[51:00] OUR ROPE AND WE'RE AT THE END OF THE
[51:02] LINE AND WE'RE SAID, "THAT'S ENOUGH. I
[51:04] CAN'T GO NO MORE." THAT'S WHEN GOD'S
[51:06] GETTING READY TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.
[51:08] AMEN.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; You know, THE PROPHET ELIJAH ONE TIME
[51:12] GOT TO A PLACE WHERE HE'D DONE BATTLED
[51:14] EVERY EVERY PSYCHOLOGY DEVIL, every
[51:16] intellectual devil. He'd been up there
[51:18] on a mountain. He just fought 450
[51:21] prophets up there of bail. And he'd been
[51:23] up there battling AGAINST THEM. AND HE
[51:25] GOT WORN OUT. HE'D BEEN BATTLING AGAINST
[51:28] AHAB AND JEZEBEL. AND I'LL BE HONEST,
[51:30] Elijah was at a place where the
[51:32] scripture said THAT HE WAS SUICIDAL. HE
[51:35] GOT TO A PLACE WHERE HE WAS DONE. HE,
[51:38] THE BIBLE DECLARES THAT ELIJAH SAID, "IT
[51:40] IS ENOUGH." ELIJAH WAS SAYING, "I HAVE
[51:44] RAN MY RACE. I HAVE FINISHED MY COURSE.
[51:47] I'M DONE. I CAN'T HANDLE IT NO MORE.
[51:49] TAKE MY LIFE AWAY." YOU SEE, WHEN YOU
[51:52] COME TO THIS PLACE OF IT IS ENOUGH. IT
[51:55] IS SIGNALING A TRANSITION. AND WHEN
[51:57] ELIJAH SAYS THIS, GOD WAS NOT REJECTING
[52:00] HIM. HALLELUJAH. BUT GOD WAS PREPARING
[52:03] HIM FOR THE NEXT STEP OF HIS MINISTRY.
[52:08] HALLELUJAH. [cheering]
[52:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GET TO A PLACE WHEN YOU SAY,
[52:11] "Is it enough?
[52:14] It is enough. Is it?"
[52:18] You don't realize. But a double portion
[52:21] is getting ready to come.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; When you get TO A PLACE, CAN I CAN I DO
[52:25] A LITTLE BIT MORE? CAN I CAN I GIVE A
[52:27] LITTLE BIT MORE?
[52:31] He gets to this spot
[52:33] and he gets to a place a lot of humans
[52:37] get to I don't know about you womans,
[52:39] but a lot of us humans get to that place
[52:42] where we just got to lay up underneath a
[52:44] juniper tree.
[52:46] He He's ready to die. He's ready to give
[52:48] it all up. But it was when he got to it
[52:51] is enough. IT'S THAT WHEN GOD STEPS IN
[52:54] AND STARTED SUPERNATURALLY FEEDING HIM
[52:57] AND LEADS HIM UP THERE TO HOREB.
[52:59] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE LEADS HIM UP
[53:01] THERE TO HOREB AND A STILL SMALL VOICE
[53:04] STARTS TALKING TO HIM AND GIVES HIM AN
[53:06] ASSIGNMENT THAT THE GREATER PART OF HIS
[53:08] MINISTRY WAS GETTING BE READY TO BE
[53:11] TRANSFERRED.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; He lines it out
[53:17] of exactly how things are going to be.
[53:21] You sisters, I've watched I've watched
[53:24] my wife and my mom do this many times.
[53:27] You sisters, you get to a place and
[53:29] you're wanting to provide for your
[53:31] husband that's been out working. He's
[53:34] been bringing home. He's been bringing
[53:36] home the bacon
[53:38] and you want to provide something very
[53:41] special for him.
[53:44] And I've heard this often times sitting
[53:46] around a dinner table and you sisters
[53:49] sometimes think my just it just ain't
[53:52] enough,
[53:54] you know. And I I I don't know. I don't
[53:56] know if this will satisfy my husband,
[53:58] but I've sure put a lot into it.
[54:02] You I I've heard this now. I I my
[54:06] sourdough didn't just turn out like it
[54:08] did last time.
[54:10] You know, my gravy didn't turn out like
[54:11] it did last time. you know, I I just
[54:14] something wasn't right. My tiny was the
[54:15] world's worst. She'd sit there and she'd
[54:18] say, "Now, that gravy, it ain't it ain't
[54:20] as good as I like, and it would be the
[54:22] best gravy you ever ate in your life."
[54:26] You sisters, you know what I'm talking
[54:27] about. You You've worked hard. You want
[54:29] to do something nice for your husband.
[54:30] You've been out there working and doing
[54:32] what a man should do, getting out
[54:34] working, and you want to provide him a
[54:36] nice meal, and you're you're worried, is
[54:37] it enough? Is it going to satisfy him?
[54:40] and you feed him and my he sits there
[54:42] and he's chowing down and he's just
[54:43] enjoying the best beans and ters and
[54:46] some of the best meal he's ever eaten.
[54:49] He has to push himself back away from
[54:51] the table to give his midriff a little
[54:53] bit of area so that it could breathe
[54:54] just a little extra.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; When he DOES THAT, IT'S A sign he's
[54:59] satisfied.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; It's enough.
[55:03] It shows THAT WHEN A MAN PUSHES away
[55:05] from the table, I HAVE GOT MY FIELD.
[55:09] THAT I'M SATISFIED WITH YOUR MEAL. AND
[55:11] YOU SITTING THERE THINKING, I didn't I
[55:12] didn't do this right. I didn't PUT
[55:14] ENOUGH SALT IN. I DIDN'T add enough of
[55:16] this in there. I SHOULD HAVE ADDED THAT.
[55:17] I forgot this and I forgot that. But
[55:19] your husband sitting THERE, MINE, THAT'S
[55:21] THE BEST THING THAT YOU EVER MAKE.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW THAT I FIND OUT ABOUT
[55:25] HUMANITY THAT WE'LL OFTEN GET TO THAT
[55:27] POSITION where we think that what we've
[55:29] got to offer is not enough for our Lord
[55:32] Jesus Christ. BUT WHAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT
[55:34] OUR LORD IS WHEN WE THINK it ain't
[55:36] enough, it's more than enough. He takes
[55:38] TWO LITTLE FISHES AND FIVE LOAVES of
[55:40] bread. He can take a little bitty meal
[55:42] and a little bit of a barrel. He can
[55:43] take 300 men and put them IN GIDEON'S
[55:46] ARMY. AND HE CAN STRIKE DOWN 122,000
[55:49] MIDIANITES. WHEN YOU DON'T THINK IT'S
[55:51] ENOUGH, IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH.
[55:53] [screaming] WHEN GOD TOUCHES IT,
[55:56] &gt;&gt; I SAY THIS, THIS MESSAGE IS ENOUGH.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I don't HAVE TO WORRY IF I'M
[56:05] GOING IN A RAPTURE OR NOT. IT'S ENOUGH
[56:07] TO PUT ME IN A RAPTURE, I DON'T HAVE TO
[56:09] WORRY. HALLELUJAH.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; It is [applause]
[56:13] enough.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER PROPHET SAID IN CONFIRMATION AND
[56:17] EVIDENCE, "WHEN A man buys a car, he
[56:20] must have a deed to that car. And though
[56:22] he HAS NOT THE CAR SITTING in his
[56:24] garage, HALLELUJAH." IF HE HAS A DEED,
[56:28] IT'S A CONFIRMATION TO HIM THAT HE OWNS
[56:31] THAT CAR.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE HE HAS A DEED OR THE
[56:35] TITLE. AND THEN IF WE BOUGHT A PIECE OF
[56:38] GROUND, THOUGH WE never seen the ground
[56:40] or know nothing about the ground, YET WE
[56:42] HAVE AN ABSTRACT DEED TO THAT GROUND. IT
[56:45] BELONGS to us.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; WHETHER WE HAVE SEEN IT OR NOT.
[56:51] HALLELUJAH. IT STILL BELONGS TO US. THE
[56:55] CAR BELONGS TO US. WHETHER WE SEEN IT OR
[56:58] NOT, WE HAVE A TITLE GIVEN TO US AND WE
[57:02] HOLD IT. HALLELUJAH. We hold it in our
[57:05] possession and that title shows.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; IT SHOWS THAT WE OWN THE CAR.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; THAT ABSTRACT TITLE DEED SHOWS THAT WE
[57:17] OWN THE PROPERTY. THE ABSTRACT IS THE
[57:20] PROOF. NOW, I've never had this happen
[57:23] to me, but I don't I don't believe it's
[57:25] too far out that it could happen to me.
[57:28] BUT IF I I get a letter in the in the
[57:31] mail that one of my great great UNCLES
[57:34] THAT WAS A very wealthy man died and he
[57:37] heard about a little bitty red-headed
[57:39] preacher and he wanted to leave him some
[57:41] money. And I get this paper in there and
[57:45] it says I own all this and I don't know
[57:47] about any of them are rich uncles
[57:51] but if any of them out there
[57:54] now's a good time. is as good a time as
[57:57] any.
[58:00] But if I if that's oh this uncle decided
[58:03] he wanted to leave me everything that he
[58:05] had and HAD ALL THESE THOUSANDS OF ACRES
[58:08] that he was going to leave to my name
[58:10] and I got this legal certification
[58:12] saying that this PIECE OF PROPERTY IS
[58:15] OWNED BY ANDREW SPITRA. It was left and
[58:19] it was read, HALLELUJAH, BY THE TESTATOR
[58:23] THAT THIS MAN LEFT YOU THIS PIECE OF
[58:25] PROPERTY. NOW, I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH
[58:28] YOU. I DON'T THINK I'D be like some
[58:30] Christians that stand out there say,
[58:31] "You know what? I don't know WHETHER
[58:32] THIS IS RIGHT OR NOT. I really don't
[58:35] know if I got an uncle like that. I
[58:37] really don't know if somebody would love
[58:39] me that or think that much about me that
[58:42] he would leave me all of this.
[58:45] I don't believe I'd be that side of
[58:47] Christianity because I believe that I
[58:49] came from the south side OF HEAVEN. BUT
[58:51] I BELIEVE THIS THAT IF I GOT THAT LETTER
[58:54] IN THE MAIL, I'D BE LIKE I'D BE LIKE
[58:57] [screaming] JOB AND I'D START SHOUTING
[58:59] ALL AROUND IT BECAUSE I COULD SAY, "YOU
[59:01] KNOW WHAT? I NEVER SEEN THAT PROPERTY,
[59:04] BUT THAT DEED RIGHT THERE SHOWS THAT I
[59:06] GOT A RICH UNCLE THAT THOUGHT THAT
[59:09] THOMAS, I HOPE it's you, buddy. I pray
[59:11] God it's you." HALLELUJAH. MAYBE MY
[59:13] UNCLE MARK WILL LEAVE ME SOMETHING like
[59:15] that ONE DAY. WHETHER I EVER SEEN IT OR
[59:18] NOT, BECAUSE THAT DEED SHOWS THAT IT'S
[59:22] MINE. [screaming]
[59:24] &gt;&gt; WELL, you can dance all about it you
[59:26] want to. Or you can say, "Well, I don't
[59:28] know whether it's right or not,
[59:31] but as for me in my house,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO MOVE. I GOT SOME NEW LAND."
[59:37] WELL, THAT'S THE WAY THAT SOME
[59:39] CHRISTIANS NEED TO DO. THEY NEED TO PICK
[59:41] UP WHERE THEY'RE LIVING IN. IN A SPOT OF
[59:44] DOUBT, IN A SPOT OF CONFUSION, IN A SPOT
[59:46] WHERE THE BLOOD DOESN'T WORK NO MORE. IN
[59:49] A SPOT WHERE HEALING DOESN'T EXIST NO
[59:51] MORE AND TAKE UP RESIDENCE IN A NEW
[59:54] LAND.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; NOW, I ain't got no rich uncles. I
[59:58] guarantee it. [panting]
[1:00:01] But I do have a Princess Diana that was
[1:00:03] in my genealogy. BUT MAYBE SOMETHING
[1:00:06] FROM HER GOT PASSED OUT. I DON'T KNOW
[1:00:08] WHETHER THAT'LL HAPPEN YET OR NOT, but
[1:00:12] this I do know.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I got everything I want and everything
[1:00:17] I'll ever need. ANYTHING I COULD EVER
[1:00:19] ASK FOR. ANYTHING THAT'S too big, I CAN
[1:00:22] STILL ASK FOR IT. IF IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S
[1:00:24] A LITTLE TOO SMALL, I CAN ASK FOR IT.
[1:00:26] WILL YOU SAY, "BROTHER ANDREW, IS IT
[1:00:28] ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY NEEDS?" IT is
[1:00:32] enough.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; I love what Brother Brandham is doing
[1:00:36] here. He is showing us and he is drawing
[1:00:40] a line between seeing and owning BECAUSE
[1:00:43] FAITH POSSESSES WHAT THE EYE HAS NOT YET
[1:00:46] SEEN. BECAUSE FAITH HOLDS A PART OF THAT
[1:00:49] TITLE DEED OF GOD'S PROMISES. YOU SEE,
[1:00:52] WE BEGIN SO MANY TIMES as Christianity,
[1:00:55] we begin to look for improvement instead
[1:00:58] of believing.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; You know what? I I I've been sick for
[1:01:03] this like a long time now. I I just be
[1:01:05] honest with you. And I don't know
[1:01:07] whether God's got the power or not.
[1:01:10] When that person starts feeling a little
[1:01:12] bit better, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE GOD'S
[1:01:15] MAYBE GOD'S WORD DOES WORK AND THEY
[1:01:17] START BUILDING up a little bit OF FAITH
[1:01:19] AND THEY START THINKING, you know what?
[1:01:21] Hey, God is God is still God. He's still
[1:01:24] a good God. But as a title deed
[1:01:27] believer, hallelujah, FAITH DOESN'T LOOK
[1:01:29] OUT THERE to check in THE GARAGE AND SEE
[1:01:32] WHETHER THE CAR'S THERE OR NOT. FAITH
[1:01:34] CHECKS THE TITLE. FAITH REJOICES BEFORE
[1:01:37] THE MERCEDES GETS IN THE GARAGE.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I SAY IT'S WORTH BELIEVING.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you, my God owns a cattle on a
[1:01:46] thousand hills.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you, my God can put a Cadillac in
[1:01:50] YOUR GARAGE BEFORE NIGHT IS OVER IF YOU
[1:01:53] HAD NEED OF IT.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; I remember Brother Ron was preaching
[1:01:57] along the line like that one time down
[1:01:59] in South Carolina. He's preaching about
[1:02:01] God. God could give you a million
[1:02:03] dollars in in a checkbook by the end of
[1:02:06] this service. He's a black sister
[1:02:08] sitting back there. She said, "SURELY
[1:02:09] WANT TO DO IT AGAIN, LORD."
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; I think we need to get that kind of
[1:02:15] faith.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; AND WE NEED TO START TALKING IT UNTIL IT
[1:02:20] BECOMES MANIFESTATION.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T NEED A MILLION DOLLARS. I
[1:02:24] DON'T NEED $10 MILLION. YOU SAY, "WELL,
[1:02:26] it sure would help me."
[1:02:28] Let me tell you, if you can't make it
[1:02:29] with what you got, you'll never make it.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, if you have need OF
[1:02:34] IT, MY FATHER WILL PUT IT IN YOUR HANDS
[1:02:37] BEFORE YOU CAN EVER think of it.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART
[1:02:42] [screaming] THAT GOD HAS GOT A PEOPLE
[1:02:44] THAT HAVE THE ability
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; to speak.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; I'll just be real honest. I don't need a
[1:02:50] Ferrari.
[1:02:53] I think I'd look good in that thing.
[1:02:56] I sure like to try it out one time.
[1:03:01] I really don't think I need that. I
[1:03:04] really don't. But I would enjoy it.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to lie. I'd enjoy that.
[1:03:12] I tell you what I do need.
[1:03:15] I need to preach this message
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; to every prodal
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; that I've ever cared for and you ever
[1:03:22] cared for. Come on.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; I need to preach it. That's what I need.
[1:03:26] I need to preach faith until it gets
[1:03:29] into a people's hearts. I NEED TO PREACH
[1:03:31] HEALING UNTIL PEOPLE START BELIEVING IT.
[1:03:33] THAT'S WHAT I NEED. AND WHEN I START
[1:03:35] WORKING ACCORDING TO REVELATIONS 19,
[1:03:38] THAT THESE ARE THE TRUE SAYINGS OF GOD.
[1:03:42] THAT'S WHAT I NEED. I DON'T NEED A
[1:03:44] FERRARI. I DON'T NEED A LAMBORGHINI. BUT
[1:03:47] WHAT [screaming] I DO need
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; is every hoof.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, you see all them things
[1:03:59] out there.
[1:04:02] You see it. You see every need that we
[1:04:04] got. What do you think? The message is
[1:04:07] enough.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; I I tell you one thing. You ain't got to
[1:04:11] change nothing about this message. It'll
[1:04:13] work. I tell you what, it'll work in
[1:04:15] Belgium. It'll work in New Zealand.
[1:04:18] It'll work in Poland. It'll work in
[1:04:20] France. IT'LL WORK IN ZIMBABWE. IT'LL
[1:04:22] WORK IN AFRICA. IT'LL WORK IN IT'LL WORK
[1:04:24] IN THE DARKENED JUNGLES OF OVERCROSSED
[1:04:27] SEAS. THIS MESSAGE WILL PUT A HEART ON
[1:04:30] FIRE FOR THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS. HELL HAS GOT TO RESPECT
[1:04:34] THE WORD.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; HAIL'S GOT WHETHER YOU CHOOSE TO RESPECT
[1:04:38] IT OR NOT, HAIL'S GOT TO RESPECT IT. AND
[1:04:40] WHEN SATAN BEGINS TO CHALLENGE YOUR
[1:04:42] HEALING OR YOUR SALVATION OR YOUR
[1:04:44] DELIVERANCE OR YOUR PEACE, you point him
[1:04:47] back to that title.
[1:04:49] Don't point him to your circumstances.
[1:04:51] Don't point him to your symptoms. YOU
[1:04:53] POINT HIM RIGHT BACK TO THAT TITLE DEED.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THAT ABSTRACT TITLE DEED SAYS
[1:04:59] THERE IS NOTHING AGAINST YOUR PROPERTY.
[1:05:02] THAT ABSTRACT TITLE DEED SAYS ALL THE
[1:05:04] PAST claims are cleared off. There ain't
[1:05:08] no leans. There ain't NO DEBTS. THERE
[1:05:10] AIN'T NO LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; SO IN CHRIST, YOUR PAST IS ERADICATED.
[1:05:18] SATAN'S CLAIMS ARE IN VOID AND
[1:05:21] INADEQUATE.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; The blood
[1:05:25] has removed every lean.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you as a point. Only
[1:05:32] as a point. I was not born to be
[1:05:35] somebody that is a renter.
[1:05:38] And I'm not saying I know that people
[1:05:40] have different circumstances where they
[1:05:41] have to rent. Some people find that to
[1:05:44] be the very best of their life, but I
[1:05:45] was that was not me.
[1:05:48] And I'm not I'm only saying this for a
[1:05:50] point. I'm only saying this for a point.
[1:05:51] Promise you I was not born to be a
[1:05:54] renter because I want to leave something
[1:05:56] to my family.
[1:05:59] I believe that's what Proverbs tells us
[1:06:01] that we ought to raise up something to
[1:06:02] leave a lineage to our children.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; They're going to be responsible for what
[1:06:06] they got to do.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; But I was not born to be a renter. So
[1:06:11] let me say it to you like this so that
[1:06:13] you'll get what I'm saying. You are not
[1:06:15] renting forgiveness.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; You are not renting forgiveness.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? WHEN
[1:06:24] YOU'RE a renter, YOU PAY ONE TIME AND
[1:06:27] YOU GOT TO PAY AGAIN. And when you get
[1:06:29] to the end of the road, you still got to
[1:06:31] rent because you'll never own it. But if
[1:06:33] YOU ARE PAYING IT DOWN, IF YOU'RE PAYING
[1:06:36] IT DOWN AND YOU GOT ALL OF THAT BUILT UP
[1:06:38] AND YOU GOT A FINALITY TO IT AND THE
[1:06:41] DEED IS THERE, IT SAYS IT'S PAID OFF.
[1:06:44] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT RENTING IT. YOU
[1:06:50] OWN FORGIVENESS.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; YOU own forgiveness.
[1:06:55] LOOK AT THE DEVIL IN YOUR LIFE AND SAID,
[1:06:57] "MY GOD OWNS FORGIVENESS."
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what faith does. Faith
[1:07:06] will begin to laugh. It will laugh at
[1:07:10] the miracle being in absence.
[1:07:13] ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; ISAAC MEANS LAUGHTER.
[1:07:17] I SAY ABRAHAM, I SAY SARAH, YOU MIGHT BE
[1:07:21] GETTING A LITTLE BIT OLDER, BUT IT'S A
[1:07:23] TIME TO TURN TO LAUGHING.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; IT'S A time when you start laughing
[1:07:27] about it. Because in the natural,
[1:07:32] in the natural, the car ain't in the
[1:07:33] garage.
[1:07:36] But in the supernatural,
[1:07:40] no manifestation means it's already
[1:07:43] yours.
[1:07:45] What are you saying, brother Angel? I'm
[1:07:46] saying manifestation is just late for
[1:07:48] the party.
[1:07:50] Are you with me? I say this, if you're a
[1:07:53] real title deed believer, it is enough
[1:07:56] BECAUSE YOUR OWNERSHIP HAS ALREADY
[1:07:58] ARRIVED the very second that YOU RECEIVE
[1:08:01] THE WORD. WHEN ABRAHAM IS SAYING,
[1:08:03] SITTING THERE IN GENESIS 15, HE SAID,
[1:08:05] "NOW look here. GOD, ARE YOU GOING TO
[1:08:07] LET ME GO CHILDLESS, SEEING THAT THE
[1:08:09] ONLY heir in my house is Eleazar OF
[1:08:12] DAMASCUS? THERE'S PEOPLE LAUGHING AT ME.
[1:08:14] THEY'RE CALLING ME THE FATHER of
[1:08:16] nations, and I don't even have an heir
[1:08:18] in my own house." AND GOD SPEAKS BACK TO
[1:08:20] HIM. BOY, don't worry. THAT SHALL NOT BE
[1:08:23] THINE HEIR. BUT I WANT YOU TO DO THIS. I
[1:08:26] WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING
[1:08:27] TO GO CHILDLESS, BUT I WANT YOU TO LOOK
[1:08:30] UP TOWARDS THE HEAVENS. And I want you
[1:08:32] to see if you can tell me if that's
[1:08:34] enough.
[1:08:36] TELL ME IF THAT'S ENOUGH. BECAUSE THERE
[1:08:38] WILL BE MORE THAN STARS IN HEAVEN.
[1:08:41] THEY'LL BE GREATER [screaming] THAN THE
[1:08:42] SAND THAT IS UPON THE SHORE. YOU SEE,
[1:08:45] GOD NEVER SAID WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN, BUT
[1:08:48] HE SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN. HE SAID, "LAY
[1:08:50] HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL
[1:08:52] RECOVER." YOU SAY, "BROTHER, does it
[1:08:54] work?" I said, "It is enough."
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; THE ODDS MIGHT BE STACKED UP AGAINST
[1:08:58] YOU, BROTHER.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; But God's word is enough. GOD'S PLAN
[1:09:04] CANNOT GO DOWN DEFEATED. WHEN GOD WAS
[1:09:07] TESTING ABRAHAM, HE SENT HIM THROUGH
[1:09:09] THAT BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT ABRAHAM HAD
[1:09:12] FAITH IN WHAT HE COULD NOT SEE.
[1:09:20] I'm trying to get this to a place.
[1:09:26] I want this to land. It is enough.
[1:09:30] Because Satan will often tack you where
[1:09:34] you're looking at.
[1:09:36] We take that quote from confirmation and
[1:09:38] evidence and he will always Satan will
[1:09:41] always point you to an empty garage
[1:09:45] or he'll point you to an empty field
[1:09:47] that your name ain't on
[1:09:50] or he'll point you to delays in God's
[1:09:52] promises
[1:09:54] but faith will stand there. I love how
[1:09:56] brother Burnham says that. He says he's
[1:09:58] got hair on his chest and lets out a big
[1:10:01] old scream like a bobcat or a panther.
[1:10:04] You see, faith refuses to measure the
[1:10:08] natural by what you see.
[1:10:11] Faith is saying, you know what? I got
[1:10:14] this deed in my hand. God said it.
[1:10:17] That's final.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing what I'm saying to you?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; I'm saying talk to your doubt. I'm
[1:10:24] saying talk to your fear. I'm saying
[1:10:27] talk TO YOUR ANXIETY. I'M SAYING talk to
[1:10:29] the pain of your past. I'm saying talk
[1:10:32] to the stigmas. I'M SAYING TALK TO EVERY
[1:10:34] devil that's got a lying tongue. I say
[1:10:37] talk to that thing and show HIM THE
[1:10:39] BLOOD AND SAY IT is enough.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. I use this. If you
[1:10:47] listen to Louisiana heard this, but let
[1:10:49] me say this. I got a wonderful mama down
[1:10:50] there and I was constantly going to her.
[1:10:53] I was constantly going to her saying,
[1:10:54] "Mom, I want to do this. I want to do
[1:10:55] this. I want to do this." And she said,
[1:10:57] "Drew, get out of here." I ain't going
[1:10:59] to tell you everything that happened,
[1:11:00] but she said, "Drew, get out of here."
[1:11:02] And I bring her the petition again. I
[1:11:03] say this, "Mom, I want to go do this. I
[1:11:05] want to go throw mud pies at the house."
[1:11:06] She said, "Get out of here. I want to go
[1:11:08] do this. I want to go chase cows. I want
[1:11:10] to go to cow tipping. I want to go do
[1:11:11] this. I want to go try." I'm not going
[1:11:13] to say everything. But anyways, my mama
[1:11:16] had finally got TO A SPOT. SAID, "DREW,
[1:11:18] THAT'S ENOUGH."
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I knew what she meant right there.
[1:11:24] Boy, you better get to your room. The
[1:11:26] belt's clicking.
[1:11:29] She done had enough. WELL, IT'S TIME NOW
[1:11:33] THAT YOU LOOK AT THE DEVIL. You look to
[1:11:36] the complexes. You look to the fear. YOU
[1:11:38] LOOK TO THE THINGS IN YOUR PAST AND SAY,
[1:11:40] "SATAN, THAT'S ENOUGH."
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; SATAN IS LIKE A DOG ON A CHAIN. HE CAN
[1:11:47] ONLY GO SO FAR.
[1:11:50] BUT GOD'S WORD HAS NO LIMITATIONS ON IT.
[1:11:53] [applause]
[1:11:56] What are you saying? I'm saying this
[1:11:58] message is enough.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; It's enough to put you in a body change.
[1:12:02] IT'S ENOUGH TO PUT YOU IN A RAPTURE.
[1:12:04] IT'S ENOUGH TO HEAL YOUR BODY. IT'S
[1:12:06] ENOUGH. IT'S ENOUGH. IT'S ENOUGH. IT'LL
[1:12:09] CHANGE YOUR VISION. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
[1:12:11] YOUR NEW IDENTITY HAS TRANSFORMED RIGHT
[1:12:13] IN FRONT OF YOU.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; You remember, I want to just go back.
[1:12:25] You remember in Genesis chapter 37,
[1:12:28] there's a little boy by the name of
[1:12:30] Joseph. He's a gifted boy.
[1:12:34] He was not set up by man. He was gifted
[1:12:36] by Almighty God. You start studying in
[1:12:39] Genesis 37
[1:12:41] that Joseph has a dream
[1:12:44] and he starts talking about these
[1:12:46] these sheav falling down before him and
[1:12:49] bowing down before Joseph. It showed
[1:12:51] that it was his brethren bowing down,
[1:12:53] the sun and the moon and the stars and
[1:12:55] all of them bowing down before him. And
[1:12:58] even his father that was supposed to be
[1:13:00] a prince of power actually began to
[1:13:02] question Joseph's supernatural gift that
[1:13:05] he had in his life. You begin to look at
[1:13:08] Joseph's story, how that everything had
[1:13:11] transpired in his life, and it looked,
[1:13:14] if you're looking at the vision in the
[1:13:15] carnal realm, the vision looked like it
[1:13:18] was wrong. Joseph's path doesn't get
[1:13:21] better, but it gets worse. He goes from
[1:13:23] a pit to slave CHAINS TO PIPER'S HOUSE
[1:13:27] TO FALSE accusations to prison. And he
[1:13:30] goes to a spot that he has completely
[1:13:32] forgotten about.
[1:13:34] I wonder, have you ever got there?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; I wonder, have you got to that bad of a
[1:13:42] position where people have forgot you?
[1:13:46] Nobody's praying for me. My name's been
[1:13:48] on that prayer list for three weeks now,
[1:13:52] and I ain't got no better. I wonder if
[1:13:54] anybody really even cares for me. I
[1:13:56] wonder if they even love me.
[1:14:01] It does not get better for Joseph.
[1:14:05] It gets worse.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. When you get to the end
[1:14:10] of your enough, that's when transition
[1:14:13] happens.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you're at the end of
[1:14:16] your rope right now and you don't know
[1:14:18] what to do,
[1:14:20] get ready.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; GENESIS 45 AND 25. NOW, I got three
[1:14:28] scriptures right here that I could
[1:14:29] preach three months on.
[1:14:32] And they verse 25. And they went out
[1:14:34] when his brothers come to him and they
[1:14:37] spent some time with him and they start
[1:14:38] recognizing this ain't just somebody.
[1:14:41] This is my brother. This is Joseph. The
[1:14:44] one that we The one that we lied about.
[1:14:46] The one that we killed. We tried to kill
[1:14:47] his testimony. This is him. The one we
[1:14:51] threw in A PIT. THE ONE WE LIED TO OUR
[1:14:53] DADDY ABOUT. THE ONE THIS ONE. THAT'S MY
[1:14:56] BROTHER.
[1:14:58] And they turned back. And they went out
[1:15:00] of Egypt, and came into the land of
[1:15:04] Canaan unto Jacob their father, and told
[1:15:09] him, saying, JOSEPH IS YET ALIVE, AND HE
[1:15:14] IS GOVERNOR over all the land of Egypt.
[1:15:17] And Jacob's heart failed, for he
[1:15:20] believed them not.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; All right now.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; All right. Now y'all got y'all shouting
[1:15:28] shoes on. And they told him all the
[1:15:31] words of Joseph, WHICH HE HAD SAID UNTO
[1:15:34] THEM. AND WHEN HE SAW THE WAGONS WHICH
[1:15:39] JOSEPH HAD SENT TO CARRY HIM, THE SPIRIT
[1:15:43] OF JACOB THEIR FATHER REVIVED.
[1:15:46] [screaming] NOW WATCH THIS. AND ISRAEL
[1:15:49] SAID, "IT IS ENOUGH."
[1:15:53] NOTICE WHEN HE SAW THAT VISION OF
[1:15:57] GENESIS 37 OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS BOWING
[1:16:00] DOWN,
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID IT DO TO JACOB? IT IMMEDIATELY
[1:16:05] REVELATION CHANGED HIS IDENTITY THAT HE
[1:16:08] DIDN'T SPEAK LIKE JACOB. ISRAEL said
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; it is enough.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? I'm talking
[1:16:21] about this is that that revelation
[1:16:23] revived his identity and when you start
[1:16:26] seeing there is truth in the vision. Are
[1:16:29] you hearing me? When you start seeing
[1:16:31] there's truth IN CALVARY, WHEN YOU START
[1:16:33] SEEING THERE'S TRUTH, WHAT IS IT? THIS
[1:16:35] MOMENT WHEN HE SAW THE WAGONS THAT WAS
[1:16:38] GOING TO CARRY HIM BACK TO HIS JOSEPH.
[1:16:41] HALLELUJAH. IT WAS PROOF THAT THE VISION
[1:16:44] THAT JOSEPH [screaming] HAD WAS RIGHT.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. I've done seen the
[1:16:50] wagons of the Holy Spirit show up here.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; I DONE SEEN THE WAGONS OF MY LORD JESUS
[1:16:55] SHOW UP HERE. BUT I'VE BEEN MAKING
[1:16:57] MYSELF READY.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'VE BEEN MAKING MYSELF
[1:17:01] READY. I'VE BEEN DRESSING MYSELF IN THE
[1:17:03] UNFAILING BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN.
[1:17:06] IT IS ENOUGH.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There's going to be
[1:17:17] people
[1:17:20] They turned on that man
[1:17:25] that'll never get their wagon.
[1:17:29] But the prophet said
[1:17:31] that our horses are hooked up to the
[1:17:33] bushes.
[1:17:36] The same ones that came for Elijah when
[1:17:39] he got to his enough and he stepped over
[1:17:42] Jordan and all of a sudden departed and
[1:17:45] a chariot of fire picked him up. The
[1:17:47] prophet said that them horses are hooked
[1:17:50] up for in the bushes for you.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Let me SAY WHEN I SAW THIS PROPHET'S
[1:17:56] VISION, I COULD SAY IT IS ENOUGH.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD WILL PLACE a limit on your
[1:18:03] enemy.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; God will place a limit on your enemy and
[1:18:10] YOU'LL THINK THEY'RE STILL ATTACKING ME.
[1:18:12] BUT I'LL SAY THAT IT IS ENOUGH IS A
[1:18:14] PROTECTIVE BOUNDARY. WHEN ABRAHAM IS
[1:18:17] GETTING TO THE TRIAL OF HIS LIFE, HE'S
[1:18:19] DONE WATCH ISAAC RAISE UP AND BE A YOUNG
[1:18:22] BOY, BUT GOD IS COMMANDING HIM TO TAKE
[1:18:25] HIS SON, HIS ONLY SON,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; and sacrifice him.
[1:18:32] When Abraham got to this position
[1:18:36] that I trust you, no matter what you
[1:18:38] say, you were God enough to change my
[1:18:40] body. You're God enough to bring him
[1:18:42] back from the dead as the Lord God. give
[1:18:45] the Lord God taketh away and it's about
[1:18:47] the time he's about to kill it. God
[1:18:49] says, "Oh, that's enough. THAT'S ENOUGH.
[1:18:53] YOU AIN'T GOT TO GO NO MORE. YOU AIN'T
[1:18:55] GOT TO STRIVE NO MORE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO
[1:18:57] TRY NO MORE BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN YOUR
[1:18:59] FAITH." THAT YOUR FAITH IN THIS MESSAGE
[1:19:01] IS ENOUGH THAT THOUGH MEN TRY TO KILL
[1:19:04] YOU, THAT THOUGH MEN TRY TO SLAY YOU,
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST LIKE IN JOB'S TRIAL, SATAN
[1:19:09] COULD ONLY GO SO FAR.
[1:19:14] But God says
[1:19:16] that's enough.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; That's enough.
[1:19:21] When Abraham Hallelujah. When Abraham
[1:19:25] got to his position, he didn't know what
[1:19:27] to do. My body's done changed.
[1:19:31] I got to smoking his hottest wife in all
[1:19:33] of Egypt. And I'm about to walk down in
[1:19:36] here with her.
[1:19:38] And I know that they're going to say
[1:19:39] some things about her. They're
[1:19:43] going to want her now. Look here, honey.
[1:19:45] You tell them that you're my sister.
[1:19:52] You tell them. And the king sees her.
[1:19:55] Now, what? Now, now, you could not know
[1:19:57] this without the revelation of the seven
[1:19:59] seals being open.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; But he looks out there. That king is
[1:20:03] lusting after a 90 year old woman.
[1:20:07] Now, I think my grandma's a beautiful
[1:20:08] woman, but I highly doubt I highly doubt
[1:20:12] that any of these teenage boys are going
[1:20:13] to be lusted.
[1:20:15] And I I don't mean nothing no offense,
[1:20:19] but you let God do what he did to Sarah,
[1:20:22] to my grandma,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; brother home be rising back up again.
[1:20:30] SO, SOMETHING HAD TO CHANGE.
[1:20:37] That had probably true a whole lot of
[1:20:39] saying right there. That real
[1:20:41] inspiration.
[1:20:43] I hear you. I hear you talking to me. I
[1:20:45] hear.
[1:20:48] He says, "That's enough."
[1:20:53] [applause]
[1:20:58] But Abraham had got to a position.
[1:21:02] He got to a position
[1:21:04] he didn't know what to do with this.
[1:21:07] This king is taking my wife. This king's
[1:21:10] getting ready to take her and make her
[1:21:12] his bride.
[1:21:16] But God was not willing that his bride
[1:21:20] be manhandled. So he extracted her from
[1:21:23] every denomination.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And he stopped that king right in his
[1:21:29] track. Said, "That's enough.
[1:21:31] You can't have her. You redeem that man,
[1:21:33] his bride. You give her back. I say this
[1:21:36] to you that God is speaking in this
[1:21:38] generation. Take your hands off of my
[1:21:41] bride. Redeem her back. Give her back.
[1:21:45] Give her back. Take your dirty hands off
[1:21:47] of her, Satan. What was it when William
[1:21:49] Brandham is standing there in the breach
[1:21:52] between the CHURCH AGES AND THE SEVEN
[1:21:54] SEALS? HE'S STANDING THERE AND SAYING,
[1:21:56] "ONLY THE LAMB COULD BREAK THESE SEALS."
[1:21:59] HE SAID, "LET HIM COME. LET HIM COME OR
[1:22:02] FOREVER HOLD HIS PEACE." AND THE LAMB
[1:22:05] WAS INVITED. YOU SAY, "WELL, DID THE
[1:22:08] LAMB SHOW UP, BROTHER ANDREW? WAS THE
[1:22:10] SEVEN SEALS BROKE?" THEN THE LAMB SHOWED
[1:22:13] UP. IT WAS NOT A HOOF LAMB, BUT THE LAMB
[1:22:16] OF ALMIGHTY GOD
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; SAID THAT IN BLESSING I WILL BLESS THEE,
[1:22:21] AND IN MULTIPLYING I WILL MULTIPLY THEE.
[1:22:25] WHEN YOU got to the end of your enough,
[1:22:29] that's when God became Jehovah
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Gyra.
[1:22:34] He looked at Abraham said, "Your faith
[1:22:38] and my word is enough to bless you and
[1:22:42] to bless all of your children for every
[1:22:47] generation."
[1:22:49] Romans 8:28.
[1:22:51] And we know that all things
[1:22:55] work together for good to them that love
[1:22:58] God, to them who are the caught
[1:23:03] according to his purpose. For whom he
[1:23:05] did for know, he also did predestinate
[1:23:07] to be conformed to the image of his son,
[1:23:09] that he might be the firstborn amongst
[1:23:11] many brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[1:23:13] predestinate, them he also called, and
[1:23:16] whom he called, them he also justified.
[1:23:18] AND WHOM HE JUSTIFIED, them he also
[1:23:21] glorified. It means he raised them to a
[1:23:25] heavenly dignity. For what shall we then
[1:23:28] say to these things? If Elohim be for
[1:23:32] us, who can be against us? He that
[1:23:35] spared not his own son, but delivered
[1:23:37] him up for us, HOW SHALL HE NOT WITH HIM
[1:23:39] ALSO FREELY give us all things? WHO
[1:23:42] SHALL LAY ANYTHING to the charge of
[1:23:44] God's elect? It is
[1:23:48] it is IT IS GOD
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; THAT JUSTIFYTH.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, you have no idea what
[1:23:56] Sister Rebecca did. You have no idea
[1:23:59] what her father did. You have no idea
[1:24:01] what her grandfather did. I don't need
[1:24:03] to know. Neither do I care.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; IT IS GOD that justifith.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY IT WITH ME. IT IS GOD THAT
[1:24:13] JUSTIFYTH. Who is he?
[1:24:16] Oh, let's call that booger out. WHO IS
[1:24:20] HE THAT CONDEMNTH? IT IS CHRIST THAT
[1:24:23] DIED. YAY, RATHER IS RISEN AGAIN, WHO IS
[1:24:26] EVEN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, WHO ALSO
[1:24:28] MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US. WHO SHALL
[1:24:30] SEPARATE US? NOW NAME THAT BOOGER. Name
[1:24:34] every lying devil. Name every ugly
[1:24:36] spirit THAT YOU GOT. WHO SHALL SEPARATE
[1:24:38] US FROM THE LOVE OF GOD? SHALL
[1:24:40] TRIBULATION? SHOUT DISTRESS OR
[1:24:42] PERSECUTION OR FAMINE OR NAKEDNESS OR
[1:24:45] PERIL OR SWORD. AS IT IS WRITTEN, FOR
[1:24:47] THY SAKE WE ARE KILLED ALL THE DAY LONG.
[1:24:49] WE ARE accounted as sheep for slaughter.
[1:24:52] Nay, in all these things.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, line them boogers up.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Yet in all OF THESE THINGS,
[1:25:03] LINE THEM DEVILS UP. WE ARE MORE THAN
[1:25:06] CONQUERORS. WHEN YOU LOOK THAT UP IN THE
[1:25:08] GREEK, IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE A SUPER
[1:25:11] CONQUEROR. NOT ONLY CAN YOU CONQUER, BUT
[1:25:13] YOU'RE A MAGNIFIED CONQUEROR THROUGH
[1:25:16] Christ
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; that loved us.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; You remember when that that soldier boy
[1:25:23] came to Abraham Lincoln and he came to
[1:25:26] him and told him about this man that had
[1:25:28] done this wrong thing and they're going
[1:25:30] to kill him before the guards and all
[1:25:32] these things. He didn't mean to do it.
[1:25:33] He's a good man. He was just in it
[1:25:34] wrong. And Abraham Lincoln said, "You
[1:25:36] take this and tell him that he's
[1:25:37] pardoned." And when he went to that
[1:25:39] man's prison door, he told him said,
[1:25:40] "Look here. I got a note from Mr.
[1:25:42] Lincoln said, "You're absolutely free.
[1:25:44] You're absolutely free. All you got to
[1:25:46] do is walk out of here." He said, "Get
[1:25:48] out here." Abraham Lincoln wouldn't sign
[1:25:50] on a piece of paper LIKE THAT. IT HAD
[1:25:52] SOME LETTERHEAD to it. THIS IS ABRAHAM
[1:25:54] LINCOLN'S WORD. And they shot and killed
[1:25:57] that man. You remember what the law said
[1:26:00] when they tried that court said that a
[1:26:02] pardon is only a pardon is if it's
[1:26:05] accepted as a pardon.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that God gives us
[1:26:09] all things and he gives us a pardon. HE
[1:26:11] SAID, "BUT it isn't only just that read
[1:26:13] it. It doesn't mean that you're
[1:26:15] pardoned. It means that YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:26:17] ACCEPT IT AS YOUR PARDON." THAT GOD GAVE
[1:26:20] HIS SON TO DIE in yourstead.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's a pardon.
[1:26:28] I remember brother Wayne was preaching
[1:26:30] on the bride's redemptive rights one
[1:26:32] time and he got talking about Eve
[1:26:35] walking out and the bride walking in.
[1:26:39] He said, you know, he said, we didn't
[1:26:41] have nothing to do with losing our
[1:26:42] rights and he said, we ain't got nothing
[1:26:44] to do with bringing them back in.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; We ain't got nothing to do with buying
[1:26:47] them back. I ain't counting on me.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; I'm counting on him.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; All we got to do is accept it.
[1:26:58] Now, I'm trying to tell you something.
[1:27:00] I'm trying to tell you something.
[1:27:03] You might think I'm preaching about sin,
[1:27:05] but I'm really talking about this
[1:27:06] message.
[1:27:08] It's enough.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And when you start operating from that
[1:27:12] position,
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; it's enough.
[1:27:16] You know, Brother Roy Borders was
[1:27:19] Brother Brandham's uh campaign manager
[1:27:21] at one point and Brother Brandham came
[1:27:24] to him and he when he was offering him
[1:27:27] the job to be the campaign manager, he
[1:27:28] come to him. He said, "Now look, Brother
[1:27:30] Roy,"
[1:27:31] he said, "I need I got a position. I
[1:27:35] need you. I'm asking, would you consider
[1:27:37] being my campaign manager?" Brother Roy
[1:27:41] said it like this. He said, "You know,"
[1:27:42] he said, "When I" He said, "When I heard
[1:27:44] about that," he said, "It excited my
[1:27:46] heart." He said, "Because I was
[1:27:47] thinking, I'm going to get to sit there
[1:27:49] where all them preachers are. I'll get
[1:27:51] be in this place." And brother Mar said,
[1:27:53] "You don't have to get back to me right
[1:27:54] now. You just wait a minute. Just just
[1:27:57] wait." So, brother brother Roy goes up
[1:27:58] there to his hotel room and he gets
[1:28:00] there and he starts thinking all the
[1:28:02] things I've done, all the problems I got
[1:28:05] in my past, all the all these things. I
[1:28:07] can't do that job. I can't do that.
[1:28:10] And he
[1:28:12] Brother Brandham comes, knocks on his
[1:28:13] door, and he takes him for a little
[1:28:15] drive. Comes to his door, takes him out,
[1:28:18] goes out through there, and he's just
[1:28:20] driving. Said, "Brother Brandon's just
[1:28:21] happy as lark." He said, "What about
[1:28:22] that job, Brother Roy?" He said,
[1:28:24] "Brother Brandon," he said, "I can't
[1:28:26] take that job. I can't take I got all
[1:28:29] them things in my past." Brother
[1:28:31] Brandham rolled over said, "Brother Roy,
[1:28:33] them things are in the sea of God's
[1:28:35] forgetfulness." He said, "Not only can I
[1:28:37] tell you that," he said, "The reason why
[1:28:39] I know that," he said, "Because I don't
[1:28:40] see your sin."
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; A prophet couldn't see the things that a
[1:28:45] man was battling with.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; So what ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING THE
[1:28:50] BLOOD IS ENOUGH.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I SAYING? IN EXODUS 12, WHEN IT
[1:28:55] WAS A TIME TO SLAY the lamb, when it
[1:28:58] come where you had to bring him in and
[1:29:00] THEY HAD TO BRING IT IN AND SLAY THE
[1:29:02] LAMB, YOU HAD TO KILL THE LAMB. YOU HAD
[1:29:06] TO SLAY THE LAMB. YOU HAD TO TAKE IT FOR
[1:29:09] YOUR HOUSE. DADDY'S, THIS IS YOUR JOB.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; It's your job to PLAY THIS MESSAGE. IT'S
[1:29:16] YOUR JOB TO APPLY THE TOKEN. IT'S YOUR
[1:29:19] JOB.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; This lamb had to be perfect.
[1:29:26] Remember when the prophet said when he's
[1:29:27] preaching a token, he said that death
[1:29:29] angel started coming around there. He
[1:29:31] said, "That little boy, that was the
[1:29:33] firstborn son said, ' Daddy, are you
[1:29:35] sure that monster ain't coming in here?"
[1:29:39] He said, 'Oh yeah. He said, 'You see
[1:29:41] this son?" He said, "You see the blood
[1:29:43] on this door?" He said, "That monster
[1:29:46] can't get in here." You see, IT IS NOT
[1:29:48] ENOUGH TO have the lamb on the inside of
[1:29:51] your house. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO TIE UP
[1:29:53] THE LAMB. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE IT AT
[1:29:56] YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. IT IS NOT ENOUGH
[1:29:58] TO GO OVER TO BROTHER ANDREW and brother
[1:30:00] Ron's HOUSE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. YOU
[1:30:02] GOT TO KILL THE LAMB.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO KILL THE LAMB AND PUT THE
[1:30:07] TOKEN OVER YOUR DOOR.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING
[1:30:11] REVELATION 10 people start eating the
[1:30:14] book.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I can say this. If you don't IF YOU
[1:30:19] DON'T START EATING THIS LAMB, THEN THAT
[1:30:21] MONSTER IS GOING TO COME BY YOUR HOUSE.
[1:30:23] AND YOU THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON THE
[1:30:25] CNN AND FOX NEWS IS BAD. When you start
[1:30:28] listening to a prophet start preaching
[1:30:30] and knoweth it not and THEM GREAT BIG
[1:30:32] OLD MONSTERS COME OUT IN THE
[1:30:34] TRIBULATION,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; YOU BETTER BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE IS
[1:30:37] ENOUGH.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; When things that Hollywood can't even
[1:30:42] come up with,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; you better pray. Daddies, you better
[1:30:47] pray. You better pray that you believed
[1:30:49] it. You better pray when them things
[1:30:51] start coming and hunting you down.
[1:30:56] Daddy,
[1:30:57] can that thing get me? Oh no.
[1:31:01] Oh no. You see, this ain't some tape
[1:31:04] hanging over your door. Hallelujah. This
[1:31:07] ain't some tape hanging over your door.
[1:31:09] This is the blood YOU CAN TAKE TAPE OFF.
[1:31:12] IT'LL RIP OFF OF THERE, BUT THE BLOOD
[1:31:14] WON'T COME OFF.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD WON'T COME [screaming] OFF.
[1:31:18] THAT BLOOD IS THERE. AND DON'T YOU
[1:31:19] WORRY, JUNIOR.
[1:31:21] THAT BLOOD SAYS YOU'RE GOING OUT OF HERE
[1:31:24] WITH ME. I tell you what it's time to
[1:31:26] do. It's time to put your staff in your
[1:31:28] hand and put your shoes ON YOUR FEET AND
[1:31:31] START GETTING READY FOR MARCHING ORDERS
[1:31:33] CUZ WE'RE GOING DOWN TO JERICHO TO TAKE
[1:31:35] OVER.
[1:31:40] [applause]
[1:31:41] Let's say
[1:31:49] Hallelujah.
[1:31:54] Hallelujah.
[1:32:01] Brother said in the resurrection of
[1:32:02] Jerus's daughter,
[1:32:08] he said, "Way back up on that hill."
[1:32:12] He said, "I could see a little woman
[1:32:14] doing her knitting."
[1:32:16] He said, "She spent all of her money
[1:32:20] for at the doctors.
[1:32:24] They couldn't do her no good.
[1:32:26] She had a blood issue for several years.
[1:32:29] And she looked down and she said, "Isn't
[1:32:31] it strange? I was just dreaming about
[1:32:34] him last night."
[1:32:38] Hallelujah.
[1:32:41] Perhaps.
[1:32:43] And I believe if I could only get to
[1:32:46] that man
[1:32:48] and touch his garments, I would have to
[1:32:50] get no prayer line. He'd just turn
[1:32:52] around and tell me
[1:32:55] it was over.
[1:32:57] If I could just get close enough to him,
[1:33:01] that's the way to do it.
[1:33:04] That's who did. If I could just get
[1:33:07] close enough to him,
[1:33:10] that's all I need.
[1:33:12] He said, 'Well, I I see her walk down
[1:33:15] here and there stands her pastor and she
[1:33:18] looks up and says, "Where are you
[1:33:20] going?" AND I SUPPOSE THEN GOING DOWN TO
[1:33:22] THAT MEETING, "WELL, I want I want to
[1:33:24] let you know this. You know what the
[1:33:26] orders are around here, any
[1:33:28] impersonation, any person that
[1:33:30] associates with that tribe, they're
[1:33:32] giving the letter said, "You can just
[1:33:33] have it." And here she goes on RIGHT ON
[1:33:36] DOWN. AND SHE SAID SHE HAD TO GET TO
[1:33:39] JESUS. AND AS SOON AS SHE GOT THERE, I
[1:33:41] CAN SEE HER STANDING before a big bunch.
[1:33:43] Look down there, say, "Well, I'm
[1:33:45] surprised at you." A WOMAN WITH THE
[1:33:47] DOCTORS HAVE TURNED DOWN AND CAN'T DO
[1:33:50] nothing for her. And you had a woman
[1:33:52] with that kind of reputation. You got as
[1:33:54] good a woman, the reputation and
[1:33:57] prestige that you got amongst the
[1:33:58] people. And here you are associating
[1:34:01] yourself with that bunch of holy
[1:34:02] rollers. Brother Chris, I can't believe
[1:34:05] you're actually down there with them.
[1:34:10] the very audacity that she would show up
[1:34:13] to hang out with them kind of people.
[1:34:16] And they said, "The days of miracles has
[1:34:19] passed." And she looked back and said, I
[1:34:21] CAN HEAR THE PROPHET SAID, I can hear
[1:34:23] her TURN AROUND SAID, "IT MIGHT BE FOR
[1:34:25] YOU, BUT NOT FOR ME.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME. IT IS." FOR SOME OF
[1:34:33] YOU THAT SAY, "THE BLOOD HAS NO LONGER
[1:34:35] GOT ITS POWER, BUT FOR ME,
[1:34:38] It is enough.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; When them slaves are climbing that hill
[1:34:43] some 200 years ago and they was
[1:34:45] climbing, it wasn't 200 years ago, was
[1:34:47] it? They was climbing that hill and they
[1:34:49] was going up there and they knew that
[1:34:52] there was a man [gasps] that had enough
[1:34:54] words that had enough power behind his
[1:34:56] words. And they started climbing that
[1:34:58] hill and they started going up there and
[1:35:00] said, "You know what? When the sun
[1:35:02] rises, we're free. We're free. We're
[1:35:05] free." Let me tell you church, it's the
[1:35:07] rising of the sun. It is enough. THEY
[1:35:11] HAD ENOUGH ABILITY AND ENOUGH POWER TO
[1:35:15] TRUST A MAN'S WORDS.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; They had that kind of capability
[1:35:22] to take a man's word
[1:35:26] to walk out of the slave master's house
[1:35:30] saying, "No,
[1:35:32] you're not going to beat me no more.
[1:35:36] You can put that whip down cuz I got a
[1:35:39] mighty man in this nation. I got a
[1:35:41] mighty man in this nation says you can't
[1:35:43] whip me no more. You may have whipped me
[1:35:45] before but you can't whip me now. You
[1:35:47] may have beat me before but you can't
[1:35:49] whip me now. You might have abused me
[1:35:51] and told me to go out there and work
[1:35:52] before but you can't do it now because
[1:35:54] there was a man that said on this day I
[1:35:58] AM FREE.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID THIS MESSAGE SAY TO THE CHURCH
[1:36:02] IN THIS GENERATION? IT IS AN INVISIBLE
[1:36:05] UNION BETWEEN THE BRIDE AND THE
[1:36:07] BRIDEGROOM. [screaming] AND NOT ONLY DID
[1:36:09] A MAN SAY IT, BUT THE lamb
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; said it is
[1:36:18] enough.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; What are you trusting, brother Andrew?
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not trusting the fleshly man,
[1:36:28] William Brandham.
[1:36:30] But I am trusting Revelations 10:1.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; I AM FULLY TRUSTING IN HIM.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; I AM FULLY TRUSTING IN THE MIGHTY ANGEL.
[1:36:40] I AM FULLY trusting and believing that
[1:36:44] he is as good as his word.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to take away and I'm not
[1:36:50] going to add to his word.
[1:36:54] Do you believe it?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Do you really believe it?
[1:36:59] Now, let me say [music] this to you.
[1:37:02] Something begins to change.
[1:37:06] There's a wind of change in here.
[1:37:09] Some of you don't recognize it, but I
[1:37:10] see I see you do. I see you do.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Because you recognize
[1:37:16] it is enough.
[1:37:19] Hallelujah. Let's sing it.
[1:37:23] Hallelujah.
[1:37:25] What am I saying to you, church? [music]
[1:37:27] Get ready for the greatest transition of
[1:37:29] your life. YOU'RE IN LEOSA AND YOU'RE
[1:37:32] DONE. You can't handle it no more.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; HONESTLY, YOUR FLESH is at its
[1:37:37] limitations. But get ready. God says
[1:37:41] it's enough. I done watched Leodysia
[1:37:44] whip you. I done Leodysia. I done
[1:37:46] watched everything that Leodysia can
[1:37:47] throw at you. But it's time for the
[1:37:50] greatest extraction. [music]
[1:37:54] Hallelujah.
[1:37:56] The world seen UFOs.
[1:37:58] THE WORLD SEES JUDGMENTS OUT THERE. But
[1:38:01] we recognize that them angels out there.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; It is enough.
[1:38:08] Do you know that he's worthy?
[1:38:12] Oh, I wish [music] you could hear me. I
[1:38:15] wish you could hear me from my soul. I
[1:38:16] know I didn't say it enough words from
[1:38:18] English language.
[1:38:23] It is enough.
[1:38:26] It is enough.
[1:38:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Father, we feel
[1:38:35] your mighty presence in this place. Lord
[1:38:38] Jesus, we feel you putting the
[1:38:40] limitations on Satan's hold in our life.
[1:38:42] And Father, we just invite you just now
[1:38:45] to come and minister. Father, let your
[1:38:48] August presence just settle over this
[1:38:50] congregation.
[1:38:53] Lord Jesus, may they look away to Jesus
[1:38:56] just now.
[1:38:59] That little woman with the alabaster
[1:39:01] box,
[1:39:02] [snorts]
[1:39:04] she got it doing some bad things, but it
[1:39:06] was enough.
[1:39:08] Hallelujah. When the woman at the well
[1:39:10] left that well that day, what she had
[1:39:13] was more than enough. Father, this
[1:39:15] message is more than enough to put us
[1:39:17] right where we need to be at. Father, I
[1:39:20] pray that you'd [music] stop the hands
[1:39:21] of Satan. Lord, for every need here, for
[1:39:25] brother Matthew that's reeling in pain
[1:39:26] tonight, I pray Lord Jesus, that the
[1:39:30] stripes that you took [music] at Pilot's
[1:39:31] judgment hall, that was more than
[1:39:33] enough. You'd release the very bonds of
[1:39:35] his imprisonment [music] just now in his
[1:39:37] body. for brother Ron. Hallelujah. For
[1:39:41] sister one.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; For brother Jeff.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Oh God. For all the church here. It is
[1:39:47] enough.
[1:39:51] I ain't got to beat you again.
[1:39:54] I ain't got to go to purgatory.
[1:39:57] You paid it.
[1:39:59] I'm not renting it.
[1:40:02] I'm not renting it. Satan, do you hear
[1:40:04] me? [music] You're not living in my mind
[1:40:07] rentree.
[1:40:08] God owns his house.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; God owns my mind. God owns my spirit.
[1:40:13] God owns my soul. And I rebuke the very
[1:40:16] powers of hell.
[1:40:19] Satan,
[1:40:20] remove
[1:40:22] and go from here to yonder in the name
[1:40:25] of Jesus.
[1:40:27] And the church says
[1:40:30] it is enough.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:40:36] Do you have
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Is he worthy [singing]
[1:40:47] of [music]
[1:40:49] this?
[1:40:53] He is. [music]
[1:40:57] Does the Father [music] truly love
[1:41:00] [singing] us?
[1:41:04] Oh hallelujah.
[1:41:06] Does the spirit [music]
[1:41:08] move among us?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And [music and singing]
[1:41:17] does Jesus far
[1:41:21] forever [music and singing]
[1:41:22] those he loves?
[1:41:27] [music]
[1:41:30] Does our God intend [singing and music]
[1:41:33] to dwell again with us?
[1:41:40] [music]
[1:41:45] Is anyone [singing]
[1:41:46] worthy?
[1:41:48] Come on. Oh, [music] is anyone?
[1:41:54] Oh, is anyone [music and singing] able
[1:41:56] to break the sea and open the scroll?
[1:42:02] [music]
[1:42:02] Oh, the lion of Judah.
[1:42:07] Oh, who conquered [singing] the grave.
[1:42:10] [music]
[1:42:12] He is truth and the [singing] lamb who
[1:42:16] died to res [music]
[1:42:18] the slave.
[1:42:21] every people and [singing] tribe,
[1:42:25] [music]
[1:42:26] every nation and tongue.
[1:42:30] He has made us [music] a kingdom and
[1:42:33] praise to God to reign with the son.
[1:42:37] [singing]
[1:42:40] Is he worthy?
[1:42:44] Is he worthy
[1:42:47] [music]
[1:42:49] of all blessing [singing] and honor and
[1:42:52] glory?
[1:42:56] Is he [singing] worthy [music]
[1:43:01] of him?
[1:43:04] Say it. [music]
[1:43:07] One more time. Saying unto him.
[1:43:12] [singing and music]
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] Hallelujah.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:20] Is he [music]
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; from every [music and singing] people
[1:43:26] and child,
[1:43:30] every nation?
[1:43:32] [music]
[1:43:39] [music]
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; You've been waiting for this moment. Go
[1:43:43] ahead. It's enough. Your worship is
[1:43:47] enough. [music]
[1:43:56] [music]
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:48:28] needs an answer [music]
[1:48:33] to the question,

[1:48:58] [music]
[1:49:02] Feel like you [music and singing] wasted
[1:49:05] so much time.
[1:49:11] Want to move [music and singing] ahead,
[1:49:13] but you're still lasting
[1:49:16] life.

[1:50:10] I don't know. [music]
[1:50:16] [music]
[1:50:19] I don't know.
[1:50:23] [music]
[1:50:26] I don't know.
[1:50:28] I don't know. [music]
[1:50:32] It's my way. [music]

[1:50:43] [music]
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to recognize the power of
[1:50:46] this moment right here.
[1:50:48] I was getting ready to leave my house
[1:50:50] and the spirit of God spoke to me this
[1:50:52] song. And I want you to recognize this
[1:50:55] moment. God set up the atmosphere for
[1:50:59] this moment right here.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; I hope you can hear the angels of God as
[1:51:05] brother Matt bumped into an angel and he
[1:51:08] started worshiping. Brother Matt didn't
[1:51:11] pick that song out. The angel OF THE
[1:51:14] LORD PICKED IT OUT FOR THIS ATMOSPHERE.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know who told you.
[1:51:20] I don't know who told you
[1:51:23] that you wouldn't make it. AND I DON'T
[1:51:25] KNOW WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULDN'T TAKE
[1:51:27] IT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD YOU THAT
[1:51:30] IT'S TIME THAT YOU QUIT. But my God,
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you know my GOD OR NOT,
[1:51:37] BUT MY GOD, MY GOD CREATED THE MOONS AND
[1:51:40] THE STARS. MY GOD HAS NEVER GAVE UP. MY
[1:51:44] GOD HAS NEVER LOST THE BATTLE. My God, I
[1:51:48] wonder.
[1:51:50] [music]
[1:51:51] My God said it ain't over.
[1:51:54] until he says it's over.
[1:51:57] [applause and music]
[1:51:58] It [singing] ain't over
[1:52:00] till God says it's [music]
[1:52:03] over.
[1:52:05] And I say that this ain't [singing]
[1:52:10] it ain't over yet. [music]
[1:52:15] It ain't over [singing]
[1:52:17] till God says [music]
[1:52:20] over.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; I say that this
[1:52:28] ain't over [music] yet.
[1:52:32] I don't [singing] know who told you that
[1:52:36] you [music] would not make it. [singing]
[1:52:40] And I don't know who [music] told you.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Just go ahead and
[1:52:49] praise the Lord for a minute. [music]
[1:52:52] Don't take my words.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Take God's words.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; You're free. You're healed. You're
[1:52:59] delivered. It's enough. [music]
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] [music]
[1:53:15] I love [music] you. [singing]
[1:53:18] You
[1:53:24] And I don't know who told [singing]
[1:53:27] you [music]
[1:53:28] it's time.
[1:53:32] But my [music and singing] God says wait
[1:53:36] a
[1:53:39] [music]
[1:53:40] long [singing] time. And I don't know
[1:53:43] who told you that you
[1:53:46] [music and singing] would.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And I don't know
[1:53:52] [music]
[1:53:53] [singing]
[1:53:56] my power and I [music and singing] don't
[1:54:00] know who's hold you.
[1:54:03] It's time [music] you
[1:54:07] but my [singing] God says away.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:54:12] [singing]
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and rejoice and thank the Lord.
[1:54:17] Go ahead.
[1:54:19] [music]
[1:54:25] [music]
[1:54:31] You know the same devil that's telling
[1:54:33] you you can't win. Why don't we tell him
[1:54:34] [music] something back tonight?
[1:54:37] If I can sing this.
[1:54:39] I just
[1:54:45] can't cross the bloodline,
[1:54:50] but I'm covered by his blood.
[1:54:55] [singing]
[1:54:58] You may [music] stare and you may
[1:55:01] [singing] fight, but you're going to
[1:55:04] lose this battle tonight.
[1:55:07] Remember, [music]
[1:55:10] [singing] you can't crawl. Sing that
[1:55:12] chorus again. Why don't you tell the
[1:55:14] devil that's telling you you can't make
[1:55:15] it?
[1:55:17] I just got [singing] to tell Satan
[1:55:20] [music]
[1:55:22] you can't cross the blood line [singing]
[1:55:27] because I'm covered by
[1:55:31] [music]
[1:55:35] you.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; And you may fight, but you're [music]
[1:55:40] going to lose this [singing] battle. And
[1:55:43] I remember
[1:55:47] [music] you can't cross more time.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; I just [singing] got to tell you, Satan,
[1:55:59] you can't cross [music and singing] the
[1:56:01] bloodline
[1:56:04] because I'm covered by
[1:56:07] [music and singing] his blood.
[1:56:12] You may [music]
[1:56:16] know you're going [singing] to lose this
[1:56:19] battle of life.
[1:56:22] [music]
[1:56:24] You can't cross [singing]
[1:56:26] the blood.
[1:56:28] How many's thankful for that tonight?
