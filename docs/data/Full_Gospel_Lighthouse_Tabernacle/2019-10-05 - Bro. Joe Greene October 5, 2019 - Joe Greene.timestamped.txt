[1:51] I had hair

[2:05] brought us through it and we're just so
[2:07] so grateful for that amen we've kind of
[2:11] grown up together and the things of the
[2:13] Lord and ministry and we certainly do
[2:15] appreciate God's goodness to both of us
[2:17] yeah amen just I'd like to give just a
[2:21] little bit of report if it's okay from
[2:23] our our camp meeting and since our camp
[2:26] meeting we have been here with you over
[2:28] Labor Day and we certainly enjoyed the
[2:30] meetings here just tremendous time and
[2:33] the presence of the Lord and the Word of
[2:36] God was just absolutely rich rich rich
[2:39] and I know you're still ruminating on
[2:42] that and man if you're not you need to
[2:44] yeah man because I tell you the services
[2:47] were just tremendous but back to camp
[2:50] meeting this year we had brother Ron
[2:53] speak of course and brother Tom ray and
[2:57] we certainly enjoyed the ministry there
[2:59] plus the Missionary brothers in the
[3:01] mornings and just some wonderful times
[3:04] and as you know we have the meetings and
[3:07] we collect funds for
[3:09] missionary work and whenever the
[3:12] brothers come from overseas they bring
[3:14] their requests and their needs and
[3:17] amounts that they need to help build
[3:20] churches put roofs on churches windows
[3:22] doors whatever the needs might be to buy
[3:25] motorbikes or transportation for the
[3:28] Brethren to get about and preach the
[3:30] gospel and this year we were presented
[3:33] with over 460 thousand dollars worth of
[3:36] liens yeah that's a lot of me
[3:40] what minute wait a minute let me finish
[3:43] we had that many requests brother Joey I
[3:46] need this much but the Joey I need this
[3:47] much but the joy I need this much but
[3:50] the Lord gave us two hundred nine
[3:53] thousand two hundred and fifty two
[3:55] dollars now
[4:07] and ever ever sin of that will go to
[4:09] foreign missions as we tell we don't
[4:12] even take the postage or the wire
[4:15] transfer fees or anything out of that we
[4:17] we take care of that as a local church
[4:19] and we just thank God for what he has
[4:22] done and there's gonna be many little
[4:24] churches that'll have a roof over their
[4:26] heads they'll have a building to worship
[4:29] the Lord in and I just like to tell this
[4:32] several years ago several trips back we
[4:35] were in the Philippines and we were in a
[4:37] certain place and it just happened to be
[4:39] my birthday in February and a little
[4:42] brother come up to me brother Vernon he
[4:45] said billy joel he said would you pray
[4:48] that the Lord will help me to be able to
[4:51] put some walls around my church he said
[4:53] all I have is a that's roof and some
[4:57] poles stuck how would you like to go to
[4:59] church there so he said you pray with me
[5:02] that the Lord will will help provide
[5:04] funds to put her walls on my church and
[5:07] I asked him through the interpreter I
[5:09] said brother how much would it take to
[5:11] footballs on your church and he
[5:14] calculated in his head and then the
[5:16] brother translated the amount and come
[5:18] out to be a hundred and twenty US
[5:20] dollars oh yeah
[5:22] so guess what I did I bought myself a
[5:24] birthday present put walls on that
[5:28] church amen so if they don't ask for a
[5:32] lot compared to other things but you
[5:37] know the Bible teaches us that little as
[5:40] much how I see and I believe that is
[5:44] brother Ron talk about my dad he taught
[5:46] me very well
[5:47] Amen that you the more you plant the
[5:50] more you reap and I'm not in it to reap
[5:53] this evening but I know it's whether Tim
[5:56] Freud preached here a few years ago God
[5:59] keeps a record amen and there is an
[6:02] accounting they coming a man and he's
[6:04] going to hand out rewards and I want to
[6:07] do everything I can to get all the
[6:09] rewards I can get
[6:10] so I can cast my crowns at the feet of
[6:13] the Lord Jesus amen so we thank God for
[6:16] His blessings and thank you all that
[6:18] we're able to be there and those that
[6:20] that couldn't be there and wanted to be
[6:22] there thank you as well because he had a
[6:24] heart to be there amen also I'd like for
[6:29] sister ex in the stand she'll deal with
[6:33] me later I have been accused of having
[6:38] another wife yeah and she is another
[6:44] girl compared to what she was a few
[6:46] months ago we thank god she's had a
[6:48] couple of surgeries this year and as
[6:51] brother ron has already said she's she's
[6:53] getting about better than she has and I
[6:55] have quite a few years and slimmer and
[6:59] trimmer and more beautiful as the day
[7:01] goes by and man and I thank God for my
[7:04] good wife this
[7:06] [Applause]
[7:07] [Music]
[7:15] and also before we go to the word just
[7:17] one more thing sister Tanya that's
[7:19] saying when she was born she was born
[7:22] with a cleft palate inside and the
[7:25] doctors had to go in and put that
[7:28] together repair that and it was a pretty
[7:31] major deal and you you would think she
[7:34] had a cleft palate and can sing like
[7:37] that it's just the hand of God amen
[7:42] dad was on an airplane we went somewhere
[7:43] sometime after she had the surgery and
[7:45] the repair was done and and sat down
[7:48] beside this distinguished-looking
[7:49] gentleman and began to make some
[7:52] conversation as you do sometimes on an
[7:54] airplane and come to find out this guy
[7:57] was a doctor and he was a doctor from
[7:59] Duke University and dad began to say
[8:02] well I had a granddaughter that had a
[8:04] surgery there and well what was her name
[8:06] and what kind of surgery he said well
[8:08] she had a cleft palate and the doctor
[8:11] there repaired that he said well what is
[8:14] her name and he told her I told the
[8:16] doctor and he said you know I'm the
[8:18] doctor that did that surgery and he sat
[8:21] down on a piece of paper and drew
[8:22] exactly what he did and what he how he
[8:24] repaired it and that give dad has a
[8:27] proud grandpa an opportunity to thank
[8:30] him personally for what he did for Tanya

[8:57] can see your great hand of mercy that's
[8:59] been extended your blessings Lord that
[9:02] you have bestowed upon us so abundantly
[9:05] and free and father tonight Lord we
[9:08] stand here in this sacred place and Lord
[9:11] you see this afternoon is I've tried to
[9:14] get the butterflies in sequence and in
[9:16] line and the nerves Lord but I pray
[9:20] father that you would just calm the
[9:22] nerves tonight Lord and you would just
[9:24] help me to step aside this evening
[9:26] because I realize Lord in myself I can
[9:31] say nothing or do nothing that will be
[9:33] of eternal benefit for these precious
[9:36] people of God but Lord if I could just
[9:40] get out of the way in you my vessel to
[9:42] you lourdes as a microphone and man and
[9:45] put myself in your hands and let you
[9:48] come tonight lord and speak through
[9:50] these lips of clay what needs to be said
[9:53] about that's my desire tonight that you
[9:56] would speak through me lord not only
[9:58] that but that you would hear through the
[10:00] people tonight Lord that we can be drawn
[10:02] just a little bit closer to you as a
[10:04] result of being in this service tonight
[10:06] let's our fellowship together Lord let
[10:08] your word find a lodging place in every
[10:10] heart and every life we pray this
[10:12] evening in the precious name of our Lord
[10:15] Jesus Christ we humbly pray and all the
[10:18] saints said before you're seated this
[10:22] evening we'd like to read from the book
[10:24] of Nehemiah and that if you have a
[10:28] Scofield Bible is page 541 it's right
[10:34] after Ezra and right before Esther I
[10:39] believe it is in the Old Testament you
[10:44] don't hear very very much out of
[10:46] Nehemiah but you're going to tonight
[10:50] amen
[10:51] verse number 11 we want to read before
[10:53] you have your seats Oh Lord I beseech
[11:00] thee let now thine ear be attentive to
[11:04] the prayer of thy servants and to the
[11:07] prayer of thy servants who desire to
[11:11] fear thy name and to prosper I pray thee
[11:17] thy servant this day and grant him mercy
[11:21] in the sight of this man for I was the
[11:27] king's cup bearer a man may the Lord at
[11:32] his blessings to the reading of the word
[11:34] tonight as you have your seats
[11:39] I'd like to read a little something that
[11:42] I've read the other day and it's this
[11:44] guy reporting of an event that happened
[11:48] in his life he said last week I went to
[11:50] a restaurant I saw it had a Wi-Fi
[11:54] service so I asked for the password and
[11:58] the waitress told me eat first so I
[12:03] placed my order after eating I again ask
[12:07] for the password and again she told me
[12:11] eat first feeling frustrated I ordered
[12:15] some black coffee after coffee I asked
[12:18] once more for the password they told me
[12:21] eat first then angrily I walked to the
[12:24] restaurant manager and asked for the
[12:26] password he replied ate first I was
[12:33] about to explode when I finally saw a
[12:37] sign on the wall that said Wi-Fi
[12:39] password eat first
[12:47] now this exemplifies or makes real to
[12:52] you and I how most of us are waiting for
[12:55] an answer from God after we have prayed
[12:57] and sometimes the Lord is showing us
[13:00] what he's saying to us he's showing us
[13:03] an open door but we keep asking for
[13:05] direction amen we have a young brother
[13:09] in our church that just preached his
[13:12] last or not his last his first sermon
[13:15] last Sunday night and he's 46 47 years
[13:20] old been running from the calling from
[13:23] the Lord for a good long while amen and
[13:26] and and the the signs have been there
[13:28] but he's just not been willing to follow
[13:32] amen and that's the way many of us are
[13:34] many times God has given us the answer
[13:37] where's the answer at brother Joe
[13:41] it's right here in his word amen he's
[13:45] opened the door for us so we're just
[13:47] praying tonight may the Holy Spirit
[13:49] guide us and open our spiritual insight
[13:51] amen to discern the answers to our
[13:54] prayers cause many times he answers them
[13:56] right before our eyes and we fail to
[13:59] recognize it tonight amen
[14:01] now what I want to speak on this evening
[14:03] for just a little bit by the help of the
[14:05] Lord is depend on God I want you to
[14:11] understand you can't depend on a man you
[14:15] can't depend as much as your pastor
[14:18] loves you as much as he does for you as
[14:20] much as he wants to see you blessed and
[14:23] wants to see you prosper I want you to
[14:24] realize you can't depend on him amen
[14:28] because somewhere along the line he's
[14:30] gonna not be able to come at your beck
[14:33] and call he's not gonna be able brother
[14:35] Jim to - to give you what you're looking
[14:38] for and he's gonna let you down
[14:44] praise the Lord because why he's a man
[14:47] now I'm not saying that he's not caring
[14:50] for you is not the concern about you he
[14:53] is a man but you know he you may call
[14:55] and say brother on I need you to come by
[14:57] and talk to me a little bit and he has a
[14:59] flat tire on the way and he can't get
[15:00] there that's what I'm talking about this
[15:02] evening there are circumstances a man
[15:05] that will cause him to let you down
[15:08] unintentionally undesired but as a man
[15:11] circumstances happened this evening
[15:13] Amen so we've got to understand a man
[15:16] that although man will let us down God
[15:19] will never fail us this evening
[15:21] God will never let us down he will never
[15:24] forsake us amen he said I will be with
[15:28] you even in you even to the end of the
[15:30] way tonight amen how near my the writer
[15:35] here are the one that this story is
[15:37] about this evening he was in a place a
[15:41] man he was the king's cup bearer he was
[15:44] writing there in the throne room he was
[15:47] the one Amen that tasted the Kings drink
[15:50] or or tasted his wine before the king
[15:53] drank out
[15:54] it Amen so that the king can know that
[15:57] there was no poison in it because it
[15:59] didn't kill the cupbearer I can drink it
[16:01] now amen he would bring a drink to the
[16:04] King amen and that's what a God is
[16:07] desiring for you and I to do tonight is
[16:09] to bring a drink of praise and worship
[16:12] amen and adoration to the King of Kings
[16:15] a seaman and Lord of lords amen he was
[16:18] in a position of prestige because he
[16:21] wouldn't let just anybody be your cup
[16:23] bearer amen especially in that time
[16:27] frame a man they had to have somebody
[16:30] that they can trust and I want you to
[16:32] understand the night Amen you may think
[16:35] you're nothing you may think you're not
[16:36] the best at what God's called you to do
[16:38] you may think you're a nobody
[16:40] Amen but I want you to understand God
[16:42] has put confidence in you
[16:45] Amen God has put trust in you that you
[16:48] would bring him a drink this evening
[16:51] it wouldn't be poison but it would be a
[16:53] true worship and spirit and in truth
[16:56] tonight amen
[16:58] now in this position where and Nehemiah
[17:03] was said and we're going to maybe look
[17:05] at a few things here by the help of the
[17:06] Lord tonight amen but he he had a
[17:09] position that he he could bend the Kings
[17:12] ear a little bit you know he could talk
[17:15] to the King and he could he could speak
[17:17] to him a man because he was there in
[17:19] that position
[17:21] amen and I want you to understand Amen
[17:23] God puts you in a position that he wants
[17:26] you to be in tonight Amen he opens doors
[17:28] for you
[17:29] Amen sometimes a man let me just give an
[17:33] example many years ago I needed a job
[17:36] a man and and I just didn't know what to
[17:39] do I'd exhausted all of my unemployment
[17:41] I've done everything I could do to try
[17:43] to start a business and do my own thing
[17:45] and it just wouldn't work out I needed a
[17:48] job hey man so I got wind and was told
[17:50] about a position in a drugstore amen and
[17:54] you may have heard this before but hear
[17:55] it one more time tonight a man and when
[17:58] I got that call brother Joe you're
[18:00] you're needing a job here's an
[18:02] opportunity would you like to be the
[18:04] janitor of the
[18:05] drug store in my mind I thought no I
[18:08] really wouldn't but as as we can finish
[18:15] the conversation and and I was going to
[18:17] hang up the phone I heard a voice that
[18:19] said what if I arranged this for you
[18:22] amen so I picked up the phone by the run
[18:25] I called her back I said when can I come
[18:27] for the interview and I worked there for
[18:29] 23 years never missed a day's pay had
[18:34] the insurance from me and my family Amen
[18:37] God provided everytime I get ready to go
[18:39] to the mission field the owner would
[18:40] come around stick some money in my hand
[18:42] and say here we don't want you to get
[18:44] stranded that's his way of saying I want
[18:46] to help you with your mission trip Amen
[18:48] god bless me in that position I had a
[18:51] key for up to the business from day one
[18:53] to the day I left a man I could come and
[18:56] go as I please Amen God was good to me
[18:59] God arranged that he opened the door
[19:01] amen and I would sit up and say no I
[19:03] don't want to walk in it but God said I
[19:06] have arranged this for you this evening
[19:08] amen now sometimes we don't want to see
[19:11] God what God arranges but God has the
[19:14] best plans tonight amen praise the Lord
[19:19] now Nehemiah was in this position
[19:27] where'd he go
[19:29] nehemiah was in this position because
[19:32] God had placed him there it was a time
[19:36] whenever they were in bondage to this
[19:40] current government a man they had been
[19:42] taken captive a man because of their
[19:45] rebellion because they had got away from
[19:47] God and God's in another country another
[19:49] nation in and and took them captive took
[19:52] them prisoners and took them back to the
[19:54] homeland and there they were but thence
[19:57] God amen worked through that King and
[20:00] placed the amah in this position because
[20:03] God look down the line and he saw there
[20:07] was going to be a restoration and there
[20:10] had to be a way to fund that restoration
[20:12] there had to be somebody a man that had
[20:16] a connection tonight a man that could
[20:18] get the support needed to rebuild the
[20:21] city of Jerusalem now once you'd
[20:23] understand
[20:24] Amen God is building his church in this
[20:26] hour Amen he's building it stone upon
[20:29] stone upon stone and he's got to have
[20:31] some people tonight that are willing to
[20:34] be part of that building that God is
[20:37] willing tonight amen and who is that
[20:39] that's you and that's me this evening
[20:42] amen
[20:45] now you know you wonder sometimes why am
[20:49] I where I am just like little Esther is
[20:53] in the next book over a man Mordecai
[20:56] told her maybe God raised you for such a
[20:59] time as this maybe God puts you in that
[21:03] classroom sister Whitney Amen so that
[21:06] you could be an example to those kids
[21:08] maybe God put my daughter-in-law in an
[21:10] in a classroom so she could've helped
[21:12] some of those kids a mentor to guide
[21:15] them amen where they don't get it at
[21:17] home or they don't get it in their
[21:19] support Amen somebody Amen has got to be
[21:22] a witness this evening a man so God's
[21:25] got you there in that position for a
[21:28] reason he knows exactly what he's doing
[21:31] tonight you might say well I don't know
[21:33] why I'm here I don't even know how I got
[21:35] this position
[21:37] Amen but God has a way Amen that passed
[21:40] our finding out tonight and he knows
[21:43] exactly what he's doing this evening
[21:46] amen oh yeah my was there and one day he
[21:57] had a little sadness in his heart
[22:00] maybe that went on for a week or two and
[22:04] finally one day the King looked at he
[22:06] was said let me just put it in my terms
[22:10] Nehemiah what's wrong we've away you've
[22:15] been sad you've been down you've been

[42:36] washes those evil spirits away tonight
[42:39] amen you might say what brother Joe it's
[42:40] a simple message but listen the one said

[43:40] sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
[43:44] you know it takes a little more than
[43:46] that
[43:48] if you're gonna slay Philistines if
[43:52] you're gonna slay Devils it takes a
[43:55] little more to be able to wield the
[43:57] sword of the word this evening amen
[44:05] Psalms 132 Lord hear my voice let thine
[44:09] ears be attentive to the voice of my
[44:12] supplications now we go back to Nehemiah
[44:15] when he spoke to the king listen he
[44:18] didn't come out and say O king my
[44:22] peoples in distress my city is falling

[44:28] just hit his head hard he had a burden
[44:31] on his heart he had something that was
[44:35] weighing heavy on his mind and bulging
[44:39] when the King saw that gene why are you
[44:46] so heavy hearted why are you why are you
[44:49] dumb cast he was concerned about his
[44:53] servant a man you you think God don't

[45:28] let thine ears be attentive to the voice
[45:30] of my supplications as we said Nehemiah

[45:43] that as the last line of that verse for
[45:47] I was the king's cup bearer because it
[45:54] lets us
[45:54] see tonight Amen that no matter where
[45:57] we're at God is mindful and God is
[46:02] concerned about our situations he was in
[46:06] a position financially no doubt he was

[50:30] then go I'm in trouble
[50:33] in other words but that's ok I've lived
[50:42] with it for 41 years I think we can make
[50:44] it a few more you know it's hard to be a
[50:55] preacher's family sister Connie agrees
[51:00] with that one thing because they see the
[51:05] stress that their loved one is going
[51:08] through they see the hardships of
[51:11] dealing with the world amen they see the
[51:19] difficulties and the stress when we get
[51:25] ready to preach our nerves are shocked
[51:29] stomachs rolling you know it's just not
[51:34] a pleasant place to be and then you know
[51:42] we live with them so their choice
[51:45] material for examples but you know God
[51:53] lives with you and that's why he's given
[51:59] us examples in his word because he's
[52:02] seen people and we're people he had
[52:07] people in those days a man that that had
[52:11] situations and had circumstances and he
[52:14] had men for the herald that he could
[52:16] speak through tonight a man that
[52:18] couldn't write down some things and and
[52:20] help us to know how to avoid situations
[52:23] amen I may get back to my notes here I
[52:28] don't want to keep you a favorite length
[52:31] of time than that but Nehemiah was this
[52:35] cutberto King r-texas of Persia and when
[52:40] he was sad before the king as we've
[52:42] already mentioned them out
[52:43] he was so near all mightiness before the
[52:49] king that he could pray and move the
[52:52] heavens he can move the king and he
[52:59] could move the world until Jerusalem was
[53:03] restored and I want you to understand
[53:07] the night you are so near the king
[53:11] Almighty God because why you're his wife
[53:16] you're his chosen one amen when Esther
[53:20] came before the king listen she was
[53:22] hadn't been bitten for thirty days amen
[53:25] but the Jewish people were in trouble

[53:32] death threat from Haman the wicked one a
[53:35] man and she was told by Mordecai ax you
[53:39] were perhaps place here for such a time
[53:43] as this God's gonna deliver his people
[53:49] Mordecai had a positive attitude God's
[53:52] gonna deliver his people hey man but
[53:55] maybe he's gonna use you to do it
[53:58] tonight there may be a sinner down your
[54:00] job there may be a sinner in your
[54:02] neighborhood and God's gonna use you to
[54:04] lead them to the truth tonight to lead
[54:06] him to cries amen we don't know what
[54:08] God's gonna do we just need to be
[54:10] vessels in the hand of God this evening
[54:18] Mordecai told her maybe God raised you
[54:20] up for this purpose maybe God put you
[54:23] here and whenever she walked through the
[54:26] doors of the court that day and the king
[54:30] was sitting on his throne
[54:33] and it was contemplating maybe his next
[54:36] battle or his next adventure
[54:38] and he looked there maybe when she come
[54:50] through the guard said where's your
[54:52] invitation but I'm coming to see the
[55:00] king listen to my friend Amen she may
[55:04] not have had an invitation but you do

[55:15] youth meeting the other week Sunday
[55:18] afternoon we didn't have no evening in
[55:20] service so a lot of the saints just hung
[55:21] around the fellowship hall and began to
[55:23] worship and sing songs and rejoice and
[55:25] praise the Lord and all of a sudden the
[55:27] Holy Ghost fell and they began to have a
[55:29] hallelujah do you believe it don't mind
[55:32] you don't have to be in church to get
[55:33] into the presence of God you don't have
[55:35] to be a man I listening to a message of
[55:37] the Prophet you can enter in his
[55:39] presence
[55:40] anytime you so desire this evening and
[55:43] Esther came to the door and when he saw
[55:45] her Amen she knew it was death to come
[55:48] into the presence of the King and listen
[55:49] I I want you to understand it was death
[55:51] for her if the King did not extend that
[55:54] scepter but to you and I its life to
[55:57] sing then to come into his presence amen
[56:00] and rejoice and receive the benefit of
[56:03] that golden scepter that he has extended
[56:06] to us tonight amen if we will just come
[56:08] there and say my king my husband my
[56:12] lover my friend
[56:14] I need a petition before you this
[56:18] evening

[56:27] just like Nehemiah had the ear of the
[56:30] king I want you to realize you've not
[56:34] only got his ear but you've got his
[56:35] heart

[57:06] he love us and they showed him the
[57:09] picture where he stretched out his arms
[57:11] this much was hanging on the cross he
[57:15] loved us this much a man and listen if
[57:18] he loved us enough but did you have to
[57:19] die for us oh my what would he do amen
[57:24] if we just let him live within us
[57:26] tonight amen as I said dear Bob received
[57:38] letters from the King chapter 2 verse 8
[57:42] of Nehemiah a letter to ACF to keep her
[57:44] the King's forest that he may give me
[57:46] timber to make beans for the gates of
[57:49] the palace which entertained to the
[57:50] house and for the wall of the city for
[57:52] the house that I shall enter into and
[57:53] the King granted me according to the
[57:57] good hand of my god upon me a man he
[58:01] went down to the lumber yard of King
[58:04] Artaxerxes and said I need 348 for
[58:10] befores three thousand and ninety two
[58:13] two by twos are two befores and thirty
[58:18] thousand brick whatever it was he needed

[58:37] thee

[58:41] alright
[58:44] near mom 1 through 11 if you read the
[58:47] whole story near my was living in luxury
[58:49] in the Persian kings palace his heart
[58:52] was sensitive to the needs of the people
[58:54] he turned them from tears to prayer and
[58:59] from man to God it shows that when we on
[59:04] an individual basis deal more or or or
[59:09] spend more time with God then our
[59:12] dealings with men will be much more
[59:15] successful amen because what didn't he
[59:20] Amaya do he prayed
[59:22] God give me favor before this King give
[59:29] me favor before this King because I
[59:32] don't have the resources to do it I
[59:34] don't have the ability to do it
[59:36] give me favor with one that does have
[59:39] the ability and does have the means
[59:41] listen to my friend he has given you
[59:44] favor before the King of Kings is

[59:49] partakers of this gospel of this
[59:51] glorious salvation he has made us meet
[59:54] tonight
[59:55] Amen Nehemiah's prayer was so beautiful
[1:00:00] because it was saturated with God's own
[1:00:03] word
[1:00:04] I mean remembers when brother Branham
[1:00:06] was so blind that he had glasses as
[1:00:09] thick as coke bottles in his stomach was
[1:00:12] so eat up with ulcers that he couldn't
[1:00:14] eat nothing you know what he did God
[1:00:20] your word says that by your stripes I'm
[1:00:24] healed your word says that you will put
[1:00:30] none of these diseases upon me that you
[1:00:32] put upon the Egyptians and he said Lord

[1:00:37] for supper cornbread and beans son fix
[1:00:42] me a bowl

[1:00:53] doctor said but God said by His stripes
[1:00:56] I'm healed fix me the beans and
[1:01:00] cornbread and he ate him and they come
[1:01:06] back ate him again and they come back
[1:01:15] and he ate him again and they stayed
[1:01:20] down because he took God at His Word and
[1:01:25] listen he could drive a tack with a 22
[1:01:29] rifle time and time and time and time
[1:01:32] again without glasses how are we tonight
[1:01:46] to remind him of his promises when we

[1:10:14] and remember he's God in flesh he is the
[1:10:20] word made flesh amen
[1:10:23] and he knew by living in this earth and
[1:10:27] foremost being God that it wasn't season
[1:10:33] for figs and he went to that fig tree he
[1:10:38] parted the leaves knowing that it was a
[1:10:43] season for figs but he knew he created
[1:10:48] that and he was looking for it to have
[1:10:52] figs and it didn't have any and he said

[1:12:52] power that is within you tonight oh we

[1:14:00] it's going to be there when I reach to
[1:14:02] get it he said even if I left it laying
[1:14:06] on the dresser in the room when I
[1:14:09] reached my hand in my pocket and
[1:14:10] believing that it will be there it will
[1:14:13] be there amen went to pray for the
[1:14:20] little girl and he asked her do you have
[1:14:22] faith yes brother I got faith he said
[1:14:25] you see that light locking him that
[1:14:28] light switch he said make it move back
[1:14:30] and forth Wow brother branham I can't do
[1:14:33] that nobody can I can't
[1:14:36] brother branham just watch focused his
[1:14:41] eyes on it
[1:14:51] and he showed her what real faith was
[1:14:55] real faith real faith tonight is
[1:15:02] believing what ain't as though it is my
[1:15:09] sister used to work at the drugstore
[1:15:11] with us and she would come by my office
[1:15:14] sometimes she'd be in a desperate
[1:15:16] situation and she'd say brother Joe I
[1:15:19] want you to agree with me that God will
[1:15:21] do a certain thing and we would shake
[1:15:24] hands I say Pat God's Word said if any
[1:15:27] two or three would agree is touching any
[1:15:30] thing and believe it that it would be
[1:15:33] done let's to agree together and we
[1:15:37] agreed and you can ask her a number of
[1:15:41] things that we agreed on just by that
[1:15:43] simple act of - agreeing God did it for
[1:15:47] her in her situation amen oh brother Joe
[1:15:52] that's too simple see I told you God was
[1:15:55] simple amen he don't want to make
[1:16:00] himself so deep in dark and mysterious
[1:16:02] that you can't although he is deep and
[1:16:06] and and and mysterious and the mystical
[1:16:10] God amen but yet he wants to condescend
[1:16:13] down to where you can understand that
[1:16:17] that that he cares for you and he wants
[1:16:20] to help you he wants to bring you
[1:16:22] through your situations he wants to give
[1:16:24] you mercy and give you healing and give
[1:16:26] you victory and give you deliverance and
[1:16:28] it may come in the most simplistic form
[1:16:31] that you wouldn't even think about it's
[1:16:36] just like in my job situation I've told
[1:16:38] you about earlier I never thought about
[1:16:40] going to a place to work and be a
[1:16:42] janitor I didn't know all of the
[1:16:44] people's trash out
[1:16:47] but in simplicity God said what if I
[1:16:50] arranged this for you and I want you to
[1:16:53] understand I never lost a day's pay in
[1:16:57] 23 years the only time I lost pay was
[1:17:01] when I did
[1:17:02] ducted my hours when I had to go do
[1:17:04] something for the church or for brother
[1:17:06] day and her daddy for you which it was
[1:17:07] amen and when the boss men saw it and
[1:17:10] when I had him to sign off on the time
[1:17:13] sheet to turn in
[1:17:14] he said why why is your hours less and
[1:17:17] than 40 I said well because such and
[1:17:20] such and such he said don't do that
[1:17:21] again and for 23 years I never lost a
[1:17:26] day's pay
[1:17:32] that's my god Romans for 19 20 now I'm
[1:17:39] trying to get done here and being not
[1:17:41] weak in faith he considered not his own
[1:17:43] body now dead when he was about in
[1:17:45] hundred years old neither yet the
[1:17:47] deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered
[1:17:48] not at the promise of God through
[1:17:51] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[1:17:53] glory to God
[1:17:54] a man James 1 and 6 but let him ask in
[1:17:58] faith nothing wavering for he that waver
[1:18:01] earth is like a wave of the sea driven
[1:18:03] with the wind and tossed God don't want
[1:18:06] us to be driven and tossed a night he
[1:18:10] wants us to stand flat-footed and say
[1:18:12] Lord you said it I believe it I accept
[1:18:14] it I receive it and I'm walking into it
[1:18:17] I showed you my demonstration of faith
[1:18:20] while ago
[1:18:20] listen I'm walking towards that I wish I
[1:18:29] could put a picture up on the screen to
[1:18:31] show you how much hair I did have so you
[1:18:35] know me when you see me where the random
[1:18:48] tells us he says and you can't say one
[1:18:53] word to God unless he knows it the
[1:18:57] weakest of sinked makes the devil's
[1:19:00] tremble I know we all have these
[1:19:07] thoughts we feel like we're the weakest
[1:19:09] link in the chain but if you feel like
[1:19:13] you're the weakest Christian
[1:19:15] just remember you make the devil tremble
[1:19:21] because you're a Christian you may be
[1:19:24] weak but learn II but that don't matter
[1:19:28] when you set your foot off the bed his
[1:19:31] brother Don he says and the devil sees
[1:19:34] you throw the cover back oh god not
[1:19:37] again even though you think you're the
[1:19:41] weakest you still make the devil's
[1:19:45] tremble and you're his children you have
[1:19:51] you fully with all your hearts he's
[1:19:54] gonna be fully laid your life before God
[1:19:55] and said God mold me to the kind of
[1:19:58] Christian that's been talked about here

[1:20:03] wrong and make tonight home I'm going by
[1:20:07] your grace I'll live everyday for you
[1:20:09] watching for my life to pattern right up
[1:20:11] with that of the Bible requirements one
[1:20:17] day the Queen of Sheba came to Solomon
[1:20:19] because she had heard of his wisdom and
[1:20:23] when she got there she testified as
[1:20:26] brother Adam would say it what did she
[1:20:29] say did she want a class in Beelzebub
[1:20:32] certainly not she stood right out being
[1:20:34] a pagan pagan heathen stood right out
[1:20:37] amongst all the people and said all that
[1:20:39] I have heard amongst all that I've heard
[1:20:43] has been the truth and more than I've
[1:20:45] heard before she'd seen it with her own
[1:20:47] eyes and the miracle had been performed
[1:20:49] before on her and she said blessed is
[1:20:52] the man that stands here by you by you
[1:20:54] day by day to see these things which are
[1:20:57] associated with you that stand in your
[1:20:59] presence and to see great works of the
[1:21:01] Living God
[1:21:02] listen blessed are you where's brother
[1:21:05] Dennis that right there he is right
[1:21:06] there brother Dennis
[1:21:12] brother Doug I'm sorry forgive me would
[1:21:14] you stand brother Doug you've seen a man
[1:21:20] that was lifeless laid back his eyes
[1:21:27] rolled back if I remember the story
[1:21:28] correctly no life

[1:21:36] miracle babies you have seen great
[1:21:41] things you've seen a man that was brain
[1:21:45] dead for 36 hours
[1:21:46] the doctor is fixing to cut him open and
[1:21:48] take his heart and his lungs and his
[1:21:50] organs and give them to somebody else
[1:21:55] but this same God that we can depend on
[1:21:59] tonight what did he do
[1:22:01] he said life and activity back to a
[1:22:06] brain that was dead he give life to a
[1:22:11] womb multiple wounds that didn't have no
[1:22:15] life
[1:22:16] he took a man that was crushed amen and
[1:22:20] the doctor said it's impossible I want
[1:22:26] to tell you something the doctors told
[1:22:28] my dad Reverend green don't you let that
[1:22:31] little woman have no more children that
[1:22:33] was after my sister above me was born
[1:22:36] because mom had such a hard time don't
[1:22:38] let her have no more children but God
[1:22:41] dealt with him and he had me
[1:22:46] and in the delivery room I was breached
[1:22:50] birth and the doctor said well Reverend
[1:22:52] green it looks like it's a 50/50 chance
[1:22:54] we'll lose the baby and your wife dad
[1:22:58] went down the hallway to the chapel got
[1:23:00] on his knees and cried out to God and
[1:23:02] and he come back and the doctor come out
[1:23:04] and said Reverend green you got a fine
[1:23:06] bouncy baby boy and your wife's alright
[1:23:14] why did that happen because I had to be
[1:23:16] here tonight to testify to you that you
[1:23:19] can depend upon God
[1:23:21] you can put your confidence in him if he
[1:23:24] tells you something if he tells you
[1:23:30] something he will perform it if he
[1:23:35] whisper something in your ear what if I
[1:23:38] pray what if I arranged this for you he
[1:23:40] will do it he will take care of you amen
[1:23:44] he will provide for you we've just got
[1:23:46] to depend upon him tonight and accept
[1:23:50] what he has said because he never has
[1:23:52] failed me or you yet tonight hallelujah
[1:24:06] you remember I made a statement a few
[1:24:08] minutes ago when we spend more time with
[1:24:11] God in prayer and study then Italy
[1:24:15] reflected in those around us Solomon
[1:24:19] when he built the temple and it was
[1:24:23] placed as king he said Oh God
[1:24:26] I don't know how to go in and come out
[1:24:30] before this people I don't know how to
[1:24:32] handle this job and listen I heard
[1:24:35] somewhere just recently when David was
[1:24:37] on his deathbed and he called Solomon in
[1:24:41] and he under where was his brother Danny
[1:24:44] brother Andrew he called him in there
[1:24:46] and and he said now Solomon he said your
[1:24:51] your full-grown you're a grown man and
[1:24:56] you're fixing the step in the position
[1:24:57] that's gonna take it's gonna take a
[1:25:01] grown man to handle it and Solomon knew
[1:25:05] that even as a grown man he couldn't do
[1:25:07] it on his own and he bowed his head and
[1:25:10] said Oh God
[1:25:11] I don't know how to handle this job I
[1:25:13] don't know what to do or what to say or
[1:25:15] how to deal with this people that you've
[1:25:17] given me charge of he said help me a man
[1:25:21] that God said because you've asked this
[1:25:23] and not for riches and fame and fortune
[1:25:26] he said not only will I give you your
[1:25:28] heart's desire to be able to have wisdom
[1:25:30] and and knowledge before the people but
[1:25:33] I'll also give you riches and fame and
[1:25:36] fortune and listen Solomon was the
[1:25:38] greatest king of Israel until Jesus
[1:25:41] Christ King the natural life must become
[1:25:49] helplessness until the life of Christ
[1:25:53] strengthens the natural life the only
[1:25:58] way to go into fullness with God is for
[1:26:01] the life of Christ to follow up the
[1:26:03] natural to swallow up the natural life I
[1:26:09] love me just one more little little
[1:26:12] story my dad and Uncle Albert used to
[1:26:15] get together and pray
[1:26:17] young preachers young Christians studied
[1:26:20] the Word of God
[1:26:21] night after night and grandpa lived out
[1:26:23] the street from local Albert their dad
[1:26:26] and grandfather would see their light
[1:26:29] Uncle Albert slide alone two or three
[1:26:30] o'clock in the morning and he worked
[1:26:34] with dad at the venire meal there and
[1:26:37] and he coming in and he said Henner he
[1:26:40] never could say Henry he said hinter he
[1:26:43] said what were you and Albert doing at
[1:26:46] two o'clock in the morning said I seen
[1:26:48] your car there dad said well daddy said
[1:26:53] we were praying and reading the Bible
[1:26:55] and studying getting close to God and
[1:26:59] grandpa being just a simple sharecropper
[1:27:03] with a simple understanding he said you
[1:27:06] know said son said I've heard people
[1:27:08] lose their mind when they read that
[1:27:09] Bible too much and by the way daddy
[1:27:15] answered him and said daddy said that's
[1:27:17] what we want to do we want to lose our
[1:27:20] mind and get the mind of Christ and if
[1:27:23] we tonight brother Danny will lose our
[1:27:25] mind and get the mind of Christ amen
[1:27:28] things will go a whole lot better for us
[1:27:30] tonight a man stand with me this evening

[1:28:40] can depend on him I know tonight that
