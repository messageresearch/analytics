[1:02:49] last night brother Isaiah came and gave

[1:02:54] nervous sister Julie said he rolled in
[1:02:57] bed all night the night before and she
[1:02:59] said what's the matter with you and
[1:03:02] he well you did well brother Isaiah and

[1:03:12] you
[1:03:14] Hallelujah brother Isaiah gave his

[1:03:19] Lord last night Hallelujah
[1:03:26] how fitting
[1:03:29] you you can't make this stuff
[1:03:32] up now we had such a phenomenal service
[1:03:36] that brother Andrew said sister Katie
[1:03:39] was still drunk at 1:30 last night and
[1:03:42] so I personally believe she's a habitual
[1:03:46] offender I I really do she gets into it
[1:03:49] wherever she's she sees you getting it
[1:03:51] she's going to come and you know it
[1:03:53] won't rub off but she's going to come
[1:03:54] and get in the atmosphere Fe there it is
[1:03:57] and so I got a feeling she wasn't alone
[1:03:59] but isn't God so good isn't he so good
[1:04:04] and so what an atmosphere last night
[1:04:07] just so I so enjoyed it
[1:04:12] amen I as I think about I I wanted to
[1:04:16] share something before I went to the
[1:04:17] word as I think about these children and
[1:04:21] and dedicating this baby and and
[1:04:24] thinking about it I I want you to begin
[1:04:27] to like never before Point your thoughts
[1:04:31] toward
[1:04:36] home thank God for
[1:04:40] profit thank God for a
[1:04:43] prophet that indicted this generation to
[1:04:46] let us know that God sent us a voice in
[1:04:50] this day and there's so many things that
[1:04:52] are shifting and shaking and now those
[1:04:55] are just signs signs and you know it's
[1:04:59] kind of like 20 miles from Harrisonburg
[1:05:03] or 10 miles from Pilot or or ronoke or
[1:05:08] it's signs to tell us how close we are
[1:05:10] to home Israel is fighting for its own
[1:05:16] life and and don't never take that for
[1:05:18] granted we're the spiritual Israel and
[1:05:21] they're the natural Israel they are
[1:05:24] literally fighting for for their own
[1:05:26] life not just on one front but many
[1:05:29] fronts I thought the other day when
[1:05:31] Netanyahu came and gave probably the
[1:05:34] greatest speech that's been given in the
[1:05:36] halls of our Congress and if you heard
[1:05:38] that it was
[1:05:40] phenomenal and and he gave the speech
[1:05:42] and went back to Abraham and laid claim
[1:05:46] to the land we need to lay claims to
[1:05:48] this right
[1:05:51] here like never before
[1:05:57] I I think it's significant because God
[1:06:00] sent this nation a
[1:06:03] prophet and this nation turned it
[1:06:07] down turned the message down and so and
[1:06:12] so he stood there and reminded America
[1:06:16] that that not only is the enemy in their
[1:06:20] camp but it's also
[1:06:23] here let me just remind you
[1:06:27] let me just remind you in politics
[1:06:29] they've made a
[1:06:30] shift they've made a shift and I was
[1:06:33] telling the boys this week I said listen
[1:06:36] no man is in control of what's Happening
[1:06:39] Now what they're doing behind doors is
[1:06:42] God is causing he's literally causing
[1:06:46] things to
[1:06:47] happen he's causing things to happen
[1:06:50] what what about the woman in the purple
[1:06:52] dress that's already fulfilled
[1:06:56] that's already fulfilled what about Rome
[1:06:59] that's already
[1:07:01] fulfilled our Supreme Court our media is
[1:07:06] full of cathol Catholicism amen right
[1:07:11] our the Pope that they have is is the
[1:07:14] very head of the
[1:07:18] climate think about that he's head of
[1:07:21] some of the the leading Nations the
[1:07:24] leader
[1:07:27] and I know you've heard by now the
[1:07:29] Olympics that just took
[1:07:31] place come
[1:07:33] on the Olympics that just happened and
[1:07:36] in the opening
[1:07:38] ceremonies they have drag
[1:07:43] queens Mock and they set it up to where
[1:07:47] that it would be like the last
[1:07:50] supper and mock Jesus Christ and the
[1:07:54] disciples it makes me mad
[1:07:58] enough and I thought about this morning
[1:08:01] and Jill Biden applauded Joe Biden
[1:08:05] applauded and said they didn't go far
[1:08:08] enough that's in your Fox news this
[1:08:15] morning that's happening because of the
[1:08:18] cup of
[1:08:20] iniquity is full the Sodom conditions is
[1:08:24] running over
[1:08:26] the scriptures calls for Lawless
[1:08:33] societies forgive me just give me a
[1:08:35] couple minutes before I go to the
[1:08:38] word they're calling like never

[1:11:36] road that's

[1:11:46] that two prophets will be at be in
[1:11:50] Israel two prophets Moses and Elijah and
[1:11:54] they'll be slain in in the streets
[1:11:56] because they don't want to hear the
[1:12:00] message are you with me can you imagine
[1:12:03] brother Brandon being here
[1:12:05] now oh
[1:12:07] yeah listen he wouldn't last a week he
[1:12:11] wouldn't last a week cuz the spirit of

[1:12:19] difficult
[1:12:20] ways he would set seats on fire
[1:12:25] but the message has been
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:34] delivered it's been delivered and we say
[1:12:38] I believe it with all my

[1:13:03] home Hallelujah while you're standing
[1:13:06] let's
[1:13:09] just but when I raise you had you to
[1:13:11] raise your phone and the early the
[1:13:14] scriptures at that point when it's
[1:13:16] written there's no instrument made like
[1:13:19] this but now the world will see two
[1:13:22] prophets within
[1:13:24] seconds dead in the
[1:13:28] streets
[1:13:30] Hallelujah well I feel like shouting if
[1:13:32] I'm not careful I'm to do what you did
[1:13:34] last night amen Andrew that was probably
[1:13:37] the best you've ever done in your life
[1:13:39] and so amen I get to hear him four times
[1:13:42] this week and the old guy gets to preach
[1:13:46] twice amen amen God bless you God bless
[1:13:50] you well that was just the beginning and
[1:13:53] Amen brother Roger good to see you I I
[1:13:55] picked you up when I spinning there so
[1:13:57] God bless you and sister an we love you
[1:14:00] with all of our hearts amen if you'll
[1:14:02] turn with me to Hebrews chap 11 verse
[1:14:10] 1 amen Hebrews 11
[1:14:15] verse1 now brother
[1:14:18] Andrew finished last
[1:14:20] night and we don't we don't talk about
[1:14:22] what we're going to preach but he
[1:14:24] finished last
[1:14:25] night on the
[1:14:27] water that's spinning around the earth
[1:14:31] amen and on the earth there's nothing
[1:14:33] holding
[1:14:34] it but the word of
[1:14:37] God and so this has been in my notes for
[1:14:41] quite a while Hebrews chap 11 and verse
[1:14:44] one amen now Faith is the substance of
[1:14:48] things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:14:50] Things Not Seen for by it the elders
[1:14:53] obtained a good report
[1:14:56] and through faith we understand that the
[1:14:59] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:15:05] that things which are seen were not made
[1:15:08] of things which do not appear I'd like
[1:15:11] for you to turn to Genesis chapter 1
[1:15:13] just for a few scriptures here as we go
[1:15:17] forth in the beginning God created the
[1:15:20] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[1:15:23] without form and void and darkness was
[1:15:25] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[1:15:28] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[1:15:30] and God said let there be light and
[1:15:33] there was
[1:15:34] light and God saw the
[1:15:37] light that it was good and God divided
[1:15:40] the light from the darkness and God
[1:15:42] called the light day and the Darkness he
[1:15:44] called night and the evening and the
[1:15:47] morning were the first day and God said
[1:15:50] let there be a firmate in the midst of
[1:15:52] the waters and let it divide the waters
[1:15:55] from the earth from the from the waters
[1:15:58] and God made the firmament and divided
[1:16:01] the waters which were under the firment
[1:16:03] from the waters which were above the
[1:16:06] firment and it was so and God called the
[1:16:10] firment heaven and he called the evening
[1:16:14] and the morning were the second day you
[1:16:17] may be seated this this morning God
[1:16:20] bless
[1:16:22] you God bless you
[1:16:33] a couple of just quotations for you from
[1:16:36] the scriptures verily I say unto you
[1:16:39] that just generation shall not
[1:16:41] pass till all
[1:16:44] things will be
[1:16:47] fulfilled what an incredible scripture
[1:16:50] Heaven and Earth shall not shall pass
[1:16:52] away but my
[1:16:55] words shall not pass
[1:16:58] away now I want you to remember and I'm
[1:17:01] just I've got several quotes here so I
[1:17:03] don't want to bore you with it but I
[1:17:05] want you to remember God
[1:17:08] spoke and he believed his own
[1:17:12] word can you just follow me with that
[1:17:15] now I want you to remember the original
[1:17:18] seed that God speaks it has life in it
[1:17:23] the scripture also said that let every
[1:17:25] seed bring forth of its kind some of
[1:17:29] your Farmers some of your gardeners when
[1:17:32] you plant corn you expect to get corn
[1:17:38] amen when you have a cows and I was
[1:17:42] raised on a farm when you have cows you
[1:17:45] know I've been there with them and help
[1:17:46] the cows birth the little babies in into
[1:17:49] the world and you know that's a mess if
[1:17:51] you've ever been a part of that but your
[1:17:54] helping that that that calf to be born
[1:17:57] and sometimes their legs are crossed up
[1:17:59] and you just begin to work and you get
[1:18:02] their legs and but I never pulled a
[1:18:04] horse
[1:18:05] out come
[1:18:08] on it was always
[1:18:11] cows it was always calves amen we're
[1:18:15] 6,000 years later and it's never
[1:18:20] changed every seed brings forth after
[1:18:23] itself
[1:18:25] even in the animal kingdom they bring
[1:18:28] forth to
[1:18:31] itself some of you've had small children
[1:18:34] when they're born and some of you have
[1:18:36] big children and some of you have 10 PB
[1:18:38] 11 PB 12b children and you're thanking
[1:18:42] God if you have a six-pound
[1:18:46] child but I want you to know it have
[1:18:48] been an incredible
[1:18:50] shock if a pony would have been
[1:18:53] born amen
[1:18:55] or a labad dole would have been
[1:18:58] born but there was never in my mind that
[1:19:01] one of those creatures would come
[1:19:04] because the word says I'm trying to Capt
[1:19:06] you with you the word said that every
[1:19:11] seed will produce of its own kind now
[1:19:16] let's just go forward a little bit every
[1:19:19] church will
[1:19:21] produce whether it's Methodist it will
[1:19:24] produce produce Methodist whether it's
[1:19:26] Baptist it'll produce Baptist whether
[1:19:30] it's Pentecost of the world it'll
[1:19:32] produce Pentecost to the
[1:19:35] world the message will produce the
[1:19:38] message results evening light message
[1:19:41] will produce evening light
[1:19:44] results this message will produce
[1:19:52] abroad Hallelujah
[1:19:55] the seed will produce what went into the
[1:19:59] Earth and it will bring it
[1:20:02] out I'm going try not to get excited
[1:20:05] Andrew so here we
[1:20:07] are brother bam says people don't want
[1:20:09] to believe in
[1:20:10] faith well how did God make the Earth he
[1:20:14] spoke it you see you see it he spoke and
[1:20:20] the world came into existence and this
[1:20:23] world this morning is the spoken word of
[1:20:27] God he believed his own word and here it
[1:20:32] is watch it and if God and you're The
[1:20:35] Offspring of
[1:20:37] him and if you're The Offspring of him
[1:20:40] why don't you say it I'm The Offspring
[1:20:42] of
[1:20:44] God and God is in you and say it there
[1:20:49] and God is in
[1:20:50] me he will believe his own word though
[1:20:55] it can't be seen felt tasted or anything
[1:20:59] you'll believe
[1:21:02] it you see what I mean for God in you
[1:21:06] will believe his own
[1:21:11] word
[1:21:13] amen that's
[1:21:15] powerful now the first time that the sun
[1:21:19] rose in Genesis it was BR bringing a
[1:21:23] message that there will be life upon the
[1:21:26] Earth mortal life but this time when the
[1:21:30] sun rose there was a dual sunrising
[1:21:34] another
[1:21:35] sunrising it was not only the Su in
[1:21:39] Rising Resurrection morning but the S so
[1:21:43] n was
[1:21:46] Rising he says he said to bring eternal
[1:21:51] life to All God's promis
[1:21:55] that by the for knowledge that he had
[1:21:57] seen laying upon the earth now no more
[1:22:01] could the botney life lived there at the
[1:22:05] beginning without the Su in to bring it
[1:22:08] to life no more than today when the S so
[1:22:12] n of God is upon the Earth it takes the
[1:22:16] S so n light to bring them eternal
[1:22:21] life his chosen one that he knew before
[1:22:25] the foundation of the world he had
[1:22:27] chosen them in
[1:22:29] himself before the foundation of the
[1:22:33] world are you with me I want you to
[1:22:37] think sometimes we think of oursel as a
[1:22:39] temporary being here for 60 90 110 years
[1:22:43] that's just the temporary life but this
[1:22:46] isn't the real you amen that's right did
[1:22:51] you catch that I went by it real quick
[1:22:53] but this is the real
[1:22:55] you Jesus said let every man's word be a
[1:22:59] lie and mine be the truth his word is
[1:23:03] superior over all man's
[1:23:06] words over all every anything his word
[1:23:10] is
[1:23:11] light and we know that at the beginning
[1:23:14] it most it must have been a foggy dismal
[1:23:18] and dark as the world was turning and
[1:23:21] when God know that he that the need of
[1:23:23] light his seed was already in the Earth
[1:23:28] because he had planted it
[1:23:31] there now he needed light to bring forth
[1:23:34] that
[1:23:35] seed to make that seed live because the
[1:23:40] seed was already
[1:23:44] here brother brand makes a statement he
[1:23:46] said he placed your body here the
[1:23:49] elements of your body in the
[1:23:52] earth as he was forming
[1:23:55] it like a contractor would lay out Tu
[1:23:59] fours and two sixes and plywood and
[1:24:02] roofing materials getting ready God the
[1:24:05] great
[1:24:07] contractor knew what he would need and
[1:24:10] he saw you bringing you into
[1:24:14] existence even before Adam would be
[1:24:17] here now if you just grab those thoughts
[1:24:20] just for a moment God thought of you way
[1:24:23] before Even
[1:24:26] Adam then how can God lose
[1:24:31] us no matter what the devil puts against
[1:24:34] you no matter what the pressure is and
[1:24:37] no matter what he says to you if God
[1:24:39] thought of me when he was making the
[1:24:42] earth when he was building the Grand
[1:24:44] Canyon and all the deserts and all of
[1:24:46] our mountains
[1:24:48] and and he was building all of it let me
[1:24:51] just say if he thought of me while he
[1:24:53] was making and all of that there's no
[1:24:56] way that I can
[1:25:05] lose now just like it is in every age
[1:25:08] God has foretold us what would take
[1:25:11] place in each age the only thing he
[1:25:15] needs is the manifestation of the light
[1:25:17] of God upon that scripture to make it to
[1:25:21] live in that age and it will do it as
[1:25:26] long as the light can get the word if
[1:25:30] the word is
[1:25:33] gerti it'll make it
[1:25:36] live if it's promised for that
[1:25:43] age this message has went around the
[1:25:47] globe brother Tim was wrote me this
[1:25:51] morning and they have translated
[1:25:55] and proof R and it's now it's now on the
[1:26:00] Hub I
[1:26:02] believe for the Japanese people only a
[1:26:05] few years ago had not one book not one
[1:26:10] but in the last few years just short
[1:26:14] years there's churches in
[1:26:17] Japan and now 7even over
[1:26:20] 700 books are now into their hands
[1:26:24] listen no wonder Satan hates this
[1:26:28] message but once this message gets in
[1:26:30] your
[1:26:33] hands brother Ben just think about that
[1:26:36] listen as long as you were following
[1:26:38] another
[1:26:40] light and just doing the
[1:26:42] order there was no fight with you guys
[1:26:46] but once the message gets in your hands
[1:26:49] and it tells you who you are and what
[1:26:51] you can do that you can shake the key
[1:26:54] kingdoms of hell that
[1:26:56] seed The Sun Shines on that seed and it
[1:27:00] comes to
[1:27:07] life let me say there's not enough
[1:27:09] tradition to keep it down there's not
[1:27:12] enough Church order to keep it down but
[1:27:16] that seed comes to life and press it its
[1:27:19] way
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:30] Gabe disappeared we sat this morning on
[1:27:33] our back back patio we'll call it the
[1:27:36] back
[1:27:37] patio and he was talking he was talking
[1:27:40] about China and he said We As Americans
[1:27:44] we're just we are Christians but
[1:27:49] we he said we just take it for granted
[1:27:53] amen get in our car we come to church
[1:27:55] there's no real
[1:27:57] pressure what is American's pressure

[1:28:02] pressure is
[1:28:06] entertainment easy
[1:28:09] life it's going to change it's going to
[1:28:12] change very
[1:28:14] shortly easy

[1:28:51] have been Affiliated and associated with
[1:28:53] the message

[1:28:57] know that this is the
[1:28:59] truth but they can't Bridle themselves
[1:29:02] to surrender to the

[1:37:23] word that
[1:37:25] proceedeth out of the mouth of

[1:42:56] intelligence of God the seed that's
[1:43:00] inside of you responds to the word it
[1:43:04] responds to the message you want to know
[1:43:06] how that you're a Believer and you know
[1:43:08] that you're a
[1:43:09] Believer when your flesh starts wanting
[1:43:12] to walk away the seed of God inside of

[1:43:53] life and I believe that it is the spoken
[1:43:57] word of
