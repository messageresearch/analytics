[46:41] we've got a lot of new ones here brother
[46:42] Roger's been a personal bosom buddy of
[46:45] mine for for a long long time and so
[46:47] amen
[46:49] amen we will be young again together
[46:55] I just wanted to do something just
[46:57] before we before I go into the word
[47:01] and I'm sure you're a patient
[47:02] congregation but I couldn't go to be
[47:06] with brother George during the time of
[47:08] his loss of his wife
[47:10] and so I told him I would share a few
[47:12] thoughts
[47:14] as if I was standing there at the
[47:16] funeral brother Francois
[47:18] I actually spoke that funeral Friday
[47:22] sister Quinn sister Jacqueline went to
[47:25] be with the Lord on Wednesday
[47:27] brother George has been taking care of
[47:29] her for a few years now
[47:31] she has struggled with dementia symptoms
[47:35] and things that have went on
[47:37] and we want to remember brother George
[47:41] for those that don't know brother George
[47:42] brother George has been a buddy of ours
[47:45] since the early 90s when he came into
[47:48] our lives and and we affectionately
[47:51] called him King George
[47:53] I went to be with him in Ireland and a
[47:56] few years back and I you know a man you
[47:59] can recognize who he is when he's on his
[48:01] own turf
[48:03] and so I I was there with sister Quinn's
[48:07] Sarah and Jonathan and then at their
[48:10] church I spoke it's one of the nicest
[48:13] things that I've ever been a part of
[48:15] brother George took me to Columbus house
[48:19] the place where he stood and preached
[48:21] and looked over the cliff and and would
[48:24] preach to audiences down below
[48:27] we had a great time and was in his home
[48:31] with sister Jacqueline fixing meals and
[48:33] she was a real lady she was a queen we
[48:37] would term her the queen of Ireland and
[48:39] so
[48:40] uh we are saddened that she's went home
[48:43] but we're also thrilled
[48:48] amen we're also thrilled she went from a
[48:52] body that is very was very tortured
[48:55] and because of sin's curse we're all
[48:58] going to go there without a rapture
[49:01] and our life is to prove to prepare for
[49:04] that time and so
[49:06] uh brother George we share our love with
[49:09] you you're watching you're actually
[49:11] already watching now and with your
[49:14] family and so we we want you to know our
[49:16] prayers are with you we love you so much
[49:19] I was praying about a scripture that I
[49:22] could could share with you
[49:24] the scripture in Proverbs says who can
[49:27] find a virtuous woman
[49:29] for her price is far above rubies
[49:34] the heart of her husband does safely
[49:36] trust in her so that he shall have no
[49:40] need or spall
[49:42] her husband is known in the gates and
[49:46] when he sitteth amongst the Elders of
[49:49] the land
[49:51] sister Jacqueline fulfilled that
[49:54] as brother George would would be in and
[49:57] out of the home be be on a job for up
[50:01] until in his 60s he would work many
[50:05] different many different types of jobs
[50:08] at the end he was taking care of
[50:10] handicapped children
[50:12] and uh
[50:14] I was with him in Donegal and we were
[50:17] walking the streets
[50:18] and I knew what a great man that I was
[50:21] with by by people that would pass and
[50:23] and stop and talk to him and
[50:26] it was like talking to a celebrity
[50:33] they lived in a farm home
[50:36] kind of a rock-like structure
[50:39] it was a farm that they had many
[50:41] different animals
[50:42] she had tremendous Gardens there
[50:46] her home was quite a wonderful home A
[50:48] Home of love
[50:50] their daughter Sister Sarah and Jonathan
[50:54] they are just they're just examples of
[50:57] what this message is
[50:59] they have helped to take care of Mom and
[51:01] Dad through the years and while he would
[51:04] be away whether it's Vietnam
[51:06] or China or or India or any of the
[51:10] countries that he was at
[51:12] probably the worst of when he was ever
[51:15] at was America
[51:18] and I would say America we have forgot
[51:21] who God is
[51:23] and brother George we would like to
[51:25] welcome you back again they were wanting
[51:27] to come here in January and as they were
[51:30] making plans to come here I just felt
[51:33] burdened on my heart to tell them not to
[51:35] come
[51:35] and uh they actually went to a warm
[51:38] climate
[51:40] and I'm glad they did that and shared
[51:43] with us many many wonderful pictures of
[51:45] of going there
[51:48] and we just we're just thrilled that
[51:51] we've got to know them
[51:53] as she has passed over a queen has went
[51:56] to the other side
[51:58] she stepped from this Mortal to a brand
[52:01] new body
[52:03] she labored here taking care of the home
[52:06] taking care of the farm taking care of
[52:09] our Gardens making sure that brother
[52:12] George was fed properly taken care of
[52:16] no doubt it's a child she didn't realize
[52:18] what an incredible calling that she
[52:20] would have
[52:21] not only to be the pastor of that home
[52:23] pastor's wife of that home but to be a
[52:26] queen
[52:28] when you're born you don't know what
[52:30] your purpose is going to be in life
[52:33] but when she married brother George she
[52:36] married a great man
[52:39] we have loved brother George
[52:42] just over the hill from their home is a
[52:44] is a street that goes by
[52:47] and it would be the same street to which
[52:49] John Wesley would have traveled
[52:53] he would go just up the road to preach
[52:55] in that local church there and we know
[52:58] who John Wesley was
[53:00] but I'd like to say that that street was
[53:03] incredibly important because it carried
[53:06] George Quinn
[53:09] I have the greatest reverence and
[53:11] respect for brother George his wife
[53:14] and their children and their Church
[53:15] there
[53:17] and you know sometimes we look at people
[53:20] because they've got huge crowds and
[53:22] think of what success
[53:24] but in a Catholic country whether you
[53:27] have five people or a hundred people
[53:29] you're incredibly successful
[53:32] he has raised the manner of the message
[53:35] through all of these years
[53:38] and what a banner that he's held up
[53:41] and I would like to say to Sister Quinn
[53:44] well done
[53:46] it don't mean too much for me
[53:50] but well done
[53:54] some words that she said she didn't know
[53:56] that I heard
[54:00] it was after a service that I had
[54:02] preached
[54:04] we went back to the back of the place
[54:06] and it was very cold there in Ireland
[54:09] and the brothers had their coats on one
[54:11] side the sisters on another side and it
[54:13] was kind of like a wall petition there
[54:16] and as I was putting my coat on and my
[54:19] hat on
[54:21] I heard her say something
[54:23] tonight
[54:25] it was as though Jesus came to visit us
[54:29] and he spoke to us
[54:31] I thought those were some of the
[54:33] greatest words that I'd ever heard
[54:40] that Jesus would come
[54:42] to visit us
[54:46] I had a really interesting moment with
[54:48] her and I won't be long but I had a
[54:49] really interesting moment
[54:52] we went to do some shopping
[54:55] and for the girls we got all of our
[54:58] girls
[54:59] uh a necklace what would you call that
[55:01] sister Connie it was kind of a rapper
[55:05] scarf
[55:06] I don't wear them every day so I don't
[55:08] know much about them
[55:11] and she was telling me what was the best
[55:13] fabric sister Cassidy she was just
[55:16] picking him up and said now this is a
[55:17] good one this is not a good one can you
[55:20] tell the difference no
[55:24] but she insisted that I buy that
[55:26] particular kind
[55:28] and I did I tried to buy all of the
[55:31] girls all of our my my family's one I
[55:34] had on my heart to buy a coat for sister
[55:36] Connie it'd be a wool coat be a nice
[55:40] dress coat and it's a blue blue
[55:43] and
[55:44] I was wanting to get this particular
[55:46] coat for her
[55:50] and sister Jacqueline had met Connie
[55:52] many years ago
[55:54] and she was telling me specifically what
[55:57] size that Connie needed
[56:01] well I didn't want to spend that kind of
[56:03] money and knowing that she wasn't going
[56:04] to be able to wear that coat
[56:07] and so
[56:09] she said this is the one you got to have
[56:11] you got to have this one you got to have
[56:13] this one and I I was thankful she
[56:16] couldn't read my mind
[56:19] and so then when I sing that she was so
[56:22] determined I walked through the clothing
[56:23] store which was a nice clothing store
[56:25] and I finally found a lady that was my
[56:28] wife's built
[56:31] and it was a strange request I walked up
[56:33] to her and
[56:34] and I said I need some help
[56:37] and she turned she said what kind of
[56:38] help you need I said I need you to try
[56:40] on a coat
[56:45] and I said I'm saying this in a very
[56:46] complimentary way you're built like my
[56:48] wife I'm not coming on to you but you're
[56:51] built like my wife
[56:56] she came over and was so graciously and
[56:59] and so we put the code on sister Connie
[57:01] and
[57:03] sister Jacqueline said that looks really
[57:04] nice that looks really nice and I'm
[57:07] sorry I was glad that I could please
[57:08] sister Jacqueline as well
[57:12] she's wearing a different coat today
[57:16] and I told that story for a reason she's
[57:19] wearing a different coat
[57:21] her coat today is is a coat of a new
[57:24] body
[57:25] she stands in her theotheny and
[57:28] she can't wait to come back
[57:32] and be with her husband and her family
[57:35] but she had prepared all of these years
[57:37] for this going away
[57:40] you see in God's house nothing can
[57:42] remove your name
[57:44] he designed it all
[57:48] he wrote your name before the foundation
[57:51] of the world
[57:52] he prepares for your coming to Earth
[57:55] and he prepares for your leaving
[57:58] God no absolutely makes no mistakes
[58:02] when it comes to his children he knows
[58:05] the day you'll be born he knows the hour
[58:07] he knows the minute
[58:09] and he knows the hour the minute that
[58:12] you will leave
[58:14] God knows our fallibility
[58:17] so he give us a blood that could take
[58:20] care of that you see God is the
[58:22] architect
[58:24] of this body
[58:25] and the architect of that body
[58:29] one day we'll get a glorious body
[58:31] likened unto his glorious body
[58:34] and we'll never know more part we'll
[58:36] never no more go away
[58:38] brother George I have good news for you
[58:42] she's waiting standing beyond the river
[58:46] and what more could we ask
[58:48] no she won't be in the Who's Who and no
[58:51] she probably wasn't a millionaire but
[58:54] she's got eternity and that's the
[58:57] greatest thing that we could possibly
[58:58] ever have

[1:04:02] amen amen we're so glad to have brother

[1:04:09] wonderful song this morning that she
[1:04:10] sung and the barfields and so and her
[1:04:13] his mother is with us and
[1:04:15] amen
[1:04:17] we were at Ohio a few weeks ago
[1:04:21] and as I was I was leaving on Sunday
[1:04:24] morning
[1:04:26] and I was just walking out and I was
[1:04:29] shaking different hands and
[1:04:31] as I was going out and it just seemed
[1:04:34] like one one touch after another touch
[1:04:37] and miracles were happening and
[1:04:40] and I had just been with brother Ben or
[1:04:43] Brian Erickson and his wife and
[1:04:46] had a supernatural moment there as I
[1:04:49] turned the corner to walk down the hall
[1:04:52] your mother was standing there brother
[1:04:54] Chris
[1:04:55] they placed her in a spot to where that
[1:04:57] is she said she wanted prayer and they
[1:05:00] said it brother Ron feels up to it he'll
[1:05:03] turn and pray for you and as I walked by
[1:05:05] I just sensed an urgency and
[1:05:09] she gave her heart to the Lord
[1:05:13] amen baptized on Thursday this week and
[1:05:16] last night had a very incredible
[1:05:19] experience right here
[1:05:21] Brother Ray you was on one side of this
[1:05:23] and she was on the other side and I
[1:05:26] thought last night was so over the top
[1:05:29] amen
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:32] sister Melissa I prayed spent some time
[1:05:35] with her
[1:05:36] and I just you know my heart was I
[1:05:39] couldn't hardly go to sleep after that
[1:05:41] and don't worry I can't see it no way
[1:05:43] and so
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:46] as I heard her just screaming out in
[1:05:48] prayer you were praying with her sister
[1:05:50] Chastity and
[1:05:52] and then sister Wanda I thought What
[1:05:55] miracles has happened among us see don't
[1:05:58] never take these kind of services for
[1:06:00] granted
[1:06:02] it's because we're getting ready to go
[1:06:04] home
[1:06:05] that's why we're having services like we
[1:06:08] long for services like this and
[1:06:10] now we've spent decades and now we're
[1:06:13] having them and
[1:06:15] we're going to go home
[1:06:17] soon
[1:06:18] we're going home and so amen amen God
[1:06:23] bless you we so love you this morning
[1:06:26] amen thank you thank you
[1:06:28] thank you I want to
[1:06:31] I want to share a thought with you today
[1:06:33] I found a note the other day that just
[1:06:36] ministered to my heart
[1:06:39] Trust
[1:06:42] never put a question mark
[1:06:44] where the Lord has put a period
[1:06:48] I thought that was so profound
[1:06:51] this morning I want to speak to you for
[1:06:54] I hope
[1:06:55] a decent time
[1:06:58] indisputable evidence
[1:07:02] indisputable evidence
[1:07:05] we as Christians have an empty tomb
[1:07:11] we as Christians have an empty tomb
[1:07:14] maybe this isn't working
[1:07:17] we as Christians
[1:07:20] have an empty tomb
[1:07:24] other great leaders came and had a lot
[1:07:26] of theology
[1:07:28] but when they laid him in their tomb
[1:07:30] regardless of whether it was gold
[1:07:32] whether it was a huge building
[1:07:36] where whether it was a sphinx
[1:07:40] they're still there
[1:07:43] no matter how many thousands of years
[1:07:45] has passed they're still there
[1:07:47] but Jesus didn't need nobody
[1:07:51] to buy him a tomb
[1:07:54] he wasn't going to stay long
[1:07:58] Hallelujah I want to declare to you he's
[1:08:01] not there but he's risen
[1:08:04] amen he's the mighty conqueror he's our
[1:08:09] champion
[1:08:10] Matthew chapter 27 and verse 57.
[1:08:17] and when the evening was come
[1:08:20] there came a rich man of armathea named
[1:08:23] Joseph
[1:08:25] who also himself was Jesus disciple
[1:08:29] and he went to pilate and begged the
[1:08:31] body of Jesus and then pilate commanded
[1:08:34] the body to be delivered
[1:08:36] and when Joseph had taken the body he
[1:08:39] wrapped it and cleaned linen cloth
[1:08:42] and laid it in his own new Tomb
[1:08:46] which he had tuned out in the Rock and
[1:08:49] he rolled a great Stone to the door of
[1:08:52] the Sepulcher and departed
[1:08:55] and there was Mary and Mary Magdalene
[1:08:58] and the other Mary sitting over against
[1:09:01] the Sepulcher
[1:09:03] now the next day that followed the the
[1:09:06] day of preparation the chief priests and
[1:09:09] the Pharisees came together unto pilate
[1:09:12] I think this is incredible scripture
[1:09:14] saying sir we remember that the deceiver
[1:09:18] said
[1:09:19] while he was yet alive after three days
[1:09:22] I will rise again
[1:09:26] command therefore that the Sepulcher be
[1:09:29] made sure until the third day lest that
[1:09:32] the disciples come by night and steal
[1:09:35] him away and say unto the people he has
[1:09:37] risen from the dead so the last era
[1:09:41] shall be worse than the first and pilate
[1:09:45] said unto them ye have a watch go your
[1:09:48] way make it as sure as you can
[1:09:52] what a joke
[1:09:56] so they went and made the Sepulcher sure
[1:10:00] sealing the stone
[1:10:03] and setting a watch
[1:10:06] you may be seated
[1:10:11] I'd like to start this isn't the devil
[1:10:14] stupid
[1:10:18] may not be proper in a lot of places but
[1:10:25] this week as I was coming to this sermon
[1:10:27] this quote kept coming to me so I want
[1:10:30] to I want to share it
[1:10:33] in spiritual Amnesia brother Branham
[1:10:35] talks about a water tank
[1:10:38] we're in the hour of compelling them to
[1:10:41] come
[1:10:42] the last ones are coming in the last one
[1:10:45] it's not Mass isn't coming it's the last
[1:10:48] ones that are coming in
[1:10:50] stepping it's a sign to us that we're
[1:10:53] prepared we're preparing to go home it's
[1:10:55] not just happening here but it's
[1:10:57] happening around the world
[1:10:59] brother Brandon says he says in
[1:11:02] spiritual Amnesia he said a French
[1:11:04] soldier
[1:11:05] I was told of a little story before
[1:11:08] before we would close this evening he
[1:11:11] said I didn't know it was even that late
[1:11:14] and I got about 10 pages of notes
[1:11:17] somebody told me told me the other day
[1:11:19] that brother Branham didn't use notes
[1:11:21] and I just start quickly going through
[1:11:23] how many pages that he had
[1:11:25] and he said he got some he said that he
[1:11:28] said get it some other time he said
[1:11:30] notice a French soldier they got a bunch
[1:11:33] of soldiers in in from the Army and they
[1:11:35] had this amnesia it's from shock on the
[1:11:39] battle
[1:11:40] and they had they had a program that
[1:11:42] they called up and let people who would
[1:11:45] miss and loved ones to call and see if
[1:11:47] they could identify these boys
[1:11:49] no hope for them maybe one or two out of
[1:11:53] it got caught it and and then they took
[1:11:57] the rest of them
[1:11:58] they was going to put them in a
[1:12:01] sanatorium
[1:12:02] where they'd stay the rest of their life
[1:12:06] and there was going up the hillside the
[1:12:09] train was pulling and they stopped at a
[1:12:11] station and let the boys get out and
[1:12:14] stretch their legs and the guards got
[1:12:17] out on the hill and watched them because
[1:12:19] with amnesia you have to be watched they
[1:12:22] have to watch them
[1:12:24] and so they watched them one little
[1:12:26] fellow there he got out and he began to
[1:12:28] look around and he looked at that water
[1:12:31] tank
[1:12:32] looked all around over the hill he
[1:12:36] robbed his face and he studied and he
[1:12:40] looked again and and he seen that water
[1:12:42] tank and he looked all around at the
[1:12:45] station and he started walking
[1:12:48] instead of the Guard stopping him he
[1:12:50] followed him he went up over a hill and
[1:12:53] down a little path and turned to the
[1:12:55] right and went over another Hill little
[1:12:57] Hill and he'd come to a little cabin
[1:13:00] little log cabin and he looked and
[1:13:03] coming out on the porch an old man with
[1:13:05] a cane in his hands and he'd come out
[1:13:07] and throwed his arms around him and said
[1:13:09] my son
[1:13:11] I know Jew would return
[1:13:14] they told me you were dead but I know
[1:13:16] Jupiter report to return and the boy
[1:13:19] come to himself in the Amnesia left him
[1:13:22] he could identify who he was he knowed
[1:13:25] that that was his father
[1:13:27] oh soldier of the Cross that's been shot
[1:13:31] by so much training and so much
[1:13:34] denominations and Creeds things of the
[1:13:37] world why don't you just step off for a
[1:13:39] few minutes and go looking around in the
[1:13:41] Bible
[1:13:45] wander around and you might find
[1:13:48] yourself identified in the word
[1:13:50] as a Believer one of these days you
[1:13:54] might not know him you may come to
[1:13:56] yourself and lack a prodigal son did and
[1:13:59] find yourself
[1:14:01] find your identification
[1:14:04] in the word of God
[1:14:08] oh hallelujah what a powerful thing that
[1:14:10] that is
[1:14:13] brother random says he says in true
[1:14:16] Easter seal he says and today they're
[1:14:19] trying to keep
[1:14:22] their time to keep Christ in the Tomb
[1:14:25] but oh what an Easter morning done
[1:14:29] an Easter morning ruined all their
[1:14:31] theology
[1:14:32] and when man on Easter morning came
[1:14:35] forth for a people a church here 1900
[1:14:39] years later it ruined their theology
[1:14:43] he's not dead he's alive forever more
[1:14:47] they cannot keep him in a no tomb you
[1:14:51] cannot keep him in a Methodist tomb or a
[1:14:54] Baptist tomb or a
[1:14:56] presbyterian tomb whatever you want but
[1:15:00] he was raised out of that tomb and it's
[1:15:03] alive today
[1:15:05] I had a Baptist tomb you might have a
[1:15:08] Methodist tomb but one of these days
[1:15:11] Jesus arose you from there
[1:15:13] from a historical God to a living God
[1:15:18] a present God he's alive forever more
[1:15:25] Hallelujah
[1:15:27] whatever tomb that you was in
[1:15:31] God has called you from that tomb
[1:15:35] he said in the face of all of this doubt
[1:15:37] go God does go right on proving his
[1:15:41] words
[1:15:42] to be right
[1:15:44] as he was in every age
[1:15:47] unbelief doesn't stop God
[1:15:51] unbelief does not stop God
[1:15:55] unbelief does not stop God
[1:16:00] it doesn't hinder him I don't care how
[1:16:03] much the world unbeliefs
[1:16:06] it's still going to happen
[1:16:08] unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemns
[1:16:12] the unbeliever
[1:16:14] but brother Ron we've been so many years
[1:16:16] since the message
[1:16:19] was delivered and the prophet went off
[1:16:21] of the scene where's the resurrection
[1:16:23] and the Rapture just like last night
[1:16:26] some of God's kids had to come home
[1:16:30] some of his kids had to come home they
[1:16:33] had to identify who they was
[1:16:38] they saw the water tank and they had to
[1:16:40] keep going they had to search in the
[1:16:43] scriptures nothing in the world
[1:16:46] was satisfying them there's not a not a
[1:16:49] fact enough alcohol there's not enough
[1:16:51] adultery there's not enough Hollywood
[1:16:54] that will satisfy your soul there's
[1:16:56] nothing in sin
[1:16:58] it'll only put you in a tomb
[1:17:01] [Applause]
[1:17:04] God rich in Mercy
[1:17:06] when he says Lazarus come forth
[1:17:10] when it calls your name
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:16] Satan is a loser
[1:17:20] I don't care how much the world
[1:17:21] unbelieves is still going to happen
[1:17:24] unbelief does not do nothing but
[1:17:26] condemns the unbeliever
[1:17:29] the unbeliever will send the unbelief
[1:17:32] unbelief will send the unbeliever to
[1:17:34] hell
[1:17:35] it'll Rob him of Every Blessing God
[1:17:38] promised to him but it doesn't hinder
[1:17:42] God
[1:17:43] from going right on with the believer
[1:17:47] unbelief does not stop God
[1:17:55] we can't lose
[1:17:59] if you know who you are
[1:18:01] and you know where you're standing you
[1:18:05] can't lose
[1:18:11] Adam stepped out of Eden
[1:18:15] into a world of sin
[1:18:19] and it
[1:18:21] and it actually changed not only Adam
[1:18:23] and Eve but it changed the whole world
[1:18:26] sin now reigned upon the Earth
[1:18:29] but God came
[1:18:32] our Jesus came
[1:18:35] to change it all
[1:18:38] unbelief
[1:18:40] didn't stop Jesus
[1:18:43] it was at every meeting the skeptic and
[1:18:46] the scoffer was ever every place that he
[1:18:48] preached
[1:18:50] when men and women were healed
[1:18:55] the leper was healed he was no longer
[1:18:57] the leper
[1:18:58] when blind Bartimaeus was healed he was
[1:19:00] no longer blind Bartimaeus
[1:19:04] went at the woman at the well she was no
[1:19:07] longer the woman at the well
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:13] it don't take 10 years to change your
[1:19:15] life
[1:19:16] just meet Jesus
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:25] now we think about this being 2 000
[1:19:28] years ago but what did every service
[1:19:31] of our prophets stand their doing
[1:19:34] he was preaching the indisputable Word
[1:19:39] of Life
[1:19:41] seeds were on the earth that would hear
[1:19:45] the message and become the Bride of
[1:19:47] Jesus Christ
[1:19:49] all of the Scott Skeptics of Hell
[1:19:52] couldn't stop it
[1:19:57] it doesn't matter what the critic says
[1:20:00] unbelief can't stop God there's going to
[1:20:04] be a bride
[1:20:09] the message encircles the globe like
[1:20:12] brother George men stand almost in every
[1:20:16] nation raising their banner and there's
[1:20:19] people that love this word just like you
[1:20:22] do
[1:20:22] [Applause]
[1:20:25] this message was more than just to be on
[1:20:27] Book and Tape
[1:20:29] it was more than to be the voice of
[1:20:31] William Branham but the voice behind the
[1:20:34] voice was calling you from that sin and
[1:20:38] dead life under a resurrection
[1:20:42] where would you withstand as redeemed
[1:20:45] sons of God and exercise your authority
[1:20:49] of resurrection power in this life
[1:20:58] Satan couldn't hold Jesus
[1:21:04] and in all of this
[1:21:07] thinking power
[1:21:09] he can't even touch Jesus now
[1:21:16] I want you to grab that
[1:21:18] the moment he left hell
[1:21:21] with the keys in his hand
[1:21:24] he couldn't touch Jesus
[1:21:31] all of his imps all of his demons
[1:21:35] couldn't touch him now
[1:21:38] he can't get the keys back he can't get
[1:21:41] the arrows for his bow
[1:21:44] it's an indisputable fact
[1:21:46] hell is defeated
[1:21:52] the sickness that you may suffer today
[1:21:58] and that you struggle with it's defeated
[1:22:03] the pressure's in this world it's
[1:22:06] defeated
[1:22:09] now Satan might be able to touch your
[1:22:12] flesh
[1:22:15] he might be able to touch your spirit
[1:22:19] get in your memory and your conscience
[1:22:21] your affections he might be able to get
[1:22:22] there but laying in the third round
[1:22:27] he can't get to that
[1:22:30] he can't touch that once God resurrects
[1:22:34] it
[1:22:36] and that dormant seed comes to life
[1:22:39] that God placed in you before the
[1:22:42] foundation of the world God DNA
[1:22:46] Notch Spencer aims
[1:22:49] I'm not talking about that that's his
[1:22:50] flesh but God DNA g-o-d DNA lives on the
[1:22:56] inside of you say it with me g-o-d
[1:22:59] DNA lays on the inside of me
[1:23:05] and Satan can't touch it
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:21] he may bet your flesh he may bet your
[1:23:23] spirit but he cannot backs that Soul
[1:23:25] down on the inside of you
[1:23:27] he can put every ounce of unbelief
[1:23:29] against you put every ounce of Reason
[1:23:31] against you he can use the best that
[1:23:33] he's got he can't turn you around
[1:23:41] it isn't you holding it's God holding
[1:23:47] it isn't you defeating the devil is God
[1:23:50] defeating the devil in you
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:23:58] Isaiah chapter 60 and verse 1.
[1:24:03] arise and shine
[1:24:05] for thy light has come
[1:24:11] and the glory of the Lord
[1:24:14] is risen upon thee
[1:24:17] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[1:24:19] Earth and gross Darkness the people but
[1:24:21] the Lord shall arise upon thee and His
[1:24:25] glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:24:31] we can say God in you
[1:24:38] Hallelujah
[1:24:40] how do I know he lives I can just look
[1:24:42] around a little while
[1:24:44] if you could have give up you would have
[1:24:47] if you could have walked away you would
[1:24:50] have
[1:24:51] [Applause]
[1:24:52] cause you went through some trials that
[1:24:55] would shake the Thunder out of you but
[1:24:57] God rich in Mercy
[1:25:00] when you would have turned loose
[1:25:02] somebody else grabbed your hand
[1:25:04] whether you're realizing it wasn't you
[1:25:08] he was hanging on to you
[1:25:10] our great Shepherd God had a halt of us
[1:25:14] when we were going over a cliff he
[1:25:17] grabbed a halt of us and pulled us back
[1:25:24] therefore my heart is great glad and my
[1:25:27] glory
[1:25:29] rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest In
[1:25:33] Hope
[1:25:34] I love this next scripture
[1:25:36] for thou Wilt not leave my soul in hell
[1:25:41] neither will thou suffer thine Holy One
[1:25:45] to see corruption
[1:25:48] Now understand this Jesus is the only
[1:25:50] one that ever said I have power to lay
[1:25:53] my life down and power to take it up
[1:25:55] again
[1:25:57] a lot of people wanted to cheat death
[1:26:00] no matter how rich you are no matter
[1:26:03] what kind of a star you are
[1:26:07] no matter what your Brilliance in your
[1:26:10] brain has done you can't cheat death
[1:26:12] it's part of it
[1:26:14] but God had a man named Enoch
[1:26:20] that was so pleasing to God
[1:26:23] he didn't need a tongue
[1:26:26] he didn't need a grave
[1:26:29] but he just kept walking
[1:26:33] it don't say nothing about his family it
[1:26:36] don't say nothing about his uncles and
[1:26:37] his aunts he just kept walking and he so
[1:26:40] pleased God until one day he walked
[1:26:43] right off of this Earth
[1:26:45] you can search the whole world over he
[1:26:48] ain't here
[1:26:52] no matter how hated Elijah was
[1:26:56] he was God's spirit inside of a man
[1:27:00] no matter how hated he was
[1:27:03] one day he started walking
[1:27:05] and a guy was walking behind him every
[1:27:08] step of the way
[1:27:17] and that guy wanted the double portion
[1:27:19] of what he had
[1:27:21] so if he had four Miracles he would have
[1:27:23] ate if he had eight Miracles he'd have
[1:27:24] 16.
[1:27:28] and so
[1:27:30] Elijah told him and gave him basic
[1:27:32] instructions if you see me when I go
[1:27:39] if you see me when I go
[1:27:42] still important those instructions are
[1:27:45] still important keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:27:49] do not get your eyes on man man will
[1:27:52] disappoint you
[1:27:57] man will disappoint you
[1:28:02] Jesus will never disappoint you
[1:28:05] the day that he came down to to the
[1:28:08] water Jordan
[1:28:11] he needed to get across
[1:28:14] took his coat off his clock off and he
[1:28:16] hit the water they walked right across
[1:28:19] we got the other side
[1:28:22] Elijah
[1:28:23] that's what brother bam said
[1:28:25] found a chariot
[1:28:28] said there were chariots in every bush
[1:28:32] and he said he left some for you
[1:28:37] and it jumped in that chariot
[1:28:40] and he began to ride
[1:28:42] and he took his coat off
[1:28:45] Connie told me said don't don't take
[1:28:46] your coat off it's your best it should
[1:28:47] be
[1:28:50] well where I'm going I'm not going to
[1:28:51] need a vest
[1:28:53] he took his cloak off and he throwed it
[1:28:56] back down to Elisha and Elisha caught
[1:28:58] him
[1:28:59] now let me just say this you brother
[1:29:01] Branham says in second hand robe he said
[1:29:05] God did not cut
[1:29:07] the robe to fit Elijah
[1:29:13] he don't trim the word to fit you
[1:29:16] I'm looking for a church that fits me
[1:29:19] you got that opposite
[1:29:20] [Applause]
[1:29:22] you got that opposite God trims you
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:31] let me just say this let me just say it
[1:29:33] real clear brother Ron but that's a
[1:29:35] hurtful statement this ain't for
[1:29:37] everybody
[1:29:41] this ain't for everybody this is for the
[1:29:44] bride of Christ
[1:29:45] and God knows who will and who want
[1:29:49] don't be disappointed when people walk
[1:29:51] away and steer their nose and go all
[1:29:53] different kind of things it wasn't for
[1:29:55] him
[1:29:56] don't judge them respect them but it
[1:29:59] wasn't for them but you want to be
[1:30:01] dancing
[1:30:07] because it was for you and this was
[1:30:11] exactly what you was looking for
[1:30:14] you were thirsting for life and you
[1:30:16] found it
[1:30:17] [Applause]
[1:30:26] Elisha caught this rope
[1:30:29] it fit him perfectly
[1:30:32] he didn't notice
[1:30:33] that he had been so trimmed up in
[1:30:35] Walking with the Lord for 10 years
[1:30:38] now this robe fed him
[1:30:41] there was probably a time it wouldn't
[1:30:43] fit him
[1:30:44] but in walking with Elijah for 10 years
[1:30:48] and watching miracles
[1:30:50] and he put it on
[1:30:53] now let me just say this to you that was
[1:30:55] probably a time that that the wedding
[1:30:58] garment didn't fit you
[1:31:05] because you had the Hulk smell on you
[1:31:08] life now let me just explain something
[1:31:11] to you about washing Hawks
[1:31:15] how many's Ever Raised Hawks
[1:31:18] well we got a few hands here
[1:31:19] listen they stink if you ain't got it
[1:31:25] they stink
[1:31:27] and they wallow in mud
[1:31:30] they eat things that you would never eat
[1:31:35] and that's what we were
[1:31:38] we were some tunes of hogden
[1:31:41] probably a new word right there hold
[1:31:43] them

[1:31:49] her and you can start scrubbing her
[1:31:55] and you could scrub and you can scrub
[1:31:57] and you can go to every little spot

[1:32:08] Rockingham County Fair
[1:32:11] and you know if you're fortunate you
[1:32:12] could be the one that gets a blue ribbon
[1:32:15] but take Bessie home
[1:32:21] just take obesity home take a ribbon off
[1:32:24] of her and take the string off her
[1:32:26] because she didn't get a nature change

[1:32:35] in about 30 seconds old Bessie ain't
[1:32:38] gonna smell the way
[1:32:41] the perfume will be gone
[1:32:43] the foundation detergent will be gone
[1:32:46] the Vaseline that you put on her is
[1:32:49] gonna be gone she's gonna be muddy
[1:32:54] if you don't get Jesus
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:59] if you don't get Jesus you can pretend
[1:33:01] you can put your name on the book you
[1:33:04] can shake the preacher's hand on Monday
[1:33:07] you're going to be right back and hug
[1:33:09] them
[1:33:12] but if you ever get a nature change in
[1:33:14] your life
[1:33:16] that whole pen will never be right for
[1:33:18] you
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:34] I got a picture the other day
[1:33:38] it was me in white bibbed overalls
[1:33:41] it was a time that I wore them
[1:33:46] I actually showed up at my wedding
[1:33:48] rehearsal
[1:33:49] in white bib overhauls
[1:33:55] Homer looked at me
[1:34:03] but tomorrow I would have a white tuxedo
[1:34:05] on
[1:34:07] I would look more appropriate
[1:34:10] although back in the day
[1:34:13] before Nike socks
[1:34:16] we had them big long football socks
[1:34:21] and I had Green Bay Packer socks on
[1:34:26] and then babies was pulled up to about
[1:34:27] right here
[1:34:29] through a white tuxedo you could see
[1:34:33] Green Bay stripes
[1:34:44] nobody was wanting me to be their Pastor
[1:34:46] then
[1:34:51] sometimes you look the part and you're
[1:34:53] not ready for it
[1:34:57] sometimes you look like you're getting
[1:34:58] ready you really ready
[1:35:02] but what if I turned around and sister
[1:35:04] Connie had just left the barnyard
[1:35:09] her hair was all in strings
[1:35:14] blue jean skirt
[1:35:16] stuff all over
[1:35:19] I said I didn't I didn't think it was
[1:35:22] going to be like this
[1:35:25] I thought at weddings they wore a
[1:35:26] wedding gown and
[1:35:28] it'd be clean and it'd be pure and it'd
[1:35:30] be white
[1:35:31] you see when I turned around she took my
[1:35:34] breath
[1:35:35] she still takes my breath
[1:35:47] Jesus is coming for a broad
[1:35:51] he's going to be a real lady
[1:35:54] and for the critic and the unbeliever
[1:35:57] they don't like the dress
[1:36:04] they don't like a dress
[1:36:07] but this is the dress it's supposed to
[1:36:09] be on
[1:36:10] this message is the dress
[1:36:12] [Applause]
[1:36:14] you know you may not liked an ark but it
[1:36:17] was the one that would preserve Noah and
[1:36:19] his family
[1:36:21] you could be an unbeliever you could be
[1:36:23] a doubter
[1:36:25] build your own Ark but that was the one
[1:36:29] I'm coming to something
[1:36:32] there's a lot of people preparing to go
[1:36:34] into a tribulation period
[1:36:38] listen to righteous in their own way
[1:36:40] they're religious in their own way
[1:36:42] but their tomb is taking them to the
[1:36:45] tribulation period
[1:36:48] but there's a message
[1:36:53] that lack Lazarus called forth
[1:36:56] and only Lazarus come out of there
[1:36:58] Brethren said Jesus had to be specific
[1:37:01] because he was the voice of the
[1:37:03] Resurrection
[1:37:05] that's what we've heard in this message
[1:37:07] is the voice of the Resurrection
[1:37:12] how did I hear it how did I get here he
[1:37:16] called you
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:25] not a man called you
[1:37:28] if a man calls you he'll have to take
[1:37:30] care of you
[1:37:32] but when God calls you he said I'll
[1:37:35] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[1:37:37] I'll be with you to the end
[1:37:41] Jesus's tomb is empty
[1:37:45] so is yours
[1:37:51] so is yours
[1:37:54] you ever had a job when you quit you
[1:37:57] never want to go back
[1:38:02] you're not even interested I never was
[1:38:04] interested in ever going back to the
[1:38:05] picnic at the Arsenal
[1:38:08] I never was interested in hanging around
[1:38:10] old friends
[1:38:12] I'm gone I'm gone hey I'm gone
[1:38:16] I'm gone I'm gone I don't want to say
[1:38:19] this you there's nothing in sin watch me
[1:38:21] won't go back to
[1:38:24] I don't miss hangovers
[1:38:26] I don't miss being blinded out of my
[1:38:29] mind
[1:38:31] from being under the hallucinogen Jesus
[1:38:33] I don't miss none of that but in that
[1:38:36] tomb
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:39] I had people take me to the Pentecostal
[1:38:41] church because they knew I needed it I
[1:38:43] had people take me to the Baptist Church
[1:38:44] because they knew I needed it but there
[1:38:46] wasn't nothing there
[1:38:49] because I'd already had a case
[1:38:52] I knew what was real you can run you can
[1:38:55] hide you can go as far as you want to
[1:38:57] God knows how to bring your children
[1:38:59] home
[1:39:10] the message has called us forth
[1:39:12] the Rapture as he's descending the shout
[1:39:16] Goes Forth The Voice
[1:39:19] and the Trump a gathering he has
[1:39:22] gathered us together
[1:39:25] now just as Jesus was here
[1:39:29] they also had a gathering
[1:39:31] he gathered his disciples he gathered
[1:39:34] his believers
[1:39:36] he gathered 380 that would not go to the
[1:39:39] upper room but he had 120 that would
[1:39:42] amen he gathered pilate he gathered
[1:39:46] Herod
[1:39:47] he gathered every skeptic like
[1:39:49] caiaphasis
[1:39:51] he gathered every one of them
[1:39:54] because he had
[1:39:56] to go to Calvary
[1:39:58] our time he has gathered Skeptics he has
[1:40:02] gathered scoffers
[1:40:04] they played the part
[1:40:06] he has gathered Putin
[1:40:09] he has gathered the Pope he has gathered
[1:40:13] China he has gathered North Korea he has
[1:40:16] gathered all these nations with Atomic
[1:40:19] Warfare because they are needed
[1:40:22] they're going to play their part right
[1:40:24] now they're just revving up the drunks
[1:40:27] because there's a Revival that's
[1:40:29] happening among them
[1:40:32] our nation has become more polluted our
[1:40:35] schools are polluted our government is
[1:40:38] polluted if you don't think their
[1:40:39] government's not polluted you're not
[1:40:42] reading the news
[1:40:46] all of that has to happen
[1:40:49] Sodom and Gomorrah is excelled it's on
[1:40:52] steroids Among Us
[1:40:54] and brother Brown Could Only See
[1:40:57] what will you and I are seeing on a
[1:40:59] daily basis but God knew he could trust
[1:41:02] you in Satan's Eden
[1:41:06] he knew he could trust you
[1:41:10] that none of this Darkness none of this
[1:41:12] Sodom condition none of this corrupt
[1:41:15] governments none of all of this nonsense
[1:41:17] could shake you
[1:41:20] [Music]
[1:41:23] Hallelujah
[1:41:27] I was thinking
[1:41:29] as I Was preparing
[1:41:32] now it's been several years
[1:41:36] and it became real to me in our country
[1:41:38] we have Graves that's about
[1:41:40] four or five hundred years old
[1:41:44] it's a great span of time that's really
[1:41:46] not that long
[1:41:48] some of our loved ones graves are just a
[1:41:51] few years old and some may be 30 40 50
[1:41:53] years old
[1:41:55] people that stood in this church in 1973
[1:41:57] 1974 has gone beyond the realm of time
[1:42:01] listen it they didn't have a lack of
[1:42:03] doubt
[1:42:04] they didn't have a lack of faith
[1:42:07] it was just their time to go home
[1:42:10] a man's born of woman few days and full
[1:42:12] of trouble and then they go home
[1:42:15] to their reward
[1:42:18] but God made them a promise they were
[1:42:20] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:22] Christ Romans chapter six they were
[1:42:24] baptized with a covenant that they'll
[1:42:27] raise
[1:42:28] and you can put six eight foot of dirt
[1:42:30] on top of them you have the best casket
[1:42:32] or a cardboard casket doesn't matter
[1:42:35] this body might go back to the ashes and
[1:42:38] even into the gases but God makes a
[1:42:40] promise
[1:42:41] but when I was standing in Ireland with
[1:42:43] brother George there was a deacon in
[1:42:46] Columbus church there was a deacon that
[1:42:49] was buried there some fourteen hundred
[1:42:51] years ago and no doubt he was a good
[1:42:54] Deacon no doubt he he did his best for
[1:42:57] pastor Columbo
[1:42:59] and when it came it's time to die they
[1:43:02] buried him in the ground a very close uh
[1:43:06] cemetery and they put a rock up and now
[1:43:08] even the writing weather has even has
[1:43:12] even rubbed the the stone to where that
[1:43:15] you can hardly read that this man lived
[1:43:17] from such and so to such and so and he
[1:43:20] was a deacon under Columbus in the
[1:43:22] church you can't hardly read it because
[1:43:24] it's almost gone but in God's Great Book
[1:43:30] in God's Great Book
[1:43:32] he's not in that tomb
[1:43:34] [Music]
[1:43:36] his body might be there but he stepped
[1:43:39] from that Dimension to another dimension
[1:43:41] leaving his body behind but one of these
[1:43:44] mornings
[1:43:47] one of these mornings no there's not
[1:43:49] going to come Angels down and dig all
[1:43:51] those Graves up they're going to stick
[1:43:53] step from that Dimension to another
[1:43:55] dimension
[1:43:59] if you would if you would take him out
[1:44:02] of the Grave there's probably not a
[1:44:03] pound of dust left inside of that tomb
[1:44:07] but he hasn't left lost one item
[1:44:11] when he stepped from this Dimension to
[1:44:13] that dimension
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:16] God's not just made promises to our
[1:44:19] loved ones but all the way back since
[1:44:21] the days of Jesus to those disciples
[1:44:26] tombs
[1:44:28] told them
[1:44:31] [Applause]
[1:44:40] I'd like to say this to you in the in
[1:44:42] the words of a song that we love so much
[1:44:44] Ain't No Grave
[1:44:49] ain't no game
[1:44:52] gonna hold my body down
[1:44:55] when I hear that trumpet sound
[1:44:58] I don't care about that ground
[1:45:00] because it ain't no claim
[1:45:07] hold my body down
[1:45:15] in an exercise of the seriousness of the
[1:45:17] disease that I fight
[1:45:19] one of the doctors asked me to prepare
[1:45:21] for a funeral prepare who would speak it
[1:45:24] and prepare
[1:45:25] where I would be buried
[1:45:28] and asked me for that copy of that
[1:45:32] well I did it
[1:45:35] I gave all the instructions to Matthew
[1:45:39] but I don't think I'm going to use them
[1:45:42] [Applause]
[1:45:57] be good for you with a woman Matthew
[1:45:58] ain't no need using them no way them
[1:46:00] preachers are busy
[1:46:03] they got things to do
[1:46:10] just for the insurance policy I didn't
[1:46:12] buy a casket and I didn't buy a tomb and
[1:46:14] I I'm not planning to use it
[1:46:19] it's kind of like Joseph with armathea
[1:46:22] this is Legend
[1:46:25] they buried Jesus in the Tomb he goes
[1:46:27] back in the house
[1:46:29] his wife looks at him and says
[1:46:31] but you dug that out for yourself
[1:46:35] he looks across the table at her and
[1:46:37] said oh not to worry
[1:46:40] he's only going to be there three days
[1:46:47] I know that's not thus saith the Lord
[1:46:49] but it's a good statement anyway isn't
[1:46:51] it
[1:46:54] no matter how much the message has been
[1:46:56] fought against
[1:46:59] it wasn't William branham's message
[1:47:02] it was the message of the Lamb
[1:47:06] and I want to say this it can't be
[1:47:08] stopped
[1:47:12] I want to say it again it cannot be
[1:47:15] stopped
[1:47:17] all the unbelief that has came against
[1:47:19] it didn't stop it
[1:47:22] you can hire guards
[1:47:25] to stand that Jesus's tomb
[1:47:28] and seal it up
[1:47:30] you can't stop it
[1:47:33] you can make stories about the disciples
[1:47:36] must have took the body away
[1:47:39] it don't matter
[1:47:41] you can't stop it
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:46] we got proof
[1:47:49] two guys had become delist disillusioned
[1:47:53] their Messiah
[1:47:55] had been beaten like no other human
[1:47:57] being
[1:47:58] they didn't understand that it was
[1:48:00] fulfilling Isaiah 53.
[1:48:04] because people like us needed healing
[1:48:14] and the prescription would never run out
[1:48:16] what in 30 days
[1:48:18] it wasn't 90 days
[1:48:21] the prescription wouldn't run out
[1:48:24] now we would not only need healing for
[1:48:26] our body we would need Resurrection
[1:48:32] we would need we would need knowing that
[1:48:35] we're born in sin listen if Rapture
[1:48:38] didn't happen how many since Jesus has
[1:48:41] died
[1:48:42] under expectation for the rapture
[1:48:45] and so and so Jesus knew I got to take
[1:48:48] care of them too
[1:48:52] [Applause]
[1:48:53] so that when they die they don't just
[1:48:55] lay there
[1:48:56] I got to have a place where they'll come
[1:48:58] and have a reunion
[1:49:01] following me okay
[1:49:03] follow me okay
[1:49:05] from every age they're going to have a
[1:49:07] reunion and they're going to blend
[1:49:08] together what age did you come out of
[1:49:10] laodicea how in the world did you make
[1:49:12] it
[1:49:14] oh there's still a lot of me coming
[1:49:19] there's still a lot of me coming
[1:49:21] well won't you just come and dance for a
[1:49:23] little while Jesus had to prepare for
[1:49:25] our going
[1:49:28] [Applause]
[1:49:30] and we would be lost
[1:49:33] we would be trapped by our natural DNA
[1:49:39] and Jerry
[1:49:43] there'll be things that would be handed
[1:49:45] down from your forefathers that you
[1:49:48] would have to fight and go and I've been
[1:49:50] raised in church but why should I be
[1:49:52] fighting this
[1:49:55] why should I be fighting this Jesus made
[1:49:58] a way to take care of that too
[1:50:02] and it's not your flesh and it's not
[1:50:04] your spirit
[1:50:06] although that Soul down on the inside of
[1:50:08] you when this word is ignited you can
[1:50:11] you can control that flesh in your
[1:50:13] spirit
[1:50:18] your father's coming
[1:50:22] he's coming
[1:50:25] now let me just say he had to prepare
[1:50:29] when you're coming sometimes you may
[1:50:31] watch your children go for a long time
[1:50:33] then all of a sudden boom it happens you
[1:50:36] can't save nobody else because you
[1:50:38] couldn't save yourself
[1:50:40] but Jesus knew what day they'd come
[1:50:42] he knew what hour that they would come
[1:50:45] so he's making an atonement so you could
[1:50:48] be saved
[1:50:49] you see
[1:50:51] he's not betting
[1:50:55] he's not iffing
[1:50:58] he knows every seed that he planted
[1:51:05] and listen you might be one of those
[1:51:07] wandering ones now on the internet
[1:51:11] and once in a while the spirit will come
[1:51:13] around you and he'll begin to pull on
[1:51:15] you but something distracts you for a
[1:51:17] little while and then he'll come around
[1:51:19] and he'll begin to pull on you and and
[1:51:21] then something to distract you one day
[1:51:26] one day that pull will come so strong
[1:51:30] you'll pass the water tank
[1:51:35] you'll pass the water tank and you go
[1:51:37] over here and then you go over another
[1:51:39] Hill and there stands Papa God and he
[1:51:43] says welcome home
[1:51:45] wow come home
[1:51:50] I'll say there's
[1:51:52] there's Macomb
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:52:06] no place
[1:52:08] like home
[1:52:10] Hallelujah don't you love the Lord
[1:52:13] isn't he good to us
[1:52:25] I can imagine the difficulty in the
[1:52:27] human flesh of Elisha
[1:52:36] he's coming down to his time to die
[1:52:39] and he's one short
[1:52:43] think about that
[1:52:46] he walked with Elijah for 10 years
[1:52:50] and he has just
[1:52:52] comes all the way up
[1:52:55] to one short in the miracle list
[1:53:00] said phenomenal miracles
[1:53:02] can you imagine how The Devil Wears in
[1:53:05] his ear
[1:53:06] bonjour
[1:53:09] message wasn't right you want you're one
[1:53:12] short
[1:53:15] he's taking his last breaths
[1:53:19] and he's one short
[1:53:21] that's Devil's whispering in his ear
[1:53:24] how many of you ever have the devil
[1:53:25] whisper in your ear
[1:53:28] I want to remind you something right
[1:53:29] here you're not the one that made the
[1:53:31] promise
[1:53:36] as a matter of fact you got very little
[1:53:38] to do with it other than just surrender
[1:53:41] and just yield
[1:53:43] you can't create a miracle
[1:53:46] you can't create Rapture you can't
[1:53:49] create Resurrection
[1:53:51] but it's your promise
[1:53:55] bonjour
[1:53:57] one Joy you're dying you're dying Elisha
[1:54:01] and you're one
[1:54:03] it proves Elijah wasn't a prophet it was
[1:54:06] just an illusion you saw him go up in
[1:54:09] the air
[1:54:10] must have been a day where you eat some
[1:54:11] greens
[1:54:13] a couple onions
[1:54:19] one sure
[1:54:23] Elijah wasn't trusting Elisha he was
[1:54:26] trusting God
[1:54:29] and they found a cave
[1:54:33] and put him in a grave
[1:54:37] no doubt they prepared his body and put
[1:54:40] it there
[1:54:44] you know his body begin to deteriorate
[1:54:47] right
[1:54:51] flesh began to fall off
[1:54:54] he became nothing but just dried skin
[1:54:58] laying on the bones
[1:55:00] as a matter of fact you could have never
[1:55:02] even identified who he was
[1:55:07] but obviously there had to be a marker
[1:55:11] and there was a war taking place
[1:55:15] and the War was happening
[1:55:18] and one of the guys got killed in the
[1:55:20] war
[1:55:22] and they were running
[1:55:24] and they just couldn't carry him
[1:55:27] and they found the hole
[1:55:30] this was going to be his tomb
[1:55:34] but he didn't really they didn't realize
[1:55:37] somebody else was already in it
[1:55:42] and the guy that was one short still had
[1:55:45] a promise
[1:55:48] there's going to be a resurrection
[1:55:51] hang around
[1:55:53] there's going to be a body change
[1:56:05] oh brother nobody can live this look
[1:56:07] around
[1:56:10] we're not a bunch of prisoners to this
[1:56:12] world look around
[1:56:13] we got all kind of joy we got all kind
[1:56:16] of Liberty look around
[1:56:20] brother Ron I don't like how y'all dance
[1:56:22] just look around
[1:56:26] I Sing Because I'm happy I shout because
[1:56:30] I'm free
[1:56:31] [Applause]
[1:56:37] now I don't know how this guy died and
[1:56:39] it's immature
[1:56:41] but he died
[1:56:42] life
[1:56:44] left his body
[1:56:46] and they took him
[1:56:47] and they didn't have time for a funeral
[1:56:50] they took him and they throwed him one
[1:56:52] tomb on top of another tomb
[1:56:57] I like this
[1:56:59] one tomb went on top of another tomb
[1:57:02] and they throwed this Soldier down on a
[1:57:05] man that had a promise
[1:57:10] and it must have happened almost
[1:57:11] simultaneously
[1:57:14] because this guy caught up with those
[1:57:17] guys
[1:57:30] no doubt he didn't know how he died but
[1:57:32] he knew how he came out back to life
[1:57:35] now here's what happens
[1:57:37] you can take this down to the graveyard
[1:57:40] and you can lay this body down
[1:57:42] but because I've been throwed into
[1:57:44] another tomb
[1:57:47] I've been throwed in the word Jesus is
[1:57:49] at
[1:57:51] life
[1:57:53] life
[1:57:55] and let me just explain something to you
[1:57:57] this might be good for you
[1:58:00] in this life
[1:58:03] Satan can wear you out
[1:58:11] but once he comes in with that bee
[1:58:15] and takes your life that's his last spot
[1:58:20] that's the last time he can touch you
[1:58:22] because once you step from this
[1:58:25] dimension
[1:58:26] to that dimension
[1:58:29] brother Doug I'm sorry but you had to
[1:58:30] come back to life
[1:58:33] but once you step from this Dimension to
[1:58:36] that dimension
[1:58:38] around and go
[1:58:41] [Applause]
