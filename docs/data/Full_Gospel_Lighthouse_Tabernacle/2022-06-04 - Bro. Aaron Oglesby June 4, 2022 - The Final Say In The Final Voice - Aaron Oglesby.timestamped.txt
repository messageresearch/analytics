[43:51] it says and unto the angel of the church
[43:52] of the laodiceans write
[43:54] these things saith the amen
[43:57] the faithful and true witness the
[44:00] beginning of the creation of god
[44:03] skipping down now to verse 21
[44:06] to him that overcometh do you see

[44:11] tonight
[44:12] amen to him that overcometh will i grant
[44:15] to sit with me in my throne even as i
[44:17] also overcame and am set down with my
[44:20] father in his throne amen if you would
[44:23] now turn with me over to revelation 10 7
[44:26] verses that we should be very familiar
[44:28] with
[44:31] i'm going to read down through verse 11.
[44:33] it says but in the days of the voice of
[44:35] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[44:37] sound the mystery of god should be
[44:39] finished as he hath declared to his
[44:42] servants the prophets
[44:44] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[44:45] spake unto me and said go and take the
[44:47] little book which is open in the hand of
[44:49] the angel which standeth upon the sea
[44:51] and upon the earth
[44:52] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[44:54] him give me the little book and he said
[44:57] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[44:59] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[45:02] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i
[45:04] took the little book out of the angel's
[45:06] hand and ate it ate it up and it was in
[45:08] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[45:10] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[45:14] said unto me
[45:16] thou must prophesy again
[45:18] before many peoples and nations and
[45:21] tongues
[45:23] and kings amen i pray that god will add
[45:25] his blessing to the word as you have
[45:26] your seats
[45:30] wonderful words of life
[45:33] prophetic words
[45:38] as we get into this tonight what i'd
[45:39] like to speak to you on for a little bit
[45:42] is the final say
[45:44] in the final voice
[45:46] the final say
[45:48] in the final voice it's very important
[45:51] for us as christians it's very important
[45:53] that we recognize the supreme authority
[45:56] of god in and over every situation
[46:00] every situation that you may face
[46:02] everything that you're going to come up
[46:03] against understand that god is in total
[46:06] and complete control there is only one
[46:10] who has the final say there is only one
[46:13] who has the final say and that is the
[46:15] lord jesus christ
[46:17] our opening scripture there described
[46:19] him as the amen the faithful and the
[46:22] true witness amen this is somebody that
[46:24] can be counted on it's somebody that you
[46:26] can put your hopes and dreams in it's
[46:28] somebody you can rest your very soul
[46:30] with he is the amen he's true and he's
[46:33] faithful
[46:34] prophet of god would say i looked up in
[46:36] the dictionary webster's according to
[46:37] webster's it's perfect in itself
[46:40] unlimited in its power primarily an
[46:43] ultimate and an ultimate is the amen
[46:46] that's all an absolute it's the
[46:48] unlimited empower the word absolute it's
[46:52] perfect in itself that's all of it that
[46:55] settles it an absolute it's used many
[46:58] times it's the last word it's the amen
[47:01] you hear people say absolutely that's
[47:04] all that's the last thing it's unlimited
[47:06] c that takes it from here on there's
[47:08] nothing else in its way it's the amen
[47:12] that's all that's what he is the amen
[47:16] see he's got the last word to say so i
[47:20] want to tell you tonight that no matter
[47:21] what's going on in your life there's one
[47:23] that holds it all there's one who has
[47:25] the final say you can look to him you
[47:27] can trust in his word it is the final
[47:30] say in your life tonight he is the amen
[47:34] aren't you glad tonight that he is the
[47:36] amen aren't you glad tonight that he has
[47:38] the final say my opinion of you tonight
[47:40] is not the final say the doctor's report
[47:43] tonight is not the final save what
[47:45] you've been going through and the things
[47:46] the devil has poured out on you and the
[47:48] things he's saying is definitely not the
[47:51] final say but there's one that said i
[47:53] have washed you i have given you the
[47:55] holy ghost i will give you a rapture i
[47:58] have gone to prepare a place that's the
[48:00] final say that's all that matters that's
[48:02] where i'm looking tonight he is the
[48:05] final say in our life tonight church
[48:07] hallelujah he is the final say the plans
[48:11] that the enemy has made for you and has
[48:13] been telling you for years and telling
[48:15] you you're going to fall and telling you
[48:17] you're not going to make it is not the
[48:19] final say but the i
[48:21] am god the one who blew the galaxies off
[48:25] his hands the one who created everything
[48:27] the one who made the very body you're in
[48:30] he says i'm in control of it i have the
[48:32] final say over it and i'm going to take
[48:34] care of my word
[48:37] he has the final say in your life
[48:40] he is omnipotent
[48:43] he is the amen
[48:45] that means that not only does he have
[48:47] the final say brother andrew
[48:49] he is the final say
[48:52] it's not just that he's in control of it
[48:54] that is what he is
[48:57] that's how we can trust
[48:59] it's important sometimes in our emotions
[49:01] and when we when we get down and we look
[49:03] and we say how we say why and and god
[49:05] how did did the devil get away with this
[49:10] how did he do that
[49:12] and we began to ponder within ourselves
[49:14] and
[49:15] and that's how though in these
[49:16] situations we can trust
[49:19] we can fully trust him when things
[49:21] happen that we can't understand
[49:23] it would be so hard to deal with things
[49:26] it would be so hard to trust and
[49:27] understand if every time our life got
[49:30] turned upside down or every time we lost
[49:32] a loved one or every time things just
[49:35] went totally opposite from the way we
[49:36] thought it should have went that we felt
[49:38] like it was the devil that had had the
[49:40] final say
[49:41] if we felt like oh my goodness he the
[49:43] devil did this that dev no that's not
[49:45] how it works though he had no say in it
[49:48] whatsoever it was not the devil that had
[49:51] the final say my god had the final say
[49:54] there was no victory for the enemy there
[49:56] was no victory for satan
[49:58] god had the final say in the situation
[50:01] even if you can't understand how it
[50:03] turned out
[50:05] he was in control he had the final say
[50:07] the enemy did not get a victory there
[50:10] was no victory
[50:12] for the enemy
[50:13] we can rest knowing tonight that he had
[50:16] the final say there was no defeat in our
[50:18] life
[50:19] god's hand was in it because the devil
[50:21] does not have a say in our lives listen
[50:24] it's not a democracy the devil don't get
[50:26] a vote
[50:27] he has no say in how this thing's going
[50:29] to turn out he has no say in whether or
[50:31] not you make it your name was written on
[50:33] the lamb's book of life before the
[50:35] foundation of the world so the first day
[50:38] is the final say the first thing it said
[50:41] is the end of it all you're gonna make
[50:44] it
[50:45] he don't get a vote he don't get a save
[50:49] hallelujah
[50:51] oh this is a monarchy it's one king
[50:54] one voice he said you're gonna make it
[50:57] you're gonna make it
[50:58] hallelujah
[51:01] [Music]
[51:02] glory to god
[51:11] [Music]
[51:13] the finals say
[51:15] the plan of god is never defeated
[51:18] stormy skies
[51:20] rough waters dark trials they are not
[51:22] signs of sin in your life or god's
[51:25] disapproval in your life
[51:27] get that out of your head
[51:29] or that satan's gaining victory over you
[51:31] because things ain't going exactly right
[51:34] maybe you're being molded
[51:36] may be tested and tried
[51:39] but god's purpose will be fulfilled in
[51:41] it whatever it is
[51:44] what we have to learn how to do and it's
[51:45] difficult sometimes
[51:47] is to find the purpose in the trial
[51:52] find the purpose
[51:54] in the trial in recognizing
[51:56] that it's working together for your good
[51:59] now here's the reason so many of us
[52:01] myself included for years couldn't
[52:03] understand that scripture
[52:05] because you look at that all things work
[52:07] together for good and you just can't
[52:09] make some things be good no matter how
[52:10] you look at it
[52:12] i don't care what you say that ain't
[52:14] good
[52:18] the problem is we're basing it off of
[52:20] what's good for us here
[52:22] what's good for this
[52:24] what's good for my bank account what's
[52:25] good for my physical health what's but
[52:27] he ain't worried about that so much
[52:30] when he says it works together for your
[52:31] good he means your eternal good what's
[52:34] it going to take to get you there what's
[52:36] it going to take to get you eternal life
[52:38] and all things you go through are
[52:40] working together for the good of that
[52:43] it is working together in accordance to
[52:45] that plan and for your eternal good
[52:49] jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts
[52:52] that i think towards you saith the lord
[52:55] thoughts of peace not of evil to give
[52:57] you an
[52:58] expected end
[53:01] thoughts here means plans
[53:03] if you look it up the thoughts means i
[53:04] know the plans
[53:06] that i have for you
[53:08] i've already planned it out i know
[53:10] exactly what's going to happen yes and
[53:12] it may not seem good but it's working to
[53:14] an expected end you're going through
[53:17] these things but it's going to get you
[53:19] right here where i need you to be
[53:24] satan has plans
[53:26] we see them all through the bible
[53:29] peter satan has desired to sift you as
[53:31] wheat that's his plans
[53:33] but i've prayed for you
[53:35] he has plans and throughout the
[53:37] scripture we constantly see them time
[53:39] and time again
[53:41] because our god is the is the amen he's
[53:44] the one that has the final say so so
[53:46] whenever his word is spoken it will not
[53:50] return unto him void no matter what it
[53:52] has to go through no matter what a
[53:54] situation rises we see in the very
[53:56] beginning satan begins making plans that
[53:58] he's going to be exalted and he's going
[54:00] to be worshiped and he begins to make
[54:02] all these big grand glorious plans
[54:06] and even though it would seem there was
[54:07] some level of success
[54:10] he's then cast out of heaven
[54:12] and his plan doesn't work in heaven the
[54:14] way he thought so he comes down to earth
[54:17] and we see him in the garden doing what
[54:20] making plans
[54:21] he's making plans and he's trying to
[54:23] find his way back in trying to find his
[54:25] way back into a position of authority
[54:27] into your position
[54:29] and he wants to take that and he's
[54:30] working and he brings deception and he
[54:33] has a plan to regain power and cause man
[54:36] to fall and he brings a twisted version
[54:38] of the word
[54:41] understand it was still a version of the
[54:44] word
[54:45] the most dangerous things aren't just
[54:47] bald-faced lies they're things that have
[54:49] a version of the word mixed in with them
[54:52] and he brings a twisted version of the
[54:54] word and he changes one little word
[54:58] let me tell you something every single
[55:02] word of this matters
[55:04] every little part matters we got to get
[55:07] to the place where we quit looking at
[55:09] this as maybe not so as important as
[55:10] this and this doesn't matter as much as
[55:13] this if it's in the word
[55:15] it matters if the prophet of god spoke
[55:17] it it matters we can't just look at it
[55:19] well maybe that was his opinion and
[55:21] maybe this and maybe that listen if it's
[55:24] on the message if it's in the bible it
[55:26] matters tonight
[55:28] all right it's very important oh well
[55:30] that's a little old-fashioned and maybe
[55:32] that's his opinion well okay let's just
[55:34] entertain that for a minute maybe it was
[55:37] but i'll take the opinion of someone who
[55:39] spent so much time in the presence of
[55:40] the angel versus your opinion
[55:43] where is your vindication when has god
[55:46] spoke through you when has the dead been
[55:48] raised in your ministry
[55:57] but he brings deception by twisting one
[55:59] little part
[56:00] and he causes adam's bride to fall
[56:04] and then we know that adam fell with or
[56:05] not deceived but he willingly goes
[56:08] and the whole earth under adam falls and
[56:10] satan believes i've won
[56:14] he begins to feel like he's one and and
[56:17] now sin and death are going to reign in
[56:19] mortal bodies
[56:20] but right here in this moment we learn
[56:22] something very important
[56:24] we serve a determined god
[56:26] we serve a god who ain't going to give
[56:27] up on his plan he's not going to give up
[56:29] on this bride and no matter what the
[56:31] devil's telling you he is not going to
[56:32] give up on you he has not given up on
[56:35] you it doesn't matter what he has to do
[56:37] it doesn't matter how far you've gone
[56:39] our god is still fighting for you and
[56:41] the devil is telling you things that are
[56:43] absolute lies my god has the final say
[56:45] in your life my god has the final say in
[56:48] your life and he's not giving up on you
[56:50] he is determined that he will have
[56:52] victory in your life
[56:54] satan thinks he's one
[56:56] and we learn in that moment in earth
[57:00] the worst moment of earth history as it
[57:02] were
[57:03] right there
[57:05] love projects
[57:07] you know that's one thing that the devil
[57:08] can't never understand he can't never
[57:10] figure it out he don't understand he
[57:12] ruined your life he put smut over your
[57:14] life he put sin in your life he calls
[57:16] you to do things you're ashamed of
[57:18] things you're embarrassed of things you
[57:19] would never tell and he thinks i got him
[57:21] now oh yeah he can't have him now i've
[57:23] covered him up but he just can't
[57:25] understand l o v e it doesn't matter
[57:29] what he does to you you're god's child
[57:31] you're god's son you're god's daughter
[57:34] and he loves you and he'll come
[57:35] searching for you and he'll fight for
[57:37] you it don't matter where you're at
[57:39] tonight he says i love you
[57:41] i love you i died for you i'm calling
[57:45] you satan just can't wrap his mind
[57:47] around it he can't do it god says that's
[57:50] my child i love them
[57:54] hallelujah he loves you tonight
[57:56] [Applause]
[58:02] in that moment love projects and a
[58:04] savior is promised
[58:06] brother william even mentioned this in
[58:08] his prayer
[58:10] and when god says something it's an
[58:11] absolute
[58:14] brother brown says there in the garden
[58:15] that morning when sin was so black
[58:18] jehovah come in
[58:20] there stood his couple standing
[58:21] condemned
[58:22] there would be no more human race
[58:25] they had to die
[58:26] death on the human race give the world
[58:28] back to the wild beast there'd be no
[58:31] human race but in the darkest hour
[58:33] in that time when all hopes was gone
[58:35] grace come pouring through
[58:37] said i'll give you a savior a messiah oh
[58:40] it's a wonder how god could ever do it
[58:42] god's amazing grace in the garden of
[58:45] eden that give them the promise of a
[58:47] just one who could come through the
[58:49] woman the woman's seed shall bruise the
[58:52] serpent's head the guilty one
[58:55] and his head shall bruise her heel to
[58:57] show there had been an affliction to the
[58:58] church but he promised a triumph
[59:02] what provided a savior
[59:04] grace
[59:07] he goes on to say in revelation 21 3 and
[59:10] 4 the tabernacle of god is with man god
[59:14] has tabernacled him man by redeeming him
[59:16] by these three process
[59:18] now god is going to redeem the earth
[59:21] and the tabernacle in the earth with his
[59:23] subjects of the earth which he brought
[59:26] forth from the earth and through sin it
[59:29] fell but he had to let it go on but now
[59:32] he sent jesus to redeem that fallen
[59:34] earth which we are a part of
[59:38] there not one hair of your head will
[59:40] perish jesus said so he said i'll raise
[59:42] it up again at the last day see why
[59:45] you're part of the earth
[59:48] the germ of god the life of god was
[59:50] designed in the womb of a woman which
[59:52] was the earth all right and then the
[59:54] life of god came in so he was the
[59:56] beginning of the creation of god see and
[59:59] then that blood of god that was there by
[1:00:02] that germ when it was shed at calvary
[1:00:04] dropped back upon the earth what for to
[1:00:07] redeem the earth now it's been justified
[1:00:10] it's been sanctified called and claimed
[1:00:12] and now is to receive its baptism of
[1:00:14] fire and be cleansed for jesus
[1:00:18] and his bride
[1:00:20] when satan fell he not only wanted to
[1:00:22] destroy you he wanted to destroy every
[1:00:23] part of god's creation
[1:00:25] he wanted a destruction of the earth but
[1:00:27] god was so determined he said i'm even
[1:00:29] going to redeem the dust that i've
[1:00:31] called my people out of i'm going to
[1:00:33] redeem every last part of it
[1:00:37] hallelujah
[1:00:38] we got to get it out of our minds
[1:00:39] tonight that satan has a saying
[1:00:42] god is in absolute control of everything
[1:00:46] his word is absolute and he is limitless
[1:00:50] in his power he is limitless now this is
[1:00:53] important to know because satan does
[1:00:55] have power
[1:00:57] satan has power
[1:00:59] but his power is a limited power whereas
[1:01:02] the power of our god is limitless
[1:01:07] what limits the power of the devil what
[1:01:10] limits him you can limit the power of
[1:01:12] the devil by the power of the holy ghost
[1:01:14] in your life by taking the word upon
[1:01:16] your lips and putting the devil in his
[1:01:19] place by not giving ear to the word that
[1:01:22] he speaks to you by not putting that
[1:01:24] word that he speaks on your lips quit
[1:01:26] giving a voice to the devil
[1:01:29] oh he can talk in your ear all yours but
[1:01:32] don't repeat anything he says don't give
[1:01:33] him a voice don't speak his word i got a
[1:01:36] word you can speak if you've got
[1:01:37] something you need to say tonight by his
[1:01:40] strengths i'm healed how to lead to him
[1:01:43] that overcometh will i grant to sit with
[1:01:45] me and my throne
[1:01:47] oh the promise is unto them and unto
[1:01:49] their children unto as many as the lord
[1:01:51] our god shall call there's something to
[1:01:54] repeat there's something to put on your
[1:01:56] lips
[1:01:58] you can limit the power of the enemy
[1:02:01] he only has whatever power you
[1:02:02] relinquish to him
[1:02:04] whatever you give to him his only voice
[1:02:07] is when you speak what he tells you
[1:02:13] he has the power to
[1:02:15] whip up a storm
[1:02:17] you have the power to say peace be still
[1:02:24] when god says stop he has to stop
[1:02:28] when he's told that's far enough
[1:02:30] he can't take another step
[1:02:32] look it's time you tell him tonight
[1:02:35] it's time you let him know tonight this
[1:02:37] time you take the word of god upon your
[1:02:38] lips you say devil you ain't taking
[1:02:40] another step in my life you ain't taking
[1:02:42] another step in my marriage you ain't
[1:02:44] taking another step in my home you can't
[1:02:46] have my health you can't have my
[1:02:48] children you can't have my praise you
[1:02:51] have taken it back tonight you've gone
[1:02:53] as far as you're gonna go in my life i'm
[1:02:56] gonna walk with god i'm gonna overcome
[1:02:58] i'm taking another step tonight oh
[1:03:00] you've gone far enough
[1:03:03] you're not going to tear up the church
[1:03:04] you're not going to come in and go
[1:03:06] stride you're not going to come in and
[1:03:07] cause division amongst the brothers
[1:03:09] you've gone far enough
[1:03:12] furthermore i will not be a tool to
[1:03:14] cause vision i will not be a tool to
[1:03:17] cause strife no but i will be one that
[1:03:19] comes in unity of the holy ghost to
[1:03:22] press towards the mark of the high
[1:03:24] calling

[1:03:30] i will be used by
[1:03:36] it's time some of us say peace be still

[1:03:54] he deserves your praise
[1:03:57] matter of fact he deserves more praise
[1:03:59] than you could ever give him
[1:04:01] so he sure at least deserves that much
[1:04:05] too many of us
[1:04:07] oh when i get to victory you ain't never
[1:04:09] seen a dance like that
[1:04:11] when i get the victory i'm gonna shout
[1:04:13] all over the place the thing is
[1:04:15] sometimes we forget our victory's on the
[1:04:16] other side of the praise sometimes the
[1:04:19] dance is on the other side of the red
[1:04:21] sea i'm just gonna walk on out i'm gonna
[1:04:23] go ahead and give him some praise i'm
[1:04:25] gonna go ahead and shout i'm gonna go
[1:04:27] ahead and bless his name

[1:08:42] it tonight you can overcome those things
[1:08:44] tonight
[1:08:45] so my god shows up and things change
[1:08:48] it don't matter how long you've been in
[1:08:49] that lost situation it didn't matter if
[1:08:52] lazarus had been dead four days
[1:08:54] he didn't say i wish i'd have been here
[1:08:57] he didn't say if i'd have been here
[1:08:58] things would have been different he said
[1:09:01] where'd you laying
[1:09:02] where'd you lay him at tonight where'd
[1:09:04] you lay your hopes where'd you lay your
[1:09:06] dreams where'd you lay your piece at
[1:09:09] tonight where'd you lay it at where'd
[1:09:11] you lay the ones you've given up on
[1:09:13] where'd you lay your children at tonight
[1:09:15] wear the hat because he's still rolling
[1:09:18] stones away tonight he'll show up in
[1:09:20] your situation where'd you lay it at
[1:09:22] tonight
[1:09:24] oh he's here tonight to do the work he's
[1:09:26] here tonight to meet your need
[1:09:29] where have you laid all those things
[1:09:35] where's your joy buried at
[1:09:42] look i know man life's real
[1:09:45] things come in your childhood
[1:09:47] people did you wrong in church
[1:09:50] you got scars from maybe things you
[1:09:52] don't even want to talk about
[1:09:54] that's real stuff man
[1:09:58] people scarred you people did you wrong
[1:10:01] and so in the course of all that you
[1:10:02] begin to believe the lie that says you
[1:10:04] ain't very much you ain't worth very
[1:10:05] much
[1:10:06] you ain't gonna make it you ain't worth
[1:10:08] nothing
[1:10:09] then those lies become your grave
[1:10:10] clothes
[1:10:12] and you get wrapped all up in those lies
[1:10:14] and wrapped up in those complexes
[1:10:16] let me tell you what sometimes if we
[1:10:18] hold on to the truth the way we hold
[1:10:19] onto a complex we'd be all right
[1:10:21] we'd be some free people tonight
[1:10:25] but we let complexes ruin our lives and
[1:10:28] ruin our families and create cycles and
[1:10:30] we view everything through a complex we
[1:10:32] view what the preacher says through a
[1:10:33] complex we view what our neighbor says
[1:10:36] through a complex and we can't rightly
[1:10:37] divide nothing anymore because you're
[1:10:39] looking at the world through a lie
[1:10:44] and these things become grave clothes
[1:10:46] and then you get put in the grave and
[1:10:47] the enemy rolls a stone over the
[1:10:49] entrance of everything god intended you
[1:10:51] to be
[1:10:53] i'm saying tonight roll the stone away i
[1:10:56] say roll the stone away let's push the
[1:10:58] stone away hey let me tell you something
[1:11:00] jesus didn't even roll the stone away
[1:11:02] he had some sisters go roll the stone
[1:11:04] away some of us need to come with the
[1:11:06] attitude that tonight it may not be me
[1:11:08] wrapped up in great clothes but i'm
[1:11:09] going to push some stones away i'm gonna
[1:11:11] put my shoulder in there i'm gonna
[1:11:13] worship i'm gonna praise i'm gonna
[1:11:15] create an atmosphere where people can be
[1:11:17] set free where the lost can be loose
[1:11:21] loose them and set them free tonight
[1:11:24] [Applause]
[1:11:25] push the stone away
[1:11:28] glory
[1:11:41] the finals say yeah i say the devil's
[1:11:43] had enough say in your life tonight
[1:11:47] we've let him have enough
[1:11:50] god had promised a redeemer
[1:11:52] he had promised a savior
[1:11:55] and here he was standing there at the
[1:11:56] tomb of lazarus some 4 000 years later
[1:12:00] the manifestation of every old testament
[1:12:02] prophecy
[1:12:04] standing there in the flesh
[1:12:06] here he was
[1:12:08] god was skin on him
[1:12:11] doing the works of god
[1:12:13] but in humanity
[1:12:15] the second adam
[1:12:18] he is the god of the amen he never
[1:12:20] changes
[1:12:21] what he
[1:12:22] does never changes he says it and it
[1:12:24] stands fast he does it and it is done
[1:12:26] forever
[1:12:28] none can take from what he says or add
[1:12:30] to it so let it be
[1:12:32] so let it be aren't you glad that you
[1:12:33] serve that kind of god you can know
[1:12:36] exactly where you are with him at any
[1:12:38] time and all the time he is the amen god
[1:12:41] and won't change
[1:12:42] these things saith the amen i like that
[1:12:45] it means that whatever he said is final
[1:12:48] it means that whatever he said to the
[1:12:50] first age and to the second and to all
[1:12:51] the ages about his own true church and
[1:12:53] about the false vine is exactly right
[1:12:56] and it won't change it means that what
[1:12:58] he started out with in genesis he will
[1:13:00] finish in revelation he has to for he is
[1:13:04] the amen
[1:13:05] so
[1:13:06] let it
[1:13:07] be
[1:13:09] we saw right there that he began to plan
[1:13:11] for redemption there in genesis
[1:13:14] and then now through time every story
[1:13:16] and every type
[1:13:17] every life lived is building towards the
[1:13:19] manifestation of a redeemer
[1:13:23] prophecies of his coming types and
[1:13:25] shadows
[1:13:26] looking forward
[1:13:28] a spoken word
[1:13:30] son of god born of a virgin
[1:13:33] one who would restore
[1:13:35] one who would heal the sick
[1:13:37] one who would wipe away the curse who
[1:13:39] could make the blind see in the death
[1:13:41] here and here he stands
[1:13:44] standing right there in their midst the
[1:13:46] full manifestation of all the word
[1:13:49] of all of it doing exactly what the word
[1:13:52] said he would do
[1:13:54] and the entire time from genesis all the
[1:13:56] way down to this moment satan trying to
[1:13:59] stop it at every turn
[1:14:01] watching trying to figure out wait this
[1:14:03] one here and that one there and so he'll
[1:14:06] have this one kill this one and well he
[1:14:07] must have missed something because it's
[1:14:08] still moving on here and then he goes
[1:14:10] here and he tries to stop it but god's
[1:14:12] raising up something over here and he's
[1:14:14] always one step ahead because see our
[1:14:16] god is the final say he's the amen he
[1:14:18] knows the beginning from the end but
[1:14:20] satan has to react to what he sees going
[1:14:22] on he has to react to it so he's got you
[1:14:24] down and he feels like he's got you
[1:14:26] snuffed out and all of a sudden one
[1:14:27] sunday morning you wake up and you're
[1:14:29] going to church and he's going wait
[1:14:30] what's going on here we got to put a
[1:14:32] stop to this here because i thought i
[1:14:34] had him here but something moved here in
[1:14:36] his bedroom during the night
[1:14:37] and all of a sudden before he knows that
[1:14:39] you're down at the altar weeping your
[1:14:40] way to calvary he tried to stop it he
[1:14:43] tried to snuff it out he tried to get
[1:14:45] this when he tried to bring complexes
[1:14:47] and he tried to bring revival and death
[1:14:49] and sin and curse but somebody is going
[1:14:51] to be a cycle breaker and before he knew
[1:14:54] it there you were breaking the cycles of
[1:14:56] your family of your daddy of your
[1:14:58] granddaddy overcoming because he didn't
[1:15:00] see it coming
[1:15:02] he thought for sure he had you covered
[1:15:03] up and you can see it all down through
[1:15:05] the old testament
[1:15:07] no matter what he tried always trying to
[1:15:10] stop what god's doing no matter what he
[1:15:12] did and the thing is no matter what he
[1:15:14] did he never realized that but he was
[1:15:16] always playing right into the hand of
[1:15:17] god amen
[1:15:21] the whole time you could see that with
[1:15:22] with the jews and nazi germany
[1:15:25] the whole time putting them back in
[1:15:27] their homeland
[1:15:28] you see it at calvary he would have
[1:15:30] never let that blood strike the earth
[1:15:33] he would have never let him have those
[1:15:35] stripes if he knew you'd have been
[1:15:36] healed from him he'd never let him shed
[1:15:39] that blood if he'd known it was gonna
[1:15:40] wash you from the sin's curse he'd never
[1:15:43] let it happen especially knowing that
[1:15:44] once he died and rose again he was gonna
[1:15:46] send back the holy ghost and instead of
[1:15:48] one jesus there's gonna be thousands of
[1:15:49] them he had to deal with
[1:15:51] they was going to be all over the place
[1:15:53] and every time he turned around there's
[1:15:54] one there's one there's some in virginia
[1:15:56] there's some in louisiana there's some
[1:15:58] in tennessee everywhere i go there's
[1:16:00] jesus jesus jesus how do you know it's
[1:16:02] jesus because he's doing the same things
[1:16:04] he did on the shores of galilee every
[1:16:06] time he shows up i'm cast out everywhere
[1:16:09] he shows up the sick are healed the
[1:16:11] death here in the blonde sea it's jesus
[1:16:15] he would have never let it happen
[1:16:19] but the plan of god cannot be stopped
[1:16:21] because his plan is the final saying
[1:16:26] and so many times am i going to make it
[1:16:28] that the devil told me
[1:16:30] what the devil's saying
[1:16:32] oh he's in my hair and i'm not gonna
[1:16:35] your name is already written down
[1:16:38] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:41] listen he can do what he wants to do he
[1:16:42] can't stop it
[1:16:44] he ain't got enough
[1:16:46] he ain't got enough
[1:16:49] he's released 200 million million
[1:16:51] whatever number that is demons from the
[1:16:53] river euphrates and it ain't enough
[1:16:55] he can't stop you he can't stop your
[1:16:57] family he can't stop this bride i'm
[1:16:59] telling you you will make it you've
[1:17:03] already made it you are the spoken word
[1:17:06] bride of jesus christ standing on your
[1:17:09] feet
[1:17:10] think about that this message smoke you
[1:17:12] into existence
[1:17:15] you were here because a message went
[1:17:17] forth and it created what i'm looking at
[1:17:20] tonight
[1:17:21] a people restored back to the original
[1:17:24] with the original power just like in the
[1:17:26] book of acts
[1:17:32] he can no more stop you than he stopped
[1:17:33] jesus
[1:17:36] he couldn't stop the true church born in
[1:17:38] the upper room
[1:17:39] he tried to stomp it out with
[1:17:40] persecutions
[1:17:42] tried to cover it up with false
[1:17:44] doctrines
[1:17:45] tried to make the church cold and formal
[1:17:48] say oh just believe and you got it
[1:17:51] tried to stomp out the real fire
[1:17:54] and what it is he began to eat the
[1:17:55] leaves off the tree
[1:17:57] but the amen had already said
[1:17:59] i will restore
[1:18:00] before he ever took one leaf off the
[1:18:02] tree the amen said i'm going to restore
[1:18:05] the tree
[1:18:06] because he's always ahead he always has
[1:18:08] the final say the amen had already spoke
[1:18:11] behold i sent unto you elijah the
[1:18:13] prophet
[1:18:14] out comes william brown out goes a
[1:18:17] message and out from that message comes
[1:18:20] you
[1:18:22] standing here in the last day it's
[1:18:24] incredible when you begin to look
[1:18:26] through the scripture and you can see
[1:18:27] and you see these people and and many
[1:18:29] times it's stories and it's oh i see
[1:18:31] that one and they live this life and i
[1:18:33] see now how that event ties into this
[1:18:35] event because there was a prophecy that
[1:18:37] said that and then i see this and all of
[1:18:39] a sudden you're reading along and you go
[1:18:42] that's me
[1:18:45] that's me
[1:18:47] what was all this about it was about me
[1:18:49] it was about you and you and you and you
[1:18:51] and you it was all about me it was all
[1:18:53] about a bride it was all about one that
[1:18:56] would match him on the earth once again
[1:18:58] in this final day
[1:19:00] i'm in there i'm in the word which means
[1:19:03] i'm in the plan
[1:19:04] which means i can't be stopped which
[1:19:06] means everything he promised about me
[1:19:08] will come to pass
[1:19:10] i will not be stopped and i will not be
[1:19:12] hindered
[1:19:14] but what started in genesis is still
[1:19:16] marching right on the full plan of
[1:19:18] redemption the plan that i will have a
[1:19:22] bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:19:24] i will have it yeah and the thing is
[1:19:27] i didn't say it
[1:19:29] i say it all the time but i mean it i
[1:19:31] look at myself and i look at my life and
[1:19:33] i go i alone would mess that scripture
[1:19:34] up i got plenty of spots
[1:19:38] i got plenty of wrinkles
[1:19:40] but there's blood
[1:19:43] and there's a plan and there's a word
[1:19:45] spoken that i don't have to bring that
[1:19:47] word to pass he does so i can just trust
[1:19:51] and say that's the final say
[1:19:53] he's the one that said it it has to come
[1:19:55] to pass
[1:19:57] one thing after another pointing that we
[1:19:58] have a determined god
[1:20:00] determined that i will have a bride that
[1:20:02] will not fall
[1:20:03] and yet an enemy determined i'm going to
[1:20:05] stop this
[1:20:07] i'm going to stop this confident that
[1:20:09] just like in the garden he can make this
[1:20:11] bride fall
[1:20:12] so confident
[1:20:15] and yet
[1:20:16] my god was so confident that he said i
[1:20:19] go to prepare a place for you
[1:20:21] you think he's worried about whether or
[1:20:23] not you're going to show up
[1:20:25] he's already went to prepare a place
[1:20:27] he's already went to prepare a place for
[1:20:30] you
[1:20:31] he's so confident that you're coming
[1:20:33] that his plan is going to work that you
[1:20:34] were going to reach full manifestation
[1:20:37] of everything he thought of you before
[1:20:39] the foundation of the world
[1:20:42] brother brown says now for nearly 2 000
[1:20:44] years god has been again making him a
[1:20:45] masterpiece because he struck adam to
[1:20:48] get a masterpiece off of him part of a
[1:20:50] rib a rib to make a wife for him and now
[1:20:52] that perfect masterpiece that he struck
[1:20:54] at calvary he got a piece off of him
[1:20:56] it's just the new testament that's all
[1:20:58] he fulfilled the old testament
[1:21:01] now it's the new testament another piece
[1:21:04] to be fulfilled now see the the new and
[1:21:07] old as husband and wife see and it taken
[1:21:10] the old to foreshadow the new christ
[1:21:12] come the masterpiece to fulfill that now
[1:21:15] his bride will fulfill everything that's
[1:21:19] in the new testament another masterpiece
[1:21:22] in the making
[1:21:24] well i don't feel like a masterpiece
[1:21:26] well neither do i but don't worry about
[1:21:28] what you feel like tonight the finals
[1:21:30] say the amen the the the faithful
[1:21:32] witness has said you're gonna overcome
[1:21:35] you're gonna fulfill everything there so
[1:21:37] it doesn't matter what you feel like or
[1:21:39] what the enemy's saying tonight trust in
[1:21:41] the amen god tonight
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:48] it's already 8 20.
[1:21:50] help me lord
[1:21:52] early in the ephesian age paul was his
[1:21:54] warning for i'm jealous over you with
[1:21:57] godly jealousy for i've espoused you to
[1:21:59] one husband that i may present you as a
[1:22:01] chaste version to christ but i fear lest
[1:22:03] by any means as the serpent beguiled he
[1:22:05] through his subtlety so your mind should
[1:22:07] be corrupted from the simplicity that is
[1:22:09] in christ
[1:22:10] so way back there in the early church
[1:22:13] the false vine got to intertwine itself
[1:22:15] around the true vine and we found the
[1:22:18] deeds of the nicolaitans
[1:22:20] and they got the people to obey them
[1:22:22] until the time came that their way of
[1:22:24] worship no longer resembled the early
[1:22:26] days after pentecost
[1:22:29] and so satan attacks just like he did
[1:22:31] eve and he just changes one little thing
[1:22:32] here and one little thing there and he
[1:22:34] tries to get people to to move out from
[1:22:36] behind the protection of the word it
[1:22:38] seems so innocent at first but what it
[1:22:40] is is an opportunity for the wolves to
[1:22:42] come in
[1:22:43] an opportunity and soon that the deeds
[1:22:45] of these people become the doctrines and
[1:22:47] before long the church has lost their
[1:22:49] first love and cold formal worship
[1:22:52] begins to move into the services and
[1:22:54] experience is now traded for head
[1:22:56] knowledge
[1:22:57] and the problem with trading that other
[1:22:59] than the fact that it's unscriptural
[1:23:01] that's enough of a problem
[1:23:03] but the problem with it is when it's
[1:23:04] based off a head knowledge you begin to
[1:23:06] accept things that you wouldn't have
[1:23:08] originally accepted because there's no
[1:23:10] leadership of the holy ghost in your
[1:23:11] life
[1:23:12] so if somebody can make it sound pretty
[1:23:14] and make it sound right and sound
[1:23:15] reasonable you'll begin to drift in that
[1:23:17] direction
[1:23:19] and so what happens is the church begins
[1:23:20] to rely on men to provide them with what
[1:23:23] they need
[1:23:24] instead of the holy spirit and you've
[1:23:26] created a hierarchy of nicolaitanism
[1:23:29] men become leaders instead of the holy
[1:23:31] ghost and now the divide between the
[1:23:34] truth and what you are being fed on
[1:23:36] begins to grow more
[1:23:38] and more apart
[1:23:40] that's why you find so many that hate
[1:23:42] moving of the spirit because with the
[1:23:44] moving of the spirit they'll be set free
[1:23:45] from that spirit of bondage that they're
[1:23:47] sitting under so behind the guise of i
[1:23:50] want to protect my people
[1:23:52] they keep them from meetings where
[1:23:53] there's the holy ghost or they keep them
[1:23:55] from hearing other ministers and you
[1:23:57] don't need to listen to this and you
[1:23:58] don't need to listen to that and the
[1:24:00] whole time what it is is unlike paul
[1:24:03] they don't desire to espouse the people
[1:24:05] to christ they desire to espouse those
[1:24:07] people to themselves
[1:24:09] and so they build walls and they build
[1:24:11] kingdoms
[1:24:12] until it no longer even resembles what
[1:24:14] god started in the upper room it no
[1:24:17] longer resembles the truth that was
[1:24:18] revealed in this day
[1:24:21] you go and there's there's no message
[1:24:23] there and so once again back to
[1:24:26] the ephesian age as this began to happen
[1:24:28] and they began to be drawn away from the
[1:24:29] original
[1:24:30] just like in the garden satan thinks
[1:24:32] i made her fall
[1:24:34] i got her again
[1:24:37] she's fallen again she stepped out from
[1:24:39] behind the protection of the word she
[1:24:40] began to debate
[1:24:42] and satan thinks this one is falling
[1:24:44] just like eve but let me remind you and
[1:24:46] i'm going to keep reminding you that
[1:24:47] amen had already said i'm going to have
[1:24:50] a bride that amen had already said i'm
[1:24:52] going to restore but it looks like she's
[1:24:55] fallen too and we we've passed down
[1:24:57] through the fourth age and now when it
[1:24:58] seems so dark and there isn't anything
[1:25:00] left it seems like from the original
[1:25:02] tree that was planted there on the day
[1:25:04] of pentecost and yet that tree has been
[1:25:06] eaten down and the caterpillar and the
[1:25:08] locust has eaten it down to nothing but
[1:25:10] there's a scripture laying there that
[1:25:11] says i will restore i will restore
[1:25:14] brother brown says but what he was god's
[1:25:16] perfect prophet tree the example tree
[1:25:18] the bridegroom tree amen glory going to
[1:25:21] say something directly if he's the
[1:25:22] bridegroom tree do you believe it from
[1:25:24] the garden of eden then the bridegroom
[1:25:26] tree without the female don't bear fruit
[1:25:29] so he's got to have a bride tree she has
[1:25:31] got to be born of the same material the
[1:25:33] word made flesh in the tree hope you get
[1:25:36] it it's the same life in the female tree
[1:25:38] the bridegroom as it is in the bride the
[1:25:41] works that i do shall you do also is
[1:25:44] that right and he begins to restore
[1:25:47] the broad tree back to where listen we
[1:25:49] look around all the time and say the
[1:25:51] world's evil the world's evil the tree
[1:25:53] of knowledge of good and evil has
[1:25:54] reached its height and brother branham
[1:25:56] says we fail all the time to see how
[1:25:58] powerful the church is getting the world
[1:26:01] is evil the world is evil but look at
[1:26:03] the church on this side if that tree has
[1:26:05] reached its height and it's reached full
[1:26:07] maturity there must be a people on earth
[1:26:10] who is reaching the height of their
[1:26:11] power that is reaching full maturity the
[1:26:14] bride tree restored once again in this
[1:26:17] day
[1:26:21] and luther breaks away from the false
[1:26:23] line and preaches justification
[1:26:26] and wesley breaks away
[1:26:28] preaches sanctification the tree being
[1:26:30] restored and yet there's still claims on
[1:26:32] the tree
[1:26:33] satan still had claims over the church
[1:26:36] there were still false baptisms there
[1:26:38] were still teachings of false godheads
[1:26:41] the tree wasn't exactly producing the
[1:26:42] fruits that the groom tree had produced
[1:26:47] this was not yet bone of his bone and
[1:26:50] flesh of his flesh although there were
[1:26:51] glimpses of it
[1:26:53] this was not the ministry of christ
[1:26:55] being repeated
[1:26:56] so what must this tree produce in this
[1:26:58] day
[1:26:59] what must the final say in the final
[1:27:02] voice look like in this day
[1:27:04] he said there's got to come in this last
[1:27:06] day a restoration of the church a bride
[1:27:08] tree that was eat down back yonder by
[1:27:09] canker worms and palmer worms all kinds
[1:27:12] of insects that eat all the brotherly
[1:27:14] love and the fruits away from it there's
[1:27:16] got to come a church again whose
[1:27:18] barriers will be broken the holy ghost
[1:27:19] will have the right of way among the
[1:27:21] people when you do you'll see the same
[1:27:23] signs and wonders that happened back
[1:27:25] there in them days amen thus what the
[1:27:28] church was at pentecost is the standard
[1:27:32] that is the pattern there is no other
[1:27:34] pattern no matter what the scholars say
[1:27:37] god has not changed that pattern what
[1:27:40] god did at pentecost he has to keep on
[1:27:42] doing until the church ages close
[1:27:49] he said there is no other pattern
[1:27:52] there is no other pattern that is what
[1:27:54] we are to pattern after so so go ahead
[1:27:57] and call me pentecostal i will wear that
[1:27:59] like a badge of honor
[1:28:01] because brother branham says that's the
[1:28:02] pattern that's who we're supposed to
[1:28:04] match just like the first stage the
[1:28:07] first church the upper room that's what
[1:28:09] i'm patterning after because that's what
[1:28:11] we're supposed to pattern after
[1:28:14] and so down through the ages there were
[1:28:16] glimpses but there had to be more
[1:28:19] than the azusa street revival and a
[1:28:21] restoration of the gifts
[1:28:23] make no mistake about it it was a
[1:28:24] restoration and it was a move of god
[1:28:28] was it the original grain again no we
[1:28:30] know that
[1:28:31] we know that it was it was the life
[1:28:33] moving through
[1:28:34] but also when we point back to that move
[1:28:37] and act as if it was nothing
[1:28:39] and act as if it's unneeded i'm a simple
[1:28:42] person so i look at it and i tend to
[1:28:44] believe that if god thought it needed to
[1:28:45] be restored
[1:28:48] then he must have thought we needed it
[1:28:51] otherwise why restore it
[1:28:54] why were those things put back in the
[1:28:55] church
[1:28:57] but brother tim has a saying that he
[1:28:59] says that he got from somebody it's not
[1:29:01] original
[1:29:02] to him and he says so but he says
[1:29:04] god started the church the way he wanted
[1:29:06] it
[1:29:07] and now he wants the church the way he
[1:29:09] started it
[1:29:11] he started the church the way he wanted
[1:29:13] it and now he wants the church the way
[1:29:16] he started it
[1:29:19] and so god decides that it's important
[1:29:20] that i restore these he goes through a
[1:29:22] lot of trouble to restore these and i
[1:29:25] feel like that's very important that we
[1:29:26] don't just willingly hand over back to
[1:29:29] the devil something that god thought you
[1:29:31] needed something that god felt needed to
[1:29:33] be in the church something that he
[1:29:34] thought needs to be restored and we go i
[1:29:36] don't need that anymore god thought you
[1:29:39] did
[1:29:39] god thought you needed it he felt like
[1:29:41] he needed we needed the supernatural
[1:29:44] working in the church
[1:29:47] so he restores this and once again
[1:29:49] there's fruits of the spirit and the
[1:29:50] trees beginning to take shape
[1:29:52] but there must come something else
[1:29:55] something to turn us
[1:29:57] turn us to what
[1:29:59] and we're getting there
[1:30:01] brother brown says but what i said was
[1:30:03] that because of the unchanging god with
[1:30:05] unchanging ways we can go back to the
[1:30:07] beginning and see the first and perfect
[1:30:09] act of god and then judge by that
[1:30:11] standard that is how it's done the true
[1:30:14] church will always try to be like the
[1:30:16] original that pentecost the true church
[1:30:18] of today will try to approximate that
[1:30:21] early first one
[1:30:24] and just like in every other instance
[1:30:27] the amen had already spoken
[1:30:29] laying right there in the scripture was
[1:30:31] malachi 4 all along
[1:30:33] already ahead of anything that the devil
[1:30:35] can do already laying there behold i
[1:30:38] send to you elijah the prophet before
[1:30:40] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:30:42] of the lord and he will turn the hearts
[1:30:45] back to the faith of the fathers turned
[1:30:48] back to something turned back to the
[1:30:50] original and then that message comes
[1:30:52] forth in power with a restored word with
[1:30:55] the restored position
[1:30:59] who are we tonight church
[1:31:01] you are the restored bride of jesus
[1:31:04] christ restored back to where you were
[1:31:07] supposed to be in the beginning restored
[1:31:10] back with full authority restored back
[1:31:12] with the ability to speak the word and
[1:31:14] put the word on your lips you are the
[1:31:16] restored manifestation of the spoken
[1:31:19] word of god sitting here in elkton
[1:31:21] virginia tonight that's something worth
[1:31:23] shouting about that's something worth
[1:31:25] praising the lord about that he wasn't
[1:31:27] gonna let the devil win but he had the
[1:31:30] final say
[1:31:31] he had already spoken and because of
[1:31:34] that here we are victorious
[1:31:37] overcomers
[1:31:39] he was determined i will have a bride
[1:31:43] and here we are
[1:31:44] we're standing on our feet we're
[1:31:46] overcoming the enemy we're not some
[1:31:49] weakling we're not some layout of sin
[1:31:52] but we're on fire we love the lord we're
[1:31:54] pressing the battle we're overcoming
[1:31:57] that's who you are
[1:31:59] that's who you are
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:06] hallelujah
[1:32:11] thank you jesus
[1:32:16] what is it
[1:32:18] a restored word
[1:32:20] brought restored power called forth a
[1:32:22] restored bride
[1:32:24] a restored bride he says and now
[1:32:26] remember you christians were his
[1:32:28] thoughts before there was a world
[1:32:31] you are the manifestation of his
[1:32:34] thinking
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:37] and what was it that he did when he was
[1:32:38] here on earth he went about tearing down
[1:32:40] satan's kingdom he went about overcoming
[1:32:43] he showed that the grave didn't have
[1:32:45] victory he showed that that sickness
[1:32:47] didn't have to be feared and just as the
[1:32:49] groom did those things when he was
[1:32:51] walking on the earth now there is a
[1:32:53] bride doing those things
[1:32:55] there is a bride look you say nothing
[1:32:57] can stand before jesus i say nothing can
[1:32:59] stand before you
[1:33:00] nothing can stand before you when you
[1:33:02] walk in faith nothing's going to
[1:33:04] overcome you because not only did he
[1:33:07] have and he is the final say
[1:33:10] you are the final say he said you are
[1:33:13] the final voice to the final age you get
[1:33:16] to speak last you get to say the final
[1:33:19] words to this age i say devil get out of

[1:33:28] the authority to say that i've been

[1:33:40] the name of jesus christ rise up and
[1:33:43] walk i don't got a lot to give you but i
[1:33:45] can tell you tonight you've been
[1:33:47] restored back to authority to power and

[1:34:05] [Applause]
[1:34:11] i'm gonna try to start bringing this
[1:34:12] down
[1:34:15] satan thought that the church was
[1:34:16] defeated once again have won
[1:34:19] false doctrines false baptisms
[1:34:22] but the amen had already spoken
[1:34:24] he had a message prepared that was that
[1:34:26] would produce the people in this last
[1:34:28] day
[1:34:29] the message was the final say on all the
[1:34:31] mysteries
[1:34:32] the seals water baptism godhead no
[1:34:35] eternal hell hell all the loose ends
[1:34:38] wrapped up
[1:34:39] listen luther couldn't have the final
[1:34:41] say
[1:34:42] there were things wrong
[1:34:44] wesley couldn't have the final say there
[1:34:46] were still claims on wesley pentecost
[1:34:48] couldn't have the final say there was
[1:34:50] too many claims on them but in this day
[1:34:54] in this day every claim was stripped
[1:34:57] away the seals were torn off everything
[1:34:59] was brought back in order according to
[1:35:01] the word the seals everything every
[1:35:03] claim brother brandon would say that
[1:35:05] every claim he ever had was stripped
[1:35:06] that day on calvary so even if you go
[1:35:09] back there to the beginning there was no
[1:35:11] claim on your life it was man that had
[1:35:13] allowed those claims to come back in it
[1:35:15] was accepting the doctrines of man and
[1:35:17] false teachings that put those claims
[1:35:19] back on the church but in this day he
[1:35:21] came in the evening time it shall be
[1:35:24] light i'm so thankful for the evening
[1:35:26] light today he came and stripped it all
[1:35:29] off and he restored you back to where
[1:35:31] you are on speaking terms you have
[1:35:33] authority you have power that's where
[1:35:35] you stand at tonight
[1:35:39] it wasn't until this day that the final
[1:35:41] say could even be spoken
[1:35:44] it wasn't until this day that one could
[1:35:46] say
[1:35:47] you are the final voice
[1:35:50] that could've never been said before
[1:35:53] you
[1:35:55] you
[1:35:57] i feel like so many of us
[1:36:00] expect fulfillment
[1:36:02] and so we look
[1:36:04] for fulfillment
[1:36:06] but the problem is we're not ready to be
[1:36:08] the fulfillment
[1:36:11] we're looking oh it's when's it gonna be
[1:36:12] fulfilled when you get up and fulfill it
[1:36:16] when you realize it's me that's gonna do
[1:36:18] it

[1:36:51] emotion that's exactly well that's why

[1:39:55] i'm trying
[1:39:58] there is a bride here
[1:40:00] there is a spoken word bride
[1:40:03] and there's many that's claiming they
[1:40:04] are that bride
[1:40:06] it ain't for me to say whether you are
[1:40:08] ain't
[1:40:09] but what i can do is look at the vision
[1:40:12] i can look at the word
[1:40:14] i can see what the bride's supposed to
[1:40:16] be
[1:40:17] and then i might go hmm
[1:40:24] i'm just saying
[1:40:30] i mean
[1:40:38] tell you something
[1:40:39] there ain't no honesty like self-honesty
[1:40:44] when's the last time you was honest with
[1:40:45] yourself
[1:40:50] when's the last time you dug real deep
[1:40:52] about those things that's been hindering
[1:40:53] you
[1:40:55] real deep
[1:40:57] you saying i ain't but no i ain't saying
[1:40:58] that i'm saying bride deal with things
[1:41:00] that when they see them
[1:41:02] people with the holy ghost when they get
[1:41:04] convicted they don't blame other people
[1:41:07] they don't get mad at everybody else for
[1:41:08] their shortcomings
[1:41:10] they're willing to look at themselves
[1:41:11] and go i
[1:41:13] need to deal with this
[1:41:17] i
[1:41:18] need to deal with this
[1:41:20] but you get in a lukewarm condition real
[1:41:22] quick and let something go against you
[1:41:23] it's everybody's fault
[1:41:27] it's everybody's fault
[1:41:29] but yours
[1:41:32] i don't know i'm gonna move on
[1:41:40] how's the bride gonna conduct herself
[1:41:43] make sure we line up with that word
[1:41:45] listen the visions already happen you
[1:41:46] can't change the vision you gotta line
[1:41:48] up to the vision
[1:41:49] visions already happen
[1:41:51] we gotta step in line with that vision
[1:41:53] you can't be a part of that group that
[1:41:54] is the final voice to the final age and
[1:41:57] not be matching it word for word
[1:41:59] you can't be speaking things contrary to
[1:42:01] the word and be part of that final voice
[1:42:03] if it does something different from the
[1:42:05] groom brother brown would say
[1:42:07] it isn't the bride
[1:42:09] if your attitude is it's us for no more
[1:42:12] you ain't the final voice if your
[1:42:14] attitude is to put others out because
[1:42:16] they don't agree with you you're not the
[1:42:17] final voice matter of fact brother
[1:42:19] brannon would say something pretty harsh
[1:42:21] he said now isn't that just like the
[1:42:22] nicolaitans we have with us today
[1:42:25] they curse everyone that won't go their
[1:42:27] way
[1:42:29] when all you know is condemning others
[1:42:31] it just shows that you've never
[1:42:32] experienced the grace of god for
[1:42:33] yourself
[1:42:36] there's no you don't know what grace is
[1:42:38] because you've never experienced it so
[1:42:40] you want to point at everybody else's
[1:42:41] shortcomings and failures
[1:42:44] listen this is a message of grace
[1:42:46] that's what this mess this message came
[1:42:48] crying grace grace
[1:42:50] and we throwing stones at everybody and
[1:42:52] try listen noah's message was a message
[1:42:54] of grace we get things so twisted it's a
[1:42:56] message of judgment it's this no no no
[1:42:59] it warns you of the judgment that's
[1:43:01] coming and so therefore it's grace it's
[1:43:04] saying you don't got to go through that
[1:43:06] you don't got to be a part of that and
[1:43:08] here's how you avoid it get in the ark
[1:43:10] get in the boat run to jesus the door is
[1:43:13] open tonight get on board run to it you
[1:43:16] can be safe your family can be saved the
[1:43:18] door's still open get on board that's
[1:43:21] the message
[1:43:23] that's the message it's grace to you
[1:43:26] tonight it's grace to you tonight
[1:43:30] [Applause]
[1:43:35] if you're preaching mercy is over
[1:43:37] you're not the final voice
[1:43:41] if you're preaching division you're not
[1:43:43] the final voice
[1:43:45] the final voice is getting as many
[1:43:47] people in the art as they possibly can
[1:43:51] you know the final voice to the jewish
[1:43:52] dispensation was jesus
[1:43:56] and in that moment the final voice being
[1:43:58] crucified said father
[1:44:01] forgive them
[1:44:04] you trying to send everybody to hell and
[1:44:06] say they ain't going the rapture you
[1:44:07] ain't part
[1:44:08] of the final voice
[1:44:11] if your life is speaking judgment upon
[1:44:12] your brother pointing out their flaws
[1:44:15] you know some people really really hate
[1:44:17] and i don't understand this
[1:44:19] to see the success of others
[1:44:22] have you ever had those conversations
[1:44:24] maybe you hadn't i know i saw a lot of
[1:44:25] y'all come in with your halos
[1:44:30] but have you ever had those
[1:44:31] conversations where people are like oh
[1:44:33] yeah you know he's a good brother but i
[1:44:34] mean you know they just don't really
[1:44:36] know him like i do
[1:44:40] and they hate to see somebody be
[1:44:41] successful and hate to see others admire
[1:44:44] and say man that's a good brother i mean
[1:44:46] they're all right but i mean we get a
[1:44:48] minute i got i can tell you some stuff
[1:44:51] and nothing just yeah oh it's nothing
[1:44:52] bad just a few things
[1:44:54] you want to tear down other people's
[1:44:56] reputation and crucify them you are not
[1:44:59] the final voice
[1:45:02] you're not
[1:45:04] but if your life is crying lord forgive
[1:45:07] them bring them in jesus save from jesus
[1:45:10] lord i love that brother i want to see
[1:45:12] him saved i want to see him filled with
[1:45:14] the holy ghost and lord if it's not him
[1:45:16] per adventure it's me lord save me lord
[1:45:19] help me help me be honest with myself
[1:45:31] so much here
[1:45:33] i've run out of time
[1:45:35] the final voice
[1:45:37] the voice of the groom
[1:45:39] expressed
[1:45:41] through the bride
[1:45:43] he says this stump's growed from wesley
[1:45:45] from luther to wesley to pentecost and
[1:45:47] now is honing out those pentecostals and
[1:45:49] those that got the baptism of the holy
[1:45:50] ghost and shall come someday the
[1:45:52] headstone jesus christ in these last
[1:45:54] days and we'll have to have a ministry
[1:45:56] just exactly like his his whole spirit
[1:45:59] as it gets closer closer closer closer
[1:46:01] the negative becomes so positive that
[1:46:03] after a while the negative and the
[1:46:04] positive blends together church and
[1:46:06] christ to make one for where flesh of
[1:46:08] his flesh bone of his bone amen do you
[1:46:11] believe it it shall be light in the
[1:46:13] evening time we're here today he said
[1:46:15] i've been to the pyramids in egypt and
[1:46:17] them stones are laid in there so perfect
[1:46:19] you can take razor blade and hardly go
[1:46:20] between them they fit perfectly how they
[1:46:22] built it they don't know how and the
[1:46:24] sphinx and so forth but look right here
[1:46:27] where that headstone's supposed to fit
[1:46:28] it's honed if they ever could find the
[1:46:30] headstone it would fit so perfectly snug
[1:46:33] it would bind the whole thing together
[1:46:35] that's the bride of jesus christ when
[1:46:37] the headstone comes there'll be a church
[1:46:39] here on earth to receive it it'll have a
[1:46:41] ministry just exactly like his it'll
[1:46:46] just go right up in there bringing up
[1:46:47] the feet luther and all the rest of them
[1:46:51] for the resurrection
[1:46:53] someone is gonna play this part
[1:46:56] it's already been seen
[1:46:57] somebody's gonna line up to it
