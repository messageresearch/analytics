[32:11] you know to listen to one another sing
[32:13] and so

[32:26] know
[32:27] I don't know if you know it you just met
[32:28] some Oklahoma family so that's the way
[32:31] it is and and so we're just so thrilled
[32:34] that they're with us and looking forward
[32:38] to what the Lord would do today
[32:41] he's a great God
[32:42] and he's a god of variety and he knows
[32:45] exactly how to speak to our hearts and
[32:48] take subjects to where we've that we've
[32:51] just you know it just brings a new angle
[32:54] to certain things and so you guys did a
[32:57] really great job up here last night you

[1:16:17] this is a familiar passage of scripture
[1:16:19] let's look here it says in Jesus
[1:16:22] answering Seth unto them have faith in
[1:16:25] God
[1:16:26] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:16:29] shall say to this mountain be thou
[1:16:31] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[1:16:34] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:16:36] shall believe that those things which he
[1:16:38] said shall come to pass he shall have
[1:16:40] whatsoever he saith
[1:16:42] therefore I say unto you that whatsoever
[1:16:44] ye desire when ye pray believe that you
[1:16:47] shall receive them and you shall have
[1:16:50] them
[1:16:51] and when ye stand praying forgive if ye
[1:16:55] have ought against any that your father
[1:16:57] also which is in heaven May forgive you
[1:16:59] your trespasses but if you forgive not
[1:17:02] neither will your father which is in
[1:17:04] heaven forgive your trespasses I'd like
[1:17:07] to look at another place here in Hebrews
[1:17:10] 11 and 1. amen these are both familiar
[1:17:14] passages of scripture
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:18] Hallelujah it says now Faith is the
[1:17:20] substance of things hoped for
[1:17:23] the evidence of Things Not Seen for by
[1:17:26] it the elders obtained a good report I'd
[1:17:30] like to go on down to the sixth verse
[1:17:33] for without faith it is impossible to
[1:17:36] please him
[1:17:37] for he that cometh to God must first
[1:17:40] believe that he is
[1:17:41] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:17:45] diligently
[1:17:47] seek him

[1:34:20] his position he knew what he was because
[1:34:24] the scripture said what he was here
[1:34:26] every scripture tied in to prove that he
[1:34:29] was exactly what the scripture said he
[1:34:31] would be and he knew what he was
[1:34:34] therefore he relied on what God made him
[1:34:37] and if he did that then why can't we
[1:34:41] rely upon what God made us as believers
[1:34:46] no I'm preaching to somebody here he
[1:34:49] says these signs shall follow them that
[1:34:51] believe he had faith in what he was and
[1:34:54] if you're a Believer you have faith in
[1:34:57] what you are you're a Believer if you've
[1:35:00] got faith in God and the Bible says over
[1:35:03] here if our heart condemns us then we
[1:35:06] can't have faith but if our heart
[1:35:08] condemns us not then we have faith
[1:35:14] thank you

[1:35:20] Doo

[1:36:41] now the bride
[1:36:44] has never been more
[1:36:48] there has never been
[1:36:50] a greater identity
[1:36:52] to this bride
[1:36:54] and today
[1:36:56] that unsealed book
[1:36:59] has taken the cover off of you
[1:37:01] and God has openly declared Who You Are

[1:37:19] headship not of denomination
[1:37:22] not of not of another preacher

[1:37:27] sin
[1:37:28] another man's opinion you're living
[1:37:30] under the headship of the Living Word
[1:37:34] and you know what the prophet of God
[1:37:35] said you are
[1:37:37] amen he says you are all glorious he
[1:37:41] said the Bride of Jesus Christ is as
[1:37:43] pure as Jesus Christ is
[1:37:46] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:37:50] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:37:53] attributes her idea
[1:37:55] is found in him there is no fault found
[1:38:00] in hair
[1:38:03] she is his creation
[1:38:06] you know what that means
[1:38:08] let me if there's no condemnation then
[1:38:10] you can have total faith if the devil
[1:38:13] doesn't have any any chains on you
[1:38:15] doesn't have any amen holds on you then
[1:38:18] you can stand up and say I am who he
[1:38:21] says I am
[1:38:25] oh bless the Lord can you see me
[1:38:28] our identity has been swallowed up
[1:38:33] in the word
[1:38:38] Hallelujah
[1:38:40] we we lost our identity a long time ago
[1:38:43] we're his bride we've taken on his name
[1:38:46] we're we're not we're not living a name
[1:38:49] to ourself and him have his that's for
[1:38:52] the denominations but we are the Bride
[1:38:55] of Jesus Christ

[1:38:59] creation can you say Amen
[1:39:02] you know what that does that there is an
[1:39:04] eternal quality to the bride there is an
[1:39:07] eternal quality that no matter where you
[1:39:10] are and no matter what the circumstance
[1:39:12] is you are his and he is yours
[1:39:20] we'll praise the Lord
[1:39:22] the prophet says what he has
[1:39:25] she is manifesting on the Earth
[1:39:28] she has become
[1:39:30] a reflection
[1:39:32] of Jesus Christ
[1:39:37] your past is not even seen
[1:39:41] well praise the Lord
[1:39:44] because you're a new creation
[1:39:46] it's a word image it's a word creation
[1:39:48] the
[1:39:50] no longer that
[1:39:52] Hallelujah
[1:39:54] brother Branham says it like this
[1:39:56] he says from the beginning to the ending
[1:39:58] she is the work of her Lord and all his
[1:40:01] works are perfect in fact in her is
[1:40:04] summed up and manifested the Eternal
[1:40:06] wisdom and purpose of God how can one
[1:40:08] fathom it how can one understand it
[1:40:10] though we cannot do it we can accept it
[1:40:14] by faith for God has spoken it
[1:40:18] can I hear a great big gay man
[1:40:22] and you're never going to have faith as
[1:40:24] long as you're identifying with your
[1:40:25] situation
[1:40:27] you've got to identify
[1:40:32] and you are word of his word
[1:40:35] oh come on now
[1:40:37] the glory of the Lord God sees God sees
[1:40:41] virtue in you God loves you even when
[1:40:44] you're in a when you're having a bad
[1:40:46] hair day amen even when everything is
[1:40:49] going wrong even when you feel like you
[1:40:51] don't have faith even when you feel like
[1:40:53] a man you're like Sarah and you're just
[1:40:56] questioning everything you just take
[1:40:58] yourself right back to that word and say
[1:41:01] I am not moving from that word God has
[1:41:04] spoken it and I believe it it don't
[1:41:07] matter what I feel it don't matter what
[1:41:09] I see it don't matter what the situation
[1:41:11] looks around me my children are going to
[1:41:13] be saved God is going to bring Victory I
[1:41:16] know it I know it I know it
[1:41:22] can you see man
[1:41:26] who identifying
[1:41:28] you are identifying yourself
[1:41:31] in him
[1:41:35] he's all Victorious therefore you're all
[1:41:37] Victorious
[1:41:39] he's all glorious there you're for
[1:41:41] therefore you're all glorious can you
[1:41:42] say man
[1:41:44] now
[1:41:46] I want to bring this in before I get to
[1:41:48] my get to my thought here
[1:41:51] because this challenge of Faith we've
[1:41:53] got to lose the identity
[1:41:58] of this baggage right here
[1:42:01] and we've got to accept that identity
[1:42:04] of him did you know that before Isaac
[1:42:07] could even come
[1:42:08] Sarah had to have a name change
[1:42:12] Hallelujah Abraham had to have a name
[1:42:15] change
[1:42:16] and God gave you a name change
[1:42:20] oh you're not a sinner you're a son of
[1:42:23] God
[1:42:25] I have a hard time saying I'm a sinner
[1:42:27] saved by grace I was a sinner been saved
[1:42:31] by grace now I am the Bride of Jesus
[1:42:33] Christ you can't be a sinner in the
[1:42:35] bride at the same time
[1:42:39] you can't be saved and lost at the same
[1:42:41] time
[1:42:43] you can't come on Church remember we're
[1:42:46] coming and setting in the pews and we're
[1:42:48] trying to regulate God by how we feel
[1:42:50] but how we see by their mistakes and by
[1:42:53] our our triumphs I want to say it's time
[1:42:55] for us to come and take him at his word
[1:42:58] his word is unfailing his word is our
[1:43:02] Victory his word will never fail can you
[1:43:06] say Amen therefore I stand upon God's
[1:43:09] word and I refuse to Bow I refuse to be
[1:43:13] in I refuse to give up
[1:43:17] God's anointed me to withstand the devil
[1:43:22] in this day I am the body of Jesus
[1:43:26] Christ here on the Earth
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:34] and you say Amen
[1:43:37] brother Madam said knowing who he was
[1:43:40] without a shadow of a doubt he knew he
[1:43:42] was the son of God he knew it
[1:43:44] for the word
[1:43:46] identified it
[1:43:50] buddy
[1:43:52] aren't you glad for a prophet that has
[1:43:54] come this day
[1:43:56] how many is glad that you can identify
[1:43:57] with scripture for this day
[1:44:00] come on
[1:44:02] Malachi Ford
[1:44:04] Revelations 10 7. Revelations 10 8.
[1:44:08] can you say Amen
[1:44:09] he says the word of God identified who
[1:44:11] he was
[1:44:13] he says if I do not the works of my
[1:44:15] father then Believe Me Not
[1:44:16] if I do them if I don't do them Works
[1:44:18] don't believe me but if I do then
[1:44:21] believe the works for they are the
[1:44:23] manifested word promised oh if you could
[1:44:26] just wake up to that a minute you see
[1:44:28] the word itself identified him who he
[1:44:32] was he said who can condemn me of sin in
[1:44:35] other words who can show me that my life
[1:44:37] and my Works don't fulfill exactly what
[1:44:40] the Messiah should do nobody could say
[1:44:42] nothing for he was then he had Faith to
[1:44:46] believe then of whatsoever he said it
[1:44:48] could happen and then he turned around
[1:44:50] and he said the works that I do shall
[1:44:53] you also a little while the world go uh
[1:44:57] well the world seeth me no more yet you
[1:45:00] shall because I'll be with you even in
[1:45:04] you take no thought what you shall say
[1:45:06] for it's not you that speaks it's the
[1:45:09] father that dwelleth in you he's the one
[1:45:11] that does the speaking it's not me it's
[1:45:13] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[1:45:16] the works now the identification of a
[1:45:20] scripture Christian these words said
[1:45:23] Jesus these mine shall follow them that
[1:45:28] believe
[1:45:33] how can you call yourself a believer a
[1:45:36] people and deny those words
[1:45:38] how can you call yourself a Believer and
[1:45:40] deny any of this word
[1:45:41] you can't do it you're not a believer
[1:45:43] therefore the signs can't follow because
[1:45:45] you just accept what you want to believe
[1:45:47] and the rest of it what you don't
[1:45:49] believe it
[1:45:50] but you've got to take the whole thing
[1:45:52] and believe it and when you truly
[1:45:54] believe not make believe but really
[1:45:55] believe then those signs will follow
[1:45:56] them that belief oh compare a Christian
[1:45:59] today with those Christians long ago how
[1:46:01] does his disciples I walked in power of
[1:46:04] the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost to do
[1:46:06] it just a prisoner as I was preaching

[1:46:21] shouting

[1:46:33] you know what I'm doing
[1:46:35] I'm just I'm just giving you a little
[1:46:37] shot in the arm
[1:46:39] you know what because who you are is who
[1:46:41] you are and there ain't nothing a
[1:46:43] preacher can do about it there ain't
[1:46:45] nothing the devil can do about it

[1:46:49] who you are and to point you to the
[1:46:51] mirror of who you oh Hallelujah I'm glad

[1:47:21] you

[1:47:26] womb of a mother
[1:47:27] and when that one cell goes in there and
[1:47:30] another cell comes on top of that
[1:47:32] it's not one cell of a human and the
[1:47:33] next of a dog the next of a cat the next
[1:47:36] of something else it is absolutely
[1:47:38] straightly human being
[1:47:40] and when a man is born of the spirit of
[1:47:42] God
[1:47:44] punch your neighbor and say this is
[1:47:45] fixing to get good
[1:47:47] when a man is born of the spirit of God
[1:47:49] he don't inject anything into his life

[1:47:55] Vindicated for that hour he takes the
[1:47:58] full word of God he don't put no Creeds

[1:56:33] and as many
[1:56:35] were ordained

[1:56:56] now
[1:56:58] you say
[1:56:59] you see how this matters
[1:57:02] you have got to think right
[1:57:06] and the only way you can think right
[1:57:09] is to look in the scripture and see who
[1:57:12] you are
[1:57:13] come on now
[1:57:17] but you see you were in God from all
[1:57:19] time
[1:57:21] he knew your name
[1:57:23] he knew the color of your hair
[1:57:26] he knew that you two boys were going to
[1:57:28] be the mighty Angel and the Earthly
[1:57:30] Angel last night
[1:57:31] God already seen it oh come on now
[1:57:35] God knew God knew that Ron Spencer he
[1:57:40] was going to be sitting there as a great
[1:57:42] General fighting that that devil of his
[1:57:44] life
[1:57:45] he knew it at the beginning he already
[1:57:48] knew it
[1:57:49] that's the reason why he placed that
[1:57:51] germ seed of God on the inside
[1:57:53] that ain't strong will of Ronald Dean
[1:57:56] Spencer that's the Eternal Jean seed of
[1:57:59] God
[1:58:04] you girls at the enemies pulling on you
[1:58:06] Amen in school and the enemy just keeps
[1:58:09] on and then and keeps trying to pull you
[1:58:11] in getting you to wear makeup and trying
[1:58:13] to get you to cut your hair and keep
[1:58:15] trying amen and all of a sudden there's
[1:58:17] something on the inside that rises up it
[1:58:20] doesn't mean that you're not fighting a
[1:58:22] war it doesn't mean you're not fighting
[1:58:24] a battle it don't mean the Ronald Dean
[1:58:26] Spencer it's not fighting a battle but
[1:58:29] he is a Son of God and you're a daughter
[1:58:31] of God and you have been equipped to
[1:58:34] destroy the enemy
[1:58:38] foreign
[1:58:43] get your swords out
[1:58:45] [Applause]
[1:58:53] and when it comes to the end
[1:58:56] you know it'll be the bride it'll be the
[1:58:58] spirit and the bride that talks to the
[1:58:59] whosoevers
[1:59:01] Revelations 22 and 17.
[1:59:05] and the spirit
[1:59:06] and the bride
[1:59:08] say somebody say the spirit and the
[1:59:10] bride
[1:59:12] say
[1:59:14] they've been given a voice come
[1:59:16] let him that heareth say come and let
[1:59:19] him that is The Thirst come whosoever
[1:59:21] will let him take
[1:59:23] of the Water of Life freely
[1:59:26] brother Branham says now watch that word
[1:59:29] what's the power now watch here he says
[1:59:32] how did God make the Earth he spoke it
[1:59:35] amen you see it he's speaking the world
[1:59:38] come into existence and this world this
[1:59:40] morning is the spoken word of God and he
[1:59:43] believed his own word
[1:59:44] here it is watch it that is what brother
[1:59:47] random is saying here it is watch it and
[1:59:50] if God and your and offspring of him and
[1:59:54] God is in you he'll believe his own word
[1:59:57] though it can't be seen though it can't
[1:59:59] be felt taste or anything he'll believe
[2:00:02] it see what I mean for God in you
[2:00:06] believes his own word is that right then
[2:00:08] you don't look at things you see you
[2:00:10] look at things that God has said oh
[2:00:14] praise the Lord I I I I think this
[2:00:17] morning we need to be thankful for the
[2:00:19] word of God
[2:00:21] we need to be thankful thankful for that
[2:00:23] word brother random says I wonder if we
[2:00:24] are sufficiently impressed with the word
[2:00:26] in our midst
[2:00:28] how do we pray we pray in Jesus name
[2:00:30] don't we every prayer is in his name or
[2:00:32] there isn't any answer amen and he goes
[2:00:36] on down he says there's only one way to
[2:00:37] know his will and that is by the word of
[2:00:39] God now then this word he has left
[2:00:42] behind on the printer's page is part of
[2:00:45] him when you accept it by faith into a
[2:00:48] spirit filled light he goes on down he
[2:00:51] says there it is he is Spirit he is life
[2:00:53] that is exactly what the word is that is
[2:00:56] exactly what Jesus is he is the word so
[2:00:59] when a spirit born
[2:01:02] Spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[2:01:05] word into his heart and places it upon
[2:01:08] his lips it is the same as deity
[2:01:12] speaking
[2:01:15] [Applause]
[2:01:18] well you're not as little and
[2:01:19] insignificant as you thought you were
[2:01:21] when you can stand and what did he say
[2:01:24] ever
[2:01:25] Mountain has to go
[2:01:30] Satan cannot stand
[2:01:32] before
[2:01:34] that man
[2:01:36] what is causing this great confidence
[2:01:40] when she sees herself
[2:01:43] scripture
[2:01:47] am I taking too much time this morning
[2:01:50] seeing herself in Scripture
[2:01:52] this is why it was greatly important
[2:01:55] the mighty angel
[2:01:57] the Earthly angel
[2:02:00] and then the elect to take that book
[2:02:05] can you say man
[2:02:07] he didn't say to go to the angel for a
[2:02:08] blessing he said go to the angel
[2:02:11] and ask for he didn't he didn't even say
[2:02:13] ask for the book he says demand the book
[2:02:17] give me the book
[2:02:19] that is open in your hand
[2:02:22] can you say Amen
[2:02:24] Luke 17 30 as it was in the days of
[2:02:27] Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of

[2:02:32] Joel or Malachi 4 I will turn the hearts
[2:02:37] of the children back to the fathers has
[2:02:38] that been fulfilled
[2:02:40] what about Joel too I will restore the
[2:02:43] years of the Palmer worm the caterpillar
[2:02:45] the Locust and the canker worm has that
[2:02:47] been fulfilled
[2:02:49] well has it been fulfilled
[2:02:52] he's restored us
[2:02:55] Revelations 10 1 the mighty angel with
[2:02:58] an open book has that been fulfilled
[2:03:00] Revelations 10 9. take the Angels go to
[2:03:03] the angel and take the book hey is that
[2:03:05] being fulfilled
[2:03:06] so what can we say we can identify
[2:03:10] ourselves with that book
[2:03:15] Hallelujah
[2:03:17] now
[2:03:19] what does it do
[2:03:21] it does not make us stuffed shirts
[2:03:25] it is equipping us
[2:03:28] when we can see scripture being
[2:03:30] fulfilled today
[2:03:33] and when we cannot just see scripture of
[2:03:36] 60 years ago but we can identify
[2:03:38] ourselves in scripture today you know
[2:03:41] what that does that equips us

[2:05:49] was so anointed
[2:05:52] that when he walked up to Pharaoh on

[2:08:31] can you say man
[2:08:34] now
[2:08:36] what is this to be
[2:08:40] I think as I
[2:08:43] my final thought here
[2:08:46] is the church needed
[2:08:49] something to fight with
[2:08:53] we needed something to fight with
[2:08:55] you you remember you remember there in
[2:08:58] the Old Testament
[2:09:00] that the Philistines
[2:09:02] had come in
[2:09:03] and taken all the swords
[2:09:06] and all the plow or all of the Spears
[2:09:09] from the from the Israelites
[2:09:13] there there was there there was no one
[2:09:15] matter of fact there was no sword found
[2:09:18] in the Kingdom except with Jonathan and
[2:09:21] Saul
[2:09:23] there was no blacksmiths the Philistines
[2:09:27] were holding Israel captive in their own
[2:09:31] land
[2:09:36] and the preacher he was backslid
[2:09:39] Saul was backslid he didn't know how to
[2:09:41] use a sword
[2:09:43] well praise the lord it's in the Bible
[2:09:47] but someone got courage
[2:09:50] someone got some courage
[2:09:53] and that's all I already told him the
[2:09:55] one the other one with the sword had
[2:09:56] told Jonathan he's now you guys you guys
[2:09:58] stay you know let's just stay here
[2:10:00] instead
[2:10:01] and then the Bible says that Jonathan
[2:10:03] and his armor Bearer he looked out there
[2:10:05] and he saw a bunch of Philistines over
[2:10:07] there and he looked over at his armor
[2:10:09] Bearer and he says do you think we can
[2:10:10] handle these guys
[2:10:12] and the armor Bearer says well
[2:10:14] you're the only one with a sword but I'm
[2:10:16] here to tell you
[2:10:17] mom where I'm ready to go
[2:10:19] I'm ready to go he says to just be me
[2:10:21] and you he goes let's let's do it
[2:10:24] Hallelujah now the other they're they're
[2:10:26] over there singing the blues or whatever
[2:10:28] they're doing in their Church
[2:10:30] amen and and they they were all having
[2:10:33] their they were in their morgue you know
[2:10:35] but old Saul old Saul and Jonathan or
[2:10:38] Jonathan and and his armor Bearer he
[2:10:41] took off up there amen and he looked
[2:10:44] over he said boy there's a bunch of them
[2:10:46] over there there's a bunch of them there
[2:10:48] and the armor Bearer says show enough is
[2:10:50] he says do you still think we can take
[2:10:52] it we got a sword we got a sword we've
[2:10:56] only got one but we got a sword I'll
[2:10:59] block what you slay Hallelujah and and
[2:11:03] the Bible says that the that the
[2:11:06] Philistines seen them and Came Upon them
[2:11:09] and they Slayer every one of them
[2:11:19] I'm glad for Bible History
[2:11:21] because the Bible says that Saul look
[2:11:23] around says what's going on down there
[2:11:26] so they're all looking through their
[2:11:27] binoculars and they're saying
[2:11:30] what
[2:11:32] there's this God that we there's there's
[2:11:35] this God that is
[2:11:37] slaying Philistines people are dead
[2:11:40] everywhere
[2:11:42] look around see who's missing
[2:11:44] Saul was missing
[2:11:46] and what did the Bible say they all took
[2:11:49] courage
[2:11:50] because one man
[2:11:53] had a sword oh can you say man now I I
[2:11:57] just want to put this right here in your
[2:11:59] mouth what is your sword
[2:12:03] the word is sharper than a two-edged
[2:12:07] sword
[2:12:08] come on Amen this this is what you're
[2:12:11] what what did the bible say that Jesus
[2:12:13] is going to slay all of his enemies with
[2:12:14] out of his mouth shall come forth a
[2:12:16] two-edged sword what did God say upon
[2:12:20] you they're in Isaiah 44 and 3. I will
[2:12:23] pour water upon him that is thirsty and
[2:12:25] floods upon the dry land and I will pour
[2:12:26] out my spirit upon thy seed and
[2:12:29] blessings upon thine Offspring Isaiah 59
[2:12:33] and 19. so they so shall they fear the
[2:12:37] name of the Lord from the West and his
[2:12:39] glory from the rising in the Sun and
[2:12:40] when the enemy shall come in like a
[2:12:42] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[2:12:44] up a standard against him and the
[2:12:46] Redeemer shall come to design unto them
[2:12:48] that turn from transgression and Jacob
[2:12:50] saith Lord as for me this is my Covenant
[2:12:53] with him my spirit is upon thee and my
[2:12:56] words which I have put in thy mouth
[2:12:59] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[2:13:02] out of the mouth of thy seed known out
[2:13:04] of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the
[2:13:06] Lord from henceforth and for forevermore
[2:13:09] that's your scripture
[2:13:12] [Applause]
[2:13:18] it ain't gonna be it ain't gonna be
[2:13:20] Jonathan with a sword
[2:13:23] it's not going to be a prophet with a
[2:13:25] sword
[2:13:26] it's not going to be brother Andrew and
[2:13:29] brother Josh with a sword you are going
[2:13:33] to have the sword
[2:13:41] brother Branham says
[2:13:44] and the word has never failed in the
[2:13:47] mouths of believing Christians
[2:13:51] in this last age it is here stronger and
[2:13:54] greater than ever in the true word
[2:13:56] bright oh little flock
[2:13:59] oh little minority

[2:14:17] here today
[2:14:18] Hallelujah now
[2:14:22] as the musicians
[2:14:25] get ready to come
[2:14:27] when brother Brandon was trying to
[2:14:31] figure out
[2:14:36] what the vision was and the seven angels
[2:14:38] and
[2:14:41] and he
[2:14:43] he goes up
[2:14:45] to the mountain and he's saying Lord
[2:14:47] does this mean my death
[2:14:48] does this mean
[2:14:50] he didn't he didn't understand what was
[2:14:52] going to happen
[2:14:55] and he goes up to the mountain and he
[2:14:56] had his hands up in the air
[2:15:00] and all of a sudden a sword hit him
[2:15:05] and he says that sword was just as real
[2:15:07] as anything
[2:15:08] he said he looked at it he was a little
[2:15:10] scared of it
[2:15:11] he said Miss Shining
[2:15:13] man this big old sword
[2:15:17] he said he was holding the sword in his
[2:15:19] hand
[2:15:20] he said I
[2:15:22] pulled it down and looked at it it was
[2:15:24] it was just a knife one day at my as I'm
[2:15:27] scared of a knife the metal thing like
[2:15:29] that and a like pot metal or something
[2:15:31] real sharp and narrow had a sheath
[2:15:33] around it here
[2:15:34] where the doulas used to keep from
[2:15:37] cutting one another's hands it had a
[2:15:39] pearl in the handle there and just fit
[2:15:42] my hand exactly
[2:15:43] I rub my face and I look back
[2:15:46] right on the same spot the other day I
[2:15:48] saw the little white dove come down
[2:15:49] tell you about that a little later on I
[2:15:51] was holding that in my hand I said
[2:15:53] that's strange now am I losing my mind

[2:16:11] standing there
