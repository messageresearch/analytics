[44:27] preliminaries but get right into the
[44:28] word but I do want to say how how
[44:31] thankful I am for the opportunity to be
[44:33] here again I I could stand up here all

[44:38] the Spencer family means to me and not
[44:41] just the Spencer family but Full Gospel
[44:44] Lighthouse what you mean to me and a lot
[44:46] of people know this I probably say it

[45:30] weekend we're looking forward to a good
[45:32] time in the Lord and we're just so
[45:34] thankful to be amongst friends again so
[45:36] God bless you if you don't mind I'm
[45:37] going to read from three places it may
[45:39] be a little lengthy but I I believe
[45:40] it'll help us set up what we're W to
[45:42] speak tonight I'm going to read Matthew
[45:44] 13:53 through 58 and then we're going to
[45:47] turn to Mark 10 after
[45:49] that says and it came to pass that when
[45:52] Jesus had finished these Parables he
[45:54] departed then and when he was coming to
[45:57] his own country he taught them in their
[45:58] synagogue in so much that they were
[46:01] astonished and said whence hath this man
[46:03] this wisdom and these Mighty works is
[46:06] not this the carpenter son is not his
[46:08] mother called Mary and his his Brethren
[46:11] James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and
[46:14] his sisters are they not all with us
[46:16] whence then hath this man all these
[46:18] things and they were offended in him but
[46:21] Jesus said unto them a prophet is not
[46:23] without honor save in his own country
[46:25] and in his own house and he did not many
[46:28] mighty works there because of their
[46:31] unbelief we're going to look over in
[46:33] Mark 10 and verse 46 Mark 10 and verse
[46:38] 46 we'll read down through verse
[46:43] 52 it says and they came to Jericho and
[46:46] as he went out of Jericho with his
[46:48] disciples and a great number of people
[46:50] blind barus the son of timus set by the
[46:53] highways side begging and when he heard
[46:55] that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began
[46:57] to cry out and say Jesus thou son of
[47:00] David have mercy on me and many charged
[47:03] him that he should hold his peace but he
[47:05] cried the more a great deal thou son of
[47:08] David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood
[47:12] Still how many would like him to stand
[47:14] still for your need tonight and Jesus
[47:17] Stood Still and commanded him to be
[47:19] called and they called the blind man
[47:21] saying unto him be of good Comfort rise
[47:24] he calleth thee and he casting away his
[47:27] garment Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus
[47:29] answered and said unto him What wilt
[47:31] thou that I should do unto thee the
[47:34] blind man said unto him Lord that I
[47:35] might receive my sight and Jesus said
[47:38] unto him go thy way thy faith ha made
[47:41] thee whole and immediately he received
[47:43] his sight and followed Jesus in the way
[47:47] if you would I'd like to turn to one
[47:48] more place Luke
[47:50] 23 Luke 23 and verse
[47:54] 39 thank you for your patience
[48:01] it says and one of the male factors
[48:03] which were hanged railed on him saying
[48:06] if thou be Christ save thyself and us
[48:09] but the other answering rebuked him
[48:11] saying dust thou not fear God seeing
[48:14] Thou Art in the same condemnation and we
[48:17] indeed justly for we receive the due
[48:19] reward of our Deeds but this man hath
[48:22] done nothing aiss and he said unto Jesus
[48:25] Lord remember me when thou comest and
[48:26] into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him
[48:29] verily I say unto thee today shalt thou
[48:32] be with me in Paradise can we pray
[48:35] together Heavenly Father Lord we're so
[48:37] grateful Lord for this opportunity Lord
[48:41] and and we are very keenly aware at this
[48:43] moment of your presence in this place
[48:45] and Lord we we fully believe that that
[48:47] you've given us a word to speak here
[48:49] tonight Lord so we're just going to step
[48:51] aside now Lord and allow you Lord to
[48:53] speak your word Lord I pray that not
[48:55] only will I be anointed Lord but every
[48:57] listener will be anointed Lord the
[48:59] hearer and the receiver of it tonight
[49:01] Lord that it can have its complete and
[49:03] full effect in our lives father we
[49:05] commit it all to your hands now and just
[49:07] ask you to speak father and have your
[49:09] way in Jesus name amen and amen may God
[49:12] bless you as as you take your
[49:14] seats I'd like to speak to you for a a
[49:17] bit tonight on the thought recognizing
[49:20] your opportunity in his presence
[49:23] recognizing your opportunity in his
[49:27] presence and and as we read here it it
[49:30] was three seemingly unrelated
[49:33] stories from three different books of
[49:35] the Bible but but the way these ties
[49:37] together tonight for the sake of of our
[49:40] message is that we saw three
[49:42] opportunities we saw three different
[49:44] opportunities there in Matthew we see
[49:46] them as we began reading he's in his
[49:48] hometown and we see them absolutely
[49:51] astounded by him not only in his
[49:53] teachings but you know the works and the
[49:56] way he was is teaching in the synagogue
[49:58] and yet one verse later they go from
[50:00] astounded to doubt one moment from this
[50:04] is amazing how can this be in the very
[50:06] next moment they're in doubt because
[50:08] they began to focus on why this couldn't
[50:10] be God they begin to focus on why this
[50:14] couldn't be and and why something could
[50:16] be wrong and I want to tell you even in
[50:18] a service if you want to figure out why
[50:20] it couldn't be God if you want to
[50:23] overlook how God's moving in a service
[50:25] and you want to find fault in a service
[50:28] or or or Reason away what's happening
[50:30] before your very eyes it's actually easy
[50:32] to do we can look at things and explain
[50:35] it away or or look at somebody's victory
[50:37] dance and say well I know how that
[50:38] person lives so so that couldn't be God
[50:42] so so so it's easy to explain away God
[50:44] if we're not careful and because they
[50:46] couldn't recognize who it was in their
[50:49] midst then they were unable to believe
[50:51] even though they heard and even though
[50:53] they saw what was happening we've moved
[50:56] M on into Mark and we we find a
[50:58] desperate blind man and we know him as
[51:00] as blind barus who recognizes his
[51:03] opportunity although he witnessed
[51:05] nothing although he had heard nothing
[51:08] and because he's able to believe even
[51:11] because his faith Rises we find a
[51:13] completely different outcome it's not
[51:15] the story of I couldn't heal him but
[51:18] because of his faith we find him healed
[51:20] and completely made whole and then
[51:22] finally in Luke we we come to the
[51:25] well-known story of the theves that are
[51:27] hanging on the cross next to Jesus both
[51:29] of them are are at the end of the line
[51:31] both at the end of their rope so to
[51:33] speak and and both of them wretched and
[51:35] miserable people and yet both of them
[51:38] brother Andrew with the exact same
[51:41] opportunity it was their opportunity in
[51:45] his presence now I want to go ahead and
[51:47] say this right here your opportunity in
[51:49] his presence may not be in an ideal
[51:52] situation this wasn't the ideal place to
[51:55] have this opportunity and yet it was
[51:57] their opportunity nonetheless it was
[52:00] their moment it was their time with the
[52:02] Savior it was their opportunity with the
[52:04] one with eternal life this was their
[52:06] chance this was their
[52:09] opportunity and one is conscious of his
[52:11] need and he recognized whose presence he
[52:14] is that he's in and because of that he
[52:17] dies and we finally goes to heaven
[52:19] because of that his life was just
[52:22] beginning but then we find another one
[52:24] who is unconscious of whose presence
[52:26] he's in and because he's unaware and he
[52:30] doesn't recognize his opportunity then
[52:33] he dies and go to
[52:35] hell notice your lack of recognition
[52:38] does not mean it wasn't your
[52:41] opportunity just because you leave a
[52:43] service and I didn't feel anything and I
[52:45] didn't this and I didn't doesn't mean he
[52:47] didn't walk past your Pew it doesn't
[52:50] mean your name wasn't called it doesn't
[52:52] mean it wasn't your opportunity but you
[52:54] have to recognize your opport unity in
[52:57] his presence and I just go ahead and
[52:58] tell you right now whether you recognize
[53:00] it or not tonight is an opportunity in
[53:04] his presence right now is a moment that
[53:07] you can have with the King tonight can
[53:09] be your time this is an opportunity in
[53:12] his
[53:15] presence we must be a people that
[53:18] recognize God in our midst and recognize
[53:20] our
[53:21] opportunities time after time you can go
[53:23] through it there's over a thousand
[53:24] quotes where brother BR talk about being
[53:27] uh aware being conscious and recognizing
[53:30] and so time after time he talks about
[53:32] recognizing his presence he he he talks
[53:35] about being aware of his presence and he
[53:37] would tell the people you've got to be
[53:39] conscious of
[53:41] God but see that's exactly what Satan
[53:44] doesn't want to happen he doesn't want
[53:46] you to be conscious of God he doesn't
[53:48] want you to recognize that whatever
[53:51] situation you're in today that God is
[53:54] there he wants you to feel like God
[53:56] isn't there God's A Million Miles Away
[53:59] or God has forgotten me and the prophet
[54:01] saying be God conscious he's here be God
[54:04] conscious he's in the trial he's right
[54:06] there with you and the reason the devil
[54:08] don't want you to know he's there is
[54:10] because when God's there so is Victory
[54:12] God is in your trial so Victory is in
[54:15] your trial healing is right there
[54:17] Deliverance is right there that that
[54:19] prodal coming home it's right there
[54:22] because God is here and we got to be God
[54:25] conscious
[54:27] God is always near and so Victory is
[54:30] always near
[54:31] amen and our battle today is to be God
[54:35] conscious in a world that has put him
[54:37] completely out of their
[54:39] thinking God conscious in a world that
[54:42] has put him completely away from their
[54:44] Consciousness they don't even
[54:46] acknowledge his
[54:47] existence much less his presence right
[54:50] now currently working
[54:52] amen and and I think it's obvious I
[54:55] don't have to explain this to you that
[54:56] we live in a an Ever increasingly
[54:59] anti-god
[55:00] Society Church it's not getting
[55:03] better I don't care who they
[55:06] elect it can only get worse it's not
[55:10] going to get better but that doesn't
[55:11] worry us that doesn't frighten us all
[55:13] that does is letting me know oh yep the
[55:15] prophet was right what I believe was
[55:17] right what he taught was the truth it's
[55:19] going to keep going down and down and
[55:21] down but guess what if that's true the
[55:23] other part of the prophecy is true as
[55:25] well we're going to keep going up and up
[55:27] and up and up it doesn't shake us that
[55:30] the world's falling apart he told us the
[55:32] world was falling apart he said it was
[55:34] going to fall apart but he said I'll
[55:36] have a bride I'll have a church without
[55:39] spot wrinkle that's who you are tonight
[55:42] everything's being fulfilled yep so is
[55:45] that I'll have a bride I'm looking at
[55:47] the
[55:48] Fulfillment too many times we say
[55:51] there's going to be there's going to be
[55:52] a bride there's going to be a bride
[55:54] that's wrong there is a bride
[55:57] God
[55:59] hallelujah recognize not only who he is
[56:01] but who you
[56:05] are it's an ever increasing anti-god
[56:08] Society you know when I graduated high
[56:10] school I'm about to age myself
[56:14] 1999
[56:16] 70% of Americans were church
[56:19] members 2020 50% are church
[56:24] members and of that 50% that are members
[56:28] 41% of those actually go to
[56:32] church there ain't many of us left and
[56:34] by us I just mean people going to church
[56:37] I'm counting the Catholics I'm counting
[56:39] everybody there ain't many of us left
[56:42] that's the only time I'm going to say us
[56:43] about them and us in the same
[56:47] sentence we ain't we ain't got many
[56:49] people you mean you wake up you don't
[56:51] know how many times I'd go through a
[56:52] drive-thru sometimes when I'm out
[56:54] preaching in a suit like this pull pull
[56:56] up to the drive-thru window to grab some
[56:58] breakfast or a coffee on the way to
[56:59] church and they'll go where you
[57:02] going they don't
[57:04] know you got to work on Sunday well kind
[57:07] of you know we're going to church oh
[57:10] Church okay church it's far from their
[57:14] thinking it's it's out of their
[57:15] Consciousness it's it's the world we
[57:18] live in has gone so far down and brother
[57:20] Bram says you know it used to be if a
[57:22] woman or a man said that they was a
[57:24] Christian people respected it
[57:27] he said but today they just like to see
[57:29] how much fun they can make out of it now
[57:30] this was 6070 years
[57:33] ago he says see irreverent group my why
[57:37] you know what what's the reason they're
[57:39] not conscious that that's the truth
[57:42] they're not conscious of
[57:45] God but I want to say that in the midst
[57:48] of the most unbelieving time in the
[57:50] midst of an unbelieving World somebody
[57:53] is going to recognize him in their midst
[57:55] some somebody's going to honor him when
[57:57] he moves through the building somebody's
[57:59] going to say that's my king I see him I
[58:02] know him I claim him I'm here to worship
[58:05] him I'm here to live for him somebody's
[58:08] going to lift up his name above all
[58:10] other names and be the final voice to
[58:13] the final
[58:14] age somebody's going to recognize him
[58:17] when he moves and declare there is a
[58:19] living God there is a savior There Is A
[58:21] Healer there is a deliverer and he is
[58:24] the same yesterday today and forever I
[58:27] want to be a part of that voice I want
[58:29] to be a part of the final voice crying
[58:32] out offering mercy and offering Grace
[58:34] and saying get in the
[58:36] ark but in order to do that we have to
[58:38] be in tune with his
[58:41] presence he's not just coming back for a
[58:43] group of people that acknowledge his
[58:48] existence he's not just coming back even
[58:51] forgive me for a group of people that
[58:53] acknowledge that that that Malachi 4 has
[58:55] been fulfilled
[58:57] that recognize that there's been a
[58:59] message in this day but this bride is
[59:01] going to be in tune with the presence of
[59:04] God with the moving of the spirit with
[59:07] God operating in our midst and they're
[59:10] going to be in love with his presence
[59:12] they're going to be in love with his
[59:13] word and they're going to honor him and
[59:16] cry out every time he comes by amen why
[59:20] because his presence is everything to us
[59:23] his presence is everything like MO Moses
[59:26] said in Exodus 33 If thy presence not go
[59:29] not go not with me carry us not up hence
[59:33] Lord I don't want to go without your
[59:35] presence I don't want to service without
[59:38] your presence oh is God going to move
[59:40] every single time I believe he is I hope
[59:43] he does otherwise why am I here why did
[59:46] I show up who's going to help me Lord
[59:49] you alone have the words of life you
[59:52] alone can break my chains you alone Lord
[59:55] move to tonight move here move in this
[59:58] moment Lord Jesus that's our
[1:00:02] desire
[1:00:04] Hallelujah a people who long for and
[1:00:08] recognize his
[1:00:10] presence amen they're going to be God
[1:00:13] conscious and conscious here means aware
[1:00:17] of and responding to one's
[1:00:20] surroundings painfully aware of and
[1:00:24] sensitive to
[1:00:27] amen sensitive to his presence aware of
[1:00:31] his presence you know before the fall
[1:00:34] being conscious of God wasn't
[1:00:36] difficult there in the Garden of Eden
[1:00:38] Adam never experienced
[1:00:41] fear Adam never experienced
[1:00:44] unbelief he had never experienced doubt
[1:00:47] the the very things that blind us and
[1:00:49] hinder us from seeing into that
[1:00:51] spiritual realm did not hinder Adam
[1:00:53] because they didn't exist
[1:00:56] and yet it's after the fall in Genesis
[1:00:58] 3:10 that the word afraid is used for
[1:01:01] the first time and he said I heard thy
[1:01:04] voice in the garden and I was
[1:01:07] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[1:01:10] myself now notice what's Adam been doing
[1:01:12] he's been running from
[1:01:14] God and now he's telling God why I was
[1:01:18] running from him because I was
[1:01:21] afraid and right in that moment Satan
[1:01:23] recognizes his weapon to keep people
[1:01:25] people from being blessed by the
[1:01:27] presence of God is fear because what
[1:01:31] fear is going to keep you from doing is
[1:01:33] it's going to keep you from running to
[1:01:34] God and it's going to keep you running
[1:01:37] away from God he saw that fear is going
[1:01:40] to keep them going the other direction
[1:01:41] fear is going to keep you hiding fear is
[1:01:43] going to keep you covering up fear is
[1:01:45] going to keep you making
[1:01:47] excuses and he recognizes this and he
[1:01:50] would and he recognizes fear caused them
[1:01:53] to hide from the very thing that would
[1:01:56] deliver you from the very thing that'll
[1:01:59] set you free it'll cause you to hide
[1:02:01] from it and because of this in the Bible
[1:02:04] we see the phrase fear not used over 80
[1:02:07] times fear not fear not fear not because
[1:02:12] God knows what Satan uses God knows is
[1:02:15] that he uses fear to make you miss your
[1:02:19] opportunities he uses fear to limit our
[1:02:22] victories fear is nothing more than a
[1:02:24] chain that gets placed on your life to
[1:02:27] limit you from going as far as you were
[1:02:29] intended to go it keeps you from
[1:02:31] becoming all that you were called to be
[1:02:33] I'm not saying you're not a Christian
[1:02:35] I'm not saying you're not overcoming but
[1:02:37] he's got that little hold on you that
[1:02:39] keeps you from blossoming into
[1:02:40] everything that God saw you before the
[1:02:42] foundation of the world and he's holding
[1:02:45] you with that fear and he uses it and
[1:02:48] you're afraid that he won't forgive
[1:02:50] you you're afraid that you've gone too
[1:02:54] far you're afraid to let loose in his
[1:02:56] presence and let your worship go
[1:02:59] completely and for some people it's just
[1:03:01] passing thoughts but for other people
[1:03:03] fear can be
[1:03:06] crippling it can hinder them and it can
[1:03:08] bind them and it robs you of the very
[1:03:10] Freedom you long for you long for
[1:03:13] Freedom you desire that freedom you want
[1:03:15] that Victory but there's that nagging
[1:03:17] fear it's just trying to hold you right
[1:03:20] there in the back and it makes you hide
[1:03:22] from your opportunities and it makes you
[1:03:24] miss the moment when God's passing by
[1:03:28] and I'll just say tonight I believe it's
[1:03:30] time for that fear to end I believe it's
[1:03:32] time to put a stop to it right now and
[1:03:34] it's time for those of you that have
[1:03:36] been tormented by fear to say tonight is
[1:03:38] the night tonight it is finished tonight
[1:03:41] it ends I'm drawing a Line in the Sand

[1:05:25] there ain't nothing wrong with family
[1:05:27] Cycles we just got to start pointing to
[1:05:28] the right family
[1:05:30] Cycles my kin folk was in the upper
[1:05:33] room I'm sorry if I get unruly it's it's
[1:05:36] a family tradition it's what we do my
[1:05:39] people's Peter my people that stood up
[1:05:42] one day and said repent and be baptized
[1:05:45] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:05:46] Holy Ghost and when you do you're going
[1:05:49] to get drunk you're going to stumble out
[1:05:51] in the streets and testify and glorify
[1:05:54] God and we don't care care our family
[1:05:56] ain't scared we ain't ashamed we believe
[1:05:59] in a living God a mighty God and when he
[1:06:02] comes by it's our opportunity to praise
[1:06:06] His
[1:06:08] name
[1:06:10] hallelujah
[1:06:17] hallelu
[1:06:22] hallelujah I got slow down I think I got
[1:06:24] about another hour to go
[1:06:27] wear this fat boy
[1:06:36] out Hallelujah it excites me I'm
[1:06:43] sorry we've recognized his
[1:06:46] presence a message has made us God
[1:06:51] conscious and his presence doesn't cause
[1:06:53] us to hide anymore
[1:06:55] but now we can run to him because his
[1:06:58] presence is what brings us Victory it's
[1:07:01] the fact that he is here that we are
[1:07:03] Overcomers
[1:07:05] amen before Adam fell the voice in the
[1:07:07] garden the voice of God was a daily
[1:07:10] occurrence to man his presence was
[1:07:13] expected every single day as he would
[1:07:16] come down and walk through the garden
[1:07:17] and he would fellowship with his
[1:07:19] children the prophet of God said and
[1:07:21] they had Fellowship love for one another
[1:07:24] how the moving of the spirit went
[1:07:25] through the bushes the Lions came up the
[1:07:28] Tigers all of them and they worshiped
[1:07:31] the
[1:07:31] Lord he said man was conscious at all
[1:07:36] times that his presence was with him but
[1:07:40] see what happens in the fall as man is
[1:07:42] separated from that
[1:07:44] Consciousness before that man had been
[1:07:46] Superior to anything on the earth he
[1:07:48] ruled over the animal life they obeyed
[1:07:51] him he had Juris uh uh jurisdiction over
[1:07:53] the Earth the winds obeyed him and
[1:07:56] brother brandham actually described him
[1:07:57] as a secondary God upon the
[1:07:59] Earth everything under Adam obeyed Adam
[1:08:04] but all of that was lost in the fall
[1:08:06] because Man became unconscious of it
[1:08:09] because he lost Fellowship he lost
[1:08:10] friendship and he lost relationship with
[1:08:12] God and all the channels that God moved
[1:08:15] through became clogged
[1:08:18] up and we know that Jesus came to to cl
[1:08:21] to unclog and and to restore all that
[1:08:24] Adam had lost and and Jesus came and
[1:08:26] showed us how that we could operate he
[1:08:28] showed how man was supposed to operate
[1:08:30] before the fall before sin's nature took
[1:08:33] over this flesh and he came and he spoke
[1:08:35] to storms he cast out Devils he lived in
[1:08:38] the Supernatural and He restored all the
[1:08:41] fellowship that had been lost brother
[1:08:43] Brown said he brought us back to the
[1:08:45] Eternal fellowship and relationship to
[1:08:47] God to be his sons and daughters again
[1:08:50] to restore back all that Adam lost in
[1:08:53] the fall
[1:08:55] and now we know that from there we we go
[1:08:57] into the first Age and and in the first
[1:09:00] age things begin to slip again things
[1:09:02] begin to creep in and the Wolves begin
[1:09:05] to creep in and they begin to nitpick
[1:09:07] how the spirit moved in a service they
[1:09:09] began to to analyze everything and they
[1:09:12] begin to criticize the people's freedom
[1:09:14] and and voices of great Renown and and
[1:09:16] great teachers began to tone down the
[1:09:18] worship they began to restrict freedom
[1:09:21] and and over time the channels that had
[1:09:23] been unclogged came clogged again to
[1:09:27] where people could no longer recognize
[1:09:30] his presence and the moving of the
[1:09:32] spirit began to get label was like
[1:09:33] that's just emotion because the channels
[1:09:36] had become clogged up and and man once
[1:09:39] again lost consciousness of what we were
[1:09:42] put here to do listen I I love my family
[1:09:47] I love the life God has given us and and
[1:09:49] I love all that but God put us here for
[1:09:51] one purpose to manifest him amen we are
[1:09:56] here to manifest God upon the Earth and
[1:09:58] many times man forgets that the prophet
[1:10:01] of God says it's all become so clogged
[1:10:04] clogged up until God can't operate
[1:10:06] through those channels that he made man
[1:10:09] for now when God made the human body
[1:10:12] every little part had a place to play
[1:10:14] the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose
[1:10:17] God does everything in there to make it
[1:10:19] perfect in operation to make the man to
[1:10:23] live and if God so patterned the man the
[1:10:26] body of a man how much more has he
[1:10:28] patterned and set in order the body of
[1:10:31] Christ the church and he's designed us
[1:10:34] to come together in Heavenly places in
[1:10:36] Christ Jesus and have these Supernatural
[1:10:40] workings of God Outlets through gifts of
[1:10:43] the Spirit such as prophecy and wisdom
[1:10:46] and knowledge and Gifts of healing and
[1:10:49] all these other different gifts is
[1:10:51] Outlets that God lets out his power and
[1:10:54] lets out out his Revelation to the
[1:10:58] people now I don't think that we should
[1:11:00] Stand By and stand for anything that
[1:11:02] tries to come in and clog those Outlets
[1:11:04] up I don't think we should stand by and
[1:11:06] let anybody come and mess with the
[1:11:08] faucet and Tamp down on the flow of the
[1:11:11] things God put in place to manifest his
[1:11:14] power and give Revelation to the church
[1:11:16] anybody starts touching the SP and I say
[1:11:18] ah back off you ain't messing with my
[1:11:20] with the flow you're not messing with my
[1:11:22] outlet God's going to manifest through
[1:11:24] here you can do that in your church you
[1:11:26] can have your ideas but here it's going
[1:11:28] to float free it's going to remain
[1:11:30] unclocked as a matter of fact give me a
[1:11:33] shovel I'mma dig it out some more give
[1:11:35] me a shovel I want to open it up wider I
[1:11:38] want it to come through like a gusher
[1:11:40] well we just want to direct it this way
[1:11:42] little no sir we're going to direct it
[1:11:44] how the Holy Spirit sees fit to direct
[1:11:47] it in our services I'm just going to get
[1:11:50] out the way and say flow flow
[1:11:54] flow have your way
[1:11:57] Lord
[1:12:00] hallelujah it's God
[1:12:02] moving and we got to recognize it as
[1:12:05] such and not Tamp it down but say hey I
[1:12:09] see some fire somebody pour some
[1:12:11] gasoline on that let's blow this thing
[1:12:14] up let's open the floodgates let's get
[1:12:16] it hot in here the fellas down a few
[1:12:20] seats down from me may not feel this
[1:12:21] heat I want them to experience too I
[1:12:24] don't just want to keep it up here I
[1:12:26] don't just want to keep it up here on
[1:12:28] this row on this row I want it from here
[1:12:30] out the back door down the street all
[1:12:32] around the neighborhood they say there's
[1:12:34] fire burning up there there's something
[1:12:36] going on in the lighthouse I see the
[1:12:38] light coming out of it there's life
[1:12:41] there's fire there's power there's
[1:12:43] Victory there's something different
[1:12:45] because we ain't stopping the flow flow
[1:12:49] Jesus flow Holy Spirit have your way in
[1:12:52] this place
[1:12:53] tonight h
[1:12:55] [Applause]
[1:13:00] Hallelujah well they're just emotional
[1:13:05] yep I've never understood people that
[1:13:07] say that and think I'm gonna argue with
[1:13:10] them of course we
[1:13:13] are did anybody say we
[1:13:16] wasn't well you're just emotional you're
[1:13:19] right the the prophet said that listen
[1:13:22] how he says it and it is
[1:13:26] true that when the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:13:29] so that's step number
[1:13:30] one do you not do you want the Holy
[1:13:32] Ghost to come down when the Holy Ghost
[1:13:35] comes down it stirs the crowd to
[1:13:42] emotion oh
[1:13:44] no oh
[1:13:46] no they're sitting there Anointed with
[1:13:51] the spirit of God and the Holy Ghost
[1:13:55] sweeps across them it stirs emotion it's
[1:13:59] got to it's got to it's got to well
[1:14:06] we're not emotional in our church well
[1:14:08] according to my Louisiana algebra and
[1:14:10] this equation that just means the Holy
[1:14:13] Ghost isn't sweeping through the
[1:14:14] building at your
[1:14:20] church because he said when it sweeps
[1:14:23] you get emotional it's it's got to it's
[1:14:26] got to it's got to why he said because
[1:14:30] they're Anointed with the spirit of
[1:14:33] God I can't help this it stirs me
[1:14:38] up it's got
[1:14:40] [Applause]
[1:14:48] to see the problem is you just see the
[1:14:52] emotion but you fail to see why they
[1:14:54] emotion
[1:14:57] because you fail to recognize him now
[1:15:01] sure you recognize him
[1:15:03] then you see what he used to do you
[1:15:06] recognize it back there but we have to
[1:15:08] be God conscious
[1:15:11] now aware that he's moving now and
[1:15:15] that's always been man's fa failure they
[1:15:17] always point back to what God did and
[1:15:20] they always Point ahead to what God's
[1:15:21] going to do they fail to recognize that
[1:15:24] he is the I am God the everpresent help
[1:15:27] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:30] now you know it's like in that scripture
[1:15:33] I almost wonder if they read it Jesus
[1:15:34] Christ the same yesterday and
[1:15:37] forever don't leave out the Today
[1:15:39] part because I'm thankful he was I'm
[1:15:42] thankful he is he's the Alpha and Omega
[1:15:44] but if he ain't the today he can't help
[1:15:47] me cuz I got to have God today I need
[1:15:51] Victory today I need overcoming power
[1:15:53] today I need him to move in my family
[1:15:56] today I must have him
[1:15:58] today so that first church burst forth
[1:16:02] from Pentecost and they were alive in
[1:16:03] the Supernatural they were filled with
[1:16:06] the Holy Ghost and miracles were
[1:16:07] happening daily because Jesus had had
[1:16:11] had brought back and he had returned
[1:16:12] what Adam had lost and just I I kind of
[1:16:15] hit this for a second but to say it
[1:16:16] again we know that nickan ISM began to
[1:16:18] creep in and Men began to try to control
[1:16:22] the moving of the spirit and and Men be
[1:16:25] to try to order it out of the
[1:16:27] congregation and by so doing it placed
[1:16:29] all the spiritual gifts in the ministry
[1:16:31] how
[1:16:33] convenient and they began to order it
[1:16:35] out of the congregation and it choked
[1:16:37] the life out of the church and Order
[1:16:40] became more important than
[1:16:42] births order became more important than
[1:16:46] Allowing God to
[1:16:47] move and that church began to fall away
[1:16:50] and we know that they went down into
[1:16:51] death but God was determined I'm going
[1:16:54] to have a bride I'm going to have a
[1:16:57] church that doesn't just honor me in in
[1:17:00] their sayings and in what they read but
[1:17:02] they're going to recognize my presence
[1:17:05] they're going to recognize me when I
[1:17:07] move they're going to know me when I'm
[1:17:09] in their midst and he began his great
[1:17:11] work of restoration and we know that
[1:17:13] Luther comes forth with with
[1:17:15] justification and Wesley comes forth
[1:17:17] with sanctification and and the things
[1:17:19] of God once again began to burn in man's
[1:17:22] Consciousness it was an Awakening in the
[1:17:24] history books they call it the Great
[1:17:26] Awakening and these things are are
[1:17:28] happening and then the isua street uh
[1:17:30] Revival happens and there's a
[1:17:31] restoration of the gifts and and then a
[1:17:34] prophet comes on the scene with a mighty
[1:17:37] message and out of that a bride begins
[1:17:39] to rise
[1:17:40] up and we know there there had been
[1:17:43] other moves there had been other Mighty
[1:17:44] revivals and and there had been great
[1:17:46] Awakenings but but this Awakening was
[1:17:49] greater than any of the other great
[1:17:51] Awakenings or Awakenings of the past
[1:17:53] because there was a bride who was waking
[1:17:55] up and becoming keenly aware of the
[1:17:58] presence of her
[1:18:00] bridegroom becoming aware that he was in
[1:18:02] her midst and and the word Awakening
[1:18:05] here means the act of awaking from sleep
[1:18:09] a Revival of Interest or attention a
[1:18:13] recognition realization or coming into
[1:18:16] awareness of something and brother
[1:18:19] brandham speaking about this he says now
[1:18:21] a few years ago when I started there was
[1:18:23] none that was going going on he said
[1:18:26] there was none of that going on and the
[1:18:28] only thing that this has done and this
[1:18:32] supernatural has awakened ministers out
[1:18:34] of their sense bound religion into a
[1:18:38] place to where they see God is
[1:18:43] present but see the the problem is is
[1:18:47] that many failed to recognize who it was
[1:18:49] that was really
[1:18:52] here they failed to realize who it was
[1:18:54] that really came to bring a message who
[1:18:57] it was that was being
[1:18:58] revealed it was the mighty
[1:19:01] Angel it was the pillar of fire that led
[1:19:04] Israel it was the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:19:08] so many failed to recognize his presence
[1:19:12] in all of this they recognized the
[1:19:15] prophet and indeed they needed to but
[1:19:19] they recognized the prophet but when the
[1:19:20] prophet was taken they believed that the
[1:19:22] supernatural went with him
[1:19:25] because all that they were ever awakened
[1:19:27] to was the
[1:19:30] prophet and so when that went away many
[1:19:33] begin to not expect God to move they
[1:19:35] couldn't recognize God moving and yet
[1:19:37] the whole time brother Brandon was
[1:19:38] trying to wake people up to the fact he
[1:19:41] is here Jesus is here it's not about
[1:19:44] William Brown it's not about me I'm not
[1:19:46] Gathering you to me what was he telling
[1:19:48] you is he's here he's here the pillar of
[1:19:50] fire has returned he's in our midst you
[1:19:53] got to recognize that he's here he's the
[1:19:55] one amongst us he's the one doing these
[1:19:57] Works he's the one Discerning the hearts
[1:19:59] he would say it's never failed who could
[1:20:01] do that only the Lord
[1:20:03] Jesus he never pointed to himself it
[1:20:05] wasn't about him the whole time he was
[1:20:07] saying quit looking at me it's him it's
[1:20:10] him it's him he's here he's who you got
[1:20:13] to have he's the Savior he's the
[1:20:15] bridegroom I came to point you to
[1:20:19] him and that's what the message was he's
[1:20:22] saying you got to have him
[1:20:25] be aware of him be conscious of
[1:20:27] him he's in our midst and we must
[1:20:30] recognize our opportunity in his
[1:20:34] presence what what are you saying
[1:20:35] brother I'm saying you better seize the
[1:20:37] moment seize every opportunity don't let
[1:20:41] one of them pass because they're
[1:20:42] precious
[1:20:46] moments there's many even in in the
[1:20:49] midst of what we call the message this
[1:20:52] great marvelous message there's many
[1:20:54] that are are
[1:20:56] slumbering there's many that are
[1:20:57] slumbering in in this time as man W
[1:21:01] would call it the delay God has delayed
[1:21:04] his coming but I'm telling you tonight
[1:21:06] we got to wake
[1:21:07] up we got to be awake we got to be alert
[1:21:10] we got to be conscious he's passing by
[1:21:13] this
[1:21:14] moment don't wait don't
[1:21:17] Slumber and remember just because
[1:21:20] because he comes by your way doesn't
[1:21:21] mean you receive anything
[1:21:24] you have to recognize him you have to
[1:21:27] cry out to
[1:21:29] him think
[1:21:31] about how many people Jesus came to or
[1:21:34] passed by or walked past that never
[1:21:35] received
[1:21:37] anything how many people that maybe he
[1:21:39] sit next to or or even spoke to and and
[1:21:42] they didn't receive a thing because they
[1:21:43] didn't recognize him you must recognize
[1:21:47] his presence and grab hold to it I hear
[1:21:50] a prophet Discerning on tape and he
[1:21:52] would say he would discern a heart and
[1:21:54] he'd say oh no she's going to miss it
[1:21:57] that's right oh no she's going to miss
[1:21:59] it and he'd say she missed it but you
[1:22:03] got
[1:22:04] it she missed it but you got it there
[1:22:08] may be plenty of people missing it but
[1:22:10] somebody's going to be the you got it
[1:22:12] somebody's going to be the I see him I'm
[1:22:14] not missing it yes Lord I hear my name
[1:22:17] yes Lord that's me yes
[1:22:20] Lord somebody's going to grab hold to it
[1:22:23] and be God icious and aware and wake
[1:22:26] up we can't afford to miss an
[1:22:30] opportunity he's a supernatural God and
[1:22:32] he moves in Supernatural ways and he
[1:22:34] expects his children to recognize him
[1:22:37] when he moves and not only that he wants
[1:22:40] us to want him to move he wants us to
[1:22:43] expect him to move last week was great
[1:22:46] I'm thankful for the outpouring last
[1:22:48] week but God I'm expecting it tonight
[1:22:51] Lord I know you're going to move
[1:22:52] tomorrow but I'm expecting it in this
[1:22:54] Saturday night in this service tonight I
[1:22:56] expect the blessings tonight I expect
[1:22:59] the Holy Ghost to fall tonight I expect
[1:23:01] healings in this building tonight I
[1:23:03] expect Deliverance in this place tonight
[1:23:05] families restored tonight God to move
[1:23:08] tonight the pillar of fire to be
[1:23:10] manifest tonight this moment because
[1:23:12] he's here his presence is here in this
[1:23:16] place
[1:23:19] Hallelujah when you come like that you
[1:23:21] won't miss
[1:23:23] him you you won't miss
[1:23:25] him we we you know we love when he comes
[1:23:29] and we can feel
[1:23:31] it but what about being conscious of God
[1:23:34] when you don't feel
[1:23:39] it even when I don't see it he's
[1:23:43] working even when I don't feel it he's
[1:23:47] working and I'm aware of it because I've
[1:23:50] been turned and turned into it by a
[1:23:52] message of the hour that called my name
[1:23:55] by word in the Bible that says where two
[1:23:56] or three are gathered he's there you're
[1:24:00] not going to feel him every
[1:24:02] service but just
[1:24:07] because but even if you don't feel him
[1:24:10] if you believe the word that says he's
[1:24:12] here why not worship him just like you
[1:24:15] do when you do feel
[1:24:17] him I'm not feeling anything but you
[1:24:19] know what I see the effects of him I can
[1:24:22] sit inside my house and I might not can
[1:24:24] feel the wind but I can look out the
[1:24:25] window and see the trees doing this and
[1:24:28] I go I ain't feeling it but the wind's
[1:24:29] blowing the wind's moving and it may not
[1:24:32] be feeling it tonight but I see this one
[1:24:34] shouting and this one dancing and
[1:24:35] tongues coming forward right here and I
[1:24:37] say I don't feel it but I see the
[1:24:39] effects of it so I know he's in the
[1:24:41] building Lord I see you I recognize you
[1:24:45] I'm going to praise you I'm going to cry
[1:24:47] out I'm going to get what I have need of
[1:24:49] because I know you're here whether I
[1:24:52] feel it or not
[1:24:58] Hallelujah aware of it awake to it
[1:25:03] conscious of it recognize him in your
[1:25:06] every day it's not just about
[1:25:08] recognizing him twice a
[1:25:10] week recognize him in your blessings
[1:25:13] every day and his grace in your life
[1:25:16] every single day knowing that that he's
[1:25:18] in the service because he said he would
[1:25:20] be
[1:25:21] here brother Brown says Jesus Christ is
[1:25:24] here present if we could be conscious of
[1:25:27] that and remember not only here but when
[1:25:30] you're walking down the street wherever
[1:25:32] you are you that profess to be Believers
[1:25:35] and fear the lord remember the angels of
[1:25:37] God are moving with you wherever you are
[1:25:40] they watch everything you do every
[1:25:42] thought that goes through your mind they
[1:25:44] know all about you therefore we must be
[1:25:48] conscious of that pardon me
[1:25:59] God
[1:26:00] conscious brother Bram speaking here
[1:26:02] about gesi and Elisha and I thought this
[1:26:04] was incredible talking about being aware
[1:26:07] even when we don't feel it or see it he
[1:26:10] said just the same tonight I wonder what
[1:26:11] would happen if a man here tonight had
[1:26:13] the power to strike across your eyes and
[1:26:15] say look standing around this Tabernacle
[1:26:17] tonight I'll say it around this
[1:26:20] Tabernacle tonight he says you'd be a
[1:26:23] member here the rest of your life he
[1:26:25] says yes sir sometimes you can't see it
[1:26:28] with your natural eyes now this this
[1:26:30] quote shocked me I thought it was
[1:26:32] awesome he said but you can feel the
[1:26:34] impulse of it something near a six sense
[1:26:37] that denotes something is near now he
[1:26:40] didn't see that at first but Elisha
[1:26:44] probably didn't see it but he asked for
[1:26:47] the boy's eyes to see it Elisha was
[1:26:50] conscious they were there he says excuse
[1:26:52] me he says Elijah didn't see it but he
[1:26:55] asked for the boys to see it but Elisha
[1:26:57] was conscious that they were there
[1:26:59] Elisha didn't see it but he was
[1:27:02] conscious of it because he tried to stay
[1:27:05] conscious of God whereas the boy needed
[1:27:07] to see
[1:27:08] it El just Elisha just knew he trusted
[1:27:13] just like tonight I I haven't seen the
[1:27:15] pillar of fire tonight brother Andrew
[1:27:18] but I don't have a doubt that it's
[1:27:20] here I'm conscious that it's moving in
[1:27:22] our midst I see it striking some of your
[1:27:25] hearts I see some of you becoming aware
[1:27:27] of his presence I know that he's moving
[1:27:29] in here because he promised that he
[1:27:31] would and we're a people that's been
[1:27:33] called to be God conscious aware of the
[1:27:36] supernatural aware that he's here aware
[1:27:39] that he's working in responding to him
[1:27:41] whether we feel it or not and what
[1:27:44] happened when the message began to come
[1:27:46] forth is it made many people aware of
[1:27:49] the supernatural as that swept around
[1:27:50] the world they were awakened to its
[1:27:53] realities and to the power of it and yet
[1:27:56] to me brother Andrew it's like a lot of
[1:27:58] people have hit the snooze
[1:28:00] button they were
[1:28:02] awakened but then they reached over and
[1:28:04] hit the snooze
[1:28:05] button you know the alarm goes off to
[1:28:08] wake you up and you're aware for a
[1:28:09] moment of what's going on and what's
[1:28:12] happening but you don't come fully aware
[1:28:15] and you hit the snooze button and doze
[1:28:16] back off now I know we all sleep
[1:28:20] different and we all wake up different
[1:28:24] some people's like man when sunlight
[1:28:26] comes through my window I just can't lay
[1:28:28] there no more I'm like sunlight don't
[1:28:31] hinder
[1:28:33] me I conquered that I'm an overcomer
[1:28:38] I'm sunlight means roll
[1:28:42] over turn your back to the
[1:28:46] window but when I I'm going tell on
[1:28:48] myself a little bit it's a can't lie in
[1:28:50] church anyway
[1:28:52] so when when I when I was a school
[1:28:55] teacher and it's still this way I'm
[1:28:58] going have to turn in my man
[1:29:00] card our alarm clock's on my wife's side
[1:29:03] of the bed cuz if it's on my side of the
[1:29:05] bed it' just keep going off and would
[1:29:07] nothing
[1:29:08] happen I I'd unplug it or or you know
[1:29:12] but it's on my wife's side of the bed
[1:29:13] because it awakens her and then she
[1:29:17] kicks
[1:29:19] me and she keeps kicking me until I get
[1:29:23] up and I'll say I'm up and she go no
[1:29:26] you're not you're still laying
[1:29:28] there I I I I I'm away yeah but you're
[1:29:32] you're not up
[1:29:33] yet all right when I was in high school
[1:29:37] my my dad would come wake me up and I
[1:29:39] had a staircase next to my bed and he'd
[1:29:41] sit right there on that staircase and
[1:29:42] dad got great joy out of this he enjoyed
[1:29:44] annoying me I believe and he would sit
[1:29:46] there and he'd look at
[1:29:48] me and in the most monotone annoying
[1:29:51] voice possible he would say say my name
[1:29:54] over and over and over and over and over
[1:29:56] again until he didn't care how long it
[1:29:58] took cuz he was happy doing it he would
[1:30:00] sit right there and he'd go Aaron Aaron
[1:30:03] Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron
[1:30:06] Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron Aaron you're

[1:34:44] manufactured
[1:34:45] Holiness unaware of his
[1:34:48] presence asleep in their
[1:34:50] works because they heart alarm go off
[1:34:53] and they think they're awake and they're
[1:34:55] totally unaware that he's
[1:34:57] moving refusing to recognize his
[1:35:01] presence then a stirring will come into

[1:35:30] comfortable but we slip right back into
[1:35:33] our comfort
[1:35:35] zone listen Comfort is one of the worst
[1:35:38] things that can happen for a
[1:35:42] Christian you get you get loose you get
[1:35:46] come there they
[1:35:48] say and forgive me I'm just trying to
[1:35:50] paraphrase this but I read it the other
[1:35:52] day that most major Act accidents on big

[1:35:55] right at the very end of
[1:35:57] it because people get comfortable man

[1:36:00] straight days we've got it worked

[1:36:09] precaution they're not awake to what's

[1:37:11] Rapture I'm here to praise God I'm here
[1:37:13] for victory I ain't here to make
[1:37:15] everybody happy this message ain't going
[1:37:18] to make everybody happy the movement of
[1:37:20] the spirit ain't going to make everybody
[1:37:21] happy but God's children they're going
[1:37:24] to love it they're going to move with it
[1:37:27] they're going to flow in it they're
[1:37:28] going to say pour it out tonight Lord
[1:37:31] like never before I recognize my
[1:37:34] opportunity
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:41] tonight man when the fire fell in the
[1:37:43] upper room and the stirring
[1:37:45] came they became aware that that the
[1:37:49] Jesus that had ascended was once again
[1:37:52] in the room amen
[1:37:55] and the power of God came in and came on
[1:37:56] the inside of them and the prophet says
[1:37:59] and the power of God so enclosed those
[1:38:02] people and anointed them till they run
[1:38:05] out into the streets screaming and
[1:38:08] dancing and hollering and acting like a
[1:38:11] bunch of drunk people that's the
[1:38:13] scripture thus saith the
[1:38:17] Lord why'd they do
[1:38:20] that why'd they dance
[1:38:23] why' they
[1:38:25] scream why' they
[1:38:28] shout why' they act like drunk people
[1:38:31] well brother Andrew to me it's obvious
[1:38:33] it's because they's out of
[1:38:38] order just
[1:38:42] kidding well because say I don't
[1:38:45] nope because they was empowered and they
[1:38:48] was anointed by the power of God and
[1:38:51] when that happens sometimes these old
[1:38:52] bodies just don't know what to do and so
[1:38:54] I'm just going to praise Him however he
[1:38:56] anoints me to praise him and I want to
[1:38:57] go ahead and make this clear don't think
[1:38:59] that I'm that person that thinks you all
[1:39:00] got to praise that way I'm just saying
[1:39:03] you got to praise him some
[1:39:05] way when he moves and you recognize he's
[1:39:07] here you got to praise him some
[1:39:10] way I I'll never forget I may have told
[1:39:12] this one time I was preaching at home
[1:39:14] when when my daddy was still living and
[1:39:16] my daddy always sat in church like
[1:39:20] this and I'm going along preaching and I
[1:39:22] just said you know you you got to praise
[1:39:24] God and and I I even said I said if
[1:39:26] people in town ask some of you where you
[1:39:28] worship you better not tell them this
[1:39:30] church cuz you go to church here but I
[1:39:32] don't never see you
[1:39:33] worship and I said I just want to tell
[1:39:35] you right now this ain't a form of
[1:39:38] worship and when I did I was looking
[1:39:40] right at my daddy and he was looking
[1:39:42] right at me just like
[1:39:48] that we had a good laugh about it later
[1:39:52] not right then though
[1:39:54] he didn't budge I just want you to know
[1:39:56] [Laughter]
[1:39:58] he boy
[1:40:02] no we should worship God they were
[1:40:06] anointed and they were anointed by the
[1:40:08] power of God they were anointed so so if
[1:40:11] that's what caused it then let them say
[1:40:14] it's just
[1:40:16] emotion let them say it's just people
[1:40:18] getting carried away let them say it's
[1:40:20] out of order I really don't care what
[1:40:23] they say listen we've been out of order
[1:40:25] since this thing started we've been
[1:40:27] dancing in the spirit since this thing
[1:40:29] started we've been talking in tongues
[1:40:31] since this thing started and we ain't
[1:40:34] about to stop now it's How We Roll it's
[1:40:37] what we do it's how we praise it's the
[1:40:40] outlets that we let the Holy Spirit
[1:40:43] manif manifest themselves through if you
[1:40:46] don't like it that's okay that's what we
[1:40:49] do that's how we praise that's how we we
[1:40:53] worship that's how we let him
[1:40:56] [Applause]
[1:41:05] move I'm not going to be able to finish
[1:41:07] all this that's okay y'all give me a few
[1:41:09] more

[1:46:45] Mama Eagle sweeps down you're going to
[1:46:47] catch a ride into eternity

[1:46:57] the spirit cuz on that day I'm going to
[1:46:59] wake up I'm going to recognize it's
[1:47:02] Rapture day it's going home day I feel
[1:47:05] the spirit sweeping over I'm going to
[1:47:07] spread my wings and I'm going to go home
[1:47:11] Hallelujah I'm going to go
[1:47:16] home
[1:47:20] Hallelujah so yes we preach the super
[1:47:23] Supernatural man I'm all untucked and
[1:47:25] unkept
[1:47:27] and we'll have to fix it
[1:47:31] later we preach the
[1:47:33] miraculous because where Jesus is You'll
[1:47:35] Always Find the
[1:47:37] Supernatural and I find that Satan
[1:47:40] constantly attacks it and he tries to
[1:47:42] point to carnal
[1:47:45] impersonations but his children
[1:47:47] recognize look Janice and jambes was
[1:47:50] there of course and you know it
[1:47:54] worked ancient Jewish sources say this
[1:47:57] ain't scripture but the rabbis write
[1:47:59] that one out of every five Israelites
[1:48:02] left
[1:48:03] Egypt that the rest chose to stay
[1:48:07] behind and why should we go I mean they
[1:48:09] do the same signs you do they jump and
[1:48:12] Shout just like you and they you they're
[1:48:14] just
[1:48:14] magicians they do this and they do that
[1:48:17] but the children of God recognize the
[1:48:20] realities of the supernatural they
[1:48:23] recognize that I ain't worried about the
[1:48:24] impersonations that don't worry me none
[1:48:27] that don't harm me
[1:48:29] none
[1:48:31] listen you get a bunch of people
[1:48:33] worshiping God and you get a few people
[1:48:35] that are doing it because they're just
[1:48:38] excited
[1:48:39] and I guess I just don't understand the
[1:48:44] problem are we not to do you not want
[1:48:46] your children excited in the presence of
[1:48:50] God are we not brother said well those
[1:48:54] are just the
[1:48:55] blessings
[1:48:58] yeah I guess I thought I was supposed to
[1:49:00] want them I my
[1:49:03] bad I want the
[1:49:06] blessings I want my children to enjoy
[1:49:10] church I want them to know there's a
[1:49:12] supernatural God and there's a reality
[1:49:15] to God I want them to be a part of that
[1:49:18] brother Brown says many people are great
[1:49:20] lovers of God raised up under the church
[1:49:23] they believe their church that's right
[1:49:24] they believe God but as far as the
[1:49:26] supernatural being operated in a human
[1:49:28] being today that's beyond anything they
[1:49:29] can swallow but that's where the truth
[1:49:33] is now that is the truth God is my
[1:49:37] Supreme judge that's where the truth
[1:49:40] lays he's talking about in the
[1:49:42] Supernatural he says I'll tell you I
[1:49:45] ain't criticizing the Baptist but
[1:49:47] Baptist people fundamentally know what
[1:49:49] they're talking about as long as it
[1:49:50] comes to the word but they know nothing
[1:49:53] about the Supernatural and my brethren
[1:49:55] that's where you're losing the
[1:49:58] blessing and when we lose touch with
[1:50:00] that Supernatural and I'm fing to bring
[1:50:02] this to a
[1:50:04] close when the supernatural isn't
[1:50:06] preached we end up with dead Services we
[1:50:09] end up with dead people dead pews dead
[1:50:11] homes and people destined to do nothing
[1:50:13] but perpetuate the
[1:50:15] ages listen we can't
[1:50:17] Slumber we can't go back to
[1:50:20] sleep blind barus
[1:50:23] you know he's sitting there how is it
[1:50:25] that we can see so much and not
[1:50:27] recognize we can see so much and yet a
[1:50:30] blind man can recognize his chance the
[1:50:33] prophet tells us that he thought that he
[1:50:35] had missed it he thought it was too late
[1:50:38] and I love it here in Mark
[1:50:40] 10:47 it says he began to cry out and
[1:50:42] say Jesus thou son of David have mercy
[1:50:45] on me barus was recognizing this is
[1:50:49] it and I'm going to go ahead and tell
[1:50:51] you maybe I I don't I know maybe it's
[1:50:53] not good of me but this is my favorite
[1:50:55] part in the whole
[1:50:56] story it says and many charged him that
[1:51:00] he should hold his peace but he cried
[1:51:03] out the more a great deal I'm going to
[1:51:07] go ahead and tell you there's a lot of
[1:51:08] people saying y'all need to tone down
[1:51:10] them Services y'all getting a little out
[1:51:12] of hand up there at Full Gospel over
[1:51:14] there at evening light at some of them
[1:51:15] youth camps y'all getting a little bit
[1:51:16] out of hand and I want to say to them
[1:51:19] you ain't seen nothing yet because I'm
[1:51:22] going to cry out all the more th son of
[1:51:26] David have mercy on me I need you move
[1:51:29] here filled with the Holy Ghost I just
[1:51:32] getting started worshiping I just
[1:51:34] getting started praising because I
[1:51:37] recognize he's here I recognize it's an
[1:51:40] opportunity and I must have him
[1:51:43] tonight I'm just getting started in this
[1:51:47] thing we're just starting the
[1:51:49] fight and it says Jesus came to a stop
[1:51:54] and I filled a stop right
[1:51:58] here it came do a stop and I I believe
[1:52:01] he come to a stop tonight and I asked
[1:52:03] you which way is he going to
[1:52:05] turn is he going to turn and keep
[1:52:08] going is he going to go over here is he
[1:52:10] G he's going to turn to the ones who
[1:52:13] recognize the
[1:52:16] opportunity and who cry
[1:52:20] out the amount we cry out directly
[1:52:24] corresponds with how much we think we
[1:52:26] need
[1:52:28] him when he moves through a place and we
[1:52:30] don't cry out we identify as layout of
[1:52:33] sins because we say we have need of
[1:52:37] nothing when Jesus can move through here
[1:52:40] and we don't cry out for our needs it
[1:52:42] signifies I don't have
[1:52:46] need you have to recognize your need of
[1:52:49] him and you have to cry out and say Lord
