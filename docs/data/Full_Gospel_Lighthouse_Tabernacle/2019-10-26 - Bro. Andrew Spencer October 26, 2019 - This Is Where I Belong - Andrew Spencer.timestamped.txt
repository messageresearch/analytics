[0:29] wonderful to be back in the house of the
[0:30] Lord and to see each and every one of
[0:32] you this evening a man we want to be
[0:36] remembering our pastor as he's there in
[0:38] Ohio some meeting has already started
[0:41] just now and so we just pray that God
[0:43] would minister through our brother in a
[0:46] supernatural way and we also want to be
[0:49] remembered next weekend he will be at
[0:51] brother Hammad's annual meeting so we
[0:54] just want to remember those things in
[0:56] prayer also we'll be praying for brother
[0:58] Matthew tomorrow even and he'll be
[0:59] speaking for us and also brother Jason
[1:03] Jackson has been mentioned November 9th
[1:05] and 10th will be with us and we also
[1:07] always enjoy having brother Jason ease
[1:10] his brother brother Homer would always
[1:13] say General Jackson has coming to town
[1:16] so so we're a privilege to have brother
[1:18] Jason coming and so we just ask that the
[1:21] Lord would remember these sayings and
[1:23] minister through the brothers in a
[1:25] supernatural way and we are certainly
[1:27] looking forward to what God has in store
[1:29] I believe as children of God that we are
[1:33] not just having a revival here and there
[1:35] but I believe that it's a constant
[1:36] revival as we walk into the pulpit this
[1:40] evening it's just the atmosphere of
[1:42] revival that's where it's where God's
[1:45] children are living at it's where
[1:47] they're feeding at and it's it's a time
[1:50] where the word is bringing us to our
[1:52] feet and it's a time in which it's read
[1:55] the word has been restored and we know
[1:57] where we stand that in this hour and his
[2:00] brother William was praying as we can
[2:02] come boldly to him we don't have to back
[2:04] up we know who we are we know who we
[2:07] believe in were the call of God the
[2:09] elected of God and we stand upon God's
[2:11] Word I'd like to share something with
[2:14] you this evening before we we go in
[2:17] service towards the word last weekend
[2:21] that brother Tim Pruitt's church but the
[2:24] Timothy was ministering there and they
[2:26] had a young brother from
[2:28] Denver Colorado that came to their
[2:30] service on that Sunday and he'd been
[2:34] streaming their services for quite some
[2:36] time and he said he just had to come and
[2:38] be in one of those services and and hear
[2:41] hear his favorite preachers and hear his
[2:43] favorite singers and he said he said I
[2:45] just got to be in that he said I got to
[2:46] be in that and one of their services so
[2:48] he got himself a plane he got himself i
[2:51] he got himself a ticket flew flew down
[2:53] flew down to Louisiana little Saturday
[2:56] it went to the rental car place and the
[2:59] rental place told him so you're too
[3:00] young to get a rental car you won't be
[3:02] able to you won't be able to rent one
[3:04] here so he ended up having to stay the
[3:06] night in the airport there so the next
[3:09] morning he woke up he freshened himself
[3:11] up and put his suit coat on and he went
[3:13] down to the rental car place said look
[3:15] I'm going to church and I need a ride
[3:18] they said well you can't get a rental
[3:19] car here and that manager behind the
[3:22] desk asked him so where are you going
[3:23] and so he showed him the address to
[3:26] brother Tim's church there and he said
[3:29] come on took him out to a Dodge Charger
[3:31] the manager took off from his work to
[3:34] take him to church which is over an hour
[3:36] away and then have to drive back so not
[3:41] only did God had to put it on this young
[3:43] man's heart to be in that service but he
[3:45] had to put it upon that managers heart
[3:48] to take him there oh if we would have
[3:51] that kind of desire tonight just to be
[3:57] in the presence of the king I'd say if a
[4:01] young man could come all the way from
[4:03] Denver what about us tonight we're here
[4:06] in his presence and we can ask what we
[4:08] have need of of him and he'll speak to
[4:11] our hearts no matter what your desire is
[4:14] he knows your thoughts afar off that's
[4:17] the kind of God that we're serving this
[4:20] I believe that you the children of God
[4:22] have that kind of desire to see him face
[4:25] to face
[4:26] the Greeks came and said we would see
[4:28] Jesus but they missed him but we can see
[4:31] Jesus we can see Jesus tonight all we
[4:36] have to do is simply believe amen amen I
[4:41] want to sing a song tonight I don't even

[10:46] more time use me for the upbuilding of
[10:49] that key in Jesus name if you have your
[10:54] Bibles this evening we will turn to the
[10:57] book of Genesis chapter 20 and verse 1
[11:01] and if you don't know where the book of
[11:03] Genesis is it's at the very front of
[11:06] your bobbum Genesis chapter 20
[11:28] Genesis 20 and verse 1 and Abraham
[11:32] notice not Abram but Abraham a man that
[11:37] has had a name change a man that has met
[11:40] Melchizedek a man that has had a body
[11:42] change and Abraham journeyed from thence
[11:45] toward the south country and dwelt
[11:48] between Kadesh and Shur and sinned in
[11:52] career and Abram Abraham said of as' of
[11:55] Sarah his wife she is my sister and
[11:59] Abimelech king of Greer sent and took
[12:01] Sarah but God came to Abimelech in a
[12:05] dream by night and said to him behold
[12:07] thou art but a dead man for the woman
[12:10] which thou has taken for she is a man's
[12:13] wife but a bimolecular and he said Lord
[12:18] wilt thou slay also a righteous nation
[12:21] said he not unto me she is my sister and
[12:24] she even she herself said he is my
[12:28] brother in the integrity of my heart and
[12:31] the NSE of my hands have I done this and
[12:33] God said unto Him in a dream yea I know
[12:36] that thou did is this in the integrity
[12:40] of thine heart for I also with healthy
[12:43] from sinning against me therefore
[12:46] suffered ah thee not to touch her now
[12:49] therefore restore the man his wife for
[12:53] he is a prophet and he shall pray for
[12:55] thee and thou shalt live and if thou
[12:58] shalt restore her not thou that thou
[13:02] that thou know that thou shalt surely
[13:05] die
[13:06] now and all that are thine a man may God
[13:11] bless his word he may be seated in the
[13:14] presence of the Lord I'd like to read a
[13:20] portion of the thoughts are in church
[13:23] aging and here the Prophet is here the
[13:28] Prophet I've asked your brothers to put
[13:30] the quote up for us this evening here
[13:33] the Prophet is dealing with
[13:35] with the churches the the two churches
[13:37] and we know that there's always been
[13:40] twins of every revival that there's been
[13:42] that there was Cain and Abel and there
[13:45] was Esau and Jacob and and Judas and
[13:48] Jesus and even now the Holy Spirit and
[13:50] the Antichrist and the the false church
[13:54] and the true church but here the Prophet
[13:56] is asking the question of what churches
[14:00] will be those that that do not know this
[14:02] truth and we know of course that it is
[14:05] the false vine because the believer
[14:08] certainly know who they are and they
[14:11] know they know where their life comes
[14:13] from and here we pick it up it says now
[14:16] why does God call these churches his
[14:19] churches even though they are the false
[14:23] vine the truth of the matter is that
[14:25] they are Christians but they are not
[14:29] Christians of the Spirit they are
[14:31] Christians of the flesh they are bearing
[14:34] the name in vain
[14:35] mark seven and seven says howbeit in
[14:38] vain do they worship Me teaching for
[14:40] doctrines the commandments of men but
[14:43] indeed they are Christians for what else
[14:45] could they be a is a
[14:48] this that is his religion and
[14:51] no matter how he lives it because he
[14:53] subscribes in theory to what the Quran
[14:55] teaches in the same way a Christian is a
[14:59] christian as long as he subscribes to
[15:01] the fact that Jesus is the Son of God
[15:04] born of a virgin was crucified and died
[15:07] and rose again that he is the savior of
[15:09] mankind etcetera in fact in the
[15:12] Laodicean age there will be those who
[15:15] call themselves Christians because they
[15:18] subscribe to the fine qualities of Jesus
[15:20] while reserving to themselves the right
[15:23] to deny his deity Christian scientists
[15:26] have done that already as well as
[15:29] multitudes who preached a social gospel
[15:31] he is a nominal Christian and belongs to
[15:34] the church notice but he is not a true
[15:37] or spiritual believer that kind of a
[15:40] believer is one who has been baptized
[15:43] into the body
[15:44] of Christ and is a member of him we
[15:48] recognize to be a Christian is to be
[15:51] christ-like have the mind of Christ to
[15:54] have the life of Christ you see there
[15:56] are many people that call themselves
[15:58] Christians but if there's no life there
[16:00] to back up what they say then it's just
[16:03] words of utterance of what they are
[16:05] subscribing themselves to or what they
[16:08] have what they have made an attendance
[16:10] to but you see this is not about this is
[16:13] not about just knowing just knowing that
[16:16] Jesus was the son of God but this is
[16:18] about the life of God living in a people
[16:23] living in a people that was called by
[16:26] his namesake tonight I like to speak to
[16:29] you on a thought that was birthed last
[16:31] weekend in us in our sermon that we are
[16:34] breaching on anointed to fly higher I
[16:36] like to speak to you this thought on
[16:39] this is where I belong
[16:41] this is where I belong and truly we live
[16:45] in a world that is a place where we
[16:47] don't fit in we don't fit in here we're
[16:51] not in with the who's who we're not in
[16:54] with the in-crowd of the day when the
[16:56] world has their parties were not invited
[16:58] when the world has their social events
[17:01] were not invited because we know they
[17:03] know what we stand for you we don't fit
[17:07] in with their cliques and we don't fit
[17:08] in with their crowds
[17:10] you see I don't belong to this world and
[17:12] neither does this world attached itself
[17:14] to me you see neither do we belong to
[17:18] the Laodicean Church you see this flyer
[17:21] this revival that we have the Laodicean
[17:24] Church didn't give it to us
[17:26] the Laodicean Church is cold and formal
[17:29] they don't they they don't know what
[17:31] they believe in there they're lukewarm
[17:33] they they're neither cold nor hot this
[17:36] world this world knows nothing of what
[17:38] we live in this day they do not
[17:41] understand the power that that you are
[17:43] packing in your mortal being tonight the
[17:47] world don't understand it we don't fit
[17:49] in with this world we don't belong to
[17:51] the world we don't belong to the world
[17:54] but we do
[17:55] long to a living God we do belong to the
[17:58] kingdom of peace we do belong to the
[18:00] kingdom of righteousness to a kingdom of
[18:03] purity and holiness that's the kingdom
[18:05] that we belong to we belong to a
[18:08] headship in that headship is Christ our
[18:10] headship is not in Rome our headship
[18:13] he's in glory are you with me
[18:17] hello somebody will I die when I die
[18:20] what you know I'm not going I'm not
[18:22] going to be buried over in some Catholic
[18:25] in some Catholic ma mosque or some
[18:28] Catholic place but when I die I'm going
[18:31] to my headship I'm going to where I
[18:34] belong are you with me tonight as
[18:37] Christians we've already got to
[18:39] ourselves
[18:40] we've already died too I think it we've
[18:42] already died for who we are we have
[18:44] mortified the deeds of the flesh
[18:46] we've already died after that thinking
[18:49] that's what I was speaking to sister
[18:50] Sarah and the family there we don't have
[18:53] to worry about a Christian that is going
[18:55] on the other side we have to worry about
[18:57] them or what their state is going to be
[18:59] we know that that there if this earthly
[19:02] tabernacle beat us off that we have one
[19:05] imperfection waiting on us are you with
[19:09] me this message will produce the life of
[19:14] Christ because it is Christ this message
[19:16] this message is not a book this message
[19:19] is not a picture this message is not a
[19:22] prophet this message is a person and
[19:24] that person is Christ Jesus and I
[19:27] believe that we're standing here in this
[19:29] moment as a witness that his presence
[19:32] has changed us I believe that's why we
[19:35] don't have to worry about calling you up
[19:37] on Saturday and Sunday are you going to
[19:40] be a church this weekend or have to have
[19:42] some kind of social event to get you
[19:44] here it's because this message has to
[19:47] the work in your life this presence has
[19:49] changed you this presence makes you live
[19:52] right this presence make you make you
[19:54] talk right it makes you dress right i
[19:56] and now I want you to raise your hand
[19:59] this evening if if I personally called
[20:01] you and told you how to dress before you
[20:03] came to the service
[20:04] there's no hands up I personally didn't
[20:07] call you and tell you that that you need
[20:09] that that you needed to do this or you
[20:11] knew do that you do this because of what
[20:14] because this word says so and I never
[20:17] called you of the pastor never called
[20:19] you and said now look we're gonna wear
[20:20] our skirts as long sisters and we don't
[20:23] cut our hand we don't put ear bobs in
[20:25] our ears and we don't paint herself up
[20:26] like Jezebel we don't do those things
[20:28] there's not there's not one pastor but
[20:31] the Homer Butler on a brother answer
[20:33] never called you up and told you and
[20:35] said this is how we're going to do
[20:36] things but we have simply preached this
[20:39] gospel and this gospel has produced what
[20:43] you are seeing before you tonight this
[20:45] message produces life are you with me
[20:50] this evening this message produces life
[20:54] turn a neighbor said this message
[20:57] produces life the first time brother
[21:01] Murphy wall and his wife came into the -
[21:03] it may have been the second time for the
[21:05] Murphy came into service but the first
[21:07] time his wife sister Tracy came into the
[21:10] presence and came to church for the very
[21:13] first time she sent there she sat there
[21:16] in in her worldly garb as she sent there
[21:20] she sat there and had makeup on her face
[21:22] and had earrings in her ears and brother
[21:24] Murphy where they were sitting through
[21:25] the service there and they were sitting
[21:28] through the service and and sister Tracy
[21:31] got up and left the service for a little
[21:33] bit but the Murphy thought that maybe
[21:35] she was mad or for some reason because
[21:37] of the preaching of the word and when
[21:39] she came back in when she came back in
[21:42] she had the ear bobs out of her ears and
[21:44] she had the makeup washed off of her
[21:46] face now the amazing thing about this is
[21:49] sister Tracy did not know one word of
[21:52] English what was it it was the presence
[21:57] of Almighty God that changed that sister
[22:01] she recognized that she wanted to be
[22:04] clean in his presence it was his
[22:07] presence that was heaven to sister Tracy
[22:10] the reason why preach to you tonight is
[22:14] big
[22:14] his presence is happened to me the
[22:16] reason I dance like I do sing like I do
[22:20] is because his presence has changed me
[22:24] hallelujah you see as we were speaking
[22:29] last weekend of that Eagle you see that
[22:32] eagle did not belong on the ground with
[22:35] the chickens but he belongs in a place
[22:37] that was designed for him to live in you
[22:41] see the chicken is an Earthbound bird
[22:43] because it was designed to live in that
[22:47] kind of condition he belongs there he
[22:50] was born and built for the place in
[22:53] which he was going to be placed in and
[22:56] the eagle he was built for the place
[23:00] that he belonged the eagle was built to
[23:03] soar the eagle was built to fly above
[23:05] every other bird he was built for the
[23:11] place that was designed for him you are
[23:16] built for this you were built for this
[23:19] message but before you ever got here
[23:21] there was a message oh my before you
[23:29] ever got here this message was already
[23:31] here for you before you ever arrived
[23:34] there was a promise now that you are
[23:37] built for the promise and you're just
[23:39] living out what the promise has said
[23:41] about now the Bible says in Deuteronomy
[23:45] 29 and 29 that the secret things belong
[23:50] unto the Lord our God but those things
[23:52] which are revealed belonging to us and
[23:55] our children forever that we may do all
[23:58] the words of this law notice that's the
[24:03] hidden that the head in place that's the
[24:06] place where we've got to come to me
[24:08] that's the place where God reveals his
[24:11] secret is in the hidden place that's the
[24:14] place where God does the placing and
[24:16] calling is in that hidden secret moment
[24:19] in that head in place which is Christ
[24:21] Jesus it's in that spot in which he
[24:25] reveals himself
[24:26] you know I find amongst people many
[24:29] times as people are going through life
[24:31] that that people they're looking and
[24:33] they're searching for their calling
[24:35] they're searching for their purpose
[24:37] they're searching of what they're going
[24:40] to do in life I truly do not believe
[24:42] that a person goes through life desiring
[24:46] to run aimlessly through life but I
[24:49] believe that a person I believe that a
[24:52] person desires to to have to to be
[24:57] something in life to do something in
[24:59] life I believe that people that have
[25:02] ambition will do something in life but
[25:05] there is the occasion of a bum every
[25:07] once in a while that has no ambition
[25:09] that they have no they have no
[25:12] leadership they just they just go from
[25:14] here or there they they have no ambition
[25:17] they have no power to control them but I
[25:19] believe as sons and daughters of God
[25:21] that it is our ambition to do for the
[25:24] kingdom of God I believe it is I
[25:26] ambition to be about the Father's
[25:28] business I believe that it is our desire
[25:31] that we not run aimlessly here and there
[25:34] carried about with every wind of
[25:35] doctrine but we stand upon the solid
[25:38] basis of God's Word but I believe it's
[25:45] the desire of sons and daughters of God
[25:47] to find that place that God intended us
[25:49] to be at a place where we belong you
[25:54] know I have you find it amongst amongst
[25:56] the Christendom of today that they want
[25:59] to belong to something they want to
[26:01] belong to a group or they want to belong
[26:03] to a denomination or Association they
[26:06] want to belong to something they want to
[26:10] belong but I want you to know that that
[26:12] Israel never had a World Council of
[26:14] Churches Israel never had a UN or never
[26:18] had a League of Nations because you see
[26:21] they didn't need a Council they were
[26:23] standing upon thus saith the Lord and as
[26:26] the Church of the Living God we don't
[26:29] need a world council of churches we
[26:31] don't need a League of Nations we don't
[26:33] need a Council I cancel its that saith
[26:36] the Lord our head shippers are thinking
[26:41] hallelujah but I believe that we as sons
[26:45] and daughters of God should find that
[26:47] ambition and find our purpose in life
[26:49] and run with everything that's within us
[26:52] we should lay aside every weight and see
[26:55] this is more about talking to you about
[26:58] a purpose of you finding that purpose
[27:00] and you going out and living out that
[27:02] purpose and in a natural realm but this
[27:04] is you finding your purpose in the
[27:06] kingdom of heaven finding where you
[27:09] belong if your job is to sing you sing
[27:12] if your job is just to clap maybe you
[27:15] clap offbeat
[27:16] you clap with everything that's within
[27:18] you you find that place in which you
[27:20] belong and you stay there I was telling
[27:24] the young people last week of I believe
[27:26] it was last week I was telling them
[27:28] about when there when one thing that dad
[27:30] had taught me in business is when you
[27:33] find the channel in which God blesses
[27:35] you you stay in that channel you stay in
[27:38] that channel you don't move to somebody
[27:40] else's position or move to somebody else
[27:42] or try to be like somebody else you stay
[27:44] where God's blessing you at you see
[27:48] David got in trouble when he started to
[27:51] do something that was not in his
[27:52] position and every time that you move
[27:55] into a spot that you are not called to
[27:58] do God cannot bless you when you're not
[28:01] in that Channel
[28:02] I read a statement yesterday that none
[28:08] of us can do everything but all of us
[28:11] can do something
[28:14] it may be just one little one little
[28:17] thing but let us do if all that's within
[28:19] us when God starts to work god finishes
[28:24] our work this message don't prop you up
[28:28] this message doesn't just keep your flow
[28:31] this message makes you live right before
[28:37] you ever got here when you was trying to
[28:40] figure out your purpose before you momma
[28:42] and daddy ever tried or thought of you
[28:44] before you was ever born God
[28:46] predetermined your are you coming here
[28:49] he determined predetermined your
[28:52] calling and your election and he
[28:54] returned predetermined your path and
[28:57] he's determined to see you did to it and
[29:00] we're elected to live it out the Bible
[29:04] says in Psalms 32 and 8 that I will
[29:07] instruct thee and teach thee in the way
[29:09] which thou shalt go and I will guide
[29:11] thee with my knife we're not depending
[29:16] on our own sight for a Christian don't
[29:20] live by side a Christian lives by faith
[29:22] we're not depending upon our side but he
[29:25] said that he'd be our sight that he'd be
[29:27] our God and we're not looking through
[29:29] the eyes of our own sight we're looking
[29:31] through the eyes of faith through the
[29:32] eyes of an eagle and that that eye sees
[29:36] all the way out it's already seen you in
[29:40] victory hallelujah
[29:45] this word belong it means to be the
[29:48] property of of a person or a thing to be
[29:52] attached or bound by the youth or a
[29:55] skirt excuse me to be bound by birth an
[29:58] allegiance or dependency to be a member
[30:01] of a club or an organization or set to
[30:04] be an attribute a part of be a part of
[30:08] belonging to I belong to the Spencer
[30:14] family because I was born in the Spencer
[30:16] family I have the attributes of a
[30:20] Spencer because of my birth you see I'm
[30:23] bound to the Spencer family because of
[30:26] my birth I belong to it you see you'll
[30:29] see I never worried about if I was
[30:32] adopted or not
[30:33] I never went around ask your mama why do
[30:36] I look this way I look at the pictures
[30:39] on the wall and I can see why I look
[30:41] that way there's attributes in my father
[30:45] and in my mother in which it's displayed
[30:48] in my own human vessel I know that I
[30:51] came from the Spencer lineage and you
[30:54] know I belong to that Switzer family I'm
[30:56] bill to them by birth
[30:58] no matter if I get in a car act no
[31:00] matter the state I'm in no matter if I
[31:02] get mangled in a car wreck or no matter
[31:04] if I get tore up I'm still a Switzer no
[31:08] matter my state of mind I'm still a
[31:10] Spencer no matter how dark things get in
[31:14] my life I'm still a Spencer no matter
[31:17] the time or I go through in life I'm
[31:19] still a Spencer do you hear me preaching
[31:23] to you tonight no matter what you go
[31:25] through you are always a son the Bible
[31:29] says in Ephesians 2 in 19 therefore we
[31:33] are no more strangers and foreigners but
[31:35] fellow-citizens with the Saints and of
[31:37] the household of God that's where you
[31:39] belong and are built upon the foundation
[31:42] of the apostles and prophets Jesus
[31:44] Christ Himself being the chief
[31:46] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[31:49] fitly framed together groweth unto a
[31:53] holy temple in the Lord in whom he also
[31:56] are builded together for a habitation of
[31:58] God through the spirit as American
[32:02] citizens we stand here and we're
[32:05] identified on every level as an American
[32:08] and all of his same in all of his glory
[32:12] when he wins the battle when it loses
[32:15] the battle we're Americans
[32:16] I'm proud to be an American there's no
[32:19] other place on earth that I'd rather
[32:20] live but in America the reason why we
[32:24] have the ability to worship tonight in
[32:26] our freedom like we do is because of
[32:29] America fighting for our rights of
[32:31] freedom of worship I stand as an
[32:35] American tonight there's some times that
[32:37] maybe we get ashamed of it but I'm
[32:39] identified with it I belong to it are
[32:43] you with me we are citizens of another
[32:45] Kingdom we are citizens of the kingdom
[32:48] of God
[32:49] and we wave our nations flag very high
[32:54] Jehovah is our bear I'm not ashamed to
[32:59] waive that American flag anywhere in
[33:01] this world and I'm not ashamed to wave
[33:04] this Holy Ghost wherever I go
[33:07] jehovah is my banner jehovah is my peace
[33:10] jehovah is my righteousness jehovah is
[33:13] my buckler jehovah is my shield
[33:16] i belong to him
[33:20] hallelujah you see when i took my wife
[33:24] and when my wife took on my name as a
[33:26] spencer you see there's no disrespect to
[33:29] the Morgan family or any person that is
[33:32] any woman that is taking on their
[33:34] husband's name but she as a Morgan went
[33:38] to a higher level not because he was
[33:41] taken on the Spitzer name per se but she
[33:43] was becoming United with a headship she
[33:48] was becoming United with a person that
[33:51] has swore to protect her a person that
[33:54] would provide for her a person that was
[33:57] sustained for her a person that would be
[33:59] her head it brought her to another level
[34:04] when she took that step up on the stage
[34:07] she was identifying that she wanted to
[34:11] be one with me and when you took that
[34:15] step by the invisible union of God you
[34:18] are identified with him you may have
[34:22] been awakened maybe 10 years or 20 years
[34:24] ago but you are identified with him
[34:27] before there ever was a molecule or an
[34:30] atom spoken to existence come on
[34:33] somebody you are in God's mind before
[34:36] the world began whoo hallelujah when you
[34:40] look down at the dirt and you look at
[34:42] the dirt and you bow your head sometimes
[34:45] and you just get down because of the
[34:48] troubles of life
[34:49] you remember that God thought of you
[34:51] before the dirt was ever here Valerie
[35:00] but she became connected to a headship
[35:04] and Jesus said that if ye abide in me
[35:07] and my words about and you ask what you
[35:10] will and it shall be done to you
[35:13] we were people that was cut off as
[35:15] Gentiles we were people that the Jews
[35:18] thought was unredeemable
[35:21] but God rich in mercy where if he loved
[35:26] us he placed us in our position when we
[35:32] would be he quickened us he loved us and
[35:37] he placed us we were always such
[35:46] Alleluia we did not become see we were
[35:49] see therefore we could be reborn
[35:55] hallelujah before before I ever got here
[35:59] as the Spencer's Andrew Spitzer I was
[36:01] running up and down my father's back
[36:04] boat I was there
[36:08] but God seen me God seen that dogged
[36:13] that Connie Spencer would give birth to
[36:15] her ugly looking redheaded boy on
[36:18] September 1st of 1987
[36:21] it wasn't no surprise it wasn't no
[36:24] surprise to God that I was gonna be born
[36:26] ugly he saw me in that condition if they
[36:30] got making a joke of that but God seen
[36:32] you in your ugliness I've seen you in
[36:35] your sin God seen you in your despair
[36:38] that's why before the world began
[36:41] he laid he slayed a slam and lamb slain
[36:45] for your found eight before the
[36:46] foundation of the world
[36:48] there was a lamb slain for you you and
[36:53] him are connected from eternity to
[36:55] eternity that's where I belong
[37:01] if the Eagle belongs in the sky and not
[37:05] on the ground with the chickens you as
[37:07] sons and daughters of God you do not
[37:09] belong on the earth you don't belong
[37:13] walking around here with your head hung
[37:15] down do you know who you are
[37:22] but you woke up this past week on Monday
[37:25] after the revival that we had last week
[37:27] and all of a sudden your self-confidence
[37:30] was just a little bit lower because
[37:34] somebody said something to you on your
[37:36] job you didn't feel quite as high that
[37:40] you were flying here on Sunday night as
[37:42] you did on Monday morning I know I know
[37:48] that I'm talking to a few angels but I'd
[37:50] say that there's some of you that went
[37:52] into work and somebody brought you from
[37:54] heavenly places back down to Laodicea
[37:58] and it brought your self-esteem down but
[38:01] this word is not about building up your
[38:03] self-esteem this word is not building up
[38:06] of how you feel around other people
[38:09] this word is building you to be a
[38:11] tabernacle for Almighty God and no
[38:14] matter if you feel up right now and if
[38:16] you feel down tomorrow you are still
[38:19] connected to him food trousers and many
[38:22] toys and temptations you still belong to
[38:26] him through cancer your wrist through
[38:31] diabetes your hair through the struggle
[38:33] your heels hallelujah you always was a
[38:38] son you see he burst us into our
[38:41] position and we are heir to all that he
[38:44] owns the Prophet would say that we
[38:48] belong to one body or another body
[38:50] he's the body of God or the body of
[38:52] Satan one of them you've joined to and
[38:56] the other one you'd be like that you're
[38:58] born into one of them you're a part of
[39:01] because you're born into it you have to
[39:03] be a part of it could I deny that I got
[39:06] an arm no more than I can deny any word
[39:08] of God if I'm a part of God I'm a part
[39:12] of William Branham I'm in parts and
[39:14] every part is a part of me is that right

[39:19] your momma caught you with your hand in
[39:21] the cookie jar
[39:23] and you'd always tell mom I said mom it
[39:24] wasn't me it was my hand and made me do
[39:27] it I'm the only kid in here I guess I
[39:33] got caught in the cookie jar but you
[39:36] know you can't separate your hand from
[39:38] the rest of your body you see if your
[39:41] hand did it you did rather Baron would
[39:45] ask a question who is me really who is
[39:48] me is this is this body me
[39:50] it's his vessel me but there's something
[39:53] on the inside of you that's making you
[39:55] tick and making you up that Satan cannot
[39:59] destroy he might come and torment your
[40:04] flesh and torment your mind but he can
[40:07] never get to that real you Oh hallelujah

[44:42] to God Oh hallelujah
[44:47] I don't preach this message because I'm
[44:50] a part of the Frazier family I don't
[44:52] preach this message because there's
[44:53] eight eight different eight different
[44:56] preachers in my lineage of the Spencer
[44:58] family I preach this message because I
[45:04] was born to preach this message I live
[45:07] this message not because the wife I
[45:09] marry are the people I'm connected to I

[45:15] living its way out of me
[45:17] [Applause]
[45:26] we're not relying upon what we think
[45:29] we're not relying upon how we feel we're
[45:32] relying upon God's worth and if it looks
[45:36] like it ain't coming and if it looks
[45:38] like it ain't gonna happen
[45:39] hold on hold on faith says it's coming
[45:44] too fast surpass faith says it's going
[45:47] to happen and if that's your if that's
[45:54] your speech and if that's your thinking
[45:56] you could say this is where I belong
[45:58] when everybody else is criticizing me
[46:01] for believing yes this is where I belong
[46:03] at I'd say that Abraham and Sarah were
[46:08] criticized for believing that they were
[46:10] going to have a son help me preach right
[46:13] here I'd say that they were criticized
[46:16] by all kinds of people saying there
[46:18] you're gonna be the father of Nations
[46:20] and you don't even have you only have a
[46:22] son but Abraham could stand there and
[46:25] say this is where I belong that I don't
[46:28] belong in town I don't belong in recent
[46:35] Eve lived in a perfect spot lived in a
[46:42] place of perfection a place in which she
[46:46] belong that but reason took her out of
[46:49] that spot the place in which she
[46:52] belonged to reason came and stole her
[46:55] away and the same enemy today he's
[46:58] raising up his head of Reese and trying
[47:01] to reason its way out make its way so
[47:04] that you got to figure all these things
[47:06] out but you don't belong in reason you
[47:12] are not birthed by reason I'm preaching
[47:14] to the body of Christ you don't belong
[47:17] in recently you were not birthed by
[47:19] recent you were not birthed by doubt you
[47:22] were not birthed by fear you were not
[47:26] burst by your stigma you are not birthed
[47:29] by your complex
[47:31] you are not burst by suicide you are
[47:34] birthed by faith this is where I belong
[47:40] that Abraham would say you see God can
[47:45] only bless Israel when she's in her
[47:47] homeland every time she got out of her
[47:50] homeland she got in trouble and when you
[47:53] get out on Satan's territory God can't
[47:55] bless you you don't belong in doubt you
[47:59] don't belong in fear you don't belong in
[48:01] all these things of the world
[48:02] you belong in thus saith the Lord God
[48:06] can't bless you when you're out there
[48:08] having a party with the rest of the
[48:09] world jesus said that you cannot serve
[48:12] God and Mammon at the same time God
[48:15] can't bless you the I can't bless you
[48:17] while you're dancing in the spirit and
[48:19] drinking line at the same time God can't
[48:23] bless you while you're looking at things
[48:24] on the internet that you shouldn't be
[48:26] looking at when you're trying to get the
[48:28] Holy Ghost
[48:30] i'ma preach to you anyhow God can't
[48:33] bless you when you're dabbling in drugs
[48:36] and alcohol when you're asking for an
[48:39] anointing that'll make you fly high but
[48:42] God will bless you when you stand upon
[48:45] thus saith the word that's where God
[48:50] will bless you that's we're gonna fill
[48:52] you that's where God will change you on
[48:55] the word hallelujah hallelujah this word
[49:08] this word lips little bottom said that
[49:12] this word produces itself that's
[49:16] beautiful right there
[49:18] this word produces itself it'll produce
[49:21] the same kind of life it'll produce the
[49:24] same nature that that the lamb had you
[49:28] see a pig's nature will produce a big
[49:31] life and when people live like dogs
[49:37] it'll produce a dog life you see they're
[49:41] attached
[49:41] - those things by a birth by the life
[49:46] they're living it shows you where
[49:48] they're born from Ali let me move on for
[49:58] somebody strings me up this is where I
[50:04] belong at church see God had told
[50:07] Abraham in Genesis chapter 14 to lift up
[50:11] your eyes after he had separated himself
[50:13] from light he says lift up your eyes and
[50:16] look northward and southward and
[50:17] eastward look all the way around you
[50:20] look where you're standing that walk
[50:22] through this land I've given you this
[50:25] land it belongs to you
[50:27] it's your possession it's your property
[50:30] you were barred to inhabit it and that's
[50:34] where the angel of God met Abraham was
[50:37] in that land that's the place where
[50:41] Abraham was chose to live he was not
[50:44] chose to live down in Egypt or down in
[50:46] career he was chose to live in that land
[50:49] and when he got outside of the promised
[50:52] land he got in trouble you watch every
[50:56] time that the children of Israel got out
[50:58] of their homeland they get in trouble
[51:00] and notice Abraham as he falls in this
[51:04] condition as we would say it's a
[51:06] backslidden condition that notice that
[51:08] it even channels down to Isaac doing the
[51:12] same exact thing you see because there
[51:16] was no birth to fix the process the
[51:20] anointing would come and the anointing
[51:22] would go but we're not like the prophets
[51:25] of old have to worry about if we got the
[51:27] anointing a day or worried about our
[51:29] temper racing back up the anointing of
[51:31] odds the anointing stays the anointing
[51:35] anoint the anointing lives but he said
[51:40] I've given you this land this is your
[51:42] land and your seed that come after you
[51:45] this is where you belong at Abraham but
[51:49] as we read in our scripture reading
[51:50] Genesis 20 that we see as Sarah is
[51:55] taken by a Abimelech notice that
[51:58] Abimelech is less than after a 90 year
[52:01] old woman he no notice notice he is he
[52:08] is lusting after a grandma Oh hallelujah
[52:14] notice they have just journeyed over 300
[52:17] miles to get to career
[52:19] could you imagine a little bit of
[52:21] Grandma taking a few steps here and
[52:23] there making a 300 mile journey but
[52:26] something had to happen some had to
[52:31] happen which was a type of you and me
[52:33] something had to happen that was a
[52:35] change after Melchizedek came I couldn't
[52:41] live this until he came Abraham couldn't
[52:46] change until Melchizedek came hallelujah
[52:51] Abraham was living on the outside of the
[52:53] tent until message that came but after
[52:59] he came oh she wasn't stepping like no
[53:06] grandma she was stepping like a 20 year
[53:09] old woman making a 300 mile journey and
[53:12] when she gets down to career there is a
[53:15] young for listening king that says I
[53:18] want this woman to be my wife are you
[53:24] following me this evening
[53:26] now notice so Abbey molesting her to be
[53:31] his wife and Abimelech so he was already
[53:34] now to be to take her to be his wife but
[53:39] notice what God had said to Abraham that
[53:42] by Sarah you're going to have this baby
[53:45] and he was a young man taking her and
[53:49] here was Abraham a hundred years old out
[53:52] there you see the promised son was
[53:55] promised to Abraham and Sarah he was not
[53:58] promised to Abraham and Hagar he was not
[54:00] promised to Sarah and Abimelech he was
[54:03] promised to Abraham and Sarah
[54:06] and God came and dealt with a
[54:08] bimolecular dream and said you're
[54:10] nothing but a dead man don't touch what
[54:15] was God saying this that this is my
[54:18] battle I have birthed her to bring for
[54:22] the promise come on somebody and when
[54:28] Sara laughed up her sleeve and says me
[54:33] another woman had pleasure give of my
[54:35] Lord God had every right to destroy Sara
[54:40] but because she was a part of Abraham
[54:43] because she was a part of the promise
[54:46] God could not destroy her there have
[54:49] been things in your life that would
[54:51] rightfully put you in the prison house
[54:54] there are things in your life that would
[54:56] properly say that you should be
[54:58] destroyed but because you are part of
[55:00] him because you belong to him and he
[55:04] built you to be a birthing ground for
[55:08] the Son of Man to come forth he could
[55:11] not destroy you hallelujah
[55:16] but notice notice what God said to
[55:21] Abimelech he says I know the integrity
[55:24] of your heart that's the reason I kept
[55:26] you from sinning against me
[55:29] but you restore you restore that woman
[55:34] for her husband is a prophet let him
[55:38] pray for you if you don't I'm just gonna
[55:40] wipe you off the face of the earth God's
[55:43] Word has to stand no man could touch
[55:48] Sarah God had made a promise you see god
[55:53] when this took place God set up all the
[55:56] rooms of every woman in the kingdom the
[56:00] kingdom the nation would have died right
[56:04] off if there would have been no
[56:07] restoration of Sarah
[56:16] no man could touch I want you to realize
[56:20] I want you to realize that the kingdoms
[56:23] of this world would completely shut down
[56:26] if Satan wouldn't take his hand off for
[56:28] you Satan has to take his hand off of
[56:32] God's property or the nations would shut
[56:36] down if Satan wouldn't do it
[56:38] do you realize who you are this evening
[56:41] that America would shut down that
[56:44] Germany would shut down that rest would
[56:46] shut down that gorilla would have shut
[56:49] down if the King would have not had
[56:51] restored Sarah back to her position of
[56:54] being Abraham's wife Satan has no legal
[56:59] right to lay his hands upon you he has
[57:02] no legal right to destroy your vessel he
[57:05] has no legal right but you as a son of
[57:08] God have the ability to enforce her
[57:11] claim and say Satan take your dirty
[57:15] hands off for God's property I belong to
[57:18] God I don't belong to cancer I don't
[57:22] belong to TB I belong to the God that
[57:24] heals all of my diseases I belong to the
[57:27] God that made me who I am he said take
[57:34] your hands off of her and here come the
[57:37] natural seed the natural seed had to
[57:38] come if it would have itself would have
[57:41] married that southern man the natural
[57:43] seed would have never been born
[57:45] so if God's uh protected the course for
[57:49] the natural seed how much more for the
[57:51] spiritual royal seed has he protected
[57:55] God would not allow a perverted seed to
[58:00] contain a maintainer womb that womb was
[58:08] built for the seed of Abraham and God
[58:12] would not allow the contamination of
[58:14] another seed to enter that room Satan
[58:19] has tried his very best to pervert your
[58:21] womb of your soul
[58:23] and to contaminate your mind and
[58:25] contaminate your spirit but you have
[58:27] every legal right to say Satan take your
[58:30] hands off of God's property Satan give
[58:38] them back
[58:38] turn them loose you realize who you are
[58:48] Satan give them back turn them loose
[58:52] you're not going to smother them out
[58:54] there and organizations and things there
[58:58] are free people you let them alone turn
[59:01] them loose I want you to notice this
[59:09] this is where you belong at since it
[59:19] took a few years to get here but you
[59:22] belong here
[59:24] it didn't look like it was a live
[59:26] ministry in your area but you belong
[59:28] here all this time you belong here it
[59:37] looked like you were an outcast but you
[59:39] belong here
[59:40] it looked like he didn't fit in but you
[59:43] belong here he didn't look like your
[59:46] feathers look like all the other
[59:47] feathers of the world you belong here
[59:53] when you started coming in brother
[59:55] Steven when brother Steven came in here
[59:58] and he started saying he came in here
[1:00:00] and he told me he told me from his lips
[1:00:02] he said I made a declaration then I was
[1:00:07] going to go to all the churches in the
[1:00:09] community and I was going to find which
[1:00:10] one had truth he said but when I came
[1:00:12] here when I came here he said this this
[1:00:16] is what he told me he said this is where
[1:00:18] I belong
[1:00:22] I know what the religions of the world
[1:00:33] have to offer I know that the god of the
[1:00:35] world has to offer he's got nothing
[1:00:37] he's got nothing but death he can offer
[1:00:41] your life he can offer you hope he can't
[1:00:43] offer you peace he can out for your
[1:00:45] happiness he can only offer you you can
[1:00:49] he can only offer you in the sight of an
[1:00:52] empty bar but the God that I'm serving
[1:00:58] can offer you peace the God that I'm
[1:01:01] serving can offer you happiness you
[1:01:09] belong right here in this birthing
[1:01:12] ground who belong right here in this in
[1:01:15] this place that was the door ordained
[1:01:17] for you that you belong to that you are
[1:01:21] chosen of Satan Estrada's very best to
[1:01:28] destroy our lives and I'm going just a
[1:01:34] little bit slower just for a moment just
[1:01:36] so you get this Satan has done is very
[1:01:41] best to destroy you and destroy your
[1:01:44] life and to destroy your integrity and
[1:01:48] destroy who you are and tell you that
[1:01:51] you're worthless but this word has come
[1:01:56] to tell you that this is the place that
[1:01:58] you've been longer I'm not talking about
[1:02:02] the physical address of this church but
[1:02:04] I'm talking about this revealed word I'm
[1:02:07] talking about I'm talking about a God
[1:02:10] that can raise you out of your condition
[1:02:16] this God can go careful now he can go to
[1:02:23] to the street rats and he can go to the
[1:02:27] alley rats and he can go to the
[1:02:29] prostitutes of the world and he is
[1:02:31] compelling them to come he's going to
[1:02:35] those that look that look like they're
[1:02:38] unredeemable he looks he's going after
[1:02:41] those that that look like there is no
[1:02:44] hope for them to come he's going after
[1:02:46] our lost loved ones careful what you
[1:02:51] think right there he's going after them
[1:02:53] with everything that's within it this is
[1:02:57] a God that doesn't lose his seed this is
[1:02:59] a God that brings his seed to the ground
[1:03:01] in which it belongs him you could not
[1:03:07] come forth you could not come forth in
[1:03:10] your beauty out there in here in the
[1:03:13] ground of the world you could not show
[1:03:17] forth your potential out there in the
[1:03:19] world you could not do it out there in
[1:03:23] the world but when God brought you to
[1:03:25] this ground when God brought you to this
[1:03:27] place and began to harass doing there so
[1:03:31] and begin to rise on that seed it
[1:03:33] brought forth everything that was laying
[1:03:36] on the inside of you the potentials that
[1:03:39] was laying on the inside of you birthed
[1:03:41] you into this kingdom Satan tried is
[1:03:44] very best to cover you up with all types
[1:03:47] of dirt with all types of sin all types
[1:03:50] of unbelief you were not born for the
[1:03:55] world you are not born for that ground
[1:03:57] you were born for this holy ground you
[1:04:02] are born for this what God knows the
[1:04:07] ground in which he or danger to be you
[1:04:15] could not produce this life out there
[1:04:19] you could not produce his life out there
[1:04:22] home but once you got transplanted
[1:04:25] Hinda this seed were into this seed
[1:04:28] ground into this ground in which God or
[1:04:31] danger to be you were born to be an
[1:04:37] eagle you were born to fly higher every
[1:04:43] time the world every time you begin to
[1:04:46] get closer to God
[1:04:48] the world kept whispering in your ear
[1:04:50] but I can offer you this and I can offer
[1:04:52] you that but this is where you belong
[1:04:59] every time you begin to make a move for
[1:05:01] God Satan kept raising his head I said
[1:05:04] but you can't do that do you remember
[1:05:07] what you did you fell in sin you made a
[1:05:12] fool of yourself you fail and there's no
[1:05:18] way to get back up it looks like it
[1:05:34] looked like all hope was gone but the
[1:05:40] Bible said that he established my goings
[1:05:43] and he set my foot up on a rock it
[1:05:53] looked as if you would never come but
[1:05:58] through all the mud through all the
[1:06:04] scars through all the pain through all
[1:06:15] the despair through every struggle
[1:06:20] something kept bringing you up something
[1:06:26] kept bringing you up this is where you
[1:06:35] belong
[1:06:39] life is about living life is about
[1:06:45] living life is not about dying the world
[1:06:51] all they have to offer you is death this
[1:07:00] is about living what the Pentecostal
[1:07:06] realm turned down what the Pentecostal
[1:07:13] round turned down and poured its way
[1:07:17] back from it was protecting you all this
[1:07:23] time hallelujah
[1:07:29] you always wore a seat he told you that
[1:07:35] you had a fine son and he is a son this
[1:07:46] is where he belongs that he always was a
[1:07:50] son this is just the birthing process
[1:08:00] that's seed in all its bulb and
[1:08:03] everything that's laying there has to
[1:08:07] come to a spot it's got to be birthed
[1:08:12] and every Son of God has to be birthed
[1:08:17] you are not born to live in chaos you
[1:08:21] were not born to live in stress you were
[1:08:24] not born to live in sickness you were
[1:08:27] born to live in perfection and Satan
[1:08:31] keeps wrapping himself around he keeps
[1:08:34] wrapping his false vine around you and
[1:08:36] says you're never coming up but there's
[1:08:39] an angel standing here there's an angel
[1:08:47] standing here and whom the Sun has set
[1:08:50] free is free ending Satan take your
[1:08:55] dirty hands off of God's property
[1:09:14] Cain Cain slew the righteous Abel but
[1:09:19] there came forth a Seth look what Cain's
[1:09:24] life produce and watch what Seth's life
[1:09:26] produced watch what Satan's hey all of
[1:09:30] his schemes and all of this ideas watch
[1:09:33] what they produce and watch what the Sun
[1:09:35] produces who can be seated I'm not done
[1:09:41] I was born to be a Fisher of men some
[1:09:55] people ask me what my career is I tell
[1:09:58] some people I study drunk people it's
[1:10:05] what I do for a living I study drunk
[1:10:08] people it's all it's it's an amazing
[1:10:10] thing to watch is watch drunks every
[1:10:14] Saturday night and watch drunks every
[1:10:16] Sunday night but they are not drunk
[1:10:18] online and alcohol they're drunk on the
[1:10:21] stimulation of Revelation this joy that
[1:10:26] I have the world didn't give it to me
[1:10:30] but also I tell people I fish for a
[1:10:33] living and I knew you I fish for a
[1:10:38] living
[1:10:39] I'm fishing I'm fishing for those that
[1:10:45] are the rainbow trout and I believe that
[1:10:49] the opening of the word is bringing in
[1:10:51] those rainbow trout
[1:10:53] I believe it's pulling in every single
[1:10:57] one that God ordained before the
[1:10:59] foundation of the world
[1:11:00] oh I was not born I was not born I was
[1:11:06] not born to live under the first and
[1:11:08] second pole then I need that I need
[1:11:10] healing
[1:11:11] I need discernment but I was born for
[1:11:14] this opening of the word oh this is
[1:11:21] where I belong
[1:11:23] this is where I belong
[1:11:26] and once that seed comes forth it was
[1:11:29] ordained for that spot to bring forth in
[1:11:32] all of its beauty there were some spots
[1:11:36] that you could not so forth their beauty
[1:11:38] but in this spot you can show forth
[1:11:41] everything that you were named for and
[1:11:43] you're equipped for the bath
[1:11:45] you see if you know who you are you know
[1:11:48] who you are not the most amount if you
[1:11:52] know you are an eagle you know you're
[1:11:54] not a chicken
[1:11:56] don't you dare allow Satan to tell you a
[1:11:59] chicken when you know that you're an
[1:12:01] eagle you are destined for the sky you
[1:12:04] are destined for the seagull eggs when
[1:12:08] man try to put his grip on you you just
[1:12:10] kept lifting higher by the revelation of
[1:12:14] this word Oh hallelujah this world out
[1:12:22] here this world is not my home
[1:12:30] I'm not a part of Laodicea but I come
[1:12:33] out of Laodicea what a glorious day it
[1:12:41] will be when we stand there with the
[1:12:45] overcomers of all the ages and they say
[1:12:50] where they came from and you tell them
[1:12:54] that you came out of the Laodicean
[1:12:56] Church nades and they begin to ask you
[1:12:58] how in the world did you overcome and
[1:13:02] you began to sing to them it was not my
[1:13:04] mind and it's not mine but by God's
[1:13:08] Spirit saith Lord you were built to
[1:13:14] overcome Laodicea you were not born to
[1:13:17] be defeated you were not born to be
[1:13:19] depleted of all your energies and be
[1:13:21] wore out you were built to live in his
[1:13:24] presence it is Satan's schemes to tear
[1:13:27] down your health your health platform
[1:13:29] and tear down all of your mind it's his
[1:13:32] scheme to do that but you belong in his
[1:13:34] presence you do but you don't belong in
[1:13:37] sickness
[1:13:38] I wish I got a little better a man there
[1:13:42] you don't belong in sickness you belong
[1:13:46] in health you don't belong in bondage
[1:13:50] you belong to deliverance
[1:13:55] you don't belong to diseases
[1:13:57] you don't belong to doubt you don't
[1:14:00] belong to Satan
[1:14:02] you don't know to god you better long in
[1:14:09] an atmosphere that revival day-in
[1:14:12] day-out I was told one time I was told
[1:14:18] one time by a person who says that you
[1:14:20] know what we feel and what we experience
[1:14:23] I don't believe we can have that every
[1:14:25] day we need to be washed of that kind of
[1:14:29] thinking we were born for heavenly
[1:14:32] places we were born for heaven to come
[1:14:35] down we were born for his spirit we were
[1:14:38] barred to get in the spirit if we were
[1:14:42] not born and we cannot have this Holy
[1:14:45] Ghost every single day and God don't
[1:14:47] pour out his spirit like he did maybe 20
[1:14:49] years or 30 years ago in your mind said
[1:14:52] you need to be washed of that thinking
[1:14:54] you need to wake up you need to wake up
[1:14:59] and realize what God is doing here so I
[1:15:02] know some of you want to settle me and
[1:15:04] not say Amen to the word but you need to
[1:15:06] wake up and recognize what is happening
[1:15:09] here God is lifting his eagles off the
[1:15:13] ground gravitation is losing hold
[1:15:21] a car was not built to go where rocky
[1:15:25] goes but a rocket was built to go into
[1:15:27] the heavenlies we will all the way from
[1:15:30] the horse-and-buggy aid to the rocket
[1:15:33] ace who the astronaut aids and we are
