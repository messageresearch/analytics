[30:04] [Music]
[30:13] take a second
[30:14] everyone for their their prayers and
[30:16] thank everyone for what y'all did for me
[30:19] and Sarah and Uriah the last couple
[30:21] weeks and especially the prayers when we
[30:23] left church Saturday night four weeks
[30:25] ago and didn't expect to have a baby
[30:27] soon but we ended up going into she
[30:30] ended up being induced and I'm just
[30:32] thankful for everything God did and just
[30:34] real quick just wanted to say a quick
[30:36] testimony about about that situation
[30:39] of course we go in and Sarah's numbers
[30:42] were way higher than what they should
[30:44] have been and a lot of levels and once
[30:46] they told us naturally they walk in the
[30:48] room and say hey you're not leaving
[30:50] until the baby's coming there's a lot of
[30:52] stress there's a lot of anxiety that
[30:54] falls on you especially at two o'clock
[30:56] in the morning when you're ready to
[30:57] sleep and I asked Sarah I said what is
[30:59] there anything I can do for you and she
[31:02] she said the statement I just really
[31:04] need God to hug me and
[31:06] at that point God dropped down into her
[31:09] heart a vision that brother Andrew had
[31:11] told us about that God had shown him
[31:13] back before our gender reveal actually
[31:16] before right when we first found out we
[31:18] were even expecting we didn't tell
[31:20] anybody so there was no way for him to
[31:22] know but he we went back actually found
[31:24] the service and brother Andrew was
[31:26] walking across the we were praying for
[31:28] people here at the altar and brother
[31:31] Andrew had a vision that Sarah was
[31:33] holding holding a baby boy and I asked
[31:36] him when he told me I said well did he
[31:37] tell you the name because we were
[31:38] holding the name as well he said no he
[31:40] just told me that he was going to be
[31:42] okay and so we had kind of attributed it
[31:44] to a couple of different situations but
[31:48] then in that moment it gave Sarah and I
[31:50] as much peace as we needed and doctors
[31:52] even told us they said well you gotta
[31:54] seem pretty peaceful about this whole
[31:55] situation like if you knew it if you
[31:57] knew what we knew we know that
[31:58] everything's gonna be okay so we're just
[32:00] I'm just thankful for a supernatural God
[32:01] that that shows those things and is with
[32:04] us in those moments it's just Bauer
[32:06] heads
[32:07] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just
[32:09] so thankful to come and come and be able
[32:11] to be in your presence this week after
[32:13] all the storms and all the trials that
[32:16] each and every one of us has been
[32:17] through during the week Lord and it's a
[32:19] it's a place that we can come and find
[32:21] Refuge as we know that you can come and
[32:23] sweep through our homes and sweep
[32:25] through our cars as we are worshiping
[32:26] and spending a moment with you in prayer
[32:28] Lord but just to come into a building
[32:30] that a building that we know that
[32:32] there's no change that's going to hold
[32:33] us back there's there's nothing that's
[32:35] going to come and hinder our worship but
[32:37] we have ministers that will come and
[32:39] they believe in the in the true God of
[32:41] today a true God that is the same
[32:43] yesterday today and forever and he can
[32:45] come and show the supernatural when they
[32:47] will yield themselves to a gift and
[32:49] we're so thankful for that as we're so
[32:50] blessed to have ministers that stand
[32:52] behind this pulpit and preach a truth to
[32:54] us and even when it cuts even when it
[32:56] hits deep we know that it's correcting
[32:58] we know that love is correcting Lord we
[33:01] hear each and every one of the prayer
[33:02] requests that's came forth and we see
[33:04] the storms and the storm that came so
[33:06] abruptly there for the the burner family
[33:08] you know you know that situation you
[33:11] know exactly how to bring peace we don't
[33:13] have answers in all the storms that we
[33:15] will face but we know that there is not
[33:17] one thing that comes and surprises you
[33:19] all we need to do is just lean upon your
[33:21] Everlasting hand that that's going to be
[33:23] with us in those moments and just pray
[33:25] for peace pray for comfort because we
[33:27] know that that Spirit can just you can
[33:29] just send it right by our way Lord and
[33:31] we ask that your healing hand come and
[33:33] just speak Miracles and bring miracles
[33:35] to our lives Lord Jesus I just ask that
[33:37] you'll just come tonight use the
[33:39] minister of the hour and allow him to
[33:41] just use that inspiration that you've
[33:43] given to him this week use it and just
[33:45] yield himself once more he yields
[33:47] himself every weekend yields himself
[33:49] through the weeks and we're just so
[33:50] thankful for that because if it was just
[33:53] us as men we would be nothing but Lord
[33:55] God it's you that comes and uses us as
[33:57] vessels Lord and we just ask that you'll

[54:13] Lord your great Shekinah Glory that
[54:16] would come down upon the Tabernacle of
[54:18] wilderness
[54:19] Lord and the children of Israel would
[54:21] recognize that you are in the camp
[54:24] but Lord they would see you come time
[54:27] and maybe one year you'd come and as the
[54:30] high priest would enter in
[54:31] but Lord every single one of us sitting
[54:33] here under the sound of of your word
[54:36] tonight we are here as high priest we
[54:40] enter into your Shekinah Glory
[54:42] Lord in the message has awakened us to
[54:45] recognize that thy Shekinah Glory is
[54:47] here
[54:48] Lord It's never failing
[54:50] it's never going to leave us where we
[54:53] are it's not leaving us in our
[54:55] situations of life and Lord we want our
[54:58] praise to come before the God Lord let
[55:02] us be dead into the things of the world
[55:04] father Lord that we wouldn't hear what
[55:06] the rest of the world has got to say
[55:08] Lord but may the veil of the Holy Ghost
[55:11] drop around us Lord Jesus Lord that we
[55:14] couldn't hear what's going on around but
[55:16] Lord May the world hear us praising the
[55:19] god of Abraham Isaac and Israel Lord I
[55:23] pray father that tonight that as we
[55:25] would enter into your house Lord with
[55:27] Thanksgiving in our heart Lord Jesus
[55:29] Lord we know that you are here for your
[55:32] people you are here because of your
[55:34] word's sake father lord it's not because
[55:37] of men it's not because of a building
[55:39] Lord men can build all types of
[55:42] buildings Lord Arenas and and different
[55:44] places have their kind of atmosphere but
[55:47] you are here because the word father
[55:49] Lord your children have gathered in your
[55:51] name and we recognize where two are
[55:54] gathered there you are so tonight we
[55:56] recognize that the god of the Bible
[55:59] has come into this room to declare
[56:01] himself as God and Lord we want our lips
[56:04] Lord not to be given over to men's
[56:06] service of lip service of men but Lord
[56:08] we want our lips to give praise to the
[56:11] god of the Bible
[56:13] Lord we know that you have something in
[56:16] store for us tonight lord it's very
[56:18] special Lord the atmosphere tells us
[56:21] that it's special
[56:23] Lord your presence here Lord that's
[56:25] moving on your people Lord I feel the
[56:27] effect of it Lord as it's working on
[56:29] their lives Lord Lord they just want to
[56:32] lift up their voice and shout hallelujah
[56:34] they want to lift up their hands and
[56:36] they want to sing out a song and praise
[56:38] you and father I pray Lord that you just
[56:41] minister to them in a special way Lord
[56:44] this subject that we take tonight is
[56:46] very dear to our hearts Lord Jesus it
[56:48] means it means a whole lot to me father
[56:51] and I would ask Lord that you would come
[56:53] and give us Grace father tonight Lord
[56:56] we're your children and Lord you know
[56:58] our needs so father we come before you
[57:00] and ask God that you take control of
[57:03] this service control of our lives and
[57:05] you just be be here ever present in
[57:08] Jesus name amen amen
[57:12] if you have your Bibles this evening
[57:14] we'd like to look into a few scriptures
[57:16] here
[57:19] over in the Book of Psalms chapter 113.
[57:25] Psalms 113 verse 1.
[57:28] then down to First Corinthians chapter
[57:30] 2.
[57:32] verse 9.
[57:48] Hallelujah do you love the Lord this
[57:51] evening
[57:52] amen
[57:53] Psalms 113.
[57:56] praise ye the Lord
[57:58] praise all you Servants of the Lord
[58:00] praise the name of the Lord
[58:04] blessed be the name of the Lord from
[58:06] this time forth and forevermore
[58:09] from the rising of the Sun and to the
[58:11] going down of the same the lord's name
[58:13] is to be praised
[58:16] the Lord is high above all nations and
[58:19] His glory above the heavens who is
[58:21] likened to our God who dwelleth on high
[58:24] who humbleth himself to behold the
[58:26] things that are in heaven and in Earth
[58:28] he raises up the poor Out of the Dust
[58:31] and lifteth the needy out of the
[58:33] dunghill that he may set him
[58:36] with princes even the princes of his
[58:39] people he maketh the barren woman to
[58:41] keep house and to be joyful mother of
[58:44] children praise ye the Lord First
[58:48] Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9.
[58:57] First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9.
[59:00] but at his as it is written I have not
[59:03] seen nor ear heard neither hath it
[59:06] entered into the heart of man the things
[59:08] which God hath prepared for them that
[59:10] love him
[59:12] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[59:15] his spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[59:18] things yea the Deep things of God for
[59:21] what man knoweth the things of a man
[59:23] save the spirit of man which is in him
[59:26] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[59:30] but the spirit of God now we have
[59:32] received not the spirit of the world but
[59:35] the spirit which is of god that we may
[59:38] might know the things that are freely
[59:40] given to us of God which things also we
[59:45] speak not in The Words which man's
[59:47] Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[59:50] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[59:52] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[59:55] not the things of the spirit of God for
[59:59] they are foolishness unto him neither
[1:00:01] can he know them because they are
[1:00:04] spiritually discerned may God bless his
[1:00:07] word you may be seated here in the
[1:00:09] presence of the Lord
[1:00:10] and we we see here by our scripture
[1:00:13] reading here tonight that we see that
[1:00:15] God's thoughts and his secrets are only
[1:00:18] understood by the spirit and if we're
[1:00:21] going to ever know or gain any knowledge
[1:00:23] from almighty God we're going to have to
[1:00:25] have the same Spirit of the one that
[1:00:28] wrote the word and we recognize that the
[1:00:31] Bible is very clear upon this point and
[1:00:33] we see that these scriptures line out
[1:00:34] according to what Moses said in
[1:00:37] Deuteronomy 29 and 29 that the secret
[1:00:39] things belong unto the Lord but the
[1:00:42] things which are revealed belong unto us
[1:00:45] and we recognize immediately that there
[1:00:48] is something that is given unto us which
[1:00:50] is faith that is a revelation and we
[1:00:53] recognize immediately that the word of
[1:00:55] the Lord is very very special under the
[1:00:58] Church of the Living God we we recognize
[1:01:01] without that word that we are absolutely
[1:01:03] nothing we recognize without without his
[1:01:06] power that we are powerless and we we
[1:01:08] recognize that the one that is amongst
[1:01:10] us is the god of the Bible and you
[1:01:13] remember when when brother Branham is
[1:01:15] laying or he's heading out to go do a
[1:01:17] little squirrel hunting one morning and
[1:01:18] he goes out there and there before him
[1:01:21] it's early before the Sun is up and he's
[1:01:23] walking out there and there appears unto
[1:01:24] him three or three rainbows and he said
[1:01:27] he said whatever it was it was alive it
[1:01:30] was pulsating unto him he said there was
[1:01:32] one on the left and one on the right and
[1:01:34] one there in the center and he was drawn
[1:01:36] he was drawn to what he had seen sitting
[1:01:39] there and he was he was heading out
[1:01:40] there and he started walking towards it
[1:01:42] and the angel of the Lord said that's
[1:01:43] close enough and he brother Brandon said
[1:01:46] I screamed out Lord what would you have
[1:01:48] your servant to know and he said these
[1:01:50] words the Lord spoke these words that
[1:01:52] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[1:01:55] Christ of the new and he said that was
[1:01:58] confirming my message of him that the 31
[1:02:01] years of my Ministry was not in vain and
[1:02:04] the thing that we recognize that this is
[1:02:06] not the message of a man that belongs to
[1:02:09] us but this is the message of the Lamb
[1:02:11] that belongs unto us and tonight by the
[1:02:14] help of the Lord I want to step into
[1:02:15] something that is very very special to
[1:02:17] me something that has been upon my heart
[1:02:19] for quite some time but I would like to
[1:02:22] speak to you something tonight just for
[1:02:24] a few moments on the God that I know the
[1:02:27] God that I know and I know that I'm
[1:02:29] stepping into something rather special
[1:02:31] here but I know I don't know too much
[1:02:33] about the gods of the world
[1:02:36] I don't know too much about the gods of
[1:02:39] what men say is there God out there I
[1:02:41] don't know too much about the gods of
[1:02:43] basketball or the gods of baseball or
[1:02:45] the god of football I don't know too
[1:02:47] much about Michael Jordan's stats and I
[1:02:49] can't say that he's my God I'm not that
[1:02:51] kind of a man I enjoy those things in a
[1:02:54] certain element but that's not my God I
[1:02:56] I don't know those things I don't know
[1:02:58] all the stats I don't know about King
[1:03:00] James I don't know all of his stats but
[1:03:02] I do know some stats about this King
[1:03:04] James and I'll tell you that this King
[1:03:06] James has never led me wrong and I'll
[1:03:08] tell you you can look at a man of
[1:03:10] basketball that they call King James and
[1:03:12] he's got so many records and he's got so
[1:03:14] many wins but there is going to come a
[1:03:16] time when he is defeated but this King
[1:03:18] James version has never been defeated
[1:03:20] and it never will be defeated because it
[1:03:23] is the very written word of almighty God
[1:03:25] I don't know what what men say is the
[1:03:28] god that they know but the God that I do
[1:03:30] know is is very much alive he's he's
[1:03:33] very much patient with his children he's
[1:03:35] he's so powerful that he wants to show
[1:03:37] his power to his children and to me
[1:03:40] tonight to know that I I don't know the
[1:03:42] god that Elvis is I don't know the god
[1:03:44] of Michael Jackson I don't know the god
[1:03:46] of music but I do know the God of this
[1:03:48] Bible I don't know what they call the
[1:03:51] goat or what is the greatest of all time
[1:03:53] but I do know the lamb that is the
[1:03:55] greatest of all time I I can tell you
[1:03:57] about a God that I do know it and to
[1:04:00] thinks that tonight in my little finite
[1:04:01] mind that I don't fully understand who
[1:04:04] God is or or I don't know everything
[1:04:06] about God because it's not revealed unto
[1:04:09] me everything about God but what I do
[1:04:10] know what I do know about God it's too
[1:04:13] wonderful that it can't be contained in
[1:04:15] books I'm like John said in John 21 and
[1:04:18] 25 that the works that the lord they're
[1:04:21] not already in here but if they were
[1:04:23] that every book could not be able to
[1:04:24] contain them and the things that I know
[1:04:26] about my God they are so powerful and
[1:04:29] they're so wonderful if I could take the
[1:04:31] time just for a moment and tell you
[1:04:33] about the God that I know we would be
[1:04:35] here for 10 weeks telling you about the
[1:04:37] God that I've seen throughout the Bible
[1:04:39] I'll tell you the God that I know he is
[1:04:41] a living God he's so great that books
[1:04:44] can't contain him he's so alive that the
[1:04:46] grave can't hold him he's so great that
[1:04:48] death couldn't stop him he's so
[1:04:50] wonderful he's so powerful there's no
[1:04:53] power that can combat him he is so
[1:04:55] merciful that his Mercy is far-reaching
[1:04:58] his grace is sufficient his love is
[1:05:01] Limitless his blood is powerful enough
[1:05:03] to forgive any sin no matter how bad it
[1:05:06] is no matter what situation that you got
[1:05:09] yourself in the God that I know has got
[1:05:11] a blood that's bigger than his sin it's
[1:05:13] bigger than your family problems it's
[1:05:15] greater than your alcohol problems it's
[1:05:17] greater than your drug problems the God
[1:05:19] that I know is the god that can get you
[1:05:21] out of the pit
[1:05:23] I'll tell you the God that I know he
[1:05:25] declares himself as one God he's not
[1:05:28] three Gods he's not a weak God he's not
[1:05:30] a Lesser God he is my God
[1:05:33] Hallelujah he's a my God and I can tell
[1:05:36] you about my God that I know because the
[1:05:38] Bible said who he is
[1:05:40] he is and the Bible said that when
[1:05:42] Stephen was standing there and he gave
[1:05:44] his sermon after after he had been
[1:05:46] stoned and after he stood there and
[1:05:48] declared who Jesus was the Bible said
[1:05:51] that Stephen looked up and saw on the
[1:05:53] right hand of almighty God he saw Jesus
[1:05:56] standing there but that does not mean
[1:05:58] there is another God but the right hand
[1:06:01] of God means the authority of almighty
[1:06:03] God and Jesus is there as the authority
[1:06:06] of God's word you see he's there at the
[1:06:09] right hand of power you see he said
[1:06:11] after his resurrection after he had
[1:06:13] resurrected from the grave he said all
[1:06:16] power in heaven and in Earth is given
[1:06:18] unto me and if there was if there was
[1:06:21] some of the god there's some God a pair
[1:06:23] if there's three gods that means that
[1:06:25] that God that's up there is powerless
[1:06:27] but because there is one God he's heaven
[1:06:30] and he is on Earth he's between the
[1:06:32] earth he's in everything you can't go to
[1:06:35] hell without finding God you can go to a
[1:06:37] big chamber without finding God you
[1:06:40] can't go to a devil's hair without
[1:06:42] hearing about God
[1:06:43] I know we live in an atheistic and an
[1:06:46] agnostic world where they don't want to
[1:06:48] talk about God but I'm one man that
[1:06:50] knows God and I'm not going to shut up
[1:06:52] about my God
[1:06:53] he's so big I Gotta Serve him he's so
[1:06:56] wonderful I gotta Praise Him
[1:06:58] [Applause]
[1:07:00] Hallelujah he's one God
[1:07:02] I tell you what the Bible said or what
[1:07:05] we recognize is that men have taken the
[1:07:07] Bible and misconstrued the Bible and
[1:07:09] they tried to make God complicated but
[1:07:11] God ain't complicated it's the people
[1:07:13] that make God complicated but God's real
[1:07:16] simple I'll declare it to you like this
[1:07:18] ain't but one God and his name is Jesus
[1:07:22] [Applause]
[1:07:28] now we know that Jesus told us in John
[1:07:30] 14 and 17 that even the spirit of Truth
[1:07:32] whom the world cannot receive because
[1:07:34] the Sea of him not and neither knoweth
[1:07:36] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[1:07:39] with you and shall be in you and William
[1:07:41] random said this he said but I think
[1:07:43] that the main thing that I'm trying to
[1:07:45] do or to bring to you is the reality of
[1:07:48] the presence of Christ notice that's the
[1:07:50] main thing it wasn't to bring some idea
[1:07:53] it wasn't to bring somebody he wasn't to
[1:07:55] bring his own knowledge but the main
[1:07:57] thing that I'm trying to bring to you is
[1:07:59] the reality of the presence of Christ
[1:08:01] and you may not feel him here tonight
[1:08:03] you may not sense him here tonight but
[1:08:05] he's here because the Bible said that he
[1:08:08] would be here and that's just good
[1:08:10] enough for me I can take his word to the
[1:08:12] bank and it will be fulfilled there is
[1:08:14] men that will let you down but this
[1:08:16] Bible will never let you down there is
[1:08:19] men that will fail you but this Bible
[1:08:21] will never fail you
[1:08:23] I'll tell you how amazing it is it's so
[1:08:25] amazing that the God that I know he will
[1:08:27] lead you through trials and he'll make
[1:08:29] you the Conqueror it's amazing to know
[1:08:32] that the headship of Heaven has come
[1:08:34] down to the body and he's identified
[1:08:35] himself with a body by identifying
[1:08:38] himself and proving that he is the
[1:08:40] headship so what you are seeing in your
[1:08:42] brothers and your sisters is the very
[1:08:44] expression of almighty God by his Jean
[1:08:47] seed he is saying that you are his
[1:08:51] private property when he places his seal
[1:08:54] upon your life of the Holy Ghost you are
[1:08:56] God is saying that's my Prophet property
[1:08:59] that's my personal property that means
[1:09:02] that Satan cannot touch you at all
[1:09:04] because you're God's private property
[1:09:07] you see when sickness comes by your way
[1:09:09] you can say the God that I know said
[1:09:11] that he sealed me he filled me and I can
[1:09:14] say God you are obligated to your word
[1:09:17] turn on your devil right here the one
[1:09:19] that you created to be destroyed by my
[1:09:22] lips
[1:09:25] you can say to that devil I'm God's
[1:09:27] private property let me tell you there's
[1:09:30] some things that I have of property
[1:09:31] there's some things of houses of lands
[1:09:34] and cars and things that are my profit
[1:09:36] property I've got titles to them I've
[1:09:39] got Deeds to them but what I'm talking
[1:09:41] about tonight is that you are God's
[1:09:44] promise that God has a title deed for
[1:09:48] who you are that when the lamb stood up
[1:09:50] John was weeping a bear in Revelation
[1:09:53] chapter five but there came a voice
[1:09:55] behind them said weak not John for the
[1:09:58] lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[1:10:00] prevailed and he is more than able to
[1:10:03] open the Seven Seals you're not serving
[1:10:05] a God that you don't know what she's
[1:10:07] talking about he knows what he's talking
[1:10:09] about he's not going to leave you here
[1:10:11] with a closed book you need to change
[1:10:14] what you're thinking about you're not
[1:10:16] serving a God that's got seven unknown
[1:10:18] Thunders you're serving a God that's
[1:10:20] released the word and you are now
[1:10:22] understanding what those seven Thunders
[1:10:24] are
[1:10:25] the God that I know has not left you
[1:10:27] here unequipped
[1:10:30] it's amazing to think that you are so
[1:10:32] important to God that God predetermined
[1:10:35] your comings and he predetermined your
[1:10:37] going
[1:10:38] that's why the Bible said blessed is the
[1:10:41] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[1:10:42] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:10:44] the Sinners nor sinneth in the seat of
[1:10:46] the scornful so what is God saying that
[1:10:48] I know your position I know your
[1:10:51] position he raises the poor Out of the
[1:10:53] Dust he lifted up the needy out of the
[1:10:55] dung heel that he may set him with
[1:10:57] princes even with the princes of people
[1:10:59] so Paul is recognizing here that he that
[1:11:03] he takes it through the scripture that
[1:11:05] he could say to these things what shall
[1:11:06] we say to these things if God before us
[1:11:09] then who can be against us so Paul
[1:11:12] recognized how powerful his God was it
[1:11:15] didn't matter what he was going through
[1:11:16] in the Roman jail it didn't matter what
[1:11:18] they did to him if it's receiving 39
[1:11:21] Stripes he still could say if God before
[1:11:24] me who can be against me
[1:11:28] you know one of the most powerful
[1:11:30] scriptures that ever was recorded was
[1:11:33] recorded by a false prophet
[1:11:36] one of the most powerful scriptures that
[1:11:38] that is that is laid here in the
[1:11:40] scriptures is there in numbers 23 and 19
[1:11:43] when baylock was was trying to get
[1:11:46] Balaam to curse God's people but the
[1:11:49] Bible said watch how the spirit of the
[1:11:51] Lord Came Upon Balaam and he said God is
[1:11:54] not a man that he should lie neither the
[1:11:57] son of man that he should repent hath he
[1:11:59] said and shall he not do it or have he
[1:12:01] spoken and shall he not make it good
[1:12:03] behold I have received a commandment to
[1:12:05] bless and he hath blessed and I cannot
[1:12:08] reverse it you see the God that I know
[1:12:11] cannot put a curse and curse upon his
[1:12:14] children
[1:12:15] sickness might come against you curses
[1:12:18] may come against you but the God that I
[1:12:20] know did not curse you
[1:12:23] hallelujah what was Bala trying to do he
[1:12:26] was trying to stop the Church of the
[1:12:28] Living God from going on higher but
[1:12:31] balak didn't hinder him the fall didn't
[1:12:33] hinder God lot didn't hinder God Judas
[1:12:37] didn't hinder God Skeptics never have
[1:12:39] and critics never will hinder my God
[1:12:42] sickness will not hinder my God cancer
[1:12:44] will not hinder my God that's why Paul
[1:12:47] could say when he was tied to a Roman
[1:12:49] Jayla that I can do all things through
[1:12:52] Christ who strengthens me he knew that
[1:12:55] the god of Moses was the god of Paul
[1:13:01] Hallelujah Paul understood his weakness
[1:13:05] he understood his Humanity therefore he
[1:13:08] could say in second Corinthians 12 and
[1:13:09] 10 therefore I take pleasure in my
[1:13:12] infirmities and reproaches in
[1:13:14] necessities and persecutions in the
[1:13:16] stress for Christ's sake for when I am
[1:13:18] weak then I am strong Paul recognized
[1:13:21] that he was not God he recognized he was
[1:13:24] not all-powerful he recognized that he
[1:13:26] was not the omnipresent one but he
[1:13:29] recognized that the God that he was
[1:13:30] serving was he recognized that God ain't
[1:13:33] changing he ain't moving he ain't
[1:13:35] backing up off of his provinces he is
[1:13:38] the all-powerful one
[1:13:40] I'll tell you the God that I know he's
[1:13:42] watching over you when you're asleep
[1:13:44] he's watching you over when you're in
[1:13:46] your bid he's watching over you the God
[1:13:49] that I know who was who is and will
[1:13:52] forever be the one that spoke it and it
[1:13:55] was good the one that said let there be
[1:13:57] light and there was light the same one
[1:14:00] that did those sayings is the invisible
[1:14:02] God that's made visible right here by
[1:14:05] the actions of his word
[1:14:07] that's why Zephaniah 3 and 17 declares
[1:14:10] to us the Lord thy God in the midst of
[1:14:13] thee is mighty he will save he will
[1:14:15] rejoice over thee with joy he will rest
[1:14:18] in his love he will Joy over the evil
[1:14:20] singing
[1:14:23] I said God that I know
[1:14:26] the God I know gives strength to the
[1:14:29] weak
[1:14:30] the God I know gives power to the faint
[1:14:33] the God I know gives rest to the weary
[1:14:35] the God I know gives sight to the blind
[1:14:39] and when it came to the man in John
[1:14:40] chapter 9 that the Bible said that he
[1:14:43] was blind since his birth for the glory
[1:14:45] of the Lord and when Jesus walked by him
[1:14:48] and he touched him and he healed him
[1:14:50] there there began to be a great story
[1:14:52] amongst the Pharisees and and the
[1:14:54] religions of the world of that day they
[1:14:56] begin to ask him said is this man a
[1:14:58] sinner they ask his parents but his
[1:15:00] parents didn't want to be kicked out of
[1:15:01] the synagogue so they said demands of
[1:15:03] his age go and asked him and they said
[1:15:06] is this man a sinner and the blind man
[1:15:08] said I don't know whether it's a sin or
[1:15:10] not but this I do know that I once was
[1:15:13] blind but now I see he could say the God
[1:15:16] that I know is a living God he's the god
[1:15:20] of Abraham he's the god of Moses he's
[1:15:23] the god of Jacob he's the god that made
[1:15:25] Enoch walk he's the god that opened my
[1:15:28] eyes
[1:15:29] I can say the same thing I once was
[1:15:32] blind I once was lost but now I'm failed
[1:15:36] I could say the same thing like David
[1:15:39] said oh Lord set me on a rock
[1:15:41] [Applause]
[1:15:44] Hallelujah you have to go find that out
[1:15:47] whether it's a sin or not but I do know
[1:15:49] this
[1:15:51] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:15:53] forever
[1:15:57] well you say brother Andrew I can't
[1:15:59] serve I can't serve that God well don't
[1:16:01] you worry I'm talking about the God that
[1:16:03] I know if you don't want to hear about
[1:16:05] the God that I know you have the right
[1:16:07] to be dismissed right now but if you
[1:16:09] want to hear some more about the God
[1:16:11] that I know
[1:16:14] the God that I know is real the god that
[1:16:17] heals cancer the god that heals TP the
[1:16:20] god through us who is and forever will
[1:16:23] be
[1:16:24] [Applause]
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:30] Paul said in Philippians 3 and 10 that I
[1:16:33] might know him and the power of his
[1:16:36] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:16:37] sufferings being made conformable unto
[1:16:40] his death a lot of people want to know
[1:16:42] him in his power but a lot of people
[1:16:43] don't want to know him in his sufferings
[1:16:46] but to know someone is different than
[1:16:48] just saying you know of that person or
[1:16:50] you've heard of him or or you know their
[1:16:52] parents or you know where they grew up
[1:16:54] you see there was a lot of people that
[1:16:56] said That's The Carpenter's son there
[1:16:58] was a lot of people that looked Upon
[1:16:59] Jesus and they recognized him that was
[1:17:01] that little boy that could take toys and
[1:17:04] make them live that was that little boy
[1:17:06] that went down there at 12 years old and
[1:17:08] he and he blew the mind of the of the
[1:17:10] Great Men of that day but they didn't
[1:17:12] know him
[1:17:14] but when the field when Philip and
[1:17:16] Nathaniel met him he said Thou Art the
[1:17:19] Son of God what was it Revelation had
[1:17:22] opened himself up to our disciple
[1:17:24] brothers that they could know the god of
[1:17:27] the Bible
[1:17:28] so just to say that you know him or you
[1:17:31] know of him
[1:17:33] it does not mean that you know him
[1:17:35] you see you cannot say you cannot say
[1:17:38] you know somebody unless you met them
[1:17:41] personally
[1:17:43] come on somebody there's a whole lot of
[1:17:45] people that's been in spots they've been
[1:17:47] in spots where celebrities are but that
[1:17:49] doesn't mean that they know them
[1:17:50] celebrities
[1:17:52] come on now
[1:17:54] but I'm living in a spot that all the
[1:17:57] celebrities of Hell know who I am
[1:18:01] they've come in contact with me and they
[1:18:04] know that I believe this Bible they know
[1:18:06] I have power to cast out Devils they
[1:18:08] know I have power to glory on on the
[1:18:11] Elders of the church and their hands on
[1:18:12] the sick and they shall recover
[1:18:15] that's why them demons are scared
[1:18:17] tonight is because if you get this
[1:18:19] knowledge
[1:18:21] Satan knows that if the true church ever
[1:18:24] gets a true revelation of who she is and
[1:18:27] what she can do that she can do the
[1:18:30] Greater Works that she will be an
[1:18:32] invincible Army
[1:18:34] Satan knows these things
[1:18:37] he knows he Saints
[1:18:40] but I know him
[1:18:42] I know him
[1:18:44] you watch the context of the message
[1:18:46] throughout its entirety you you'll find
[1:18:49] that you only can know God by faith you
[1:18:53] do not know God by intellect you do not
[1:18:55] know God by by science or or ideas you
[1:18:59] know God by faith you know God by simple
[1:19:03] child like Faith to accept his word is
[1:19:06] to say that it's truth and believe it
[1:19:08] that's how you know God is by faith you
[1:19:11] see faith is something that is born in
[1:19:13] you something that God give you
[1:19:17] you see that's where it comes from
[1:19:19] through here there through the
[1:19:21] unadulterated power of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:23] Christ that makes a new creature a new
[1:19:25] person he baptizes him Anew in the Holy
[1:19:29] Spirit and when that man he washes him
[1:19:32] he hangs him up and seals him into the
[1:19:34] kingdom of God then he stand there and
[1:19:36] he knows where he's at
[1:19:38] you see if you really know where you are
[1:19:40] it doesn't matter if everybody turns
[1:19:43] their back on you or not if you know
[1:19:45] where you are it doesn't matter if every
[1:19:48] devil in hell is trained it's gone
[1:19:49] against you if you know where you are
[1:19:52] if you know who you believe if you know
[1:19:54] what you understand is the truth and now
[1:19:57] let me say that this is not a knowledge
[1:19:59] that you've garnered from some men but
[1:20:01] this is a knowledge that you've garnered
[1:20:04] from The Living Word
[1:20:06] you see there's a lot of men that will
[1:20:08] run away and hide because they don't
[1:20:10] know the god of the Bible and and
[1:20:13] there's many times when men go to pray
[1:20:15] for certain needs or or they go to go to
[1:20:18] confessing certain parts of the promises
[1:20:20] of God they cannot contain them and they
[1:20:23] can't put their full port full force of
[1:20:25] authority behind it it's because they
[1:20:27] don't know it there's a lot of people
[1:20:28] that don't know that God still gives a
[1:20:30] Holy Ghost
[1:20:32] but I do know this because I recognized
[1:20:35] that he gave it to me and if he gave it
[1:20:38] to me I'm not nobody more special than
[1:20:40] anybody else in the economy of God so if
[1:20:42] I know that he gave the Holy Ghost to me
[1:20:44] I know he can give the Holy Ghost to you
[1:20:47] there's a whole lot of people that don't
[1:20:49] believe in laying on the hands and they
[1:20:51] don't believe in this that or the other
[1:20:52] but I know
[1:20:53] that the god of the Bible ain't changed
[1:20:55] the god of the message ain't changed
[1:20:59] so I can stand here and I can preach the
[1:21:01] entirety of the message I can believe
[1:21:03] with all my heart and I can sit here and
[1:21:05] know that you can have whatsoever you
[1:21:07] desire
[1:21:09] because I know
[1:21:11] I know
[1:21:13] say how do you know it's like when Peter
[1:21:16] was standing there with Jesus and cicery
[1:21:18] Philippi he's standing there and asking
[1:21:20] me he said whom do men say that I the
[1:21:22] son of man am there were some other
[1:21:23] people that were saying that we know him
[1:21:24] as John the Baptist and lies and one of
[1:21:27] the prophets but he didn't ask them that
[1:21:28] who no men say he said but whom do you
[1:21:31] say that I am you see it's it comes down
[1:21:34] to a personal revelation who do you say
[1:21:36] Jesus is
[1:21:37] come on somebody who do you say Jesus is
[1:21:40] he just a was he just a prophet
[1:21:44] was he just a good man that had good
[1:21:46] teachings went about healing people or
[1:21:48] was he God
[1:21:52] and then he said Thou Art the Christ for
[1:21:55] thou art the Christ the son of the
[1:21:56] Living God what did Jesus turn around
[1:21:58] and say to him he said Peter he said
[1:22:02] Flesh and Blood didn't give this to you
[1:22:04] you didn't gather this knowledge from
[1:22:06] your father that was a great message
[1:22:08] believer you gathered this knowledge
[1:22:10] from my Father which is in heaven here
[1:22:12] Peter was standing on Earth but heaven
[1:22:15] was revealing itself to somebody right
[1:22:17] here in the room that's the same thing
[1:22:19] that's happening right now there's
[1:22:21] somebody that's revealing that God is
[1:22:23] revealing himself to him that he's still
[1:22:25] a Healer he's still a way maker he's
[1:22:27] still a promise keeper you can say like
[1:22:30] Peter said thou like the Crush
[1:22:36] let me tell you something it ain't no
[1:22:37] good if I can preach this message with
[1:22:40] all of my heart and they don't live on
[1:22:41] Monday
[1:22:43] let me tell you if I know God don't have
[1:22:46] no grandchildren but if I can preach
[1:22:48] this with all of my heart and my
[1:22:50] children don't see the effect of the
[1:22:52] message what good have I done
[1:22:54] if they see me as a man that just
[1:22:56] preaches on the weekend but live like
[1:22:58] hell all week long they're going to say
[1:23:00] I don't want to serve a god like that
[1:23:02] okay Keegan go back home they can see a
[1:23:04] daddy that prays that can see a daddy
[1:23:06] that listens to the message they say I
[1:23:09] want to know a god like Daddy knows

[1:23:18] about your Grandma knowing it it ain't
[1:23:20] just about your parents knowing it who
[1:23:22] do you say that Jesus is do you still
[1:23:24] say he gives the Holy Ghost do you still
[1:23:27] say he's he heals he delivers
[1:23:32] you see what God does what good does it
[1:23:37] do to preach a god of History if he
[1:23:39] ain't the same today
[1:23:42] he said brother sister I say this I read
[1:23:44] of a god of History one time I read of
[1:23:46] him in a book I read of him in the Bible
[1:23:47] but one day I met him I met him he come
[1:23:51] to me he took he told me not to drink
[1:23:53] nor nor smoker to find myself he had
[1:23:56] something for me to do when I got older
[1:23:57] he said I was just a little boy bitty
[1:23:59] boy he proved that he did it and here's
[1:24:02] the picture hanging right here where
[1:24:04] scientists took it
[1:24:07] I met him
[1:24:13] I can tell you what it's like to live in
[1:24:15] dormal
[1:24:17] I can tell you what it's like to live a
[1:24:19] second-handed life of knowledge of
[1:24:22] people that have garnered things about
[1:24:23] the message
[1:24:25] I can tell you I I was in a spot at one
[1:24:29] time in my life I could tell you about
[1:24:30] the stories of my Grandpa Charlie I
[1:24:32] could tell you about how he went down to
[1:24:34] Sister Barr's house down there in
[1:24:36] Radford on Radford Road and went down
[1:24:38] there lady that was eat up with cancer
[1:24:40] he laid his hand upon her prayed over
[1:24:43] her the prayer of faith and immediately
[1:24:45] she was made whole
[1:24:47] told you about those things on
[1:24:49] Blacksburg road that took place I could
[1:24:51] tell you about the God that that healed
[1:24:53] my Grandpa Charlie when his fingers were
[1:24:55] cut off in a chimney sweeping accident I
[1:24:58] could have told you those things how
[1:25:00] that my father Ron Spencer said don't
[1:25:02] you don't you cut them off don't you
[1:25:04] give him Noms you saw them back on there
[1:25:06] we'll pray and God Will Make A Mark
[1:25:08] again I could have told you about those
[1:25:10] things I could tell you about when my
[1:25:12] daddy how that he fell off a 40-foot
[1:25:14] ladder broke every vertebrae in his back
[1:25:16] doctor said he never walk again but my
[1:25:19] papa Charlie my mom walked into the
[1:25:21] hospital room that night
[1:25:23] I said the night you're gonna walk out
[1:25:25] of this hospital hospital room well a
[1:25:29] man that was paralyzed in a matter of
[1:25:31] minutes is out walking out of the
[1:25:33] hospital
[1:25:35] I could tell you about that Garden
[1:25:37] laughs
[1:25:40] but at that time it wasn't my God
[1:25:43] I didn't know him I didn't know him like
[1:25:46] I know him now but I remember being in
[1:25:48] that spot I want to know him I want to
[1:25:51] be able to tell people my story
[1:25:57] I want to be able to tell people how God
[1:25:59] heals how God says how God gives a holy
[1:26:02] ghost it was something on the inside of
[1:26:04] me I wanted to know him
[1:26:07] and when it didn't look like it was
[1:26:09] coming my way God showed up
[1:26:13] it ain't just that he's sorries no more
[1:26:15] it ain't just Grandpa Charlie and
[1:26:17] Grandpa Homer sorries no more he's the
[1:26:20] god of Andrew Spitzer he said God that
[1:26:22] saved me when I was strung out on drugs
[1:26:24] when I was strongly I don't see it I
[1:26:27] know him
[1:26:29] I know him
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:33] everybody wants to say that the god of
[1:26:36] the Bible has changed
[1:26:39] or the god of the Bible is dead but the
[1:26:42] God that I know he ain't changing
[1:26:45] he ain't dead he's very much alive
[1:26:47] because the Bible said Malachi said it
[1:26:49] this way that the lion the Lord thy God
[1:26:51] and I change not Paul said it this way
[1:26:54] he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:26:56] today and forever you see the one
[1:26:59] difference between Israel and the rest
[1:27:01] of those of those Nations was God
[1:27:05] he would see it was the common
[1:27:07] denominator in the equation of life it
[1:27:09] was Jehovah of the Old Testament he's
[1:27:12] Jesus Christ of the new you see you put
[1:27:15] God to one side and you put Israel
[1:27:17] Israel was like any other Nation you see
[1:27:20] you cut Samson's hair off him he was
[1:27:23] just like any other man
[1:27:25] you take the anointing off of David he
[1:27:27] was just like any other sinner filthy
[1:27:29] man
[1:27:31] but the anointing there
[1:27:35] put the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:37] aside
[1:27:38] and the church is nothing but the world
[1:27:40] with God's name attached to it
[1:27:44] you see it doesn't matter if you call
[1:27:46] yourself a Christian anyone who can do
[1:27:47] that the point is whether you whether
[1:27:49] you whether or not you have the spirit
[1:27:51] of God in you for without that Spirit

[1:32:54] Paul said in this letter in a second in

[1:33:00] which cause I also suffer these things
[1:33:02] nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know
[1:33:05] whom I hath believed and I am persuaded

[1:33:40] he keeps you from cancer Hallelujah
[1:33:45] Hallelujah the God that I know not only
[1:33:47] anoints but it protects
[1:33:53] David was no match at all for Goliath
[1:33:55] when Saul should have been out there he
[1:33:57] didn't know one thing about military
[1:33:58] strategy he didn't know one thing about
[1:34:01] Paul's or Saul's ecclesiastical verse he
[1:34:04] didn't know one thing about that but he
[1:34:06] did know one thing he knowed his God and
[1:34:09] that's the main thing he knew who he had
[1:34:11] believed in and so when the giant made
[1:34:13] his challenge David knew another thing
[1:34:15] he knew what was right and he knew what
[1:34:18] was wrong
[1:34:20] Prophet said sometimes we go to church
[1:34:22] and don't seem to hardly have the
[1:34:24] spiritual intelligence
[1:34:26] to know the difference he said if we do
[1:34:29] we don't act any different he said but
[1:34:31] David he knew what was right and he was
[1:34:32] wrong he knew what was right and wrong
[1:34:34] he knew it was wrong for that Philistine
[1:34:36] to defy the armies of the Living God
[1:34:39] he knew it was wrong but he knew it was
[1:34:42] right for him to stand up against that
[1:34:48] what do you know
[1:34:50] what do you know
[1:34:53] when the Giants of this day come calling
[1:34:55] your name who do you know
[1:34:58] come on somebody David knew he was
[1:35:00] anointed
[1:35:01] but when David walked down there into
[1:35:03] that Valley and he started talking to
[1:35:06] Saul he didn't go out there say hey I'm
[1:35:08] the great one I'm the I'm the anointed
[1:35:10] one next to be king he said I am your
[1:35:13] servant Saul
[1:35:15] he humbled himself
[1:35:19] he humbled himself to be a servant of
[1:35:21] Saul a man that a man that had turned us
[1:35:23] back on God
[1:35:27] was right
[1:35:30] who do you know
[1:35:33] come on David you don't walked into this
[1:35:35] Valley you better know somebody that can
[1:35:37] get you out of the mess you got yourself
[1:35:39] in come on David
[1:35:42] come on now you remember when the seven
[1:35:44] sons of Stephen weren't up there and it
[1:35:46] tried to act like Paul and cast that
[1:35:48] evil spirit out of that man out of that
[1:35:49] man and that evil spirit looked back
[1:35:52] upon them and said Paul I know and Jesus
[1:35:55] I know but who are you I can turn around
[1:35:58] to them same Devils today that's that
[1:36:00] and you know Paul you know Jesus but the
[1:36:03] god of Paul is a god of Andrew Lee
[1:36:09] who are you
[1:36:12] who are you Stephanie Breeden who are
[1:36:15] you that has the power to call down
[1:36:17] heaven and change the world around you
[1:36:19] who are you David breeding who are you
[1:36:22] don't strike who are you Gabriel Spencer
[1:36:27] IMO Devils ain't saying I don't know you
[1:36:29] they said I've been to their house
[1:36:31] before I've been kicked out before I
[1:36:33] know they got power I know they got
[1:36:35] Authority
[1:36:39] I know
[1:36:41] I know in whom I have believed
[1:36:52] that word no in the Greek
[1:36:54] it is
[1:36:57] it means to perceive to understand
[1:37:00] it means to come to know or to get a
[1:37:03] knowledge of or perceive to have the
[1:37:06] knowledge of
[1:37:07] it's a Jewish idiom for relationship
[1:37:13] of a
[1:37:16] of of intercourse between man and a
[1:37:20] woman it is to know
[1:37:25] this ain't some fantasy world
[1:37:27] but you know
[1:37:29] it's for a relationship if you know
[1:37:33] you know
[1:37:36] it means to become acquainted with to
[1:37:39] know
[1:37:40] you see to the Greeks this word meant to
[1:37:43] know facts
[1:37:45] but these facts may or may not affect
[1:37:48] your conduct
[1:37:49] but to the true Jew
[1:37:52] knowledge always manifested itself in
[1:37:55] one's conduct
[1:37:57] one did not know something until the
[1:38:00] fact that had a practical outworking in
[1:38:03] his life so you cannot say that you know
[1:38:06] God
[1:38:07] you cannot say that you have a
[1:38:09] relationship with God until
[1:38:14] look like a world dress like the world
[1:38:16] look like a duck talk like a duck I
[1:38:18] believe it's a duck
[1:38:20] but if you say that you know him you
[1:38:23] dress like him you act like him you
[1:38:26] announce yourself as a Miss Jesus Christ
[1:38:28] you're not just knowing this by facts
[1:38:31] come on somebody we got enough fat
[1:38:33] Checkers out there but the knowledge
[1:38:36] that you have received has came from a
[1:38:38] relationship from the headship and the
[1:38:41] body becoming one ain't no wonder
[1:38:44] Hallelujah
[1:38:45] Hallelujah your headquarters is not in
[1:38:48] Jeffersonville your headquarters is not
[1:38:51] in Rome your headquarters is from Glory

[1:39:03] where do you get that material from
[1:39:06] I got it straight from my headquarters I
[1:39:09] didn't get it from this place or that

[1:39:20] material at I'll tell you where I'm
[1:39:21] getting it from I'm getting it from the
[1:39:23] very mind of God

[1:39:28] real possessed fellow too he come to me

[1:39:47] cancer starts coming your way why don't
[1:39:50] you announce to the devil that you're
[1:39:51] coming

[1:39:55] off my guard you're not going to
[1:39:57] surprise me I'm already coming for you
[1:40:01] got a word and it ain't never failed I
[1:40:04] got a God that never backs up
[1:40:06] oh Hallelujah I know him
[1:40:09] [Applause]
[1:40:13] yeah you say your brother your brother
[1:40:15] you're bold brother Andrew that's all
[1:40:17] right
[1:40:18] I know who I'm talking about
[1:40:21] no no we know that we're living here in
[1:40:24] this lay Odyssey and church agent and
[1:40:26] the the letter
[1:40:28] that says in Revelations 3 and 14 that
[1:40:30] under the angel the Church of the layout
[1:40:32] of seeing right these things saith thee
[1:40:34] amen the faithful true witness of the
[1:40:36] beginning of the creation of God
[1:40:38] and when when William Branham starts
[1:40:40] breaking in he starts breaking into the
[1:40:42] church age and laying out he goes back
[1:40:45] and Taps into Isaiah chapter 65 and 16
[1:40:49] that he who blesses himself in the Earth
[1:40:52] shall bless himself in the god of Truth
[1:40:55] he said if you look at it he said yes
[1:40:57] that's true he said but the real
[1:40:59] translation is not the god of Truth it
[1:41:03] is the god of the amen so he that
[1:41:06] blesses himself in the earth blesses
[1:41:09] himself in the god of the amen and you
[1:41:12] go to reading the rest of Isaiah 65
[1:41:14] you'll see here is Jehovah of the Old
[1:41:16] Testament the god of the amen here is
[1:41:19] Jesus Christ of the New Testament the
[1:41:21] god of the amen here it is O Lord the
[1:41:25] Lord thy God is one there it is again
[1:41:27] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[1:41:30] the new he is the god of the amen he
[1:41:34] never changes what he does never changes
[1:41:37] he says it and it stands fast he does it
[1:41:40] and it's done forever none can take from
[1:41:43] what he says or add to it so let it be
[1:41:46] amen so let it be means amen
[1:41:50] aren't you glad that you served that
[1:41:52] kind of a god
[1:41:54] you can know exactly where you are with
[1:41:56] him at any time at all times he is the
[1:42:00] amen God and he will not change these
[1:42:03] things saith thee amen he said I like it
[1:42:06] it means that whatever he said is final
[1:42:12] I don't know if y'all about y'all
[1:42:14] but I had a mama that believed that she
[1:42:17] was a man around the house you could be
[1:42:20] having a conversation with her I want to
[1:42:22] go over to I want to go over to Josh's
[1:42:23] house I want to go do this that or the
[1:42:25] other and she said I'd have heard it for
[1:42:27] the last time that's final go to your
[1:42:29] room
[1:42:31] well Mama spoke it like that it was
[1:42:33] Final I didn't have to say anything else
[1:42:35] about it I knew what she said was final
[1:42:39] and When God says anything no matter
[1:42:40] what it is it's final it ain't up for
[1:42:43] debating it ain't for arguing if he said
[1:42:46] in Malachi 4 that behold I send you
[1:42:48] Elijah Prophet before the great and
[1:42:50] terrible day great and Dreadful day of
[1:42:52] the Lord he's sent Elijah the prophet
[1:42:54] if he said I'm going to give the Holy
[1:42:56] Ghost he's going to give the Holy Ghost
[1:42:59] get mad all you want to he's the god of
[1:43:01] the amen
[1:43:03] he said God of the amen and what he says
[1:43:06] is final if he says Ron Spencer is
[1:43:08] healed it's final devil you got to get
[1:43:10] out of my way it's final
[1:43:13] if you said Zoe breeding's gonna talk
[1:43:15] get out of the way it's final
[1:43:26] he is the amen
[1:43:29] get mad all you want to you can watch a
[1:43:31] football game baseball game basketball
[1:43:33] game and if your team loses you can get
[1:43:35] mad cry hoop and holler or you want to
[1:43:37] but the absolute is a referee he called
[1:43:40] it and he said that was it it's final
[1:43:42] and when the absolute is spoken over
[1:43:45] this bride of Jesus Christ every devil
[1:43:47] in hell can try to turn us around try to
[1:43:50] stop us but the amen said that we'd be
[1:43:53] there
[1:43:54] that's why William Branham said that's
[1:43:57] why the devil hates that book of
[1:43:59] Revelation he hates the truth he knows
[1:44:01] the truth will prevail he knows what
[1:44:03] these ends will be how he fights that
[1:44:05] but we are on the winning side I mean
[1:44:08] Believers of his word are on the side of
[1:44:10] the amen
[1:44:13] every devil in hell line them up I'm on
[1:44:16] the amen side every disease light them
[1:44:18] up I'm on the amen side every cancer
[1:44:21] death hole I'm on the amen side
[1:44:27] it's final
[1:44:35] you see that's where Faith takes its
[1:44:37] resting place
[1:44:38] for it knows that God will never let the
[1:44:41] enemy ride over the top of him
[1:44:43] he never has
[1:44:45] Faith knows that so regardless of what
[1:44:47] the thing looked like no one knows that
[1:44:50] the ark could float then you'll know
[1:44:52] that God could close the lion's mouth
[1:44:54] the Hebrew children know that God could
[1:44:56] stop the fire Jesus knew that God would
[1:44:59] raise him up again because the word said
[1:45:01] I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither
[1:45:04] will I suffer my Holy One to seek
[1:45:05] corruption he no corruption said in 72
[1:45:08] hours he said within three days I'll
[1:45:10] raise up again it took its Eternal
[1:45:12] resting place in the sanctuary of God's
[1:45:15] word
[1:45:16] and there is stood
[1:45:20] Jesus
[1:45:21] could trust what the word said about him
[1:45:25] to go to the cross
[1:45:27] and know that the amen had already
[1:45:29] spoken
[1:45:31] he's the god of the first
[1:45:33] he's the god of the last
[1:45:35] has serving a god
[1:45:38] throughout all the ages
[1:45:40] he's declared himself as the
[1:45:43] supernatural God
[1:45:44] we're not clown for nobody
[1:45:48] it doesn't count for no one when they
[1:45:50] hit him in the face hit him in the face
[1:45:52] and they blindfolded him and said tell
[1:45:54] us who hit you he wouldn't he wouldn't
[1:45:56] knock down to them
[1:45:57] because he knew what the Bible said in
[1:45:59] Isaiah 53 that he stood before them dumb
[1:46:02] as a sheep but when he displays himself
[1:46:05] he displays himself as the pillar of
[1:46:07] Fire
[1:46:08] that Pillar of Fire has seen been seen
[1:46:10] in this room that Pillar of Fire when I
[1:46:13] was a little child I heard about it
[1:46:14] rolling through rolling through our
[1:46:16] house while our mom and dad were sitting
[1:46:19] there and talking about the God of the
[1:46:20] Bible and talking about supernatural
[1:46:22] events all of a sudden this great big
[1:46:24] ball of fire come rolling right through
[1:46:26] our home and rolled right out the other
[1:46:28] side we are a people that are identified
[1:46:31] by the supernatural you see his pledge
[1:46:35] his presence it is a sign that the power
[1:46:38] of the Supernatural is there when you
[1:46:41] recognize the presence of the Living God
[1:46:43] is in the room and when you go to
[1:46:45] worshiping what are you doing you have
[1:46:48] bumped into another realm and it makes
[1:46:50] you throw up your hands it makes you
[1:46:53] speak in tongues it makes you shout it
[1:46:55] makes you it makes you get excited
[1:46:57] because you are tapping into the world
[1:46:59] of the supernatural now brother random
[1:47:02] after he he tells a story about a woman
[1:47:04] that he prayed for one time that that
[1:47:07] that that that she came up before him
[1:47:09] and she had a handkerchief over top of
[1:47:11] her nose and brother random thought that
[1:47:13] she was just crying and trying to hold
[1:47:15] her tears back or cover them up but when
[1:47:17] she removed it he seen that her nose had
[1:47:20] been eaten off by cancer William Branham
[1:47:22] prays for that lady and just in a short
[1:47:24] time she comes back to him and said
[1:47:27] shows him that knows how it was
[1:47:30] perfectly well they asked him they asked
[1:47:33] her when she went to the doctor said how
[1:47:35] did this happen see he said she said I
[1:47:38] simply changed doctors he see he said
[1:47:41] well what doctor did you go to she said
[1:47:43] I went to Dr Jesus
[1:47:46] you see the angel of the Covenant was
[1:47:49] there at the platform and this we know
[1:47:52] who's more powerful the angels in heaven
[1:47:55] or the angel at the pulpit
[1:47:58] and when William Branham gets done
[1:48:00] telling this
[1:48:02] after this event he said there's got to
[1:48:04] be a mastermind that's putting all of
[1:48:07] this together because if not he said we
[1:48:09] would have the head of a duck we'd have
[1:48:11] the arms of a chimpanzee and have all of
[1:48:13] these things he said but some Mastermind
[1:48:15] is putting this together
[1:48:18] laughs what Mastermind can take and
[1:48:21] thwart the eyes of Science and said
[1:48:23] there's no way that an arm can go back
[1:48:26] but under the fifth seal we recognize
[1:48:29] that there's coming a time when when
[1:48:31] missing limbs will be spoken right into
[1:48:33] existence what happens William Branham
[1:48:37] is talking just before just before that
[1:48:39] service William Branham prays for a
[1:48:41] little bitty girl that's got leukemia
[1:48:43] throughout all of her blood cell he
[1:48:45] prays for her and she starts at getting
[1:48:48] well completely they had to go get her
[1:48:50] all kinds of food and he turns around he
[1:48:53] turns around in the fifth seal and
[1:48:55] delivers this to us that there's coming
[1:48:57] a Time
[1:48:59] that missing limbs will come back into
[1:49:01] existence what is it it was the god of
[1:49:05] the word
[1:49:06] proving that he was the king's sword
[1:49:11] don't fear it
[1:49:12] don't fear it this is simply the
[1:49:15] Vindication of your ministry it is that
[1:49:18] third pull
[1:49:19] what is it what are you handling here
[1:49:21] I'm talking about the God
[1:49:24] that I know
[1:49:26] the God that I know might do strange
[1:49:28] things sometimes and you might question
[1:49:30] why it does things but God is the god
[1:49:33] of Destiny
[1:49:37] and they we recognize that that God
[1:49:39] harnesses troubles and we recognize that
[1:49:42] God God does not create sickness but he
[1:49:45] uses sickness for his glory
[1:49:48] it's not his will that you be sick but
[1:49:51] it is his will that you've been
[1:49:52] delivered from your sickness there was a
[1:49:55] sister in Arkansas an El Dorado Arkansas
[1:49:58] that that William Branham went to see
[1:50:00] that that she was dying of cancer her
[1:50:03] name was Lady my Rick and you can go and
[1:50:04] look it up in a message that you'll see
[1:50:06] that she was dying of cancer and they
[1:50:08] they flew William Branham over there to
[1:50:10] her to her place there and all of her
[1:50:12] family had gathered around and she said
[1:50:14] these words said I have prayed I had
[1:50:17] prayed that God would save my children I
[1:50:21] prayed these prayers William Branham
[1:50:23] said this might be the opportunity that
[1:50:26] God gives you your chance and when he
[1:50:28] spoke that a cool breeze come whirling
[1:50:30] through the room and said thus saith the
[1:50:33] Lord you're healed
[1:50:35] and in three weeks time that little girl
[1:50:38] that her body was raging full of cancer
[1:50:41] was sitting there perfectly well
[1:50:44] what was it the god of the Bible was
[1:50:46] proving he's the god of the supernatural
[1:50:50] you see job wanted to know him in this
[1:50:52] way job wanted to speak with God he said
[1:50:55] in job 13 surely I would speak to the
[1:50:58] almighty you see there was something on
[1:51:00] the inside of job that was pulling him
[1:51:03] knowing that he wanted to know that man
[1:51:07] wanted to know him as a Creator he
[1:51:09] wanted to know him as a savior
[1:51:11] he lost everything
[1:51:14] on the inside of job when saying I want
[1:51:18] to speak to him
[1:51:20] I'm going to speak to him now job is the
[1:51:21] oldest book in the Bible
[1:51:23] it's placed there right in its perfect
[1:51:25] spot but job is the oldest book that
[1:51:27] ever was wrote job never had one thing
[1:51:30] that he could go back a message book or
[1:51:31] any tape that he could go back and learn
[1:51:33] about the God of Moses of Abraham any of
[1:51:36] those things but job had something on
[1:51:38] the inside of his harp and inside of his
[1:51:40] heart that he would know that he would
[1:51:42] be able to speak to God and when God
[1:51:44] finally speaks to job
[1:51:48] in chapter 38.
[1:51:52] you mean to tell me that God's going to
[1:51:54] wait God's going to wait all of these
[1:51:57] chapters he's going to wait 25 chapters
[1:51:59] to talk to me God's going to send you
[1:52:01] through some stuff but the God that I
[1:52:03] know will answer you
[1:52:07] come on you prayed and you asked but the
[1:52:10] God that I know if it would talk to job
[1:52:12] after he lost everything the devil took
[1:52:15] everything from him except for his wife
[1:52:17] because you cannot touch God's wife
[1:52:23] but I want to talk to God and when God
[1:52:27] began to talk to him how did he talk to
[1:52:29] him he'd talk to him out of a whirlwind
[1:52:31] he veiled himself in a whirlwind and he
[1:52:34] said where was you job
[1:52:36] when I laid the foundations of the world
[1:52:39] when the stars and the sons of God
[1:52:41] shouted for Joy where was you not in
[1:52:44] your trial not in your sickness but are
[1:52:47] you are in my mind
[1:52:55] as a brother Andrew
[1:52:59] I want to know that God
[1:53:01] I want to tell you the God that I know
[1:53:04] has the power to heal you
[1:53:06] because it says in Isaiah 53 and 5 that
[1:53:09] he was wounded for my transgressions he
[1:53:12] was bruised for my iniquities the
[1:53:14] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:53:16] and with his stripes I am healed the God
[1:53:21] I know is my advocate
[1:53:24] the God I know when I adversary is
[1:53:25] coming against me like a roaring lion
[1:53:27] he's the god that raises a standard I
[1:53:29] want you to know that God that I know he
[1:53:31] will not turn his back on me he will not
[1:53:33] be he will not beat me out of my
[1:53:35] inheritance he is my representative he
[1:53:38] said I came down from heaven not to do
[1:53:41] my will but the will of him that sent me
[1:53:43] the God that I know says ask and you
[1:53:46] shall receive the God that I know is
[1:53:49] said that the son of man is not to
[1:53:51] become to destroy man's life but to save
[1:53:54] them

[1:54:32] bondage of sin and Satan from the change
[1:54:35] of your past but only in the name of

[2:01:09] I know ain't gonna let no man take his
[2:01:10] praise the God I know
[2:01:14] when you go to reading the Bible and I'm
[2:01:16] I'm coming down I got I got 90 more
[2:01:20] pages on the God that I know but I ain't
[2:01:21] gonna give them to you tonight
[2:01:25] the God that I know you got you got just
[2:01:27] a few more minutes
[2:01:31] the God that I know
[2:01:33] when you're going to reading
[2:01:35] Psalms and I know that Psalms is a
[2:01:37] favorite for the Church of the Living
[2:01:38] God
[2:01:40] but when you go to sir when you go to
[2:01:42] searching and studying out the Psalms
[2:01:44] it's very powerful studies that are
[2:01:45] laying there in the Psalms things that
[2:01:47] you read about in today you'll find in
[2:01:49] the Psalms
[2:01:50] but when you when you go to studying out
[2:01:53] Holly
[2:01:55] which means praise
[2:01:57] Hallelujah means praise you're the Lord
[2:02:01] praise is a name that is given to the
[2:02:03] group of the the section from Psalms 113
[2:02:07] to Psalms 118 which I I read to you
[2:02:10] Psalms 113 at the beginning of this of
[2:02:12] this of this service tonight
[2:02:15] that these arms are known as the halei
[2:02:19] these are the songs of preeminent psalms
[2:02:22] of praise and when these Psalms was read
[2:02:25] it was chanted in the temple while the
[2:02:28] passover's lamb was being slain so you
[2:02:32] can imagine as as the worshiper is
[2:02:34] coming in and he's he's coming in he's
[2:02:36] bringing his sacrifice in he's coming
[2:02:37] and he's bringing it before the high
[2:02:38] priest that they begin to chant these
[2:02:42] words they begin to chant the high
[2:02:43] priest would chant these he would chant
[2:02:45] these Psalms he would stand there you
[2:02:47] see but notice that these Psalms was
[2:02:49] also chanted on the Festival of
[2:02:53] occasions and it was specifically used
[2:02:55] at Pentecost it was used at the Feast of
[2:02:58] Tabernacles and at the Feast of
[2:03:00] dedication and the Levites would stand
[2:03:03] there before the Altar and they would
[2:03:05] chant these verses by verse they would
[2:03:07] go from Psalms 113 all the way down to
[2:03:10] Psalms 118 and the people that were
[2:03:13] standing there in the court of worship
[2:03:16] they were standing there and they would
[2:03:18] either respond by repeating that verse
[2:03:20] or they would stand there in sync and in
[2:03:23] tone with Hallelujah so let me let me
[2:03:27] just give it to you in this order that
[2:03:29] now in Psalms 1 15 and 1 that not unto
[2:03:33] us O Lord not unto us but unto thy name
[2:03:36] give glory for thy mercy and for thy
[2:03:39] true sake so all of the Levites are
[2:03:42] chanting this Psalm and the people would
[2:03:45] stand there and they would say
[2:03:46] hallelujah
[2:03:50] verse 2 wherefore should the Heathen say
[2:03:53] where is now their God
[2:03:56] hallelujah but our God is in the heavens
[2:04:00] he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased
[2:04:05] their Idols are silver and gold the work
[2:04:09] of men's hands
[2:04:11] they have mouths they have mouths but
[2:04:14] they speak not they have eyes their eyes
[2:04:18] they have but they see not
[2:04:20] they have ears but they hear not noses
[2:04:24] have they but they smell not
[2:04:26] they have hands but they handle not feed
[2:04:30] have they but they want not neither
[2:04:33] speak they through their throat
[2:04:36] I don't know what you're doing I don't
[2:04:37] know if you recognize what you're doing
[2:04:39] right now but you are saying Praise You
[2:04:41] the Lord to the god of Idols they have
[2:04:44] no power
[2:04:48] they that make them are likened of him
[2:04:50] so is everyone that trusteth in them
[2:04:53] o Israel trusts thou in the Lord he is
[2:04:57] their help and their Shield

[2:06:47] when Jesus has taken his last supper
[2:06:51] the Bible said that they begin to send a
[2:06:53] hymn
[2:06:56] and they sing these same songs Reagan
[2:07:00] these same songs
[2:07:02] it's the last time he's going to sit
[2:07:04] with his friends
[2:07:06] but there's something about God that he
[2:07:09] loves to be praised
[2:07:11] Jesus is getting ready to go to the
[2:07:13] worst trial he's ever getting through
[2:07:14] but he's going to praise the Lord before
[2:07:15] he goes through it
[2:07:19] come on somebody if Jesus can praise if
[2:07:23] he can praise if he can shout if he can
[2:07:26] Rejoice how much more should you be able
[2:07:29] to praise the Lord

[2:08:25] that cancer is more than him the God I
[2:08:28] know
[2:08:29] I ain't talking about the God that the
[2:08:31] rest of the world think they're serving
[2:08:32] I'm talking about the God that's been
[2:08:34] revealed in this hour the Seven Seals
[2:08:36] has revealed him the mighty Angel is
[2:08:38] here the word has been open to us the

[2:09:18] come on now
[2:09:20] you're on the amen side
[2:09:23] you're on the hay man's side
[2:09:25] the God I know
[2:09:29] I stepped into something special here
[2:09:31] tonight
[2:09:36] there have been only been one man that I
[2:09:38] know of
[2:09:39] that ever took a title like this
[2:09:44] and his name was Daniel Williams
[2:09:47] a personal friend of my daddy and Tim
[2:09:49] Pruitt
[2:09:57] had brain tumors
[2:10:00] much like brother Ron
[2:10:04] was in a hospital and things were
[2:10:05] inoperable
[2:10:07] but Daniel Williams checked himself out
[2:10:09] of the hospital room
[2:10:12] he made his way to evening light
[2:10:13] Tabernacle
[2:10:15] he's standing there in the back office
[2:10:16] with brother Tim Pruitt
[2:10:18] I said I'll come here
[2:10:21] and he's shuffling his feet and he's
[2:10:24] he said I got something to say
[2:10:26] so he gets up
[2:10:28] before the church
[2:10:30] and he preaches a sermon on the God that
[2:10:33] I know
[2:10:37] the God that I know
[2:10:40] they tell you when you're facing
[2:10:41] something like this
[2:10:43] you better know that you know
[2:10:46] he better be more than just stories it
[2:10:47] better be more than just books on on the
[2:10:49] Shelf it better be more than pictures on
[2:10:51] the wall he better be the god that you
[2:10:53] know
[2:10:54] it was the last sermon that Daniel
[2:10:56] Williams would ever preach what a legacy
[2:10:59] to leave behind that he would stand
[2:11:00] there with inoperable brain tumors and
[2:11:03] they would say this is the god that I
[2:11:04] know
[2:11:06] now I ain't planning on leaving you
[2:11:08] but I want to tell you Ron Spencer's got
[2:11:11] some he's got some tumors that seem
[2:11:13] inoperable and he's got scans on Monday
[2:11:15] morning serious scans that are going on
[2:11:18] but I want to tell you about the God
[2:11:20] that I know
[2:11:22] he can take X-rays he can take CT scans
[2:11:24] he can take MRIs and prove to the
[2:11:28] doctors that he's a God that heals
[2:11:30] cancers he's a God that removes tumors
[2:11:32] if he's the god that can be on the
[2:11:34] Colorado mountain and speak to a storm
[2:11:36] and make it leave if you can speak to
[2:11:38] Sister Mita and tumors leave her body
[2:11:42] how much more should the God that I know
[2:11:44] show up for Erica Parker Ron Spencer
[2:11:46] Ruth Wilson sister Betty Morris and your
[2:11:50] need tonight
[2:11:51] you may not know the God that I know but
[2:11:54] I'm giving you your opportunity the God
[2:11:57] that I know wants to know you he wants
[2:11:59] to feel you he wants you to adore him
[2:12:02] love him fill him be filled with the
[2:12:05] spirit Sanctified filled with the Holy
[2:12:07] Ghost
[2:12:10] are you young people could say that I
[2:12:12] know
[2:12:13] the god of Andrew Spencer
[2:12:19] last weekend we had something very
[2:12:21] special here
[2:12:24] my cousin Michael Spencer
[2:12:26] he'd begin to witness to me how the Lord
[2:12:28] changed
[2:12:30] his life
[2:12:32] I watched how the Lord worked on his
[2:12:34] life on this time at that time and that
[2:12:36] time but God so orchestrated that him
[2:12:39] and his wife would come into the kingdom
[2:12:40] of God at the same moment
[2:12:45] it might be a paradox to you
[2:12:48] how your loved ones are going to get
[2:12:49] here but the God that I know
[2:12:54] it might be a paradox how sickness is
[2:12:57] going to leave your body but the God
[2:12:58] that I know
[2:13:01] it might be inconceivable under your
[2:13:03] mind how that you're going to be made
[2:13:06] whole and filled with the Holy Ghost but
[2:13:07] the God that I know
[2:13:13] if you don't know him
[2:13:16] won't you come to know him
[2:13:19] why don't you let him be God
[2:13:21] over your life as the musicians come you
[2:13:25] see
[2:13:27] he's not just the god of the Bible
[2:13:30] he's a God that I know
[2:13:36] he's a god
[2:13:37] that I know
[2:13:42] he's a God that can heal sugar diabetes
[2:13:48] he's the god that gives life to Barren
[2:13:50] wounds
[2:13:55] he's a God that can take glasses off of
[2:13:58] your face
[2:13:59] and heal your eyes
[2:14:02] Matthew Spencer is the only one in our
[2:14:04] family
[2:14:05] that doesn't have glasses
[2:14:07] but when he was five years old he heard
[2:14:10] about a god
[2:14:11] that could heal
[2:14:13] men made fun of him
[2:14:15] called him four eyes eight eyes and
[2:14:17] everything else
[2:14:18] but he got down serious with God at an
[2:14:21] altar
[2:14:21] and he asked God to heal his eyes
[2:14:24] and he has perfect vision
[2:14:29] he's a god
[2:14:31] of Nathan Noel
[2:14:36] he's a dog he's a god of Doug heal
[2:14:45] he's God
[2:14:47] he ain't changing

[2:14:56] he's a goddess sister Doris
[2:14:59] he's a god
