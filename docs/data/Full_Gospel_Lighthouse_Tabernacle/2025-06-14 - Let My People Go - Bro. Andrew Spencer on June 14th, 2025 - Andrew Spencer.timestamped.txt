[10:31] of the Lord with each one of you here
[10:32] this evening?
[10:35] Master of
[10:38] my boat life
[10:40] sails on the troubled sea.
[10:45] Ever there's a wind in my sail.
[10:52] But my heavenly father,
[10:55] he watches over me
[11:00] when the breeze turns into
[11:04] again.
[11:09] And I know the master of the wind.
[11:18] I know the maker of the rain.
[11:27] He can calm the storm
[11:31] and make the sun to shine again.
[11:35] [Music]
[11:37] I know the master of the wind.
[11:44] [Music]
[11:47] Sometimes I soar
[11:50] like an eagle to the high.
[11:56] Above the peaks my soul can be found.
[12:05] But an unexpected
[12:07] storm
[12:10] may drive me from the heights.
[12:14] It may bring me low, but it can never
[12:19] bring me down.
[12:22] Cuz I know

[12:48] and make the sun shine again.

[13:26] and make the sun to shine again.
[13:33] I know the master of the wind.
[13:39] Amen.
[13:47] Here. Sometimes my load
[13:51] is so hard to carry.
[13:56] And it seems my cross.
[14:00] I cannot bear.
[14:05] And I tried so hard
[14:09] and I being such a failure.
[14:14] Whatever I do, whatever I say, keep me
[14:19] sanified
[14:23] now. Keep me sanified.
[14:28] in the storm clouds gather.
[14:32] When the battle gets rough
[14:36] and my way seems so hard,
[14:41] Lord, I tried so hard
[14:46] and I've been such a failure.
[14:51] Whatever I do, whatever I say, keep me
[14:56] sanified.
[14:58] [Music]
[15:00] Well, the messengers came
[15:02] [Music]
[15:04] to old Joe one evening
[15:09] and they told him that all
[15:12] [Music]
[15:14] all his children had died.
[15:19] I can hear Job say.
[15:23] Though God slay me, I will trust him.
[15:28] Job lost everything
[15:31] he ever had gained. But he stayed
[15:34] sanified.
[15:37] Now keep me sanified
[15:42] when the storm clouds gather.

[16:11] sanctified.

[16:20] on this earth has ended,
[16:24] I'll rest forever
[16:29] by my savior's side.
[16:34] I'm going to praise his name
[16:39] forever and ever.
[16:42] Here we go. for the way that he always
[16:46] stood by me and kept me sanctified.
[16:52] Lord, keep me sanified
[16:57] when my storm clouds gather

[17:02] when the road seems so hard.
[17:07] [Music]
[17:09] [Applause]
[17:12] Lord, I tried so hard,
[17:16] but I've been such a failure.
[17:21] Whatever I do, whatever I say, keep me
[17:27] sanified,
[17:30] Lord. Keep me sanified.

[17:45] and the way seems so hard,

[17:59] Whatever I do, whatever I say, Lord,
[18:04] keep me sanctified.
[18:09] Amen. Lord, keep us sanctified.

[27:27] Amen. And I once was walking a different
[27:29] road, but mercy and grace come and got
[27:31] me and got me on a good paved road. Some
[27:34] say it's a tough road. I tell you, it's
[27:35] been the easiest one I've been on since
[27:37] I let him have control. That road I was
[27:40] on, buddy. You I don't know what a man
[27:42] would want to walk down that road for.
[27:44] That just goes to show something ain't
[27:46] right.
[27:48] Thank you, Lord, for the mercy and
[27:50] grace. Ain't he good to us?
[27:54] He's got it all in control.
[27:59] He's got it all
[28:02] in control.
[28:04] [Music]
[28:09] He's got it all
[28:12] in control.
[28:17] He put that reassur
[28:22] way down in my soul.
[28:28] He's got it all
[28:32] in control.
[28:33] [Music]
[28:38] I put my life
[28:42] in his hands.
[28:48] I put my life
[28:52] in his hands.
[28:57] So every road I walk down,
[29:02] I know it's in his plan.
[29:08] I've put my life
[29:12] in his hands.
[29:19] My father knows
[29:23] what I need.
[29:27] [Music]
[29:39] In everything
[29:41] I go through,
[29:44] he knows what's best for me.
[29:50] My father knows
[29:54] what I need.
[29:56] [Music]

[31:20] [Music]
[31:24] My father knows

[31:35] My father knows
[31:39] what I need.
[31:44] In everything
[31:46] I go through,
[31:49] he knows what's best for me.
[31:56] My father knows
[31:59] what I need.
[32:04] Maybe just play that softly as we go
[32:06] through the prayer request. Sister,
[32:09] I want to continue to remember Sister
[32:11] Teresa and brother Bill Delaney. See,
[32:14] Sister Teresa, we got a report she's
[32:16] doing well. We just want to continue to
[32:18] lift her up. Pray for her for strength
[32:21] for her and brother Bill.
[32:24] We have a request here for brother Jeff
[32:26] Breeden. It's brother Davey and brother
[32:28] Jerry's dad. He's very sick. We want to
[32:30] be remembering him tonight. And praying
[32:33] that God would just come on the scene
[32:34] for brother Jeff
[32:36] and a sister Stephanie Lacier from back
[32:39] in Kentucky. Uh, having back issues.
[32:44] That's a Stephen, isn't it? Stephen
[32:46] Lacader. I'm sorry about that. Brother
[32:49] Steven Lassader from Kentucky having
[32:51] back issues. We want to be lifting him
[32:53] up in prayer as well.
[32:57] And Sister Adaniah wants to lift up her
[32:59] teacher, Miss Bryley.
[33:03] She's not doing too well. She's hurt.
[33:06] So, Adaniah wants us to remember her
[33:07] sister in prayer here tonight.
[33:12] [Music]
[33:14] Please remember David. He's very sick
[33:16] with possible pneumonia. And Gabriel is
[33:19] not feeling well today. Sister Christina
[33:22] Pierce.
[33:24] Want to continue to remember our pastor,
[33:26] Brother Ron. The Lord touch him. Sister
[33:29] Donna Ber
[33:31] and those that are fighting cancer. All
[33:32] those maybe you got a need on your heart
[33:36] here tonight that's unspoken but you
[33:38] know the Lord knows every one of them.
[33:40] There's not a secret we can keep on our
[33:42] heart and he cares about the small ones
[33:44] to the great ones. That's what kind of
[33:46] God we serve. That's how he wins our
[33:48] hearts over. Sometimes we don't say a
[33:51] word and he'll answer that prayer and
[33:53] you know that he's just
[33:55] he's just rich in love and full of mercy
[33:57] and grace.
[33:59] Would you come and take them to
[34:02] here?
[34:04] Thank you, brother. God bless you. Let's
[34:07] just bow our heads.
[34:10] Father,
[34:12] we need you,
[34:15] Lord. We need you to come by our way,
[34:19] Lord. You're in the building, Father. We
[34:22] We just want to tell you we love you,
[34:23] Lord.
[34:25] God, we see the signs of the time as we
[34:27] look around, Lord, Israel and all the
[34:29] things that are going on. But Father,
[34:31] our focus is making a rapture, Lord. And
[34:34] Lord, we've come together tonight, Lord
[34:36] God, to give you praise and worship,
[34:39] Lord, and to hear the word of the Lord.
[34:41] And Father, we're expecting, Lord God,
[34:43] great things, Father. God, I pray that
[34:45] you just come right now. Each one of us
[34:47] has a need, Father. A spiritual need,
[34:50] God, a natural need, God. Whatever that
[34:52] need may be, Father, you know the need,
[34:54] Lord. And God, maybe it not just
[34:56] happened in this service, but maybe
[34:58] faith would anchor down, Lord. May there
[35:00] be a word spoken, God, that we know
[35:02] we're going to make it through. It's
[35:04] going to be all right. The answer's on
[35:06] the way, Father. God, I pray for healing
[35:08] over every one of these prayer requests,
[35:10] Lord. God, the Bible said, "Ask and you
[35:12] shall receive." There's no distance
[35:14] that's too far. There's no cancer that's
[35:16] too great. There's no sickness that's
[35:18] too great, Father. So God, we pray in
[35:20] the name of Jesus Christ. And we believe
[35:23] God, you hear our prayer. And Lord, we
[35:26] just ask that you'd come, Lord. Have
[35:28] unknown way, Lord. Lord, I pray for
[35:30] Brother Andrew right now, God. He's
[35:32] studied. He's looked at it, Lord. He's
[35:34] put every human ability there. But
[35:36] Father, I pray may a supernatural
[35:38] present anointing of the uncction of God
[35:40] would come, Lord, and take that gift,
[35:42] Lord God. Move that man out of the way,
[35:44] God. And may you minister the word of
[35:46] the Lord, God. And we'll be very
[35:48] careful, Lord God, to give you praise
[35:51] and glory. Have thine no way in this
[35:53] service, God. We commit it all to you,
[35:55] Lord. Bless each need. In the name of
[35:57] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[36:00] And amen.
[36:04] As we prepare to take up this evening's
[36:05] tithes, we brother Randle, you got a
[36:08] special you'd like to sing for us
[36:12] after. Brother Randall, I believe sister
[36:14] Tracy and Heather, Sister Caitlyn have a
[36:17] That's good.
[36:56] Sometimes I fall
[36:58] [Music]
[37:01] to my knees and pray.
[37:07] Come Jesus, come.
[37:12] Let today be the day
[37:16] [Music]
[37:18] that sometimes I feel
[37:22] [Music]
[37:24] like I'm going to break,
[37:29] but I'm holding on
[37:35] to a hope that won't fade.
[37:38] [Music]
[37:41] So come Jesus come.
[37:45] [Music]
[37:46] We've been waiting so long
[37:51] for the day you return to heal every

[54:08] Amen. That's what we truly need is more
[54:10] of him. Amen. God bless you. It's good
[54:13] to be in the house of the Lord and
[54:15] hopefully you had a wonderful week.
[54:16] Amen. Amen. We're We made it another
[54:19] week and and um here we are. So, we
[54:23] showed up here just to prove the devil
[54:25] he was wrong.
[54:27] Amen. I just like to uh I got this note
[54:30] from Brother Tom Ber and I'd like to uh
[54:32] share this with you. I got this earlier
[54:35] this week. Um I believe it was
[54:36] Wednesday. He said, "Uh, Brother Ron,
[54:39] Brother Andrew, we want to give you an
[54:41] update on Sister Donna's progress with
[54:43] the cancer. We had a PET scan and a CAT
[54:46] scan done several weeks ago and a doctor
[54:48] called us had a phone conference with
[54:50] Donna yesterday and we have had we have
[54:53] some really marvelous news. He told us
[54:56] that the cancer spots that were on her
[54:58] lungs aren't in there anymore and also
[55:00] her lymph nodes have no more activity of
[55:03] cancer.
[55:04] Amen.
[55:08] Hallelujah.
[55:09] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[55:14] said the first doctor had said that she
[55:16] had more cancerous lymph nodes than he
[55:19] could count. He said it just seems to be
[55:21] gone. Also, the cancer on her bones he
[55:23] believes is also gone. And what's
[55:25] showing is that her bones are healing
[55:27] where the cancer was. Also, he said the
[55:30] size of the cancer on her breast was
[55:32] significantly decreased. She is feeling
[55:34] good doing getting to do all the activi
[55:37] activities that she wants to do every
[55:38] day. And we want to thank you, brother
[55:40] Ron, and your church for all your
[55:42] prayers. So, praise the Lord.
[55:45] Amen.
[55:47] Hallelujah. Isn't our Lord wonderful?
[55:52] Amen. Amen. Our God is tremendous, isn't
[55:56] he? Amen. If you have your Bibles today,
[55:58] we'd like to just look in the book of
[56:00] Exodus chapter 4.
[56:03] Exodus chapter 4 and verse 20. And then
[56:05] Exodus chapter 5. Just wanted to say we
[56:08] again appreciated brother Aaron being
[56:10] here last weekend. He he blessed our
[56:13] hearts tremendously. And um brother Doug
[56:16] uh Bowman uh took some of us out, took
[56:19] brother Aaron out and was able to show
[56:21] him uh a few things where the Louisiana
[56:23] Tigers fought actually 163 years ago on
[56:27] that on that day where Louisiana the
[56:30] Louisiana Tigers fought right here in
[56:31] the Shannidoa Valley. And it was pretty
[56:33] special to have some Louisiana people
[56:35] there on the mountain. And uh it it was
[56:38] just special time and I just want to
[56:39] thank you, brother Doug. He did a
[56:41] wonderful job. I don't know exactly what
[56:44] the fee is on that. I haven't got that
[56:46] bill yet, but if you if you're needing a
[56:47] good Civil War guide, I I I recommend
[56:49] him highly. So, Amen. Amen. We just love
[56:54] the Lord with all of our heart, don't
[56:55] we? Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in
[56:57] prayer tonight and just commit this
[56:59] service unto him. Heavenly Father, we
[57:02] come before you, Lord, as your children.
[57:04] Lord, what an honor it is for us to call
[57:06] on your name, Father. Lord, we are
[57:09] mortal human beings, Father. And Lord,
[57:11] we realize, Lord, that we we need your
[57:14] Holy Spirit, Father, to come and
[57:16] manifest his glory right here amongst
[57:18] us. And Lord, tonight, we just ask that
[57:20] you would just come and take your way in
[57:21] this service. Let the Holy Spirit get
[57:24] into the scripture, Father. Lord, we
[57:25] know your word's already anointed. But I
[57:27] pray, Father, that you would anoint us
[57:29] to get into the channel, Father, where
[57:31] you could bless us by the reading of the
[57:33] word, Father, and by the by the power of
[57:35] the Holy Ghost that you can minister to
[57:36] people's needs, Lord, and their wants,
[57:38] their desires, Father, that they have in
[57:40] you, Father, not in man, but in you. And
[57:43] we just invite you, Lord, to take the
[57:45] pull pit, Lord. We invite you to come
[57:47] and take every situation of this day,
[57:50] Lord, of our lives, God. We commit it
[57:51] unto you and we're so honored and to
[57:54] give you praise and glory for all the
[57:56] things you are doing amongst us in Jesus
[57:58] Christ's name. Amen. Exodus 4 and verse
[58:02] 20. And the Bible said that Moses took
[58:05] his wife and his sons and set them upon
[58:08] an ass and he returned to the land of
[58:10] Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in
[58:13] his hand. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[58:16] "When thou goest, return into Egypt,
[58:20] see that thou do all those wonders
[58:22] before Pharaoh, which I have put in
[58:24] thine hand, but I will harden his heart,
[58:28] that he shall not let the people go, and
[58:31] thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, thus saith
[58:33] the Lord, Israel is my son, even my
[58:36] firstborn. And I say unto thee, let my
[58:38] son go, that he may serve me. And if
[58:41] thou refuse to let him go, behold, I
[58:44] will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.
[58:47] Exodus chapter 5 and verse one. Mother
[58:51] Brandham takes from that text there in
[58:53] Exodus chapter 4. He said that was a
[58:56] one-man invasion. Moses riding down
[58:58] there on the backside of that mule going
[59:00] down through there. I would like to just
[59:02] say it like this that what we have
[59:04] witnessed in this hour is a son of man
[59:06] invasion. In this hour, we have watched
[59:09] the very word of life come and manifest
[59:12] its power right here in the bride coming
[59:14] of Christ. Exodus chapter 5 and verse
[59:17] one says, "And after Moses and Aaron
[59:20] went in and told Pharaoh, thus saith the
[59:23] Lord God of Israel, let my people go
[59:26] that they may hold a feast unto me in
[59:29] the wilderness." May God bless his word.
[59:30] You may be seated tonight here in the
[59:32] presence of the Lord. and just like to
[59:34] take a little thought this evening on
[59:36] let my people go. Let my people go. And
[59:39] brother Brandham says something very
[59:41] powerful. It's not very it's not very
[59:43] large in context, but he says something
[59:45] very powerful in the message I have
[59:47] heard but now I see. He said when he
[59:50] moves, he moves.
[59:53] When he moves, he moves. And I I
[59:55] absolutely love to be able to watch back
[59:57] and look throughout history and look
[59:59] back throughout the the Bible and to be
[1:00:01] able to see where the trail of the Holy
[1:00:03] Ghost and where you begin to watch when
[1:00:06] God would begin to lead up to the
[1:00:08] supernatural or to a place where he is
[1:00:10] going to perform his word. And we
[1:00:12] realize that the the cogs of God's
[1:00:15] prophecy that they they run sure and
[1:00:18] sometimes they run slow, but they are
[1:00:20] absolutely perfectly on time. And we
[1:00:23] realize that he may not move exactly way
[1:00:25] the way that we want him to move, but he
[1:00:27] moves he moves exactly according to his
[1:00:30] word. And it's never out of cater and
[1:00:33] it's never out of God's time. And we
[1:00:35] realize that when when God would go
[1:00:37] throughout the Old Testament, he would
[1:00:39] he would appear to the prophets and he
[1:00:41] would appear to the believers of that
[1:00:42] day. He would appear to them in
[1:00:44] different way and how that he would
[1:00:46] contact them. And you begin to watch
[1:00:48] after the fall there and the in the when
[1:00:50] when fellowship was broken there in
[1:00:53] Eden, you would begin to watch how that
[1:00:55] God would set in motion different things
[1:00:57] and different ways and how a process of
[1:01:00] uh uh being able to maintain and a a
[1:01:03] contact a personal contact with the
[1:01:05] people and you would begin to watch as
[1:01:07] God would come and he would show himself
[1:01:10] in a in and appear in different ways. He
[1:01:12] would appear I he would appear in dreams
[1:01:15] in dealing with Abraham and Isaac. And
[1:01:17] he would appear in visions to his
[1:01:20] prophets. He would show up as a pillar
[1:01:22] of fire. He would show up as a whirlwind
[1:01:25] or a cloud or a burning bush. He would
[1:01:27] he would even come in the form of a
[1:01:29] prophet. And we'd realize that that
[1:01:31] prophet was portraying Christ. He was
[1:01:33] not the man, but he was portraying
[1:01:35] Christ. And we watch Christ in in
[1:01:37] Elijah. We watch Christ in Moses. We
[1:01:40] watch Christ in Noah. We watch Christ in
[1:01:42] Abraham. But in the fullness of time, we
[1:01:45] would watch and witness that he would
[1:01:47] come and he he would he would veil
[1:01:49] himself in the body, the fullness of
[1:01:51] himself. He would dwell in the body
[1:01:54] called Jesus Christ. And we realize that
[1:01:56] he would come and he would reveal his
[1:01:58] word. He would reveal his power. But
[1:02:00] even right now, we could say and
[1:02:02] identify that he is appearing unto us by
[1:02:04] the revelation of his word. That he is
[1:02:08] beginning to show himself as he truly
[1:02:10] is. And there's nothing that is held
[1:02:12] back to the body of Jesus Christ. And I
[1:02:15] believe that it it is a firm it is a
[1:02:17] firm confirmation that we recognize that
[1:02:20] the the same one that was there on the
[1:02:23] on the banks of the Jordan River is the
[1:02:25] same one that is in this room that has
[1:02:26] been guiding you and comforting you and
[1:02:29] ministering to you. It is the same one
[1:02:31] that is here to make sure that you find
[1:02:34] your position as the body of Jesus
[1:02:36] Christ and as a believer. You see, when
[1:02:39] Moses was standing in his position, when
[1:02:42] he comes to the fullness of it, he
[1:02:44] doesn't realize his position as of yet,
[1:02:47] even though it's been told to him by his
[1:02:49] mother and the people that are around
[1:02:51] him, but he doesn't fully recognize
[1:02:54] until he comes to a position on the back
[1:02:56] side of a desert that he is in a place
[1:02:58] of a position that he is the physical
[1:03:02] revelation of what Abraham saw. Abraham
[1:03:06] saw his children. He saw his seed so
[1:03:08] journeying by a promise. He heard by the
[1:03:11] word of the Lord that his seed was going
[1:03:12] to sojourn in a strange land for over
[1:03:15] 400 years. But Moses was not a promise.
[1:03:19] Moses was the reality of the promise
[1:03:22] that was given to Abraham. And I believe
[1:03:24] that it's very pertinent that we must
[1:03:26] realize that we are the people of the
[1:03:29] promise of the hour. Now in Exodus 3
[1:03:33] and:e 13 it said that Moses said unto
[1:03:36] God, behold when I come unto the
[1:03:38] children of Israel and shall say unto
[1:03:40] them, the God of your fathers hath sent
[1:03:43] me unto you, and they shall say to me,
[1:03:45] what is his name? And what shall I say
[1:03:48] unto them? No, Moses is asking a
[1:03:50] question. And God answers him and said
[1:03:53] said unto Moses said, I am that I am. He
[1:03:56] said, "Thus thou shalt say unto the
[1:03:57] children of Israel, that the I am have
[1:04:00] sent me unto you." Now, Moses has has a
[1:04:03] good reason in asking this question
[1:04:06] because 40 years ago, he is remembered
[1:04:08] as the as the prince of Egypt. He is
[1:04:11] known as a man that is a murderer of an
[1:04:14] Egyptian. He's got a past. He's he he's
[1:04:17] got he's got he's goties. He's got he's
[1:04:20] got idolatry there. He's got
[1:04:22] intellectualism there. And he's asking
[1:04:24] this question because Moses realizes
[1:04:26] that he's not going to be able to do
[1:04:28] this on his own. So, I'm going to have
[1:04:30] to tell them somebody bigger than me is
[1:04:32] going to do the task that has been laid
[1:04:34] out here. Because brother Brandham said
[1:04:36] it in one time that there had been many
[1:04:39] impersonations that had raised up that
[1:04:42] had come under Moses under that under
[1:04:44] the under the hour when Israel was down
[1:04:47] there in Egypt. There they were down
[1:04:49] there. He said, "But there was all kinds
[1:04:51] of people that had rose up. But Moses
[1:04:53] wanted something different. He wanted to
[1:04:56] have an identification of his
[1:04:58] confirmation of his commission that he
[1:05:00] could point back and say, "This is who
[1:05:02] sent me."
[1:05:04] Now notice in Exodus 6 and verse one,
[1:05:07] then the Lord said unto Moses, "Now
[1:05:10] shalt thou see what I will do to
[1:05:12] Pharaoh." Now, I want you to notice the
[1:05:14] the the personal pronoun here how many
[1:05:18] times God says, "I." He said, "I will do
[1:05:20] to Pharaoh, for with a strong hand shall
[1:05:23] he let them go, and with a strong hand
[1:05:26] shall he drive them out of this land."
[1:05:28] And God spake unto Moses, and said unto
[1:05:30] him, I am the Lord. And I appeared unto
[1:05:34] Abram, unto Isaac, unto Jacob, by the
[1:05:36] name of God Almighty, that we realize is
[1:05:39] El Shadi, the Almighty El Shadi. But by
[1:05:43] my name Jehovah, was I not known to
[1:05:46] them. And I have also established my
[1:05:48] covenant with them to give them the land
[1:05:51] of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage,
[1:05:53] wherein they were strangers. And I have
[1:05:56] also heard the groaning of the children
[1:05:58] of Israel, whom the Egyptians came in
[1:06:00] bondage. And I have remembered my
[1:06:02] covenant. I think it's powerful when God
[1:06:04] gets to remember what he said. Even
[1:06:07] though you might be in a crisis, but God
[1:06:09] remembers what he said. Wherefore I say
[1:06:12] unto the children of Israel, I am the
[1:06:14] Lord, and I will bring you out from
[1:06:16] under the burdens of the Egyptians, and
[1:06:18] I will rid you out of their bondage, and
[1:06:20] I will redeem you with a stretched out
[1:06:22] arm, with a great judgment, and I will
[1:06:25] take you to me for a people. Hallelujah.
[1:06:29] Moses wasn't doing this for Moses. Moses
[1:06:32] was being led by the I am.
[1:06:37] Hallelujah.
[1:06:38] Hallelujah. that I will take you unto
[1:06:40] myself for a people, and I will be to
[1:06:42] you a God, and you shall know that I am
[1:06:45] the Lord your God, which bringeth you
[1:06:47] out from under the burdens of the
[1:06:48] Egyptians, and I will bring you under
[1:06:50] the land concerning the which I did
[1:06:52] swear to give unto Abraham, and to
[1:06:54] Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it
[1:06:56] to you for inheritance. I am the Lord."
[1:07:00] So God is showing that he that he has
[1:07:03] expressed himself as the almighty God
[1:07:06] that he is that he is both old and new
[1:07:09] testament. He shows himself that he can
[1:07:12] that Abraham could lean on the bosom of
[1:07:14] El Shadi. And at 99 years old, you can
[1:07:17] go to read in Genesis chapter 17. You
[1:07:20] can find that Abraham leaned on the
[1:07:22] bosom of El Shadi. You can see where
[1:07:25] where Isaac is there in Genesis 28. And
[1:07:28] you watch as Isaac begins to bless El
[1:07:31] Shadi is blessing the next generation.
[1:07:34] And when you look at Genesis 35, you
[1:07:37] will see there that God confirms Jacob's
[1:07:41] destiny. But he is showing himself as El
[1:07:44] Shadi in these moments. But he's
[1:07:47] declaring he said, "Now look, I have
[1:07:49] shown myself as the almighty God that I
[1:07:52] am El Shadi. I am I am the breasted God.
[1:07:56] I have the abilities." He was showing to
[1:07:58] them that I'm a promise maker. I'm a
[1:08:01] promise preserver and I'm a promise
[1:08:03] fulfiller. But what he was getting ready
[1:08:06] to do is that he was getting ready to
[1:08:08] show himself by the name of Jehovah by
[1:08:11] which Abraham didn't know him that way.
[1:08:13] Isaac didn't know him that way. Jacob
[1:08:16] didn't know him that way. But Moses was
[1:08:18] getting ready to stand out there and
[1:08:20] identify that our God is God Jehovah. He
[1:08:24] what does it mean? It means that he was
[1:08:27] getting ready to show to them that in
[1:08:29] Jehovah lays everything that you have
[1:08:31] meat of. He was Jehovah Rafa to them. He
[1:08:35] was his their healer. He was Jehovah
[1:08:37] Shalom, their peace. He was Jehovah
[1:08:39] Tisanu. And he was going to show himself
[1:08:42] as Jehovah deliverer in which he'd never
[1:08:45] showed himself. He was telling Moses,
[1:08:48] "Tell Israel to get ready. I'm getting
[1:08:50] ready to declare myself."
[1:08:54] Now the prophet would teach us that the
[1:08:57] angel of the Lord accompanies the
[1:08:59] message always.
[1:09:02] He accompanies the message always. And I
[1:09:05] think it's something that we need to
[1:09:06] keep in our mind. David would say that I
[1:09:09] I have set the Lord always before me
[1:09:11] that I might not sin against him. How
[1:09:13] can you sin against the Lord when you've
[1:09:16] set him right before you? Are you with
[1:09:18] me? The angel of the Lord accompanies
[1:09:21] the message always in taking on the
[1:09:23] whole armor of God. He said that's what
[1:09:25] we need today is a man that'll take
[1:09:28] God's word with the power of the Holy
[1:09:29] Ghost behind him to press it out there
[1:09:31] and to watch it come to pass. He said
[1:09:34] that is God's army, his word of fire.
[1:09:36] His army is dressed with the ever
[1:09:38] presence of himself in there going with
[1:09:41] us. I'll go with you. I'll be in you.
[1:09:44] Not you that speaketh, but the father
[1:09:47] that dwelleth in you. He doeth the
[1:09:49] works. So the army of God is dressed in
[1:09:52] the presence of the I am and the
[1:09:56] presence of Jehovah. You are dressed in
[1:09:59] it. Hallelujah. I tell you that's shout
[1:10:03] material right there is realize that he
[1:10:05] said I'm never going to leave you and
[1:10:07] I'm never going to forsake you. You
[1:10:09] might walk through trials. You might
[1:10:11] walk through Egyptians. You might walk
[1:10:13] through diseases. You might walk through
[1:10:15] plagues. You might walk through
[1:10:17] criticism. You might walk through people
[1:10:19] that don't want to go all the way. But
[1:10:21] nevertheless, Moses, I'm going to be
[1:10:23] your God. And I'm going to be sure that
[1:10:26] I get my seed exactly to the destination
[1:10:29] that I've destined them to be. Whether
[1:10:31] they want to go or whether they don't
[1:10:33] want to go. What was Moses watching? He
[1:10:36] was watching an explosion of revelation
[1:10:39] strike him.
[1:10:41] I say the same thing has struck this
[1:10:43] generation. When William Brandham stood
[1:10:45] here in the ministry from 1947 to 65, we
[1:10:50] witnessed an explosion of revelation.
[1:10:52] William Brandham wasn't teaching
[1:10:54] himself. William Brandon wasn't talking
[1:10:56] about himself. William Brandon wasn't
[1:10:58] teaching his ideas. He was teaching
[1:11:00] Bible.
[1:11:05] When he moves, he moves.
[1:11:07] You watch Luther, you lo you watch it
[1:11:10] and God used Luther to move in a certain
[1:11:13] way. He used Wesley to move in a certain
[1:11:16] way. He used the Isuza Pentecost of the
[1:11:19] restoration of gifts to move in a
[1:11:21] certain way. But this is a different
[1:11:23] movement.
[1:11:25] This is a movement that will not die.
[1:11:28] There's going to be a lot of people that
[1:11:30] that die in a message movement, but this
[1:11:32] angelic message,
[1:11:35] this angelic message cannot die.
[1:11:38] Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] That's why brother Brandon would say,
[1:11:42] "We're in a rapturing age." He said,
[1:11:44] "Ain't going to get no better." He said,
[1:11:46] "But it's going to get worse." He said,
[1:11:49] he said, "Things are moving right now."
[1:11:51] He said, "But let me say this. The move
[1:11:53] is on for the bride that is thus sayaith
[1:11:56] the Lord. And when God when God his
[1:11:59] intention and his purpose in this
[1:12:02] message is to simply bring the people to
[1:12:05] his presence, that's what William
[1:12:07] Brandham's motives was was to never
[1:12:09] bring them to himself, but was simply to
[1:12:12] bring the people into a position over an
[1:12:14] atmosphere where they could witness the
[1:12:16] Holy Ghost, where they could witness
[1:12:18] Christ for themselves. It wasn't to
[1:12:21] bring him to himself. And you watch when
[1:12:23] Moses got there, he realized he couldn't
[1:12:25] do it on his own. He tried it on his
[1:12:27] own. He tried an intellectualism all on
[1:12:30] his own. He had a good idea what he was
[1:12:32] born to do. He survived. He survived
[1:12:35] when all other kids didn't survive
[1:12:37] because the angel Gabriel had been
[1:12:39] watching over at little Moses when he
[1:12:42] was in a bull rush and he was going down
[1:12:44] a Nile River. And God said, "Gabriel,
[1:12:46] you stand there and you make sure that
[1:12:48] no crocodile gets him." What was it?
[1:12:51] Moses was destined. Moses was sent. And
[1:12:55] Moses took it intellectually.
[1:12:58] He took it intellectually and he killed
[1:13:00] one man and they run him out of the
[1:13:02] city. But when he comes back, when he
[1:13:05] comes back, he drowns all the Egyptians
[1:13:07] out there and nobody said anything. The
[1:13:10] difference was he was under commission.
[1:13:15] That's why brother Man would say that
[1:13:16] Moses was better equipped in five
[1:13:19] minutes.
[1:13:20] Hallelujah. He was better equipped in
[1:13:23] five minutes and all the schooling and
[1:13:25] all the theologian and all the learning
[1:13:26] that he could ever do down there in
[1:13:28] Egypt. He was a smart man, but that
[1:13:31] didn't teach him how to deliver them.
[1:13:33] Moses said, I love what Moses said in
[1:13:35] Exodus 33 and 15. He said, "Lord, if
[1:13:38] your presence doesn't go up before me,
[1:13:41] don't take me up there." And that's the
[1:13:43] way you've got to be. If your presence
[1:13:45] ain't with me, I don't want to go there.
[1:13:47] If your presence ain't destined for me
[1:13:49] to be here, then I don't want to go
[1:13:51] there, but his presence has destined me
[1:13:54] to a position of a message.
[1:13:59] And I say the land is sweet. I say it's
[1:14:02] time you come over into this land and
[1:14:05] feel feast off of it. I say it like the
[1:14:09] prophet said it. Come on in. The water's
[1:14:10] fine. If you don't know about his
[1:14:12] presence, I say come on in. The water's
[1:14:14] fine. If you don't know about this
[1:14:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost, I say come on
[1:14:18] in. The water's fine. If you don't know
[1:14:20] about the deliverance power of Jesus
[1:14:22] Christ, I say come on in. The water's
[1:14:24] fine.
[1:14:28] His presence is what makes the
[1:14:30] difference between us
[1:14:34] and the rest of the world. Brother Manam
[1:14:36] said, "The church without the presence
[1:14:38] of the Holy Spirit is simply just
[1:14:41] another building with the name of Jesus
[1:14:42] Christ tacked over it."
[1:14:44] Hallelujah.
[1:14:46] Hallelujah.
[1:14:48] The world we live in,
[1:14:50] I I don't think you have to, you don't
[1:14:53] have to imagination loose very much to
[1:14:56] realize that our world is a very cruel,
[1:14:59] vile, wicked world full of people that
[1:15:03] can become demonpossessed.
[1:15:05] It's Satan's objective to contaminate
[1:15:08] the believer and separate him from God's
[1:15:11] divine presence. That's Satan's
[1:15:13] objective and his motive is to simply
[1:15:15] keep you away. And I say this that if
[1:15:18] Satan could keep you away from this
[1:15:19] message, he'd have you whipped,
[1:15:22] but he ain't been able to. So I would
[1:15:25] take great courage in that God has got a
[1:15:27] purpose in your life. That almighty God
[1:15:30] has got something over your top of your
[1:15:32] life. Predestination looks back to
[1:15:34] election. Almighty God chose you to run
[1:15:37] this this message. And the believer's
[1:15:40] resolve is like Paul's resolve in Romans
[1:15:43] 8:38. I am persuaded that neither death
[1:15:47] nor life, nor angels, nor
[1:15:48] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[1:15:50] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[1:15:53] nor death, nor any other creature shall
[1:15:55] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:15:57] God which is in Christ Jesus. That is my
[1:16:00] resolve.
[1:16:02] Let hell come and let high water come.
[1:16:04] My resolve is that Christ is my soldier.
[1:16:07] that Christ is my defender, that Christ
[1:16:10] is my healer, that Christ is my
[1:16:12] protector, that no matter what comes,
[1:16:15] there's going to be nothing that
[1:16:16] separates me.
[1:16:19] So I say, Satan, let God's people go.
[1:16:25] [Applause]
[1:16:28] You begin to read in Exodus chapter 1
[1:16:31] verse 13, you begin to see, just grab a
[1:16:34] picture of the the the slavery that they
[1:16:38] were under. The Egyptians made the
[1:16:40] children of Israel to serve them with
[1:16:42] rigor. It means to break apart. It means
[1:16:44] to fracture. It means cruelty and
[1:16:48] severity.
[1:16:49] And they made their lives bitter with
[1:16:51] hard bondage in mortar and in brick and
[1:16:54] all manner of service in the field. And
[1:16:56] their service wherein they made them
[1:16:58] serve was with rigor.
[1:17:02] I I just begin to just try to get into
[1:17:05] the mindset
[1:17:07] of where these brothers and sisters
[1:17:09] were.
[1:17:10] And I I begin to study out some uh some
[1:17:13] of the Rhabenic traditions.
[1:17:17] And they would talk about the brutal
[1:17:19] labor that these Jewish people were
[1:17:22] under.
[1:17:24] And they would say that it wasn't just
[1:17:26] typical work. They said that it was
[1:17:29] intentionally assigned to be
[1:17:30] meaningless. That it was exhausting. It
[1:17:33] was humiliating.
[1:17:35] And sometimes without a purpose, men
[1:17:38] doing women's work and women doing men's
[1:17:41] work, they put them under a systematic
[1:17:43] oppression where Pharaoh began to fear
[1:17:47] the population. When you read in Exodus
[1:17:50] 1 and 9 and 10, he begin to say that the
[1:17:52] people of these Hebrews is more mightier
[1:17:55] than ourselves. And they begin to look
[1:17:57] at it and they begin to strategize how
[1:17:59] that they could oppress them. And all of
[1:18:01] a sudden they began they begin to get
[1:18:03] this intent of creating a genocide
[1:18:05] against these against these Israelites
[1:18:07] and they trying to kill them out. They
[1:18:09] they kid out the Hebrew babies and they
[1:18:11] they had got the Israelites had got to a
[1:18:14] spot where they were building didn't
[1:18:16] even know what they were building and a
[1:18:17] lot of times it was without purpose. It
[1:18:20] was simply to break them of who they
[1:18:22] were. They were trying to break their
[1:18:25] identity. They was trying to break them
[1:18:27] of of who what they really were. They
[1:18:29] were not simply just working them. They
[1:18:31] were trying to beat their identity right
[1:18:33] out of them. They were trying to make
[1:18:35] them forget that Abraham would give them
[1:18:37] a promise. If Pharaoh could forget
[1:18:39] Joseph just in a short little time, he
[1:18:42] was going to try to beat that there was
[1:18:44] an angel that there was a God that had
[1:18:47] promised that there was going to come
[1:18:48] out and they were going to try to beat
[1:18:50] this promise right out of them. He was
[1:18:52] going to try to break them. They lost
[1:18:55] all hope and identity. When you go to
[1:18:58] read in Psalms 137, you begin to capture
[1:19:00] in the first one through four verses,
[1:19:02] you begin to capture the mindset of
[1:19:05] where they were, they hung their harps
[1:19:08] upon the willow tree. And they said, "We
[1:19:10] cannot sing the song of joy in a strange
[1:19:13] land. They had been broken. They had
[1:19:15] been beaten. They had been criticized.
[1:19:18] They had been mocked."
[1:19:23] lay much different than today.
[1:19:25] The way sin does people, it beats them.
[1:19:29] It destroys them. Alcohol comes in and
[1:19:32] robs their family. Runs them down in a
[1:19:34] ditch. It makes them look at things they
[1:19:36] shouldn't be looking at. It makes them
[1:19:38] run where they shouldn't be running.
[1:19:41] What is sin wanting to do? It is wanting
[1:19:44] to control them. Control their faith.
[1:19:47] Control them and bring in unbelief.
[1:19:50] He wants to keep the promise for you
[1:19:52] believers, for you Christians, and say
[1:19:54] it's for another day and make it seem
[1:19:56] impossible. He tries to tell you that
[1:19:58] that you can't control your mind no
[1:20:00] more. That the things that you're
[1:20:01] battling are always going to be there.
[1:20:07] I want you to remember my title, let my
[1:20:10] people go. He tries to control you with
[1:20:12] oppression, and depression constantly
[1:20:15] attacks your humanity with sickness and
[1:20:17] diseases. kind of sounds like he's
[1:20:19] trying to break you.
[1:20:21] Because if you can recognize your
[1:20:23] identity, you can recognize that no
[1:20:25] matter what strange land I'm in, I can
[1:20:28] sing that he is hosana. I can sing he is
[1:20:31] Jehovah God Almighty. No matter what I'm
[1:20:34] going through, I can sing the Lord is my
[1:20:37] shepherd. I can say the Lord is my
[1:20:40] light. I can say like Daniel said, "No
[1:20:43] matter what I go through, I will not bow
[1:20:46] down to that down to that image." The
[1:20:47] hebrew children said, "I'm not going to
[1:20:50] bow down to that." Daniel said, "I'm
[1:20:51] going to pray even if you try to stop me
[1:20:54] praying." What was it Daniel and the
[1:20:56] Hebrew children and Moses and the
[1:20:59] Israelites had a resolve. And Satan is
[1:21:02] trying to break the resolve right out of
[1:21:04] the Christian believers of this day.
[1:21:07] He always does it when he thinks he's
[1:21:09] got the upper hand on God's children.
[1:21:13] When you look at the space of time, I
[1:21:14] had a I had a nice picture drawn out and
[1:21:17] I I I didn't bring it because I figured
[1:21:20] y'all get lost at it. And and I
[1:21:22] basically it showed the timeline from
[1:21:25] when God gives the promise to when Moses
[1:21:28] brings them out in the Exodus. And
[1:21:30] there's 645 years. In that time, Abraham
[1:21:34] has Isaac and Jacob, and Joseph is born,
[1:21:37] and Joseph is sold into slavery, and he
[1:21:38] goes down to Egypt. And it goes on, but
[1:21:41] here they were for 645 years, and this
[1:21:45] promise was still their promise.
[1:21:48] There was somebody that didn't look like
[1:21:50] it, but it was still a promise. And when
[1:21:53] Satan gets the upper hand on you, he
[1:21:56] tries to make you think that you're
[1:21:58] never going to see it fulfilled. It's
[1:22:00] kind of like Saul and a bunch of
[1:22:02] chickens over there on that hillside and
[1:22:05] they was being mocked and made fun of
[1:22:08] because nobody would go out there and
[1:22:10] fight this pre prehistoric giant.
[1:22:14] But he thought that he had everybody up
[1:22:16] there on that hill in complete
[1:22:18] cowardness and he got them all cowed
[1:22:20] down. You see, Satan will never make a
[1:22:22] challenge like that if he knows that
[1:22:25] there's real genuine faith. But when he
[1:22:27] sees when he sees there's a spot of
[1:22:29] weakness, he'll come in there and
[1:22:31] torment and try to beat it out. But
[1:22:32] little did Satan recognize there was a
[1:22:35] little bitty old David that had a faith
[1:22:37] that was born on the inside of him that
[1:22:39] his father that his father Jesse didn't
[1:22:41] give him. And I say this, Samuel didn't
[1:22:44] give it to him, but it was born on the
[1:22:46] inside of him. He God said that's a man
[1:22:49] that's born after my own heart.
[1:22:57] Hallelujah.
[1:23:01] What are you saying? I'm saying you
[1:23:02] don't have to stay in sin. You don't
[1:23:04] have to stay in bondage any longer. Even
[1:23:08] if you're not living a sinful life, you
[1:23:11] don't have to live in the bondage
[1:23:14] of putting up with dirty, nasty devils.
[1:23:20] I love the scriptures.
[1:23:24] because God makes it so personal.
[1:23:27] And I love I I love Moses. I I've tried
[1:23:31] never to I enjoy studying Moses. Let me
[1:23:34] just say it like that. But in the in the
[1:23:37] books, the first five books of the
[1:23:39] Bible, you begin to see that Moses is a
[1:23:42] man that God uses.
[1:23:46] He takes him all the way back to Adam
[1:23:48] and Eve in the garden, and he allows him
[1:23:50] to have this authority to be able to
[1:23:51] write all these things down.
[1:23:54] And I love when when he begins to write
[1:23:59] that God said, "I've heard the cry of my
[1:24:03] people."
[1:24:06] This wasn't just
[1:24:08] William Brandham's people, but these was
[1:24:10] this was God's people. And I I I love
[1:24:14] this that that that
[1:24:16] William Brandom didn't just call me
[1:24:18] bride,
[1:24:19] but somebody else
[1:24:23] And I I love how that God says it over
[1:24:26] 231 times in the in the King James
[1:24:29] version. He says that these are my
[1:24:32] people.
[1:24:33] I want you to notice that the Bible
[1:24:35] declares that you are called, you are
[1:24:37] chosen, you are elected, you are set
[1:24:39] aside, you are purchased, you are his
[1:24:42] kindred. Therefore, you could be
[1:24:45] redeemed by a kinsman redeemer. that he
[1:24:48] says that you are my people. Let me just
[1:24:52] point this out very very I think it's
[1:24:54] very elementary but I think it's
[1:24:55] powerful. The reason why Pharaoh
[1:24:57] couldn't have them was because they
[1:24:58] wasn't his.
[1:25:01] And the reason why the devil's never
[1:25:03] been able to get a hold of you is
[1:25:05] because you wasn't his.
[1:25:08] You never was his. Even though you look
[1:25:10] like it at one spot and even though you
[1:25:12] you did things that look like it, you
[1:25:14] never was his. So the reason why Pharaoh
[1:25:18] couldn't keep them locked up down there
[1:25:20] in Egypt even though he wanted to was
[1:25:22] because they didn't belong to him. They
[1:25:25] belonged to Jehovah.
[1:25:28] That's why God could say, "Let my people
[1:25:31] go.
[1:25:34] They're mine. I ordained them. I called
[1:25:36] them. I chose them. They're mine.
[1:25:39] And if God's got you, let the world do
[1:25:42] what it's going to do.
[1:25:44] Let the world say what it's going to
[1:25:46] say. Let Satan try to stop you and tempt
[1:25:50] you, but I am bought with a prize.
[1:25:57] The Bible said in Hebrews 1:1 that God
[1:26:00] who had sund dry times and diverse
[1:26:01] manner spake in times passing of the
[1:26:03] fathers by the prophets.
[1:26:07] He would he would use and speak through
[1:26:10] the prophets.
[1:26:13] And I I just want to say that the
[1:26:14] message came to Israel at the right
[1:26:17] time. And the message came to this bride
[1:26:21] at the right time.
[1:26:23] They begin to watch that these that
[1:26:26] Moses in his characteristics
[1:26:29] that he had the habits of Jehovah. He
[1:26:32] moved like Jehovah. He picked up dust
[1:26:35] like Jehovah just like he did when he
[1:26:37] was walking down there on them streets
[1:26:39] with when when he was going to Abraham.
[1:26:41] They watch Moses do the same thing and
[1:26:44] he would take it and he would speak
[1:26:46] flies and fleas. What was it? It was the
[1:26:48] characteristics of God that was in Moses
[1:26:50] and that it was the same characteristics
[1:26:52] that was in William Plum. It was the
[1:26:55] attributes or the habits of Jehovah. And
[1:26:58] I would say that that you and I have
[1:27:00] never been in physical bondage like the
[1:27:03] children of Israel was. But I I want you
[1:27:05] to know that we were in a spiritual
[1:27:07] bondage
[1:27:09] where we're under denominational ideas
[1:27:12] and we were in a season where God was
[1:27:14] going to have to break the hold of
[1:27:17] creeds and dogmas of of ideologies and
[1:27:20] Christianity off the people. So God sent
[1:27:23] a prophet. I I remember my my my teenie
[1:27:26] my my grandmother Christine, she she
[1:27:29] would tell me when they first got the
[1:27:31] message, they were just young young
[1:27:33] people and they grabbed a hold of the
[1:27:35] message and Tiny was in uh she was in
[1:27:38] the she was in a denomination. I don't I
[1:27:40] don't recall the denomination at this
[1:27:42] moment. But anyways, what was it? She
[1:27:45] was in the Methodist movement and and
[1:27:47] she at an early age she had signed her
[1:27:49] name to the church book and and she was
[1:27:52] just she was just very she was very
[1:27:54] moved by the message and she'd heard
[1:27:56] brother Brandham said never put your
[1:27:57] name on on a church book and those
[1:27:59] things and she wanted to get her name
[1:28:00] off of it and and so she didn't know
[1:28:03] what was going to happen. She wanted her
[1:28:04] name off that book.
[1:28:07] And so here she is. It's a little bit
[1:28:09] old teenage girl, probably somebody they
[1:28:11] didn't want to pick on. But anyways,
[1:28:13] they they they she said that they all
[1:28:15] these elders came and they set her in a
[1:28:17] circle and there they completely
[1:28:19] surround her. You can imagine the
[1:28:20] intimidation that that this
[1:28:22] denominational idea is trying to use on
[1:28:24] this little bitty girl, tell her all
[1:28:26] kinds of things, saying if you do this,
[1:28:28] you're going to take you're going to be
[1:28:29] completely damned to hell and all
[1:28:31] intimidating her. That little teenage
[1:28:33] girl stood there and said, "I don't care
[1:28:35] what you do. Take my name off the book.
[1:28:41] I don't need my name on your book." He
[1:28:44] already put it on his
[1:28:50] message had to come to break the
[1:28:53] bondage.
[1:28:55] [Applause]
[1:28:58] What was it? Moses had to meet the same
[1:29:02] one that William Brandham had to meet.
[1:29:05] What was it?
[1:29:08] Moses, there's always two ways of
[1:29:10] looking at everything. And Moses looked
[1:29:13] out the same window that Pharaoh looked
[1:29:15] out of.
[1:29:17] He looks out there. And Moses was was
[1:29:20] led to to watch by faith. And Pharaoh
[1:29:24] was led to watch by unbelief.
[1:29:27] He was led to watch what
[1:29:31] I love Moses. He was led not to watch
[1:29:34] what was, but he was going to watch what
[1:29:36] was going to be. He wasn't going to
[1:29:38] watch He wasn't going to watch He wasn't
[1:29:41] going to watch yesterday, but he was
[1:29:42] going to watch today and tomorrow. He
[1:29:45] wasn't going to look He wasn't going to
[1:29:46] look at the people, and he wasn't going
[1:29:48] to look at the circumstance, but he was
[1:29:50] going to look at the promise. And Moses,
[1:29:53] hallelujah, he valued the future reward
[1:29:57] greater than the present comfort of
[1:30:00] setting in Egypt as a king.
[1:30:05] I love what Paul wrote in Hebrews 11:8.
[1:30:08] By faith, Abraham, when he was called to
[1:30:10] go out into a place which he should have
[1:30:12] to receive for an inheritance, obeyed,
[1:30:14] and he went out, not knowing whether he
[1:30:16] went, by faith, he sjourned in the land
[1:30:18] of the promise, as in a strange land,
[1:30:20] dwelling in the tabernacle with
[1:30:22] tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob with
[1:30:24] heirs with him of the same promise. For
[1:30:27] he looked for a city which had
[1:30:30] foundations, whose builder and maker was
[1:30:32] God. So Abraham left everything that was
[1:30:35] familiar to pursue a promise that he
[1:30:38] didn't yet see.
[1:30:41] So Abraham lived like a stranger because
[1:30:44] he believed like a son.
[1:30:47] I think that's the way I want to live.
[1:30:50] And God speaks to him said, "Now look,
[1:30:53] I've heard their cry.
[1:30:55] I've heard their cry. I've heard what
[1:30:57] you're going through, but tell them I'm
[1:30:59] coming.
[1:31:01] I'm so thankful to to read Revelations
[1:31:04] 10 to recognize Christ is right here in
[1:31:08] the midst of the seven church ages and
[1:31:10] he's standing right here and we realize
[1:31:11] that the mighty angel's here. He said
[1:31:14] tell them I'm coming. You tell him I'm
[1:31:16] coming. It matters. It matters who's
[1:31:20] coming. Is that right? I got in I got a
[1:31:24] few fights when I was younger. I didn't
[1:31:26] get in too many. But the ones I did get
[1:31:29] into, I remember I always had a big
[1:31:31] brother on my side.
[1:31:35] And I
[1:31:37] I never did figure out I did figure it
[1:31:39] out, but I never did. I never did. I
[1:31:42] don't I ain't getting into all that
[1:31:44] tonight, but I was just thankful I had
[1:31:45] big brother. Let me just say it like
[1:31:47] that. And there's a lot of things he got
[1:31:49] me out of and I didn't even know I was
[1:31:51] getting involved in. But you realize
[1:31:53] that there was somebody that got you out
[1:31:56] of the mess you was in. You didn't know
[1:31:57] you was getting in it.
[1:32:00] He said, "Tell him, I'm coming. I'm
[1:32:02] coming. And all of heaven is coming with
[1:32:04] me. I got the power. I got the
[1:32:05] authority. And I'm going to tell Pharaoh
[1:32:08] he can do all he wants to. But three
[1:32:10] million people are leaving with this one
[1:32:13] man.
[1:32:16] No matter what kind of hold Satan has
[1:32:18] got on you,
[1:32:21] he's got to let you go. Just like in the
[1:32:24] beginning and the earth was formed and
[1:32:27] it was without void and it was darkness
[1:32:29] upon it. Darkness had a hold of it and
[1:32:32] God said let there be light and all of a
[1:32:36] sudden darkness had to let go of it.
[1:32:39] I say the darkness in your life has got
[1:32:42] to let go. I say the sin in your life
[1:32:44] has got to let go. Let my people go.
[1:32:48] Sin's got to let go. Depression's got to
[1:32:50] let go. Anxiety's got to let go. Pain's
[1:32:53] got to let go. Hurts got to let go.
[1:32:56] Unbelief has got to let go.
[1:33:01] Take your hands.
[1:33:04] Israel was in Egypt and they had chains,
[1:33:07] but they had a promise.
[1:33:14] But there was a voice that was greater
[1:33:15] than their chains.
[1:33:19] Humanity was in chains.
[1:33:22] and they needed to die. But God said,
[1:33:25] "Let them go.
[1:33:28] My mercyy's making a way for them.
[1:33:32] Let them let them go."
[1:33:35] No matter where you are,
[1:33:39] you know that there are things
[1:33:42] that are holding you back from your true
[1:33:44] worship.
[1:33:49] And I ain't talking about I'm not
[1:33:51] talking about here in service, but I'm
[1:33:52] talking about in your own life. You know
[1:33:55] that there are things that are holding
[1:33:56] you back, trying to keep you from
[1:33:59] worshiping the Lord. And this was the
[1:34:02] intent of Jehovah. It was not just to
[1:34:04] get them out, but it was to get them in.
[1:34:08] Well, he didn't want to just go up there
[1:34:09] and say, "Look, let him go." But he had
[1:34:12] a purpose behind it.
[1:34:14] and a purpose that I mean honestly God
[1:34:16] had a great purpose. You know what his
[1:34:17] purpose was? To come out here and serve
[1:34:19] me. They've been serving you and you
[1:34:22] ain't got no power to feed them. You
[1:34:24] ain't got no power to heal them. You
[1:34:26] ain't got no power to keep them. But let
[1:34:29] them come out here and serve me.
[1:34:32] You know that every demon has got to bow
[1:34:34] to the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:37] You know that the devil does not have to
[1:34:40] mind me, but he's got to mind the one
[1:34:41] that I represent.
[1:34:43] You know, you and I as Christian
[1:34:45] believers are like the Roman centurion
[1:34:47] in Matthew chapter 8 when he would stand
[1:34:50] there said, "Look, I've got a man that's
[1:34:51] in my in my house." And he said he's
[1:34:54] sick with a pausy. He said, "I'm a man
[1:34:56] that is under authority." He said, "And
[1:34:58] I I realize this that you are the son of
[1:35:01] God. You don't have to come and pray for
[1:35:03] him because I recognize the authority
[1:35:05] that you have. If you'll just speak the
[1:35:08] word, my servant will be healed." He
[1:35:11] recognized that the son of God had
[1:35:13] authority over every devil over Satan
[1:35:17] himself. So he recognized that every
[1:35:20] demon below Satan had to bow. That's why
[1:35:24] when William Brandham is standing there
[1:35:26] in the paradox and he starts talking
[1:35:27] about that mamba, he said, "You've been
[1:35:30] given power to bind him or anything
[1:35:32] below him." That means you've got power
[1:35:35] to bind Satan and depression. You've got
[1:35:38] power to bind Satan and sickness. You as
[1:35:42] a body of believers have the ability
[1:35:47] to break out of it to go worship God.
[1:35:51] Another man said, you know, wrestlers,
[1:35:53] he said they practice on breaking toe
[1:35:54] holes and things. He said, if you don't
[1:35:56] break these toe holes, no. Could you
[1:36:00] imagine a wrestler coming out? This is
[1:36:01] one of my favorite quotes. He said,
[1:36:03] 'Could you imagine a wrestler coming out
[1:36:04] now with with his fingernails polished
[1:36:06] and his trunks on with kind of gold
[1:36:09] beads around it? Look like a pretty good
[1:36:11] wrestler. He said, "But that's only
[1:36:12] intellectual. If he hasn't got any
[1:36:14] hidden strength there, that then what
[1:36:16] the enemy gets a tow hold on him, then
[1:36:19] he can pull out of it." Hallelujah. His
[1:36:21] intellectual beads all around him make
[1:36:22] everything don't make too much of a
[1:36:24] difference. So all of our intellectual
[1:36:26] means nothing if there isn't a hidden
[1:36:28] power of the Holy Spirit to break the
[1:36:31] hold of the devil. He said, "But we're
[1:36:34] in a wrestling match. We're in a
[1:36:36] wrestling match not with fine dressed
[1:36:39] intellectual psychology, but we're
[1:36:41] wrestling with a power and the promise
[1:36:43] of God which can break any hold on any
[1:36:46] devil at any time." So God was telling
[1:36:50] them, "Let my people go." Yeah. You
[1:36:54] study Exodus chapter 7. I know I'm I'm
[1:36:56] giving I'm cramming a lot of this in in
[1:36:58] just a short time, but you you study you
[1:37:02] study it out and I brother Jonathan was
[1:37:04] one of the first ones that point this
[1:37:05] out to me and I studied it years ago and
[1:37:07] it's very powerful that these plagues
[1:37:10] were these plagues were not just
[1:37:13] haphazardly, but they were intentional
[1:37:15] that when God turned the water into
[1:37:18] turned the water to blood, almost said
[1:37:19] wine there. Thank God he didn't. been a
[1:37:22] bunch of drunk Egyptians, wouldn't it?
[1:37:27] Yeah, I'm back home.
[1:37:31] He turned the water to blood. Wow. I'm
[1:37:33] sorry. That's too much. I'm sorry. But
[1:37:36] you know, when he turned the water to
[1:37:39] blood, he attacked the god of the Nile.
[1:37:43] The I can't say these words right, but
[1:37:45] they were attacking. God was attacking.
[1:37:47] They are Egyptian god called happy. Then
[1:37:50] he he comes in and he he opens a plague
[1:37:52] of frogs. It was to target the the
[1:37:55] Egyptian god Hiket which was the froged
[1:37:58] goddess of fertility and birth. When he
[1:38:01] releases the gnats in Exodus 8 and las
[1:38:05] it is attacking the god of the earth.
[1:38:08] When he when he uh attacks in a plague
[1:38:11] of flies he is targeting the the god
[1:38:14] Kefrey the god of creation. And these
[1:38:17] are Egyptians gods that is depleted with
[1:38:19] a flies head. When he attacks Hthor,
[1:38:23] when he attacks in the plague of
[1:38:24] livestock disease, he is attacking Ahor
[1:38:28] and her uppies, which is the cow gods in
[1:38:32] Egypt. When he attacks with boils, he is
[1:38:35] attacking the Egyptian god Smit, the
[1:38:38] goddess of healing. When he attacks with
[1:38:40] hail and fire, he attacks the sky
[1:38:43] goddess Orsis, the crop fertility. and
[1:38:46] set the god of storms. When he attacks
[1:38:49] with locust in Exodus 10, he attacks the
[1:38:52] god Sarapi, which is the goddest of
[1:38:55] agriculture.
[1:38:57] And I love this. And the god that
[1:39:00] protects from locust.
[1:39:02] [Laughter]
[1:39:05] And God said, "You ain't got enough to
[1:39:07] stop it."
[1:39:09] [Applause]
[1:39:10] Amen. That's that's good.
[1:39:14] when he attacks in the the plague of
[1:39:16] darkness, he attacks the main god of
[1:39:19] Egypt, which is the son god, the
[1:39:23] Egyptian deities. And when he strikes
[1:39:26] the death of the firstborn, he is
[1:39:28] striking Pharaoh himself that is
[1:39:31] considered a divine son of the god of
[1:39:34] darkness or the god of the sun.
[1:39:38] And Moses stood there in all of this and
[1:39:42] Pharaoh threatened him and Pharaoh threw
[1:39:44] down sticks just like he threw down a
[1:39:46] stick. But every single time Moses came
[1:39:50] out prevailing because there was an
[1:39:53] authority. There was nothing phony about
[1:39:56] it. There was nothing phony about Moses.
[1:39:58] He didn't go by his confirmation down at
[1:40:01] some 10- cent store. But he met a God
[1:40:04] like William Brham met a God like David
[1:40:07] met a God like Isaac met a God like I
[1:40:10] met a God.
[1:40:13] And he had the authority to stand up
[1:40:15] there said you ain't got no right. Let
[1:40:17] him go. Let him go. Turn him loose. Let
[1:40:20] him go.
[1:40:22] I want to say this that the longer we
[1:40:25] stay here
[1:40:27] the less Satan has a hold of you.
[1:40:31] He doesn't have a The only thing he's
[1:40:32] got left on this bride is gravity. But
[1:40:35] one of these mornings, gravity is going
[1:40:37] to lose its hold.
[1:40:40] Let him go. It's time for a rapture.
[1:40:43] It's time for a body change.
[1:40:50] Hallelujah.
[1:40:55] Let him go.
[1:40:57] Let him go.
[1:41:01] Let the musicians come.
[1:41:05] Hallelujah.
[1:41:12] Brother Brown said, "Come, lady.
[1:41:17] You believe with all your heart as
[1:41:18] you're coming.
[1:41:20] Would you like to eat again? Have a good
[1:41:23] full dinner like you used to. You
[1:41:25] believe me to be going to prophet?" Then
[1:41:26] I rebuke that stomach trouble in the
[1:41:28] name of Jesus Christ and it leaves you.
[1:41:30] Satan can't hold where God's standing.
[1:41:33] Go eat your supper and do whatever you
[1:41:34] want to. God makes you well. Satan lost
[1:41:38] his hold. All right. Come, sir. Do you
[1:41:40] now believe every believer? Everybody
[1:41:42] believe. Do you love him with all your
[1:41:44] heart? Do you believe me to be God's
[1:41:47] prophet? I'm just a man. But he's just
[1:41:50] using this we I see something sitting in
[1:41:52] a bottle. It's blood. There's 1 2 3 4 5
[1:41:55] 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 bottles
[1:42:01] of blood. You've had 17 blood
[1:42:04] transfusion.
[1:42:07] I'd say that this was more than a man.
[1:42:12] What was it? It was a sign of this
[1:42:14] generation. You can't hold them. You
[1:42:17] can't hold them there. This ain't This
[1:42:19] is There's never been a There's never
[1:42:21] been a re representation. There's never
[1:42:23] been anybody outside of our Lord Jesus
[1:42:26] Christ that can operate this way. You
[1:42:28] can study it all out. Nobody ever said
[1:42:30] they met an angel like William Brandon
[1:42:31] met an angel and then they had the
[1:42:33] authority to come out there and tell
[1:42:35] them exactly where they lived at. You
[1:42:37] live in apartment 946 a half and a B.
[1:42:41] And I see the apartment has this kind of
[1:42:43] door. You got these shades on there. You
[1:42:45] just met with a doctor that's got dark
[1:42:47] rimmed glasses on.
[1:42:50] What was this? It was Melzdc.
[1:42:56] And Melzdc showed up to Abraham's tent,
[1:42:59] said, "You can't hold his body no
[1:43:00] longer. It's time to produce Isaac."
[1:43:04] I say that Melzdc has showed up by this
[1:43:08] message. And it's saying to you, you
[1:43:11] can't hold them no longer. Satan, let
[1:43:14] them go. They know who they are. They
[1:43:16] know in whom they hath believed. They've
[1:43:18] got rights to enforce it.
[1:43:21] [Applause]
[1:43:25] A believer has a right. If you take his
[1:43:29] authority, if you take his properties,
[1:43:31] he's got the right to enforce it.
[1:43:36] Hallelujah.
[1:43:38] Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] I don't know what key we singing in.
[1:43:43] That song keeps bubbling in my heart.
[1:43:45] Everybody will be happy over there.
[1:43:47] Hallelujah.
[1:43:50] How could you not be happy?
[1:43:53] I'm I'll be honest with you. Serving
[1:43:55] Jesus is the best thing I ever did. It's
[1:43:58] the best thing.
[1:44:01] Anybody else got anything better than
[1:44:02] serving Jesus?
[1:44:04] All hands went down real quick, didn't
[1:44:06] they?
[1:44:08] How many loves serving Jesus?
[1:44:13] If you don't get your hand up, we coming
[1:44:14] by.
[1:44:16] Tell Satan, "Let my people go. Let's
[1:44:20] sing it. I give me give me some words
[1:44:22] cuz I don't even know it. I know it, but
[1:44:25] I don't have it in my mind at the
[1:44:26] moment. Well, there's a happy land, a
[1:44:29] promise over in the great beyond where
