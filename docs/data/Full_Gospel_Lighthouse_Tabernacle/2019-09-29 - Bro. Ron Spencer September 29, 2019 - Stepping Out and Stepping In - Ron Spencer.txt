right now then I'll quit talking so god bless you Stephen if you've ever been inspired to sing a song tonight what's that I am speaking tonight on stepping out and stepping in bless you John chapter 1 verse 1 John chapter 1 and verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God in an amazing that he wrote that 2,000 years ago and yet there's denominational churches all over the world that hadn't figured out that God's 1 the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shanna then darkness and the darkness comprehended that not there was a man sent from God whose name was John and the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not like for you to read that verse with me he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth amen maybe I've need tonight you just like to raise your hand before the Lord amen god bless you amen Almighty God we love you with all of our hearts tonight Lord we ask you that you would anoint our lips we can study and lay aside time and prepare but Lord it it's like a lady that cooks an incredible feast if people aren't hungry it won't be much of an environment but father we realize that your bride pulls on the word and I ask you once again that you would anoint this audience anoint the people that were here Lord made you touch us sweep down through these these places tonight and come to where we're sitting father anoint this vessel that we can step behind this this sacred desk and may man not see me but may they see Jesus that's what we've come to not step to this pulpit tonight we pray in Jesus Christ's name you may be seated there's been some incredible steps that take place and I'd like to just kind of grab your attention just for a few moments there's been some incredible steps that has taken place in humanity first of all when Adam stepped out of the Garden of Eden he made a decision that decision was his eyes were wide open Adam Adam was not deceived he knew exactly what he's doing he could have allowed Eve to be destroyed but he took her place and placed his seed inside of her that she could be saved now you see God did not did not when he cast him out of the Garden of Eden he did not have to redeem them he could have allowed them to walk out of the Garden of Eden and just allow them to become just dust fallen but God made a way back he made a way back and he called him back and as he calls them back there has to be a substitute for the sin that takes place something's got to die in their place something's got to die in their place and so we realized that he took a lamb and he took the skin and slayed the lamb God did and wrapped that skin around Adam and Eve we hear the prophet of God has said that one night as he's preaching he said the other night I watched Adam and Eve walk out of the Garden of Eden now what you just think about this just for a moment war took place in heaven way before this earth Adam was on the earth God cast Lucifer out of heaven with the angels that fell with him are you with me and God Himself did not try to redeem them but when one son fell when one son failed God came running through the Garden of Eden Adam would there would be a statement that was made in these generations that we live in now a man named Neil Armstrong there was aspirations that they would go to the moon an exploration and where a man could put his feet as a matter of fact several different nations were trying to get there and it was a it was a race in space and a race to get to the moon and and and there was a man named Neil Armstrong some don't believe that people went to the moon some still don't believe that but it don't matter tonight no way where I'm not here to put that argument there but but brother Doug Baker's probably the most smartest man that I ever met in my life and he's a fish engineer and I I don't even know how to say what he is but he said there's there's actually telescopes that that you can see where they were at so I'll just take their word for it I'm not going but Neil Armstrong is he's no doubt it's a choreographed statement but is he all the dreams and all the money's and all the aspirations and all the engineering and and now they've landed on the moon and now he's a man stepping on the moon and and he's he's got his suit on because because man when he went there couldn't live in the moon's atmosphere so he had to take earthly atmosphere to the moon that'll preach and so you and I have to take a heavenly atmosphere to live here and so Neil Armstrong as he stepped down he made this statement one small step for man one giant step for mankind whether the world wants to realize realize it or not tonight we are coming to the end of the Gentile dispensation we've come to the end of it we are just before the Tribulation Period to set in destruction lays before us Israel is expecting two prophets to come and to speak to them there will come a hundred and forty four thousand out of that group a nation that is torn with its own laws a nation that has its own perversion a nation that has eat up with all different kinds of religions and and wars amongst themselves cabinets that fight we think our cabinets fight Israel's cabinets fight much worse than ours does much war takes place and their own governments there's a reason for that man has trouble governing himself but there's coming a king are you with me there's coming a king and its King Jesus where we'll live in perfect peace now they are expecting they they are looking for a messiah and he's coming he's on his way but before they can get their Messiah we have to leave the earth there must be a rapture take place for the Gentile bride now we've had her message we've had her prophet God's vindicated him around the world seven times and he's had his picture taken with him over and over again let me just say God did extraordinary things we can talk about the miracles for months about what God did in this generation not just with the Prophet but with the ministry that came under the inspiration of that prophet that has now walked the earth you see God has laid his hands on the bride of Jesus Christ spoke her into existence gathered her out of denominational systems and and brought her unto unto himself understand this is God's doing many have tried to destroy and many have tried to ridicule many have tried to make fun of but you can't stop what God's doing no more than you could stop John the Baptist cut his head off but the mission was through you see God would step out of eternity into a realm of time because Adams race fell and they were given a substitute down through the Old Testament but the blood of bulls and goats could not make a man the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost are you with me it only covered their sins the desire didn't leave them are you with me now now there would be times to where that God would step from that realm to this room he came down and he spoke to Moses we heard last night that Moses was not ashamed because he had met that pillar of fire now let me just say when you meet that pillar of fire personally for yourself I heard brother Shannon in his prayer tonight as he prayed and I stood back in that office and I said that man can pray like that because he's met that pillar of fire we're not ashamed of where we stand in this day let's Satan rage and his kingdom scream that will be a bride and I will be one of them [Applause] through the prophets God would show an attribute of himself and there was moments that you could see God in Moses and you saw God and then there were times that you saw Moses throughout the Old Testament God the writers had to write their faults because they were only attributes of God to where God would pour a portion of himself in to allow people to see that this was the Word of God to the generation I don't know if you heard brother Tim the other day when he was preaching here and you caught it but when brother Tim was preaching he would talked about Moses and the children of Israel that left Egypt only one in five left only one in five left Egypt 20% left Egypt in the Exodus 80 percent stayed in Egypt you read the book and you think well everybody left everybody just left everybody put the token on the door and everybody just left but only 20% of the Jews that were in Egypt thought the message of the hour hallelujah and then when they got to to the to the to the border to the Red Sea and they were standing there and the greatest army was behind them let me just say it took faith to step out into the water it took real faith when 80 percent turns around and they don't even move but you've had faith to get here and now you look like you're going to be mad are you with me Jewish tradition says this that Moses stretched his right out over the sea you know in our minds we get we get Hollywood to the point to where that it just opens up so quickly but there's a family that was in the in the Jewish families that actually started marching into the water and they marched till they was up their necks and the water opened up sometimes we're challenged to take a step I want to say this to you don't get your eyes on the uncommitted they're not going don't get your eyes on the people that are only wanting to go so far they're not going but there will be a bride that will take a rapture don't even get your eyes on me keep your eyes on him [Applause] Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua that name the name of Jesus is the sum total of all that Jehovah was in the Old Testament for the Jehovah of the Old Testament it's the Jesus of the new Jesus is the sum total of every title of Jehovah the Lord our Creator the Lord the Most High God the owner the Lord the master the Lord the everlasting the Lord the provider the Lord the healer the Lord the banner our miracle the Lord our sanctification the Lord our peace the Lord the judge the Lord of Hosts the Lord our righteousness the Lord the shepherd the Lord the blesser the Lord the maker the Lord the mighty the Lord the Jehovah the Lord the ever-present the same yesterday today and forever he was he is and he always will be the Lord the purpose of what God was was promising in sending the Holy Spirit they said I wouldn't you would mark John 14 the beginning said reading through the chapter for the basis God's purpose we find in sinning the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church and we know what the Holy Spirit is we find out last night that it's God and then we think of God the Father and Jesus spoke of here his father God and the son as Jesus God the Holy Spirit as what we call it today now what does God mean that there is three individual distinct God's it means that there is one God it's one God may we say it like this all that God was he poured into Christ because he's emptied himself and he poured it into Christ and Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily we know that it's Colossians chapter 2 all that Jehovah was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ was he ported into the church not into one individual but into the entire body and then we come together in unity and we have power I want you to notice we have power what do we need power for today to live in overcoming life why don't we need power when we get sick that we can take God in His Word and step into a body a well body for the run but one day we'll step into a resurrected theophany body but what about a well body hurry with me but man said God will make your body obey your confession hallelujah for God was made flesh and dwelt among us Timothy the first Timothy 3:16 he says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh we handled him God Jehovah made flesh walked on the earth and we saw him with our eyes what percentage was that I'd say one in a million I'd say one in a million why are you bringing that up brother 1 sometimes on your campus sometimes in your facility of workplace you're the only one you're the only one and you work literally in darkness you work literally in darkness and you're the only one dressed like you're dressed and you're the only one that conducts yourself like you do and you can't hold yourself and you know that God's holding you are you with me and you know what you was and you know what your your your aspirations is to be and he's got a hold to your life and you realize it's not you doing it's much him living through you nobody else believe it it doesn't matter it doesn't matter jesus said I and my father won it didn't matter what none of the religions said because he was telling them the truth and he told them you of your father the devil I wonder I heard Andrew as he was speaking last night and forgive me for getting off-key here just for a moment but I wonder I wonder how many of us would all of a sudden feel shame if you invited brother Branham to the pool prep and that day and brother Brandon was very cordial for a bit and then all of a sudden and all of a sudden the truth starts rolling I listened to door in the door this morning brother Brad was very cordial he was much the Full Gospel businessman he was very cordial a nice listen of course I be listening to it probably hundreds of times but and I just know here he is at his cordial in his cordial way and he's being such a gentleman in about 30 minutes either they're going to be ashamed or proud they're standing with them let me just say those disciples that were standing with Jesus it was a spot that he puts them then when Jesus turned to those those well recognized priests and said you are of your father the devil your father's did eat manna in the wilderness and there everyone jabbed come on church come on Church Jesus turned around and said blessed is he that is not offended in me sometimes you'll have to make a stand sometimes you'll have to make a stand we walked into McDonald's across the mountain and we walked in and and our sisters here sister Joyce and sister Evelyn they were proud of glasses pastors you'd have thought the governor of the state had walked in and they they took us over and wanted us to sit down and they bought us an apple pie it was good and a coffee and and they wanted us to sit and talk to all their friends they weren't ashamed of us as a matter of fact they were edging on a sermon just to bid if they could have you know that's the truth but how many times does people curl and just your presence causes a conviction to come and there's another feeling not not proud but in a shame feeling crush the mystery he said the first thing was God wanted to reveal himself to the people and he couldn't do that as Jehovah God who covered all space time and eternity he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that be in that never did predict begin that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions of trillions of trillions of years of light space and go out into the infinite into the eternity how great creature that all was and that is but what he wanted to oh he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son a man how did God hide himself from Lucifer and all of his works he became man and beyond any of that he became a man a baby that was immediately called illegitimate you know you heard me talk about Moses in a pillar of fire how many people were standing there when Moses met the pillar fire when you like to write a blog about that when the critics like to have a field day with a blog about didn't Moses really meet a pillar of fire let's give you one better than that she's a teenager and she's a paused to an older man that's a widower he's a carpenter and she's on her way to get water she's not a member of any family other than the family of the mothers of Israel of our Lord Jesus Christ that Matthew were write about and put her name in it but that's only decades later but she's a teenage girl on her way and an angel meets her there and he's Charlie's and he's dark complected in him and he's got a different look about him and now she can't tell nobody are you with me and the first time she begins to tell it to a sister it's a named Elizabeth and she mentions that his name shall be called Jesus and John which is the forerunner it's dead in the mother's womb and the first name Jesus's name is mentioned brings life to that dead baby that's the power of this great creator that before that he was ever born he had the resurrection inside of that name brother Branham said I wish I had voice of a singer if I could just have the voice of a singer and just now I would love to sing one of my favorite hymns and I love what he does with this him so you be patient with me for a moment he said wrote by my precious friend William Booth club burn down from his glory everliving story my God and Savior came and Jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a stranger the god of sorrow tears in agony oh how I love him how I adore him my life my sunshine my all in all the Great Creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwelleth in him a condensation bringing us Redemption when in the dead of night not one faint hope in sight when the forked lightning came God precious tender laid aside his splinter stooping to a manageress table full of manure to be born in stooping to woo to win to save my soul he sings the course again and then he is then he is in me now he's still he's breaking off from singing for a moment and then he is in me and I am in him and in that day you'll know that I'm in my father in the father and the father in me and I in you and you and me God Emmanuel with me with us it was that Emmanuel that sing George Wright sitting there just now laying there dying when four doctors past him and it was a manual when he had to borrow a room when he had to borrow a grave he borrowed my eyes and said go tell brother George thus saith the Lord he'll did the grave of those preachers and things that's laughing at him now Helmuth that God what condescension oh how I love him he's singing in the bricks right into it about George Wright and he says they've made fun of him for doctors that laughed and made fun of him God borrowed my eyes to go tell him you did the grace of those that made fun of you I tell you this week I've had a wonderful time with that thought just that thoughts enough to preach the rest of the evening it was that Emmanuel it was that same one about the little animals the other day in the woods it was the same one about Margit Morgan sitting there all the rest it was the same one who borrowed the mental faculty the census of the body to present himself to the world today through you while the evening lights are shining god be merciful for him I'm taking so much of your time let's try it give us a corridor how I love him and he begins to sing and it begins to hum he's humming down from his glory he said now it's time for him to show his grace a mother brings a little baby here with leukemia cancer in his bloodstream that evil to that baby God here is my voice speak the word and it shall be so it's quite a statement for Lord you've said say to the mountain be moved don't doubt and it shall be in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of God I condemned this devil called leukemia the disease of this child's body it shall leave it must leave in the name of Jesus Christ may it be so here's a leather wile brother branham singing a song gets called out with a baby that's dying of leukemia and he speaks to that leukemia he's humming he stops he prays for that baby maybe it's heal right there that's what he does my sunshine my all in all the Great Creator became my Savior he sings another verse of course isn't he wonderful don't you just feel like worship him just in spirit and worship him just forget yourself now don't be ashamed the Holy Spirit is here that Holy Spirit just meekly in your own way the Great Creator became my Savior and all God's fullness dwelleth in him there you are what condensation bringing us Redemption it shall be a sign when the dead of night not one faint open sight Oh precious tender to lay the side of the spender stooping to win woo to win to save my soul he said I'll never be able to understand the riches the fullness of your spirit and don't we see him at that day when we shall come we may be sleeping in the dusk I love this we may be sleeping in the dust I may have to turn back to the original turret dust but that will not worry me one bit I know that he'll call and I'll answer and then I shall see him as he is this corruptible body will be changed and made like unto his glorious body whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself okay he says looking just the pretty little couple Adam with his great manly shoulders his hat shaggy hair hanging down his neck Eve maybe her blonde hair hanging down her back her eyes blue I love how the Prophet commentator just gives her exactly what's going on and there his great muscles and body was quivering and shaking what something had happened to them now notice as it rolls down his cheek and the tears immortal now he has to die mortal now he has to die I want to say something while I was at brother Kelly Hildebrandt's I wrote a sermon down that that I that I'll preach one day here there's only one time to be mortal you'll only be mortal this once you'll only be mortal this once he wants me make right choices don't waste today listen to the scream of the word of God as it screams out to you are you with me in that dimension it'll be no getting right with God there'll be no pleading the blood of Jesus Christ I wish I'd have done things a different it's only this and we're not promised tomorrow I wanna I want to I want to be very clear with you we're not promised tomorrow I opened the paper this week open the paper and a friend of mine and I'm talking about a real guy I'm talking about a standout in the community since he was a boy a real man and I look all the accolades of life what he did what do you accomplish what this resign or this or that it's gone it's over it's over all of his influence is done now are you with me now you'll be remembered maybe another generation another two generations and then it's gone then strong after a few generations even your name kind of disappears from the map I can't help that that's just a cycle of the life it's just gone it's it's it's just over wealth listen only in that wall that time segment grab ahold of it it's only what you do for Jesus let me to say this let me just pause just for a moment let me say we've got all got friends in other realms of life but don't let those friends influence you and your choices to serve Jesus Christ because without Jesus they're headed in one dimension and you're headed in another dimension [Applause] brother ray when this life is over the same question is settled it's settled it's a done deal it's done stepping from from this dimension stepping out you're gonna step into another body some way or another or you catching what's going on here tonight I'm talking to a group of people and I make a declaration to you we're not just a church I want to I want to say this is as firm as I know how to say we're not just a church this building looks like a church it is a church but this is not just a church or you go to church on Saturday and Sunday night like I I think it's absolutely imperative when we come to church don't forsake the assembling of God don't forsake yourself you come but let me just say this you service should go on every day your worship should go on seven days a week and bring the strength from home and work and come to church what you listen to during the week may it be food from God but the run but I feel so back slid in my spirit what are you feeding on it's very simple thing what are you feeding on my child's not growing my child isn't getting nourishment what are you feeding that child well brother on I just feel half disconnected when I come to church I don't know what anybody's talking about what are you listening to what are you listening to during the week what are you feeding your honor Fox News has no rap three-phase ESPN has no rapturing faith all of the nonsense of the world has some no rapture in faith your Facebook has no rapture in faith I got an interesting letter this week was email interesting a letter from our insurance company was talking about how pastors give references and I thought it had an interesting statement in it said never give a reference until you look at their social media pages so maybe for before now I'll just make it a just just general rule here before I make a recommendation on your job you let me borrow your phone for a few minutes rather on that's pretty difficult really it ain't nothing to what God's going to do he's going to rapture people off of the earth and he suggests God he can't rapture people that are not worthy it's not like picking flowers here well I'll take this one I'll take that one you have to have the blood band ready and that's that's let me just say this you I am what I am here or where I'm in China or in Australia I am this way seven days a week brother homers last sermon was beat you therefore ready for in such an hours you think not we're going to step into eternity one way or another very good I can just imagine if you were a real believer in the days of Paul and those men and this guy was killing some of your family some of I been in prison some of them had been stoned some of them have been burnt and now this guy is going to get papers and his carrying papers to come to your house and now he has an experience and a pillar of fire men are rounding they're around him and they're on their horses and they're carrying out their there there with him and they're under the influence of what he is but this man seemed ibly comes off of his horse and he's on the road and he and he's down and he's down on the road and pay attention now and he's on the road and his is there and now a pillar fire appears before him and he knows the Old Testament God identified himself as pillar father and he knows he's not under don't allusion and he sees the pillar fire and God begins to speak like he did through Moses and through Elisha through the pillar of fire and God says I am Jesus I am Jesus are you with me between the steps of that horse from one step to another step that predestinated seed came to life a moment ago he was an accuser of the Brethren and now he's one of them when he gets back on the horse he's a believer he got off of the horse that's an accuser he got back on the horse brother Nathanael as a believer glory to God some of us has found herself in those conditions maybe fighting it with all of our heart and then all of a sudden Jesus becomes real to us Isaiah stepped into that presence he's under the influence of Uzziah but once he comes into the presence of God he said what was me Ruth was working in a field but after a conversation in a few days she won't need to ever work in that field anymore I hope you can just stay with me for a minute I'm gonna preach I'm gonna preaching in to our series in the next 10 minutes Ruth worked in the field by what the word sent us as kinsman redeemer and she worked like a slave girl a girl that was hated in a field and she just constantly kept making steps but that kinsmen told her to just stay in that field you just stay with this message of the hour I will redeem you I'll make you this promise you stay here I'll give you plenty of food to eat it'll be spiritual food and due season stay here stay here I'll make you a promise I will do the works it doesn't matter what they say it doesn't matter the fun that they make just stay in the field just stay there he'll do the works he'll do it [Applause] he'll take you from a slave girl in a field a widower to the owner's wife now I want to capture our children's attention for a moment this might do some of you some good we've read sense a little a little child that there was a girl that becomes somewhat orphaned and she's got three stepsisters they're very mean and the stepmother very hateful and wicked she has to live in an attic for quite a long time now she met a messenger from another room and that messenger told her who she was and she took a mouse and made a horse I don't know if I got that one right thank you are you with me and she gave her the clothes to wear but be careful at midnight and she met the prince and of all the girls in the room somehow she caught his attention only a few moments before she'd been a slave orphaned girl that had been made fun of all of her life and now she's dancing with the prince but if you'll notice into even by even in the children's story how that when reality came she was back being made fun of and Satan was trying to tell her who she wasn't oh I mean that wicked with me I used this the other day and I think I'll capture some more of you just now the University of Duke some of your Duke fans the University of Duke was getting beat so bad an epic beating was taking place to him by an unknown Dean was just beating them so bad and they finally here he calls her makes the sex he calls the timeout and so in minutes that team just starts turning it completely around and wins in the final seconds all the reporters asked what did he say what did he say I bet he really tore your hands up said no no actually I got the story in Ireland you're talking about in good setting I got the story in Ireland and he said no he didn't he didn't tell him how bad they were he reminded them of who they were are you with me I want to remind you you are that invincible army that's on the earth today that will overcome Laodicea that is champions of this day here's my challenge tonight step into it come on step into it you got a few more minutes for me ten virgins he said it'll be a seeker coming no one will know when it's going to happen we're commanded to be ready and watching we don't know what hour but whatever it is will not prevent any of those back there in here for just as soon as Jesus appears the whole watch Rises better alive doesn't matter we don't meet him first we meet one another first for we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord down here shall not prevent those or hinder those which are asleep then precious ones that seal their blood seal their testimony with their blood will not prevent or hinder those that are asleep for the trumpet will sound something will take place the gospel something will sound announcing is coming the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed and fill a change come on the gray hair go out the wrinkles follow hey be changed in a moment in the twinkling eye and we shall meet our loved ones first there's mama there's Papa there's my buddy hallelujah we're ready and then together with them that our dead will be caught up in the air to meet the Lord [Applause] I would call this the last rally so here we go it puts me in mind of something like ourselves I said to the people I'm getting to a spot that I need more faith that's what I'm home for it's to get a new burst of faith it got so that you look like when you pray for people you apologize mr. devil would you please move over he said nothing to that faith has got muscles Harris on his chest when it speaks everything else shuts up go go in mr. devil you move out get out of here I'm the son of God I'm Commission of God leave them alone you have no apology to the devil nothing to do with him not ashamed of the Word of God not ashamed of our Commission this is not ashamed of who we are that's right we're sons of God commissioned to cast Satan out we owe no apologies for that we have them we have muscles and hair on our chest that's my faith who is this science circumcised devil that has challenged the sons of God today we will cut your head off and destroy Satan's Kingdom when that inspiration of the Holy Spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body come to your confession if you say you're a drunkard and want a drink don't worry you will soon be one if you say you're a sinner you want to sin you'll be right into that if you're say you're a Christian and believe it all along God will bring your testimony we'll bring right into it if you believe in healing and believe God has healed you confess it and God will make your body obey your confession [Applause] for he's the high priest of your confession sitting on the right hand of the Father now with his own blood to make intercessions for inner confession upon anything that he died for wouldn't it be wonderful tonight if everybody would come in a prayer alone and say I am a Christian I have no condemnation I know that my heart condemn me not something tells me that tonight's the end of my suffering are you listening or you listening wait your neighbor up I want to read this quote and I want you to get it wouldn't it be wonderful to not if everybody would come in that prayer line and say I'm a Christian I have no condemnation I know that my heart condemn me not something tells me to tonight it's the end of my suffering you're going away from here with something no matter how much you come in emotion how much you do it it will work until that perfect faith is manifested and identified itself in you as a substance and when it staff nothing it's gonna shake you from it I figured you'd be dancing but hey maybe you need another quote if you had cancer and the doctor told you yesterday that you'd be dead before Monday morning all of your heart your respiration is gone the cancers eat you up your blood streams become completely cancer whatever it is and something came with this substance of genuine faith perfect faith what's made acceptance in you you would laugh in the doctors face [Applause] oh brother on but my cancer my my arthritis and my high blood pressure and my don't claim it don't claim it don't let it rule over top of you come on church God's a healer well brother on what if I die from it it'll be your portal from this room to that room but it won't have victory over top lane you it only becomes a doorway for you to step through [Applause] you'd like to be like that ole Elijah when he walked up and down before the idol and said why don't you call out a little louder you talk about confidence why don't you call out a little louder why don't you call out louder were you doing that for brother run I'm gonna give this to somebody I'm gonna give it to somebody somebody that really needs it because when we was in China they were giving us cows and weed wiper Brown throw him down and they'd come grab him and let me just tell you that was phenomenal testimonies that took place one of them a man died later he later died his little boy died are you with me now his little boy died and he remembered it he got one of them towels and he went later don't let this boy and that boy came back to life [Applause] boo dabble [Applause] you'd be like that Oh Elijah when he walked up and down before the idol said why don't you call out a little louder maybe he's pursuing he knowed what he was doing because God had told him it was going to happen and he said let the God but answers by fire be God they poured water on the altars they cut themselves they done everything they called out - bail bail answer us bail answer us and Elijah was just as calm as he could be and he said call out a little hotter maybe he's pursuing maybe he's on a fishing trip maybe he's doing something else he's out there somewhere and he just made fun of them because he knew something was going to happen and watch when he got everything in order and he walked out there and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel he never called him by his name Jacob shankster he called him Israel Prince with and when I come to that point tonight I thought about this is me there was a time when I was a stinker when I was a shyster when I was a nothing but when Jesus came I stepped from that realm to another realm whether I feel him or unknown feel him or who does another miracle or another miracle I've seen hundreds and thousands of miracles by now he don't have to do anything else for me but he's promised me lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name you'll cast out devils he's going to continue the work ain't my doings it's God's doing I want to ask you tonight as you sit here you said here tonight and maybe this would be the witch it is the last time it's your pastor speak to you for a couple of weeks and I would have any words for you to help you get through the next few weeks I want to leave you with these words are you ready you see a lot of things can happen in a few weeks I'll be here next week with brother Joe and me cheering him on probably at the picnic oh I'm gonna give a talk a sermon prayer line around the fire God just does supernatural things the Peter is standing with Jesus it's coming to a vital hour I'd say it's a kind of a battle hour or at now because God was moving from Jew two Gentiles but it's got to have a spokesman that will take them in the baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and the spokesman really don't know who he is yet and the Lord said Simon Simon the whole Satan hath desired to have you that he might sift you as wheat I love these next words but I pray for thee that's our faith you didn't you you think Jesus didn't see him deny thrice sure he did did Jesus give up on him no it did will this man be the spokesman on the day of Pentecost absolutely he'll stand until that this Jesus whom you crucified God has made him both Lord and Christ you crucified him but God made him both Lord and Christ now he's going to stand down he's going to preach to them of who he is and now for you to get salvation is you got to repent so there's some stepping you got to do and you got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and then you should receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promises unto you and to your children as many as are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call so there were some steps from just being associated with Jesus and being an outspoken disciple to a failure till now feel with the very life of God and becomes a spokesman of the church and now when it comes to his time to die and they're going to crucify him he said don't let me even don't let me be crucified like the Lord turn me upside down if you had cancer and the doctor told you yesterday that you'd be dead before Monday all of your heart your respiration is gone the cancers eats you up your blood streams completely completely cancer whatever it is and something's come with this substance of this genuine faith perfect faith was made a substance in you just a little while ago brother
