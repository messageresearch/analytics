dark spirit that would try to hinder Lord there's always in the service the enemy comes to kind of confuse our minds or get our minds but let us focus on the word today and Lord anoint our lips in a special way we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen God bless you you can be seated last week we so enjoyed brother Jason Jackson being with us and amen all that took place afterwards and God just came Among Us and confirmed the word and it was such a such a special time and we sure love him with all of our hearts next weekend I just want to just drop a note and and uh I I want to sometimes as we have special speakers well I don't want you to think it's just just enough special speaker just like brother Jason we don't want to miss we don't want to miss what's going on brother Tom Ray and brother Michael Ray means a whole lot to us as a family and uh we so love them I go a long way back with them and in the years don't want to tell you how many years we go back but brother Tom has been a special friend of mine so many so many years and sister Joan of course is brother bis's uh granddaughter and for and for for to be some time with them I was able to speak in their camp meeting so many years and uh that's always been a special time brother Bisal was the one that called when I was in the coma and uh God dealt with him early that morning to call Sister Connie and she was actually brother Matthew was in one hospital and I was in the other and he told her that that that the Lord had spoke to him that morning that I would be the speaker at Mount Baker camp and that was the first time that they had bought that camp and so so anyway we we she came she came to the hospital with that news and it would be that day that that they would say that I wouldn't live but she had heard another voice and so we've had special times together whether it was in whether it was in North Carolina at the camp meetings we were together many times and then at uh and Murphy's Boro at at brother Billy Andrews so many times and and then when we went to Switzerland I was with Switzerland I know of nine or 10 years I was with him there in Switzerland and brother Tom was with us in on a few of those meetings and then I've spoke with brother Tom in uh in Switzerland as well then in North Carolina as well and then we went to China and that was one of the highlights of my life to be able to speak speak with brother Tom Ray brother Murphy Wong in in China we saw so many phenomenal Miracles take place and then the protection hand of God and so we we're so honored to have them coming our way we've worked on this a long time amen and if I could tell you how long we've worked on it we we've worked on it quite a long time but it's hard to arrange a family of 19 people to come and so if your seat gets reserved next week don't get offended at brother Tom we got to set them somewhere and so amen I'm sure these guys have already made that decision and they didn't make that decision because you're setting there they just they had to make a decision to put 19 people in together we want them as a family to sit together and so brother Michael Ray he and I have a special bond because he was working in the church office and had never an intention to be a preacher as a matter of fact that was the last thing we wanted to do but I went and I don't know what year that was but I went to their camp and God had spoke to me that I would deal with brother Michael and uh that God was calling him to preach the gospel and so I actually had to call him into the prayer line and when I told him what I told him he began to scream no no no so the next day he came to the to the house at brother Toms to try to talk me out of it and I said well I didn't call you amen and I said well I I tell you what you do you you go to brother Ed and just as a confirmation you have brother Ed to tell you that brother Ron was wrong and so when you hear brother Michael Ray you you know that we have been a part of his life and and then I was I was blessed to be at his his or ordaining uh to be a minister and uh God has blessed us together there and uh I just am I'm I'm actually thrilled that they will stand in this pull ppit amen then brother Aaron Oglesby which I was a part of his ministry and he'll be here in a few maybe a month or two and so we're looking forward to having brother Aaron you know God has the best amen he just absolutely has the best and so amen we're so thankful for that brother Chester is not here this morning but he wrote me a note this morning his first note to me and so brother his name is Chester Theodore Bennett and that you know when I saw him they were trying to call him something else and and I saw him Chester fit and when I heard Teddy when I heard his middle name Theodore you and I have a special link to Theodore and so so I think it's going to work out he's coming to move and be a part of our our our our lives here and so we're just looking forward to having him in the body of Christ here as well so glad to have each and every one of you and uh we love you with all of our hearts and we're just all in this Symphony together amen we're so glad we're so glad to be together and we so love you with everything that's within us isn't he good to usen brother Tim prit was at at Oklahoma last week with brother Matt Morris and I don't know exactly where they were but they were sharing stories backwards and forwards and brother Matt has been a friend of ours for such a long time and and he told him a story and we've heard it from a different angle but I I like this one I hope you don't mind me sharing it he said brother Matt Morris told of going to Indiana and was in a restaurant and a man over heard them talking and asked that asked if they were speaking of William brandom and they replied yes so he introduced himself as Mr furnish I hope I'm saying that right his grandfather owned an ice cream store the man said that that Red's family had a boy upstairs who had polio and hadn't been able to walk brother Brandon would would come by and spend time with them and sometimes he'd play checkers with them one day he asked if he could go upstairs and see the boy and pray for him and they said yes and the mother took him upstairs and left him there with the boy and went back down to the shop after a while brother brandham came back downstairs and said with when you're setting the table tonight set an extra plate amen they were thinking that brother brandom was coming for supper she sat out her very best dishes and she prepared the meal and they waited for brother Brandon but he didn't come red prayed and begin the meal and about the time they there was a sound that was heard from the stairs and this boy that was afflicted with polio came walking down the stairs for supper Hallelujah Lord the man that was told the story he said I know that to be true because I am the son of the boy who was healed and unless he was healed I wouldn't be here give the Lord a great big hand for that Hallelujah so it's always good to have the angel of the Lord come by your way isn't it I just think it's kind of neat and in that story brother Brandon would went would go by them and all of his busyness of schedule brother Doug just think about it all of his busyness of schedule and all the Mysteries being revealed he went by and played Checkers amen I think that's pretty cool I read through a scripture and I want to share it with you again because it will have more meaning to you a little later this is Isaiah chap 2 and verse 4 and he shall judge among the the Nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plow shears and their Spears into pruning Hooks and Nation shall not lift up sword against Nation neither shall they learn War anymore David would say something like this and bringing it to an individual level Psalms 139 and verse 13 for thou H has possessed my Reigns thou H has covered me with the my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made I'd like for you to read the scripture with me I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and my soul knoweth right well I want you to just hold on to that scripture who made us wasn't our mother and father we came from them but actually God watched over even our natural realm well brother Ron I've never seen a miracle look in the mirror look in the mirror our family heritage has a lot of horror stories in it Wars and plagues and coming to America as immigrants and coming across on very difficult situations and living in a land and listen let me just say when the forefathers came into this place it was I'm sure it was a beautiful place but it had to be civilized and it had to be brought to where we could live here we're going to go back to that kind of a place uh Heaven's going to be a special place and he says for I am fearfully and wonderfully made and he said my substance was not hid from thee when I was in secret and curiously rought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance and yet being unperfect and in and in Thy Thy book and all my members were written listen God knew the good and the bad which in continuance was fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me God's thoughts are eternal am God's thoughts are Eternal and we are actually the materialized thought of God sitting right here in this building today and he says oh God how great is the sum of them and if I could count them they are more in number than the sand that's quite a statement and when I awake I am still with thee brother renom says and we have seen his star and we have came to worship he said did you ever see them when they were fixing to mold a bell some famous Bell for a church Chim or or something they had to give it a certain ding you see if if you're ringing a Chim it takes a certain range for every bail he says and it takes a certain materials to go in there for so much brass and so much steel and so much of the other ores to get into this Bell and if it's just straight brass it won't ring right it's got to have all kinds of ma materials throwed into it to make it ring the right T kind kind of a tone and the man who has put the the mold up and set up the mold he knows exactly what it takes to go in that CPA and he said and what it takes to go into that metal to make that Bell that bell ring that tone now notice now brother random is going to come to us he said God is our great Cooper am God is the great Refiner's furnace that wor he has to put things upon us and trials notice these words they're important to us this morning and trials and persecutions and things to mold it together to make our testimony ring I'm going to read that again because this is the important sentences of this sermon God is our great KOA God is the he is the great Refiner's furnace that where he has has to put things to Upon Us trials and persecutions and things to mold it together to make our testimony rank for a certain time and a certain note that he wants to ring out every day this week the Lord spoke to me and dropped this in my heart in a very Sovereign way and he begins to deal with me and I I don't know how to put it in words exactly but I'll do my best and we would just call cancer a wound and he said this wound is causing you to be driven with purpose like never before taking that thought I go back to four years ago when he spoke to us remember he spoke if you will trust me I will use you like never before I don't know if you realize it today but as we begin to go into this thought your life is the interpretation of this message being lived out there will be many people that never read a book or never listen to a tape or never even know the M name wegan brandom but they will look at your life and it is because you're you're attached to the Sheep music your life is a musical instrument through which God wants to live now a musical instrument you're gifted all gifts come from God and a musical instrument actually becomes an extension of your own life and through that gift you play to the world now I if we could just think about this for a moment Satan has did everything that he can do to discredit the message the messenger the ministry of this day and he's done everything maybe even possibly this week to try to discourage you to deflect your your attention away from what's really focused on the word of God and if he can and if he can do that and if you can get your mind on something that's carnal or just stuff just stuff he will keep you from your life source and he will do that and I I as I think about this even in our prayer we'll actually pray very very selfishly and I I want to be very honest right here I learned very quickly in my trial not to pray for myself cuz I found out the more that I prayed for others the more God did for me now your music is a living music being played out a few few years ago before cancer I spoke a sermon on the hurt will not destroy the music and as I look back at it as I look back God was speaking to me almost in a prophetic way as I was speaking the hurt will not destroy the music and that was before the trial came now if we can just look at it he's did everything that he can to stop the music in your life but if we remember it's not us but we're bone of his bone we're life of his life the bride is she as him we're not just mechanics but we're also the Dynamics of it maybe you don't understand the Dynamics maybe you don't understand the word worship maybe you don't understand the spark of the fire but we need him it's more than just knowing quotes and knowing the message and having intellectual property that is important but we need him Hallelujah something phenomenal happened last night I saw a streak of fire as you guys was singing the song get in the room I want to be in the room if I got to tear a tile off of the top of the roof I want to be in the room I want to be in the room with him are you with me now these decades since the messenger he left and his fleshly lips were sealed this message has went around the world and and uh it took men to get it around the world it took men with great vision and we've been a part of that but let me just say this to you we don't do it to build schools or to even Kingdom build we do it that the message that is seeds and its words has life in it and then that life comes alive and whether you go to Europe or Africa or to to to Mexico or south America no matter where you go it's the same spirit and when you meet people it's just exactly like you've known them all of their lives just in a few minutes you feel like you've known them all of their life and whether you realize that or not you step from eternity into time and one day we'll go back into eternity again and we all are a body around the world and we need one another we need one another and so as a body of Believers around the world we're playing out the interpretation of this message this message is more than a book or a tape or a picture on the wall or laws of dos and don'ts this message is Jesus Christ living among us and living in US I pray that we can live such a life though people won't see us I turned the corner I went to see Titus play baseball was it this week this week and and quite a number was from the church here was there and so brother r i don't believe in those things well brother brandham said while you boys are in town why don't you go over to Louisville and take off take in a baseball game so anyway I I went to see Titus to to play and I I rounded the corner and Donna who is who is your neighbor help me with a last name bis and she she may she watches all of her services and so I tell you hello and she's a part of her congregation she watches every service and and she she begin to just quickly respond and quickly begin to talk and and she sees something she sees something real and then when I turned around there was another lady standing she actually works at Green Valley and uh she was standing there and so she watches his service and so and so anyway we begin to talk a bit and we talked and her husband Dallas came and and we begin to talk and we stood there for a few minutes and and then I turned around and there was somebody else talking and they said that they watched the services and and then there was another one standing there brother Ron well I didn't know them and they begin to talk about we enjoy your services amen we're not alone we're not alone here amen the symphony is playing aren't you glad to be a part of it aren't you glad now we know this message is is Christ revealed to us more than just in churchianity when we hear the titles titles have incredible meaning to us brother BR would stand and speak sermons like the Mighty God unveiled that sermon couldn't have been preached in any other age till this age when he preaches the Masterpiece and he and you just you just know how he takes those things and the token and he begins to talk about it more than a chemical life but it's a real life must be on display in our lives when he goes through the seals and men had not been allowed to touch it but as as he spoke last night the waiting was over and God opened the book for the Bride of Jesus Christ so you'd have Sheep music to play and we begin to realize that as the horse riders rode and God sent an anointing on the people to overcome those hor Riders are you with me and the Thunders were revealed and and the church ages let me just say as I as I was looking at my church age book this morning looking at it listen of all of the churches of the world they don't have a book like that right then he begins to speak a prophetic message called things that are to be because words Visions become words and then they become reality then he speaks a sermon like Shalom where I'm drawing these sermons from invisible Union of the bride and we begin to be United with Jesus Christ here on the earth Christ the mystery and Christ revealed in his own word and then he speaks leadership and he speaks that a couple of different different times and then he speaks communion the last service that before his lips will be sealed the last service you can't orchestrate forgive me but you can't orchestrate a life like what's lived many people and I I just want to drop this to you many people looked at brother brandom and called him God right and I I have to say this they saw so much of God it confused them but listen he wasn't God he wasn't wanting us to worship him he said if you love me call me brother and he said I can't be proud of my Earthly mother and father are you with me he had a love for them but he said he said there's he said but but my heavenly father and if I could take that and go to the scripture we realize that we're fearfully and wonderfully made and God watched over El every element that would go into our lives not just the great elements but the discouragements the wars that we would have to go through now sometimes when we come to it there's events I I thought it was so powerful what you said last night on the waiting and catching and being aware there was boys on the road to EMAs brother randam would speak a sermon called when their eyes are open and he says he said there they were walking with him and he expounds the scriptures of he had fulfilled all of the prophecy of the scriptures brother Bram said six hours he spent with them but at the end he was getting ready to make his way on further and they constrained him they put their hands on him and pulled him into the house and then when he broke the bread they recognized that's him I want to just say this to you don't come to a church service wherever you go to church don't go to service just for another service don't put in time just for more time every one of us have a part to play don't take it for granted these times won't always be here this is passing and it's going way too quick and I want you to understand don't allow it to just slip by and and oh I missed it or I should have paid more attention all of you went to school now you wish you'd have paid more attention I'm afraid too many people are going to come to church and and miss it now God's had Visions all the way down through especially through the Gentile dispensation whether it was Paul irius Columba and then under the inspiration of that there was Ministries that rose up powerful Ministries and they played their part we're at the finish I don't know how I can say it to you but we're at the finish and I want us to just think about this thoughts how many more services do we have left how many more services do we have left none of us are even promised tomorrow none of us are promised tomorrow all of us in our mortal flesh are dying I don't I don't mean to be a bear of bad news but all of us are dying but when we're in this space of life I don't want it just to go through and waste it I think one of the greatest failures is a man Wast his life I'm sure we can see the guy that's WI a beer bottle he Wast his life for a drug addict in his he Wast his life just been a selfish individual all about himself or an idolator waste his life but I I I think something what about sitting in church we all the people that heard the message of the hour and they were there to see a miracle or to be a part of a crowd or be a part of an anointing going forward where are they at today are you with me don't waste your opportunity whether you set in this church or or whatever church that you set in don't waste your opportunity sorry sometimes I become emotional right there in a spot I want you to understand that God's purpose will take place it will take place he will have a bride yes he will well brother Ron I I I don't I I don't I I just have many disagreements okay it's not for you brother Ron I don't think it's ought to be this way and I don't think it ought to be that way okay it's not for you well I don't want to dress a certain way it's not for you I can't surrender myself to it it's not for you are you with me listen when the wheat gets throwed in the air and the wind blows there's a lot of cha gets blowed away right people walked up to the ark and they had all kind of scoffing and all kind of mocking it wasn't for them but I'll tell you what it was there was a flood well brother r i somebody sent me a letter the other day scolding me for preaching the Rapture before tribulation Hey listen I got news for you I don't want to go through the tribulation amen obviously it was somebody didn't know anything about the message but I've heard a voice and the sheet music does not play for me in the tribulation period I'm not going to be a part of that are you with me but for the ones that says it's not for me or my trials are too big or my Situation's too big and I can't focus on the word I want to tell you the Sheep music for the tribulation is is coming I had a cousin it was a young man he died of a heart attack I actually took my business over and chimney sweeping many years ago and he told me he said what should I do his name was Rick and I said well Rick I don't know quite how to tell you if this message is not for you you can't build a bomb shelter deep enough you can't get enough grains of gold that'll sustain you amen and as a matter of fact if you live in the United States it's not going to be a good place to be at so I don't know maybe move move to Mexico now you think there's an immigration problem coming now you just wait till they stop dropping bombs it's going to be the other way I don't want to get political on you now but 7 million people have came to America since Biden's been in office that's greater than 36 States well can you imagine how many is going to head that way this ain't going to be the spot it ain't going to be the spot to to be at just drop in that for you that's just good for your flesh now I want you to understand God has determined our our our ways he don't force nothing on you but but we are the thoughts of God that's right maybe your parents said I'll have two children or I'll have three children or I'll have five children or I'll have 13 children good luck but but more than parents thinking about having a boy or having a girl or I'd like to have another little boy to play with that little boy or I'd like to have another little girl to to play with that little girl or you know I'd like to have a little girl I'm I'm getting 45 years old and I'd like to have another little girl and uh you know I just want to always change diapers and so hey that's good if that's I don't have the nerve for it anymore but but listen more than all of that we're the thoughts of God I want you to think about it he made you so tall he made you so fluffy he made your eye color a certain way he actually even designed your personality and he did all of that so you would be a certain way and he would drop certain gifts in your life and then when you was in the world maybe you was raised in a Christian home and you wanted to experiment a little bit and God begin to deal with your life there was nothing in the world that would satisfy you amen and God begin to brood over you and and begin to pull on you and you begin to realize this is the only real thing in life and he began to deal with you it has Eternal value to it and you begin to realize that God made me a certain way and let me just say this the quicker you can come to that realization of his identity living on the inside of you the more peaceful you will become amen I know I'm preaching slower this morning seem like taking my time but I don't I feel like I don't have it so much energy this morning and I want to get through this so I apologize now let me just say this to you we have a lot of thoughts about our life we have a lot of thoughts about our life we made a lot of decisions before we came to the Lord some were good decisions some were really bad decisions some decisions come with great cost some scars our life but in spite of all of that that Jean seed that laay down on the side of you God had a season for you to come and when you came to it and the word became alive inside of you you found your place you found your position sure I'm sure there was a lot of dottling around in all of us as we we're trying to learn to walk and we're trying to learn to talk and we're trying to learn different different things and the spirit of God is coming on our life you say well I don't know about that brother Ron well how many of you still struggled to find time to pray well I found you all of us struggle with sticky nature all of us well brother on I got born again and I got filled with the Holy Ghost and that's gone how far away brother brandom said it would always be behind him Waring always worrying well brother Ron you're going to have to give me you're going to have to give me me a quote well let me give you more than a quote let me give you real testimony of brother brandham standing in a gap and he's been with brother bisco honey and he's looked at the mountains and he's enjoyed the peacefulness and there's no phone calls and there's no prayer lines and there's no difficulty and he's been there for a few weeks and and brother random begins to make choices I think I'm going to move here and he on his way back home he's peaceful he's driving home it's quite a long way and he's deciding listen he's a prophet it's responsibility the Bri around the world and he as a human being is making a choice and listen he's honest you'll find yourself in these next minute brother brandham wants to go there where there's peace he wants to take his family there he maybe wants to run a store a country store there brother Bisal said I was with him and he said I never heard him utter any of those words but that was wrestling in his mind and then God spoke to him you carry out your plans your wife will leave you you won't have your children and then God said something to him I'll leave you oh I'm so thankful for leadership I'm so thankful for a spirit of God that will turn us to way to where he is our entire focus a lot of people leave you in your life D but let me just say I don't want God to ever leave me now I want you to think God has had plans not just for your life here but he's got plans for you to walk on streets of go are you with me I'm going to skip some things Brother David iers from Belgium I don't know if any of you remember him but he came here after Easter last year from Belgium he's a wonderful young man I I met him when he was a young struggling Minister and he was struggling to find his way there was troubles in the church the church was unstable and he was just trying to find his place he wanted to be a help wherever he could be I actually had breakfast with him one morning and God dropped in my heart even where he was at trying to find his way that the young man that was sitting across the table from me was a futural general in the army of the Lord now I didn't share that with him but I just knew in my heart it would be in a meeting in Switzerland to where the church was in t such turmoil until it looked like the whole thing was going to fall apart they actually went into a hotel room and they just was looking for it to fly apart but God had bigger plans and the Holy Spirit Dropped In the room and Men begin to ask forgiveness and for leadership of the church and in just a little while and maybe in the coming months Brother David iers would become the pastor There Brother David iers has been a real pillar in Europe I don't know if you hear this or not uh they listen quite a bit but he came here and we didn't know this part about him but after the meeting was over we was having special fellowship and there had been some special moments in fellowship and we would just weep and cry and presence of the Lord and we were sitting at the table and and you know he said begin to say that I I play a saxophone I didn't know that about him he said I play a saxophone and he was just beginning to talk about his love for the saxophone and and you know he he said but he said I have a desire he said I've put money away from a long time but I'll probably never be able to afford it and he said but there's a saxophone that's built and it's built and it he said in World War II all of the shells were shot and all of the brass was taken and the metals that were taken there's a man got inspired in the 80s to start taking re and recycling bombs and shells and and start making saxophones out of this material and this man was inspired from Isaiah chapter 2 and verse 4 and it was inspired that the that the plow shears and and the pruning Hooks and and the swords be melted down to be used for something useful and would not learn the ways of War anymore and he said that musical instrument is so inspirational of what was of war and killing Humanity now beautiful music can be played through it and he told it in such a way until brother Andrew spoke up and said well how much is the saxophone and he said I'm afraid to tell you and we we are very patient people the conversation didn't go nowhere until he told us and brother Andrew and myself paid for that saxophone now I don't know how many even know that till today and we're not I'm not wanting any credit whatsoever but I think about the people that were killed and the war thank you you guys are you guys are out of this world did you set it up you're you're [Applause] awesome there he is hold that just for a minute I want you to that's in actually in the shop you can't tell but all right get it together run somebody was inspired to make more than just a a a saxophone but I'm going to take it the materials from war and it doesn't have to mean death anymore but it can mean life the other day when Andrew was preaching and I've rewatched it Andrew over and over again Brother David sitting there playing the music and you can hear the music playing and I thought listen this man I don't know how many he's made but it fell into the hands and we were a part of it it fell into the hands of a bride preacher and it's more than just preaching but it's a life being blurred through that instrument an amazing grace through that instrument is more than just a [Applause] song Give the Lord a hand right there you can leave that up for a bit Paul writes about himself 2 Corinthians chap 11 and verse 22 are they Hebrews so am I are they Israelites so am I are they seed of Abra Abraham so am I are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more and labors more abundant in Stripes above measure impr prisonment more frequent in depths of of the Jews five times I reive 40 Stripes save one I want you to ask yourself if Paul was your pastor the wounds that he was receiving yet is a messenger of the hour Paul is your pastor where's your pastor at he's in prison he's in prison what did they do with him today they beat him 39 strikes there was no quitting him there was no quit in him Thrice I was beaten with rods once I was stoned Thrice I sh suffered shipwreck a night and a day I had been in the deep in Journeys often in Perils of waters and and Perils of robbers and Perils of my own countrymen and perils by the Heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils amongst false brethren in weakness and painfulness in watching offence in hunger and in thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness besides those things are without and that with cometh on me daily the cares of all the church notice these next words who is weak I wish I could scream it till my neighbors could hear it who is weak he's just wrote you a short story who is weak and I am not weak oh Hallelujah who is weak and I am not weak who is offended and I burn not I'm going to quit church cuz he didn't shake my hand if I must needs to Glory I glory of the things which concern my infirmity the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed forever and knoweth that I lie not did the message get through did 14 books of the Bible get written did he say I didn't have the energy to do it then he said I feel like quitting I'm not preach another sermon I've got good excuses here sorry I've been laying a foundation here I am if you think about David's life and let's just get a little scheme of it you think about David's life he went from a boy that was forgotten to a man that became a giant slayer amen a man that became king and being a king he wasn't perfect and he became an adulter and then he became a murderer and the blood of the house came on his home and much turmoil did he quit no sir his Focus was on being King right his Focus was on got to build a temple and if I can't build a temple I'm going to gather the material from all over the world if I can't do the job God if you're stopping me there I'll help I'll help Solomon when God spoke to Moses we know the story story Moses quickly said I can't speak well he had an impediment of speech and the impediment was so bad till he had to have a an interpreter with him so people could understand what he was saying did it stop the message you said it more miracles took place after 80 years old all of that happened to him 80 years now in his past having great difficulty getting people to believe that he was the prophet of the hour he didn't have the Holy Ghost so he smoked the rock twice that didn't destroy the music it didn't destroy the music brother Ron but the scar of my life you don't know what I'm I'm preaching to you this morning if I the case I'm preaching to you I hope you get it I I don't know who I'm preaching to I've actually sent out word for three different individuals to listen to this sermon today I'm sure your difficulty is hard but don't let it take the focus off of the sheet music am Joseph's life from a boy to vice president of of Egypt what a journey that it was we read a men like John Wesley I took time to read his story his daily biography let me just drop a couple things he was cast out of his own church they didn't want him no other Church want wanted him so he took a soap box and began to preach on the street he didn't have a church big enough after a while and he stood listen for those people that don't want a motion listen to this words he stood while preaching and the Holy Ghost so fell until 10,000 people were slain in the spirit when after wave and they fell under the anointing of God I think next year when we turn the clocks back we'll just have singing long you guys got to get with me promise you that well for those that are just kind of trying to make it through the service listen to this one again John Wesley got he couldn't understand what's happening here and he went among them trying to get them to set up this message is important I want you to hear it but they were slain in the spirit that's the effects of this message this message is so powerful it's so Supernatural it transforms your life your nature your attitude one day he'll transform the cells of your body [Applause] he could have said I'm not big enough he's 5 foot one he was redheaded I couldn't count the times that he was stoned and left for dead let me just give you a drop of it he said said while I preached the insurrectionist came and begin to Stone me and I fell under the stonings and after a while it stopped and I laid there until they wasn't throwing stones anymore and I shook myself I shook myself and I roll the stones off of my body and determined in my heart I'll be back here tomorrow I'll be back here tomorrow preaching the same sermon over and over listen it didn't happen to him just one time it happened to him over and over and over again don't tell me about your excuses quit your whiny box no matter where you're at in the world quit your whiny box let's play the music let's play the [Applause] symphony Fanny Crosby who wrote Blessed assurance Jesus is mine who wrote I shall know him by the nail prints in his hand who wrote past me not oh gentle savior and wrote 8,000 more songs lived a pulper refused to to play worldly music and would have been offered incredible amounts of money when asked about her blindness she said oh blessedness for when my eyes come open for the first thing that I will see will be Jesus Christ you're talking about living with purpose they were making fun of her as she's walking up into her upstairs apartment how will you know him how will you know him and she wrote a song to it I will know him by the nail prints in his hands she took what they made fun of her for she took the enemy's sword and turned it against him now I turn buddy Robinson knew that he couldn't be a Christian without the Holy Ghost in his life I've actually stood where buddy Robinson preached let me just say this you he knew I couldn't do it he said I knew I couldn't do it I had to have the Holy Ghost and one day in a field he draw a circle around himself and he said God if you don't fill me with the Holy Ghost when you come back you'll find my bones laying right here this is more important than a job it's more important than a career it's more important than [Applause] families well that clock says I get to preach another hour and 10 minutes Hall and brother bis's family you'll meet many of them next week but one of his granddaughters is a girl named Ella and I'm sure go hear this Ella was born and there was a stroke happened at Birth and she become a girl I'm just going to say it plain life sometimes is not pretty I saw the pictures through the years of crawling like an animal and it was a victory for her to be able to crawl like an animal and her mom would send pictures and video did it stop her Ella has grown up and she's she sat here in this church Ella's been very attached and I have a great love for her but Ella has turned out to be a such a beautiful woman until she could be a model anywhere in the world stupid devil Ella has got character she didn't have to go through the hall of school to get as a learn Behavior but she has such a prayer life and such a dedication for god listen I've sat and listened to her quote scriptures and quotes for over an hour with such power and such character I marveled I marveled here she's a girl girl she didn't let it stop her I'll tell you what Satan since you want to afflict his service I'll tell you this you couldn't stop her you couldn't stop her she didn't have a pity party she's never said feel sorry for me sure she's been through depression and sure she's been through every Agony and every mental condition will I be a forever child will I be a child that'll never be able to accomplish anything in life now a college student when your focus is on the Sheep music just play your instrument just play I don't know Ella well the next one you will know I met him as a younger man we've been friends for a long time he didn't let his disability stop him he walked on his ankles with his feet turned in until he was able to have surgeries to straighten it up to where he could walk now and now his heels are his ankle those feet scream every day I have known him as a friend a long time and I've never heard him say I quit I have never heard Tim PR I've never heard him say feel sorry for me but he took that disability and let him drive him to studying the word of God and defeating every devil in hell and overcoming this leodys in world and get a bride ready for Rapture are you with me and in the last few years when God chose to take his Queen a home to be with the Lord he didn't stop and say I feel sorry for me I'm I'm through all these different kind of things let me just say this you it drove him to a higher level no discredit to the past but he preaches better now than ever before more stupid devil it causes you to be more focused and the more wounded you become the more focused on every punch you throw Give the Lord a good hand right there for the next one I'm humbled and honored and don't I don't know what the next feelings would be but there was a athlete in t in Canada his name was Terry Fox Terry Fox being an athlete extremely Olympic Athlete cancer struck him and they amputated a leg and put a prosthesis on it he could have said well I'll I'll get an office job he could have said well I'm just going to sit at home on my couch and not do anything but he said cancer has drove me to this this purpose I'm going to make people aware that the that the research needs help and his goal was 24 million people in Canada at that time if I can get a dollar from each one of them I can raise $24 million so he started out on the east side of Canada and begin to run and when when he ran he ran a marathon every day every day not just one day but he ran it every day he could have had excuses he could have said I'm tired he could have said it's not worth it as a matter of fact there was very little attention when he started out very little if you know anything about his story now 60 different countries run Terry Fox runs he was doing it to try to try to get awareness to cancer that was trying to take his life and as he ran across he became more of a celebrity as he ran and he was in great he was in great great City places and he was celebrated as he came he came to the North toward the end of his race and all of a sudden cancer moved from that part of the body and moved into the lungs and he had to stop the race 9 months later he would succumb to cancer and this is when the article was written and I don't know have a have a Time State damp stamp on it but the last last recording was not 24 million was raised but 850 million dollar have been raised in his name and in his honor amen I'm telling you that story because all through Canada people have sent me pictures of the Terry Fox run they're going to run at it in that day and they're running for run Spencer the other day there was a marathon took place and Michael Dexter we'll see him in a few days Michael Dexter had entered a a a Race Brook

for brother Ron for brother Ron it wasn't a beautiful day it was pouring water like out of a boot it was cold and Louis Iana did it stop him no sir let me just read this to you Brooke came in second in her age group and she said I'm doing this for brother Ron Drew came in third in his age group when the devil had determined he'll never walk God had a different plan and they videoed as they ran and and they begin to talk to me about the rain but we're going to keep going we're going to keep going for you brother Ron we're going to keep going and I was watching it almost like live because they were sending me video as they were doing it and my heart was just busting and some of the precipice of this sermon if you're playing in the national Symphony and you've got your entire family with you you ride in the same cars you ride in the same van you got a tuxedo on rest of your family family is dressed nice well you got a tuxed to one and you Small Talk maybe it's about a biscuit that you had this morning maybe it's about the dinner that you had last night but now as you're beginning to get toward the building it's you and your instrument and you shake hand and do hugs and and you go to the back part of the building to be let in by certain special people and they let you in and you carry your little saxophone box and you walk in all your family sitting in the watching area and you come in you take your place you get your musical instrument and now everybody's watching and you come in and you know the Sheep music music by heart it doesn't cause you to be jealous when other people are playing and it's not your part as a matter of fact you appreciate they playing the more you know about music the more that guy like this appreciates the drum and he appreciates the piano and he appreciates the flute he ain't trying to take the show over that's right he's just glad to be a part of it amen I'm driving now listen we're not here to be Stars we're not here to be better than anybody else we should just appreciate and God's Great rich in Mercy that we can just be on the stage all of us have a backstory all of us have to struggle with life yesterday I was sick all day all day came to service last night I enjoyed that this morning I got up and I was feeling all that over again did I call in sick Jim's been in my house six months he seen good days and he's seen bad days I asked him the other day I said if have you ever heard me whine not one time brother Ron no matter where your journey takes you let it drive you if a man could do it with an amputated leg and that's an a carnal real amen you got time for One More Story a young boy is in an accident in his home it's a it's a stove and he gets his legs so burned so burned until the doctor said I want to amputate your legs and he begs the doctors please don't amputate my legs and they turn black please don't amputate my legs I know something about Burns listen they Hur hurt there's no pain like Burns no pain like Burns I fell off a house and broke my back I live with that pain for a year or so there's no pain like Burns when he took the skin off of my legs ain't no pain like that either took it from my crotch all the way to my knees all the way around this leg ain't no pain like that either they attached it wanted it to live then they took death bad people's skin put it on my body listen I know something about some hurt I know something about some hurt but did we let it stop us let this sermon be an encouragement to anybody when the enemy says why don't you quit remember this sermon I'm sure others has had worse worse lives than I've had that I don't even want to talk about but let me just say regard less of your situation go quit we're too close to the Finish we're too close we're too close let's finish this let's finish it the musicians can come I say we're a spot now darkness is pressing against us in every way every every enemy of depression and oppression and every enemy of from hell is doing his best to discredit the message the messenger and every preacher the Bible I will not let it deter me I want you to say that with us today I refuse to let it deter me Romans 8 verse maybe 31 that young boy walks he's in a wheelchair and they roll him out after he gets home and they roll him out and they roll him to a picked fence and he watches all the other kids playing he could have settled well this is going to be my journey this is going to be but he was determined I'm going to walk again one day he got the courage and he was rolled out there many times but one day he got the courage to pull himself up and stand can you imagine what that felt like he'd never do it they said he'd never do it and he's standing and the next day he determined to take some steps brother Doug and he took some steps and before long as those kids were playing backwards and forwards he was moving from one picket to another one day he decided I'm going to run I'm going to run let me just say this to you when he asent he won the gold medal in the Olympics for running a four-minute mile very few people knew the story they just celebrated the victory but they didn't know the story they didn't know what it took when I watched David iers play through that horn people can't appreciate the story that's right what was for death is breathing forth life when we walk
