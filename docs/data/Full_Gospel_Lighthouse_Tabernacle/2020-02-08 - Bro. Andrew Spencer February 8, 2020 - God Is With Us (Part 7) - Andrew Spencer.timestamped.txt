[8:36] our praise in the midst of the battle in
[8:38] the midst of the season of our pain we

[8:43] because when you're praising God God
[8:46] inhabits the praises of his children if
[8:50] you have your Bibles this evening we'll
[8:51] turn to the book of Ephesians chapter 1
[8:53] and verse 18 so thank you for the
[8:56] atmosphere that has been created here
[8:58] this evening the angel the Lord is
[9:03] pleased well you know where I'm going
[9:15] this evening God is with us and we will
[9:19] see miracles man before we read this
[9:26] evening let's let's speak to the author
[9:28] of the book heavenly father Lord what a
[9:32] privilege it is for us your children
[9:35] Lord to be able to set here Lord as it
[9:40] were to sit down as as you would teach
[9:42] the children on the mountaintop father
[9:45] and they would sit and gather around to
[9:47] hear your teachings father we said here
[9:49] this evening Lord at the foot of the
[9:52] cross father we look upon you Lord Jesus
[9:55] we gaze upon your glory Lord we we know
[10:00] that the the crosses is not a beautiful
[10:03] cross but it's rugged it's a sign of
[10:06] it's a sign of pain and shame and yet it
[10:10] bears our glory it bears who we are it
[10:14] bears what you did for us at Calvary and
[10:18] we so thank you Lord for the innocent
[10:20] blood that you shed on Calvary's cross
[10:22] for our sins
[10:24] Lord where will we be without you father
[10:26] in this moment in this time Lord we just
[10:30] come before you boldly and all we pray
[10:33] that you and move
[10:34] the needs of your situations of your
[10:36] children and we pray that you would
[10:38] touch their lives and I pray God as the
[10:41] ministering of the Lord would go forth
[10:43] we pray that your angel would take the
[10:45] word to the to the address to the spot
[10:50] father in which it is to be placed in
[10:54] and I pray that you would bring it forth
[10:56] lord I pray that you would water that
[10:58] seed Lord I pray that you would come and
[11:01] minister to every single person here
[11:03] under the sound of the voice just now I
[11:05] thank you for what you're doing and what
[11:07] your continuing to do we love and
[11:10] appreciate you tonight in the name of
[11:12] Jesus Christ amen
[11:15] ephesians 1 and verse 18 the eyes of
[11:20] your understanding being enlightened
[11:22] that you may know what is the hope of
[11:25] his calling and what the riches of the
[11:28] glory of his inheritance in the Saints
[11:31] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[11:35] his power to us word who believe
[11:38] according to the working of his mighty
[11:40] power which he wrought in Christ when he
[11:43] raised him from the dead and sat him at
[11:47] his own right hand in the heavenly
[11:49] places far above all principality and
[11:52] power and might and Dominion and every
[11:54] name that is named not only in this
[11:57] world but also that which is to come and
[12:00] hath put all things under his feet and
[12:03] gave him to be the head over all things
[12:07] to the church which is his body the
[12:10] fullness of him that filleth all in all
[12:12] and if you'll flip over about three
[12:14] pages in your Bible to Ephesians 6 and
[12:17] 11 Paul says here put on the whole
[12:26] armour of God that you may be able to
[12:29] stand against the wiles of the devil for
[12:34] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[12:37] before I read this next portion of
[12:40] Scripture if you look back at a
[12:43] Asians if you look back at your Bible
[12:45] there at Ephesians 1 and 21 it tells us
[12:48] that that Christ is far above all
[12:50] principality and power and might and
[12:53] Dominion and every name that is named
[12:55] not only in this world but also in that
[12:57] which is to come and over in Ephesians 6
[13:01] and 12 it tells us Paul says here that
[13:04] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[13:06] but against principalities against
[13:09] powers against the rulers of the
[13:11] darkness of the world against spiritual
[13:13] wickedness in high places
[13:15] notice all of these things in verse 22
[13:18] of Ephesians 1 and 22 and Christ and
[13:22] hath put all things under his feet so
[13:25] all the things that you're wrestling
[13:26] with the things that you're battling
[13:28] with is placed under his feet
[13:31] what a wonderful faultless evening may
[13:34] God bless his word he may be seated in
[13:36] the presence of the Lord these things
[13:39] that you're battling against the
[13:41] principalities the angels of darkness
[13:43] and the powers of darkness and against
[13:46] all the rulers of darkness of this world
[13:48] against spiritual wickedness in high
[13:49] places those are the things that that
[13:52] you are wrestling with in this hour in
[13:54] this day in this moment in time that
[13:56] you're living in those are things that
[13:58] you're wrestling with on a daily basis
[14:00] I'd say that if every person would lift
[14:02] up their hand this even and they would
[14:03] be able to say that they have wrestled
[14:05] they've wrestled a threat they've
[14:07] wrestled with their flesh they've
[14:08] wrestled with theirs wrestled with their
[14:10] own way and in their own spiritual realm
[14:13] is wrestled with those things but I love
[14:15] what Paul said and in before you even
[14:18] get to wrestling this with these things
[14:20] before you ever get it's so so involved
[14:24] in your fight and wrestling with your
[14:26] fight you can know that you're going to
[14:28] come out victorious through the wrestle
[14:30] because he said they put all things
[14:32] under his feet and gave him to be the
[14:35] head that he is the supreme deity over
[14:38] all things to the church and we are his
[14:41] church the whole armour of God is the
[14:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost with the word
[14:46] behind
[14:48] less less service as we left you last
[14:52] weekend on on the thought that that that
[14:55] we were under a Joshua commission and
[14:57] Joshua was standing there in the book of
[14:59] Joshua chapter 1 the Bible said that
[15:02] there shall not any man be able to stand
[15:04] before thee all the days of thy life as
[15:07] I was with Moses said so I will be with
[15:10] thee I will not fail thee nor will I
[15:12] forsake thee and we we begin to speak on
[15:14] these things and say that Satan had
[15:17] tried his very best to keep Joshua and
[15:19] the children of Israel off the promised
[15:22] land because he realized that once they
[15:24] went into the the promised land onto
[15:27] that place that they would dis possess
[15:29] the inhabitants of that land they would
[15:32] go in and overthrow the kingdoms of that
[15:34] world and he knew Satan knew that if
[15:37] Josh would got in there that Satan would
[15:40] not have a chance to get Joshua back out
[15:42] of that land because you see in that
[15:45] kingdom there were worlds that were and
[15:47] there were kingdoms that were not
[15:48] serving the great I am but yet there was
[15:51] coming there was coming up people that
[15:53] were going to serve the I am the God
[15:56] that would not change and the God that
[15:57] always remains the God that is always
[16:00] there and Joshua was standing there in
[16:03] that commission as it was to go in and
[16:06] possess the gate go in and possess that
[16:09] land but he didn't tell him just to go
[16:11] to Jericho and then stop he told him to
[16:13] go all the way in to take ownership of
[16:16] every city to take over and when Joshua
[16:19] or when Abraham was standing there in
[16:21] Genesis 13 and he tells him to look out
[16:24] across all of the land that I've given
[16:26] you all of this work northward southward
[16:28] eastward and westward all of these
[16:30] things are yours they are they're yours
[16:32] and didn't you see Abram never moved
[16:35] into that land but here his seed moved
[16:37] into that land you see and here Joshua
[16:41] was standing under that Commission
[16:43] looking at a promise that was prophesied
[16:45] over four hundred and some years ago
[16:48] maybe five hundred some years but yet
[16:50] the promise to Joshua was just as fresh
[16:53] as it ever was
[16:56] you see because Joshua's he was not
[16:59] looking at the time basis he was not
[17:01] being caught up in the delay he saw that
[17:04] as his job to go in there and if I we as
[17:08] the children of a God can ever get that
[17:10] in the I'm on that this is our hour
[17:13] we're the last runners in this race and
[17:16] God puts his best runners at the best
[17:19] time when it when it is the worst of
[17:21] times in the darkest of times he puts in
[17:24] the runners that are built for that
[17:26] moment built to run that race built to
[17:29] finish that race and Satan is going to
[17:33] battle you every step of the way you may
[17:35] feel like you need to stop and have some
[17:36] oxygen on the way on this last round but
[17:39] I want you to know that Satan didn't
[17:41] make you so Satan came break yeah Satan
[17:44] didn't start so Satan came finish you
[17:48] God started - and what God starts God
[17:51] brings it to his fulfillment you see the
[17:58] god of Moses was with them and leading
[18:00] them all the way and and the Prophet
[18:02] would say that that that we're at
[18:03] another fusions and the scripture of the
[18:06] Bible plainly tells us where we're at in
[18:08] this hour we got a road map that is
[18:11] placed before us it tells us who we are
[18:12] it tells us where we're at it tells us
[18:15] what we're going to face it tells us
[18:17] that two hundred thousand thousand
[18:19] demons were released how the river
[18:21] Euphrates you see when the seals were
[18:24] released those demons were released and
[18:25] we are fighting against air against
[18:29] fallen angels and you thought that you
[18:33] had a rough time but you realize that
[18:36] greater is He that is in you than he
[18:38] that is in the world you see it tells us
[18:44] where we're at so we can be fervent in
[18:46] these matters we can go into the battle
[18:49] realizing that these things are to be
[18:51] that we're going to face these things
[18:53] you see if General Lee and Stonewall
[18:56] Jackson knew how the enemy was going to
[18:58] advance and come at them they could go
[19:00] out and they could win the battle but
[19:03] you see they didn't know they didn't
[19:05] have that long-range vision like God had
[19:07] to go
[19:08] out and to go out and look at how the
[19:10] enemy was going to come in and look at
[19:12] their regiments but yet you're serving a
[19:14] god that's got long-range vision and he
[19:16] knows how the enemy is going to attack
[19:18] you he knows how he's going to fight you
[19:20] so he gave you the very best weapon to
[19:23] fight against the enemy when he gave you
[19:26] his whole word science has done its very
[19:32] best to create weapons of warfare but
[19:35] you today have the the most powerful
[19:38] weapon place in your hands today
[19:40] brother Bantam would say it in three
[19:43] different ways that the greatest weapon
[19:45] that God ever gave to man was a
[19:47] committal to God prayer and the Word of
[19:50] God and if you commit your life to God
[19:53] it is the greatest weapon that has ever
[19:56] been given to you and if you can ever
[19:58] learn how to pray like never before it's
[20:01] the greatest weapon that's been given to
[20:03] you and if you can realize that in your
[20:06] prayer that you can take the Word of God
[20:08] that will whip the devil anytime
[20:10] anyplace under any circumstance that
[20:13] this word will bring you the victory
[20:15] it's the greatest weapon that's been
[20:18] placed in the hand of mankind
[20:23] you can roll your shoulders back when
[20:26] the enemy seems to be breathing down
[20:28] upon you and you can realize that you
[20:31] were built for the fight you are built
[20:33] to stand there that the enemy may be a
[20:35] whole lot taller than you but you don't
[20:38] show no mercy to that enemy Oh
[20:40] hallelujah you see the Bible said that
[20:44] no weapon that is formed against you
[20:46] shall prosper your life could not
[20:48] prosper against David sin cannot prosper
[20:52] against the children of God
[20:56] sickness can prosper you name it out
[21:00] there no weapon that is formed against
[21:03] you shall prosper here we are so we can
[21:05] be fervent in these matters that we are
[21:07] under a Joshua Commission to go in and
[21:10] take over and we're going to possess it
[21:12] by the Word of God for the Bible tells
[21:14] us in Deuteronomy 30 and 14 that the
[21:17] word is very nine to be in my mouth and
[21:20] in the heart that thou may us do it
[21:21] notice what Paul says in in 2nd
[21:25] Corinthians 4 and 13 time for a new
[21:36] microphone cord 2nd Corinthians and 4
[21:40] and 13 Paul says that we having the same
[21:42] spirit of faith according as it is
[21:44] written I believed and therefore have I
[21:46] spoken we also believe we also believe
[21:50] look at the neighbors say we also
[21:52] believe and therefore speak you see he
[21:56] said we have a that same spirit of faith
[21:58] oh come on somebody we have in the same
[22:02] spirit of faith I believe and therefore
[22:05] have I spoken we also believe therefore
[22:07] speak so Paul is is a grabbing this from
[22:11] the Book of Psalms 116 and verse 8 for
[22:14] thou has delivered my soul from death
[22:17] here the psalmist is showing you in a
[22:20] place in which God hath delivered him
[22:23] from that he has delivered it my soul
[22:25] from death my eyes from tears and my
[22:29] feet from falling I'll say what a
[22:30] deliverer that you're facing that you
[22:33] have on your side this
[22:34] evening notice what the psalmist says he
[22:36] says I will walk before the Lord in the
[22:39] land of the living
[22:41] he does not say that he is crawling
[22:43] before the Lord it does not say that
[22:45] he's limping before the Lord but it says
[22:47] that I will walk this is showing a
[22:49] person that has strength to get up this
[22:52] is showing a person that's able to get
[22:54] up out of his chair this is showing
[22:56] somebody that is willing and able to get
[22:58] up they're not willing to stay down and
[23:01] their stupor in their condition they are
[23:03] willing to get up and walk and the
[23:06] psalmist says I will walk before the
[23:08] Lord in the land of the living not in
[23:11] the land of sickness but not in the land
[23:13] of Tomoe not in the land of distress not
[23:16] in the land of diseases but how will
[23:19] walk before the Lord in the land of the
[23:21] living you realize where you're at with
[23:26] this spoken word in this hour you are in
[23:29] the land of the living
[23:31] I believe therefore have I spoken I was
[23:37] greatly afflicted knows that notice the
[23:41] psalmist he's going through the battle
[23:43] he's going through the reproaches he's
[23:45] going through the criticisms he's going
[23:47] through the health problems through all
[23:50] the pain the psalmist says I believe I
[23:53] believe in the promise I believe what
[23:57] God said that for I speak it do you
[24:00] realize that standing in front of you is
[24:02] a perfectly well body and you can walk
[24:05] right into it by the power of faith
[24:08] faith is a revelation faith will not to
[24:11] devil down faith knows where it's at
[24:14] faith is not faith will be but faith is
[24:16] the substance of things hoped for the
[24:18] evidence of things not seen you can't
[24:21] see it but walk into it fellow Huia you
[24:28] see the psalmist was confident in the
[24:31] promise I found this statement a while
[24:34] back an army of sheep led by a line will
[24:37] always defeat an army of lines led by a
[24:41] sheep
[24:43] an army of sheep led by a lion will
[24:48] always defeat an army of Lions led by
[24:51] sheep you realize that the one that is
[24:55] leading you through and taking us to
[24:57] victory is the Lion of the tribe of
[24:59] Judah that he is leading his sheep he's
[25:02] not taking them half way he's taking
[25:05] them all the way he's talking to a
[25:07] people that he's going to bring them to
[25:09] victory the Prophet said you are
[25:12] following your captain hallelujah we've
[25:14] got a five-star general smell j esus
[25:17] notice placing five stars on us fa i th
[25:24] glory hidden leader for himself but he

[26:01] Kingdom around there's a voice a
[26:05] resurrection that is in the people we
[26:07] have that voice and it is the voice of
[26:10] many waters that is speaking out the
[26:12] last runners of this day they are
[26:14] running with everything within them
[26:16] saying don't give up they're screaming
[26:18] out don't back up
[26:20] press the paddle you understand what I'm
[26:23] saying there came a voice from another
[26:25] realm

[26:29] the bottom
[26:31] that's a voice that is crying out to you
[26:33] Church press the battle look at Samson
[26:44] what Samson it was nothing but a little
[26:46] shrimpy what no great big man he was a
[26:49] little bitty shrimp to have seven seven
[26:51] little locks on the back of his head he
[26:54] was going down to a city to see his
[26:55] girlfriend one day and he's walking down
[26:57] there in a line came out and run out
[26:59] here he was in humanistically standing
[27:03] he was helpless and hopeless but when
[27:06] the Spirit of the Lord came on him he
[27:08] just took that line and toward the
[27:10] pieces and throwed it down you see what
[27:13] what made the difference was is that the
[27:16] Spirit of the Lord came upon him he said
[27:19] let me see a little cowardly Church
[27:21] that's afraid to trust God or a family
[27:23] let the Spirit of God strike that family
[27:25] or that individual that church and watch
[27:28] what takes place brother I'm telling you
[27:30] skeptics fly roaches in the summertime
[27:33] when you turn the light on them
[27:35] that's exactly right yes sir everything
[27:37] moves out faith comes in says I'm the
[27:40] boss the rest of it moves out don't make
[27:43] any difference what anybody else says
[27:45] God's Word is eternally right what made
[27:50] the difference was the Spirit of the
[27:52] Lord you may be sitting there carrying a
[27:56] huge load that nobody else knows about
[27:58] you may be carrying a bird and you're
[28:01] thinking ma if I ever need a church I
[28:04] need church today because I have went
[28:07] through all of how it seems like just to
[28:09] get here you think that you're alone
[28:12] here this evening God sees you when you
[28:15] walked in that back door carrying that
[28:17] load but you don't have to carry it out
[28:20] tonight you can leave it at the foot of
[28:23] Jesus you don't have to stay here burden
[28:28] now I understand your burden it's sin or
[28:31] sickness or despair or distress who can
[28:34] take your burdens to the Lord and you
[28:36] can leave them I hear that's more than a
[28:38] song that's a reality tonight I don't
[28:40] care what you came in here packing and
[28:42] I don't care what you have faced in your
[28:44] eyes the circumstances of life may be
[28:46] stacked up against you but abraham
[28:49] believed in God against all odds and if
[28:52] Abraham a man that was a hundred years
[28:54] old
[28:55] could believe God against all the odds
[28:57] what about you as sons and daughters of
[29:00] God to have a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:02] upon your soul that will not leave you
[29:05] will not forsake you but will be with
[29:07] you even in you to the end of the world
[29:09] what do you have to fear tonight
[29:13] [Applause]
[29:16] you remember pilgrims progress in her
[29:19] little and a little Christian he was
[29:21] packing that load everywhere he went but
[29:24] he finally found a place that he could
[29:26] drop it off you may feel like a little
[29:28] Christian and I but I want you to know
[29:30] you can walk up to a big God you can lay
[29:34] your burdens at the feet of Jesus and
[29:38] you ain't gotta pick them up the devil's
[29:39] gonna whisper at you and tell you you
[29:41] got to pick him up but sistercrystal
[29:43] don't pick them up leave them there in
[29:45] the name of Jesus and walk out of these
[29:47] doors completely hope Oh
[29:55] the difference is the Spirit of Christ
[29:57] notice what Jesus said in John chapter
[30:01] 15 and 7 that if ye abide in me
[30:04] notice the bride is connected to the rod
[30:07] groom that if ye abide in me if you look
[30:11] at that word in the Greek it means to
[30:12] remain to endure it means to not perish
[30:16] to last and speaking of person it means
[30:20] to survive to live in reference to the
[30:23] state or condition it means to remain as
[30:25] one not to become another or different
[30:29] but if he abide in me and my words whose
[30:34] words God's words if ye abide in me and
[30:38] my words abide in you ask you shall ask
[30:42] what you will I know it his will is but
[30:46] what's your will is it your will to ask
[30:50] him big things is it your will just to
[30:52] ask in small things it's his will to
[30:55] give you the very desires of your heart
[30:57] if you delight yourself in the Lord it's
[31:00] his will to heal it's his will to save
[31:03] it's his will to deliver but what is
[31:05] your will who ask and it shall be done
[31:12] unto you you see there is a union
[31:15] between the bridegroom and the bride and
[31:18] faith in her make her makes her
[31:21] unmovable she stands there as the Ransom
[31:24] she stands there as the redeemed
[31:28] justified in his sight why are we
[31:30] justified
[31:31] we are his victory the church is his
[31:36] victory we come forth in the last days
[31:38] with the glorious gospel showing his
[31:40] victory that he died for this purpose
[31:42] and we are proof of his victory when we
[31:46] see him coming down and living amongst
[31:48] the church that's his victory now you
[31:56] think you have in yourself a good time
[31:58] you think that you're enjoying your time
[32:00] you think that you are enjoying these
[32:02] heavenly places but do you realize that
[32:04] what you're packing is the very victory
[32:06] of Lord Jesus Christ
[32:08] to see you living out in the darkness to
[32:11] taste to see you living it out that you
[32:14] are packing the very victory of Almighty
[32:17] God were the proof of his victory when
[32:20] we see him coming down and living
[32:23] amongst the church that's his victory it
[32:26] shows that they couldn't keep him in the
[32:28] grave and neither can they keep you an
[32:30] eye on the grief I am going to show no
[32:34] mercy on this demon of hell I was born
[32:39] here to be victorious our identity is
[32:44] tied to him bear with me as I give you
[32:47] these these these these double-barrel
[32:49] shotgun nuggets here that our identity
[32:52] is in him he is our headship that we're
[32:55] the final voice to the final age it's
[32:57] not Christ a player and you down here
[33:00] but it's Christ in you it's Christ in
[33:04] you the hope of glory and it is our
[33:06] victory our victory is to receive the
[33:09] word of this hour he said that he would
[33:12] not leave you but he'd be with you and
[33:14] it shows you tonight how close God is
[33:17] and he's always there and he is not
[33:20] leaving you
[33:20] that the Bible said that the angels of
[33:23] the Lord and care about them and deliver
[33:25] them those angels are staying there day
[33:28] in day out when you go to sleep they're
[33:30] awake they're there to watch you they're
[33:32] there to protect you Alleluia he's there
[33:39] he's with us he's even in us in the in
[33:41] the world and you can see him operating
[33:42] in nature you can see God in the trees
[33:45] you can see God in the flowers you can
[33:48] see God in everything but I wonder if
[33:49] you could see him in you they st. God
[33:54] with your neighbor this is God with you
[33:57] he st. God with your pastor God with the
[34:00] deacon but God in you I was asked one
[34:04] time did you really meet him absolutely
[34:07] I met him do you realize that once you
[34:09] meet him you will never be the same
[34:13] some people say how in the world do you
[34:16] know you met him let me tell you you
[34:19] ever meet him you'll know that you met
[34:22] him are you with me you see you have
[34:25] come in contact with me and you
[34:26] recognize when you speak to me that I've
[34:28] got certain mannerism about myself
[34:30] I got certain characteristics about
[34:32] myself I've got certain intentions or I
[34:35] have when I speak to you I'm a person of
[34:37] positivity I'm going to speak you when a
[34:40] level of faith you realize that when
[34:42] you're speaking to me you've come in
[34:44] contact with me you may walk away from
[34:46] here and you may forget my name and you
[34:48] may forget everything about me but once
[34:50] you meet him I want you to know if you
[34:55] ever meet him I'm not talking about a
[34:57] picture I'm not talking about a book but
[34:59] I'm talking about they offer the book
[35:01] that if you ever meet him you'll know
[35:05] that you met him you all want the same
[35:08] you won't talk the same you won't live
[35:11] the same because you won't be the same
[35:20] don't fear to go anywhere or do anything
[35:23] for the never-failing presence of Jesus
[35:25] Christ is with you wherever you go
[35:28] so Satan can't kill me until God says
[35:32] it's finished he might try but he'll
[35:36] never succeed in doing it you remember
[35:43] you remember when Joshua was standing
[35:46] there he's done across the Jordan he's
[35:49] done he's done he's done got his
[35:50] commission and he's standing there in
[35:52] Joshua chapter 5 and he's standing there
[35:55] and he's looking out across Jericho and
[35:57] he sees he sees a man standing there
[35:59] that's got a sword drawn and he says are
[36:01] you with us or are you against us and
[36:04] notice what his words were it says nay
[36:07] neither of these but you're for me I'm
[36:12] not on your side but you're on my salary
[36:14] with me nay but as the captain of the
[36:17] hosts of the Lord am I now come notice
[36:19] notice what the what the what the angel
[36:22] said
[36:22] him is that I am the God that's fighting
[36:26] your battles I'm the God that's with you
[36:30] hallelujah but I want you to not only
[36:33] want to go in all the details as we know
[36:35] that story quite well but I want you to
[36:37] capture this thought on this think on
[36:40] this scripture here that before Joshua
[36:42] could go him and take Jericho notice how
[36:45] powerful that was how big Jericho was
[36:49] that it was stacked up so high that they
[36:52] could have horse races around the top of
[36:54] it they they were loaded in such a way
[36:57] that unless God showed up there was no
[37:00] way that humanistically standing then
[37:02] Joshua could take it down that's not
[37:05] even the point I want you to catch
[37:06] tonight but before Joshua could ever go
[37:09] in there and take over Jericho he had to
[37:12] have a conference I want you to know
[37:16] that before David could ever take down
[37:18] Goliath he had to have the anointing
[37:20] poured upon him and before Joshua went
[37:23] in there and took over Jericho and tore
[37:26] down the walls he had to meet the great
[37:29] I am and you will never tear down walls
[37:32] in your life until you meet him you will
[37:36] never go in there and take over until
[37:38] you meet him you will never go in there
[37:40] and make your giants fall until you meet
[37:42] him you have given everything else a
[37:45] chance why don't you give God a chance
[37:47] you give trumps a chance why don't you
[37:49] give God a chance you give pornography a
[37:52] chance why don't you give God a chance
[37:54] you gave alcohol chance why don't you
[37:56] give God a chance you gave Hills a
[38:00] chance why don't you give God a chance
[38:02] he gave doctors a chance why don't you
[38:04] give God a chance play with me won't you
[38:11] give God a chance in this battle press
[38:14] the battle give God a chance hello this
[38:23] is the age of life the personal life of
[38:26] Christ were the chemical of his body
[38:29] what was in him this is the age for that
[38:35] if you could ever realize that you are
[38:38] the temple of Almighty God that you're
[38:45] packing on the inside of your soul the
[38:47] great I am one time we were down in
[38:50] Tennessee and we were we were looking we
[38:53] were looking at a studio set and looking
[38:56] at speakers for this church and we were
[38:58] in this we were in this Bose
[39:01] this Bose store and had every imaginable
[39:03] speaker there was and there was this man
[39:05] and we were looking at these certain
[39:06] ones and there was this man that began
[39:09] to tell us he didn't work there but he
[39:10] began to tell us about these certain
[39:12] speakers he said what do you need them
[39:13] for we're so well we were looking for
[39:15] him for our church and he said I he said
[39:17] I'm a pastor of a church and he said I'm
[39:18] gonna tell you something he said these
[39:20] are the best speakers that there is out
[39:22] there he said I got them in my church
[39:24] and he began to talk to me and brother
[39:26] Alden and he began to tell him said you
[39:28] know he said he said you know he said
[39:31] this is preacher had a shirt halfway
[39:34] button down here had a necklace around
[39:38] his neck and look like the biggest he
[39:42] was a long way from Texas let me say
[39:43] that but he began to talk to me and
[39:47] brother album to tell him said you know
[39:48] he said the church is not the building
[39:50] but the church is this tip when he put
[39:54] his hand upon brother Allen's chest and
[39:57] he said that temple that temple is the
[40:00] place where the Holy Ghost dwells and I
[40:02] thought my brother just like Jesus said
[40:05] you are so close to the kingdom right
[40:07] now and you don't even realize it if the
[40:10] man that was talking to us could have
[40:12] had the God that was on the inside of
[40:14] that kingdom he would have walked away
[40:16] with his shirt buttoned and he would
[40:18] have know what side of the kitchen he
[40:20] deserved to be oiled
[40:26] there's a lot of people that claim that
[40:28] God is with them there's a lot of people
[40:31] that claim Wilson look at us look our
[40:33] Turks is growing our church this
[40:34] building we've got more members we got
[40:37] more members than you could ever imagine
[40:38] we've got to be blessed God has got to
[40:40] be with me but do you know that David
[40:43] said that even I've seen the wicked grow
[40:45] in power as a green bay tree but they
[40:48] all perish I look for them I sought for
[40:50] them but they all passed away but he
[40:53] said mark the perfect man mark the
[40:56] perfect man and his end is peace the
[41:00] wicked has an end of destruction but the
[41:03] man of peace come on somebody the man
[41:06] that is the kingdom the man that is
[41:08] blessed his end is peace there's a lot
[41:13] of people say God is with them but I
[41:14] really wonder is God with them many
[41:17] people can talk a good game many people
[41:19] can come to church here night after
[41:20] night day after day but it's really God
[41:23] with them when the rubber meets the road
[41:27] when your burden gets bigger than you
[41:29] can you really say God is with you when
[41:33] it comes down to it when you've got to
[41:35] put your foot on the pedal and push it
[41:38] like never before
[41:38] can you say God is good you got the
[41:42] goods
[41:42] now you're built to stand the test you
[41:46] see because we live in an hour
[41:48] when there's so much science out there

[47:14] others what made the difference but God
[47:19] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[47:24] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[47:26] dead in sins has made us alive together
[47:30] with Christ and by grace ye are saved I
[47:36] thought it was by my works absolutely
[47:38] not by his amazing grace are you saved
[47:45] and hath raised us up together and made
[47:49] us to sit together in heavenly places in
[47:55] Christ Jesus you see the only way that
[47:59] you ever know God personally is to for
[48:01] him to reveal himself to you in the
[48:03] power of the Holy Ghost before you ever
[48:05] know it you see without the baptism of
[48:08] the Holy Ghost you're only guessing at
[48:09] it you're saying what the word says are
[48:11] you saying what the pastor says you're
[48:13] saying what your mother said but when
[48:15] the Holy Spirit comes in and baptizes
[48:18] you into the person of Christ Jesus then
[48:20] you know by a personal experience that
[48:22] Jesus Christ is the
[48:25] son of God rates what a dead living in
[48:27] you the hope of glory
[48:30] now that is when you can say God is with
[48:34] me when that quickening power that makes
[48:37] you alive from the dead nosov trespasses
[48:40] of sin when that quickening power comes
[48:42] in it's not a power of a man but it is
[48:45] the power of Almighty God it is the
[48:47] power of the abstract of Easter the
[48:49] resurrected Jesus that set back the
[48:51] abstract to guarantee us that we are
[48:54] already alive in him he realized that
[48:58] Jesus had confidence in that quickening
[49:00] power he had so much he had so much
[49:03] confidence in the quickening power
[49:05] because he realized what the word said
[49:08] about him over in the Book of Psalms 16
[49:10] and 10 that thou will not leave that
[49:13] would not leave my soul in hail and
[49:16] neither will I suffer thy Holy One to
[49:17] see corruption you see he realized that
[49:21] when he was facing the Giants of that
[49:23] day in the spiritual realm that he
[49:25] realized when he told him you destroy
[49:28] this temple and in three days I'll raise
[49:31] it back up again they thought that he
[49:34] was talking about the Temple in
[49:35] Jerusalem but he was talking about this
[49:37] temple and when the angel came to the
[49:41] ladies that were there down there at the
[49:42] tomb remember what he said to you then
[49:45] I'll raise up this temple in three days
[49:49] [Applause]
[49:51] hello if you could realize that's how
[49:54] the Prophet would even tell us about
[49:56] sickness that once that sickness once
[49:58] that spirit is cursed that it goes
[50:00] through a process of dying and when it
[50:03] goes out it dies or when 72-hours
[50:05] corruption sets in he said we're not 72
[50:08] hours comes in you're going to get sick
[50:11] as all good health and you're going to
[50:12] think that you're not healed but you're
[50:15] already healed you're already delivered
[50:18] but if you can keep your faith through
[50:20] the dying process if you can keep your
[50:25] faith through the dying process you'll
[50:27] come out on the other side alive and
[50:30] well
[50:31] how Satan hates this message because it
[50:34] tells you that you are going to walk
[50:36] before the Lord in the land of the
[50:39] living if Jesus could have that much
[50:46] confidence in the scripture and have
[50:51] that much confidence in the quickening
[50:53] power of Almighty God what about you
[50:57] you're carrying your burden and you
[51:02] think my I'm all by myself you think
[51:05] nobody else knows what I'm going through
[51:07] nobody knows but I've had to put up with
[51:09] this week nobody knows the conversations
[51:11] that I've had this week and you're
[51:13] packing a burden and you're walking
[51:16] around and your shoulders are beginning
[51:19] to hurt because you're carrying this
[51:21] burden all by yourself
[51:23] and you think there's nobody I can give
[51:26] it to if Jesus could have that type of
[51:29] confidence to not only put your burdens
[51:32] on himself but to put your neighbor to
[51:35] put your loved one to put the sins upon
[51:37] him of the whole world and pack that
[51:41] burden and pack that burden on the back
[51:48] of him with an old rugged cross what
[51:53] about you he's not just packing your
[51:57] burden but he's packing the sins of the
[52:00] whole world upon his shoulders and you
[52:05] think you can't make it through if Jesus
[52:08] had confidence in what God said about
[52:10] him what about you tonight what up the
[52:15] confidence to be for us tonight you've
[52:17] heard the greatest message that's ever
[52:19] hit the face of the earth and you still
[52:21] let the devil whip you around show him
[52:24] no mercy tell him I know I came from and
[52:30] no one's going show him no mercy
[52:34] [Applause]
[52:40] stop let that lime that will whip you
[52:44] around
[52:50] God is with me I don't know if you get
[52:59] this tonight if it's processing through
[53:00] your mind but God God is with you sister
[53:07] Connie when you're working on your job
[53:11] and you feel like nobody's around and
[53:13] you feel like I couldn't I'm the only
[53:16] one in my whole entire office do you
[53:20] realize that God is with you how about
[53:23] you brother Evan when you're walking
[53:25] through school and you're you're facing
[53:26] battles it just seems like nobody else
[53:28] knows about but could you realize today
[53:31] that God is with you I love this because
[53:36] it makes it so personal is that he is
[53:38] Emmanuel which being interpreted God God
[53:43] dear to himself come down and dwelt in
[53:46] mortal flesh God with Evan Mays God with
[53:52] Carli God with brother Greg now it's one
[53:59] thing when you walk out and you know
[54:01] that you are going into an absolute
[54:03] battle and it's looking like that the
[54:11] the man that's coming out to battle use
[54:13] a whole lot bigger than you are and he's
[54:16] got a whole bunch of his buddies but if
[54:20] you can look right behind you
[54:23] and somebody whole lot bigger than you
[54:26] but God is with you one time one time in
[54:34] my younger years I won't say exactly win
[54:36] leave out some of the details so mama
[54:39] don't beat me around later tonight but
[54:42] there was one time I was I was be
[54:47] careful here
[54:48] at one time I was I was walking with
[54:51] some friends and and there was a gang of
[54:53] people that started making fun of this
[54:56] girl that was with the crowd and nobody
[54:59] else would stand up I've been taught the
[55:03] whole lot life to stand up to get up I
[55:07] said hold up why don't you talk about
[55:09] somebody else won't you pick on somebody
[55:11] your own size so three guys decided that
[55:15] he's gonna take me on I said I hold on
[55:17] this ain't fair right now
[55:18] they say fairies three gets y'all three
[55:21] all against me I said but let me tell
[55:23] you something if you'll let me have a
[55:25] chance of yet worn out of time I
[55:27] guarantee I'll take you down I said you
[55:30] ain't got a chance you know what I did I
[55:32] said we'll line up right there and I
[55:34] took down all three of them when they
[55:36] gave me the chance because they were
[55:39] picking on a little lady I'm gonna show
[55:44] no mercy on the enemy that is trying to
[55:48] attack God's bride why don't you pick on
[55:52] somebody your own size and Almighty God
[55:55] says I got this I got this
[55:59] this ain't your battle brother Jeff I
[56:01] got this now if I can say that from a
[56:05] humanistically standpoint what about you
[56:08] as a son of God brother Nathaniel when
[56:10] the enemy comes against your family you
[56:13] stand up and say why don't you pick on
[56:15] somebody your own size
[56:17] you ain't picking on me you're picking
[56:20] on God
[56:24] Gloria tells how many God is defending
[56:29] you God is where us
[56:42] Oh
[56:51] God is with us God is with us back when
[57:00] I first met when I first gave my heart
[57:03] to the Lord I was new I was new I was
[57:08] I'd say how they say it sister Connie I
[57:10] was still wet behind here's a little bit
[57:12] and I had had a real conference with God
[57:15] I had met him face to face and I
[57:17] realized that the battle against myself
[57:20] that God had this and I put all my trust
[57:25] in him and God brought me all the way
[57:28] through but I was still green a little
[57:31] bit and didn't have maybe maybe I still
[57:33] ain't got it but I didn't have most
[57:35] senses as some people do I was down here
[57:38] to gas station coming to church I was
[57:40] dressed up kind of like a ham in here
[57:42] tonight I walk in there and this man
[57:44] sitting behind the counter said you hit
[57:45] a church no I'm going to a funeral
[57:47] [Laughter]
[57:49] yeah I'm hit at church and so he's so
[57:53] hot tell you what he said when you go
[57:56] down to a church why don't you light a
[57:57] candle for me I said I tell you what you
[58:01] come up here to church where I'm going
[58:03] here this God that I serve a light your
[58:05] candle he didn't understand you see this
[58:13] is more than lighting a candle but this
[58:15] is about your candle getting live and
[58:18] this is about telling somebody else how
[58:20] your candle got lit and watch the
[58:22] Wildfire begin to spread out
[58:25] oh my you love the Lord
[58:33] the Bible says in Psalms 103 know ye 100
[58:39] and verse 3 know ye that the Lord he is
[58:42] God it is he that has made us and not we
[58:46] ourselves we are his people and the
[58:49] Sheep of his pasture Deuteronomy 4 and
[58:52] 35 under thee it was showed that thou
[58:55] that thou mightest know that the Lord he
[58:58] is God and there is none else beside him
[59:02] hey I ain't no God beside him there's no
[59:05] God like Jehovah he's the God that is
[59:07] with us and we will see his miracles
[59:11] when Nicodemus came to Jesus secretly at
[59:15] night he said we know that thou master
[59:18] that thou cannot do no man can do these
[59:20] things he cannot do these miracles
[59:23] except he be from God Nicodemus
[59:26] recognized where the miracles were
[59:28] coming from
[59:29] you gotta recognize where the miracles
[59:32] are coming from Almighty God and there's
[59:35] none beside him
[59:37] anybody can say God is good when they're
[59:40] up on the mountain anybody can say God
[59:42] is good when everything's peachy but
[59:45] when the doctor walks in and it tells
[59:47] you some really bad news can he still
[59:49] say God is good when the doctor says you
[59:53] ain't gonna make it can he still say God
[59:55] is good
[59:55] anybody can praise him in the good times
[59:58] but can you praise him in the bad times
[59:59] anybody can praise him when the bills
[1:00:01] are paid anybody can praise him when he
[1:00:04] got a new car
[1:00:04] anybody can praise him when he got new
[1:00:06] shoes when he got a new house and he got
[1:00:09] good strength and he got health and he
[1:00:11] got money he got a good wife but what if
[1:00:13] you got a bad wife what if you ain't got
[1:00:15] no money what if he got health can you
[1:00:18] still say God is good when you ain't got
[1:00:21] no strengthening weak as a kid can he
[1:00:23] still say God is good when the shoes you
[1:00:25] got on you've been wearing for 40 years
[1:00:27] not by choice can you still say God is
[1:00:31] good when the car's broke down can you
[1:00:33] say God is good when the bills ain't
[1:00:35] being paid can you say God is good
[1:00:39] can you praise Him in the pally
[1:00:44] anybody can praise him while they had
[1:00:46] church but can you praise him out there
[1:00:48] when you get the enemy toe-to-toe
[1:00:50] face-to-face can you say my God's bigger
[1:00:52] than you you stupid devil we as humans
[1:01:07] we love we love the stories of David we
[1:01:11] look at the highlights of David's
[1:01:12] ministry we look at him as he takes down
[1:01:15] a parent we enjoy those highlights who
[1:01:19] we enjoy when he talks about killing
[1:01:20] online and he's more than able to
[1:01:23] deliver me from the hand of this
[1:01:25] Philistine we enjoy hearing about how
[1:01:28] that how the David came back into the
[1:01:30] city and they began to sing Saul as cute
[1:01:32] as thousands but Davis tens of thousands
[1:01:35] we all enjoy those highlights and
[1:01:37] David's ministry but do you realize that
[1:01:39] David spent most of his life hiding and
[1:01:43] running from cover running from his
[1:01:46] predecessor saw that David spent most of
[1:01:50] his time camping and he didn't spit it
[1:01:52] out on the send it out on the Yogi Bear
[1:01:55] down here and spin it in someplace where
[1:01:57] he'd get on a roller coaster and get on
[1:01:59] some waterslide but David camped out in
[1:02:01] the darkness of a cave in a wet cave
[1:02:04] walked through valleys walked through
[1:02:06] the mud and the anointing oil was poured
[1:02:10] on him everybody looks at the highlights
[1:02:15] but they miss what may David the king
[1:02:19] that he was you see sol was a man when
[1:02:24] he saw somebody rising up in power then
[1:02:27] he threw spears at him
[1:02:30] but David could easily he could have
[1:02:33] easily grabbed those Spears and threw
[1:02:34] him back it's all he could have easily
[1:02:37] done that he was a man of war if he'd
[1:02:42] have done this and got angry got mad he
[1:02:46] would have ended up exactly like so
[1:02:49] everybody enjoys David taking off
[1:02:52] gallant head but can you relate to David
[1:02:56] down in the mud can you relate to David
[1:03:00] when he's goal of his army surrounded
[1:03:03] him and believing in him and he's hiding
[1:03:08] can you relate to it can you relate to
[1:03:13] him when he's going through a time of
[1:03:16] trouble David was not always on the
[1:03:20] mountaintop praising God David knew some
[1:03:24] dark times David knew what it was like
[1:03:29] to feel like nobody was with him David
[1:03:35] knew what it was alike when parents
[1:03:38] would walk past him when he was all
[1:03:40] muddy his clothes ripped apart hidden up
[1:03:43] to a cave to hide out running from King
[1:03:45] Saul he knew what it was like for
[1:03:47] parents to say now if you don't be good
[1:03:49] you're gonna end up like a giant slayer
[1:03:57] David knew what it was like to be
[1:03:59] criticized David knew what it was like
[1:04:01] to be spit on David wasn't always at a
[1:04:06] time where he could point I said look
[1:04:11] look on the end of my spear I got
[1:04:13] Goliath's head look on the end of my
[1:04:15] sword I'm dragging it around the city
[1:04:17] but there was times and David's walk
[1:04:19] that David felt all alone but David no
[1:04:25] matter the state or the condition David
[1:04:27] was in David knew how to praise God
[1:04:31] David could say in Psalms 27 the Lord is
[1:04:35] my light and my salvation whom shall I
[1:04:38] fear
[1:04:40] Lord is the strength of my life of whom
[1:04:41] shall I be afraid with no wicked even my
[1:04:44] enemies and my folks came upon me to eat
[1:04:47] up my flesh and they stumbled and fail
[1:04:48] though in host should encamp against me
[1:04:50] my heart shall not fear the war should
[1:04:53] rise against me in this will I be
[1:04:56] confident one thing if I desired of the
[1:05:00] Lord that I that will I seek after that
[1:05:03] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:05:05] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:05:07] of the Lord to enquire in his temple
[1:05:14] David could say for in the time of
[1:05:18] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:05:23] in the secret of his Tabernacle Djali
[1:05:25] hide me he shall set me upon a rock
[1:05:32] David never lost his priests come on
[1:05:37] somebody if anybody's gonna look at
[1:05:40] symptoms
[1:05:41] David was looking at symptoms look back
[1:05:44] at what Samuel did he poured the
[1:05:46] anointing on top of me I didn't
[1:05:48] immediately take kingship but I went
[1:05:50] back to hurt and sheep I went back I
[1:05:53] wish to run around but David no matter
[1:05:56] him no matter what he was he believed
[1:05:59] what the prophet Samuel had said about
[1:06:00] him that he was the oncoming king and
[1:06:04] David said in Psalm 34 that I will bless
[1:06:07] the Lord at all times his praise shall
[1:06:13] continually be in my mouth
[1:06:17] Psalm 71 and 8 let my mouth be filled
[1:06:20] with thy praise and with thy honor all
[1:06:22] the day sums 145 I will extol thee my
[1:06:27] god o King and I will bless thy name
[1:06:30] forever and ever every day will I bless
[1:06:32] thee I will praise thy name forever and
[1:06:36] ever
[1:06:39] can you praise him when you don't
[1:06:41] feeling can you praise him when you
[1:06:43] don't sin can you praise him when you're
[1:06:45] all alone
[1:06:47] come on somebody can you praise him when
[1:06:50] he just got done putting a roof on your
[1:06:52] house anything leaks can you still lift
[1:06:56] up your hands and say thank you Lord now
[1:07:06] I know I ain't got you on your feet but
[1:07:09] if you can realize that you can get
[1:07:11] through these moments if you can get
[1:07:15] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:07:17] death and realize that the enemy can
[1:07:20] touch one hair of your head and you can
[1:07:23] still say God who is with me do you
[1:07:32] realize that you're not only motions
[1:07:34] like that you're not going on site right
[1:07:38] there you're not going on feeling right
[1:07:40] there you're speaking from a realm of
[1:07:43] faith that God is with me through the
[1:07:45] fire I say at 24 and 14 they shall lift
[1:07:50] up their voice they shall sing for the
[1:07:54] majesty of the Lord they shall cry aloud
[1:07:56] from the sea write this one down verse
[1:08:01] 15 where I glorify you the Lord in the
[1:08:05] fires glorify even the name of the Lord
[1:08:10] of the God of Israel in the aisles of a
[1:08:13] sea glorify the god in your afflictions
[1:08:16] glorify the Almighty God in tribulation
[1:08:19] in valleys in Louis States in conditions
[1:08:22] in holes in dens in cliffs in rocks when
[1:08:27] the persecuting enemy is chasing you
[1:08:28] down glorify the Lord he's called in the
[1:08:35] Bible Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Jireh means
[1:08:37] the Lord will provide
[1:08:39] I'm so glad tonight to know that he's
[1:08:42] still Jehovah Jireh no matter what the
[1:08:44] circumstance he is God will make a way a
[1:08:47] way of escape Satan may pin you in a
[1:08:51] corner with a cancer God will make a way
[1:08:53] of escape Satan may pin you down under a
[1:08:56] car God will make a way of escape
[1:08:58] Satan may take your family away from you
[1:09:01] but God will make a way of escape
[1:09:03] God has away for gospel right house do
[1:09:08] you trust away he's not part of the way
[1:09:10] he is the way the truth the life my
[1:09:24] closing statements I want to give you a
[1:09:28] song of deliverance God is with me
[1:09:39] second Sandino 22 in warning I want you
[1:09:44] to look at your neighbor say God is with
[1:09:46] me we will see miracles
[1:09:58] America is something that you can't
[1:10:00] explain it's a miracle that America is
[1:10:03] something that you can't figure out
[1:10:06] America is a paradox unbelievable but
[1:10:12] true and if you're born again every
[1:10:17] believer is a paradox and unless you
[1:10:25] have that born-again experience you
[1:10:27] cannot be a Christian you're not called
[1:10:30] a paradox unless you've had those
[1:10:32] moments but he's not offered us a floury
[1:10:39] bit of ease God don't promise easy
[1:10:43] things God promises impossible things
[1:10:49] impossible for you but possible for him
[1:10:56] you can't have a miracle unless you have
[1:10:59] an extremely hard circumstance you see
[1:11:06] when you're asking for a miracle you're
[1:11:08] realizing that you're between a rock and
[1:11:09] a hard place and you need to sing this
[1:11:14] song and David spake unto the Lord the
[1:11:21] words of this song in the day that the
[1:11:25] Lord had delivered him out of the hand
[1:11:28] of all of his enemies and out of the
[1:11:30] hand of Saul he didn't wait to sing it
[1:11:34] he didn't wait till he felt like singing
[1:11:36] it he sang it the day I want you to sing
[1:11:41] this song today let this be your song of
[1:11:47] deliverance this day may you say it like
[1:11:51] this this day this scripture is
[1:11:54] fulfilled this day this song will be
[1:11:58] sung out of my soul this day
[1:12:03] this is my song of deliverance are you
[1:12:09] ready to sing and he said the Lord is my
[1:12:14] rock and my fortress and my deliverer
[1:12:17] the God of my rock in him when I trust
[1:12:20] he is my shield in the horn of my
[1:12:22] salvation my high tower my refuge my
[1:12:26] Saviour they'll save us me from violence
[1:12:29] I will call on the Lord who is worthy to
[1:12:31] be praised so shall I be saved from our
[1:12:34] enemies when the waves of death
[1:12:37] compassed me the floods of ungodly men
[1:12:39] made me afraid The Sorrows of Hell
[1:12:42] compassed me about the snares of death
[1:12:44] prevented me in my distress what a song
[1:12:50] I called upon the Lord and cried to my
[1:12:53] god and he did hear my voice out of his
[1:12:57] temple and my cry did enter into his
[1:13:00] ears verse 28 and the afflicted people
[1:13:04] thou will save and the afflicted people
[1:13:20] the afflicted people not the whole
[1:13:26] people but the people that are in health
[1:13:29] but the people that are afflicted
[1:13:36] this sounds like a people that needed a
[1:13:39] miracle this sounded like a people that
[1:13:42] were up against the wall and the
[1:13:49] afflicted people now we're safe but
[1:13:51] thine eyes upon the Holte that thou may
[1:13:54] us bring them down for thou art my
[1:13:57] landlord and the Lord will lighten my
[1:14:00] darkness for Bobby have I run through a
[1:14:03] troop by my god have I leaped over a
[1:14:06] wall that's for God his way is perfect
[1:14:13] the way of the Lord is tried he is a
[1:14:15] buckler to all them that trust in him
[1:14:17] for who is God said the Lord and who is
[1:14:20] a rock save our God God is my strength
[1:14:23] and power he maketh my way Perkin
[1:14:26] perfect he maketh my feet like Hinds
[1:14:28] feet and setteth me upon the high places
[1:14:30] he teaches my hands the war so that a
[1:14:33] bowl of steel is broken by mine arms
[1:14:35] thou has also given me the shield of our
[1:14:38] salvation and not gentleness has made me
[1:14:41] great thou hast enlarged my steps under
[1:14:43] me so that my feet did not slip I have
[1:14:47] pursued my enemies and destroyed them
[1:14:51] and turned not again until I had
[1:14:53] consumed them if you could ever get in
[1:14:56] your mind that your enemies are God's
[1:14:58] enemies you can sing a song from a
[1:15:03] totally different standpoint if you
[1:15:05] realize that the battle that you're
[1:15:07] facing is God's battle that your enemy
[1:15:10] is God's enemy you can chase them down
[1:15:14] you're not standing alone one who put a
[1:15:21] flight a thousand to ten thousand I have
[1:15:25] pursued my enemies and destroyed them
[1:15:28] and turn not again until I had consumed
[1:15:31] them right now you got your enemy on the
[1:15:37] run
[1:15:38] it's your choice whether you want to
[1:15:40] give up halfway through your miracle
[1:15:43] it's your choice whether you want to
[1:15:46] give in and throw in the towel it's your
[1:15:48] choice whether you go after them they're
[1:15:50] running from you but will you pursue
[1:15:52] them will the people of the miracle go
[1:15:57] after them run after them pursue them
[1:16:02] and consume them Bible said that Jesus
[1:16:06] came and it was manifested to destroy
[1:16:09] the works of the devil but the Prophet
[1:16:13] said that you are here you were born to
[1:16:17] destroy the works of the devil and his
[1:16:19] bodies to do the same you're to do the
[1:16:24] same thing that he did you're here to
[1:16:28] carry out the threats you're here to
[1:16:33] carry out the victory you're a Church of
[1:16:37] the word born of the word a virgin born
[1:16:41] from the word you're a body that
[1:16:44] operates by headship a headship that's
[1:16:48] over top of all of your enemies but will
[1:16:55] you back up you've got a choice to
[1:16:59] whether continue to seek keep singing or
[1:17:02] go sit down in your pew but if you felt
[1:17:05] like I felt you'd be shouting to
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:23] verse 39 he'll hate and I have consumed
[1:17:32] them and wounded them that they could
[1:17:36] not arise yet yay they are falling under
[1:17:43] this is not a song of deliverance for
[1:17:45] your brother for your sister but it's
[1:17:47] for you
[1:17:48] the enemy is falling under my feet for
[1:17:52] thou hast girded me with strength to the
[1:17:55] battle then that rose up against me has
[1:17:58] thou subdued under me in your hour of
[1:18:03] trouble he hath girded you with strength
[1:18:07] to win the battle the battle is not mine
[1:18:12] the battle is the Lord's he's going to
[1:18:16] give you strength to sing this song he's
[1:18:19] not willing that any should perish he's
[1:18:21] not willing that anybody would go
[1:18:23] halfway but you'd go all the way you
[1:18:26] were put here to finish this race sister
[1:18:40] Amazon track that she's running and her
[1:18:44] coach told her her coach told her when
[1:18:48] he don't feel like running run for those
[1:18:51] that can't run because there's a lot of
[1:18:56] people that love to make these two legs
[1:18:58] walk they'd love to make them run honey
[1:19:00] so when you don't feel like running run
[1:19:03] for them that can't run there's some
[1:19:08] people in your walk right now that can't
[1:19:10] do it but why don't you run for them you
[1:19:14] got a coach on your side that is telling
[1:19:17] you that Satan didn't make you so Satan
[1:19:19] can't break you there's a copse on the
[1:19:22] inside of you that's telling you that
[1:19:24] Satan didn't start you so Satan can't
[1:19:27] finish you I want you to run for every
[1:19:30] believer
[1:19:31] that's here on this earth I want you to
[1:19:33] rise up and I want you to walk in the
[1:19:35] land of the lift there might be a
[1:19:38] brother that's fallen there might be a
[1:19:39] sister that's fallen but let's run this
[1:19:42] race
[1:19:43] let us run for those that can't run let
[1:19:48] us carry will you choose well you choose
[1:20:08] to sing will you choose to sing a song
[1:20:13] and delivers when it looks like you're
[1:20:17] still bound will you choose to sing and
[1:20:24] praise him when it seems like oh hope is
[1:20:32] gone
[1:20:34] will you still choose to sing a song
[1:20:37] with deliverance that God is bringing me
[1:20:40] out he made away from me Satan's tried
[1:20:45] to put me in a corner and I'm gonna sing
[1:20:54] it has been a vision that said that it's
[1:20:57] coming as been a vision said that it's
[1:21:05] coming but I'd say that if you talk to
[1:21:09] brother Jeffery and sister Ana there's
[1:21:11] been times when they crocked I'd say
[1:21:15] there's times when they didn't
[1:21:17] understand there's been times when
[1:21:23] neighborhood maybe it's not for us but
[1:21:27] when God says but when God says I'm
[1:21:32] gonna give you a baby
[1:21:37] you see because the vision has got to
[1:21:40] come to pass the vision has been made
[1:21:43] plain and Road out you can run
[1:21:48] hallelujah
[1:21:49] the visions been made plain you can run
[1:21:53] with it
[1:21:54] Church I want you to know that you were
[1:21:57] seen in the rapture you can run you can
[1:22:01] face the battle with everything that's
[1:22:04] within you because you are seen they are
[1:22:06] shouting and your offspring with you
[1:22:13] give God praise in a house of God I can
[1:22:19] stand this test because God is with me I
[1:22:23] can pace the tears because God is with
[1:22:29] me let the musicians come but do you
[1:22:41] choose do you choose the worship to the
[1:22:44] pain do you choose the worship do you
[1:22:48] choose the worship when all hope is gone
[1:22:56] it's easy to believe right now it's easy
[1:23:00] for you to say I'm going to praise it
[1:23:03] but when every devil in him is running
[1:23:06] at you with everything that's within
[1:23:08] them because they know that you are
[1:23:12] going to win they know that and Satan is
[1:23:17] afraid because he knows that you are
[1:23:20] getting ready to slip out of his grips
[1:23:22] and he can hold you no longer
[1:23:30] can you still praise him through that
[1:23:33] pain I'm talking about now anybody can
[1:23:38] praise him
[1:23:40] anybody can praise him when they got
[1:23:44] food on the table
[1:23:46] anybody can praise them when
[1:23:48] everything's just going just right here
[1:23:51] I'd say ho praise God
[1:23:53] that's good today cuz everything's just
[1:23:56] right but worship is or the totally
[1:24:02] different level anybody can say god is
[1:24:05] good when they don't look like God is
[1:24:09] good but worship comes from the heart
[1:24:14] worship is when you ain't got shoes on
[1:24:16] your feet and you still say God is good
[1:24:18] worship is showing you have got cancer
[1:24:22] staring you down and it still comes out
[1:24:24] of you that my god he's a known time God
[1:24:27] he's a healer he's a wave maker pants
[1:24:30] are standing down but worship comes out
[1:24:33] of you worship comes out of you
[1:24:36] he's the Lord that God that heals all
[1:24:38] about a ceaseless forget not as benefits
[1:24:41] that's worth so that's real true worship
[1:24:46] I will praise you in this storm and I
[1:24:52] will lift my hand no matter where you
[1:24:56] are no matter where I am I will praise
[1:24:59] you I will praise you in this storm I
[1:25:09] remind you surrender no
[1:25:16] no our king is with us start singing
[1:25:26] brother Matthew right now right now I
[1:25:33] want you to determine that you're going
[1:25:36] to show no mercy
[1:25:37] yeah want you to pray I don't want you
[1:25:41] to pray from a spot of defeat I want you
[1:25:45] to pray from a spot of victory I want
[1:25:50] you to pray like war is open on hell
[1:25:53] because it is you see a lot of people
[1:25:56] can pray and they could talk words into
[1:25:59] the atmosphere
[1:26:01] but when you pray do you know who you're
[1:26:03] praying to you're talking to the creator
[1:26:09] of the universe I want you to show no
[1:26:13] mercy on him and I want you to pray
[1:26:16] things out of your lips I want you to
[1:26:18] prophesize things out of your lips
[1:26:22] because you're the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:24] and you have thus saith the Lord go take
[1:26:31] this book heat this book and prophesy
[1:26:34] again son of man I want you to let loose

[1:26:45] to worship

[1:26:52] standing here you're not going to pray
[1:26:53] the same way that you pray when you're
[1:26:55] in your closet but if you can ever learn
[1:27:00] to pray no matter who's around you I'm
[1:27:05] not talking about just saying some words
[1:27:07] but I'm talking about prayer when you
[1:27:12] say God that seems there is no way I
[1:27:14] know God I know God that you're going to
[1:27:19] make away you promised me that you are
[1:27:24] with me you see it's not about you just
