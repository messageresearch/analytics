[Music] [Applause] [Music] he's the name of the Lord how many say men to that man that's all our desire is to let the Lord use us amen amen and that's his desire more than you even want it hey man I'm so glad to know he's not holding off somewhere saying I'm gonna hold it back from you no it's more of a force on your life amen then you can even ask for a man well we want to say what a wonderful privilege it is to be here with brother Ron I hope I don't disappoint you I'm not gonna do any some results tonight hey what Ron didn't tell you about that was he danced while he's doing that so yeah so I saw how you held off on that there huh we are getting close to Washington DC and there's always a lot more to the story than what you hear from uh parish so a man but a man brother Ron and his family you just have been wonderful friends amen even more than that too family to us just through the years and and if I could say it like this God God calls men to help you in certain times of your life things that you go through and and brother Ron you've been there for some of the most important parts of our life and that's God that did it for us and helped us and I appreciate that and I appreciate your pastor appreciate his family the ministry that's come from his family brother Andrew preached for us this year and what a wonderful blessing he is and was to us there and I just know you're blessed people and we could just talk about this all night long if we wanted to but I know we don't have the time for that but so it's just a wonderful privilege to be here and we also wanted to be sure and bring you the greetings from the warm Church in Sarasota Florida Amen it was like 75 degrees when we left it's gonna be 80 when I get home and I'm really looking forward to that amen but while we're here it's just a wonderful they've been been a wonderful time so we love you with the love of the Lord and Amen why don't we just bow our heads for word prayer and amen ask the Lord to have his way our Heavenly Father it is such a privilege to be able to be in the house of God the place that you have provided Lord even as the name of the church this lighthouse this gospel lighthouse that you've given this area and the people that come to it the men of God that you have placed here to minister to this area father may you come tonight Lord and have your way in the service Lord anointing my lips moving me to the side Lord and 19 to ears of the hear Lord it takes you to make the service successful we've had the singing Lord as we've prepared ourselves for the battle now Lord may you come in a special way deal with the needs of the people father we'll give ourselves to you and ask you to do these things in the name of Jesus Christ we ask amen amen god bless you if you turn in your Bibles to the book of Nehemiah 2nd chapter and I would read it verse nine Nehemiah is speaking about his journey to Jerusalem from the palace in Shushan there in Persia and the first chapter of Nehemiah deals with him hearing that the walls and much of Jerusalem lay in ruins and you know when any child of God hears that something is out of orders what God has placed he cannot be complacent because I believe this said that God uses the agency of men and he does it by placing burdens upon them and and many times we said here we wonder well what can I do well you just let the Lord amen have his way by getting yourself out of the way God is able to accomplish much more than you can do with all your learning your education amen but let God just get in the middle of it it'll change everything and he'd heard that it was it was burnt down then the walls were in rubble and in it and it became a prayer a burden in his life that he couldn't get away from until it even affected him in his work in the palace and when the King saw it and asked him why was his countenance fallen and so forth why was he sad he said he was fearful because in the Persian courts they had to be upbeat they had to be happy the King didn't want to see anything around him that that would be downcast and so he said I was a very afraid but you know if God is working on one end he's also going to be working on the other end rather and sister I want to before I even start these meetings I want you to know we're living in the hour of restoration amen and God did not just put a desire in your heart for restoration if he's not already working on the other end can you say Amen amen and so then God was already marrying away and now the story of Nehemiah is that he's given permission he's given Kings letters and he's given time to go back and to restore the walls of Jerusalem so verse 9 of chapter 2 says I came to the governor's beyond the river and I gave them the Kings letters now the King had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me when sanballat the annoyed and Tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel so I came to Jerusalem and I was there three days and I arose in the night I and some few men with me neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do it Jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the beast that I wrote upon and I went out by night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well into the dung port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire I went to the gate of the fountain into the Kings pool but there was no place for the Beast that was under me to pass I went up by night by the brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned and the rulers knew not whither I went or what I did neither had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work then I said unto them you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we'd be no more reproach and then I told them of the hand of my god which was a part which was good upon me as also the King's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work but when some ballot the horror night and Tobiah the servant the ammonite and Giessen the arabian heard it they laughed at the scorn and despised us and said what is this that you do will you rebel against the king then answer tie them and said unto them the God of heaven he'll prosperous therefore we his servants will arise and build but you have no portion nor right Norma Morial in Jerusalem the Lord bless Serena of his word you can be seated amen as I was thinking about this scripture and the Lord had milena saw my heart and I had being gone through some of these things with the church at home and he directed me to something here and and and before I give you the title of it I just give you a little bit of the background of the time that Israel is in at this moment you see Nehemiah was coming to a city that had no walls it was rubble it was desolation and had been that way for many years and it's something that people can live in that condition live in a place that God has given them and yet not do anything about the the destruction that they become used to and the reason a person can't do anything is because number one destruction can be so bad you don't know where to start and you don't know how to get back how many times have have we heard the prophets say at least two I say many times but at least two amen I've heard the prophets say you've been looking for a place to start and then he would tell them and now tonight this is your place you know if they were looking for a place that meant they didn't know how to start and they didn't know how to be free of something that they were in you know somebody can live in a condition so long that the condition becomes actually part of the structure and you don't know how to get out of it and actually you even in your body your body can have something wrong and it and become used to the condition in the body and and actually work away around it and that you live in that condition but your body was not built to live that way is that right so then something else has to compensate you know they lived in all this rubble and they've been there and maybe they were just satisfied okay I've come back and I'm part of the group that you know we're surviving let me just tell you something God never called his people just to be survivors we're not here to survive we're here to fulfill and then and we can only fulfill by getting in that stream of inspiration when God gives it now amen for a long time they lived in a place of blessing but they weren't blessed they lived in a place of song but they were singing come on they lived in a place of victory amen but they had no victory hey men but God said now is the hour of restoration and when the spirit wants to give a revelation Satan cannot hold it down from his people oh I'm glad tonight to be identified with that group amen amen huh I'll try to slow down and be scholarly here hey man why don't you turn with me to the book of Deuteronomy 23 hey man I hey you know I might have to eat my words I'd do a somersault hey man but you'll be dancing if I do so that's all right let's turn to Deuteronomy 23 now I want to take a title and I'll give you my title after I read this if you dare say man verse 3 and nanomite and Haman I tore a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to their 10th generation so they not enter into the congregation of the Lord for ever because they met you not with bread and with water in the way when you came forth out of Egypt and because they hired against the Balaam the son of Beor of plethora missa potamia to curse thee nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto balaam but the Lord turned the curse into a blessing unto thee because the LORD thy God loved thee and thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all my days were ever I was reading in 1951 brother Branham was speaking to the congregation and he and the the discernment of the Lord was there and he began to speak to him and he says you've been praying haven't you sir I see you kneel in a room and you prayed if you could ever get near me you'd be healed is that right you suffer with the kidney trouble isn't that true Jesus Christ makes you whole my brother you stand to your feet now let me just say something when God is moving the discernment was not healing them mom it was not healing them but it was telling them get into the healing the angel of the Lord is here he has given you your healing but your faith has got to take it so he tells him stand to your feet now he goes there goes that spirit it's a blackness a darkness leaving that man seemingly you could see it and watch it and then he goes it's got a sympathizing partner so now watch this in in the other realm of the Otherworld the Prophet is watching disappeared he goes it's got a sympathizing partner now what does a sympathizing partner do it they strengthen one another and and by strengthening one another it actually causes unbelief to rise and he says now just a moment there it falls it falls over a man sitting there with a t-shirt on a black headed man his hands in his face stand up young men oh aren't you glad Amen that the devil can hide from everybody else but he cannot hide from God and he tells him he said stand up young man so it goes from one man and it comes to another looking for help but God discerns that over that man and he said you stand up you suffer with kidney stones isn't that right accept Jesus now as your healer so as eyes looking at this and as reading this scripture on Nehemiah this salt come to me and I'm on a minute I'm gonna title this this evening to brothers you don't want in your church to brothers you don't want in your church and we read it to you in Deuteronomy 23 they shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord the era of time that we was reading in in the book of Nehemiah is the last restoration of the Old Testament and the books of Ezra Nehemiah and Esther are all describing the same era in history and the prophetic Oh books of that time are Haggai and Zechariah Haggai Zechariah were two prophets that worked together in the time of Ezra encouraging exhorting prophesying to the people and then you have Malachi and Malik Malik I came later he came in the time of nehemiah and he was he was the prophet and with Malachi being the last book of prophecy and who was in that that time of Nehemiah to to help the people and we see in the book of Malachi he was talking to a corrupt priesthood he was talking amen to an Israel that weren't recognizing their time and and God was rebuking them but not only was he dealing with the current situation he was also looking to the coming of the Lord and not only was he looking to the coming of the Lord in his first coming he was looking to the coming of the Lord in his second coming you see but this is this is speaking about restoration now even if God is doing something a man he's not just speaking about history he's speaking about prophecy amen and listen amen when when God gives prophecy I mean not only with the prophecies he telling you amen this is who I am and this is what I'm done and this is what I'm doing but also it's a restoration of the power of God and now the previous prophets of the Babylonian captivity were Jeremiah who eventually was with the remnant in Egypt then you had Ezekiel who was with the remnant in one part of Babylon and also Daniel who was in the courts of Babylon aren't you glad that no matter where Amen there there's somebody where God has his people there's going to be somebody there to encourage him and you're here tonight amen and God knows your needs amen and he's got a word that'll encourage you amen now you just bear with me as I just kind of give you some background on this the book of Nehemiah he's describing the hour of Revelation and restoration that was given to God's people after years of Babylonian captivity and captivity had been so dark that they said how can we sing the songs they hung their hearts and lower their harps and the Willows by the rivers of Babylon it said we're not in the Lord's place we're not in the lake how can we sing a song amen and so they'd coming out of the darkness of a political and spiritual oppression and God was opening up to them as promised word and shining his light on the prophets words and they're coming to pass amen and it's also interesting to see if if God would do it that way that time he also did it that way this time amen because this is the hour of the restoration of all things amen and that's not just a scripture that's reality and then he did not only Amen restore the word he's restored the people he's restored their position I mean he's restored their position in heavenly places there's no more chasm between God and His people but now we're in fellowship once again and then we're outside the denomination aiming and we're walking in step with the word this is restoration but the restoration is not just you realizing something scripturally but the restoration comes into your life comes into your family comes into your health praise the name of the Lord once again a prophet of God has been used to gather the people unto himself now I found this interesting as I was reading these things that in these books you know God when he writes history he's writing the history of his people when we write history we try to write all the good things but but God when he's writing history he doesn't cover anything he doesn't cover it up he shows the darkest parts of their life a man when he's talking about his election he talked about Abraham who was who lied and he talked about Isaac who also lied he talked about David in his adultery and in his murder and all he never tried to cover that thing up but he showed us how the word would restore this is how God writes a history because he wants you to know how it is you know I've been in other countries where World War two has been falling everything and their history of World War two is different than our history of World War two because they all want to look at it on the on making himself the heroes and make themselves but that's not the way God does and then God takes the ignorant he takes the weak he takes those a man who can't lift himself up and he comes into that and he shows that God is still God but I want to tell you tonight that God of history a man is still here and if he could go into that darkest area of David's life of Abraham's life of Isaac's life he can go into the dark areas of your life as well and amen is a prophecy it's God that gets the last word this should be the name of the Lord all over you this time is that God is interested in his election it keep this in mind in this era of of Ezra Nehemiah when the restoration of the temple and the restoration of the walls there is great men in history at that time God never wrote their name in the Bible hey man how many has ever heard of Socrates Plato who is a disciple of Socrates and Xenophon and and and and that's a guy had to look up and then after them as Aristotle and these are the Greeks these are the guys that are shaping Western civilization with human philosophy they're still using it today you know you know get your Bible and find their name in there their name's not there because they weren't the election God is with his election he was with the captives he was with those who can't recite their name so you can remember Plato but you can't recite the names of the captives that came back out of Babylon but God could God could number them and say exactly who is coming out of those tribes why because they were his election oh brother and sister you are God's election your name may not be in the papers but your names are in the Word of God and that's who God is dealing with tonight blessed be the name of the Lord that's who God is interested in the men were part of amen God can use Plato to be part of the restoration he couldn't use Socrates to be part of the restoration man because they were called for it you're called for it there are some great men in that time it a man from whom come battle tactics used today amen and if I tell you their name you probably wouldn't know them unless you're just a historical freak or something man but you don't see their name in the Bible God God didn't render and important why why is God like that the scripture says it all David wrote down in Psalms 87 he says his foundation is in the holy mountains the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob glorious things are spoken of the Old City of God why because I express and we first get a glimpse of the opposition when Nehemiah comes from the palace they're in Shushan with the burden and the burden he had on his heart was for restoration for Jerusalem he wasn't coming and excuse me if I offend you he went coming with Babylonian flags and politics and he was coming with a purpose he wasn't wrapped up in all the news and he was coming with a purpose and that purpose was restoration it was targeted God said I'm going to restore and I'm gonna use man amen to help it amen and now he's already been given the message of restoration because the King has been stirred by God and the King entered into that inspiration and and when when nehemiah said give me letters that I can give to the governors and I can give to the would the the owners of the of the forest and everything and let them know this is God this is the king it's not me these letters that I'm bringing this is not something I devised amen but the seal itself is not a seal I could put on it it's the Kings seal let it be Kings letters that I'm carrying with me and and that then no this is a nehemiah's project this is God's project and so amen this is what happened is so in the work of God a man is coming the natural king is stirred up in his spirit by God to do the work of this restoration which will be revealed by letter sent by his messenger Nehemiah now these are not just any letters these are the king's letters and one of the most important uses of sealing and antiquity was to give a proof of authenticity and authority to letters and royal commands would be the king seal the seal would have to be broken by an authorized person before the book could be read Amen sealing was a badge of authority and power as when a king would hand over his signet ring to one of his officers amen so closed doors were often sealed to prevent the entrance of any authorized person let me just say this because in honor the ceiling was broken as well but the sealing is to keep the authorized person out I'm scuse me the unauthorized person out and could only be given to the authorized people so just just understand Nehemiah came carrying letters he knew I was in the letters because what was in the letters was also in his heart he what was there but the enemy didn't know what was there so so the king's letters or words would have had the Kings seal to give proof of authority and authenticity and these men that oppose Nehemiah's work do not know about the sealed letters and neither does the enemy today have the revelation that came with the opening of the sealed letters he only tries to block the outpouring of revelation by saying it's not time for this work of restoration now well--we're watch is how this spirit tries to overthrow the work in Jerusalem by disputing that this work is not authorized by the king now these men and we read about them sim ballot from Tobiah and they had another sympathizing partner by the name Magee some the arabian and they had allied together against the work of restoration and they didn't have any knowledge of the king's letters all they knew was this man's coming from a far country and he's stirring up the people they're actually having a revival in jerusalem and actually things were starting to be done and so they have knowledge of the Kings laws but they don't have knowledge of the Kings secrets because that's in the heart of his messenger and it's in his letters that's been sent brother Branham said in the anointed ones at the end time he spoke about revelation 16 he said between the 6 and the seventh vial he said there were three unclean spirits like frogs and he said did you notice that he said they went out of the mouths of someone he said it was a trinity of spirits and and then the Trinity of frogs and a frog is an animal that always looked back word he never looks where he's going he looks where he came from amen now that's and he spoke about Trinitarian and said where was Trinitarian born at he said remember three unclean spirit three individual spirits he said they looked back to the nyah seeing Council where the doctrine was born but not to the Bible right so their inspiration was not coming from the word not coming from what God was revealing but it was coming from their knowledge of what the King was not allowing the people of Jerusalem to enjoy how he said whether they come from a Trinity of frogs came out of an old Trinity see it just keeps him in these old things just keep re coming again coming again an old Trinity of frogs and a new Trinity of frogs and then you see you have the dragon the Beast the false prophet and where do these frogs come out when did they come out he said they weren't manifested until between the six and seven seals just before the seal our seventh vial just before the seals open to reveal it he said for in the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of God would be known all these Trinitarian things and false baptisms listen brother and sister we get we got to get our minds off dogma and just the intellectual side of the message amen to say okay now I understand the Godhead or I understand about water baptism no there's a spiritual power behind it Amen listen we all set in darkness we all were oppressed these Trinitarian things they come from a spirit of oppression that would hold the people down so they couldn't rise up with revelation and begin to get strength again there was a reason they weren't building in Jerusalem they had no strength for revival Amen but God was sending them a revival by the message I was coming by his messenger and when that message began to sound in every person in Jerusalem had a right to that revival man you say well I don't feel worthy I don't feel like I can stand up and accept this but God never asked you that part of it he asked you can you see the message that I brought to you in that message is your revival in that message is your freedom I'm tired of hearing the excuses of why I can't live this message this message Amon is your freedom remember the RAM says this now I think these things are important in light of the things that are all going on that there's spirits rising up because freedom is being expressed I know I'm just I'm giving you an overview of Nehemiah Nehemiah was coming to a broken-down city and then have been hard work to just get the temporary stores but the walls were all broken down in a walled city a city that has no walls has no control amen and here here they are he's coming to a city that's the walls are broken down but the restoration is coming in the restoration there's gonna be names called lineage is going to be restored again I mean the temples going to be purged out the uncleanness is going to be purged out the music of David is going to come back again so God was restoring everything because it was a time of restoration speaking of this hour when Hagee I came came in and he was he was he was exhorting them to to build the temp on he and he spoke to them and he and he told them he says you work and you live in your nice homes and you work amen and you take your money and you put it in a bag with holes he says you you live in a nice home and the temple of God is not built why is the temple of God not built here he is he's pragmatic he's looking at what needs to be done he says get up there in the mountain and chop some wood so he's looking at the people and what they're not doing but then here comes actor aisle working right alongside of them and he sees the high priest standing there in another realm he sees him there with an unclean garments amen he sees the angel of the Lord standing right beside him and he also sees Satan standing at his right hand to resist him but God never allowed that so that Satan to open his mouth he just that angel said take away the unclean garment put a clean one on and put a mitre upon his head why the work of restoration was on well let me tell you we can look around and we can see what needs to be done but there's also something else happening in the unseen realm and may God open our eyes and see that God is here amen to see that the work is finished brother Branham says this she said the message of the seventh angel the mission of God would be known all these Trinitarian things false baptisms and everything was to be made manifest God help us to see what's truth he said I feel that spirit rescinding that you see I'm not speaking of myself brother I'm speaking of the angel of the Lord that's in the camp so he said a false Trinity was rising not in the early days it would be it wouldn't be made manifest in two days it went right on through with it but when the seven seals were open those mysteries revealed what that was those he said those frogs those three unclean spirits like frogs come out to manifest himself a Trinity doctrine against the truth notice when the truth opens how Satan gonna fight it these unclean spirits would come out against the truth by looking back anything I looked back it's going to get its source from somewhere else and in that looking back they never looked to the original source but they look back to the wrong thing amen brother Branham goes on to say what did God say about that evil spirit said these are Devils go forth gods of the earth working miracles deceive them in the last days and will succeed in doing it he said what did God say about that evil spirit it said I'll go down and get in the mouths of those prophets it calls him to prophesy lied I cause they had to come out of there to be destroyed and God says go you'll be successful you'll get them to believe it they're not on that word to begin with and you're persuading a man's a brother man who said I don't I don't care what they said back there at Nicaea I'm saying what they said up here at the throne what would be not what was but what will be for he's the I am you see the message came from the throne it never came back from some man's organization right so now the message of the Kings word will be revealed in the people of Jerusalem this is how we know that is being revealed because it's revealed in the people by the strengthening of their hands to do the work all along in the book of Nehemiah these spirits never believed Nehemiah's message so it shouldn't be a surprise that they don't believe it today you know I think we need to be aware of Satan's tactics because brother BAM says Satan studies us you know he's studying you right hey look look at their look they tend to sleep when they come to church that's their nature to sleep I'm gonna make sure that person never hears anything that comes from that pulpit because he doesn't realize how close he is to his deliverance so then I will do all in my power to Lock and to hinder him with the cares of life with his thoughts with his job with his talents with his ambitions I cloud his mind so the world won't make no sense to him and the hand of faith can't reach out and get it I'm gonna block him from receiving his deliverance why Church is boring in new anyway isn't it see Satan is a blocking hindering spirit and he studies us brother man said he studies your strategy with the word he looks at how you used the word and then he makes his plans from there well you know how nice it is for him to be able to tell his helpers look he don't use the word at all he hears it he goes out he know he's easy we can gobble him up any time because he studies us well we ought to know him and we ought to know how to overcome him we ought to not be ignorant of his devices then when we come into the house of God we're coming with this I'm not fulfilling my duty I'm doing more than my duty John I'm not coming to church tonight so you will think I'm a Christian that's not why I'm here I'm not here preaching so you'll think I'm a preacher that's not why I'm here amen I am called Amen to fulfill a position in this hour that God wants to use me for and God wants to do the same with you when I Amen I Amen in the spirit when I pray I pray in the spirit when I sing I sing in the spirit why I'm filling a place God has predestinated me to be hallelujah brother yeah what's your name again I know it but I just can't remember see huh brother Ernest Meadows yeah I knew your name was Ernest thank you for telling me hey I knew it I knew your name you know for the first time I come here he's been there doing his duty how old are you brother Ernest sorry for asking you but hey man 84 how long has he been sitting there doing that 88 hey ain't that good you're older and you thought you was we can adjust anybody's age here your weight your height anything any man but you know you sit there and you know two people they've someone make it aggravating no oh he doesn't beat that drum but God says hey let's come watch Ernest hit that drum you know why because we are fulfilling a place in this holler that nobody else can fulfill it Amen I am going to be here you are called to be here and God is restoring you now hey hey you may say well I just don't know what part to play I'm the guy that just comes in here and don't know what I'm doing well but God may say huge start amen and that word a little bit some will open up before you never saw before was I found in the book of Nehemiah they used every person in there and it wasn't Plato that was doing the restoration it wasn't Aristotle it wasn't these great warriors it was everybody I mean there were nobody that became somebody by the restoration power of God I want to ask you a question who in the world do you think you are that you are here believing a king's message [Applause] how do we have ears to hear a king's message tonight because God said these are my people this is the gates of Zion I love tsiyon blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen God called you in this hour before he'd ever called Moses he never caught Noah he called you [Applause] hallelujah I the king's message brother BAM said when that little cockney was handed that message from the king just a little soldier he said this is the King's message and this is the seal don't you let anybody stop you and off he went running they try to stop me said get out of my way hallelujah the book of Ezra when they were building the temple there was a bunch of complainers and resistors against the building the restoration and then they wrote back to the king and said listen this rebellious City these bunch of rebels are building what's been destroyed by the Kings and you know there was a rebellious city before they won't pay the Kings taxes they won't give tribute they think they're somebody that King went and searched and he found out about it libel says he wrote another law he sent back and he made him cease the building by force and by power by force and by power he made him stop and for 19 years they never spell built on the temple that's why God had to send prophets that's why prophets have to be involved because a man without a revealed word there's no power in the people they're just another nominal Church well let me just tell you churches are closing their doors every week reason is because there's no power there no power to heal them when I say heal I'm not just talking about heal your body of sickness until I heal their sins say their sins sickness there's no power there so because there's no power they have to compromise with the powers that be because the weapon they have is not greater than the enemies so because it's not greater than the enemies they begin to concede to the national pressure of the gender question of the homosexual question of the marriage question they have to do all these things because there's no power in their church oh they can say nice things and they can say the name of Jesus but it's another Jesus not the one we're acquainted with not the pillar of fire Amen that led them out of Egypt and stood between them and the enemy amen and and destroyed an entire amen Egyptian army in one night hey let me tell you my God is not the god of the Baptists he's the God of the people that's in the Baptist Church but my god is not a Baptist God my God's not a Catholic God God or a Pentecostal God my God is the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob my god is the god amen of William Branham that's my god so in the book of Esther the building was stopped and this is the inspiration these three men some Balaton to buy engage them now can I can I just give you their background because you're going to find out brother and sister you knew these guys all along these guys come to church and they're part and the whole time that's promised was being lived out in the awakening of God's people to the work at hand this ammonite spirit because some ballot is a mall bite and to buy an I think it's interesting that Tobias called the servant okay so he's the ammonite and they have another sympathizing partner and he's an Arabian who's a wanderer give him the wanderer and then to buy the servant the guy who makes himself a useful and then symbolic the Moabite two brothers that God said I don't want them in my congregation now don't you dare go to try to put names to it God already named them it's not up to you to name them but it is up to you to know the spirit because you find out you never find a physical description of Tobiah our sim ballot anywhere never says he's six-foot broad-shouldered curly hair brown eyes black eyes mustache Lynette never said he looks like Ron or his sons or you or our earnest Meadows and it don't give a physical description but it gives their nature because that's what you're going to find out they have a voice it tells how they talk it don't say how they look and you know them by the way their nature is not by the way they look because spirits are generational they just move from generation to generation amen these critical spirits no longer look like Pharisees come on they move they just keep moving they men spirits don't die the vessel they're in may die but spirits don't die and they move on they will die one day amen and they're dying in a lake of fire but while they're here amen we have a message and Nehemiah told them when they begin to talk back to him and says you don't have a right to build these walls you don't have a right to be healed you don't have a right to be restored he said let me tell you something you have no right in Jerusalem I don't find your name there I mean you have no portion there's no land been given to you in Jerusalem and you have no memorial you have no place in the Word of God that's the first thing we got to realize when the enemies come against you hey man this enemy doesn't have a ride over my body because my Bible said he's the savior of the body and he's not just the savior of the mystical body of Christ he's a savior of my body and is ammonite spirit if you're fine read your Bibles and go back at the look at the history of me know many times we read the Bible like a newspaper we just skimmed through the things we don't see them put in the order that they're put in because even God is is saying something out of this book that's alive today and we'll help you as animal ammonites spirit is a blocking hindering spirit that opposed their advances in the kingdom and so when we're speaking of these tribes we're speaking of evil spirits that are at work in this generation even as they've worked in all generations let me just let me say this with brother Branham never has there been a ministry since the time of Jesus Christ that the spirits were so exposed for what they were listen you don't have to have another man come and explain to you to tell you whether brother Branham was right or wrong on this you just go look for yourself if you let another man tell you what it is you're lazy if you only believe it because of another man amen you're lazy and you're not really concerned about the condition of your soul amen but God sent you a message so great a man that a prophet would say you could hide from the doctors but you cannot hide from God until the enemy spirit was so exposed in this hour not just the show he's exposed but to show your position hey hey that's why Nehemiah would look at those men and they would say you don't have a right to build here don't you know what the King law said hey man don't you know all these things but he had a message and he had a seal he'd been in the presence of the king himself he knew what he was talking about I know I had my watch set on a timer I don't know if it's gonna do any good brother Ram said the message faith 1956 he talked about the maniac that came on the platform and and was going to break every bone in his body he'd been a problem with other meetings and he said but I looked and he said it may sound strange I heard myself talking but it was a Holy Spirit speaking was a Bible says take no thought what you shall say but it'll be added to you then and I said because you have defied the Spirit of God tonight you'll fall over my feet see brother man I wasn't thinking of saying that that's what the Holy Spirit said and he said well I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over and I you understand he thought he was talking to the messenger he thought he was defying God's man he was only looking at the cover God was using and he said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over and he put his hand back to hit him and he said I said Satan come out of the man in the name of the Lord Jesus and he had his arm back to strike and he started going 200 and his eyes rolled back and he started going around and around and he fell down and laid across my feet and I couldn't move anyway so there had been a challenge made and the Spirit of God and the spirit was in him both of them made a challenge so then something had to happen oh my the policeman in the audience was waiting the policeman says the man did I said no sir they said as he healed I said no sir he worships that spirit he won't give it up do you realize there's some people that close to the Kings message but won't give up the spirit that's in him and he wouldn't give it up and he said he said he worships him that spirit he won't give it up he said but he said but I wish you would move him off of my feet so when they got over there I just turned around with the only as I said as I was saying faith is the substance of things hoped for and a man sitting in a wheelchair just raised up a lady on the stretcher and just got up everything in there was healed right there and they packed them away and the next morning great big truck going down the street and people singing only believe walking behind this big truck full of stretchers and wheelchairs and everything he said what was it the chief of that tribe of demons hindering Malakand spirit the chief of the tribe of demons had made the challenge and lost it and that's when the Spirit of God struck the building and everything was healed you see it's not that the Spirit of God is not here to strike the building but there's a blocking hindering spirit that has to be addressed Nehemiah knew if I got a Kings message amen with the Kings inspiration to restore then I have a right to tell those men they have no right here in this city they have no place here in this city they have no Memorial here remember these spirits of tribes is what hindered the children of Israel from having complete victory in the revelation of the promised land let's just stop a little bit look at the ammonites and the Moabites i'm just trying to give you a history lesson but to show you what their nature is and you'll find out you've met these the ammonite people are descendants of lot and they're a constant enemy of Israel they're a generational enemy this is not a one-time event that I'm talking about this is just the last event of the Old Testament that they come against Israel they've been cursed by God because it cannot enter into the congregation of the Lord because they never helped Israel in their Exodus I want you understand there's a people who are not interested in you going to your promise so they're gonna say anything against it because they're not there to help you go into the Promised Land they're there to stop you and they were relatives of Israel no no that's not what you think it is no brother branham didn't mean it that way no no you're not supposed to sing like that no that's not what see blocking hindering spirits something that will just try to cause doubt to rise up in your mind and that doubt will hinder the move of the Holy Spirit no no we don't need the Holy Spirit to move like that anymore that was just for them back there you know come on Israel you know that Exodus is not for you I'm not gonna let you through my land you can't come through my land singing like that you can't come through my land walking like that oh I think I know that spirit I think it's still alive it's probably even here tonight oh I'm not saying people I'm saying spirits that spirit I'll anoint your mind the Exodus isn't for you now you see these ammonites weren't real powerful people they were just blockers that would join themselves with others against the cause the Moabites weren't real powerful people they had to go get hireling prophets they didn't have the power in themself we can get somebody to curse Israel because I know listen I know some of the secret places here in this church and let me tell you about them I can bring you to some places and show you some Whoopi doozies and run spencer's Church it's gonna blow your mind your have your wanna curse them when you get done well let me tell you some problems in this message I can show you some real problems you know that man was not of God he called himself a prophet but let me just tell you I can show you some places in these people that could never be the children of God that spirit is still alive if you don't he don't walk in robes and in the Old Testament carb but he got websites and he's got all kinds of things to attract our weak ones and they go around and say I can go to the hot parts the parts you can't climb too and I can show you things about this message and never knew come on Balaam personal amen God said I told you not to go down there and curse them but if you try you open up your mouth I'm gonna put my words in them you're just a hireling anyway you don't have enough your donkey's more spiritual than you are come on let me tell you because at least they could see the angel of the Lord and they could see the move of the Holy Spirit then we got some blocking hindering spirits in this heart that try to come against the prophet of God but I they did the same with Moses but I want you to know something the shout of the king is in this camp [Applause] I said the shout of the king is in this camp they may not see him but God is here who is a king of glory he's a Lord mighty in battle who is this ham a knight who is just smaller by that said they know more about this message Amen than what God does listen me the name of the Lord you may save William branham's a false prophet but if you go back and read your Bible you'll find out he had exactly that Elijah's spirit in him and you'll find out a min that Malachi which means my messenger stood there and rebuked the priesthood that's why they don't want William Brandon's message this is why I'm against organized religion this is why I'm against Jezebel religion that should be the name of the Lord the shout of the king is in the camp [Applause] his spirit says you're not gonna make it his spirit says you're not gonna go through he spirit says that's all you do is stand up and clap that's all God you got well maybe that's what you're called to do David a man he had a revelation of it he said I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God you know why he said that because he heard what Moses said about the sons of Korah about Korah who see he said go back to your tents of wickedness David said I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God in the dwell and the tents of wickedness Amen I'd better be the guy that opens the door and welcomes you in because that's where God is let me tell you something God is in this message this is God's message this is the King's message to you this is your hour of restoration this is your city this is your revelation you gonna let some emanate you're gonna let some Moabite Amen not tell you that tell you it's not yours I'll tell you what I say you have no right in this word [Applause] let me tell you something on Balaam just because you got a computer don't mean you got a revelation just because you're a printer don't mean you know what the Prophet says just because you can preach don't mean your card just because you got charisma don't mean you have Amen the inspiration of God behind it don't give me your letters and letters aren't for me they're on your father locked who wants long what was a man who could walk with the message but couldn't go all the way with the message that's who their father was they had an illegitimate birth that's the problem he's been these ammonites these Moabites came out of incestuous relationship with lot who couldn't walk with Abraham's message and chose the green plains of Sodom to live and even when the angel came to save him and said come quickly I can do nothing until you come hither he said don't let me go to that mountain let me go to that city always trying to change this is that spirit they can't go all the way and then get in the congregation these spirits get in the congregation says give up did you hear what they said over there did you hear what they're saying about the message now did you actually realize William Branham didn't know what he was talking about didn't you know he was a deceiver let me just tell you what I do know one thing I do know is I've heard your voice before and your voice comes from illegitimate sea you've never been born right that's what your problem is so if you've never been born right why would I let somebody who's not been born right try to tell me how a prophet cells ain't gonna know what it means anyhow they better go buy some donkey so they can understand what God is saying let me just tell you something comes a time you get shocked why people begin falling away and you go oh how can this be but after wise they keep on doing they don't get shocked anymore I get angry who do you think you are to try to stand up and say I know more about that pillar fire then the man came in the cities here a man I know this my grandmother set right in front of him he told her who she was a man he told her whatever her problem was she was healed of it from that day forward I saw my grandmother died she never went to hell but the angels of God came and carried her over onto the other side let me tell you something about this message this message don't produce a bunch of locks that go back to the world this message does not produce a bunch of ammonites you can't go all the way this message produces sons and daughters of God that should be the name of the Lord [Applause] I don't need a history lesson on the message of william branham to know that this message is right all I gotta do is look right there and say there's a proof this message is the proof of his resurrection new people [Applause] you know what them spirits of ammonites you know what those spirits told Jeptha said that's our land give us our land we want our land it wasn't Israel's land you know what jephthah told them he said Who am I to give back what God dispossessed from you if God took it from you let your God take it back let me tell you about all these detractors here's what they can do they can say what's wrong but they can't get back what they once thought they had they once sang with you they once raised their hands with you but they had no right North portion Norma Morial God couldn't find their name a member what did he do he brought up out of Babylon people out of the cursed city of Jericho they had names they said I'm from Jericho God says come on up you can come in this land and help restore it but God never called the ammonite and he never called them all back to be part of the restoration God doesn't need any spirit that knows more than him about restoration to help you see that was Satan's problem oh we're finding out really where there's a man died spirit come from Satan's problem thought he would be God Satan thought I can be worshipped let me tell you if somebody will know more than God about creation they're going to know more than William Branham about his message and they're going to tell you that boy in Finland wasn't raised from the dead they're going to tell you the cloud wasn't what you thought it was let me just want you to know something I am NOT interested in hearing to buy a tell me why the laws can't be built [Applause] you see toe bio was called a servant he presented himself as a minister for years and he actually had wedded his way into the priesthood Eli should the high priest he was actually built gave him a room in one of the storage rooms of the temple he had a room in the house of God uh ma'am and I had a room in the house of God where the treasure was stored no wonder these guys know so much about the message I mean if you live where the treasures are you're probably going to get a little curious about what's in them and what's wild to buy I could come out of that room and quote a message but it didn't mean it was his brother Danny are you mad absolutely I'm furious what I'm furious about is that we don't realize that these spirits when they keep us from our victory they don't want you to stand up and say these are my children this is my home I've deal with so many discouraged depressed people that call themselves saints of the Most High I want to tell you the first step of victory is your attitude the first step of your children coming back home is you telling God I thank you for bringing them back home your first step of healing is say God I thank you for Isaiah 53 I can put my name in there amen Danny a man was healed by those stripes you know why I have a portion I have a right I have a memorial I don't have spiritual amnesia anymore you don't know it but I've already done three somersaults Alleluia you know it'd be awesome to see a German do a somersault wouldn't it bullets flying everywhere and rust and everything else anyway and there's another thing when when Jeff had told those ammonites that you know they're going to take the land as the Bible said they wouldn't listen to the words of Jeff though I've heard that guy I've met that guy he wouldn't listen I never said what he looked like so don't ask me there's another scripture let's just go to first samuel 11 we're just we're reading their history their history is not a good one I'll close soon Tobiah asked when are you going to close don't you know the most successful services are 45 minutes I've been in the Kings treasure room I'm gonna tell you something to buy it by the time this church gets done with you you're not gonna have a cot in there there's not going to be a hangar in there with your clothes on it you're gonna be out of the house of God you're gonna be away away from them because you don't have a right here do we understand that when we begin to become in harmony with the world brother ham says Amen that we become in harmony together he said in five minutes time there wouldn't be one sick person in the building there wouldn't be one person designed the Holy Ghost but they would get it and I say let's get symbolic in the ho Enda and to buy in the Arabians out of here I don't need no wandering spirit in my congregation wonder if this is right wonder if that's right let me tell you this message is right I don't need no Arabians [Applause] okay you better strike that part because in this political age and he said you hear that racist preacher he said they didn't need Arabians in that church just that's the way to buy it is you don't get it well let's look at another ammonite for just a minute this is his ancestors first the First Samuel 11:1 then a hash the ammonite came and encamped against jabish Khalid in all the minute jabish said unto nae hash make a covenant with us and we're serve you you know jay-bez means dry these people lived in a dry place and they're always willing to make a covenant a compromise what somebody seems to have power over them and they has the ammonite answered them on this condition I'll make a covenant with you that I'll thrust out your right eyes and lay up for a reproach upon Israel and the elders of Jabez sudden him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers into all the coasts of Israel and then if there's no man to save us we'll come out to thee you see we're going to look for a savior for seven days if we can't find anybody to answer this question we're come out and make a covenant with you and we'll let you go ahead and poke out our right eyes you know what that meant in the antiquity they said they said they poked out the right eye was that was the eye that would look over the shield that they would hold in battle and they'd poke out their eye that could look that means they couldn't find any more since that old ammonites spirit he wants to make a covenant with you just give us seven days and then came the messengers to give you a saw and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lift up the voice and sang songs of victory and says they wept just the problem they accept anything to devil try just shut down their throat and behold Saul came after the herd out of the field and Saul said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the timings of the meningitis and the Spirit of God came upon saw when he heard those tidings and his anger was current kindled greatly you know needed to happen him in the spirit of God needed to stir up the spirits of man amen so that they could see with the greater vision than what the ham and I was trying to give him neh hash means serpent so here's this man called serpent who is trying to make a covenant with them something that would seem greater than the promise they already had God had already told him there Abraham seed God had said Abraham's seed would possess the gate of his enemies and here comes the enemy saying make a covenant with me and they said if we can't find a Savior in seven days we'll do it well let me tell you hey man we've been through the dark ages we're not in the Dark Ages anymore the spirit have come the spirit has come and kindled greatly in this hour upon men and women of God hey man brother Branham said it like this is this all right that I go just a little bit further I won't hold you much longer but I sure didn't get to bye and all these guys fixed but they're fixed anyhow we all know the story of brother Branham what he went through how he lost his wife and his baby daughter how Satan moved up and tried to make a covenant with him because he was in a dry place you would be too if you just lost your wife and your daughter's dying and you're seeing her suffering so hard her eyes are cross and the Flies are on her body brother BAM said because he refused to walk the way God had called him to walk that he suffered greatly for it he said his church dwindled his daddy died his brother died his mother died or sorry his his wife died and his baby daughter died many things was attributed to that wrong decision and in that dry time of the Prophet Satan moved up said after all that God has done for you you prayed for people and they've been healed you preached the gospel all that you've done for God and now when your daughter is dying and you ask God to heal there he won't even answer your prayer because a black sheet had fallen down in front of him it was very dry brother ben said i opened up my mouth to say that's right then if he'll be that way i'll no longer serve him he said i opened up my mouth to say that and when he did the Spirit of God moved up and says William Branham who are you anyhow and you know what it turned the whole situation around to where brother Branham says a naked I came into the world naked I go out though God slay me yet I'll trust him he laid his hand on his baby daughter says said honey I'm gonna see you again one day what was that he said it was an anchor that was down there that moved up I want to tell you about what happened there brother Graham said after that time there was a one cross-eyed baby that I saw that God wouldn't heal it brother Branham would look at that cross-eyed condition she said I hate that devil and he hates me you know brother I said when enjoy your stats clips baby died and he wrote a letter to him and I've got I've got the copy of it in my notes electronically not in paper everything's electronic nowadays I brother Bantam was writing them and he was talking to them about his baby dying about where he saw her and everything and he was just writing a consoling letter and he says you know I was thinking one day about all that I went through I'm just thinking I just couldn't go through that again but in something said but would you go through that again k said I looked and I saw all the souls that came to the Lord because of me telling that story and I saw all the thousands that were healed and he said I would go through it all over again let me tell you the enemy couldn't stop and then he's not going to stop him now I've told this testimony before I might have told it here and I'll close with this I I'll let go by and symbolic go to bed you're tired and the Arabian will wonder off somewhere but not in your bed not in your church like these hinder and blocking spirit says you don't have no right to build these walls let me tell you got a right to restoration I have got a right amen to pray over my family I've got a right to pray over my sister I got a right to pray over my family and say Satan you have no right over them give them back you got a right I've probably told this before here I don't know and you might have heard it but you're gonna hear it again because Satan doesn't like it I was in Mexico and a pastor there had told me this testimony about a brother who was dealing with the spirit and a girl and he told that girl right he said I tried to cast that spirit out and that spirit wouldn't move and he said I did everything I knew how to get that spirit out he said it wouldn't move and eventually it spoke out of that girl on a man's voice said she's mine there's nothing you can do to make me come out he said then a thought flashed across me and I went and got a book of brother branham that had the picture of the pillar of fire in it and I brought that book back to the girl and I opened it up to that picture of the pillar of fire and I said do you know who this man is they said that voice spoke back out of the girl said that's William Branham I was cast out of one of his services in Jonesboro Arkansas okay now this is decades later and that man stood there and said then in the name of jesus christ whom william branham preached come out of the girl and the girl was free now I want to tell you something people have forgot people have forgot what the glory of God was like and is like people doubt it but I want to tell you this the devil is scared to death that you will realize it because if he still remembering church services that he was cast out decades ago why don't we refresh his memory again and why don't we show him what it's like amen to do it today and tell that devil you don't have no right here you don't have no right to live in my home you don't have no right to block my children from receiving the Holy Spirit you don't have no right to hinder their healing this is my house this is my city this is my words hey it's two men I don't want in this congregation so what do you tell them
