[36:00] humble ourselves before you in the name
[36:02] of Jesus Christ amen amen if you have
[36:06] your Bibles we we'd like to look over in
[36:08] the book of Isaiah chapter 31 and then
[36:11] to Romans chapter 8 and 1 John the first
[36:14] John the Epistle of John chapter
[36:19] 4 thank you I was I was studying last
[36:24] week while we were in the
[36:26] meetings and and uh I'd been looking for
[36:28] some quotations on brother brandham
[36:31] would make about having services in
[36:33] auditoriums and Arenas and while I was
[36:36] looking for these quotes of Lord just
[36:38] dropped this thought in my heart and and
[36:41] I I'd like to speak to you just for a
[36:44] few minutes and uh on God is in your
[36:48] corner God is in your corner and and one
[36:51] of the quotations I was looking at was
[36:53] brother Brandon I'm just going to just
[36:55] kind of read just portion of it but in
[36:59] there brother Brandon would say he said
[37:00] I won the bantamweight championship of
[37:02] three
[37:03] states and was not defeated he said I
[37:06] give it up to preach the gospel he said
[37:08] but I tell you I got a greater fight now
[37:10] than I ever had in all my life he said I
[37:13] ain't F fighting my buddy I'm fighting
[37:15] the devil just as hard as I can and I
[37:18] always remember the different techniques
[37:20] and way to watch and different things
[37:21] from the guard and so forth in boxing
[37:24] and you have to be certainly on your
[37:25] toes when you're fighting this great
[37:27] great enemy that we have now amen Isaiah
[37:31] CH 31 and verse one woe to them that go
[37:36] down to Egypt for help and stay on
[37:39] horses and Trust in chariots because
[37:42] they are many and Horsemen because they
[37:44] are very strong but they look not on the
[37:47] Holy One of Israel neither seek the Lord
[37:51] yet he also is wise and will bring evil
[37:54] and will not call back his words but
[37:56] will arve
[37:58] against the house of the evildoers and
[38:00] against the help of them that work
[38:02] iniquity now the Egyptians are men and
[38:05] not God and their horses are flesh and
[38:08] not Spirit when the Lord shall stretch
[38:10] out his forth against him he will not be
[38:12] afraid of their voice nor obas himself
[38:15] for the noise of them so shall the Lord
[38:18] of hosts come down to fight for Mount
[38:21] Zion and for the heal thereof Romans
[38:26] 8:31 so notice in the last scripture
[38:29] there verse four the noise didn't scare
[38:31] the lion away from his prey there was a
[38:33] lot of voices that came in amongst that
[38:35] line but Jesus are voices of men that
[38:38] raise against his will Romans
[38:42] 8:31 what shall we say to these things
[38:45] if God be for us who can be against us
[38:49] and then 1 John chapter 4 and verse
[38:52] four ye are of God little children and
[38:56] have overcame them because greater is he
[38:59] that is in you than he that is in the
[39:02] world may God bless his word you may be
[39:04] seated tonight here in the presence of
[39:05] the Lord as we said we' like to speak to
[39:07] you on God is in your corner mother
[39:11] brandom in he that is in you he said he
[39:14] said if we could only receive this truth
[39:16] he said not just a now just a moment he
[39:19] said if we could only realize what this
[39:21] scripture mean he said he that is in you
[39:25] is greater than he that's in the world
[39:27] he said we can't understand that yet we
[39:30] say we believe it we know it's true but
[39:32] we really don't understand it Greater is
[39:35] he that is in you than he that is in the
[39:38] world so here is a prophet speaking to
[39:41] well-trained Christians he said we say
[39:43] that we believe it he said but we really
[39:44] don't understand it he said but greater
[39:47] is he that is in you than he that's in
[39:49] the world he said what is in you that's
[39:51] greater it's Christ the Anointed God
[39:54] that was in Christ is in you greater is
[39:57] he that is in you than he that is in the
[39:59] world then if he is in you it's not what
[40:01] in he said it's not you anymore living
[40:04] it's him living in you it's not your
[40:06] thinking what you would think about this
[40:08] it's what it's what he said about this
[40:11] then if he is in you he would absolutely
[40:14] would not deny what he said he couldn't
[40:17] do it but he would keep what he has said
[40:20] he is trying to find a person that he
[40:23] can vindicate himself
[40:25] through again in here ye him I would
[40:28] like to draw this draw this together
[40:31] basically this thought tonight from this
[40:33] entire context brother random would say
[40:36] he said one day when Adam's race was
[40:38] backed in the to a corner where the law
[40:41] and the judgments and the prophets and
[40:42] everything that had been sent had failed
[40:44] nothing could be done the human race was
[40:47] doomed and great armies of hell were
[40:49] marching on well trained in their ranks
[40:51] and every man to his place they backed
[40:53] Adam's children into the corner where
[40:55] they could go no further they sent the
[40:57] law and they couldn't keep it they sent
[40:59] judgments they wouldn't listen to it
[41:01] they plunged right on they sent the
[41:03] prophets and they stoned those and
[41:05] nothing could be done they were backed
[41:07] into a corner but in glory one day the
[41:10] most precious thing Heaven of Heaven
[41:12] stepped out before the angels of God and
[41:15] said this day I will give my life for
[41:17] the sons of Adam this day will I do
[41:20] something that'll break the ranks of the
[41:22] enemy the angels all said what will you
[41:24] do what will you do and he came to Earth
[41:27] a virgin at a Calvary when he went to
[41:29] Calvary he stood on this Earth and he
[41:31] preached the gospel said I'm going to
[41:33] give you some material I want you to go
[41:35] up to the city of Jerusalem and I want
[41:37] you to wait there for I'm going to dress
[41:40] you I'm going to make you soldiers to
[41:41] fight against the Ws of the enemy but
[41:44] first before you go into Battlefront go
[41:46] up to Jerusalem and wait there and what
[41:49] I give you you follow me and fight as
[41:52] best as you can I say what God has given
[41:55] unto us we ought to do everything that
[41:57] within us and we ought to fight the best
[41:59] that we can he said there on the D dark
[42:01] day of Calvary the Lamb of God the
[42:03] precious son of God that came down from
[42:06] Glory never taken the way of
[42:07] denomination he never taken the way of
[42:09] some easy Road he never taken the form
[42:12] of some ecclesiastical system but he
[42:15] went to the darkest and the roughest
[42:16] part of the spears the Valley of the
[42:18] shadow of death and he grabbed all the
[42:20] death and threw and threw it into his
[42:22] bosom and he died a hero and he sent
[42:25] down the Holy Ghost on the day of
[42:26] Pentecost lost he said now men and women
[42:29] we've got he said what we've got let's
[42:32] fight there's good Corner coaches and
[42:33] there's bad Corner coaches and I believe
[42:35] that if we're going to be in a fight we
[42:37] want the best that we can absolutely get
[42:39] because I believe that we are in a fight
[42:41] for our life I believe that we're in a
[42:43] fight for the supernatural we're in a
[42:45] fight for our ministry we're in a fight
[42:47] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're
[42:49] in a fight for Supernatural events we're
[42:51] we're in a fight to leave this whole
[42:53] world we are we are in the greatest
[42:55] fight that ever has been and not just
[42:58] here in our mind but it's something that
[42:59] that's where the battle starts but I
[43:01] believe that if we're going to fight in
[43:03] this battle then we want the very best
[43:05] corner coat that we can absolutely get
[43:08] we want somebody that that has watched
[43:10] Men that not just rose up and fail but
[43:12] men that rose up to be real champions of
[43:15] Deliverance me real champions of Victory
[43:19] and that good Corner coach he he knows
[43:21] his fighter he has he has studied that
[43:24] fighter and he knows what the fighters
[43:26] reach is he knows what his weight is he
[43:29] knows how that he's going to stand in
[43:32] the fight he he has studied that man he
[43:34] has spent he has spent time studying out
[43:37] his D there are certain men that can
[43:39] only fight for maybe certain rounds so
[43:41] he has got to train them in such a way
[43:44] so that he he maybe he gets to the fifth
[43:46] got to pull his man from the
[43:48] fight he knows when the fight is too
[43:51] much on him so he he literally when he
[43:54] gets to that spot where he has watched
[43:55] him he throws in the tow in the tow
[43:58] because he recognized that they were in
[44:00] a war of of attrition and that Muhammad
[44:02] Ali was literally going to kill Joe
[44:04] Fraser and Joe Frasier got so mad at
[44:07] Eddie fooch because he going to put
[44:09] anything upon us that we are not going
[44:12] to be able to fa that that we're not
[44:13] going to be able to handle but God is
[44:15] faithful he is faithful in such a way
[44:18] that he knows how much we can handle he
[44:20] knows how much we can take he knows how
[44:23] much we can go through so the Bible said
[44:25] that in that time in that Temptation
[44:28] that God Will Make A Way of Escape for
[44:31] us when we get to that spot of the
[44:34] battle when we can't go no far far
[44:37] further in our fight when we can't go no
[44:39] more in our emotional realm when we
[44:41] can't go no more in our Humanity God
[44:43] says I'm going to step
[44:46] in Hallelujah aren't you thankful that
[44:49] God has made a way you see it's just
[44:51] like when Noah had 120 years he was
[44:54] sitting there and he was preaching you
[44:56] see and Noah and his family was the only
[44:58] ones that was saved in the ark you see
[45:01] and they turned it down it was judgment
[45:03] to them but it what what it was to Noah
[45:06] was an
[45:06] atonement because it it gave him a way
[45:09] of escape and I know that God as a god
[45:13] that is called Jehovah Gyra that no
[45:15] matter how dark this place and he knows
[45:17] how much of Le osia that you can take so
[45:20] he's made a
[45:22] Rapture so that you can get out of it
[45:25] brother Adam said Satan May pin you in a
[45:27] corner with cancer but God Will Make A
[45:29] Way of Escape Satan May pin you down
[45:31] under a car but God Will Make A Way of
[45:34] Escape Satan may take your family away
[45:36] but God Will Make A Way of Escape God
[45:40] has a
[45:42] way now the corner man he is the he is
[45:45] the voice in the fight there's a
[45:48] thousand other voices in the fight
[45:50] there's a thousand other fans in the
[45:52] fight and his character he's been with
[45:54] him when he was bleeding he was he's
[45:56] been with with him when he was wounded
[45:58] in the battle he's been with him in pain
[46:01] so this man trust this voice he trust
[46:04] the voice of the guy that's in his
[46:06] corner he knows he won't let him go too
[46:08] far he knows how much it can take so he
[46:11] trusts that
[46:13] voice I say this unto you the god that
[46:16] is in your corner the voice that is in
[46:18] your corner knows how much you can take
[46:21] he knows you're going to win the battle
[46:28] you see that corner
[46:29] man he's got a voice and he knows his
[46:33] voice is the most important
[46:36] voice you see you see the fighter might
[46:40] hear the other voices but he's not
[46:42] paying attention to them voices he's not
[46:44] paying attention to the ecclesiastical
[46:46] system voices he's paying attention to
[46:48] the voice of the son of man because the
[46:50] son of man made him a promise he was not
[46:53] going to leave him here hallelujah that
[46:57] Corner man finds the right
[46:59] words he finds the right words for the
[47:02] boxer in the situation that he's in and
[47:05] the trick is to send that boxer back out
[47:08] there with the will and the knowhow and
[47:11] the belief that he's going to win you
[47:14] see if you got a corner man that's
[47:15] telling you you're not good enough you
[47:17] need to fire the corner man if you got a
[47:19] corner man that's telling you that
[47:21] you're never going to make it fire the
[47:23] corner man if you got a corner man that
[47:25] tells you that you're never going to be
[47:26] healed fire the corner man but if you
[47:29] got a corner man that says get back out
[47:31] there you were born for this you were
[47:34] born to take the
[47:39] paddle what is he doing he's grabbing
[47:42] the fleeting moments of the battle to
[47:46] refocus his athletes mind so that he
[47:51] takes him back to his
[47:54] training now I had to be honest with you
[47:56] I had to to do some real study to get
[47:58] into this mindset just to be
[48:00] honest because it's typically not the
[48:03] the world that I study in but I had to
[48:06] literally study to get myself in the
[48:08] mindset of a corner
[48:09] man and I I I read what brother bandam
[48:12] said he said now I he said I don't watch
[48:14] that he said I don't watch Boxing no
[48:16] more and I don't listen to it on radio
[48:17] he said because he said it's in my blood
[48:21] he said he said it's in my blood you
[48:24] understand what he's saying I to be
[48:25] honest with you I studied this out I I
[48:27] spent some time I spent some time
[48:29] listening to the great Corner man's I
[48:31] spent some time listening to Mike
[48:32] Tyson's Corner man I spent some time
[48:34] listening to to Muhammad Ali and Joe
[48:36] frasers I listened to their voices and I
[48:39] have to be honest with you you wouldn't
[48:41] want to showed up in my study right
[48:42] there cuz I tell you what it was in my
[48:47] blood the corner
[48:50] man I'm glad you didn't show up but the
[48:54] corner man is the guy that if the
[48:56] boxer's winning and he's succeeding you
[48:59] don't see the corner man you don't see
[49:01] him you see the fighter but if the if
[49:05] the fighter has fallen and he's not
[49:07] succeeding and he and he has failed in
[49:10] his battle the corner man is the one
[49:12] that you see you see he's standing up
[49:14] between the public and his fighter oh I
[49:18] hope you hear what I'm saying to you you
[49:20] see because you see there might have
[49:22] been failures in your life but you don't
[49:24] see the fighter you see the corner man
[49:26] man you may have seen wounds you may
[49:29] have seen a battle but you don't see the
[49:32] mistakes you see the corner man because
[49:35] a corner man is a man that's been
[49:38] trained to talk to the public he's been
[49:40] trained to show
[49:43] up he knows how to handle the criticism
[49:46] he knows how to handle the mocking he
[49:48] knows how to handle when he's been when
[49:49] his Fighter's been defeated and the
[49:51] corner man he knows the words to
[49:55] say Lord
[49:59] a a top Corner
[50:01] man he's got to possess a range of
[50:05] complimentary attributes that many of
[50:07] people that'll they'll never attain in
[50:09] their life the corner man has got to
[50:12] have the ability to be able to detach
[50:15] himself from the
[50:17] boxer he can't let his feelings get
[50:20] involved because he's got to allow the
[50:22] fighter to fight he's got to allow him
[50:25] to get into the ring
[50:27] with not getting emotional about it
[50:29] because there's going to be times in the
[50:31] fight when his fighter doesn't look like
[50:33] he's winning so he's got to be able to
[50:36] detach himself so Jesus knows how good
[50:40] the battle that you're in is for
[50:43] you so he's not going to throw in the
[50:45] towel because he knows you got something
[50:47] on the inside of
[50:49] you that's willing to go the
[50:52] distance but at the at the same time the
[50:55] corner man's got to have an unwavering
[50:57] Devotion to the boxer's
[51:01] well-being the corner man has got a
[51:03] desire he has to have a desire to watch
[51:06] every characteristic of the boxer's
[51:10] performance but out of necessity he's
[51:13] got to examine every detail of the other
[51:16] guy he's got to study him and he's got
[51:20] to study his own people he's been
[51:22] studying Satan for 6,000 years but he's
[51:26] been studying you and he knows that what
[51:29] you got on the inside of you is where it
[51:31] has the ability to go all the way you
[51:34] see because what the other guy does not
[51:36] know is that the corner man deposited
[51:41] himself he deposited himself on the
[51:44] inside of the fighter so he knows
[51:47] Hallelujah he knows there's no give up
[51:49] in him he knows there's no
[51:52] backup because he deposited himself into
[51:56] him
[51:58] in the
[51:59] natural the corner man's got to be a
[52:03] psychologist he's got to be able to
[52:05] assist the fighter through the emotional
[52:09] mindfield that is in the preparation for
[52:12] combat the corner man's got to be a
[52:15] strategist he's got to have the knowhow
[52:17] how to handle the battle that's in front
[52:19] of him and the one that's that the one
[52:22] how much how he's going to throw punches
[52:24] he's got to have a strategy on how he's
[52:26] going to beat this guy the corner man's
[52:28] got to be a general he's got to be able
[52:30] to see what's going to take what's going
[52:32] to what it's going to take to secure
[52:35] Victory and offering the kind of
[52:37] tactical advice that can be put into
[52:41] practice in the in in the crucial battle
[52:43] that he's
[52:44] in this corner man's got to be n a
[52:49] nutritionist we got the best we can ever
[52:51] have because Jesus said man should not
[52:54] live by bread alone but by every word
[52:56] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[52:58] God and you're feeding off a seven
[53:00] course menu you got the best
[53:02] nutritionist that there can be the
[53:05] corner man's got to be a
[53:07] medic he sent his word and he healed
[53:10] them and he delivered them from their
[53:12] destructions the corner man's got to be
[53:14] a role
[53:16] model that's why Paul said let this mind
[53:19] be in you which was also in Christ
[53:23] Jesus in short a good man needs to
[53:27] possess a range of
[53:30] qualities I'd say we'd be here all night
[53:33] if we start to be able to express the
[53:36] attributes of almighty God you see as a
[53:38] corner
[53:40] man I hope it's okay if not if not I'll
[53:44] I'll preach to myself as a corner man
[53:48] it's not just that he's got to say the
[53:50] right words and be a motivational
[53:51] speaker but he's got to be honest with a
[53:54] fighter because the Bible said that iron
[53:56] sharpens iron is that right so a man
[53:59] sharpeneth the countenance of his friend
[54:02] so he's got to be honest with him like
[54:04] Angelo Dundee when when he was standing
[54:06] out there with Sugar Ray L and Tommy
[54:08] Hearns was whooping him in 1981 he took
[54:11] him all lat into the 14th round and he
[54:14] about about beat his brains out and and
[54:16] Sugar Ray Leonard he got into such a
[54:19] spot that that Tommy Hearns had put him
[54:21] into a place that that that that Tommy
[54:23] Hearns had had outpointed should Leonard
[54:27] in every single way
[54:28] possible when he got back in the corner
[54:31] Angelo Dundee stood there he didn't say
[54:34] hey you're doing all right just keep up
[54:35] what you're doing he didn't tell him
[54:37] that he said son you're blowing
[54:40] it you're blowing it sometimes you need
[54:43] a voice in your corner that say you're
[54:46] blowing the greatest chance you ever
[54:48] been given you've been given a chance at
[54:50] the Holy Ghost you've be given a chance
[54:53] to be a champion of the world you need
[54:55] somebody say you're blowing
[54:58] it you're blowing it you've got a chance
[55:02] at the message of the hour you got a
[55:04] chance at a supernatural event you're
[55:06] blowing
[55:08] it that's all it took for Sugar Ray
[55:11] Leonard he got back out there and put on
[55:13] the greatest show of boxing has ever
[55:16] seen in one round and in one round he
[55:19] turned the fight around
[55:23] Hall ah Hallelujah maybe you've been in
[55:26] that kind of a week or maybe been in
[55:27] that kind of a
[55:29] spot and a corner
[55:31] man he starts preaching on Divine
[55:34] Healing he starts preaching on
[55:36] clothesline religion he starts preaching
[55:38] on Holiness he starts and the corner man
[55:41] get your
[55:44] attention what are you going to do with
[55:46] this when you get done hearing the voice
[55:48] of the corner
[55:50] man sugar L Sugar Ray Leonard would have
[55:53] lost right there if he wouldn't have put
[55:54] into action with the corner man head
[55:57] that's
[55:58] right but it's known as one of the
[56:00] greatest rounds of boxing that's ever
[56:03] been seen because he listened to the
[56:11] voice now
[56:13] God is the ultimate
[56:18] trainer just as a coach prepares a boxer
[56:20] for each fight God prepare prepares and
[56:24] equips you for every battle that you
[56:26] going to face he provides you with
[56:28] wisdom he provides you with strength he
[56:31] provides you with guidance he provides
[56:33] you in every
[56:35] situation because he
[56:37] knows he knows the opponent that you're
[56:39] facing brother random would talk about
[56:41] it like this he said he said when I was
[56:43] going into a battle when I was going
[56:45] into a fight I think it's pretty awesome
[56:48] I think it's pretty awesome he had a
[56:49] prophet that had never lost the
[56:54] battle he was so serving a God that had
[56:57] never lost a
[56:59] battle he said but when I would get in
[57:01] there and I would train he said we
[57:03] studied out the mechanics of our
[57:05] opponent he said we studied him out how
[57:07] he used his eyes how he came out of the
[57:09] corner whether he ran or whether he Ste
[57:11] how he moved his feet where it was a jab
[57:13] or a punch of the throat he he said we
[57:15] studied
[57:16] him he said but we know the strike of
[57:19] the enemy he said we know what his
[57:21] tactics are and he said we're here
[57:23] tonight with the scripture to cover him
[57:25] up so he can't move cuz the enem is on
[57:28] every hand what are you saying in all
[57:30] this brother Andrew I'm saying God's
[57:32] given you every every tactic he's giving
[57:36] you every opportunity he's giving you
[57:38] every blessing he's giving you the
[57:40] greatest thing that he ever could give
[57:42] you to cover up
[57:47] Satan the Bible said that I am the way
[57:52] the truth and the life no man cometh
[57:55] unto me but my un come to the father but
[57:57] by me and the prophet said he said
[58:00] there's only you know there's two ways
[58:02] for all things he said you're aware of
[58:04] that he said that's your way and God's
[58:06] way and you can't be and have your way
[58:09] and be in God's way at the same time
[58:11] you've got to get out of your own way to
[58:13] let God have his way isn't that true he
[58:15] said if it it's he said it's either
[58:17] right or left he said if you're going he
[58:19] said if you're going your way you're out
[58:20] of God's way and if you cease from your
[58:22] own way you can you if you cease from
[58:26] your own way you get in God's
[58:31] way I hope I read that right and if you
[58:33] cease from your own way you get out of
[58:35] God's way God can have his way when you
[58:38] cease to have your way but as long as
[58:40] you're having your way God can't have
[58:42] his way so you've got to go one or the
[58:45] other ways so let's just let's just are
[58:48] on our own way drop tonight let's God
[58:51] have God's way because God has a way
[58:54] I'll say this our corner man knows a way
[58:58] because the Bible said in Isaiah 35 and8
[59:01] that a highway shall be there and a way
[59:03] and it shall be called the way of
[59:06] Holiness so God is saying I am the
[59:08] leader on this road I am a God to the
[59:11] wandering soul I am a teacher to the
[59:13] ignorant I am example to
[59:17] All I'm going to tell you right now
[59:20] you're not going to win this battle
[59:22] doing this on your
[59:23] own you're not going to conquer lay see
[59:26] you on your own you're not going to get
[59:28] out of your slack on your own there
[59:32] ain't the Bible or the Bible tells us he
[59:35] is the way so if we're going to find the
[59:37] way we've got to find
[59:41] him another B would talk about a chicken
[59:44] about it about it uh pipping its way
[59:46] through a through a through its eggshell
[59:49] he said they ain't found no better way
[59:51] for that that chicken to peep its way
[59:53] through there knock itself he said it's
[59:55] got a little it's it's got a little
[59:56] thing on the end of its beak and it just
[59:58] scratches along the eggshell and it's
[1:00:01] scratching in there he said he said they
[1:00:03] ain't found no better way for it he said
[1:00:05] because that's God's provided way he
[1:00:07] said but what that science doesn't
[1:00:09] recognize he said is that little bird is
[1:00:12] gaining strength while it's down there
[1:00:14] peeping and stretching its neck out it's
[1:00:17] down there and it's working trying to
[1:00:19] get its way out trying to peep its way
[1:00:21] out of that shell he said that's a way
[1:00:23] that a Christian's got to come they've
[1:00:25] got to come God's provided way you can't
[1:00:28] help them out of their trouble they got
[1:00:30] to get out of it
[1:00:33] themselves come on somebody we had
[1:00:36] somebody come here one time they was
[1:00:39] full gung-ho they was ready to make Full
[1:00:41] Gospel Lighthouse there their church
[1:00:43] until they found out that we didn't have
[1:00:44] a book where they could sign their
[1:00:47] name they well I can't do that I got to
[1:00:49] have something I can put my name on I
[1:00:51] tell you brother I tell you I got the
[1:00:54] best way God put my name name on his
[1:00:57] book before the foundation of the
[1:01:00] world I don't need to see my name
[1:01:03] written in pen of ink here in
[1:01:06] humanity as long as I can see it by the
[1:01:10] blood that's God's
[1:01:14] way he said that's the way it is with
[1:01:16] Christians he said if you take it away
[1:01:18] from them he said they're weak jellyfish
[1:01:20] Christians he said but if they come down
[1:01:23] to an altar and die after to themselves
[1:01:26] die out to their ideas he said that's
[1:01:28] God's provided
[1:01:32] way I got to studying that out how long
[1:01:35] it takes a chicken to break
[1:01:39] out it takes 21 days for him to break
[1:01:42] out of that's what science says I ain't
[1:01:43] sit there and watched it but I say are
[1:01:45] pretty
[1:01:46] close it takes about 20 it takes about
[1:01:49] three weeks for that chicken to stand
[1:01:52] there and while he's doing it science
[1:01:54] says while he's doing it I found this
[1:01:56] amazing for 21 days he's standing there
[1:01:59] and he's getting ready to Break Forth
[1:02:01] into New
[1:02:05] Opportunities he said sign said that
[1:02:08] that little chick has got to persevere
[1:02:11] to get outside of that
[1:02:13] shell you might been in a battle like
[1:02:15] Daniel was in a battle for 21 days they
[1:02:19] kept praying he didn't give up but he
[1:02:21] kept praying when the Prince of Persia
[1:02:24] was there Daniel kept pray praying when
[1:02:26] trouble was there for 21
[1:02:32] days I say it's time for you to
[1:02:34] persevere in prayer like a corner man's
[1:02:37] taught us to pray pray pray everywhere
[1:02:41] break
[1:02:46] through oh Hallelujah he's a way of
[1:02:49] Salvation there ain't no other way to
[1:02:51] Salvation he's the way to all the
[1:02:53] blessings of the Covenant of Grace he's
[1:02:55] the the way to heaven he's the way to
[1:02:57] our healing he's the way to our
[1:02:59] deliverance he opened up the way by his
[1:03:01] blood he opened it for his people he is
[1:03:06] the way well I'm tell you right now
[1:03:09] brother Andrew I'm going to win this
[1:03:10] battle on my own I highly doubt that one
[1:03:13] bit but if God is on your
[1:03:17] side I'm going tell you what I ain't
[1:03:19] never found another way outside of this
[1:03:21] message come on young people I can tell
[1:03:24] you you can look in every enti in thing
[1:03:26] cigarettes won't hold you alcohol won't
[1:03:29] hold you the things of the world won't
[1:03:30] hold you but this way this power this
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:38] anointing there is no satisfying portion
[1:03:41] down there in Le but this message is my
[1:03:45] satisfying
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:52] portion brother bandam said he said what
[1:03:55] if that little chicken on the inside of
[1:03:56] that little egg he said a little bird
[1:03:59] what if he was afraid to hit the shell
[1:04:02] what if he would have heard a sound on
[1:04:03] the outside don't hit the shell you
[1:04:06] might hurt
[1:04:07] yourself he said but the nature itself
[1:04:10] on the inside of that bird tells him
[1:04:12] knock a hole in
[1:04:14] it how many of you heard that same devil
[1:04:17] say you better not do that you better
[1:04:19] not preach that you better not believe
[1:04:22] that but the nature on the inside of a
[1:04:24] Believer says knock a a hole in
[1:04:27] it knock a hole on it he they say the
[1:04:30] days of Miracles has passed knock a hole
[1:04:33] in it they say he don't give the Holy
[1:04:35] Ghost knock a hole in it I say it unto
[1:04:38] you Peck your way out how do you do it
[1:04:41] blasting thus sayith the Lord thus
[1:04:43] sayith the Lord finally
[1:04:45] you finally you begin to smell some
[1:04:48] fresh air thus sayth the Lord you got
[1:04:50] your head on the outside thus sayith the
[1:04:53] Lord he never goes back to the cell
[1:04:58] again I ain't got nothing to go back to
[1:05:02] I destroy the bridges I burn them to the
[1:05:06] [Applause]
[1:05:11] Ground
[1:05:13] God has a
[1:05:20] way God's got to way when you can't
[1:05:24] understand it when you can't SE on your
[1:05:26] own God has got
[1:05:29] away sometimes you need some
[1:05:30] encouragement in the
[1:05:34] battle I'll be honest I as a minister I
[1:05:37] don't look at this as a real sermon I
[1:05:40] know it is but I'll be honest I just
[1:05:43] looking at it in the scope of it it
[1:05:46] probably is a sermon probably shouldn't
[1:05:47] said that probably somebody criticized
[1:05:49] me and hang me on the cross but that's
[1:05:50] all
[1:05:52] right I look at this as one of the
[1:05:56] a a great
[1:06:00] encouragement said no matter what you go
[1:06:02] through that God is
[1:06:04] there you know
[1:06:06] what one time Matthew was a football
[1:06:09] coach and did a pretty good
[1:06:11] job he was a pretty good player so he
[1:06:14] did a pretty good job but he worked
[1:06:16] alongside with a coach coach ball I
[1:06:19] believe this
[1:06:20] right coach ball was a funny funny dude
[1:06:24] well he he was he was in the college
[1:06:26] realm as a as a coach
[1:06:30] and and he he seen that his team was the
[1:06:32] underdog one night and they wasn't going
[1:06:35] to win they W going to win this
[1:06:36] whatsoever well the team had a they had
[1:06:39] a team dog that was with them everywhere
[1:06:42] they went and so here right before the
[1:06:45] game comes they getting ready you know
[1:06:47] how football football players do they
[1:06:49] they get their head into it and they
[1:06:51] they sitting there and sometimes they
[1:06:52] got to play classical music and
[1:06:54] sometimes it's hail's Bells
[1:06:57] they're trying to get their mind in it
[1:06:59] it's amazing we we played one time we
[1:07:03] played in a what was it State semi-final
[1:07:05] game and they the team that we was
[1:07:07] playing is trying to L us to sleep and
[1:07:09] they played this classical music out
[1:07:11] there on the auditorium while we was
[1:07:12] practicing and training they thinking it
[1:07:14] they thinking it was going to Mellow us
[1:07:15] out well they didn't realize that our
[1:07:17] running back had
[1:07:19] add and it had the opposite effect on
[1:07:21] them
[1:07:23] and that joker ran all night long
[1:07:28] some of the greatest scoring we ever had
[1:07:29] in Fort
[1:07:31] Defiance but anyways Coach B right
[1:07:35] before the right before the team's
[1:07:36] getting ready to go out on the
[1:07:37] field he carries in the dog and the dog
[1:07:41] is completely
[1:07:43] lifeless he walks in there said look
[1:07:46] what the other team
[1:07:47] did look what the other team did they
[1:07:50] killed our
[1:07:52] dog man I'll tell you what these guys
[1:07:54] that were underdogs and they was stirred
[1:07:56] up they went out there and beat the
[1:07:58] socks off that team because they had
[1:08:01] something to fight for they had done
[1:08:03] something personally to
[1:08:05] them when they got back in and they was
[1:08:08] rooting and hauling around in the locker
[1:08:09] room here comes a dog running back
[1:08:10] through
[1:08:13] air he give him some sleeping
[1:08:20] pills well maybe you need some
[1:08:23] motivation maybe you're in that kind of
[1:08:25] a spot where the enemy tried to come in
[1:08:28] and take everything away from you maybe
[1:08:31] you need some encouragement so let me
[1:08:33] encourage you by saying this we won't be
[1:08:36] low to sleep we will
[1:08:39] have we got the greatest Corner
[1:08:44] man God has got a away and this
[1:08:50] message is his way
[1:09:01] remember him said now God's got way he
[1:09:04] said I ain't got nothing to brag on in
[1:09:06] my first birth he said because in my
[1:09:08] first birth he said it was Gung Slingers
[1:09:10] he said it was Bootleggers it was
[1:09:11] sinners in there he said there ain't
[1:09:13] nothing in there I can brag on he said
[1:09:15] but in my second birth he said I can
[1:09:17] brag on that he's my father he's my
[1:09:20] savior He's My Redeemer I'm his son I'm
[1:09:24] not ashamed of my second
[1:09:29] birth God's got a
[1:09:31] away I just feel the drop this right
[1:09:34] here I've been holding this for a for a
[1:09:36] little bit but the Bible said in
[1:09:38] Deuteronomy 23 and2 that a bastard shall
[1:09:40] not enter into the congregation of the
[1:09:42] Lord even to the 10th Generation shall
[1:09:44] it not enter into the congregation of
[1:09:46] the Lord now now this is I got this
[1:09:49] while I was there preaching for brother
[1:09:50] Kelly hilderbrand I've seen this it's a
[1:09:53] personal letter it's a personal letter
[1:09:55] that was that was two sister Dalton that
[1:09:57] was two sister Dalton from the brand and
[1:10:00] because illegitimacy was an issue
[1:10:03] throughout all of Christianity and
[1:10:05] throughout the message that IL
[1:10:07] illegitimacy was an issue that had
[1:10:10] baffled and worried the generations of
[1:10:12] Christians and sister dton knew that she
[1:10:14] had had some bastard children and some
[1:10:16] illegitimacy in her family's history and
[1:10:19] in November of 1960 her husband had the
[1:10:22] had the opportunity to sit down with
[1:10:24] brother Rand and some brothers there in
[1:10:26] his din room and he's sitting there and
[1:10:29] they and they begin to ask him some
[1:10:31] questions about about
[1:10:35] illegitimacy and he began to ask his
[1:10:37] questions on his wife's behalf and
[1:10:39] brother Dalton presented the question of
[1:10:43] illegitimacy and here is what the letter
[1:10:46] says that November the 12th 1960 sister
[1:10:49] da is sitting here
[1:10:51] alone the brother brother dton is ritten
[1:10:54] out the sister da said sitting here
[1:10:56] alone with brother Ram Ed Jean and I
[1:10:58] heard him explain a bastard child he
[1:11:01] said if it was in the Old Testament a
[1:11:03] type of under grace brother brandom said
[1:11:05] that we're all bastard children and are
[1:11:07] brought to God by Christ we must be
[1:11:11] rebred by the truth and being born
[1:11:15] again our being being born again our
[1:11:19] being born again of Christ changes
[1:11:23] everything it changes us from
[1:11:25] illegitimate to legitimate Sons and
[1:11:28] Daughters of God in Adam we were hybrid
[1:11:30] birth but in Christ we are the true
[1:11:33] birth and brother brandham signs it and
[1:11:36] writes a note to Sister Dalton says do
[1:11:38] not fear sister Dalton your new birth or
[1:11:41] anyone's New Birth corrects it
[1:11:47] all God is in your
[1:11:51] corner the new birth corrects it all
[1:11:57] oh I got a prophet's word he said if I
[1:11:59] bought a piece of ground it isn't yours
[1:12:01] until you got an abstract but if you've
[1:12:04] got an abstract it shows that everything
[1:12:07] that was ever against that piece of CR
[1:12:09] has been struck off and then when you
[1:12:12] have become a Christian and accept
[1:12:14] Christ as your savior then when God
[1:12:16] sends down the abstract it shows that no
[1:12:19] matter what your father
[1:12:21] did what your mother did what anybody
[1:12:24] else did what your mother your Daddy
[1:12:25] might have been drunken
[1:12:28] prostitutes whatever it is every sin is
[1:12:31] stricken off you got an abstract
[1:12:36] title your new birth the Holy Ghost
[1:12:41] baptizing you corrects it
[1:12:48] all men have tried to Discount you and
[1:12:51] say you're not worthy of this message
[1:12:54] the key to winning this battle is
[1:12:57] redemption the way out is not given
[1:13:02] up you got to fight for every single
[1:13:05] inch you see God gave you the greatest
[1:13:08] weapon that he ever could have gave you
[1:13:09] when he gave you this word so I say step
[1:13:12] out and
[1:13:14] fight we got to step out and fight
[1:13:17] brother bam said he said he said every
[1:13:18] good Christian he said they got to do
[1:13:21] some training they got to start training
[1:13:23] with John 3:16 the Golden Roll he said
[1:13:26] start out with that he said that'll get
[1:13:28] you on the
[1:13:29] floor he said but then train for The
[1:13:32] Knockout punches because you're going to
[1:13:35] have to use
[1:13:36] them come on somebody we're not just a
[1:13:39] bunch of school girls we're not just a
[1:13:41] bunch of literar that know how to read
[1:13:43] our Bible we are a people that have
[1:13:47] trained for The Knockout
[1:13:53] Punch come on somebody we a we been
[1:13:55] feeding you this message here at Full
[1:13:57] Gospel Lighthouse just to make you
[1:13:58] another church we've been feeding you
[1:14:01] this message to keep the punches off of
[1:14:03] you and to train for The Knockout
[1:14:08] punches the prophet said man wants to
[1:14:11] see some heroism men are waiting for a
[1:14:14] gallon stand the world's waiting to find
[1:14:16] a man who can step
[1:14:19] out he said here not long ago he said
[1:14:22] when Divine Healing he said 10 years ago
[1:14:24] he said when I started out on the field
[1:14:26] he said they said you can't do it
[1:14:28] brother
[1:14:30] brandom I love it when you tell a man of
[1:14:32] God he can't do something you can't do
[1:14:34] it brother brandom science is against
[1:14:37] you doctors is against you modernism is
[1:14:39] against
[1:14:41] you but I said but Christ just for
[1:14:46] me well I don't care if God be for me
[1:14:51] who can be against me
[1:15:03] the corner
[1:15:05] coach he don't get a
[1:15:08] timeout he's there through every
[1:15:13] round he don't leave the fighter out
[1:15:15] there in the ring all by himself but he
[1:15:18] is constantly Dro him dropping him hands
[1:15:21] full on purpose he's there with him
[1:15:23] round after round
[1:15:25] he's there to encourage him he's there
[1:15:27] to give him
[1:15:28] strategy and when he's there after each
[1:15:32] round when the bell goes off he's there
[1:15:34] to patch up his
[1:15:35] wounds God's doing the same thing for
[1:15:37] you he doesn't abandon you when the
[1:15:40] fight gets tough he stays with you
[1:15:42] helping you recover and adjust your
[1:15:44] strategy so to make sure that you win
[1:15:47] the
[1:15:48] battle they asked brother Brandon one
[1:15:51] time said are you ever afraid that
[1:15:52] you're going to make a mistake he said
[1:15:54] absolutely Ely not he because I
[1:15:57] Hallelujah he said I know he's right
[1:15:59] there and as long as he right there he
[1:16:01] said as long as I can feel he's right
[1:16:04] there how can I make a mistake when I
[1:16:07] know he's right there how am I going to
[1:16:09] fail when I know he's right there how am
[1:16:11] I going to lose when I know he's right
[1:16:13] there because the Bible said in Psalms
[1:16:16] 46 and7 the Lord of hosts is with us the
[1:16:19] god of Jacob is our refuge Jeremiah 1:19
[1:16:23] said and they shall fight against thee
[1:16:26] but they shall not Prevail against thee
[1:16:28] for I am with thee sayith the Lord to
[1:16:30] deliver
[1:16:32] thee you got some time for the word from
[1:16:35] a corner man Psalms 56 be merciful unto
[1:16:39] me oh God for man would swallow me up he
[1:16:42] fighted daily oppressive me my enemies
[1:16:44] would daily swallow me up for there be
[1:16:47] many that fight against me oh thou most
[1:16:49] high what time I am afraid I will trust
[1:16:53] in thee in God will I praise His word in
[1:16:56] God I will put my trust I will not fear
[1:16:58] what flesh can do unto me every day the
[1:17:01] rest they rest my words all their

[1:19:20] tears when I cry unto thee then shall my
[1:19:24] enemies turn back this I know for God is
[1:19:30] for
[1:19:31] me the prophet said I don't care what
[1:19:34] size they are it's a fire it's a fight
[1:19:37] that's in the dog that's what counts he
[1:19:39] said it's the faith that's in the
[1:19:40] individual if you're a coward get back
[1:19:43] to your cuddle hole he said but brother
[1:19:45] if you're a soldier stand out there a
[1:19:47] battle on right and Wrongs engaged let's
[1:19:52] fight Psalms 1:18 and6 the Lord is on my
[1:19:56] side I will not fear what man can do
[1:19:58] unto
[1:19:59] me I got to
[1:20:02] studying it took me a little bit to get
[1:20:04] this so just dare bear with me I I'll be
[1:20:06] honest I've been studying this this
[1:20:08] little this little quotation right here
[1:20:10] for about four
[1:20:11] months I got to studying on Satan's
[1:20:20] testimony so we're going to bring up
[1:20:22] Satan's testimony
[1:20:25] Satan was cast out of
[1:20:29] Heaven Satan was cast to the
[1:20:33] ground every single time that Satan came
[1:20:38] up against Jesus Jesus cast Satan
[1:20:42] out and the final edge of his testimony
[1:20:47] is at the end of it he is cast into the
[1:20:50] Lake of
[1:20:52] Fire so his testimony is being cast
[1:20:56] down cast down cast down I don't care
[1:21:01] what he said About You cast him
[1:21:04] down I don't care what he's whispering
[1:21:06] in your ear cast him down I don't care
[1:21:09] if he's telling you you're going to
[1:21:10] remain sick cast him
[1:21:13] down Satan has a testimony of being cast
[1:21:16] down but your testimony is being brought
[1:21:21] up he didn't cast you down he didn't
[1:21:24] make fun of you the
[1:21:27] Redeemer that hung on the
[1:21:32] cross the prophet said Satan's armies
[1:21:35] bring diseases he said but God's Army
[1:21:37] cast them
[1:21:43] out hope you enjoyed my four month's
[1:21:46] testimony little study
[1:21:49] there I want you to know that if he
[1:21:52] comes against
[1:21:53] you I feel I feel the anointing of
[1:21:56] God if he comes against you cast him
[1:21:59] down that's his testimony that's his
[1:22:03] speech that's his knowledge that's
[1:22:06] Hallelujah cast him down get him out of
[1:22:10] your mind get him out of your reasonings
[1:22:12] get him out of your home cast him
[1:22:21] out I'm not doing a part two so you're
[1:22:24] going to have to deal with
[1:22:27] me but a corner man has spent some real
[1:22:30] time with his
[1:22:33] fighter he's numbered out the
[1:22:37] bag and while his fighter is hitting the
[1:22:39] bag he's not just standing there beating
[1:22:41] the air but he's got certain positions
[1:22:44] that he's
[1:22:45] hitting he's got certain numbers on the
[1:22:47] bag and he calls out sequences of
[1:22:50] numbers give him the
[1:22:52] 012 give him the 7321
[1:22:55] you see because he's he's trained him
[1:22:57] that way so that when he gets in the
[1:22:59] middle of a battle when he gets out
[1:23:01] there he can just holler out some noises
[1:23:04] he can holler out Isaiah
[1:23:07] 53 he can holler out Isaiah 54:17 no
[1:23:10] weapon that is formed against me shall
[1:23:13] prosper come on somebody give him the
[1:23:15] old Revelations 10:7 give him the old
[1:23:17] Malachi
[1:23:18] 45 come on
[1:23:21] somebody if God be for me
[1:23:25] give him the old one to give him John
[1:23:33] 3:16 give him Deuteronomy 33 and 29
[1:23:37] happy Art Thou o Israel who is like unto
[1:23:40] the old people saved by the Lord The
[1:23:43] Shield of thy help who is a sword of thy
[1:23:46] Excellency and thine enemies shall be
[1:23:48] found Liars unto thee and thou shalt
[1:23:50] tread upon their high
[1:23:53] places give him the old background for
[1:23:57] Rapture give them old psalms 27 the Lord
[1:24:00] is my light and my salvation Whom Shall
[1:24:04] I Fear the Lord is the strength of my
[1:24:07] life of whom shall I be afraid when the
[1:24:12] wicked even my enemies and my foes came
[1:24:14] up upon me to eat my flesh they
[1:24:18] stumbled and
[1:24:22] fell they failed in their
[1:24:27] purpose so the Lord put stumbling blocks
[1:24:30] in their
[1:24:31] way and their
[1:24:34] March and hindered them from executing
[1:24:38] their
[1:24:39] designs how's that for Satan's
[1:24:42] testimony though a host should encamp
[1:24:44] against me my heart shall not fear
[1:24:48] though War should rise against me in
[1:24:52] this well I be confident
[1:24:56] it's not the Flesh of man that is
[1:24:59] against
[1:25:00] you we are in a
[1:25:02] Warfare with strongholds of
[1:25:04] principalities and powers and rulers of
[1:25:07] the
[1:25:08] darkness the war should rise against me
[1:25:11] in this will I be confident one thing
[1:25:14] have I desired of the Lord that I will
[1:25:16] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:25:18] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:25:21] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:25:25] inquire in his
[1:25:28] Temple a Chinese philosopher philosopher
[1:25:31] one time he studied out all the
[1:25:34] religions of the
[1:25:38] world he studied out the Quran he
[1:25:41] studied out Buddhist teaching he studied
[1:25:44] out the religions of all the world he
[1:25:46] studied out James he studied out the
[1:25:48] siks he studied them all out he standed
[1:25:50] he studied the Hindu religion out and he
[1:25:53] made this remark
[1:25:54] that
[1:25:56] Christianity is the most stunning
[1:25:58] religion for this one
[1:26:01] scripture of Ephesians 2
[1:26:03] and22 in whom you are also build it
[1:26:06] together for in habitation of God
[1:26:09] through the
[1:26:11] spirit he said because of that one
[1:26:14] scripture he said Christianity is the
[1:26:17] greatest religion of the world that the
[1:26:20] god of Heaven wants to dwell on the
[1:26:22] inside of you
[1:26:24] by this one scripture by this one
[1:26:27] scripture he wants to live on the inside
[1:26:29] of
[1:26:30] you he ain't no good if he's out there
[1:26:33] on the outside he ain't no good if he's
[1:26:35] just God with us but it's got to be God
[1:26:38] in
[1:26:39] us come on somebody we don't want to
[1:26:42] just to fill him on our flesh we don't
[1:26:45] want to just fill him in our spirit we
[1:26:47] want him in our
[1:26:51] soul that's why Paul could say in Romans
[1:26:55] 837 nay in all these things we're more
[1:26:58] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:27:00] us you're not just a conqueror you're a
[1:27:03] super

[1:27:11] overcomer I'm a devil Destroyer I'm a
[1:27:14] serpent Bruiser I'm a devil master in

[1:27:56] the fight's
[1:27:58] over the whistles
[1:28:00] blowed and the flag gross and in the
[1:28:03] midst of every sin

[1:32:03] into this
[1:32:07] realm Buster Douglas was in the ring and
[1:32:11] Mike Tyson knocks him
[1:32:17] out and the referee's down there on the

[1:32:42] ever knocked out Mike Tyson and nobody

[1:33:04] and beats Mike Tyson and knocks him out
[1:33:06] and wins a
