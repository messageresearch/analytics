[19:36] all things are possible, Lord, and all
[19:39] power in heaven and earth is given unto

[19:47] express our love to you, Father. Lord,
[19:50] we just want to humble ourselves before
[19:52] you in your presence even now, and ask
[19:53] that you forgive us of all of our sins.
[19:56] Forgive us of every mistake, Lord, every
[19:58] wrong thought, word, or deed. Father
[20:00] Lord, we just repent even now and ask
[20:01] that the blood of Jesus so cover us,
[20:04] Father. Lord, Lord, we're taught by your
[20:06] prophet, Lord, that when you look down,
[20:08] Lord, at all of our mistakes, Lord, when
[20:10] they're put under the blood, Lord, all
[20:12] you see is white. You just see the
[20:14] righteousness, Lord. Far be it not our
[20:17] righteousness, which is as filthy rags
[20:18] before you, but Lord, the very righteous
[20:21] life of Jesus Christ, that perfect
[20:23] life, Lord, that was slain in ourstead.
[20:26] You took your you took our sin upon you,
[20:29] Father. Lord, you were sinless. You were
[20:31] spotless. And you were perfect. And
[20:33] that's what made you so acceptable,
[20:35] Lord, is that you were the perfect lamb
[20:36] of God. And Lord, we put, Lord Jesus,
[20:39] all of our faith, Lord, on that
[20:41] perfection even now. Lord, we lift up
[20:43] your name, Lord, in this service. We
[20:46] lift up every request, Lord, that was
[20:47] made, Lord, by mention, Father, and by
[20:49] raise of by an uplifted hand. Lord, you
[20:51] know every request, Lord. this natural
[20:54] life that we live, Lord, is just so full
[20:56] of testings and trials and situations of
[20:59] life that we come to. But Lord, how
[21:02] thankful we are that we don't face these
[21:03] things alone, Lord. That you carry us
[21:06] through the hard times, that you lead us
[21:07] and you guide us, Lord. We may not
[21:10] always see the end, but Lord, we just
[21:11] follow you step by step, Lord. And we
[21:13] just have faith in you. And we trust you
[21:16] that you're going to work all things out
[21:17] together for the good, Lord, to them
[21:19] that love you and to the called
[21:21] according to your purpose. We just ask
[21:23] Lord that you go every over every
[21:25] situation Lord over every detail of life
[21:28] Lord that you have your way that you
[21:30] keep us sensitive to the leadership of
[21:31] your Holy Spirit. Heal all the sick
[21:34] Lord. Save the lost. Fill those with the
[21:36] Holy Ghost that need it. Lord, as we see
[21:38] the day approaching, Lord, where you're
[21:39] going to come and take us home. And
[21:42] Lord, now for our pastor, Lord, we ask
[21:44] that you give him a special touch this
[21:46] morning. Lord, you understand and you
[21:48] know every detail of the fight that he's
[21:50] in, Lord. even the fight that it takes
[21:52] to stand here and minister your word.
[21:54] But he as a faithful servant, Lord,
[21:56] stands here weekly and delivers his
[21:59] heart, Father, Lord, and preaches your
[22:00] word to us. We ask, oh God, that you
[22:03] bless him in a special way. Now
[22:04] strengthen them. May the en may the
[22:06] kingdom of Satan, Father, be beaten back
[22:08] and defeated this morning because your
[22:11] word can defeat Satan any place, any
[22:13] time, anywhere, under any circumstances.
[22:16] And as your word goes forth, Lord, may
[22:18] we apply it to our lives and defeat the
[22:21] enemy. Lord, you've given us everything
[22:22] we have need of, and we thank you for

[37:00] [Music]
[37:14] Hallelujah. What a powerful promise our
[37:17] Lord Jesus Christ has given to us. Amen.
[37:20] It's always been one of my favorite
[37:21] scriptures that I'll never leave thee
[37:24] nor forsake thee. To think that you're
[37:26] not walking alone in this battle. It
[37:28] gives you a assurance to know that you
[37:30] can go the rest of the way. Amen. Aren't
[37:33] you thankful to be in the house of the
[37:34] Lord this morning? Would you stand with

[37:43] special day here today. We have a

[37:47] the word today and we want to just
[37:49] welcome all of our special guests here
[37:51] today. Amen. Key of F, Sister Cassie.
[37:55] Amen. Just have this song with my heart.
[37:57] I don't have enough voice to sing it,
[37:59] but I I know I got some good singers in
[38:00] the house that maybe just help us today.
[38:03] Oh,
[38:04] ladies and
[38:06] gentlemen, may I have your
[38:11] attention? Well, I would like to
[38:15] introduce to you.
[38:20] Oh, in this
[38:24] corner of the
[38:26] good and the
[38:29] right stands a champion
[38:33] road in
[38:35] [Music]
[38:36] wide. Oh, his high exceeds the
[38:41] heavens. His
[38:44] weight is the world. His reach reaches
[38:50] everywhere. His
[38:54] age is ever
[38:57] more.
[38:59] He's higher than the
[39:03] heights. He's gater than the
[39:07] grave. No one could ever take his crown
[39:13] away.
[39:16] He is more mighty than the
[39:20] mightiest and he reigns from
[39:26] above. He's the
[39:29] alltime
[39:32] undisputed
[39:33] undefeated
[39:35] champion of love.
[39:40] Oh, he left this
[39:43] hometown. Oh, to enter this story, God.
[39:49] Oh, to raise his hands in
[39:52] victory for you and
[39:56] me. Oh, an angry crowd cried, "Crucify!"
[40:02] This
[40:03] king who wore the
[40:06] crown as they gladly watched a champion
[40:11] go
[40:13] down. Oh, but I will never for count him
[40:18] out. For I'm a witness of the
[40:24] day he rose to reclaim the
[40:30] church beyond
[40:33] love and
[40:35] he's higher than the highest. He's gater
[40:41] than the grace. No one could ever take
[40:47] his ground
[40:50] away. He is more mighty than the
[40:55] mightiest and he reigns from above.
[41:04] He's the
[41:06] alltime
[41:08] undisputed
[41:10] undefeated
[41:11] champion of
[41:14] love. Lord, I want to love you

[44:47] so, thank you. Thank you for all of
[44:49] that. And Amen. I have a special friend
[44:52] here. I want to greet her in just a few
[44:54] minutes. And uh we're just so glad to

[45:03] why don't you just be seated just a
[45:11] moment. I mean this from the bottom of
[45:14] my heart. One of my greatest heroes is
[45:18] here today.
[45:22] and we have been connected for a long
[45:27] time. And I said I would dance at her
[45:31] wedding when she was a very crippled
[45:34] girl and was crawling on the
[45:37] floor. And now that now that little girl
[45:41] has grown up and Alexander, you better

[47:17] condition as a child. And they would

[47:40] and uh and so if you've never seen a
[47:43] miracle

[48:04] to get her driver's license. I was never
[48:06] so happy in my life. I danced. I was in
[48:09] my office when she called me and I
[48:11] danced all over the place. Told the
[48:14] devil, "That's in your eye, devil."
[48:16] Yeah. That was a miracle. Yeah. For

[50:35] you with all of our hearts. And so good
[50:37] to see each and every one of you today.
[50:42] Well, I spoke the first part of this
[50:44] last week at at
[50:46] camp,
[50:48] but I I want to speak to you this
[50:51] morning on another part of the man in
[50:53] the
[50:54] arena. Amen. I I'll just I'll just read
[50:58] this for you real quickly while I'm
[51:00] while I'm here and I'm trying to fight
[51:02] tears.
[51:05] Teddy Roosevelt for many of you know
[51:07] that I he was a hero of mine in in
[51:09] history. Not like Ella. Ella's really a
[51:13] hero of mine.
[51:16] But Teddy Roosevelt was a kind of man
[51:18] that was born with a defect and his was
[51:21] he couldn't see very far. And so he
[51:25] couldn't play ball like everybody else
[51:27] could play and cuz he couldn't catch.
[51:30] And
[51:31] so so he went into boxing. His father,
[51:35] they were a very rich family and his
[51:37] father wanted him to to go into boxing.
[51:40] And so it was actually told to him by
[51:43] some of the people around him that he
[51:45] would never be anything in life. Well,
[51:47] that's the best way to have something.
[51:49] You'll never be nothing in
[51:51] life. Come on. Well, Tim Puit's a good
[51:57] example. When they told him he'd never
[52:00] be nothing in life, he shook the world.
[52:07] and and Teddy was told that he would he
[52:10] would never be nothing in life because
[52:12] he couldn't see
[52:13] well. And so he could see about 20 feet
[52:18] and so he so they would he would wear
[52:20] glasses but he would box and he became
[52:23] became quite a boxer. our prophet became
[52:26] quite a boxer.
[52:28] And and so he he would be get into the
[52:31] political arena. And then in the
[52:33] political arena, he would begin to make
[52:36] speeches. And one of the speeches that
[52:38] that that became so popular was the man
[52:42] in the arena
[52:44] speech. And this is a portion of that.
[52:47] And and just to give you a little
[52:48] background, he was given this speech in
[52:50] one particular place.
[52:53] And uh you can correct me if I'm wrong
[52:55] on this. Believe it was in Chicago and a
[52:59] man shot him point blank. Literally
[53:02] wanted to assassinate him. And so, you
[53:06] know, if you ever want to do something
[53:07] good, somebody's out there to try to
[53:09] destroy you. And so this man shot him
[53:12] point blank. Well, because of his
[53:16] because of his glasses, they had a real
[53:18] heavy metal uh glass case in his pocket,
[53:22] in his suit coat. And uh he also wore
[53:25] three-piece suits. And so he had a heavy
[53:28] metal and he had had a had a had speech
[53:32] inside of that as well in his pocket.
[53:34] And the man shot him and shot him right
[53:37] through that glass case. Went through
[53:39] his speech and then lodged in his chest.
[53:42] and blood began to run down through his
[53:45] down his legs and and he said, "Well,
[53:48] I've been shot." And so everybody wanted
[53:51] to take him to into the hospital and get
[53:53] him care real quick. And he said, "No, I
[53:55] came to give a
[53:56] speech. I want to give my speech before
[53:59] I go to the
[54:00] hospital." Shot in the
[54:03] chest. That's courage.
[54:06] I think that's I think America needs
[54:08] more men like that.
[54:10] men of courage.
[54:13] And he says, "It is not the critic who
[54:16] counts. It is not the man who points out
[54:19] how the strong man stumbles or where the
[54:23] doer of deeds could could have done
[54:26] better." The critic, the
[54:29] credit belongs to the man who is
[54:32] actually in the arena. I think that's a
[54:34] phenomenal
[54:36] statement. whose face is marred by dust
[54:39] and sweat and blood. Who strives
[54:43] valiantly, who
[54:45] hes, who often, who comes up short again
[54:49] and again because there is no effort
[54:54] without error or short
[54:57] shortcoming. But who does actually
[54:59] strive to do the deeds? Who knows great
[55:04] enthusiasms, the great devotions, who
[55:07] spends himself in a worthy
[55:09] cause. Who at best knows in the end the
[55:15] triumph of high
[55:17] achievement? Or who at the worst? If he
[55:21] fails, at least he fails while daring
[55:24] greatly. So that his place shall never
[55:28] be with those cold and timid souls who
[55:33] never know victory or
[55:40] defeat. For those that have watched the
[55:43] service last week, that had been on my
[55:46] heart for literally weeks to speak at
[55:51] brother Tim
[55:53] Puitz. So, we walk into the morning skit
[55:57] and what do you know? They have a
[55:59] ring and the name of the play was Man in
[56:02] the
[56:03] Arena. And so, we go to eat and we go
[56:07] eat crawfish. I'm sorry I'm taking too
[56:09] much time, but you can fire me if you
[56:12] want to. And so, we we go to eat and we
[56:16] go eat crawfish, which is about an hour
[56:17] away. And so, five of us ministers was
[56:20] in the car. Brother Matt, Brother Matt
[56:23] McGary, and then Brother Matt Watkins
[56:25] was in the car with Brother Kelly
[56:27] Hildebrandt and myself and Brother Tim.
[56:29] And brother Matt Watkins was sitting in
[56:31] the back and he says, "Hey, Brother Tim,
[56:34] this morning I woke up with this on my
[56:36] heart." And he said, "I sent it to all
[56:38] my family." And he said, "I I sent it to
[56:40] the church." And he said, he said, "I I
[56:44] want to encourage you with this speech
[56:46] this morning." and he began to read the
[56:48] man in the arena. What I just read to
[56:51] you, I just raised my hands. I knew
[56:54] that's what I was preaching last Sunday
[56:57] and what I was preaching this morning.
[56:59] So,
[57:01] whether you know it or not, we are the
[57:04] man in the arena.
[57:07] We are the man in the arena.
[57:10] Every one of us, not just myself, but
[57:13] every one of us have stepped out from
[57:16] our comfort zones.
[57:20] That's right. Listen, this world is not
[57:23] our home and we're not comfortable here.
[57:26] But we will overcome.
[57:29] Amen. God bless you this morning. If you
[57:31] could stand with me, Brother Kenny, God
[57:33] bless you. So glad to have you. So
[57:36] enjoyed that song last night. Amen.
[57:38] Amen. For those that don't know, brother
[57:40] Kenny Caps, you hear his father was a
[57:45] was in brother Brandham's meetings and
[57:47] one of brother Brandham's was associate
[57:50] pastor or was he an associate pastor
[57:52] there.
[57:56] Yeah. And then he had his own church
[57:58] there. So, Amen. That's his father. He
[58:02] comes from a great great legacy as well.
[58:04] So glad to have you guys with us. And
[58:07] Amen. in the house of the Lord.
[58:10] Amen. Psalms 91 and verse
[58:15] one.
[58:26] Amen. I read the first verse and you
[58:29] read the second. We'll go through it.
[58:30] Psalms 91 verse one.
[58:34] He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[58:36] the most high shall abide under the
[58:38] shadow of the almighty.
[58:47] God.
[58:49] Surely he shall deliver thee from the
[58:51] snare of the fowler and from the noise
[58:54] and pestilence.
[59:02] shall be shield.
[59:05] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[59:08] by night, nor the arrow that fl by day.
[59:19] A thousand shall fall at thy side, and
[59:21] 10,000 at thy right hand, but it shall
[59:24] not come nigh thee.
[59:32] Because thou hast made the Lord, which
[59:35] is my refuge, even the most high, thy
[59:39] habitation.
[59:47] For he shall give his angels charge over
[59:49] thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
[59:59] Thou thou shalt tread upon the lion and
[1:00:02] the add the young lion and the dragon
[1:00:05] shall thou trample trample under thy
[1:00:08] feet.
[1:00:19] He shall call upon me and I will answer
[1:00:22] him. I will be with him in trouble. I
[1:00:26] will deliver him and honor him.
[1:00:35] Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we
[1:00:39] love you today with all of our
[1:00:41] hearts. It is so good to be in the house
[1:00:44] of the Lord and to be with such special
[1:00:46] friends that are here.
[1:00:48] Lord, I ask you that you would anoint
[1:00:50] this this message
[1:00:52] today. Lord, you know our hearts. You
[1:00:55] know exactly what we need. Now, Father,
[1:00:58] I pray that you would just come and give
[1:01:00] me the strength that I need to stand
[1:01:03] here and speak the gospel of Jesus
[1:01:05] Christ. Lord, we do this to help your
[1:01:08] children. Lord, I just pray that you
[1:01:11] would just minister to us in a in a
[1:01:13] special way. Father, while the word is
[1:01:16] going forth, I believe that you can fill
[1:01:19] us with the Holy Ghost. Lord, I believe
[1:01:22] that you can heal our diseases, that you
[1:01:25] can touch our hearts, minister to us in
[1:01:28] a special way. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:01:31] name. Amen. And amen and amen. You can
[1:01:34] be seated.
[1:01:42] We realize that we have all have an
[1:01:45] enemy. And when God built our
[1:01:48] enemy, you can imagine God built an
[1:01:51] enemy to to show the show the other side
[1:01:56] of him to bring out of him, bring out of
[1:01:59] him love, bring out of him being a
[1:02:02] savior.
[1:02:04] It was all it was a law of opposites if
[1:02:07] we could say it like that. Light,
[1:02:10] darkness, love, hate. You get the point.
[1:02:15] So, we realize that God didn't build us
[1:02:17] a enemy.
[1:02:21] He didn't build us a paper tiger to have
[1:02:24] to fight with.
[1:02:26] He built us an enemy that would always
[1:02:29] think he would win.
[1:02:32] Amen. He reads the same book that we
[1:02:35] read. The book says he's going to be
[1:02:38] destroyed and thrown into outer
[1:02:40] darkness. He will have an end. The book
[1:02:44] says that we don't have an end.
[1:02:48] The book says that we're the overcomers
[1:02:51] of the age. That's what it says. I like
[1:02:55] reading about myself. The book says that
[1:02:58] we shall overcome.
[1:03:01] Amen. Yeah. The Bible says that he
[1:03:04] places thousands of angels with us.
[1:03:11] And it's not just today on Sunday, but
[1:03:13] it's with us every day.
[1:03:16] Now, I want you to understand
[1:03:19] this. God allows you to go through
[1:03:23] trials and tests. Every son that comes
[1:03:27] to God has first got to be tried, has
[1:03:30] first got to be chassened. Because this
[1:03:34] mortal life that we're going through is
[1:03:37] the only time that you're going to
[1:03:39] develop character. That's right.
[1:03:43] Character is the only thing that you're
[1:03:45] going to take with you.
[1:03:49] Character is a victory.
[1:03:53] Now, remember this. We got to always
[1:03:55] keep this in this in our minds. God
[1:03:59] pre-planned us.
[1:04:02] He watched over even our chemicals that
[1:04:05] were in the earth. He pre-planned your
[1:04:09] birth. He pre-planned what you would be
[1:04:12] like. Even even in fighting the
[1:04:15] complexes that you would have, he knew
[1:04:17] all of that. And in his pre-planning,
[1:04:21] let me just say, he doesn't plan to
[1:04:23] lose.
[1:04:26] Remember our enemy was the right hand of
[1:04:29] heaven. War took place in heaven and
[1:04:32] Satan was cast into the earth.
[1:04:37] This is the place that he reigns. God
[1:04:40] put a perfect Eden right in the middle
[1:04:44] of what Satan was trying to reign.
[1:04:47] And he put a son of God on the earth as
[1:04:50] an amateur god over top of it all.
[1:04:55] Are you with me? Sure, Adam fell.
[1:04:59] Sure, Adam
[1:05:01] fell. And but God had a plan.
[1:05:06] God just didn't say, "Oh my, what a I'm
[1:05:08] going to have to remake the whole
[1:05:10] thing." God had a plan.
[1:05:13] understand in the deepest, darkest
[1:05:15] valleys that you're going through, God
[1:05:18] has a plan.
[1:05:23] I said this last
[1:05:25] week, the word of God is superior to all
[1:05:30] of your feelings.
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:35] Are you with me?
[1:05:37] feel scared, feel
[1:05:40] terrified, feel horrified by the
[1:05:42] situations that you're in. God's word is
[1:05:46] greater than every one of those
[1:05:47] feelings.
[1:05:49] Every one of us feel fear.
[1:05:54] Every one of us feel anxiety. Every one
[1:05:57] of us come against things that we're
[1:06:00] we're not wanting to have to go through.
[1:06:03] I got surgery in a couple of weeks. I'm
[1:06:05] not looking forward to it at all. Much
[1:06:07] angst that's about it. But God said he'd
[1:06:10] be with me.
[1:06:12] I want you to understand what Satan's
[1:06:14] fighting you for. There's a reason he's
[1:06:16] fighting you. He's got the drunk. He's
[1:06:19] got the prostitute. He's got false
[1:06:22] preachers.
[1:06:24] He's got the religious.
[1:06:27] But he's fighting you for your position.
[1:06:31] Not for the place that you're sitting in
[1:06:34] your church, but where your position is
[1:06:37] in Christ.
[1:06:40] He lost his. So, he's fighting you for
[1:06:44] yours.
[1:06:46] Now, Brother Ron, but I'm a nobody.
[1:06:48] Really?
[1:06:50] A Christian has more power and more
[1:06:54] authority than an angel that is in
[1:06:56] heaven.
[1:07:00] Are you with me? I'm just dropping you
[1:07:02] oneliners here just for a few moments to
[1:07:04] get you on base. I want you to
[1:07:05] understand Satan knows that if you use
[1:07:09] your authority on him,
[1:07:14] he's in trouble. Yeah.
[1:07:17] As long as you battle Satan with your
[1:07:20] feelings, with your mind, with your
[1:07:24] tongue, with your natural negative
[1:07:26] spirit, you'll never whip him.
[1:07:30] This is not a hope. So,
[1:07:35] this is not a, you know, try to get your
[1:07:37] mind fixed in a certain way, you know,
[1:07:39] to have positive feelings. You got to
[1:07:42] take the word of God. Amen.
[1:07:46] In your position and know who you are.
[1:07:52] Now, this is the important part. It's
[1:07:54] important to know who your pastor is.
[1:07:57] It's important to know who your who the
[1:07:59] prophet was of this age.
[1:08:04] But you got to know who you are.
[1:08:07] Now, first of all, you were in the
[1:08:09] military. They just didn't sign you up
[1:08:12] just to look good. You had a job to do.
[1:08:16] God just didn't pick you to come here
[1:08:19] and be some flimfl.
[1:08:25] God's going to have overcomers.
[1:08:31] Are you with me now? Now he has given
[1:08:34] you the best weapon that he could give
[1:08:37] you is the word of God.
[1:08:42] The scripture says that heavens and
[1:08:44] earth will pass away, but my word will
[1:08:50] never pass away.
[1:08:53] That's right, brother Ron. I'd like for
[1:08:56] my day to start getting better. Start
[1:08:58] quoting the scripture.
[1:09:02] Start singing a song.
[1:09:06] I don't care how bad you feel. Just
[1:09:08] start quoting the scriptures one right
[1:09:10] after another. Listen, read your Bible
[1:09:13] and pray.
[1:09:15] Don't forget to pray.
[1:09:21] Are you with me now? The battleground is
[1:09:24] in your mind. God chose that. Listen,
[1:09:26] that's the way it is. That's the way it
[1:09:29] is. That's set in order. You're going to
[1:09:31] have to fight with the negative spirits.
[1:09:34] You're gonna have to fight with things
[1:09:36] that come in your mind.
[1:09:39] Jealousies.
[1:09:42] You're gonna have to fight with those
[1:09:43] things. That's that's in the natural
[1:09:45] nature. You're going to have to fight
[1:09:47] with negative thoughts that come there.
[1:09:50] But you fight with the word of God.
[1:09:55] And God will give you victory over
[1:09:57] death, sickness, and unbelief.
[1:10:01] Brother Bram said, "Separate yourself
[1:10:03] from
[1:10:04] kindreds, from your peoples. Separate
[1:10:07] from your your associates. Separate from
[1:10:10] your habits. Separate from everything
[1:10:14] and come out and stand alone before God.
[1:10:18] That's not in a
[1:10:20] partnership. There's only one who will
[1:10:23] walk with you, and that's him who made
[1:10:26] the statement."
[1:10:29] You said it. The Lord Jesus, he's the
[1:10:32] one that'll trobe the valley with you.
[1:10:39] He'll go through every brier patch and
[1:10:42] climb every mountain.
[1:10:51] If you become a
[1:10:53] Christian, every redemptive blessing of
[1:10:57] God belongs to you.
[1:11:04] I want you to I want you to catch this.
[1:11:08] It's yours.
[1:11:11] everyone. The scripture says, "I wish
[1:11:14] above all things that you would prosper
[1:11:20] and be in health."
[1:11:24] Are you with me, Brother Ron? But I just
[1:11:27] struggle alone. Trust God with
[1:11:29] everything in your life.
[1:11:34] You've got to have to. You have a right
[1:11:36] to claim it. Watch what he says.
[1:11:40] If you let Satan push you over in a
[1:11:44] corner, watch what he says. That's up to
[1:11:47] you. Amen.
[1:11:50] But
[1:11:51] brother, stand toe to
[1:11:53] toe with the scripture and say, "It is
[1:11:56] written."
[1:11:58] That's right. That's the way the Lord
[1:12:00] did it. And any man, I don't care, you
[1:12:03] might be a weak Christian.
[1:12:07] You don't need people coming through
[1:12:09] with gifts of healing. You don't need
[1:12:11] these other things. The only thing that
[1:12:13] you need to do is take God at his word
[1:12:18] and stand toeto toe.
[1:12:23] Stand toeto toe with Satan and you'll
[1:12:26] defeat him on that ground.
[1:12:31] He said, "Did you ever think of it that
[1:12:34] most men who ever do anything great for
[1:12:38] the kingdom of God stand
[1:12:41] alone?" Did you ever think of it? You
[1:12:45] have to stand by
[1:12:47] yourself. Jesus stood alone.
[1:12:50] And all down through the ages, other men
[1:12:53] stood alone. He's going to name some
[1:12:55] off. Finey, Sanki, Knox, Calvin, Abraham
[1:13:00] Lincoln. Let me just say, sometimes we
[1:13:03] just forget it, but Abraham Lincoln was
[1:13:06] an outsider.
[1:13:09] Elected as the president of the United
[1:13:12] States of America. He had new defeats.
[1:13:17] He had lost 11 different
[1:13:21] elections before he ran for the
[1:13:24] president of the United States of
[1:13:27] America and he won.
[1:13:33] And I want you to understand then he won
[1:13:37] and then every target was against him.
[1:13:41] Do you realize that? Even brother Doug,
[1:13:44] I just I just feel you pulling right
[1:13:46] here. But even he didn't take the train
[1:13:51] that would take him to Washington
[1:13:52] straight away cuz he knew they would try
[1:13:55] to assassinate him. And so he took
[1:13:58] another train that took him through New
[1:14:01] York and brought him down because there
[1:14:03] was 11 different assassination attempts
[1:14:07] on
[1:14:08] him before he ever got to Washington.
[1:14:12] Amen.
[1:14:14] Think about that. They were trying to
[1:14:17] destroy him. Listen, we recognize him as
[1:14:20] one of the greatest presidents that ever
[1:14:22] lived.
[1:14:24] But they hated him.
[1:14:28] Listen, you're the queen of heaven.
[1:14:33] You're the queen of heaven. You're on
[1:14:35] your way to the throne.
[1:14:38] Not just from Chicago to Washington, but
[1:14:41] you're on your way to the throne
[1:14:44] and you've got way more than 11
[1:14:47] different attempts on your life. Satan
[1:14:49] would destroy you every day.
[1:14:56] If he could,
[1:15:00] I've read this before.
[1:15:03] We shall fight on the
[1:15:07] beaches. We shall fight on the landing
[1:15:11] grounds. We shall fight in the
[1:15:13] fields, in the
[1:15:15] streets. We shall fight on the
[1:15:18] hills. We shall never surrender.
[1:15:24] We will never surrender. We will fight
[1:15:26] for our families.
[1:15:29] You have it. Strong family is not an
[1:15:32] accident. You got to fight for it.
[1:15:36] We will fight for our children.
[1:15:40] I had three. I didn't want to give one
[1:15:42] up.
[1:15:44] Not to the devil.
[1:15:49] Are you with me now? That's right.
[1:15:53] I'd rather have my children here serving
[1:15:55] God than to be an actor.
[1:15:59] or to be some great star in the sports
[1:16:03] world or to be in the political arena.
[1:16:09] When you look over at your children
[1:16:11] sitting here worshiping the Lord with
[1:16:13] you, that's a victory.
[1:16:16] I want to say it. That's worth fighting
[1:16:19] for.
[1:16:27] We will fight for
[1:16:29] deliverance. We will fight for joy. We
[1:16:32] will fight for peace. We will fight for
[1:16:36] the Holy Ghost. We will fight until our
[1:16:39] bodies are changed.
[1:16:44] And we're sitting at the marriage supper
[1:16:46] of the lamb.
[1:16:48] I can't wait. Can you? Amen.
[1:16:55] Psalms chapter 27 and verse
[1:16:58] one. If we could put that
[1:17:01] up. The Lord is my light and my
[1:17:06] salvation. Whom shall I
[1:17:10] fear? The Lord is the strength of my
[1:17:12] life of whom shall I be afraid? Yes, I'm
[1:17:16] placing emphasis on it. You need to look
[1:17:18] at the devil and say, I don't have to
[1:17:19] fear you.
[1:17:23] When the wicked, even mine enemies and
[1:17:24] my foes came up onto me to eat my flesh,
[1:17:27] they stumbled and
[1:17:28] fell. Though a host should encamp
[1:17:32] against me, my heart shall not
[1:17:34] fear. Though war should rise against me,
[1:17:38] in this will I be confident.
[1:17:41] One thing that I have desired of the
[1:17:42] Lord, that will I seek after, that I may
[1:17:45] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:17:47] days of my life, to behold the beauty of
[1:17:50] the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.
[1:17:53] Let's read this next verse together. For
[1:17:55] in the time of trouble, he shall hide me
[1:17:58] in his pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:18:01] tabernacle shall he hide me, and he
[1:18:03] shall set me upon a rock.
[1:18:06] Brother Ram said, "Give me a
[1:18:09] preacher. Give me a Christian. Give me a
[1:18:13] housewife that's a Christian. Give me a
[1:18:16] farmer or a factory worker that'll put
[1:18:19] God first in everything."
[1:18:25] Are you with me? God don't want second
[1:18:27] place, third place, fourth place.
[1:18:33] That's right. God don't want you to
[1:18:35] serve him as a matter of convenience. He
[1:18:38] wants first place.
[1:18:42] We have committed our life to God. We
[1:18:45] have dedicated our life to God. Our
[1:18:48] overcoming is not an accident.
[1:18:55] Young people sitting here, I don't know
[1:18:57] the battles that you're going through,
[1:18:59] but it's worth it.
[1:19:02] I want to say it. It is worth it.
[1:19:07] Lord, I think about even this
[1:19:11] week I I I look at things and I'll just
[1:19:14] drop this in. I don't think it's no
[1:19:16] small accident that the Pope
[1:19:19] dies on Easter Sunday.
[1:19:23] I don't think it's no small
[1:19:25] accident that now our president has an
[1:19:31] audience with
[1:19:33] Zillinski in the
[1:19:35] Vatican and they're sitting there. It's
[1:19:38] a picture that's going around the world.
[1:19:40] A picture of our president and
[1:19:44] Zealinski setting in the
[1:19:47] Vatican talking about a
[1:19:51] war. You know, sometimes we're thinking
[1:19:53] the scriptur is going to be this or that
[1:19:56] or this or prophecy or that prophecy.
[1:19:59] you know what our nation
[1:20:01] represents and what we are and how that
[1:20:05] she is the the power force of what she
[1:20:09] will be and who Rome is
[1:20:13] and who Rome is
[1:20:16] and here in the same week as all of that
[1:20:19] Putin says he's ready for a the last war
[1:20:24] ready for the third world war and ready
[1:20:27] to attack the Western nations.
[1:20:32] That doesn't shake us.
[1:20:36] I want to say this to you. That doesn't
[1:20:38] shake us whatsoever.
[1:20:40] I don't care how quick his bombs are.
[1:20:47] I don't care how destructive his bombs
[1:20:49] are. The vision was America was blowed
[1:20:53] to craters.
[1:20:55] The difference is we're not going to be
[1:20:57] here.
[1:21:07] Are you with me? We're not going to be
[1:21:10] here.
[1:21:11] That's what the word said about us.
[1:21:17] Now, a
[1:21:19] contest is a test of strength.
[1:21:23] So you have an
[1:21:25] enemy that is designed to test your
[1:21:31] faith. Brother Shannon the prophet said
[1:21:34] that God drops a seed down inside of you
[1:21:38] about the size of a
[1:21:42] button. It ignites and comes to life.
[1:21:45] But that's not the end of the paragraph.
[1:21:48] And then Satan comes along and makes you
[1:21:52] prove it.
[1:21:58] Under understand the enemy is bringing
[1:22:02] out of
[1:22:04] you bringing out of you what you are.
[1:22:11] Are you with me? The enemy is so stupid.
[1:22:16] He's developing your character.
[1:22:20] Praise God.
[1:22:22] Now remember
[1:22:26] this. It's like in a
[1:22:29] boxing, you know, when they start a
[1:22:31] young man that's got incredible
[1:22:35] potential, they don't start him against
[1:22:37] Muhammad Ali.
[1:22:43] They start him against a thug.
[1:22:46] that can make his way around the ring
[1:22:48] and swing his arms, maybe has been a
[1:22:51] career
[1:22:53] fighter, you know, but he's he's not a
[1:22:55] winner. The reason they're doing that is
[1:22:58] so he can develop his skills
[1:23:03] and he
[1:23:04] trains. And you got to train for a
[1:23:07] contest. And you got to learn to spar.
[1:23:11] You got to learn to keep the punches off
[1:23:13] of you. Amen. Now, it's one thing you
[1:23:17] got to know how to give a punch,
[1:23:20] but you got to know how to take a punch.
[1:23:25] You got to know how to get back up.
[1:23:30] Brother Ron, but you're way out of
[1:23:32] place. Listen, you hear brother Brandham
[1:23:34] as a boxer. Listen, God was developing
[1:23:37] brother Brandham at a young age to fight
[1:23:42] not only in the natural realm. One day
[1:23:44] he's going to have to stand and preach
[1:23:46] the seals
[1:23:49] and fight in another realm. And he's got
[1:23:52] to know, brother Kenny, he can't be
[1:23:55] scared.
[1:23:59] Brother Bram said, they asked him, "Are
[1:24:01] are you scared?" And I'm paraphrasing,
[1:24:02] right? Are you
[1:24:03] afraid? He said, "No, the angel's with
[1:24:07] me."
[1:24:09] He said he would go with me. He'll be
[1:24:11] there in Finland.
[1:24:15] Are you with me now?
[1:24:19] He said he was training with a man that
[1:24:21] was named 62 Smith. That's right.
[1:24:25] He was about 30 to 40 pounds heavier,
[1:24:29] brother Brandham said, than him and he
[1:24:30] was trained against other
[1:24:33] guys. Now, Brother Brandham in his in
[1:24:36] his professional fights was 19 and0.
[1:24:41] He was undefeated.
[1:24:43] But in his
[1:24:45] sparring, Six Second Smith would hit him
[1:24:47] so hard he'd knock him out of the ring.
[1:24:53] And he would say, "You're going to kill
[1:24:54] me."
[1:24:56] He would hit him so hard till the blood
[1:24:58] would stop. He felt like he would hit
[1:25:01] him so hard and he would plead with him,
[1:25:03] "Don't hit me so hard." And Six Second
[1:25:06] Smith told him something that that was
[1:25:09] powerful. It'll do you good. Amen.
[1:25:14] It'll do you good.
[1:25:17] Listen, your trials that you have to go
[1:25:20] through.
[1:25:23] God don't send you against the toughest
[1:25:25] thing as a young Christian.
[1:25:30] Listen, first of all,
[1:25:33] Abraham had to learn the voice of God.
[1:25:38] And that's what you've got to learn. the
[1:25:40] voice of God over top of your
[1:25:41] impressions, over top of your feelings,
[1:25:44] over top of your opinions.
[1:25:50] You've got to appreciate coming into
[1:25:51] service and you yourself getting into it
[1:25:54] if nobody else is.
[1:25:58] Listen, cuz you're going to need it.
[1:26:03] You're going to need it. I'm not going
[1:26:05] to come home and fight your battles for
[1:26:07] you. You're going to have to fight it.
[1:26:14] Now,
[1:26:15] maybe maybe you don't have a battle, but
[1:26:17] there's some people have a battle just
[1:26:19] coming to church. I don't know if I even
[1:26:22] want to go or not because they've never
[1:26:25] learned the value of how powerful a
[1:26:28] service is.
[1:26:33] And I want you to
[1:26:35] understand, no two services are alike.
[1:26:41] No two sermons are alike.
[1:26:45] If you pull,
[1:26:49] listen, there's a major difference
[1:26:51] between pulling and being entertained.
[1:26:58] There's a major difference.
[1:26:59] Entertainment is I put a quarter in the
[1:27:02] offer and bless God, I want my blessing
[1:27:04] today.
[1:27:07] Listen, entertainment is is going to a
[1:27:10] Kenny Rogers conver
[1:27:13] convention concert. Couldn't find a
[1:27:15] word. You go there now, he's dead.
[1:27:27] You go, you find your seat. It's B11.
[1:27:30] You sit down in your
[1:27:32] seat. You're not worried if the sound is
[1:27:35] off.
[1:27:39] You sit down in your seat, you cross
[1:27:41] your
[1:27:42] arms, and he starts singing love songs.
[1:27:49] But you think you paid $35 for the
[1:27:52] ticket. You walk
[1:27:54] out. It was nothing nice. It don't do
[1:27:57] nothing really for you.
[1:28:00] Well, I don't like Kenny Rogers. Okay.
[1:28:03] You're a Washington Commander fan.
[1:28:09] Forgive me, internet. You're a
[1:28:11] Washington Commander fan. You drive
[1:28:13] three hours. You have trouble finding a
[1:28:16] parking place.
[1:28:19] Most likely you'll pay $25 for your
[1:28:21] parking place. Not that I know, but I
[1:28:27] know you will be
[1:28:29] scammed at least one
[1:28:32] time before you walk
[1:28:35] in cuz not everybody's angels at a ball
[1:28:38] game.
[1:28:40] Then you walk in, you find your place,
[1:28:42] you sit down, and you got the worst seat
[1:28:45] in the house.
[1:28:48] A poll is right in front of
[1:28:54] you and you lose. Good part. You
[1:29:00] lose
[1:29:03] 33-10, but you're still a fan. Yeah. You
[1:29:06] got your shirt on. You got your hat on.
[1:29:10] You got your flag in your hand.
[1:29:15] But you're standing with 88,000 other
[1:29:17] people.
[1:29:21] It didn't do you a whole lot of good.
[1:29:23] You just enjoyed the day. But when you
[1:29:26] come to
[1:29:30] church, the devil don't bother you going
[1:29:32] to those things.
[1:29:35] He don't get on your back.
[1:29:38] But put your tithes in the offering
[1:29:40] plate and the devil will get in your
[1:29:41] ear.
[1:29:43] What are they going to do with your
[1:29:44] money? What was they doing with your
[1:29:47] money?
[1:29:55] Somebody sit in your
[1:29:58] chair. It's too hot in
[1:30:02] here. How's Matthew's shoulder? He don't
[1:30:05] have that sling on. I'm worried about
[1:30:06] Matthew.
[1:30:11] Where's all these people coming
[1:30:15] from? I was happy when it was 80 of
[1:30:19] us. Change is coming,
[1:30:32] baby. Brother Brandham said, "I went
[1:30:35] into a football stadium." Had to preface
[1:30:37] all that. I went into a football stadium
[1:30:40] one day and I seen a a little sight
[1:30:42] tight thing hanging there on the wall
[1:30:44] and said that really struck me. It's not
[1:30:47] the size of the dog that's in the
[1:30:51] fight. It's the size of the fight that's
[1:30:54] in the dog.
[1:30:57] He said it's a battle. You've got to
[1:31:00] know your enemy and you've got to know
[1:31:02] your armor. And your armor is the word
[1:31:05] of God. And your enemy is something that
[1:31:09] that that'll try to reason against it.
[1:31:13] Listen to him as he
[1:31:15] prays.
[1:31:17] Satan, you can't hold
[1:31:20] them no more. They're God's children
[1:31:24] right
[1:31:26] now. And I'm bringing that before you.
[1:31:34] You have to take your hand off of their
[1:31:37] life. They belong to God
[1:31:39] now. And I claim them for
[1:31:42] him. I claim them as trophies of
[1:31:46] Christ. Love at
[1:31:48] Calvary. Now watch what he does. I
[1:31:51] challenge you to a
[1:31:55] debate even in
[1:32:00] prayer. Now, here's where I want to go.
[1:32:04] How many sick do we have here today? My
[1:32:06] hands up. I'm fighting just to preach to
[1:32:10] you.
[1:32:11] Yeah.
[1:32:15] Yeah. I want you to pray this prayer
[1:32:17] with me across your lips because that's
[1:32:20] the most powerful thing that you can do.
[1:32:23] Satan, you can't hold them no longer.
[1:32:28] They're children of God.
[1:32:31] And I'm bringing them right before
[1:32:35] you. You have to take your hand off of
[1:32:38] their
[1:32:39] life. They belong to God now. And I
[1:32:43] claim them for him.
[1:32:46] I claim them as trophies of Christ's
[1:32:52] love. I challenge you to a debate.
[1:32:57] You don't have any legal power.
[1:33:01] You don't have no power over them.
[1:33:04] You didn't have it in the first place.
[1:33:07] You was only bluffing them.
[1:33:10] And you was only bluffing. Christ Christ
[1:33:13] stripped you at Calvary.
[1:33:17] Of everything that you had.
[1:33:20] He stripped you. He stripped you of
[1:33:22] every power.
[1:33:24] And you're nothing but a bluff.
[1:33:27] And we're calling your blood
[1:33:36] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:56] I wrote this down
[1:33:58] yesterday when that
[1:34:00] prayer just stood out to
[1:34:04] me. None of us and even now I didn't do
[1:34:08] that just for an
[1:34:09] exercise. We cannot
[1:34:12] imagine when we release these
[1:34:15] words the victory that is about to
[1:34:18] happen.
[1:34:26] Sister Ella, how many times did the
[1:34:28] devil whisper in your ear, "This is the
[1:34:30] way you'll always be."
[1:34:32] Sure he did. Sure he
[1:34:36] did. And you didn't listen to him.
[1:34:40] None. If you would have time to sit with
[1:34:42] Sister
[1:34:43] Ella. I sat with her family and brother
[1:34:47] Biscll was in good shape that day. And
[1:34:51] we were sitting on brother Tom's back
[1:34:55] porch and we were just talking about
[1:34:57] fighting the
[1:34:59] enemy. And sister
[1:35:02] Ella, this is no joke, went on a on at
[1:35:06] least a
[1:35:08] 15minute quoting
[1:35:12] scriptures and quotes of the prophet of
[1:35:14] God. I looked at brother Ed and I said,
[1:35:18] "Listen, there's more preachers that
[1:35:21] would like to have that in their
[1:35:23] life." And she said in that condition,
[1:35:27] "Listen, you take the word of God."
[1:35:32] And throw it in Satan's face.
[1:35:39] Come on, church.
[1:35:44] have a few more minutes for me.
[1:35:46] I want to give you a few examples.
[1:35:49] Brother Brandon was standing in
[1:35:52] Houston and Dr. Best had
[1:35:55] challenged he had challenged the prophet
[1:35:58] of God and our movement that God didn't
[1:36:02] heal anymore. And basically what brother
[1:36:05] Brandham was doing was a false
[1:36:08] prophet and he was doing it by
[1:36:12] witchcraft. Now listen, no doubt he was
[1:36:14] a good man cuz brother Ram even
[1:36:16] compliments
[1:36:18] him. FF
[1:36:21] Bosworth, let me take the debate for
[1:36:23] you. He's a real
[1:36:26] man. Don't. And brother Brown warned
[1:36:28] him. Don't you go quarrel with him.
[1:36:31] Don't you go fight with him. Oh, I
[1:36:34] won't. So, that's a good reason for me
[1:36:36] and you right now. How many of you
[1:36:39] fought the devil this week?
[1:36:41] Oh, I'm preaching the right crowd.
[1:36:44] So, I'm going to I'm going to help you
[1:36:46] with next week. Brother Brand said,
[1:36:49] "Don't you quarrel with
[1:36:52] him. Don't you fight with him." "Oh, I
[1:36:54] won't." Now, I want you to say, "Oh, I
[1:36:56] won't." I won't. You did good. Say it
[1:36:59] again.
[1:37:02] So he walked up and while the debate
[1:37:05] starts, FF Bosworth does something
[1:37:10] infallible. He walks up and he hinges
[1:37:13] the entire debate on one question.
[1:37:20] What does the compound names of Jehovah
[1:37:24] have to do with Jesus Christ?
[1:37:29] Dr. Best being a Bible teacher knows I'm
[1:37:34] trapped.
[1:37:38] I'm
[1:37:39] trapped. Then all of his nonsense taking
[1:37:42] place, but there was something else
[1:37:44] happening. The angel was visiting the
[1:37:47] balcony
[1:37:50] cuz this was a conference that was about
[1:37:52] to happen. Yes, sir.
[1:37:55] We needed a picture.
[1:38:01] We needed a picture
[1:38:03] not just to hang on our walls
[1:38:06] to be in our heart and in our mind.
[1:38:11] There's the picture.
[1:38:14] With a hired photographer that was on
[1:38:16] the other side. All the other pictures
[1:38:19] didn't turn out, but that one did. Amen.
[1:38:25] Fight against it all you want to.
[1:38:29] Brother Brandham's the important figure
[1:38:31] of this age,
[1:38:35] but that light that's over his head,
[1:38:38] that's our Lord.
[1:38:55] Sister Melissa, this is
[1:38:56] where this is important to
[1:38:59] us is that same
[1:39:02] light goes home with you.
[1:39:09] That same light travels in the car with
[1:39:11] you.
[1:39:14] You may never see that light. And it's
[1:39:16] not so important that you see that
[1:39:18] light, but it's important that you know
[1:39:20] that light's with you.
[1:39:27] Brother Bill, he was with
[1:39:30] you when they were working on your
[1:39:33] heart.
[1:39:37] five
[1:39:38] bypasses, all of the things that they
[1:39:40] had to do with the valve and then to put
[1:39:43] a pacemaker
[1:39:46] in when I came and visited
[1:39:49] you there in the room that day. Listen,
[1:39:53] Satan had now
[1:39:56] waring waring with
[1:39:58] him, tell him the most critical things
[1:40:01] and talking to him about how weak he
[1:40:04] was. I felt inspired by
[1:40:07] God to remind him he's a son of God
[1:40:12] and to remind him he's going to get
[1:40:15] through this battle.
[1:40:18] And God, that light is with him.
[1:40:22] He's with you in the operating room.
[1:40:25] He's with you in your treatments. He's
[1:40:27] with you in the trials of your life.
[1:40:30] You may be the man in the arena, but
[1:40:32] he's with you.
[1:40:34] [Applause]
[1:40:45] At the end of the day, where stands the
[1:40:49] critic against brother Brandham?
[1:40:56] That man, let's just say it how it is.
[1:41:00] That man, Dr. best, none of us would
[1:41:03] have known
[1:41:04] him. None of us had have known him.
[1:41:07] Maybe he did phenomenal great things in
[1:41:11] the denominational
[1:41:14] world, but he picked the wrong time to
[1:41:18] be the critic.
[1:41:28] Brother Random in
[1:41:30] Chicago is in the hotel
[1:41:33] room and the Lord speaks to him. There's
[1:41:36] a
[1:41:40] trap. There's there's a war getting
[1:41:43] ready to
[1:41:44] happen. And he shows him that they're
[1:41:46] not going to be in the room that they
[1:41:47] rented.
[1:41:49] They're not going to get that room, but
[1:41:51] they're going to be in another room. And
[1:41:54] then he specifically, because God's
[1:41:56] always so accurate, he tells them where
[1:41:58] certain people will be
[1:42:01] seated. Now, the men that come to take
[1:42:03] care of brother Brandham, Brother
[1:42:04] Brandham tells them when they come to
[1:42:06] the room, and he tells them,
[1:42:11] says they're they've come to challenge
[1:42:13] me. They come to challenge me on the
[1:42:16] doctrines
[1:42:18] and they they try to ease it off. They
[1:42:19] try to no said no that's what they're
[1:42:22] going to do. And he says we'll not get
[1:42:25] the
[1:42:26] room that they say we're going to get.
[1:42:29] Oh we've got it rented but we're not
[1:42:31] going to get that room. And he tells him
[1:42:33] what color the next room we're going to
[1:42:34] be like. And then he tells them where
[1:42:37] people are going to sit. Not assigned
[1:42:40] seats. People wander through the place
[1:42:42] and come to a certain table and sat
[1:42:45] down. They're wandering through the
[1:42:47] place not knowing that God's watched
[1:42:49] them seat.
[1:42:53] You think, "Oh, I just walked into the
[1:42:55] closet and I picked out that tie."
[1:42:58] God knew the color tie you'd have.
[1:43:02] He knew. He knew the outfit that you
[1:43:04] would wear.
[1:43:07] Alexander, he knew you guys would be
[1:43:09] here.
[1:43:13] He knew you would be here. He knew you
[1:43:15] would be here in this meeting tonight
[1:43:17] and knows what you'll need.
[1:43:20] Sister Beth, we don't know what we're
[1:43:22] going to fight next week. So, God
[1:43:25] prepares us.
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:39] Well, you can hear it. God had
[1:43:40] explained. And they'll get up and say,
[1:43:42] "Well, you may disagree with him on his
[1:43:46] doctrines." And he reminds them, "Be
[1:43:49] careful as an angel with him."
[1:43:54] So, Brother
[1:43:55] Brandham greets them all. He's always a
[1:43:59] gentleman. I don't care what setting
[1:44:00] he's in. He's always a gentleman. He
[1:44:04] knows where he's
[1:44:05] at. He don't have any fear.
[1:44:08] He stands there as God's ambassador on
[1:44:11] the earth, representative as Elijah. And
[1:44:15] he's standing there and before the
[1:44:16] evening's over, he makes a challenge to
[1:44:21] him. Which of you will come and
[1:44:25] stand? Which of you will come? Water
[1:44:28] baptism, name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:44:30] it's in your Bible.
[1:44:32] The Godhead, it's in your Bible.
[1:44:35] Serpent seed, it's in your Bible.
[1:44:37] Brother Brandham wasn't preaching things
[1:44:39] to people that wasn't in the Bible.
[1:44:42] It's things that was hid in the Bible.
[1:44:45] And it was blowing away the traditions
[1:44:47] and the rituals and the creeds of
[1:44:50] denominationalism and the filters that
[1:44:52] was on people's eyes that they couldn't
[1:44:54] see the word of God. So God gave you
[1:44:58] prophet optics.
[1:45:07] None
[1:45:09] came. None came. Listen, our God is good
[1:45:14] in battle.
[1:45:17] Our God's been battle tested.
[1:45:20] Our God's not a
[1:45:23] He's always on time. I'm not just saying
[1:45:26] these things off of the cuff here.
[1:45:29] Your God that's on your side is always
[1:45:31] on time. He's always with you. He's
[1:45:36] never afraid.
[1:45:38] And he's not the kind of a challenger
[1:45:40] that will back up.
[1:45:43] If you call God on the scene, you better
[1:45:46] expect victory.
[1:46:05] 72 of those men said, "I we'll come and
[1:46:07] get baptized." 72 of them.
[1:46:10] Brother
[1:46:12] Kenny, your father was
[1:46:14] around. None of those men showed up.
[1:46:18] None of them showed up. the umbilical
[1:46:21] cord to their denomination wouldn't let
[1:46:22] them.
[1:46:28] That's why as message churches, we don't
[1:46:31] have boards.
[1:46:36] We don't have a board to where we answer
[1:46:37] to. We don't go to Jeffersonville to
[1:46:40] decide what we're preaching this year.
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:47] There's never going to be a meeting on
[1:46:48] whether we're going to let up on gay
[1:46:50] rights.
[1:46:52] There'll never be a meeting where we
[1:46:54] decide, okay, we're going to uh you
[1:46:56] know, you you you preached again
[1:46:58] abortion last night. Listen, that's from
[1:47:01] hell.
[1:47:05] Listen, we were in the hours, Sister
[1:47:06] Carney and myself were in the hours
[1:47:08] where doctors was telling us
[1:47:11] that abortion is a choice. It's never a
[1:47:14] choice.
[1:47:15] [Applause]
[1:47:26] I know there's extenduating
[1:47:28] circumstances.
[1:47:29] I'm not going to even leave loopholes to
[1:47:31] the devil.
[1:47:33] But look what Satan was trying to abort.
[1:47:40] Look what he was trying to abort.
[1:47:45] Listen, let me You preached it. I'll
[1:47:48] just come right behind you and preach.
[1:47:50] Satan don't fight you because you weigh
[1:47:52] 170bs.
[1:47:54] He don't fight you because you're
[1:47:56] married to Katie. He don't fight you cuz
[1:47:58] you got two beautiful daughters. He
[1:48:00] don't fight you cuz you got a nice
[1:48:02] house. He fights you because of your
[1:48:15] ministry. Hey, you know, brother Ron,
[1:48:18] many years ago, through a tough time in
[1:48:20] my life, my
[1:48:22] father-in-law stood in my face. big man
[1:48:25] sit in my face. Put his 45 caliber
[1:48:28] finger right in my And he said, "Satan's
[1:48:31] fighting you
[1:48:33] not because of who you are, but because
[1:48:36] of your ministry is destroying Satan's
[1:48:40] kingdom.
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:58] We got some new faces
[1:49:01] here. When Brother Brandham was here,
[1:49:03] you can go back on tape, but especially
[1:49:05] for the people I've been around long
[1:49:08] time now. I got gray
[1:49:10] hair. Glad I got gray
[1:49:13] hair. Chemo didn't bring it out. Made it
[1:49:18] kinky. But if you put enough glue on the
[1:49:20] top, it'll stay straight.
[1:49:31] But in many of the Brandham
[1:49:33] tabernacle, Brother Brandham would tell
[1:49:35] them to write visions or prophecies on
[1:49:39] the fly leaf of their Bible. I've been
[1:49:42] fortunate enough to see some of those
[1:49:43] Bibles to where that things were written
[1:49:46] down.
[1:49:49] You know, a lot of people say, "Well, I
[1:49:51] I I like this gift or that gift or that
[1:49:54] gift." Listen, God sent us one to this
[1:49:56] generation.
[1:49:58] Amen. God's not going to send another
[1:50:01] prophet.
[1:50:03] And that prophet
[1:50:06] was I don't know. I don't mean to use
[1:50:09] the word deadly accurate.
[1:50:13] And he tells people not a week before
[1:50:15] the incident, not a couple months before
[1:50:18] the incident. Two
[1:50:20] years that he sees that little boy in
[1:50:25] Finland. That's what he did. Two
[1:50:29] years. We got a We got a little boy
[1:50:31] here. I saw him three years before that
[1:50:35] we were going to have a
[1:50:37] baby. Is Isaac
[1:50:39] asleep? Isaac, would you stand up on
[1:50:41] your chair and just remain standing
[1:50:44] there?
[1:50:46] Yeah, you're getting
[1:50:50] tall.
[1:50:52] Okay. Now, is it okay just kind of keep
[1:50:55] him steady
[1:50:57] there? So, can you see him? Can
[1:51:00] everybody see Isaac? Amen. Yeah. You've
[1:51:03] heard it
[1:51:04] before and and sometimes we go, "Well,
[1:51:06] I've heard all that before." Well, I
[1:51:09] want to bring it in a different avenue.
[1:51:11] Brother Brandham tells his audience two
[1:51:13] years before that he sees a vision of
[1:51:15] being on the Russian Finish border.
[1:51:18] Soldiers there, trees there. Um he sees
[1:51:22] different things and he sees a little
[1:51:23] boy
[1:51:24] laying dead. I'm not going I'm not going
[1:51:28] to tell you every
[1:51:29] detail. Brother Random walks up on the
[1:51:32] scene. He's there for meetings and he
[1:51:33] walks up on the scene with the other
[1:51:36] brothers. Actually, the angel has to
[1:51:38] tell him to get out. get out and walk up
[1:51:40] on the scene. Nobody likes to see a
[1:51:42] wreck, but walks up and there's a little
[1:51:45] boy. Bones sticking out of his
[1:51:49] trousers,
[1:51:51] bones. He's
[1:51:53] dead. And he looks at the little boy and
[1:51:56] something clicks. I I've seen this
[1:51:58] before. I I've seen that boy before. And
[1:52:02] the angel starts tapping him on the
[1:52:03] shoulder three times. Taps him on the
[1:52:06] shoulder. Go back and look. And so we
[1:52:08] asked the other brothers said, "Was that
[1:52:09] little boy in the prayer line or was
[1:52:12] that little boy in the meetings? And was
[1:52:14] that little boy there?" He said, "I've
[1:52:15] seen him
[1:52:16] before." You know, Brother Ram's a man.
[1:52:19] Not only a prophet, but he's a man.
[1:52:22] Sometimes we say, "Well, Brother Ram
[1:52:23] made mistakes." Duh.
[1:52:30] But he's a man.
[1:52:33] But that vision didn't lie.
[1:52:36] And brother Random go gets his Bible,
[1:52:38] Hunter. He goes and gets his Bible and
[1:52:40] he opens it up. The angel tells him, "Go
[1:52:42] get your Bible." And he reads it.
[1:52:44] There's the soldiers. There's the trees.
[1:52:48] There's the boy.
[1:52:50] And now, Brother Brandham steps into
[1:52:53] operation and he says turns to all of
[1:52:56] those those other guys and says, "If
[1:53:00] this little boy man in the arena now, if
[1:53:04] this little boy isn't off of the ground
[1:53:06] in five minutes,
[1:53:12] he hinges entire reputation,
[1:53:16] his entire ministry
[1:53:20] Come on, believe the sign. Step up.
[1:53:28] You're not careful, you're going to be
[1:53:29] like Dr. Best.
[1:53:34] You'll be known to be the critic.
[1:53:41] If he's not off of the ground in five
[1:53:43] minutes, you call me a false prophet.
[1:53:47] Right.
[1:53:53] Brother Brown kneel down and I want you
[1:53:56] to hear his
[1:53:58] words. He said Satan could have lined up
[1:54:02] every devil in hell.
[1:54:09] I'm not talking about one devil. Most of
[1:54:12] us fight devils, but we ain't nearly
[1:54:14] fought the the main one. Amen.
[1:54:18] We ain't fought the one that Jesus
[1:54:19] fought.
[1:54:21] Stood face to face. Cuz Satan can't be
[1:54:23] every word, every place. So he has to
[1:54:26] send his underlings to fight you.
[1:54:31] We need to send him back to hell whipped
[1:54:35] every day, every time.
[1:54:50] He said, "You got to line up every devil
[1:54:52] in hell." And he couldn't have stopped
[1:54:57] it. Well, Brother Ron, I I don't know if
[1:54:59] I believe the story or not. Her
[1:55:04] grandfather met the family of the man
[1:55:07] that drove the car.
[1:55:12] It's in my notes. I just didn't know
[1:55:14] you'd be here.
[1:55:17] Well, brother, I don't know about so
[1:55:19] much brother Biscll's testimony. Well,
[1:55:21] okay. Let's just hinge it
[1:55:24] down. I was laying
[1:55:29] dying. I was the man in the
[1:55:32] arena. I was the one that were giving up
[1:55:35] because my lungs were so burned. You
[1:55:38] guys had just got married.
[1:55:41] And now you're helping take care of me
[1:55:44] in a
[1:55:50] hospital. And brother
[1:55:53] Biscll called Sister Connie on the day
[1:55:56] that they gave up. The doctors gave up
[1:55:59] on me and said there was no way for me
[1:56:02] to live. God spoke to brother Bisl and
[1:56:05] I've calculated it had to be in the
[1:56:07] middle of the
[1:56:09] night for him to call sister
[1:56:11] Connie and to tell sister Connie that
[1:56:16] brother
[1:56:17] Ron we have bought Mount Baker camp and
[1:56:20] God has spoke brother Ron will be the
[1:56:24] speaker in next year's camp.
[1:56:30] Oh, I feel like preaching now.
[1:56:34] Listen, let me just say this to you.
[1:56:35] We're not just anybody.
[1:56:38] [Applause]
[1:56:40] If God called my name to a servant of
[1:56:42] God 17 years ago and said, "I'm going to
[1:56:45] preserve his life to preach the gospel,"
[1:56:47] he's the same God today.
[1:56:50] [Applause]
[1:57:02] I don't know if I can believe those
[1:57:03] stories. Well, just turn your eyes
[1:57:05] toward him.
[1:57:08] Three
[1:57:10] years. Three
[1:57:12] years before he was
[1:57:15] born, God showed me a vision. Yeah. God
[1:57:19] still works with men and shows visions.
[1:57:22] A lot of people have
[1:57:23] visions, but God's got men that have
[1:57:26] visions.
[1:57:27] And God showed me a vision of that
[1:57:29] little fella walking through the
[1:57:32] yard. This may be a sticker for some
[1:57:35] people with a Disney t-shirt
[1:57:39] on with his finger up in the air. I wish
[1:57:42] I had that picture to show you right
[1:57:44] now. And God gave me his name. Amen.
[1:57:48] Right? And I had to hold that as a
[1:57:51] secret in my heart knowing that if I
[1:57:53] tell them that's what they'll call him.
[1:57:58] But you cannot imagine how I felt when I
[1:58:00] walked in and they said his name and it
[1:58:03] was exactly
[1:58:18] Whitney. You was the woman in the arena
[1:58:21] when they said you could never have
[1:58:22] children,
[1:58:24] but you held on. Baby, you was the man
[1:58:27] in the arena when your car was truck was
[1:58:29] wrapped around a tree and they told you
[1:58:32] that your pelvis was so shattered till
[1:58:34] you could never have children. But God
[1:58:37] has a plan.
[1:58:39] [Applause]
[1:58:52] Thank you. God has a plan.
[1:58:57] I'm not done, but I'm
[1:58:59] equipped. We will never surrender.
[1:59:03] We will fight for our families.
[1:59:06] We will fight for our children. We will
[1:59:09] fight for our healing. We will fight for
[1:59:12] deliverance. We will fight for joy.
[1:59:16] We will fight for peace. We will fight
[1:59:19] for the Holy Ghost.
[1:59:28] I'm going to put a sentence in here. I'm
[1:59:31] going to fight to live to the rapture.
[1:59:34] [Applause]
[2:00:01] Brother Ron, you look fine. You don't
[2:00:02] You don't look bad. I had three seizures
[2:00:04] before I walked out here today.
[2:00:07] Do you think the devil didn't whisper in
[2:00:09] my ear, "You're going to have seizure
[2:00:10] after seizure while you preach." But I
[2:00:12] didn't walk out here a coward.
[2:00:16] I didn't walk out here a I knew
[2:00:18] what I was preaching. I knew Satan was
[2:00:20] fighting against it. And the harder he
[2:00:23] fights, it shows more of the champion
[2:00:25] you are.
[2:00:27] [Applause]
[2:00:30] The harder you fight,
[2:00:33] the harder you
[2:00:36] fight, it only proves you're a
[2:00:41] champion.
[2:00:45] Hallelujah. Give him praise in the house
[2:00:47] of the Lord.
[2:01:07] I want to say this to
[2:01:08] you. It's worth fighting for.
[2:01:16] Young people, I'd like for you to just
[2:01:18] take one another's hand right there
[2:01:19] where you're at.
[2:01:23] all across this
[2:01:24] building, young
[2:01:35] people. I listened to Sister Nancy amen
[2:01:38] last
[2:01:39] night. I thought as a young person say
[2:01:42] an amen.
[2:01:45] She's been a
[2:01:47] warrior. Fought a back condition
[2:01:49] decades. Decades has fought that back
[2:01:52] condition. Fought sugar, open heart
[2:01:57] surgery. She watched a
[2:02:01] general be a pastor of this church all
[2:02:03] for
[2:02:04] decades, build this
[2:02:07] building. Listen, this didn't come easy.
[2:02:11] He was not a rich man by any man's
[2:02:19] imagination. But God said, "I'll bless
[2:02:21] everything that you
[2:02:23] touch. I'll bless
[2:02:29] it. Sister Nancy, you'll set with the
[2:02:32] queens of heaven." Amen.
[2:02:51] Titus, you like a lot of the young
[2:02:53] people here, Satan would like to make an
[2:02:55] offer.
[2:03:00] Like to make an
[2:03:01] offer in his offers, Elijah, in his
[2:03:05] offers. Maybe it's phenomenal
[2:03:09] job, phenomenal
[2:03:13] education, maybe phenomenal girlfriend,
[2:03:18] boyfriend, but if it takes you away from
[2:03:23] God, it ain't worth it.
[2:03:28] There's some things that you will have
[2:03:29] to fight as you begin to make choices in
[2:03:31] your life, Teddy. There's some things
[2:03:33] that you you'll have to fight.
[2:03:36] Now, for instance, life's worth fighting
[2:03:39] for. It's worth fighting for. You know,
[2:03:42] sometimes we the enemy wants to say,
[2:03:45] "You're just nothing." The only reason
[2:03:47] he tells you you're
[2:03:49] nothing, it's because you are something.
[2:03:51] Oh, yeah.
[2:03:54] I don't know why I'm telling you that,
[2:03:55] but you are something. Amen. You'll sit
[2:03:58] beside me of a at a table thousands of
[2:04:00] miles along, and you you'll be a little
[2:04:03] older than you are now.
[2:04:06] on and we'll sit there for eternity and
[2:04:09] all this stuff won't matter what. But we
[2:04:12] got to fight through this time to get
[2:04:15] there. Amen. Now, where's the battle
[2:04:17] going to be at right
[2:04:22] here? It won't be something that you
[2:04:24] will do with your
[2:04:28] hands. You won't be able to physically
[2:04:30] fight. That would be easy if you could
[2:04:32] do that. Or pull a sword or pull a 30
[2:04:36] off six. That'd be easy to do that. But
[2:04:38] you got to fight in your
[2:04:40] mind. And how you fight in your mind is
[2:04:43] with the word of
[2:04:46] God. And you have to
[2:04:49] realize, you have to realize the endgame
[2:04:53] here. You have to realize God's got a
[2:04:57] plan for my life.
[2:05:01] He's got a plan for my
[2:05:04] life.
[2:05:06] Girls, sitting on that that pew is more
[2:05:10] valuable than being a model.
[2:05:15] That's right.
[2:05:17] You that
[2:05:18] sing, no doubt Satan would like to make
[2:05:21] an offer to a country
[2:05:23] music
[2:05:24] record. He's not going to offer me that
[2:05:27] because I can't sing.
[2:05:30] But you that can really sing that's got
[2:05:32] that in your voice. Satan like to get
[2:05:35] that.
[2:05:39] But you got to fight.
[2:05:42] You're the man in the
[2:05:45] arena. You're taking care of
[2:05:48] horses and you love taking care of
[2:05:51] horses. So Satan's not going to offer
[2:05:53] you a fast car.
[2:05:57] He might offer you to take care of the
[2:06:00] Kentucky Derby
[2:06:03] champion, but it takes you away from
[2:06:06] church. Come on.
[2:06:09] And you go,
[2:06:11] "No." And you go, "Well, other people
[2:06:13] that won't mean nothing to them, but it
[2:06:15] means a lot to
[2:06:17] you because that's what you love." And
[2:06:20] so, Satan will take things that you love
[2:06:22] and war against you. Am I with you? Am I
[2:06:24] preaching to you?
[2:06:27] But you take the word of God and you say
[2:06:31] nothing can keep me
[2:06:36] from my
[2:06:45] God.
[2:06:48] Nothing. Nothing.
[2:06:55] With this in
[2:06:56] mind, I want us to pray
[2:07:02] together. Cuz I realize as much as he's
[2:07:04] fought me to preach this sermon, I
[2:07:07] realize Satan's got some plans.
[2:07:12] But I want to remind him he can have all
[2:07:15] the plans that he wants, but when I hit
[2:07:17] him in the mouth with the word of
[2:07:21] God, it destroys his
[2:07:24] plans. Heavenly Father,
[2:07:29] Lord, I feel your presence in this
[2:07:33] building. And Lord, I ask you right
[2:07:39] now. You know the things that we're
[2:07:41] going through in West
[2:07:44] Virginia. You know the things that we're
[2:07:46] going through in
[2:07:48] school. You know the things that we're
[2:07:50] going through on our
[2:07:51] job. You know what the doctors have told
[2:07:54] us even this
[2:07:56] week. The
[2:07:58] circumstances. Goliath roars. He's
[2:08:02] calling for war.
[2:08:04] He can do that until David shows
[2:08:06] up. God, brother Brandham said that
[2:08:09] God's got people on the earth that's not
[2:08:12] scared. I pray that Full Gospel
[2:08:14] Lighthouse has a group of people that's
[2:08:16] in this building that knows who they
[2:08:18] are, knows what they've been called to,
[2:08:22] what their purpose is in
[2:08:24] life, and they take the word of God and
[2:08:28] they bring it across their
[2:08:30] lips. And even they listen to the
[2:08:34] victory in their life as they begin to
[2:08:38] testify and to begin to confess, I am
[2:08:42] healed. I am saved. I am an overcomer. I
[2:08:47] am victorious. I am courageous.
[2:08:51] I will win and not lose. Amen. Now,
[2:08:55] Father, I ask you to bless every one of
[2:08:57] these young people, all of us alike,
[2:09:00] Father, this evening. Thank you for this
[2:09:03] word this
[2:09:04] day. Lord, bless this evening. Bless
[2:09:06] your people
[2:09:08] today in Jesus Christ's name. Amen and
[2:09:11] amen. Brother Andrew. Brother
[2:09:20] Andrew. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:26] Amen. We'll just sing worship the Lord
[2:09:29] for a moment here before we change order
[2:09:32] of the service
[2:09:34] here. Key be
[2:09:37] quiet.
[2:09:40] Amen. I need your
[2:09:44] glory. I want your glory.
[2:09:49] less me more. You is what I
[2:09:58] need. Show me your

[2:10:46] Brother Melvin, sister Shilla, you
[2:10:48] wouldn't mind just taking place me and
[2:10:52] more. You is what I
[2:10:56] [Music]
[2:10:58] need. Take all my pride, my selfish
[2:11:03] ways. Break me down so only
[2:11:09] remain. Lifting me of all that's faith

[2:15:31] [Music]
[2:15:45] Julia, we've been
[2:15:48] through an awful lot
[2:15:53] together. Rocky roads, troubling storms,
[2:15:57] and sinking
[2:16:00] sands. But the
[2:16:02] Lord has helped us brave the
[2:16:07] weather and shown us how to firmly take
[2:16:12] our stand.
[2:16:15] We
[2:16:16] forgive each other all the hurt and all
[2:16:20] the pain. We
[2:16:23] forgive each other so we can move on
[2:16:30] again in an effort to make best of this
[2:16:35] life that we live. We hold tight. We
[2:16:40] make right. And we forgive.
[2:16:43] [Music]
[2:16:54] Trying times will bring us close
[2:17:00] together. If we purpose to hold on, come
[2:17:04] what
[2:17:07] may, then we'll
[2:17:09] grow. And this will make us
[2:17:13] [Music]
[2:17:14] better as we give each other grace for
[2:17:18] every
[2:17:21] day. We
[2:17:23] forgive each other all the hurt and all
[2:17:27] the pain. We
[2:17:30] forgive each other so we can move on
[2:17:37] again in an effort to make best of this
[2:17:42] life that we live. We hold tight. We
[2:17:47] make right. And we forgive.
[2:17:53] Forgiveness makes our blind eye
[2:17:58] see.
[2:18:00] Forgiveness clears and sets us
[2:18:05] free.
[2:18:07] Forgiveness writes our every
[2:18:13] wrong.
[2:18:15] Forgiveness helps our love grow strong.
[2:18:22] We
[2:18:23] forgive each other, all the hurt and all
[2:18:27] the pain. We
[2:18:30] forgive each other so we can move on
[2:18:35] again.
[2:18:37] [Music]
[2:18:38] In an effort to make best of this life
[2:18:43] that we live, we hold tight. We make
[2:18:47] right and we
[2:18:51] forgive. We hold tight, we make right,
[2:18:55] and we
[2:18:57] [Music]
[2:19:03] forgive. God bless each and every one of
[2:19:05] you today.
[2:19:07] For those that are may have may wonder
[2:19:10] what is going on
[2:19:13] here, this is one of our families that
[2:19:16] the light shone on their pathways and
[2:19:20] raised
[2:19:21] Amish, raised by
[2:19:24] tradition, married by
[2:19:27] tradition, was raising family by
[2:19:29] tradition.
[2:19:31] When they come to the message, they saw
[2:19:33] that there's something different about
[2:19:36] real
[2:19:37] marriage and a real man and a real
[2:19:40] woman and a real
[2:19:54] family. We've heard it in your
[2:19:57] voice. We've saw it in your worship.
[2:20:01] We saw the
[2:20:04] change. You were longing for
[2:20:07] God. You were longing for something
[2:20:10] more. And no doubt somebody else told
[2:20:12] you about it. This is different. This is
[2:20:17] real. But then you experienced it for
[2:20:21] yourself
[2:20:22] individually. You experienced it. You
[2:20:26] tell us about a service here just
[2:20:28] recently to where you was in another
[2:20:31] world and your wife was as well and you
[2:20:35] woke you go out of the service and
[2:20:38] you and you don't even speak for a while
[2:20:41] but after a while you begin to
[2:20:44] share I got to have more than that. I
[2:20:47] want to get back into that. I want to
[2:20:49] spend my whole life into that.
[2:20:53] Marriage can be like that.
[2:20:55] Not just a marriage to Christ, but to
[2:20:57] one
[2:20:58] another. The song said, "We
[2:21:01] forgive. There's been hurts. There's
[2:21:04] been
[2:21:05] trials." That's
[2:21:08] life. But when you have the reality of
[2:21:10] Christ living in your lives, there's
[2:21:14] nothing like
[2:21:15] it. It's hard for me to imagine, but in
[2:21:19] the Garden of Eden, God has his first
[2:21:21] wedding.
[2:21:24] Man was God's own spitten
[2:21:27] image. But there was something
[2:21:31] missing. Man had something inside of him
[2:21:34] that God had inside of
[2:21:36] himself. God longed for a
[2:21:41] wife and Adam was
[2:21:44] lonely. Animals were nice to fellowship
[2:21:47] with, but he couldn't talk to
[2:21:49] them. You know, the grass was beautiful,
[2:21:52] but he couldn't express his feelings.
[2:21:55] One day, God performed an operation and
[2:21:58] caused a deep sleep to come on
[2:22:00] Adam. Adam went to sleep, and when he
[2:22:03] woke
[2:22:05] up, he saw the most beautiful creature
[2:22:07] he had ever seen in his life. Listen,
[2:22:10] when God does something, he does it
[2:22:13] well. He does it extremely well. and he
[2:22:17] looked at her. She was the most
[2:22:21] beautiful.
[2:22:22] God has the same thing in his
[2:22:25] life. He wants a
[2:22:28] wife and she's the most beautiful bride
[2:22:31] around the world and he so wants to join
[2:22:35] her and so wants to his life to live on
[2:22:38] the inside of her. And so the message is
[2:22:42] a marriage union.
[2:22:44] It's more than just a prophet's
[2:22:46] words. It's a marriage union. And
[2:22:50] brother Random said that before the
[2:22:52] foundation of the world, he slipped a
[2:22:55] wedding band of predestinated unmarited
[2:22:58] grace on us before the foundation of the
[2:23:02] world. And he says that we are the
[2:23:04] living physical attributes of God that
[2:23:08] God thought of before the foundation of
[2:23:10] the world.
[2:23:13] Melvin, I know I don't know exactly the
[2:23:16] marriage ceremony that you had 10 years
[2:23:19] ago, but today the vows mean more than
[2:23:23] ever
[2:23:23] before. The vows that you
[2:23:26] say, I pray that the things that you do
[2:23:30] during the day, the chores that you do
[2:23:34] will be more with love than ever before.
[2:23:37] And I pray that you have a from this day
[2:23:40] forward have an even greater marriage
[2:23:43] than you've ever had.
[2:23:45] You have wonderful children that are the
[2:23:48] product of your
[2:23:49] marriage. For two becomes one, two,
[2:23:52] three, four,
[2:23:54] five,
[2:23:57] six. You keep it up, you'll have a
[2:23:59] baseball team.
[2:24:04] So, you've said these vows before, but
[2:24:06] today it means much more to
[2:24:11] you. So, I'll get you to say these with
[2:24:16] me. I'm Melvin. Take you Sabella. Take
[2:24:20] you to be my wife. To be my wife. To
[2:24:25] heaven to hope.
[2:24:28] From this day forward. From this day
[2:24:30] forward. For better, for worse. For
[2:24:32] better, for worse. for rich or for poor.
[2:24:34] for richer for poor. In sickness and in
[2:24:37] health. in sickness and and to cherish
[2:24:40] And to cherish until death do us part.
[2:24:43] As God is my witness. As God is my
[2:24:47] I give you my promise. I give you my
[2:24:50] promise.
[2:24:51] Sister
[2:24:52] Seilla, I
[2:24:57] take you Melvin
[2:25:00] to be my husband.
[2:25:04] to have and to hold.
[2:25:08] From this day forward,
[2:25:11] for better, for worse,
[2:25:13] for rich or for poor,
[2:25:16] in sickness and in health, sickness and
[2:25:18] health, to love and to cherish,
[2:25:22] I part.
[2:25:25] As God is my witness, as God is my I
[2:25:29] give you my promise. I give you my
[2:25:31] promise.
[2:25:34] The scripture tells
[2:25:36] us, "If I speak of tongues of men and
[2:25:38] angels and have not love, I'm only a
[2:25:42] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol. If
[2:25:45] I have the gift of prophecy and cannot
[2:25:47] fathom all the mysteries and all the
[2:25:49] knowledge. If I have a faith that can
[2:25:52] move mountains, but have not love, I
[2:25:55] have
[2:25:57] nothing. If I give all that I possess to
[2:26:00] the poor and surrender my body to the
[2:26:03] fire and have not love, I am
[2:26:07] nothing. And I remind you of the
[2:26:09] scripture, love is
[2:26:11] patient. Love is
[2:26:13] kind. It does not envy. It does not
[2:26:17] boast. It is not proud. It is not
[2:26:21] rude. It is not
[2:26:23] self-seeking. It is not easily angered.
[2:26:27] It keeps no record of
[2:26:30] wrongs. Love does not delight in evil,
[2:26:33] but rejoices with truth. It always
[2:26:37] protects. It always trusts. It always
[2:26:41] hopes and it always
[2:26:45] preserves. That's not just God's love,
[2:26:47] but that's for our our love as
[2:26:50] well. Congratulations on being here. And
[2:26:55] what an astounding thing it is today.
[2:27:00] Now, we're not given rings, but I want
[2:27:03] to I want to do this for you.
[2:27:06] You got rings? Let's do it,
[2:27:14] baby. Do you have them with you?
[2:27:20] Yeah. You go, girl.
[2:27:31] Well, you got a big
[2:27:44] finger. Though small in size or large in
[2:27:49] size, these rings are very significant.
[2:27:53] They're made of precious metal and they
[2:27:56] remind us that the
[2:27:58] love that we have for one another, and I
[2:28:01] can't say this well enough, is not
[2:28:04] cheap. Our love is not
[2:28:08] common. Love cost us
[2:28:10] dearly. It's part of that
[2:28:13] for for better, for
[2:28:15] worse. We give our life for our baby,
[2:28:18] our wives. We would do that in a
[2:28:19] heartbeat.
[2:28:21] It's made in a circle. Their design
[2:28:25] tells us that love must never come to an
[2:28:29] end. It must always be
[2:28:33] continuous. As you wear these rings,
[2:28:36] whether together or
[2:28:40] apart, may this be a constant
[2:28:43] reminder of the promises that you made
[2:28:47] before God. and Brother Ron
[2:28:52] today. Brother Melvin, will you take
[2:28:55] that smallest ring and put it and I want
[2:28:59] you to repeat with me as you put it on
[2:29:01] her finger and hold it
[2:29:07] there. I give you this ring I give you
[2:29:10] this ring as a symbol of my vow. as a
[2:29:13] symbol of my vow. and with all that I
[2:29:16] am. With all that I am and all that I
[2:29:19] have. And all that I have, I honor you
[2:29:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[2:29:25] honor you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:29:27] Christ.
[2:29:33] As you place it on your finger, just
[2:29:35] repeat with me. I give you this ring. I
[2:29:38] give you as a symbol of my vow.
[2:29:43] And with all that I am,
[2:29:46] and all that I have.
[2:29:48] I honor you in the name of the Lord
[2:29:50] Jesus
[2:29:55] Christ. Bless your heart. You're so
[2:29:57] precious. Amen. Could we all pray?
[2:30:08] Father, we can truly say we feel the
[2:30:11] presence of the
[2:30:12] Lord and your nearness to us right
[2:30:17] now. Lord, as I have stood here as an
[2:30:19] officer of this state, as a
[2:30:22] representative of your
[2:30:25] kingdom, and rededicate their
[2:30:28] vows under the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:30:32] Christ, not under a name of a
[2:30:35] church, I ask you to bless this
[2:30:38] marriage like never
[2:30:41] before. I pray that you protect them. I
[2:30:45] pray that you'd give them love like
[2:30:47] they've never had. May there be a
[2:30:50] renewing of
[2:30:51] fire. Touch their
[2:30:53] lives. Holy Spirit, you're welcome in
[2:30:56] their home.
[2:30:58] Their home is more than just for their
[2:31:00] children to play in, but may the angels
[2:31:03] of God stand present. And may they feel
[2:31:06] your presence
[2:31:07] there. Bless them from this day forward
[2:31:10] like never before. We pray. And as an
[2:31:13] audience, we're so proud of them. We
[2:31:16] love them with all of our hearts. As a
[2:31:18] pastor, we're so pleased. And Lord, we
[2:31:21] ask you that you would bless them this
[2:31:23] day in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:31:27] Christ.
[2:31:28] Amen. Brother Melvin, Sister
[2:31:32] Seilla, you've exchanged vows and you've
[2:31:35] exchanged rings, and I marry you by the
[2:31:38] authority of the state.

[2:31:44] to tell you you can kiss your
[2:32:03] wife.

[2:32:45] ding on her
[2:32:46] [Laughter]
