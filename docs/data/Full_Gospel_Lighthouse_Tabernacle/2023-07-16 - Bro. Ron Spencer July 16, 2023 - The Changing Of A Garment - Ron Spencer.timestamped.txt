[37:29] you
[37:30] Malachi and Chloe
[37:33] quite an honor to have you guys with us
[37:35] this morning
[37:37] and last night Mark and them got home at
[37:39] 1 21. he texted me when they got home
[37:42] last night
[37:44] I'm just glad everybody had a safe trip
[37:46] home after all that rain and darkness
[37:48] and
[37:51] sure can't pick the weather
[37:53] but we're glad to get a little rain
[37:56] not too much rain
[37:58] amen we're glad to get that
[38:00] glad they were able to be here in the
[38:02] meeting and so glad to have your dad
[38:04] with us
[38:06] each and every one of you have baptism
[38:08] later after service after the preaching
[38:10] of the word but we have a baby baby
[38:12] dedication
[38:15] morning
[38:16] and I was thinking
[38:18] brother Nathan
[38:20] what a masterpiece of a sermon boy he
[38:24] did his he did his church proud and so
[38:26] Amen brother Wayne and brother Ray would
[38:29] be very thrilled with brother Samuel
[38:31] would be very thrilled with that message
[38:34] and and glad they could stay over this
[38:37] morning to be with us and and uh
[38:41] if you notice I'm about half his size
[38:46] and so that's why this
[38:48] desk is a little shorter so
[38:52] he was reaching down and I'm reaching up
[38:54] so somewhere you have a medium so
[38:56] amen I preached that Joshua commission
[39:00] for all of these years and I heard it
[39:02] last night and I thought you know
[39:04] what a balance of the scriptures what a
[39:07] balance of the word and I so loved it
[39:09] with all my heart and so many incredible
[39:12] notes if you didn't get to listen to it
[39:13] go back and listen to it again I'm sure
[39:15] you're like myself you'll listen to it
[39:17] and and you'll catch something you
[39:19] didn't hear
[39:21] and then we always enjoy brother
[39:22] Andrew's gift
[39:27] because that's how we water the word the
[39:29] spirit of the Lord just comes down and
[39:31] amen's the word after it's over with and
[39:33] many of you were blessed in a
[39:36] supernatural way and
[39:37] and you begin to Worship the Lord and
[39:40] just getting in the spirit and so we
[39:43] thank you we we thank you Andrew we
[39:45] thank you brother Nathan we certainly
[39:48] enjoyed it with all of our hearts and
[39:50] and so glad that Mark and them made it
[39:52] home so glad you guys stayed over amen
[39:56] and this morning we have a baby
[39:58] dedication we're really thrilled but I
[40:00] was thinking brother Nathan's going to
[40:02] think that what we do is dedicate babies
[40:04] here
[40:05] every service and that'd be fine too
[40:09] it's scriptural husbands love your wives
[40:12] and so
[40:14] and so we're so glad to have brother
[40:15] Hunter
[40:17] family with us and so glad you guys are
[40:20] here and I was looking over this morning
[40:23] that
[40:25] Ada one of the origins is a
[40:28] Germanic
[40:30] the element of Adele
[40:33] meaning nobility
[40:35] for example as a part of the names of
[40:37] adley or Adeline
[40:40] and we have a grand we have a grand baby
[40:42] named Adeline
[40:44] and the name can also Trace to be a
[40:46] Hebrew origin sometimes spelled a d h a
[40:50] h meaning adornment and I thought of how
[40:54] special we're going to have a baby
[40:56] dedication
[40:57] and in a few moments I'm going to preach
[41:00] to you on changing your garment
[41:03] amen
[41:05] gray I I've laughed a lot and so I'm
[41:08] reading this before you guys get here
[41:11] gray is after her grandmother
[41:14] great-grandmother
[41:15] Dorothy Gray Simpson
[41:20] grandmother Grandpa Simpson is 94 full
[41:24] of spunk
[41:25] and are key to a long life is being
[41:28] stubborn
[41:32] I know some people that'll live forever
[41:39] and if you ever mix temper with
[41:41] stubbornness
[41:46] you know what I'm talking about
[41:48] that's why we needed a clothing change
[41:51] and so amen my grandmother just to put
[41:56] this here my grandmother on my mother's
[41:59] side was
[42:01] I think her middle name was stubborn
[42:05] and I'll just give you a first example
[42:07] if she would get a little tiff with you
[42:09] she wouldn't speak to you living in the
[42:12] same house eating at the same table
[42:18] having bedrooms right near each other
[42:20] and I lived with her for a few years and
[42:23] she could go for weeks
[42:24] without acknowledging you were in the
[42:27] room
[42:30] and somewhere she'd get over it because
[42:32] you wasn't going to help it somewhere
[42:34] she'd get over it
[42:35] but when she got a new birth
[42:38] she she became a real lady
[42:41] she lost some of the stubbornness but

[42:57] us
[43:04] Hallelujah
[43:06] amen
[43:08] God bless you this is my first sighting
[43:10] so you're beautiful
[43:16] Hallelujah
[43:18] come on up here Grandpa Grandma
[43:22] come on come on up
[43:25] yeah we're so glad to have you guys with
[43:27] us
[43:29] how nice to me nice to see you I'll
[43:32] shake all of your hands in a minute but
[43:34] thank you and thank you sorry about the
[43:37] loss of your father yes
[43:40] today we come to the baby dedication and
[43:43] we never want to take these things for
[43:45] granted come on around here brother
[43:47] Vernon sister Kathy
[43:48] you look good in that pink
[43:58] as we realize it's a very important
[44:00] event
[44:01] it was important with Jesus
[44:04] he would take time to dedicate children
[44:07] and he would remind the disciples when
[44:10] they would ask him who's the greatest in
[44:11] the kingdom of heaven and he said except
[44:14] you becomes a little child you'll not
[44:16] enter
[44:18] the scripture is very specific about how
[44:20] that when Jesus was dedicated and is
[44:23] circumcised as well
[44:25] and even as brother Branham would have
[44:27] long meetings as we talked last night he
[44:30] would have long meetings
[44:32] but yet in front of it we may dedicate
[44:34] eight ten children and he found it was
[44:37] extremely important I find it's
[44:39] extremely important
[44:41] because as God gives us a child
[44:44] and as we thought about it we stood here
[44:47] not long ago and you guys said I do
[44:51] and it was a beautiful wedding
[44:53] but now too become one and a beautiful
[44:56] child
[44:58] and you know Satan gets in the details
[45:00] and he wants to make us sick
[45:02] gives us some Terror as we come to the
[45:05] thought
[45:06] but today we can stand and say a miracle
[45:09] took place
[45:11] he's watched over your lives to have
[45:13] become one two families become one
[45:16] the scripture tells us hear o Israel
[45:19] the Lord our God
[45:22] the Lord is one
[45:24] love the Lord
[45:26] your God with all your heart
[45:28] and with all your soul and with all your
[45:30] strength
[45:31] and these Commandments that I give you
[45:33] today
[45:35] are to be upon your hearts and impress
[45:38] them upon your children
[45:40] and talk about them when you sit down at
[45:42] home
[45:43] walk along the road
[45:45] when you lie down and when you get up
[45:48] he's in our conversation
[45:50] he's in her life
[45:52] he's to be left
[45:55] first Samuel chapter 1 and verse 27.
[45:58] I prayed for this child
[46:01] and the Lord granted me
[46:03] what I ask of him
[46:05] and so now I give him to the Lord
[46:09] for this whole life he will be given
[46:11] over to the Lord
[46:14] and he worshiped the Lord then
[46:18] God gave us a sacred charge
[46:22] because life is a miracle
[46:24] this Baby's a miracle
[46:26] from the Lamb's Book of Life God thought
[46:29] of us before the foundation of the world
[46:31] now all your thoughts of what will it be
[46:34] like to be a daddy
[46:35] how will I love him
[46:37] how will I love her and how will I be a
[46:40] good mom
[46:42] all that mystery is now revealed
[46:45] she's the boss
[46:47] she tells you when to get up and when to
[46:50] go to sleep
[46:51] and you know
[46:53] she doesn't know what a clock is
[46:56] and she doesn't know
[46:58] anything but I'm hungry and I'm wet
[47:04] but God's going to watch over her
[47:06] because you're given her back to him
[47:10] God gave her to you and now you give her
[47:13] back to him
[47:14] now you'll watch over her with the best
[47:16] of your ability you'll take care of her
[47:20] she'll be sick and you're what do I do
[47:24] and you'll ask the Lord can he come in a
[47:26] room and touch her
[47:28] and maybe even while you're praying
[47:30] you'll feel that fevered brow just go
[47:33] away
[47:34] maybe a earache or
[47:36] toothaches isn't God good that you don't
[47:39] don't have earaches like that when
[47:42] you're grown
[47:44] or you break through teeth when you're
[47:46] this age
[47:48] but God has gave them to you
[47:51] and what a special event that today we
[47:54] can dedicate her back to the Lord and
[47:57] God made us a promise
[47:59] that he'll watch over her
[48:01] and he'll protect her
[48:03] what a beautiful name
[48:05] what a beautiful man
[48:14] Hallelujah isn't she beautiful

[49:06] into this life
[49:09] but Lord we are the physical
[49:11] manifestation
[49:13] of your thoughts from the for the

[57:59] amen
[58:00] cancer is a vicious but battle
[58:03] sometimes the Cure is worse than the
[58:05] disease and so
[58:07] amen
[58:09] Saint John chapter 14 and verse 1.
[58:14] let not your heart be troubled
[58:17] you believe in God believe also in me
[58:21] in my father's house there are many
[58:23] mansions and if it were not so I would
[58:26] have told you
[58:27] I go
[58:30] to prepare a place for you
[58:33] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[58:35] I will come again and receive you unto
[58:38] myself that where I am
[58:41] there you may be also
[58:44] and whether I go you know and the way
[58:47] that you know and Thomas saith unto him
[58:50] Lord we know not whether thou goest and
[58:53] how can we know the way
[58:55] and Jesus saith unto him
[58:58] I am the way
[59:00] he didn't say I'm one of the ways
[59:03] I am the way
[59:05] the truth and the life and no man cometh
[59:09] unto the father but by me
[59:12] if you had known me you should have
[59:14] known my father also and from henceforth
[59:17] you know him
[59:18] and have seen him and Philip saith unto
[59:21] him Lord
[59:22] show us the father and it sufficeth us
[59:26] and Jesus saith unto him have not I been
[59:30] so long time with you and yet you have
[59:32] not known me
[59:34] Philip
[59:36] and he that hath seen me hath seen the
[59:38] father
[59:39] and how sayest thou then show us the
[59:42] father
[59:43] believeth thou not that I am in the
[59:46] father and the father in me the words
[59:49] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[59:51] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[59:53] me he doeth the works
[59:55] believe me that I am in the father and
[59:58] the father in me or else believe me for
[1:00:01] the very work's sake
[1:00:03] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:00:06] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:00:11] shall he do also
[1:00:13] and Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:00:16] because I go unto my father
[1:00:19] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[1:00:22] that will I do that the father might be
[1:00:26] glorified in the son
[1:00:28] and if you ask anything in my name
[1:00:31] I will do it amen you may be seated may
[1:00:35] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[1:00:40] you might think by her opening
[1:00:42] scriptures that were
[1:00:44] having a funeral here
[1:00:46] kind of opposite
[1:00:50] First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse
[1:00:52] 35 I found it's interesting that these
[1:00:55] are the last scriptures that brother
[1:00:57] Nathan dealt with last night
[1:01:00] in First Corinthians chapter 15 and
[1:01:03] verse 35 Paul is speaking of our body
[1:01:07] change
[1:01:08] actually from one body to another body
[1:01:11] that's what Jesus is talking about I go
[1:01:15] to prepare a place for you
[1:01:17] you're not going to live in that that
[1:01:20] body
[1:01:22] that body's got to be changed that
[1:01:25] body's got to get that's got sin in it
[1:01:29] you're born again but that flesh has got
[1:01:31] to go back to the Earth the spirit's got
[1:01:34] to go back but the Soul on the inside of
[1:01:37] you that's the gene seed of God and it's
[1:01:41] got an eternal and let me let me just
[1:01:43] say this to you and this is not a harsh
[1:01:45] statement but let me just say this to
[1:01:46] you either you've got God living on the
[1:01:49] inside of you
[1:01:52] or you've got the enemy living on the
[1:01:55] inside of you there's not a fence
[1:01:59] there's not a middle ground here
[1:02:03] there you know it's either black or it's
[1:02:05] white it's either right or it's wrong
[1:02:08] you're either a sinner or you're a
[1:02:10] Christian
[1:02:12] and so your influence from one realm or
[1:02:15] another Realm
[1:02:16] and Paul is saying here but some some
[1:02:19] men will say how are the dead raised up
[1:02:23] and and with what body do they come
[1:02:26] quite a question
[1:02:28] huh
[1:02:30] thou fu
[1:02:32] that was that that would that thou
[1:02:35] sowest is not quick and accepted die
[1:02:38] and that which thou sowest thou sowest
[1:02:42] not that the body shall be but bear
[1:02:46] grain that it might chance of weed or
[1:02:50] some other grain but God giveth it a
[1:02:53] body as it has pleased him and to every
[1:02:57] seed his own body
[1:03:00] verse 50. now this I say brethren
[1:03:04] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:03:08] kingdom of God
[1:03:09] in heaven there's not going to be any
[1:03:11] sin
[1:03:14] you can I can spend an hour on what's
[1:03:16] not going to be in heaven according to
[1:03:19] the scriptures fornicators adulterers
[1:03:22] robbers thiefs murderers they're not
[1:03:24] going to be in heaven what a place
[1:03:28] not going to be a newspaper for you to
[1:03:30] have to read about the top 10 uh
[1:03:33] horrible events that happened are you
[1:03:35] with me now
[1:03:37] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[1:03:41] all sleep
[1:03:42] but we shall all be changed
[1:03:47] in a moment and the twinkling of an eye
[1:03:51] at the last trumpet for the trumpet
[1:03:53] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:03:57] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:04:01] for this corruption
[1:04:05] no matter how much you pamper it no
[1:04:08] matter how much that you put perfume on
[1:04:10] it no matter what a nice dress or what a
[1:04:13] nice suit that you put on it no matter
[1:04:15] how you comb the hair
[1:04:19] it's a dying flesh
[1:04:23] are you with me now we need a body
[1:04:25] change
[1:04:27] but this corruptable must put on
[1:04:29] incorruption
[1:04:31] to where no cells in the body die
[1:04:36] quite a statement isn't it
[1:04:38] and and this Mortal must put on
[1:04:41] immortality
[1:04:43] so when this corruptable shall have put
[1:04:45] on incorruption and this Mortal shall
[1:04:48] have put on immortality then shall be
[1:04:51] brought to pass the saying that is
[1:04:53] written death is swallowed up in Victory
[1:04:58] now Paul writes some incredible words oh
[1:05:01] death where is thy stink
[1:05:04] oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting
[1:05:07] of death is sin and the strength of sin
[1:05:10] is the law but thanks be to God which
[1:05:13] give us thus victory
[1:05:16] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] now if I can just share a few things
[1:05:23] with you
[1:05:24] Jesus had a friend
[1:05:26] that was getting sicker and sicker and
[1:05:28] sicker we know the story is lazarus's
[1:05:31] resurrection
[1:05:33] and when Jesus comes in verse 38 of John
[1:05:37] chapter 11. and Jesus therefore groaning
[1:05:40] in himself cometh to the grave and it
[1:05:43] was a cave and a stone lay upon it and
[1:05:47] Jesus said take ye away the stone Jesus
[1:05:51] could have spoke the stone he spoke to
[1:05:53] winds
[1:05:55] he spoke to water and it became wine
[1:05:59] but he was challenging their faith in
[1:06:03] the resurrection
[1:06:05] sometimes he challenges your face
[1:06:08] he challenges you to make a move
[1:06:11] are you with me now take you away the
[1:06:14] stone listen these two sisters you would
[1:06:17] you would if you were standing there and
[1:06:19] you as a Critic of Jesus on this day and
[1:06:22] you were thinking well why don't he move
[1:06:24] the stone
[1:06:27] that's a heavy Stone they've sealed the
[1:06:30] stone why don't he move the stone he's
[1:06:33] asking you
[1:06:36] do you really believe because once you
[1:06:40] put your hands on the stone then you're
[1:06:42] identified with him
[1:06:45] once you put your work yourself in the
[1:06:48] word then you're identified with the
[1:06:50] word
[1:06:51] all its shame all its Glory
[1:06:56] are you with me now and they roll the
[1:06:58] stone away now remember the scripture
[1:07:01] said maybe you was a maybe you as a
[1:07:04] child you when they would ask you to
[1:07:07] quote a scripture memorize a scripture I
[1:07:10] memorized it pretty well Jesus wept
[1:07:18] Jesus wept not just because of people's
[1:07:21] unbelief
[1:07:23] but Jesus wept because he had to call
[1:07:26] Lazarus from where he was
[1:07:28] back to where he was going to be
[1:07:32] because Lazarus was not he was not in a
[1:07:36] situation to where he was going to step
[1:07:39] into that body and be there forever and
[1:07:42] when he came back immediately
[1:07:46] immediately he would have to fight the
[1:07:48] same enemy all over again
[1:07:51] that sickness that came on him and took
[1:07:53] him to death he'd be healed of that
[1:07:55] sickness
[1:07:57] and when Jesus called him by name
[1:08:00] Lazarus come forth
[1:08:02] no doubt he was fellowshipping with the
[1:08:05] Saints in Abraham's bosom and he was
[1:08:07] maybe talking about what the Messiah was
[1:08:09] and maybe how that they fell a ship
[1:08:12] together the Miracles that they had seen
[1:08:14] listen everything that you prophesied
[1:08:17] about Joseph everything that you
[1:08:19] prophesied about Abraham everything that
[1:08:22] you prophesied throughout the prophets
[1:08:24] Jeremiah nahu of all of them prophesied
[1:08:27] Isaac Isaiah everything that you
[1:08:30] prophesied I've got the opportunity to
[1:08:33] set in these meetings I've got the
[1:08:35] opportunity to sit at the table with him
[1:08:38] I've got the opportunity to be with him
[1:08:41] he's got
[1:08:44] and he's either God or is the greatest
[1:08:47] deceiver that's has ever been
[1:08:50] I I've witnessed him I've witnessed him
[1:08:53] not only say be healed but I've saw the
[1:08:56] results of it
[1:08:58] a lot of people make promises no results
[1:09:00] a lot of people say things no results
[1:09:03] but when he said to the water to the
[1:09:07] wine there was results best wine
[1:09:11] when he prayed over Fish and Loaves I'll
[1:09:15] tell you we fed 5 000 people not
[1:09:18] counting children and at the end of it
[1:09:21] we took up 12. you're talking about our
[1:09:24] testimony service in Abraham's bosom
[1:09:30] all of them were waiting on the
[1:09:32] resurrection they were they had died but
[1:09:36] there was a promise through job that
[1:09:38] there was going to come a resurrection
[1:09:41] even in Psalms 22 David writes under
[1:09:45] inspiration I'll not suffer mine Holy
[1:09:49] One to see corruption
[1:09:52] so this Messiah
[1:09:55] Will Conquer death hell and the grave
[1:09:59] and I'm sure he was telling them listen
[1:10:02] he's the one that will conquer death
[1:10:07] he's the one that will bring
[1:10:09] Resurrection
[1:10:14] now
[1:10:16] he calls him by name
[1:10:18] brother Brandon said had he not called
[1:10:20] him by name
[1:10:22] there would have been a general
[1:10:23] Resurrection because he was the
[1:10:25] resurrection
[1:10:26] now he's causing Lazarus
[1:10:31] come forth
[1:10:36] listen he had no choice
[1:10:43] he heard his name
[1:10:45] how far away it is it's obviously not
[1:10:47] far away
[1:10:49] and he heard his name
[1:10:51] and from those regions
[1:10:54] he come walking out of the grave
[1:10:56] now Lazarus was a poor man
[1:11:00] now the rich people they would do a lot
[1:11:03] of decorating to the Bible
[1:11:05] they do a lot of things to the body it
[1:11:07] and they do a lot of things that would
[1:11:09] you know when they were buried they'd
[1:11:11] put them in Royal clothes and all
[1:11:13] different kind of things but Lazarus is
[1:11:16] Poor Man
[1:11:18] so they put him in rags
[1:11:20] and they wrapped those rags and they
[1:11:22] would wrap it around the whole body
[1:11:24] they'd wrap it around the the head
[1:11:26] they'd wrap it over his eyes and his
[1:11:29] mouth and wrap it around his feet then
[1:11:32] they would anoint him with certain
[1:11:34] ointments for its death to keep down the
[1:11:37] stench
[1:11:38] and they would anoint for certain
[1:11:41] purposes all over him
[1:11:45] and I want you to just notice what Jesus
[1:11:48] gives them a commission
[1:11:50] take off his grave clothes
[1:11:54] he's not going to need them anymore
[1:11:59] so he needed a garment change
[1:12:03] cause you can't live in grave clothes
[1:12:06] that's why me and you need to be born
[1:12:08] again
[1:12:10] because you can't live in them dead
[1:12:12] clothes any longer once you meet Jesus
[1:12:15] take off them all rags
[1:12:18] take off those all ways of doing things
[1:12:21] the old man has to die with the sin and
[1:12:25] the new man comes to life
[1:12:30] I've always thought this incredible
[1:12:34] absolutely incredible in John chapter
[1:12:37] 12.
[1:12:39] it says then then Jesus
[1:12:42] six days before the Passover came to
[1:12:45] Bethany
[1:12:46] where Lazarus was with was which had
[1:12:51] been dead
[1:12:52] whom he raised from the dead
[1:12:55] there they made a Hymn of supper and
[1:12:58] Martha served but lassus was one of them
[1:13:01] that that sat at the table with him
[1:13:04] and then took Mary a pound of ointment
[1:13:07] of spagnard and very costly and Anointed
[1:13:11] with the feet of Jesus and wiped his
[1:13:14] wiped his feet with her hair and and the
[1:13:17] and the house was filled with the odor
[1:13:20] of the ointment
[1:13:21] and then set one of the disciples Judas
[1:13:24] is a carrot
[1:13:26] Simon's son which should betray him why
[1:13:30] was not this ointment sold for 300 Pence
[1:13:34] and given to the poor
[1:13:39] Hallelujah
[1:13:42] there's always one of them
[1:13:46] this say he because he cared not for the
[1:13:49] poor
[1:13:50] because he was a thief
[1:13:54] and had the bag and bear what was put
[1:13:58] therein
[1:14:00] then Jesus said let her alone
[1:14:03] against the day of my burying
[1:14:07] has she kept this
[1:14:09] for the poor always ye have with you but
[1:14:15] me you have not always
[1:14:19] pretty powerful
[1:14:22] much people of the Jews therefore knew
[1:14:25] that he was there
[1:14:27] and they came not for Jesus's sake only
[1:14:31] but that they might see Lazarus also
[1:14:34] whom he had raised from the dead
[1:14:37] but the chief priest notice these words
[1:14:41] but the chief priest consulted that they
[1:14:44] might put Lazarus
[1:14:46] also to death
[1:14:49] what a stupid bunch
[1:14:54] you know this probably caused great fear
[1:14:56] to come on Lazarus
[1:14:59] oh they're going to put me to death
[1:15:01] I was just there a couple days ago
[1:15:04] not such a bad place
[1:15:06] for a Christian it's not no bad place we
[1:15:12] Satan can't touch us no more we can
[1:15:13] never get no more sick
[1:15:20] because that by reason that maybe the
[1:15:22] Jews went away
[1:15:25] and believe Jesus
[1:15:27] so they didn't believe in that
[1:15:28] denominational nonsense anymore
[1:15:32] they can't do what they say they can do
[1:15:34] but this Jesus can raise people to life
[1:15:38] he can not only feed five thousand
[1:15:42] he could not only heal the sick
[1:15:45] but he purposely went away from his best
[1:15:49] friend
[1:15:50] and let him die are you with me now
[1:15:52] I knew it was everything and he said
[1:15:54] he's only asleep
[1:15:57] but I'm going to go wake him
[1:15:59] because I am the resurrection and I am
[1:16:02] the life
[1:16:06] I like that don't you
[1:16:08] now you say well brother Ron but you
[1:16:10] know you've only pointed out a couple of
[1:16:12] examples of of a garment change well
[1:16:15] let's just talk about our this fleshly
[1:16:17] garment just for a few moments if you'll
[1:16:19] remember in Melchizedek when he came to
[1:16:21] Abraham and Sarah
[1:16:23] being a hundred years old and 90 years
[1:16:25] old they could not have children
[1:16:27] though that the promise was was there
[1:16:30] that he would have a child through Sarah
[1:16:32] and it was given by God
[1:16:35] but in that garment they couldn't
[1:16:37] produce that child
[1:16:40] catch that in that garment they couldn't
[1:16:43] produce a child
[1:16:45] but God was going to give them a garment
[1:16:48] change
[1:16:51] and and we through the Seven Seals it is
[1:16:54] caught because listen theologians for
[1:16:58] thousands of years and missed it
[1:17:00] and I've even asked I've even asked
[1:17:03] different theologians well what was the
[1:17:04] great mystery of of of Genesis with
[1:17:08] Abraham and Sarah
[1:17:10] and you know they'll
[1:17:13] they'll they'll they'll talk about you
[1:17:15] know them old people having
[1:17:17] a child
[1:17:22] but the mystery of it was
[1:17:25] that they God changed their body
[1:17:31] God changed their body and if you
[1:17:33] remember he changes their name which
[1:17:36] changes their nature
[1:17:38] and for you to produce the word he's got
[1:17:41] to change your nature
[1:17:44] because he can't have you who you was
[1:17:49] and remember God don't look at who you
[1:17:52] was
[1:17:53] he looks at what you're going to be
[1:17:56] [Applause]
[1:17:58] as I preached to you the other day God
[1:18:00] didn't come down and talk to job on the
[1:18:02] element of where he was he presented him
[1:18:05] where he was before the foundation of
[1:18:07] the world and then presented him who he
[1:18:09] was going to be
[1:18:12] so God don't look at your physical
[1:18:14] friend
[1:18:16] and your failures and your mistakes he
[1:18:19] looks through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:18:21] and she's
[1:18:24] your potentials of what you are going to
[1:18:27] be
[1:18:30] are you with me now now now notice now
[1:18:34] notice when the king when they go down
[1:18:36] to the Heathen King they get out of the
[1:18:39] will of God as long as they stay in that
[1:18:42] place where God has given them there
[1:18:44] everything's going to be provided but
[1:18:46] let a little pressure come and they move
[1:18:48] down to where amelage the king is and
[1:18:51] I'm gonna spend long here
[1:18:53] but can you really through your common
[1:18:55] sense
[1:18:57] see
[1:18:59] Sarah
[1:19:00] an old woman
[1:19:02] and all of the women of the of his
[1:19:05] Nation it was a vast Empire huge Empire
[1:19:09] and he picks an old woman to be his wife
[1:19:13] I don't think so
[1:19:16] brother man said she was the most
[1:19:18] beautiful woman on the earth
[1:19:20] this is when God does a job he does it
[1:19:22] really well
[1:19:25] I I don't know what the neighbors talked
[1:19:27] about the day
[1:19:29] today what is
[1:19:31] and you said we're brother on I never
[1:19:32] heard it put like this well just stick
[1:19:34] around you're going to see it
[1:19:36] because God's going to change some
[1:19:38] bodies around here
[1:19:46] well brother Ron I don't believe it well
[1:19:48] it's okay
[1:19:50] you're not going to change my mind on
[1:19:52] the situation
[1:19:55] can you imagine living next door to
[1:19:57] Abraham
[1:19:59] and Abraham goes in one night and he's
[1:20:01] got his got his Cane and he's just
[1:20:04] struggling his way in and Sarah comes
[1:20:07] off of the porch and she's just
[1:20:09] struggling we're going to have a child
[1:20:12] we're going to have a child
[1:20:14] maybe the last words in the tent we're
[1:20:16] going to have a child
[1:20:18] ammo folkies
[1:20:22] but if you'd have been standing at your
[1:20:24] picket fence the next morning
[1:20:36] it's going to be kind of like your
[1:20:38] neighbors that they don't want nothing
[1:20:40] to do with the message they think it's
[1:20:41] just a corner they think it's this or
[1:20:43] that well they may be standing looking
[1:20:45] over the picket fence the next morning
[1:20:49] on the change day
[1:20:51] and you walked into your house know how
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:20:58] gray-headed
[1:21:00] out of shape
[1:21:02] I wouldn't Point At You
[1:21:05] and the next morning you walk out
[1:21:09] and you look about like you did at 20
[1:21:12] years old
[1:21:16] you'd have wished you to believe the
[1:21:18] message
[1:21:30] now
[1:21:31] and say well brother on that was Abraham
[1:21:33] and Sarah that's an old story well I've
[1:21:36] just read to you about
[1:21:38] Jesus and and Lazarus
[1:21:40] and when Lazarus came out of the grave
[1:21:43] and then when Jesus
[1:21:45] he goes in and he's beaten like no other
[1:21:47] human being that's ever been beaten
[1:21:50] he's wrapped incredible scars on him
[1:21:55] and and those disciples saw him and and
[1:21:58] they and they put the the robe on him
[1:22:00] and they put him in the Tomb
[1:22:03] but when he comes back
[1:22:05] out of that tomb before corruption could
[1:22:08] set in
[1:22:10] God's Great in details before corruption
[1:22:13] could set in and if you remember Jesus
[1:22:16] has asked these girls
[1:22:19] come anoint my body
[1:22:21] and they do that in a certain hour that
[1:22:24] they do they come to anoint that body
[1:22:26] and Jesus knew I got to have some
[1:22:29] witnesses
[1:22:32] I gotta have some witnesses at the tomb
[1:22:35] when I get up they need to see that I'm
[1:22:38] gone
[1:22:41] and so when
[1:22:43] when the they come
[1:22:46] and and Mary is standing there married
[1:22:50] that had been possessed with demons
[1:22:53] listen I think it's incredible that God
[1:22:56] uses her as a witness of all of the
[1:22:59] religious people he has her
[1:23:02] to be a witness of his resurrection
[1:23:06] and Jesus is countenance His Garment is
[1:23:10] so changed until she doesn't recognize
[1:23:14] him in that condition
[1:23:20] and he calls her by name
[1:23:23] and when he calls her by name she
[1:23:25] recognizes him by his voice
[1:23:29] now that's not the only occurrence
[1:23:32] two men on the are on the road to Emmaus
[1:23:35] they're discouraged a lot of things have
[1:23:37] happened but they're on the road to
[1:23:39] Emmaus and they're very discouraged by
[1:23:42] the things that have happened the
[1:23:43] Messiah that they have believed for has
[1:23:46] been took to jury has been
[1:23:49] condemned to die and they beat him like
[1:23:52] no other human being and now he's is the
[1:23:56] scripture said cursed is the man that
[1:23:58] hangeth on a tree and these allowed
[1:24:00] himself
[1:24:01] to be hung on a tree
[1:24:04] and thornsby and his brow and to be hung
[1:24:09] naked
[1:24:11] and then while there he forgives them
[1:24:17] because remember these men aren't born
[1:24:19] again
[1:24:21] and they've got hatred in their heart
[1:24:24] they got extreme prejudice in their
[1:24:26] heart
[1:24:27] and listen they need a garment change
[1:24:30] but Jesus forgives them because they
[1:24:34] know not what they do
[1:24:38] listen it was his purpose to come to the
[1:24:41] Earth to die
[1:24:43] that was his mission
[1:24:46] he'll save deliver but Jesus is first
[1:24:51] coming was to die for me and you
[1:24:55] because me and you were born under sin
[1:24:58] under Adam
[1:25:01] when God told them don't touch that tree
[1:25:04] when they touch that tree they found
[1:25:07] themselves naked
[1:25:09] and now what they did God would come
[1:25:12] every day to them but now they put
[1:25:14] clothes on themselves
[1:25:16] and they put an apparel on them hiding
[1:25:19] their nakedness that won't work with God
[1:25:22] just any kind of religion won't work
[1:25:24] with God
[1:25:27] God came through the garden
[1:25:31] may we say he came running through the
[1:25:34] garden
[1:25:35] them animal Where Art Thou
[1:25:40] man always hides
[1:25:42] when he's in sin
[1:25:45] many people want forgiveness after they
[1:25:48] got caught
[1:25:50] or they feel bad after they got caught
[1:25:54] but let me just say this to you God came
[1:25:58] to them he had a purpose for Adam and
[1:26:00] Eve
[1:26:03] and Adam had placed his seed on the
[1:26:05] inside of her so God couldn't kill her
[1:26:07] either
[1:26:09] now remember
[1:26:10] God clothed them
[1:26:16] now let me just say this to you those
[1:26:18] fig leaves wouldn't work
[1:26:22] those fig leaves wouldn't work
[1:26:24] that wouldn't cover sin it would take
[1:26:27] blood to cover your sins
[1:26:31] so God took skins of of animals and
[1:26:35] wrapped around them
[1:26:37] and then the rapping he gave them a new
[1:26:40] apparel or a new garment to wear out
[1:26:44] let me just say down through time men
[1:26:46] have always come to a spot to reject
[1:26:50] God's apparel
[1:26:53] to reject God's message they rejected
[1:26:55] Noah they rejected Moses
[1:26:59] they rejected Elijah they rejected Jesus
[1:27:04] they're those religious people was in
[1:27:06] their garments
[1:27:08] and Jesus looked at their garments as
[1:27:10] filthy rats
[1:27:12] why did sepulchers
[1:27:15] call them devils
[1:27:19] their garment wasn't good enough
[1:27:22] no wonder they hated Jesus because here
[1:27:25] he had prostitutes
[1:27:27] Tax Collectors doctors
[1:27:31] he had people that was with him that
[1:27:33] they were disdained in society
[1:27:37] and Jesus called it his church
[1:27:41] when Jesus came to Legion and he cast
[1:27:45] off His Garment
[1:27:47] and those demons left and they actually
[1:27:50] negotiated with Jesus send us somewhere
[1:27:54] did thou cometh to torment us before our
[1:27:58] time
[1:27:59] they knew that Jesus
[1:28:01] listen those demons recognize who he was
[1:28:07] and there was those priests that
[1:28:09] couldn't recognize standing in their
[1:28:12] garments that they'd had for hundreds of
[1:28:14] years
[1:28:15] they're making fun call him a devil but
[1:28:19] those demons recognize who he was
[1:28:25] now watch him
[1:28:27] they negotiated
[1:28:29] to go live in pigs
[1:28:34] you talking about Jewish Society
[1:28:37] hating pigs
[1:28:39] but these demons wanted to go live in
[1:28:41] those picks
[1:28:43] now what you just think about this just
[1:28:44] for a moment
[1:28:45] those pigs refused to live
[1:28:50] with them demons
[1:28:52] those pigs had more sense than a lot of
[1:28:54] people
[1:28:58] and they cast themselves half of a cliff
[1:29:02] not what did the leaders of the the city
[1:29:05] do
[1:29:06] they come out and they should have
[1:29:08] rejoiced
[1:29:09] you set a man free
[1:29:11] and he can go home and live with his
[1:29:13] family listen if you guys wanted to come
[1:29:15] to church come to church your amens are
[1:29:17] wonderful
[1:29:20] I preached for 25 minutes waiting on you
[1:29:22] to get with me
[1:29:27] but listen let me just say this to you
[1:29:30] when Jesus was standing there he had
[1:29:33] delivered a man
[1:29:37] listen when you come to service how
[1:29:39] important is a service
[1:29:42] how important is a moment with Jesus
[1:29:45] I just shared this with a few this week
[1:29:49] when I was a little boy when there was a
[1:29:51] special service going on
[1:29:53] you know that's why I think Life
[1:29:55] Ministry is so important
[1:29:57] if I could sit on the front row I wanted
[1:29:59] to feel what that preacher's feeling if
[1:30:01] there's a miracle happened I wanted to
[1:30:03] see it it was a move of God I wanted to
[1:30:05] be a part of it
[1:30:06] can you imagine being real close to
[1:30:09] Jesus I wouldn't want it to be I'm sorry
[1:30:11] I wouldn't want to be on the back road
[1:30:13] looking at everybody else's head and who
[1:30:14] goes to the bathroom and what child's
[1:30:16] crying and who ain't here what you got
[1:30:19] on
[1:30:24] sorry
[1:30:26] brother on this is where I sit because I
[1:30:28] got to go to the bathroom so much
[1:30:31] well I just wonder if you
[1:30:34] get a baseball ticket at the top of the
[1:30:36] stadium
[1:30:42] it's good anyway
[1:30:53] and not only goes for here it goes for
[1:30:54] everybody in the world
[1:30:57] helping pastors right there
[1:31:03] if I was in brother Brown I was meeting
[1:31:04] I
[1:31:06] I'd want to sit as close as I could sit
[1:31:10] I want to be right there where is that
[1:31:13] when I was a young convert
[1:31:15] sister Kanye and I went to a church near
[1:31:18] Hickory
[1:31:19] I was young convert we're just about
[1:31:21] just a couple of months married
[1:31:24] and I still need more of Jesus
[1:31:27] at that point
[1:31:34] when I go in it's been this way forever
[1:31:36] I go in they think I'm a grown man they
[1:31:39] think she's a child
[1:31:42] they send her to the Sunday school class
[1:31:48] and I walk in and
[1:31:50] I get a seat about where you're at Isaac
[1:31:54] and I'm sitting there and I'm telling
[1:31:56] this for a reason you used to sit back
[1:31:58] there but something moved you here
[1:32:02] and so
[1:32:04] I'm sitting there
[1:32:07] and I've heard about this Ed biscal
[1:32:10] and I'd heard him in 1978 describe
[1:32:13] experiences with with William Branham
[1:32:16] and I remember what that was all about
[1:32:17] and how much I enjoyed that well I'm
[1:32:20] thinking brother Ed's an older man and
[1:32:22] you know he comes walking on he's
[1:32:24] bouncing across the platform
[1:32:27] he looks like a boy
[1:32:29] even even at that age and he he comes
[1:32:32] and he preaches on the the breach
[1:32:36] and there had to come there had to come
[1:32:39] a time between the church ages where God
[1:32:41] wouldn't deal with the church ages
[1:32:43] anymore but he's going to deal with the
[1:32:44] bride of Jesus Christ and it was more
[1:32:47] than a man that could do that and he's
[1:32:49] preaching and he's preaching right to me
[1:32:53] and I'm thinking I'm the only one in the
[1:32:56] church
[1:32:57] well I walk out of that service feeling
[1:32:59] like I'm standing on cloud nine I'm just
[1:33:02] glad everybody else that came to church
[1:33:04] to be with me while I was having a
[1:33:06] moment
[1:33:09] are you with me and so I was just
[1:33:12] sitting there I was just absorbing
[1:33:14] everything
[1:33:15] and I wanted to get
[1:33:17] what he was saying
[1:33:20] because even in my early I wanted to
[1:33:24] catch what did God deal with this
[1:33:27] preacher for weeks
[1:33:30] to inspire him to preach to me
[1:33:34] what I need because God can speak to 300
[1:33:37] 500 people and talk to you on a level
[1:33:41] maybe one sentence one paragraph will
[1:33:44] come right to you and deal with you
[1:33:49] that's our God
[1:33:50] [Applause]
[1:34:00] how important is that brother Ron
[1:34:03] a few weeks ago
[1:34:05] I was preaching here
[1:34:08] and there was somebody that was being
[1:34:10] very resistant
[1:34:12] to the word
[1:34:15] and as they were being very resistant to
[1:34:17] the word
[1:34:18] I picked it up
[1:34:21] and I actually cautioned this audience
[1:34:26] you know
[1:34:27] stick with me
[1:34:29] don't resist it don't resist it
[1:34:33] and the resistance just went on and went
[1:34:36] on and went on
[1:34:38] now the fortune of God's allowed me to
[1:34:41] be a gentleman I didn't call their name
[1:34:48] but sometimes we think well I can resist
[1:34:50] and get by with it
[1:34:54] what if you'd have resisted with Jesus
[1:34:58] now what will that do for you brother
[1:35:00] Ron I will realize that that girl is not
[1:35:03] a believer
[1:35:05] and so
[1:35:07] I realized that she's taken a stance
[1:35:09] against the word of God
[1:35:12] and her one service
[1:35:14] and her spirit and attitude sprung out
[1:35:17] against it you said well brother Ron I
[1:35:19] can get through a service and I can get
[1:35:21] to it and I I just I don't believe it
[1:35:25] but when you may not believe it
[1:35:28] but if you will set with the right
[1:35:30] attitude one day God might open your
[1:35:32] heart
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:45] laughs
[1:35:47] I'm going to need a scriptural principle
[1:35:49] for that Jesus was at his Ascension
[1:35:52] 500 people was there
[1:35:54] they were seeing him in that body
[1:35:57] the changed garment
[1:36:00] 500 people was there and Jesus asked
[1:36:03] them to do the further part to go to the
[1:36:06] upper room
[1:36:08] and there you'll be endued with power
[1:36:10] from on high
[1:36:12] now remember he'd already told him in
[1:36:14] previous scripture I got to go away
[1:36:17] it's actually expedient that I go away
[1:36:21] but I'm going to send the comforter and
[1:36:23] he's going to come and live inside of
[1:36:25] you
[1:36:26] Peter because you got to get rid of your
[1:36:28] temper
[1:36:30] you are the one that cut the ear off I
[1:36:32] got to change that
[1:36:34] I can't have the woman at the well being
[1:36:36] the same woman anymore
[1:36:39] even Mary that birth Jesus Christ
[1:36:43] you got to go to the upper room
[1:36:48] listen to it about who your name is that
[1:36:51] doesn't matter whatsoever you got to be
[1:36:53] born again
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:56] now Jesus tells in the scriptures
[1:36:59] he said there was a king
[1:37:01] and this King had a son that was going
[1:37:04] to be married
[1:37:06] and he and he sent out servants to go
[1:37:09] get people to come
[1:37:12] and people gave excuses
[1:37:15] Jesus tell him more than just a story
[1:37:17] here
[1:37:18] people are going to have choices in life
[1:37:20] and they're going to take choices that
[1:37:22] are temporary over the Eternal Word
[1:37:27] don't take a temporary job or temporary
[1:37:30] wrong relationship over an eternal word
[1:37:33] of God
[1:37:36] don't take a temporary feeling
[1:37:40] that's why we ask you to pray before you
[1:37:43] come to church why pray because we all
[1:37:45] get the wrong Spirit on us
[1:37:52] you don't mean to but you get the wrong
[1:37:54] spirit
[1:37:55] something just gets a hold of you and
[1:37:57] you get the wrong attitude
[1:38:02] you're good people
[1:38:04] as a pastor I gotta I gotta look past
[1:38:07] your attitude I gotta look past your
[1:38:09] disposition I gotta look past a lot of
[1:38:11] things because you're going to have bad
[1:38:12] days
[1:38:15] some of you are obviously going to have
[1:38:17] some bad nights because you're going to
[1:38:19] walk in here scrunch down
[1:38:31] some of you obviously get incredible
[1:38:33] texts from somebody
[1:38:36] listen when I'm using my phone I'm
[1:38:38] checking my sugar
[1:38:40] and yeah sometimes I'm not sweet enough
[1:38:43] and sometimes I'm way too sweet
[1:38:48] but there's nothing on that phone more
[1:38:51] important than what God's getting ready
[1:38:52] to say to us
[1:39:10] what happens in the upper room
[1:39:13] 380 people had something better to do
[1:39:18] you know we'll be standing there at the
[1:39:19] Judgment listen to 380 people that had
[1:39:22] the opportunity
[1:39:23] to go to the upper room
[1:39:26] and they missed
[1:39:29] their experience of deity coming in
[1:39:32] human flesh
[1:39:35] they might have even missed Peter
[1:39:37] preaching the inauguration sermon
[1:39:41] this Jesus whom you crucified God has
[1:39:45] made him Lord and Christ
[1:39:49] many people that that hadn't had privy
[1:39:52] to it they began to respond what shall
[1:39:56] we do to be saved we wasn't in the upper
[1:39:59] room but can we have what you got and he
[1:40:02] said repent every one of you
[1:40:08] repent every one of you don't don't sign
[1:40:10] your name on a book repent every one of
[1:40:13] you
[1:40:14] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:40:17] Jesus Christ for the remission of of
[1:40:19] your sins
[1:40:21] and you shall re you shall receive the
[1:40:23] gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise
[1:40:26] is unto you and to your children as many
[1:40:30] as are far off as many as the Lord Our
[1:40:32] God shall call
[1:40:34] God
[1:40:41] how many has ever been sick
[1:40:43] and so happened that night we had the
[1:40:45] phenomenal service
[1:40:47] and then you hear somebody say
[1:40:49] most greatest service I've ever been in
[1:40:51] my life
[1:40:53] and then they try to explain it to you
[1:40:55] you can't feel what they're talking
[1:40:57] about
[1:41:01] now
[1:41:03] those 380 heard what happened
[1:41:07] there's not a good enough excuse
[1:41:10] anywhere
[1:41:13] to miss the upper room
[1:41:16] now I want to say this to you don't come
[1:41:19] here for decades and miss your personal
[1:41:22] experience with Jesus Christ
[1:41:28] right don't miss your garment change
[1:41:32] I I'm trying to bring this very
[1:41:34] Elementary to you today
[1:41:36] Jesus also tells another parable
[1:41:40] about the upper going to the to the
[1:41:42] wedding supper
[1:41:44] and if you're invited the reason there
[1:41:47] are robes at the wedding supper brother
[1:41:49] Brown points this out
[1:41:51] it was according to Oriental Customs
[1:41:53] that everybody at the wedding would get
[1:41:56] the same rope
[1:41:59] rich or poor
[1:42:03] whether you was in The Who's Who whether
[1:42:06] your name King priest or even nomad
[1:42:12] all got the same garment
[1:42:15] nobody's better than anybody else
[1:42:21] it takes the same blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:24] for every one of us
[1:42:28] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:42:30] the glory of God so we all need the
[1:42:34] blood we all need the new birth
[1:42:41] foreign
[1:42:46] and the Garment is the Holy Ghost
[1:42:50] because in your natural being
[1:42:54] just being justified you'll only be a
[1:42:57] carnal believer
[1:43:00] you'll only be a carnal believer
[1:43:03] has a carnal believer look at it
[1:43:06] too long a service
[1:43:09] we got dinner pot roast
[1:43:16] it's a sunny day we could have a picnic
[1:43:19] rains over we could have a picnic
[1:43:23] what's more important than this
[1:43:28] it's carnal believer you'll think the
[1:43:30] preachers preaching right at you every
[1:43:32] service
[1:43:33] well he is always when he points his
[1:43:35] finger
[1:43:38] when he points that finger he's a little
[1:43:40] short guy but when he points that thing
[1:43:42] have you noticed he's always pointing at
[1:43:44] me
[1:43:46] have you noticed he avoids me don't
[1:43:48] shake my hand if you notice I don't
[1:43:50] check a lot of people's head
[1:43:53] there's a reason we don't have time for
[1:43:55] that today
[1:43:57] I have zero immunity in my bloodstream I
[1:44:00] try to stay away from sickness
[1:44:02] that's why I tell you tell to turn to
[1:44:04] your neighbor say brother Ron loves you
[1:44:08] I hope you do that
[1:44:12] then I hope you believe it
[1:44:17] then sanctified
[1:44:19] you clean out you clean out you clean up
[1:44:22] you clean out you get all the cleanness
[1:44:24] out of your life and you get all the sin
[1:44:26] out of your life and you put away this
[1:44:28] you put away that and you put away that
[1:44:29] but if you live in that condition you'll
[1:44:31] always be a legalist
[1:44:36] you'll always be illegal as well that
[1:44:38] one ain't doing this and that ain't
[1:44:39] doing that and that ain't doing that and
[1:44:40] that ain't doing that nothing ain't
[1:44:42] doing that and that ain't doing nothing
[1:44:43] ain't doing nothing ain't doing nothing
[1:44:45] ain't doing nothing you're getting it I
[1:44:47] ain't doing that now and they don't have
[1:44:48] nothing
[1:44:50] I want to become it's like a cactus
[1:44:56] and you become like a cactus where you
[1:44:59] get fussy and Punchy all the time and
[1:45:01] you can't live good enough for God
[1:45:03] you're all the time reading 14 different
[1:45:05] chapters in the Bible I gotta do better
[1:45:08] I gotta do better I gotta fast I can't
[1:45:10] eat donuts I can't
[1:45:14] but if you can ever get full of the Holy
[1:45:16] Ghost
[1:45:21] you can ever get full of God
[1:45:23] where you're going to change this on me
[1:45:27] where you put on a new robe
[1:45:30] word ain't no longer you living and you
[1:45:33] trying to live but God living on the
[1:45:35] inside of you
[1:45:38] Hallelujah
[1:45:50] Hallelujah
[1:45:54] then when you get the Holy Ghost Just
[1:45:56] Breathe
[1:45:57] just relax
[1:45:59] just lay in the presence of the sun just
[1:46:02] eat the word let it live
[1:46:07] [Applause]
[1:46:11] the Holy Ghost is a seal God says
[1:46:16] God says I could live inside of that
[1:46:19] you're no longer a drunk you're no
[1:46:21] longer a lot of things but I can live on
[1:46:23] the inside of that
[1:46:26] God says
[1:46:28] I approve
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:40] now
[1:46:42] we've had some weddings here
[1:46:45] and I've said this before but I want to
[1:46:46] say it again
[1:46:48] and there's a reason why that I'm
[1:46:49] preaching this this sermon
[1:46:55] two events I want to tell you
[1:46:59] you remember when we first started this
[1:47:01] journey and and it was so bleak
[1:47:06] I dreamed that we went to a meeting
[1:47:09] and we had a specific seat now you're
[1:47:11] going to know why I said certain things
[1:47:14] and we had a specific seats that we set
[1:47:17] we didn't know who the speaker was going
[1:47:18] to be
[1:47:21] but brother Brennan was a speaker
[1:47:28] you have to forgive me it's in my nature
[1:47:31] if I go to an auction I look for things
[1:47:34] that are worth so much more than what
[1:47:37] they're going to be valued for
[1:47:40] foreign
[1:47:41] I hope to live long enough these guys
[1:47:44] don't have to have an auction but but I
[1:47:46] bought a lot of stuff that's worth
[1:47:47] incredible value I bought some stuff
[1:47:49] that's junk
[1:47:54] and sister Connie expressed to me the
[1:47:56] other day she said now
[1:47:57] if I you know I I told her I said I try
[1:48:00] to be so good she said well if I could
[1:48:01] change anything
[1:48:03] I get you to quit auctioning
[1:48:05] well that's kind of like quit breathing
[1:48:10] because you know I see something inside
[1:48:12] of you when you walk in this building
[1:48:20] um
[1:48:22] if I can take a cabin
[1:48:24] and make a mansion out of it
[1:48:29] not that the cabin wasn't good enough we
[1:48:32] loved it but there was something on the
[1:48:34] inside of me
[1:48:36] I'd walk out and say I'm going to build
[1:48:38] a I'm going to build a room Terry I want
[1:48:41] the ceiling to be 25
[1:48:43] feet high
[1:48:46] and brother Ray said this is how we can
[1:48:48] get it done
[1:48:50] yeah
[1:48:51] and so when I walk into my living room I
[1:48:54] ceilings 25 feet high I didn't need it
[1:48:56] that way but that was on the inside of
[1:48:59] me
[1:49:00] and then it would be attached to my
[1:49:02] office I'm taking your tour through my
[1:49:04] house
[1:49:05] it'd be attached to my office man cave
[1:49:11] Connie could put her stuff here that's
[1:49:14] mine
[1:49:19] my goodies are in there some of you been
[1:49:22] there you've seen my goodies you like
[1:49:24] you like them yeah I got paintings in
[1:49:27] there
[1:49:28] and I I I'm not going to tell the world
[1:49:30] everything but I'd like to buy paintings
[1:49:33] that are worth a certain value and
[1:49:34] they're the original Edition and they're
[1:49:37] signed either on the front or on the
[1:49:38] back and in a few years they're worth
[1:49:41] multiple times what they're worth and
[1:49:43] then I get letters where you sell this
[1:49:45] painting will you sell this painting
[1:49:47] we'll give you four times what it's
[1:49:49] worth
[1:49:51] no I'm not going to give the paintings
[1:49:53] that you gave to me back to you
[1:49:56] unless you really need it
[1:49:58] so I see value
[1:50:01] who put that inside of me
[1:50:05] and God looks at you
[1:50:07] you're a mess
[1:50:09] Jay
[1:50:11] you are a stinking mess
[1:50:15] steak and mess
[1:50:17] but God rich in Mercy sees the prince
[1:50:23] like was in your grandfather
[1:50:29] and I could see that you won't be a
[1:50:33] little boy forever or a big boy forever
[1:50:36] but you'll be a man
[1:50:37] you'll be a pillar of the church
[1:50:40] you'll get a body change
[1:50:50] are you with me
[1:50:53] now let me just say this you a guy that
[1:50:55] has that kind of vision never give up on
[1:50:57] you
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:05] he'll never give up on you
[1:51:08] Roman why didn't you give up on me I
[1:51:10] didn't see you how you were I see what
[1:51:12] you're going to be
[1:51:15] Hallelujah
[1:51:28] Hallelujah
[1:51:32] and listen if you fall and make mistakes
[1:51:35] and everybody in the neighborhood's
[1:51:36] talking about you
[1:51:38] if I saw the vision of your future
[1:51:41] I'll never throw a rock at you
[1:51:45] I'll never throw a rock at you why
[1:51:47] should I throw a rock at you when I know
[1:51:50] one of these days there's going to be a
[1:51:53] garment change
[1:51:58] thank you
[1:52:00] Hallelujah
[1:52:02] [Applause]
[1:52:12] I need a chair just for a real quick
[1:52:15] exhibit I'm not going to be much longer
[1:52:17] I just need a chair
[1:52:24] I gotta drive a point and it needs to be
[1:52:26] visual
[1:52:31] foreign
[1:52:32] [Applause]
[1:52:46] okay
[1:52:49] back in the olden days
[1:52:51] if you was in a legalist Church
[1:52:54] and you want to stay in church
[1:52:56] they'd set a chair out
[1:53:01] and you repent 14 different times I
[1:53:03] ain't gonna do that no more I ain't
[1:53:04] gonna do it no more but if you ain't got
[1:53:05] the Holy Ghost you're gonna keep doing
[1:53:06] it
[1:53:09] and then they tell you you can't come
[1:53:10] back to church no more you can't come
[1:53:12] back to church no more you can't come
[1:53:13] back to church no more well how are you
[1:53:15] going to help them
[1:53:28] don't give up on your kids
[1:53:32] preach with me now
[1:53:35] don't give up on your kids
[1:53:37] I'm not going to give up on them I'm
[1:53:39] going to tell you that I'm not giving up
[1:53:41] on him
[1:54:10] I have preached to you for a long time
[1:54:11] and told you
[1:54:12] don't come here expecting to get beat
[1:54:16] because God don't beat his wife
[1:54:20] a relationship that's always getting
[1:54:22] beat
[1:54:23] ain't a really good relationship
[1:54:27] if you're scared your husband is going
[1:54:28] to come home and whoop you it's not love
[1:54:31] and if you're living in a relationship
[1:54:33] pay attention here if you're living in a
[1:54:35] relationship where your husband is
[1:54:36] abuser or your wife
[1:54:39] naturally you ain't gonna go tell nobody
[1:54:42] your wife beats me up all the time
[1:54:46] ain't nobody going to work and said my
[1:54:48] wife beat me up last night
[1:54:51] it takes care of that big bad boy image
[1:55:01] none of us want to walk into this church
[1:55:05] oh God I'm going to get beat all over
[1:55:08] the place no no no it's not
[1:55:11] but I'm going to motivate you you don't
[1:55:13] have to stay where you're at
[1:55:16] you don't have to stay there
[1:55:17] you can have a personal Revival inside
[1:55:19] of your heart
[1:55:21] that guy right there lived with me for a
[1:55:23] year and a lot of dirt on him
[1:55:26] but I knew if I could get him close
[1:55:27] enough to the water
[1:55:30] he'd get a bath
[1:55:35] [Applause]
[1:55:36] that's what some people need a good bath
[1:55:38] you can smell them 14 feet away they
[1:55:40] need a bath
[1:55:49] how do I drop the hit that they need a
[1:55:51] bath give them a bar of soap for their
[1:55:53] birthday
[1:55:58] they stink real bad get them a whole
[1:56:00] bottle of Dawn dishwashing detergent
[1:56:02] listen if you get that next week for
[1:56:05] your birthday don't blame me
[1:56:09] ah
[1:56:24] now God's going to give you a robe
[1:56:28] before I go there
[1:56:30] how far does your love extend
[1:56:32] brother Ron to the Unseen audience
[1:56:37] to the Unseen audience now you want that
[1:56:40] to be made personal
[1:56:42] what about brother Donny's family that's
[1:56:44] in Germany
[1:56:45] his children that's in Germany
[1:56:50] whether you know this or believe this
[1:56:52] I pray for his children
[1:56:56] and I've never seen them I've never seen
[1:56:59] a picture of them
[1:57:02] but because of who he is
[1:57:05] and who his daddy was
[1:57:08] they have the potential to be real
[1:57:10] believers
[1:57:11] so brother Donnie I want to tell you
[1:57:13] this I never give up on them either you
[1:57:16] never heard that from me but there you
[1:57:17] are
[1:57:20] foreign
[1:57:32] can you give me just a few more minutes
[1:57:37] brother Brown was at a spot to where he
[1:57:38] felt like he was going to give up his
[1:57:40] wife and died
[1:57:41] his baby had died
[1:57:46] watch his baby go in such pain it would
[1:57:48] go cross-eyed and it was then the devil
[1:57:52] would come to him
[1:57:54] Satan always comes in really tough spots
[1:57:57] God don't love you God don't care for
[1:58:00] you
[1:58:02] he was a man
[1:58:05] he actually tried to commit suicide
[1:58:07] twice
[1:58:10] he's a tough spot
[1:58:13] he was down praying
[1:58:15] it was just honest with us he was down
[1:58:17] praying he said I felt like I was going
[1:58:19] to give up and paraphrase here just for
[1:58:21] a little bit
[1:58:22] why are you going to do that brother on
[1:58:23] I have double vision so bad I can't read
[1:58:25] so that's where I'm at
[1:58:27] so so brother Branham was down praying
[1:58:31] and when he was down praying
[1:58:33] he was at a spot to where
[1:58:35] he had battled the devil
[1:58:38] to where he felt like I'm gonna give up
[1:58:41] I can't hold on
[1:58:43] so God knows what to give you at the
[1:58:45] right time
[1:58:46] and I finish with this
[1:58:52] and when
[1:58:55] he was praying he went to sleep
[1:58:58] I don't know if you've ever did that but
[1:58:59] I did that
[1:59:01] brother Brown dreams he's a prophet so
[1:59:04] his dream and his vision operates like
[1:59:08] sometimes it's in symbol form
[1:59:11] and he's walking down a path I'm not
[1:59:12] going to give you the whole dream but
[1:59:14] he's walking down the path and goes by
[1:59:15] an old broken will
[1:59:18] and he walks and he walks past a lady a
[1:59:21] young lady standing there beauty of her
[1:59:23] youth
[1:59:24] just a beautiful girl
[1:59:27] and he actually greets her hello lady
[1:59:30] he greets her and she says hello Daddy
[1:59:36] that girl had had a change of garment
[1:59:44] interchange of garment she'd winners
[1:59:46] from a cross-eyed baby
[1:59:49] to a lady
[1:59:51] standing
[1:59:53] in a body that would never feel sickness
[1:59:56] ever again
[1:59:58] but here's what I want to drop to you
[2:00:00] the moment that you step from this body
[2:00:03] to that body
[2:00:05] you know everything
[2:00:09] you know who's your enemy and who's not
[2:00:12] you know God's plan for you
[2:00:15] notice what she does she talks to her
[2:00:17] him
[2:00:18] in that Eternal realm it says on Earth I
[2:00:22] was your baby Sharon Rose
[2:00:25] he needed to hear that
[2:00:30] and she begins to talk to him in in a
[2:00:33] different quote brother Branham actually
[2:00:34] says that she said this is what you
[2:00:37] taught
[2:00:40] in your ministry this is what you taught
[2:00:44] two years old she never heard any
[2:00:47] sermons
[2:00:50] that would deal with that but in that
[2:00:53] Realm
[2:00:55] she knew even things that he would
[2:00:57] preach in 1965.
[2:00:59] all right
[2:01:01] listen when my mom
[2:01:03] was laying there in that bed
[2:01:06] and you and I the night before God spoke
[2:01:09] to me get to your mom get to your mom we
[2:01:13] were sitting and letting out sister
[2:01:14] Nancy get to your mom
[2:01:16] and God spoke to me get to your mom we
[2:01:19] had Services the next evening which
[2:01:21] service is on Sunday get to your mom
[2:01:24] listen
[2:01:25] mom had had incredible conversation the
[2:01:29] night before she told Dad to go to
[2:01:31] service he needed it
[2:01:38] and so the next morning I go and on my
[2:01:41] way
[2:01:42] brother Tim Pruitt calls me
[2:01:45] and they tell they tell they'll get a
[2:01:47] call from the hospital she's dying get
[2:01:49] here as fast as you can
[2:01:51] brother Tim Pruitt reminds me of a dream
[2:01:55] that we were at a great convention and
[2:01:58] at that great convention brother Timothy
[2:02:01] Pruitt preaches I am the resurrection
[2:02:03] and the life
[2:02:05] then brother temp for it comes and he
[2:02:07] said we have a special guest brother Ron
[2:02:09] Spencer that's here
[2:02:11] and then he announces his title oh thou
[2:02:15] suffering stand and be healed
[2:02:19] my brother Tim calls me that morning and
[2:02:21] he says brother Ron your dream is
[2:02:23] getting ready to come to pass your mom's
[2:02:26] going to get up out of that body
[2:02:29] and she's going to get a brand new body
[2:02:31] this morning
[2:02:38] we walk into doctors meet us in the hall
[2:02:40] tell us the severity of the situation
[2:02:43] hard
[2:02:44] Heart's Not the word
[2:02:46] we walked in there's multitudes of
[2:02:49] people working on her
[2:02:52] and she talks to us like she's we're
[2:02:55] going to talk all day
[2:02:57] she's very coherent she's very much in
[2:02:59] control she's very much talking asking
[2:03:02] how the grandkids were asking how
[2:03:04] everybody else was and it told us how
[2:03:07] much she loved us the doctor came over
[2:03:09] to her and said she doesn't want us to
[2:03:11] do anything for her we can try to help
[2:03:14] her but she doesn't want us to do
[2:03:16] anything and and the doctor walked over
[2:03:19] and give her the report again and she
[2:03:22] said
[2:03:23] it's okay I'm ready to go
[2:03:28] and like a light switch
[2:03:30] she moved
[2:03:33] she moved from that body
[2:03:37] to a brand new body
[2:03:45] now
[2:03:47] I want to finish with this
[2:03:51] my mom's an old woman anymore
[2:03:54] my mom don't weigh 268 pounds there
[2:03:58] listen she was never ashamed of being
[2:04:00] overweight
[2:04:01] she could dance she could Shout
[2:04:04] she could praise the Lord
[2:04:07] she did it right here
[2:04:09] actually sitting right here
[2:04:13] she shouted
[2:04:14] she had bad news
[2:04:18] she'd been a cheerleader in her life she
[2:04:20] was a beautiful woman as a young child
[2:04:22] sure I'd say that about my mama but she
[2:04:24] was
[2:04:30] to her age
[2:04:32] I always like to look at pictures five
[2:04:34] years old 10 years old 20 years old 30
[2:04:37] years old
[2:04:39] you know you're always pleased to look
[2:04:41] at pictures
[2:04:42] you were 50 pounds heavier now look at
[2:04:44] you today
[2:04:48] you know I'm telling you truth
[2:04:51] and you go you compare one another how
[2:04:53] do I look different you know
[2:04:56] and then you know there was a time that
[2:04:58] you was redheaded and now you're
[2:04:59] gray-headed where did I start getting
[2:05:01] gray
[2:05:03] and you go through phases of Life yeah
[2:05:05] it'll happen to you too
[2:05:08] and you'll go through phases of Life
[2:05:10] there was a time that I was preaching to
[2:05:12] you younger than what you are now
[2:05:16] and so you you go through phases of life
[2:05:19] but when you come to the end this ain't
[2:05:22] the end
[2:05:26] this ain't the end
[2:05:28] and that's why Jesus said let not your
[2:05:31] heart be troubled
[2:05:32] you believe in God believe also in me
[2:05:36] I go to prepare you a house
[2:05:39] and it's not brick and mortar and Stone
[2:05:45] we could talk about going beyond the
[2:05:47] curtain of time
[2:05:49] and what did he see
[2:05:53] one night I had a dream and now I come
[2:05:55] to my complete close
[2:05:58] and I'm dreaming that
[2:06:00] I'm walking down the road with one of my
[2:06:02] precious friends as a minister
[2:06:05] much older
[2:06:09] always been kind of like a mentor to me
[2:06:11] like a father
[2:06:16] and I'm walking down the road with him
[2:06:19] very distinctive
[2:06:22] it's two angels walking with each of us
[2:06:25] and we're walking down a path
[2:06:28] and in this path we're having
[2:06:29] conversation about
[2:06:31] things that we're enjoying about the
[2:06:33] word
[2:06:35] we're enjoying one another's company
[2:06:37] and I remember I can remember what story
[2:06:40] it was telling me and I'm not going to
[2:06:41] tell that because you would know who who
[2:06:43] I'm talking about and I don't want it to
[2:06:45] to be told
[2:06:47] and so anyways telling me about a story
[2:06:51] and about a certain time
[2:06:53] brother Nathan he comes to a spot
[2:06:59] and the angel tells him
[2:07:01] it's time to change your clothes
[2:07:06] and I I stop and look at how he's
[2:07:08] dressed
[2:07:09] what he looks like
[2:07:12] and in just a moment
[2:07:15] he's got the most radiant clothes I've
[2:07:17] ever seen
[2:07:21] and he looks like a young man
[2:07:24] and I remember these words
[2:07:26] how do I look brother Ryan
[2:07:29] and the dream ends hugging
[2:07:32] one another
[2:07:36] you had two precious friends
[2:07:40] in your church
[2:07:43] and I walk on the platform
[2:07:47] and I step up on the platform and
[2:07:50] I walked past and I speak to one of them
[2:07:55] and I stand there and I said you know
[2:07:57] we're we're an audience sitting here
[2:07:58] together
[2:08:00] but will never be the same way that we
[2:08:02] are
[2:08:05] we have this service let's grab every
[2:08:07] bit of our this moment
[2:08:09] while the Lord's with us let's grab it
[2:08:11] and I begin to talk about even my
[2:08:13] situation I may not be able to speak to
[2:08:16] them ever again
[2:08:17] you never know we don't know the end of
[2:08:20] life circle I said but there's someone
[2:08:22] even sitting here
[2:08:24] that won't be here the next time that
[2:08:25] I'm here
[2:08:28] week that week
[2:08:31] just a few days
[2:08:32] the house explodes
[2:08:34] how it was Charlie
[2:08:38] 21 22 years old
[2:08:40] how is his wife
[2:08:42] about the same age
[2:08:45] and you think what a horrible tragedy
[2:08:47] but if you look at the human element you
[2:08:49] would think how horrible is that event
[2:08:52] to take place but he was sitting there
[2:08:54] and the Lord was letting us know given
[2:08:56] us Grace It won't always be like this
[2:09:00] but I've got a house for you
[2:09:03] and all you'll do is change clothes
[2:09:05] Charlie
[2:09:07] the explosion takes place and in seconds
[2:09:09] you're in a new body
[2:09:13] oh you can Relish in the in the horror
[2:09:16] of the
[2:09:18] look at it in God's eyes
[2:09:22] I got a house for you I've got a garment
[2:09:25] for you
[2:09:33] now it's your turn
[2:09:37] you remember when I came here and
[2:09:40] I told
[2:09:42] I told Brother William that's not here
[2:09:44] this morning I said William Jesus is
[2:09:46] coming to your house
[2:09:50] because I saw a vision that morning
[2:09:53] of Wesley who could not walk
[2:09:56] with a generational issue
[2:10:00] you see he was wearing one garment but
[2:10:02] he didn't have to stay there
[2:10:04] one service changed his life
[2:10:08] and the vision said go down and pick him
[2:10:10] up and I even asked the Lord God he
[2:10:12] won't let me pick him up he won't let
[2:10:14] nobody else pick him up how many of you
[2:10:16] remember that
[2:10:18] and I went down and picked him up
[2:10:20] and I walked back to the back of the
[2:10:23] building and then I walked back up and I
[2:10:25] gave him to William
[2:10:26] and prayed for him
[2:10:29] it wasn't instantaneous
[2:10:33] it was not instantaneous
[2:10:36] but they actually videoed him
[2:10:42] and when they videoed him what six
[2:10:45] months
[2:10:46] maybe a little bit longer that boy's
[2:10:49] running all over the house
[2:10:52] he needed a garment change
[2:10:56] now if you need any kind of illustration
[2:10:58] today
