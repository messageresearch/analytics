[14:05] Amen. We serve an awesome God, don't we?
[14:09] Amen. I'd like to do something a little
[14:10] different this morning. Maybe if you'll
[14:13] just play Battle Hymn of the Republic
[14:15] for me if you would. This morning, we
[14:18] know it's Memorial Day weekend here this
[14:21] this weekend. And I just want to read
[14:25] something here I put together.
[14:28] As we enter into Memorial Day weekend,
[14:30] let us take a moment as the b body of
[14:34] Christ to reflect on the true meaning of
[14:37] this national day. While many enjoy time
[14:40] with their family, warmth of summer,
[14:44] welldeserved rest, we are also called to
[14:46] remember Memorial Day is a sacred time
[14:49] to honor men and women who gave their
[14:52] lives as military service for our
[14:54] country.
[14:56] These brave individuals laid down their
[14:58] lives that we might have freedom.
[15:02] Freedom that allows us to gather openly
[15:04] in worship to speak our faith to serve
[15:08] our communities in
[15:10] love. In John 15:13, Jesus said,
[15:14] "Greater love hath no one than this, to
[15:19] lay down one's life for his friends."
[15:23] As believers, we recognize the power of
[15:26] sacrificial love most fully displayed in
[15:30] Jesus Christ. On Memorial Day, we are
[15:33] reminded that freedom is not free. We
[15:37] honor those who follow a path of
[15:40] selfless service, many paying the
[15:44] ultimate price. Let us also lift up in
[15:47] prayer the families who carry the weight
[15:49] of loss. Veterans who live with the
[15:52] memories of battle. May we be a church
[15:55] that not only remembers but also reaches
[15:58] out to comfort, support, and to share
[16:01] hope of this gospel. As we
[16:04] celebrate, may our gratitude be deep,
[16:07] our remembrance sincere, and our
[16:10] commitment to peace and justice renew.
[16:14] So, as we remember this Memorial Day,
[16:17] let's just take time to remember those
[16:19] that left it all so we can have that
[16:22] freedom. Amen. Let's sing that song.
[16:25] Battle
[16:26] him. Oh, his truth is
[16:32] mine.
[16:36] Oh, all
[16:38] glory glory.
[16:44] Hallelujah. Oh
[16:47] glory be glory.
[16:53] Hallelujah. Oh

[17:15] of

[17:23] altar evening roof and dance. I can read
[17:29] his righteous sentence wrath through dim
[17:33] and fling lamps his

[18:10] hallelujah. His truth is
[18:15] marching all.
[18:19] Oh, he has sounded forth the trumpet
[18:24] that shall never sound retreat. He is
[18:29] sifting out the hearts of men before his
[18:34] judgement se. Oh, be swift my soul.
[18:40] Answer him. Be
[18:43] true my feet. our
[18:47] God with his
[18:49] marching
[18:51] [Music]
[18:53] glor. Oh
[18:56] glory be
[18:57] glory
[19:02] hallelujah. Oh
[19:04] glory
[19:06] glory hallelujah.
[19:11] Oh
[19:13] God bring
[19:15] glory.
[19:18] Hallelujah. His truth is
[19:24] mine. Oh.
[19:26] [Music]
[19:28] Oh, in the beauty of the name. Christ
[19:33] was born across the
[19:36] sea with glory in his bosom. He
[19:42] transfigured you and me. As he died to
[19:47] make
[19:49] man, let us live to make man free. Our
[19:55] God who is
[19:58] marching.
[20:02] Oh
[20:04] Lord,
[20:10] glory. Oh
[20:12] glory, how great glory.
[20:16] [Music]
[20:22] before me.

[23:18] Lord, just believe you as you want us to
[23:20] be. Believe you,
[23:22] Lord. And Lord, we just have so many
[23:26] people who are battling. Lord, Lord,
[23:28] Satan is such a coward. He just attacks
[23:32] people, Lord. Lord, he knows he's
[23:34] defeated, but he's like a cornered
[23:37] animal right now, Lord. He's just
[23:38] attacking and throwing everything he can
[23:41] at us. But Lord, he can never win. He's
[23:45] never going to be able to defeat us,
[23:47] Lord. No matter what happens, Lord, even
[23:49] if you let Lord him take someone's life,
[23:53] Lord, that's still victory to you
[23:54] because they're going back to you, Lord
[23:57] Jesus. And Lord, I just believe, Lord,
[24:00] all these prayer requests, Lord, that
[24:02] came in. Lord, you have them all in your
[24:04] hand, Lord. You know what's what's going
[24:06] to happen, Lord. Lord, you knew what was
[24:08] going to happen before it even happened.
[24:11] And Lord, we just thank you, Lord, that
[24:12] we have this opportunity to come in
[24:14] here, Lord. Lord, to bring all of our
[24:17] licks of fire together and just be able
[24:19] to praise you, Lord. Lord, to lift up
[24:22] these prayer
[24:23] requests. Lord Jesus, I just thank you
[24:25] so much for what you do for us each and
[24:27] every day. Lord, all the blessings we
[24:29] have in our life, we don't deserve any
[24:31] of them, but Lord, you give them to us
[24:34] regardless. Lord, I just ask that you
[24:37] give Brother Ron strength this morning,
[24:39] Lord, as he brings forth the word. Lord,
[24:42] just give him one sentence for me, one
[24:44] sentence for each of us, Lord. Even if
[24:46] it's just one word, Lord, that I need to
[24:48] hear today, Lord. Let it come across
[24:50] this pulpit and hit my heart, Lord. And
[24:53] I just thank you, Lord, for everything
[24:54] that you do, Lord. We just love you with
[24:57] all of our hearts. We just ask it all in
[24:59] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

[45:16] Without him, all of us would be in
[45:18] trouble today. Amen. Amen. I think we've
[45:22] come to that knowledge. When we were on
[45:24] our own, we were a mess. Come on. That's
[45:28] right.
[45:30] We were just a mess. But God, rich in
[45:33] mercy.
[45:35] He rewrote our book. Amen. Amen.
[45:40] Amen. I'm glad he had an eraser.
[45:46] [Music]
[45:47] One of the most important parts of a
[45:49] pencil is an eraser.
[45:52] And I'm glad that God used that great
[45:56] eraser on my life. And thank God for the
[46:00] blood. Amen. Amen. What a wonderful
[46:02] service already. Amen. Won't you greet
[46:05] your neighbor right there where you're
[46:06] at and say, "It's just good to be in the

[46:11] And
[46:13] Amen. Amen.
[46:17] Amen. Hallelujah.
[46:21] God bless you. God bless you. So honored
[46:25] to to be here with you and stand among
[46:28] you and love you with all my heart. And
[46:32] isn't he good to us?
[46:35] Would like to just congratulate all

[46:38] those that have graduated kindergarten.
[46:41] That's a big deal.
[46:43] And uh Amen. You learn everything that

[46:46] kindergarten.

[47:07] We're getting ready to go home and Amen.
[47:11] I'm so looking forward to that. Aren't
[47:12] you? Amen. He's good to us. Just a few
[47:16] notes here if I can do it. If if you're
[47:19] if you're too weary standing, just just
[47:21] hang on just a minute. I'm going to
[47:23] stand for about an hour.
[47:24] So, amen. Sister Sue,
[47:29] uh, she called me this morning and and I
[47:32] want to relate this to you. Sister Sue
[47:35] wants to thank every person and for the
[47:38] prayers that you prayed for her. And she
[47:43] was she was bad. She was bad sick. And
[47:48] uh uh she had sepsis. I don't think she
[47:51] minds me telling that. And
[47:54] uh that can take you away from here.
[47:58] That's right.
[47:59] and and so
[48:01] uh brother Jonathan and Sister Autumn
[48:04] came for a prayer cloth and they they
[48:07] didn't they didn't go home with it and
[48:10] then go out the next day. They took it
[48:12] to her that night and she had a super
[48:15] high fever and and that night during the
[48:20] night the fever broke
[48:23] and so we're just so thankful and we
[48:26] want to continue to pray. they were
[48:27] going to run some more test up on her.
[48:29] And so, uh, we want to pray that God
[48:31] would just be with her in a special way.
[48:34] She's greatly loved here. Amen. And so,
[48:37] we're just thankful. For those that
[48:39] don't know, the prayer of faith heals
[48:42] sick. And so, and
[48:45] so, that's important to to know that
[48:48] prayer cloths are one of our benefits
[48:52] that that we have. and and I've wore
[48:55] prayer cloths for a long long time and
[48:58] and I sleep on a pack of prayer cloths
[49:00] about that thick from all over the world
[49:03] and I sleep on them every night and so I
[49:06] believe in them. Amen. And so we just
[49:09] are thankful, Sister Sue, thank you for
[49:11] that. Amen. So so so glad to give that
[49:16] report. Amen. Amen. Amen. Sister Sarah

[49:34] more. So we're really glad to have her
[49:37] uh with us and I know that you're really
[49:39] glad to have her with us and so we're so
[49:42] thankful for
[49:43] homecomings. Amen. Amen. Got a lot of
[49:47] new faces here this morning. We'd like
[49:48] to welcome you to our place and enjoy
[49:51] yourself. I see John and Sarah. We're so
[49:55] glad to have you guys with us and so
[49:58] always enjoy you. We have a new fellow
[50:00] with us. His name is Ethan. He's been
[50:03] with us before, but Ethan's newless.
[50:09] He's a new
[50:10] Ethan. And uh I asked I asked to bring
[50:14] him to the office this morning. and I
[50:16] kind of wanted to know
[50:19] when and so we talked for a few moments
[50:22] and and I took him outside and that's
[50:25] where you saw me and uh I took him
[50:28] outside and I said I want to know when
[50:31] when did that happen and he said at the
[50:34] October meetings
[50:36] uh at brother Tim Puitz he said he never
[50:40] felt any emotion whatsoever but during
[50:43] the service it just happened.
[50:47] Amen.
[50:51] All you need is one touch
[50:56] one touch and you'll never be the same.
[51:01] And he rewrites your book and you're
[51:04] never the same. Amen. Give Brother Ethan
[51:06] a good hand this morning.
[51:18] Amen. God bless you. Happy Memorial Day
[51:21] to you. And I pray that you have a a
[51:24] good whether you picnic or eat a hot
[51:27] dog. You know, the doctors say you're
[51:29] only supposed to eat one hot dog a
[51:33] month. A Conniey's going a year. That's
[51:38] blasphemous.
[51:41] Come on.
[51:43] So, some of you will get a few months
[51:46] worth of your hot dogs to tomorrow. And
[51:49] so, Amen. Enjoy the day. Enjoy the day.
[51:52] And I know that you will you will be
[51:55] blessed by that. If you will turn with
[51:57] me to Isaiah chapter 53 this morning.
[52:00] Thank you for your time.
[52:02] And
[52:06] and we're going to spend eternity
[52:08] together.
[52:10] Amen. I I so I so long for those
[52:16] moments.
[52:21] Amen. Isaiah
[52:28] 53 and verse one. It's very familiar
[52:31] portion of scripture.
[52:36] I can't imagine the inspiration of what
[52:38] Isaiah felt like when he was pinning
[52:41] this.
[52:43] Who hath believed our
[52:46] report? And to whom is the arm of the
[52:49] Lord
[52:50] revealed? For he shall grow up before
[52:52] him as a tender plant, and as a root out
[52:55] of dry ground. And he hath no form nor
[52:58] calmliness. And when we shall see him,
[53:01] there is no beauty that we should desire
[53:05] him. He is despised and rejected of men,
[53:09] a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[53:11] grief. And we hid as it were our faces
[53:17] from
[53:18] him.
[53:20] And he was despised, and we esteemed him
[53:25] not. Surely he hath borne our griefs
[53:29] and carried our
[53:30] sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken
[53:35] and smitten of God and
[53:37] afflicted. Let's read this next verse
[53:40] together. But he was wounded for our
[53:43] transgressions. And he was bruised for
[53:46] our iniquities. The chastisement of our
[53:49] peace was upon him. And with his stripes
[53:53] we are healed. You may be seated this
[54:05] morning in St. John chapter 18 and verse
[54:14] 36. This
[54:17] is two kingdoms coming
[54:21] together. And Jesus answered, "My
[54:24] kingdom is not of this
[54:28] world. If my kingdom were of this world,
[54:31] then would my servants
[54:33] fight, that I should not be delivered to
[54:37] the
[54:38] Jews. But
[54:40] now is my kingdom not from
[54:45] hence." Now Pilate
[54:48] responds. And Pilate saith unto
[54:51] him, "What is
[54:56] truth?" And when he had said
[54:58] this, he went out again unto the
[55:03] Jews, and he saith unto them, these are
[55:07] some incredible
[55:09] words. I find in him no fault.
[55:16] at all.
[55:21] I find in him no fault at all.
[55:26] And if you can put just put this in
[55:28] perspective, his own enemy, right,
[55:34] that was about to send him to
[55:36] death is testifying of God's
[55:39] masterpiece. Amen.
[55:42] I find in him no fault at all.
[55:47] I want to speak to you this
[55:49] morning on the flaw.
[55:54] Brother Ram says some things in the
[55:56] masterpiece and I just want to bring a
[55:57] few of these things out this morning.
[56:00] And he's talking about Michelangelo and
[56:02] what he went through and we'll just
[56:05] break right into a quote. He says after
[56:08] he had spent all that time, years and
[56:12] years to make this the statue of
[56:15] Moses and under the influence of seeing
[56:20] fulfilled what he had seen in his heart
[56:23] and in his
[56:25] vision. You can imagine he's been
[56:27] working on this piece of marble, right?
[56:31] He's been working on it for years.
[56:34] What was once a vision now is sitting in
[56:38] front of him.
[56:40] And he says, "And when it was
[56:43] completed, he was so inspired by it till
[56:47] he that he
[56:49] thought his own
[56:52] masterpiece should speak back to him."
[56:55] Amen. I think that's just incredible.
[56:59] He was so inspired till he thought his
[57:02] own masterpiece should speak back to him
[57:07] and he struck it across his the leg and
[57:09] and and hollered
[57:12] speak and it made a flaw on it. It put a
[57:16] flaw on the image. Now watch what
[57:19] brother Brandham does with this. To me
[57:22] the flaw was what made it the
[57:25] masterpiece.
[57:27] Amen.
[57:28] to me as a prophet standing knowing
[57:31] where he stood as a messenger of this
[57:35] age bringing out a bride for Jesus
[57:38] Christ. To me,
[57:41] amen. The flaw was what made it the
[57:44] masterpiece.
[57:46] Now, maybe to the mind of that might
[57:49] think different, you might think that
[57:51] that spoiled it. No. To me, it made it
[57:56] what it was
[57:59] because of after so many years of
[58:03] careful work and to pause and
[58:06] inspiration and so forth of making it,
[58:09] his to had proved not in vain.
[58:15] It was perfect.
[58:18] And that's why he cried out, "Speak."
[58:21] because he had seen before him that
[58:24] which was he was able to achieve to
[58:27] bring to pass the vision that was in his
[58:30] mind. And therefore under that
[58:33] inspiration, he done something out of
[58:36] reason, out of the ordinary, he struck
[58:40] it.
[58:44] He struck it. This is the first time he
[58:48] has
[58:49] ever in that kind of emotion struck that
[58:54] piece of marble like that. Amen.
[58:58] He struck it.
[59:00] Speak. See, he wouldn't have done that
[59:03] if he would have thought. But he didn't
[59:07] think it was an inspiration of sin. what
[59:11] he had on his mind sitting there
[59:14] perfectly before him, right? His tolls,
[59:17] his worries, his long nights and housed
[59:21] away from the world for days and maybe
[59:24] eating a sandwich and rub on it and get
[59:27] back and say, "No, that's not just the
[59:30] way that it was. And no, it's got to
[59:32] come to this or that and rubbing it."
[59:34] And then he saw it perfect.
[59:39] Just perfect.
[59:43] And when he saw in reality the negative
[59:47] of what was in his mind become real, it
[59:50] become positive. Therefore, it sprung
[59:54] into him that it was so real, he must
[59:58] cry out, "Speak."
[1:00:01] And to me, it was a reflection. Come on.
[1:00:04] It was a compliment to his work
[1:00:09] that his own work so inspired him that
[1:00:15] he would become beside himself to smite
[1:00:19] it and to say speak.
[1:00:23] I'd like to been there. That's right.
[1:00:25] Amen. And I stood there and I looked at
[1:00:28] that
[1:00:29] monument and I thought of the hours that
[1:00:32] that man must have put in in making
[1:00:35] that. And they said how many years that
[1:00:38] it was. And it was a reflection to him
[1:00:40] because it was a contribution to his
[1:00:44] great
[1:00:45] work, his great work of what he was
[1:00:49] doing and what he was finally able to
[1:00:54] achieve. Right.
[1:00:58] Brother Brandham was in in in
[1:01:01] prayer and he said, "God, who made the
[1:01:05] heavens and the earth, who made all
[1:01:08] things good and
[1:01:11] well, and you were pleased with
[1:01:15] it, but
[1:01:17] Satan marred those things."
[1:01:22] But thou hast sent thy son to correct
[1:01:27] all those things that Satan did smear.
[1:01:32] Hallelujah.
[1:01:36] I'm going to try try to behave.
[1:01:39] I want to read it again because it's so
[1:01:41] powerful. And he's in prayer. A prophet
[1:01:44] in prayer with the creator.
[1:01:47] God who made the heavens and the earth
[1:01:51] and made all the things that that were
[1:01:54] good and well and you were pleased with
[1:01:58] it. But Satan marred those
[1:02:02] things. But thou has sent thy son to
[1:02:07] correct
[1:02:09] all the those things that Satan did
[1:02:13] more.
[1:02:16] Now, I want you to just kind of pay
[1:02:18] attention now just just for this
[1:02:21] thought, if you
[1:02:22] will. Now, he says,
[1:02:24] now he said that that if you've got it
[1:02:27] this way, you you're going to have your
[1:02:28] ups and
[1:02:30] downs. He said, I would advise you to go
[1:02:34] to God. How many has any ups and downs?
[1:02:38] You heard about them last night.
[1:02:41] I was hoping you wouldn't read this. You
[1:02:43] were so close.
[1:02:46] Wasn't that great?
[1:02:48] Wasn't that
[1:02:57] great? That reminded me of a young Billy
[1:02:59] Andrews at work last night. I told him
[1:03:03] that this morning. Now, he said, "If
[1:03:05] you're going to have your ups and downs
[1:03:07] and ups and downs, and I would advise
[1:03:09] you to go to God." Well, that's a good
[1:03:11] spot to go to. Right. And he says, "And
[1:03:14] stay there until you're really born
[1:03:17] again."
[1:03:19] When trials and troubles and heartaches
[1:03:22] and disappointments set
[1:03:24] in, something holds you. That's right.
[1:03:29] That don't mean they're going to go
[1:03:30] away. Come on. But you're not trying to
[1:03:33] hold on anymore. That's right.
[1:03:35] Something's holding you. There it is.
[1:03:36] Come on. And he said, "Not you holding.
[1:03:41] Something's absolutely holding you. It
[1:03:44] isn't a question whether I hold on or
[1:03:47] not. It's a question whether he held on
[1:03:53] or not.
[1:03:57] It isn't looking at me. It's looking at
[1:04:00] him. He is the one. There it is. Now he
[1:04:05] said, "Now a man came here not long ago
[1:04:08] and said, "Brother
[1:04:10] Brandom, I'm not worthy to be saved."
[1:04:16] Brother Brandham answers him quite quite
[1:04:18] neatly. He says, "No, you're not.
[1:04:25] No, you're not."
[1:04:28] And he started
[1:04:30] weeping. And he said, 'Well, I've tried
[1:04:33] since 1940 to get
[1:04:35] saved, but I found myself not
[1:04:39] worthy. And he said, Brother Brandham
[1:04:41] says, "You never will be worthy."
[1:04:46] You never will be worthy.
[1:04:50] Then he said, "Then I can never be
[1:04:52] saved."
[1:04:54] And I said, "Oh, no. Is it it isn't you,
[1:04:58] it's him." Amen.
[1:05:01] God don't look at you,
[1:05:05] he looks at him.
[1:05:07] And if you can find any
[1:05:10] fault in him, then you can't be saved.
[1:05:19] But if there's no fault in him, then
[1:05:22] you're going to be all right.
[1:05:34] Now, here's the here's the here's the
[1:05:37] emphasis of this
[1:05:38] sermon. The blemish that you find in him
[1:05:43] is in you.
[1:05:47] Thank God he took my blemishes. Thank
[1:05:49] you, Lord. Thank God.
[1:05:52] But if there's no blemish in
[1:05:55] him, in you in him, then there's no
[1:05:59] blemish on you.
[1:06:04] Don't you love him?
[1:06:06] Now, if you can just look at it this
[1:06:08] way, and it's I'm going to just just try
[1:06:10] to put a put a perspective just to kind
[1:06:13] of get it started.
[1:06:15] When God comes down and the Holy Ghost
[1:06:19] comes down into your
[1:06:20] life, and when he comes down, you you
[1:06:23] have an old nature that's here. You're
[1:06:26] born with that old nature. The sins of
[1:06:29] your father and fathers and mothers and
[1:06:33] the DNA of your flesh because of Adam's
[1:06:37] fall, we all fell. All nature fell.
[1:06:41] So that first nature, Romans chapter 7
[1:06:45] verse one, you're married to that first
[1:06:47] nature. And
[1:06:49] listen, you didn't feel condemned to
[1:06:52] sin.
[1:06:55] You didn't feel condemned to lie. You
[1:06:58] didn't feel condemned to to to steal
[1:07:01] cookies out of the cookie
[1:07:03] jar. And you and you just you just went
[1:07:07] around and you just did what you did,
[1:07:10] right? Amen.
[1:07:12] But one day something struck your life.
[1:07:16] And you realize that there was something
[1:07:19] more for you. That's right. And that
[1:07:22] something more be to cry out on the
[1:07:25] inside of you. Now, you wasn't looking
[1:07:27] for God. God was looking for you.
[1:07:31] That's right.
[1:07:32] Oh, I made a decision for God. No, I'm
[1:07:35] afraid you didn't. That's right. That's
[1:07:37] a good thought. It's a good Baptist
[1:07:39] thought. Right? And it's good that you
[1:07:41] may have made some decisions, but let me
[1:07:43] just say this, you you couldn't save
[1:07:45] yourself. That's right. And in your own
[1:07:48] choices, you were going further away
[1:07:50] from God. That's right. But God came
[1:07:52] looking for you. That's right.
[1:07:56] Aren't you thankful for that,
[1:08:03] Brother Ron? I need an example. Adam.
[1:08:06] That's right.
[1:08:09] Adam, where art thou?
[1:08:13] Adam, where art thou? And when he found
[1:08:16] him, he had made himself a religion and
[1:08:19] covered himself up with fig leaves. Come
[1:08:22] on now. How did you know you were naked?
[1:08:24] Come on. Let me just remind you, when
[1:08:28] that third part of the angels fell,
[1:08:32] it did not move God. That's right.
[1:08:36] That's right. But when one son of God
[1:08:41] that was perfect
[1:08:43] got a blemish on him. That's right.
[1:08:47] When one perfect son of God walking on
[1:08:50] the in the Garden of Eden got a blemish
[1:08:53] on him. God came running.
[1:09:02] He came running through your
[1:09:04] garden screaming your name.
[1:09:12] Come to yourself. Come to yourself. Come
[1:09:15] to yourself.
[1:09:24] God sends that Holy Spirit down into
[1:09:27] your life.
[1:09:29] And it begins to burn that old nature
[1:09:33] out. It burns it out. And that nature
[1:09:37] leaves.
[1:09:39] Amen. That nature's got to die. That's
[1:09:42] right. That first nature to be married
[1:09:45] to Christ, you can't have two husbands.
[1:09:47] So to be married to Christ, you can't be
[1:09:49] to born to the married to the old nature
[1:09:52] and married to Christ at the same time.
[1:09:57] Are you with me now? That's right. And
[1:09:59] so that first man's got to die. That's
[1:10:02] right.
[1:10:07] So it dies and it
[1:10:10] leaves and it follows you. And now you
[1:10:14] have a new king on your
[1:10:16] heart. And that new king begins to give
[1:10:19] you new direction and new it's a new
[1:10:22] dispensation in your life.
[1:10:24] even a new administration if we could
[1:10:26] put it in its right order. And now this
[1:10:31] new king in your life has different
[1:10:34] desires.
[1:10:36] Wants to come to church.
[1:10:40] Can't wait till those doors are open.
[1:10:42] Come on.
[1:10:47] When you fall, it so
[1:10:51] quickly it so quickly checks you.
[1:10:56] In a moment, you father forgive me.
[1:11:01] You don't stand there and go, "Well,
[1:11:03] God, you know I did it and I had a right
[1:11:04] to do it." No. The real Holy Ghost says,
[1:11:07] "God, I am so sorry.
[1:11:12] I I'm so sorry. I asked you to forgive
[1:11:14] me. A word out of place or a thought out
[1:11:17] of place
[1:11:20] now. That old nature just don't go
[1:11:22] zooming off a million miles away. It
[1:11:24] follows you.
[1:11:27] And it follows you. And it now once had
[1:11:30] dominion over you. But now this old
[1:11:33] nature will follow you. It's a sticky
[1:11:37] nature. and and what it will do to you
[1:11:40] now. It will become a
[1:11:44] influence on your life and it'll
[1:11:47] constantly try to influence you to do
[1:11:50] the wrong things. Brother Ron, but I got
[1:11:51] the Holy Ghost, but your old nature will
[1:11:53] constantly
[1:11:58] once the king
[1:12:01] That's right. How many's ever had a bad
[1:12:05] friend? Or how many's ever had a
[1:12:09] friend? How many's awakened this church
[1:12:12] this morning?
[1:12:21] Now, you know, sometimes when you got
[1:12:23] bad
[1:12:25] friends, you know, I I just want to put
[1:12:28] I I I use that term and you'll
[1:12:30] understand what I'm saying. A bad friend
[1:12:33] will talk you into doing the wrong
[1:12:34] thing.
[1:12:37] Come on.
[1:12:41] And I had some bad friends in my life.
[1:12:44] And brother Jim, you'll laugh the rest
[1:12:47] of this
[1:12:49] day. But there's been some bad friends
[1:12:52] that that have sent you down the wrong
[1:12:54] road. Amen.
[1:12:57] Now, you also had another friend that
[1:13:00] was closer than them.
[1:13:03] And that old friend had to die. That's
[1:13:05] right. It was you. That's right.
[1:13:09] And you had to die.
[1:13:12] And now, just like those other friends,
[1:13:15] it'll want to come along and be an
[1:13:18] influence in your life. Good. And it's
[1:13:21] always trying to influence
[1:13:24] you. Now, brother, that's kind of in
[1:13:26] left field. Well, let's just see what
[1:13:28] these next quotes do.
[1:13:32] Romans chapter 7, verse 19.
[1:13:40] for that for the good that I
[1:13:44] would that I would I do
[1:13:47] not. But the evil which I would not that
[1:13:52] I
[1:13:57] do now if I do that I would
[1:14:03] not. It is no more I that do it, but sin
[1:14:09] that dwelleth in
[1:14:12] me. I find then a law that when I would
[1:14:17] do
[1:14:18] good, evil is present with
[1:14:22] me. This is Paul. This is a
[1:14:25] prophet. This is a prophet here where,
[1:14:27] you know, we're not talking about
[1:14:29] Shakespeare.
[1:14:31] That's right.
[1:14:33] This is a prophet.
[1:14:36] So then evil is present with
[1:14:40] me. For I delight in the law of
[1:14:43] God after the inward man,
[1:14:49] but I see another law in my members,
[1:14:52] waring against the law of my mind,
[1:14:56] bringing it into captivity to the law of
[1:14:59] sin which is in my members. Notice these
[1:15:02] next words. Oh wretched man that I am
[1:15:07] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:15:10] this
[1:15:11] death. Now he starts rejoicing. I thank
[1:15:15] God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So
[1:15:19] then with my mind I may serve the law of
[1:15:24] God but with the flesh the law of sin.
[1:15:27] Right?
[1:15:29] All have sinned and come short of the
[1:15:31] glory of God.
[1:15:35] This is a key thought that you must
[1:15:36] remember. Without God, we're all in
[1:15:39] trouble. That's right. Our sticky
[1:15:42] nature, our first husband
[1:15:44] just gave us immense amount of troubles.
[1:15:46] That's right. You know, I hear people
[1:15:48] say, "Well, the good old days."
[1:15:52] Come on.
[1:15:54] I don't know what was good about them.
[1:15:55] That's right. Come on. Amen.
[1:15:58] I woke up a lot of mornings the next day
[1:16:01] going, "Ah,
[1:16:06] you know, I don't do that now."
[1:16:12] Hey, I've fought cancer for five years
[1:16:14] and hey, I've had a God's been right
[1:16:17] with me the whole time.
[1:16:21] But you can fight alcoholism and fight
[1:16:23] it and fight it and fight it. go
[1:16:25] alcoholics anonymous and go through all
[1:16:27] kind of rehab programs. But if you ever
[1:16:29] get God,
[1:16:32] if you ever get God in your life, come
[1:16:34] on, brother David. And when you get God
[1:16:36] in your life,
[1:16:42] one moment.
[1:16:44] One moment.
[1:16:52] This next verse I want us to read
[1:16:54] together. Romans chapter 8 and verse
[1:17:00] 1. This is a scripture that set me
[1:17:05] free because I too ward with my first
[1:17:11] nature. And I'm not going to go through
[1:17:13] that book today, but I'm not proud at
[1:17:16] all
[1:17:19] at all
[1:17:22] of my first nature.
[1:17:24] As a matter of fact, when I was raising
[1:17:26] my boys, I never told them about that
[1:17:29] guy. I did not want them to know about
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:33] guy. Let me just give you a little
[1:17:36] story. So, my boys are with me now.
[1:17:38] They're
[1:17:39] grown. Was you married? We were buying a
[1:17:43] bull. And we were buying a bull. And we
[1:17:46] were we were standing on the on a
[1:17:49] gate and it was in it was in Pilot where
[1:17:53] we where I grew up and lived and now
[1:17:55] we're living here and my dad needs to
[1:17:58] buy a bull. So I was going to buy a bull
[1:18:00] for him. And so it's a boy's named
[1:18:03] Greg and
[1:18:05] uh you know I'm standing on the gate
[1:18:08] looking at the bulls and the boys are
[1:18:10] right there with me.
[1:18:13] And Greg said, "Are you boys
[1:18:16] fighters?" I Oh, God.
[1:18:20] No. Your dad was a
[1:18:24] fighter. Don't, Greg.
[1:18:27] Don't. He said, "Yeah." I said, "There
[1:18:30] was a guy that was about 6' three."
[1:18:33] Said said he was off from work for for
[1:18:36] almost two weeks and he came back and he
[1:18:39] was black and blue.
[1:18:40] He said, "Three people attacking and we
[1:18:43] come to find out it was
[1:18:49] Ron." I said, "Greg, they never heard
[1:18:52] that story. I I never told them that
[1:18:56] story cuz really not proud of that
[1:18:59] story.
[1:19:01] I would have much rather led that man,
[1:19:03] whoever he was, to the Lord."
[1:19:08] That's right.
[1:19:10] Maybe one day we'll get
[1:19:11] to. So sometimes there's clouds that are
[1:19:15] over your life. I believe I'm preaching
[1:19:18] to the right audience.
[1:19:21] That clouds get between you and the
[1:19:25] senross of the top of your life and they
[1:19:29] just they just cause a lot of problems.
[1:19:32] Romans 8 and verse one, I want us to
[1:19:35] read this together. There is therefore
[1:19:38] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:19:42] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:19:46] flesh but after the
[1:19:48] spirit. Now just a few verses before he
[1:19:52] says, "Oh wretched man that I am."
[1:19:57] Just because it's broke up in chapter 7
[1:19:59] and chapter 8 doesn't mean that the
[1:20:02] sermon doesn't continue. Hey, come on.
[1:20:06] Are you with me? The thought just
[1:20:08] continued.
[1:20:09] God didn't leave you with your first
[1:20:11] nature to rule over top of you forever.
[1:20:14] [Applause]
[1:20:15] But now you're under a new dispensation
[1:20:18] married to Jesus Christ.
[1:20:23] And now there's no condemnation.
[1:20:26] We are not Catholics. Come on.
[1:20:31] We are not in constant purgatory.
[1:20:37] Come on. We're not beating oursel all
[1:20:39] the time for the things that used to be.
[1:20:42] You can't do nothing about it. It's
[1:20:43] under the blood. Let it go.
[1:20:54] Hallelujah. Let it go.
[1:20:58] Don't dig up bones.
[1:21:04] Tell your neighbor, "Let it go."
[1:21:07] If you and your wife's fighting, tell
[1:21:09] her, "Let it
[1:21:10] go." Say it with attitude if you need
[1:21:13] to.
[1:21:31] Now in the passion translation, I
[1:21:33] realize this is not in front of you.
[1:21:35] Maybe you guys got it upstairs, but in
[1:21:37] Romans chapter 3 and verse
[1:21:41] 23, for we all have
[1:21:45] sinned and are in need of the glory of
[1:21:49] God.
[1:21:50] Yet through his powerful declaration of
[1:21:53] a quiddle, I love that. Of a
[1:21:57] quiddle, godly God freely gives away his
[1:22:01] righteousness.
[1:22:06] I want to stop right there. Or brother
[1:22:08] Ron, I just don't know if I'm saved or
[1:22:10] not. Okay. Well, let's let's talk about
[1:22:12] this for a little bit. Amen.
[1:22:15] So the blood cleanses you 100%.
[1:22:21] I don't think none of us can argue with
[1:22:23] that. So if your sins are in the blood,
[1:22:30] are you with me? And then God says, I'll
[1:22:33] give you your righteousness stump, so
[1:22:36] I'll give you my righteousness. That's
[1:22:38] right.
[1:22:42] So, I want to ask you with those two
[1:22:44] things, what more do you need? That's
[1:22:46] right.
[1:22:48] That's right. What more do you need?
[1:22:50] We're not Catholics where we beat
[1:22:51] ourselves and pay purgatory and pay for
[1:22:54] prayers. Count rosary beads. We pray to
[1:22:58] a living God
[1:23:00] that hears every prayer that we pray.
[1:23:04] Amen. Tell the old nature there's now no
[1:23:09] condemnation.
[1:23:12] I am a quit.
[1:23:25] Folks, we serve a rigged jury.
[1:23:29] Hallelujah. It's a rigged jury. Thank
[1:23:32] you, Lord. He's our judge. Yes, sir.
[1:23:34] He's our prosecutor and he's our lawyer.
[1:23:44] You can't lose, folks.
[1:23:46] That ought to make us shout.
[1:23:50] Hallelujah. Brother Ron, y'all church is
[1:23:52] so emotional. We just realize what we
[1:23:55] got.
[1:23:57] When you realize what you got, it causes
[1:24:00] you to be emotional.
[1:24:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:32] Now, I want to put this in perspective
[1:24:34] here just for a minute because it's a
[1:24:35] good spot to do
[1:24:38] it. There was a guy naked in chains.
[1:24:45] His name was Legion.
[1:24:49] And Jesus came.
[1:24:51] Amen.
[1:24:53] Now, I I want to go way past that story.
[1:24:56] He's going to go home because Jesus told
[1:24:59] him, "Go home." That's right.
[1:25:04] But there's a wife
[1:25:06] there that's been abused.
[1:25:10] She's been abused and she's been with
[1:25:13] the old legion. Whatever that man's name
[1:25:15] was, the name of the they call him
[1:25:18] that's because of the demons that was in
[1:25:20] him. That wasn't his name. That's right.
[1:25:22] So that man went home and he went home
[1:25:25] to a wife that had been abused, right?
[1:25:29] Somewhere all of those demons entered
[1:25:31] into his life and he wasn't even welcome
[1:25:34] in the community and the only place to
[1:25:36] put him was in the tombs
[1:25:39] naked
[1:25:41] screaming. Now he has to go home.
[1:25:48] Now she
[1:25:50] must forgive
[1:25:52] me. She must come to the
[1:25:57] realization the old legion is not here
[1:26:00] no more.
[1:26:04] No, you didn't get
[1:26:07] it. She's got all kind of scars, right?
[1:26:12] and she's got all kind of bad memories.
[1:26:16] But the guy that walked through the
[1:26:18] door, it's not the same guy,
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:25] but Jesus healed Legion,
[1:26:28] but he didn't heal her,
[1:26:34] so there's going to be some times that
[1:26:36] she's going to constantly bring up the
[1:26:38] old legion. Come on. But it's a useless
[1:26:41] case cuz the old legion's not here no
[1:26:45] more.
[1:26:51] Woo!
[1:26:54] Glory. He ain't here no more.
[1:27:01] Have you ever heard the statement,
[1:27:04] "Beating a dead
[1:27:06] horse. Right.
[1:27:12] So what you're doing, the new legion is
[1:27:15] there. Forgive me for having to use it,
[1:27:17] but that's the way we identify him. We
[1:27:19] got a new legion that's now a real
[1:27:22] husband.
[1:27:24] That's a real citizen.
[1:27:27] He's a real guy.
[1:27:34] Real guy. And
[1:27:38] now the new life has
[1:27:41] begun. And she wants to beat a dead
[1:27:43] horse.
[1:27:46] That's what a lot of you do.
[1:27:50] I've just fished for a little bit. I
[1:27:52] caught you. I caught you. Got you.
[1:27:54] There's a lot of you sitting in the
[1:27:56] building today that know that there's a
[1:27:58] new king on your heart, but you keep
[1:28:00] beating a dead horse.
[1:28:03] Let it go. Oh,
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:20] I feel like you do right now. I feel
[1:28:21] like y'all give me 10 minutes to just
[1:28:24] shout for a while.
[1:28:26] Just shout for a while.
[1:28:31] We had a good time this morning. Yeah.
[1:28:36] identified
[1:28:38] masterpiece. He said he was absolutely
[1:28:40] talking about Jesus. He was absolutely
[1:28:43] so
[1:28:45] perfect until he pleased the
[1:28:50] sculpture and inspired so much until he
[1:28:55] smoteed him at Calvary.
[1:29:04] Now we see
[1:29:06] him as the scripture said, God's
[1:29:11] masterpiece. We see him
[1:29:14] smitten, stricken, and afflicted of
[1:29:19] God. There is the real masterpiece.
[1:29:22] Watch what he does with this. There's
[1:29:24] the real masterpiece. That's right. As
[1:29:27] Angelo struck
[1:29:29] his, that's what made him the
[1:29:33] masterpiece. Comes
[1:29:35] over. He said, "Now the great
[1:29:38] sculpture when he seen the fall of his
[1:29:42] family, the
[1:29:44] masterpiece, he wasn't willing to leave
[1:29:48] it lay there face down and in ruin.
[1:29:53] He went to work immediately to build it
[1:29:56] up again.
[1:29:58] He wasn't willing that it should perish
[1:30:05] and lay there all that time because he
[1:30:09] is God and he will not be defeated.
[1:30:14] That's right. So he went to work
[1:30:17] immediately and be to build again unto
[1:30:20] his own image a man. Thank you Lord.
[1:30:24] Amen.
[1:30:29] Now in the fourth seal, brother Brham
[1:30:32] says he says
[1:30:33] when when that sin of that mortal is
[1:30:40] confessed and dropped into that
[1:30:45] Clorox of the bleach of Jesus
[1:30:49] Christ, it bleaches all
[1:30:53] sin. He is purely
[1:30:57] unadulterated without
[1:30:59] sin, without
[1:31:02] fault. He that is born of God does not
[1:31:06] commit sin and he cannot sin. The bleach
[1:31:11] stands between him and God. Brother Ron,
[1:31:16] I make mistakes but God.
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:22] Hallelujah.
[1:31:24] He said the bleach stands between him
[1:31:27] and God. I'm thankful for that bleach.
[1:31:33] Now, how could it ever get there when it
[1:31:37] breaks it up and sends it right back to
[1:31:43] the one that perverted?
[1:31:45] God takes the sins that was on your life
[1:31:48] and puts it back to the rightful one.
[1:31:52] right back on the devil.
[1:31:57] I love that. Don't you? Now, watch this.
[1:32:00] In that same vein of thought, and any
[1:32:02] son in the act is in the attributes of
[1:32:05] his father, just as you were in the
[1:32:08] genes of your father and in the body of
[1:32:11] your father when he was a young man, you
[1:32:14] were in him. Yet he could not have
[1:32:17] fellowship with you because he didn't
[1:32:20] know
[1:32:22] you. But then through the bedding
[1:32:25] grounds of your
[1:32:26] mother, you were brought forth into the
[1:32:29] earth and become the
[1:32:31] image of your
[1:32:33] father. Then he could have fellowship
[1:32:36] with
[1:32:39] you. And so were you sons and daughters
[1:32:44] of God. Right?
[1:32:48] Because there was before there was even
[1:32:50] a moon, a star, or a
[1:32:54] molecule, you were sons and daughters of
[1:32:57] God. For you are only the physical
[1:33:02] manifestation of the attributes that was
[1:33:05] in God at the beginning. Right?
[1:33:10] To me, that's one of the most powerful.
[1:33:12] If you get that
[1:33:13] quote, it will help you along life. And
[1:33:17] I want to read it again for
[1:33:19] you. And so you were. He's talked about
[1:33:22] your natural. Now he's going to talk
[1:33:24] about your DNA from God. You're the sons
[1:33:27] and daughters of God before there was
[1:33:30] ever a
[1:33:32] moon and stars or a molecule.
[1:33:40] This is pretty powerful. Before there
[1:33:43] was a
[1:33:45] sun, you was there. Before there was a
[1:33:48] moon,
[1:33:49] you was there.
[1:33:53] For there's only one form of eternal
[1:33:57] life,
[1:33:59] and that was you before. You don't have
[1:34:03] you don't have know nothing about it.
[1:34:05] And neither did you know when you were
[1:34:08] were in your earthly fathers, but you
[1:34:11] were manifested into his image and the
[1:34:14] image of God. You're made and you were
[1:34:17] manifested for the glory of God. That
[1:34:20] the fellowship of God. And therefore, as
[1:34:24] sure as you're a gene that had to be in
[1:34:26] your father before your natural birth,
[1:34:29] your spiritual gene had to be in God.
[1:34:34] And so, you're an expression of the
[1:34:36] attributes of his thoughts. And before
[1:34:38] the foundation of the world, right?
[1:34:42] No way around it. Notice now we notice
[1:34:46] then that the life being in you, God's
[1:34:50] life being in you from the foundation of
[1:34:54] the world. Right?
[1:34:57] You say, "Well, brother, I I just don't
[1:34:59] know about all of that. That's pretty
[1:35:01] words, but I don't know about all
[1:35:03] that."
[1:35:04] Okay, we're div we're a diverse
[1:35:08] group. We're diverse. We're We've come
[1:35:11] from a lot of different places.
[1:35:14] But I find it absolutely
[1:35:17] amazing that we can be from so many
[1:35:20] backgrounds and then when you're here
[1:35:22] just for a little while, you feel like
[1:35:24] you've known each other forever.
[1:35:28] That's right. Come on. Forever. I
[1:35:32] mean, you've been here, you know, you've
[1:35:35] been here forever. You know, you
[1:35:37] preached last night like you've been
[1:35:38] here forever.
[1:35:41] It's because the same spirit.
[1:35:46] The same spirit.
[1:35:54] That's right.
[1:35:56] But I was an Amish. Don't matter. That's
[1:35:58] right. That's right. It don't matter.
[1:36:01] Come on. That's right. We got some
[1:36:03] sinful Baptists here. That's right. And
[1:36:05] we got some Catholics here. Come on. But
[1:36:08] God rich in mercy
[1:36:17] took that old man out and put a new man
[1:36:18] inside of you and that new spirit
[1:36:26] and now we can celebrate the fact that
[1:36:29] we were in God
[1:36:31] in the great masterpiece
[1:36:35] before there was a sun, moon, stars.
[1:36:47] Now he starts talking about the drop of
[1:36:49] ink and I think this is I think is
[1:36:51] really neat. Now he said this drop of
[1:36:55] ink now it was made for a purpose. He
[1:36:59] said that color become that color for a
[1:37:02] purpose.
[1:37:05] That one drop of
[1:37:08] ink can sign your death warrant
[1:37:12] and send you to an electric
[1:37:15] chair. Or that one drop of
[1:37:17] ink can pardon you from your sins.
[1:37:27] It was set there for a purpose. Now
[1:37:29] notice what he does here. We got to use
[1:37:32] it for the right thing.
[1:37:37] That's right. We got to use it for the
[1:37:40] right things.
[1:37:42] Well, you say, "Well, Brother Ron, where
[1:37:45] do I use it?" With your power to
[1:37:48] forgive.
[1:37:55] One of the easiest ways for you to set
[1:37:57] yourself free is forgive yourself.
[1:38:04] You heard last night the greatest enemy
[1:38:06] is you
[1:38:08] and you amended it.
[1:38:12] You're your own worst enemy.
[1:38:15] Then you've got to forgive yourself.
[1:38:20] That's right.
[1:38:25] Someday I'll do a better job of
[1:38:27] preaching that. But you got to forgive
[1:38:29] yourself. Good. Good. You got to let it
[1:38:32] go.
[1:38:34] Now watch. Every masterpiece has to be
[1:38:37] put on a
[1:38:38] foundation. He said, "Angelo's monument
[1:38:41] of Moses was on a 3 or 4ft piece of
[1:38:44] marble. It's got a foundation." And God
[1:38:48] in preparing for his masterpiece, he put
[1:38:51] it on a foundation of the
[1:38:53] patriarchs and the patriarch foundation.
[1:38:55] And he said first Abraham and then Isaac
[1:38:59] and Jacob and Joseph the four
[1:39:02] corners and Abraham was the foundation
[1:39:05] of faith. And let's just say he had
[1:39:08] let's just say four foundations. The
[1:39:10] foundation of faith of Abraham, the
[1:39:12] foundation of love was Isaac. And the
[1:39:15] foundation of grace was Jacob. And God's
[1:39:18] grace to to Jacob. Anyone knows that?
[1:39:22] But in Joseph was perfection. Right?
[1:39:26] There is where he could set his monument
[1:39:29] upon not the first foundation or the
[1:39:32] second foundation or third foundation
[1:39:34] but on the fourth foundation. Abraham
[1:39:37] portrayed Christ of course and so did
[1:39:39] Isaac in love and and Abraham did in
[1:39:42] faith and Isaac did in love and Jacob
[1:39:44] did by his grace because Jacob was a
[1:39:48] deceiver and that's what he was. He
[1:39:50] said, "But God's grace was with him."
[1:39:53] Right? Now, notice what he does with
[1:39:55] perfection. And he says, "When it come
[1:39:57] to
[1:39:58] Joseph, there was nothing against him."
[1:40:02] Right?
[1:40:04] I love these words. Just one little
[1:40:07] scratch.
[1:40:12] Just one little scratch. I think that's
[1:40:14] beautiful.
[1:40:16] He said, he told his
[1:40:20] father, he told his father, the prophet,
[1:40:24] say to
[1:40:25] Pharaoh that your people are cattle
[1:40:28] raisers and not
[1:40:30] shepherds because a shepherd is an
[1:40:35] abomination to the Egyptian.
[1:40:38] Amen.
[1:40:40] And there was a
[1:40:42] scratch on his perfect life. Up to that
[1:40:46] point, he was the perfect type of Jesus
[1:40:49] Christ. But being born of humanity,
[1:40:53] there had to be a scratch.
[1:40:59] Samson had a scratch.
[1:41:02] David had a scratch.
[1:41:05] But I want you to just notice God's
[1:41:07] grace.
[1:41:11] Can I put it like this to you?
[1:41:13] None of you would sit in this church if
[1:41:17] I had David's record.
[1:41:25] If I took my first my best friend's
[1:41:28] wife,
[1:41:31] impregnated her,
[1:41:35] and because he wouldn't go lay, I need a
[1:41:38] band-aid. How did I do that? I wouldn't
[1:41:41] go. He wouldn't go late. I had him
[1:41:43] killed.
[1:41:45] So now I become a murderer.
[1:41:53] What a flaw.
[1:41:58] But aren't you glad that God looks past
[1:42:01] the flaw?
[1:42:04] No, I did none of those things.
[1:42:07] Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:11] But God so took care of his flaw
[1:42:16] until David was a man after God's own
[1:42:20] heart.
[1:42:23] And God still recognized him as king.
[1:42:26] That's right. Regardless. Amen. In spite
[1:42:30] of That's right. overlooking it. Thank
[1:42:34] you, Lord.
[1:42:37] Even to where that Jesus will sit on
[1:42:41] David's throne.
[1:42:47] But Brother Ron, he was a
[1:42:49] murderer. Brother Ron, he had his best
[1:42:52] friend killed. He committed
[1:42:58] adultery. Did a horrible thing. Well,
[1:43:01] let me just give you a little history
[1:43:02] lesson.
[1:43:04] That baby died. That's right. But that
[1:43:07] wasn't the end of the story.
[1:43:10] That was not the end of the story.
[1:43:13] She had another baby.
[1:43:15] And that baby being from Basheba, that
[1:43:18] baby was named Solomon. That's right.
[1:43:22] And through
[1:43:23] Solomon, God allowed him to build a
[1:43:25] house.
[1:43:27] He wouldn't allow David to build the
[1:43:29] house only to collect the garments of it
[1:43:31] all. But he he
[1:43:36] allowed Solomon to take all the
[1:43:38] materials and build a house.
[1:43:53] a house like none other before.
[1:43:59] Solomon had blemishes.
[1:44:05] When I read in Hebrews chapter
[1:44:08] 11 and verse
[1:44:14] 31, by
[1:44:16] faith the
[1:44:20] harlot perish not with them that
[1:44:24] believed not when she had received the
[1:44:27] spies with peace.
[1:44:31] So he gives her whole record. But
[1:44:33] listen, after she marries Salmon, she's
[1:44:37] no longer mo recognized right there.
[1:44:42] It wasn't her
[1:44:44] righteousness. It was the seed. That's
[1:44:46] right.
[1:44:49] The seed that was in now in her
[1:44:53] preserves her.
[1:44:56] It isn't your righteousness.
[1:44:59] Can I say it? It is in your
[1:45:00] righteousness.
[1:45:02] It's the seed that is within you.
[1:45:25] Now if the bride in the beginning was
[1:45:27] the
[1:45:29] word or the bridegroom and if the bride
[1:45:32] is taken from the
[1:45:34] bridegroom it must be the word
[1:45:37] also. Now notice what the bride must be.
[1:45:40] Now, we're coming to an exit ramp. So,
[1:45:42] you you stay with me.
[1:45:44] Now, why must the bridegroom be the word
[1:45:49] manifested just made plain? Is because
[1:45:52] the bride and the bridegroom are one.
[1:45:58] She is just a smitten piece off of him.
[1:46:05] There is the masterpiece. It was
[1:46:09] smitten. Now,
[1:46:12] Michelangelo could not reproduce
[1:46:16] right it
[1:46:19] again. He could not put it back
[1:46:22] on. But God is going to do it.
[1:46:27] God's going to do what Michelangelo
[1:46:30] couldn't do.
[1:46:32] You see, when they sm when he smoked
[1:46:35] that piece of rock off of that statue,
[1:46:39] he couldn't put it back and make it like
[1:46:42] the original.
[1:46:45] But because of Calvary,
[1:46:49] when God smoked his own son,
[1:46:55] he took you
[1:46:58] out of him. Amen.
[1:47:03] And he can put it back
[1:47:06] and it be just like the original. That's
[1:47:09] why that he could watch Adam walk out of
[1:47:11] the Garden of Eden and make him a
[1:47:13] promise. That's right. I'll bring you
[1:47:16] back.
[1:47:18] But this time when he brings him back,
[1:47:20] we're going.
[1:47:23] We're going.
[1:47:35] Now, I I want to get to one more point
[1:47:37] before I
[1:47:40] quit. In this life, I just brought up
[1:47:44] David. In this life, no matter how many
[1:47:47] years, and I haven't went back and
[1:47:48] calculated it. I don't care how many
[1:47:50] years that David lived, people looked at
[1:47:53] him as a murderer.
[1:47:56] They looked at him as an alter. They
[1:47:58] looked at him, no doubt, as
[1:47:59] king. They looked at him as
[1:48:02] restored. But it was always that
[1:48:06] thought.
[1:48:11] Brother always had a
[1:48:15] statement. He was one of a kind.
[1:48:19] And Homer would always tell me, he said,
[1:48:21] you
[1:48:22] know, he said, "A lot of people want to
[1:48:25] worship, Brother Brandham." And he said,
[1:48:26] "That was wrong."
[1:48:28] And he said, "A lot of people want to
[1:48:30] worship
[1:48:32] preachers." He said, "But if you get
[1:48:34] around me long enough, you'll know not
[1:48:36] to worship
[1:48:36] [Laughter]
[1:48:42] me." For those of us that are family, we
[1:48:45] say, "Amen."
[1:48:48] And we have a right. We have
[1:48:53] a, you know, sitting here so many times
[1:48:56] we think everybody's just
[1:48:58] perfect. Oh man. You know, you you come
[1:49:01] to church and you're here for a few days
[1:49:03] and you go,
[1:49:05] "Man, they are the most perfect people I
[1:49:09] have ever met."
[1:49:12] You stay here a
[1:49:14] while. Just stick around. Stick around a
[1:49:18] little
[1:49:19] while and you'll hear sermons like last
[1:49:21] night and you'll know, hey, these people
[1:49:23] ain't perfect.
[1:49:29] But sitting on these pews is not what
[1:49:31] makes us perfect.
[1:49:36] It is not what makes us
[1:49:38] perfect. It's the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:49:42] Ghost in our lives.
[1:49:46] That so changes us.
[1:49:52] If you can look past
[1:49:55] the facade,
[1:49:58] you'll see Christ.
[1:50:01] Amen.
[1:50:07] Brother Ron, but I got a flaw. Welcome
[1:50:09] to all of our worlds.
[1:50:12] We've all got flaws.
[1:50:15] But the flaw can either destroy you or
[1:50:19] drive you.
[1:50:26] The flaw can either destroy you or drive
[1:50:30] you.
[1:50:34] I want that to
[1:50:38] settle. We're not perfect.
[1:50:41] Not in this life.
[1:50:43] We're not sinless. Not in this life.
[1:50:48] But there's a blood
[1:50:51] and there's a life.
[1:50:55] We are not here, and I just want to
[1:50:57] drive this down. We are not here by
[1:50:59] tradition.
[1:51:03] I never want you to ever come here
[1:51:05] thinking, I got to come here.
[1:51:10] Listen, God don't force you to do
[1:51:11] nothing.
[1:51:13] This is a love affair
[1:51:17] between you and God.
[1:51:20] And if you really love God, you can't
[1:51:22] wait till those doors come open and you
[1:51:25] begin to worship God in a freedom of the
[1:51:29] spirit
[1:51:32] and you begin to say amen to the word.
[1:51:36] That's right. And whether you realize it
[1:51:39] or not, when that word begins to come
[1:51:42] down and it begins to speak to your
[1:51:44] heart and it begins to discern the
[1:51:46] thoughts and the intents of your heart
[1:51:48] and then you respond. It's one thing for
[1:51:51] the preacher to preach it, but then you
[1:51:53] respond.
[1:51:54] [Applause]
[1:51:56] Your response tells who you are.
[1:52:13] You're a sinner, it don't do nothing for
[1:52:15] you. You're a make believer, you don't
[1:52:17] know whether you're in or out. But if
[1:52:18] you're a believer, Oh, yeah.
[1:52:23] There'll be times you come here and get
[1:52:25] drunk. That's right. Amen. There'll come
[1:52:29] be times here you get say there'll it'll
[1:52:32] never get better than this and then all
[1:52:34] of a sudden the next weekend comes.
[1:52:41] I don't get nothing out of church. Put
[1:52:42] it in. Put something in. There it is.
[1:52:44] Put something in. put something
[1:52:46] [Applause]
[1:52:55] in. Now, I I I just I I just want you to
[1:53:01] understand when you look at that
[1:53:05] mark and brother Brandham is standing
[1:53:08] there and he's looking at
[1:53:11] that. Now, Brother Brandham is not just
[1:53:14] looking at a piece of art.
[1:53:19] He's thinking about the bride of Jesus
[1:53:21] Christ.
[1:53:23] Stay with
[1:53:24] me. That God has thought of before the
[1:53:27] foundation of the
[1:53:28] world. And now they're
[1:53:31] here. They're no longer in the bedding
[1:53:34] grounds of their mother and
[1:53:36] father, but now they're here.
[1:53:40] Now they're sitting on a pew. Now
[1:53:42] they're amening the word of God. And now
[1:53:46] they look so much like him.
[1:53:49] They look what? They look like the
[1:53:51] message. They talk like the message. I'm
[1:53:54] finishing now. They're more than a book.
[1:53:58] Come on.
[1:54:00] They're more than a tape.
[1:54:03] Come on. They're more than a piece of
[1:54:06] furniture in the church.
[1:54:10] They're the living reality of the quotes
[1:54:13] living.
[1:54:16] These quotes are good and fine in book
[1:54:18] form or in computer form, but God wants
[1:54:20] them to live.
[1:54:23] Where, brother Ron? Right here in your
[1:54:26] heart.
[1:54:42] I
[1:54:43] sing because I'm happy.
[1:54:48] I
[1:54:49] sing
[1:54:51] because I'm
[1:54:54] free. His eyes is
[1:54:58] on the
[1:55:02] sparrow. And I
[1:55:05] know he watches.
[1:55:09] I wish I could sing like Andrew right
[1:55:13] now. When I anointed him as a baby, I
[1:55:15] must have gave him all my singing
[1:55:22] ability. Amen. Sister Cassie, would you
[1:55:25] would you give
[1:55:27] me I

[1:55:37] happy. I
[1:55:40] sing

[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:55:54] is on the
[1:56:00] sp and I
[1:56:03] know he
[1:56:06] watches. Let's just sing this with all
[1:56:09] of our hearts now. Let it be more than a
[1:56:11] song.
[1:56:13] Oh, I
[1:56:15] sing because

[1:56:20] [Music]

[1:56:49] spare and I
[1:56:53] know he
[1:56:57] watches me. Let's sing that first verse
[1:57:01] there with us.
[1:57:05] Why should I
[1:57:09] fear discourage?
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:16] Oh,
[1:57:18] why should the
[1:57:23] shadow come?
[1:57:29] And
[1:57:31] why should my
[1:57:34] heart feel
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:41] so and
[1:57:45] long for
[1:57:48] him
[1:57:51] and let's sing it now.
[1:57:55] When she when
[1:57:59] Jesus is
[1:58:02] he's my portion.
[1:58:05] Oh, I love
[1:58:06] this. He's my constant.
[1:58:09] My
[1:58:11] God is so
[1:58:15] great is
[1:58:20] he
[1:58:25] is
[1:58:28] all
[1:58:34] this and I
[1:58:38] Oh, he watches.
[1:58:42] Oh, let's give the Lord a great big hand
[1:58:44] now. Hallelujah. Oh, I
[1:58:51] sing
[1:58:54] because I'm
[1:58:58] happy. Hallelujah.
[1:59:01] Oh, I
[1:59:04] sing
[1:59:08] because I'm free. I'm free. I'm never in
[1:59:11] that bondage ever again. That's over.
[1:59:14] Oh, his eyes.

[1:59:22] Oh,
[1:59:28] this and I
[1:59:31] know
[1:59:38] he while they play that just a moment.
[1:59:41] Maybe you're here this morning. You say,
[1:59:42] "Brother Ron, I just don't know
[1:59:46] him." We shared about Ethan just a few
[1:59:49] moments ago.
[1:59:54] Maybe just one moment in his
[1:59:57] presence now many more changed his
[2:00:04] life. One moment changes their
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:10] life. What about you this morning? You
[2:00:12] say, "Brother Ron, I just need that
[2:00:16] touch. I need the master's touch to
[2:00:18] touch my life. I got some rough
[2:00:22] edges. Won't you just say,
[2:00:26] "Lord, I need you. I just need you to
[2:00:29] help me." Listen, I don't care how long
[2:00:32] we've been a Christian. We need more of
[2:00:35] him. We need his
[2:00:37] touch. Our prophet would walk to the
[2:00:40] pullpit and pray, "Father, forgive me of
[2:00:44] my
[2:00:46] sins." I don't want to disappoint him.
[2:00:50] I didn't want to disappoint my mother
[2:00:52] and
[2:00:54] father. But greater than my mother and
[2:00:56] father, I don't want to break the heart
[2:00:58] of
[2:01:01] God. I don't want to break him. I
[2:01:05] wouldn't want to disappoint Sister
[2:01:07] Connie. My love is so great for her. But
[2:01:11] more than all that, I don't want to
[2:01:13] disappoint my heavenly
[2:01:15] lover cuz I love him so much.
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:21] He's here in the building. He's in the
[2:01:24] building, folks. Won't you just reach
[2:01:26] out and say, "Lord, come by my
[2:01:31] way. Come touch me
[2:01:34] today. Come rub some of the rough
[2:01:38] spots. Come rub some of the rough spots
[2:01:41] off my
[2:01:42] life. Come help me
[2:01:45] today. Come touch my life.
[2:01:48] I'll tell you what he do. He'll come. If
[2:01:52] you invite him, he'll come. He's that
[2:01:54] kind of a God. He'll
[2:01:57] [Music]
[2:02:03] come. Let's sing that course before we
[2:02:05] pray one more
[2:02:09] time.
[2:02:13] Keep
[2:02:18] watching. Let's sing it
[2:02:21] together.

[2:13:44] life in such a sinful
[2:13:48] world that it pre pleased the father to
[2:13:52] smite him. And out of that smiting, we
[2:13:56] were given
[2:14:00] forgiveness. Out of that
[2:14:02] smiting, out of that flaw, we were given
[2:14:06] eternal
[2:14:07] life. Now Lord, we raise our hands to
[2:14:10] you. Lord, we need you.
[2:14:13] We need your help. We need your
