[48:54] evidence of a jubilee and as we have
[48:56] just read Proclaim Liberty throughout
[48:59] all the land unto the inhabitants
[49:02] thereof for us as a congregation I know
[49:06] we're into the 2024 and we had our
[49:08] Jubilee year as a celebration for our
[49:11] church last year it was a celebration of
[49:14] a year not just a moment but a year of
[49:19] things that have went went on thank you
[49:22] Lord and we thank the Lord for all of
[49:24] that everything that was done and uh I
[49:28] tell you just last year looking back uh
[49:30] I had a marvelous time at Labor Day
[49:32] Services each and every one of us did
[49:34] Hallelujah but to kind of recap some of
[49:36] the things as a
[49:38] congregation I wasn't here 50 years ago
[49:42] but I am a part of this Jubilee I am a
[49:45] part of Full Gospel Lighthouse Jubilee
[49:48] but not just that I'm a part of the
[49:50] bride's Jubilee amen so I don't care how
[49:53] old you are how young you are you are a
[49:56] part here as a congregation and as a
[49:59] bride of Believers we are a part of that
[50:03] Jubilee as we started out 50 years ago
[50:06] we started out in a basement we moved to
[50:08] an old
[50:09] Storehouse then we turned a church out
[50:13] of a house turned our house into a
[50:15] church there and many of us remember
[50:18] that and I mean brother alen and them
[50:20] they could tell you that in the dead
[50:21] center of that house was a chimney but
[50:24] you would not have believed it after
[50:25] they've turned it into a church and they
[50:27] Shout at the walls down in that church
[50:30] amen granddaddy loved to have a jubilee
[50:33] March a run I remember as a kid of
[50:36] course kids we enjoyed that time a time
[50:40] to be able to get out of your pews and
[50:41] run around the church freely and your
[50:43] mama not going to say nothing to you
[50:45] about it amen as a as a child I loved it
[50:50] I loved it when he would hit that just
[50:51] before the heaven doors
[50:53] close amen each and every one of us did
[50:56] we enjoyed the Jubilee of all of that
[50:59] that was happening you know my
[51:01] granddaddy he seen a vision of this
[51:04] church on this
[51:05] hill and he knew that this was the place
[51:08] when he stepped up on this ground here
[51:10] and he claimed that he claimed this is
[51:13] where I'm going to build this
[51:15] church cleared it out a lot of work went
[51:17] into this place and we're on Solid Rock
[51:21] not just physically amen but spiritually
[51:27] also but that's what granddaddy started
[51:29] this H and I'll say brother Homer
[51:31] Frasier also he is my granddaddy so for
[51:35] those that don't know brother Homer
[51:36] Frasier former pastor of this church is
[51:38] also my granddaddy amen so when
[51:42] granddaddy came out of what he came out
[51:45] of Pentecost he did not want to stay in
[51:48] an organized Place Hallelujah he's seen
[51:51] a vision that there is going to be a
[51:52] bride that is going to believe this
[51:54] message in its ful fulfillness not just
[51:58] a part of it in the fullness of the word
[52:01] and he believed that there was a prophet
[52:02] to this age that fulfilled Malachi
[52:06] 4 so we believe that we carry that on
[52:09] today that didn't stop with Homer
[52:12] Fraser that won't stop with Ron Spencer
[52:15] and if the if the uh Rapture would
[52:17] continue it won't stop with Andrew or
[52:20] the next Pastor that would be to come it
[52:22] will not stop the Jubilee has sounded it
[52:25] it has sounded for this church for this
[52:27] bride and it is sounding forth and it
[52:30] will not stop you cannot stop this
[52:35] amen
[52:40] amen we have seen the evidence of it we
[52:43] have seen the evidence of the Jubilee
[52:44] that has sounded forth throughout the
[52:46] bride if these walls could talk and they
[52:50] could tell some of the things that has
[52:51] happened here in this church my we'd be
[52:54] here for ages to come
[52:57] come don't you just love him this
[53:00] evening the times that we've had in this
[53:03] church the
[53:05] word you know there was a time where
[53:07] these these Services weren't
[53:09] taped a time that we would love to be
[53:12] able to look back but we have those
[53:14] memories of them of those times I
[53:17] remember as a child and after shouting
[53:20] Services picking up bobby pin because
[53:23] they'd get stuck in the vacuum and
[53:24] granddaddy didn't want to buy another
[53:27] vacuum I mean it was just one of them
[53:29] things uh I mean but granddaddy believed
[53:32] as Israel there and I'm going to get to
[53:34] it let me instead of jumping head let me
[53:37] build a foundation
[53:38] here hallelujah and brother Brandon
[53:40] would uh say this in return in Jubilee
[53:44] says and as of 50 years ago when mothers
[53:47] and fathers you Pentecostal people
[53:50] tonight with them
[53:52] oldtimers one sitting on the pull pit
[53:55] here here tonight shouting and praising
[53:57] God they came out of them
[53:59] organizations while you speak of
[54:02] organizing them they'd laugh at your
[54:04] face see they were free yes sir they
[54:08] shouted and praised God they spoke in
[54:10] tongues they had signs and wonders
[54:12] Miracles they had the Holy Ghost come
[54:15] down they seen the literal form of
[54:17] Christ and they done great sign and
[54:19] wonders they suffered and bled and they
[54:22] went under persecution bitter and every
[54:25] thing for that cause and I would say
[54:27] that granddaddy when he started this
[54:29] thing he did not want to be
[54:31] organized that's what he came out of he
[54:35] this is a word that was not going to be
[54:38] organized not going to be placed upon on
[54:41] a bishop or some man that we have to
[54:43] look to but it was God Almighty leading
[54:46] this congregation amen so we see that as
[54:49] an Evidence of the Jubilee here
[54:52] tonight that's what we're talking about
[54:54] is an Evidence of it you're a
[54:56] representation of what has happened what
[54:59] will happen and what is to come
[55:04] amen let's just say that this
[55:08] congregation would say it like a uh PR
[55:11] Pastor from South Africa would say it in
[55:13] one of his last messages before he was
[55:16] uh murdered he says I won't give up shut
[55:19] up I won't let up until I've stayed up
[55:22] stored up prayed up paid up preached up
[55:25] for the cause of Christ I am a disciple
[55:28] of Jesus I must give until I drop preach
[55:33] until all know and work until he comes
[55:36] and when he does for his own he will
[55:39] have no problem recognizing me my banner
[55:42] will be clear and I have to say as a
[55:45] congregation as a member of this church
[55:47] our banners will be
[55:49] clear we're Disciples of Christ we're
[55:53] representations of Heaven this evening
[55:55] evening amen because what he has done
[55:58] for us in our
[56:00] lives Jubilee it's rooted biblically in
[56:04] Tradition signifies a time of
[56:07] Celebration restoration and
[56:11] Liberation biblically Jubilee in the Old
[56:14] Testament of the Bible a jubilee was a
[56:18] year of
[56:19] celebration for the re and a rest that
[56:22] occurred every 50 years it involve
[56:25] forgiveness of debts the release of
[56:28] slaves and the return of land to its
[56:30] original owners see the power of
[56:33] forgiveness in the Jubilee debts are all
[56:36] forgiven a fresh start is granted and as
[56:40] we forgive those who have wronged us we
[56:43] celebrate a jubilant atmosphere of
[56:46] reconciliation breaking the chains that
[56:49] bound our
[56:50] hearts in another form Jubilee year in
[56:54] some culture
[56:55] is an
[56:56] organization a jubilee year is a special
[56:59] anniversary often 25th or 50th year
[57:04] mark in Jubilee as a celebration in a
[57:07] broader sense jubble is used as
[57:10] described a joyful celebration event
[57:13] that is associated to signify a
[57:16] milestone or achievement so as I've
[57:19] built a basis of last year was our
[57:21] Jubilee year as a celebration for this
[57:24] church CH amen it is also a celebration
[57:28] that we will continue this
[57:32] amen and I'd like to build a foundation
[57:34] here by using the uh sermon and you can
[57:37] go listen to it return and
[57:40] Rapture and I'm just going to hit some
[57:42] highlights here to kind of build it here
[57:44] this evening so in a type A figural we
[57:48] take Israel because Israel in the
[57:51] Jubilee time and the church was given a
[57:55] portion of Christ himself which was
[57:57] poured out by the Holy Spirit each and
[58:00] every one of our hearts and received him
[58:03] and become sons of God see Israel was
[58:07] given to Israel only that land Palestine
[58:11] belonged to them and see as we see when
[58:15] Patriarchs were being born of their
[58:17] mothers their mothers would utter out
[58:20] their voice their name as they were
[58:22] being born and so later as Joshua would
[58:26] come Joshua not using mathematics as
[58:29] brother Brandon would say but he was
[58:31] using the Lord the spirit of God to give
[58:34] guidance on positionally placing them
[58:36] each and every one of them into their
[58:38] land their possessions that was given
[58:41] there by their name Asher Gad nethan
[58:45] Judah and everyone was placed
[58:47] positionally at that time each and every
[58:50] one brother Brandon would you want to
[58:53] say here it was like the stones that
[58:55] were cut out for Solomon's Temple all
[58:58] over the world but each of them was
[59:01] positionally placed to build that Temple
[59:04] and I have to say that each and every
[59:06] one of you no matter what Walk of Life
[59:08] you come from this evening you were cut
[59:10] and you were proportioned for God
[59:12] himself to have a purpose a position in
[59:15] the bride of Christ amen not some big ey
[59:19] or little you here we all have our
[59:21] position in Christ this evening amen man
[59:25] and each and every one of us was led by
[59:27] that Pillar of Fire that Holy Ghost Fire
[59:30] that fell upon each and every one of us
[59:32] as Joshua was inspired to positionally
[59:35] placed God has inspired to positionally
[59:38] place each and every one of
[59:40] you now
[59:43] also being said with that those
[59:46] positions that land that was allotted
[59:48] was their inheritance and for somehow or
[59:51] another if they would have lost their
[59:53] inheritance a Year of Jubilee they could
[59:57] redeem that
[59:59] inheritance see every seven days was a
[1:00:02] Sabbath every seven years they had a
[1:00:04] Sabbath and seven sabbaths was the 40
[1:00:08] was 49 years and on the 50th year was
[1:00:11] Jubilee and every man that had lost his
[1:00:15] inheritance by any means but he was a
[1:00:18] Freeborn true blooded
[1:00:20] Israelite I don't care what what it was
[1:00:23] but if he was a free born true blooded
[1:00:26] Israelite he could go back to his
[1:00:28] possession when that jubil sound was
[1:00:31] made that trumpet sound was made there
[1:00:35] was nothing that could stop him he was
[1:00:37] to be able to go back to his
[1:00:41] inheritance
[1:00:44] see excuse me I lost my place here but
[1:00:48] so he could claim that inheritance and
[1:00:51] this is a perfect picture of Christ in
[1:00:53] the church in the last days days see
[1:00:55] what man can
[1:00:57] do what man do do and then what God Can
[1:01:01] Do What man does is failing and will
[1:01:04] fail but God has never failed God does
[1:01:08] is eternal and it must remain forever
[1:01:12] nothing can ever take that away God gave
[1:01:14] it he h his gift
[1:01:17] freely by his Sovereign foresight saw it
[1:01:20] and placed it and there's nothing that
[1:01:22] could ever move it it was a Eternal and
[1:01:25] a jubilee and Jubilee was God's manner
[1:01:29] of expressing Grace to his people to
[1:01:32] restore them and be brought back to
[1:01:35] their rightful possessions so do you
[1:01:38] understand what we're saying here this
[1:01:39] evening that no matter where they went
[1:01:42] their inheritance as long as they heard
[1:01:45] that Jubilee sound they could go back to
[1:01:48] their
[1:01:48] possessions and brother Brandon would go
[1:01:51] on to say here in this sermon there is a
[1:01:53] lot of them that that sold out and they
[1:01:55] would be walled off in a city and in
[1:01:58] that City they would not be able to hear
[1:02:01] that trumpet sound they had walled
[1:02:03] themsel off and in this message brother
[1:02:05] brandham is speaking to Louisiana there
[1:02:08] and he is saying not to organize
[1:02:11] Pentecost was trying to organize at the
[1:02:13] time but he was saying do not organize
[1:02:16] amen and as this church we it was not
[1:02:19] going to be walled in Homer Fraser said
[1:02:22] this will not be walled in we won't be
[1:02:24] organized because there's a people that
[1:02:27] will claim their possessions amen their
[1:02:30] true
[1:02:31] inheritance
[1:02:33] amen so I want to ask you as tonight
[1:02:35] what did jubilee mean to you Jubilee
[1:02:39] meaning to you there's many here that
[1:02:41] when they heard that Jubilee trumpet
[1:02:44] sound all there's many of us that
[1:02:46] thought well I'm not I'm not even worthy
[1:02:49] to be bride I I
[1:02:52] cannot I cannot do that that that's not
[1:02:56] for me there there we was in spots in
[1:02:59] our lives Dark Places that where we felt
[1:03:03] that we could not take that possession
[1:03:06] we heard it we heard it but we felt that
[1:03:10] inheritance that true word of God I
[1:03:12] don't know if I could really live up to
[1:03:14] that but he knew you
[1:03:17] could it wasn't us it wasn't us it was
[1:03:20] him Holding On To You amen amen amen and
[1:03:25] as I would say evidence I want to Define
[1:03:28] evidence here this evening many of us
[1:03:30] know what it means but it's an outward
[1:03:32] sign an
[1:03:34] indication something that furnishes
[1:03:36] proof is a
[1:03:38] testimony it's signifying something
[1:03:41] legally
[1:03:43] submitted and asserted the truth of a
[1:03:46] master okay one who Bears witness of
[1:03:50] that evidence evid as a a police officer
[1:03:55] at Harrisonburg one of my first
[1:03:58] assignments was and I was a rookie
[1:04:01] police officer they called me in and and
[1:04:04] we had a a crime scene that I had to to
[1:04:07] keep a crime scene log and what a crime
[1:04:10] scene log is is wherever that yellow
[1:04:13] tape would be you have to stand out and
[1:04:15] no matter whoever comes in or out has to
[1:04:18] sign that crime sheet log what time they
[1:04:21] went in what they took in all the
[1:04:23] details and exactly who that was because
[1:04:27] whenever you go on that other side of
[1:04:29] that tape I don't care what you are what
[1:04:32] you've done you leave a certain evidence
[1:04:36] in that moment amen that's right so I I
[1:04:38] I want to bring that to you so think
[1:04:40] about that you leave a piece of evidence
[1:04:42] there and as I'm standing there as a
[1:04:46] young officer here comes the chief and
[1:04:48] two
[1:04:51] captains now it takes a lot for a rookie
[1:04:54] officer to walk up to his chief I mean I
[1:04:56] had barely said five words to him other
[1:04:58] than thank you for letting me be
[1:05:00] here you know I but I walk up to him
[1:05:04] he's about to cross the tape and I say
[1:05:06] Sir can you sign this for
[1:05:09] me all of their decisions changed in a
[1:05:13] moment notice they did not want to step
[1:05:16] on the other side of that tape because
[1:05:18] it wasn't as important as they thought
[1:05:20] it was because see when you step on the
[1:05:23] other side of that AP you now can show
[1:05:25] up in court at any moment they can
[1:05:27] subpoena you because you was at that
[1:05:30] moment and there was evidence that you
[1:05:32] were there okay amen but I also want to
[1:05:35] take it in a spiritual sense when the
[1:05:38] devil stepped into your life he left a
[1:05:41] whole lot of
[1:05:43] evidence but see there's another one
[1:05:46] that filled out the
[1:05:47] paper and when he stepped on the other
[1:05:50] side the devil says well see there's a
[1:05:53] lot of there's this here there's that
[1:05:55] there there's evidence that I was here
[1:05:57] but Jesus says hold up there's no
[1:06:00] evidence to be
[1:06:02] found see you didn't sign the
[1:06:05] paperwork I signed
[1:06:10] it that's what Jesus does for us that's
[1:06:13] the kind of evidence I like that's the
[1:06:16] kind of evidence of a jubilee that we're
[1:06:18] seeking tonight evidence that Jesus
[1:06:21] stepped into your
[1:06:22] life that he came and changed it all in
[1:06:26] a moment's notice amen many would seek
[1:06:29] the evidence of the Holy Ghost but let's
[1:06:32] just read what brother brandham said in
[1:06:34] the pergamin church age it says evidence
[1:06:36] of receiving the Holy Ghost today is
[1:06:39] just the same as it was back in the day
[1:06:41] of the Lord see it receiving the word of
[1:06:45] Truth for the day in which you
[1:06:49] live you seeking
[1:06:51] it receive the word of Truth in which
[1:06:54] the day you
[1:06:55] live just receive it receive that
[1:06:58] trumpet sounding amen that's what the
[1:07:01] Jubilee is it's the trumpet sounding the
[1:07:04] word sounding forth that's what it is
[1:07:07] receiving it for this day amen in Mark
[1:07:11] 16 it's it's us in action right now Mark
[1:07:14] 16 in action Mark 16:15 says and he said
[1:07:18] unto them go into all the world and
[1:07:20] preach the gospel to Every Creature he
[1:07:24] believeth and I and is baptized shall be
[1:07:27] saved and he believeth not shall be
[1:07:30] damned and these shines shall follow
[1:07:32] them that believe in my name shall they
[1:07:35] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:07:37] new tongues they shall take up serpents
[1:07:40] they shall drink any deadly thing and it
[1:07:42] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[1:07:44] on the sick and they shall recover amen
[1:07:49] amen receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:51] Ghost right there the bride mark 16 in
[1:07:54] action that's what it is see we've
[1:07:57] received the word for this day amen in
[1:08:00] Acts 2 it was when the day of Pentecost
[1:08:03] was fully come was fully come and they
[1:08:08] received the evidence amen it's also
[1:08:12] receiving the prophet to this age that's
[1:08:14] right Revelations 10:7 and 11 would say
[1:08:18] it like this but in the days of the
[1:08:21] voice of the seven angel
[1:08:24] yeah the seventh Church age the seventh
[1:08:27] angel the voice of that seventh angel
[1:08:31] and when he shall begin to sound the
[1:08:35] mystery of God shall be finished as it
[1:08:38] was declared to his servants the
[1:08:40] prophets amen do you believe that
[1:08:42] tonight do you believe that prophet's
[1:08:45] been revealed to us Malachi 4 amen we
[1:08:48] have a messenger to this age we're not
[1:08:51] looking for one amen we're looking for
[1:08:53] the coming of the king amen we're not
[1:08:56] looking for a prophet he's already came
[1:08:58] he's already been Vindicated amen it's
[1:09:01] the prophet to this age we believe he
[1:09:03] was the final messenger amen what is
[1:09:06] that Jubilee trumpet it's God's word
[1:09:09] that is sounding
[1:09:11] Out
[1:09:13] amen many times it's funny
[1:09:17] where people find or realize their
[1:09:22] Jubilee many of us maybe it even wasn't
[1:09:24] a
[1:09:25] church or a meeting
[1:09:28] somewhere my Paul Spencer was watching
[1:09:31] pett Co
[1:09:34] Junction he's probably rolling over in
[1:09:36] my on his grave there thinking that my
[1:09:39] grandson's telling that on
[1:09:41] me hey but he heard it he heard it no
[1:09:44] matter where you're at it's that you
[1:09:47] heard it amen one of my first
[1:09:50] experiences was I was driving home I had
[1:09:53] just dropped Cassie
[1:09:55] off and all and I was listening to
[1:09:58] Isaiah Brooks said I'm so glad I got in
[1:10:01] this Army in due time why in the world
[1:10:05] just driving home and all of a sudden it
[1:10:07] hits
[1:10:08] me I'm so
[1:10:10] glad well I'm so
[1:10:14] glad see I realized I have a better
[1:10:19] purpose amen I got in this Army in due
[1:10:22] time amen I wouldn't just stay there I
[1:10:26] would I would just continue to go up a
[1:10:27] little
[1:10:28] higher see and in that moment there was
[1:10:32] nothing in this world that could offer
[1:10:34] nothing
[1:10:36] whatsoever and if you'd have seen me
[1:10:38] later on that evening I was in a laundry
[1:10:40] room balling my eyes out speaking in
[1:10:43] tongues Isaiah Brook singing I'm so glad
[1:10:46] I got in this Army in due time cuz I had
[1:10:48] it on repeat amen and that's what you
[1:10:50] got to do sometimes just going and get
[1:10:53] on repeat have yourself a good
[1:10:55] oldfashioned Holy Ghost fill time
[1:11:01] amen but you would
[1:11:04] think in a laundry room hey he'll meet
[1:11:08] you anywhere but it's as long as you
[1:11:10] hear that trumpet sound
[1:11:13] amen it's going to Quicken us one of
[1:11:16] these days in a moment in the twinkling
[1:11:18] of an eye we're going to take a half a
[1:11:20] step this way they'll take a half a step
[1:11:21] this way and we'll be changed
[1:11:24] amen and why because you receive that
[1:11:27] word

[1:11:40] know there write it down listen to it
[1:11:42] says there's no place in the Bible where
[1:11:45] they ever receive the Holy Ghost without
[1:11:47] having emotions well there's a lot of
[1:11:49] people that think that they can
[1:11:52] just I receive

[1:12:08] God and prophecies manifestations they
[1:12:12] never did just walk up and Shake A hands
[1:12:14] with a preacher and then walk away see
[1:12:17] there's no place wherever in the Bible
[1:12:19] they received they were baptized outside
[1:12:22] of being baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:12:24] Christ that's right there's no place in
[1:12:26] the Bible amen there was never no place

[1:20:04] hey I'm sorry if you don't like
[1:20:10] it hey we're standing for
[1:20:13] something there's a lot of people that
[1:20:15] will tell you I'm standing against this
[1:20:17] I'm standing against that I'm standing
[1:20:18] against this well tell me what you're
[1:20:20] standing for then hold on tell me what
[1:20:23] you're standing for what you can say all
[1:20:26] I'm standing I'm against this I'm
[1:20:27] against that I'm against this I'm
[1:20:29] against the Bible I there's only a
[1:20:31] portion that we can now use well tell me
[1:20:32] what you're standing for
[1:20:34] then amen tell me what part of
[1:20:37] inheritance are you going to give to
[1:20:38] your children because that's what this
[1:20:41] is about evidence of a jubilee amen
[1:20:45] there is a portion that's going to be
[1:20:46] left to
[1:20:47] them okay evidence of this Jubilee is
[1:20:51] showing that there is something that was
[1:20:53] done something that will be done but
[1:20:55] there's also a people that refuse to
[1:20:59] hear it
[1:21:02] yeah because there was many times where
[1:21:04] those slaves would be in the field
[1:21:06] working and they would refuse to throw
[1:21:08] down their hoe and they say well I have
[1:21:10] it made here I'm not going to do that I
[1:21:13] am not going to go out and be free so
[1:21:16] they would take and they would put an
[1:21:17] awe in their ear they would Pierce their
[1:21:20] ear put an awe in it but why would you
[1:21:23] say I'd put a put it there hearing
[1:21:26] hearing see once that's done there's no
[1:21:29] more that you can receive freedom I
[1:21:32] don't care how many times that Jubilee
[1:21:34] trumpet sounds you will not be able to
[1:21:37] go free ever again ever again and that
[1:21:41] was evidence to a lot of them there in
[1:21:44] that time they could no longer go free
[1:21:46] you could look at him you say hey he's
[1:21:48] free or he's not
[1:21:50] free but there is going to be Children
[1:21:53] of the ones that refuse to hear it that
[1:21:56] will sit down and that will
[1:21:59] say what is that Jubilee what was that
[1:22:02] Jubilee so you're telling me there was a
[1:22:05] time when you was a slave that you
[1:22:08] refused to hear that trumpet where you
[1:22:11] refuse to become a
[1:22:14] Freeborn so you're telling me that
[1:22:17] because you're in
[1:22:19] bondage
[1:22:21] okay you refused it there is evidence
[1:22:25] that there was a
[1:22:28] jubilee do you understand what I'm
[1:22:30] saying there is evidence that there was
[1:22:32] a jubilee and so maybe some of them
[1:22:35] children they would kind of ask well
[1:22:36] what was it like for those that did go
[1:22:39] free tell me what was it like when they
[1:22:42] when they did receive their freedom what
[1:22:45] all did they claim well you see they
[1:22:47] claimed several things everything that
[1:22:51] was given to that family they went back
[1:22:53] and
[1:22:54] claimed but see we walled in and I
[1:22:57] refused it but I want to say that those
[1:23:01] children of the ones that have refused
[1:23:03] this message some of them may one of
[1:23:06] these days say there's a jubilee that
[1:23:09] sounded forth is that Jubilee still
[1:23:12] sounding forth and I'm going to tell
[1:23:15] them absolutely the Jubilee is sounding
[1:23:18] forth have you heard it have you heard
[1:23:21] it because if if you have heard it and
[1:23:23] you've received it you're
[1:23:26] Freeborn you're no longer a
[1:23:28] slave you're no longer a
[1:23:31] slave what is so-called what would have
[1:23:33] been your parents is now yours you have
[1:23:37] accepted this word you have recepted
[1:23:39] this message amen it's yours amen so
[1:23:44] it's evidence that there was a jubilee
[1:23:46] sounding forth As
[1:23:49] Americans when we think about Liberty
[1:23:52] and about the sounding forth of Liberty
[1:23:55] we think of the Liberty
[1:23:57] Bell I want to read some facts here of
[1:24:00] the Liberty Bell here this
[1:24:02] evening says the Liberty Bell weighed
[1:24:06] 280 PBS at its
[1:24:08] order it was made of bronze it's 70%
[1:24:12] copper 25%
[1:24:15] tin and contained small amount of lead
[1:24:18] gold arsenic silver and zinc the bells
[1:24:22] would yoke is American
[1:24:25] ilm it said that the Bell the huge bell
[1:24:29] was famously rung on July 8th
[1:24:33] 17766 in Philadelphia to announce the
[1:24:36] first ever public reading of the
[1:24:38] Declaration of
[1:24:41] Independence the Bale survived the
[1:24:43] British attacked on Philadelphia in
[1:24:45] 1977 and it would become a symbol of
[1:24:48] freedom to the young United States for
[1:24:50] victory over the British
[1:24:52] now there is a lot of facts about this
[1:24:55] Bell there's a lot of things that went
[1:24:57] into this Bell but I want you to know it
[1:25:02] rang that bell rang hallelujah it's no
[1:25:06] matter what was it made of but it's that
[1:25:09] it
[1:25:10] rang that liberty bell rang and as a
[1:25:14] Young Nation we heard that liberty bell
[1:25:16] ringing back then amen and it was a
[1:25:19] proclamation of what is that
[1:25:23] it's liberating us from what we was
[1:25:26] there what they was trying to do
[1:25:30] amen you can silence it but you can
[1:25:33] never stop its influence now
[1:25:36] amen and on the Liberty Bell its
[1:25:39] inscription is to Proclaim Liberty
[1:25:43] throughout all the land unto all its
[1:25:45] inhabitants
[1:25:48] thereof does that sound familiar in
[1:25:50] Leviticus there
[1:25:52] just think as a Christian Nation that
[1:25:56] that Liberty Bell would have that marked
[1:25:58] etched on that and we would be able to
[1:26:01] look back and see that Liberty when it
[1:26:03] was ringing forth what it was producing
[1:26:05] right then as a nation amen and we heard
[1:26:09] that so as that rang so is the Jubilee
[1:26:13] trumpet ringing it brings forth a
[1:26:16] liberty to
[1:26:18] Proclaim brother Brandon would say is as
[1:26:20] the eagle serve us enough said and they
[1:26:23] became Bond slaves to the modern society
[1:26:27] but when they were born to be Sons and
[1:26:29] Daughters of God see we were not meant
[1:26:32] to stay into slavery we was not meant to
[1:26:35] stay where we was in bondage we were
[1:26:38] meant to be born Sons and Daughters of
[1:26:41] God Amen and you might say well brother
[1:26:45] Matthew you're you're a white man in
[1:26:48] Virginia and back then you would have
[1:26:50] probably wanted to have slaves back then
[1:26:52] too I would beg to differ with you I'm
[1:26:56] preaching a liberty this evening to free
[1:26:59] Sons and Daughters of God so I feel that
[1:27:02] back then I would be preaching a liberty
[1:27:04] that hey you can go free we're not going
[1:27:07] to stand for slavery this will not
[1:27:12] amen we're Christians amen break those
[1:27:17] chains of bondage that would hold you
[1:27:20] Amen in James 1 and2 it says be ye doers
[1:27:24] and not hearers only amen deceiving your
[1:27:27] own selves for if you be a hearer of the
[1:27:30] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[1:27:32] man beholding a natural face in the
[1:27:34] glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth
[1:27:38] his way straight way forgiveth what
[1:27:41] manner of man he is amen don't just be a
[1:27:44] hearer of it and sit there and do
[1:27:46] nothing with this word be a doer of it
[1:27:50] also amen live a life it's not all about
[1:27:54] just preaching a sermon you can live
[1:27:57] that life amen you be an Evidence of
[1:28:00] what this Jubilee can produce
[1:28:04] amen but whoo ever
[1:28:07] lookth unto the the perfect law of
[1:28:10] Liberty and continueth therein he be not
[1:28:15] a forner forgot here but a doer of the
[1:28:19] work this man shall be blessed in
[1:28:22] deed so don't just be a a hearer be a
[1:28:26] doer also in the law of
[1:28:37] Liberty I gotta find my spot I've jumped
[1:28:39] so much this
[1:28:41] evening amen excuse
[1:28:51] me
[1:29:00] amen don't you love the Lord this
[1:29:02] evening Amen in verse in Luke
[1:29:05] 4 and it says and verse 18 says the
[1:29:10] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:29:12] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:29:14] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:29:17] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:29:19] the captives and restoring of the sight
[1:29:22] to the Blind and to set at Liberty them
[1:29:26] that were bruised to preach the
[1:29:28] acceptable year of the Lord
[1:29:31] amen that was Jesus speaking there he
[1:29:35] has healed the
[1:29:36] Brokenhearted he is preached Deliverance
[1:29:38] to the captives recovering sight to the
[1:29:41] blind set Liberty them that are
[1:29:43] bruised and he closed the book and he
[1:29:46] gave it again to the minister and sat
[1:29:48] down and the eyes of all of them that
[1:29:50] were on them fastened in that
[1:29:54] synagogue and he began to say this day
[1:29:57] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:30:00] your ears amen aren't you thankful for
[1:30:04] that that when you heard that that
[1:30:06] gospel sound you could go free because
[1:30:09] you did not turn it
[1:30:12] away it says now if a man and his family
[1:30:16] could go back to their original
[1:30:18] inheritance if they could hear that
[1:30:20] Jubilee and when trumpet sound and know
[1:30:24] that what it meant to them now they
[1:30:26] heard the priest sound that trumpet the
[1:30:30] the minister is the trumpet of the
[1:30:32] gospel and when they hear it and they
[1:30:35] know what it means they know that their
[1:30:38] inheritance no matter where they'd lost
[1:30:40] it how far they went back whatever they
[1:30:43] had to do they had the privilege to
[1:30:46] claim and receive again their
[1:30:48] inheritance the whole family could go
[1:30:51] receive their their
[1:30:53] inheritance and so it is tonight men and
[1:30:55] women here in
[1:30:56] Louisiana that knows the things that we
[1:31:01] do know have heard from our brother the
[1:31:04] different ones of our Pentecost
[1:31:07] experience of years and we find that we
[1:31:10] have and we find that we have walled or
[1:31:14] if we haven't walled ourselves away from
[1:31:17] what so far have gotten to hear somebody
[1:31:19] say instead of what the sayith the Lord
[1:31:22] says see you don't want to get so far
[1:31:25] away he's saying here that you can't
[1:31:27] hear what thus sayith the Lord has said
[1:31:29] to you amen not just a okay I I'm
[1:31:33] accepting this organization but it's
[1:31:35] what saith the Lord says unto you and
[1:31:38] you can hear what the Lord God has got
[1:31:40] to say about it now is the hour of
[1:31:43] Jubilee to come to your original
[1:31:46] inheritance once again the real Holy
[1:31:50] Ghost you know the other day I was

[1:32:03] remissions of your
[1:32:05] sins and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost
[1:32:09] now this is the part that I absolutely
[1:32:10] love I actually had a little bit of a a
[1:32:12] dancing time now I've read it and I've
[1:32:15] read it over and over again but at at
