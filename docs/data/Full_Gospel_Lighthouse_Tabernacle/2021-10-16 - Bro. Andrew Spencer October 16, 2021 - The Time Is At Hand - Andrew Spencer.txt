certainly uh appreciate brother ron and uh just want to make a few statements to you and i know there'll be some that are listening on the way the streaming but this is for you as a church body as well for the world to listen in we as a family and as church leaders have been commissioned by the doctors to to get brother ron away for a little bit and to get him away from the public due to his compromised immune system and brother ron will be staying closer to home for quite some time and we are we are now even having to reevaluate uh his schedule as a as of now and i'll be taking care of a

as you know i have been handling all the pastoral work for quite some time and just would like to just like make mention to you again that we don't want to add any drama on to brother ron nor myself and uh but just so you know that if something ever comes to my attention and i feel that brother ron needs to be involved i always inform him as needed and i know that there is no perfect church but i am sure grateful for our church i'm so thankful for you as a congregation and it is certainly an honor to be a shepherd over over the elect of god in this hour and you're just a fantastic group of believers and we thank you for for always standing with us and and it's our mission in doing this to keep your pastor healthy to keep them around preaching here for quite some time and i hope that you're okay with your pastor staying close to home and uh we'll reevaluate all of the schedules and things after the first of the year and and um just so just just know that we are doing our best to take care of brother ron in every way possible and i know that you don't get to shake his hand and uh hug on him and all those things and so we even having to limit mom in those matters so you know so but just kidding but we know this that this month is uh pastor appreciation month and uh and we're certainly appreciative of our pastor brother ron certainly appreciative of all that he has done for this message [Music] and we're certainly thankful for his vision to lead the church to see in his determination to see souls saved and and to see the message of the hour preached in its fullness and it become a living reality in each and every one of our hearts and just so you know i wanted you to be aware of those things and uh and so just so you know we're we're doing our best to take take care of brother ron and so i know that you're appreciative of all those things because you love not only the gift but you love the man ron spencer and i know that i know that everybody doesn't understand that but they love the gift more than they love the man but if you have any complaints here and on the internet see brother matthew amen let's sing that song god is good all the time amen he's got your answer for you well god is good oh all the time he put a song of praise in this heart of my god is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] do not fear for he will guide you he [Music] [Music] nor you and here's a word it is [Music] god is good all the time in the dark [Music] god is good all the time hallelujah he is good amen god bless you this evening if you have your bibles we'd like to look over in the book of revelations chapter one and then also down uh in ephesians chapter one and verse nine revelations chapter one first and then ephesians chapter one amen everybody have a good week amen we'll praise the lord amen man revelations chapter 1 and before we read let's just speak to the author of this holy word heavenly father we approach your throne of mercy and grace just now nor do we humble our life before you lord jesus set ourself aside lord that we might be used according to your holy plan well we realize that it's not a human ability but we realize that it is you that are working in humanity and is redeeming humanity and we invite you here in our midst here this evening father to be god over every situation lord and to take this word and begin to speak to your children today we love and appreciate you for all that you have done how that you have seen us through another week lord but one more time as we come and sit under the auspices of your word lord we ask god that thou would just minister to us in a supernatural way lord i pray that you take the word and speak to your children and we'll be careful to serve you and praise your holy name amen and amen amen revelations chapter 1 verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ aren't you thankful for the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw well blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and we realize and understand by the greek dialect and the dictionary on the greek that we realize that that word here is not necessarily of hearing through the ear but it is understanding because there could be maybe a drunk that would come off the street this evening and would hear these words and he would be able to say what was said here but it does not mean that he's able to understand it but there is an elect people that understand the very true meaning of what is being said here but notice and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen as you're turning to ephesians chapter one and verse nine and we'd like to speak to you on that that text there that the time is at hand and i truly believe that we are a blessed people this evening to be able to say that we have found him handled him and understand that this is the very true and living god that is amongst us amen ephesians chapter 1 and verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and we realize that all creation is growing that all creation is groaning for the fullness of the dispensation of times and we realize that when sin will cease is when this fullness of time will be and you can hear brother branham speak of that text when you go and listen on into the future home but notice in verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will so we can agree this evening that our destiny is in our hands that our pre our our purpose has been pre-planned before we ever got here that our name was not just put on the lamb's book of life when we when we caught it but it happened before the foundation of the world it wasn't something that just happened just when when you were down at the altar but it was back there you were back there with him and he purposed in his heart he purposed in his heart all things that verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord so he said we'd like to speak to you on the time the time is at hand and we look and we see in verse 13 there that that paul was speaking to those that are a pre-planned and a predetermined people showing that god has thought of us before the foundation of the world but notice what the scriptures say that after you that you heard the word of truth that after you believed and you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise it was after that you believe and you remember when paul caught that people up there those bunch of baptists when he went up there in the in the upper coast of ephesus and he had caught those baptists up there and he began to speak to them and they he began to ask them had they received the holy ghost and uh of yet and they said we don't know whether there'd be any holy ghost as of yet and he began to speak to him and he said well how was you baptized and they said well we were baptized under john's baptism unto repentance and john paul began to speak to them he began to speak to them and take them he didn't leave them where he found them but paul began to take the baptists that were there under the light of that day or under the light of that former day but he began to take them to the light of that day of the current day that there was more that was out there than what was being taught of just under john's baptism of repentance of remission of sins but now there was one that you could take on and you remember when after they after paul had preached these things that immediately they went and they did not baptize them in titles but he went out there and he baptized them in the name of the lord jesus christ and we realize this evening that paul was paul was taking them to another level of faith and they though they were living in the glare of the word of another day but yet paul was taking them to another to another level and it's amazing how the word of god will come by your way and maybe you're in a spot or in a condition or in a disease or or in some kind of thing but god does not leave you where he found you but god will take you to a level in which what's predetermined for your day what good would it have done if we to come and preach wesley's message wesley already fulfilled that but this is the hour of the very elect of god that has to meet the challenge of the hour we could not have a rapture under the man anointing but there had to be an ego anointing that would come and match the time and match the people that would match the persons of the rapture and you watch immediately after paul goes to preaching these things that the miraculous begins to take place after that the lord has come forth your what after meetings after meetings prayer line up to prayer line listening to tape after tape that you'll watch as the angel after the lord has gone forth that the angel comes and vindicates what has went forth and here when paul preaches he preaches on the baptism of the holy ghost he preaches on the remissions of sins in the name of the lord jesus christ but you remember if you go up there in the later part of acts chapter 19 that he gets up there and he starts dealing and he begins to tell us of those vagabond jews those exorcists you remember the scripture that he begins to deal with them and and those vagabond jews or seven sons of skeva they took upon themselves to declare or to say over those with an evil spirit they begin to rebuke in the name of the lord jesus christ they took it upon themselves in whom paul preaches we rebuke you but notice that if you go down and study the scriptures that the bible said that the evil spirit answered it said jesus we know and paul we know but who are you so even the very evil spirits that were in these men or in these in these people these exorcists these exorcists tried to take on and tried to operate in the name of the lord jesus christ but the evil spirit recognized that they were preaching what they were preaching could not be backed up by the life that they were living but there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be a final voice to the final age and though these evil spirits knew that these men the seven sons of skiva what they were preaching couldn't live up or couldn't chalk up to what they were preaching but these evil spirits knew the message that paul was preaching that it could produce the power it could produce the power to cast these evil spirits out because you'll notice that if you study the scriptures that the bible says that the name of the lord jesus christ it doesn't say that it decreased but it said that the name of the lord jesus was magnified the enemy may have thought that he won but the name of jesus christ will always come out on top these men knew that the message that paul was preaching could produce a power that would make them run and hide for cover and you remember on behalf beyond the curtain of time when he asked him he when he asked him said well who are those he said those are your converts those are your people they're not brandons those are your people and those people said were resting on that what were they resting on they were resting he said well will paul be but paul go in with his people he said paul we're going with his people he said well i have preached what paul has preached this same message that has restored the faith back to the pentecostal fathers this is that that was preached by the prophet paul and this is that that has restored our faith back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers it's a restored word with a restored faith and it produces same science same wonders same miracles faith is restored back to the church of the living god you remember when jude would go over there and you look over in the book of jude verse 3 it would tell us that we are to contend for the faith there's only one faith one faith one baptism one lord one god and father of all who's above all through all and in you all it's one faith and we are to contend for that faith but we notice that this is the hour or the hour of the miraculous is at hand because he's still the same yesterday today and forever and we realize that the bible would tell us in romans 10 and 17 that faith comes by hearing and the hearing by the word of god but faith is never built upon sympathy and faith never comes through discussing with people about their pains about their agonies about their aches and about their illnesses and about their weaknesses and about their all of their diseases faith is never built upon what you're going through but faith is built upon the very word of god and faith is born when we hear the word of god and jesus would say that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and we realize who is truth it's not a man it's not an idea but it is the man jesus christ he said in john 17 i am truth and it is our times as sons and daughters of god to declare war on every form of sickness in every demon or every high thing that exalts itself against the very throne of god and to take authority over every demon power through the name of jesus christ you as sons of god are not to stand there as some weakling as some wimpy little boy you're gonna stand there as a child of god a child of the most high god and declare that i am a part of the great i am my name is identified with him he purposed me but for the foundation of the world i am in his plan my plan is predetermined cancer can't kill me sickness can't win over me diabetes can't destroy your liver high blood pressure will not be the conqueror but you as a mighty talker will conquer every gate of the enemy and you will do with it as you please because you are children of abraham hallelujah it's a time like never before to believe for the impossible and the impossible takes place when god is taken at his word when jesus had two women that were in a distraught situation he didn't talk to them about their circumstance he didn't talk to them about what they seen but he began to take them beyond what they see and told them to look past what you see and feel past what you feel [Applause] are you with me he began to take them to another level it was a time when they had not seen this kind of thing since the days of elijah when he was put in there and that soldier fell on that bounce of bones of elijah because there was a promise that was laying there and when they watched the god of abraham the god of lazarus was there just with the same kind of quickening power that was upon elijah's bones and they realized that this was the same one that had made a promise over top of elisha he won't forget where you're at you can bury us you can try to stop us out you can try to kill us out but there's a promise hanging over top of every single one of your loved ones they may have whipped by the way of the grave but there's a promise there's a promise that they shall rise again you bury anything in jesus name and it'll come up is that right you bury anything in jesus name and it'll come up can he say amen you bury anything in the name of jesus christ and it'll go it'll come up amen i'm not just repeating or i'm not just stuck but you bury anything in the name of jesus christ and it'll come up but you see the difference you see the difference when you watch somebody as they begin to sow seeds that you'll watch if you're not real and paying attention that you'll watch that planning and burying look like the same exact thing they go into the same kind of ground they go into the same kind of dirt but you'll notice that you got to pay attention one's planted and one's buried but you have took on the name of jesus christ and he is as good as his word and he knows the timing and the season to raise you up for such a time as this what was esther doing in the kingdom at that time it was because there was a season for it and what is the bride doing in the worst of days in the laodicean church age what is she doing there for such a time as this god that which he's planning will come forth it's a time of sowing it's a time of reaping and it's a time for harvest [Applause] amen f bosworth wrote you go read his book he said when i ask people if they think it's god's will to heal them and they reply that they don't know whether it is or not i then ask them if it's god's will to keep his promise if you don't know if it's god's will for you to get out of your trouble ask yourself the question is it god's will for him to keep his promise he said that i was wounded for your transgressions i was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of your peace is upon me and with my stripes that i took in pilate's judgment hall you may feel like god ain't obligated to you and maybe he ain't obligated to your flesh but god is obligated to his promise and you that have been buried in his name oh come on somebody god's got a promise yes well i'm not good enough i'm too young i'm too old you're always going to have excuses that are staring you at the face but there is a promise that is hanging over every top of every son and daughter of god through covet through crisis through anxiety through depression through back pain through barrenness god has got a promise hanging over top of his children and he's obligated to his word but you remember in the junction of time that brother branham would say that that at every junction there would be angels appear there will be signs and wonders that would be produced there will be signposts that would point us it was never before it was never before but it was always at the junction that these signs and these wonders that were done it's at every junction at every crossroad these things are transferring and these things are happening if you could catch it in your own mind that you are at a junction you're at a junction of the ending of time and right into the blending of eternity what happened to william branham was not just for william branham that angel didn't leave when william branham left that same angel is here and he's still doing signs and he's still doing wonders what did he say he said if god did that for all those little junctions back there what will he do when all hell was turned loose he said all heaven would be turned loose yes well i don't know if i can understand her i don't know if i can believe all that brother andrew you just watch god will vindicate his word in healing and in powers and every time at the crossroads at the junction at the changing in the dispensations of time that's when he proves and vindicates that he's there he's right amongst you and he's still doing the same thing that he did back there you remember at the junction when israel was in a spot when it looked like god had forgot her down there in that foreign land for over 400 years it looked like god had forgotten but before god would ever turn his finger toward israel he had to produce the omnipotence before any time or any changeover god has got to prove himself that he's still the omnipotent god amen brother branham said that there was priests and there was rabbis in that day just like there is in this day that said that the days of miracles had done went out of existence just like they're doing again today they say we shouldn't have these type of things but god still produces them they said we shouldn't believe for the miraculous but god still does the miraculous they say we ought should not believe for our prodigals but god still brings in prodigals they say we shouldn't believe that those that are ate up with cancer should be healed but god still delivers of cancer they say we shouldn't believe for dead babies in a womb but god still delivers alive babies but it was at the time of israel's deliverance that the miraculous begin to take place and right here we are again yeah at another junction in time when the church israel needs deliverance from this laodicean flu it's a time to move on it's a time for a change it's a time to go on well we're message believers we're down here in egypt i understand we've got joseph's bones down here they could point every day of their slave life and they could go back to what moses or what abraham had said that god had said that his seed was sojourned in a strange land and then the prophets of jacob and joseph would catch on to that prophecy and they would realize and they would go over there and they would say now when i die don't you leave my bones down here because there's coming a deliverer as coming a deliverer and there is no resurrection power if you plant me over here in some trinitarian creed or some trinitarian dogma there's no life over there but i believe that the time is very soon when god will send a deliverer that would take us more than just back to some dead creed some dead dogma you can hide it in a casket but you can't have the promise and they could walk by there and they could lay their hands on that old steel dead casket when there was no life there but they could point back there but god needed to send them a fresh revival send them a fresh scene they had joseph's bones they had what joseph said but they needed to see god firsthand for themselves now i know i'm preaching to you right now you've been in the spot you said well i seen brother ron what he went through i've seen what others have went through but what about me you are in a season for the miraculous to take place he's the same yesterday today and forever you remember when elijah and elijah were making their last trip together and they were going forward you remember when elijah asked him said what do you ask of me he said i ask of you a double portion of thy spirit and he said now you're asking a very hard thing of me he said but if you see me when i go you'll know that the promise is coming by your household you see just like jesus would say yet a little while the world won't see me but you'll see me because i live you'll live also now notice what elijah when he got over there when he got over there and he got in that spot or that condition he'd just watch elijah how he went over on dry ground he he'd smoked the waters and he walked over and this and the school of the prophets were watching him go over and he said don't you fear that your master and don't you know that your master's going to be taken away from you and he told him to hold their peace but he got over there and he watched the miraculous take place right in front of his eyes elisha could go back and he could remember he could remember what god had done to elijah up there on mel karma he could remember how that he healed the bitter waters he could remember how he took that stick and he floated in there and that axe head came up god knows where you're living at and gonna produce the miraculous to show that he's still the same amen [Music] but notice he said a second ana robe was all right he said but he needed a fresh call in his heart he needed a fresh call in his heart from god he needed a fresh anointing from god he wore a second-handed robe when he come to the river but he needed a brand new first-handed call from god and a first-handed power from god to perform the miracle when he got over there he'd watched all these things transpire and he said but where be the god of elijah now notice what brother branham said he said to my brother don't you be afraid to ask god anything [Music] you must demand god or ask god for anything that he has promised he said if i am introducing a god that's omnipotent and all-powerful and if i be a servant of god i must do the works of god and if i do the works of god i must be a man of god to bring these things to pass because he's demanding of me to produce the impossible he said i have to ask him i have to call upon him and stand there and say god you promised it and so do you every person he said you shall receive power in acts 1 and 8 after the holy spirit's come upon you after the holy spirit's come upon you and after you've robed as a christian after your faith is set in christ then you shall receive power there you are and brother and sister everyone at that morning may i say this before praying for the sick may i say this by god's help you pray for me as i stood here ten years ago at this platform preaching on david and goliath now it isn't that goliath that's hindered me it isn't that the life that's hindered me here here is a gentile prophet that's seen more miracles done in his own ministry than what was happening in jesus's own ministry it isn't that the life that's hindered me god has slayed him before me but the thing that's hindering me is the lack of faith the lack of something that i know was around and this morning before this little tabernacle i'm screaming where is the god who gave the promise where is the god who met us yonder come forward god and give me courage give me strength give me a determined mind regardless of what comes or what goes whether it looks dark or whether it looks whatever it looks like move on the promise is true or the random was a human like you're a human but brother branham was not determined on his own human emotion or what he felt or what he's seen [Music] all right well be the god of elijah if he did it in days gone by where's he at if he did it in william branham's day where's he at if he did it for elijah vote if he did it for a lives of hope where is he at right now if it's still the same where's he at you're asking for the miraculous you've got to believe for the miraculous you're asking for protocols to return you've got to believe that prodigals will return you're asking for restoration you've got to believe for restoration it's not the goliath the goliath's already been delivered and he's not hindering you it's the lack of faith you must believe all things are possible to them that belief amen [Music] give me a courage give me a strength and give me a determined mind write it down put it on your refrigerator give me courage give me strength and give me a determined mind so many times people get caught up on feelings and their expectation never matches their feelings but our expectation is not feeling our expectation is healing our expectation is not emotion our expectation is god our expectation is not what we see with our eyes it's what he says in his word give me courage give me strength give me a determined mind oh god like never before give me the perseverance like george washington give me the strength like sam said give me the love like jesus give me a song like david give me a prayer life like daniel [Music] [Applause] the bible said in proverbs 28 and 1 that the wicked flee when no man chaseth after them amen but the righteous are as bold as a lion god don't want no cowards cowards will never be used in this army god's looking for somebody that's got a backbone somebody that'll stand as a rugged son and daughter of god that stressed himself in the weaponry of ephesians six but they ain't just dressed themselves and god isn't the one just dressing you but also there is a job for you to do in verse 18 he said praying always with prayer and supplication at good times i'm praying at bad times i'm praying on the mountain i'm praying in the valley i'm praying when i get in my closet i'm praying when i'm on my knees on prayer when i'm driving in my car whether i see good or that i see bad no matter the healing no matter the expectations of what people want in their own mind i'm a walk right in my promise praying always the bible tells us to pray without ceasing when you stop praying you stop fighting and when you stop praying you stop winning every time you stop praying and you cut off your prayer life you watch you'll live a defeated life you can be dressed up in the finest armor but if you don't know how to pray and get in contact with the one that dressed you god is looking for a belief not somebody that just walks around confessing oh i believe like the baptists believe i believed under george repentance but there was a higher level it was something more than just easy believe there's some oppressing play and turning on a tape but it's when you come down and the rubber meets the road and the devil stares at you right after you come off the mountain and he's looking at you and says do you got the goods you better know where you're standing at when the enemy came in for ron spencer what did he find he didn't find some coward that was built upon self-pity and self-worth he found a real rugged christian and a real soldier he might be a wounded soldier but i'll take a wounded soldier over a coward anything this week we this week we had a little little get-together for gabriel before he gets married the whole family come up here and my cousin michael came at a very very supernatural moment with michael you're very aware that we've been praying for him but he shared this with me and i promised him i'd give him credits from where i got this so michael here you go you could take it michael this is all this is all this is all for mike but he gave me this he said he said this this right here has stuck with me he said it was a philosopher and then later on told me he said heraclitus i don't even know who that dude is but he said somebody had to be smarter than me figure it out but he said out of every 100 men on a battlefield 10 shouldn't be there out of every 100 men 10 shouldn't be there 80 are just targets nine are the real fighters and we're lucky to have them for they make the battle ah but the one one is a warrior and he will bring the others back brother branham would say that he said now god's not looking he's looking for one person that i believe nine are real fighters but there's one that'll bring them back i heard it been said before i would rather i would rather be led i would rather be led or i'd rather be fighting with an army of sheep that is led by a lion then rather than a lot an army of lions that is led by a sheep you can be led by sheep and you can have the tenacity of a lion but if you ain't got somebody that can lead that can lead you into battles hey pick up that sword pick up that spear pick up your head we're going to win this thing you might be as weak as all get out but look out there in front of you the battle's already i'm thankful i got a pastor but more than that there's jesus on our side he said lift up your head you're not led by sheep you're led by a lie and brother branham said you are ten to the line of the tribe of judah you're not just some wishy-washy man's a pansy christian of the so-called religions of the world today you are a rugby son and daughter of god ken got the same blood as the lion of the tribe of judah you've got the tenacity of a lie to devour every enemy that comes against you we are as bold as alive what was moses doing out there that kind of tenacity he met somebody up there he met more than just a bush but he met a voice behind the voice he went up there and he was carrying this thick and they thought it was just a stick and the enemy thinks you're just carrying around some beat up old book it's more than just some beat up old book it's more than just got love letters in there it's got it's got weapons of your warfare in there and you as the bride of jesus christ are equipped like no other person you have the most powerful weapon that's ever been placed in the hand of humanity it's the very word of god and a prayer life to back it up moses could go out there and he could create life he could create and call for flies he could go out and create all these different things under the blood of bulls and goats what our son and daughter of god be able to do under the precious blood of the lamb [Music] moses had come to his time but he wasn't preaching noah's message he was preaching the message of the hour i could imagine moses going out there and preaching on contending for the faith i can imagine i can imagine him going out there and preaching on sirs is this the time of the sign the sign of the time that here we are this is what abraham said that there's going to be a people that are taking exodus that'll leave this whole egyptian world and he's walking up there with a promise amen he was walking up there with the message of the hour i could say that he probably preached on the contest knowing that he was going up there and faced pharaoh's magicians but you realize that that this ain't just some magic this ain't some magic wand that moses is handling that was a judgment rod but moses walked up there and he was carrying this rod you see vader ever got that out of his hand they'd had him whoop right there and if they can ever get your faith out of your hand and get the word of god out of your hand he's got you whipped right there we're not on some picnic here we've just been packing up all these scriptures and packing up all these testimonies and packing up all these rocks just for no reason we're in a battlefield we've been carrying this pack for some time now and realizing that it's coming for a time we said well man everything's pizza down here where i'm living in a time of peace it's a time to prepare for war you got the pack pack on you got ephesians 1 down through here you got hebrews 13 in there you got philippians 2 in there and you're packing it up and now it's a time that you're going to have to release those promises [Applause] you see extreme events calls for extreme beliefs and extreme beliefs cause for extreme miracles and this is the time for the miraculous we must have the miraculous yes brother ron ain't fighting a toothache brother brother ron ain't just fighting brother honey just fighting a headache brother on is fighting a demon that's attacking not just on his blood cells or not just attacking his lungs or attacking his brains he didn't just come in to make him sick he come in to kill him and it's a time for the miraculous you might be drove in that point at some point in your life or maybe already there and some kind of decision that's set before you you better have the miraculous on your side when all hope is gone jesus better be your hope when all fear is coming in your door you better have somebody that i could turn on the light [Music] amen the bible said in daniel 11 and 32 that the people that do know their god shall be strong and shall do exploits what you be is what you'll do if you be a coward you'll do like a coward if you be if you be some wishy-washy christian you'll do like some wishy-washy christian if you be somebody they ain't got a prayer life you'll do like somebody ain't got a prayer life if you be like somebody that don't know what you're talking about you'll do like somebody that don't know what they're talking about but if you be somebody [Applause] they got that song out the world said i'm gonna be somebody i'm not gonna be somebody i already am somebody because of somebody that took a nobody and made us somebody out of it if you're who what you be is what you'll do if you be strong you shall do exploits if you be a christian you'll do like a christian amen i'm gonna sit back here in my emotions till you move me you'll be in your emotions and you're doing your emotions well i'm gonna stream until cove it's over are you gonna stream the rapture when it takes place [Applause] i'm gonna sit back here in my recliner i'm gonna let the pastor please my ears [Applause] be a streamer do like a streamer be a church girl do like a churchgoer be a son do like a son have the mentality of a son you'll do like a song but if you can stand there under the blood of jesus christ and say there ain't no chains on me there ain't no chain there ain't no circumstance there ain't no disease there ain't no complex there ain't no circumstance i will do like a child of god i will be strong and i will produce the impossible it's a time to fulfill it's a time to move forward it's a time to press into the promises of god you know who you are and you'll know what you'll do said it a hundred times i look like a spencer i talk like a spencer i act like a spencer i laugh like a spencer i talk i day i dance i do all kinds of things like a spencer cause i am a spencer it's something on the inside well you're just trying to act like brother ron no it's something there you as a congregation you know you know i i was be i i was way after brother homer's heyday when i was in diapers when i was in diapers man he was in his prime i don't remember that and you've come to me and said when you preach and you point that finger man it's like homer's looking right over top of that thing and he's talking what's in there it's the life of a frazier that's being expressed and when you see somebody operating like a coward there's a life of a coward in there can i get personal if you see somebody just roll up her shoulder so well the pastor will do it for me what's what's in there it's not the life of a son it's a life of a slave it's a life of a catholic come on amen but this ain't the time to live like a bunch of catholics this ain't the time to act like some days gone by this is the time for the bride to race to our feet and live under the auspices of the message of the hour this message didn't call you church he didn't call you back to some dead cold farmer religion and called you for bride time it called you up to an astronaut edge not to live down here in the hearts and buggies no more but come up here up here a little high come on up here come on up here where you're supposed to operate at [Applause] brother branham said i i believe in the fifth seal he said i believe that the hours approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the creator he said i believe that if he can make a squirrel up here and here is a man or a woman just got a little partner said and that's a complete animal in itself he's god if he can do that for a little fishing if he can do that for a little possum if he could do that for some animal some insignificant animal he's god and he cares about all things but how much more should he care about you when you're going through your situation this ain't just about the preacher this ain't just about the deacons and the boards this is about you i believe therefore i speak the bible said in deuteronomy 29 and 29 that the secret things that belong to the lord our god the secret things belong to the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and our children forever that we might do all the words of this law the things that have been made manifest are rightfully yours and the bible said the lord is nigh you even in your mouth and in the heart that thou mayest do it and you are anointed like never before to go out there and meet the challenge of the enemy it's your time it's your duty it come time when saul wouldn't answer the call but there come time for a david when nobody else would rise up when there were greater men than him it was david's time when saul looked like he was right for the job saul wasn't right for the job when it looked like the other brothers were right for the job they weren't right for the job you can have all the mechanics in order but until the dynamics get there you can have all the scriptures in order but until the life begins to fall right in there it begins to operate now notice notice what happened when the anointing came it didn't change he didn't change david but he was already a seed he was already a seed it was something already laying there in there that could be produced and the life just flowed out you did not become seed by the rebirth you were seed therefore you could be reborn and when david went over there i'm bringing this too close nowhere close to being finished but when david went over there brother brandon said he didn't go over there in his earthly father's possession he said he went over there in his heavenly father's position he said his earthly father's possession was when he could say i killed a lion and i killed a bear he said but when he went over there in his heavenly father's position he said this day i'll take your head off of your shoulders you're not operating in your earthly father's possession you're operating in your heavenly father's possession why stand there and cry speak and go forward if he can get you out of egypt he can sure get you into a promised land god bless you let's stand this evening amen give the lord a hand clapping please hallelujah hallelujah god has a promise and he has a time that he'll fulfill it you could you can try to figure out all the timing of things and you can try to pre-plan all these things out but god's in control of everything you think sometimes that ministers put these things together or they do things just because they can but god is behind the scenes and he's moving all the pieces of the puzzle to make sure that he ain't got some cow up in some tree but he's working everything out you can say well let's look let's just make one let's just take one instance for a case right here brother ron's in an accident he's laying there for 17 days in a coma 36 hours brain dead in the worst condition of his of his life at the time there's there's children there's a church that's at stake there's a family at stake there's businesses that are at stake there's all these things at stake fear begins to creep in i said what if what if what if what if and then there's a man that's on the other side the other side of the country he said sister carly where are you at where are you at i'm in between hospitals this is what's going on with sister connie be encouraged the lord spoke to me we just bought mount baker camp and the lord spoke to me that brother ron will be next year speaker here's a man that's 36 hours brain dead in the worst condition of his life is man putting this together if brother biscuit is wrong his whole ministry is at stake if brother ron dies everything that he said is on the line but this isn't man this is god that is working all the details out the time was at hand for a word and god knows where you're at yes he does that's just one case there's thousands there's hundreds of thousands that we could take you through the timing of all things that's right here it is god knows where you're at and he knows when to drop that word what about elena butts it was her time what about mariah pruitt it was her time what about brother doug hill it was his time what what about brother homer fraser it was his time what about my wife had miscarriages what about that who put that together who put that together god put that together you see so many times we get caught up thinking we can do this in our timing we can move things out and we can we can we can bring our loved ones in but it's his timing so many times we get caught up because we know there's a vision and we see the woman in the red sweater and we we know there's a woman with a brown coat that's getting ready to come in but the hat's been put in another spot and we're trying to work the timing of it all and we're trying to why is ever why is he waiting why is he doing why is he building a sermon like that why is he doing that i can't move the hat you can't move the hat but when the hat gets moved the miracle happens and this is what i want you to be aware of you just watch god's timing will work every detail out you just get ready for the miracle amen [Applause] he was there all the time he was there all the time waiting praise [Music] he was there all the time he was there he was there all the time waiting peace [Music] he was there all the time [Music] worshipping you [Music] oh there's nothing else that i would rather do [Music] worshiping news [Music] oh i love for those moments when just you and i lost in your presence and lose track of time when i'm overwhelmed by your glory divine [Music] worshiping you oh there's nothing else that i would rather do i love you lord worshiping you who worship [Music] me and you make [Music] i [Music] [Music] only one thing to worship [Music] worship [Music] there's nothing else that i would rather [Music] why should i fear [Music] we read in the bible when he walked within brought light to the darkness when the way grew dim how great it would be now have his footsteps in mind and walk with the master all of the time and when trials come and death seems so nice [Music] sickness comes in my pot is in pain i have to do is call his name why should i worry why should i feel when the very same jesus is always so near he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry i call on his name till the storm passes by out on the waters storms raging high the waters around them they were troubled that night and fear filled their hearts they thought they would die and they failed to remember the master was nigh and he spoke the words and the winds all stood still even the waters [Music] just like he will mine if i'll just remember here and why should i worry and why should i feel when the very same jesus is always so dear he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry i call on his name till the storm passes by and hear my prayer o lord o from the ends of the earth i cry your peace will lead me to the rock that is [Music] [Music] your peace will lead me to the rock that is higher than i for you have been my strength in times of trouble with you forever [Music] that is [Music] cry for
