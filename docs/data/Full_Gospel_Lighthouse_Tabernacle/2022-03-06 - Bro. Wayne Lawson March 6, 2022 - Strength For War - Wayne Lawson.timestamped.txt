[36:30] it was just
[36:32] phenomenal for me to be there and so we
[36:34] thank you for having us there
[36:36] and uh god allowed me to put a little
[36:38] portion about your ministry in the
[36:40] wedding so
[36:42] god's doing great things
[36:45] he's doing absolute great things so good
[36:46] to see each and every one of you
[36:48] and we certainly love you with all of
[36:50] our hearts and uh i was so thrilled to
[36:52] see what god did last night
[36:55] that angelic presence had just dropped
[36:57] down in the room and you be aware that
[36:59] he's here
[37:00] he's already here now and and uh but uh
[37:03] i wanted to make a couple statements to
[37:05] you just before we walked brother wayne
[37:07] would come and we have one more couple
[37:10] more songs that's going to become but
[37:12] you know a man is known by his friends
[37:16] that's how you know a man and
[37:18] you are his wife and he reflects the
[37:20] character of himself
[37:22] by his wife and so
[37:25] then then
[37:26] you know him by his by the friends that
[37:29] he has and
[37:30] and i can look around and i've got some
[37:32] pretty special friends
[37:36] yesterday brother david showed up at my
[37:38] house with sister faith and
[37:41] and he was carrying this
[37:43] and he's been listening to the sermons
[37:47] it's a boxing glove
[37:51] not just a boxing glove
[37:54] it's a sugar ray leonard boxing glove
[38:01] now for the kernel side of me i was a
[38:03] fan
[38:07] and when i saw it i it represented a lot
[38:09] of things for me
[38:12] i've got a heavyweight boxing
[38:14] belt
[38:15] champion
[38:17] thank you brother vijay
[38:19] wherever you're at
[38:23] now i've got a glove
[38:27] and so i i took it when i saw it that
[38:29] god's not done with me yet amen
[38:33] and i remind you that we never never
[38:35] give up
[38:38] and there's absolutely no retreat
[38:41] and we're ready
[38:43] we're ready in the moment
[38:45] there's not a day off or not a week off
[38:47] uh we're ready we're responsive we're
[38:50] we're on the mark brother i'm gonna use
[38:52] that term on the mark
[38:54] we have a mission to finish and fight it
[38:57] until
[38:58] the day that he chooses to call us home
[39:00] the scripture says that i can do all
[39:02] things through christ it strengthens me
[39:05] it also tells us to press the mark
[39:08] that's just not for me but that's for
[39:10] every person sitting in this building
[39:15] you know sometimes but we're challenged
[39:16] to sit like a spectator and watch
[39:20] and as long as you're a spectator
[39:23] the devil's all right with that
[39:27] but the moment that you start waving
[39:29] your hands
[39:31] and you start testifying and worshiping
[39:34] god
[39:35] all hell turns loose
[39:38] but remember greater is he that is in
[39:40] you than he that is in the world
[39:52] there's times when we want to say no
[39:53] moss
[39:54] no more i quit i walk away i can't
[39:57] handle the pressure it's an urge every
[40:00] champion has felt it
[40:02] every prophet even jesus himself cried
[40:05] in the in the garden
[40:09] brother branham wanted to get away
[40:11] he wanted to go to the mountains every
[40:13] president has felt the urge to quit
[40:16] every king has felt the urge
[40:18] every line has felt it
[40:21] every winner has felt it every soldier
[40:23] has felt it
[40:24] every victorious person has felt it
[40:28] the urge to quit
[40:30] but it's not in our dna
[40:36] maybe in our natural man it's in our dna
[40:38] when we get enough we've got enough and
[40:40] we want to walk away but god put
[40:42] something on the inside of you and he
[40:44] procrastinated it there and he
[40:46] pre-planned it there that you will not
[40:49] quite
[41:01] the statement that i
[41:04] said a few couple years ago i've been
[41:06] sick before but i made it
[41:09] i've been broke before but i made it
[41:12] i've been broken hearted before but i
[41:14] made it i have cried all night long but
[41:17] i made it
[41:18] i have been betrayed but i made it i
[41:21] have been lied on but i made it i've
[41:24] been left destitute
[41:26] but i made it
[41:28] i've been rejected

[41:31] the theme of this whole thing is we're
[41:33] going to make it
[41:43] hallelujah
[41:48] you know we're looking at it now and we
[41:50] can see because we've had the prophet

[41:58] wrecking our nations it's wrecking the
[42:00] world but we're watching it with

[42:07] and weeks left and let me just say if
[42:10] that's what we've got left let's do it
[42:12] with all of our might
[42:22] the scripture tells us
[42:24] that no weapon
[42:27] that is formed against this shall
[42:29] prosper
[42:30] and every tongue that shall arise
[42:32] against thee in the judgment thou shalt
[42:34] condemn
[42:36] this is the heritage of the servants of
[42:38] the lord the righteousness of god of is
[42:42] of me saith the lord
[42:45] and i finish with this
[42:48] being confident of this
[42:50] very thing
[42:52] that he which hath begun
[42:56] a good work in you
[42:59] will perform it
[43:01] until the day of jesus christ
[43:04] god just don't get in inside of his
[43:06] project and quit

[1:05:24] 11th chapter
[1:05:28] we pray we've
[1:05:30] just stay on this direction with the

[1:05:45] if you put more in that i'll con i can

[1:05:55] i don't have a job for the government
[1:05:56] it's an ear monitor
[1:06:00] you can relax
[1:06:04] in daniel 11 and 32
[1:06:08] and such as do wickedly against the
[1:06:10] covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries
[1:06:13] but the people
[1:06:15] that do know their
[1:06:16] god shall be strong
[1:06:19] and do
[1:06:21] exploits
[1:06:23] amen we ask the lord to bless his word
[1:06:25] you may be seated
[1:06:27] i want to speak to you just a little bit
[1:06:29] this morning
[1:06:30] from this uh portion of scripture
[1:06:33] and if i would take a title here
[1:06:35] i want to talk to you about the strength
[1:06:37] for war
[1:06:39] about the strength for war
[1:06:41] i
[1:06:42] uh in studying this scripture we've
[1:06:45] we've moved through it extensively over
[1:06:47] the last few months just the lord just
[1:06:49] dealing with us and taking us back and
[1:06:50] forth
[1:06:51] it's amazing how brother branham says
[1:06:53] one scripture can tie the entire bible
[1:06:56] and it's it's the truth it just
[1:06:58] it just keeps uh bringing forth and
[1:07:00] unfolding and it's been a real a real
[1:07:03] personal a moment for me in the study of
[1:07:06] this scripture of daniel and to identify
[1:07:09] uh that it is the it is something that
[1:07:12] actually belongs to the bride of christ
[1:07:15] to know this is actually the season
[1:07:18] of the fulfillment of this word
[1:07:21] of the people that do know their god
[1:07:23] shall be strong
[1:07:24] and do great exploits let me read
[1:07:26] something from the feast of trumpets
[1:07:27] that brother branham will say it a
[1:07:29] little differently and i as i study
[1:07:31] brother branham a lot of times i like to
[1:07:32] listen to how he rewords a scripture and
[1:07:35] when brother brown rewords a scripture
[1:07:37] he's not changing it but he's bringing a
[1:07:39] better a a better way of understanding
[1:07:42] it he's not trying to add or change it
[1:07:44] he's trying to give us the true meaning
[1:07:46] of what it's actually saying and he says
[1:07:49] of it in in jeffersonville here feast of
[1:07:51] trumpets he's saying uh that the people
[1:07:53] will not know the messiah unless they're
[1:07:55] in the word and he said now a people
[1:07:58] that believe in him how can they do it
[1:08:00] unless they're constantly in the word
[1:08:01] see to know what he is
[1:08:03] and daniel said the wise shall know
[1:08:06] but the foolish and the unwise wouldn't
[1:08:08] know
[1:08:09] now they shall know their god
[1:08:11] and how he shall appear in the last days
[1:08:15] to bring the people back to the word
[1:08:18] see so that the bride will know her
[1:08:21] husband he exchanges here the people
[1:08:24] shall know their god with the bride
[1:08:27] we'll know her husband to know her mate
[1:08:29] the revealed word see that's why this
[1:08:32] has to happen that's why this ministry
[1:08:35] had to happen was so that the scripture
[1:08:37] said the people shall know their god
[1:08:40] so jesus said in luke that in the day
[1:08:42] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:08:45] that that revealing would there would be
[1:08:47] a people on the earth that would come
[1:08:49] under that revealing that they would see
[1:08:51] it they would understand that that was
[1:08:53] god they would know it wasn't uh just
[1:08:55] saul saying or it wouldn't be some
[1:08:58] fantastic something but they would know
[1:09:00] that that was the manifestation of god
[1:09:02] among them amen now of course this is
[1:09:05] speaking of the end time if you go into
[1:09:07] the book of daniel and you go to the
[1:09:08] 12th chapter remember daniel has seen a
[1:09:11] mighty angel stand up and took the book
[1:09:14] he called him michael which is an exact
[1:09:16] a replica of daniel revelations the 10th
[1:09:19] chapter
[1:09:20] and he said go thy way daniel for the
[1:09:23] words are closed and sealed until the
[1:09:25] time of the end and many shall be
[1:09:27] purified in white but the wicked shall
[1:09:29] do wickedly in my if we haven't seen
[1:09:33] when the when the book is opened amen it
[1:09:36] didn't change the wicked one bit
[1:09:39] they continued the same as they've
[1:09:41] always been the world is the same as
[1:09:43] it's always been and if you if you
[1:09:45] sometimes if you like to study these
[1:09:47] kind of things so happens the same time
[1:09:49] that the word is open to the church
[1:09:52] through a prophet that same time that's
[1:09:54] happening america is kicking the bible
[1:09:56] out of the public schools so the so the
[1:09:59] world has done a good charting of the
[1:10:01] increase of sin in america since 1963
[1:10:05] it's a powerful chart if you've never
[1:10:07] saw them you go online and dr google can
[1:10:09] show them to you they're very powerful
[1:10:11] but the the charts of of sin almost it's
[1:10:15] almost like an exact point in 63 goes
[1:10:17] almost straight up because the opening
[1:10:19] of the word didn't help them at all the
[1:10:21] bible said line up online and precept
[1:10:23] upon precept here little and their
[1:10:24] little but see it did not profit them
[1:10:27] any therefore they fell backwards rather
[1:10:29] than it bringing something great it
[1:10:31] actually it actually caused another
[1:10:33] revival and satan actually took from
[1:10:36] that revival and went to the wicked but
[1:10:38] the bible said here the wicked shall do
[1:10:40] wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[1:10:42] understand but the wise shall understand
[1:10:47] but the wise shall understand now i
[1:10:48] don't have time to preach in those
[1:10:50] things but if you go to matthew 25
[1:10:52] there's a wise virgin there who is made
[1:10:54] ready by the voice of malachi 4 the
[1:10:57] knock it came at midnight and so you see
[1:10:59] now again in the time of the opening of
[1:11:02] that book this is daniel now 11 telling
[1:11:04] us the wise is going to understand it's
[1:11:06] not going to change the wicked at all
[1:11:08] but the wise now they're going to
[1:11:09] understand and recognizing acting on the
[1:11:12] word look at brother brahm said hearing
[1:11:14] recognizing acting on the word he says
[1:11:16] now it's promised by daniel that the
[1:11:18] people in these days when the stone hits
[1:11:21] the image in the foot the people shall
[1:11:23] know their god will do exploits now you
[1:11:26] know from daniel 2 that the stone that's
[1:11:28] hewed out the mountain that strikes the
[1:11:30] image of nebuchadnezzar in the feet
[1:11:32] that's the end time that's that's that's
[1:11:35] the message of the hour revelation
[1:11:37] coming into the age to strike the image
[1:11:40] of denomination and in the season that
[1:11:42] that strikes the earth in the season
[1:11:45] that the message comes there'll be
[1:11:46] people on the earth and they will do
[1:11:49] exploits now that word exploits can be
[1:11:51] changed or it can be defined in in
[1:11:53] separate ways but it mainly means action
[1:11:56] or it could mean a great military action
[1:11:59] it's a great action great exploit if you
[1:12:02] if you think about this maybe there's a
[1:12:04] a turkey hunting expo it's a it's where
[1:12:07] they are displaying the things that they
[1:12:09] have and they're trying to get someone
[1:12:11] to see it it's it's someone has
[1:12:13] something and they're displaying it so
[1:12:15] there's going to come a great display
[1:12:17] brother braham said prophecy after
[1:12:19] prophecy seminaries in the world can't
[1:12:21] take it out of it god's going to do it
[1:12:23] anyhow because somebody's going to
[1:12:25] follow it see amen according to
[1:12:27] revelations 10 that in the days of the
[1:12:29] voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:12:31] begins to sound the mystery of god will
[1:12:34] be finished do you see that the mystery
[1:12:37] of god will be finished in that day the
[1:12:39] day of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:12:41] now i often like to say it to be sure
[1:12:43] everybody knows what i'm talking about i
[1:12:46] believe the seventh angel is a man named
[1:12:48] william branham and that seventh angel
[1:12:50] is the same seventh angel of revelation
[1:12:53] chapter three who was the seventh angel
[1:12:55] to the laodicean church and he brought
[1:12:58] the last message he was the seventh star
[1:13:01] in the right hand of him amen do you see
[1:13:04] then that at that time it's the last
[1:13:06] star it's the end time message it's the
[1:13:09] ending of the ages it's the end of
[1:13:11] gentile dispensations you'll be the last
[1:13:15] message that comes the people that hear
[1:13:17] that message the mystery of god will be
[1:13:19] finished to those people brother branham
[1:13:21] said see what it is it'll be god the
[1:13:23] hope of glory shining forth in the
[1:13:25] baptism of the holy ghost when these
[1:13:27] things begin to take place time is going
[1:13:30] to be no more they said they will know
[1:13:32] their god daniel said this that many
[1:13:34] will run to and fro and knowledge will
[1:13:36] be increased but they that know their
[1:13:38] god shall do great exploits they shall
[1:13:40] do exploit see the mystery of god will
[1:13:43] be finished and somebody will be living
[1:13:45] in the season to hear the message of
[1:13:48] that seventh angel and those people that
[1:13:51] hear that message will know their god
[1:13:53] they will understand that's god talking
[1:13:55] to them like the woman at the well not
[1:13:58] theologians not people who are great
[1:14:00] doctors of divinity but simple people
[1:14:03] saw the manifestation of god and had
[1:14:05] something in their heart to say that's
[1:14:07] god they didn't call it the devil they
[1:14:09] didn't call it some beos above something
[1:14:12] in them said that's god that's god
[1:14:14] dealing with us that's god manifesting
[1:14:17] himself and the people that live and
[1:14:19] know that that's god them same people
[1:14:22] will do exploit same in other words the
[1:14:24] action of the word will come into their
[1:14:27] lives because you have received it as
[1:14:29] god then it'll put you in an action amen
[1:14:32] according to the ephesian age brother
[1:14:34] ephesians church age brother of america
[1:14:35] said this that daniel heard the seven
[1:14:38] thunders
[1:14:39] that's what daniel heard was the seven
[1:14:41] thunders that's exactly what happened in
[1:14:44] revelation chapter 10 when the book was
[1:14:46] being opened seven thunders began to
[1:14:48] utter their voice what was it it was
[1:14:50] ending the mystery of god in the season
[1:14:54] of the seventh angel brother branham
[1:14:55] said when he comes he'll guide you to it
[1:14:58] that's the reason of these coming seals
[1:15:00] at the finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:15:03] mystery of god would be finished to know
[1:15:05] who god is
[1:15:07] what he is how he lives his nature his
[1:15:10] being it's all supposed to be way up
[1:15:13] here at that time to bring us into the
[1:15:15] full statures of the sons and daughters
[1:15:18] of god a church that's washed in the
[1:15:20] blood of jesus christ
[1:15:23] he's bringing the manifestation of the
[1:15:26] church in order with this seventh angel
[1:15:29] amen brother bam says it like this when
[1:15:31] the seventh seal is broken the mystery
[1:15:32] of god that's been sealed in the
[1:15:34] mysterious seals will be finished and we
[1:15:37] know this morning that the seventh seal
[1:15:39] was open years ago amen this is a
[1:15:42] historical event from the message what's
[1:15:44] the attraction on the mountain he said
[1:15:46] what was prophecy today is history and
[1:15:49] that's what this attraction is about is
[1:15:52] about what god has done and the church
[1:15:54] has been gathered in by the
[1:15:56] manifestation of god amen it is solved
[1:15:59] it out the mystery has been solved out
[1:16:02] and it's gathered a people to an end
[1:16:04] time message who is feeding on the word
[1:16:06] body of the son of man bringing the
[1:16:09] strength of the son of man into their
[1:16:12] lives bringing the strength of the
[1:16:14] resurrection power into their ministries
[1:16:17] and their lives now according to
[1:16:19] abraham's covenant we are living in the
[1:16:21] season when the covenant of god will
[1:16:24] come into full strength now god released
[1:16:26] a covenant to the church and it's been
[1:16:28] under covenant for 2 000 years but that
[1:16:31] covenant never realized its full power
[1:16:34] or the fullness of its strength uh maybe
[1:16:37] i could just say it to you in this way
[1:16:39] brother madam explains it and he talks
[1:16:41] about in the days of abraham when
[1:16:43] abraham made a covenant unto god and he
[1:16:46] laid him on the altar that he divided
[1:16:48] the the beast that was laid there and
[1:16:51] you remember brother ma'am says but when
[1:16:53] abraham saw the vision he saw the beast
[1:16:56] tore in half there was a white light
[1:16:58] came down in between the beast he said
[1:17:00] now that was a covenant between god and
[1:17:04] man and god was confirming the covenant
[1:17:06] with abraham genesis 15. brother man
[1:17:09] said what it is it's like a man makes a
[1:17:11] covenant now we might shake a hand or
[1:17:13] something but he said in the old
[1:17:15] testament what they would do is they
[1:17:17] would tear a beast in half and speak the
[1:17:19] covenant over a torn body he said and if
[1:17:22] you didn't keep it you would be as that
[1:17:24] torn body but brother branham says but
[1:17:26] see what it was speaking of was the body
[1:17:29] of jesus christ his corporal body would
[1:17:32] be brought to the earth and hung on
[1:17:35] calvary and it would be ripped apart
[1:17:38] in the crucifixion and he said that
[1:17:41] would be god's covenant with mankind
[1:17:43] would be that body the broken body of
[1:17:46] jesus christ he said now he took that
[1:17:49] body and took it into heaven and set it
[1:17:52] in power so that body is sitting there
[1:17:54] today he said but then he took the
[1:17:56] spirit out of that body and sent it back
[1:17:59] to the church so that we are in covenant
[1:18:02] with god he said god's part of the
[1:18:04] covenant is the body he said our part of
[1:18:07] the covenant is the spirit so at the
[1:18:10] season you're living that covenant is to
[1:18:13] come into its full strength what has
[1:18:16] been here in a measure through the ages
[1:18:19] will come into a full strength in the
[1:18:22] last days this is the season of the
[1:18:25] fullness of the display of almighty god
[1:18:28] we have been brought into a full
[1:18:30] strength when the covenant is confirmed
[1:18:33] amen what is it what was in john wesley
[1:18:35] amen what was in martin luther what was
[1:18:38] in pentecost those things amen god never
[1:18:41] lost nothing what was in luther
[1:18:44] collected in john wesley collected in
[1:18:46] pentecost and every bit of that has been
[1:18:49] gathered together in the seed of the
[1:18:52] bride of jesus christ we are not here
[1:18:55] this morning wishing we were back in the
[1:18:57] days of martin luther or john wesley
[1:19:00] this bride has everything they had and
[1:19:03] it's been collected together this
[1:19:06] morning for the fullness of god to dwell
[1:19:09] bodily in the church of the living god
[1:19:11] amen i'll tell you this this is the
[1:19:13] season when the entire plant has given
[1:19:16] strength under the seed the seed is in
[1:19:19] possession of everything good that has
[1:19:21] been throughout the church ages this is
[1:19:24] a season when strength is coming like
[1:19:26] it's never been strength has been poured
[1:19:29] into the church like never before the
[1:19:31] strength of exposition of the power of
[1:19:34] almighty god when i read this i find
[1:19:37] that the bible again if you reflect to
[1:19:39] daniel 11 it said the people that know
[1:19:42] their god shall be strong
[1:19:44] the people that know their god shall be
[1:19:46] strong when them seals were opening they
[1:19:49] were loosening something to dwell into
[1:19:52] the church of the living god we have not
[1:19:55] received god in weakness we have
[1:19:57] received him in the strength and the
[1:20:00] anointing and the power of the very god
[1:20:03] of all creation we are not serving a
[1:20:05] weak god this morning we have not
[1:20:07] received a message that come to us in
[1:20:10] weakness it did not come to us in
[1:20:12] theology but it came in the power and
[1:20:15] the manifestation and the vindication of
[1:20:18] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:20:21] and forever we have received a ministry
[1:20:24] from god as it said in the book of
[1:20:26] second corinthians the fourth chapter he
[1:20:29] said because of this ministry we think
[1:20:31] not
[1:20:32] because we have received this word we
[1:20:35] are not feigning this morning we are not
[1:20:38] barely getting by this morning we are
[1:20:41] not trying amen to rise up but god has
[1:20:44] gave strength back to the church of the
[1:20:47] living god now the strength that she's
[1:20:49] received is the strength of the lord i
[1:20:51] think of david of old a little small
[1:20:54] fellow but he had a lot of strength he
[1:20:56] had a strength and the bible said and
[1:20:59] the lord is the strength and he is my
[1:21:01] shield amen in the 8th verse of psalms
[1:21:04] 28 for the lord is their strength and he
[1:21:07] is the saving strength of the anointed
[1:21:11] in psalms 27 and 1 he said the lord is
[1:21:13] the light of my salvation of whom shall
[1:21:15] i fear the lord is the strength of my
[1:21:19] life
[1:21:20] i'll tell you that's rapture material
[1:21:22] right there amen the only way to get
[1:21:24] strength to change your body is your
[1:21:27] strength has got to come from the lord
[1:21:29] the strength of god is coming into the
[1:21:32] church the strength of our life i think
[1:21:34] about the blessing of a man when his
[1:21:37] strength comes from the lord in psalms
[1:21:39] 84 verses 5 and 7 david said blessed is
[1:21:42] the man whose strength is in thee who
[1:21:45] passing through the valley of baca make
[1:21:47] it as a way on the rain filleth the
[1:21:49] pools they go from strength unto
[1:21:52] strength everyone that appears before
[1:21:55] god they go from strength under strength
[1:21:58] amplified version says it better they go
[1:22:00] from victorious power to victorious
[1:22:02] power amen what is it they are not going
[1:22:05] backwards they are increasing in
[1:22:08] strength they are increasing in victory
[1:22:11] now i know some people say to me all the
[1:22:13] time so brother wayne worrying is you
[1:22:15] seeing an increase of strength in the
[1:22:17] church we've been moving along here for
[1:22:19] a couple years and it seems like maybe
[1:22:21] we're getting a little weaker but we're
[1:22:22] not maybe somebody thinks this morning
[1:22:24] that you're at the end of your rope but
[1:22:26] you thought that two years ago you
[1:22:28] thought that two years and the church
[1:22:30] has come through the hardest times that
[1:22:33] it has ever come through in its ages now
[1:22:35] now now the church in general we've come
[1:22:38] through coved never happened in the
[1:22:40] history of the church amen pastors are
[1:22:42] passing and they're they're pastoring in
[1:22:45] the most divisive age that has ever come
[1:22:48] leadership at an all-time low religion
[1:22:52] amen has come to the place where it
[1:22:54] respects nothing even in our own even in
[1:22:57] our own message some of the leaders who
[1:23:00] who were around the families amen
[1:23:02] started saying that there's no place for
[1:23:04] ministry in the churches and we just
[1:23:06] need to play tapes our pastors are
[1:23:09] fighting the hardest season that has
[1:23:12] ever been in the history of the church
[1:23:14] they're fighting all hell he meant but
[1:23:16] two years ago we thought that maybe we
[1:23:19] couldn't make it another time another
[1:23:21] service but you know what where we are
[1:23:24] two years later
[1:23:26] we're two years later and here we're
[1:23:28] standing and i say today we're standing
[1:23:31] stronger now than we were two years ago
[1:23:34] i say this church is stronger right now
[1:23:38] than it's ever been in the history of
[1:23:40] the church amen we are more stable
[1:23:43] we are more established we are more able
[1:23:46] for the battle than we have ever been in
[1:23:49] the history of the world i tell you i
[1:23:51] don't know how to say it but the best
[1:23:53] way i know how to say it is brother once
[1:23:55] in a while i just pull it out and i say
[1:23:57] satan i'm still here you threw kovac at
[1:24:00] us and we're still here you stood cancer
[1:24:03] at my brother but we're still here
[1:24:06] you've through division you're through
[1:24:08] wars and rumors of ours but you can't
[1:24:11] stop us it ain't gonna be you ain't
[1:24:13] gonna shut this bride up you ain't gonna
[1:24:16] stop this bride god's gonna rapture this
[1:24:19] pride he's gonna take her off of the
[1:24:21] earth in the moment in the twinkling of
[1:24:24] an eye
[1:24:26] we're not here this morning just barely
[1:24:28] making it by the grace of god this is a
[1:24:31] march of victory we are a victorious
[1:24:34] church marching into the glories of god
[1:24:38] i have a prophecy here that says that
[1:24:40] you will know your god and you'll be
[1:24:42] strong amen no wonder it said in the
[1:24:44] book of joshua be thou strong and of
[1:24:47] good courage for god hath given you
[1:24:50] this land
[1:24:52] i'll tell you
[1:24:53] amen i'm i'm the guy i like to go back
[1:24:56] and read and see who it is saying it
[1:24:58] david says it strength
[1:25:00] david talks about the strength
[1:25:02] and i thought my
[1:25:04] david must have had some examples to be
[1:25:06] able to say there was strength then
[1:25:08] there's victorious power and i got to
[1:25:10] looking back and and looking at who in
[1:25:12] the world would have been the the
[1:25:14] examples of this man david well of
[1:25:16] course caleb is one of his greatest
[1:25:17] examples
[1:25:18] caleb in the in the time of david
[1:25:20] wouldn't have been that old since they
[1:25:22] heard of what caleb did and caleb was a
[1:25:25] man who was 85 years old had been
[1:25:28] looking for the promises for 40 years he
[1:25:32] had been sitting there waiting on the
[1:25:34] rest of the church to get catch up with
[1:25:36] him and caleb remember this at 85 years
[1:25:40] old went to my joshua and said when i
[1:25:43] was 45 he said moses made a promise to
[1:25:46] me that i could have the land of hebron
[1:25:48] and here i am 85 years old and i'm a
[1:25:52] strong today for the battle as i was
[1:25:56] come on now he might not been as strong
[1:25:58] as he was he may have had been a little
[1:26:00] weaker he may have got around a little
[1:26:02] more feeble amen things might have been
[1:26:04] a little different around the house he
[1:26:06] might have needed a pair of glasses amen
[1:26:08] we don't know what his physical body but
[1:26:11] for the war for the strength to fight
[1:26:14] the battle he said i'm more strong now
[1:26:17] than i've ever been and i'll tell you
[1:26:19] something this morning amen that caleb
[1:26:22] is an anointing that represents the
[1:26:25] bride of jesus christ brother branham
[1:26:27] said it very clearly he said in the last
[1:26:29] day there will be two great anointings
[1:26:31] joshua and caleb he said joshua will be
[1:26:34] a man a representative of the end time
[1:26:36] messenger and caleb will represent those
[1:26:39] that follow that message
[1:26:42] now it is noteworthy to know the only
[1:26:45] people that went in the land
[1:26:47] was the follower of the message
[1:26:50] it will take the spirit of caleb to
[1:26:53] enter this land
[1:26:54] only caleb went in only caleb followed
[1:26:58] joshua the rest of them had to be raised
[1:27:01] the rest of the generation that went in
[1:27:03] was raised under that spirit and tonight
[1:27:05] we were today we recognize that the
[1:27:07] strength amen for caleb's fight has come
[1:27:11] to the bride of jesus christ i believe
[1:27:13] we're at our season i believe we bypass
[1:27:16] the 40 years of waiting the years of
[1:27:19] toil waiting and waiting and waiting and
[1:27:21] waiting but they that wait upon the lord
[1:27:24] shall renew their strength and i believe
[1:27:26] the waiting is over i believe it's the
[1:27:29] season of the church we have the saith
[1:27:32] the lord
[1:27:34] this is now thus saith the lord the move
[1:27:36] is on
[1:27:38] for the bride
[1:27:40] now wonder no wonder express that the
[1:27:43] mighty angel come out of heaven
[1:27:46] in revelation 10 he's the strong one
[1:27:49] come out of heaven with a book in his
[1:27:51] hand the way he would share his strength
[1:27:54] is through the revelation and the
[1:27:56] anointing of the word of god god is
[1:27:59] sharing the strength of the mighty one
[1:28:02] today and we're feeding on the body word
[1:28:04] of the son of man according to
[1:28:06] revelations 12 in the time of that great
[1:28:09] angelic battle that become a human
[1:28:11] battle in the season whenever satan is
[1:28:14] going to be cast out of heaven what's
[1:28:16] the bible say it said now is come
[1:28:19] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:28:21] of our god has become the kingdom of our
[1:28:24] christ for the accuser of the brethren
[1:28:27] is cast down now we know satan is not
[1:28:29] cast down until this bride goes up but
[1:28:32] with every ascension of you in your
[1:28:35] position with god it is a warfare with
[1:28:38] satan and it's driving him out of the
[1:28:41] position that god hath anointed you to
[1:28:44] be him you have been anointed for
[1:28:46] authority you've been anointed for power
[1:28:49] the sons and the daughters of the most
[1:28:51] high god satan has been trying to hold
[1:28:54] your position but god
[1:28:56] has given to you now salvation and
[1:28:58] strength that they may overcome him by
[1:29:01] the blood of the lamb the word of
[1:29:03] testimony for they loved not their lives
[1:29:06] unto death look at that they wasn't
[1:29:08] scared it's not a scared people and i
[1:29:10] say it fits you
[1:29:12] this fits this bride very well it's a
[1:29:15] perfect size this scripture fits this
[1:29:18] church very well they were not afraid of
[1:29:21] death they were not afraid of the battle
[1:29:24] they were not afraid of what was facing
[1:29:25] them they overcame by the blood of the
[1:29:29] lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:29:33] those people that do know god will be
[1:29:34] strong
[1:29:35] and they will have action they'll do
[1:29:38] exploits exploits means actions you know
[1:29:40] what brother branham said to this church
[1:29:42] he said the first church that come off
[1:29:44] of that vine was a pentecostal church
[1:29:46] with the gifts and they were really if
[1:29:48] it ever puts out another branch they'll
[1:29:50] write another book of acts behind it
[1:29:53] and that's the way they had it in the
[1:29:55] days of the apostles and the apostolic
[1:29:58] age has never ended i say that there's
[1:30:00] one book in the bible that's not
[1:30:02] finished it's the book of acts and we
[1:30:05] are continuing that book today and i
[1:30:08] believe there's a bright chapter in that
[1:30:10] book amen i'll tell you what at times i
[1:30:12] think ron spencer's got a whole chapter
[1:30:14] dedicated to himself amen amen all the
[1:30:17] things that you've went through and
[1:30:18] battled through and the testimonies that
[1:30:20] god's given you that'd be a section
[1:30:22] little section in there about the
[1:30:24] exploits of a man named ron spencer amen
[1:30:26] but i tell you this today it's not just
[1:30:28] brother ron he's got a group behind him
[1:30:31] he's got ministry sitting with him he's
[1:30:33] got a lovely wife that supports him i
[1:30:35] know things are troubled in every way
[1:30:37] but there is spiritual food in due
[1:30:41] season for the hour that we're living in
[1:30:44] it's a continuation revelation that
[1:30:46] jesus christ in the churches book he
[1:30:48] said remember this christ in the true
[1:30:50] church is a continuation
[1:30:53] of the book of acts
[1:30:56] that's right amen what is it a people
[1:30:58] going to follow this they're going to
[1:30:59] have an action the word exploit in one
[1:31:01] word means a maneuver a large-scale
[1:31:05] military exercise of troops and warships
[1:31:08] and other forces isn't it something to
[1:31:11] know that the exploits that is spoken of
[1:31:13] concerning you will be a military effort
[1:31:17] that you are the church of the living
[1:31:19] god but you are warriors every one of
[1:31:21] you every man woman child every elder
[1:31:24] every young person you are a warrior i
[1:31:27] thought of it such as in israel they
[1:31:29] live in such a realm that where the
[1:31:31] muslims are constantly trying to push
[1:31:33] them out everybody has to go to the army
[1:31:36] everybody has to fight and let me say
[1:31:38] today as the church of the living god
[1:31:41] not one of you is in a place where you
[1:31:43] won't have to war not one of you is in a
[1:31:45] place where you won't have to make a
[1:31:47] decision to war against the enemy that
[1:31:50] we are fighting let me say this i
[1:31:52] believe i believe there's a great
[1:31:54] exercise going on today i believe
[1:31:56] there's a church that's moving into the
[1:31:59] realms of the holy ghost do you know the
[1:32:02] canaan land that was typed in the book
[1:32:04] of joshua is not the millennium
[1:32:07] the canaan land is a age of overcoming
[1:32:10] the promised land of the holy ghost and
[1:32:13] the overcomers that go into that land we
[1:32:16] are not fighting for a natural land we
[1:32:19] are fighting for a spiritual land
[1:32:21] and the promises that lay in that land
[1:32:24] that belong to us we've got to go get
[1:32:27] them now if it's a if it's a symbol and
[1:32:29] we're going to look back in the shadows
[1:32:32] in the days of joshua and caleb when
[1:32:33] they went to look they saw the land just
[1:32:36] like moses said it was he said it was
[1:32:38] grapes and it was milk and it was honey
[1:32:40] and it was like those grapes were so big
[1:32:42] amen they had to get they had to get
[1:32:44] poles to haul them back took two men to
[1:32:47] haul back a cluster of grapes and when
[1:32:49] they got back with them amen them bunch
[1:32:51] of silly spies amen that was looking at
[1:32:54] the conditions of the land begin to say
[1:32:56] hey look it's got milk and honey just
[1:32:58] like god said but we can't take the land
[1:33:01] we're not able to do it we're a bunch of
[1:33:03] grasshoppers and there's a bunch of
[1:33:04] giants over there and we're not able to
[1:33:06] do it but here's the milk and honey that
[1:33:09] is there here's the greats it's a proof
[1:33:12] of what god said was there now brother
[1:33:14] branham took that and he said see that
[1:33:16] milk and honey was an evidence of that
[1:33:19] other land it was an evidence he said
[1:33:21] but there's giants in the land so it's
[1:33:23] up to you are you going to let a giant
[1:33:26] stop you are you going to take the
[1:33:28] evidence and say that land belongs to us
[1:33:31] it's up to you it's up to what are you
[1:33:34] going to look at this morning are you
[1:33:35] going to look at the giants are you
[1:33:37] going to see the evidence of the land
[1:33:40] and go take the land i'll tell you with
[1:33:42] everything there is a war with every
[1:33:44] promise that god made there's a war and
[1:33:46] there's a giant for that land there's a
[1:33:48] giant living there there's a giant that
[1:33:50] you're going to destroy brother man said
[1:33:52] divine healing he said is a is a promise
[1:33:55] that's in this land but there's giants
[1:33:57] in the land of divine healing but we
[1:33:59] have enough evidence this morning to
[1:34:02] stand here all day long
[1:34:04] and tell you that divine healing is the
[1:34:07] truth
[1:34:08] and every giant that is raised up in
[1:34:10] that land listen i want y'all to know
[1:34:12] something today our giants are not
[1:34:14] giants like they were in the days of
[1:34:15] joshua our giants are scarecrows
[1:34:18] they're already defeated
[1:34:20] they're already defeated this morning
[1:34:23] our giants cannot defeat you unless you
[1:34:27] fear them that's the only hope they have
[1:34:30] but there's a church who knows their god
[1:34:32] who knows their promises and they will
[1:34:35] not back out of the promise because of a
[1:34:37] giant
[1:34:40] that makes a difference what you're
[1:34:42] looking at
[1:34:43] i'll tell you what brother branham said
[1:34:44] about it i thought it was powerful i was
[1:34:46] reading here the other day in the book a
[1:34:47] message called exodus brother bram said
[1:34:49] they come back with that milk and honey
[1:34:51] he said the evidence of that land and
[1:34:52] when they got back with it he said oh my
[1:34:55] he said that make us up a good
[1:34:56] pentecostal cocktail
[1:34:58] amen now some of you probably never
[1:35:00] lived a life to know what a cocktail was
[1:35:01] but i happened to not have the same
[1:35:03] testimony i knew what cocktails were and
[1:35:06] and i knew people mix things up and and
[1:35:09] a good cocktail is one that'll
[1:35:10] intoxicate you a little bit and brother
[1:35:12] madam was saying the evidences they had
[1:35:15] should have intoxicated the church of
[1:35:17] the living god and the milk and honey
[1:35:21] that has come out of that land in our
[1:35:23] generation brother we are to be the
[1:35:25] drunkest crowd on the face of the earth
[1:35:28] there shouldn't be a sober person in the
[1:35:31] church of the living god we ought to be
[1:35:33] drunk with the intoxication of the power
[1:35:36] of the holy ghost that's been seen in
[1:35:38] this age oh i tell you what if you want
[1:35:41] to get a little bit drunk just pick up a
[1:35:43] couple of testimonies of how god saved
[1:35:46] ron spencer out of the fire and just
[1:35:48] start drinking and after a little while
[1:35:51] you feel like dancing and thinking about
[1:35:53] what a mighty god that we serve what
[1:35:56] about that god that we saw raised ken
[1:35:58] boyer up out there in calgary in order
[1:36:00] to intoxicate you what about the the
[1:36:03] grace our brother robert douglas the
[1:36:05] other day spent months in the hospital
[1:36:07] they did a trach surgery took him off i
[1:36:10] mean he was at the bottom of the bottom
[1:36:13] amen took him months amen and went into
[1:36:16] a rehab and last sunday morning i
[1:36:18] preached to him at the church he come in
[1:36:20] and sat down amen in order to intoxicate
[1:36:23] the church to know there's some giants
[1:36:26] in the land
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:28] but there's some milk and honey in the
[1:36:30] land too
[1:36:31] and if the church begins to drink of the
[1:36:34] cocktail of the milk and honey of god it
[1:36:37] will intoxicate them to make them look
[1:36:39] at things differently than they used to
[1:36:42] you know brother brown tells a story
[1:36:44] about this same area he says it like
[1:36:46] this he said there was a fellow over the
[1:36:48] ymca the other day he said no drunk fell
[1:36:50] down in the in the in the in the road he
[1:36:52] said he fell down out there he said we
[1:36:54] picked him up and he said i think it was
[1:36:56] no salvation army he said they picked
[1:36:58] him up and somebody said are you going
[1:37:00] to take him over to the doctor for
[1:37:01] hypothermia he passed out in the street
[1:37:03] and it's about 30 something degrees out
[1:37:05] there and brother brother graham said
[1:37:07] the fella said oh no he said there's no
[1:37:09] need to take him to the doctor he said
[1:37:11] the man's so intoxicated he said that
[1:37:13] his blood is running with alcohol you
[1:37:15] couldn't freeze him if you wanted to he
[1:37:17] said you know i think that the church
[1:37:19] ought to get a little back he said in
[1:37:21] these cold conditions that we're in
[1:37:23] today i think if we get intoxicated with
[1:37:26] the power of god you couldn't freeze the
[1:37:29] church out you can't freeze out the
[1:37:31] church of the living god things are
[1:37:33] getting cold but the church is drinking
[1:37:36] from the evidence of the revelation of
[1:37:38] the age that she's living in and the
[1:37:41] more she drinks the bigger she gets the
[1:37:44] more she drinks the stronger she gets i
[1:37:47] tell you she turns six foot tall and
[1:37:50] bulletproof brother she gets invincible
[1:37:53] amen and i believe today it's an
[1:37:55] invincible church the church of the
[1:37:57] living god amen i tell you what i've not
[1:38:00] chose to look at the giants i have chose
[1:38:02] to look at the evidences of god coming
[1:38:05] down in our meetings but the power of
[1:38:07] the holy ghost i think what we need is a
[1:38:10] drunk church i think they care less
[1:38:12] about the troubles and situations i
[1:38:15] think it would matter less of what
[1:38:17] happened in the church y'all know y'all
[1:38:19] know hey man best way to get along with
[1:38:21] the drunks get drunk with him
[1:38:25] maybe somebody in here is born thanks to
[1:38:27] a bunch of crazy people well if you as a
[1:38:28] drink and what eyes are drinking
[1:38:31] if you as a feeling when i'm a feeling
[1:38:33] if you're thinking the way i'm thinking
[1:38:35] i'm thinking about a god who could come
[1:38:38] down in a church and fill hearts and
[1:38:41] lies with the power of the holy ghost i
[1:38:44] might not be a sensible man but i'll
[1:38:46] tell you what i am i'm a free man i'm
[1:38:49] free of tradition i'm free of religion
[1:38:52] i'm free of sin god has filled me with
[1:38:55] the holy ghost and fire
[1:39:01] glory to god what an hour to live
[1:39:05] oh if we could see it right now there's
[1:39:06] an unfolding light moving down over the
[1:39:09] church a glory of his presence
[1:39:12] what you're going to look at that's what
[1:39:14] matters don't it it matters what you're
[1:39:16] looking at but the brand said that was
[1:39:18] the difference between joshua and caleb
[1:39:21] and the rest of the crowd
[1:39:23] what they looked at
[1:39:26] now
[1:39:27] they already had milk and honey
[1:39:29] when joshua come back
[1:39:31] he looked them giants over and he said
[1:39:33] there's our bread
[1:39:35] i got some he said them them giants are
[1:39:38] bred for us
[1:39:40] he had milk and honey he just needed
[1:39:42] some bread to go with it and to him the
[1:39:45] bread of the lamb was the giant because
[1:39:47] joshua was a warrior caleb was a warrior
[1:39:51] they were they were battle hungry they
[1:39:53] wanted an enemy they they needed to take
[1:39:56] their sword and defend the land they had
[1:39:58] something in them and let me say
[1:40:00] something to you they were typing you
[1:40:03] every one of you this morning sitting
[1:40:05] here as a as a battle warrior laying on
[1:40:08] the inside it's not the size of the dog
[1:40:11] that's in the fight it's the size of the
[1:40:14] fight that's in the dog and our great
[1:40:17] warrior joshua is in the heart of every
[1:40:20] believer this morning hey there's a man
[1:40:23] standing there with authority and with
[1:40:25] power and the giants of the land are
[1:40:28] bred under the church
[1:40:31] you want to feed some bread amen just
[1:40:33] start telling the testimonies of how you
[1:40:35] overcame and how you overcame and how
[1:40:38] you overcame you sit around the table
[1:40:40] and start telling them how god came into
[1:40:42] your life and conquered temptation how
[1:40:45] he conquered that disease i conquered
[1:40:47] this problem and after a while you fed
[1:40:50] you brought the bread to melchizedek you
[1:40:52] brought the bread to elohim after a
[1:40:54] little while something stares up on the
[1:40:57] inside of you a warrior awakens
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:02] oh ain't nobody going in this but a
[1:41:04] joshua caleb
[1:41:06] and i tell you what about these guys
[1:41:08] they wasn't going to give their part up
[1:41:11] they wasn't going to give their pardon
[1:41:13] you wasn't going to force them out of it
[1:41:15] you weren't going to take it away from
[1:41:16] them amen and i feel the same this
[1:41:18] morning i tell you there's been a
[1:41:20] thousand devils reason up and tell us
[1:41:23] why we shouldn't go forward they've even
[1:41:25] made videos about us made videos about
[1:41:27] your pastor about any man of god nearly
[1:41:29] now they're putting videos out against
[1:41:31] us and they're charging at us against
[1:41:34] they didn't do that when i was a drunk
[1:41:38] it's got to be the devil
[1:41:41] when i was a drunk nobody preached
[1:41:43] against me nobody made videos against me
[1:41:45] but when god took me in his hand and
[1:41:48] started delivering hearts all of a
[1:41:50] sudden the devil said we better stop
[1:41:52] that guy we better get that guy stopped
[1:41:55] [Applause]
[1:41:58] i tell you what you better be careful if
[1:41:59] you're on the wrong side of it because
[1:42:01] you'll find out you're fighting against
[1:42:04] god's mighty men in the last days i know
[1:42:07] it's written in the bible but the bible
[1:42:09] is alive this morning it's not just a
[1:42:12] history book there are men sons and
[1:42:15] daughters of god who are walking the
[1:42:17] same trails believing the same word i
[1:42:20] know they're trying to stop us in every
[1:42:21] way but i'm not giving up my land
[1:42:25] i'm not giving up my land there's giants
[1:42:27] the further we get in this the more
[1:42:28] critics we're going to get the farther
[1:42:30] we move in the anointing the more people
[1:42:32] going to call it's pentecostal they're
[1:42:34] going to call us every name they can
[1:42:35] figure amen but they're going to have to
[1:42:37] do what they can do because i'm not
[1:42:39] going to quit i'm not going to stop
[1:42:41] matter of fact i'm going to pull my
[1:42:43] sword and cut through every philistine
[1:42:45] that has camped itself around the waters
[1:42:48] of the living god
[1:42:50] so what are you talking about by the way
[1:42:51] i'm talking about this i'm talking about
[1:42:53] we're not leaving our land
[1:42:55] we're not getting out of this land we're
[1:42:56] going to fight
[1:42:58] because a prophet said we could have it
[1:43:04] now that's what the prophet said do you
[1:43:06] know joshua was to give the land to the
[1:43:08] believers y'all know that you know they
[1:43:10] divided the land by lots
[1:43:12] and they and joshua gave them that land
[1:43:14] and once they were given that land
[1:43:16] according to what moses said those men
[1:43:19] had a right to fight anybody for them
[1:43:23] now i'm not going to teach on caleb this
[1:43:25] morning but it was amazing that caleb
[1:43:27] actually is a gentile
[1:43:30] and he's fighting for land that belongs
[1:43:32] to israel
[1:43:33] but he's been inducted in the army
[1:43:37] i studied down here a while back and i
[1:43:38] thought dear god what one of them tribes
[1:43:40] opened up and led a gentile dog into its
[1:43:44] tribe to bring see that's the problem
[1:43:46] with adoption back in that day that's
[1:43:48] why they didn't want ruth right because
[1:43:50] the inheritance would be corrupted by
[1:43:52] the gentile seedlings because if if if
[1:43:54] that land belonged to to the tribe then
[1:43:57] somebody moved into it they'd become an
[1:43:59] inheritor in the land and it was an
[1:44:01] eternal inheritance and here caleb as a
[1:44:04] gentile is moving into this land and i
[1:44:06] thought dear god who let that gentile
[1:44:08] into that land but if you keep reading
[1:44:10] the bible said that caleb was of the
[1:44:13] tribe of judah
[1:44:16] i said oh my goodness the tribe of judah
[1:44:19] that's the same tribe that let ruth in
[1:44:22] that's the same tribe amen that let that
[1:44:25] that little moabite come right into the
[1:44:27] tribe of judah what was it it's because
[1:44:30] that our jesus has come from the land
[1:44:34] the tribe of judah and made an access
[1:44:37] for every man woman or child to become
[1:44:40] the seed of abraham and as the seed of
[1:44:42] abraham we have acclaimed to the
[1:44:44] promises of abraham
[1:44:48] so when the prophet promises you
[1:44:50] something you got a right to fight for
[1:44:51] it
[1:44:53] now
[1:44:54] i'll tell you something right quick
[1:44:56] caleb had this promise given to him by
[1:44:58] moses
[1:44:59] and he knew his promise
[1:45:01] you know what to be honest to be to be
[1:45:03] fair
[1:45:04] caleb didn't have any deed to that land
[1:45:06] at all
[1:45:08] all he has what a prophet said
[1:45:10] somebody said well can you find that in
[1:45:12] the scripture he said well the prophet
[1:45:13] said it
[1:45:17] prophet said it
[1:45:21] see sometimes people they want more
[1:45:23] evidence than is necessary
[1:45:28] they want you to prove things to them
[1:45:29] that is settled with you
[1:45:33] prove to us well you can do these things
[1:45:35] i don't need to prove it to you
[1:45:37] [Applause]
[1:45:38] the prophet said it would happen the
[1:45:40] prophet said these people that know
[1:45:42] their god will do exploits
[1:45:44] no wonder they had to be battle men
[1:45:47] because every devil in hell is going to
[1:45:48] try to keep them out of this exercise
[1:45:51] they're going to try to move them off of
[1:45:53] those grounds but see
[1:45:55] he had what the prophet said about it
[1:45:57] now the problem with what the prophet
[1:45:58] said that gave caleb the land of hebron
[1:46:01] and anybody that studies knows knows
[1:46:04] that hebron was where the giants were
[1:46:08] the giants were there because
[1:46:10] that the biggest men in canaan took the
[1:46:13] best ground
[1:46:15] they fought and took the best the big
[1:46:17] giants is kind of like somebody says a
[1:46:19] guy seven foot fall seven foot four and
[1:46:21] weigh 342 pounds where does he sit
[1:46:24] where he wants to
[1:46:29] those giants lived where they wanted to
[1:46:32] and they were used to taking what they
[1:46:34] wanted doing what they wanted and nobody
[1:46:37] had strength to resist them because
[1:46:40] everybody was the same but when these
[1:46:42] men come over there they were a
[1:46:45] circumcised bunch
[1:46:47] they were the seed of abraham and there
[1:46:49] was a different strength that was in
[1:46:51] their life their strength was not in
[1:46:53] their in their genetics their strength
[1:46:55] was not in their bodies or in their
[1:46:57] muscles their strength was in the
[1:46:59] promises of jehovah god and they knew
[1:47:02] god said that you should possess the
[1:47:04] gates of your enemies and by that force
[1:47:07] and promise they could move upon their
[1:47:09] enemies amen now it's a beautiful it's a
[1:47:11] beautiful study and i'm not taking long
[1:47:13] in it but i will say that brother
[1:47:15] branham says joshua parallels ephesians
[1:47:18] in ephesians 1 and verse 11 paul said
[1:47:21] that we have obtained an inheritance
[1:47:23] now if you if you study that it's
[1:47:25] actually the only way obtained inherits
[1:47:27] the word inheritance is translated here
[1:47:30] in the greek differently than everywhere
[1:47:32] else in the greek inheritance and this
[1:47:34] word inheritance means divided by lots
[1:47:37] and it's amazing that a prophet would
[1:47:39] say ephesians parallels joshua and when
[1:47:42] paul uses the greek word he actually
[1:47:45] describes the dividing of our
[1:47:47] inheritance the same as it was done in
[1:47:50] the days of joshua they meant nowhere
[1:47:52] else is it inheritance described this
[1:47:54] way but it was something that was given
[1:47:56] to you by lot amen and an inheritance
[1:47:58] was given somebody said well i didn't do
[1:48:00] anything that's the point you are
[1:48:02] predestinated to an inheritance
[1:48:05] amen what was my inheritance brother
[1:48:06] wayne that your name was put on the
[1:48:09] lamb's book of life from before the
[1:48:11] foundation of the world therefore the
[1:48:13] blood of jesus did not save you brother
[1:48:16] adam said it kept you saved your
[1:48:18] inheritance was there before the world
[1:48:21] was here
[1:48:22] before there was sin there was a savior
[1:48:25] before you ever failed there was a blood
[1:48:28] in the mind of god that could get you
[1:48:30] back where you come from now adoption
[1:48:32] paragraph three brother brown said god
[1:48:34] chose us and let jesus come and pay the
[1:48:36] price the shedding of his blood so that
[1:48:39] no sin could be accounted to you for
[1:48:42] nothing
[1:48:44] nothing you do
[1:48:48] now i know that's hard on the legalist
[1:48:49] but my goodness what a power in the hand
[1:48:52] of a believer
[1:48:54] amen because every time you rise up to
[1:48:56] do something for god that's where the
[1:48:58] problem comes it's not what somebody
[1:49:00] else has done is what you've done and
[1:49:02] satan tries his best to cancel your
[1:49:05] authority and your power by bringing up
[1:49:08] your history or by bringing up your
[1:49:10] carnality or bringing up your humanity
[1:49:13] but a prophet is saying your inheritance
[1:49:15] that you would be assigned was before
[1:49:17] the world began and jesus paid the blood
[1:49:21] that the inheritance would stand true
[1:49:24] in this season so that satan could not
[1:49:26] attribute
[1:49:29] now you said what was my inheritance
[1:49:31] it's to be a son of god of course
[1:49:33] your inheritance is to be a son of god
[1:49:36] or a daughter of god see this
[1:49:39] inheritance is the sonship and that
[1:49:41] sonship means that you were made in the
[1:49:44] image of god can i just make it real
[1:49:47] simple here ye are gods
[1:49:51] jesus said it is written year of gods
[1:49:54] psalms 82 and 6 david said it ye are
[1:49:56] gods and of the children of the most
[1:49:58] high
[1:49:59] see you are little gods
[1:50:02] amateur gods in genesis 1 and 26 we were
[1:50:06] given dominion to rule this earth in our
[1:50:09] origin when god created us he created us
[1:50:13] in his image he was god of the universe
[1:50:16] and you were god of the earth
[1:50:19] but satan he came against that position
[1:50:22] and brought sin and held dominion over
[1:50:25] eve by her failures but jesus said i'm
[1:50:28] coming one day and i'm going to take it
[1:50:30] away from satan and oh my god in the
[1:50:34] garden of gethsemane he undone what
[1:50:36] satan done in the garden of eden and
[1:50:39] repossess the blessing of the church by
[1:50:42] the blood of jesus christ
[1:50:45] he put you heir to all of it so that he
[1:50:47] could say to you that you are the
[1:50:49] offsprings of almighty god
[1:50:52] you are amateur gods do you realize
[1:50:55] brother graham said this may choke you
[1:50:56] to death but men and women that are sons
[1:50:58] of god are amateur gods
[1:51:01] they're amateur gods he said we're
[1:51:03] waiting for the fullness of time later
[1:51:05] in the paragraph when the pyramid gets
[1:51:07] to the top when full sons of god will be
[1:51:10] manifested when the power of god will
[1:51:12] walk out hallelujah and take every power
[1:51:15] that satan has got away from him hey it
[1:51:18] belongs to him
[1:51:20] it belongs to you
[1:51:22] to take every power satan has away from
[1:51:25] him in adoption part four brother
[1:51:28] branham says it very clearly he was a
[1:51:30] low gospel of god that's true he was the
[1:51:32] son of god then he was made a little god
[1:51:36] isn't it beautiful that jesus came into
[1:51:39] our sphere from a big god to a little
[1:51:42] god brother adam said he was the first
[1:51:45] little god without sin he was a little
[1:51:48] god that came without sin that he might
[1:51:51] make the rest of you little gods sinless
[1:51:54] he took our sin upon him amen that he
[1:51:57] would be able to turn in our kind of
[1:51:59] body look at his disciples and say unto
[1:52:02] them i say unto you little gods
[1:52:04] whatsoever thing you say it shall be
[1:52:07] done as you have spoken it if you say
[1:52:09] unto this mountain be moved it shall be
[1:52:11] moved in the name of the lord you see
[1:52:14] how the devil's moved in on that promise
[1:52:16] you see how he's done that had to build
[1:52:18] a scarecrow around that so we've had
[1:52:20] people take off with that and feel
[1:52:22] impressed and they think something are
[1:52:23] to be that way so they just say it out
[1:52:25] and name it claim it and all that kind
[1:52:27] of thing that's not what a prophet was
[1:52:28] talking about they made a mockery out of
[1:52:31] that and put a giant in that land so as
[1:52:34] far as when somebody preaches it that
[1:52:37] people sitting in the congregations will
[1:52:39] draw back a little to figure out what
[1:52:41] he's talking about amen but i don't know
[1:52:44] about you but if god gave that to the
[1:52:46] church i believe we can possess that i
[1:52:49] believe the church can possess it this
[1:52:51] morning with the power of the spoken
[1:52:54] word
[1:52:56] now i have to say some things once in a
[1:52:59] while while i'm preaching i i will say
[1:53:00] this i'll say that not everybody in this
[1:53:02] church is going to probably speak a
[1:53:04] squirrel
[1:53:05] i don't believe maybe everybody in this
[1:53:06] church is going to speak a storm i i
[1:53:09] don't i don't really figure it will be
[1:53:10] that way my contention is not that every
[1:53:13] one of you is going to speak and create
[1:53:15] by the word my contention is the
[1:53:17] potential to do so is in every believer
[1:53:21] sitting in this building you cannot take
[1:53:23] it away from the church as a possession
[1:53:26] or as an inheritance because if god
[1:53:30] moves they meant from the child to an
[1:53:33] elder whether it be a preacher or a
[1:53:35] widow woman god can use the spoken word
[1:53:38] out of the mouth of children amen and
[1:53:41] now the mouth of babes god can use it i
[1:53:44] say unto you brother baby said little
[1:53:46] gods
[1:53:49] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:53:51] when true sons bore sons
[1:53:53] they move field sons will speak
[1:53:55] and their word is backed
[1:53:58] my
[1:53:59] brother madam will tell us this in the
[1:54:01] days of the manifestation of the sons of
[1:54:03] god
[1:54:04] in israel in the church he said i
[1:54:06] believe there's a church on the road
[1:54:07] tonight a power of the living god where
[1:54:09] men will speak the word and it'll flash
[1:54:12] like lightning a church is coming out
[1:54:14] not a psychologist not some put on not
[1:54:17] some make-believe but a real true
[1:54:20] genuine anointed holy ghost god called
[1:54:23] church
[1:54:25] my when brother branham begins to
[1:54:26] declare this
[1:54:28] he's starting to show you that it's not
[1:54:30] a psychology it's not a mental workup
[1:54:33] it's the power of the living god jehovah
[1:54:36] jireh paragraph 63 mother man said now
[1:54:39] he has no eyes but mine and yours he has
[1:54:42] no hands but mine and yours he energizes
[1:54:45] us and brings forth life and it brings
[1:54:48] it through us whether it's preaching the
[1:54:51] gospel by lip
[1:54:52] or seeing the vision by eye
[1:54:55] wherever it is laying hands on the sick
[1:54:58] whatever it is it's christ working
[1:55:01] through the branches of his church every
[1:55:04] office literally electrified by his
[1:55:07] presence
[1:55:08] i'll tell you have you ever been in a
[1:55:10] service where you were just electrified
[1:55:13] with the electrifying presence of god
[1:55:15] just comes in the church and unctions of
[1:55:18] the power of god just moves to the being
[1:55:21] and the church is moved under the
[1:55:23] utterance and atmosphere of god where
[1:55:25] all things can take place where anything
[1:55:28] can happen
[1:55:29] i believe that's the kind of medium
[1:55:30] we're in this morning i believe anything
[1:55:33] could take place in this meeting i
[1:55:35] believe sons and daughters of god's
[1:55:36] setting under the atmosphere of faith
[1:55:39] anything could take place god sends a
[1:55:41] pulsation and the power of faith reaches
[1:55:44] out and things begin to change
[1:55:46] i believe things can change in one
[1:55:48] meeting i think believe things can
[1:55:50] change in one phrase
[1:55:52] amen right in one prayer line the lost
[1:55:54] and lies will change forever in a moment
[1:55:57] in just a moment in time when the spirit
[1:56:00] of the lord spoke to brother ron we are
[1:56:02] forever changed by that word that was
[1:56:05] spoken in that moment in time now you
[1:56:07] can't take that away from my family and
[1:56:09] say well that was just some little
[1:56:11] something or some psychologist or
[1:56:13] something like that we've got a baby we
[1:56:15] live with every day to remind us of the
[1:56:18] god that we serve is a reality and when
[1:56:22] i come to church i'm not coming to
[1:56:24] church just to entertain a religion or
[1:56:27] some kind of a tradition i have come to
[1:56:29] worship a god who could change anything
[1:56:32] anyway anytime anyplace amen you may
[1:56:35] have come here this morning and think
[1:56:37] everything is the way it is and it's
[1:56:39] always going to be that way but as a
[1:56:41] servant in the name of the lord i tell
[1:56:44] you that god can change this very
[1:56:47] morning your lives can change your
[1:56:51] hearts could change
[1:56:53] i believe it's a season of change i
[1:56:55] believe it's the hour to change
[1:56:57] i believe there's joshuas and caleb's
[1:57:00] rising up in this age getting ready amen
[1:57:03] you say well brother wayne that was the
[1:57:04] days of brother brown
[1:57:06] this is a different day well i tell you
[1:57:08] in in the message of the fifth seal
[1:57:10] brother bam says something and you've
[1:57:12] heard this quote for years he said i
[1:57:14] believe the hour is approaching
[1:57:15] when missing limbs will be restored and
[1:57:18] the glorious power of the creator
[1:57:21] i believe he can make a squirrel
[1:57:23] and he said here a man or woman missing
[1:57:25] a part that's a complete animal in
[1:57:27] itself
[1:57:28] he's telling you i believe the
[1:57:29] atmosphere and the way of the word
[1:57:32] coming in that you'll not be sitting in
[1:57:35] a service and a limb
[1:57:37] be restored on you that's why i don't
[1:57:39] know if that could happen
[1:57:40] we're supposed to be the rapturing bride
[1:57:43] we are believing that our bodies will be
[1:57:46] changed from our toes to our head how
[1:57:49] much easier would it be for god to just
[1:57:52] grow and limb onto our body because he
[1:57:55] is god because he is god he's the god
[1:57:58] that created the body he's a god that
[1:58:01] could use you to change the situation of
[1:58:04] the body that you're in now i'll tell
[1:58:06] you why brother brahm said that why he
[1:58:08] said mr limbs would be added he tells a
[1:58:10] testimony right in front of it
[1:58:12] he's talking about the creative act of
[1:58:13] god he said it was a young girl come in
[1:58:15] my office this morning i think it was a
[1:58:17] young girl and he said i believe his
[1:58:18] mother brought her in there he said she
[1:58:20] brought her in the back he said the
[1:58:21] little girl was suffering with leukemia
[1:58:23] he said her blood had leukemia in it and
[1:58:26] he said the doctors can't do anything to
[1:58:27] help him he said but under prayer he
[1:58:30] said the holy spirit did something and
[1:58:32] he said he changed the very atoms he
[1:58:35] recreated the blood cells i believe the
[1:58:37] way he said it he said he recreated the
[1:58:39] blood cells that the leukemia couldn't
[1:58:41] affect the little girl no more he said
[1:58:43] she's sitting back there healed and then
[1:58:45] he come and said this about that and i
[1:58:47] thought look what the way he applied
[1:58:49] that was that the blood cell was changed
[1:58:52] and you and now
[1:58:53] this is for the glory of god i sat in
[1:58:55] the norway back a few years ago
[1:58:57] preaching a message on the seven stars
[1:58:59] of the last days and i was showing that
[1:59:02] when the hand was open the stars were
[1:59:04] being revealed i i showed it from the
[1:59:06] thunders the thunders revealed the
[1:59:07] symbols and when and when they read it
[1:59:09] in revelations 1 it was said and under
[1:59:12] the star or the angel of the church of
[1:59:14] laodicea and i was showing if john would
[1:59:17] have wrote that now it would read and
[1:59:21] unto william branham the church of the
[1:59:23] laodiceans i write this because william
[1:59:26] branham was the star the seventh star in
[1:59:29] the hand when i said that a lady with
[1:59:31] leukemia been fighting in a couple of
[1:59:33] years and she was sitting back in the
[1:59:35] back she had her she had a thing over
[1:59:37] her hair with a chemo had took in her
[1:59:38] hair and back she was she was a sick
[1:59:40] lady amen and that woman sitting there a
[1:59:43] year later now i come back to that same
[1:59:45] camp meeting and she corners me in the
[1:59:48] lunch room she said brother lawson i've
[1:59:49] been waiting a long time to tell you
[1:59:51] this she said last year you were
[1:59:52] preaching a certain sermon i said i
[1:59:54] remember it since she said when you said
[1:59:56] the words william branham is the seventh
[1:59:59] star of the whole night of god she said
[2:00:02] there was a warm feeling started moving
[2:00:04] over my body
[2:00:06] she said that leukemia was completely
[2:00:09] healed brother lawson she said i am for
[2:00:11] cancer for now listen to me two years
[2:00:15] she was fighting it with chemo but in
[2:00:17] one moment god came by and the whole
[2:00:20] thing was changed
[2:00:23] now i'm just crazy enough to believe
[2:00:26] that if god did it fair he can do it
[2:00:28] here if god did it anywhere he's still
[2:00:32] god i believe god can recreate the blood
[2:00:35] i believe god can change bodies
[2:00:37] [Applause]
[2:00:39] we're not here this morning to play with
[2:00:41] the devil you're the church of the
[2:00:43] living god and this means war the church
[2:00:47] is in war with satan this morning we are
[2:00:50] warring against this enemy we've got a
[2:00:53] right to war against this enemy he
[2:00:55] created the first squirrel he can create
[2:00:57] the next one he created the first frog
[2:01:00] he could create the next one he created
[2:01:02] the body he could create a limb to the
[2:01:04] body he created the blood he can change
[2:01:07] the blood he is almighty god
[2:01:12] now
[2:01:13] i understand it would take deity to do
[2:01:15] it
[2:01:16] but deity is in your body
[2:01:18] you are the temple of the dynamics of
[2:01:21] almighty god
[2:01:22] deity lives in the church
[2:01:26] i believe it's time this morning to cut
[2:01:28] loose
[2:01:29] i think it's time to cut loose a
[2:01:31] tradition
[2:01:32] it's time to cut loose of everything
[2:01:34] that says that god cannot completely
[2:01:37] change the situation in your life this
[2:01:39] morning
[2:01:41] i know mr putin over there thinks that
[2:01:43] he's the most powerful thing in the
[2:01:45] earth but i beg to differ with him this
[2:01:47] morning
[2:01:48] mr putin is not the most powerful his
[2:01:51] weapons are not the most powerful i tell
[2:01:53] you the prophet of god said this i find
[2:01:55] the greatest power in the world it's not
[2:01:57] an atomic bomb it's a believer in
[2:02:00] contact with his maker
[2:02:02] i feel a contact this morning i feel an
[2:02:05] electricity moving to the church of the
[2:02:08] living god in contact with the one that
[2:02:11] can change everything
[2:02:12] now i know i know a man that there's a
[2:02:16] lot of a lot of
[2:02:17] of enemy there's a lot of giants in our
[2:02:20] lands but brother branham said the power
[2:02:22] that's in you could create a world and
[2:02:24] go live on it
[2:02:26] if it wasn't a law you remember the
[2:02:28] quote don't you but this is the part
[2:02:30] that got me
[2:02:31] he said listen whatever god will lead
[2:02:33] your soul to believe
[2:02:35] that is yours
[2:02:36] every place the souls of your foot can
[2:02:39] set by faith god gives it to you brother
[2:02:41] branham likened joshua's footprint
[2:02:44] on the land
[2:02:46] with god put it in in your heart to
[2:02:48] believe
[2:02:49] amen now when god puts it in your heart
[2:02:52] to believe it there's still going to be
[2:02:54] a war
[2:02:55] there's still going to be a battle
[2:02:57] something's going to say to you tomorrow
[2:02:58] did you really get that experience
[2:03:00] yesterday did was that god really dealt
[2:03:02] with you would god really speak to you
[2:03:05] what's that situation really over is god
[2:03:08] really delivering me this because see
[2:03:10] satan now after something happens he's
[2:03:12] going to come right back around and do
[2:03:14] everything he can do to take it from you
[2:03:17] because he's a robber
[2:03:20] now there's a reason the bums are safe
[2:03:22] in new york because they ain't got
[2:03:24] nothing to steal
[2:03:28] but you on the other hand
[2:03:30] are loaded with the treasures of
[2:03:32] almighty god and satan is doing what he
[2:03:35] can do to rob you of what god has given
[2:03:38] you but god gave you a sword to fend off
[2:03:42] your enemy he gave you the strength in
[2:03:44] your heart to say this is my ground this
[2:03:48] is my property and i will not back away
[2:03:51] i will not allow i will not let this
[2:03:53] devil take it all of hell is against it
[2:03:57] all of hell they're against it they're
[2:03:59] not against it in the days of paul
[2:04:02] they're not even against it in the days
[2:04:03] of brother branham even our enemies will
[2:04:06] agree that brother branham was a prophet
[2:04:08] and that he discerned people's hearts
[2:04:10] but what satan is against is that that
[2:04:12] jesus christ is right here this morning
[2:04:16] in the body of you you mothers you
[2:04:19] daughters you women you sons and
[2:04:21] daughters of god god is here this
[2:04:24] morning
[2:04:28] preacher what are you really getting at
[2:04:29] i'll tell you what i'm against now is
[2:04:31] that satan's against the spiritual
[2:04:32] revelation that christ is here
[2:04:35] and that he's here in the church
[2:04:37] that there's a spirit that's on this
[2:04:39] bride
[2:04:40] that is the spirit of adoption
[2:04:42] she knows who she is
[2:04:44] she knows where she's standing she knows
[2:04:47] the enemy that's in front of her she
[2:04:49] knows that the enemy has a voice and the
[2:04:52] voice of the enemy is always trying to
[2:04:55] reason the word and make it not so
[2:04:58] there's always a reason that it ain't
[2:04:59] you there's always a reason somebody's
[2:05:02] coming in the future
[2:05:04] somebody's already done it in the past
[2:05:06] there's a great revival going to move in
[2:05:08] some of these days when all these say
[2:05:11] but with with the nuclear bombs hanging
[2:05:13] and rushing with his finger hovering
[2:05:15] over the trigger you tell me when it's
[2:05:17] going to happen if it ain't now you tell
[2:05:20] me what space of time are we are we
[2:05:23] going to give this bride
[2:05:26] i believe it's right now
[2:05:29] i believe we have arrived to it
[2:05:31] now you say preacher amen there's a
[2:05:34] there's a great battle going on here you
[2:05:35] are saying here you are saying we're the
[2:05:37] greatest with the greatest people on the
[2:05:39] planet
[2:05:41] the most powerful people that's ever
[2:05:42] lived
[2:05:43] scripturally
[2:05:45] you are the people of strength
[2:05:47] in the age we're living in
[2:05:49] according to scripture now
[2:05:51] you're that spotless word bride
[2:05:53] not coming but the man said you are
[2:05:56] see the alpha has become the omega then
[2:05:58] why the battle
[2:06:01] then why are the struggle why do you
[2:06:03] still have to war why is it still a
[2:06:05] battle to believe why is it a battle to
[2:06:08] overcome and the situations and some of
[2:06:10] you are still struggling and you're
[2:06:12] trying to you're trying to get over the
[2:06:14] hump and sits but yet you're a son of
[2:06:16] god and you know you are you're a
[2:06:19] daughter of god and you know you are
[2:06:20] from the depths of your heart but things
[2:06:23] are still worried against your mind on a
[2:06:25] daily bombarded by the pits of hell
[2:06:28] trying to get you to turn around walk
[2:06:30] away don't hold up don't stand there
[2:06:32] attacked by discouragement attack by
[2:06:35] tradition attack by criticism but
[2:06:38] there's something in you that will not
[2:06:40] lay down will not quit it will not walk
[2:06:42] away because you were designed to stand
[2:06:46] in this wicked age by the grace of
[2:06:48] almighty god amen somebody said well
[2:06:50] brother wayne if all these things are
[2:06:51] true then why is all this still here can
[2:06:53] i share something with you from the book
[2:06:54] of judges
[2:06:55] let me just read this i won't be too
[2:06:57] much longer in the book of judges in the
[2:06:58] third chapter watch what what's what the
[2:07:01] the bible says here this is long after
[2:07:03] joshua is gone he said i will henceforth
[2:07:06] drive out from before them the nations
[2:07:09] which joshua left when he died and that
[2:07:11] though i may prove israel whether they
[2:07:14] keep the lord to walk therein as their
[2:07:17] fathers did therefore the lord left
[2:07:19] those nations
[2:07:21] without driving them out hastily
[2:07:24] neither delivered he in the hand of
[2:07:26] joshua
[2:07:27] now these are nations which the lord
[2:07:29] left
[2:07:30] to prove israel by
[2:07:32] even as many as of israel had not known
[2:07:35] the wars of canaan
[2:07:37] only the generations of the children of
[2:07:39] israel to know to teach
[2:07:42] them war
[2:07:44] at least such as that knew it not before
[2:07:47] in judges three and two he says it again
[2:07:49] only the generations that they might
[2:07:52] teach them war that they might teach
[2:07:54] them more god did this to teach you war
[2:07:59] you've got to learn to war we can preach
[2:08:02] the message to you but you got to learn
[2:08:04] to war our young people sitting here if
[2:08:07] you're going to make it in this age
[2:08:09] you've got to learn to pick the sword up
[2:08:10] in war you've got to know how to fight
[2:08:13] back against this giant that's in the
[2:08:16] land that we're in now you will not get
[2:08:18] by without knowing how to fight
[2:08:20] you will not get by on the other side
[2:08:23] amen and somebody just
[2:08:25] made the way and you just easily walked
[2:08:27] in no sir that's not the age we're
[2:08:29] living in if you get in this it's
[2:08:31] because you picked your sword up and you
[2:08:33] fought your way through come on i know
[2:08:36] what i'm talking about there's giants
[2:08:38] you've got a youth group here you've got
[2:08:40] a youth group and i think it's a good
[2:08:41] thing i think you ought to have youth
[2:08:43] meetings you ought to have music you
[2:08:44] ought to have this but if you've got a
[2:08:45] youth group somebody in that youth group
[2:08:48] is always going to say hey man they
[2:08:50] didn't invite me to the party they
[2:08:51] didn't call me they didn't text me i
[2:08:53] wasn't asked to sing the lead amen they
[2:08:56] stole my song all that all that stuff's
[2:08:58] going to happen and so some of the
[2:09:00] elders will say well we already just not
[2:09:02] have a youth group been well i'm not i'm
[2:09:04] not one of them i believe we have the
[2:09:06] youth group but we kill the giant
[2:09:09] i don't think we are to feed giants i
[2:09:10] think we already killed giants amen i
[2:09:13] believe we are to have church i believe
[2:09:15] we are to have holy ghost meetings and
[2:09:17] there'll be giants that'll come in and
[2:09:19] say well you shouldn't do it because
[2:09:21] this problem this problem well wherever
[2:09:23] people are there's going to be problems
[2:09:25] amen but we are giant slayers we are
[2:09:28] anointed by god to teach the children of
[2:09:32] israel how to war against the devils of
[2:09:36] the age that we're living in i'll tell

[2:09:50] training ministries and people not
[2:09:52] setting them down in schools and
[2:09:54] theologies and saying this is how you do

[2:12:20] people here this morning that have been
[2:12:22] taught to war and you say well there
[2:12:25] must be something wrong this spirit and
[2:12:27] this spirit wouldn't be there if it
[2:12:28] wasn't something wrong god said i left
[2:12:30] them in the land
[2:12:33] even after william branham's gone i left
[2:12:35] him in the land william branham could
[2:12:38] have eradicated every devil out of hell
[2:12:40] when he was here but god said i left it
[2:12:43] in the land i left it to teach you how
[2:12:46] to war in the season that you're living
[2:12:48] in every sun that comes into heaven
[2:12:51] we'll march in victorious brother
[2:12:54] matthew you're sealed and your sword
[2:12:56] will have blood stains from the battles
[2:12:59] that you fought in the age that you're
[2:13:01] living in teaching you to war
[2:13:06] now brother ma'am said it
[2:13:07] do you know god can train a man to war
[2:13:10] god can train a church to war he can
[2:13:12] change them do you know how a people
[2:13:14] wars it's according to the general
[2:13:15] they're under
[2:13:18] one day
[2:13:19] when joshua come to the walls of jericho
[2:13:22] he looked at them walls and said how and
[2:13:24] how in the world will i ever get them
[2:13:27] walls down
[2:13:28] but he knew he's going to do it
[2:13:31] he knew he was going to do it
[2:13:32] he knew it was going to happen but how
[2:13:34] am i going to do it and he's sitting
[2:13:36] there studying the matter and all of a
[2:13:38] sudden he looks over and there's a man
[2:13:40] standing there with a sword in his hand
[2:13:42] and he was so battle hungry he looked at
[2:13:45] that man said to you for me you against
[2:13:47] me
[2:13:48] he knew he was in an offensive battle
[2:13:50] now he wasn't defensive no more he
[2:13:52] wasn't just defending his land he was
[2:13:55] there to possess land he was there to
[2:13:57] take things away from the devil that the
[2:14:00] satan had settled on thought people
[2:14:02] forgot about their freedoms forgot what
[2:14:04] it meant to be free and feel the power
[2:14:07] of god but he knew he was there that
[2:14:09] morning i tell you what can i just get
[2:14:11] some liberty here when joshua met him
[2:14:13] and he stood there with that sword in
[2:14:15] his hand can you imagine the grace and
[2:14:18] the fear in joshua's eyes when he said
[2:14:21] who are you he said i'm the captain of
[2:14:24] this host
[2:14:28] oh my
[2:14:29] the
[2:14:30] captain of all the hosts of heaven
[2:14:33] had came down to train this man to war
[2:14:38] [Laughter]
[2:14:40] i mean the god of all creation had said
[2:14:43] this battle is so important you're going
[2:14:46] to read about it in hundreds of years to
[2:14:48] come my generals in laodicea and
[2:14:51] throughout the ages we'll read this as a
[2:14:54] battle plan of how to attack the enemy
[2:14:57] so joshua you better get it right i'll
[2:15:00] tell you what some of you probably been
[2:15:01] in in the army anybody here been in the
[2:15:02] army
[2:15:04] navy marines
[2:15:06] you've been there
[2:15:07] yeah when they taught you to take down a
[2:15:08] wall they probably taught you how to do
[2:15:10] it with explosive
[2:15:12] or a sledgehammer or with a tank
[2:15:15] amen but nobody ever commissioned you to
[2:15:17] walk one down
[2:15:19] nobody not in all of the history
[2:15:22] of the wars of the world outside of
[2:15:24] joshua's was a wall took to the ground
[2:15:28] by a bunch of people walking around it
[2:15:31] but when god teaches a man to war he
[2:15:34] teaches him a way that will operate in
[2:15:36] the supernatural he wasn't naturally
[2:15:39] going to do it he was supernaturally
[2:15:41] going to do it and he lined that group
[2:15:43] of people up and here's the 2 million of
[2:15:45] them are so and he told him he said look
[2:15:46] now here's the instructions this is the
[2:15:49] action this is the exploit that we're
[2:15:50] going to do that god is going to give us
[2:15:52] strength but here's what's going to
[2:15:53] happen we're going to walk around this
[2:15:55] wall for six days
[2:15:57] yeah josh what's going to happen well
[2:15:59] see now these walls are going to fall
[2:16:00] before us and and i often often laugh
[2:16:03] when i read this part six days quiet i
[2:16:05] think he wasn't preaching to the
[2:16:07] congregations i'm preaching to
[2:16:10] if you go down to the full gospel
[2:16:11] lighthouse and tell them the wall's
[2:16:13] about to come down and you start trying
[2:16:14] to lead them around that wall
[2:16:16] i can just hear them
[2:16:18] can you imagine trying to choke that
[2:16:20] shout down
[2:16:22] look at them massive walls and all of
[2:16:24] that and you knowing
[2:16:26] them devils them devils looking off the
[2:16:28] walls at them and they're out there
[2:16:29] walking around you talking about
[2:16:30] confusing buddy
[2:16:32] you talking about confusing the devil
[2:16:35] then people just peacefully walking and
[2:16:36] somebody playing a trumpet and they're
[2:16:38] just walking along around that they did
[2:16:40] that for six days
[2:16:42] on the seventh day you know the story on
[2:16:44] the seventh day they marched around it
[2:16:47] seven times
[2:16:48] but on that seventh goal amen all them
[2:16:51] trump had sounded at the same time
[2:16:54] and when the trumpet started sounding
[2:16:57] something happened with the church that
[2:16:59] they began to shout a victory amen and
[2:17:03] the walls were still standing but they
[2:17:05] started shattered the bible said with
[2:17:07] one voice they began to shout now you
[2:17:10] thought military operations were all by
[2:17:13] sword you thought military operations
[2:17:15] were all done with spears and with tanks
[2:17:17] and bombs but in god's military
[2:17:20] operation you do not separate war from
[2:17:23] worship and whenever the church really
[2:17:25] goes to war they begin to worship in a
[2:17:29] way that confuses the enemy that is
[2:17:31] watching them can you imagine the
[2:17:33] confusion that come off of that hill
[2:17:35] when them people started screaming and
[2:17:37] shouting hey man somebody said what's
[2:17:39] the matter with that bunch of crazy
[2:17:41] people they're down there shouting and
[2:17:43] it looks like they're completely
[2:17:44] defeated oh but brother when you're
[2:17:47] shouting under the inspiration of
[2:17:49] almighty god something is about to
[2:17:52] change and they begin to worship and
[2:17:54] shout until the very walls they were
[2:17:57] looking at begin to tumble right in
[2:17:59] front of them i thought oh god amen help
[2:18:02] me lord to learn how to war to learn to
[2:18:05] war against this enemy that's in front
[2:18:07] of me
[2:18:08] you know what's written in the book of
[2:18:09] chronicles that they were outnumbered by
[2:18:12] multitudes when jehoshaphat went down to
[2:18:15] the house of god and prayed and you know
[2:18:17] what when he approached god you know
[2:18:18] what he said to him he talked to the god
[2:18:20] of abraham and the god of isaac and the
[2:18:22] god of jacob and he told him the
[2:18:24] situation he was in
[2:18:26] and when god came back to him you know
[2:18:28] what he said to him he said the battle
[2:18:30] isn't yours
[2:18:34] the battle isn't yours
[2:18:36] he said the battle belongs to me saith
[2:18:39] the lord
[2:18:40] well lord amen what am i going to do in
[2:18:43] this battle well don't sharpen your
[2:18:45] swords don't even sharpen your spears he
[2:18:48] said you appoint yourself some singers
[2:18:50] he said and y'all amen start heading out
[2:18:53] to that battle and you get them people
[2:18:55] are singing can you imagine amen that
[2:18:58] people saw a bunch of a bunch of these
[2:19:01] renegade israelites and they're beating
[2:19:03] on instruments they're singing they're
[2:19:06] shouting they're rejoicing but the bible
[2:19:08] says that god caused the confusement to
[2:19:12] come upon their enemies and their
[2:19:14] enemies turned on one another in that
[2:19:16] very hour listen to me this morning i
[2:19:19] know it seems odd to worship in troubled
[2:19:22] times i know it seems odd to praise god
[2:19:25] when everything's against you but all of
[2:19:28] heaven is waiting for the church to
[2:19:30] begin to rejoice with god in his word
[2:19:33] before it ever even takes place and when
[2:19:36] they begin to worship god begin to
[2:19:39] release the angels out of heaven and
[2:19:41] they just begin to file off of the
[2:19:43] benches of god into the battle that was
[2:19:46] on the earth i'll tell you something
[2:19:48] this morning i believe that god is still
[2:19:50] training i believe god is still showing
[2:19:53] the church
[2:19:54] what it means to overcome an enemy in
[2:19:57] this hour i'll tell you what i believe
[2:19:59] this with all of my heart i believe amen
[2:20:02] that there is a victory for the church
[2:20:04] of the living god in the season that
[2:20:06] we're living in
[2:20:09] i believe there's a victory like there's
[2:20:10] never been i'm gonna give you three
[2:20:12] words in closing this morning i want you
[2:20:14] to take these home with you there's
[2:20:16] three words
[2:20:17] and i want you to remember these three
[2:20:19] words
[2:20:20] there is no retreat
[2:20:24] there is no reserve
[2:20:27] and there'll be no regret
[2:20:30] as a church of the living god
[2:20:32] as we're entering this battle
[2:20:35] there can be no retreat
[2:20:38] there can be none
[2:20:40] you've got to make up your mind i'm in

[2:21:14] program

[2:21:22] how would you have you ever thought
[2:21:23] about that how in the world would you
[2:21:24] say that
[2:21:28] there's a story told of a young boy who
[2:21:30] joined the army you know calvary and he
[2:21:32] didn't have long in training because
[2:21:33] he's right in the middle of war so they
[2:21:35] took him down and gave him a trumpet he
[2:21:36] wanted to be the trumpet player you know
[2:21:38] he loved to hear the sound of charge so
[2:21:40] they taught the boy charged they taught
[2:21:41] him how to play it well and he got it
[2:21:43] down good and they took off to battle
[2:21:45] men they've been winning battle after
[2:21:46] battle and he'd played that charge and
[2:21:48] played that charge and everybody was
[2:21:50] ready for the charge one day they come
[2:21:52] over the hill my goodness that was it
[2:21:54] was it was a soldier's amen they were
[2:21:56] just everywhere and the little fella
[2:21:58] turned around look at the general
[2:21:59] general said my goodness there's too
[2:22:00] many this morning sound the retreat and
[2:22:03] little boy pulled the horn up to his
[2:22:04] lips he
[2:22:06] started blowing and next thing you know
[2:22:08] he's blowing the charge
[2:22:11] the the whole army heard the they heard
[2:22:14] the charge and they come over the hill
[2:22:16] and victorious they become they they
[2:22:18] just totally obliterated the army before
[2:22:21] him and when it was all over the general
[2:22:23] pulled the boy to the side he said son
[2:22:25] now i told you to sound the retreat why
[2:22:27] did you disobey the order he said sorry
[2:22:29] sir he said when i was in training for
[2:22:31] the army he said nobody taught me the
[2:22:33] sound of retreat he said i don't even
[2:22:35] know how to play it on the horn and i
[2:22:38] tell you this morning church
[2:22:40] i've trained under men of god that don't
[2:22:43] know the keys of retreat they don't know
[2:22:45] how to sound retreat they don't know how
[2:22:48] to say that back up it's wrong there's
[2:22:51] no way but the only thing i know to say
[2:22:53] this morning is charge
[2:22:56] charge this enemy drive this enemy out
[2:22:59] of your ground this ground belongs to
[2:23:02] you

[2:23:19] there
[2:23:20] is no retreat
[2:23:23] brother brahm said i don't care what
[2:23:24] stage of the battle you're in
[2:23:26] he said speak the word and go forward
[2:23:28] there is no retreat
[2:23:31] at the point we're setting this morning
[2:23:32] there's no words to retreat to
[2:23:35] there's nothing left behind us

[2:24:02] and the difference in champions and
[2:24:04] warriors is they dig deeper
[2:24:06] to find the hidden reserves
[2:24:11] i'm reminded of great men
[2:24:13] right here in this virginia country
[2:24:15] who cried out giving me liberty
[2:24:19] or give me death y'all remember that
[2:24:22] you remember what he said in his speech

[2:24:29] until everybody's in chains
[2:24:33] don't wait till there's a british in
[2:24:34] every home and you don't have any guns
[2:24:39] if you're gonna fight he said now's the
[2:24:40] time
[2:24:42] now is the time to begin to fight don't
[2:24:45] wait

[2:25:21] killed surely on his bed
[2:25:22] but when they run and told the news to
[2:25:24] his mama
[2:25:26] they said jim's been killed she said
[2:25:27] well i'll give you a wager he didn't
[2:25:29] have any wounds in his back
[2:25:32] because he wasn't running from the
[2:25:34] battle
[2:25:36] and i can give you a wager of this bride

[2:26:50] to worship we had that little memory and
[2:26:52] we'd throw it in there we'd shut him off

[3:15:00] in an incredible family
[3:15:03] i'm gonna talk to you just like you
[3:15:06] don't even know him
[3:15:08] he was raised in this family and
[3:15:11] and satan swore that he would destroy
[3:15:15] but god's got the final answer
[3:15:20] and it was just a couple of months ago
[3:15:21] that god began to deal with his life
[3:15:24] dealt with andrew and myself
[3:15:26] as we
[3:15:28] took another avenue of prayer
[3:15:32] seth walked to the altar on his own
[3:15:34] accord
[3:15:36] and he came
[3:15:37] chains were broke

[3:16:10] a different atmosphere
[3:16:13] that we are thankful for
[3:16:14] you see no man can come on his own it
[3:16:17] takes god to draw him
[3:16:20] oh many times we'll cycle through life
[3:16:22] for for maybe even decades and then all
[3:16:25] of a sudden god will spark that little
[3:16:27] spark of
[3:16:28] life let me just say without that spark
[3:16:30] of life we'll we'll keep doing the same
[3:16:33] process over and over and over again
[3:16:37] you say why are you taking a little time
[3:16:38] here i'm rebuking the devil and
[3:16:39] reminding him
[3:16:41] that satan is defeated
[3:16:45] and if you're waiting on him to fail and
[3:16:47] you're waiting on him to make a mistake
[3:16:48] i want you to understand there's a
[3:16:50] different king on his heart
[3:16:52] and when that king jesus comes on your
[3:16:54] heart there's no more failures and
[3:16:56] there's no more cycles

[3:17:01] and so today
[3:17:03] we're burying those cycles hallelujah
[3:17:06] we're burying all those sins and all
[3:17:08] those mistakes and all those failures
[3:17:11] and everything that was held against him
[3:17:13] satan
[3:17:14] the blood of jesus christ takes care of
