surrendered my life and gave my heart to the Lord and you know hear you hear our pastor talk about the decision you make today is going to determine where you're at in five years and I look back from five years ago when um five years ago today I would have been living in a basement um and and now I look and I've got a beautiful wife with beautiful boy and um about to have a beautiful girl and then with with how he's just carried me through do the job and uh he's he's helped me all along the way and you know if you're on the fence just make that decision make that decision and not only does he bless us but he keeps us safe and and you know I'll take it back just a couple weeks ago I've told a testimony before about how the god SP how God spared my life but here a couple weeks ago um we were we were working an investigation and um somebody set me up and uh we had we had had some investigating agents they were they were kind of sitting around watching the house we knew knew who was there and they set me up said they were the only ones there and so they said just come on in the door you're fine just come on inside and uh so we knew what was going on and naturally if you set if you set a cop up well if you didn't know the next day you're going to get your doors kicked in so um they set me up we kicked in the doors and I was able to go in there and arrest the person that had set us up and I'm also a person that believes in Grace and I sat in front of them the next day and offer them a chance of God I don't care I don't care what anything has ever been done to you that's who I am and that's what I believe Christ sent us to do and I'm just thankful that God has been able to protect me and protect my family and protect us from everything we come in contact with and Grace goes beyond bounds no matter what what lines have been drawn Grace goes beyond bounds I always choose Grace we just take these needs of the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come before you tonight and Lord I just thank about all the all the wonderful blessings you've been able to put in front of us and you've been able to keep us from so many things and keep us keep us safe from from dangers and things that we don't even know that would come and we know that we would have a Prophet come and he would preach sermon after sermon about Grace and Lord he would also preach about investigating angels and how those investigating Angels would come and they would stand before us and they would block one way or the other and we see we see even Moses and how how the angel Gabriel would come down and put his foot on on every nose of the crocodile that would come up and try to destroy and I just believe that we're living in a day that we're living in a day that Lord you're here to protect us and Lord you're here to work miracles and you're here to you're here to be able to move among your children and move among the sons and daughters of God and we're here to take back everything Satan's ever stole from us and Lord Jesus I just believe that you could come down and you've heard the you've heard the many prayer requests you hear the the brother there that brother Randy hle brought up and they've gave him weeks to live but Lord Jesus we live in a day that no matter what doctors say they can offer so many great things but as science goes up so does we see that we're going up higher and higher and I believe that when we ask it we shall take it and receive it Lord and I just believe that every single one of these prayer requests no matter the sick needy no matter how small to how big Lord when we lift it up to you and ask it in Jesus name you will come and you will answer it Lord and I just believe that you will just come down in a mighty way in this service and allow us to be able to move closer to you and move higher and and and move into the calling and the potential that you've that you've called unto us Lord and I just thank you for all that you're doing for us and all that you continue to do for us and as our pastor stands behind this pull pit tonight I just ask that you would just bring through a a sweep of the power of the Holy Ghost that would only not only touch his body but allow us to be able to move closer to you because we know the day is coming that you will come and sweep your bride away and Lord Jesus I thank you for what you are doing and what

DNA goes real deep and there are certain times that sister Connie looks at me I see Homer I'm not going to tell you when it's then that I walk softly amen amen God bless you amen we certainly love you that crazy groundhog was right wasn't he what the deal I tell you amen no wonder my dad believed in him amen God bless you if you will turn with me to the scriptures to John 1 and verse 29 and then Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 20 I want to speak on there is power in the blood amen this is forgiveness part one amen I'm thankful for that today aren't you amen amen brother brandom said this without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins take the blood out and you've got nothing else but a cold formal Creed life lays in the blood that's right life comes from the blood and the blood comes from the male sect exactly John 1 and verse 29 and the next day day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said and what a statement this must have been for all of those people to see Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world let's read that together and the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world let's pray Lord Jesus we love you tonight father we ask you to forgive us of our sins and our mistakes and failures father it's just a joy to serve you with all of our hearts and we have gathered tonight on this evening to worship you we already feel your presence and we put our our licks of fire together and Lord I just ask you to touch brother Andrew tonight all those that are in the building that are not feeling well we ask you that you'd touch them those that are a homesick we pray that you'd touch them in a special way Lord we just thank you for this word this evening may you anoint it anoint the speaker and the hearer we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen and amen you can be seated amen up until this moment this Prophet John it had only been by blood of bulls and goats but when he makes this statement the blood of bulls and goats are no longer a veil amen Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world in Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 20 saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkle the with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by law purged with blood this is a powerful statement and without shedding of blood there is of blood of no remission listen we got to have blood in John chapter 14 and verse one let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether you go you know and the way that you know and Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way this is a phenomenal statement now and Jesus saith unto him I am the way I am the way and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me I want you to understand tonight he is not one of the [Music] ways he is not one of the ways that there's not 50 other ways to get to God he's the only way 911 we had a h a tremendous uh catastrophe or disaster in America and they call for a National Prayer and so many different religions came and and they came and many speakers from all of these religions came and and gave their statement and then gave their prayer bringing the United States together after the disaster women speakers then speakers from Buddha speakers from other and they came and they presented their God before America Billy Graham was known as the pastor of of America and Pastor the presidents and now his son is the pastor to presidents they are saying Billy Graham got up and he was being political and he said we all serve the same God let me just say we don't serve Buddha we don't serve Muhammad listen they can run their their horse and change it every so often for Muhammad when he raises and they say he'll raise one day listen Our God went to the grave and he said you can destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it back up again we would not be here tonight if it had been four days or 5 days or six days but he raised on the third day and when he walked into the kingdom of hell he took over hell and he took the keys of death hell and the grave and he stripped Satan of his power and how we know that the scripture says when Paul came to his time to die when they were going to chop his head off he screamed oh oh death where's your Victory oh oh grave where's your victory at I think this is a phenomenal thing when when we arrive in heaven brother bandam some said someday when life is over friends I've often wondered what will take place when all the redeemed of the ages will stand around and we come and Crown Him King of Kings K and Lord of lords and when Angels shall be bowed their heads and not knowing what they're we're talking about notice what he says Angels that's been with him throughout the eternities When we arrive they'll bow their heads they don't know what it is to sin right they never fail they don't know what it is to be lost they never was lost but we who have been lost listen it takes every one of us in we who have been lost he said and been found and redeemed and claimed back and brought out of the devil's pawn shop by the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ in his sacrifice sacrificial death I'm telling you you talk about screaming and hollering and going on it'll be that day when they redeemed don't tell me not to shout don't tell me not to scream don't tell me not to get excited when we sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see he said look what a day at Calvary did for you it paid your price right I love this next thing it settled the question your sins be as Scarlet they're white as snow red like Crimson white like wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless listen this is a Prophet this ain't some average preacher God's telling you you are sinless look over at your neighbor and say you are sinless God has paid the price I'm trying to behave no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior your sins are forgiven your sins are forgiven anything that is Forgiven is remitted and forgot about you Lord what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus then God himself become a Kinsman by taking on human flesh through the Virgin birth and he shed his blood that wasn't the blood of a Jew notice the statement that wasn't the blood of a Jew it wasn't the blood of a gentile it was the blood of god notice the statement that wasn't the blood of a Jew I want you to get it it wasn't the blood of a gentile it was the blood of God we're saved through the blood of God brother Thomas we're glad to have you back too buddy God brought him through that back operation amen now just to recover and you behave yourself while you recover too I'm a good one to talk now remember it wasn't part Mary and part God Amen it was not part Mary and part god Mary's blood was as toxin as anybody else's blood when Adam fell the blood became toxic right listen no man can die for another man's sins and Mary though being a virgin before God her blood was toxic that came from this cursed Earth God borrowed her womb but what about all the statutes of Mary listen I appreciate all the statutes of Mary and we all respect that but she couldn't die for me she is not God listen I know of your Catholic background you worship Mary but let me just say this to you she's our sister she's our sister nothing moved her when the angel came she didn't feel any sensation that's right but she did feel sensation when she received the Holy Ghost in the upper room and came out shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues and brother Bram said if Mary Had to do that you've got to do that listen it was not Mary's blood that paid for your sins it was the blood of Jesus Christ of God that paid for your sins listen we know this let's hammer it down to the devil that Whispers In Your Ear God became flesh not the blood of a prophet that's right now watch what he says through the blood the washing of the blood the taking away the separating of sin that Holy Spirit Woos a Believer through the blood the cleansing of Soul into Fellowship into his Spirit life inside with Christ shut out the world the very nature of God is in you I want you to say the very nature of God is in me still subject to mistakes I'm glad brother BR said this still subject to mistakes but God can't see [Applause] it brother Ron I don't make any mistakes Hast standing you be the preacher tonight but God can't see it because it's covered by the blood now they don't give you a license to sin rob banks and commit adultery God can't see through the blood he said every time he looks through the blood it looks white he looks through the blood and he sees white that ought to make you shout right now now listen many religions have removed the blood there are Bibles that you can get that are very familiar to a lot of us and they have removed the blood they removed the blood from it there's songs that they remove the blood from it right in the 1980s there was a movement that came through the message I was a young Christian literally I was just I was just a couple of weeks old as a Christian and then me and Connie had got married we went to a convention and in that convention and preacher got up and said aren't you thankful we don't need the blood no more and I said listen I know better than [Music] that I know better than that we still got to have the blood your former Pastor brother Homer Fraser P who this church has been built upon he said it's time for us to leave we got up and walked out of that service he said if you don't have the blood there's no life in it let me just say this to you you can cut muscles off of you and you'll still live you can take organs out of you and you'll still live I'm living today with organs that are dead and I use medicine to keep me alive but let me just say if the blood stops if that heart quits beating are you with me your muscles can die your organs can die but you let that blood stop come on help me preach you let the blood stop in a church that church becomes kabad and the presence of God is no longer with it you let worship stop in a church it'll become death because the presence of God indwells and inhabits with the Praises of his [Applause] people let me just say God built Birds to praise the Lord he built every animal to praise the Lord he said everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord and let me just say when a church decides I don't we don't need that no more that church dies oh but brother Ron we're too educated we are too high we have went past all that you're [Applause] dead need to quote anything without emotion anything without emotion is dead and needs to be bured that's right brother Ron but that's just Pentecostal yes from Acts chapter 2 not from the early 1900s but from Acts chapter 2 am there was life in in end there'll be life until the end listen God started his church the way he wanted it he'll end his church the way he started it to reject re worship under the shed blood is to reject life Adam and the Gard of Eden he he didn't get blood but he went in and covered himself brother brandham said religion he covered himself with religion he went and got leaves and covered himself now let's just think about this when Adam fell God came running God came running through the garden running now let's just think when the angels in heaven that part of the angels in heaven follow Lucifer's message under the sin of I will exalt myself you watch people when they want to exalt their will above the will of God you're headed in the wrong direction Paul said I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ listen when that group of angels fell and the war in heaven took place it never moved God but when one son of God fell God came running God came running through the garden screaming Adam where are you that's how important you are to God brother BR said if you were the only one he would have came for you so don't let the devil whisper in your ear that you're not important you might as well go ahead and clap your hands right there sped all through the Old Testament let me just take just a moment to go here it was Abel that offered a sacrifice when Cain offered all of his on the on his on his altar offered all of his works and offered all of his fruit and offered to God and it was a beautiful altar because remember who his father was it was a beautiful offer of worship but K with a little rope around the Lamb's neck pulled it up on that rock and begin to take a sharp Rock and take that that animal's life and it was bleeding and its life was going out of it whose altar that God accept who's alar did God accept brother Ron but they got a huge church and all their altars are full of gold on who altar did God accept it was the shed blood when Adam and Eve walked out of the garden it was a shed blood oh brother Ron that's brutal that's horrible listen it it's not not for Peter listen we're not trying to we're not trying to trying to be a social like here we're wanting to get to God not some social program we're wanting to worship God the way he wants to be worshiped it was blood for Abel it was blood for Abraham we have wood we have fire but where is the altar and he said God will provide himself a sacrifice and remember what he told the others he said Isaac and I will return he knew if I had to take his life got to raise him back up again why was he so assured because the king had told him at his tent he had told him at his 10 thy seed shall possess the Gate of their eny it wasn't going to be just for Isaac but it was going to be generation after generation still going on today listen God is as good as he word if he requires his life and it's an ultimate sacrifice why was God asking him that because God was going to do it himself he was going to give his own son he was going to do it himself he said I got power to lay my life down and power to take it up again look through history nobody ever said it and did it trying to behave and Abraham called the place Jehovah Gyra what a place Moses required Abraham's children wound up in in Egypt 400 years Joseph no doubt could tell the stories about Abraham and that sacrifice the promises that they would be under Jacob no doubt had shared those stories those Brethren nobody out shared the stories think about it about 70 people in a family became over two million pretty incredible isn't it it was a family of Believers now I want you to understand when it came down to they were going to leave the land and God required blood he required Blood on the door poost right he required blood from their household he required their perfect lamb that's right it had to be without spot or without a blemish and you had to take it and tight for three days let me just say this you you had to search it over right not a blood or blemish or anything on it that's right and then had to take its life life and place the blood of that animal over the doorpost now listen don't substitute it with jewelry don't substitute it with your diplomas don't substitute with all your good works the death angel is going to pass over the death angel is going to pass over and listen in the moment jewelry is not going to work work your wealth is not going to work your high diplomas and your education and your good behavior is not going to work it's going to require the blood of a lamb hallelujah it's the blood of the Lamb that's over our lives today my good works won't work my good deeds won't work I've got to be born again you can have your name over a hundred church books won't work you have got to be born again that's right now how many you remember when people were sold into slavery in the Old Testament there would come a sound of the Jubilee when that sound of the Jubilee would take place they could go free now let me let me just say this to you once you're liberated you going to like this once you're liberated you can't be sold in the slave market ever again once you've been born again and the blood applied to your life Hallelujah y'all behave yourself like I'm trying to behave yourself once you have been redeemed you can never be a slave to sin ever again let me just say this you it is not you holding on oh it's not like alcoholics and nous I'm 56 weeks and I'm free I haven't spoke for 3 years I haven't done this for three years I listen it ain't you holding on it ain't you holding on once you have been liberated you don't even need the slave belt no longer don't that feel good don't that feel good listen don't that feel good just tell the devil that Whispers In Your Ear it's done baby it's done I can spit in your eye it's over Dylan it's over you're never going to be under lock and key ever again cuz that lifestyle is over [Applause] I've been redeemed I've been set free I'm free I'm free I'm free I'm free I'm free give me a scripture brother Ron therefore there is now no condemnation read it properly no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus feels like these walls are breathing now God will never meet with man nowhere nowhere else but under the blood when you turn the blood down then your meeting place has been taken away God made the first decision in the Garden of Eden that man would only worship him under the shed blood of the sacrifice and that's the only place that God will meet with man then that's the only place that God will me did meet with man is under the shed blood don't you love it don't you love it Revelations chap 5 and verse one very familiar to you and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written and with within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice voice who is worthy now this is a strong statement who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now listen you got to be a worthy one it's got to be a Kinsman so let's just give some names no Prophet could do it right no King could do it because remember there is an accuser of the Brethren there's an accuser of the Brethren and he's got a book Moses is a murderer hey let's just say it Moses is a murderer Moses has got a high temper you can shout it'd be all right Joseph Li right he lied Samson you know the story David he's a king and he has a desire to build the temple got a house but he took his one of his best friends wife and become an adulter became an adulter and then had him murdered the blood was on David's hands and as great a man as he was he couldn't even pay the price for his own sins what about Elijah what about Elijah brother Ron Brother BR said he had a temper brother Brandon said he was Moody you ever been around a moody person don't raise your hands don't point at your wife don't look in the sky brother Timothy listen no man on Earth no man in heaven John now is in a crisis if there's nobody worthy we're all lost we're talking about Redemption here if there's no body worthy listen we just live life and when we die we die like a dog I don't me put it in pler we've all got dogs that we love but there's no Redemption value in that the blood of bulls and goats There's No Redemption value in that let me just tell you about the blood Solomon built the temple and when he got done building the Temple I preached to Andrew and the boys yesterday listen when he got done building the Temple he offered 22,00 ,000 oxen you think about the sheer volume of 22,000 oxen as a sacrifice I'll be honest with you I'd hated to operate the meat processing facility that's nothing compared to the 120,000 sheep you imagine what that value was we're talking about millions millions of dollars Untold millions of dollars the blood ran into the streets here's where I'm going with this it only covered sin it only covered sin for a year and listen it didn't change your desires you went out with the same desires that you walked in but now you were covered right we needed a blood we needed a blood that would Purge our sins where the desire of sin in that moment we don't have to have classes around here how to quit smoking how to quit drinking how to quit running out with your neighbor's wife how to quit running with looking at pornography how how to quit looking at the wrong sites we don't have to have classes just get under the blood it doesn't give you a license to go back do that never again but it's got a life on the inside of you and for you that experienced it you come into that presence one time now let me say for some of you you need to keep coming right you need to come coming till you die and his life come inside of you you will know when you're changed you don't get it by Emotion by speaking in tongues you don't get it by lightning flash you'll know you walk to the altar with a lacking peace in your life and you walk away from that altar so this is what they're talking about could you all say Amen on that how many's experienced that w't you raise your hand say thank you God thank you God that's what holds you now you take that experience every time the Devil comes in you take that experience you point it right in the devil's face do you remember when this happened [Applause] Isaiah 53 he is despised and re rejected of men a Man of Sorrows God became man remember brother R said now in that Pillar of Fire he couldn't understand what you was feeling that's incredible it's incredible the prophet could use and state say it like that brother Ron I don't understand I'm I'm GNA just bring it to a level to where we can all understand all of us don't want to hear the word cancer when we're setting in doctor's office none of us want to hear that but when you get acquainted with it and all of a sudden the doctor says you got stage one cancer you know what brother Ron's been fighting almost immediately there comes a spirit with that thing and the life comes alive in that deal but let me let me just say this to you there is a blood I thank God for doctors and I thank God I've been fighting chemo with chemo for five years but there is a blood there is a blood stronger than any chemo and I take it in the name of Jesus Christ I thank God for doctors I thank God but listen once you fall under that same thing you're acquainted with one another's fight notice what he's saying a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief as we hid our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not sure he he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows David didn't do that Abraham didn't do that follow me I know I'm simple job didn't do that but this Messiah this Jesus can identify with every situation listen every one of us in this building's got a different story every one of us in this building has a history book are you with me you don't even want your children to know about your history book there's nothing about Sin that we brag about but God who's rich in Mercy I caught something right there well brother Ron I never did anything out in sin what about your thoughts that speak louder in heaven than your words do on Earth you don't want even your neighbor sitting beside of you or your husband or your wife come on don't tell me come on don't tell me he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows and yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted this next scripture let's read it together but he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed counting rosary beads will not do it lighting a candle will not do it becoming a social member of some social club will not do it signing every book will not do it having a perfect attendance at church will not do it have a cross hung around your neck will not do it I find it amazing that our political leaders will become religious am will become religious all of a sudden because it's it's socially correct now our president has become religious but if you want to know how religious is watch him at the inauguration he don't bow his head he don't close his eyes now listen I know you don't have to bow your head and close your eyes at every prayer he don't know how pray and they may call him the Messiah if he gets all our debt taking place and gets peace to the world somebody's going to fulfill the tribulation period somebody's going to do the job but I'm not looking to Donald Trump as my redeemer [Applause] but brother Ronnie's doing what he said he would do yeah but I got a God that says has filled us with a Bible and he does everything that he says he will do he said he would heal me and he does he tells me he'll save me and he has tells me that he'll put angels of guard for my children and watch over them said it would bless my family come on you might as well praise the Lord get under it there is no remission of sins outside of the blood this message is the bleeding word of the hour and God's light is in this message that's right it's proven all over the world every country it's proven all over the world there's no Holy Ghost for America and a different Holy Ghost for Russia right there's not a different holy ghost in China right I've met those brothers and sisters in China and they have the same Holy Ghost that's inside listen it just it just radiates out of their life it radiates out of your life you don't have to put it on you don't have to act it on it just radiates it's a life on the inside like a du that just radiates out of their life this is no social learn gospel this is no behavioral change easy belief ISM listen when you meet God I can't say it enough when you meet God it's an automatic change in your life brother shann and I was writing the notes right here and I thought about this row thought about this row somebody else turned down the word before you offered it to these guys a they right and listen what was in that book transformed these guys' life what some body else turned down it transformed their life and it just didn't transform their life look at their families come on church it's not just for you it's for your family Hallelujah listen this message works [Applause] [Music] amen I was praying for sister Faith on Sunday haven't talked to her but I was praying for her brother Andrew was the speaker and I just felt to be praying and as I went down and sister Faith was there she asked for the same thing that her sister asked for very same thing word for word I prayed for her sister I prayed for you and while I was holding your hands there was a white light that happened right between your and our eyes she saw the angel of the Lord now listen I didn't have to make that happen it just happened it was Sovereign you're right you've been to the altar a lot of times but that one was different it isn't because you're a preacher daughter or in a preacher's lineage come on my children need it the same way I got it Matthew needed it being my oldest he need it Andrew definitely needed it and Whitney she needed it now listen now it goes from Matthew to Titus and and to India and it goes to Reagan you can't make these things happen and Ally definitely needs it and Isaac and Zoe definitely needs it we can't put it on them but we can keep up in an atmosphere come on church we can keep him in an atmosphere where he's at and in the right moment at the right time it'll burst to life [Applause] brother Ron I've came here for 10 years I don't know what I'm getting out of it did I just not give you a good exercise did I not just give you a good exercise it's for you and for your children and for your children's children that's what we're

matter of fact we're going to leave this house they probably make storage houses out of it maybe Apartments maybe another church will take it there'll be a mystery these people are gone amen they won't have no explanation why we're gone maybe it was a message they went to South America and they're all down there somewhere or another they'll explain the blood away you know they'll explain no more miracles they'll explain all different kinds of things but we will know that we know right W now there'll be some of your half-hearted believer cousins they're going to know people real close to you going to know brother Ron we on such a high don't go down low listen somebody's going to stay somebody's going to be left behind more than just a good book series somebody's going to be left

live in a White House don't ask me why I'm going somewhere with this don't ask me why he's driven to do something that's right he's driven to do something that White House Is Not nowhere near what any of his houses are I wouldn't do it I'll be honest with you I wouldn't do it I wouldn't live under the scrutiny of the of of the news Department cuz my life is none of your business I would say none of your business so quick until it would spin their heads none of your business how many you how many of you are kind of like that you want to live a a quiet simple none of your business life brother Ron I don't like to be told politics well let me just tell you this God left a throne that none of Donald Trump's houses can even touch the glory of Jesus's throne and he left it to be spit on and cursed and hated he was homeless call him a hippie call him a homeless man I call him God Amen listen he didn't do it for the accolades of human beings our champion came here to die one more quot I'm going to quit and I'll pick it up again the morning is that all right and I can see as the as the heavens and the Earth turned black and the Rocks belching out from the mountains the whole heavens and the moon the stars refused to shine he conquered it and went down and descended down and and knocked on the door where those lost souls was and when the door opened and those people who had laughed and made fun of Enoch who made fun of Noah I can hear him say I am the one that Enoch said would come with 10 thousands of his Saints why didn't you believe Enoch why didn't you believe Noah let me just let me just go just a step further when he rece when he steps out and says why didn't you believe William Brandon why did you hate him right why didn't you believe Ron Spencer why didn't you believe Donnie Reagan why didn't you believe these men of God I sent them for your sake right I've heard Tim Brit say it so many times what did he do to you what did Jesus do that caused you to hate him right what did Brother brandham do to you right that caused you to hate him what did Homer do what did Ron do what did Andrew do what do these men of God do they hated the blood they hated the life listen that's serious folks to turn down blood makes you an enemy of God I'm your brother but to turn down the word makes you an enemy of God it ain't me right it ain't Andrew it ain't brother Tim it ain't brother Donnie right it's what we represent everything had to know that he'd conquered and when he shut the door on them the days of Mercy was passed and on down into the lowest parts of hell he went and he knocked at the Su door of the devil's hell and the devil came to the door as we could look to see and there he said well here you are after all I sure thought I had you when I killed the prophets I sure thought I had you when I cut John's head off in prison but now after all you'll hear and I can hear him as he said straighten himself up Satan I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God notice these words my blood is still wet on the cross I paid the price brother Jonathan we shout right now I was worthy of death I was worthy of Hell listen folks I don't want to spend 10 seconds in hell oh brother Ron I'm going to Rejoice I'm going to enjoy hell with all my friends not going to be any friends in Hellen naked in hell and God sent Jesus to hell for me for you why did you do that sister Connie so you wouldn't have to go because under no listen if you was born a 10 billionaire and you had degrees all over when you were born you were born in sin and without God paying a price for you let me just say we have no chance amen listen listen folks let me just say this to you there's only two places there's only two places and one I am not predestinated to go to listen Jesus just didn't die on a cross to pay the blood 2,000 years ago you was predestinated before the foundation of the world stay with me you was predestinated before the foundation before any of your forefathers was born in sin God predestinated you to eternal life and listen furthermore Jesus died on the cross before there was any molecule ever created why did he do that you he died in the mind of God before the foundation of the world I can hear him say strengthen himself Satan I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross I paid the price I've conquered and I've come down to take over strip you of everything that you claimed that you had and he reached over on his side and jerked the keys of death hell and the grave off of him and he kicked back into the place where he belonged he conquered hell amen and when he arose he had the keys of death hell hanging on his side so what's the church scared about he conquered Satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell now let me just say this to you young people none of the heroes of this life did none of the above Michael Jordan will be in trouble on that day Hollywood Superstars will be in trouble
