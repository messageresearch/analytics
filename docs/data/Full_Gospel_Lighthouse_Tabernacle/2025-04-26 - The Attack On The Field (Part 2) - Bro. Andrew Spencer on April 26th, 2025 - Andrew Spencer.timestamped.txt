[6:03] song, Victory in Jesus, my savior
[6:06] forever. Aren't you glad you got the
[6:09] victory in him?
[6:12] Well, I heard an old story. How savior
[6:17] came from glory. How he gave his life on
[6:21] Calvary to save a wretch like me. But
[6:26] then I heard about his groaning. Oh, his
[6:29] precious blood atone. Then I repented of
[6:35] my sins and won the victory.
[6:39] Oh, victory in Jesus my savior
[6:46] forever. He sought me and he bought me
[6:50] with his redeeming blood. For healing of
[6:54] the air I knew him and all the love is
[6:59] to him. He plunged me to
[7:04] victory beneath the cleansing flow.
[7:08] Well, I heard about his feeling of his
[7:12] cleansing, how he prepared me, how he
[7:15] made the lame to walk the cave and cause
[7:20] the blind to see. And then I cried and
[7:24] tell Jesus, "Come and heal my broken
[7:28] spirit." And somehow Jesus came and
[7:33] brought victory.
[7:36] Oh, victory in Jesus, my
[7:41] savior forever. For he sought me and he
[7:46] bought me with his redeeming blood.
[7:50] Well, he loved the end. I knew him and
[7:55] all the love is due. He loves me to
[8:01] victory beneath the seat again.
[8:05] Oh victory in Jesus my savior
[8:11] forever. Well he sought me and he bought
[8:15] me but his redeeming love. Well he loved
[8:20] me. I knew him and all the love is to
[8:25] me. He will launch me to

[20:36] They said that nothing compared to what
[20:39] was waiting up there. How one day we
[20:42] would finally be
[20:44] free. Well, I've never seen it. But I
[20:48] keep on believing it will be a place
[20:51] like I've never
[20:53] known. I keep my eyes on the sky cuz my
[20:56] soul wants to
[20:58] fly. But my heart is ready to go.
[21:03] I want to know how it
[21:07] feels to make my way down the streets of
[21:11] gold. I want to know how it
[21:15] feels to have a talk with the saints of
[21:20] gold. I want to know what it's
[21:24] like to rest my feet by the river of
[21:28] life.
[21:30] I've heard of heaven and I know that
[21:32] it's
[21:33] real. I want to know how it
[21:39] feels. Sometimes I get weary from this
[21:43] life that I live and see my peace is
[21:46] something I'll never
[21:48] find. I've tried to lighten my load when
[21:51] all that I have will show is 700 things
[21:55] on my mind.
[21:58] Well, I'm seeing visions of a crystal
[22:01] clearar river where sins forgotten
[22:04] without a
[22:06] trace. More than I've ever dreamed. My
[22:09] eyes want to see the look above on my
[22:13] savior's
[22:15] face. I want to know how it
[22:20] feels to make my way down the streets of
[22:23] gold.
[22:25] I want to know how it
[22:29] feels to have a talk with the saints of
[22:33] home. I want to know what it's
[22:37] like to rest my feet by the river of
[22:42] life. I've heard of heaven and I know
[22:45] that it's
[22:47] real. I want to know how it feels.
[22:54] Sometimes I get weary from this life
[22:56] that I lived and seem like peace is
[22:59] something I'll ever
[23:01] find. I try to lighten my load when all
[23:05] that I have to show is 700 things on my
[23:10] mind. Well, I'm seeing visions of a
[23:14] crystal clear river where sins forgotten
[23:17] without a
[23:19] trace. More than I've ever dreamed. My
[23:23] eyes want to see the look of love on my
[23:26] savior's
[23:29] face. I want to know how it
[23:33] feels. To make my way down the streets
[23:36] of
[23:38] gold. I want to know how it
[23:40] [Music]
[23:42] feels to have my talk with the saints of
[23:46] old.
[23:47] I want to know what it's
[23:51] like to rest my feet by the river of
[23:55] life. I've heard of heaven and I know
[23:59] that it's
[24:00] real. I want to know how it
[24:04] feels. I've heard of heaven and I know
[24:07] that it's

[24:59] Praise the Lord, church.
[25:01] I've been in the message all my life and
[25:03] this is the first time I've been here.
[25:05] Where have I
[25:07] been? I think I've been overseas half my
[25:10] life. God bless you. It's good to be
[25:12] here. There's a little song. Actually,
[25:15] it's an old Pentecostal song. song. I
[25:17] don't know the name of it, but u I call
[25:20] it the Holy Ghost song. So trust you'll
[25:23] do something for you tonight. Amen.
[25:26] Well, it's not
[25:28] form and it's not
[25:31] fashion. Well, it's salvation sent from
[25:34] God. It suits me
[25:37] fine. I said it's old, but it's
[25:42] new. It's powerful and it's true. I
[25:46] praise God. This Holy Ghost is genuine.

[26:10] new. It's powerful and it's true. I
[26:15] praise God. This Holy Ghost is
[26:20] genuine. Well, on the day of
[26:25] Pentecost, there assembled but a few,
[26:29] but the most important thing had yet to
[26:35] come. Then from heaven, God did send
[26:40] like a mighty rushing wind. And they
[26:44] found this Holy Ghost was
[26:49] genuine. Said it's
[26:52] not and it's not
[26:56] passion. Well, it's salvation said God.
[27:01] It suits me
[27:03] fine. I said it's more but it's blue.
[27:08] It's powerful and it's true. I praise
[27:13] God this Holy Ghost you
[27:17] wide. Well, if the devil has you
[27:22] down and he's running you
[27:25] around, my friend, there's only one
[27:28] thing left for you to do.
[27:33] Well, just repent and be
[27:37] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[27:41] you'll find this Holy Ghost is
[27:46] genuine. Well, it's not
[27:50] for and it's not
[27:54] passion, but it's salvation sent from
[27:58] God. It suits me fine.
[28:01] Glory said, "It's old, but it's
[28:05] new. It's powerful and it's true. I
[28:10] praise God. This Holy Ghost is
[28:15] genuine." Well, it's
[28:19] not and it's not
[28:23] passion. Well, it's salvation sent from
[28:27] God. It suits me fine.
[28:31] said, "It's old, but it's
[28:34] new. It's powerful and it's true. I
[28:39] praise God. This Holy Ghost, can
[28:45] you God bless you tonight, church?" You
[28:48] know, this
[28:50] song to me, this song is about the
[28:53] message. It's not form. It's not
[28:55] passion, but it's nothing but the Holy
[28:57] Ghost sent right to us. God bless you.

[39:34] How many's happy to be in the house of
[39:35] the Lord?
[39:38] All right, tell your neighbor, I'm happy

[39:42] right, now tell your face, I'm happy to
[39:44] be in the house of the Lord. Blessed be
[39:47] the name of the most high God. God bless
[39:50] you. It's good to be here tonight. Amen.
[39:54] I tell you what, I you don't realize how
[39:56] bad you miss somebody till you leave.
[39:58] And I tell you what, I I found I have
[40:01] missed my people. God bless you. We love
[40:04] you so
[40:05] much. Amen. Amen. God bless you. We love
[40:10] you so much. And bring greetings from
[40:13] the brothers and sisters there in New
[40:14] Zealand. And I know that there's a few
[40:17] of you that's already watched those
[40:18] meetings. And and uh I tell you, we were
[40:21] just blessed to be able to go. And we
[40:23] found a we found another portion of the
[40:24] bride of Jesus Christ on the other end
[40:27] of the world that that loves this
[40:29] message just as much and you and I love
[40:31] this message. And I and brother Andrew
[40:34] said I he said he said first he said I
[40:35] saw you. He said I thought you know what
[40:37] he just doesn't have a he just doesn't
[40:39] have enough he doesn't have enough
[40:40] revival. He said so I brought him all
[40:42] the way down here to New Zealand so he
[40:43] could get a hold of some of our revival
[40:45] down here. So, so if I'm a different
[40:47] man, you can blame it on brother Andrew
[40:48] down there and brother Andrew Donaldson
[40:50] and my we just we had a wonderful time.
[40:53] I found uh I found a friend that I've
[40:55] been missing all my life and and uh it
[40:58] was just a wonderful time in the Lord
[41:00] and uh Lord blessed us and I know I I
[41:02] watch the services back here at home and
[41:04] the Lord blessed you abundantly. Thank
[41:06] you, brother William, for a wonderful
[41:08] word. Brother Matthew, God richly bless
[41:10] you and brother Ron all the way down
[41:11] there in Louisiana. I was on the mission
[41:13] field and brother Ron was on the mission
[41:15] field too. You need a passport to get
[41:17] through Arkansas down in Louisiana. So
[41:19] God richly blessed them brothers. And my
[41:22] I tell you what, I left and the world
[41:23] fell apart. The Pope died, Jay got
[41:36] engaged. We're so happy for Brother Jay
[41:38] and Sister Alessa. We just want to say
[41:40] God bless you. Amen.
[41:42] Wow. I had to leave for it to happen,
[41:45] but praise the Lord. Ladies, he's off
[41:47] the field
[41:49] now. Praise the
[41:52] Lord.
[41:54] Hallelujah. My my my. There's so much we
[41:57] could say, Brother Jay. But God bless
[41:59] you. We certainly love Brother Jay with
[42:01] all of our heart. And Sister Alyssa, we
[42:04] pray special prayers for you. God bless
[42:06] you, sis. Amen. We just we love them
[42:08] with all of our heart. They're special
[42:10] to us. and certainly thankful to have
[42:12] brother Kenny here with us tonight. God
[42:14] bless you, brother. It's good to have
[42:15] you here. Took you a little bit to get

[42:19] here. Been a while. Well, God bless you,
[42:21] buddy. We love you for all all that's
[42:23] within us. Amen. Maybe we'll just have a
[42:25] key of A. And I'm so excited to see you.
[42:28] I got to calm my nerves down a little
[42:30] bit. So,
[42:32] Amen. You love the Lord.
[42:35] And I tell you what, I had I was a part
[42:37] of a meeting last weekend. We had a
[42:38] convention. But I I believe right now.
[42:40] Right
[42:41] now. Oh, I feel it bubbling on the
[42:44] inside of me. We can have a convention
[42:45] right now.
[42:47] You ain't got to wait for a special
[42:49] meeting. You ain't got to wait for some
[42:50] preacher to come by
[42:51] [Applause]
[42:54] here.
[42:56] Hallelujah. I sing praises to your
[43:01] [Music]

[45:45] hand. Clap of praise tonight.
[45:48] Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[45:52] If you have your Bibles this evening,
[45:54] we'd like to look over in the book of
[45:55] Genesis chapter 3. Genesis chapter 3 and
[45:58] verse 13 and also down to Matthew chap
[46:02] 13 as
[46:13] well. Hallelujah.
[46:17] So thankful the Lord blessed us in our
[46:20] Easter, but I say it's Easter again.
[46:25] Amen. The prophet taught us that it's
[46:27] Easter every day. Amen. Amen. Let's just
[46:31] go to the Lord in prayer. How many How
[46:34] many has a need tonight that you need
[46:35] the Lord to move on? Amen. You need the
[46:38] Lord to move tonight. I know I've I've
[46:41] got notes from all over the place, just
[46:43] special needs, and we just want to be
[46:45] mindful of the the body of Christ. Amen.
[46:49] Just want to remember those here, those
[46:51] that are not here, and the believers
[46:53] around the world that Father would that
[46:55] the Father would minister to them
[46:56] tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, we come
[46:59] before you, Lord Jesus. Lord, what a
[47:02] special spot that we're standing in,
[47:04] Lord Jesus. God, this building does not
[47:07] hold you. These pews, these seats, this
[47:11] little portion of of this little
[47:13] building here does not hold you. But
[47:16] what holds you is this
[47:18] body, Father. And you've come one more
[47:20] time, Lord Jesus, to enter into these
[47:23] temples, Father, and to fill them with
[47:25] more revelation, more power, more truth,
[47:28] more definition of who you are, Lord.
[47:31] And we are asking Lord right now in the
[47:33] presence of Jehovah that you would come
[47:36] by our way here in Elton, Virginia. And
[47:39] that you would begin to bless us
[47:40] according to thy holy word. Now Lord,
[47:43] there are needs that are presented.
[47:44] Lord, there's a brother that just sent
[47:46] us a note just a little bit ago. Lord
[47:48] has been fighting a fever for 10 days.
[47:50] And Father, I pray in the name of Jesus
[47:53] Christ that you would break that hold of
[47:55] the enemy that has a hold of him right
[47:57] now. That you would allow him to have
[47:59] relief in his body. Father, Lord,
[48:02] there's many, Lord, that are sick.
[48:03] There's many that have needs. There's
[48:05] many that are here in the room, Lord
[48:06] Jesus. Father, and as if we could say it
[48:09] like this. We're in a hospital room.
[48:11] There's many people that are needing
[48:13] heart surgery here tonight. There's many
[48:15] people that are needing things that are
[48:16] done upon their extremities of the body.
[48:19] And we're asking, Lord, that the Holy
[48:21] Spirit would just begin to move in this
[48:22] place. Lord, we have prayed, we have
[48:25] asked, and we have sought that you would
[48:27] meet us. Father, I know what you have
[48:29] done for me in my study today. And I
[48:31] pray, Lord, that you would allow my
[48:33] heart to just relax just for a moment so
[48:36] that you can preach, Lord, what you have
[48:38] given unto me, Lord, in this moment.
[48:40] Lord, I ask, God, that you would just do
[48:43] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[48:45] could ask or think according to the
[48:47] power that workketh in us. And Father,
[48:49] you said we have not because we ask not.
[48:52] Father, my cup is up. Lord, my hand is
[48:54] up. My heart is here upon this altar.
[48:57] And I'm praying God that you would just
[48:58] move in a very special way according to
[49:01] your word. We put oursel in submission
[49:04] to your Holy Spirit. Just now in Jesus
[49:07] Christ's name we pray these things.
[49:09] Amen. And amen. Genesis 3 and verse 13.
[49:13] And the Lord God said unto the woman,
[49:16] "What is this that thou hast done?" And
[49:19] the woman said, "The serpent begiled me,
[49:22] and I did eat." And the Lord God said
[49:24] unto the serpent, "Because thou hast
[49:26] done this, thou art cursed above all
[49:29] cattle, and above every beast of the
[49:31] field, upon thy belly shalt thou go, and
[49:34] dust thou shalt eat all the days of thy
[49:38] life. And I will put enmity between thee
[49:41] and the woman, and between thy seed and
[49:44] her seed, and it shall bruise thy head,
[49:47] and thou shalt bruise his heel."
[49:50] Matthew chapter 13 and verse three, we
[49:53] realize that when God makes this
[49:55] prophecy, it is in the most darkest of
[49:58] hours when he makes this prophecy that
[50:01] I'm going to put enmity between the
[50:03] woman seed, thy seed, the serpent's
[50:07] seed, and between her seed. We realize
[50:09] that the prophet told us that the woman
[50:11] does not have a seed, but she has a
[50:13] field. So we realize that in this moment
[50:16] in this trial that we realize that God
[50:18] is making a very prominent prophecy over
[50:21] top of his children. Matthew
[50:25] 13:3 and he spake many things unto them
[50:28] in parables saying behold a swer went
[50:30] forth to sow and when he sowed some some
[50:33] seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls
[50:36] came and devoured them. Some fell upon
[50:40] stony ground where they had not much
[50:42] earth. And forth with they sprung up
[50:45] because they had no deepness of earth.
[50:47] And when the sun was up, they were
[50:49] scorched. And because they had no root,
[50:52] they withered away. And some fell
[50:54] amongst thorns, and the thorns sprung up
[50:57] and choked them. But others fell into
[51:00] good ground.
[51:03] Right here it is. Good ground. But some
[51:07] fell on the wayside and some fell into
[51:10] the thorny ground. But some fell into
[51:12] good ground.
[51:14] Some fell in good ground. You think
[51:16] about how you even got here in the
[51:18] picture was because you were good ground
[51:20] before you even look like good ground.
[51:23] I was I was talking about sister terror
[51:25] this week. I was telling some brothers
[51:26] and sisters all the way on the other
[51:28] side of the world that it didn't look
[51:30] like you was good ground at one point.
[51:31] Didn't look like you wanted anything to
[51:33] do with this seed, but God knew you was
[51:35] good ground.
[51:36] You were in the same situation. You
[51:38] didn't look like it and you looked like
[51:40] a like a like a bad spot. But God knew
[51:43] what kind of ground that he was sewing
[51:44] this seed in. But others fell on good
[51:47] ground and brought forth some 100fold,
[51:50] some 60fold, and some 30fold. Whoath
[51:53] ears to hear, let him hear. May God
[51:55] bless his word. You may be seated here
[51:57] tonight in the presence of the Lord. I'd
[52:00] like to just jump down to verse 24
[52:02] there. And the the Bible said, "And
[52:04] another parable put he forth unto them,
[52:06] saying, The kingdom of heaven is like
[52:08] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[52:09] field. But while he slept, his enemy
[52:12] came and sowed tears amongst the weed,
[52:14] and went his way." But when the blade
[52:16] was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
[52:18] then appeared the tears also. So the
[52:20] servants of the householder came, and
[52:22] said unto him, "Sir, did thou not sow
[52:24] good seed in thy field, from which then
[52:27] hath it tears?" And he said unto him,
[52:29] "An enemy hath done this?" The servant
[52:31] said unto him, "Wilt thou then that we
[52:33] should go and gather them up?" But he
[52:35] said, "No, nay, lest while ye gather up
[52:37] the tears, you root up also the wheat
[52:39] with them, wheat with them, let both
[52:42] grow together until the harvest and the
[52:44] time of harvest. And I will say to the
[52:46] reapers, I will say to the reapers,
[52:49] gather ye first the tears, and bind them
[52:52] in bundles, and burn them, but gather
[52:54] the wheat into my barn." Notice what
[52:57] Jesus said in verse 37. He that sweth
[53:00] the good seed is the son of man. The
[53:02] field is the world. The good seed are
[53:05] the children of the kingdom. But the
[53:06] tears are the children of the wicked
[53:09] one. The enemy that sowed them is the
[53:12] devil. The harvest is the end of the
[53:15] world and the reapers are the angels. By
[53:18] by the help of the Lord, I'd like to
[53:20] just continue on a thought that the Lord
[53:21] placed on our heart a couple weeks ago.
[53:23] We spoke a portion of that here a few
[53:26] weeks ago on the attack on the field.
[53:28] The attack on the field. Now when Jesus
[53:30] comes here and he uses the parable of
[53:33] the swer and the seed that some fell on
[53:35] good ground and some fell on thorny
[53:37] ground and some fell on stony ground.
[53:39] Brother Brandham would talk about that
[53:41] dusty ground that it was dusty ground
[53:43] that we that it was dusty ground of
[53:45] denominations. And immediately when you
[53:48] watch as Jesus shows the parable of the
[53:51] swer, you begin to watch the battle that
[53:53] is there in the scriptures that that's
[53:55] just like the preaching of the gospel.
[53:58] We don't know who is what and we don't
[53:59] know exactly where it's going to fall
[54:01] at. But our job is simply to to preach
[54:04] the gospel to sew the gospel. And we
[54:06] realize that when that seed is sown in
[54:09] good ground, that then you begin to
[54:11] watch the attack of the enemy come in
[54:13] there and he begins to attack. He begins
[54:15] to attack the field because he realizes
[54:18] he realizes that there there is a
[54:21] harvest that is to come if there is a
[54:23] good seed that is sown. So we realize
[54:25] that Satan is not afraid. He's not
[54:28] afraid of a necessarily not necessarily
[54:31] afraid of the field, but he's afraid of
[54:33] the harvest that'll come forth from the
[54:35] field because he realizes that there is
[54:37] a potential for a birth. And if there is
[54:40] a potential for a birth, then that then
[54:42] it's going to go through a process. If
[54:44] it's going to go through a process, then
[54:46] there's got to be pressures. There's got
[54:48] to be battles. There's going to be
[54:49] opposition. But we realize this that God
[54:52] is the God that defends his seed.
[54:56] You notice immediately when Jesus starts
[54:59] reading and teaching us in Matthew
[55:00] chapter 13 that the that the enemy
[55:03] doesn't go out there and attack empty
[55:05] fields.
[55:07] Is anybody going to preach with me
[55:08] tonight? The enemy doesn't go out there
[55:10] and attack empty fields, but he
[55:12] literally goes out there and fights
[55:14] fertile rooms. He literally goes out
[55:16] there and fights the good ground where
[55:18] the seed has been sown at. And God has
[55:21] something that he has deposited has the
[55:23] power to transform itself. Now, the
[55:27] prophet would come and he would preach,
[55:28] he would preach a very powerful message
[55:30] on the harvest time. And there, brother
[55:33] Brandon would teach us and he would show
[55:35] us that we're in a very significant
[55:36] period in this course of life. And it's
[55:39] it's identified as the scripture said
[55:42] that the harvest is at the end time. Now
[55:45] the purpose of this time is so that he
[55:48] could prepare a people for his second
[55:51] coming. Now brother Brandham when he's
[55:52] there in the harvest time, brother
[55:54] Brandham and in different places he will
[55:56] begin to lay in some things about the
[55:58] different stages of the wheat that it's
[56:00] going to go. It's going to go through
[56:02] its different stages of stalk. It's
[56:05] going to go from blade stalk from tassel
[56:07] to shook. Then back to the original seed
[56:10] again. And brother man is in there and
[56:12] he begins to show us that in there that
[56:15] there we begin to watch the various
[56:17] church ages. There we begin to watch the
[56:19] various movement of the Holy Spirit. And
[56:21] brother Brandon would teach us that they
[56:23] were not the life but they were simply
[56:25] the carrier of life. Is that right? They
[56:28] were simply carriers of the life. They
[56:30] had a portion of life, but they were
[56:32] simply the life was simply just passing
[56:35] through Luther. It was passing through
[56:37] Wesley. It was passing through the
[56:39] Pentecostal age. And now we realize that
[56:41] we've come and completely made a return
[56:44] to the original seed back in its
[56:47] complete restoration again. And you
[56:50] begin to watch as the prophet begins to
[56:52] teach us and lay out some very
[56:54] fundamental things that he shows us that
[56:56] Satan comes in there by different powers
[56:59] to begin to delude and to deceive and to
[57:02] corrupt the seed that God has put in the
[57:05] ground. But we realize that we're in a
[57:08] very special spot because there was a
[57:10] prophet that stood through uh many years
[57:13] ago, thousands of years ago, and said
[57:16] that I will restore, sayeth the Lord,
[57:19] all the years, the cankerworm, the
[57:21] caterpillar, and the palmer worm, all
[57:23] those
[57:24] things. He said, I'm going to restore
[57:27] that. and I'm going to restore that
[57:30] means and shows us that we realize that
[57:33] we are in a pre very special spot.
[57:38] Hallelujah. We're in a very special
[57:40] spot. I don't know if you know this, but
[57:43] it's harvest time, brother. It's harvest
[57:46] time, sister. And if it's harvest time,
[57:49] it means that there is a maturing that
[57:51] has taken place. You're not like you
[57:54] were. Paul said, "When I was a child, I
[57:57] spake as a child. But when I became a
[57:59] man, I started talking like a man." You
[58:02] see, you could not understand this. In
[58:05] the birth, in the birth when we were
[58:07] back in there 47, but you watch the
[58:10] maturing of the bride where we are, we
[58:14] watch and recognize that we have come to
[58:16] a spot where the grain has matured and
[58:20] has been separated away from the shook.
[58:23] That's why the prophet would come there
[58:25] and he would teach that the seed is not
[58:28] heir with the shuck that you didn't have
[58:31] nothing to do with Ishmael that you
[58:33] didn't have nothing to do with
[58:34] Catholicism
[58:37] but the sun the presence of the sen
[58:41] begin to shine its light on you and
[58:44] because there was something there
[58:47] hallelujah because there was something
[58:49] there laying there you begin to lay in
[58:52] presence of the sen and it begin to
[58:56] mature that gene seed of God that he
[58:59] deposited. But it took the light.
[59:02] It took the light, brother, to bring you
[59:05] to life. But we realize that we are not
[59:07] hopeless in this generation. We realize
[59:10] that we are with that we're not without
[59:12] hope. We realize that we're in a special
[59:14] spot because we realize that a prophet
[59:17] said that in the evening time, it shall
[59:21] be light. Though they might be groping
[59:23] in darkness, they shall have light.
[59:27] Now, you might not understand this, but
[59:30] before that seed can manifest what it
[59:32] is, it's got to have some light that
[59:35] begins to shine over top of it. And you
[59:38] watch the light manifest. What was
[59:40] originally sown Amen.
[59:43] Now that's a powerful place to draw
[59:45] from. But brother Brandham said in why
[59:48] I'm a holy roller. He said now in
[59:50] Genesis was a seed chapter where all the
[59:53] seeds were sown. He said everything that
[59:55] you find in the world today came out of
[59:58] Genesis. Everything back there began
[1:00:00] back there in the beginning. He said now
[1:00:03] it's like sewing a crop. He said, "If
[1:00:05] you watch what kind of of a seed you
[1:00:07] got, no matter what it looks like when
[1:00:09] it's this high, you have to see what it
[1:00:12] is, what the seed is, you have to you
[1:00:15] have to see what it'll be when it comes
[1:00:17] to the seed." He said, "If it's a wheat,
[1:00:20] a corn, or whatever it is," he said, "It
[1:00:22] might look like a weed, but if it's a
[1:00:25] wheat down
[1:00:26] here, it might look like a weed, but if
[1:00:30] it's a wheat down here in the bottom,
[1:00:32] it'll produce a wheat up there.
[1:00:38] It might look like a wheat, but if it's
[1:00:41] a wheat down here,
[1:00:43] it might look corrupted, but if it's a
[1:00:46] wheat down here, if it's a gene seed of
[1:00:49] God down here, what are you saying? I'm
[1:00:51] saying it like this. Jacob looked like a
[1:00:53] weed. He looked messy. His life was
[1:00:57] messy. His life was sticky. He ran in
[1:01:00] his life. He served Laban in his life.
[1:01:02] He feared in his life. But yet on the
[1:01:06] inside of Jacob, he did not have the
[1:01:08] seat of a deceiver on the inside of him.
[1:01:11] He did not have the seat of a cyster on
[1:01:13] the inside of him.
[1:01:15] His first nature was sticky. His first
[1:01:17] nature had a deceiver on him. But on the
[1:01:19] inside of him,
[1:01:21] it was not the seed of a weed. It was a
[1:01:24] seed of a wheat.
[1:01:26] Come on, somebody. In your life, there's
[1:01:29] going to be some sewing. There's going
[1:01:30] to be growth and then there's going to
[1:01:32] be harvest. And in Jacob's sewing, the
[1:01:35] Bible said that he was chosen for a
[1:01:37] destiny.
[1:01:39] How many knows the Bible says that about
[1:01:41] Jacob? That Jacob I have loved and Esau
[1:01:44] I've hated. So he was swn into a
[1:01:46] destiny. He was swn into a destiny. Even
[1:01:50] Hallelujah. Even when it did not look
[1:01:52] like Jacob was Jacob, even when it
[1:01:55] looked like Jacob was a Jacob, he did
[1:01:57] not look like a prince with power. But
[1:02:00] on the inside of him laid the power, the
[1:02:04] growth that he was going to go through,
[1:02:07] he was sold to a destiny. And his
[1:02:10] growth, he wrestled with fear. He
[1:02:13] wrestled with deceit. He wrestled with
[1:02:15] hardship.
[1:02:18] But the
[1:02:19] harvest, the harvest, the harvest, I
[1:02:22] said the harvest showed that he was a
[1:02:25] prince.
[1:02:27] What are you saying? And I'm saying your
[1:02:28] outward struggles do not define you.
[1:02:34] I'm going to preach to somebody on the
[1:02:35] internet here tonight. I'm going to
[1:02:37] preach to somebody on internet here
[1:02:38] tonight. But your outward struggles do
[1:02:41] not define you. You see, the seed that
[1:02:44] God placed on the inside of you. The
[1:02:46] struggles will never destroy the seed,
[1:02:49] but they will reveal it.
[1:02:53] Your struggle does
[1:02:55] not Your struggle does not make you,
[1:02:58] your struggle does not destroy you, but
[1:03:00] your struggles reveal what's on the
[1:03:03] inside of you.
[1:03:06] Now, notice when the prophet is standing
[1:03:09] there and you remember when the spirit
[1:03:11] of the Lord comes to him and tells him
[1:03:13] to pick up your pen and write. If you've
[1:03:16] ever read that and you haven't read it,
[1:03:19] go back and read it again because that
[1:03:21] is not the mind of William Brandham.
[1:03:24] That was coming right from the mind of
[1:03:26] Elohim. That's what I love about this
[1:03:29] message is this message didn't come from
[1:03:31] a hillbilly Kentucky. This message
[1:03:33] didn't come from somebody that was
[1:03:35] without education. This message came
[1:03:38] from the mind of almighty God. When you
[1:03:41] read them seal books, there is no other
[1:03:43] book in all the libraries and all the
[1:03:46] United States and all over the world
[1:03:48] that can contain the power that is
[1:03:51] released right there in them seven
[1:03:52] seals.
[1:03:54] Why? Because it came from the mind of
[1:03:57] Elohim.
[1:03:59] Now the prophet I believe it's going to
[1:04:00] mean something to you, brother Joel. He
[1:04:02] said, "Now one night I was I was seeking
[1:04:04] the Lord." He said, 'The Holy Spirit
[1:04:06] told me to pick up my pen and write. As
[1:04:09] I grasp that pen to write, his spirit
[1:04:12] gave me a message for the church. He
[1:04:14] said, I want to bring it to you. It has
[1:04:17] to do with the word and the bride. Here
[1:04:20] is what I'm trying to say to you. The
[1:04:22] law of reproduction is that each species
[1:04:26] brings forth after its own kind. Even
[1:04:29] according to Genesis 1 and 11 that God
[1:04:32] said, "Let the earth bring forth grass
[1:04:35] and the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[1:04:37] tree yielding fruit after his kind whose
[1:04:39] seed is in itself. Upon the earth it was
[1:04:42] so." Whatever life was in the seed came
[1:04:45] forth into the plant and then into the
[1:04:48] fruit. He said the very same law applies
[1:04:51] to the church today. Whatever seed
[1:04:54] started the church will come forth and
[1:04:56] be like the original seed because it is
[1:04:59] the same seed.
[1:05:03] How many's on the same page with me? Now
[1:05:05] watch and capture the depth and the
[1:05:08] beauty of what the prophet picks up. He
[1:05:11] said notice this is the spirit of God
[1:05:13] speaking. In these last days, the true
[1:05:16] bride church, Christ seed, will come to
[1:05:20] the headstone and she will be a super
[1:05:22] church, a super race. As she nears him,
[1:05:26] they in the bride will be so much like
[1:05:28] him that they will be in his very image.
[1:05:34] That's not the mind of William Brandham.
[1:05:36] That's the mind of Christ. This is in
[1:05:38] order to be united with him. They will
[1:05:42] be one.
[1:05:43] They will be one.
[1:05:46] There will be no strife between the
[1:05:48] bride and the bridegroom. But they will
[1:05:50] be one.
[1:05:53] Hallelujah. There is no disagreement
[1:05:55] between the bride and the bridegroom.
[1:05:58] There is no idea in the bride that isn't
[1:06:00] in the bridegroom. There is no concept
[1:06:03] that is in the bride that is not in the
[1:06:05] bridegroom. Everything that he is, she
[1:06:08] is. That's why we can say he's the same
[1:06:11] yesterday, today, and forever. And the
[1:06:13] prophet would say she is him. It's
[1:06:16] because
[1:06:17] it's because your flesh is containing
[1:06:20] the very life.
[1:06:24] Ain't no wonder Satan's trying to attack
[1:06:26] the field.
[1:06:28] Ain't no wonder he's trying to stop you
[1:06:30] from getting to this message. Ain't no
[1:06:32] wonder he's trying to keep you from
[1:06:34] getting the Holy Ghost. Ain't no wonder
[1:06:41] This is in order to be united with him.
[1:06:45] They will be one. They will be the very
[1:06:49] manifestation of the word of the living
[1:06:52] God. You see, that's why you needed a
[1:06:56] Pentecost. That's why you had to go into
[1:06:59] the upper room. That's why you needed a
[1:07:01] feast of first fruits. That's why you
[1:07:03] had to know that it was Sunday again.
[1:07:06] Come on. There's a lot of people that
[1:07:08] went to church last Sunday. There's a
[1:07:10] lot of people that got up and thank God
[1:07:12] for the resurrection. But I'm not
[1:07:14] talking about a resurrection of 2,000
[1:07:16] years ago. I say it's Sunday again. I
[1:07:20] say he's here. I say he's manifested. I
[1:07:24] say he's right here in the room. That's
[1:07:26] why you got to have a Pentecost. You've
[1:07:29] got to have a Pentecost where the wave
[1:07:31] chief is waved over your life and you
[1:07:34] come up and show that the same power
[1:07:38] that was in the first one is in this
[1:07:40] one.
[1:07:42] I love what the prophet said. People ask
[1:07:44] what is Pentecost and the prophet gave
[1:07:47] us a very clear explanation. He said,
[1:07:50] "It's a restoration of the same kind of
[1:07:52] grain that went into the ground at the
[1:07:54] beginning, bringing back all the
[1:07:56] fullness of the power of Pentecost by
[1:07:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:08:00] last days." Oh, it's a great thing to
[1:08:02] look at that and believe it. He said,
[1:08:04] "But now in this age that we're now
[1:08:06] living in," he said, "It's beyond
[1:08:09] Pentecost."
[1:08:11] This is Come on. It ain't good enough
[1:08:14] just it ain't good enough just go back
[1:08:16] to
[1:08:17] Pentecost. Come on. You look out there
[1:08:19] at the world. You watch it. You watch
[1:08:21] You watch the Pentecostal move right
[1:08:23] now. They are calling for a 1906
[1:08:26] revival. That's what they're asking for.
[1:08:29] That's all they know. But this bride
[1:08:33] doesn't have to wish for revival. This
[1:08:35] bride doesn't have to hope to be back
[1:08:37] there. But she's got the same power
[1:08:41] that fell on the day of Pentecost. But
[1:08:43] even greater than that, she is under the
[1:08:46] anointing of a mighty angel that has
[1:08:49] anointed her with the same spirit and
[1:08:52] the same anointing.
[1:08:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In the Ephesians
[1:08:58] church age, he said, "But thank God in
[1:09:01] the last age, there will be a group
[1:09:02] that'll rise up. The true bride of the
[1:09:05] last age of the last day, she will
[1:09:07] listen to the spirit in that day of
[1:09:09] gross darkness. The light will return to
[1:09:13] the pure word and we will return to the
[1:09:16] power of Pentecost to welcome back the
[1:09:20] Lord Jesus.
[1:09:25] Lord, y'all okay?
[1:09:29] This is full Gospel Lighthouse. I I
[1:09:31] ain't got my glasses on. Lord, I thought
[1:09:33] somebody
[1:09:36] died. Lord have mercy.
[1:09:40] What y'all do last weekend? Y'all tore
[1:09:43] it up. You wore their amens out of them.
[1:09:45] Now, you watch. You watch. When it comes
[1:09:48] to this, there's a battle. There's a
[1:09:51] battle that's going on. You notice what
[1:09:54] the prophet said in wisdom versus faith.
[1:09:55] He said, "Now, you see that seed word
[1:09:58] cannot grow in that atmosphere of
[1:10:00] knowledge. As soon as knowledge mixes
[1:10:02] with faith, it dies." Right there. It's
[1:10:05] like Peter walking on water.
[1:10:08] He was fine as long as he was walking in
[1:10:10] faith. But when he began to mix it with
[1:10:12] knowledge, he died right there.
[1:10:16] Again, the prophet said that Holy Ghost
[1:10:17] seeds of the Bible cannot grow in the
[1:10:20] atmosphere of wisdom.
[1:10:22] It cannot grow. That's why you cannot
[1:10:24] preach to this bride and intellectual
[1:10:27] conception.
[1:10:29] That's why you can't stand there and
[1:10:30] give her an education on how to get the
[1:10:32] Holy Ghost and how to be a better
[1:10:34] Christian and how to be a better person
[1:10:36] because knowledge will kill you.
[1:10:40] But faith will manifest in the very
[1:10:43] atmosphere of faith what God has
[1:10:45] destined that seed to become.
[1:10:48] You see, until he stops calling, and I
[1:10:50] believe he's still calling, that
[1:10:52] Pentecostal message and power will never
[1:10:55] cease.
[1:10:57] The prophet said that what the church
[1:10:59] had at Pentecost is her inalienable
[1:11:02] right.
[1:11:04] That means that ain't no devil going to
[1:11:06] take it from you. There ain't no there
[1:11:08] ain't no high fallutin devil going to
[1:11:10] take it from you. There ain't no low
[1:11:12] devil that can take it from you. What
[1:11:14] the church had at Pentecost is her
[1:11:18] inalienable right.
[1:11:20] I say cancer can't take it from you.
[1:11:22] Leosa can't take it from you. Come on
[1:11:25] now. The devil himself and all of his
[1:11:28] angels that fell from him, that fell
[1:11:30] with him in the beginning, they can't
[1:11:32] take it from you. The denominations
[1:11:34] can't take it from you. The church world
[1:11:36] can't take it from you. Your mama can't
[1:11:38] take it from you.
[1:11:40] Your It is
[1:11:43] unable. Tell the devil you can't take
[1:11:45] his power from me.
[1:11:48] Tell the devil you can't take his power
[1:11:50] from me. You might try. You might tempt.
[1:11:54] might you might try to flood but you'll
[1:11:56] never take this away from me.
[1:12:02] Now notice in the garden in the creation
[1:12:07] that anything that you see now brother
[1:12:10] man said I took two years and I study
[1:12:12] out all of Genesis. He said I studied
[1:12:15] out. He said everything that you see in
[1:12:17] the world today he said started back
[1:12:20] there in Genesis. He said in the
[1:12:23] beginning, he said you could trace it
[1:12:25] all the way back. And when God is
[1:12:27] standing there in creation and he begins
[1:12:30] to speak to the earth and the Bible said
[1:12:33] that out of the ground the Lord God
[1:12:35] formed every beast of the field and
[1:12:38] every fowl of the air and brought them
[1:12:41] unto Adam to see what he could call
[1:12:43] them. And whatsoever Adam called every
[1:12:46] living creature, that was the name
[1:12:50] thereof.
[1:12:52] So, Adam begins to watch as God begins
[1:12:55] to draw the cattle right out of the
[1:12:57] ground. And he watches the nature of it
[1:13:00] and he calls it by its name. He watches
[1:13:03] God bring the tiger out. He watches God
[1:13:06] bring Leo the lion out and he calls it
[1:13:08] that. He calls it according to its
[1:13:11] nature. It's like a father that is named
[1:13:15] his child and he watches that child how
[1:13:19] that it responds when it calls its name.
[1:13:22] It's like brother William calling out to
[1:13:24] Elijah. There might be another Elijah in
[1:13:27] this room like there is but there's only
[1:13:29] one Elijah Borivan that has the ability
[1:13:32] to respond to the father like brother
[1:13:35] Elijah does. Even though there's another
[1:13:38] Elijah here,
[1:13:41] only one has the ability to respond like
[1:13:45] brother Elijah does. And when these
[1:13:48] creatures are watching as Aodam is
[1:13:51] beginning to manifest and begins to call
[1:13:54] to them, they have a response because
[1:13:57] they recognize that the voice that put
[1:14:00] them in the ground. The ability of that
[1:14:03] voice was now in a human body and was
[1:14:06] now speaking to that flesh. It was
[1:14:09] speaking to that potass. It was speaking
[1:14:11] to that calcium.
[1:14:14] If I can just get you to believe
[1:14:17] this, that you'll begin to respond to
[1:14:19] the father's spirit as he begins to work
[1:14:22] and brood over you. That you'll
[1:14:25] recognize his purpose of being born is
[1:14:29] to become his womb.
[1:14:34] To become his womb where he could sew
[1:14:37] his seed in your field. Notice as these
[1:14:42] beasts are coming up out of the field,
[1:14:44] there's another beast
[1:14:45] there. There's a beast that is more
[1:14:48] subtle than any of the beast of the
[1:14:53] field. And Satan is very close as God is
[1:14:57] working his spoken word through Adam as
[1:15:01] he's calling to them. Satan's watching
[1:15:04] this. He goes to a place where seeds are
[1:15:07] being sown. He comes to this field and
[1:15:10] he watched the field begin to manifest
[1:15:13] what God had deposited. There's things
[1:15:16] that are laying in the ground,
[1:15:17] potassium, and all the minerals. And up
[1:15:20] out of the ground comes these
[1:15:22] beings and Satan watches this serpent
[1:15:26] rise up. Now you watch, science has
[1:15:30] tried to find that serpent. They have
[1:15:32] broke everything down trying to find
[1:15:34] that missing link. They've they've got
[1:15:37] and all the great scientists of the
[1:15:39] world have tried to trace it back to a
[1:15:42] chimpanzeee. But brother Brandon would
[1:15:44] teach us that there was an affinity
[1:15:47] between her seed and his seed. He said
[1:15:51] there was a place where Satan could
[1:15:53] intermingle his seed. He said you'll
[1:15:56] notice he said in between he said in
[1:15:58] between that he said you take a thyroid
[1:16:00] cell of an animal. He said it'll go to a
[1:16:03] certain place. He said, "But it'll never
[1:16:05] reproduce a life of it again." He said,
[1:16:08] "Because God broke that pattern back
[1:16:11] there in the Garden of Eden." But Satan
[1:16:14] found a spot. He found a way into the
[1:16:18] field so that he could deposit his
[1:16:22] seed in this field so that he could not
[1:16:26] only just place his seed somewhere, but
[1:16:29] he could attack the field that God had
[1:16:32] created to be his field.
[1:16:36] You see, that's why Satan wants to get
[1:16:38] to you through denominational creed
[1:16:41] ideas.
[1:16:42] It's because Hallelujah. It's because if
[1:16:47] he can block your gene seed, if he can
[1:16:50] block the field and place ideologies and
[1:16:53] filters over top of you and interpret
[1:16:56] the word, he can block the visitation of
[1:17:00] Melzdc.
[1:17:03] Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. May I say this
[1:17:08] unto you, there's no way, there's no
[1:17:12] chance, there's no power that Satan can
[1:17:15] get to this field
[1:17:18] because God ordained you to life, to
[1:17:20] power, to truth.
[1:17:24] You watch as Adam and God begin to work
[1:17:28] in creation. They begin to work there
[1:17:30] together. And the very first thing, it
[1:17:33] begins to bring up a little flower out
[1:17:35] of the dust.
[1:17:37] and he begins to call it the lily. And
[1:17:40] then out of the same dust comes an
[1:17:43] animal. It's a it's a it's a dog. And
[1:17:46] then up out of there comes the eagle.
[1:17:49] Out of the same dust. And out of the
[1:17:51] dust comes the most perfect thing. The
[1:17:55] Bible said that he was made in the image
[1:17:58] of God. Brother Brandon will tell us
[1:18:00] that you could get no higher than that
[1:18:03] image because it was made in the image
[1:18:06] of God.
[1:18:08] Ain't that powerful? You can't get no
[1:18:11] higher than the image of God. And Satan
[1:18:14] is trying to come around and pervert it
[1:18:17] so that you think you're a cat and you
[1:18:20] think you're a dog and you think that
[1:18:22] you're a man when you're really a woman.
[1:18:25] What he's trying to do is break the
[1:18:27] sales down of what God ordained in the
[1:18:30] beginning. But God in this hour has
[1:18:33] brought about a prophet's message that
[1:18:35] has restored the truth of manhood and
[1:18:39] womanhood. Brother Brandham comes in the
[1:18:42] rapture. There it is. Brother Brandham
[1:18:43] comes in the rapture and he said when
[1:18:45] God deposited that germ seed, he said he
[1:18:49] didn't deposit part human life and then
[1:18:51] dog life and then woman life or cat
[1:18:54] life. He said what it was. He said it
[1:18:56] was all human life. He said so sail on
[1:19:00] top of sail on top of sail started
[1:19:02] building until it became a
[1:19:05] life. That's why this message has
[1:19:09] produced again not a part of a human,
[1:19:11] not a part of a cat, not a part of a
[1:19:14] dog, but what God deposited.
[1:19:19] Mercy be to Jesus.
[1:19:22] Satan knew. So, it's going to try to get
[1:19:25] to
[1:19:29] that
[1:19:31] man was created for
[1:19:34] God. Man was to be the temple of God.
[1:19:39] Man was to be a place of God's rest.
[1:19:44] Is that right? Man was to be the temple.
[1:19:48] You notice what Steven says in Acts 7
[1:19:49] and 46. who found favor before God, and
[1:19:53] desired to found a tabernacle, for the
[1:19:54] God of God, for the God of Jacob, but
[1:19:57] Solomon built him a
[1:19:59] house. How be it, the most high dwelleth
[1:20:02] not in temples, made with hands, saith
[1:20:04] the prophet. Heaven is my throne, and
[1:20:07] earth is my foottool. What house will
[1:20:09] you build me? Sayaith the Lord. Or what
[1:20:11] is a place of my rest? Hath not my hand
[1:20:15] made all these things? You stiff neck
[1:20:17] and you're stiff neck and uncircumcised
[1:20:20] in heart and ears. You do always resist
[1:20:22] the Holy Ghost as your fathers did. So
[1:20:25] do you. Satan has knowed that all along
[1:20:29] and he's wanted to indwell in man just
[1:20:31] like Adam or just like God even does. So
[1:20:36] I love what the prophet said. But God
[1:20:39] reserved that for himself.
[1:20:43] He said, "See, Satan wanted to create
[1:20:46] that for himself. He wanted to do that
[1:20:48] for himself. But Satan cannot do that.
[1:20:51] God alone a poor appeared in human
[1:20:53] flesh. Satan could not and cannot do
[1:20:56] that. He does not have creative powers.
[1:20:58] That's the only way for Satan to
[1:21:00] accomplish what he wanted to do was to
[1:21:02] enter into the serpent Eve. Even as he
[1:21:05] entered by evil spirits into the swine
[1:21:08] at Gdera, God does not enter animals.
[1:21:12] That's why you got to have a new birth.
[1:21:15] Because this first nature is beastly.
[1:21:17] That's why the prophet said, "A man
[1:21:19] without the Holy Ghost is a beast."
[1:21:22] God will not enter a beast. God will not
[1:21:26] enter an animal, but Satan can.
[1:21:32] You watch. If you're not born again, all
[1:21:34] of a sudden, you take on the nature of a
[1:21:36] devil.
[1:21:39] You watch devil possession. It come
[1:21:41] right in there. But you watch when God
[1:21:44] comes in. Your first nature was sticky.
[1:21:47] Your first nature was ugly. But when God
[1:21:49] breaks it, he now has built a place
[1:21:52] where he wants to come and he wants to
[1:21:55] feel.
[1:21:56] You see, Cain in the end, Cain bore the
[1:22:00] full spiritual characteristics of Satan
[1:22:03] and anim
[1:22:04] animalistic and the animalistic
[1:22:06] characteristics of the serpent.
[1:22:12] He found a place that he could deposit
[1:22:15] his seed and he could intermingle that
[1:22:17] seed. And then God said, "No more. Not
[1:22:21] happening. Not going to come this way no
[1:22:23] more. I'm not going to let Satan get
[1:22:24] that close." But I tell you what I'm
[1:22:26] going to do. You watch what Christ does
[1:22:28] at his ascension. He stands there and he
[1:22:31] preaches to them what he preached in
[1:22:32] Luke 24:49. That after me there's coming
[1:22:35] a comforter. That I'm going to send you
[1:22:37] a comforter. You watch what he does
[1:22:39] right there at his ascension. He said,
[1:22:41] "I'm going to tell you one thing." He
[1:22:43] said, "You go back down there at
[1:22:44] Jerusalem and you wait for power." He
[1:22:46] said, "Because look," he said, "John the
[1:22:48] Baptist baptized with water." He said,
[1:22:50] "But I'm going to baptize you with the
[1:22:51] Holy Ghost and fire and there's 500
[1:22:53] people that are standing there." God
[1:22:55] knew who was standing there. God knew
[1:22:57] who he was going to allow. Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] God knew who he was going to allow to
[1:23:01] stand real close to him and stand right
[1:23:03] there. God knew what field he was going
[1:23:05] to sew that in. And 380 of them could
[1:23:08] not make it up to the upper room because
[1:23:10] they did not have a deposit because they
[1:23:13] missed. But there was 120 that was
[1:23:16] willing to go all the way because a
[1:23:19] believer was in the womb of the earth
[1:23:21] and came up out of the ground just like
[1:23:24] the beast came up out of the ground. But
[1:23:26] the difference was what you accepted.
[1:23:34] You are also a womb for the spoken
[1:23:38] word. Watch
[1:23:40] this. It was just spoken at that time at
[1:23:44] his ascension, but it was a spoken
[1:23:47] word. But when it circled all the way
[1:23:50] around 10 days
[1:23:52] later and it got hooked on the inside of
[1:23:55] their
[1:23:57] womb, I'd say they got to singing that
[1:23:59] song. Something it got a hold of me. I
[1:24:05] said something got a hold of me. Well, I
[1:24:10] went to the upper
[1:24:13] room. Hallelujah. I went to the upper
[1:24:16] room and now there's no more gloom.
[1:24:20] Something. He got a hold of me.
[1:24:29] Something was spoken and then it became
[1:24:32] attached to the womb of their spirit.
[1:24:35] And now you begin to watch the bride
[1:24:37] coming of Christ. You begin to watch all
[1:24:40] of a sudden what was spoken just like it
[1:24:43] was over the virgin. Now it is in the
[1:24:47] womb of a virgin
[1:24:50] bride. Mary knows what it's like to get
[1:24:54] Jesus.
[1:24:56] on the inside of her womb. She's got a
[1:24:59] virgin womb. No man has handled
[1:25:01] it. But she's the only person to get
[1:25:04] Jesus twice. But this time, he wasn't
[1:25:06] leaving her
[1:25:07] body. This time, he was going to rest
[1:25:10] right there. You see, from the birth of
[1:25:13] the church on the day of Pentecost, the
[1:25:15] light began to strike that seed. The
[1:25:17] life of God began to manifest while he
[1:25:19] was there. From the day of Pentecost,
[1:25:21] the Holy Spirit started working through
[1:25:23] the church. miracle after miracle.
[1:25:25] Miracles of healings, miracles of
[1:25:28] deliverance, miracles of protection,
[1:25:30] miracles of judgment, miracles of
[1:25:33] provision, miracles of
[1:25:35] guidance. And God took pleasure in
[1:25:39] sewing his seed.
[1:25:43] You
[1:25:45] imagine, can you imagine how God
[1:25:50] felt? I'd say that God got a little
[1:25:52] smile on his face.
[1:25:55] realizing that he's getting ready to sew
[1:25:56] Peter into the
[1:25:58] ground. I'd say he got a little smile on
[1:26:01] his face and he's getting ready to throw
[1:26:02] Saul out there. And Satan's like, "Man,
[1:26:07] I got these boys for sure. I'm going to
[1:26:09] make him a cussing
[1:26:11] preacher. I'm going to make him get so
[1:26:13] close to Jesus." He said, "But I'm going
[1:26:15] to allow him to still have his first
[1:26:16] nature that he'll cut off the high
[1:26:19] priest solders's ear." I can imagine as
[1:26:22] Satan begins to smile at this old guy as
[1:26:25] he's be to sew and there goes Saul out
[1:26:28] and I say, "God's just
[1:26:29] smiling." You have no idea what I'm
[1:26:33] sewing.
[1:26:35] You have no idea what I'm getting ready
[1:26:37] to do. I'mma turn a cussing preacher
[1:26:39] into one of the greatest 15-minute
[1:26:41] preachers that you ever seen.
[1:26:44] You watch when Peter starts preaching.
[1:26:46] He only preaches 15 minutes, but I tell
[1:26:49] you, 3,000 souls were saved.
[1:26:53] You watch, he takes a man, you know,
[1:26:55] God's smiling when he takes a murderer
[1:26:57] and takes him into the first church age
[1:27:00] messenger. You know, God's got a smile,
[1:27:02] a sense of humor. When he takes a man
[1:27:05] that that a man that comes out of the
[1:27:07] heels of Kentucky that's got a bad name,
[1:27:11] but he sews him in the right spot, in
[1:27:14] the right season,
[1:27:16] What I'm trying to say to you, what Paul
[1:27:19] was made out of, Peter was made out of.
[1:27:21] What William Brandon was made out of,
[1:27:23] Paul was made out of. What you are made
[1:27:26] out of is the same thing that Paul and
[1:27:28] William Brandon was made out of. But
[1:27:30] what makes the
[1:27:33] difference? Jacob was made out of the
[1:27:35] same material that Esau was made out of.
[1:27:39] Judas was made out of the same material
[1:27:41] that Jesus was made out of. But what
[1:27:44] made the difference was the seed that
[1:27:46] had been sown. You are made out of the
[1:27:49] same material that the church is made
[1:27:51] out of.
[1:27:58] But what makes the difference? What
[1:28:01] makes the difference is what God has
[1:28:03] swn. Satan cannot stop what God has
[1:28:07] sown. He couldn't stop miracles. He
[1:28:10] couldn't stop healings. He could not
[1:28:12] stop discernments. He could not stop
[1:28:15] power. I say you never will and you
[1:28:18] never can. So you might as well give up,
[1:28:21] [Applause]
[1:28:23] devil. I'd say God still got a smile on
[1:28:26] his face. When I sold Shannon into this
[1:28:28] field, I knew that he'd be a son of God.
[1:28:30] When I sold India into this field, I
[1:28:32] knew she'd be a daughter of God.
[1:28:36] The rest of the world rejected it,
[1:28:38] Brother Doug. But God knew what he
[1:28:40] deposited.
[1:28:44] Hallelujah.
[1:28:46] Hallelujah.
[1:28:50] Hallelujah. Maybe maybe I should just
[1:28:53] say it like this. Do you realize the
[1:28:56] honor that has been bestowed on you?
[1:29:02] I want you I want you to be I want you
[1:29:04] to be real real with
[1:29:06] yourself. Come on now. I'd say if you
[1:29:09] realize this, you'll walk in church
[1:29:10] different.
[1:29:12] You'll pray different. You'll worship
[1:29:15] different. You'll act different. You'll
[1:29:18] talk different. I'd say you'll come into
[1:29:21] church and you'll be concerned about one
[1:29:23] thing.
[1:29:25] This word. You will not be concerned
[1:29:28] what your neighbor did. You will not be
[1:29:31] concerned of how bad a week you had. You
[1:29:34] will not be concerned of how good a week
[1:29:36] you had. You will not be concerned how
[1:29:38] sick you are. It's time that you realize
[1:29:42] the power of this positive gospel. God
[1:29:46] put you here to have a positive
[1:29:49] attitude.
[1:29:52] That means staying in the word, staying
[1:29:55] in the message, staying in the truth.
[1:30:00] If you could recognize this honor that
[1:30:03] has been bestowed on
[1:30:07] you that you are the
[1:30:09] womb where the son of man comes
[1:30:15] to. Mary
[1:30:18] walked
[1:30:20] differently than the rest of the
[1:30:23] girls before the angel got to her.
[1:30:29] Come on now. You know when your life all
[1:30:32] the way through your life that there's
[1:30:34] been something different about you.
[1:30:38] People longed for things that you didn't
[1:30:42] long for. People longed and wanted
[1:30:45] things that you never wanted. But there
[1:30:48] was something on the inside of you that
[1:30:50] could not be satisfied with the things
[1:30:52] of Learosa. They could not be satisfied.
[1:30:55] Mary could not be satisfied with just
[1:30:58] being the wife of Joseph, but there was
[1:31:00] something longing on the inside of her.
[1:31:02] She said, "I don't know what it is, but
[1:31:04] there's something special. I feel like
[1:31:06] there's something special about me. I
[1:31:08] believe there's something I believe
[1:31:09] God's going to do something particular
[1:31:11] in my day. I believe that God's going to
[1:31:13] do something special through me. I
[1:31:15] believe that God's going to let me be
[1:31:17] his habitation. I believe that there all
[1:31:19] the days of your life, whether you could
[1:31:22] explain it or not, some of you grew up
[1:31:25] in a bad
[1:31:29] home. Some of you grew up in a place
[1:31:33] where God was not welcome.
[1:31:38] But something on the inside of
[1:31:43] you to manifest that spoken word to
[1:31:49] manifest what God had intended for
[1:31:53] you. Sister Gabriel, I had you on my
[1:31:56] mind when I was reading over this quote.
[1:31:58] He said, "Now we can preach the word."
[1:32:00] He said, "We can explain the word, but
[1:32:02] you got to receive the word." He said,
[1:32:04] "Oh, hallelujah. That's what sets it a
[1:32:06] fire, brother. When you receive it, the
[1:32:09] revelation, he said, something slips out
[1:32:11] of the unseen world yonder and comes
[1:32:13] rolling down through a mystical channel
[1:32:16] somewhere into your soul that says, "Now
[1:32:18] I see it." Your eyes begin to brighten.
[1:32:21] Your lip that's hung down begins to
[1:32:23] straighten up in a smile. Every muscle
[1:32:25] in your body seems to rejoice. Every
[1:32:28] muscle in your body seems to rejoice.
[1:32:31] Something's going to happen. Something.
[1:32:33] You don't need to be in a prayer line.
[1:32:35] Then you got it.
[1:32:38] You are predestinated to receive this
[1:32:40] seed. You are in a position. If you're
[1:32:44] in a position, that means you're on the
[1:32:46] ground.
[1:32:48] Before God can pick you up, God's got to
[1:32:51] get you on the ground.
[1:32:54] And some of you was in the worst of
[1:32:57] conditions. Some of you was in a
[1:32:59] terrible spot, terrible families. But
[1:33:02] God had somebody. God had some dirt. God
[1:33:06] had some dirt. God had some dirt that he
[1:33:10] was going to deposit this seed in.
[1:33:13] You didn't look like Jesus. You didn't
[1:33:15] talk like Jesus. You didn't walk like
[1:33:17] Jesus. But this is the only kind that
[1:33:20] the word can bring forth.
[1:33:29] Let me say this church. I am fighting
[1:33:31] for a reason. I'm fighting for a
[1:33:34] reason. I feel the attack of the enemy
[1:33:37] in this
[1:33:38] room. I feel the attack of it. But let
[1:33:40] me say this to you. His attack will be
[1:33:43] thwarted. His power will be stopped.
[1:33:48] His rumors will be denied. His lies will
[1:33:52] be shut down.
[1:33:54] Brothers, there's something wrong here.
[1:33:56] Let me say this. The attack on the field
[1:34:00] will never stop the seed.
[1:34:04] Mercy be to Jesus. You are
[1:34:07] predestinated. I know hell hates this,
[1:34:10] but you was
[1:34:11] predestinated to receive this seat. But
[1:34:14] before you could receive it, you got to
[1:34:16] get in the spirit of receiving.
[1:34:21] Let me say this. Your time for rapture
[1:34:23] is at hand. Your time for deliverance is
[1:34:27] at hand. The time to fulfill what God
[1:34:30] has deposited is at hand. It's a time to
[1:34:32] move forward. It's a time to press a
[1:34:34] battle. It's a time to be quickened.
[1:34:41] And you are anointed to attack the enemy
[1:34:44] who has attacked you.
[1:34:51] There's been no other age that the
[1:34:54] pillar of fire has made its
[1:34:55] return by this
[1:34:59] hour. But when the light gets shown on
[1:35:02] the
[1:35:05] seed,
[1:35:07] my I tell you what, something's coming
[1:35:10] to life tonight.
[1:35:12] The pillar of fire has made its return.
[1:35:16] And I welcome that pillar of fire in
[1:35:18] this room. I welcome the message of the
[1:35:20] hour in this room. I welcome the son of
[1:35:23] man in this room. I welcome the
[1:35:25] anointing of the mighty angel into this
[1:35:28] room to throw back everything that
[1:35:30] Satan's tried to put against the church
[1:35:32] of the living God. Could you imagine as
[1:35:35] the circle, as the camp of Israel is
[1:35:37] going around and there's nothing but a
[1:35:39] bunch of rumors that are going around,
[1:35:41] there's nothing but a bunch of lies that
[1:35:43] are going around and saying that God's
[1:35:44] dead. That God does not have power no
[1:35:47] more. He's no longer God on the
[1:35:48] mountain. He's no longer God in the
[1:35:50] valley no more. But all of a sudden, the
[1:35:52] pillar of fire has circled the camp.
[1:35:55] It's went around the camp and it looked
[1:35:57] over Saul and he wouldn't produce it. It
[1:35:59] looked over David's brothers and they
[1:36:01] wouldn't produce it. But finally the
[1:36:03] pillar of fire found to David that he
[1:36:06] could anchor his word in and David
[1:36:08] wasn't going to reject it. Can you
[1:36:10] imagine how the pillar of fire danced
[1:36:13] before the Lord when he found David when
[1:36:17] Goliath was there and he was shouting
[1:36:19] and he was screaming, "Let your God be
[1:36:22] our God. Get out here and serve us."
[1:36:28] And Israel is getting ready to throw the
[1:36:29] white flag of defeat. They're getting
[1:36:32] ready to surrender. But all of a sudden,
[1:36:33] the pillar of fire founds the right one.
[1:36:38] That pillar of fire has worked through
[1:36:40] Leosa.
[1:36:43] Mercy. It's worked through Leosa and it
[1:36:46] found a Melvin and it found a Jonathan.
[1:36:49] And it found a Katie.
[1:36:56] Lord Jesus.
[1:37:00] Can you imagine how the pillar of fire
[1:37:03] felt when it watched Shamear as it went
[1:37:06] through attack after attack year after
[1:37:08] year? Constant abuse but one
[1:37:13] moment. How many needs a moment like
[1:37:16] that? One moment. One time in his
[1:37:20] presence changed Shamgar.
[1:37:26] [Applause]
[1:37:29] Shamgard didn't have to raise his
[1:37:32] voice. Shamgard didn't have to scream.
[1:37:35] But all of a sudden, a revelation struck
[1:37:37] him. I am who I am because the I am
[1:37:41] tells me who I
[1:37:43] am. I am who I am because the I am tells
[1:37:49] me who I am. Shame was saying, I'm not
[1:37:52] this way because my daddy made me this
[1:37:54] way. He was not saying, "I am this way
[1:37:57] because my granddaddy made me this way."
[1:37:59] He said, "But I am the I am's child, and
[1:38:02] I'm under the same covenant that
[1:38:04] Abraham's under."
[1:38:08] Bring your attack here one more time,
[1:38:10] devil. Bring your attack here one more
[1:38:12] time, and I'll get my ox go out and I'll
[1:38:15] whoop you from kingdom
[1:38:17] come. You attack my family one more
[1:38:19] time. You attack my family one more
[1:38:22] time. You attack my children one more
[1:38:25] time. Is these things
[1:38:29] on? Is anybody understanding what I'm
[1:38:32] [Applause]
[1:38:34] saying? Is that Shamgar had enough?
[1:38:39] In harvest time.
[1:38:44] In harvest time, he recognized who he
[1:38:47] was out of the same ground as the
[1:38:50] Philistines were made out of. But the
[1:38:53] power, there it is. But the power,
[1:38:56] what made the difference between Shamgar
[1:38:58] and the Philistines is what God
[1:39:00] deposited.
[1:39:05] If y'all could see what I'm seeing right
[1:39:06] now, if y'all can see what I'm seeing,
[1:39:09] you're getting ready to lose Satan.
[1:39:15] I see
[1:39:17] it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I'm
[1:39:22] saying that God has taken over your
[1:39:24] battle. God has taken over your situ.
[1:39:27] Elijah, you go lay on that dead boy's
[1:39:30] body and he'll get
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:35] up. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:39:38] Come on. Throw that soldier on them dead
[1:39:41] bones and he'll get up.
[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:39:51] You let that quickening power hit you
[1:39:53] one time. The quickening power doesn't
[1:39:55] make you what you are. It just shows
[1:39:57] what's there.
[1:39:59] The dynamics on the mechanics shows
[1:40:02] exactly what it is.
[1:40:07] That power that came on
[1:40:09] Shamgar, it didn't make him
[1:40:12] Shamgar. He was already Shamgar,
[1:40:16] but he recognized who he was in the
[1:40:19] presence of the
[1:40:21] Lord. Come on. The anointing that struck
[1:40:25] David did not make him
[1:40:28] David. You did not become seed by the
[1:40:31] rebirth. You were seed. Therefore, you
[1:40:35] can't be reborn. Come on, somebody. This
[1:40:39] message knew who it could call to, who
[1:40:42] could it could brood over, who it could
[1:40:44] make love to. And finally, when it found
[1:40:47] the spot,
[1:40:50] Hallelujah. That seed's got to land in
[1:40:54] the field of a believer. And when it
[1:40:56] landed on the inside of this bride, he
[1:40:58] found a place that would hold his
[1:41:00] covenant. And it's unconditional.
[1:41:05] That means you ain't got to dance for
[1:41:07] it. You ain't got to shout for it. You
[1:41:11] ain't got to give arms to the poor for
[1:41:12] it.
[1:41:15] Now I feel like a preacher.
[1:41:17] You ain't got to work for it. You ain't
[1:41:20] got to go down and feed soup down here
[1:41:22] to some hall to make you feel like a
[1:41:24] Christian. You ain't got to go down here
[1:41:26] and give the shirt off of your back to
[1:41:28] make you a Christian. What makes you a
[1:41:31] Christian is what God put on the inside
[1:41:33] of you. Let the world do what they're
[1:41:35] going to
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:39] do. Well, we're we're serving soup and
[1:41:42] we're having apple pie butter sales.
[1:41:44] We're having all these sales so that we
[1:41:46] can progress the kingdom of God. I say
[1:41:49] it's a lie.
[1:41:51] If you'll pay your tithe, you won't have
[1:41:53] to have an apple butter sale. You won't
[1:41:56] have to have a barbecue.
[1:42:00] Matter of fact, if you don't want to
[1:42:02] even give your tithe, my father owns a
[1:42:05] cattle on a thousand heels.
[1:42:09] And if you don't want to give your 10%,
[1:42:11] God will raise up somebody that'll
[1:42:13] outgive
[1:42:14] [Applause]
[1:42:16] you. Oh, I'm saying this to you. You
[1:42:20] ain't got to work it up and you ain't
[1:42:22] got to work it down. You ain't got to
[1:42:24] shout it up and you ain't got to shout
[1:42:26] it down. You ain't got to dance it up
[1:42:28] and you ain't got to dance it down. What
[1:42:30] God did for you is for you.
[1:42:36] Lord have mercy. That means get over
[1:42:39] yourself.
[1:42:41] Your mistakes will not make you a seed
[1:42:44] of God, but the seed of God on the
[1:42:47] inside of you will raise you past your
[1:42:49] mistakes.
[1:42:52] [Applause]
[1:42:55] Adam fell and he was still God's seed.
[1:42:58] David fell and he was still God's seed.
[1:43:01] Micah let him down and he was still
[1:43:04] God's seed. Isaiah let him down and he
[1:43:06] was still
[1:43:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If I could, I'd
[1:43:11] just have myself a speaking in tongues
[1:43:12] service right now. Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Your mistakes
[1:43:19] don't own you,
[1:43:21] but the
[1:43:23] seed, the power, the anointing, the mind
[1:43:26] of Christ.
[1:43:33] He said,
[1:43:34] "I will
[1:43:36] establish my
[1:43:38] covenant with you,
[1:43:40] Abraham, between
[1:43:42] me and thy
[1:43:45] seed and thy seed after thee in their
[1:43:48] generations for an everlasting covenant
[1:43:52] to be God unto thee and to thy
[1:43:56] seed after thee."
[1:43:58] Brother Brandon said, "What is the seed
[1:44:00] of Abraham?" Now, not his flesh. Paul
[1:44:04] said, "Jew, that Jew outward is not Jew,
[1:44:07] but it's the Jew
[1:44:09] inwardly." What is the seed of
[1:44:11] Abraham? Those that believe the whole
[1:44:17] word of God.
[1:44:22] I will establish my covenant with you. I
[1:44:27] predestinated this covenant with thee
[1:44:29] and with thy seed and in each generation
[1:44:31] after thee that will believe
[1:44:35] it. Just believe it. What are you
[1:44:38] saying, brother Hendrew? I'm saying it
[1:44:40] like in the words of Peter upon all
[1:44:43] flesh. As even as many as the Lord our
[1:44:48] God shall call.
[1:44:54] I'm I'm I'm coming to a
[1:44:56] spot that I plan on rocking the socks
[1:45:00] off of Satan.
[1:45:04] He battled me for this spot and I'm
[1:45:07] here.
[1:45:10] You
[1:45:11] know, you know, it was told to my mama
[1:45:14] when I was a little bitty baby that
[1:45:17] there was going to be something mentally
[1:45:18] wrong with me. And Katie said, "That's a
[1:45:25] truth." They told her there was
[1:45:27] something wrong. They told her something
[1:45:30] he's not forming right. And they started
[1:45:33] whispering ideas about so-called
[1:45:36] abortion in that
[1:45:38] day. Saying things like, you know, he
[1:45:40] probably not going to make it. Things
[1:45:42] aren't going to be right. His heart's
[1:45:43] not forming right. They told me I had a
[1:45:44] heart murmur and all those things.
[1:45:47] If I did have a mind that was messed up,
[1:45:49] God restored it. And I used to have a
[1:45:51] heart murmur and then God restored it.
[1:45:56] I'm glad my mama didn't decide to give
[1:45:59] me up.
[1:46:02] I'm really glad that she didn't listen
[1:46:04] to the
[1:46:09] doctors. I may not have that exactly
[1:46:12] right because I know that something is
[1:46:14] wrong up top.
[1:46:18] I am a
[1:46:19] fool. A fool for Christ.
[1:46:23] There is something wrong with me. But
[1:46:26] leave me alone. I enjoy the way I am.
[1:46:38] Me and brother William was
[1:46:39] fellowshipping back a few weeks ago and
[1:46:41] we was fellowshipping on this
[1:46:43] alt that at the spot of
[1:46:47] conception I was in was that place in
[1:46:50] Kentucky we was at that
[1:46:51] museum the creation museum and they got
[1:46:54] this whole uh a whole section about the
[1:46:58] birth of a child and in there but me and
[1:47:01] brother William started fellowship. This
[1:47:02] is where it come to my mind. We was
[1:47:05] talking about that at
[1:47:07] conception that at conception there is a
[1:47:11] light that happens at conception. When
[1:47:15] the egg and the sperm connect together,
[1:47:18] there's a light that goes off. Now,
[1:47:20] science, me and Katie was listening to
[1:47:22] this scientist as he was talking to this
[1:47:24] this past week and he was talking. He
[1:47:26] said, "Now what we do, we use chemicals
[1:47:28] to be able to see that light as it comes
[1:47:31] as as that seed is sewn and it it
[1:47:33] conceives, the light comes on." Now, I
[1:47:36] don't know about using no chemicals, but
[1:47:39] I do know about using revelation.
[1:47:42] That when revelation strikes a seed,
[1:47:44] that a light transfers. Now you know
[1:47:47] brothers good and well that there's a
[1:47:49] time in a certain season in the natural
[1:47:52] that you have a time to sew your seed.
[1:47:54] Is that right? There's a time when you
[1:47:56] have a chance to sew your seed. And when
[1:47:58] it gets past that season, it's past its
[1:48:02] spot. You can sew the seed, but it'll
[1:48:04] never come to life. That's why you
[1:48:07] Abraham could keep sewing in Sarah's
[1:48:10] field and it would never reproduce
[1:48:12] anything because there there was a
[1:48:15] deadness on that field. So God said, "I
[1:48:19] will restore. I will literally bring her
[1:48:22] back to her first state so that she's
[1:48:26] able to conceive." Matter of fact, he
[1:48:29] did it even better than her first spot
[1:48:32] because in her first self, she could
[1:48:34] never produce the son of man. In your
[1:48:37] first nature, you can never be the bride
[1:48:39] of Jesus Christ. So, he birthed you
[1:48:42] again. And light transformed at the
[1:48:45] conception of the revelation of who
[1:48:48] Jesus was.
[1:48:51] And
[1:48:52] light hit light and it come to life.
[1:48:58] Blessed be the name of the Lord. A lot
[1:49:02] at conception.
[1:49:04] Now you know what I'm talking
[1:49:06] about. You that were raised
[1:49:10] trinitarians and all of a sudden you
[1:49:13] come under some anointed preaching and
[1:49:16] all of a sudden it begin to breathe over
[1:49:18] you. It begin to breathe over you.
[1:49:20] There's only one God and his name is
[1:49:23] Jesus Christ. It didn't look like it on
[1:49:26] the outside, but on the inside there was
[1:49:29] a light
[1:49:30] and the light transferred and it was a
[1:49:34] conception there.
[1:49:36] Brother Brandham said
[1:49:38] this. And who is this Melzdc? Here we
[1:49:42] are formed to the word image to be a
[1:49:45] partaker of the word by being
[1:49:47] predestinated since the beginning. You
[1:49:49] see that little spark of life that you
[1:49:52] had from the beginning when you started
[1:49:54] your journey. Many of you can remember
[1:49:56] it. You joined this church and you
[1:49:58] joined that church. You tried this and
[1:50:00] you tried that and nothing satisfied
[1:50:02] you. But one day
[1:50:07] that spark of life come over you and you
[1:50:10] recognized it.
[1:50:13] Brother Brandham said about
[1:50:15] Zakius, that little we little
[1:50:20] man. He said there was a woman back
[1:50:22] there that heard about Jesus. He said
[1:50:25] she was praying over Zakius, praying
[1:50:27] that God would do something for him. She
[1:50:30] had recognized him as a son of man. She
[1:50:33] had recognized that that was a son of
[1:50:36] God. Brother Brandon said that Zakius
[1:50:38] was a rich man.
[1:50:40] He said he was a kind of man that golfed
[1:50:43] with the pastor on Sundays. He was a
[1:50:46] good guy. He was rich. He said he was
[1:50:49] honorable. He said, "But he just didn't
[1:50:52] have
[1:50:53] it." Kind of like a lot of you when you
[1:50:56] first
[1:50:57] were. But Rebecca got to praying.
[1:51:02] God, you see my husband, he ain't came
[1:51:06] to this light yet. He ain't come to this
[1:51:09] truth yet, but God, I pray you choose
[1:51:13] something. She said, "All," Brother
[1:51:15] Brandham said, "I see him." He said, "I
[1:51:17] see him." And there's Zakius. Said, "All
[1:51:19] of a sudden, he can't sleep at night. He
[1:51:21] begins to get restless rolling over
[1:51:23] there, and he said something woke up on
[1:51:25] the inside of Rebecca. And Rebecca begin
[1:51:27] to recognize that God was dealing with
[1:51:30] Zakius."
[1:51:31] Hallelujah.
[1:51:33] Hallelujah. He had done everything he
[1:51:35] could. But when her prayers started
[1:51:38] breaking into a realm, I say mothers
[1:51:41] keep on praying. Mas keep on praying.
[1:51:44] Daddies keep on
[1:51:46] praying. That Zakius is waring with
[1:51:51] himself. So Zakius wakes up. You know
[1:51:55] what? Today I put the rumors aside. I'm
[1:51:58] going to find out if this William
[1:52:00] Brandham's a truth or not. I'm going to
[1:52:02] find out if this message is right or
[1:52:04] not. So, I'm going to get I'm going to
[1:52:07] get to a spot and I'm not going to miss
[1:52:10] nothing. So, Brother Man said, here he
[1:52:13] was.
[1:52:15] Oh, all dressed up and fine and nice.
[1:52:18] You know, he come in his Easter
[1:52:21] best. He couldn't see cuz he's so short.
[1:52:24] Must have been kin to our
[1:52:27] pastor. And he could see the crowd are
[1:52:30] coming. So he said, "You know what?
[1:52:32] There's a trash can right there." And he
[1:52:34] brings a trash can over. And he steps up
[1:52:37] on the trash can to get a little better
[1:52:38] look. And all of a sudden, he falls in
[1:52:40] at the prophet's head. And here he is
[1:52:42] all dressed up. He's got all that
[1:52:43] rubbish and that trash all over
[1:52:45] him. And he climbs up on top this little
[1:52:49] tree just to see. Brother Brandham said
[1:52:53] it like this. He said, ' If there is a
[1:52:55] spark of life in you, he said he'll put
[1:52:57] something in your path to make it come
[1:53:00] to life.
[1:53:02] Let me say this. You might have to climb
[1:53:05] up a tree to see him. You might have to
[1:53:07] get on a garbage can to see him. But I
[1:53:09] say it's worth it. You may not realize
[1:53:12] what your prayers are doing. But I say
[1:53:14] it'll make your prodals climb upon a
[1:53:17] trash can to find Jesus.
[1:53:22] And all of a
[1:53:24] sudden, here he
[1:53:28] comes. Is this message
[1:53:31] right? Is what he said the
[1:53:34] truth is? Is really what he he spoke
[1:53:37] over Georgie Carter? Is that the true?
[1:53:40] Really? Is is what he did down there
[1:53:44] with the blind man. Is it really true?
[1:53:45] Is it really true what happened with
[1:53:47] Hattie's sons?
[1:53:48] Is it really true that there are
[1:53:50] squirrels that was created? Is it is it
[1:53:52] really
[1:53:55] true and you had the
[1:53:59] questions and God said,
[1:54:03] "Zakius, get
[1:54:06] down. Get down off your pride for a
[1:54:09] minute. Get down off that tree.
[1:54:12] You don't have to climb up somewhere
[1:54:14] high to see me, but I'm going to come
[1:54:16] right there where you live at and I'm
[1:54:19] going to make sure that that word that I
[1:54:21] sold will come to life.
[1:54:25] Brother man, brother Brandon was talking
[1:54:27] about the woman at the well. He said
[1:54:29] that she had been with every kind of man
[1:54:32] said, "But there's something different
[1:54:34] about her. She was always looking for
[1:54:36] the Messiah."
[1:54:38] He said, "But when that light struck
[1:54:40] that seed," because she had
[1:54:43] representation by predestination. He
[1:54:46] said, "When the light struck the seed,
[1:54:48] she recognized that that was everything
[1:54:51] that she was looking for." I say this,
[1:54:54] brother, she was walking in the light.
[1:54:58] Jesus said in John 12:35, "Yet a little
[1:55:02] while is a light with you. Walk while
[1:55:04] you have the light, lest darkness come
[1:55:07] upon you. For he that walketh in
[1:55:09] darkness, knoweth not whether he goeth.
[1:55:12] Paul said in Ephesians 5:8, "For you
[1:55:15] were sometimes darkness, but now are you
[1:55:17] the light in the Lord. Walk as children
[1:55:21] of light." John said in 1 John 1:7, "But
[1:55:25] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:55:28] light, then we have fellowship with one
[1:55:31] another." Amen. What are you saying? I'm
[1:55:35] saying where you're
[1:55:37] walking is light.
[1:55:40] You know, I always wondered I always
[1:55:43] wondered how did John realize that was
[1:55:46] the lamb of
[1:55:49] God? That's his cousin, but how did he
[1:55:52] realized
[1:55:55] it? That's his flesh, but how did he
[1:55:58] recognize it? Now, I always wonder that.
[1:56:02] How did he
[1:56:03] know? How did he know that it wasn't
[1:56:06] just his cousin?
[1:56:09] Just like, how did you know it wasn't
[1:56:11] Homer Fraser that prophesied over you?
[1:56:14] How did you know it wasn't just Brother
[1:56:15] Ron that prophesied over you? When
[1:56:18] that's your own kin in your
[1:56:20] flesh? I wondered about that. And then I
[1:56:23] got to reading one day where brother
[1:56:26] Brandon said that John the Baptist was
[1:56:27] watching and he was out there in the
[1:56:29] Jordan. He was
[1:56:31] baptizing. He said, "All of a sudden,"
[1:56:34] he said, "Here comes Jesus walking down
[1:56:35] through there." He said, "How we
[1:56:37] recognized it was by the light."
[1:56:41] How we recognize it was by the light.
[1:56:44] How do I know that you're children of
[1:56:45] the light? Look at this dark world. But
[1:56:48] there's a light.
[1:56:52] There's a light.
[1:56:54] How do you know? Come on, somebody. in
[1:56:57] 1933 on the Ohio River. It was more than
[1:57:01] a man that was standing there. But there
[1:57:04] was a
[1:57:05] lot that said John the Baptist for the
[1:57:08] first coming of Christ. So were your
[1:57:11] message, Joe. It's going to mean
[1:57:13] something to you. Hallelujah. It was
[1:57:16] that voice that could scream out with a
[1:57:19] light flickering and said, "House of
[1:57:21] hell, give way in the name of Jesus
[1:57:25] Christ.
[1:57:26] How do I know who you who you are? By
[1:57:29] the light.
[1:57:43] Bless be the name of the
[1:57:49] Lord. Brother Random taps into it and
[1:57:52] I'm I'm coming to a close but I have
[1:57:54] battled here and here we are. When
[1:57:57] brother Random goes into Revelation
[1:57:59] chapter 4 and he dives so heavily in
[1:58:03] this, if you can catch what brother
[1:58:05] William spoke last
[1:58:08] Saturday, he recognized this that when
[1:58:12] John breaks into Revelation chapter 4
[1:58:16] and he starts seeing the veil, the glory
[1:58:18] behind the veil, brother Brandham said
[1:58:21] in the Revelation series, he said, "Here
[1:58:23] comes now to the revelator in yellowish
[1:58:27] green. He comes to us in yellow is
[1:58:29] green. The light. Walk in the light. He
[1:58:34] is the light. What did this message say
[1:58:37] to you? And I saw another mighty angel
[1:58:41] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:58:44] rainbow upon his head. And his feet was
[1:58:46] as it were the sun. and his feet and his
[1:58:50] feet and his feet and his feet and his
[1:58:56] body. Come on, somebody. The head is
[1:58:58] here. We're his body and his feet.
[1:59:04] Somebody look at your neighbor, say,
[1:59:06] "And his feet and his feet were his
[1:59:09] pillars of fire."
[1:59:12] He came unto us in yellowish, greenest,
[1:59:16] amber light.
[1:59:17] So walk in the light and his feet were
[1:59:22] as pillars of fire. What are you saying?
[1:59:25] I'm saying you're the anointed body
[1:59:28] bride of Jesus Christ. So put the devil
[1:59:33] under your feet.
[1:59:36] Walk in the light as he is in the light.
[1:59:44] when there was two on the road to Emmas
[1:59:46] and on their road they went back just as
[1:59:49] hard as they could go lightfooted just
[1:59:52] shouting the victory to tell them the
[1:59:54] Lord has raised indeed notice again he
[1:59:57] said they were lightfooted he said I
[2:00:00] remember when the Lord forgive
[2:00:02] me he said I felt like a million pounds
[2:00:05] went off my back and I never even
[2:00:07] touched the step going towards a house I
[2:00:09] didn't know nothing about shouting he
[2:00:11] said I wish I could have one of them
[2:00:12] experiences right now. He said, "I'd
[2:00:14] make up for that time." He said, "I know
[2:00:16] that something had happened." I went in
[2:00:19] and grabbed my song book. My mother
[2:00:20] said, "What's the matter?" I said, "I
[2:00:22] don't know." I grabbed my Bible. I
[2:00:25] couldn't read it. He said, "I was too
[2:00:26] nervous and happy." She said, "Well,
[2:00:28] what's the matter?" I said, "I don't
[2:00:30] know." I slipped out the door and went
[2:00:33] down. He said, "There's a great big
[2:00:35] railroad track behind our place, and I
[2:00:37] run down the railroad track." He said,
[2:00:39] "I jumped in the hair. Jumped in the air
[2:00:41] just as hard as I could, trying to give
[2:00:43] vent to the feeling." He said, "What a
[2:00:45] time."
[2:00:49] That's for every man tonight and woman
[2:00:52] who's never experienced Christ Jesus,
[2:00:54] the freedom of forgiven sin, walking
[2:00:57] lightfooted. Hallelujah. Don't get
[2:00:59] scared. Hallelujah. It means praise our
[2:01:02] God. You know he's worthy of our praises
[2:01:05] that you can give him. Notice, walk in
[2:01:09] lightfooted. Walk in the light as he is
[2:01:14] the light. Again, he said you come
[2:01:18] because you love him. And I'm trusting
[2:01:21] that God will send you away, not empty.
[2:01:24] He never sends anyone empty who comes to
[2:01:26] him. He will send you away with a full
[2:01:30] heart of joy. Lightfooted.
[2:01:34] Lightfooted. going down the street
[2:01:37] rejoicing and praising God as you move
[2:01:40] along.
[2:01:43] What are you talking about, Brother
[2:01:44] Andrew? I'm saying it's time you put
[2:01:47] some light under your feet.
[2:01:52] I'm saying it's time you put some light
[2:01:53] under your feet.
[2:01:56] I'm saying it like Paul said it. And you
[2:01:59] have his shaw with a foot with the
[2:02:03] preparation of the gospel of Jesus
[2:02:05] Christ. And you study out their soldiers
[2:02:09] shoes is powerful. Musicians can
[2:02:14] come. Their
[2:02:15] shoes had spikes and they had greaves
[2:02:19] all the way going up their ankle. And
[2:02:23] there was great big metal grieavves
[2:02:25] spears that were coming out. And not
[2:02:28] only was they on the top of their
[2:02:30] feet, but they was on the bottom of
[2:02:33] their shoe.
[2:02:40] So when they was standing in battle,
[2:02:42] when you read Ephesians 6, and when
[2:02:44] they're standing there in
[2:02:47] battle, they've got their spears on the
[2:02:51] bottom of their
[2:02:52] shoes where they can't go backwards.
[2:02:56] That'll make you be able to withstand
[2:02:57] the attack of the enemy.
[2:03:00] It is said in
[2:03:02] history that just a few seconds of
[2:03:06] stomping on your fallen enemy will put
[2:03:10] him to death.
[2:03:14] Just one swift
[2:03:17] kick will kill the enemy.
[2:03:21] I say it's time to put on your shoes.
[2:03:28] I say it's time to put on your shoes.
[2:03:32] I say it's time to put on your dancing
[2:03:36] shoes. You remember that little story I
[2:03:38] told you one time about them animals
[2:03:42] that was playing football.
[2:03:45] Remember had that there's two teams. One
[2:03:48] had the elephant, one had the rhino.
[2:03:50] Other side was the giraffe and the
[2:03:52] tiger. and the
[2:03:55] elephant and his team, they're winning
[2:03:58] and they're running and they're just
[2:04:00] beating this other team, the Tiger and
[2:04:02] their team. They're beating them to
[2:04:04] death. Beating them to death. The score
[2:04:07] is 52 to nothing at
[2:04:09] halftime. About halftime, they come back
[2:04:12] out and all of a sudden, here comes a
[2:04:15] touchdown from the Tigers team. Here
[2:04:17] comes the touchdown and the Elephants
[2:04:20] team never scored one more time.
[2:04:23] never scored one more
[2:04:25] time. That Tiger, his line, his team,
[2:04:28] they kept on running. Here come a
[2:04:29] touchdown. Here come a touchdown. Here
[2:04:31] come a touchdown. And the line and a
[2:04:33] Tiger, they called a timeout. Said,
[2:04:35] "What in the world is going on?" And
[2:04:38] here come a little bitty old centipede
[2:04:41] come rolling into the into the
[2:04:45] huddle. Said,
[2:04:47] "Where were you at the first half?" That
[2:04:52] little centipede was whooping the
[2:04:54] elephant and all of his team upside and
[2:04:56] down. He said, "Where was you at in the
[2:04:58] first half?" He said, "Sorry, coach. I
[2:05:00] was putting my shoes
[2:05:03] on. It took me a minute to get my shoes
[2:05:05] on, but when I got them
[2:05:09] on, I say it's high time that you put
[2:05:13] your dancing shoes on and you stomp a
[2:05:16] mud hole in the devil that's been to
[2:05:19] stop a mud hole in you. Come on,
[2:05:21] somebody. Put your shoes
[2:05:26] on. Come on, put your dancing shoes on.
[2:05:30] Put your war shoes on. Put your victory
[2:05:32] shoes
[2:05:33] on. Walk in the light as he is the
[2:05:38] light. May God bless you. Do me a favor
[2:05:42] and put your victory shoes
[2:05:45] on because the attack ain't going to
[2:05:48] stop the seed. God bless you.
[2:05:50] [Music]
[2:06:00] Amen. As I look out across the land, I
[2:06:04] see God's mighty hand. Oh, the bride of
[2:06:08] Christ born in a wedding
[2:06:12] dress. Just like in the days of home.
