[40:27] [Music]
[40:37] Father,
[40:39] Lord, my hand is lifted up.
[40:41] Yes.
[40:42] Lord, unto you, Father,
[40:45] who makes a way when there is no way.
[40:49] Lord, we invite your holy presence into
[40:51] this place, Lord Jesus. Knowing that
[40:54] your promise is unto us, Lord Jesus,
[40:57] where two or three are gathered in my
[40:59] name, there you'll be. Father, we have
[41:02] come here, Lord Jesus, to lay aside
[41:05] everything.
[41:07] Lord, we just want to wash your feet,
[41:09] Father.
[41:11] Lord, it baffles me, Father, how that
[41:13] you want a
[41:16] a filthy vessel to come and wash an
[41:18] innocent
[41:19] an innocent one. But Lord, we've come
[41:22] here, Lord Jesus.
[41:25] Lord, we might feel like we are
[41:27] unworthy. We might feel like we have
[41:30] things upon our life, but Lord, you
[41:32] chose us for this purpose. And that's
[41:35] our desire tonight is to see your glory
[41:37] manifested in us. Lord, we just invite
[41:40] you just now, Father, Lord, to come and
[41:43] take this service, Lord, and make it a
[41:45] blessing under thy kingdom, Father. You
[41:48] have allowed us one more opportunity.
[41:50] And Lord Jesus, Lord, I I've humbled
[41:53] myself before you, Lord. These people,
[41:56] we might be humble, Lord, but you're
[41:58] great, and you're greatly to be praised,
[42:01] Father. Lord, we might seem like we're
[42:04] just don't have the education or we
[42:07] might feel like we don't have things
[42:09] that would maybe satisfy human
[42:11] vocabulary, but Lord, you know our
[42:14] heart. And Lord, we just want to express
[42:16] that tonight. Lord, we have many needs
[42:19] amongst us. And Lord, I realize, Lord,
[42:21] that it needs you. And so, Father, we
[42:24] just ask that you would just come and
[42:25] display your power here tonight through
[42:27] your word and begin to speak to us,
[42:29] Lord, and take us through the
[42:30] scriptures, Lord, on the things that you
[42:33] have need of for this hour. So, we
[42:35] dedicate this service unto you for the
[42:37] glory of God in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[42:41] If you have your Bibles this evening,
[42:42] we'd like to look over in the book of
[42:44] Isaiah, chapter 45,
[42:47] verse 22,
[42:49] and also Hebrews chapter 12. Verse
[42:53] one.
[43:21] Isaiah 45 and 22, look unto me and be ye
[43:26] saved, all the ends of the earth. Now to
[43:30] me, right there in those first seven
[43:32] words is the answer to everything that
[43:35] you have could be facing right now. Look
[43:37] unto me and be ye saved. No matter if
[43:41] it's healing, no matter depression, no
[43:42] matter what place you're in, if you can
[43:44] look unto him, be ye saved
[43:47] all the ends of the earth. For I am God
[43:50] and there is none else. I have sworn by
[43:53] myself. The word is gone out of my mouth
[43:56] in righteousness and shall not return.
[43:59] That unto me every knee shall bow and
[44:01] every tongue shall swear. Hebrews 12 and
[44:04] verse one,
[44:07] Paul says here, "Wherefore, seeing we
[44:11] are also compassed about with so great a
[44:13] cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
[44:17] every weight and the sin which doth so
[44:20] easily beset us. And let us run with
[44:24] patience the race that is set before us.
[44:26] Looking unto Jesus, the author and the
[44:29] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[44:32] that was set before him, endured the
[44:34] cross, despising the shame, and is sat
[44:37] down at the right hand of the throne of
[44:40] God. May God bless his word. You could
[44:42] be seated here tonight.
[44:45] Tonight, I'd like to just take a a real
[44:47] simple thought and preach to you. uh
[44:49] just like to title this our focus
[44:53] this message. Our focus is this message.
[44:57] We realize that that life is full of
[44:59] moving pieces. We realize that that we
[45:03] we're not numb to the fact that we're
[45:05] Christians, but they we are also realist
[45:07] as well. That we have responsibilities
[45:09] and we have distractions and there's
[45:11] constant emotions and there's pressures.
[45:14] And if to be honest, if we would be
[45:16] honest here, it's easy to get caught up
[45:18] in the cycle. It's easy to get caught up
[45:21] in the cycle and lose focus of what the
[45:23] main thing really is, and that's Jesus
[45:25] Christ. It's it's very easy in the world
[45:26] that we live in to to just just uh allow
[45:30] the pressures of life and the emotions
[45:32] and the and the stresses and all all the
[45:34] responsibilities to overwhelm us. But I
[45:37] I believe that's what the message of the
[45:39] hour has done. It has brought our focus
[45:41] back to what the real main thing is is
[45:44] and that is Jesus Christ. And I believe
[45:47] that if if if the word of God it speaks
[45:50] so it speaks so plainly unto us that we
[45:53] ought to look unto him. It's not that we
[45:54] should just look and just glance at it,
[45:57] but to actually fix our eyes upon and
[46:00] set our affections and anchor our
[46:02] attention right into the word of God.
[46:05] And that's why when Isaiah says, "Look
[46:07] unto me and be ye saved." The question
[46:10] is is it isn't it that we would if we
[46:13] would look at it, the question is if we
[46:15] would ask it, it's what do you see when
[46:17] you look? Because there's a lot of
[46:19] people that are seeing things, but
[46:21] they're not truly looking with their
[46:22] heart. There's a lot of people that
[46:24] stand around the around the the
[46:26] outskirts of things and they see Christ
[46:29] and they see the works of it, but are
[46:31] they really seeing or are they really
[46:33] looking with their heart? And that's
[46:34] when Paul comes in there and he lays
[46:36] that and he says, "Looking unto Jesus,
[46:39] the author and the finisher of our
[46:41] faith." Paul is saying, "Our journey, it
[46:44] begins with him and our journey ends
[46:46] with him." And we've got to keep our
[46:49] eyes on Jesus Christ every step of the
[46:52] way. It's like the It's like the man
[46:54] that was that was in the that was that
[46:56] was walking across the tight rope and he
[46:59] was walking across it and he would push
[47:01] the wheelbarrow back and forth. He
[47:03] wasn't looking to this side and he
[47:05] wasn't getting distracted by the crowds
[47:06] that was cheering him on. He was simply
[47:09] looking He was simply looking ahead of
[47:12] him. And that's what Paul is saying to
[47:14] us is is not to not to get distracted by
[47:17] the things of the world because sure
[47:19] there's a lot of distractions in Leoa.
[47:21] Surely there's a lot of things that we
[47:23] could cast our eyes upon because the
[47:25] world is constantly full of noise. It is
[47:28] constantly full of opinions and it is
[47:30] constantly full of spiritual fog where
[47:32] we realize that the smoke of a
[47:34] bottomless pit is constantly rising up
[47:36] and but we've got to come back to the
[47:39] Bible and we've got to come back with a
[47:41] clear and intentional vision that we
[47:44] realize that Jesus Christ we've got to
[47:47] come to a spot where we literally lock
[47:49] our focus in that that Christ is the
[47:52] main thing and we refuse to be
[47:55] distracted by anything that isn't like
[47:57] him to put it in just very elementary uh
[48:01] terms is that God is the only one that
[48:04] deserves our gaze.
[48:06] This word this word focus it means it
[48:09] means to the center of interest or
[48:12] activity.
[48:14] It is the state or quality of having a
[48:17] clear visual definition. And we realize
[48:21] that the Bible tells us that without a
[48:23] vision the people perish. And we realize
[48:25] that if we don't keep our vision clear
[48:27] and if we if we become unstable in our
[48:30] mind and we begin to think this way and
[48:32] think that way, we realize that we're
[48:34] going to get off on this side or the
[48:36] other. And it it means to be a central
[48:40] point of of attention and concentration.
[48:43] And I'll just say this, to me, the
[48:45] message of the hour ought to be our
[48:47] greatest concentration.
[48:49] It ought to be the greatest theme of our
[48:51] life. And that's why when William
[48:53] Brandon would come and preach on Christ,
[48:55] the mystery of God revealed, he would
[48:57] lay in there that he Christ is the
[49:00] preeminence in the church of the living
[49:02] God. And I I really believe that if if
[49:05] Christ is the preeminent in all of all
[49:07] of your do all of your doings in life, I
[49:10] believe that everything will work out
[49:12] okay.
[49:13] It doesn't matter how old you are. It
[49:15] doesn't matter how young you are. It
[49:16] doesn't matter what stage of life that
[49:18] you're in. If you can seek ye first the
[49:20] kingdom of God, then all these things
[49:22] will be added unto you. And to me, it's
[49:24] it's very simple. And I don't mean to I
[49:26] don't mean to be callous about it, and I
[49:28] don't mean to make it just be nonchalant
[49:31] about it, but I simply believe that if
[49:33] you'll put Christ first, then
[49:34] everything's going to be all right. And
[49:36] I I know that we've got young people
[49:38] that come to us and they they want these
[49:39] they want all these answers. They
[49:41] they've got this question. I simply just
[49:43] say, man, put it into put it in back to
[49:46] the scripture. If you'll put him first
[49:48] in everything, if you'll put him first,
[49:50] I believe that if you'll really put him
[49:52] first, then you'll begin to see what the
[49:55] answer to all the questions of life
[49:57] truly is. I'll just be honest, our
[50:00] church name is is our focus. Full
[50:02] Gospel, Lighthouse, Tabernacle. And I
[50:05] believe that ought that ought to be our
[50:07] focus as a church is not lose focus on
[50:10] that. We are not here just to be another
[50:12] church. We are not just here to be
[50:14] another building, but we are here to be
[50:16] a lighthouse in the midst of the
[50:18] darkness of this world that the rest of
[50:21] the world might be sinking and the rest
[50:23] of the world might be going this way and
[50:25] it might be going that way. There's got
[50:27] to be somebody that they can point
[50:30] people back to that those people are a
[50:33] lighthouse. It's just like a sailor when
[50:35] he's out there and he's out there in
[50:37] that storm, he doesn't get distracted by
[50:39] the waves. He doesn't get distracted by
[50:41] what his by what his congregation is
[50:44] saying out there on the on on the ship.
[50:46] He is simply looking at that light. He
[50:49] knows that that light is not moving. The
[50:52] sea might be moving but the light is not
[50:54] moving out there. That's why people have
[50:57] confidence in the message of the hour is
[51:00] because the message is not moving.
[51:03] People might be moving. There might be
[51:05] ideas that are move moving. There might
[51:07] be people that go from this side and go
[51:09] to that side. Don't get distracted.
[51:13] The message ain't changed.
[51:16] You might be in the worst of your times
[51:18] and in the worst of your storms, but
[51:20] keep your eye on this message. I say
[51:23] focus on this message no matter what
[51:25] stage of life that you're in.
[51:29] The man said in Christ is revealed in
[51:31] his own word. He said, "Now the
[51:33] stabilizers has been put on the ship.
[51:36] Great fearful waves are out there before
[51:38] us. But we know just beyond that wave
[51:40] yonder that we're nearing the shore.
[51:43] We're nearing the shore. He said just
[51:45] stay stable. Just stay right in the
[51:47] word. Stay with God. No matter how you
[51:50] feel, what any else anything else,
[51:52] right? Stay right with the word. Let it
[51:54] stay stable when you see all these great
[51:57] big old clouds around us and storms
[51:59] coming and atomic bombs and everything
[52:01] else they're talking about. But our
[52:02] stabilizer is right straight on the
[52:05] word. God said it would be here. And
[52:07] we'll crest every one of them. We'll go
[52:10] right over the top of them. Yes, indeed.
[52:12] They can't sink us. They can't drown us.
[52:15] You put us in the grave and we'll come
[52:17] out of it again. They'll just They're
[52:19] just That's just all there is to it.
[52:21] There ain't no way in the world to keep
[52:23] it down there. We'll crest every one of
[52:26] them cuz our great chief captain is
[52:29] calling on the other side. The message
[52:32] of the hour has seen every wave. The
[52:35] message of the hour has went through all
[52:37] kinds of trials. The message of the hour
[52:40] has went through where ideas of that
[52:42] this was William Brandham's message and
[52:44] it was a man calling a people unto
[52:47] himself. But William Brham was not
[52:50] calling a people unto himself, but he
[52:52] was literally gathering a people unto
[52:55] Jesus Christ. Just like the scripture
[52:57] said, the message has been has seen a
[53:00] lot of storms,
[53:02] but the message has it stabilizers on it
[53:05] and it's crested every single one of
[53:07] them. The message is the true expression
[53:10] of what our Lord is.
[53:14] Now, Brother Man comes in in 1963 and he
[53:17] preaches a very powerful message on the
[53:20] word look. And brother Mhamm lays some
[53:23] very fundamental doctrines in that
[53:25] message and he goes in there and he and
[53:27] he lays some things and if you haven't
[53:29] listened to a while it' be great for you
[53:30] to listen to it. Brother Brandham ties
[53:33] some things in there from the breach to
[53:35] look and he begins to talk about the
[53:36] chasm that God completely done away with
[53:39] it. Brother Brandham said this. He said
[53:41] now faith is designed to see what God
[53:44] wills and wants. And I love that because
[53:47] brother Random doesn't say it doesn't it
[53:48] isn't designed to see what we want, but
[53:50] it's designed to see what God wills and
[53:53] wants. He said there's no knowledge that
[53:55] can do that. Faith alone is designed and
[53:58] gives to the human race to find out what
[54:00] the will of God is. And you take your
[54:02] faith that you've got and it don't focus
[54:04] with the word, then you leave it alone.
[54:06] You've got the wrong kind of faith. But
[54:08] when your God-given faith focus you with
[54:11] the word of God, you're directly in line
[54:13] and zero. Oh my. God, help us in this
[54:16] hour. Great hour that we live in. Faith
[54:18] that is designed to see what God wants.
[54:21] And then he asked the question, how do
[54:23] you see it? How do you see it what God
[54:27] wants? He said, it's through the camera
[54:29] of his word, his promise. He said, this
[54:32] is a full revelation of Jesus Christ.
[54:35] That's how you begin to see what God
[54:37] wills and wants, by the message.
[54:41] It was like a It was like a great uh
[54:43] veteran pastor one time when I just come
[54:45] to the Lord. He said he put it in real
[54:47] plain He put it in real plain language
[54:49] for me. He said to me, he said, "It's
[54:51] like shooting out a rifle." He said,
[54:53] "You've got your front sight and you got
[54:55] your back sight. You know what it is."
[54:57] He said, "But you can take the front
[54:59] sight, the Bible, and you can take the
[55:00] message, and if you'll line it on the
[55:02] target, it'll come out exactly right."
[55:06] You see, we know what this message is
[55:08] called to do. We know what it's sent to
[55:10] do. We know what it's called us for. And
[55:13] we know what God's trying to do with it.
[55:15] And Satan might send a puff of wind and
[55:18] try to knock us out of aim. But if we
[55:20] can ever get in line with what the
[55:22] message says,
[55:25] that's it's easy. It's easy to get
[55:28] consumed with what's going on in the
[55:30] world. And I I I believe that it's an
[55:32] important thing to get uh uh to look at
[55:35] world events. To be honest, the only
[55:38] thing that's worth looking on the news
[55:39] for is what's going on in Russia and
[55:42] what's going on with uh Israel and
[55:43] what's going on, you know, what's going
[55:45] on with the Catholic Church. And it's
[55:47] powerful to look out there and see what
[55:49] William Brandham said in 1954 and then
[55:51] you see the Catholic Pope. It's powerful
[55:53] to watch Russia as begins to be a
[55:56] powerhouse. It's it's amazing to watch
[55:58] uh Revelations 13 and America stepping
[56:00] into that. Amen.
[56:03] It's amazing to get get caught up in
[56:05] studying those things out, but that
[56:07] shouldn't be our focus.
[56:10] We got bigger things than to focus on
[56:12] than a Catholic pope coming in from
[56:14] America. Yeah, that needed to happen.
[56:16] Yeah, it's very important that Russia's
[56:18] rising up as a powerhouse. It's amazing
[56:20] to watch as America is rising up like a
[56:23] powerhouse, but don't miss what is
[56:26] happening in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[56:28] That's the greatest thing for the church
[56:31] to be looking at is this wife, this
[56:34] bride. What God is doing in the midst of
[56:36] her.
[56:39] So God has got to select people that
[56:41] he's begin to focus his attention on
[56:44] through his word. and he begins to come
[56:45] in there and he begins to manifest his
[56:48] glory because he's got certain
[56:49] scriptures that are laid there for him
[56:52] that he's going to fulfill that Christ
[56:55] would be the preeminences in the church
[56:57] just like Joshua and Caleb.
[57:00] They was they was all alone.
[57:03] Everybody else had their focus on
[57:05] everything else.
[57:07] They had their ideas on what what the
[57:09] world politics was doing. And they they
[57:11] looked over there and they seen all them
[57:13] giants and they seen they seen that they
[57:15] look like nothing but a bunch of
[57:16] grasshoppers in the sight of in sight of
[57:18] all of the of all of all the enemies out
[57:21] there. And Caleb and Joshua simply sat
[57:23] there said, "We're more than able to
[57:25] take it." And I love what brother
[57:27] Brandham said. He said the reason why
[57:28] they could say that, he said, "Because
[57:30] they were thoroughbreds." He said they
[57:32] were born different than the rest of
[57:34] them. You see, they were born from above
[57:37] and the rest of the field of them mules
[57:39] were standing out there said, "We'll
[57:41] never be able to take it." But there
[57:42] were some genuine thoroughbreds that had
[57:45] an abstract title deed that knew that
[57:47] that land was there.
[57:51] Let me just put it in very plain
[57:53] language. They saw giants.
[57:56] They saw obstacles. When I come back
[57:58] from Canada in a month or so, I'm going
[58:00] to preach a sermon on there. We saw
[58:02] giants. And they they begin to see these
[58:05] giants. Sure, Caleb saw it. Sure, Joshua
[58:08] saw it. But that didn't obstruct their
[58:11] focus. They didn't get off and say,
[58:13] "Well, it's too big. They're too great.
[58:15] There's too they're too monstrous. The
[58:17] land's too much for us. We won't be able
[58:19] to handle it." They simply focused
[58:22] themsel back to the promise. So, let me
[58:25] just grab a little inspiration right
[58:26] there. There is a lot of giants in the
[58:29] land right now. Leodysa is a giant. Sin
[58:33] is a giant. Cancer is a giant. But we
[58:37] had a prophet stand in a cave with an
[58:40] angel and said that not even cancer
[58:42] would stand before your prayer.
[58:47] Yes, there's a lot of giants out there,
[58:50] but we're not focused on the giants.
[58:53] David wasn't focused on the giant. David
[58:56] was focused on what God said.
[58:59] Yes, there's giants out there. Yes,
[59:01] Leodysa is out there. Yes, Sodom is out
[59:04] there. But that's not my focus.
[59:09] I was talking to brother Matthew and
[59:10] Sister Heather today while I was getting
[59:12] my haircut and I was talking about how
[59:15] bad I hate flying.
[59:18] I get I get heartburn from flying.
[59:23] It's a it's one of the greatest things
[59:25] to watch to watch an eagle and the right
[59:27] brothers catch that inspiration and they
[59:29] they gathered that from an eagle and man
[59:32] it's amazing thing when everything goes
[59:33] right but man when it goes wrong it's
[59:35] bad. We just talking about talking about
[59:38] where I lose my cool real quick when
[59:41] when I know people are supposed to be
[59:43] doing their jobs and they don't. So
[59:44] anyways, well I was just simply saying I
[59:47] was simply saying this that I I I
[59:49] despise flying in a sense because it all
[59:52] all the things that could go wrong.
[59:55] But even in that as much as I hate it, I
[59:59] keep going.
[1:00:01] Why? Because I'm focused on one thing.
[1:00:05] And you may not understand why, brother
[1:00:07] Ron, or why why these brothers keep
[1:00:09] going and why go preaching. It's not
[1:00:11] because we want attention of going to
[1:00:13] preach in this meeting and that meeting.
[1:00:15] My focus is on that last seat. And I
[1:00:18] really don't care. I really don't care
[1:00:21] how it's got to come. But I'm focused
[1:00:24] even though I may hate something or
[1:00:26] doing something this way. I got to go
[1:00:28] because I've been commissioned to preach
[1:00:31] this message to go into all the world
[1:00:34] and preach this until every creature's
[1:00:37] heard it.
[1:00:39] You might despise, you might despise
[1:00:42] witnessing on your job, but you got to
[1:00:44] be focused.
[1:00:46] Let me say this. Full gospel lighthouse.
[1:00:48] Do not lose your focus. This message is
[1:00:52] our everything. It's like Sister
[1:00:54] Gabrielle saying it tonight. To me, he's
[1:00:56] become my everything.
[1:00:58] He's every I owe everything to him. If
[1:01:01] it wasn't for this message, me and you
[1:01:04] wouldn't be standing here. We wouldn't
[1:01:06] know about William Brham. We wouldn't
[1:01:08] know about Ed Bisll. We wouldn't know
[1:01:10] about Homer Frasier. We wouldn't know
[1:01:12] about Charlie Spencer. The message has
[1:01:15] been the thing that brought us together.
[1:01:18] To be honest, all of the exams would not
[1:01:21] be here. All of the believers from North
[1:01:24] Carolina wouldn't be here. All of Elton
[1:01:26] would not be here. Things would be much
[1:01:28] different
[1:01:30] had it not been for this message.
[1:01:33] But because of this message has been so
[1:01:36] great,
[1:01:38] I can tell you the world could not save
[1:01:41] me. Religion could not save me.
[1:01:44] Everything the world had could not save
[1:01:46] me. But the message of the hour changed
[1:01:50] my life.
[1:01:52] I once was this way. But from that time,
[1:02:01] what are you saying? I'm saying that
[1:02:03] ain't the end of my story.
[1:02:05] Yeah, there's giants over there.
[1:02:07] But yes, that's where giants fall.
[1:02:11] Yes, there's cancer out there, but
[1:02:12] that's where cancer falls. Yes, there's
[1:02:15] Jericho walls out there, but that's
[1:02:17] where Jericho walls fall. You've got to
[1:02:20] remain focused
[1:02:22] because yes, there's things out there in
[1:02:24] front of you. But don't worry about what
[1:02:26] other people say about it.
[1:02:29] Don't get worried because the crowd
[1:02:30] doesn't follow it.
[1:02:34] majority, the majority doesn't want the
[1:02:36] message.
[1:02:38] Who cares? Because I had a prophet tell
[1:02:40] me between one and Christ is a majority.
[1:02:44] He said, if he's got one, if he's got
[1:02:47] one and you got Christ, he said, you and
[1:02:49] Christ together is the majority. Who
[1:02:52] cares if the world doesn't want this
[1:02:53] message? I want this message. Who cares
[1:02:57] if they turn it down? I want this
[1:02:59] message.
[1:03:01] That's what Caleb and Joshua was doing.
[1:03:04] They were focusing. Who?
[1:03:07] There's a lot of people that didn't run
[1:03:08] well, but what hindered them? What
[1:03:10] hindered them was they could not focus.
[1:03:16] What was they looking at? Literally, you
[1:03:19] think about it. What was different about
[1:03:21] them? I'll say it like this. They had
[1:03:23] something different on the inside of
[1:03:25] them. They were looking at the unseen
[1:03:28] because the things they were seeing was
[1:03:30] temporal. But the things that they were
[1:03:33] not seeing was eternal. And they didn't
[1:03:36] see Abraham.
[1:03:39] Joshua never sat down in fellowship with
[1:03:41] Abraham.
[1:03:44] But he had had fellowship with the same
[1:03:46] one that was speaking to Abraham. I
[1:03:49] never met William Brham, but I met the
[1:03:51] same one that he was fellowshipping
[1:03:54] with.
[1:03:55] I never met Congressman Upshaw. I never
[1:03:58] saw him got healed. But I have watched
[1:04:01] people in that same condition.
[1:04:05] I've watched little girls get up out of
[1:04:07] a wheelchair
[1:04:11] because of the message.
[1:04:16] Now, this is young people that to me if
[1:04:19] you if you can just capture the power of
[1:04:22] this quote. Brother man was speaking
[1:04:24] about Abraham. He said, "And after
[1:04:27] looking to the unseen, he called those
[1:04:28] things which were not as though they
[1:04:31] were." He said he got a glimpse of the
[1:04:34] unseen. That word glimpse is a brief or
[1:04:38] a partial view. He just caught a glimpse
[1:04:39] of it.
[1:04:42] Just the glimpse was enough.
[1:04:48] You know, I
[1:04:51] I think I don't think that we're
[1:04:53] anything special. I don't I'm going to
[1:04:55] say something. I don't think we're I
[1:04:57] don't think that our church is any
[1:04:59] different than any other church except
[1:05:01] for we invite the Holy Spirit to do what
[1:05:05] he said he would do.
[1:05:08] But then
[1:05:10] you find people that
[1:05:13] that labor for one time in his presence.
[1:05:18] I I've been
[1:05:20] privileged to be on the other side of
[1:05:22] things where people have said they had
[1:05:24] never experienced what you experience
[1:05:26] seem like every single weekend.
[1:05:32] And when when I hear those things,
[1:05:35] you don't know the burden that it puts
[1:05:37] on me,
[1:05:41] but you don't realize what you're going
[1:05:44] to be held accountable for.
[1:05:48] To be honest, who could say they have
[1:05:51] felt the presence of the Lord?
[1:05:57] I have sat down with young people
[1:06:01] and the first time they ever felt it
[1:06:02] said, "We've never felt that in our
[1:06:04] church. We never been offered that
[1:06:05] opportunity." I've sat down with elders
[1:06:08] and they said, "Well, we've never been
[1:06:11] into a place." And I think about how
[1:06:13] many times, brother Samuel, Brother
[1:06:15] Chester, where we sat there
[1:06:18] and he comes time after time after time.
[1:06:23] It's kind of like the woman
[1:06:25] when she had chose the wrong life
[1:06:30] and she had done a lot of bad deeds.
[1:06:33] Her focus was on some things of the
[1:06:35] world and it gave her some living.
[1:06:40] But she heard about a man
[1:06:43] that could change her story.
[1:06:47] And she she walked into a crowd and the
[1:06:49] rest of the crowd sitting around there
[1:06:52] and they're not paying him an attention.
[1:06:54] To be honest, Jesus ain't the focus of
[1:06:57] the party.
[1:07:00] But this woman is so focused.
[1:07:04] She is driven.
[1:07:06] She's driven when when there's
[1:07:09] scoffers there, there's mockers there,
[1:07:13] there's people there that are just there
[1:07:16] to make fun of Jesus. This woman is
[1:07:19] focused.
[1:07:21] She is intentional in her praise
[1:07:24] and she takes everything that she had
[1:07:27] that she worked for doing the wrong kind
[1:07:28] of a deeds and she was focused. She
[1:07:32] didn't care when the man told her said,
[1:07:34] "You're spending too much money on
[1:07:36] this." Oh, she was focused. She didn't
[1:07:38] care when she walked in that crowd and
[1:07:40] she was dirty. She was focused. She
[1:07:43] didn't care when others said she's
[1:07:45] wretched. She's she shouldn't even be in
[1:07:47] the room. She was focused. She didn't
[1:07:50] care what Simon said about her. She was
[1:07:52] focused. He Jesus did not even care what
[1:07:56] Peter and the other brothers are sitting
[1:07:58] there, what they said about him. And if
[1:08:00] he really was a prophet, then he
[1:08:02] wouldn't allow this woman to touch him.
[1:08:04] He was focused.
[1:08:09] You're going to have this side and
[1:08:11] you're going to have that side. You're
[1:08:13] always going to be that way. It's always
[1:08:15] no matter where we go, no matter how how
[1:08:18] high we get in the spiritual realm,
[1:08:20] there's always going to be the side that
[1:08:21] says you shouldn't get that high. And
[1:08:23] then there's going to be those ones that
[1:08:24] said, you know what, we ought to be up
[1:08:26] there, but we we really can't get up
[1:08:28] there. Just thank God that you're up
[1:08:30] there. You're always going to have
[1:08:33] people that can't ride the middle of the
[1:08:34] road, but Isaiah 35 said, "Stay right in
[1:08:38] the highway."
[1:08:39] This is my focus. This woman was
[1:08:43] intentional.
[1:08:47] To be honest, she went in there with
[1:08:50] such focus that she didn't even care if
[1:08:52] Jesus was going to turn her away.
[1:08:56] She had intent.
[1:08:58] To me, it's overwhelming to think
[1:09:05] that she didn't even realize what she
[1:09:07] was doing, but she was so intent on
[1:09:10] fulfilling prophecy.
[1:09:13] Let me get back to this quote that's
[1:09:16] free. Brother man said he said when a
[1:09:19] man once catches that vision of the
[1:09:22] invisible God and knows that he's always
[1:09:25] present he said there's something that
[1:09:28] stabilizes that man's thinking it
[1:09:30] stabilizes his action in the time of
[1:09:32] distress and in trouble it'll still make
[1:09:35] him look upward and above the things
[1:09:37] that are happening around him because
[1:09:39] he's looking at the unseen. You see the
[1:09:42] unseen makes the gospel present.
[1:09:47] You look at when you begin to think
[1:09:48] about how that Jesus how Jesus would
[1:09:52] come in and God would come in there and
[1:09:54] he makes the gospel present. Abraham had
[1:09:57] failures. Abraham saw impossibilities.
[1:10:00] Abraham he looked at the mistakes that
[1:10:03] he had. He saw the complications of
[1:10:04] Sarah. To be honest, he saw his own
[1:10:07] body. His own body kept letting him
[1:10:10] down. But he had to focus himself away.
[1:10:14] Something on the inside of him caused
[1:10:16] him to stabilize himself. In the midst
[1:10:20] of it all, in the midst of it all, he
[1:10:23] focused himself to the unseen.
[1:10:27] And to me, it is simply amazing that God
[1:10:31] uses imperfect people throughout the
[1:10:34] Bible to bring about his perfect plans.
[1:10:37] Abraham failed him. Moses had a temper.
[1:10:40] Jacob was a deceiver. David committed
[1:10:43] adultery. Peter denied the Lord's
[1:10:45] rights. Paul beat the Christians.
[1:10:55] But God consistently
[1:10:57] worked through imperfection people. He
[1:11:00] worked through flawed individuals
[1:11:02] because he was focused.
[1:11:05] To me, I was I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:11:08] just I'm caught up in this thought.
[1:11:13] To me, I I just sat and I began to think
[1:11:16] about this and it it just it overwhelmed
[1:11:18] me in my study today.
[1:11:21] You see the imperfections of people and
[1:11:23] you see the mistakes in them. You see
[1:11:25] the mistakes in Abraham. You see the
[1:11:27] mistakes in Moses. You see the mistakes
[1:11:29] in Isaiah. You see the mistakes in
[1:11:30] Ezekiel. You see the mistakes in Joseph.
[1:11:32] You see the mistakes. You see it all.
[1:11:36] You flip over to them few pages
[1:11:40] between
[1:11:42] Matthew
[1:11:43] and Malachi.
[1:11:51] I'm I'mma drop some stuff out my Bible.
[1:11:56] It's pretty thin
[1:11:59] to be honest. If you really wanted to,
[1:12:00] you could probably see from the front to
[1:12:02] the back
[1:12:04] because that paper's real thin.
[1:12:08] On this side, Abraham makes mistakes.
[1:12:11] And on this side, he don't make
[1:12:13] mistakes. On this side, Moses is guilty.
[1:12:17] On this side, Moses is perfect. On this
[1:12:20] side, Joseph got in trouble.
[1:12:24] On this side, Joseph is perfect.
[1:12:28] It's amazing to me how God used
[1:12:31] imperfect people to bring about a
[1:12:33] perfect plan.
[1:12:36] And I was sitting in my study and I was
[1:12:38] thinking about this today. It
[1:12:40] overwhelmed me that God had people that
[1:12:42] was so f Abraham was focused. He left
[1:12:45] his mother. He left his father. He left
[1:12:47] everything that he knew to go out to a
[1:12:49] land that he never saw. He saw Moses
[1:12:52] that left everything that he ever was
[1:12:54] raised up to be. He left it all to go
[1:12:56] wondering in the backside of a desert.
[1:12:58] You look at Joseph, he gave up
[1:13:01] everything.
[1:13:03] He told his dream to his own flesh and
[1:13:07] blood and his own brothers.
[1:13:13] His own brothers was focused about being
[1:13:15] greater in the midst of their father.
[1:13:20] Glory be to God. But it didn't stop
[1:13:23] Jacob. He still it didn't stop Joseph.
[1:13:26] He still told his dream.
[1:13:29] Can you imagine Joseph knowing he's a
[1:13:33] little bitty boy? Can you imagine these
[1:13:35] young boys having a dream of their
[1:13:37] mother, their father, and all their
[1:13:38] brothers bowing down before him? And
[1:13:41] Joseph's in a pit and he still had a
[1:13:43] dream. Joseph is in Piper's house and he
[1:13:46] still got a dream. He's down in a prison
[1:13:49] and he still Hallelujah. and he still
[1:13:51] got a dream. He rises the second in
[1:13:54] command and he still got a dream. He was
[1:13:57] focused.
[1:13:59] You don't even realize what is what is
[1:14:01] moving you, but something is moving you.
[1:14:07] But this is what made me want to shout
[1:14:10] all over my house today.
[1:14:16] Can you imagine how focused God is?
[1:14:20] Yeah, Abraham's going to make mistakes,
[1:14:22] but I'm still going to use him. Yes,
[1:14:24] Moses is going to make mistakes, but I'm
[1:14:26] still going to use him. Yes, they're
[1:14:28] going to fall, but I'm still going to
[1:14:30] use them. Yes, they're not going to
[1:14:31] understand, but I'm still going to use
[1:14:33] them. God is so focused
[1:14:37] on getting you to your position that he
[1:14:39] doesn't care how he's got to get you
[1:14:42] there.
[1:14:44] You hear some of your stories,
[1:14:50] you just got to you you know God's got a
[1:14:52] sense of humor.
[1:14:54] Like how David Pierce is in the
[1:14:56] building. You know God's got a you know
[1:14:59] good and well God's got a sense of humor
[1:15:00] when he when he called me to preach.
[1:15:05] You know good and well he you know good
[1:15:07] and well he's got a good sense of humor.
[1:15:10] when he called Homer Fraser.
[1:15:13] We were talking about it this week.
[1:15:16] His grandfather, Brother Duck's
[1:15:18] grandfather,
[1:15:19] was paid was paid to fight people in
[1:15:23] bars,
[1:15:24] made a living that way. And here, our
[1:15:27] former pastor, you know, God's got a
[1:15:29] sense of humor,
[1:15:32] raised up in a in a bootleggger's home,
[1:15:36] but he chooses him to preach this
[1:15:39] message.
[1:15:40] You know, God ain't concerned about
[1:15:43] where you came from and this generation
[1:15:45] and that generation and and that curse
[1:15:47] and that idea and what this one says
[1:15:49] about you and what that one says about
[1:15:51] you. God is focused on getting his seed
[1:15:54] to its destination.
[1:15:57] And God is not dying in how he gets you
[1:15:59] there. He might have to take you through
[1:16:01] trial. He might have to take you through
[1:16:03] circumstances. He might have to take you
[1:16:06] through the hall of critics. But God is
[1:16:09] so focused.
[1:16:12] Let the world say this. Let the church
[1:16:15] say that. But God is focused.
[1:16:18] [Applause]
[1:16:24] I'm sorry. I'm taking too long.
[1:16:31] I got to get focused and preach.
[1:16:34] Colossians 3:1. If ye then be risen with
[1:16:37] Christ, seek those things which are
[1:16:39] above, where Christ siteth on the right
[1:16:42] hand of God. Set your affection on
[1:16:44] things above and not on the things of
[1:16:46] this earth. For you are dead and your
[1:16:49] life is head with Christ in God. Brother
[1:16:52] Manam said, "And how can I overcome?" He
[1:16:54] said, "This is the age of the personal
[1:16:57] life of Jesus Christ." Brother Manam
[1:16:59] said, he said, "You know the prophet
[1:17:01] watched nature." He said, "I was out
[1:17:03] there and he said, "I was watching that
[1:17:05] that tree." He said, "I jumped up on
[1:17:06] that old on that old beach tree." And he
[1:17:08] said, he said, "I looked at it." He
[1:17:10] said, "It looked great on the outside."
[1:17:11] He said, "But as soon as I jumped on
[1:17:13] it," he said, "A big chunk fell off of
[1:17:15] it." He said, "It taught me a lesson."
[1:17:17] He said, "Even though it was living
[1:17:19] right there where the water was," he
[1:17:20] said, "the" He said, "The secret to
[1:17:22] life, the secret to overcoming is to
[1:17:25] keep life in you."
[1:17:28] Let me let me just say it like this. If
[1:17:30] you want to live an overcoming life, you
[1:17:32] got to stay focused to be in the
[1:17:35] presence of almighty God. Let me say God
[1:17:38] is eternal. But you are his attributes.
[1:17:43] Let me say you're not a reformation
[1:17:44] work.
[1:17:46] You're restoration. Let me say this.
[1:17:49] You're not an afterthought. You're not
[1:17:50] an aftermarket. You're original. And if
[1:17:53] you are original, that means you can be
[1:17:56] restored. An aftermarket. Hallelujah.
[1:18:00] An aftermarket is simply an afterthought
[1:18:02] that somebody else can replace and
[1:18:04] replace and replace. But the bride of
[1:18:07] Jesus Christ is irreplaceable.
[1:18:11] You are restorable even no matter how
[1:18:14] far in sin you may have fallen.
[1:18:17] When you look in Luke 13 and 16 and you
[1:18:20] look there, this woman had been bowed
[1:18:23] down for 18 years with an infirmity.
[1:18:28] Hallelujah.
[1:18:30] She was not an afterthought. She was not
[1:18:33] an aftermarket, but she was restorable.
[1:18:38] She had been 18 years. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:18:41] just I'm focused now. I'm focused on a
[1:18:45] target and I'm going to get the devil.
[1:18:49] She had been bowed down. You remember
[1:18:52] when the prophet would talk about that
[1:18:53] woman in South Africa? He said, "I
[1:18:55] couldn't see her out there." He said she
[1:18:57] was bowed down. He said when I he said
[1:18:59] she was below them. He said but when I
[1:19:01] started praying for her, he said you
[1:19:03] could hear all of them bones in her back
[1:19:05] cracking and she stood up and he said
[1:19:08] she was about 6' tall by the time she
[1:19:10] got done cracking her back back in
[1:19:12] place. This woman in Luke 13, Jesus
[1:19:17] looks on this woman
[1:19:20] and she has been bowed down to the
[1:19:22] earth.
[1:19:24] Let me say it like this. She had her
[1:19:26] focus on the ground.
[1:19:34] You ever been in a spot like that where
[1:19:36] you know how to get healed and you know
[1:19:39] how to get delivered and you know how to
[1:19:41] get set free, but you are in such a
[1:19:43] spot.
[1:19:44] You ever got in that spot where you know
[1:19:46] all the answers? You know all the
[1:19:47] scriptures?
[1:19:49] I know I I know I'm pe I'm preaching to
[1:19:51] the right people.
[1:19:53] I'm a preacher and I've got here before.
[1:19:55] I know all the answers. I know how to
[1:19:58] overcome. I know how to live a
[1:19:59] victorious life. I know how to whip the
[1:20:02] devil. But you ever got to that spot in
[1:20:05] your life where you know all the answers
[1:20:07] and you know what to say and you know
[1:20:09] how to say it and you still just can't
[1:20:11] get out of that that glooiness that
[1:20:14] you're in.
[1:20:17] And the devil beats you around because
[1:20:19] because literally you can't get yourself
[1:20:21] up out of it.
[1:20:23] You can you can play music. You can you
[1:20:26] can sing all the right songs. You can
[1:20:28] amen at the right time. You you become
[1:20:30] well-versed in the scriptures and you
[1:20:32] just can't get yourself up out of it.
[1:20:35] But let me say this to you. You don't
[1:20:36] have to get yourself up out of it. When
[1:20:38] the son of Abraham says, "Don't you
[1:20:41] worry. I'm gonna get you up."
[1:20:46] The Bible said that she couldn't even
[1:20:48] lift herself up. But when Jesus touched
[1:20:51] her, all of a sudden, he said the Bible
[1:20:55] said that she was immediately well.
[1:21:01] This is this is so important to me
[1:21:06] because you got Jesus, you got the
[1:21:09] infirmity, and you got the
[1:21:11] self-righteous message believers on this
[1:21:13] side. You know what? But if he really
[1:21:15] knew what he was doing, he'd recognize
[1:21:17] that we're on the Sabbath day. What kind
[1:21:19] of prophet is he? He knows we don't do
[1:21:22] those things. I love what Jesus tells
[1:21:24] him. You know good and well, you walk
[1:21:26] out there and you take your donkey and
[1:21:28] you go out there and you water it.
[1:21:31] How much more, notice what Jesus does.
[1:21:34] How much more should this daughter of
[1:21:36] Abraham,
[1:21:39] he didn't identify her with her bondage
[1:21:42] or her infirmity. Why? Because she was
[1:21:45] already healed.
[1:21:48] Do you realize that your situation
[1:21:51] releases the almighty God?
[1:21:55] To show forth himself. Abraham was a
[1:21:59] father of faith. But when he goes up in
[1:22:01] Genesis 22 on Mount Mariah, when he goes
[1:22:04] up there and he takes Isaac,
[1:22:08] let me say this. Abraham was focused.
[1:22:13] Just to be honest,
[1:22:15] you'd have to be focused to do what he's
[1:22:17] getting ready to do.
[1:22:20] I'd say he wouldn't even think about
[1:22:21] what Sarah's going to say. You mean to
[1:22:23] tell me that you going to take the boy
[1:22:25] that I I went through menstrual cycle
[1:22:27] after menstrual cycle knowing knowing
[1:22:30] that I wasn't pregnant and you going to
[1:22:31] take him up there on that mountain just
[1:22:33] because that voice that you don't see
[1:22:35] he's just talking to you and tells you
[1:22:37] to crucify him?
[1:22:40] Abraham wasn't worried about what she
[1:22:41] was going to say.
[1:22:44] Abraham wasn't even worried about the
[1:22:45] gentleman that was with him because the
[1:22:48] gentlemen that were with him knew he was
[1:22:50] going for sacrifice. He had wood and he
[1:22:52] had fire. They done watched Abraham
[1:22:54] worship a few times. So they knew he had
[1:22:56] to have a sacrifice up there. But
[1:22:58] Abraham was focused. He was focused on
[1:23:02] getting this position. He was focused on
[1:23:05] obeying what God said.
[1:23:09] And Abram got himself into a place
[1:23:14] that he literally prophesied Isaac back
[1:23:18] before it could ever happen.
[1:23:20] Do you realize that you don't even
[1:23:23] realize sometimes what you're saying,
[1:23:25] but you're bringing an attribute right
[1:23:27] out of God?
[1:23:30] This woman in Luke 13, she didn't
[1:23:32] realize that morning when she woke up
[1:23:34] that the day that her focus was going to
[1:23:36] change. Abraham didn't realize when he
[1:23:39] was climbing that mountain up there that
[1:23:40] he was getting ready to bring something
[1:23:43] out of Jehovah that had never been shown
[1:23:45] before. But because of his faith, Gyra,
[1:23:50] Gyra was produced because of Abraham's
[1:23:54] faith. Do you realize that what happened
[1:23:57] right there on that mountain has
[1:24:00] released Gyra to your situation? That he
[1:24:03] turned around and said because you obey
[1:24:05] me that in blessing I'll bless thee and
[1:24:08] in multiplying I'll multiply that I will
[1:24:10] bless not only your seed but thy seed
[1:24:13] seed.
[1:24:16] What am I saying? I'm saying he is Gyra,
[1:24:19] the provider for your children's
[1:24:22] children that ain't even here yet.
[1:24:27] I'm saying this so loud that he is
[1:24:30] Jehovah Gyra for Noah's children and
[1:24:34] and for Titus's children. Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] Before they're even in the picture, he
[1:24:41] was Jehovah Gyra. Before Isaac got on
[1:24:44] the mountain,
[1:24:46] God was focused to produce a lamb.
[1:24:49] Before he went to Pilot's judgment hall,
[1:24:52] Jesus was focused.
[1:24:57] Wow.
[1:24:59] This message.
[1:25:21] Notice what the Bible said. I'm I'm just
[1:25:23] going to kindness down.
[1:25:28] Hebrews 10:35 says, "Cast not away,
[1:25:31] therefore, your confidence, which hath
[1:25:33] great recompense of reward.
[1:25:36] For ye have need of patience, that after
[1:25:38] you have done the will of God, you might
[1:25:40] receive the promise. For yet a little
[1:25:42] while, and he that shall come will come
[1:25:45] and will not tarry. The just shall live
[1:25:48] by faith. But if any man draw back, my
[1:25:51] soul hath no pleasure in him.
[1:25:55] So the Bible shows us a very clear
[1:25:58] there's that there's two choices
[1:26:01] between in the directions of life.
[1:26:06] Not to lose your confidence just because
[1:26:08] you don't see it.
[1:26:12] Not to lose when you you've got to make
[1:26:15] as a Christian, you've got to make the
[1:26:18] right choices.
[1:26:19] And as a Christian, you're going to have
[1:26:20] to make some hard choices.
[1:26:23] To be honest, you're going to have to
[1:26:24] take the high road a lot of times. And
[1:26:26] the high road is a lot of times a harder
[1:26:28] road. It's got a lot of mountain tops.
[1:26:31] It's got a lot of rocky edges. It's got
[1:26:34] a lot of times where the enemy can come
[1:26:36] in there and he can blow all kinds of
[1:26:37] slippery slopes in there.
[1:26:40] To be honest, the other side or the
[1:26:43] other choice is a lot easier, but it
[1:26:46] doesn't have the same reward as taking
[1:26:47] the higher road.
[1:26:50] To be honest, you're going to be you're
[1:26:51] going to be up there on that mountain.
[1:26:53] You're going to go through spots when
[1:26:55] you get lonely. You're going to go
[1:26:56] through spots when you're all alone up
[1:26:58] there. But to be honest, it is the
[1:27:01] greatest spot where you can be an
[1:27:02] example is when you choose this path
[1:27:06] that no matter what comes, the
[1:27:07] distractions that may come, the troubles
[1:27:09] that may come, the slippery slopes that
[1:27:11] might come,
[1:27:14] you don't have to worry about cuz God's
[1:27:16] got a lifeline around you
[1:27:19] and he's going to guide you right all
[1:27:20] the way through. He's going to take you
[1:27:22] all the way. Don't you get worried about
[1:27:24] the high tops and whether you can see
[1:27:26] because the fog on the mountain or not.
[1:27:32] Don't lose your confidence cuz you ain't
[1:27:34] seen him on the mountain yet.
[1:27:39] Well, Andrew, you got no idea what I've
[1:27:41] been through.
[1:27:44] I'm going say this. When you're tempted
[1:27:46] to falter in your faith, keep climbing.
[1:27:51] Keep climbing.
[1:27:54] I I know I know I told this at a camp
[1:27:56] one time. I don't know if I ever told it
[1:27:57] here or not, but there was a guy that
[1:27:59] was flying a plane one time
[1:28:02] that he flying this plane and he kept
[1:28:06] hearing this he kept hearing this uh
[1:28:09] kept hearing this noise sound like a rat
[1:28:12] and he hear it down there and it it's
[1:28:14] chomping on the wires and all the all
[1:28:16] the instruments.
[1:28:18] He got nervous like, man, I I'm up here
[1:28:20] flying.
[1:28:22] This thing eats through my wires and all
[1:28:24] my contacts and all these things. I'm
[1:28:27] a pretty much bad deal.
[1:28:31] Said, "Man, if I don't if I don't if I
[1:28:32] if I don't find this rat," and he
[1:28:34] couldn't find it nowhere. So then all of
[1:28:36] a sudden, it hit him. So, you know what?
[1:28:39] That thing ain't built to fly up as
[1:28:40] high. So, he just kept climbing higher,
[1:28:43] kept climbing higher, and it got colder,
[1:28:45] and it got colder, and it got colder.
[1:28:46] And he said before long he said that
[1:28:48] gnawing stopped. He said I couldn't hear
[1:28:50] that mouse chewing on them promises no
[1:28:53] more and saying that they were for days
[1:28:54] gone by and for the miracle days of
[1:28:56] miracles has passed. He said I just kept
[1:28:58] climbing. I just kept climbing. I just
[1:28:59] kept climbing. He didn't hear the
[1:29:01] chatter the squirrel no more.
[1:29:04] You know what I'm saying? I say this. If
[1:29:07] you keep climbing, the rat will die. You
[1:29:10] keep climbing then the things that are
[1:29:11] bothering you will die. Because the more
[1:29:13] you fly higher.
[1:29:17] When you get tempted to falter in your
[1:29:20] faith,
[1:29:21] let me say this. Remind yourself of how
[1:29:24] good God was yesterday. And remind
[1:29:26] yourself of how good God was the day
[1:29:28] before.
[1:29:30] Because if you can remember how good God
[1:29:31] was yesterday and the day before and the
[1:29:33] day before that, it'll give you faith to
[1:29:35] go through the present. And I say this,
[1:29:37] the God of my past that was guiding me
[1:29:39] is good enough to take me to my future.
[1:29:45] He is coming for them that love
[1:29:49] his appearing.
[1:29:53] And that's what he's coming for. Those
[1:29:55] that look unto him for his appearing.
[1:29:57] Let me say this.
[1:29:59] Don't you get distracted.
[1:30:01] Stay focused.
[1:30:03] Why did he send this message?
[1:30:06] Brother Ram taught us. He said, "Now
[1:30:08] look." He said, "His coming and his
[1:30:10] appearance is two different things."
[1:30:13] He said, "Notice."
[1:30:15] He said, "That's why he's appearing to
[1:30:16] us right now to show forth his power,
[1:30:18] his glory." When you look and you see
[1:30:21] Malachi 4, you see Luke 17, and you see
[1:30:24] Revelations 10, you see all these
[1:30:26] promises fulfilled, you are watching his
[1:30:29] appearing, stay focused. He's coming.
[1:30:35] I I'm I'm closing and and musicians
[1:30:37] could come. I didn't get focused enough
[1:30:40] to preach all my thoughts. So, I guess
[1:30:42] that'll be a part two for somebody.
[1:30:47] But Job
[1:30:49] knew that his redeemer was going to
[1:30:50] live.
[1:30:53] Brother said his body had got to such a
[1:30:56] spot. He said it was only a spoonful of
[1:30:57] his ashes left.
[1:30:59] He said, "But yet before him was a
[1:31:01] vision that I know that my redeemer
[1:31:04] lives,
[1:31:06] and when he saw him,
[1:31:08] he recognized this is his coming."
[1:31:12] What has this message been doing? You've
[1:31:14] watched his appearing, it's made you
[1:31:17] ready for his coming.
[1:31:20] I say stay focused right there.
[1:31:23] Don't lose your sight. Don't lose your
[1:31:25] sight on what's going on around you.
[1:31:27] Just stay focused.
[1:31:30] Just stay focused on him.
[1:31:33] Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] Hallelujah.
[1:31:38] Let me maybe we have that song in the
[1:31:40] morning when I rise.
[1:31:43] Give me Jesus.
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:48] In the morning
[1:31:50] when I rise.

[1:33:51] Jesus.

[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:07] [Applause]
[1:34:09] You can have
[1:34:12] this for
[1:34:17] Jes.
[1:34:20] Yes. Christ alone
[1:34:24] will I glory.
[1:34:27] Oh, I could find myself
[1:34:32] as

[1:34:37] I've been blessed beyond measure
[1:34:43] and only by strength I will become.

[1:34:59] sexies

[1:35:15] to Praise
[1:35:19] the Lord which I sing
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:24] in Christ alone.
[1:35:29] I praise my trust
[1:35:35] and find my glory.
[1:35:39] The power of the cross
[1:35:46] in every victory.
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:52] Oh, let it be said.
[1:35:55] Help me,
[1:35:58] my source of strength.
[1:36:03] My soul support
[1:36:07] is Christ alone.
[1:36:13] In Christ alone
[1:36:16] will my glory.
[1:36:20] Oh, divine
[1:36:23] grace high
[1:36:29] and only his
[1:36:32] spare mercies
[1:36:36] can reach beyond my weakness.
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:45] Oh, now

[1:39:03] Oh,
[1:39:04] and we'll be going
[1:39:08] home. Oh,
[1:39:10] [Music]
[1:39:15] and count the years as
[1:39:24] Oh,
[1:39:25] and count the months as we
[1:39:36] and count the weeks last days
[1:39:41] any day now
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:46] and we'll be going home. Count the
[1:39:50] years. Oh, count the years as much.
[1:40:00] Oh,
[1:40:02] and count the months as weeks
[1:40:11] [Music]
[1:40:13] and count the weeks as
[1:40:17] a day now.
[1:40:20] [Music]
[1:40:27] You know, a lot of times we don't even
[1:40:29] realize we're in the middle of the
[1:40:31] supernatural.
[1:40:32] Amen.
[1:40:33] Cuz Peter, when he stepped out on the
[1:40:35] water and he saw the Lord coming,
[1:40:39] Peter knew what it was like to walk on
[1:40:40] the supernatural.
[1:40:43] And it was Peter that had his eyes on
[1:40:46] Christ and he got out there and he
[1:40:48] walked in the middle of the
[1:40:48] supernatural.
[1:40:50] You don't even realize sometimes you're
[1:40:52] just walking in some of the greatest
[1:40:53] supernatural moments.
[1:40:56] You know, I I I love Peter's story
[1:40:59] because as long as Peter was focused,
[1:41:03] as long as Peter kept his eyes on Jesus,
[1:41:06] he stayed walking on the water. When he
[1:41:08] started looking at this and he started
[1:41:10] looking at that, he
[1:41:11] started to sink.
[1:41:13] Jesus stayed right there.
[1:41:17] He stayed right there. He didn't move.
[1:41:20] He didn't move. He didn't move.
[1:41:24] A lot of times that's where we are.
[1:41:25] We're walking right in the middle of the
[1:41:27] supernatural.
[1:41:29] Sometimes you don't even realize you're
[1:41:30] walking in the greatest miracle that
[1:41:31] you're ever walking. And all of a sudden
[1:41:33] then distractions come.
[1:41:36] You watch when every time brother
[1:41:37] Brandon comes to a a prayer line and the
[1:41:39] supernatural is taking place. You watch
[1:41:41] him start talking. He say, "You see them
[1:41:42] lines moving right there? They're
[1:41:44] calling for one another." What was it?
[1:41:46] It was those demons trying to call and
[1:41:50] distract from the miracle happening.
[1:41:54] And I love Peter's story
[1:41:56] because when he got his eyes back on the
[1:41:58] Lord, he started walking in the
[1:42:00] supernatural again.
[1:42:02] And I say that if you can stay focused
[1:42:04] on this message, it's not that we're not
[1:42:06] focused. It's not that Brother Brandham
[1:42:08] wasn't sincere, but the angel said, "You
[1:42:10] got to be more sincere." It's not that
[1:42:12] we don't we're not focused people.
[1:42:14] There's so many distractions to take our
[1:42:16] mind
[1:42:18] off of this message. I say if you get
[1:42:20] your eyes on the Lord, you keep your
[1:42:22] vision right on the Lord and you'll walk
[1:42:25] right back in the supernatural again
[1:42:27] because it's going to take a
[1:42:28] supernatural for a body change. Let's
[1:42:30] sing that one more time. It won't be
[1:42:32] long. Oh,
[1:42:34] it won't
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:45] And we believe
[1:42:49] in
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:55] it won't be
[1:43:05] and we'll be going
[1:43:08] home.
[1:43:11] It won't be long.
[1:43:16] It won't be hard.
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:37] It won't be long
[1:43:47] and soon we go
[1:43:50] home. Count the wind.
[1:43:58] Count
[1:44:00] as much
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:08] and count the months as we
[1:44:19] count the week last day
[1:44:24] any day.
[1:44:29] It will be going
[1:44:33] home.
[1:44:34] Oh, count me.
[1:44:40] and countries
[1:44:42] as one
[1:44:50] and count the
[1:44:54] free.
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:12] We know we love
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:21] People
[1:45:25] say that our God
[1:45:28] [Music]
[1:45:30] has no power or might.
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:36] They deny that he's living.
[1:45:42] Think this baby
[1:45:44] alive.
[1:45:48] We can help that they say these
[1:45:53] for they do not understand.
[1:45:59] They just want to reason.
[1:46:05] Say Jesus was just a man.
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:11] Oh, what about the truth?
[1:46:18] What about the life?
[1:46:24] What about the messy?

[1:47:04] for God's voice in this day.
[1:47:11] Don't need to reason.

[1:47:16] Oh, the world's filthy way.

[1:47:22] See, we have a vision
[1:47:28] and no power can hold us back.

[1:47:40] and he'll keep you on track.
[1:47:46] Oh, what about the truth?
[1:47:52] Oh, what about the lie?
[1:47:58] Oh, what about me?
[1:48:05] Is it still alive?
[1:48:10] Oh, just look upon his good name
[1:48:15] that he's done in your life.
[1:48:22] Oh, it's not just some story.

[1:48:45] Oh, and this is still the message.
[1:48:52] And yes, he is alive.
[1:48:57] Oh, just think upon the good
[1:49:01] things
[1:49:03] that he's done in your life.
[1:49:09] Oh, it's not just so
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:18] verse to begin.
[1:49:21] There's no purpose in leaving.
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:27] Oh, God's voice in this day.
[1:49:33] Won't only mean to reason.
