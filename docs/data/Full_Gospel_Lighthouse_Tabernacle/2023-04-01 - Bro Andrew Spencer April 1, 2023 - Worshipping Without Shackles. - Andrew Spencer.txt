Minister unto us according to your your power and your will exactly how you want and and I just want to make a few statements and musicians if you can stay just for a moment and uh but we as you heard through the prayer request we want to be remembering our brother George Quinn his lovely wife passed away this past week there and I know that she'd been going through some things of life and and uh we're we're very appreciative that God gives us an escape out of this world and brother Quinn has been a friend he has been a brother in Christ to each and every one of us and but we know him as King George and uh he's a king amongst men and and if you've never got the opportunity to be around brother Quinn I'd say that you've missed out in life because brother Quinn is is such a gentleman and he's a man that I we grew up as a Spencer family he was in our home he was he worked with us he's just he's been he's just been a real friend to us even through the past three years the friendship that brother Quinn has had with us throughout throughout our life it just grew even richer throughout the past three years so we want to be remembering him also uh brother Aaron Oglesby his his father passed away which it was uh it was expected but yet even then it's it's still hard losing your father I spoke with brother Aaron several times this week and before brother brother Aaron had had spoke with him the last time he was speaking with him was Monday and maybe one other time on Wednesday but brother Aaron was due to preach at brother Donnie Reagan's a youth service this weekend and the last time brother Ross was able to speak he told him he said whatever you do don't cancel your trip you see those young people mattered in that Eternal realm there's no such thing as death you don't even think about those things you're thinking about the Eternal things so we we certainly appreciate a hero of Faith like that can see the value in the service and so we just want to be remembering the Oglesby family there so we just asked the Lord would Minister to them I also want to make mention to you that Louisiana Camp would be this coming week and many of the church here I think there's around 30 35 will be headed down there to to brother Pruitt's Easter Camp there and so we'll just ask that the Lord would would just be in it all and young people you you just take care of all the things that you need to take care of and and make sure to bring a rain jacket and an umbrella of the weather looks like that but I believe there's going to be some Holy Ghost reign as well so so I ask you to be Mentor remembering brother Ron brother Donnie and myself in prayer will be ministering there this this week Lord willing also next weekend brother William and brother Matthew will be speaking here for you next weekend so I know that they will appreciate your prayers and in remembering them I know that the Lord's been dealing with them upon some thoughts and so we just asked that the Lord would get in it and just maybe we had just a wonderful time in the Lord and so how many he's come expecting here tonight hey man it's so good to have our friends from Brother Wayne Lawson's there in Ohio we just want to say God Rich so bless you thank you for being here Hunter it's it's always a joy to see you and just want to say God bless you and hey man it's good to have you here all of our visitors we welcome you tonight and in the presence of the Lord and if you're if this is your first time here we just say God richly bless you we love the Lord of all our heart here he means everything to us and I tell you I tell you this message is our life here and I don't know anything else but this message but I know that the message works so so we just greet you tonight in the name of the Lord and say just come on in with us tonight and I spoke some of these things while I was there in in Oklahoma and I would like to labor on some of these slots again tonight and and musicians you can you can be seated now so thank you for thank you for staying there um but we we labored on some of these thoughts and tonight I'd like to just just gather some inspiration the Lord and giving us some fresh inspiration upon these thoughts and while I was while I was there in Oklahoma the Lord had had dealt with me to specifically speak upon a thought there for that meeting on worship worship Warriors worship Warriors and and if you're you've been around for a little bit of time and you know that that statement comes from our pastor talking about worship Warriors and and song leaders that that would do war and worship and and I just felt very directed to take some things upon that line of thought in the Lord certainly got behind it and even even there were multiple counts throughout the weekend where the the spirit of the Lord was seen in a Milky presence a heavy milky presence and and the Lord got behind it and it was a real blessing but I'd like to just gather some of those those things and I'd like to speak to you tonight on worshiping without shackles worshiping without shackles and man if you have your Bibles tonight we'd like to look in the book of Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 Joshua chapter 5 and then also John chapter 4 verse 23 amen amen we certainly love the word of the Lord it means it means so much to us in this hour when men try to do away with the word of God it is our refuge and it is our place of rest and we find the great hope in this hour in the word of God is that right amen amen let's let's just speak to the author of the word before we dive into the message tonight Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord we humble our hearts before you Lord Jesus and we recognize the Lord that your presence is here Lord I personally have watched and watched how you got into the songs Tonight Lord Jesus to line up my thoughts Lord Jesus to to just set a course father for these for these Services here tonight Lord and I pray father that you would just come Lord I know that your word is real and I know it is preeminent father but I pray that sonidas as we as your humble children we yield ourselves over to the power of the Holy Ghost and we invite you father to speak from Heaven father to our hearts Lord Jesus we remember the Quinn family the Oglesby family and the other needs Lord that are presented here we ask father that your Holy Spirit would come tonight and you would just just get into the word father and let us get aside let's inside every thought and every fear and every little anxious feeling that we might feel in the room but father I pray Lord as we would labor in these thoughts tonight that your Holy Spirit would would get into it father and that you would just grab it father and take it to a a higher place than what we could even expect for you to take it Lord we are looking unto you you are the author and the finisher of our faith father we know God that you're going to do something special father here tonight Lord even things in my study today Lord that that you begin to reveal to me I just look unto you Lord tonight and as father Lord like those like those men that came to see you that we would see you father and that that we'd not be mistaken or if we would not be misled by looking at the veil but let us see you father open-facedly Lord not through a glass Darkly but let us see you father Lord we commit all of these things unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and man Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places Joshua chapter 5 and verse 13 and while you're turning there we want to thank the Lord that he was he was with sister Faith in the school there at Shenandoah Elementary this past week and and I know that that's a very scary situation the world is on edge right now from the the constant Wows of the devil that are roaring and that's why we plead the blood of Jesus Christ across this congregation we speak Psalms 91 every morning over this congregation and I know we live in a scary world but we have a great big God that that knows how to wrap his arms around his children amen Joshua chapter 5 and verse 13 and it came to pass that when Joshua was about miracle that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword at drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as a captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua notice that Joshua fell on his face to the Earth notice where he was he was by Jericho he was looking at the problem that was in front of him but notice immediately that his Focus changes from what he was looking at Jericho and now he is worshiping the host of the Lord and the Bible said and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship him and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou standest is Holy and catch these four words and Joshua did so and Joshua did so John chapter 4 and verse 23 while you're turning there we many times we read over the scriptures and we read over The Very word of God and sometimes we we miss the very key elements of it the reason why Joshua was doing these things was exactly because the word was telling him to do these things the reason why we should be doing anything in this life is because the word of the Lord has told us to do so I believe that if we pray we ought to do it by the word of God I believe that if we speak we ought to do it by the word of God and I believe that if we worship we ought to worship by the word of God John chapter 4 and verse 23 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers I say that together the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord and brother Brandon said here in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said I like to worship don't you now we don't come to church just to hear a sermon that goes with it he said but we come to church to worship Worship in the spirit and in truth you've heard the truth that's the word he said but now to worship is to express yourself to Him worship is to express yourself to him and to think about these thoughts that tonight that that worship without shackles to worship without shackles and I think about all of the songs that we're saying tonight that fear was a liar and and I think it's something amazing that is laying there there isn't any rock that is going to stand or sing in my placement and tonight to realize that we are serving we are serving in a very amazing God who is who is always faithful in our trials in our troubles in our victories in our good times and in our bad times our God is faithful and he knows how to speak to us according to his word and in our current life crisis that we're at he knows how to drop a word in due season for where we are living at it God reveals himself in truth and so that he may be worshiped in truth he reveals himself in truth so that he can be worshiped in truth you see God has not revealed himself in falsehood because we are not worshiping in falsehood we are worshiping him in the truth and I believe it's an amazing thing tonight that that even right here while the word of God is being being released that that our worship is going to a place that no man could take us to that to realize that that even while you're sitting there in your seats and you begin to amen the word of God and you begin to feel the very cool presence of the Holy Ghost maybe move across you and maybe touch you in a different way what is it our God is a very danger a tangible God and he wants to be touched he wants to be felt he wants to be handled and some of the greatest Miracles that I've ever seen is when you are worshiping God and I know that there there's a lot a lot of people that maybe understand what I say right here but the time to worship Him is not necessarily when the music is going on it's right now while the word of God is going forth that is the greatest time to worship him because you see what magnifies our worship when the music gets in it is because our a man has been caught up with the word of God that takes us as I said if we're going to do anything we ought to do it by the word of God I believe that if we're going to a man the word of God then we ought to be able to recognize why we're saying Amen to the word of God and when we begin to say so be it over that word that was dropped you recognize that it is taking you from the natural realm that's what worship does it takes you from the things that you see to the things that God's wanting to manifest in your life and I think it's an amazing thing tonight that we can worship him without shackles upon our life now brother man I would preach a message many times from Jeremiah where he would read that is there no bomb in Gilead and Jeremiah 8 and 22 the Bible said that is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there then why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered and you see what God was saying I've got I've got I've got the healing right here I've got a bomb for her then why is she not recovered and brother Brandon would preach from that thought of why or or there's bomb there in Gilead but notice what brother Bynum says here in 1962 in the message why he said I challenge every person in here to believe that inoculation I challenge every person in here to believe that inoculation he said Do you believe it all of you believed it then stand upon your feet and receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ amen he said that's right amen now notice he speaks to a lady that's in a wheelchair he said take your chair and push it on home there she is up out of the chair for the kingdom of God do you believe it Glory now don't you see that he's here the inoculation the bomb is here glory to God believe it friends don't you be afraid to trust him Hallelujah where's your faith he said now you feel different don't you say sir you take your own wheelchair now and go home and be well don't you doubt don't you doubt he said just keep the same faith that you got if you've got enough you know a woman touched His Garment well you did the same thing then go ahead and believe it he said you keep the same faith that you got the faith that got you out of your sickness is a faith that'll keep you out of your sickness you keep the same faith that you got that got you out of your sickness got you out of the wheelchair got you out of the things that held you bound that same faith will keep you tonight that that the Church of the Living God is not believing in a dead God she's not worshiping a dead God but she is worshiping a God who is very much alive Can Be Touched by the feeling of our infirmities I want you to I want you to gather this tonight in your thought that while the very word of God Goes Forth that there is a one that is walking the aisles Where You Are notice and I've been reflecting upon these things I've been reflecting up over these needs of our local assembly and I believe that that if there's anything that we want to see we want to see the healing of our pastor I've been I've been reflecting over these things they've been very heavy on my heart and just thinking over the needs of our local assembly of our of our precious brother uh brother Donnie Nicholson and our sister Ruth Ann and and sister Betty and brother Randy and brother Bill and sister Linda little Zoe and all of these local needs and I just been so burdened to see to see the our lord Jesus come and rise with healing in his wings and sweep over us in a Rapture and completely make all of us whole at once I believe that it's something that the Church of the Living God should be expecting I don't believe it's something that we should lay off and into the future of thinking of things well why aren't we have any because we recognize there is a bomb here we recognize there is a power here we recognize there is an anointing here and I believe I believe that if we're going to do anything then we ought to believe in the god of the Bible I believe if we can spend our time on frivolous things of the world of looking at nature and looking at money and looking at the things of sports world and I think if we can look at things of the nature want to buy different things then we ought to be able to look into the true word of God I believe if the world can go out there and they can have their exhibitions then the Church of the Living God ought to be able to celebrate the victory of our Lord Jesus Christ why shouldn't we have this come on somebody I lie I'll give a million dollars to anybody that can stand up to me tonight and tell me why we can't have it if the word of God has sowed has told us so we can have it then we ought to be able to worship like we got it I don't believe there should be any shackle upon our faith I don't believe there should be any Shackle in our worship I don't believe there should be any shackle on our belief but I believe that with everything that's within me that the Church of the Living God ought to be able to believe like it's so that we ought to be able to worship like it's so that we ought to be able to praise like it's already over let me tell you God is with this church and he is not going to leave her shouldn't be in panic when you are in the midst of your crisis you shouldn't be in the midst of stress when you are in the midst of your crisis I was called to a certain case the other day and it immediately it raised a panic on the inside of me said get here right now and I took off and I was in a panic begin to flutter my heart and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord dropped upon my heart and said settle down I'm already there before I could ever get to the place where the case was the angel was already there I shouldn't be nervous I shouldn't be shook up because the angel is already where I need to be at even when you don't see him he's working even when you don't feel him he's working I don't know what's going on up here but it seems like it's very distant but even when I don't see him even when I don't feel him he's already there just settle down about it breathe a little bit let it go rest in it I'm already there he's already in your trouble he's already in your midst of your crisis I'm there it depends on what you're looking at you see if you're only looking at the problem that's all you're going to see but if you're looking at the promise can't see any problem because of the promise well I've got bad news for cancer I've got bad news for sugar diabetes I got bad news for liver problems I got bad news for kidney problems the promise of God is so big that I can't even see the problem come on somebody the promises of God have so have enveloped the Bride of Jesus Christ that we shouldn't be Shook Up when Moses sent out the 12 Spies what was it 10 of them went over there and they brought up an evil report but there was two that helped that were thoroughbreds they knew where they had been born at and they were not looking at what they seen they were looking at what Abraham had told them because Abraham was fellowshipping with one that had the abilities to change his bodies and change the molecular pattern in his body and to make him an old man and turn him into a new man so Caleb and Joshua were birthed under the same commission and they were not looking at those giants over there even though they've seen him over there they've seen them over there they seen them wall cities over there they seen them big old Giants over there but they were not concerned about what they were seeing they were simply birthed under the word you see because it matters where you're born at the reason why these two men Joshua and Caleb could stand there and have that tenacity and say we are more than able to take it was because they had a birth under a thoroughbred it could search it all the way back that the faith that they had was not in vain the faith that they had received was not some man-made man man-made thought or man-made intellectualism but God had dropped something on the inside of Joshua and Caleb that even though the problem was in front of them they were raised for a purpose to take the children of God over and you have been put here to believe the very word of God even though you see problems even though you see troubles we are looking at a promise you're looking at a promise you see the word of God when the word of God has the preeminence in his body it doesn't matter what intellectual is saying it doesn't matter what reason says it doesn't matter what wisdom says because the word of God is having the preeminence in his body another man of sad in letting off the pressure he said are you believing now are you accepting now he said but he said he said do you believe that your faith has shook off or beat off every shackle of unbelief has it beat off every shackle of unbelief can you believe it that much that it's the very shackle of your understanding has been beat off that nothing hinders you there's not one thing in your way but do you believe that you're free you believe that although unbelief has gone from you you believe that you're now in Haven of Rest You Believe will I be healed can I be healed you're already healed what does the word of God do it loosens your mind to accept the promises as yes and amen the word of God will never put the promises of God in days gone by but what the word of God with aligned with faith for this hour it will raise the believer's expectation to say that he's the same yesterday today and forever and if I tell you if there's one thing that the Church of the Living God ought to do they ought to lift him up out of history and say he's not just a god of our past he's not just the god of the days gone by he's the god of my future he's the god of my presence I think if there's any day that we ought to lift him up out of History we gotta lift him up if he healed Georgie Carter he can do it right now if he healed a little blind girl in Memphis he can do it right now [Applause] come on somebody what's the word do it breaks the band of the enemy that's put a band upon your life oh come on now you know good and well you can't worship with a shackle on your face something that's holding you back you can't worship the way God built you to worship sitting there in your unbelief saying well it ain't just going to happen for me it's for the people up front it ain't for me back there in the back if you believe that get up here where they're sitting at you ought to sit here tonight let every shackle let every shackle come off of your faith and why don't you let the promises of God as the chains are falling worship the God that I take you to another world I tell you what is good to be home God's gonna get my praise God's gonna give my praise devil get out of my way cause God's gonna give my praise [Applause] he knows what he's doing he's in control of his word you didn't move here just to move here just to say you went around Spencer's Church the angel brought you here and the angel brought you here will take you you let the critics say what they're going to say you let criticism say what it's going to say the angel is in control of the word and he knows where to deposit it so that it'll come out exactly what he asked for when you got that kind of Faith you're going to throw yourself liable for criticism but if you're like Mary the baby the mother of Jesus if you're like her you don't care what the critics say you throw yourself alive before criticism when you believe the Angel that's talking to you it's unseemable it's inconceivable but the angel said that I'm going to bring forth a child the angel said that there's going to be a perfect harmony that she would have the mind of Christ she would act in his name she would speak in his name the angel told her that you're going to call his name Jesus and when the angel told us to pick up the pen and write this is the only kind that the word can bring forth because she's in perfect harmony with the one that broke every shackle now come on you know I'm preaching you the message every shackle of every denomination has been struck off the Church of the Living God every little doubt every little fear of wondering will it be has been struck off the Church of the Living God and every devil in hell has been trying to keep you from this throughout all your life he said six thousand years to work upon your family and work on their DNA but you see you see God is as good as his word and the same thing that has been deposited in the gene seed of God is the very life of the father and if you've got his life there ain't no shackle gonna hold you back come on somebody God ain't looking at your failures God ain't looking at what you used to be if he was that kind of a god he'd have gave up on Samson when Samson was down there living in a harlot's house doing all kinds of sin but he wasn't looking at Sampson sin he was looking at that Nazarite Covenant you see what God is looking upon you sisters today he's looking upon that Covenant and you might feel like you failed you might feel like God's gave up on you but God ain't looking at you he ain't looking at your flesh he ain't looking at what you're going through he is looking at his blood-bound promises [Applause] get your eyes off the things of the world and get your eyes on Jesus come on now he's that kind of a God he knows how to go into the room because prayer was made you out of your prison cell of unbelief I believe his same Angels right here tonight the Bible said that there was prayer made up there in John Mark's house and they were up there praying for Peter that was locked up in the prison down there and the Bible said that the Angels slipped through the window and went in there and took the shackles off of Peter and said now it's time you get up what did the angel do he woke him up and told him to stand up and start walking that's what the angel was doing right now he's tapping you on your shoulder said Johnny Crow it's already been took off for you laughs go ahead walk on out but I want you to notice the prayer directed The Angel to Peter he didn't direct him to everybody else down there in the prison house the prayer directed The Angel to where Peter was and there has been prayer on top of prayer on top of prayer that is directing an angel Hallelujah he's directing the Angel by your way I said well come on now let's enjoy our freedom if he let me out then let me worship him like I'm loose [Applause] whatever Devil's trying to keep you from this random said an expectation he said when those little shackles and Dark Shadows get broke away then the Holy Spirit can come right in four miracles when those little shackles them little shackles and them Dark Shadows when they get broke away then the Holy Spirit can come right in and perform Miracles he said there's nothing impossible with it then how many here I mean here has a need in their body I know there's a few sisters that are here that are asking for a child I know there's a few brothers that are here that are asking for complete healing I know that there's a few needs that are here tonight that are asking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I I know these things and now I'm telling you something that you don't know you're very aware of it but if the shackles and the Dark Shadows can roll away then the Lord foreign who owns it all who's got control of the atmosphere he's got control of the universe when them things get pulled away then Papa God that owns everything that owns a cattle in a thousand hills where you say my business seems like it's been shook get out of the way devil when God decides to bless there ain't no devil that can hold back the blessings of almighty God you see well I'm asking for a child how many do you want be specific [Applause] say I need a good job be specific every shackles broke off ain't nothing impossible to the Church of the Living God where all things are believed as yes [Applause] what are you going to do brother Andrew I'm going to believe no matter what I see every Giant's got a rock with his name on it come on cancer I got a rock for you come on sugar I got a rock for you come on depression I gotta Rock for you his name's Jesus he's never lost in battle he's never been defeated foreign [Music] there's only one place to worship he said worship only in the place that I choose to put my name he said there's a lot of gates out there but don't you worship out there but only in the place that I choose to put my name and William Randolph said he said now there's a lot of fine sisters out there and find women out there he said but there's only one Mrs Branham he said there's only one he said I'm sure you're all fine sisters and I know that maybe you got the best cook you gotta you got a good cooker you got a good wife back there he said but there's only one that goes home with me and there's only one that's going home with Father God there's a lot of fine churches out there but there's only one mistress Jesus Christ he said that's who he's coming for that's where his name Lays if you could recognize what I'm saying to you right now that's where his name lays that is where his worship is it's in her and her alone that is true oh yes we find that to be true a lot of people look like they're worshiping but there's only one place you are God's provided place of worship he said well that's a little bit out there William random said that she is him the father dwelleth in secret and in truth it's in this body there ain't nobody that can worship like God father there's nobody that can speak to me like my father and if he speaks every devil every devil let me tell you he's walking on the water in the eye of your storm he is walking on the water now you remember what brother Brandon was there and he preaches Christ The Mystery of God revealed and he comes all the way down there in paragraph 6 37 he's standing there and brother Baron starts singing Take the name of Jesus Christ with you always he's singing that song Precious name oh how sweet and he said now you that are spiritual you that are spiritual he said look back there at that clock he said it's at two o'clock on the dot he said look back there he said what is it he said it's the ending it's the ending of the second poll he said it's showing that the third poll is at hand and brother random goes back to singing he goes back to singing Take the name of Jesus Christ with you he said but oh he said and then he stops he said did you notice how the spirit got in that same song and took it a higher octave what did it the spirit didn't change the word he just shake took it up a little bit higher right he didn't change a word when the between the transition of the second pool to the third pole he only took our faith a little bit higher oh man I I don't know if I got enough glue in my body to hold me together tonight but God has built us to go a little bit higher to go a little bit further the next point is a hand what was it it was the token life of Jesus Christ Living on the inside of the body taking this word manifested for this hour a little bit higher John Wesley couldn't go where you're going Luther couldn't go where you're going it costs couldn't go where you're going you are under an ego anointing they call that lambano which holds the milk the body together the glue that holds the body together is called lembano it's a sale that looks exactly like a cross that holds your body together it's called the glue of the body I'm glad the cross is holding me together tonight you say because because we are not under of days gone by Ministry I'm afraid that too many people around the ranks of the message have sat there and said oh if William Branham was here then I could go to him and ask him I never was I never was sitting there and here heard brother Branham speak my name I didn't hear my name on tape there's some Spencers on there but he didn't call my name I wasn't sitting there even in the very first stage it was so close that it would deceive the very elect theologians even William Branham preached it in 1954 throughout his ministry until the angel met him a player and broke a sound barrier and took him to look into the open Word and see that that was not our Lord on that white horse he said he said that it was the Antichrist Spirit he said it was so close he said but if you'll notice that Antichrist rider was riding he had a bowl but he didn't have no arrows so everything that he is just doing he's flapping that old bow and it sounds like banjo music to you but you recognize he ain't got no power simply nothing but a bluff but what happened the trail of the serpent was working through that age the Antichrist was working through that age trying to stop all the belief of believing in the power that was released but that's why when the very power of Satan Begin to Fall that God raised up a standard what was it what was it every single time you watched that Antichrist ride out God sends out his power to combat the spirit of hell that was released notice what was it in the very first age he released the lion anointing what was it it was the lion of the tribe of Judah in the form of the Lion of the word of God that's why they had miracles in that day that's why they had that's why they had healings and miracles and visions and power is because it was a lion the very word of God made manifest he said you see the Antichrist sent out his power but God sent out his word so what was it it was the word that conquered the enemy in that day but now notice hold that word has been laying here for two thousand years waiting for your arrival he was looking over the seeds that he had deposited and the Lord knows exactly where they are laying at but I want you to know that even though you can look back there you can look in Paul's day you could see the lion anointing as he would go out and it would thwart the very power of hell but God did not leave us here in this earth or in this age like a little wimpy little child he did not leave us down here like a little bitty kitten but he has left us here under the ego anointing to restore our faith back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers that's exactly what the ministry of Malachi 4 was to do was to return or restore our hearts back to the faith that was deposited in the first generation and Paul would say Paul would say over in the New Testament that when that is turned towards the Lord the veil would be taken off and after Paul says that he said now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there is no liberty in a Creed there is no liberty in the denomination because you see ever since the seals were released we recognize that the Church of the Living God had been bound by those demons for two thousand years but when the seals were released two hundred thousand thousand demons were released but you and I are not really rejoicing and worshiping in a hidden truth but we are rejoicing from a heart that has been restored and we are rejoicing in the unveiling of the word of God what did this Eagle anointing do it flew over every one of those Creeds that had completely destroyed the very power of the word what did it do it flew over top of those Creeds and it tied all of those loose ends up you see healing was taken from the Church of the Living God but the anointing of Christ tied it back together so that you could believe that the days of Miracles are not gone but they're here where the spirit of the enemy come in and he separated the power of looking into the word of God and seeing that it wasn't sex back there in the garden he was serpent seed or not looking in their Scene It was fruit but you've seen it was sex what was it it was the anointing of that day that that naviste that tied it back together so that you can clearly see why we needed a virgin-born son of God all of those things that had been torn off of eternal security of looking in there and seeing water baptism William random said water baptism don't even need a revelation but because men had misconstrued the very word of God they took in there and put in the names of titles and took away the power of baptism if you are going to be baptized you want to be buried you don't want to be sprinkled and you don't want to be covered by just three pieces of dirt you want to be covered by a name that's got a resurrection power in it but what was it the anointing of this day come flying over top of those words that had been bound up that had been tied and so they kept away from the Church of the Living God the anointing of Malachi 4 returned our faith things where we couldn't get to the power things where we couldn't get to the truth they had been blocked off but the blood of Jesus Christ took us over not into the world of Creeds and dogmas where things are still bound up there and you can't see it true but now you are here under the opening of the word what is it this is the liberation of the power of almighty God that has returned our hearts back to true worship and worship is only due to him to him I hope I dropped too too much heavy stuff on you but I believe that you're the church that can receive these things you follow me okay tonight you're that people you're that group that William Branham saw over there where the bride had come into preview and then the church walked out and he said oh God have I worked all my life to present to you a church like that but a voice Came From Another World and said but the bride will come in to preview again what was it the same one that was there in the beginning is the same word that is here in the evening time what is it it's a time to arise and shine that even though we're in an hour of Darkness but notice Isaiah's proclamation in Isaiah chapter 60 arise and shine even in chaotic times the word has brought you back under your freedoms they were Satan tried to rob you from the power and Rob you from your victory can I get down to the bare Knuckles he tried to Rob your family out of your life he tried to rob the very strength and the Very joy out of your family and try to take everything from you but this word is about restoring if your joy has been taken from you God's going to restore it if your health has been taken from you God is going to restore it if the devil has robbed from you God is the kind of Banker that he puts more in your bank account than when Satan robs from you if there's anybody if there's anybody that ought to be able to worship Him it's you let me tell you what real worship is real worship don't care how hot it is in church and how cold it is in church real worship don't care what kind of chair you're sitting on real worship don't care what you see about the people that are sitting around you real worship don't care about the necessities of life real worship don't care if you're sitting on a pine bench it don't care if you're sitting there and you're seeking your body real worship doesn't matter about what you see or by what you feel real worship comes from the heart and it's their new to the father himself I tell you what real worship does real worship will make you look past yourself and look to the Future to what God has said about you real worship don't care where you're sitting at in your physical life or in your spiritual life real worship will take you past that you're special people you know how to yield you know how to give over to the Holy Ghost it's amazing thing you know good and well that when you get comfortable you know what I'm talking about brother Jeffrey when you get comfortable and there's certain people that you're more comfortable with than than maybe certain others and you get good and comfortable and you don't care what everybody else is thinking about you they don't real worship doesn't care doesn't care who's sitting around and who's looking at you because when you get good and comfortable you really don't care how you act there are friends and then there are friends you know what I'm talking about ain't everybody the kind of people that you just let your hair down and act any way you want to are you with me now but when you get comfortable in your skin as a son and daughter of God you can worship him like the way he wants you to now I want you to think about it like this but when God gets comfortable in your skin when God gets good and comfortable where you're living at and he knows that you're right and he knows you got faith and he knows you got the blood on your altar and he knows you got real worship and he knows you got real faith in it knows you don't care what everybody else says but when God gets so comfortable I can put my anointing on them they don't care if they slobber they don't care if they scream they don't care if they dance they don't care if they shout real worship comes from the heart of a worshiper that worships God it's spirit and in truth whether they got music whether there's hand clappings whether there's an atmosphere they are going to create an atmosphere you are worshipers [Music] and I believe that if you know you got the victory you can worship him all day long all night long worshiping him in Good Times worship Him in bad times [Applause] what did Moses tell them and prophesy of them in Exodus chapter 14 that the enemies that you see today you're going to see them no longer and when they got over there in Exodus chapter 15 The Bible said that Moses sang a song it was not a song of defeat it was not a song of them that had been conquered but it was the song of victory Exodus 15 says then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and speak saying I I will sing unto the Lord for he have triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider have to be thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and my song he has become my salvation he is my God I will prepare him a habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts have be cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned into the Red Sea The Depths I've covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone thy right hand O Lord is become glorious in power thy right hand O Lord hath dashed the pieces of the enemy in the greatness of thine Excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sendeth forth I wrath which consume them as stubborn what was Moses looking at he was singing this song because the experience he just had come on it's a dry it's one of those moments where you can drop the mic right here and walk off in this song because of a victory that he just had he was not singing unto them we're still bound we're still facing Pharaoh's armies he was saying God has thrown our Devils has thrown our enemies into the Red Sea you think I'm crazy you take 600 000 women grabbing themselves a tambourine having themselves a victory party [Applause] what was it they were looking at the victory you know that the Bible tells us in Revelation chapter 15 that they sang that song of Moses that they looked over there and they had gotten a victory over the image of the Beast and the image of it and all of its powers and they sang the song of Moses and of the Lamb come on now you see what they were doing they were singing and if you hear some singing it means there's something going on you remember when Paul Rader was nine and they came in there and sang them slow songs he said hey who's dying in here me or you he said sing me some of them old gospels snap his songs let me tell you a Christian can't die because every Satan every Kingdom of Satan has been torn down death has been torn down hell has been torn down the Grave's been torn down he don't even have the keys to his own house so how can he try to trick you into believe that you're still bound when the father's already got the keys in his hands and said get out of it when you hear singing when we come back from the wars in v-day brother Bynum tells us he tells us he said when we come back from Wars he said you were hearing cheers of Victory they were singing songs of victory in the street when David had slain the Goliath over there the giant that had been swearing that he was going to destroy the armies of the Living God they came back and there was singing in the streets that Saul hath killed his thousands but David his tens of thousands what was it it was a sign of Victory and David had so much victory that he led the rest of the Church of the Living God right on over there into complete Victory our Lord Jesus Christ when you look up there on Easter morning 2 000 years ago we don't see him as defeated we don't see him you might look at him on the cross on Friday but you give him till Sunday and he'll show you who's a real Victor devil I want you to have yourself a good dancing party while you can because when my Lord gets up on Sunday everything that you thought you had has been stole away from you give me my joy back give me my praise back give me my worship back give me my health back it's Sunday it's son day again the sun has risen on the church [Applause] I feel good come on let's tear down every wall let's tell down every critic let's tear down every devil that says we can't have it [Applause] sister Francis he told me I can have it so I can act like I got it even when I don't see it coming it's already coming even when I don't feel it working I know it's working even when I don't see him I know he's here well I can go ahead and rejoice about it the victories in the room my healing's in the room your baby's in the room your deliverance is in the room well go ahead and rejoice you might as well [Applause] you're not bound down [Music] [Applause] devil get out our way we're free sin has been conquered every devil is defeated I know what I'm talking about because I'm not looking at a sealed tomb I'm looking at an empty tomb the rest of the world their gods are still laying there in their bag of bones but our Lord Jesus Christ gave us a sign Eternal sign that everything that was struck against the Church of the Living God when he took those stripes and he opened up the grave everything has been taken off and when the disciples came up there and they would come up there on Easter morning in Luke chapter 24 and they come up there to bring spices to anoint his body because they knew that something was about to set in you know what I'm talking about corruption was about to set in and they knew that if he stayed in that condition that it was going to start smelling but Jesus was so much God he couldn't even have stink on him foreign come on now he was so much God that corruption had met its Master when it met our Lord Jesus Christ death was starting it looked like death was going to start working in his members and start working in his body but God said oh no there's a prophecy laying over there in Psalms chapter 16 that not even corruption thou shall destroy this body and when those disciples went up when I put packing their packing their spices up there they looked and the stone was rolled away Stoners rolled away and there was standing Two Men and bright bright garments and they said why seek ye the living amongst the dead he ain't here let me tell you if you're looking for a live thing you better not go to a graveyard but he is telling you he ain't here the one that is the very author of Life the one that only knows how to give life the one that knows how to give life give hope give joy Give Peace give Deliverance he ain't into this whole dead place he's not in this tune he can't even smell like that he is not a part he's not a part of this dead religions of the world today that want to keep him back there bound up in the Yokes but I believe that there's some heartfelt religion around here they're in him dead creatures he ain't there he ain't there in your dead worship I'll tell you what William Branham said anything dead needs burying how can you bury Jesus when he is the very author of life what did the angel say he was here but he ain't here no more he was in the lutherans too thou he wasn't a Lutheran three ages ago he was in the West Winds two ages ago but he ain't there now he's risen why are you seeking the author of Life out there in the rest of the world why are you seeking him out in drugs why are you seeking him in pornography why are you seeking him down there in a prison house he ain't there he's alive come on now he's alive I'll tell you how much alive it was that when Jesus got done with where he was laying at he folded up his Linens and put him back there because he was not associated with that spot no more he wasn't there I don't know if y'all hear me talking to you tonight but I believe I'm talking to you tonight he ain't there you can throw them old Creeds you can throw them old dogs in the back hair cause he ain't in them things he ain't in them tombs this is not a dead religion this is not a dead God this is a God who is alive he's so much alive when they brought Lazarus forth from the grave he said Jesus said take the grave close off of him but when you see Jesus again there wasn't no such thing as the grave clothes on him he was so much God he was so much God that he could speak Lazarus come forth he was so much God that when they got over there in Luke chapter 24 and he began to open to them their understanding all the way down the road of Emmaus and they said did not our hearts burn within us has he talked to us along the way and he gets over there in John Luke chapter 24 and verse 44 and it begins to speak to them that's what I love about this he's talked to them and he's seven miles in a different spot but they ran all the way back to Jerusalem where the other disciples were and said hey we've seen him he's alive you mean to tell me that you're telling the same stories that all them other stories of them sisters said that he's alive let me tell you he's alive how you know he's alive I've seen him in real worship I've seen him in this Brethren I've seen him in this sister he showed himself a life he still knows how to take take grave clothes off come on if he could get ray McBride to get baptized and watch all him sins off of him I'll say it's good enough to get anybody in the building tonight [Applause] I ain't as bad as that yes you were you was thinking you was rotten and you was good for nothing but then Jesus came but the Bible said that when he got over there he was so much God he walked right through the building have you any meat here I'll tell you what they was eating they was eating Katie's kind of food they was eating broadfish and honeycomb Hallelujah even Jesus knows what's good for you bring to them their understanding [Laughter] he was doing everything and the Bible said and they remembered his words when he opened your understanding you know he's the one that's been talking to you Hallelujah he's so much God he's in your conversations he's so much God is in your mind he's so much God he's in your heart when you were there crying in the middle of the night he was there watching those tears fall on your pillow can I Outlast the night can I Outlast my struggles but they remembered his words what was it he took the shackles off of their understanding it was a rumor and he was God on the second day it was just a rumor but on the third day it was more than a rumor he said what are you doing brother Hendra I'm preaching to you my Easter message he's opened your understanding the message didn't add to and take away it opened our understanding this is where he wants to be worshiped at this is where he wants to be praised at this is where he's inviting you to he's not taking you to days gone by but he's taking you to a future home he's taking you to your he's taking you to your home it's in the sky this is where I'm at this is where I want to be worshiped at this is where life is at oh you shouldn't be acting like that brother Andrew You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet you think I'm enthused now and you think I'm excited now you wait it's what I music ain't got nothing to do with this absolutely it does foreign music is a part of worship he said praise him on a high selling symbol praise him on hello seven and symbol praise them on a string instrument Praise Him in No Hands Praise Him in the woods worship is what we do he gave you everything in life he gave you your health he gave you your strength he gave you your spouse there's a big thing if you say Amen to that he gave you everything in life but worship is the only thing that you have rights to give back to him you are an amateur God and when you begin to Echo out praise and you begin to Heckle out worship it takes you away brother Zach foreign worship makes you look past your own sin worship makes you look past your whole failures worship makes you look past your attitude has bitterness past Rebellion past hurts that's what worship does the prophet got so mad Elisha got so mad when they came up an army up there that was seeking seeking water they've been without water he was mad here comes up these these unknown Kings up there that had turned their back on God let me tell you Elisha was miffed he was upset when he has a moment in your life when you feel real human and you say some things and you regret them immediately but worship takes you past what you think the spirit of the Living God didn't even come upon Elijah until he asked for a menstrual and when the music began to play then the prophet saw a vision and you think that we shouldn't have worship and we shouldn't have music what is it it's taking us into a spot where the Prophet can have a vision and the word can speak and can lead us right into an atmosphere where we can have our water again he said well you don't you don't you don't belong down there you don't you don't belong and I'll tell you what this worship does worship will shake down every formal shackle and brother Branham said I'll tell you brother when we get all the informal shackle shook down and the spirit of God in the songs again and get back to a place where we can have the spirit of God moving into place then the prophet can see a vision then the powers of God can come in the church and he can show you this is where he's at this is where he wants to be worshiped at he didn't have anything to it to it he didn't take anything from him you just got to step into your Liberty God wants worshipers worshipers that worship him through the pain worship him through the fears worship him through all of the anxiousness of life in the complexes of life if they come out of my place let me tell you I'm not because I believe that if we're going to do anything we ought to do it by the word praise is what leads you into battle Judah means Praise And even though Leah looked like she was mocked all of her life she had three other Sons and Jacob didn't even look at her but Leah began to turn when she had her fourth son and said now will I praise the Lord and she called his name Judah and every single time that the children of Israel went into the battle they went in with worship going before them Judah was the banner that led the children of Israel into battle so God was showing us that if we're going to do war with Satan down here and Satan's Eden there has got to be some worship that leads you into battle you see what it was he looked like he was fourth but he was the very first you see even job when he was in his moment of Despair in Job chapter 1 and 20 that he ripped his robe and he worshiped the Lord what was David he was a true worshiper David's life was spent in caves David's life was spent on the backside of the desert back there dispel a sheep on him where he learned the heart of the worshiper what are you doing brother Andrew I'm telling you how to win this war if you're going to win and I believe you are then you're going to have to worship Judah you're going to have to lead into worship you're going to have to praise when it don't look like the walls are coming down you're going to have to praise it might seem like a paradox walking around this whole this Army of Jericho and these walls for 60 days but finally Joshua said we've been silent long enough why did the shout come what's because the word asked for it to come why did our praise come because the word asked for it to come you remember when jehoshaphat's up there when that when they when there was a multitude of ammonites that came up there in the mountain of Sierra and and the other and the moabites that came up there that the Bible said that that Jehoshaphat immediately went and seen the multitude he ran into the house of the Lord and he began to seek the Lord and Proclaim to fast throughout all the land you go read it in second Chronicles chapter 20 that he goes in there and he proclaims the fast through all of Israel and the spirit of the Lord comes down and says don't you fear and don't you be dismayed for the battle is not yours but it's God's I'm gonna tell you it's crazy this is crazy but this is how they won the war this ain't your battle brother Doug it's God's come on brother Charles this ain't your battle it's God's don't you worry don't you worry this is God's battle and when God goes to move in every devil better get out of the way and he said this is my battle you ain't even going to have to fight in this battle and the Bible said that Jehoshaphat set up singers and he set them up to sing to the beauty of his Holiness for his Mercy endures forever and the Bible said that when they begin to sing aloud and praise the Lord that the Lord sent out ambushments if you get to studying out that word it means to lie in wait that the Lord was lying and wait for all of them enemies if you go to studying a little bit deeper it said that the Lord said ambushments what was it it was a confusion their praise caused a confusion to come upon the enemies and the enemies turned around and destroyed themselves let me tell you when fear gets a fighting anxiety and depression gets a fighting suicide and you start singing your way through it's time to have yourself a dancing party the Lord is in your praise and your praise [Applause] come on somebody the Lord was their Warrior praise was their weapon but God was their victory what are you

Jehoshaphat and the children of God when they begin to worship they didn't lift up their sword they didn't lift up their Spears all they did sister Melissa was lift up their voice and all of them Devils turned on themselves and destroyed themselves and it took them three days to get all the spoils I'll tell you there's so much riches in your praise if you can praise your Devils will defeat if
