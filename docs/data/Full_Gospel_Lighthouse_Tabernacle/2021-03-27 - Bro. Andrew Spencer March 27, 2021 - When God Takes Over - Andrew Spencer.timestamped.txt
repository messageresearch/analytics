[30:10] i only care about your soul
[30:15] but even if the lord would say
[30:19] it's all okay

[31:07] for him
[31:11] and he's not a burden
[31:16] oh no

[31:35] i can't count for
[31:39] measure and with this simple sacrifice
[31:46] i give my life complete

[50:19] john chapter 5 and then also down to
[50:21] romans chapter 6.

[50:31] believeth
[50:32] that jesus is the christ
[50:36] is born of god what a powerful powerful
[50:40] scripture whosoever believeth that jesus
[50:44] is the christ the messiah the anointed
[50:47] one
[50:48] is born of god do you believe that he
[50:51] is jesus the christ
[50:55] that ought to identify yourself right
[50:56] there in that scripture
[50:58] and everyone that loveth him that begot
[51:00] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[51:03] by this we know that we love the
[51:06] children of god
[51:07] when we love god and keep his
[51:09] commandments this is the love of god
[51:11] that we keep
[51:12] his commandments and his commandments
[51:14] are not grievous
[51:16] whatsoever is born of god overcometh the
[51:18] world
[51:19] this is the victory that overcometh the
[51:20] world even our faith
[51:22] who is he that overcometh the world but
[51:24] he that believeth that jesus
[51:27] is the son of god romans chapter 6 and
[51:30] verse 16.
[51:42] know you not that to whom you yield
[51:44] yourself servants to
[51:45] obey as servants you are to whom you
[51:48] obey
[51:49] whether of sin unto death or of
[51:51] obedience unto righteousness
[51:54] but god be thanked that ye were the
[51:57] servants of sin but ye have obeyed
[51:59] from the heart that form of doctrine
[52:02] which was
[52:02] delivered you being then made free from
[52:06] sin
[52:06] he became the servants of righteousness
[52:09] may god bless his word he may be seated
[52:11] in the presence of the lord this evening
[52:14] amen being then made free from sin you
[52:19] became
[52:20] the servants of righteousness to be
[52:22] standing here in this
[52:24] hour knowing that exactly where you're
[52:26] standing at is a very
[52:27] a very important and pertinent thing in
[52:29] life to know exactly where you're
[52:31] standing at when so many people
[52:33] are so so tossed about on who they are
[52:36] and
[52:36] and their identities and things but to
[52:38] know that god be thanked because at one
[52:40] point in your life that
[52:42] it looked like you were going one way
[52:44] but because you obeyed
[52:46] because you obeyed from your heart the
[52:48] doctrine that was not
[52:50] not of man but the doctrine of the
[52:52] gospel of jesus christ
[52:54] that has made you because you obeyed
[52:57] from your heart it has made you
[52:59] it has made you servants of
[53:00] righteousness and
[53:02] and tonight i'd like to speak to you on
[53:04] a thought on when god
[53:06] when god takes over then you can all
[53:08] point at your life and look at your life
[53:10] and see that when you were
[53:12] growing when you were running things in
[53:13] the business of your life but then you
[53:15] can point at a spot in your life
[53:17] that when god took over the business and
[53:19] started running things
[53:20] and it seemed like things when jesus
[53:22] started taking over for you in your life
[53:24] things started running a whole lot
[53:25] smoother
[53:26] when you became captivated by somebody
[53:29] greater than yourself but you became so
[53:31] possessed with a power
[53:33] and empowered with his spirit and taken
[53:36] over with more than a form of religion
[53:39] or more than a form of mental conception
[53:41] but you became
[53:42] taken over with the power of the
[53:45] anointing of our lord jesus christ
[53:47] and and just to be standing in that spot
[53:50] if you can identify that you've been
[53:51] taken over
[53:53] and that christ has come and taken over
[53:55] the business of your life
[53:56] what a blessed people that we are this
[53:58] evening to stand here
[54:00] and identify ourselves as christians in
[54:02] this hour
[54:03] when it seems like nobody wants to be
[54:05] identified as a christian
[54:07] when nobody wants to stand as a
[54:09] christian and when nobody wants to stand
[54:11] for christ
[54:12] there's a lot of people that want to be
[54:14] identified with religion
[54:15] and want to get by with things and get
[54:17] by with their sin and everybody wants to
[54:19] heaven
[54:20] everybody wants to get to heaven but
[54:21] nobody wants to live right to get there
[54:24] but you see there's something on the
[54:26] inside of humanity
[54:27] no matter what state of life that person
[54:30] may be in
[54:31] there is something on the inside of
[54:32] humanity that will make them that
[54:35] that makes that person that something on
[54:38] the inside of them that moves them
[54:40] past themselves and and moves them past
[54:43] their fears and
[54:44] every person sitting here there every
[54:46] person sitting here has a different fear
[54:48] about themselves maybe some be scared of
[54:50] the dark or
[54:51] maybe scared to go out in public or
[54:53] maybe scared but
[54:54] to eat without washing their hands or
[54:56] something of that nature
[54:58] but you see there's something on the
[55:00] inside of that person
[55:01] that that even though there's a certain
[55:03] element of fear
[55:04] or there's a certain element of of
[55:07] awkwardness
[55:08] that they push themselves past for
[55:10] certain things
[55:12] is that right you know what i'm speaking
[55:14] of as a parent there's certain things
[55:16] that you would never do but because your
[55:18] child gets into a spot you make yourself
[55:21] it's something laying there that makes
[55:23] you push yourself
[55:25] past your own fears to step out and to
[55:27] save your child
[55:29] you remember when brother branham would
[55:30] tell that story about the lady that was
[55:32] that was coming home on that train that
[55:34] got embarrassed
[55:35] because of that lady that was scarred
[55:37] and her friends began to mock that lady
[55:40] and she began to mock her because of the
[55:42] scars on her face and
[55:43] she began to act like she didn't know
[55:45] her you see the reason why that you know
[55:47] the story
[55:48] but you know the reason why that she
[55:50] stepped out that mother did that
[55:52] was because of the love of that child
[55:55] that was inside of that burning house
[55:57] it made her step past her comfort zone
[56:01] and step into a spot of fear and make
[56:03] her push herself past
[56:05] that spot are you with me this evening
[56:07] there's something in humanity
[56:09] that makes you drive there's something
[56:13] laying there that makes you
[56:14] push past yourself it'll make you
[56:18] actually get beyond your own thinking
[56:20] when you go to breaking into that
[56:22] channel now that's just in humanity
[56:25] there's a lot of great business gurus
[56:27] and there's a lot of great athletes
[56:29] that realize that if they can break past
[56:31] that point
[56:32] that they realize or past their fears or
[56:34] or past that comfort zone
[56:36] that they can go into a realm that
[56:38] nobody is acquainted with
[56:39] that's what determines and makes the
[56:42] difference in greatness
[56:43] is when somebody can step out of their
[56:45] comfort zone
[56:48] now if you watch that in humanity how
[56:51] much greater will it be
[56:53] in a spiritual world when somebody
[56:55] breaks past their comfort zone
[56:57] we've been speaking on the last couple
[56:59] weekends and breaking past in worship
[57:01] and letting go in worship but i'm not
[57:03] just speaking about somebody singing
[57:05] loud
[57:06] i'm not just singing i'm not talking
[57:08] about somebody clapping their hands loud
[57:09] or somebody getting emotional
[57:11] you can sing until you get blue in the
[57:14] face
[57:14] you can scream to your red till your
[57:16] face hurts you can pray to a spot
[57:19] that you actually get a headache you can
[57:21] fast
[57:22] to a spot that almost that your belly
[57:24] button almost falls off but that's not
[57:26] what i'm talking about
[57:27] i'm talking about when you break past
[57:30] that element of humanity
[57:32] and break into the element of divinity
[57:36] now this is probably it's one of my
[57:39] favorite quotes
[57:40] by brother william branham and and and i
[57:42] was
[57:43] and i thought i would share it with you
[57:45] in this sermon
[57:47] and then brother branham he says some
[57:49] very pertinent things in this
[57:51] in this quote and i'll quote it to you
[57:53] you can go and look it up
[57:54] and save it for yourself and put it on
[57:56] your put it on your refrigerator if you
[57:58] choose to do so
[58:00] he said in perfect strength by perfect
[58:02] weakness he said the important thing
[58:04] one of the important things that we must
[58:06] master remember
[58:08] this and especially you young preachers
[58:10] and lay mental
[58:11] god's desire in our life that is we have
[58:14] to
[58:15] we have to master the thought of human
[58:18] ability if we ever get to a spot
[58:23] where we think that we can do it with
[58:24] our own intelligence
[58:26] and our own abilities we've got to
[58:28] master that in such a way
[58:30] that we can get rid of the thing and lay
[58:32] it aside
[58:33] so that god can use us that's right and
[58:36] make a complete surrender
[58:38] we cannot use one ability
[58:42] are you with me tonight you see i would
[58:44] never get behind this pulpit
[58:46] counting on my own human abilities i
[58:49] would never get up here be all based
[58:50] upon my own feelings
[58:52] i am only standing here because of the
[58:54] anointing of the lord
[58:56] we've got to make a complete surrender
[58:59] and come to god
[59:00] you've got to surrender to him both soul
[59:03] body and spirit
[59:04] everything that you are has to be
[59:07] surrendered to god
[59:08] in order that he can work his will in
[59:11] you
[59:12] and in me
[59:16] we must master the thought of human
[59:20] ability
[59:21] you see humanity learns how to channel
[59:24] themselves in business
[59:25] humanity learns how to channel
[59:27] themselves in sports
[59:29] humanity learns their limits that they
[59:31] can go to
[59:32] but i want to say to the church of the
[59:34] living god there is no limit
[59:37] in faith in an omnipotent god when you
[59:40] go to channeling yourself
[59:41] it will determine how far you will go in
[59:44] god
[59:45] if you're only willing to go so far and
[59:48] receive salvation
[59:49] that's as far that you'll ever go but i
[59:52] want to tell you there's more than
[59:53] salvation in jesus
[59:56] there's deliverance in jesus there's
[59:58] power in jesus
[1:00:00] there's wonder working power in the
[1:00:02] blood of jesus
[1:00:07] hallelujah you see if a son of god can
[1:00:10] ever channel themselves
[1:00:11] to break into that channel and then
[1:00:14] untap resources
[1:00:17] and start pulling out those things that
[1:00:19] are pertaining to them you'll watch
[1:00:21] miracles start taking place
[1:00:25] are you with me you see there are things
[1:00:29] that you're aware of that are happening
[1:00:32] and passing through this building just
[1:00:34] now
[1:00:35] and that's why the prophet would stand
[1:00:37] there and he would tell you that he was
[1:00:39] standing in two worlds
[1:00:40] and he was watching and he was watching
[1:00:43] people and he would tell people just to
[1:00:45] to hold himself still because he was
[1:00:47] watching every one of us have a spirit
[1:00:49] and he was watching and when they would
[1:00:50] get to moving that human spirit would
[1:00:52] get to moving and
[1:00:54] demon spirits would get to moving as
[1:00:55] well and brother branham could look into
[1:00:57] that realm
[1:00:58] and pull those things out and it's
[1:01:00] amazing to me
[1:01:01] is that we can't see those things on
[1:01:04] tape but yet you know
[1:01:06] that no human ability could reach into
[1:01:08] that realm and say
[1:01:10] those things but it had to be a prophet
[1:01:13] with a prophet ministry to reach into
[1:01:15] that realm
[1:01:17] and pull those things down so that the
[1:01:20] person
[1:01:20] could have faith in it brother branham
[1:01:22] would type it and he would tell us about
[1:01:24] television
[1:01:25] that there's channels that there's
[1:01:27] things that are flying through this
[1:01:29] atmosphere just now
[1:01:30] and you know that there's things that
[1:01:32] are flying through this airwaves
[1:01:34] that you can't see you could pull up on
[1:01:37] your phone and maybe pull up youtube
[1:01:39] and you'll see where did that come from
[1:01:42] it came from a channel
[1:01:45] and what did it do it took a unit or an
[1:01:47] instrument to break into that atmosphere
[1:01:50] and to show you the vision of what was
[1:01:53] already there
[1:01:55] and it took a profit to be able to look
[1:01:58] on a people
[1:01:59] and look at a vision and tell you what
[1:02:01] was already in your past
[1:02:03] but also be able to tell you what was
[1:02:05] also in your future
[1:02:09] hallelujah hallelujah it's amazing when
[1:02:13] god
[1:02:14] begins to take over that satan knows
[1:02:19] that there's an element of faith that's
[1:02:21] being released
[1:02:23] that he cannot he cannot break past that
[1:02:26] element
[1:02:27] of faith you know that when you go to
[1:02:30] believing for healing no matter
[1:02:32] how sick you are it's amazing that satan
[1:02:36] cannot break that barrier of faith
[1:02:39] when you go to believing for a baptism
[1:02:41] of the holy ghost
[1:02:43] and seeking a real true pentecostal
[1:02:45] experience
[1:02:46] and you're believing on the son of god
[1:02:49] that he
[1:02:50] is the christ there is a barrier of
[1:02:52] faith
[1:02:53] that satan himself cannot break
[1:03:01] and when you start believing in the god
[1:03:04] of this bible
[1:03:05] and when you start believing in the god
[1:03:07] that william branham preached
[1:03:09] and when you start believing in the god
[1:03:11] that paul preached
[1:03:13] there will be nothing that will scare
[1:03:14] you off of those promises
[1:03:16] because faith is not scared of reason
[1:03:20] faith is not scared of what is seen
[1:03:22] faith is not scared of what is felt
[1:03:25] you remember when brother branham he
[1:03:27] would he was planting he had a little
[1:03:29] garden there and that groundhog kept
[1:03:31] getting into his garden
[1:03:32] and he made that ugly looking picture
[1:03:34] and put up a little tin pan
[1:03:36] and put some beans behind it that when
[1:03:38] the wind would blow
[1:03:39] that it would tap that little pan and
[1:03:41] they were doing that to scare that
[1:03:43] groundhog off
[1:03:44] from eden in his garden he said but he
[1:03:47] watched one day and got back and he got
[1:03:49] to watching that groundhog
[1:03:50] and he said at first when he ran up to
[1:03:52] that ugly looking thing
[1:03:53] he ran back off but then he got to
[1:03:55] watching it again and he started running
[1:03:58] up a little bit closer to it
[1:04:02] and he started realizing that that ain't
[1:04:04] nothing but a little scarecrow that's
[1:04:06] standing there
[1:04:08] before long he was tapping that tin pan
[1:04:11] and he was realizing that everything
[1:04:13] that he wanted
[1:04:14] was on the other side of that scarecrow
[1:04:19] that all he had to do was get past it
[1:04:23] satan has set up all kinds of scarecrows
[1:04:26] in your life but all you gotta do is run
[1:04:29] past those things
[1:04:31] if you will realize tonight not just
[1:04:33] gaze past it
[1:04:34] but break past it don't look at it don't
[1:04:37] let you be scared of it
[1:04:39] there is nothing to be scared of as a
[1:04:42] son and daughter of god
[1:04:44] you can't be scared off of god's
[1:04:46] promises
[1:04:48] you're not a little groundhog that's
[1:04:50] looking at a tin pan
[1:04:52] you are a child of god that's looking at
[1:04:54] a defeated devil
[1:04:56] that's trying to keep you off of god's
[1:04:57] promises
[1:04:59] there is a place that only god can take
[1:05:02] you
[1:05:02] and satan is trying to keep you from it
[1:05:08] you're not a groundhog and you're not a
[1:05:11] crow
[1:05:12] you're an eagle
[1:05:19] hallelujah it's like the little child
[1:05:22] that's always trying
[1:05:24] he's always trying to put his hand
[1:05:27] put his hand through that sleeve he can
[1:05:30] never if he sucks there and tries to do
[1:05:32] it all by himself a little baby can
[1:05:34] never do it by himself
[1:05:35] but it takes the power of the father
[1:05:40] to put that hand directly through there
[1:05:43] you see as long as you're sitting there
[1:05:44] and trying to do it by your own human
[1:05:46] ability
[1:05:46] you'll never walk into those promises
[1:05:50] as long as you're trying to do it by
[1:05:52] your own mind do it by do it by your own
[1:05:54] thinking
[1:05:55] you'll never get there but as soon as
[1:05:57] you can start yielding your hand
[1:05:59] to the father you start yielding your
[1:06:02] spirit to the father
[1:06:04] that's real overcoming that's a victory
[1:06:06] when you start overcoming
[1:06:08] and you start yielding yourself to him
[1:06:10] that's the idea
[1:06:12] when you start yielding to him
[1:06:16] brother davey was in the in the hospital
[1:06:18] there they were giving him some therapy
[1:06:20] on his shoulder
[1:06:21] and they were trying to teach us so that
[1:06:23] we could help him when he got home
[1:06:25] with his therapy on doing certain things
[1:06:28] and so the
[1:06:29] the therapist was trying to teach us how
[1:06:32] we could be therapists
[1:06:33] basically on pine creek lane and she
[1:06:35] said i want you to yield
[1:06:37] your shoulder to me so that you know
[1:06:39] that when davey yields his shoulder
[1:06:42] to you and so i let her take a hold of
[1:06:45] my arm
[1:06:46] and she began to she began to tell me
[1:06:48] now andrew
[1:06:49] you've not yielded yourself completely
[1:06:51] over to me
[1:06:52] you see i was still holding on but
[1:06:55] finally when i begin to release every
[1:06:57] muscle on the inside of me
[1:06:59] i yielded myself to her and she began to
[1:07:02] take
[1:07:03] my arm and move it into positions so
[1:07:05] that she could teach me
[1:07:07] how to work for brother david's arm
[1:07:10] you see it taught me a real lesson on
[1:07:12] yielding you see when you begin to put
[1:07:15] your faith
[1:07:15] or you begin to put your muscles of your
[1:07:18] intellects into it
[1:07:19] you'll never allow god to go there but
[1:07:22] when god begins to take over
[1:07:24] and you start yielding yourself to him
[1:07:27] you will see the power
[1:07:29] of the yielding when jesus was
[1:07:32] walking to the way of the garden of
[1:07:34] gethsemane
[1:07:35] we are shown the real power of yielding
[1:07:40] when he takes his closest friends with
[1:07:43] him and they walk with him into a garden
[1:07:46] and he tells him to stay here and he
[1:07:49] only goes
[1:07:50] he only goes the cast of a stone away
[1:07:52] from them
[1:07:53] and he begins to break into an
[1:07:55] atmosphere of prayer
[1:07:58] and he started praying father if it be
[1:08:01] thy will let this cup pass from me
[1:08:03] and he went back to his friends and his
[1:08:05] friends then fell asleep on him
[1:08:07] you can read the different accounts of
[1:08:09] matthew mark luke and john
[1:08:11] of how they capture this he goes at one
[1:08:14] point in one of the
[1:08:15] in one of the gospel he goes back three
[1:08:17] times to them
[1:08:18] and they say and he speaks to them he
[1:08:21] said your spirit is willing
[1:08:22] but your flesh is weak what is it
[1:08:25] showing you
[1:08:26] it is showing you that you're going to
[1:08:27] have to go to a spot
[1:08:29] that your friends are not willing able
[1:08:31] to go to
[1:08:34] young people let me speak to you right
[1:08:36] there if you want this
[1:08:38] baptism of the holy ghost if you want to
[1:08:40] make the rapture
[1:08:42] if you want to make heaven your home you
[1:08:44] got to go to a spot
[1:08:46] that your friends can't even go to you
[1:08:48] with
[1:08:51] are you with me you've got to break past
[1:08:53] your comfort zone
[1:08:56] oh hallelujah
[1:09:00] and jesus gets into a spot of prayer
[1:09:03] and the sincerity of prayer and jesus
[1:09:06] begins to break in
[1:09:09] and he comes to a spot of yielding
[1:09:12] he said father if it be your will let
[1:09:14] this cup
[1:09:16] pass from me and he spoke these
[1:09:19] powerful words nevertheless
[1:09:25] nevertheless
[1:09:28] i wonder i wonder what would be past
[1:09:32] your nevertheless
[1:09:35] i wonder what would be on the other side
[1:09:37] of your nevertheless
[1:09:39] what's really laying past your
[1:09:41] nevertheless
[1:09:43] father i i want this in my own human
[1:09:45] spirit
[1:09:46] i want to be able to walk this way i
[1:09:48] want to live with my friends
[1:09:50] i want to do i want to be with them i'm
[1:09:53] i'm so eternal that i can live forever
[1:09:58] jesus didn't have to die
[1:10:01] but on the other side of his
[1:10:04] nevertheless
[1:10:05] i wonder if yours if you're on the other
[1:10:08] side of nevertheless
[1:10:09] would be the same as jesus is
[1:10:11] nevertheless
[1:10:14] what's your other side of nevertheless
[1:10:16] be not my will
[1:10:18] but thy will be taught
[1:10:22] not my own human spirit
[1:10:26] oh hallelujah nevertheless lord
[1:10:30] not my will oh hallelujah
[1:10:35] not my will not my will
[1:10:40] but thy will be done
[1:10:45] what's on the other side of your
[1:10:46] nevertheless
[1:10:49] something's laying on the inside of you
[1:10:51] that they can only come
[1:10:52] forth in your nevertheless
[1:10:57] that lily right there to me is one of
[1:10:59] the most beautiful flowers
[1:11:01] but it's laying it's it's being produced
[1:11:04] to you in its glory and its power
[1:11:07] because of a nevertheless
[1:11:10] are you with me there's a lot of people
[1:11:13] you enjoy it right here
[1:11:15] you enjoy its beauty you enjoy it
[1:11:17] splendor it testifies to you
[1:11:19] of the resurrection power of our lord
[1:11:21] jesus christ that he is the author
[1:11:24] of all things he is the author of life
[1:11:27] but there was a spot in this lily's life
[1:11:29] that you never appreciated it
[1:11:32] you never appreciated that lily when he
[1:11:35] was underneath the ground
[1:11:37] but do you realize that on the other
[1:11:40] side of this
[1:11:41] was a nevertheless and it had to break
[1:11:43] itself
[1:11:45] it had to break itself underneath the
[1:11:47] soil
[1:11:48] you couldn't see it you couldn't
[1:11:50] appreciate it but when it began to break
[1:11:53] when you couldn't see it hallelujah
[1:11:56] when somebody gets past their own
[1:11:58] emotions
[1:12:00] past their own feelings past who sees
[1:12:02] them
[1:12:03] past who don't see something
[1:12:06] they'll become a breaking forth
[1:12:10] oh hallelujah that little lily stands
[1:12:13] there in its glory
[1:12:14] because of what took place under the
[1:12:17] soil
[1:12:18] i'm looking at a bunch of people that
[1:12:21] are standing
[1:12:22] here because i nevertheless
[1:12:25] i'm willing to break past in my dirt you
[1:12:28] may be
[1:12:28] so infiltrated with sin in your life so
[1:12:32] caught up in drugs so caught up in your
[1:12:34] past
[1:12:36] but when god takes over
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:40] when god says your mind
[1:12:43] when god says i'm big enough to cover
[1:12:46] all your sins
[1:12:48] when i'm big enough to take care of you
[1:12:54] you didn't understand my beauty when i
[1:12:57] was underneath all of that sin
[1:12:59] but when i come up out of that ground
[1:13:05] it begin to testify to you that he's the
[1:13:07] same
[1:13:08] yesterday today and forever if he can do
[1:13:11] it for gabriel
[1:13:12] if he can do it for malachi he can do it
[1:13:14] for you
[1:13:18] hallelujah
[1:13:25] oh hallelujah
[1:13:30] hallelujah
[1:13:35] jesus so emphatically knew who he was
[1:13:41] that he was willing to break past his
[1:13:44] nevertheless
[1:13:48] he knew what the scripture said
[1:13:49] pertaining him
[1:13:51] he knew who he was
[1:13:54] can i say that jesus was comfortable in
[1:13:57] his own skin
[1:14:01] when he stood there and he didn't answer
[1:14:03] them a word when they hit him in the
[1:14:04] mouth
[1:14:05] when they hit him upside the head he was
[1:14:08] comfortable in his own skin
[1:14:10] because he knew what isaiah had said
[1:14:13] about the
[1:14:14] lamb are you with me
[1:14:18] he was comfortable when he started
[1:14:20] walking
[1:14:21] and they put him upon the fold of an ass
[1:14:24] and they started screaming hosanna
[1:14:27] hosanna blessed be the lord he was
[1:14:29] comfortable where he was at
[1:14:33] he was comfortable where he was at and
[1:14:36] when he
[1:14:38] oh church i could see him now when he's
[1:14:41] breaking past his own nevertheless
[1:14:44] not my will but thy will be done
[1:14:47] he was comfortable in his skin knowing
[1:14:50] that i'm going to pay the price for
[1:14:53] justin klein
[1:14:54] that i'm going to pay the price for joe
[1:14:56] and kelly
[1:14:57] he was comfortable because he knew what
[1:15:00] the scriptures were pertaining him
[1:15:04] if you can ever get comfortable with
[1:15:06] jesus in your flesh
[1:15:08] you'll set worlds on top of worlds
[1:15:11] you'll turn them upside down
[1:15:13] hell don't know what to do with somebody
[1:15:16] that's comfortable
[1:15:17] with jesus on the inside of them
[1:15:27] you can walk around knowing what the
[1:15:29] scripture said about you
[1:15:33] sure sure you got chains
[1:15:38] sure you got stigmas sure you got
[1:15:40] complexes
[1:15:42] but if you can ever break past that
[1:15:49] i don't know what he's doing but he's
[1:15:50] doing it
[1:15:52] i don't know why he's got me preaching
[1:15:54] to you on the power to yield
[1:15:56] but he's got me preaching on it i don't
[1:15:59] know why he's got me preaching to you
[1:16:00] about a seed breaking forth
[1:16:02] past all them sins but he's got me
[1:16:05] preaching on it
[1:16:06] i don't know why he's telling me to tell
[1:16:08] you for you to get comfortable
[1:16:10] with jesus living on the inside of you
[1:16:13] but he's telling me
[1:16:15] to tell you to get comfortable with
[1:16:17] jesus living on the inside of you
[1:16:20] now you can't be comfortable with jesus
[1:16:22] living in you
[1:16:23] when you got the devil living in you
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:27] but if you ever want to get comfortable
[1:16:29] with jesus you got to get rid of the old
[1:16:32] things
[1:16:32] let the old things be passed away and
[1:16:35] all things be made new in christ jesus
[1:16:38] hallelujah if you can get yourself good
[1:16:41] and comfortable with jesus
[1:16:42] you'll let jesus talk every once in a
[1:16:44] while
[1:16:46] if you'll get good and comfortable
[1:16:48] you'll stand up
[1:16:50] and you'll start speaking in tongues
[1:16:51] like jesus did
[1:16:55] if you ever get so yielded to the holy
[1:16:57] ghost and get comfortable in your skin
[1:16:59] with jesus
[1:17:01] watch out fig trees are getting ready to
[1:17:04] be cursed
[1:17:06] mountains are getting ready to be moved
[1:17:08] strongholds are getting ready to be cast
[1:17:10] down
[1:17:11] when you get comfortable with jesus
[1:17:13] speaking through you
[1:17:14] and jesus living through you hallelujah
[1:17:17] if you get comfortable with jesus
[1:17:19] jesus will walk into your house and kick
[1:17:21] out your dirty music
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:24] if you get comfortable with jesus he'll
[1:17:26] walk into your house
[1:17:28] and kick them skeletons out the closet
[1:17:30] there ain't enough room
[1:17:32] for jesus and a bunch of dead skeletons
[1:17:34] living in the same household
[1:17:40] but when god starts taking over
[1:17:46] when it starts taking over you begin to
[1:17:49] see that power
[1:17:50] the same power that raised jesus from
[1:17:52] the dead the same power
[1:17:54] that same one you realize
[1:17:58] that jesus was a man like you jesus had
[1:18:02] 16 elements
[1:18:03] and built out of the same materials like
[1:18:05] you and i he may have had a dark
[1:18:07] complexion like brother william barlavon
[1:18:09] he may have stood about six foot tall
[1:18:11] anymore he may have walked a certain way
[1:18:13] and carried it but
[1:18:14] jesus was made out of the same
[1:18:17] materials that you were made out of
[1:18:22] but jesus realized the power
[1:18:26] of who he was so much
[1:18:29] that when he realized that he was more
[1:18:32] than a man
[1:18:36] he said i come not to do my own will but
[1:18:38] i came to do the will of the father
[1:18:40] and when jesus let god begin to take
[1:18:43] over in his life
[1:18:44] he said i can't speak these things
[1:18:45] unless the father first showed me
[1:18:47] but he realized when god started taking
[1:18:50] over he was a man
[1:18:52] he was a man when he was crying at
[1:18:53] lazarus tomb but he was more than a man
[1:18:57] when he said lazarus come forth he was a
[1:19:00] man when he was weeping
[1:19:02] he was a man when he was tired in a boat
[1:19:04] but he was more than a man
[1:19:06] when he stood up out of that boat
[1:19:10] and he said peace be still i want to say
[1:19:13] to you church of the living god
[1:19:15] that same jesus is comfortable in his
[1:19:18] body tonight
[1:19:23] the hands move just like jesus said the
[1:19:26] feet move just like jesus said
[1:19:28] the god of peace will bruise satan
[1:19:32] under your feet
[1:19:40] hallelujah when you begin to get
[1:19:43] comfortable
[1:19:44] that means getting comfortable
[1:19:49] you begin to let your faith loose on
[1:19:50] what he has said about you
[1:19:52] there's not gonna be a mountain standing
[1:19:54] away of jesus and there won't be a
[1:19:56] mountain standing your way
[1:19:58] and when rahab let her faith loose in
[1:20:00] what the spies had said to her
[1:20:03] when they told her if you put down this
[1:20:05] token right here
[1:20:06] the destroying angel can't even get
[1:20:08] close to your household
[1:20:10] when she got good and comfortable with
[1:20:12] letting the spies
[1:20:14] go out and hide them and keep them
[1:20:17] and take on what they had said when she
[1:20:20] got
[1:20:20] comfortable with getting everybody on
[1:20:22] the inside of her house
[1:20:27] that destroying angel could tear down
[1:20:29] every brick
[1:20:31] around her house but it couldn't touch
[1:20:32] hers because there was a promise
[1:20:35] there was a covenant and she was
[1:20:37] comfortable
[1:20:38] with what the spies had said
[1:20:41] there is a people on earth today
[1:20:44] that is comfortable with a prophet's
[1:20:47] message
[1:20:49] they're comfortable with calling william
[1:20:51] branham a prophet
[1:20:52] calling him malachi 4 calling him
[1:20:54] revelations 10
[1:20:55] 7. but it don't stop there they're
[1:20:58] comfortable in saying
[1:20:59] i am revelations 10 8. i
[1:21:02] am he that was spoke of that no weapon
[1:21:05] that's formed against me
[1:21:06] shall prosper that when the enemy comes
[1:21:09] in like a flood
[1:21:10] god will raise up the standard
[1:21:16] there's a body on earth
[1:21:19] rahab already had everything that she
[1:21:22] had
[1:21:24] to lay that token out there on that
[1:21:26] window
[1:21:29] she already had it in her house
[1:21:34] all that had to be done was applied
[1:21:40] hey somebody in the house tonight
[1:21:43] that all you got to do he's already here
[1:21:46] the blood's already here
[1:21:48] the atonement's already been made all
[1:21:50] you got to do is apply it
[1:21:52] you got everything you have need of if
[1:21:54] you got the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:56] every redemptive blessing that jesus
[1:21:58] christ paid for at calvary has already
[1:22:00] been
[1:22:01] placed in your hands all you've got to
[1:22:03] do is obtain it
[1:22:04] and say god i apply that to my household
[1:22:12] now jesus said
[1:22:15] verily i say unto you in 11 mark 11 24
[1:22:18] he said
[1:22:18] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:22:20] no doubt in your heart but believe what
[1:22:22] you said will come to pass
[1:22:25] you can have what you said he said that
[1:22:27] puts him right back
[1:22:29] supreme again it puts him right back in
[1:22:32] the condition
[1:22:34] he said now now we're made up of light
[1:22:36] meters inside of us is cosmic light
[1:22:39] now that cosmic light is a light that
[1:22:41] can take an x-ray with an x-ray
[1:22:43] their x-ray doesn't come from the x-ray
[1:22:45] light it comes from your own light
[1:22:48] and then if that cosmic light say could
[1:22:51] be pushed to a place
[1:22:53] to where not cosmic light but eternal
[1:22:56] light
[1:22:57] could dwell supremely to do our thinking
[1:23:00] to do our walking to do our talking then
[1:23:03] it's no longer the man
[1:23:05] it's the god in the man
[1:23:09] if he will yield to the spirit the more
[1:23:12] he becomes
[1:23:13] unmanned sinner-like and becomes
[1:23:16] more godlike the more
[1:23:20] you yield yourself to the holy spirit
[1:23:23] the more unmanned
[1:23:26] you become i want you to ponder that
[1:23:30] just for a moment
[1:23:38] this humanity will fail you
[1:23:42] i'm only 33 years old and humanity the
[1:23:46] flesh is already failing me
[1:23:50] gray hair is popping up in places
[1:23:54] that my children said daddy you can't be
[1:23:56] getting that old yet
[1:23:59] what is it humanity is failing me
[1:24:04] you watch as you get older
[1:24:07] you begin to watch humanity fail you
[1:24:10] your hair will fall out your teeth will
[1:24:13] fall out
[1:24:14] your eyes that have been perfect all
[1:24:16] their life
[1:24:17] now you need these things called readers
[1:24:19] because humanity
[1:24:22] is constantly failing
[1:24:25] but the more you yield yourself to the
[1:24:28] holy spirit the more
[1:24:30] unmanned you become
[1:24:36] man i hope you catch this the more you
[1:24:39] yield yourself
[1:24:40] the more unmanned you become now you can
[1:24:44] sit there and wallow in your own
[1:24:46] self-pity
[1:24:47] because humanity is failing you or you
[1:24:50] can yield to the holy spirit
[1:24:52] that will take you to a new body well
[1:24:55] you don't have to worry about the
[1:24:56] manhood no more
[1:24:58] you don't have to worry about womanhood
[1:25:00] no more you don't have to worry about
[1:25:02] sinner like no more
[1:25:03] but when you get that new body you ain't
[1:25:06] thinking about humanity failing you you
[1:25:08] ain't worried about your wings failing
[1:25:10] you
[1:25:10] you're only worried about one thing
[1:25:14] that's worship in him all the days of
[1:25:17] your life
[1:25:20] hallelujah he said now we he said if we
[1:25:24] could just
[1:25:25] completely yield to the holy ghost and
[1:25:27] give us super strength to rise in the
[1:25:29] name of jesus christ
[1:25:31] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:25:33] he that's in the world
[1:25:34] the strength in god that's in you is
[1:25:37] greater than any affliction that can
[1:25:38] come upon you
[1:25:40] there is nothing that can overtake you

[1:26:32] down on that little chamber
[1:26:33] in that bed that she had prepared for
[1:26:35] him because she had prepared
[1:26:38] a place for god's servant to lay down
[1:26:41] and he began to talk to his servant to
[1:26:42] hazel and said what

[1:27:46] the prophet that she took that dead son

[1:31:59] it's oh well are there circumstances in

[1:32:05] things that are there
[1:32:06] some things that you don't understand
[1:32:08] it's all well
[1:32:09] her faith says all is well
[1:32:15] what part of that woman was speaking
[1:32:17] that
[1:32:20] she was on the other side of her
[1:32:22] nevertheless
[1:32:24] and god honored her faith
[1:32:32] he says hazel you take my you take my
[1:32:35] rod
[1:32:38] and you go lay it on that son
[1:32:41] she said did you deceive me
[1:32:44] i didn't ask you for this
[1:32:47] i didn't ask you for this son you asked
[1:32:50] me
[1:32:53] you asked me you gave me this

[1:33:00] mock me my childlessness don't move
[1:33:05] did you deceive me hazel take my staff
[1:33:09] she said as my soul liveth i'm not gonna
[1:33:12] leave you
[1:33:13] she was on his hands and elijah said i'm
[1:33:16] not gonna stay here with you on my hands
[1:33:19] i'm going to your knee
[1:33:22] oh hallelujah maybe you've been knocking
[1:33:24] on heaven's door
[1:33:25] and you're laying there you just keep
[1:33:27] knocking
[1:33:28] for him that knocketh it shall be opened
[1:33:31] to him
[1:33:32] and he that seeketh you shall find
[1:33:45] and the prophet goes to a spot
[1:33:50] that he's been comfortable before
[1:33:53] i've laid here before i've been here
[1:33:56] before
[1:33:58] i wonder if that same jesus said you've
[1:34:00] been crying out for
[1:34:01] all your needs
[1:34:05] you've been calling out for him because
[1:34:07] you've been sick now there's a lot of
[1:34:09] people that call on him when they get
[1:34:10] sick
[1:34:11] but after they get well they just run
[1:34:13] off and leave him
[1:34:15] but i wonder if there's a spot prepared
[1:34:18] for jesus
[1:34:19] that he's already comfortable in laying
[1:34:21] down in
[1:34:24] is there a spot already comfortable for
[1:34:26] jesus to lay in
[1:34:28] and he starts laying down
[1:34:31] i've been there before i've worshiped
[1:34:34] there before
[1:34:34] i've seen the anointing there before
[1:34:37] i've seen my own self
[1:34:39] lay down in that body before i'm
[1:34:42] comfortable in that woman
[1:34:43] i'm comfortable in that man i've been
[1:34:46] there before
[1:34:47] i know that if i meet their need they
[1:34:50] won't leave me high and dry
[1:34:51] they'll walk with me they'll talk with
[1:34:53] me
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:34:58] oh
[1:35:02] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:35:06] is jesus comfortable in your own skin
[1:35:10] that he could come to your situation
[1:35:12] that he could come to your need
[1:35:15] and he can lay himself down
[1:35:25] i'm the son of man that spoke that life
[1:35:31] and those 16 elements came and that
[1:35:34] woman that had
[1:35:35] so long for a child
[1:35:43] that fleshly lifeless
[1:35:46] what was that laying on the inside of
[1:35:48] that prophet
[1:35:50] that was speaking those things that was
[1:35:53] the son of man the word
[1:35:55] that spoke that life
[1:35:58] and when that same life that had spoke
[1:36:01] that son into existence
[1:36:03] began to lay itself down upon itself
[1:36:09] he laid there he lay there on this dead
[1:36:12] corpse
[1:36:13] and nothing was moving he laid there
[1:36:17] he laid there he laid that way he'd been
[1:36:20] comfortable before
[1:36:22] he laid there and he'd been he'd been
[1:36:26] friends with this boy before
[1:36:31] but now there's no life
[1:36:37] and all of a sudden something come up
[1:36:39] all the way from his feet
[1:36:42] and elijah sneezed seven times
[1:36:46] a life came back into a dead corpse
[1:36:51] elijah was not deceived by the son of
[1:36:54] man that was in him that spoke that life
[1:36:56] there
[1:36:59] when he started seeing that life come
[1:37:02] and raise up again he realized
[1:37:04] i wasn't the one that spoke that
[1:37:09] and when a preacher gets to a spot that
[1:37:12] he realizes
[1:37:13] i'm not the one that spoke that they
[1:37:16] were in that human ability
[1:37:18] they were warn that human mind but when
[1:37:20] they get to that spot
[1:37:21] i'm ah i didn't speak that
[1:37:24] i didn't say that but jesus says i'm
[1:37:28] comfortable
[1:37:29] i'm the one that said that i'm the one
[1:37:31] that spoke that
[1:37:32] i will back it up and vindicate what i
[1:37:34] spoke
[1:37:35] [Applause]
[1:37:39] jesus is comfortable in the body of
[1:37:42] jesus christ
[1:37:44] i'm the one that said that she'll be
[1:37:46] blameless she'll be spotless
[1:37:48] she'll be holy i'm comfortable in living
[1:37:52] there
[1:37:53] because i predetermined that house
[1:38:05] or was it what was it
[1:38:09] but was it on the inside of elijah
[1:38:13] god had taken over
[1:38:19] they were not the messiah they were
[1:38:22] little messiahs
[1:38:25] they were my science they had the same
[1:38:28] anointing
[1:38:31] they had the same anointing the same
[1:38:34] power
[1:38:35] the same life but in a form
[1:38:38] that it would come and anoint them
[1:38:43] and god so took over elijah
[1:38:49] and he could speak those words to him
[1:38:55] you'll never sneeze the same
[1:38:59] you'll never handle yourself the same
[1:39:03] when you get comfortable with jesus
[1:39:04] living there
[1:39:21] life shook you up a little bit
[1:39:27] life gives you some some rough roads
[1:39:33] life seemed to be more than you could
[1:39:34] handle
[1:39:37] but i want you to know you may live on a
[1:39:40] dirt road
[1:39:43] and it may look like jesus
[1:39:46] won't walk your way
[1:39:50] but i want you to know that jesus will
[1:39:52] walk in the most unpredictable places
[1:39:58] he will walk in the most unpredictable
[1:40:00] places
[1:40:02] he'll make a highway out of nothing
[1:40:07] are you with me when peter
[1:40:10] looked out there and he seen he seen
[1:40:13] what he said
[1:40:14] i thought lord is that you
[1:40:19] it is i be not afraid
[1:40:22] what did he do he made a highway for
[1:40:25] peter to walk on
[1:40:30] you may look like you're in some
[1:40:31] unpredictable spots in life
[1:40:34] but jesus knows how to make a highway
[1:40:38] out of nothing your life may be a wreck
[1:40:42] your life may be in shambles your
[1:40:44] humanity
[1:40:45] may be tore up and scarred up but
[1:40:47] there's a god
[1:40:50] oh hallelujah
[1:40:54] there's a god that's wanting to walk on

[1:41:31] he's the god of second chances
[1:41:32] he'll let me walk on it twice and just
[1:41:36] when i felt
[1:41:37] like there was no way for me to get back
[1:41:39] up i saw a hand
[1:41:44] because god took over

[1:51:44] come to a spot to where he realized
[1:51:47] this service is way bigger than i am
[1:51:53] that's the reason we can never have man
[1:51:55] worship
[1:51:58] we must keep our focus on god
[1:52:02] because he wants to be the center focus
[1:52:04] of our lives
[1:52:06] and when we realize we can't do nothing
[1:52:08] without him
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:11] even jesus would say i cannot do
[1:52:14] anything
[1:52:16] except my father shows me first
[1:52:20] what is god preparing us for
[1:52:23] he's going to take your flesh and
[1:52:26] transform it
[1:52:30] not just heal your cold
[1:52:31] [Music]
[1:52:34] not just try to get into your emotions a
[1:52:36] bit
[1:52:37] but he's got to take that body from this
[1:52:39] dimension
[1:52:41] mortal to immortality
[1:52:45] and it's got to be to the point to where
[1:52:47] that your gravity
[1:52:48] will turn loose
[1:52:50] [Applause]
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:57] you turn hallelujah enough to let him
[1:52:59] take you home
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:02] hallelujah your eyes will not be on the
[1:53:06] world
[1:53:07] but it'll be so on him you'll start
[1:53:11] walking like enoch walked
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:14] and you'll step from one dimension to
[1:53:16] another dimension
[1:53:20] or elijah to get a chariot and stepped
[1:53:22] into that chariot
[1:53:26] we're a people prepared
[1:53:30] to step from this realm to that realm
[1:53:35] let's just sing it again hello
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:51] let's just sing it with all of our
[1:53:53] hearts
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:13] [Music]
[1:54:20] oh
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:39] let's just pause just for a moment for
[1:54:41] prayer
[1:54:43] maybe you'd like to say lord i i want to
[1:54:46] surrender my whole heart
[1:54:53] i've said in this service tonight it's
[1:54:55] not by an accident
[1:54:57] but i wanna surrender me
[1:55:04] brother branham said that abel pulled
[1:55:07] himself upon that rock
[1:55:11] and offered himself
[1:55:15] almighty god
[1:55:20] lord jesus we present ourself to you
[1:55:26] in a complete light

[1:56:23] ourselves to you
[1:56:26] when i hear the prophet say that the
[1:56:29] greatest miracle that he ever saw
[1:56:32] was when a man could say i've been wrong
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:37] i would say that a lot of us has been in
[1:56:39] that spot before
