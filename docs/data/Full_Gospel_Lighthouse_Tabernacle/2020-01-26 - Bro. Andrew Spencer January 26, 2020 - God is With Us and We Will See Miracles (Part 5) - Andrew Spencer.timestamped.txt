[0:00] Oh

[0:15] [Music]
[0:18] because
[0:22] [Applause]
[0:24] more severe because of years is a god
[0:28] that hasn't changed it's a god that is a
[0:32] rock is our foundation
[0:35] he's our strength he's our friend he's
[0:41] our friend to think that that Jesus
[0:45] would call us friends
[0:49] it's overwhelming to me that Jesus would
[0:52] calm his friend that he's not ashamed to
[0:57] call me his brother
[0:59] what a god I so love him with all of my
[1:03] heart I know you do as well because you
[1:07] wouldn't be here if you knew that shows
[1:09] a desire that you got on the inside of
[1:11] you then you want to hear more from you
[1:16] have your Bibles as evening will will
[1:19] turn over to the book of jeremiah
[1:21] chapter 10 and verse 6
[1:28] I'd like to continue our thought on God
[1:33] with us I'm gonna be remembering brother
[1:40] on tomorrow morning actually afternoon
[1:44] 12:45 tomorrow evening at UVA and and we
[1:49] will keep you apprised to everything
[1:51] that is going on and and keep you
[1:54] updated by the way of text message and
[1:56] if you know somebody that doesn't
[1:58] receive those and you want to share that
[2:00] with them by phone call please do so
[2:03] will be kind of flooded by by just
[2:06] sending out those things so if you
[2:07] wouldn't mind just sharing that and we
[2:11] want the brighter in the world to be
[2:12] praying and we are absolutely believing
[2:15] God's report and expecting a good report
[2:18] and man we we heard on the spark of
[2:21] expectation and we are expecting great
[2:24] things from a great God and so we just
[2:27] want to be remembering brother on that
[2:29] we don't know exactly how evasive that
[2:33] will be and what not so we're just
[2:34] asking that that the God would would
[2:37] anoint the doctors and the everything
[2:40] that goes on there and we know that he
[2:42] will because they're not just working on
[2:44] somebody they're working on on God's
[2:47] servants so so we just want to be
[2:49] remembering those things and if you have
[2:52] not if you did not and have way of
[2:55] access to Internet if you have not
[2:58] listened to brother Tim Pruett sermon
[3:00] from today I ask you to do that it is a
[3:04] it is such a overwhelming thought and it
[3:08] is something that you need to hear on
[3:10] claiming your rots and
[3:13] and speaking on the whole how sufferest
[3:15] and stand and be healed it's such a
[3:18] powerful word and I encourage you to do
[3:20] so this week while you have time and man
[3:23] Jeremiah chapter 10 and verse 6
[3:25] amen bless it be the name of the Lord
[3:29] amen
[3:30] for as much as there is none like unto
[3:33] thee O Lord thou art great and thy name
[3:36] is great in might who would not fear the
[3:40] Oh king of nations for to thee nothing a
[3:43] pertain it is do him the fear fear is do
[3:47] unto God for as much as among all the
[3:51] wise men of the nations and in all their
[3:54] kingdoms there is none like unto thee
[3:57] but the Lord is the true God can you say
[4:00] the true God he is the Living God and an
[4:07] everlasting king at his wrath the earth
[4:09] shall tremble and the nations shall not
[4:12] be able to abide his indignation thus
[4:16] shall you say unto them the gods that
[4:18] have not made the heavens and the earth
[4:21] even they shall perish from the earth
[4:23] and from under these heavens he hath
[4:27] made the earth by his power he hath
[4:31] established the world by his wisdom and
[4:33] has stretched out the heavens by his
[4:35] discretion when he uttered his voice
[4:39] there is a multitude of waters in the
[4:42] heavens and he calls us the vapors to
[4:45] ascend from the ends of the earth he
[4:48] maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth
[4:51] forth the wind out of his treasures
[4:53] that's the God that is with us and
[4:56] that's the God that has got your back
[4:59] amen look at your neighbors say God's
[5:01] got my back a man with that in mind
[5:05] let's call on the God of heaven just now
[5:07] Heavenly Father we call upon you Lord
[5:10] Jesus and we realize that what we have
[5:13] been given this evening as an
[5:14] opportunity that men that men have so
[5:18] desired throughout years to be standing
[5:21] in this age and be standing in this
[5:22] moment father we are we are
[5:25] privileged people this evening to be
[5:26] sitting here in the presence of the king
[5:29] and we pray that that your people would
[5:31] feel your presence and and while we are
[5:34] passing by their way that you would
[5:36] reach out and touch them Lord I know
[5:38] there's many that are sick and been
[5:40] battling different things but we believe
[5:42] you're greater than a common cold
[5:44] greater than the flu you're greater than
[5:46] a cough
[5:47] you are a god that has healing in his
[5:50] wings and we pray that that you would
[5:52] stretch out your wings across this
[5:54] congregation just now and and that that
[5:57] the healing virtues of Christ would flow
[5:59] over this local body father lord I pray
[6:02] you administer to them in a supernatural
[6:04] way Lord one more time I yield my vessel
[6:07] to you I pray as as it were I could just
[6:09] so go sit down in a corner and you could
[6:12] use this vessel to speak to your
[6:13] children Lord I pray they not see me or
[6:16] hear me but may they hear you speaking
[6:18] tonight or will you or our vessels and
[6:20] ask God you'd have that on the way in
[6:23] Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you
[6:26] be seated in the name of the Lord turn
[6:29] with me over to Hebrews chapter 1 God is
[6:36] with us and we will see miracles jesus
[6:43] said I am the way the truth and the life
[6:46] Jesus is the way he's not a way but he's
[6:49] the way Jesus is not part of the truth
[6:53] but he is the whole of the truth jesus
[6:56] said I am he said whenever time you hear
[6:59] him say I am that means I am present
[7:01] tense it is right now and he said that I
[7:04] am the resurrection that means he's a
[7:06] resurrection right now he said I am the
[7:09] door I am the life I am the bread I am
[7:12] the water
[7:13] I am the fountain I am the root and
[7:15] offspring of David he's the same
[7:18] yesterday today and forever he is in a
[7:21] class all by himself there's nobody else
[7:24] like Jehovah there's no God like our God
[7:27] he's in a class all by himself
[7:29] there ain't nobody that's got a name
[7:31] like Jesus it is his name that ever knee
[7:35] shall bow and every tongue
[7:37] shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[7:40] there's no one beside him none like him
[7:43] none before him he's in a class all by
[7:46] himself but he has a name that is a
[7:49] sweetest name that's ever been uttered
[7:51] across mortal tongues the name of Jesus
[7:54] brings Almighty God by our way and if
[7:58] you want deity in your midst you welcome
[8:00] and receive the word in your midst now a
[8:04] Hebrews tells us that God who at sundry
[8:07] times and in divers manners spake in
[8:09] times past unto the father's by the
[8:11] prophets hath and these last days spoken
[8:14] unto us by his son whom he have
[8:17] appointed heir of all things by whom
[8:20] also he made the world's who being the
[8:24] brightness of his glory and the Express
[8:25] image of his person and upholding all
[8:28] things bearing all things by the word of
[8:33] his power when he had by himself purged
[8:36] our sins by himself purged our sins sat
[8:40] down on the right hand of the Majesty on
[8:44] high we are gathering a picture of a God
[8:47] that is with us now we read this with
[8:51] you to you last weekend on end the
[8:53] message what was the Holy Ghost given
[8:55] for he said now God poured himself into
[8:59] Christ correct Christ poured himself
[9:01] into the church therefore now watch at
[9:03] that day you will know that I am in the
[9:06] father and you are in me and I am in you
[9:09] at that day you'll know it for it's the
[9:11] whole thing the whole thing is one plan
[9:13] of redemption coming down that God
[9:16] coming back to live and dwell with and
[9:19] commune to his people as he did at the
[9:22] beginning now then as soon as he gets
[9:25] his church in speaking conditions gets
[9:29] his church to a place that he can flow
[9:31] himself through and love and persuade
[9:34] and fellowship then there will come and
[9:37] eat him when he gets his church on
[9:40] speaking conditions where they're
[9:42] communicating back and forth to each
[9:44] other when when you're not afraid to to
[9:47] lift your voice when you're not afraid
[9:49] to pray when you're not
[9:50] afraid to go out in public and stand as
[9:53] a as a testimony as as of the living
[9:56] Lord Jesus on speaking conditions where
[9:59] where he can whisper those those sweet
[10:01] secrets into your ear and he can speak
[10:03] lit the air to you and you can speak lip
[10:07] to ear to him on speaking conditions
[10:10] with Almighty God we're living in an
[10:13] hour there where men have long to be in
[10:15] this day on a day when God has dispersed
[10:19] himself like a never before when he
[10:21] released his power the same power that
[10:24] came down on the day of Pentecost has
[10:26] been released in this hour we have seen
[10:29] that God moving power moving
[10:32] demonstration as he is the God that
[10:34] wrote the word he's the God that is
[10:36] obligated to keep that word he's a god
[10:39] that is obligated to back up that word
[11:07] Superman needs his cape but I'm not
[11:12] Superman I got a Super God that lives on
[11:21] the inside of me we have seen this God
[11:25] as he is the one that wrote the word
[11:27] that had told us that these things were
[11:29] going to come to pass he's a god that
[11:31] said these things he's a god that has
[11:34] backed up all of the things that have
[11:36] happened in our midst and we have seen
[11:38] this God and this day like never before
[11:41] him perform miracles
[11:42] that were too hard for doctors to figure
[11:45] out there were cases that come up come
[11:47] up against God in this day when because
[11:50] Satan has tried to hide his very best to
[11:54] try to hide from doctors and there was a
[11:56] prophet on the scene that would say Oh
[11:58] Satan now has heard from the doctors but
[12:01] you can't hide from God and there have
[12:04] been hard cases that have come against
[12:06] that that have come against this message
[12:08] but this message is not a man this
[12:11] message is not just pictures this
[12:13] message is Christ we've not come here to
[12:17] talk about we've not come here to talk
[12:19] about a church we've not come here to
[12:22] talk about a man we've come here to talk
[12:25] about Jesus Christ we've come here to
[12:28] talk about the God of heaven we've come
[12:30] here not to talk about a message but to
[12:33] get in a message and that message to get
[12:36] on the inside of you and I and that
[12:38] message to live like never before
[12:40] you see if all this is is just me
[12:43] preaching it brother on preaching on
[12:45] Saturday and Sunday and you go back out
[12:48] to your job on Mondays and you go back
[12:50] into the same routines what good was
[12:53] your weekend spit for you see it's got
[12:55] to be more than you going to church and
[12:58] spending two or three hours there and
[12:59] hearing a man standing behind the pulpit
[13:02] and shout and talk about a god that is
[13:04] not bad that he's still living but is he
[13:07] really living on the inside when you go
[13:10] to work on Monday
[13:12] I know I don't want to this is not about
[13:15] just going through the everyday life and
[13:18] you proclaiming that God sent a prophet
[13:20] it's way past that it's past God's and a
[13:24] prophet but now it is a people of the
[13:27] open book taken what that prophet said
[13:30] and living it out in this day this is
[13:33] modern events made clear by prophecy
[13:38] we've seen this God and move and operate
[13:41] in human flesh just like he did as he
[13:44] did 2,000 years ago we've seen him
[13:47] create life we've seen him speak to
[13:50] storms and he speak him right out of
[13:52] existence we see them curse the enemy
[13:56] and the enemy thwarted and defeated and
[13:58] destroyed we've seen this God do
[14:00] impossible feats we are seeing a God who
[14:04] is invisible work in humanity and
[14:08] declare himself Jehovah now he does not
[14:12] have to he does not to have to perform
[14:15] miracles to prove that he's God but
[14:18] because his word said that he would is
[14:20] why he performs miracles you see God is
[14:24] with us and we will see miracles and why
[14:27] are we a guarantee that we're going to
[14:30] see miracles it's because the Bible said
[14:32] so are you with me because the Bible
[14:35] said so and there is a people on the
[14:38] face of the earth that have a god-given
[14:41] character to handle the power that's
[14:44] been placed in her hand we have seen a
[14:51] God work in our midst like a never
[14:54] before we've seen the Kings sword and go
[14:58] into acts and as it went coming as it
[15:01] came and then did not come with a cease
[15:03] upon it but they've come ready to do
[15:05] work it come to cut and it come to tear
[15:08] down we have seen the third pull the
[15:10] opening of the word in operation behind
[15:13] the veil of humanity behind that tent it
[15:15] is not a public show but it is
[15:19] it is veiled behind humanity and though
[15:22] the world though the world may not see
[15:25] it we realize that there are carnal
[15:28] impersonations of the first pool and the
[15:30] second pool but there can be no
[15:33] impersonations of this third pool Satan
[15:36] don't know nothing about it but there's
[15:38] a people on earth that knows exactly
[15:40] what it is and they're putting it in the
[15:43] action what is it it's the king sword
[15:46] this is the King's word and the Bible
[15:49] said that where the word of a king is
[15:51] there is power hello
[15:56] whether man would tell us that when to
[15:58] omnipotence come together that something
[16:01] has got to shake when an omnipotent God
[16:03] and an omnipotent faith in Almighty God
[16:06] comes that qamar oculus has to be
[16:09] performed are you with me the Bible said
[16:12] that he is omnipotent he is all-powerful
[16:14] and brother Branham said that when that
[16:17] omnipotent faith that means an
[16:19] all-powerful faith where is that going
[16:22] to come out of it's got to come out of a
[16:25] people that believe more than God's able
[16:29] to do it that but they believe that God
[16:32] will do it come on somebody the church
[16:36] world believes God is able to do it but
[16:38] we're are people that realize that God
[16:41] will do it God ain't backing off of his
[16:44] promises it's we that get troubled by
[16:47] the things we see but don't you be
[16:50] scared by the times
[16:52] that's standing your way the bigger the
[16:54] child the bigger they fall hello if you
[17:02] want a victory you got to have a battle
[17:04] we are in a battle for spiritual places
[17:07] right now for heavenly places and Satan
[17:10] wants her position Satan hates you
[17:14] he hates me and I hate him but I know
[17:19] that God is my friend hallelujah that's
[17:25] the God who is with us the all-powerful
[17:27] war
[17:29] now in Jesus when he come into the city
[17:32] over in the book of John chapter 11 when
[17:35] he come over there into the city of
[17:37] Bethany when his friend Lazarus had died
[17:41] and been dead for days now it now to
[17:44] think that all of the people that were
[17:46] sitting around Jesus when the news came
[17:49] to Jesus that his friend Lazarus was
[17:52] dead what are what a friend we have in
[17:55] Jesus and when the news came that his
[17:59] friend Lazarus was dead then Jesus spoke
[18:03] these words that this sickness is not
[18:05] unto death you see because because Jesus
[18:10] knew what was on the other side of it
[18:12] now if you were a corridor believer and
[18:16] you are sitting around Jesus and you
[18:18] were just looking at the symptoms you
[18:22] would think well this is nothing but
[18:24] another false prophet when Lazarus had
[18:27] been dead for days oh but I think God
[18:30] that there's some believers that look
[18:32] past the symptoms that look past what
[18:36] they can see with their five senses what
[18:38] what they can look past with their eyes
[18:41] come on somebody but look at the faith
[18:44] that Martha had when she came to him in
[18:47] verse 21 she said then said moth under
[18:50] Jesus Lord Lord if I would have been
[18:55] here my brother had not died she was not
[18:58] rebuking Jesus for not being there she
[19:01] was letting Jesus know the faith that
[19:04] she had in him she realized that if
[19:07] Jesus would have been in the house
[19:09] Lazarus could not have died but this was
[19:12] a sickness that was not into death but
[19:15] this was for the glory of the Lord if
[19:19] you'd have been here he wouldn't die
[19:20] whew but I love this but I know now
[19:25] but I know that even now whatsoever they
[19:32] will ask God God will give it to you
[19:34] even now Lord I know that you have the
[19:39] power to speak into existence I know you
[19:43] have the power to ask what about you and
[19:48] your friends come to you I heard you're
[19:50] a Christian I heard you believe in
[19:52] divine healing what about you asking
[19:56] this ain't just the pastor asking this
[19:59] ain't just the deacon asking this is you
[20:02] asking jesus said if you shall ask
[20:05] anything in my name you're not operating
[20:09] in a week God's name you're operating in
[20:13] the God of heaven but even now no matter
[20:21] what no matter the circumstance no
[20:24] matter the condition no matter how bad
[20:26] it looks even now Lord I want to say is
[20:33] to you that the circumstances couldn't
[20:35] have really gotten any worse for Mary
[20:36] Martha they don't went through every
[20:39] emotion that you can imagine that
[20:41] brother had died they had been a friend
[20:43] to Jesus which they thought was the
[20:45] Messiah here with me they went through
[20:48] the emotions here G here last source
[20:51] died they go through emotion of him not
[20:55] to me this is everyday life right here
[20:57] this is a scripture for everyday life
[21:00] they're going through the emotions the
[21:02] funerals past the circumstance can't get
[21:05] no worse than else the condition can't
[21:07] get no worse than this the burial had
[21:09] passed the ceiling of the tomb has
[21:11] passed and four days they had if they
[21:14] had had four days of grieving but even
[21:18] though they had went through the
[21:20] emotions when they seen Jesus coming
[21:22] down the road
[21:23] Martha Anna and said even now Lord Oh
[21:28] hallelujah I would ask you today no
[21:31] matter what your situation and no matter
[21:34] the condition your face and can you say
[21:36] even
[21:37] our Lord even now boy
[21:42] yes I'm facing a time but even now Lord
[21:45] yes I'm facing things as a Christian
[21:49] that I never faced before but even now
[21:51] Lord there's a people that believe that
[21:56] even though we walk through the valley
[21:58] of the shadow of death we're not gonna
[22:01] fear any evil
[22:05] whew why God's with me
[22:11] notice the channel of faith that she had
[22:14] dropped into she allowed all the inlets
[22:17] and the outlets of her spirit ramp to be
[22:21] controlled by faith it allowed her
[22:24] conscience or reasoning or imagination
[22:27] or members her affection to be
[22:29] controlled by faith whoo there's a whole
[22:32] lot of things right there could be
[22:33] preached right here but she allowed all
[22:36] of those things to be controlled by
[22:38] faith you see a lot of times you allow
[22:42] your emotions to get the better of you
[22:43] and you don't allow faith to go in
[22:46] operation but if you can let loose or
[22:49] your emotions one time look past your
[22:52] fear look past your reasonings yeah it
[22:55] looks like Oh hope is gone look past it
[22:57] let your faith operate you see the
[23:04] reason why Satan wants to keep you quiet
[23:05] as he don't want you speaking because
[23:07] when you go to Amen in the word and when
[23:09] you go to speak in the word saying what
[23:11] the word says there is coming out of
[23:13] your mouth come on somebody hey word of
[23:16] power that will with the devil anytime
[23:18] anyplace under any situation but we will
[23:22] not allow we will not allow the enemy to
[23:25] stick a sock in our mouth and shut us up
[23:28] we've been quite too low now's the time
[23:32] to let the word loose
[23:37] it's a time to let faith speak for the
[23:41] impossibilities made your situation
[23:45] named your Mountain give it a good name
[23:49] and watch as it begins to fall
[23:54] [Applause]
[23:58] hallelujah
[23:59] the life walk down there champion but he
[24:02] never walked away they drug him out of
[24:06] there the life has come into our camp
[24:10] but he's not walking away

[27:30] a body brother Adam said it makes a few
[27:38] comments on untapped resources I'll just
[27:40] make a few comments on these but the
[27:43] tree of life has no end to it is that we
[27:46] got untapped resources and you're scared
[27:49] to step out and take God at His Word
[27:51] again he says and here you him all
[27:53] things are possible to them that believe
[27:56] we've got the untapped resources of God

[28:28] drop that but what they lost by Adam it
[28:32] was restored by Christ he said if you
[28:36] say Oh mice is more than just a
[28:40] scripture right here

[28:44] he said if you say look at your
[28:47] neighbor's say if you say God's with us
[28:50] and we're going to see miracles if you
[28:53] say if you say to this mountain be moved

[29:00] believe that what you have said shall
[29:02] come to pass you can have what you said

[34:04] an eagle I was born free but this is a
[34:07] people that do know their God they're
[34:10] not worshiping him in the name of titles
[34:12] this is the people that do not believe
[34:14] in the Trinity but they realize that God
[34:17] displayed himself in Father Son and Holy
[34:21] Ghost they don't think God is three they
[34:24] know God that God is displaying himself
[34:27] and attributes of Father Son and Holy
[34:30] Ghost and now he is displaying himself
[34:33] in a body this is a people that realize
[34:37] that their packing on the inside of

[34:42] of them there's enough power to go out
[34:45] and create a new world wait a minute

[34:50] talking about somebody else besides me
[34:52] no I'm talking about you I'm calling
[34:55] your name tonight that you have the
[34:57] ability by the power of the spoken word
[35:00] to speak conditions out of existence
[35:05] this is what he's brought us to speaking
[35:08] conditions there are people that do know
[35:13] their God and you will be song and you
[35:16] will do exploits who could your neighbor
[35:19] say get ready we will do exploits this
[35:24] is the people that's been baptized in
[35:26] his name that's been called by his name
[35:28] that speak in his name that live in his
[35:31] name that sing in his name that dance in
[35:34] his name that realized there is no help
[35:37] but from God they realize that he's the
[35:40] God that restores our health they
[35:43] realize that this God is a God that
[35:44] gives us our money he's the God that
[35:47] feeds our souls moving right on long as
[36:00] he will praise the Lord anyhow now when
[36:03] God spoke to Moses from a burning bush
[36:05] and Moses went down to Egypt to take
[36:09] over what a sight the Prophet said that
[36:12] when Moses got down there he showed the
[36:15] phenomena because he was God's voice how
[36:21] could a man pick up dust and throw it
[36:23] and say thus saith the Lord not a flea
[36:25] in the country in a couple of hours from
[36:27] me and everything sprouted full of fleas
[36:28] not a fly nowhere at all and he'd say
[36:31] let there be flies and the first thing
[36:33] you know a big old blow fly begin to fly
[36:35] around and there they were bloating the
[36:38] people everywhere
[36:40] what man could do that it was God using
[36:45] that prophet making his word a sign to
[36:47] give a call that were not staying here
[36:50] in Egypt we're going out of Egypt whoo
[36:54] hallelujah but he didn't just send his
[36:57] voice to take them out of Egypt he sent
[36:59] his voice his voice was said to come out
[37:02] of and to go into you coming out of the
[37:05] cosmos and you're being birthed into a
[37:07] new world
[37:08] oh come on somebody brother Barnum said
[37:11] in 1965 that we are at another Ephesians
[37:15] we are coming out of this world and
[37:18] going into that world we have come out
[37:20] we have been separators we've been not
[37:23] particulars but they're unclean things
[37:25] we separate herself from the friends of
[37:28] the world Moses when it come down to the
[37:33] Red Sea the Red Sea was in his way
[37:36] and God said speak to the sea what's in
[37:39] your way they st. Capital Warren what's
[37:42] in your wallet but what's in your way
[37:44] what's in your way you got things that
[37:48] are standing in front of you if it's a
[37:50] sickness that is trying to destroy your
[37:53] pastor it's in your way speak to that
[37:56] sickness in the name of Jesus and you
[37:59] watch that demon fall watch that demon
[38:02] run for cover I'm talking about a people
[38:04] that's not afraid to speak the word it
[38:11] was in his way and he was able to speak
[38:14] to that sea and the sea had to stand at
[38:16] attention as the children of this will
[38:19] walked over because greater was he that
[38:22] was in Moses than he that was in the sea
[38:25] Oh hallelujah and that same God is with
[38:30] us tonight but he's not only with us but
[38:32] he's in us he's proved he was in us
[38:35] because greater is He that is in you
[38:37] than he that is in the world what are
[38:39] you afraid of tonight I'm afraid of

[47:58] some sound doctrine here I'm gonna give
[48:00] you some things that's gonna comfort you
[48:03] because you're gonna walk out of this
[48:05] atmosphere and you're gonna go right
[48:07] back in the layout of cell and somebody
[48:09] its prior gonna flick you the bird
[48:12] you're gonna leave heavenly places and
[48:15] you're gonna go right back to Laodicea
[48:17] believe me it happens I left one time
[48:19] after I got no bridge to the meeting and
[48:21] I thought I was gonna be raptured soon
[48:23] as I pulled out on the freeway
[48:24] lord have mercy that man talked about my
[48:28] mama for a long time it makes you
[48:33] realize that these are still temporal
[48:37] bodies but listen to this is it miracles
[48:42] may take place on a platform and a few
[48:44] days later than maybe the enemy come in
[48:46] he said but look if you've got not
[48:49] brother Branham but if you've got thus
[48:50] saith the Lord
[48:51] just let the storms how the devil can't
[48:55] beat you around on thus saith the Lord
[49:01] you see if all you gather from this
[49:03] meeting tonight is emotion and going
[49:06] through another service if you just
[49:08] gather those things the devil can beat
[49:10] you around on that but if you can take
[49:12] what Jesus had that if your bother me
[49:15] and my words abide in you ask what you
[49:17] will and it shall be given unto you the
[49:19] devil can't beat you around on that
[49:21] because they ain't saw word that's God's
[49:23] Word God's still got a voice and your
[49:27] voice is his voice deities not in heaven
[49:31] but deity is in you and I when God
[49:35] speaks he gives strength when God speaks
[49:37] it's forever settled in heaven when God
[49:39] speaks to you you do what he tells you
[49:42] when God speaks all hell moves that's
[49:44] everything can't stand in his presence
[49:49] there was that voice that changed my
[49:51] life it was how voice that set my course
[49:57] it was that voice and maybe a new
[50:00] creature I was in a car this past Friday
[50:07] there's a stirring I felt the turn-on on
[50:10] a great warrior Joshua just felt
[50:13] something pulsating me to move and look
[50:16] in that direction and I hadn't been in a
[50:18] car by myself maybe about 10 minutes if
[50:21] a cop would've got behind me probably
[50:23] would've pulled me over I hadn't been
[50:27] listening to that message maybe five ten
[50:29] minutes and all of a sudden the Holy
[50:30] Ghost begin to flood that car
[50:31] I hear the prophets say now look if my
[50:34] spirit was as my shadow as a shadow of
[50:37] the material say my shadow would be the
[50:39] spirit of the material in the body
[50:41] supernaturally now the body of the Lord
[50:43] Jesus is a shadow as it was of the
[50:46] natural physical body of the Lord and
[50:48] notice if healings if power-efficient if
[50:52] the things that Christ had in him has
[50:55] gone out of his shadow which you are
[50:57] then Christ is paralyzed
[51:03] if healings if powers visions if these
[51:07] things that Christ had in him has gone
[51:09] out of his shadow in crisis
[51:13] you see that's where the church world
[51:15] has tried to push it off that these
[51:17] things are days gone by but notice he
[51:20] says his natural body sits paralyzed
[51:22] because that if his physical body moves
[51:25] his shadow will have to move with it if
[51:27] we are in Christ by the Holy Ghost
[51:29] baptism and the way that the body of
[51:31] Christ moves it will move the same way
[51:34] on earth for this is a shadow of his
[51:36] body a man always been in figurative
[51:40] types and and it is tonight the body of
[51:43] the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:44] now notice now taking it out of the
[51:46] things of the world the body
[51:49] predestinated by God cold of God elected
[51:54] by God chosen of God saved by God
[51:58] baptized into the body of Christ by the
[52:00] Holy Spirit and made members of this
[52:02] body now I want you to know what titles
[52:05] he gives to the body or live ready and
[52:09] willing come on somebody you are not a
[52:13] people that are paralyzing Christ but
[52:16] you are people that's on your feet
[52:19] that's walking to the beat of the sheet
[52:22] music your sounded and out your becoming
[52:25] on the word you are the written pistils
[52:28] read of all men come on somebody you're
[52:33] alive you're alive ready and willing my
[52:36] shadow will move every time anything my
[52:38] body moves and the Holy Spirit body of
[52:40] Christ will move just as Christ moves
[52:43] and if Christ in heaven can ever get a
[52:46] spiritual body on earth moving as he
[52:49] wants you to move watch watch for things
[52:55] to happen it's become it's beginning to
[52:59] come to life they've paralyzed it long
[53:01] enough but the Holy Spirit is bringing
[53:05] it to life bringing life into it and
[53:07] it's beginning to wake up and beginning
[53:09] to move and because it sees its position
[53:14] these problems can live again prophesy
[53:18] thou son of man and I've heard a noise
[53:20] and a rattling
[53:21] and those bones come together you are
[53:26] the people of the book hallelujah
[53:32] prophesy that son of man these things
[53:35] are for you
[53:39] [Applause]

[53:46] trying to push us in a corner us push
[53:47] him in a corner let's push him in a
[53:50] corner let's push him so much in a

[58:47] climbed up Calvary's Hill you whipped
[58:50] him there Satan has to recognize you
[58:53] because he's encountered the one that's
[58:55] living on the inside of you before and
[58:57] year of God little children and greater
[59:00] is he that is in you than he that is in
[59:02] the world oh that was in crisis in me

[59:21] speak it's a time to go forward when
[59:24] they're well tell me when word was there
[59:26] every time at sound of this time when
[59:29] was the time that the sons of God was
[59:31] ever to be manifested outside of this
[59:33] time now this ministry is joining him

[1:00:08] with massage signs 1960 adoption now
[1:00:19] this way does choke you to death but did
[1:00:23] you know that men that are sons of God
[1:00:25] are a mature God's how many ever know
[1:00:29] that how many knows that Jesus said so
[1:00:31] that the Bible Jesus said did not your
[1:00:33] law say it itself that ye are God's and
[1:00:37] if you call them God's what's God said
[1:00:39] in Genesis 2 that they were God's
[1:00:41] because they have full domain over the
[1:00:43] Dominion of the world he give him
[1:00:45] dominion over all things and he lost his
[1:00:48] sonship
[1:00:49] he lost his God ship he lost his sonship
[1:00:51] he lost his domain and Satan took it
[1:00:54] over
[1:00:54] but brother we are waiting on the
[1:00:57] manifestation of the sons of God who
[1:00:59] will come back and take it over again
[1:01:01] waiting for the fullness of time when
[1:01:03] the pyramid gets up to the top when the
[1:01:06] full sons of God will be manifested when
[1:01:09] the power of God will walk out
[1:01:10] hallelujah and we'll take every power
[1:01:12] that Satan's got away from him yes sir
[1:01:14] it belongs to him this is the hour when
[1:01:18] the power of God will walk out and take
[1:01:21] every power of Satan away from him I
[1:01:26] have just read to you the greatest quote
[1:01:29] that you'll hear all year if you can put
[1:01:31] this into action doing the power of God
[1:01:34] we'll walk out and throw the power of
[1:01:36] Satan away we're not waiting for it
[1:01:39] we're here we've arrived now are we sons
[1:01:43] of God he swore by himself
[1:01:47] we're waiting for a time and here we are
[1:01:51] we're at the top of the pyramid were at
[1:01:54] the last stage and we are here walking
[1:01:57] out and taking every power away from
[1:01:59] Satan away from him now Satan is a
[1:02:07] deceiver and don't you ever
[1:02:10] underestimate him because he slick and
[1:02:14] he smooth he'll sleeping in such a way
[1:02:17] that you won't even recognize him but I
[1:02:21] want you to realize that legally Satan
[1:02:25] has no power he has no power because all
[1:02:30] of his power was stripped away from him
[1:02:32] that day on Calvary oh if you could just
[1:02:36] go back and listen to that day on
[1:02:38] Calvary it'll set your soul flying but
[1:02:41] if you can realize that all his power is
[1:02:43] is bluffing Satan has no power only as
[1:02:47] he can Bluff with it if he can Bluff you
[1:02:50] into it all right you'll have to have it
[1:02:52] ain't that a bad deal that he has no
[1:02:57] power but all the power that he has is
[1:03:00] just a bluff it's just a lot he's
[1:03:04] calling your handle and the only power
[1:03:07] that Satan has is to get you to believe
[1:03:10] his life you see why Satan is scared of
[1:03:16] you because we have the answer to the
[1:03:19] devil's question we are as sons of God
[1:03:23] right now now I know it'd be pretty
[1:03:31] amazing to watch this tonight if you
[1:03:33] could watch it in that
[1:03:35] but this is a spiritual battle but if
[1:03:38] you could watch this literally take
[1:03:40] place if you could watch sister Brenda
[1:03:44] Klein come up here and we got a ten-foot
[1:03:48] 10-foot time that's standing in front of
[1:03:51] us maybe I don't know sister Brenda like
[1:03:54] I do
[1:03:56] but I know when it comes down to it

[1:04:01] there's a whole lot of fighters have
[1:04:03] been here y'all heard y'all didn't hear
[1:04:06] that on the internet but there's a
[1:04:07] mmm-hmm we know who we are
[1:04:12] and we ain't scared got a little bit of
[1:04:15] attitude with it you imagine this was
[1:04:23] put a ten-foot man up here and all of
[1:04:25] his strength and all of his power and
[1:04:27] sister Brenda comes up here and grabs
[1:04:30] ahold of him and takes all of his
[1:04:32] strength and all of his power and throws
[1:04:35] it in the flask we tried the trash can
[1:04:38] man that would be awesome I'm telling
[1:04:40] you right now pay good money to watch a
[1:04:42] 10-foot man be defeated by a little
[1:04:46] little lady like sister Brenda just calm
[1:04:49] and collected I pay good money to watch
[1:04:51] that but you know I come here every
[1:04:54] Saturday and Sunday night and I don't
[1:04:55] have to pay good money to watch it but I
[1:04:58] watch sons and daughters of God walk up
[1:05:01] to a 10 foot child and take all of his
[1:05:04] power away from him and remind him who
[1:05:06] he is that he is a tool in God's hand
[1:05:09] and he can't touch one hair of my head
[1:05:11] unless God gives him privilege and
[1:05:15] anointing and allows him to do it
[1:05:17] there's a people I said not today Satan

[1:06:12] she was and she wasn't afraid of the bat
[1:06:15] oh if you can look at safety when he
