[55:09] amen today is an anniversary for me
[55:12] today is the day two years ago that
[55:14] brother kelly hildebrant came
[55:16] and handed me this coin
[55:19] and
[55:20] satan had tried to stop the visitation
[55:22] and him coming
[55:24] and two years ago and it's a
[55:26] commemorative coin with a piece of grain
[55:28] of sand on it of d-day we didn't realize
[55:31] what a war that we was going to go
[55:33] through
[55:34] and on the back of it says
[55:37] we will accept nothing less
[55:40] than full victory
[55:42] [Music]
[55:50] amen
[55:52] amen
[55:54] you know
[55:55] that's what we're doing too
[55:58] amen
[55:59] when the doctors tell you they don't
[56:00] have another patient doing what you're
[56:02] doing it's kind of a nice it's kind of a
[56:05] nice thing so
[56:06] amen appreciate your prayers for us for
[56:08] doing this two years
[56:10] and uh but we're still moving we're
[56:13] still going forward and so
[56:15] amen today i just have something on my
[56:18] heart that's very close to my heart i
[56:20] had a visitation with the lord
[56:23] sometime back
[56:24] and these words were spoken to me
[56:27] see past what you see
[56:30] think past what you think
[56:34] i haven't actually spoke a sermon from
[56:36] that and the lord just just gave me some
[56:39] some some insight to some things and so
[56:42] i would just i would just ask you that
[56:44] you would just help me today as we look
[56:47] to the word and we realize that faith
[56:50] looks past what we naturally see with
[56:52] our eyes
[56:54] because everything you see with your
[56:56] eyes is temporal
[56:59] i want to say this just real quickly to
[57:01] you i don't care what problem you're in
[57:04] today
[57:07] every situation that you're in
[57:11] that is causing you so much grief and
[57:14] turmoil and woe
[57:16] and anxiety and blood pressure issues
[57:20] and
[57:20] all kinds of ups and downs in your life
[57:24] it's just stuff
[57:28] it's just stuff
[57:31] and i want to remind you and this is
[57:32] really hard for all of us to do is look
[57:35] past what you
[57:38] see look past what you see
[57:42] my father is slipping into a dementia
[57:45] state
[57:46] and and as he's as he's making some
[57:49] slips there's days or moments to where
[57:50] he's very clear there's days that he's
[57:52] not clear you got to look past what you
[57:55] see
[57:57] this is just a very temporary realm
[58:00] just a couple of weeks ago we were
[58:01] standing here with brother harold at the
[58:03] at the podium and praying with him
[58:06] knowing a storm was coming
[58:09] but god knows that we see past what we
[58:12] see even in a hospital bed
[58:14] if we could just see where he's at today
[58:19] i want to share a quote with you before
[58:21] we go to hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1.
[58:26] this present
[58:27] this present earth
[58:30] in its condition
[58:33] at its
[58:34] best the cl is the closest the redeemed
[58:39] will ever come to hell
[58:43] that's quite a statement
[58:50] if this is as close as i'll ever come to
[58:52] hell that's quite a spot
[58:58] but for the sinner
[59:00] i want you to really grab this
[59:03] but for the sinner it is the closest
[59:06] they will ever come to heaven amen
[59:13] our stay here on this earth is in its
[59:16] fallen condition
[59:17] is only a place of preparation
[59:22] getting us ready to go to a place where
[59:24] we really
[59:26] live
[59:28] hallelujah
[59:31] god help us today
[59:33] amen hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1.
[59:37] now faith is the substance of things
[59:39] hoped for the evidence of things not
[59:42] seen
[59:43] i want you to read that with me now
[59:46] faith is the substance of things hoped
[59:49] for
[59:50] the evidence
[59:52] of things not seen
[59:55] now this is an action scripture
[59:58] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:00:01] report
[1:00:03] through faith we understand that the
[1:00:05] worlds were framed by the word of god
[1:00:09] so that things which are seen were not
[1:00:13] made of things which do appear
[1:00:15] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[1:00:18] excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:00:21] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:00:24] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[1:00:27] and by it
[1:00:30] he being dead
[1:00:32] yet speaketh
[1:00:35] if you think on that's quite a that's
[1:00:36] quite a statement
[1:00:38] though he's not in this realm that we
[1:00:40] can see
[1:00:41] his life still speaks
[1:00:45] by faith enoch was translated that he
[1:00:47] should not
[1:00:49] see death
[1:00:51] and was not found
[1:00:53] because god had translated to him
[1:00:57] for before his translation he had this
[1:00:59] testimony that he pleased god
[1:01:03] by faith it is impossible
[1:01:07] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:01:10] please him
[1:01:11] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:01:14] that he is
[1:01:16] and that he is a rewarder
[1:01:19] of them that diligently
[1:01:21] seek him
[1:01:23] by faith noah being warned of god of
[1:01:26] things
[1:01:27] that are not seen as yet moved with fear
[1:01:30] prepared an ark
[1:01:32] to the saving of his house
[1:01:35] by which he condemned the world the
[1:01:38] saving of his house condemned the world
[1:01:42] that and became an heir of the righteous
[1:01:45] which is by faith by faith abraham when
[1:01:48] he was called to go out into a place
[1:01:51] which he should after receive for an
[1:01:53] inheritance obeyed and he went out
[1:01:56] not knowing where he went
[1:01:59] by faith he sojourned in a land of
[1:02:02] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[1:02:06] in tabernacles with isaac and jacob and
[1:02:08] the heirs
[1:02:10] with him in the same promise
[1:02:12] for he looked for a city
[1:02:15] that hath foundations
[1:02:18] whose builder and makeup
[1:02:20] is god
[1:02:24] in revelations chapter 3 and verse 16
[1:02:32] now he's talking to our age
[1:02:35] laodicea
[1:02:38] so you can if you can just capture my
[1:02:40] theme just for a moment see past what
[1:02:42] you see
[1:02:44] and he said so then because thou art
[1:02:47] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot
[1:02:50] i will spew thee out of thy mouth
[1:02:53] because thou sayest i am rich and
[1:02:55] increase with goods and have need of
[1:02:57] nothing
[1:02:58] we live in an age to where the church
[1:03:00] thinks they don't need god
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] we live in an age where people think i
[1:03:07] don't have any need of god
[1:03:10] we've got governments that don't have
[1:03:12] any need of god
[1:03:14] the constitution is nothing anymore the
[1:03:17] bible the ten commandments is nothing
[1:03:19] anymore
[1:03:21] they don't want god
[1:03:28] and know us not that thou art wretched
[1:03:33] miserable
[1:03:35] and poor
[1:03:37] and blind
[1:03:40] and naked
[1:03:42] and let me just say this to you there's
[1:03:44] another place that's going to be naked
[1:03:47] hell
[1:03:51] everybody's naked in hell
[1:03:55] i counseled thee to buy me gold
[1:03:58] tried in the fire that they all must be
[1:04:01] rich
[1:04:02] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:04:04] clothed
[1:04:06] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:04:08] not appear
[1:04:09] because heaven is not a naked place
[1:04:14] and anoint thine eyes
[1:04:18] with isaf
[1:04:20] that thou mayest see
[1:04:22] jesus would make this statement and it'd
[1:04:24] be very good blessed are your eyes for
[1:04:27] you see
[1:04:30] and i want to say this to this audience
[1:04:32] blessed are your eyes
[1:04:37] for they say
[1:04:39] he bypassed a million
[1:04:41] to pick you
[1:04:43] he opened your eyes and blinded
[1:04:45] everybody else
[1:04:49] quite a statement quite a start
[1:04:51] amen quite a start so sitting in this
[1:04:53] building is quite a nice place to be
[1:04:55] amen let's pray lord jesus
[1:04:59] we feel your presence even now
[1:05:02] we ask you that you would anoint this
[1:05:03] audience
[1:05:05] lord and this group of people
[1:05:07] may you speak to us in a very
[1:05:09] supernatural way
[1:05:11] lord as i as a speaker i ask have asked
[1:05:13] all morning to get myself out of the way
[1:05:16] to step beyond the mortal realm of
[1:05:18] troubles
[1:05:19] mortality of of different things that's
[1:05:23] attacking my body even today
[1:05:26] and i ask you that i can step beyond all
[1:05:28] of that
[1:05:29] and step into your realm
[1:05:31] minister to these people we pray in
[1:05:34] jesus name amen and amen
[1:05:37] you may be seated
[1:05:44] brother andrew finished last night with
[1:05:46] the guards to the book of life
[1:05:48] matthew mark and luke and john
[1:05:51] they have a responsibility
[1:05:54] to
[1:05:54] if you can just take these words blessed
[1:05:57] are your eyes that you see
[1:05:59] this book is an open book
[1:06:02] to the believer the bible is the most
[1:06:06] powerful book that there is
[1:06:08] within a sentence it can literally
[1:06:11] change your life
[1:06:13] uh
[1:06:14] in many different directions almost
[1:06:16] every day you can find us literally a
[1:06:19] scripture in the bible that speaks
[1:06:21] volumes
[1:06:23] lay in there for all your life and then
[1:06:25] all of a sudden that scripture will be
[1:06:27] speak volumes to you in your life
[1:06:30] matthew mark and luke and john are the
[1:06:32] four disciples that are going to that
[1:06:34] are going to be the guards to the book
[1:06:36] of life now they're anointed
[1:06:39] as brother andrew was saying last night
[1:06:41] they're anointed from the throne of god
[1:06:44] they will not only they'll do twofold
[1:06:46] purpose they will guard the book of life
[1:06:49] which is the book of acts
[1:06:51] which is the holy ghost or the life of
[1:06:54] jesus christ living on the inside of the
[1:06:57] believer
[1:07:00] book is more than a historical reference
[1:07:02] book
[1:07:03] but it's an action book being a
[1:07:05] christian is more than quoting psalms or
[1:07:08] quoting scriptures or dressing a certain
[1:07:11] way there's a lot of people dressed
[1:07:13] certain ways
[1:07:15] i was i was standing in in geneva in
[1:07:18] switzerland and i as i watched the jews
[1:07:21] walk past and i i watched it was a they
[1:07:24] had a they had a great conference there
[1:07:27] and the jewish old order and i don't
[1:07:29] want to say anything
[1:07:31] uh irreverent here but they were dressed
[1:07:34] in their curls and they were dressed in
[1:07:36] their their their jewish attire
[1:07:39] and their long robes and all of this and
[1:07:42] they were going and and it was just
[1:07:44] hundreds of them that was going in this
[1:07:47] direction and they were just walking
[1:07:49] they were just making their way they had
[1:07:51] they
[1:07:52] you know there was i don't know how many
[1:07:53] thousand people
[1:07:55] was in but they had the attention of the
[1:07:57] airport
[1:08:00] and i thought to myself
[1:08:02] you missed jesus
[1:08:05] you've got your long robes and you've
[1:08:07] got all of this but you miss jesus
[1:08:12] and i stood there and i i i had a great
[1:08:15] awe from one realm i i looked and i saw
[1:08:18] this religious order as it walked past
[1:08:23] no doubt they may be the same people
[1:08:25] that will kill
[1:08:27] the two prophets that come back
[1:08:30] and tell them about who jesus was
[1:08:43] this is more than a book
[1:08:46] it has the very breath of life
[1:08:49] and as matthew is standing there and he
[1:08:51] writes
[1:08:53] go ye into all the world to teach and
[1:08:55] preach all nations
[1:08:58] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:09:01] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[1:09:04] and he writes it in such a way i like
[1:09:07] how the prophet tells us he said he
[1:09:10] wrote it in such a way that it blinded
[1:09:12] the whole world
[1:09:15] being a guard to acts 2 and verse 38.
[1:09:20] that we're going to baptize today being
[1:09:22] a guard he kept the whole religious
[1:09:25] world
[1:09:26] from seeing the deity of jesus christ
[1:09:30] because if you ever truly see the deity
[1:09:32] of jesus christ you'll see yourself
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:42] and there you are
[1:09:44] and you can't help but see it
[1:09:46] so he makes sure that you see it
[1:09:49] but he makes sure the world don't see it
[1:10:06] hope you don't mind i'm going to take my
[1:10:07] time just for a bit
[1:10:12] do you see that guard
[1:10:17] with your natural eye no way you can see
[1:10:19] it
[1:10:22] but with your spiritual eye
[1:10:24] no way you can miss it
[1:10:28] you see we become guardians
[1:10:31] of the revelation
[1:10:35] there's some things that just too sacred
[1:10:38] hardy to even say
[1:10:48] i want to just share a few quotes with
[1:10:50] you
[1:10:50] just to kind of give you where i want to
[1:10:52] be at
[1:10:54] brother brown says look at the
[1:10:56] indifference of people today
[1:11:00] look how unconcerned that they are
[1:11:04] they're eating they're drinking
[1:11:06] they're given in marriage
[1:11:09] just as it was predicted
[1:11:12] they have a form of godliness
[1:11:15] but they deny the power thereof
[1:11:18] the bible says from from such turn away
[1:11:23] very religious
[1:11:25] they're always been very religious
[1:11:28] but not having the spiritual insight to
[1:11:31] understanding
[1:11:33] that's the main thing
[1:11:35] that's the thing that
[1:11:37] designates
[1:11:39] your eternal destination
[1:11:43] is spiritual
[1:11:45] conception
[1:11:47] now watch this watch what he does with
[1:11:49] this what if pharaoh would have known
[1:11:52] that the emancipator of egypt
[1:11:56] he was sending him out into a desert and
[1:11:59] chasing him
[1:12:02] it would have been different
[1:12:06] but he didn't have spiritual
[1:12:08] understanding that the moses had
[1:12:12] nor could he understand the attitude
[1:12:15] that moses had taken
[1:12:18] for why would this man with the world at
[1:12:20] his hands
[1:12:22] would reject it and walk out into a
[1:12:24] desert with a bunch of disobedient
[1:12:27] people
[1:12:29] why he was considered a fanatic
[1:12:32] a quack
[1:12:34] tens of thousands no doubt laughing at
[1:12:37] him but his conviction of his spiritual
[1:12:40] insight that by faith he saw the god of
[1:12:44] promise
[1:12:46] there was moses looking out the same
[1:12:49] window as pharaoh
[1:12:52] but seeing two complete different worlds
[1:12:58] and when jesus stood on the earth he was
[1:13:00] the greatest witness that god ever had
[1:13:04] for there was the fullness of god in him
[1:13:07] and when he began to do the works of god
[1:13:11] they began to call him beelzebub
[1:13:14] the devil
[1:13:17] judging the spirit of god that was in
[1:13:19] him
[1:13:20] saying it was the devil
[1:13:23] that was performing the miracles
[1:13:29] quite a difference in it
[1:13:31] i shared this just a few moments ago
[1:13:34] when jesus was here
[1:13:36] the world was in chaos
[1:13:39] governments were in chaos
[1:13:42] and here was the redeemer of all of the
[1:13:45] earth
[1:13:47] the greatest man that would ever live
[1:13:50] and jerusalem was upside down
[1:13:56] roman government was over them
[1:13:58] listen politics was at its worst
[1:14:04] and they were turning down
[1:14:06] this heretic
[1:14:08] and screaming the very people that only
[1:14:11] a week before was screaming hosanna to
[1:14:14] the king
[1:14:15] under the power of politics
[1:14:19] of the church
[1:14:22] begin to scream
[1:14:23] crucify him
[1:14:29] under the backdrop
[1:14:33] of a world in chaos
[1:14:36] jesus gave his life
[1:14:40] when the seals were revealed in 1963
[1:14:46] and god was open in the bible
[1:14:49] to the world
[1:14:52] and he was opening up
[1:14:54] who the great harlot was
[1:14:56] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[1:14:58] christ
[1:15:00] he was opening up his redemptions plan
[1:15:03] who is worthy who is the bride and i
[1:15:05] could go on
[1:15:08] and and he was he was going to unfold
[1:15:12] the mysteries of himself and actually
[1:15:15] yourself
[1:15:17] and in the the backdrop of that
[1:15:20] john f kennedy has been assassinated
[1:15:24] the world is in chaos the vietnam war
[1:15:28] and all of the turmoil and the people in
[1:15:30] the streets malcolm x is is preaching
[1:15:33] his nonsense
[1:15:36] martin luther king is on his way
[1:15:39] men are being washed with vi with
[1:15:41] literally fire hoses
[1:15:46] elvis presley is on the scene
[1:15:49] he is shaking the world with rock and
[1:15:52] roll
[1:15:53] all of the guys that were with him the
[1:15:55] beatles come on the scene they're coming
[1:15:57] from europe and they're singing songs
[1:16:00] inspired right out of the river of
[1:16:02] euphrates
[1:16:05] right out of hell
[1:16:09] are you with me now
[1:16:11] the world was picking on its drug scene
[1:16:14] hollywood was at its pits
[1:16:19] and at the very same time
[1:16:22] the word was being revealed to the bride
[1:16:24] of jesus christ
[1:16:27] listen this word is not to the world
[1:16:32] it's not to the world
[1:16:34] it's to a select group of people
[1:16:38] it blinds their eyes
[1:16:40] and it opens your eyes
[1:16:46] the bride's revival is going on
[1:16:49] the world knows nothing about it
[1:16:52] the character of jesus christ is
[1:16:55] displayed in a people
[1:16:57] it's not something you put on something
[1:16:59] that you manufacture it's not coming
[1:17:02] from the personality of a man
[1:17:05] are you with me
[1:17:07] it's across the world everywhere
[1:17:14] god has a people on the scene
[1:17:17] we've got scoffers
[1:17:20] we've got make believers
[1:17:22] we've got we've got a lot of different
[1:17:24] different facets
[1:17:26] and the world is again in chaos
[1:17:31] i don't know about you but i dread
[1:17:34] listening to the news
[1:17:39] and if i stop for a moment it would
[1:17:41] cause me to be a bit nervous and maniac
[1:17:45] to think about what's happened to our
[1:17:47] godly nation
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:52] are you with me
[1:17:53] many scream in the charismatic world
[1:17:55] there's going to come a revival they
[1:17:57] missed the revival
[1:18:00] they missed their visitation
[1:18:05] you sow to the wind you reap a whirlwind
[1:18:10] men think that they have the answer
[1:18:11] there's only one that has an answer and
[1:18:13] that's jesus
[1:18:16] the prophet says when i'm when a man
[1:18:18] once catches the vision
[1:18:21] of an invincible god invisible god
[1:18:25] and know that he's always presence
[1:18:27] there's something
[1:18:29] that stabilizes that man's thinking
[1:18:33] it stabilizes his actions
[1:18:36] in the time of distress and trouble
[1:18:40] it'll still make him look upward
[1:18:43] beyond above the things that are
[1:18:46] happening around him
[1:18:48] let me just say this to you you got to
[1:18:50] raise your head
[1:18:52] above everything that's around you
[1:18:57] the challenge of this day it's not
[1:18:59] acting like a world or becoming one of
[1:19:02] the world
[1:19:03] it's raising your head
[1:19:08] me just say raising your head above your
[1:19:10] normal
[1:19:12] problems that you have around you raise
[1:19:15] your head above it
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:22] for two years you've watched the journey
[1:19:24] take place
[1:19:29] you've watched the journey take place
[1:19:30] your pastor
[1:19:33] your
[1:19:35] watched him
[1:19:37] go through one of the
[1:19:39] death cycles
[1:19:42] watched cancer in the brain cancer in
[1:19:44] the in the in the lungs cancer in the
[1:19:47] lymph
[1:19:48] nodes her doctor's reports
[1:19:53] but if there's any example that i can
[1:19:55] give you you got to raise your head
[1:19:57] above
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:20:02] it you with me and it's very difficult
[1:20:06] when you're the man in the arena
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:10] you've heard sermons like the man in the
[1:20:12] arena you've heard champion you've heard
[1:20:15] those things that were inspired from
[1:20:17] very dark hours
[1:20:21] and it was in a very dark hour that the
[1:20:23] lord came to me in in my bedroom
[1:20:27] and i saw a man standing there and i
[1:20:29] stepped up out of the bed
[1:20:31] and he just took me like a father would
[1:20:33] to a son and he just turned
[1:20:35] hands on my shoulders
[1:20:37] kind of across my back
[1:20:39] and and i just watched the vision happen
[1:20:42] and let me just this is going to be the
[1:20:44] first time i've shared this
[1:20:45] but in that vision
[1:20:47] i i saw i saw a city look like a total
[1:20:52] chaos
[1:20:53] total destruction
[1:20:57] i'll mention some names here i hope
[1:20:58] that's all right i saw this team of men
[1:21:02] that sat here with us at work
[1:21:05] i saw thomas
[1:21:07] my brother-in-law
[1:21:08] i saw harold
[1:21:10] my other brother-in-law
[1:21:12] each one having construction helmets on
[1:21:16] and we were working
[1:21:18] and it seemed like it
[1:21:20] it seemed like the more we worked the
[1:21:22] more we destroyed
[1:21:25] and i just i just looked at it
[1:21:31] and i thought what a chaos why is he
[1:21:34] showing me this
[1:21:35] and the words were whispered
[1:21:38] see past
[1:21:40] what you see
[1:21:45] and then the vision changed
[1:21:47] it became the most beautiful city
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:53] i've ever seen in my life
[1:22:06] i'm not expecting you to believe
[1:22:08] that or even jump into it and say
[1:22:12] i'm working on something that looks
[1:22:13] chaotic
[1:22:15] but it's actually eternal
[1:22:21] but i was there
[1:22:24] i want to i want to just take you just
[1:22:26] for a moment
[1:22:28] i just shared a supernatural experience
[1:22:32] very supernatural that's meant much
[1:22:41] how a vision works
[1:22:46] it was a meeting in oslo
[1:22:50] brother branham is that
[1:22:53] brother brandon was standing on a very
[1:22:55] tall stage
[1:23:00] and there was a little girl
[1:23:04] that they were trying to get in the
[1:23:05] prayer line
[1:23:07] and she was just a wee little thing
[1:23:11] and they picked that little girl up
[1:23:13] and just put her right in front of
[1:23:14] brother branham no other way would they
[1:23:16] have got her there
[1:23:18] and they put her right in front of
[1:23:19] brother branham and he's i'm just going
[1:23:20] to put a couple things together brother
[1:23:22] branham was afraid that she would fall
[1:23:24] off of that tall stage
[1:23:27] so he reached
[1:23:29] to grab her
[1:23:32] and the the interpreter begins to talk
[1:23:35] to her
[1:23:36] and she was mumbling off something she
[1:23:39] said i want to meet the man that's going
[1:23:41] to pray for me
[1:23:44] she the little little girl was blind
[1:23:48] and the interpreter said that's him
[1:23:50] that's got a hold of you
[1:23:52] and she moved the little hands by the
[1:23:54] way and you hear brother branham say it
[1:23:56] another place he said she wrapped her
[1:23:58] hands around her his hands
[1:24:01] one because it looked like she was going
[1:24:03] to fall off the stage
[1:24:05] but another
[1:24:12] and she moved her little hands by the
[1:24:13] way and i i had this very same suit on
[1:24:18] that was given to me about six years ago
[1:24:20] in oslo
[1:24:21] he said and she put her little arms
[1:24:24] around me like that and laid her head
[1:24:26] over on my shoulder and i thought
[1:24:30] she's like my little girl becky
[1:24:34] and i stroked her little long plaits
[1:24:36] like that and i thought poor little
[1:24:38] thing
[1:24:39] i heard her snubbing like a child on my
[1:24:41] bosom and i raised her head up and her
[1:24:44] eyes were white
[1:24:46] looking at her little face as she leaned
[1:24:49] back like that on my arm
[1:24:52] and thereby the grace of god
[1:24:55] i saw a vision come forth
[1:24:58] this little girl i seen her laying in
[1:25:00] her mother's arms
[1:25:02] watch now this is and takes him
[1:25:04] somewhere
[1:25:05] i seen her laying in her mother's arm
[1:25:07] and the doctor looking at her and she
[1:25:09] was blind from birth
[1:25:11] tall thin mother
[1:25:14] with blonde hair i see her father a
[1:25:17] short heavyset man with dark hair
[1:25:21] where they were
[1:25:23] and the speaking of the vision and the
[1:25:26] mother was sitting in the audience and
[1:25:29] the father back there
[1:25:31] under
[1:25:32] many thousands and thousands and
[1:25:35] thousands of people sitting back there
[1:25:37] and when i looked
[1:25:39] i said now of course
[1:25:41] i have no power
[1:25:44] what is it it was an atmosphere
[1:25:49] it was shekinah was the one that was
[1:25:52] giving this thing and i looked and i saw
[1:25:55] that little girl was going like a shadow
[1:25:58] out of this little girl was going
[1:26:00] walking along with her hands up looking
[1:26:02] around looking toward and pointing at
[1:26:05] things and i knew that god of heaven
[1:26:08] lived and reigned and i pulled her over
[1:26:10] and i prayed for her raised her up
[1:26:14] and she was looking at me her little eye
[1:26:17] scaring and sparkling
[1:26:21] she mumbled off something the translator
[1:26:23] looked down and said brother branham she
[1:26:25] can see
[1:26:27] and i said keep it to yourself
[1:26:31] just a minute
[1:26:33] what's she saying
[1:26:37] she's asking what are those things up
[1:26:39] there
[1:26:40] it was lights
[1:26:43] and when the translator heard
[1:26:45] and and she was close enough to her
[1:26:48] mother
[1:26:49] and heard her the voice and the rest of
[1:26:52] them
[1:26:52] and she looked up and she began weeping
[1:26:55] out loud
[1:26:56] and her mother was so excited the
[1:26:59] influence
[1:27:01] had took over the whole building
[1:27:04] there set thousands and thousands of
[1:27:06] people under a room
[1:27:10] and this little girl
[1:27:12] they saved her from stumbling and they
[1:27:14] placed her in the right spot
[1:27:18] god knows how to put you in the right
[1:27:21] spot
[1:27:31] that whole building was under that
[1:27:32] heavenly
[1:27:34] influence i want you to listen to what
[1:27:36] the prophet said he said the devil
[1:27:40] was paralyzed
[1:27:47] i pray this morning
[1:27:50] that every critic
[1:27:55] every spirit of unbelief
[1:27:58] would be paralyzed
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:18] you like that quote
[1:28:25] now let's go to another
[1:28:26] place he said you're attending this
[1:28:29] revival
[1:28:32] god has done everything in the book for
[1:28:33] you

[1:28:55] we've seen divine healing take place
[1:28:58] people with heart trouble
[1:29:01] different disease is healed
[1:29:03] we've seen the angel of god come down
[1:29:05] and go through the building just like
[1:29:08] just like he said just before the coming
[1:29:10] of the lord would be
[1:29:12] the discerning of spirits
[1:29:15] and things
[1:29:17] prophetic utterances
[1:29:20] went forth
[1:29:21] people spoke in tongues they prophesied
[1:29:26] and vindicated the word back and forth
[1:29:30] you've seen it and set
[1:29:34] now watch what he does with that he
[1:29:35] reminds them of what god's happened
[1:29:37] happened in that meeting
[1:29:39] and i want to remind you today
[1:29:41] what we've seen
[1:29:45] not just in this service but the decades
[1:29:48] we've seen it
[1:29:49] we've seen the dead raised we've seen
[1:29:52] cancers delivered we've seen heart
[1:29:55] situations taken care of we've seen
[1:29:57] marriages be fixed
[1:30:00] we we we have seen the worst drug
[1:30:03] addicts be turned to real gentlemen
[1:30:07] we've seen women that were of
[1:30:10] of a different nature i'll just put it
[1:30:12] like that
[1:30:14] become ladies of grace
[1:30:16] we've seen children rise and become
[1:30:19] pillars
[1:30:20] not just of a community but pillars of
[1:30:23] the church
[1:30:29] brother brown amasses that audience he
[1:30:31] said
[1:30:33] which choose
[1:30:35] which
[1:30:36] you choose tonight

[1:30:48] to give a reason someday
[1:30:52] what then
[1:30:56] that quote kept coming back to me
[1:30:59] this
[1:31:00] week as it kept coming back to me
[1:31:04] i thought god you must you must have
[1:31:06] something on your your mind
[1:31:08] if this keeps resonating and coming back
[1:31:11] to me
[1:31:12] and then he dropped this in my heart
[1:31:15] this morning
[1:31:22] you're sitting here
[1:31:24] and there's people in another realm

[1:31:58] another service
[1:32:07] the people that stood outside of the ark
[1:32:10] and made fun
[1:32:14] as they listened to that preacher for
[1:32:16] 120 years
[1:32:19] they'd give it all to be in that ark

[1:32:27] prophetically and i want it to be a
[1:32:29] sounding board right here this morning
[1:32:33] there's people that are sitting here
[1:32:34] this morning
[1:32:36] that would give it all if they would
[1:32:38] have only woke up in this service
[1:32:41] and their eyes come open and say that's
[1:32:44] the truth

[1:32:57] because i'm sitting here i got news for
[1:33:00] you he gave me that before you ever even
[1:33:02] got in this building

[1:34:32] to be in this service
[1:34:40] eight hours
[1:34:41] to be in this service

[1:45:05] appointments and i had to go

[1:45:34] your prayer request
[1:45:36] and you said
[1:45:37] my mother
[1:45:41] and if you tilt your head to the right
[1:45:44] you'll see what you were

[1:46:09] are you with me i'm just struggling
[1:46:11] right now to try to get you on board
[1:46:13] it was just only a few months ago
[1:46:16] something began to drive me
[1:46:18] we need new chairs in this building
[1:46:21] we need seating capacity in this
[1:46:23] building
[1:46:26] i had people ask me
[1:46:28] why
[1:46:30] because you're going to need it
[1:46:34] are you with me
[1:46:36] god's got hungry children
[1:46:38] and hungry children if they're not

[1:47:05] i'm just about done but i don't want to
[1:47:07] miss something there's something i want
[1:47:09] to
[1:47:09] i want to get
[1:47:13] help my lord find it
[1:47:20] you okay
[1:47:23] okay
[1:47:27] whether you know it i'm going past 30 40
[1:47:29] minutes real quick for you here so
[1:47:32] just give me just a second
[1:47:42] you nervous brother ron
[1:47:44] no
[1:47:45] you'd be nervous if i was still here two
[1:47:47] hours from now
[1:47:59] the scripture tells us that when
[1:48:00] melchizedek was sitting with abraham
[1:48:07] four generations later was a boy named
[1:48:11] levi
[1:48:12] born
[1:48:16] four generations
[1:48:18] and abraham
[1:48:20] is setting with
[1:48:22] melchizedek
[1:48:25] and melchizedek receives tithes
[1:48:30] from levi that's right
[1:48:34] and just to catch your attention here
[1:48:35] just for a moment you remember when
[1:48:37] brother branham was sitting on a log
[1:48:38] with brother biskell
[1:48:42] and
[1:48:43] and brother branham asked
[1:48:46] brother bischo have you heard anointed
[1:48:48] ones of the end time
[1:48:50] and brother brother biscuit said i was
[1:48:52] embarrassed but i told him no i haven't
[1:48:54] heard it he said i'm glad i told him no
[1:48:57] he hadn't preached it yet
[1:49:05] it'll be three years later
[1:49:08] but that eternal realm
[1:49:11] time is is not a deal
[1:49:16] are you with me brother brown looks back
[1:49:17] and he sees somebody 40 years ago and
[1:49:20] they're standing in front of him and he
[1:49:22] reruns their life right before them
[1:49:24] things they forgot
[1:49:25] he tells them what the clothes that they
[1:49:27] had on
[1:49:29] what color hair that they had now white
[1:49:32] was blonde
[1:49:36] god knows you
[1:49:38] and in that eternal realm
[1:49:41] it's not your problems he's looking at
[1:49:48] and maybe you even ask how did i get
[1:49:50] here
[1:49:51] i wasn't looking for this
[1:49:54] me and you're having a conversation now
[1:49:58] how did i get here
[1:50:01] what's god doing
[1:50:03] he's seeing way past a black shirt with
[1:50:06] a white undershirt
[1:50:09] way past
[1:50:11] grand black hair
[1:50:13] he's sitting way past that rim
[1:50:15] looking deep in the saw
[1:50:33] abraham will have isaac
[1:50:36] and isaac will have jacob
[1:50:39] and jacob will have levi
[1:50:42] i didn't take the time to
[1:50:44] measure the
[1:50:46] the years that would transpire between
[1:50:48] abraham sitting with melchizedek to levi
[1:50:51] even being born
[1:50:53] much less becoming a priest
[1:50:58] you catch that
[1:51:00] god's not so interested in what so many
[1:51:02] times we're interested in
[1:51:05] we're in such a hurry
[1:51:10] we're in such a hurry for god to do
[1:51:12] things
[1:51:16] and in that realm
[1:51:19] he's got it all taken care of
[1:51:25] would it be okay if i tell one more
[1:51:26] story and
[1:51:32] enjoying this tj yeah
[1:51:34] i can see you're just kind of like a
[1:51:36] light bulb sitting there i'm not talking
[1:51:38] about your hair
[1:51:43] you can tell when somebody's just loving
[1:51:45] what they're enjoying because they're
[1:51:47] just illuminated
[1:51:56] there are some visitations that i
[1:51:59] just will not tell
[1:52:00] because they're so sacred to me
[1:52:04] and i'm not going to share it this
[1:52:05] morning
[1:52:08] and it had to do with the greater esther
[1:52:11] i've only told you portions of it
[1:52:14] the greater esther
[1:52:22] and in that visitation
[1:52:27] it was a conversation that was had about
[1:52:30] the greater esther
[1:52:33] things i would not understand and even
[1:52:35] there's still some things that's kind of
[1:52:37] i don't understand today
[1:52:41] and i had shared that with at length
[1:52:43] with brother tim pruitt because of his
[1:52:46] wife
[1:52:49] and then his daughter esther
[1:52:55] this might come home real quick
[1:52:58] and so i'd shared it with him but i had
[1:53:00] only shared maybe with one or two shared
[1:53:03] it with my family
[1:53:07] and i'm sitting with a group of
[1:53:09] preachers after at brother tim pruitt's
[1:53:12] home and i i don't know maybe 30 40. and
[1:53:15] i'm sitting there
[1:53:17] and we're all sitting and we're just
[1:53:19] conversing backwards and forwards a lot
[1:53:20] of different things are being talked
[1:53:22] about a lot of
[1:53:23] you know a lot of it's just a fellowship
[1:53:25] it's a it's a fellowship
[1:53:28] and i'm sitting there and the lord just
[1:53:30] begins to urge me
[1:53:33] to tell the story
[1:53:36] and i thought you know this is i i don't
[1:53:39] want to tell it i don't want to tell it
[1:53:40] in a
[1:53:42] until where people will take it unsacred
[1:53:47] i i don't want to tell it if someone
[1:53:49] would take it unsacred or
[1:53:51] or myself trying to make myself
[1:53:53] something i'm not
[1:53:55] i want you to follow me just for a
[1:53:57] moment
[1:53:59] i'm even being guarded how i say that
[1:54:02] but anyway i i just sat there and
[1:54:04] finally it just was a push
[1:54:07] and i said well
[1:54:08] maybe i could share something with you
[1:54:11] and this is very sacred to me
[1:54:14] and as i began to share it and as i came
[1:54:17] toward the completion
[1:54:18] i noticed a count in its own brother
[1:54:20] jason jackson that will be here is it
[1:54:22] next weekend
[1:54:23] two weekends
[1:54:25] brother jason jackson whom i'm fan of i
[1:54:28] really like him
[1:54:30] and
[1:54:31] he was sitting over there i noticed his
[1:54:33] counting exchanging
[1:54:36] and and after a bit he just
[1:54:39] he just jumped up and he went outside
[1:54:44] and he said i felt like speaking in
[1:54:46] tongues he said i i felt like speaking
[1:54:49] to esther's husband something
[1:54:53] and so
[1:54:55] he went outside he actually prayed lord
[1:54:57] forgive me for for quenching the spirit
[1:55:04] lord help us to have that kind of heart
[1:55:09] and he said
[1:55:11] he said i
[1:55:14] he finally came back in
[1:55:17] and he was talking to jeff
[1:55:19] esther's husband
[1:55:23] and he said jeff
[1:55:26] you've been looking for children
[1:55:30] the angel said you'd have a child
[1:55:34] and you lost a child
[1:55:39] he said god spoke to me a few moments
[1:55:42] ago
[1:55:44] that when sister karen slipped beyond
[1:55:47] this realm of time
[1:55:49] and people
[1:55:50] were shaking her hands
[1:55:54] and shaking her hands no doubt she shook
[1:55:56] my mother's hand she shook her mother's
[1:55:58] hand
[1:55:59] there was a lot of a reunion
[1:56:03] she shook
[1:56:04] she shook a baby's hand
[1:56:06] that's now full grown
[1:56:11] and she called her
[1:56:12] mummy and she realized
[1:56:16] that esther
[1:56:18] their child
[1:56:19] was standing there
[1:56:32] my brother jason told that
[1:56:34] it was a wave went through the building
[1:56:39] it was a wave of the holy ghost
[1:56:42] just went through the building
[1:56:45] it just it just literally
[1:56:47] is
[1:56:48] going backwards and forwards and i'm
[1:56:50] sharing something very dear to me now
[1:56:54] you see none of us could see
[1:56:56] until god pulled back
[1:56:59] the curtain
[1:57:01] and that which was so painful for esther
[1:57:04] and jeff
[1:57:05] all of a sudden become so elated
[1:57:08] that god's got it all in control
[1:57:12] and now a woman that has suffered with
[1:57:14] brain bleeds
[1:57:18] and she served the life and let me just
[1:57:20] say no it's not
[1:57:22] fair
[1:57:24] life isn't fair
[1:57:27] life is not fair so many times
[1:57:39] but for her to step from this dimension
[1:57:40] to that dimension and know all things
[1:57:44] what a place
