[40:13] he said brother Ron he said uh this
[40:15] morning he said he said there's a guy
[40:18] that's going to be in service I want you
[40:20] to
[40:20] befriend I said okay and I said well how
[40:24] will I know him he said well he's he's
[40:26] he's he's tall he's kind of Slender he's
[40:29] dark-headed and he has dark Rim
[40:32] glasses
[40:34] okay and he said he'll Stand Out said
[40:37] you're going to really like him and so I
[40:41] entered the pull pit and I begin to
[40:43] preach and I found him quickly and so
[40:47] and he and sister Myra and I I think
[40:50] sister Mya and Connie look a lot alike
[40:53] and so and so we have good taste
[41:02] I was at a meeting and Cone wasn't able
[41:05] to be with us and somebody said it was
[41:08] so good to see sister Connie with
[41:09] brother Ron well it wasn't sister
[41:15] Connie you
[41:17] know and he he was telling me about it
[41:19] so after service I I met brother Kelly
[41:22] in the foyer and uh they would say foyer
[41:26] in Canada so I met I met him in the
[41:29] fourer and and we begin to talk and we
[41:32] struck up a friendship and it's been a
[41:34] phenomenal friendship and and the more
[41:37] that I got to know brother Kelly the
[41:39] more I liked him don't you like a friend
[41:42] like that you know you don't find out a
[41:45] bunch of boo boos a bunch of nonsense
[41:48] and and I just I found him to be the
[41:51] kind of friend that I would like to be
[41:53] and so the scripture tells us and I I
[41:56] want to and this is the reason I want to
[41:59] take that friendship is an incredible
[42:02] thing and it's a god-given thing and if
[42:05] you'll remember that God had a friend in
[42:08] Abraham and the reason brother brandham
[42:11] said that he had a friend in Abraham is
[42:13] he could trust him and he had confidence
[42:16] in him the scripture tells us that a man
[42:19] that hath friends must show himself
[42:22] friendly and there is a friend that
[42:25] sticketh closer
[42:27] than a
[42:28] brother and he said a friend loveth at
[42:31] all times so when it comes to all times
[42:35] there's going to be some spots to where
[42:37] you're going to have to look over
[42:42] Humanity well that's just the human part
[42:45] and you're going to have to look over it
[42:47] and and and so a and so a friend loveth
[42:52] at all things and a brother is born for
[42:56] a friendship brother Brandon would make
[42:58] a statement he says you can't buy
[43:03] friendship with money friendship is a
[43:07] gift of
[43:09] God when I was in the hospital with
[43:12] leing in a coma about a month the
[43:15] doctors would tell me later said we knew
[43:17] the kind of man that you was and the
[43:20] quality of man that you was because of
[43:23] the friends that came to see you and so
[43:27] we knew how great that you was he said
[43:30] he said you know we said patients come
[43:32] in they're in the bed they're in bad
[43:34] shape and we take care of them week
[43:36] after week after week but he says how we
[43:39] know you is by your friends that come to
[43:42] see you I want to say this to you young
[43:45] people you're known by your
[43:48] friends you're known by your friends and
[43:51] listen we all have friends in the world
[43:54] that's right we all have friends and and
[43:56] listen
[43:57] a person that draws you away from God
[44:00] they're not your
[44:01] friend are you with me but a person that
[44:05] loves you for who you are and can
[44:07] appreciate what you are that's a friend
[44:10] to
[44:13] you I'm thankful that God has given me
[44:16] many friends and some of those are
[44:19] friends that have preached here
[44:21] throughout the years and brother brother
[44:24] Tim has been a friend to me brother
[44:25] Donnie Reagan brother Joe grien
[44:27] I can stand here and name them through
[44:28] the ages and I these men become allies
[44:32] in our battle you know you you know
[44:36] that's where you really find out who's
[44:37] your buddy is when you're in a
[44:41] battle they'll stand shoulder toosh
[44:43] shoulder with you they'll look the devil
[44:45] in the
[44:48] eye they won't stand and say you must
[44:51] have sinned come on come on they'll
[44:54] stand there with you and they'll they'll
[44:56] be with you you in your battle since a
[44:59] young man since a boy since maybe some
[45:02] of the size of these young guys
[45:06] I I've been raised in Ministry and I was
[45:10] raised at brother fure church and and it
[45:14] was a wonderful time it was there that I
[45:16] got to meet some incredible preachers
[45:18] there is where first place that I met
[45:20] brother bisc there I met brother uh
[45:24] Henry green and and brother Perry green
[45:26] and brother Junior Jackson and I and I
[45:29] noticed I noticed those men as as I
[45:32] begin to grow up and and and I saw them
[45:36] and I I begin to respect them not
[45:38] worship them but begin to respect them
[45:40] for who they are and I begin to I begin
[45:44] that's that's one of the ways that I
[45:45] have have tried in my life to be the
[45:49] kind of a friend that young people would
[45:51] appreciate that they could walk up to me
[45:53] and talk to me and not above anybody
[45:57] else I think it's important I think it's
[46:00] incredibly important I saw the
[46:02] importance as a young man to have
[46:04] powerful friends around me to watch over
[46:07] things and help me you see friendship is
[46:10] a two-way
[46:12] relationship it's not just all you
[46:15] it's it's
[46:17] work it's work there there's
[46:19] communication that's involved and and
[46:22] and going to see one another and
[46:23] enjoying one another's con uh and You
[46:26] Begin to grow closer and strengthen and
[46:29] that Bond begins to get better the
[46:32] scripture tells us about David and
[46:36] Jonathan and they became the kind of a
[46:38] Blood Brother relationship and and David
[46:41] would never ever forget that and so even
[46:45] in his older age he would go and find
[46:48] michef and make sure that michef that
[46:52] though he was had lived in an exile he
[46:55] brought it him into his King Kingdom and
[46:57] it was because of the relationship with
[47:00] Jonathan and being a real friend to him
[47:03] that he could bring mbf
[47:07] in we met we meet many different
[47:11] types you know brother brandom said
[47:13] there uh you know there are certain
[47:16] people that you just really like and
[47:18] those different kind of things and
[47:20] there's going to be people with you that
[47:22] will be with you just for a short period
[47:25] of time and and you know they will go
[47:28] their different ways and some people
[47:30] will be with you because you're headed
[47:32] in the same direction that they are and
[47:35] so you realize that but in the whole
[47:39] scheme of things God will give you
[47:41] people that will become close to
[47:44] you some will become bosom
[47:48] friends and I'm grateful to have brother
[47:50] Kelly as a bosom friend amen I've lived
[47:54] long enough now to know that difference
[47:57] of
[47:59] friendships even even generals God has
[48:03] raised generals to to preach this
[48:05] message I'd like to just stop and say
[48:07] this to
[48:08] you I appreciate these men of
[48:12] God and I believe I've conveyed that to
[48:15] you as an audience that they're not just
[48:19] here for the weekend but I want their
[48:21] effect to be Long and Lasting amen yes
[48:34] I mean that I mean
[48:39] that brother Kelly is one of those
[48:42] friends that's a
[48:44] general and I I I really I really
[48:47] appreciate him many years ago I sat with
[48:50] him and when his church was much smaller
[48:52] than it is and I sat there you know I
[48:55] told him I said brother
[48:57] Kelly God's going to bless your
[49:00] church because of who you are and the

[1:01:28] Ephesians 1: 14-
[1:01:31] 23 It's a Wonderful presence in the
[1:01:34] house of the Lord this
[1:01:37] morning amen if you could just give me
[1:01:41] just a bit more my monitor as well this
[1:01:43] morning I'd be much appreciated as
[1:01:46] well probably at home I'm probably the
[1:01:49] the sound technician's greatest
[1:01:51] nightmare I'm always looking for more
[1:01:54] Monitor and they're always telling me
[1:01:56] that it's always to the top and I say
[1:01:59] well just do what you can do and and it
[1:02:01] would be good this a beautiful scripture
[1:02:04] Ephesians chapter 1:1 14-23 it says
[1:02:07] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:02:09] unto the Redemption of the purchased
[1:02:11] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:02:15] wherefore I also after I heard of your
[1:02:17] faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto
[1:02:19] all the saints cease not to give thanks
[1:02:22] for you making mention of you in my
[1:02:26] prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus
[1:02:28] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[1:02:31] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[1:02:33] in the knowledge of him aren't you
[1:02:35] thankful for
[1:02:36] that the eyes of our of your
[1:02:39] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:02:41] may know what is the hope of his calling
[1:02:43] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:02:45] inheritance in the Saints and what is
[1:02:48] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:02:50] us word who believe according to the
[1:02:53] working of his mighty power with which
[1:02:55] he wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:02:57] from the dead set him at the right hand
[1:03:00] in the Heavenly places far above all
[1:03:02] principalities and power and might and
[1:03:05] dominion and every name that is named
[1:03:07] not only in this world but also in that
[1:03:10] which is to come and hath let's say hath
[1:03:13] this morning and hath put all things
[1:03:16] under his feet and gave him to be the
[1:03:18] head over all things to the church which
[1:03:21] is Bo which is his body the fullness of
[1:03:24] him that filth all and all amen God
[1:03:27] bless you you may have your seats this
[1:03:29] morning last night we spoke on the the
[1:03:32] Tabernacle and in the the tent that was
[1:03:36] made in the in the wilderness years with
[1:03:38] Moses in Solomon's
[1:03:40] Tabernacle and it's always a wonderful
[1:03:42] thing when we hear the word it's
[1:03:44] finished we can say this morning that
[1:03:46] Christ died upon the cross and when
[1:03:48] Christ died he said it was finished and
[1:03:51] was finished once and for all and it's
[1:03:54] been completed for the past 2,000 years
[1:03:57] Jesus Christ finished the work and paid
[1:03:59] the price of complete Redemption at
[1:04:01] Calvary when he died brother Bram says
[1:04:04] now we have to look up there and believe
[1:04:06] it and this morning we are
[1:04:08] believers we believe the word of the
[1:04:10] Lord is
[1:04:11] true and we believe that God has sent us
[1:04:14] a message for a purpose and that message
[1:04:16] is to dress a bride for the coming of
[1:04:19] the of the Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:04:22] morning for a few moments I'd like to
[1:04:23] speak to uh to you on this topic Christ
[1:04:26] the word is welcome in our midst Christ
[1:04:29] the word is welcome in our midst and I'd
[1:04:32] like to subtitle it
[1:04:34] headship uh as a subtitle we need
[1:04:37] headship in this hour just as Moses was
[1:04:40] given a blueprint the blueprint gave him
[1:04:43] the Articles and gave him the the the
[1:04:46] thoughts on how to build a tabernacle
[1:04:48] we've been given a blueprint in this
[1:04:49] hour amen and we've been brought back
[1:04:52] into a place of headship and we know
[1:04:54] that the headship is the word of God in
[1:04:57] the passion translation I'd like to read
[1:04:59] Ephesians 1:14 it says he has given to
[1:05:02] us like an engagement ring is given to a
[1:05:05] bride as the first installment of what's
[1:05:08] coming he is our hope promise of a
[1:05:10] future inheritance which seals us until
[1:05:13] we have all of redemption's promises and
[1:05:16] experience complete Freedom all for the
[1:05:19] Supreme glory and honor of God he's
[1:05:22] given to us like an engagement ring
[1:05:24] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:05:26] amen which we know is the holy spirit in
[1:05:28] each one of our Lives Amen to try to
[1:05:31] live this message without the Holy Ghost
[1:05:33] it's a miserable
[1:05:35] existence but when you have the Holy
[1:05:37] Ghost in your heart and the holy ghost
[1:05:39] in your life then you have an inside
[1:05:41] power that continues to propel you
[1:05:44] according to the word of almighty God
[1:05:46] Amen we need the Holy Ghost more than
[1:05:48] we've ever needed him in our lives and
[1:05:50] we can say this morning with a great
[1:05:52] assurance that the Holy Ghost himself
[1:05:54] has come back into the Church of the
[1:05:56] Living God Amen and what is he doing
[1:05:59] he's preparing us for that great time of
[1:06:01] a Rapture I don't know about you but I'm
[1:06:04] looking forward to a Rapture brother
[1:06:06] brandham says that everything is
[1:06:08] pre-planned by God he knew where you
[1:06:11] would be sitting this morning he knows
[1:06:13] all about you he knows that the color of
[1:06:15] shirt you'd be wearing the color of tie
[1:06:17] that you'd be wearing he knows your life
[1:06:20] from the beginning to the end amen he's
[1:06:23] almighty God and he he pre-planned that
[1:06:25] you would actually receive the word of
[1:06:27] God for this day and allow the word to
[1:06:29] become headship within your life amen do
[1:06:33] you believe that this morning amen I'd
[1:06:36] like to also read a couple of scriptures
[1:06:38] Ephesians
[1:06:39] 52627 that he might sanctify and cleanse
[1:06:42] it with the washing of the Water by the
[1:06:44] word amen the word has to become
[1:06:47] preeminent in our in our lives first
[1:06:49] place in our life Amen brother bradam
[1:06:52] says that when you came to God he gave
[1:06:54] you a new spirit
[1:06:56] amen that Spirit wasn't the Holy Spirit
[1:06:58] but was a new spirit to get along with
[1:07:00] his spirit amen because we couldn't get
[1:07:03] along with ourselves but he gave us a
[1:07:05] change of nature amen and that change of
[1:07:08] nature was very very important to every
[1:07:11] one of our Lives amen because the word
[1:07:13] of God we were naturally at enity with
[1:07:16] it but when Christ came into our lives
[1:07:20] amen gave us a new nature and then he
[1:07:22] put his word in our life and he gave us
[1:07:25] his own own Spirit within our lives now
[1:07:27] we can accept the word then there's
[1:07:30] nothing in us to repel against the word
[1:07:32] but in our heart we say Amen to the word
[1:07:35] amen because there's something deposited
[1:07:38] down inside of you and brother Bram said
[1:07:40] that when you say Amen when I say Amen
[1:07:42] it's watering that seed life that's
[1:07:45] within our heart amen and that seed life
[1:07:47] will grow into the into the grace of
[1:07:50] almighty God Amen it changes our nature
[1:07:57] brother Ron was talking about my nature
[1:07:59] I have such a nice nature and sister
[1:08:01] Mara was driving home last night she
[1:08:03] says he just doesn't know you that well
[1:08:06] yet I said man that one stung me
[1:08:09] [Laughter]
[1:08:13] hard we say like this we're glad he
[1:08:15] knows me the way he knows
[1:08:17] me but I told her as I dve hope it's
[1:08:20] okay I'm at home here this morning I
[1:08:22] told her I said you know what sometimes
[1:08:24] we we get a little revved up in our
[1:08:27] nature that's just a human
[1:08:31] thing everybody
[1:08:35] smiling thank God for the
[1:08:39] blood amen but we we we come back into
[1:08:43] line with the word of the Lord amen what
[1:08:46] is it we want our lives to emanate
[1:08:49] Christ amen if you stand in a line and
[1:08:51] you're grumbling complaining people are
[1:08:53] around you listening they wonder who in
[1:08:55] the world world is on Amen but when you
[1:08:57] take it as it comes and you say Lord you
[1:08:59] know the reason why I'm here you know
[1:09:02] the reason why it's taking longer than
[1:09:04] it should take amen and then we start to
[1:09:07] realize that God is the one in control
[1:09:10] amen it's like driving in your car you
[1:09:13] can drive in your car on the interstate
[1:09:14] and everybody's a bad driver except for
[1:09:16] you but yet the person in the other car
[1:09:19] thinks everybody else is a bad driver
[1:09:21] except for
[1:09:23] them amen
[1:09:26] I feel like I'm at home
[1:09:28] now I think we're right at home right
[1:09:31] where we say where the rubber hits a
[1:09:33] road
[1:09:35] amen but the word has to have
[1:09:37] preeminence in our life what would
[1:09:39] purpose would the word be if there was
[1:09:41] no preeminence we don't have no Creeds
[1:09:43] we don't have no dogmas we don't have
[1:09:46] any additions to the word we have just
[1:09:48] the word and I thank God it is that way
[1:09:51] why is it that way because it needs to
[1:09:53] wash us of our carnal nature
[1:09:55] amen and it continues to wash us amen
[1:09:58] what for what purpose that he might
[1:10:00] present it to himself amen he wants
[1:10:03] something presented to himself a
[1:10:05] glorious church not having spot or
[1:10:07] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:10:09] should be holy and without blemish what
[1:10:12] a master planner God has amen he didn't
[1:10:16] just make a plan and just wonder if it
[1:10:18] was going to work he made a plan and he
[1:10:20] watched over his plan to make sure it
[1:10:22] would work in each one of our lives and
[1:10:24] I say that that's working well and it's
[1:10:27] bringing us into the image that we need
[1:10:29] to get to in order for a Rapture amen
[1:10:32] I'm tired of this past house I'm tired
[1:10:34] of of the ladyo see I'm tired of
[1:10:37] everything that we go through I'm
[1:10:39] looking forward to getting out of here
[1:10:40] one day amen it's time to take our
[1:10:43] flight amen it's time to bring ourselves
[1:10:46] back into subjection to the word of God
[1:10:49] now Christ to have preeminence on our
[1:10:51] life amen we're going to have some
[1:10:53] headship amen I'd rather Christ as my
[1:10:56] head amen when we're when we came from
[1:10:59] the world the world was headship over us
[1:11:01] but we came into Christ he became
[1:11:03] headship over us amen and we got a new
[1:11:06] person as brother as Paul said he was a
[1:11:09] love slave unto Jesus Christ I believe
[1:11:11] this morning hour We're a love slave
[1:11:13] unto him amen and everything he desires
[1:11:16] from his church we're willing to lay
[1:11:18] aside all of our thoughts amen for the
[1:11:21] Perfection of the word of God Amen we're
[1:11:24] to be sanctified
[1:11:25] from our old carnal nature Jesus
[1:11:28] speaking that they are not of the world
[1:11:30] even as I'm not of the world Amen which
[1:11:32] is a cosmos the world order as it said
[1:11:35] in a state of unbelief to the word of
[1:11:37] God if there's ever a Time the world is
[1:11:40] ecumenical it's in this hour it don't
[1:11:43] matter if you're Muslim it don't matter
[1:11:44] if you're Hindu it don't matter if
[1:11:46] you're denomination if you're Catholic
[1:11:48] or Orthodox they all think they're going
[1:11:50] to the same heaven but it's not what my
[1:11:52] Bible says amen Jesus Christ is the door
[1:11:55] to the Sheepfold and every person that
[1:11:58] comes through there must come through
[1:12:00] exactly through that door and allow
[1:12:02] Christ to be headship we don't get to
[1:12:05] heaven on just good
[1:12:07] nature amen there's a lot of good nature
[1:12:09] people we don't get to heaven just
[1:12:11] because we're kind to one another we get
[1:12:14] to heaven because we've been born again
[1:12:16] by the spirit of almighty God Amen and
[1:12:19] allow the word of God to take full
[1:12:22] control over our lives and our being
[1:12:28] Hallelujah Christ wants wants to have
[1:12:31] preeminence amen he's interested in us
[1:12:34] Opening Our Lives up and our hearts to
[1:12:36] the word he wants it to be enthroned in
[1:12:39] our lives he wants our lives to be
[1:12:40] separated from the chaos of the world
[1:12:43] Amen he wants us to be in a place where
[1:12:46] whether we're up or down we can still
[1:12:48] have a have a a Level Playing Field
[1:12:51] where we can walk and we can talk about
[1:12:53] the glory of God I encourage the people

[1:13:09] friend that's not your friend any person
[1:13:12] that would try to challenge you to come
[1:13:14] out from underneath the world that's a
[1:13:16] person you need to run away from that's
[1:13:18] right amen you got to be like Joseph and
[1:13:20] use some discernment amen you got to
[1:13:22] move away from the things that would try
[1:13:24] to pull you you away from the glory of
[1:13:26] the Lord amen Satan would try to harm
[1:13:29] your lives but the word of God is here
[1:13:31] to protect your lives amen I'm glad that
[1:13:34] we're protected by the word of God Amen
[1:13:37] allow Christ to be preminent in your
[1:13:39] life young people allow his word to be
[1:13:41] first placed within your heart amen
[1:13:44] anything outside of that just lay it
[1:13:48] aside I grew up in a church of have a
[1:13:50] lot of young people and I found very
[1:13:52] quickly that not a lot of them love to
[1:13:54] serve the Lord
[1:13:56] amen but was in my heart to serve the
[1:13:58] Lord amen I grew up in as in The Message
[1:14:01] Church 1966 my dad started coming I was
[1:14:04] 5 years old amen and I realized that if
[1:14:07] you're going to have to make a stand
[1:14:09] you'll have to stand alone at times amen
[1:14:12] when you get a friend in your life that
[1:14:13] loves the Lord relish that with all your
[1:14:16] heart amen that tries to keep moving you
[1:14:19] back into the center line amen that is a
[1:14:22] real friend a friend that will stand
[1:14:24] beside you whether it's thick or thin
[1:14:27] whatever it is and I say to the young
[1:14:29] people be thankful for other young
[1:14:31] people that love the Lord with all of
[1:14:33] their heart amen allow Christ to have
[1:14:37] supreme authority over your life which
[1:14:39] is the word amen now we know that the
[1:14:42] bride was to receive the word in the end
[1:14:45] time hour and Christ is the intelligence
[1:14:48] behind the word amen he's the
[1:14:50] intelligence within the SE Gene back
[1:14:53] home I was min mining on these Realms
[1:14:56] and and we have farmers in our
[1:14:58] congregation and when you put a wheat
[1:15:00] seed in the ground you expect it to Bear
[1:15:02] wheat amen why the intelligence is in
[1:15:06] the seed amen and as that seed is
[1:15:08] watered with natural rain then that seed
[1:15:11] starts to come into a place of
[1:15:13] maturity amen it comes up through
[1:15:16] different stages but the final stages is
[1:15:19] is the is the grain that's inside of the
[1:15:22] head amen the the farmer gets excited
[1:15:25] when the when it starts to come up under
[1:15:27] the ground but the most exciting time is
[1:15:30] when he's
[1:15:32] combining amen because why what in the
[1:15:34] ground is what came back to maturity
[1:15:37] again amen and we've got a word in this
[1:15:40] hour that's bringing a bride to maturity
[1:15:43] and the intelligence behind that word is
[1:15:46] Christ himself amen he's the one that's
[1:15:49] have preeminence in the church he's the
[1:15:52] one that we welcome in the church amen
[1:15:54] he's the one that that will bring you to
[1:15:57] Perfection it's Christ the word or
[1:15:59] nothing it's the intelligence within the
[1:16:02] seed amen that's why when the seed word
[1:16:05] was in your heart it started to come to
[1:16:07] a place of
[1:16:09] maturity amen I I we have people that
[1:16:11] come right out of the world Amen they
[1:16:13] wonder what happened I said what's
[1:16:15] transpired is there was a SE Gene in
[1:16:17] your life you didn't even know it was
[1:16:20] there but it was put in you before the
[1:16:22] foundation of the world Amen and that
[1:16:25] seed that's in your life when it hit the
[1:16:27] right circumstance it come to life amen
[1:16:31] and it started to change you it changed
[1:16:34] you from an unbeliever to a Believer
[1:16:37] amen what did Peter say in the day of
[1:16:38] Pentecost he said repent every one of
[1:16:40] you in other words change your mind

[1:17:06] everything in its Orit he put everything
[1:17:08] in its order amen even till the very air
[1:17:11] we breathe if it was off a little bit
[1:17:13] this way or that way we would certainly
[1:17:15] die amen but God has it in order you put
[1:17:20] your car in a grb and you start it up

[1:18:43] we're in
[1:18:45] control sometimes we think we're making
[1:18:47] our own Direction then God just gives us
[1:18:50] a wakeup

[1:19:22] okay amen it's a ing of the sun I just
[1:19:25] want to put a couple quotes that's what
[1:19:27] he proved that's what Easter proved he
[1:19:29] wasn't only the word but he was God
[1:19:31] himself the Dynamics in the word that
[1:19:33] made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff
[1:19:36] and dead in the grave Shake into life
[1:19:38] and rise again and roll away the stone I
[1:19:41] am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun
[1:19:45] said he was dead and the moon said he
[1:19:46] was dead the star said he was dead all
[1:19:49] nature said he was dead and now the
[1:19:50] whole world was to recognize that he's
[1:19:53] alive again he was not only the
[1:19:55] mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics
[1:19:58] to prove it and as he being the groom
[1:20:01] and the bride was to come forth because
[1:20:02] it's part of him let's say I'm part of
[1:20:05] him and it can only be man the
[1:20:08] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:20:11] the Revelation any others has spoken of
[1:20:14] the Bride amen it can only manifest if
[1:20:18] it does something different from the
[1:20:20] groom it isn't the bride because she is
[1:20:23] flesh of his flesh flesh and bone of his
[1:20:25] bone and life of his life and power of
[1:20:29] his power she is him amen she is him as
[1:20:35] a man and a woman are one and a woman
[1:20:38] taken from his side she was taken a
[1:20:40] spirit had taken a spirit the feminine
[1:20:42] Spirit from him the flesh from his side
[1:20:45] made both mechanics and Dynamics the
[1:20:47] wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of
[1:20:50] him and put it together and made
[1:20:52] mechanics and Dynamics
[1:20:55] amen Christ is the one he's the
[1:20:58] mechanics and he's the Dynamics amen and
[1:21:01] he is the head of the church amen
[1:21:05] without a head what would it
[1:21:08] be amen without somebody taken the
[1:21:11] lead amen that's why the order of the
[1:21:14] home is the husband is is under
[1:21:17] God Amen and the wife is under the
[1:21:20] husband amen not a floor mat but
[1:21:23] together they're working in together in
[1:21:26] Christ amen we're workers together amen
[1:21:30] some people think well I'm the boss now
[1:21:32] because I'm the head of the house no
[1:21:34] that just shows you're not the boss amen
[1:21:37] a boss don't have to tell anybody he's
[1:21:39] the boss he conducts himself like a
[1:21:42] child of the king amen and he gives his
[1:21:45] family leadership and something to
[1:21:48] follow
[1:21:49] after amen just as Christ gave
[1:21:52] leadership to the Church of the Living
[1:21:54] God
[1:21:55] amen we follow his
[1:21:58] example where it says to be baptized
[1:22:00] we're
[1:22:01] baptized where it says that Christ is
[1:22:04] the same yesterday today and forever

[1:28:46] intelligence that's moving through the
[1:28:49] Bride of Jesus

[1:28:52] brandom says that the Bride As thus
[1:28:55] sayith the Lord in her now but she waits
[1:28:57] until she knows what he wants done with
[1:29:00] it amen we've got so committed to God
[1:29:03] until we can say like Jesus I don't do
[1:29:04] anything unless the father shows
[1:29:06] me amen we we move into a channel amen a
[1:29:11] channel that's that's moving us up

[1:29:32] fire with the Holy Ghost amen and if the
[1:29:35] reformers lives could be on fire how
[1:29:38] much more the end time messenger who was
[1:29:40] a message of
[1:29:42] restoration amen and this message of
[1:29:45] restoration was bringing us into a place
[1:29:47] where all the lines that were Tangled
[1:29:50] become
[1:29:51] untangled and I say it's good to keep
[1:29:53] them that
[1:29:55] way it's good to allow the Holy Ghost to
[1:29:58] to keep his word running
[1:30:01] freely amen every believer is depicted
[1:30:05] in in the word of
[1:30:07] God Amen Lives full of Victory lives
[1:30:11] that are full of joy lives that are full
[1:30:14] of Peace amen not haphazardly living
[1:30:17] through life amen but lives that are
[1:30:20] full of the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:24] amen a church has
[1:30:27] predestinated every name that's ever put
[1:30:29] on the book Jesus come to redeem and
[1:30:32] when the last name is redeemed the book
[1:30:34] is closed amen we're in that time frame
[1:30:38] amen where the last seed will come in I
[1:30:40] believe at any time for all we know it
[1:30:42] could already be in amen but I know one
[1:30:45] day the last will come in amen I have
[1:30:48] lost loved ones and I say Lord move on
[1:30:50] the hearts of my lost
[1:30:52] Brothers amen loved ones that that would
[1:30:55] want to I would want to see them in the
[1:30:58] kingdom of
[1:30:59] God Amen I have one brother and the Lord
[1:31:02] starting to move on his heart and he
[1:31:04] said he we were just in Cologne a few
[1:31:06] days ago and and and he said to me he
[1:31:09] said is the end of the world coming for
[1:31:11] everybody or just for one
[1:31:14] person I said well the Lord's starting
[1:31:16] to speak to his
[1:31:18] life I said well the end of the world is
[1:31:22] coming it could come for any person any
[1:31:25] moment amen but there's coming a time
[1:31:27] when the bride is taken taken from
[1:31:30] here amen you I can see the Lord
[1:31:32] starting to minister to his life through
[1:31:35] his
[1:31:36] life I just say this as a
[1:31:39] testimony U my brothers were all were
[1:31:41] all home for my dad's 88th birthday I
[1:31:43] think I mentioned as a brother
[1:31:45] Ron and it was the first time in 44
[1:31:48] years that all my brothers were together
[1:31:50] in the same
[1:31:51] church that's a miracle
[1:31:54] a real miracle I look at it Lord move on
[1:31:57] their heart time is
[1:31:59] short amen May the same God that moves
[1:32:02] in our lives move in their lives amen
[1:32:06] that's what my concern is that Christ
[1:32:07] would come into their
[1:32:09] heart Amen to bring him back to his own
[1:32:12] I've seen God take my mother and father
[1:32:15] amen that were that were messaged
[1:32:17] Believers that went backslid and can
[1:32:19] bring them back into the word amen you
[1:32:21] see them today you'd never know they
[1:32:23] ever not have not have not been in the
[1:32:26] word amen my mom calls me and she tells
[1:32:29] me she said honey the Lord's taken care
[1:32:30] of me I said Mom the Lord promised to
[1:32:33] take care of you it doesn't matter how
[1:32:35] old you are how young you are he's still
[1:32:37] the same God Amen he takes care of the
[1:32:41] young he takes care of the middle age he
[1:32:43] takes care of the old age amen he's
[1:32:46] almighty God Amen we may get weaker in
[1:32:49] our body but he's still almighty God he
[1:32:53] gives us strengthen our heart and
[1:32:55] strengthen our
[1:32:58] souls
[1:33:06] hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:33:15] Lord the Bible says that God was going
[1:33:18] to
[1:33:19] restore all the years that the Palmer
[1:33:22] worm canker worm C
[1:33:25] pillars that great Army that came
[1:33:27] amongst and started to take down the
[1:33:30] church and they was going to restore it
[1:33:33] back to its original
[1:33:35] state it started with a seed and it
[1:33:38] started and that seed move up the life
[1:33:40] that was in the seed manifest itself in
[1:33:42] the plant just as the stock represented
[1:33:46] justification under Luther so the tassel
[1:33:49] represent a sanctification under Wesley
[1:33:53] and brother brand said that the shucker
[1:33:54] the husk represented Pentecost of
[1:33:57] 1906 amen but now we're back to the seed
[1:34:00] grain again amen where the fullness of
[1:34:03] the word can come back into the church
[1:34:06] again what's a purpose for the fullness
[1:34:08] of the word we know the Seven Seals
[1:34:10] needed to be open for the word to be
[1:34:12] fully restored and God would only allow
[1:34:15] that not in a denominational setting but
[1:34:17] in the Church of the Living God Amen
[1:34:20] where the word would come open onto the
[1:34:22] to the church
[1:34:24] amen so the third poll of the message
[1:34:26] should come into full effect amen so
[1:34:29] that God could have supreme authority
[1:34:31] over his subjects amen I'm glad for the
[1:34:34] first poll of or the first phase of
[1:34:35] brother Brown's mystery in the second
[1:34:37] poll but I'm very thankful for the fo
[1:34:39] third poll of his ministry amen which
[1:34:42] gave us an open book A book where we
[1:34:44] could look in and see our names on the
[1:34:46] Lamb's Book of Life amen that's why John
[1:34:49] rejoiced in heaven amen when he saw that
[1:34:53] his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:34:54] it brought a rejoicing in his heart amen
[1:34:57] I believe it brings a rejoice in every
[1:34:59] one of our hearts amen that God is still
[1:35:03] alive and he's with us
[1:35:06] today in the Masterpiece message it says
[1:35:09] the life that was in the husk or in the
[1:35:11] stock in the tassel and the husk all
[1:35:13] gathers in the seed and the life that
[1:35:15] was in the stock went went one went to
[1:35:17] make the other justification made a way
[1:35:20] for sanctification sanctification made a
[1:35:22] way for the baptis ISM of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:25] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a
[1:35:27] way for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[1:35:29] right down in Perfection back to the
[1:35:32] word again to manifest itself praise God
[1:35:37] Amen but what denominated dies like life
[1:35:40] in Luther went to make wesy went and
[1:35:42] from wesy it went to Pentecost and from
[1:35:44] Pentecost to make the Original Seed
[1:35:47] let's say I'm Original
[1:35:49] Seed Amen on to Pentecost comes out of
[1:35:52] the wesy until that time
[1:35:54] the reason that Pentecost came out of
[1:35:55] Wesley because it was no denomination
[1:35:58] Pentecost wasn't Pentecost went to
[1:36:00] denominate and what did it do it turned
[1:36:02] to the hus it looked like the real thing
[1:36:05] amen but I say that this message will
[1:36:08] not
[1:36:09] denominate there may be no nominations
[1:36:11] within the message and people think that
[1:36:13] if you're not part of our group you're
[1:36:15] not in the Rapture I say that that's all
[1:36:17] what brother Brown taught us amen there
[1:36:20] got to come I believe a time in the
[1:36:22] lives of the people when we can say like
[1:36:25] the early church these people are not
[1:36:26] saying what Paul said so therefore
[1:36:28] they're false amen we've got to come
[1:36:31] back to the original word again Amen in
[1:36:34] the fullness of the word of God Amen I
[1:36:37] believe that God has given us Eagle
[1:36:39] sight in this hour amen he's given us
[1:36:42] what we have need of in this hour Amen
[1:36:45] in order to be able to detect and to
[1:36:47] determine what is real seed and what is
[1:36:50] not real seed amen just as the four
[1:36:54] beasts of Revelation 4:7 which we know
[1:36:57] there was the Beast that was the lion
[1:36:59] the ox and the spirit of a man but in
[1:37:01] our day we have an eagle
[1:37:04] anointing I looked it up and I studied
[1:37:06] it a bit on an eagle and and I of course
[1:37:09] we know he's an not an Earthbound
[1:37:11] creature he's a creature that's in the
[1:37:14] heavens but what made me so drawn toward
[1:37:18] it is that an eagle can see its prey up
[1:37:21] to four miles away and with pinpoint
[1:37:24] accuracy brother Matthew he can set his
[1:37:27] Target on it and come in in a Thicket
[1:37:30] and grab a mouse or grab something in
[1:37:32] the thicket I thought that's
[1:37:35] incredible but not only that his vision
[1:37:38] is
[1:37:40] 340° he can see just about to the back
[1:37:43] of his head humans we can only see
[1:37:45] forward he can see all the way back and
[1:37:47] all the way forward all the time and
[1:37:49] when he wants to soar higher he just
[1:37:51] Soares on higher and how much it depicts
[1:37:54] the spirit that's been given to the
[1:37:56] church in this last day that we're
[1:37:59] living in today amen not just an
[1:38:01] Earthbound creature but a Heavenly bow
[1:38:05] creature amen creatures that are so into
[1:38:10] the
[1:38:12] heavenlies
[1:38:15] hallelujah we're not
[1:38:17] Earthbound we can depict from a far away
[1:38:20] off that's why brother Brown could
[1:38:21] preach things that are to be
[1:38:24] amen he could look way off and say
[1:38:25] church this where you are but there's
[1:38:27] things that are to be there's a land
[1:38:29] beyond the river there's a place that
[1:38:32] we're going to amen and he gave us that
[1:38:34] eag Vision in this
[1:38:37] hour blessed be the name of the
[1:38:40] Lord somebody say praise the Lord praise
[1:38:43] the Lord Give the Lord a hand clap at
[1:38:49] all do you love him with all your heart
[1:38:53] amen we're so grateful to live in this
[1:38:56] hour amen we don't have to go by the way
[1:38:59] of the grave but we which are alive and
[1:39:01] remain could be changed in the moment of
[1:39:02] the twinkling of an eye amen this last
[1:39:05] message that came forth is a flying
[1:39:09] eagle amen it's not for denominational
[1:39:12] chickens no it's for those that are born
[1:39:15] again of a with a Heavenly nature within
[1:39:18] their within their bosoms they've taken
[1:39:21] the intelligence of the word and they
[1:39:23] put it into their
[1:39:24] heart amen that eagle can see they say
[1:39:28] with such precise Clarity and precision
[1:39:30] of I've watched them in our on where
[1:39:33] where our Lakeland
[1:39:34] is on a boat this this last year sister
[1:39:37] Mar and myself were out and we're just
[1:39:40] kind of idling around on the shoreline
[1:39:42] and just relaxing for a few moments and
[1:39:45] she looked and she said look this where
[1:39:46] our old Campground used to be and there
[1:39:49] was two Eagles that were sitting in the
[1:39:51] trees and we watched them probably for
[1:39:52] half an hour
[1:39:54] watch him move their big wings and after
[1:39:56] a while he took a big jump and and he
[1:39:59] moved I said yeah that's just how our
[1:40:01] God is amen he's a great God he's not
[1:40:05] Earthbound at all amen his his boundary

[1:40:11] he's a bird of the sky amen I've watched
[1:40:14] him come down into the water and you
[1:40:17] wonder what he's coming for he's got his
[1:40:19] talents straight out next thing you know
[1:40:21] he comes into the water and he pulls out
[1:40:22] a fish
[1:40:23] I say my that's such ke- sightedness
[1:40:26] amen and that's how God depict the Gen
[1:40:29] time church that we're in today that
[1:40:31] we're enjoying with all our heart amen
[1:40:34] not Earthbound creatures amen I thank
[1:40:37] God for each one of those other
[1:40:39] generations and ages but I thank the
[1:40:42] Living God that we have the privilege
[1:40:44] and the honor to live in this age that
[1:40:46] we're living in
[1:40:48] today amen somebody say praise the
[1:40:51] Lord as it was in the and those so shall
