let them be heard by the hearers this evening that are here Lord I ask you that you just open it up for our hearts this evening Lord Lord and we thank you for all these things in Jesus name amen amen good to be here this evening isn't it amen amen this evening I'd like to speak on evidence of Jubilee Hallelujah evidence of Jubilee and I believe after this past year we have evidence here of a jubilee amen so I'd like to turn to Leviticus uh 25 and starting at verse eight this evening Leviticus 25 beginning with verse 8 amen and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years the space of seven sabbaths of years shall be unto the 4 9 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of jubble to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month the day of atonement shall make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto the inhabitants thereof and shall be a Jubal unto you and shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family a jubil shall the 50th year be unto you and ye shall not swow neither reap that which was growth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it the vine undressed for it is the jubil and it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field and in the year of the jubil you shall return every man unto his possession amen you can be seated this evening amen so this evening as I said I'd like to speak on the evidence of a jubilee evidence of a jubilee and as we have just read Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto the inhabitants thereof for us as a congregation I know we're into the 2024 and we had our Jubilee year as a celebration for our church last year it was a celebration of a year not just a moment but a year of things that have went went on thank you Lord and we thank the Lord for all of that everything that was done and uh I tell you just last year looking back uh I had a marvelous time at Labor Day Services each and every one of us did Hallelujah but to kind of recap some of the things as a congregation I wasn't here 50 years ago but I am a part of this Jubilee I am a part of Full Gospel Lighthouse Jubilee but not just that I'm a part of the bride's Jubilee amen so I don't care how old you are how young you are you are a part here as a congregation and as a bride of Believers we are a part of that Jubilee as we started out 50 years ago we started out in a basement we moved to an old Storehouse then we turned a church out of a house turned our house into a church there and many of us remember that and I mean brother alen and them they could tell you that in the dead center of that house was a chimney but you would not have believed it after they've turned it into a church and they Shout at the walls down in that church amen granddaddy loved to have a jubilee March a run I remember as a kid of course kids we enjoyed that time a time to be able to get out of your pews and run around the church freely and your mama not going to say nothing to you about it amen as a as a child I loved it I loved it when he would hit that just before the heaven doors close amen each and every one of us did we enjoyed the Jubilee of all of that that was happening you know my granddaddy he seen a vision of this church on this hill and he knew that this was the place when he stepped up on this ground here and he claimed that he claimed this is where I'm going to build this church cleared it out a lot of work went into this place and we're on Solid Rock not just physically amen but spiritually also but that's what granddaddy started this H and I'll say brother Homer Frasier also he is my granddaddy so for those that don't know brother Homer Frasier former pastor of this church is also my granddaddy amen so when granddaddy came out of what he came out of Pentecost he did not want to stay in an organized Place Hallelujah he's seen a vision that there is going to be a bride that is going to believe this message in its ful fulfillness not just a part of it in the fullness of the word and he believed that there was a prophet to this age that fulfilled Malachi 4 so we believe that we carry that on today that didn't stop with Homer Fraser that won't stop with Ron Spencer and if the if the uh Rapture would continue it won't stop with Andrew or the next Pastor that would be to come it will not stop the Jubilee has sounded it it has sounded for this church for this bride and it is sounding forth and it will not stop you cannot stop this amen amen we have seen the evidence of it we have seen the evidence of the Jubilee that has sounded forth throughout the bride if these walls could talk and they could tell some of the things that has happened here in this church my we'd be here for ages to come come don't you just love him this evening the times that we've had in this church the word you know there was a time where these these Services weren't taped a time that we would love to be able to look back but we have those memories of them of those times I remember as a child and after shouting Services picking up bobby pin because they'd get stuck in the vacuum and granddaddy didn't want to buy another vacuum I mean it was just one of them things uh I mean but granddaddy believed as Israel there and I'm going to get to it let me instead of jumping head let me build a foundation here hallelujah and brother Brandon would uh say this in return in Jubilee says and as of 50 years ago when mothers and fathers you Pentecostal people tonight with them oldtimers one sitting on the pull pit here here tonight shouting and praising God they came out of them organizations while you speak of organizing them they'd laugh at your face see they were free yes sir they shouted and praised God they spoke in tongues they had signs and wonders Miracles they had the Holy Ghost come down they seen the literal form of Christ and they done great sign and wonders they suffered and bled and they went under persecution bitter and every thing for that cause and I would say that granddaddy when he started this thing he did not want to be organized that's what he came out of he this is a word that was not going to be organized not going to be placed upon on a bishop or some man that we have to look to but it was God Almighty leading this congregation amen so we see that as an Evidence of the Jubilee here tonight that's what we're talking about is an Evidence of it you're a representation of what has happened what will happen and what is to come amen let's just say that this congregation would say it like a uh PR Pastor from South Africa would say it in one of his last messages before he was uh murdered he says I won't give up shut up I won't let up until I've stayed up stored up prayed up paid up preached up for the cause of Christ I am a disciple of Jesus I must give until I drop preach until all know and work until he comes and when he does for his own he will have no problem recognizing me my banner will be clear and I have to say as a congregation as a member of this church our banners will be clear we're Disciples of Christ we're representations of Heaven this evening evening amen because what he has done for us in our lives Jubilee it's rooted biblically in Tradition signifies a time of Celebration restoration and Liberation biblically Jubilee in the Old Testament of the Bible a jubilee was a year of celebration for the re and a rest that occurred every 50 years it involve forgiveness of debts the release of slaves and the return of land to its original owners see the power of forgiveness in the Jubilee debts are all forgiven a fresh start is granted and as we forgive those who have wronged us we celebrate a jubilant atmosphere of reconciliation breaking the chains that bound our hearts in another form Jubilee year in some culture is an organization a jubilee year is a special anniversary often 25th or 50th year mark in Jubilee as a celebration in a broader sense jubble is used as described a joyful celebration event that is associated to signify a milestone or achievement so as I've built a basis of last year was our Jubilee year as a celebration for this church CH amen it is also a celebration that we will continue this amen and I'd like to build a foundation here by using the uh sermon and you can go listen to it return and Rapture and I'm just going to hit some highlights here to kind of build it here this evening so in a type A figural we take Israel because Israel in the Jubilee time and the church was given a portion of Christ himself which was poured out by the Holy Spirit each and every one of our hearts and received him and become sons of God see Israel was given to Israel only that land Palestine belonged to them and see as we see when Patriarchs were being born of their mothers their mothers would utter out their voice their name as they were being born and so later as Joshua would come Joshua not using mathematics as brother Brandon would say but he was using the Lord the spirit of God to give guidance on positionally placing them each and every one of them into their land their possessions that was given there by their name Asher Gad nethan Judah and everyone was placed positionally at that time each and every one brother Brandon would you want to say here it was like the stones that were cut out for Solomon's Temple all over the world but each of them was positionally placed to build that Temple and I have to say that each and every one of you no matter what Walk of Life you come from this evening you were cut and you were proportioned for God himself to have a purpose a position in the bride of Christ amen not some big ey or little you here we all have our position in Christ this evening amen man and each and every one of us was led by that Pillar of Fire that Holy Ghost Fire that fell upon each and every one of us as Joshua was inspired to positionally placed God has inspired to positionally place each and every one of you now also being said with that those positions that land that was allotted was their inheritance and for somehow or another if they would have lost their inheritance a Year of Jubilee they could redeem that inheritance see every seven days was a Sabbath every seven years they had a Sabbath and seven sabbaths was the 40 was 49 years and on the 50th year was Jubilee and every man that had lost his inheritance by any means but he was a Freeborn true blooded Israelite I don't care what what it was but if he was a free born true blooded Israelite he could go back to his possession when that jubil sound was made that trumpet sound was made there was nothing that could stop him he was to be able to go back to his inheritance see excuse me I lost my place here but so he could claim that inheritance and this is a perfect picture of Christ in the church in the last days days see what man can do what man do do and then what God Can Do What man does is failing and will fail but God has never failed God does is eternal and it must remain forever nothing can ever take that away God gave it he h his gift freely by his Sovereign foresight saw it and placed it and there's nothing that could ever move it it was a Eternal and a jubilee and Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people to restore them and be brought back to their rightful possessions so do you understand what we're saying here this evening that no matter where they went their inheritance as long as they heard that Jubilee sound they could go back to their possessions and brother Brandon would go on to say here in this sermon there is a lot of them that that sold out and they would be walled off in a city and in that City they would not be able to hear that trumpet sound they had walled themsel off and in this message brother brandham is speaking to Louisiana there and he is saying not to organize Pentecost was trying to organize at the time but he was saying do not organize amen and as this church we it was not going to be walled in Homer Fraser said this will not be walled in we won't be organized because there's a people that will claim their possessions amen their true inheritance amen so I want to ask you as tonight what did jubilee mean to you Jubilee meaning to you there's many here that when they heard that Jubilee trumpet sound all there's many of us that thought well I'm not I'm not even worthy to be bride I I cannot I cannot do that that that's not for me there there we was in spots in our lives Dark Places that where we felt that we could not take that possession we heard it we heard it but we felt that inheritance that true word of God I don't know if I could really live up to that but he knew you could it wasn't us it wasn't us it was him Holding On To You amen amen amen and as I would say evidence I want to Define evidence here this evening many of us know what it means but it's an outward sign an indication something that furnishes proof is a testimony it's signifying something legally submitted and asserted the truth of a master okay one who Bears witness of that evidence evid as a a police officer at Harrisonburg one of my first assignments was and I was a rookie police officer they called me in and and we had a a crime scene that I had to to keep a crime scene log and what a crime scene log is is wherever that yellow tape would be you have to stand out and no matter whoever comes in or out has to sign that crime sheet log what time they went in what they took in all the details and exactly who that was because whenever you go on that other side of that tape I don't care what you are what you've done you leave a certain evidence in that moment amen that's right so I I I want to bring that to you so think about that you leave a piece of evidence there and as I'm standing there as a young officer here comes the chief and two captains now it takes a lot for a rookie officer to walk up to his chief I mean I had barely said five words to him other than thank you for letting me be here you know I but I walk up to him he's about to cross the tape and I say Sir can you sign this for me all of their decisions changed in a moment notice they did not want to step on the other side of that tape because it wasn't as important as they thought it was because see when you step on the other side of that AP you now can show up in court at any moment they can subpoena you because you was at that moment and there was evidence that you were there okay amen but I also want to take it in a spiritual sense when the devil stepped into your life he left a whole lot of evidence but see there's another one that filled out the paper and when he stepped on the other side the devil says well see there's a lot of there's this here there's that there there's evidence that I was here but Jesus says hold up there's no evidence to be found see you didn't sign the paperwork I signed it that's what Jesus does for us that's the kind of evidence I like that's the kind of evidence of a jubilee that we're seeking tonight evidence that Jesus stepped into your life that he came and changed it all in a moment's notice amen many would seek the evidence of the Holy Ghost but let's just read what brother brandham said in the pergamin church age it says evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of the Lord see it receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live you seeking it receive the word of Truth in which the day you live just receive it receive that trumpet sounding amen that's what the Jubilee is it's the trumpet sounding the word sounding forth that's what it is receiving it for this day amen in Mark 16 it's it's us in action right now Mark 16 in action Mark 16:15 says and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he believeth and I and is baptized shall be saved and he believeth not shall be damned and these shines shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents they shall drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen amen receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost right there the bride mark 16 in action that's what it is see we've received the word for this day amen in Acts 2 it was when the day of Pentecost was fully come was fully come and they received the evidence amen it's also receiving the prophet to this age that's right Revelations 10:7 and 11 would say it like this but in the days of the voice of the seven angel yeah the seventh Church age the seventh angel the voice of that seventh angel and when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as it was declared to his servants the prophets amen do you believe that tonight do you believe that prophet's been revealed to us Malachi 4 amen we have a messenger to this age we're not looking for one amen we're looking for the coming of the king amen we're not looking for a prophet he's already came he's already been Vindicated amen it's the prophet to this age we believe he was the final messenger amen what is that Jubilee trumpet it's God's word that is sounding Out amen many times it's funny where people find or realize their Jubilee many of us maybe it even wasn't a church or a meeting somewhere my Paul Spencer was watching pett Co Junction he's probably rolling over in my on his grave there thinking that my grandson's telling that on me hey but he heard it he heard it no matter where you're at it's that you heard it amen one of my first experiences was I was driving home I had just dropped Cassie off and all and I was listening to Isaiah Brooks said I'm so glad I got in this Army in due time why in the world just driving home and all of a sudden it hits me I'm so glad well I'm so glad see I realized I have a better purpose amen I got in this Army in due time amen I wouldn't just stay there I would I would just continue to go up a little higher see and in that moment there was nothing in this world that could offer nothing whatsoever and if you'd have seen me later on that evening I was in a laundry room balling my eyes out speaking in tongues Isaiah Brook singing I'm so glad I got in this Army in due time cuz I had it on repeat amen and that's what you got to do sometimes just going and get on repeat have yourself a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost fill time amen but you would think in a laundry room hey he'll meet you anywhere but it's as long as you hear that trumpet sound amen it's going to Quicken us one of these days in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we're going to take a half a step this way they'll take a half a step this way and we'll be changed amen and why because you receive that word amen see but there's no place in the Bible I'm sorry I'm reading this from Brother brandom 1959 pommer worm Locust cankerworm caterpillar if you want to know there write it down listen to it says there's no place in the Bible where they ever receive the Holy Ghost without having emotions well there's a lot of people that think that they can just I receive it see there's no place in the Bible now this is your Prophet so you can take it up with him that's right ever received the Holy Ghost without having an emotion speaking in tongu shoutings and praising God and prophecies manifestations they never did just walk up and Shake A hands with a preacher and then walk away see there's no place wherever in the Bible they received they were baptized outside of being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's right there's no place in the Bible amen there was never no place in the Bible where they TR where they taught Trinity it was always one God hear ye oh Israel I am the Lord your God one God thou shal have no other gods before me I am the Lord thy God not not a father not a son not a holy ghost but I am God forever he's God he always always was God and always will be God amen amen amen it's not just walking up shaking a preacher's hand filling your name out on some book and saying hey I'm saved thank the Lord I'm a part of the congregation we are not organized here amen it won't be organized as brother Homer granddaddy would say you can paint your name on a barn door Shake a mul's tail and you get more kick out of it there you go if you want to a church book that's about as much as you get out of it this evening amen but I want to know the difference I I but see I I want to be able to just yeah I'm different I see I can I can sit here and I don't have to shake somebody's hands I'm going to tell it like this maybe I some of y'all won't understand some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow some of you never get it there was three Bulls in a field one day and they everard the farmer Farmer said I'm getting another bull oh yeah farmer said I'm getting another boy the one oldest boy said I've been here 5 years there's a 100 cows out there that's mine the middle-age boy said I've been here 3 years there's 50 cows out in this field that's mine said and I'm not letting them have no more cows and there's a little boy younger been about two two years old and he said well I got about two cows and I'm not letting that boy have him so the day the farmer brought the boy up here he come eight te Willer pulled the air breake dust went everywhere and every time that bull stepped in that trailer the whole thing Shook and here he come out 4700 lb of nothing but pure [Music] bull well the oldest boy he said you know what I'm kind of getting older he said and I'm going to let him have half of my cows you know the other youngest boy he said you know what I I'm kind of getting to that point too where he can have half of my cows too well the third boy he got to snorting and carrying on and just throwing around dirt and just rolling in the ground shaking his horns back and forth and the other two boyss looked at him said you're crazy you're crazy that bull will kill you he said I don't care I want him to know that I'm a bull amen so when Jesus Christ comes I don't want him to come down and may you might be in the Methodist Church and the Pastor said well you know I got a hundred good Christians here but Lord you can have about 50 of them see when he comes he's going to recognize me he's going to say that boy's been praising he's not just some original oh yeah see he's a true Christian Amen in John 8 he says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen we're free here tonight amen we've been given Liberation amen we've been restored this evening amen we're not just some dead Church oh no oh so so any of them other churches that want to make fun of how we do how we sing how we shout how we present the word I'm sorry it ain't changing here amen come on it will not change see because when you hear the truth the truth will make you free there's a lot of us that's been in bondage there was a lot of us in sin there was a lot of us in chains that we thought would never ever break but when we heard that Jubilee trumpet sound oh that inheritance that we knew that was ours from the foundation of the world all that truth made us free when we heard it come across our ears we said there's nothing that can stop us now amen amen this church 50 years ago my granddaddy you know well you might say well well brother Matthew this is a family Church oh yeah yeah we're a family of God Brothers and Sisters in Christ oh no no no no you're a family church your granddaddy was the preacher your daddy was a preacher your your P your other granddaddy was a preacher and preacher it's just a family thing well you're right it's a family tradition amen hey why not it's a family tradition here Hank Williams judor saying it family tradition hey well let me let me just tell you a little something here it's a family tradition here hallu hey I am very proud of my daddy's name and lately some of his preaching and singing is exactly the same come on I said stop and think it over put yourself in my unique position if I singing Praise all night long it's a family tradition amen hey you're part of the family come on now hey what he had is now what I have his possessions is my possessions amen because he heard that trumpet sound all the family all the family could claim that inheritance that possession in that land amen so why don't you claim it you claim it for your children amen why not make this a family tradition why not hey hey I don't want my son in down no bar joint somewhere smoking cigarettes laid up beside some woman that he don't even know why not treat him like the bride of Christ my daughter like the bride of Christ hey this is a new family tradition for me not that old Hank Williams style this is a fresh style amen you can wake up the next morning not feeling so bad amen come on now there's a lot of them that what in the world don't happen to them again Andrew Spencer he done hit that one song and man alive they carry them at the church amen might as well get a holy ghost will bear roll them on out of [Applause] here hey I'm sorry if you don't like it hey we're standing for something there's a lot of people that will tell you I'm standing against this I'm standing against that I'm standing against this well tell me what you're standing for then hold on tell me what you're standing for what you can say all I'm standing I'm against this I'm against that I'm against this I'm against the Bible I there's only a portion that we can now use well tell me what you're standing for then amen tell me what part of inheritance are you going to give to your children because that's what this is about evidence of a jubilee amen there is a portion that's going to be left to them okay evidence of this Jubilee is showing that there is something that was done something that will be done but there's also a people that refuse to hear it yeah because there was many times where those slaves would be in the field working and they would refuse to throw down their hoe and they say well I have it made here I'm not going to do that I am not going to go out and be free so they would take and they would put an awe in their ear they would Pierce their ear put an awe in it but why would you say I'd put a put it there hearing hearing see once that's done there's no more that you can receive freedom I don't care how many times that Jubilee trumpet sounds you will not be able to go free ever again ever again and that was evidence to a lot of them there in that time they could no longer go free you could look at him you say hey he's free or he's not free but there is going to be Children of the ones that refuse to hear it that will sit down and that will say what is that Jubilee what was that Jubilee so you're telling me there was a time when you was a slave that you refused to hear that trumpet where you refuse to become a Freeborn so you're telling me that because you're in bondage okay you refused it there is evidence that there was a jubilee do you understand what I'm saying there is evidence that there was a jubilee and so maybe some of them children they would kind of ask well what was it like for those that did go free tell me what was it like when they when they did receive their freedom what all did they claim well you see they claimed several things everything that was given to that family they went back and claimed but see we walled in and I refused it but I want to say that those children of the ones that have refused this message some of them may one of these days say there's a jubilee that sounded forth is that Jubilee still sounding forth and I'm going to tell them absolutely the Jubilee is sounding forth have you heard it have you heard it because if if you have heard it and you've received it you're Freeborn you're no longer a slave you're no longer a slave what is so-called what would have been your parents is now yours you have accepted this word you have recepted this message amen it's yours amen so it's evidence that there was a jubilee sounding forth As Americans when we think about Liberty and about the sounding forth of Liberty we think of the Liberty Bell I want to read some facts here of the Liberty Bell here this evening says the Liberty Bell weighed 280 PBS at its order it was made of bronze it's 70% copper 25% tin and contained small amount of lead gold arsenic silver and zinc the bells would yoke is American ilm it said that the Bell the huge bell was famously rung on July 8th 17766 in Philadelphia to announce the first ever public reading of the Declaration of Independence the Bale survived the British attacked on Philadelphia in 1977 and it would become a symbol of freedom to the young United States for victory over the British now there is a lot of facts about this Bell there's a lot of things that went into this Bell but I want you to know it rang that bell rang hallelujah it's no matter what was it made of but it's that it rang that liberty bell rang and as a Young Nation we heard that liberty bell ringing back then amen and it was a proclamation of what is that it's liberating us from what we was there what they was trying to do amen you can silence it but you can never stop its influence now amen and on the Liberty Bell its inscription is to Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all its inhabitants thereof does that sound familiar in Leviticus there just think as a Christian Nation that that Liberty Bell would have that marked etched on that and we would be able to look back and see that Liberty when it was ringing forth what it was producing right then as a nation amen and we heard that so as that rang so is the Jubilee trumpet ringing it brings forth a liberty to Proclaim brother Brandon would say is as the eagle serve us enough said and they became Bond slaves to the modern society but when they were born to be Sons and Daughters of God see we were not meant to stay into slavery we was not meant to stay where we was in bondage we were meant to be born Sons and Daughters of God Amen and you might say well brother Matthew you're you're a white man in Virginia and back then you would have probably wanted to have slaves back then too I would beg to differ with you I'm preaching a liberty this evening to free Sons and Daughters of God so I feel that back then I would be preaching a liberty that hey you can go free we're not going to stand for slavery this will not amen we're Christians amen break those chains of bondage that would hold you Amen in James 1 and2 it says be ye doers and not hearers only amen deceiving your own selves for if you be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding a natural face in the glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way straight way forgiveth what manner of man he is amen don't just be a hearer of it and sit there and do nothing with this word be a doer of it also amen live a life it's not all about just preaching a sermon you can live that life amen you be an Evidence of what this Jubilee can produce amen but whoo ever lookth unto the the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he be not a forner forgot here but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in deed so don't just be a a hearer be a doer also in the law of Liberty I gotta find my spot I've jumped so much this evening amen excuse me amen don't you love the Lord this evening Amen in verse in Luke 4 and it says and verse 18 says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and restoring of the sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty them that were bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen that was Jesus speaking there he has healed the Brokenhearted he is preached Deliverance to the captives recovering sight to the blind set Liberty them that are bruised and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were on them fastened in that synagogue and he began to say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears your ears amen aren't you thankful for that that when you heard that that gospel sound you could go free because you did not turn it away it says now if a man and his family could go back to their original inheritance if they could hear that Jubilee and when trumpet sound and know that what it meant to them now they heard the priest sound that trumpet the the minister is the trumpet of the gospel and when they hear it and they know what it means they know that their inheritance no matter where they'd lost it how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to claim and receive again their inheritance the whole family could go receive their their inheritance and so it is tonight men and women here in Louisiana that knows the things that we do know have heard from our brother the different ones of our Pentecost experience of years and we find that we have and we find that we have walled or if we haven't walled ourselves away from what so far have gotten to hear somebody say instead of what the sayith the Lord says see you don't want to get so far away he's saying here that you can't hear what thus sayith the Lord has said to you amen not just a okay I I'm accepting this organization but it's what saith the Lord says unto you and you can hear what the Lord God has got to say about it now is the hour of Jubilee to come to your original inheritance once again the real Holy Ghost you know the other day I was reading acts 238 and it and Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost now this is the part that I absolutely love I actually had a little bit of a a dancing time now I've read it and I've read it over and over again but at at this it says for This Promise is unto you to your children to them that are a far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call as many this is to you your children's children your children's children as many as the Lord Our God shall call no I sat there and I tried to think you know we kind of do the Matchmaker type thing in our mind and I said you know I wonder what titus's children will be like but you know what this is for them also and it's not just for his children it's for their children as well so I don't care how far you go back how far you go down the lineage how far the family tree will run it is for every single one of them amen it didn't put a restrictions on it not whatsoever as many as the Lord thy God shall call he that hath an ear let him hear amen it's for every single one of them it's for your children not just for my children it's for every single one of your children amen if time would T this church will be filled of children that we would never even be able to think of amen and they would forget about us but one thing is going to stay the same and that's this word amen it won't change unless they organize it and that's what we're preaching about we will not organize amen we will not set up up a bishop SI somewhere else okay every church is Sovereign in its own way amen we are bride every member has its position its place that it has to be amen as musicians are coming forth this evening let's turn to Luke 15 and 21 let's read this as a congregation maybe we won't read it so much as as to just talk about it a little bit when that prodal found himself he said there's meat on my father's table my servants my daddy's servants are eating

brother he got a little upset he like no I've been here for 50 years for 50 years I've been at this Full Gospel Lighthouse and there's people that come in that want to receive the same blessing as
