[40:51] but let him ask in faith nothing
[40:54] wavering for he that waverth is like a
[40:57] wave of the sea driven with the wind and

[41:50] something
[41:51] that you've asked the Lord for you're
[41:54] trusting the Lord for and you've been
[41:56] asking him it doesn't matter and what
[41:57] realm it is it can be physical it can be
[41:59] spiritual it can be Financial regardless
[42:02] of what realm how many in this audience
[42:04] tonight
[42:06] are trusting the Lord for something that
[42:09] you have not yet received can we have an
[42:10] uplift in hand
[42:12] amen we're all holding on to something
[42:16] that we have not received yet
[42:19] and we keep waiting for it and we keep
[42:21] praying for it
[42:23] we keep crying out to God for it for our
[42:26] prodigals
[42:27] for lost loved ones maybe for a spouse
[42:30] in life it doesn't matter all these
[42:32] things if it's important to you it's
[42:34] important to God
[42:35] so we have these things that we keep
[42:38] praying and we keep praying and we're
[42:39] trying to be perseverant and look in the
[42:41] scriptures like
[42:43] this there are Phoenician woman that
[42:44] refused to give up and just keep
[42:46] knocking and we keep crying out to God
[42:48] now that we live in and lay out a Sia
[42:51] and is all around us and we're
[42:53] constantly Amazed by all the new
[42:55] technologies
[42:56] you know now you can just send a text
[42:58] and you can send what you have been able
[43:00] to for years but the Technologies of the
[43:02] phones and just the Technologies all
[43:03] around us give us instant gratification
[43:06] I would imagine that if any of us tried
[43:08] once you have you know what they call a
[43:11] smartphone once you if you were to try
[43:13] and go to a flip phone it'd be very
[43:15] challenging
[43:16] because we've gotten so used to the
[43:18] instant gratification of hey look at
[43:20] this hey you know send me a picture of
[43:23] this so I'll know what kind of item you
[43:24] need from the grocery store you know
[43:26] we're so used to just having that
[43:28] instant gratification that instant we
[43:30] wanted now we want it yesterday but you
[43:32] know no matter how much man keeps moving
[43:35] in that direction God hasn't changed his
[43:38] ways
[43:39] and that's where the challenge of the
[43:41] flesh comes in because we want it now we
[43:44] want to ASAP
[43:46] but yet God hasn't changed in how he
[43:49] does things he hasn't changed and how he
[43:51] answers prayer
[43:52] he's still Jesus Christ the same
[43:54] yesterday today and forever God doesn't
[43:56] change
[43:58] now in the in the church age but the
[44:00] satire in church age brother Ram says
[44:02] here I know your faith he's quoting
[44:04] there and what Jesus is telling the
[44:05] church the fact iron Church age
[44:07] now he does not say here as he did to
[44:10] the church in pergamos you hold my faith
[44:12] he's not talking about his faith now but
[44:14] he's commending them for their
[44:16] faithfulness as he does he also mentions
[44:20] their patience now faithfulness and
[44:23] patience go together in fact patience is
[44:26] the outcome of faithfulness for it says
[44:28] in James 1 3
[44:30] the trying of your faith worketh
[44:32] patience there is absolutely no other
[44:35] way in which to gain patience
[44:38] it has to come by the trial of your
[44:41] faith
[44:42] Romans 5 3 tribulation work with
[44:45] patience how highly god require regards
[44:48] this outworking of our patients as seen
[44:50] in James 1 4.
[44:51] but let patients have her perfect work
[44:53] that you may be perfect and entire
[44:55] liking nothing God's will for us is
[44:57] perfection and that Perfection is
[45:00] patience
[45:03] now patience is a problem
[45:06] with Humanity
[45:08] we all need more patience
[45:12] it it goes our human nature is that we
[45:15] want it to happen God I've been asking
[45:16] you and I've been praying
[45:19] why isn't it here yet
[45:22] but God has his own way and in fact God
[45:25] as a loving father says I'm going to
[45:27] wait
[45:29] and make you wait rather
[45:32] to test your faith
[45:34] because the testing of your faith in me
[45:36] will give you more patience for what's
[45:38] coming down the road
[45:40] he says and that Perfection is patience
[45:42] waiting on God and waiting for God this
[45:45] is a process of character development
[45:48] this is why we live in such a
[45:50] characterless age is because nobody in
[45:54] the world has patience for anything
[45:57] if Christians struggle with impatience
[45:59] how much more does the world
[46:03] so why is patience so important is
[46:05] because God builds character and he
[46:07] wants rugged Christians he doesn't want
[46:09] spoiled Christians
[46:13] the word some of the worst things we can
[46:14] do as parents is spoil is constantly
[46:16] give everything they want our children
[46:19] wants the minute they want it every
[46:20] single time
[46:24] in Galatians 5 22 long-suffering and but
[46:27] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[46:29] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[46:32] faith
[46:33] meekness Temperance against such there's
[46:35] no law patience is the Fruit of the
[46:38] Spirit
[46:40] we have to wait on the Lord
[46:42] and that is the trying time that is
[46:45] what's so difficult
[46:47] to our Humanity Isaiah 40 29 he giveth
[46:50] power to the faint
[46:52] and to them that have no might he
[46:54] increases strength even the youth shall
[46:56] faint and be weary the young men shall
[46:58] early fall but they that wait upon the
[47:01] Lord
[47:02] those that wait upon the Lord shall
[47:06] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[47:09] with the wings as eagles they shall run
[47:11] and not be weary they shall walk and not
[47:14] faint why because you waited on the Lord
[47:19] Brethren said in the message
[47:20] perseverance he said the trouble of it
[47:22] with we people we're too much
[47:25] we're in too much of a hurry it's got to
[47:28] be done right now can't go back no more
[47:30] and when you get that in your mind
[47:31] you're going to lose right there
[47:35] you're on losing grounds right there you
[47:37] have nothing to stand on you must be
[47:40] patient
[47:42] God is in no hurry
[47:44] he let the Hebrew children walk right
[47:46] into the fiery furnace before he ever
[47:48] turned a finger that's right he let
[47:50] Daniel go right into the lion's den
[47:55] Let Jesus go Plumbing to the grave and
[47:57] his soul descended to hell then raised
[48:00] him right up through the Bottomless Pits
[48:02] we just get in a hurry is the only thing
[48:05] you see we miss it but sight and time
[48:08] wrote The Prophet said is God's worst
[48:10] enemy
[48:11] and if it's God's worst enemy it's your
[48:13] worst enemy it's my worst enemy because
[48:16] we get so caught up in time and how long
[48:19] we're seeing something or maybe how long
[48:22] we're not seeing something we prayed for
[48:24] this but we're not seeing it yet so time
[48:28] goes on goes on goes on and we're still
[48:30] not seeing it and that is our enemy
[48:34] because we are to live and look at the
[48:37] Unseen
[48:39] not what we see but the monotony of Life
[48:42] can drag on it can drag on and there
[48:44] doesn't seem to be a change I say there
[48:47] doesn't seem to be a change
[48:50] but God is still working
[48:52] so if it's your enemy or if it's God's
[48:55] enemy rather than it's also your enemy
[48:57] because God Will Make A promise
[48:59] and then his people will begin to
[49:01] believe they'll Rejoice But as time goes
[49:04] on
[49:04] and they begin to look at circumstances
[49:07] around them it makes them to begin to
[49:09] lose faith
[49:12] if you need an example read the story of
[49:14] the children of Israel
[49:16] they were rejoicing until they were
[49:18] rejoicing with the grapes until they
[49:19] seen the Giants
[49:23] so time and sin they're they're directly
[49:27] connected the reason we're even in a
[49:30] time element now the reason that you
[49:31] even have watches and that you ever pay
[49:33] attention to the calendar and that you
[49:34] even care about time and you've got to
[49:36] be here and you've got to go here and
[49:37] you've got to do this is because of sin
[49:41] sin and time entered in at the exact
[49:44] same time because God when Adam when God
[49:47] created Adam and Eve they were in
[49:48] eternity they didn't age they lived on
[49:51] and on and on and eternal Bliss as
[49:53] innocent as children
[49:56] but then there came a time because
[49:59] whenever Eve Adam and Eve fail death
[50:02] death entered in and then they begin to
[50:04] start to age
[50:05] then time set in
[50:09] because remember God told them the day
[50:12] you eat thereof that day you die
[50:15] so the moment that they begin to partake
[50:18] of the tree the mixed tree then time and
[50:20] sin entered into Humanity
[50:25] but it will be it entered in at the same
[50:27] time but it will also be annihilated
[50:30] because remember in eternity there's no
[50:33] time element
[50:35] how can we worship God for ten thousand
[50:37] years as though we've just begun
[50:40] because we're in eternity that's how the
[50:42] prophet could say I want a million years
[50:44] with each and every one of you
[50:46] we cannot comprehend that because we're
[50:48] in time but in eternity remember when he
[50:51] went over in the current beyond the
[50:52] curtain of time he said there was no
[50:54] yesterday and there's no tomorrow it's
[50:57] just the present
[51:00] you had nothing to worry about what's
[51:02] tomorrow going to bring you don't have
[51:04] the scars and the hurts of yesterday
[51:06] it's only him it's only in his presence
[51:10] it's only perfect love
[51:14] so eternity is represented by a circle
[51:18] and whenever you're you're married the
[51:22] circle the ring is a is a type of
[51:24] Eternity you stepped out of Eternity
[51:26] with your mate and you're going to step
[51:28] back into but right now we're in what's
[51:30] called what the prophet even referred to
[51:31] as like a blip
[51:33] it's a perfect circle but there's a
[51:35] little imperfection in that Circle that
[51:37] is time that is from the moment that
[51:40] Adam and Eve sinned to the very end of
[51:43] sin and time
[51:45] that's where Cain killed Abel that's
[51:47] where Noah built the art that's Abraham
[51:49] Isaac and Jacob that's all the prophets
[51:51] that's Jesus Christ coming
[51:53] all the way down
[51:55] so once time is no more God does away
[51:58] with that in eternity restart sets back
[52:01] in
[52:02] and we're back into the eternal
[52:06] but that little blip is where God wanted
[52:08] to show you how much he loves you that
[52:11] is that little blip is where God wanted
[52:12] to express himself to you as a savior
[52:16] but impatience is what got us in this
[52:19] whole mess of sin in time to begin with
[52:22] brother Ram said that God had he told
[52:24] Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the
[52:28] Earth
[52:28] he had a way of doing that but Eve
[52:31] couldn't wait on God's plan God was
[52:33] going to show Adam Adam was going to
[52:35] show Eve
[52:36] but Eve got in a hurry and she lusted
[52:39] for wisdom and she went around the
[52:41] headship of her husband
[52:44] and when she sinned that made that made
[52:47] the problem and that is her impatience
[52:49] is what brought the whole fall
[52:52] because Brotherhood said she couldn't
[52:54] wait
[52:57] we understand the serpency she couldn't
[52:59] wait
[53:01] so she went and she mingled
[53:04] with the serpent
[53:07] all because she wasn't patient
[53:10] do you see how important patience is
[53:13] to wait on the Lord
[53:16] Israel couldn't wait whenever they were
[53:18] delivered they were just dancing on the
[53:19] Red Sea having a wonderful time Moses
[53:21] goes up in the mountain for 40 days to
[53:23] get thus saith the Lord and Israel
[53:25] begins to get impatient
[53:27] what happened to Moses he's been up
[53:29] there and he he's supposed to be a
[53:30] Vindicated prophet he did things but
[53:32] where is he
[53:34] and they appear pressured Aaron to make
[53:35] them a golden calf
[53:38] and it caused death because of
[53:40] impatience
[53:42] Sarah couldn't wait on the Lord
[53:46] so an Ishmael was produced because of
[53:49] impatience
[53:53] Saul couldn't wait on the Lord so he
[53:55] lost his kingdom
[53:57] the church couldn't wait on the Lord and
[53:59] she denominated and lost her place just
[54:01] like vashti
[54:03] the people can't wait on the Lord so
[54:05] they'll replace the new birth with
[54:06] something else don't ever settle for
[54:08] anything other than the real born-again
[54:10] experience
[54:12] the reality of it
[54:15] we don't want to be fake we don't want
[54:17] to be put on we want reality
[54:21] now when God spoke creation into
[54:23] existence he wasn't confined to time
[54:25] he said let there be light and he could
[54:27] have turned his back he could he he knew
[54:30] light was coming
[54:32] he wasn't concerned he didn't get
[54:35] impatient and bothered that what if
[54:37] light doesn't come what will my angels
[54:39] think if I said let there be light and
[54:41] there's no light light came
[54:47] so God is Not impatient even with his
[54:49] own word
[54:51] let's look at some scriptures here some
[54:53] examples in the Bible rather Noah he had
[54:55] to exercise patience
[54:57] God told him it was going to rain he had
[54:59] to preach for a hundred and twenty years
[55:05] that's a long time
[55:08] preaching the same message get in the
[55:10] ark get in the ark
[55:12] well 120 years no okay Noah proof to God
[55:15] Lord I'm patient God shut Noah into the
[55:18] ark
[55:20] know what brother I'm dramatizing and
[55:22] said family when his family got in Noah
[55:24] said now tomorrow you're going to see
[55:26] when we wake up
[55:28] you're going to see dark clouds they've
[55:30] never seen that before you're going to
[55:32] hear Thunders you're going to see
[55:33] Lightnings it's going to be pouring
[55:34] Sheets of Rain
[55:36] but in the morning they woke up
[55:38] the sun comes up
[55:40] the birds are chirping the sun sets
[55:44] day two the sun comes up
[55:47] the birds chirp and the sun sets
[55:51] after he preached 120 years
[55:56] he did that for seven days he was in
[55:59] that art watching the Sun
[56:02] come up
[56:04] but after that
[56:07] that Eighth Day
[56:10] the Thunders shook the Earth
[56:13] the Lightnings flashed across the sky
[56:15] and people began to beg on to beg and
[56:17] bang on the ark for mercy
[56:22] but Noah had to have patience he was
[56:25] sweating it out whenever the floods were
[56:27] done he had to have patience for the
[56:28] water to go down
[56:31] that took days and days and days he had
[56:33] to have patience
[56:36] you can't talk about patience without
[56:37] talking about Abraham
[56:40] in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 12 let's read
[56:43] that
[56:44] that ye be not slothful but followers of
[56:47] them who through faith and patience
[56:49] inherit the promises
[56:51] Hebrews 6 13.
[56:54] for when God made promise to Abraham he
[56:57] could swear by no greater he swear by
[56:59] himself saying surely blessing I Will
[57:01] Bless thee and multiplying I will
[57:03] multiply thee and so after he had
[57:06] patiently endured he obtained the
[57:09] promise
[57:11] after he patiently endured for 25 years
[57:14] what if he had given Hope on 24.
[57:20] it didn't matter to Abraham because he
[57:23] had already met him
[57:26] he'd already met that Elohim
[57:29] and God would give him clues that is
[57:31] getting closer and closer when he had
[57:32] that name changed and met and meant that
[57:35] God in flesh and discerned Sarah's heart
[57:37] he knew he was right on it
[57:40] God confirmed to him that he was on
[57:42] target
[57:44] where did God come in our generation and
[57:45] do and confirm to his bride You're On
[57:48] Target
[57:49] all seven Church ages have been waiting
[57:51] for this body change but you are on
[57:54] target
[57:56] he would reveal himself through
[57:58] different Messengers as he came on down
[57:59] and came on down but he did something
[58:01] special for you little bride he let you
[58:04] know your change is about the time of
[58:06] life
[58:08] it's coming we're close
[58:11] get ready Abraham get ready Sarah all
[58:14] all them little baby clothes you bought
[58:16] you're about to need them
[58:20] all them prayers that you've prayed
[58:22] they're about to be fulfilled
[58:27] in the church age book brother says you
[58:29] see the spirit is speaking about the
[58:30] word of God which has given us to wait
[58:33] for the Fulfillment of that word
[58:34] required patience even as it did in the
[58:36] case of Abraham he endured as seeing him
[58:39] who is invisible he was patient and then
[58:41] the word finally was fulfilled this is
[58:44] the way God teaches his people patience
[58:47] what if he fulfilled his word in
[58:50] physical manifestations the very instant
[58:53] you prayed you would never learn
[58:55] patience
[58:57] because things whenever now there's
[58:59] power in prayer and you pray for things
[59:01] and then that gets things moving in the
[59:04] spirit
[59:05] but you don't see it
[59:08] and we'll get you a little later on but
[59:10] if you're not careful you'll get
[59:11] discouraged and you'll then begin to
[59:14] doubt because time and the things you
[59:16] see is your enemy
[59:19] but yet you don't see that God is
[59:21] working in the spirit
[59:24] when you've prayed for your healing when
[59:25] you've prayed for your loved one when
[59:27] you're trusting him for something
[59:30] things begin to move in the spirit
[59:34] he said he was patient in the word okay
[59:37] he said he'd never learn patience but
[59:38] would become even more impatient with
[59:40] life the way our Humanity works is if
[59:43] God did something for me in two weeks
[59:46] when I pray for something the next time
[59:48] I pray I'm going to want it in a week
[59:49] and a half
[59:50] and the next time I'm going to want it
[59:51] in a week
[59:53] because that's human nature
[59:57] now God is Sovereign and he can come
[59:59] down for you and give you a miracle and
[1:00:01] you
[1:00:01] sometimes you think of something it's
[1:00:03] not even a prayer you just almost think
[1:00:05] Lord I would sure love this or I would
[1:00:07] Lord could you do this or anything and
[1:00:10] it's like I didn't even pray for it and
[1:00:11] God did it
[1:00:13] he's Sovereign he gives you little
[1:00:15] treats like that to keep you encouraged
[1:00:20] he's a wonderful father
[1:00:24] so if he if if we weren't trying if he
[1:00:28] said why if he fulfilled his word in
[1:00:29] physical manifestations the very instant
[1:00:32] you prayed you would never learn
[1:00:33] patience you'd become even more
[1:00:35] impatient with life he said let me show
[1:00:37] you this truth even more fully set forth
[1:00:40] Hebrews 11 17 by faith Abraham when he
[1:00:42] was tried offered up Isaac and he that
[1:00:45] had received the promises the word of
[1:00:46] God offered up his only begotten son
[1:00:48] there it is Abraham was tried after he
[1:00:52] received the Word of Promise so Abraham
[1:00:54] was patient for 25 years God gave him
[1:00:57] the promised son when the promised son
[1:00:58] turned 12 years old he said now I'm
[1:01:00] gonna try you again take him up there
[1:01:02] and sacrifice him
[1:01:05] most think as soon as we pray in Jesus
[1:01:07] name over the good Promises of God that
[1:01:09] there could not be a trial but here it
[1:01:11] says that Abraham was tried after he
[1:01:14] received the promise that is exactly
[1:01:17] correct to the psalmist
[1:01:19] he said God gives a succeeding great and
[1:01:22] precious promises he's promised to
[1:01:23] fulfill them he will but from the time
[1:01:26] we pray until the time we get the answer
[1:01:28] we must learn to receive patience into
[1:01:31] our souls for only impatience do we
[1:01:33] possess life
[1:01:35] that's your challenge right there that's
[1:01:37] my challenge
[1:01:42] let's talk about Joseph
[1:01:45] he was 17 years old he was loved by the
[1:01:47] father and he received a coat of many
[1:01:48] colors God gave him dreams
[1:01:51] remember gave him dreams that he and his
[1:01:53] brothers were actually out in the
[1:01:55] Harvest and they were getting all the
[1:01:56] sheeps together and their sheaves all of
[1:01:57] a sudden begin to bow down to him
[1:02:00] and then God gave him another promise
[1:02:01] that the son that the 11 stars in the
[1:02:04] Sun and Moon and they would all bow down
[1:02:05] to him now God gave him those dreams but
[1:02:07] when Jacob woke up when uh Joseph woke
[1:02:10] up and no doubt told his brothers the
[1:02:11] Bible says it made it when he got the
[1:02:13] jacket and so forth it made his brothers
[1:02:15] hate him that much more
[1:02:18] it didn't help his standing
[1:02:20] so Joseph no doubt could say how
[1:02:24] how are my brothers going to bow to me
[1:02:27] when they can't even stand me
[1:02:31] but he had to wait
[1:02:33] so from the time God promised him that
[1:02:36] there was a pit
[1:02:38] there was slavery marching in a caravan
[1:02:41] they didn't when they were selling
[1:02:42] people to slavery they didn't ride on
[1:02:43] the camel they walked through the desert
[1:02:46] walking through the desert all the way
[1:02:48] to Egypt
[1:02:50] then to be lied upon be framed thrown in
[1:02:53] prison
[1:02:54] all with the promise hanging over his
[1:02:56] head
[1:02:58] but he had to wait
[1:03:00] Lord you know okay so maybe once he got
[1:03:03] in Potiphar's house and was getting
[1:03:04] promoted he thought well
[1:03:05] maybe we'll see what happens I'm in a
[1:03:08] good spot
[1:03:09] then we know what happened with Potter
[1:03:10] for his wife
[1:03:12] and he went in jail
[1:03:14] went even further down
[1:03:17] and he was there waiting and waiting for
[1:03:20] 13 years of hardship and Injustice
[1:03:25] he had to wait on what God had showed
[1:03:28] him
[1:03:29] he couldn't get all tore up from the pit
[1:03:32] to slavery
[1:03:33] he had overcome Temptation prison he had
[1:03:36] overcome you think about this
[1:03:39] Joseph had to overcome the temptation of
[1:03:41] Revenge when he got in that position of
[1:03:43] power
[1:03:45] he was second to pharaoh and he could
[1:03:47] have gotten revenge on the Jailer he
[1:03:49] could have gotten revenge on potiphar he
[1:03:51] could have gotten revenge on Potter for
[1:03:52] his wife but he was a type of Christ
[1:03:56] he could of course got revenge on his
[1:03:57] brothers but what that what he went
[1:04:00] through gave Joseph the character that
[1:04:02] he needed to rule
[1:04:05] if he would have went from 17 and went
[1:04:08] straight from his father's house with a
[1:04:09] coat of many colors and marched right up
[1:04:11] into Egypt and became next to Pharaoh he
[1:04:13] wouldn't have been the same guy
[1:04:16] but whenever his brothers came up and he
[1:04:18] acted like he didn't know the language
[1:04:20] and all of a sudden once he revealed
[1:04:22] himself to his Brethren and his brothers
[1:04:24] knew what Joseph could have done unto
[1:04:26] them
[1:04:27] and they were all scared and what was it
[1:04:29] Joseph and the spirit of Christ
[1:04:32] said this was God's will
[1:04:37] perfect type of Christ
[1:04:39] we think of Saul
[1:04:42] whenever whenever Israel didn't want God
[1:04:45] anymore
[1:04:47] so they chose a king
[1:04:50] Saul by name amen
[1:04:57] preachers wrestled with coats
[1:05:01] saw by name now Saul as long as he
[1:05:04] listened to God he wasn't a bad fella he
[1:05:07] was a pretty good fella
[1:05:09] but what happened was he was in a battle
[1:05:10] one time and he was supposed to wait for
[1:05:12] Samuel to come
[1:05:14] and he got impatient and he actually
[1:05:16] made a sacrifice into the Lord
[1:05:19] he intruded into the priest's office
[1:05:21] when it was only for the priests
[1:05:24] in that single event caused God to turn
[1:05:27] his back on Saul
[1:05:29] and to take the kingdom away
[1:05:31] why all because Saul was not patient and
[1:05:34] didn't want to wait for Samuel
[1:05:36] so after a while God told Samuel quit
[1:05:40] mourning for Saul
[1:05:41] I've chosen myself a new king you go to
[1:05:45] the sons of Jesse first Samuel 16 1 and
[1:05:48] the Lord said unto Samuel how long
[1:05:49] without mourn for Saul seeing I have
[1:05:52] rejected him from reigning over Israel
[1:05:53] failed thine horn with oil and go when I
[1:05:56] was sending to Jesse the best of the
[1:05:58] might for I have provided me a king
[1:06:01] among his sons
[1:06:04] and sit in verse 11 on down and Samuel
[1:06:07] said unto Jesse are all are here all thy
[1:06:09] children he said they remaineth yet the
[1:06:11] youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep
[1:06:12] and Samuel said unto Jesse sin and fetch
[1:06:15] him for we will not sit down till he
[1:06:16] come hither and he sent him and he sent
[1:06:19] and brought him in now he was a ruddy
[1:06:21] and with all of a beautiful countenance
[1:06:22] and goodly to look to and the Lord said
[1:06:24] arise anoint him for this is he then
[1:06:27] Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed
[1:06:29] him in the midst of his brethren in the
[1:06:31] spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from
[1:06:35] that day forward
[1:06:38] so when others just see a Shepherd boy
[1:06:40] God sees a king
[1:06:43] Others May just see you
[1:06:47] in your own life in your own environment
[1:06:49] your neighbors
[1:06:51] but God looks at you different he looks
[1:06:53] at you and sees the Queen of Heaven
[1:06:56] so after David is anointed king get this
[1:06:58] now David is anointed king by the
[1:07:00] prophet of the age oil poured on him
[1:07:03] he's also not cared too much for by his
[1:07:05] brothers but after David is anointed
[1:07:08] king in the Bible says that the spirit
[1:07:09] of the Lord was upon him from that day
[1:07:11] forward what happens does David get
[1:07:13] paraded as a little boy
[1:07:15] God Save the King here's your king o
[1:07:17] Israel
[1:07:19] no
[1:07:20] he goes right back to tendon sheep
[1:07:24] he plays for Saul a little bit because
[1:07:26] the spirit of the Lord left Saul but
[1:07:27] then he goes right back to tending sheep
[1:07:29] why he needed more character
[1:07:32] why he needed more patience
[1:07:36] God's anointed king
[1:07:38] and he's smelling like the Sheep
[1:07:43] so while he's out there he begins to
[1:07:45] he's faced with a bear he's faced with a
[1:07:47] lion all with this anointing on him and
[1:07:49] David could fall back on his anointing
[1:07:51] and know that if he was anointed king
[1:07:53] nothing could touch him
[1:07:55] so the bear and the lion and everything
[1:07:57] that he faced was actually training for
[1:08:00] Goliath
[1:08:02] God knew he had a Goliath so he had to
[1:08:04] train him with a bear he had to train
[1:08:06] him with a lion it intensified
[1:08:10] and all of these trials gave David
[1:08:13] the character he needed
[1:08:15] and God knows what he's doing he sends
[1:08:17] David back to the Sheep he gets his
[1:08:19] character he's having to wait on the
[1:08:22] Lord and whenever David goes and kills
[1:08:24] Goliath what does that do it puts him
[1:08:26] right in the court of the king
[1:08:29] it puts him right in Saul's Court
[1:08:32] because David as a person can think how
[1:08:35] can I be king
[1:08:38] he God anointed him King
[1:08:40] he promised him he was going to be king
[1:08:42] but David waited on the Lord
[1:08:47] you see whenever he made it into the
[1:08:49] court of the king he didn't act like
[1:08:50] Absalom and began to rebel and build an
[1:08:52] army and take over Saul was trying to
[1:08:54] kill him because Saul could see the
[1:08:57] anointing on him
[1:08:59] so Saul was trying to constantly kill
[1:09:01] David and David would run here he was
[1:09:02] the Fugitive he'd run here he'd run
[1:09:04] there he'd run there
[1:09:07] so David got so close
[1:09:10] he could remember joab in different ones
[1:09:13] try to get him to kill Saul they
[1:09:15] actually snuck into his cave
[1:09:17] stepped over his bodyguards
[1:09:20] and cut a piece of Saul's robe off
[1:09:23] so that the next morning when they were
[1:09:25] across the hill he could say Saul
[1:09:28] God delivered you in my hand but I
[1:09:31] wouldn't touch you
[1:09:33] I could have killed you
[1:09:35] I could have gotten Revenge how many
[1:09:37] times have you tried to kill me how many
[1:09:39] things have you done to me
[1:09:41] he's taken my wife and given her to
[1:09:43] another
[1:09:44] David could have killed Saul
[1:09:47] but he waited on God to put him in that
[1:09:50] position
[1:09:53] even when God even when Saul ended up
[1:09:55] dying and Jonathan David he can read in
[1:09:57] the scripture was weeping he was tore up
[1:10:00] about it
[1:10:03] he was completely tore up about it
[1:10:06] he was patient allowed God to bring his
[1:10:09] word to pass
[1:10:11] he didn't get in there and say God you
[1:10:12] made me King so what do you want me to
[1:10:14] do he let God do it
[1:10:17] in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 he passed on
[1:10:20] this wisdom to his son Solomon says to
[1:10:23] everything there is a season
[1:10:26] and a time to every purpose under heaven
[1:10:29] in verse 11 and he hath made everything
[1:10:33] beautiful
[1:10:35] in his time
[1:10:38] not when you think it should be or when
[1:10:40] I think it should be in his time
[1:10:44] he made
[1:10:45] he has made everything beautiful in his
[1:10:48] time
[1:10:49] also
[1:10:51] also he had set the world in their heart
[1:10:53] so that no man can find out the work
[1:10:55] that God maketh from the beginning to
[1:10:57] the end
[1:10:59] God is right on time
[1:11:02] when Mary and Martha thought Jesus was
[1:11:04] late
[1:11:05] he was right on time
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:09] you may think it's too late you may
[1:11:11] think it's too late for God to heal you
[1:11:13] you may think it's too late for God to
[1:11:14] save so and so and you may think
[1:11:16] he's right on time
[1:11:20] even if things happen in life and you
[1:11:22] can't explain it and you feel like you
[1:11:23] were holding out to the end or that
[1:11:25] person was holding out to the end and it
[1:11:26] worked out this way don't lose faith
[1:11:29] God is in total control
[1:11:32] in Hebrews 12 1 wherefore seeing we are
[1:11:34] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:11:36] witnesses we just went through about
[1:11:38] several of them right there Cloud
[1:11:39] Witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:11:42] in the Sin which does such easily beset
[1:11:44] us and let us run with patience
[1:11:49] the race that is set before us looking
[1:11:51] unto Jesus the author and the finisher
[1:11:53] of our faith who for the joy that was
[1:11:55] set before him endure the cross
[1:11:57] despising the shame is set down at the
[1:12:00] right hand of the Throne of God we have
[1:12:03] to run it with patience there's going to
[1:12:04] be disappointments
[1:12:07] that's really no news flash to most of
[1:12:09] us any of us
[1:12:12] you get born again and the
[1:12:14] disappointments don't stop
[1:12:16] but you have a way to deal with the
[1:12:19] disappointments see that that's the
[1:12:21] difference the world is very
[1:12:23] disappointed every election somebody
[1:12:26] gets disappointed every day when they
[1:12:28] turn on the news somebody gets
[1:12:29] disappointed life is full of
[1:12:31] disappointments but what do you do with
[1:12:34] them disappointments
[1:12:37] Hebrews 10 36 for ye have need of
[1:12:40] patience
[1:12:41] that after you have done the will of God
[1:12:43] you might receive the promise forget a
[1:12:46] little while and he that shall come will
[1:12:47] come and will not tarry but now the just
[1:12:50] shall live by faith and if any man draw
[1:12:52] back see James said the same thing a
[1:12:55] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[1:12:56] his ways
[1:12:58] yeah I believe God yet God did this I
[1:13:00] don't know about today
[1:13:02] yep I believe God from one weekend to
[1:13:05] the next
[1:13:07] we don't draw back
[1:13:09] the Bible says my social had no pleasure
[1:13:11] in him but we are not of them that draw
[1:13:13] back into Perdition but of them that
[1:13:15] believe to the saving of the Soul
[1:13:18] now as James said the trying of your
[1:13:21] faith
[1:13:22] it works patience
[1:13:28] Jesus
[1:13:29] when he came the Bible says as the
[1:13:31] Common People heard him gladly
[1:13:33] he preached and teached very simple he
[1:13:35] could preach he preached the Seven Seals
[1:13:38] but in simplicity
[1:13:40] he would break things down in a parable
[1:13:43] of this a parable a king once went and
[1:13:45] did this a farmer went and did this
[1:13:48] he'd always speak in Parables and it was
[1:13:50] so simple that people couldn't
[1:13:51] understand it
[1:13:53] so we're all familiar with the parable
[1:13:55] of the sower in Luke 8 now the parable
[1:13:57] he talks about we're all very familiar
[1:13:59] with the parable but you know some fell
[1:14:01] by the wayside and some fell on Stony
[1:14:03] ground and and some fell on the weeds
[1:14:05] and things choked it up so Jesus begins
[1:14:07] to actually break down the
[1:14:08] interpretation of it to his disciples
[1:14:12] now the parable is this the seed is the
[1:14:15] word of God don't ever forget that the
[1:14:17] word of God is a seed
[1:14:20] those that those by the wayside are they
[1:14:23] that here then cometh the devil and take
[1:14:24] away the word out of their hearts lest
[1:14:26] they should believe and be saved they on
[1:14:28] the Rock are they which when they hear
[1:14:29] receive the word with joy and these have
[1:14:31] no root for a while believe and in time
[1:14:33] of Temptation Fall Away
[1:14:35] and that which fell among Thorns are
[1:14:37] they which when they have heard go forth
[1:14:39] and are choked with cares and riches and
[1:14:41] pleasures of this life and bring no
[1:14:43] fruit to Perfection that's laodicea
[1:14:45] that's the one we've got to be real
[1:14:47] careful about
[1:14:50] because we have the truth we receive the
[1:14:53] truth we Rejoice over the truth but then
[1:14:54] we go out of these doors and live
[1:14:57] in a very soft age
[1:15:02] that's the one we have to watch for this
[1:15:04] age
[1:15:06] but that on the good ground are they
[1:15:08] which in an honest and good heart having
[1:15:10] heard the word keep it and bring forth
[1:15:13] fruit with patience
[1:15:17] you don't plant brother Jerry you don't
[1:15:19] get a seed a fruit seed and you plant it
[1:15:21] and tomorrow we're expecting fruit
[1:15:24] if you do you're going to be in for a
[1:15:26] big wake-up call
[1:15:29] now before you even plant the seeds
[1:15:31] you've got to prepare the ground if you
[1:15:33] plant a garden or you're a farmer you
[1:15:36] you don't just get seeds and say I'm
[1:15:37] gonna plant corn I'm going to plant
[1:15:39] tomatoes or whatever and you go to a
[1:15:41] patch of grass in your yard brother Matt
[1:15:43] and you just throw the seed
[1:15:45] all right I can't wait to eat fresh
[1:15:47] tomatoes you're not going to have any
[1:15:48] tomatoes
[1:15:50] you've got to break that ground up you
[1:15:52] got to work for it you got to till the
[1:15:55] ground you got to cultivate it and
[1:15:56] prepare for the seed which remember is
[1:15:59] the word to be planted
[1:16:01] so what am I saying if we come into
[1:16:04] church services with a hard Spirit maybe
[1:16:07] a critical spirit maybe the hurts of the
[1:16:09] week or whatever it may be the cares of
[1:16:11] the world whatever happened on the job
[1:16:13] that we if we come and we're not careful
[1:16:16] to see that's preached will not find
[1:16:18] good ground
[1:16:21] because it's hard maybe it's crusty or
[1:16:24] maybe it's hurt unforgiving whatever it
[1:16:26] is maybe there's grass and weeds there
[1:16:28] you need it whenever you know we Rejoice
[1:16:31] over what God does in our services we're
[1:16:33] so blessed here
[1:16:35] and God pours out a spirit on the bride
[1:16:37] all across the world and by God's grace
[1:16:40] while the world is falling apart we're
[1:16:41] having phenomenal the bride is having
[1:16:44] phenomenal worship and phenomenal uh
[1:16:47] presence and phenomenal revelations in
[1:16:48] these things that's God's goodness but
[1:16:51] see we we will have a wonderful weekend
[1:16:53] and on Monday and Tuesday we'll begin we
[1:16:55] we Rejoice over what happened and we
[1:16:57] think about what was preached and we
[1:16:58] thank the Lord for the deliverance and
[1:17:00] different things but as the week
[1:17:02] progresses we should then begin not
[1:17:04] forget what God done but then begin to
[1:17:06] turn our hearts and begin to cultivate
[1:17:08] okay thank you Lord for last weekend but
[1:17:10] now we're approaching another weekend
[1:17:12] Lord what do you have for me this
[1:17:15] weekend
[1:17:16] start praying for the ministry whoever
[1:17:18] is preaching what are you doing you're
[1:17:20] cultivating you're breaking the ground
[1:17:23] and then when you come in here worship
[1:17:25] will be easy praise will be easy
[1:17:27] receiving the word believing will be
[1:17:29] easy and then it just Falls right into
[1:17:31] the prepared ground
[1:17:35] we have to get ready for the word
[1:17:38] he said now when a man plants a seed if
[1:17:40] you're a farmer you know anything about
[1:17:41] planting any seed if you plant a seed
[1:17:44] today some corn you put it in your
[1:17:45] garden tomorrow morning you go out and
[1:17:47] you dig it up and look at it say well
[1:17:49] there's no difference in it you plant it
[1:17:50] back and the next day you go back look
[1:17:52] at it say there's no difference in it
[1:17:53] it'll never come up
[1:17:55] it can't do it when you dug it up you
[1:17:58] spoil the picture right there you start
[1:18:00] the cycle all over again
[1:18:04] as soon as you receive something from
[1:18:06] the Lord you plant it you cover it up
[1:18:08] begin to nurture the seed
[1:18:12] and not constantly dig it up
[1:18:15] not constantly look at it
[1:18:17] he said and every time you look at your
[1:18:19] symptoms testify about them complain
[1:18:21] about them God can never heal you you
[1:18:24] commit it to God you believe his word
[1:18:25] he'll bring it to pass so when you plant
[1:18:27] a garden do you sit there at night so
[1:18:29] stressed that your corn won't come up
[1:18:33] when he bought organic non-GMO
[1:18:37] Original Seed do you stress that your
[1:18:41] garden won't come up
[1:18:43] you plant it you cover it
[1:18:45] you may stress about the deer that will
[1:18:47] eventually get in there
[1:18:48] but for now you plant the seed you cover
[1:18:51] it up you commit It to the Ground
[1:18:54] and you know it'll come up
[1:18:56] you don't stress about if it will come
[1:18:58] up neither do you stress that I planted
[1:19:01] Tomatoes but I sure hope I don't get
[1:19:02] cucumbers why because you know what you
[1:19:04] planted
[1:19:06] so when you accept whenever you accept
[1:19:08] the the word of God you're not gonna
[1:19:11] you're not gonna get weeds
[1:19:14] because remember he said whenever
[1:19:16] whether it's sprouting whether it's
[1:19:18] whatever it's doing you don't care God
[1:19:20] promised it and potentially you have
[1:19:21] your healing when you accept it it's in
[1:19:24] seed form
[1:19:26] so remember brother I'm dealing with the
[1:19:28] Lutheran Dean he planted the corn he
[1:19:29] said do you have a crop of corn he said
[1:19:31] potentially
[1:19:34] but the potential is in the seed itself
[1:19:38] so the potential means the existing
[1:19:40] impossibility capable of development
[1:19:42] into actuality it's like you will as
[1:19:46] long as you take care of it and you
[1:19:49] nurture the sea that you plant you are
[1:19:51] guaranteed a crop
[1:19:57] so once we once the word or the seed is
[1:19:59] planted we must with patience
[1:20:02] wait for it to bring the fruit
[1:20:04] if we plant our garden we walk away well
[1:20:06] God's going to bring the seat to pass
[1:20:09] and never nurture it
[1:20:14] you're is very doubtful you're going to
[1:20:16] have a garden
[1:20:19] because it gets choked up with weeds
[1:20:22] if it doesn't rain it's dry and the seed
[1:20:24] will dry up
[1:20:26] you say what are you trying to say well
[1:20:28] if we receive the word
[1:20:30] in this service
[1:20:31] we Rejoice over and then you walk out of
[1:20:33] them doors and we don't nurture it with
[1:20:36] faith Thanksgiving and praise
[1:20:39] weeds will pop up
[1:20:41] it'll get dry your ground will start
[1:20:43] getting broken up
[1:20:45] and it won't bring nothing up
[1:20:49] when you receive the word and you
[1:20:50] receive the promise you've got the
[1:20:52] potential of it when you believe that
[1:20:55] God's God's word and and when you lay
[1:20:57] your hands on the sick they shall
[1:20:58] receive they shall recover you believe
[1:21:00] it that's your potential that's your
[1:21:03] seed now plant it in your heart believe
[1:21:05] it and water it and it's thus saith the
[1:21:07] Lord it will produce
[1:21:11] there's nothing wrong with the seed
[1:21:13] itself
[1:21:14] but it's got to be it's got to be
[1:21:16] guarded
[1:21:17] you got to go make sure no weeds are
[1:21:19] coming up
[1:21:20] as as it begins to grow up in in your
[1:21:22] starting you're starting to see an
[1:21:24] answer to prayer a development you got
[1:21:27] to make sure you keep the weeds away
[1:21:30] we have to be real watchful
[1:21:33] brother Ram talked about a man named
[1:21:35] John Ryan and we're all very familiar
[1:21:36] with his story
[1:21:39] but he was a blind man that the prophet
[1:21:41] prayed for
[1:21:42] and he comes through the prayer line and
[1:21:44] brother Adam says I prayed for him and I
[1:21:46] laid my hands on him I said Lord Jesus I
[1:21:48] rebuke this blindness now in the name of
[1:21:50] Jesus Christ leave it him and I turned
[1:21:52] around and looked and I seen him going
[1:21:54] walking away with his sight I said thus
[1:21:56] saith the Lord you watch for that thus
[1:21:57] saith the Lord you've received your
[1:21:59] sight well he said I can't see
[1:22:03] I said that has nothing to do with it go
[1:22:06] on your road rejoicing so he went down
[1:22:07] now listen to this there's a woman in a
[1:22:10] few minutes who had a great goiter
[1:22:11] hanging on her throat and while she was
[1:22:13] praying and while we was praying for her
[1:22:16] it went away
[1:22:18] so here you had John Ryan coming to
[1:22:20] prayer line the prophet said thus saith
[1:22:22] the Lord you can receive your sight and
[1:22:23] when he open or whenever he's done
[1:22:25] praying John Ryan said I can't see
[1:22:28] so brother M encourages him to believe
[1:22:29] he goes off the platform and then he
[1:22:30] prays for another woman who has a big
[1:22:32] goiter and that instantly falls off
[1:22:35] remember God in his sovereignty
[1:22:37] so then John Ryan circles back around
[1:22:39] gets through all the ushers and he comes
[1:22:40] and he says I thought he said here come
[1:22:43] John Ryan back pushing through all the
[1:22:44] ushers
[1:22:46] and he said to me he said you told me I
[1:22:48] was healed
[1:22:50] so you see John Ryan was comparing his
[1:22:53] promise
[1:22:55] to a miracle that happened
[1:22:57] we can't do that
[1:22:59] God is Sovereign in his action and his
[1:23:02] power and in his plan
[1:23:04] so we can't get discouraged that
[1:23:06] somebody gets a miracle instantly but
[1:23:08] yet I've been trusting God for years and
[1:23:10] I still don't have it
[1:23:14] God has a reason
[1:23:18] said
[1:23:20] he said you told me I was healed I said
[1:23:22] you are
[1:23:24] he said well you said I was healed I
[1:23:26] said you said you believed me
[1:23:30] he said I said well the only thing to do
[1:23:32] is go on your road just praising God
[1:23:35] forgiving your eyesight
[1:23:37] so for days for a long time weeks I
[1:23:39] believe he was blind but he still would
[1:23:42] rise up say thank you Lord for healing
[1:23:43] me thank you Lord for healing me
[1:23:46] so he goes and you know the story and he
[1:23:48] he sits in a barber's chair there
[1:23:50] and the barber is trying to make fun of
[1:23:52] him while he get him to shape he said
[1:23:53] say I heard you went to that Holy Roller
[1:23:55] meeting got healed he said I did thank
[1:23:56] you Lord for healing me praise the Lord
[1:23:58] for healing me and his eyes come open
[1:24:01] why because he received that once he
[1:24:03] understood he received the seed went off
[1:24:06] the platform went to his daily job
[1:24:08] selling newspapers whatever he did he
[1:24:10] was still blind as could be but yet his
[1:24:12] testimony was watering and nurturing the
[1:24:15] sea that he received
[1:24:18] and in an instant he got his sight
[1:24:23] in an instant
[1:24:25] Romans 5 3 not only so but we also glory
[1:24:27] in tribulations also knowing that
[1:24:30] tribulation work of patience and
[1:24:32] patience experience and experience hope
[1:24:34] the prophet said patience with what what
[1:24:36] kind of patience first thing is have
[1:24:38] patience with God
[1:24:42] if you've got real genuine faith you'll
[1:24:44] have real genuine patience because Faith
[1:24:47] worketh patience
[1:24:50] see whenever faith is a revelation and
[1:24:52] when you had the faith that you really
[1:24:55] believe God
[1:24:57] it doesn't matter
[1:24:59] how long it takes is challenging to the
[1:25:02] flesh it's challenging when you look
[1:25:03] down and you see your symptoms it's
[1:25:05] challenging when you look around but see
[1:25:07] we look at the Unseen
[1:25:10] he said when God says anything you
[1:25:12] believe it that's all you got patience
[1:25:14] think of this God had patience with you
[1:25:18] he had patience with me
[1:25:20] he'd try and reach you in this service
[1:25:22] you run he's trying to reach you in that
[1:25:24] service you run he pull on your heart
[1:25:25] here and you run
[1:25:27] for years Iran
[1:25:30] and he's patient
[1:25:33] he's patient he's patient but then we
[1:25:36] come in the house of God God save us
[1:25:37] bless the Lord he filled me with the
[1:25:39] Holy Ghost I'm born again and then
[1:25:41] whenever God don't answer our prayer as
[1:25:42] soon as we think he should we can get
[1:25:44] discouraged
[1:25:46] see discouragement breaks down faith
[1:25:50] brother man preached a sermon called the
[1:25:51] court trial you should listen to it he
[1:25:53] preached it five times
[1:25:55] and he sets up a court trial
[1:25:58] and he puts the word he dramatizes it
[1:26:01] beautifully and he puts that Satan as
[1:26:03] the prosecuting attorney is bringing the
[1:26:05] word of God and he's putting the word on
[1:26:07] trial because God don't keep his word
[1:26:10] and he really sets it up just right
[1:26:15] and Satan is accusing God and Satan
[1:26:17] whenever there's a prosecutor they
[1:26:18] always have witnesses
[1:26:20] so Satan has his Witnesses so in the
[1:26:23] court in the in the sermon their brother
[1:26:24] said the case is the word of God it's
[1:26:26] promised versus the word world and the
[1:26:29] cost for the indictment is a breach of
[1:26:31] Promise God made a promise and didn't
[1:26:33] stick to it God's word made a promise so
[1:26:37] he he's being brought in for a court
[1:26:39] case breach of promise
[1:26:41] now the prosecuting attorney always
[1:26:43] represents the state
[1:26:45] and the prosecuting attorney is Satan
[1:26:48] the defendant in this case is almighty
[1:26:50] God
[1:26:52] and the prosecuting attorney also has
[1:26:55] some witnesses on the case I'm going to
[1:26:57] name them
[1:26:58] one of them is Mr unbeliever
[1:27:02] the next one is Mr skeptic
[1:27:06] and the third one you guessed it
[1:27:08] is Mr and patient
[1:27:11] called him a rascal because see they
[1:27:14] claim to be believers
[1:27:16] Mr impatient claims to be Believers you
[1:27:19] know he got up and he testified this is
[1:27:21] where this is where the preacher
[1:27:23] preached this is where I read in the
[1:27:25] Bible this is where I took the promise
[1:27:26] but I waited for this many years and it
[1:27:29] didn't happen therefore it's not true
[1:27:34] they all claim to be Believers and
[1:27:37] brothers gets that courtroom and he sets
[1:27:38] it up and he says now you are both the
[1:27:41] judge and the jury this afternoon
[1:27:44] when the word Goes Forth and he says you
[1:27:48] in your mind is the jury because as the
[1:27:50] words being preached is coming first and
[1:27:51] getting right here
[1:27:54] and you make a decision if you're going
[1:27:55] to accept it or refuse it
[1:27:59] that's your jury
[1:28:01] when a case is being given
[1:28:05] the defendant the plaintiffs the
[1:28:07] prosecutors and things they don't sit
[1:28:09] there and talk to all the audience
[1:28:10] that's in there
[1:28:12] the judge oversees the thing but who do
[1:28:14] they go to and try and get in their ear
[1:28:15] and really prove something
[1:28:17] the jury
[1:28:19] because it's the jury that actually
[1:28:21] decide
[1:28:24] no matter how much the judge may think
[1:28:25] he's guilty if the jury acquits him
[1:28:30] he's free
[1:28:31] so the word as it comes forth it comes
[1:28:34] in our minds first and that's our jury I
[1:28:35] believe it
[1:28:37] and then the judge whenever the jury and
[1:28:40] I'm not a lawyer by any means
[1:28:43] but from my understanding whenever the
[1:28:45] jury actually gives
[1:28:47] the verdict they a lot they sometimes
[1:28:49] make like a recommendation and then the
[1:28:51] judge actually sentences according to
[1:28:54] the law
[1:28:56] so the jury is the mind the word is
[1:28:58] being preached and you decide is it true
[1:29:00] or is it not
[1:29:02] and then the judge is how we Act
[1:29:07] because your actions speak louder than
[1:29:08] your words
[1:29:10] so if we believe the word if we receive
[1:29:11] the promise and we say Lord I believe
[1:29:15] but then we act like we don't believe do
[1:29:17] we really believe but whenever we
[1:29:20] receive the word and we water it and we
[1:29:22] go out and we thank you Lord for healing
[1:29:23] me thank you Lord ahead of time before
[1:29:25] you see it anyone can praise the Lord
[1:29:27] after it happens
[1:29:28] but what about right that in between
[1:29:32] what about when you pray for your
[1:29:34] prodigal
[1:29:36] and you cry for your prodigal but you
[1:29:38] don't see an improvement
[1:29:40] you don't see an improvement
[1:29:43] what about when you ask and begot to
[1:29:46] heal you and he continued being sick
[1:29:50] what about when you've prayed and you've
[1:29:52] prayed and you prayed but he seems
[1:29:54] silent
[1:29:56] but I've got good news for you he never
[1:29:58] stops working
[1:30:01] remember time and what you see are your
[1:30:03] biggest enemies but it's what you do in
[1:30:06] the waiting that defines you
[1:30:10] what you do whenever after you receive
[1:30:12] the word but before it's manifested
[1:30:15] between that time which can be a long
[1:30:17] time or it can be a short time whatever
[1:30:19] God's sovereignty
[1:30:21] plays out
[1:30:24] how we act and how we take God at his
[1:30:27] word is what defines us
[1:30:29] because whenever you receive the word
[1:30:31] and we go out these doors and we rejoice
[1:30:33] and then Monday morning hits us Mr
[1:30:36] skeptic is going to come visit you he's
[1:30:38] gonna come knocking
[1:30:40] Mr impatience can come knock on with
[1:30:42] probably two Fists
[1:30:44] but don't open that door
[1:30:47] how are they going to come knocking in
[1:30:49] here
[1:30:51] it's been three weeks since God made me
[1:30:53] that promise
[1:30:54] and I still don't see it
[1:30:57] don't open that door
[1:31:00] but you know as brother Brandon whenever
[1:31:02] he preached a court trial he went
[1:31:03] through witness after witness have to
[1:31:05] witness and I love it at the end he said
[1:31:07] the last defense witness I like to call
[1:31:09] he said is me
[1:31:14] and he began to break down how God
[1:31:17] commissioned him
[1:31:18] how he met an angel how the pillar of
[1:31:21] fire came down the Ohio River
[1:31:23] how could how in the world humanly
[1:31:26] speaking could a man a simple man with
[1:31:29] that kind of background
[1:31:31] ever go seven times around the world
[1:31:33] pray for Kings do all the things that he
[1:31:35] did how in the world but he had to be
[1:31:37] patient
[1:31:39] and God brought it to pass
[1:31:43] so his brother brand put himself on the
[1:31:44] defense Witness
[1:31:47] to defend the word so may I
[1:31:54] and we can all no doubt stand up and
[1:31:57] testify and defend the word
[1:32:02] when Wesley couldn't even walk
[1:32:05] of course not only could he not walk but
[1:32:07] he wouldn't even show any desire to even
[1:32:09] stand
[1:32:10] none
[1:32:12] Enoch is only nine months old and he's
[1:32:14] already he's trying to get around
[1:32:18] Wesley was I passed his first birthday
[1:32:21] show no sign
[1:32:23] and we take of the chiropractor just
[1:32:25] kept praying and you know it works on
[1:32:27] Mothers especially
[1:32:31] they're the ones that are going to
[1:32:32] notice
[1:32:34] so you know and brother Ron has
[1:32:36] testified this a lot but the Lord showed
[1:32:37] brother Ron a vision that he would walk
[1:32:41] and of course we'll never forget forget
[1:32:42] that service especially you know in our
[1:32:44] in my family and things but the Lord
[1:32:46] showed my vision but we after that
[1:32:48] Vision or after that service rather
[1:32:51] we had a choice to make
[1:32:54] would we hold on to it and live in
[1:32:57] expectation and thank the Lord for it or
[1:32:59] when we took him home and tried to stand
[1:33:01] him up and he just
[1:33:02] clapsed down said well I guess
[1:33:06] no
[1:33:07] we had to hold on to it
[1:33:11] and it was a process of time and you
[1:33:13] know and then we begin to record it we
[1:33:15] would notice that first time when we put
[1:33:16] them in in this little deal that helps
[1:33:18] them walk he began to show just the
[1:33:20] first
[1:33:21] the first desire to do something
[1:33:25] so we've seen that and that was God
[1:33:27] giving us a little encouragement
[1:33:30] but it wasn't just as spontaneous God
[1:33:33] could have done it God could have had
[1:33:34] him jump out of my arms and run down
[1:33:36] right then but he chose to do it another
[1:33:38] way so what was it it was like a
[1:33:40] blooming flower it was a process because
[1:33:42] remember nature still acts the same way
[1:33:46] so as a blooming flower you know it
[1:33:48] began to just his development literally
[1:33:50] open before our very eyes
[1:33:53] now he runs and jumps and does
[1:33:55] everything because why God is faithful
[1:33:57] to his word God will bring it to pass
[1:34:02] as I was studying for this I was even
[1:34:03] you know thought of our dear Pastor
[1:34:05] brother Ron
[1:34:07] you think of what you know
[1:34:09] he's going through and we as a church
[1:34:11] that love him so much and people all
[1:34:12] over the world it brings us along on the
[1:34:15] journey too
[1:34:17] because we're burden for him
[1:34:19] in the initial report you know he
[1:34:21] brought initial fear and uncertainties
[1:34:23] and anxieties and things and you know as
[1:34:25] soon as it was announced my faith was
[1:34:27] Lord when he goes to the doctor and gets
[1:34:29] the scans may it show no cancer may do
[1:34:31] it may you just dissolve it that was my
[1:34:33] faith and that should that should be all
[1:34:35] of our faith and I believe it was
[1:34:38] but he went to the doctor
[1:34:40] and they actually found out it was
[1:34:41] cancer
[1:34:43] so do we just say oh well God don't work
[1:34:45] miracles no more
[1:34:47] no we can't believe him with every
[1:34:49] doctor appointment we're expecting the
[1:34:50] miraculous but if it doesn't happen then
[1:34:52] we're going to keep believing we're
[1:34:54] going to keep believing we're going to
[1:34:55] keep believing
[1:34:57] regardless of what the doctor reports
[1:34:59] hold keeps saying we hold on to his
[1:35:02] report
[1:35:03] and here we are three years later
[1:35:06] waiting on the Lord we know he's healed
[1:35:09] we believe he's healed
[1:35:13] but we're waiting on God
[1:35:16] you think of what kind of rugged
[1:35:19] Christian
[1:35:20] it takes
[1:35:22] where you're you're standing
[1:35:25] and you fill the Lord himself you feel
[1:35:28] the angel of the Lord you feel God
[1:35:30] himself and he comes you think God
[1:35:32] forgets of what you're going through
[1:35:36] you think God forgets when he comes and
[1:35:38] does something so special for somebody
[1:35:39] and he's standing here and he touches
[1:35:42] somebody's life and they're never the
[1:35:43] same do you think that the angel of the
[1:35:44] Lord forgets that the man praying for
[1:35:46] them has got cancer
[1:35:50] no
[1:35:51] God doesn't forget
[1:35:55] God knows
[1:35:56] but God has a plan because he's doing
[1:35:59] something and that that no I know that
[1:36:01] pleases the Lord that despite this
[1:36:05] despite what you're going through
[1:36:08] despite what he's going through he still
[1:36:10] ministers when he don't feel like it
[1:36:13] he's still you asking for prayer he
[1:36:15] still takes his your burden on him and
[1:36:18] prays for you
[1:36:21] we're waiting on the Lord we know it's
[1:36:23] done Lord
[1:36:24] We Believe
[1:36:27] the prophet of God was so sick
[1:36:30] he said my stomach gets sour and oh my
[1:36:33] brother Jack's help me around the house
[1:36:35] I walk around the house and just a hot
[1:36:38] greasy water like flying out of my mouth
[1:36:40] and walked to the pulpit and pray for
[1:36:43] people that was twice that bad and
[1:36:45] healed
[1:36:48] I've had him lay my hands on a man with
[1:36:50] a cancer on his face and the cancer left
[1:36:52] his face and standing there and I was so
[1:36:55] sick I couldn't hardly stand up
[1:36:59] did God forget that his Prophet was
[1:37:01] there and he was just so sick did God
[1:37:04] not care no but God has a had a plan for
[1:37:07] him and he had a plan for that person
[1:37:15] Indescribable Miracles taking place in
[1:37:17] the prophet's meetings
[1:37:19] and he was so sick standing there
[1:37:21] ministering
[1:37:24] God wants us to have patience
[1:37:28] we have to have patience for the coming
[1:37:29] of the Lord
[1:37:32] we get sick of this world
[1:37:36] we get so sick of this world we want to
[1:37:37] go home but we've got to have patience
[1:37:39] we're waiting on that last one God's not
[1:37:41] going to be a minute late
[1:37:45] God is like I said was patient waiting
[1:37:47] on us in second Thessalonians 3 5 and
[1:37:49] the Lord direct your hearts into the
[1:37:51] love of God and into the patient waiting
[1:37:53] for Christ
[1:37:58] you know whenever we get we're saved
[1:38:00] we're ready to go
[1:38:01] but what about the ones that aren't
[1:38:05] we have to be patient people the church
[1:38:06] all the church Ages were expecting him
[1:38:08] to come but they had to be patient
[1:38:11] in James 5 7 be patient therefore
[1:38:13] Brethren unto the coming of the Lord
[1:38:16] behold the husbandman waiteth for the
[1:38:18] precious fruit of the earth and hath
[1:38:20] long patience for it until he received
[1:38:22] the early and latter rain be ye also
[1:38:25] patient
[1:38:26] establish your hearts for the coming of
[1:38:28] the Lord draweth nigh
[1:38:31] you know all of creation is even waiting
[1:38:33] on us
[1:38:36] all of creation is waiting on the
[1:38:38] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:38:41] they're waiting on us to receive our
[1:38:44] change because they're because whenever
[1:38:46] Humanity fell they fell too
[1:38:51] they're waiting for our adoption our
[1:38:53] full adoption the change of our body
[1:38:56] in Mark 11 as we begin to close in Mark
[1:38:58] 11 22 and Jesus answering saith unto
[1:39:01] them have faith in God
[1:39:03] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:39:06] shall say unto this mountain
[1:39:08] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:39:10] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:39:12] but shall believe that those things
[1:39:14] which he said shall come to pass he
[1:39:16] shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:39:20] plow the Earth
[1:39:21] let's plow our hearts
[1:39:24] let's water it with praise
[1:39:27] and then wait for it to come
[1:39:29] in Psalm 27 14 wait on the Lord
[1:39:33] be of good courage
[1:39:35] and he shall strengthen thine heart
[1:39:37] wait I say on the Lord
[1:39:41] musicians can come on up
[1:39:44] be of good courage David said wait on
[1:39:47] the Lord be of good courage and he'll
[1:39:49] strengthen your heart
[1:39:52] as I said even in the early part of the
[1:39:54] service as a young person if you're
[1:39:55] trusting the Lord for a spouse let him
[1:39:58] wait on the Lord
[1:40:00] wait on the Lord
[1:40:04] because you know what there's nothing
[1:40:06] worse than the wrong one
[1:40:09] but there's nothing better than the
[1:40:10] right one
[1:40:13] nothing's better than the right one
[1:40:15] Psalm 135
[1:40:17] I wait for the Lord my soul doth wait
[1:40:20] and in his word do I hope my soul
[1:40:23] waiteth for the Lord more than they that
[1:40:25] watch for the morning I say more than
[1:40:28] they that watch for the morning
[1:40:30] maybe you've been trusting God for a
[1:40:32] promise a long time
[1:40:35] and you've allowed the sea to settle in
[1:40:37] good ground
[1:40:41] you've watered it with praise and and
[1:40:43] you've been waiting you've been trusting
[1:40:44] the Lord you've been crying out crying
[1:40:46] out crying out
[1:40:50] but as you're crying and as Life Goes On
[1:40:54] remember Satan likes to sow the prophet
[1:40:58] called it seeds of discrepancy
[1:41:03] so what he'll do
[1:41:05] is you till up the ground you till up
[1:41:07] your heart
[1:41:10] and you say Lord I need this from you
[1:41:14] or you promised me this
[1:41:19] you promised me this and you've been
[1:41:22] trusting and you've been you've been
[1:41:23] trusted for a long time and Satan has
[1:41:25] been germinating
[1:41:26] when he adds your guard down maybe in
[1:41:30] in moments of weakness
[1:41:32] of our Humanity
[1:41:37] Satan will begin to germinate seeds of
[1:41:40] doubt
[1:41:43] a frustration and impatience he likes to
[1:41:47] do that
[1:41:48] you keep your ground you keep your heart
[1:41:50] pure you love the Lord your Holy Ghost
[1:41:53] filled
[1:41:55] you're born again and you're trusting
[1:41:58] him
[1:41:59] and you've been waiting and you've been
[1:42:01] waiting
[1:42:02] and you've watched this one get blessed
[1:42:04] and you've rejoiced
[1:42:06] you've watched that one get blessed and
[1:42:08] you've rejoiced
[1:42:10] but yet in your own Humanity Satan can
[1:42:14] come and he'll just go by real quick in
[1:42:17] a weak moment and he'll throw some seeds
[1:42:19] in there
[1:42:22] and you may get a little frustrated
[1:42:25] because you've been asking God
[1:42:28] for a long time for something
[1:42:32] but yet or because the the things that
[1:42:35] we see and as time goes on we we get
[1:42:38] impatient
[1:42:41] and and then like I said them weeds of
[1:42:43] frustration begin to build
[1:42:45] they begin to sprout up
[1:42:49] may the Lord help us to take inventory
[1:42:53] because as we all raise our hands we all
[1:42:56] have needs we all have desires
[1:42:59] and we have to make sure that we keep
[1:43:01] may we by faith may we ask the Lord the
[1:43:04] Holy Ghost to come by
[1:43:06] and to get them weeds and and a
[1:43:09] circumstance and pull them out
[1:43:12] the impatience that we've had
[1:43:18] because when the weeds begin to crowd
[1:43:19] the weeds as they grow you're for the
[1:43:22] frustration will only get worse
[1:43:25] the impatience will only get worse and
[1:43:27] then the weeds will then try and choke
[1:43:29] out the promise you're hoping for the
[1:43:31] promise you're praying for the weeds
[1:43:33] will then begin like a vine to to wrap
[1:43:36] around it and try and choke out the
[1:43:38] promise choke out the faith that you do
[1:43:40] have
[1:43:42] we have to pull the weeds
[1:43:44] so the light of the s-o-n
[1:43:48] can get to the seed
[1:43:52] because if we have the seed in our
[1:43:54] hearts and then we and we've gotten it
[1:43:56] already but then the weeds always grow
[1:43:58] faster than the seed remember that
[1:44:01] we've all experienced it the weed always
[1:44:04] grows faster than the real thing
[1:44:06] so it's the impatience and the
[1:44:08] frustration will grow a lot quicker
[1:44:11] we've got to keep that pulled out
[1:44:15] we've got to water it with praise
[1:44:20] let's stand to our feet as we read is
[1:44:22] Ayah
[1:44:23] Isaiah chapter 30.
[1:44:26] and therefore
[1:44:28] will the Lord wait
[1:44:31] that he may be gracious unto you
[1:44:35] and therefore will he be exalted that he
[1:44:38] may have mercy upon you for the Lord is
[1:44:41] a god of judgment
[1:44:43] blessed are all they that wait for him
[1:44:49] for the Lord shall dwell in Zion at
[1:44:51] Jerusalem Thou shalt weep no more
[1:44:55] he will be very gracious unto thee at
[1:44:58] the voice of thy cry
[1:45:02] take this personal tonight
[1:45:06] when he shall hear it
[1:45:08] he will answer thee
[1:45:12] the answer is on the way
[1:45:15] even though you can't see it
[1:45:18] even though you've waited for a long
[1:45:20] time
[1:45:22] the answer is on the way
[1:45:26] God knows every tear you've cried about
[1:45:29] it
[1:45:31] he knows every bit of frustration
[1:45:34] because you know he subjected himself to
[1:45:36] time
[1:45:39] he hasn't forgotten you
[1:45:43] he hasn't forgotten you
[1:45:46] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:45:48] time but at the end it shall speak and
[1:45:50] not lie though it Terry wait for it
[1:45:53] because it
[1:45:54] will surely come
[1:45:56] it will not tear it
[1:46:00] this I recall to my mind therefore have
[1:46:03] I hope
[1:46:04] it is of the Lord's mercies that we are
[1:46:06] not consumed because his compassions
[1:46:09] fail not
[1:46:11] they are new every morning great is thy
[1:46:15] faithfulness
[1:46:16] the Lord is my portion saith my soul
[1:46:21] therefore will I hope in him
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:27] the Lord is good unto them that wait for
[1:46:30] him to the soul that seeketh him it is
[1:46:33] good that a man should both hope
[1:46:35] and quietly wait for the Salvation of
[1:46:38] the Lord
[1:46:41] the seed has been sown
[1:46:45] open up your heart and receive the word
[1:46:48] and make a declaration in your own heart
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:54] make a promise to yourself and to the
[1:46:56] Lord in his presence that no matter how
[1:46:59] long it takes
[1:47:01] I'm gonna believe
[1:47:04] though when I go and I don't see it and
[1:47:06] on Monday morning when I go and after I
[1:47:08] had a wonderful time in your presence
[1:47:10] take this presence with you and when you
[1:47:13] are and when you go during your work
[1:47:14] weekend you don't see a change in your
[1:47:16] healing you don't see a change in your
[1:47:18] loved one you don't see a change in the
[1:47:20] things that you want to be changed
[1:47:21] believe anyway
[1:47:24] because God is still working God is Not
[1:47:27] subjected to our senses
[1:47:32] faith will get him to move
[1:47:35] faith will bring him on the scene
[1:47:38] so let's take these moments in his
[1:47:40] presence
[1:47:41] let's search our hearts if there's any
[1:47:43] any weeds as I said that's trying to
[1:47:46] come up and choke the things we're
[1:47:47] praising the Lord for we're trusting him
[1:47:49] for may we take it out
[1:47:52] Lord we give ourselves to you
[1:47:55] Lord we thank you for your word we thank
[1:47:57] you Lord that your word is the truth and

[1:48:51] will that mean in eternity it will mean
[1:48:54] nothing
[1:48:55] the benefits of it and the patience and
[1:48:58] the character that it gave us will mean
[1:48:59] everything
[1:49:01] when we're there with our loved ones
