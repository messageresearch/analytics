[37:08] The cross has spoken.
[37:11] [Music]
[37:13] I am forgiven.
[37:17] The King of Kings calls me his own.
[37:26] Beautiful Savior,
[37:30] I'm yours forever.
[37:35] Jesus Christ
[37:37] my living.
[37:44] Hallelujah.
[37:48] Praise the one who set me free.
[37:53] Hallelujah.

[38:10] Jesus Christ,
[38:13] my living
[38:16] hope.
[38:18] Then came the morning
[38:23] that sealed the promise.
[38:26] [Music]
[38:27] Your buried body
[38:32] began to breathe.
[38:36] And out of the silence,
[38:40] the roaring lion
[38:45] declared, "The grave has no claim on
[38:50] me."
[38:53] And then came the morning
[38:58] that sealed the promise.
[39:02] Your buried body
[39:07] began to breathe.
[39:10] And out of the silence,
[39:15] the roaring lion
[39:20] declared the grave has no claim on me.
[39:29] Hallelujah.
[39:34] Praise the one who set me free.
[39:38] Hallelujah.
[39:43] Death has lost its grip on me. You have
[39:48] broken every chain.
[39:52] There's salvation
[39:54] in your name. Jesus Christ,
[39:59] my livinging
[40:02] hope.
[40:03] [Music]
[40:05] Jesus Christ,
[40:08] my livinging
[40:11] hope.
[40:12] [Music]
[40:16] [Applause]
[40:21] Hallelujah.
[40:23] Ain't it wonderful to be a Christian?
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't it wonderful to be a Christian?
[40:28] &gt;&gt; A living hope.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; A hope that cannot die and a hope that
[40:32] cannot fade away. What a what a blessing
[40:34] it is to be a Christian.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; I heard the prophet say it this evening.
[40:38] He said he said if I wasn't a Christian,
[40:39] he said, "I'd be a suicidal case."
[40:43] &gt;&gt; You think about the world that we're
[40:44] living in. If a prophet was saying that
[40:46] in 1960 and he was in a nervous
[40:48] condition, can you imagine where we
[40:50] would be at right now? Thank God to be a
[40:52] Christian. So I'm going ask you, how
[40:54] many's happy to be a Christian tonight?
[40:58] Are you thankful to be Christlike? to
[41:01] have the mind of Christ, to be separated
[41:04] from the world. Come on, somebody.
[41:06] Praise God.
[41:08] Won't you thank the Lord that he saved
[41:11] you from the rest of this old world and
[41:14] made you a Christian to fall in love
[41:17] with him more and more every single day.
[41:20] Hallelujah. I think we got something to
[41:22] praise the Lord for.
[41:25] Hallelujah.
[41:27] All my hope is in Jesus and he's my
[41:30] living hope.
[41:32] We got something to testify to the world
[41:34] about. My goodness. We're so excited to
[41:37] have our brother Nathan Ericson here

[45:06] Just want to say it's a real honor to be
[45:09] with you uh once again and just uh just
[45:12] been so looking forward to coming back
[45:14] down and and being a part of uh of your
[45:17] church here for for a weekend once
[45:19] again. And we love you all. We want to
[45:21] bring greetings from back home from
[45:23] brother Wayne Lawson, your good friend,
[45:25] and and all the saints there at True
[45:27] Word Tabernacle. Some of them tuning in
[45:29] tonight. And so, uh, there's just
[45:31] nothing like the family of God. Amen.
[45:33] And so, we, uh, we, we, this church,
[45:37] this family is very special to us. Been
[45:39] thinking on the drive down here just
[45:41] back through, uh, over 30 years of
[45:43] memories of Brother Ron coming up and
[45:45] preaching for us and ministering the
[45:48] word, hearing him different places. He
[45:49] was just uh so he's been so instrumental
[45:52] in my life. Words words can't uh I know
[45:55] I happen to know a lot of words but
[45:57] there are no words for for what brother
[45:59] Ron means to to me and and uh to our
[46:02] assembly there and the whole Spencer
[46:03] family. Amen. And and uh we love him
[46:06] very much and and we love you and uh
[46:09] I've been just so looking forward to
[46:10] being back with you. This is my third
[46:12] time I believe here with you and uh you
[46:14] just have treated me so well. I just
[46:16] feel right at home tonight and just
[46:18] looking forward to what the Lord has in
[46:19] store. I just want to be a help and
[46:21] encouragement to this church. We we're
[46:23] just fellow laborers for the kingdom of
[46:25] God. And so we're just trusting the Lord
[46:27] will just come on the scene. Amen. And
[46:29] bring some inspiration that'll that'll
[46:31] help and and encourage and uplift and uh
[46:34] we're certainly behind you 100%. Amen.
[46:37] We support you. We love you. Amen. We
[46:39] just want to we just want to say God
[46:42] bless you. As we turn to the word of
[46:43] God, we'll go to Isaiah the 40th
[46:46] chapter.
[47:00] Isaiah 40, we'll just read verses 10 and
[47:02] 11 here.
[47:14] I still hear those pages turning. If you
[47:16] have it, say, "Amen."
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Behold, the Lord God will come with
[47:21] strong hand, and his arms shall rule for
[47:24] him. Behold, his reward is with him, and
[47:27] his work before him. He shall feed his
[47:30] flock like a shepherd. He shall gather
[47:33] the lambs with his arm and carry them in
[47:36] his bosom and shall gently lead. Oh my,
[47:39] gently lead those that are with young.
[47:42] If you'd turn with me also to John
[47:43] chapter 10, we'll read verses 24 to 30
[47:47] there of John 10.
[47:51] Of
[47:54] course, uh this is a very significant
[47:57] moment in the scripture,
[48:00] very significant m moment in the
[48:02] ministry of Jesus Christ.
[48:06] Then came the Jews round about him and
[48:08] said unto him, "How long does thou make
[48:10] us to doubt?" Isn't that funny? They
[48:12] were accusing him of being the reason
[48:14] for their unbelief.
[48:16] How long does thou make us to doubt? If
[48:18] thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
[48:21] Jesus answered them, I told you, and you
[48:23] believe not. The works that I do in my
[48:26] Father's name, they bear witness of me.
[48:29] But you believe not, because you are not
[48:31] of my sheep, as I said unto you. My
[48:34] sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
[48:39] and they follow me, and I give unto them
[48:42] eternal life, and they shall never
[48:44] perish. Neither shall any man pluck them
[48:48] out of my hand. My father which gave
[48:51] them me is greater than all and no man
[48:53] is able to pluck them out of my father's
[48:55] hand. And he says the great words, I and
[48:58] my father are one. Amen. It's a
[49:02] beautiful scripture here. This little
[49:04] passage of scripture. It it identifies
[49:06] you as the sheep who hear his voice and
[49:10] it also positions you as in the hands of
[49:13] God. How many glad to be in his arms
[49:15] tonight? Amen. That's that's our
[49:17] position. And it assures us it assures
[49:20] us that we are safe from all harm. Uh
[49:22] I'd like to I'd like to uh preach to you
[49:24] tonight. I'll title it heaven's embrace.
[49:27] Maybe a little bit of an unusual title,
[49:29] but um but uh we just want to speak a
[49:32] little bit on heaven's embrace. Shall we
[49:33] have a word of prayer? Heavenly Father,
[49:36] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for that
[49:38] embrace. Lord, we we where would we be,
[49:42] Father, as brother Andrew was was
[49:45] testifying a moment ago, Lord, if you
[49:48] hadn't reached down your hand and picked
[49:50] us up, Lord. Lord, we thank you for your
[49:53] mercy. Lord, uh where would we be
[49:55] tonight without Lord you reaching down
[49:58] your hand, Father, I pray that tonight
[50:00] would not just be a church service,
[50:02] Lord, and just an observation of
[50:04] tradition. Lord, may you just take this
[50:06] meeting in your hands tonight. I pray
[50:08] you take this thought, these notes,
[50:10] Lord, this speaker, Lord, to this
[50:12] audience. And Lord, do something
[50:14] miraculous, Lord, with Lord, let let the
[50:16] heavenly Lord take over the earthly. And
[50:19] I just pray, Father, that somehow
[50:21] someway you would have your will
[50:22] tonight, Lord. Uh your will would be
[50:24] done, Father, that you would speak,
[50:26] Lord, to hearts tonight, Lord. There's
[50:28] there's great needs amongst us, Lord.
[50:31] Everybody here, Lord, has a need,
[50:33] Father. But it would just take one touch
[50:35] from that mighty arm. if you would Lord
[50:37] see fit to reach down Lord and and Lord
[50:40] and cover all of our insufficiencies
[50:42] with your blood tonight Lord and reach
[50:44] out your arm of grace I pray minister to
[50:46] your people Father have your way let
[50:49] your spirit move amongst us tonight Lord
[50:51] as we as we consider your word Father as
[50:53] we worship you Lord as we enjoy the
[50:56] truths Lord of of of Lord your grace
[50:59] grant it father let it be so we pray in
[51:01] the name of Jesus Christ amend bless you
[51:05] could be seated tonight.
[51:07] Amen. Uh uh speaking tonight on on
[51:09] heaven's embrace and you know uh the the
[51:12] the the way it is for me uh when
[51:15] preaching I just uh I sometimes I just I
[51:18] feel like I need to I almost stumble
[51:20] around a little bit and we might just
[51:21] kind of we might look around here kind
[51:23] of set up a little foundation and and
[51:25] and try to paint a little bit of a
[51:27] picture and then all of a sudden we'll
[51:28] just fall into that channel and then
[51:30] we'll we'll go. Okay. So, how many would
[51:32] just help me preach tonight? Amen. And I
[51:35] I uh uh appreciate your welcome spirit.
[51:37] Let's just let's just look at this. This
[51:39] may be a little bit of an unusual uh
[51:41] title as we say on heaven's embrace. But
[51:44] this comes from this comes from uh
[51:47] something that brother Brandham preached
[51:48] and it was the way that he would refer
[51:50] to to a very amazing moment in time when
[51:53] Jesus would come into the river and be
[51:56] baptized by John the Baptist. Amen. And
[51:58] how many know the story of how how how
[52:00] Jesus came and at that time nobody knew
[52:02] him as the Christ? Nobody recognized uh
[52:05] who he was or what he was there to do.
[52:08] But but but in that moment there was a
[52:10] there was a a a vindication. There was a
[52:13] sign. There was a light that came down
[52:15] in the form of a dove and and rested
[52:17] over the head of Christ. And and uh of
[52:20] course you know uh the Bible would say
[52:22] it's not that everybody saw that dove.
[52:24] Not everybody saw that light, but John
[52:25] the Baptist saw it and he's the one who
[52:27] witnessed of it. And we believe the
[52:29] report, don't we? Amen. and and uh and
[52:32] and so uh brother Brandon would would
[52:34] refer to the revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:37] in this way as this embrace. He he said
[52:39] that man was made in the image of God
[52:42] and then God came down in the image of
[52:44] man to redeem man and that brought man
[52:47] and God together. Heaven and earth he
[52:51] said hugged and kissed each other. God
[52:53] and man embraced each other as
[52:55] fatherhood and sunship when the logos
[52:58] became flesh and dwelt among us. What a
[53:01] what a powerful moment. Amen. Now, now
[53:04] we speak about the logos and and uh it's
[53:06] a theological term that we all know. But
[53:09] uh you know the logos is that word we
[53:11] know which was with God in the
[53:13] beginning. In the beginning was God and
[53:15] and the word was God. Amen. And and uh
[53:18] and and but the word we might say is the
[53:20] the word is that part of God. It's not a
[53:23] different God or a different person, but
[53:25] it's the part of the person of God which
[53:27] has been revealed to us. That would be
[53:29] the simple way to see it to say it.
[53:31] Amen. Amen. Because you know, God is
[53:33] he's beyond us. He's above us. He's uh
[53:36] he's outside of our grasp. He's uh he's
[53:38] God. He's the creator. He's a
[53:40] supernatural being. Amen. And so uh our
[53:43] only contact with God, the only way the
[53:46] the only way we could know God is as
[53:48] much as he would see fit to reveal
[53:50] himself to us. Amen. So otherwise
[53:52] there's no hope in a man or a woman.
[53:54] We're just uh you know, we'd still be
[53:56] scraping out a beastly existence down on
[53:58] this earth if it hadn't been God that
[54:00] would reach down his hand. Amen. And
[54:02] come and and begin to reveal himself to
[54:04] the human race. Amen. We we were fallen.
[54:07] We were lost. We were without hope.
[54:09] Amen. But God did not want it to stay
[54:11] that way. Amen. Our God uh our God, you
[54:15] know, after the fall in the Garden of
[54:16] Eden, God was untouchable to man. He he
[54:19] he was above us. He was beyond us. Amen.
[54:23] But in God's heart, we know today he
[54:26] there was a desire for fellowship with
[54:28] his sons and with his daughters. And
[54:30] because of that desire for fellowship,
[54:32] God began a great journey, amen, of
[54:34] coming down and humbling himself. And he
[54:37] began to condescend. He came through
[54:39] prophets and he came through messengers
[54:41] and he came through church ages and he
[54:43] amen. He time after time he would come
[54:45] and he would do things amongst the human
[54:46] race which would reveal to us who he is
[54:49] and Amen. and and and and and what he is
[54:52] and and how he thinks about us. Amen.
[54:54] And amen. And so there but there was a
[54:56] time when when even God as he began to
[54:58] he began to uh begin this process of
[55:01] self-revelation, there was a time when
[55:03] uh uh when when maybe we could see him
[55:05] but we couldn't touch him because he
[55:07] hadn't come all the way. Amen. That was
[55:09] the way it was for the children of
[55:10] Israel. Remember on Mount Si, Amen. They
[55:13] could look up and they could see God
[55:14] without question. They knew that God was
[55:16] over them. God was with them. God was
[55:18] dealing with them because they
[55:19] recognized a pillar of fire. Amen. But
[55:21] that pillar of fire represented a God
[55:23] that was so holy, a God that was so
[55:26] unattainable, a God that was so perfect
[55:28] that not only was it uh not only
[55:30] couldn't they touch that God, they
[55:32] couldn't even touch the mountain that he
[55:33] was on. And not even an insect could
[55:36] touch that mountain. Any beast that
[55:37] would touch that holy mountain, Amen,
[55:39] would have to be slain because of the
[55:41] awesome presence of a holy God. Now,
[55:44] that's a powerful God. That's a
[55:45] wonderful God. That's a Amen. That's a
[55:47] very impressive God. But but it's a but
[55:50] it's tragic to think of a God that would
[55:52] be that great and that majestic, but we
[55:54] could not touch him and we could not
[55:56] speak to him and we could not really lay
[55:58] our eyes upon him. Even Moses couldn't
[56:00] look at him. Amen. He could see the
[56:01] pillar of fire, but Amen. when uh when
[56:04] that logos passed before Moses, his
[56:06] eyes, he couldn't even look him in the
[56:08] face. All he could see was the hinder
[56:10] parts of a man. Amen. That great
[56:12] untouchable God. But but but but by the
[56:14] New Testament, we know that we are not
[56:16] come today to an untouchable mountain.
[56:19] Amen. Uh uh but Paul said, "You're not
[56:22] come to an untouchable mountain." Amen.
[56:24] You you come to Mount Zion and you have
[56:26] come to Jesus. Amen. Who is the mediator
[56:29] between God and man. So Amen. So when
[56:32] Jesus came on the earth and when Jesus
[56:33] came to the river and that anointing of
[56:36] the Holy Spirit came down and made
[56:38] contact with a perfect lamb of God,
[56:40] Amen. That was a very significant
[56:41] moment, friends, because that's when an
[56:43] untouchable God, amen, became touchable.
[56:46] He became visible. He became audible. He
[56:49] became a God that we could get in
[56:51] contact with. Amen. It wasn't that we
[56:53] went up to where God was, but God came
[56:56] down to where we were. Amen. And brought
[56:58] us to Mount Zion. Amen. Did a great work
[57:00] of mediation. Amen. And brother Brandham
[57:02] said when that happened, Amen. There was
[57:04] an embrace that took place. Amen.
[57:06] because Heavenly reached his arms down
[57:08] and took hold of earthly and God and man
[57:11] came into contact. Amen. When they've
[57:13] been separated ever since the fall. To
[57:16] me, it's a beautiful picture. I hope you
[57:18] Amen. I hope you could enjoy that
[57:19] tonight. Amen. As we begin to uh just
[57:22] look into this. Amen. You see, uh uh the
[57:25] Bible said in John chapter 1, it speaks
[57:27] of that father, that mysterious God. He
[57:29] said that no man knew the father at any
[57:31] time. Amen. God, the God, the God who
[57:34] created the universe, the God that
[57:35] created man, the God who holds all time
[57:38] and space and matter in his hands and
[57:40] everything exists for his purpose and
[57:42] for his pleasure. That was an
[57:44] untouchable God. Amen. But listen, Amen.
[57:47] When John writes these words, he says,
[57:49] "No man ever knew the father, but he
[57:51] said the logos declared him." Amen. The
[57:54] logos, the word that was with God in the
[57:56] beginning. Amen. He said, "Come into
[57:58] this day. He's come to the human race
[58:00] and he has declared the invisible
[58:02] father. Amen. And you can hear the
[58:04] passion in the words of John here at the
[58:06] beginning of the New Testament, John
[58:08] chapter 1. Amen. When he says, "No man
[58:10] ever knew the father but the logos
[58:12] declared him and our eyes beheld him."
[58:15] Amen. That God that was invisible, that
[58:17] God that was beyond us, that God that
[58:19] was untouchable came down. Amen. Amen.
[58:22] And John said, "And my eyes saw him and
[58:24] my hands touched him and I sat down and
[58:27] I had communion, amen, with my God."
[58:29] That's what happened. Amen. When Jesus
[58:31] came down in the river, Amen. Heaven,
[58:34] amen, took up earth in its embrace and
[58:36] God and man came back together in a
[58:39] great embrace of love. What a beautiful
[58:41] thing, friends. Now, I want you to
[58:43] realize now, now this will reveal to us
[58:45] what is in the heart of God. Amen.
[58:47] Because a God that great and a God that
[58:50] holy, Amen. an untouchable God. Amen. If
[58:53] we Amen. had the privilege that he would
[58:55] come down and take on flesh. Amen. And
[58:58] he would he would uh be sick like we are
[59:00] sick. Amen. He would pitch his tent with
[59:03] us. Brother Brandham said he'd be sad
[59:05] like we're sad. He'd feel pain like we
[59:07] feel pain. Amen. For God to do that and
[59:10] come in a way where he would be
[59:11] touchable. The only way that he would do
[59:13] something like that is if he wanted to
[59:15] be touched. Amen. And we are serving a
[59:17] God today. Amen. We're serving the Lord
[59:20] Jesus Christ. He's not a separated God.
[59:23] He's not just out in the universe
[59:24] somewhere. He's a God that took on
[59:26] flesh, and he came down and he lived
[59:28] with us, spoke with us, talked to us,
[59:31] touched us. Amen. So that we would know
[59:33] if you need something from the Lord
[59:35] tonight, God is a God who wants to be
[59:37] touched. And if you got faith in your
[59:39] heart tonight to reach out, Amen. Amen.
[59:42] And and cry out for your need, your
[59:44] faith can touch him. And only the hem of
[59:47] his garment is all that it would take.
[59:49] Amen. For you to be healed. Amen. For
[59:51] you to be set free, for you to be
[59:53] delivered. Amen. For your family to be
[59:55] restored. All it would take is a touch
[59:57] of the hem of his garment. Amen. But God
[1:00:00] didn't just give us a little corner of
[1:00:02] his cloak. Amen. God came down, amen,
[1:00:04] and reached out his arms and he gathered
[1:00:06] the human race up in an embrace. And God
[1:00:09] has pulled us back to the very heart of
[1:00:11] God, which Jesus Christ is. It's a It's
[1:00:14] a powerful thing to think. Amen. That
[1:00:16] God wanted us to be able to touch him.
[1:00:18] Amen. That's why that holy, sacred,
[1:00:21] untouchable fire that was over the heads
[1:00:23] of the children of Israel, that very
[1:00:25] same fire came down on the day of
[1:00:27] Pentecost. And he ca and he took a step
[1:00:29] lower. Amen. And a God that it was
[1:00:31] impossible to touch. Amen. Brother
[1:00:33] Brandham said he literally broke himself
[1:00:35] up into pieces and he took little licks
[1:00:38] off that pillar of fire. Amen. And he
[1:00:40] put it over the heads of all of his
[1:00:41] disciples. Amen. That's what God wants
[1:00:44] from the human race. Amen. He didn't
[1:00:46] send Jesus to start a church. And he
[1:00:48] didn't send a message to start another
[1:00:49] church. Amen. He sends the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:52] He sends the light, amen, that came off
[1:00:54] the logos before the foundation of the
[1:00:56] world. And he puts it in the individual.
[1:00:59] Amen. So that you don't have to go to
[1:01:01] church. Amen. Just to meet God. You
[1:01:03] don't have to touch a man. Amen. Or hear
[1:01:05] his words to meet God. Amen. God, Amen.
[1:01:08] wants to come and reside with you. Amen.
[1:01:11] He wants Amen. And he wants you to know
[1:01:13] him in a way where you can speak to him.
[1:01:15] You can touch him. You can see him.
[1:01:17] Amen. You can experience him. You can
[1:01:19] even feel him. Amen. That's the kind of
[1:01:22] God we're serving. Amen. A personal God.
[1:01:25] Amen. And that's a pattern that he said
[1:01:27] on the day of Pentecost. Amen. Is that
[1:01:29] his sons and daughters would not have to
[1:01:31] know him by a by a religious theory.
[1:01:34] Amen. By a mental exercise. Amen. But
[1:01:37] that every son or daughter of God must
[1:01:39] come, amen, to that pillar of fire and
[1:01:41] receive God by a personal contact. Amen.
[1:01:45] Amen. A personal contact. That's what is
[1:01:48] required. That's what the baptism of the
[1:01:50] Holy Ghost is. Brother Bram said that's
[1:01:52] the revelation of Jesus personally to
[1:01:55] you. Amen. So it's not a logos that we
[1:01:58] read about in the Bible, but it's a
[1:01:59] logos that has touched your life with a
[1:02:01] lick of fire. Amen. And got in contact
[1:02:04] with you. Amen. In other words, you
[1:02:07] touched the invisible God. How many got
[1:02:09] the Holy Ghost tonight? Amen. And then
[1:02:12] think of the privilege to know, Amen,
[1:02:14] that you have touched the untouchable
[1:02:16] God. You got a revelation, a vision of
[1:02:19] an un of an unseeable, amen, mysterious
[1:02:22] being. The logos himself revealed it to
[1:02:25] you. He revealed himself to you and now
[1:02:27] you're in heaven's embrace. And by his
[1:02:30] revelation, now you can touch the
[1:02:32] untouchable God. Brother Brandham said,
[1:02:34] he said, "We shouldn't even He said we
[1:02:35] really shouldn't even say I've got the
[1:02:37] Holy Ghost." He said, "You should say
[1:02:39] the Holy Ghost has got me." Oh, friends.
[1:02:43] Amen. What do you got a hold of tonight?
[1:02:45] But more importantly to know, Amen.
[1:02:47] What's got a hold of you? Amen. That
[1:02:50] Holy Ghost that he gave you, Amen.
[1:02:52] That's that's not just an emotion.
[1:02:54] That's not just a that's not just a
[1:02:56] tingle to run up and down your spine.
[1:02:58] It's not a it's not a church membership.
[1:03:00] It's not a feeling. Amen. It is the
[1:03:02] touch of God. Amen. It is the arm of God
[1:03:04] that reached down and got a hold of your
[1:03:06] life and crowned you with a lick off
[1:03:08] that pillar of fire to make you his son
[1:03:10] and make you his daughter. Amen. Brother
[1:03:13] Brandon would say when God came into the
[1:03:15] river there when Jesus was baptized and
[1:03:17] the dove came down, he said that's when
[1:03:19] God and man became one. We're building a
[1:03:22] foundation here. Stay with me now.
[1:03:24] That's when heaven and earth embraced
[1:03:26] each other. Hallelujah. That's when God
[1:03:28] was made flesh and brought it. And
[1:03:30] that's when God came down from the
[1:03:32] spirit form and was made a man and dwelt
[1:03:34] among us. He said, "That's when all
[1:03:36] eternities embraced each other." That's
[1:03:38] when the human fallen race of Adam's
[1:03:40] people and Jehovah God and every angel
[1:03:43] come together when God and man was made
[1:03:45] one on that great memorial day when John
[1:03:48] baptized Jesus. Now, I want you to
[1:03:51] notice the power of this picture. Now,
[1:03:53] Brother Brandham, when he begins to
[1:03:54] explain this, he's going to put great
[1:03:56] emphasis on something. Amen. That it was
[1:03:58] a lamb and it was a dove. And the dove,
[1:04:00] he said, could only come down on a lamb
[1:04:03] because they both have a compatible
[1:04:05] nature. Amen. The dove couldn't come
[1:04:07] down. He I I if Jesus had had the nature
[1:04:10] of a wolf, Amen. the the dove could have
[1:04:12] never touched him. If Jesus had had the
[1:04:14] nature of a lion, the dove could have
[1:04:16] never touched him. Amen. But it was
[1:04:18] because Jesus was there in the form of a
[1:04:20] lamb. He was humble. He was weak. He was
[1:04:24] simple. Amen. It was the meekness of the
[1:04:26] lamb. Brother Bram said that's why the
[1:04:28] Holy Spirit could come and touch him
[1:04:30] because a dove and a lamb both have that
[1:04:31] gentle nature. Amen. Amen. And so there
[1:04:34] has to be a compatibility there. Amen.
[1:04:37] For that touch. Now, now that's the
[1:04:39] thing about it, friends, is that human
[1:04:40] beings there there's been so many proud
[1:04:42] men. There's been so many great men and
[1:04:45] great minds and and great people. Think
[1:04:47] of it now. Great intellectual
[1:04:49] philosophers and great religious leaders
[1:04:52] and rulers of men and rich men and
[1:04:54] famous men and Amen. Uh great great
[1:04:57] people. Amen. Many of them have tried to
[1:05:00] climb up the mountain to try to find
[1:05:02] God. Amen. Some of you maybe have done
[1:05:04] that in your life. You at some point you
[1:05:06] you you went up the mountain literally
[1:05:08] or metaphorically. Amen. You tried to
[1:05:10] climb up. Amen. And and look for God and
[1:05:12] you didn't find him there. And they
[1:05:14] never find him there. The reason is when
[1:05:16] man goes climbing to meet God. Amen. He
[1:05:19] passes him halfway. Amen. Because God,
[1:05:22] amen, did not require man, amen, to
[1:05:24] climb up to where he was. It was God
[1:05:27] that came down, amen, and the greater
[1:05:29] you try to make yourself. And the more
[1:05:31] of a great person you're trying to be,
[1:05:33] the farther away you are from God. But
[1:05:35] that's good news to somebody who's got a
[1:05:37] lot of weakness tonight. That's good
[1:05:39] news to somebody who's humble, somebody
[1:05:41] who's lowly, somebody your the world
[1:05:44] gave up on you. Amen. Because God, Amen,
[1:05:47] is looking for somebody like that. Amen.
[1:05:50] When God came down, he didn't want to be
[1:05:52] touched by kings and popes and priests
[1:05:54] and religious leaders. He wanted to be
[1:05:56] touched by the lowest of the low. Amen.
[1:05:59] Grace came all the way down. It went
[1:06:01] after drunkards. It went after drug
[1:06:03] addicts. It went after prostitutes. It
[1:06:06] went after the lowest wretched Amen.
[1:06:08] most filthy people of the world. Amen.
[1:06:10] Why? So that you and I wouldn't glory in
[1:06:12] who we are. Amen. But if this dove that
[1:06:15] I'm talking about can find a lamb
[1:06:17] somewhere. Amen. Maybe maybe it's legs
[1:06:20] have been broken. Amen. Maybe it's been
[1:06:22] lost and wandered. Amen. But if he can
[1:06:24] get a hold of your life, friends, amen,
[1:06:26] there are arms tonight. Amen. Which can
[1:06:29] reach out, Amen. into the lowest, most
[1:06:32] wretched condition and pull you out and
[1:06:34] pull you into an embrace of love like
[1:06:36] you never imagined.
[1:06:39] Hallelujah. Oh my. He already came down.
[1:06:42] So they get up there on the mountain.
[1:06:44] Amen. and they're a great bishop and
[1:06:46] they're a great theologian, great
[1:06:48] leaders, great men, great women. Amen.
[1:06:51] But they don't find God because God left
[1:06:53] the mountain and came down to where we
[1:06:54] were.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Heaven didn't come looking for heavenly
[1:06:59] for this embrace. He was looking for
[1:07:01] earthly. Heavenly was looking for
[1:07:04] earthly. That's what the message all
[1:07:06] about. Friends, some people think the
[1:07:08] message was sent so that the most super
[1:07:10] duper uh uh most advanced, most
[1:07:12] intellectual, most religious, spiritual
[1:07:15] people, amen, could get the message and
[1:07:17] do something with it. That's not what
[1:07:19] the message is for. Amen. The message
[1:07:21] came down so the most weak, wretched,
[1:07:24] ridiculous, unlikely, overlooked,
[1:07:28] rejected, Amen. Uh backsliden, sinful,
[1:07:31] Amen. The lowest people of the world,
[1:07:33] God sent a message. Amen. And when the
[1:07:36] churches kicked you out, Jesus came
[1:07:37] knocking on your door. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:41] Friends, look, if you if you're looking
[1:07:42] at this message tonight and you're
[1:07:44] thinking, "Well, I believe it. I think
[1:07:46] it's amazing. I think it's powerful, but
[1:07:48] I I it could never be for me because I
[1:07:51] am weak and because I am meek and
[1:07:54] because I struggle with things and
[1:07:55] because I came out of a certain
[1:07:57] background and because I came out of
[1:07:58] certain conditions, well, then the
[1:08:00] message must not be for me." I like the
[1:08:02] way brother Isaac preached it and it was
[1:08:04] in New Zealand actually. Amen. I heard
[1:08:06] brother Isaac Hatfield preach it this
[1:08:07] way one time. I love it. He said there's
[1:08:09] a lot of people that think they're too
[1:08:11] weak for the message. No. He said the
[1:08:13] reality is there's a lot of people too
[1:08:14] strong for the message of the hour. But
[1:08:17] you can never be too weak. Amen. That
[1:08:19] the arms of God can reach down by this
[1:08:22] end time revelation. Amen. And get a
[1:08:24] hold of your life. Amen. And unlock a
[1:08:26] potential in you. It'll surprise you.
[1:08:29] Amen. and what you can do if you could
[1:08:30] ever get in his arms. That's who the
[1:08:32] message is for. It's to the lowly. The
[1:08:35] Bible 1 Corinthians 1 says, "You see
[1:08:37] your calling, brethren. Not many mighty
[1:08:39] men after the flesh are called. Not many
[1:08:41] noble and not oh, not many educated, not
[1:08:45] many popular, not many talented, not
[1:08:47] many Amen. No, it's not the great people
[1:08:50] of the world that God reached down for."
[1:08:52] Amen. It said he took the weak things of
[1:08:55] the world, Amen. to overthrow the
[1:08:57] strong. Amen. And he takes the foolish
[1:09:00] things of the world to confound the
[1:09:02] wise. Amen. That and friends, I'm that
[1:09:05] foolishness of God tonight. Amen. I'm
[1:09:07] that foolishness. Amen. But the thing
[1:09:10] is, Amen. I have touched that
[1:09:12] untouchable God. Amen. The Bible says,
[1:09:14] "To whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:09:16] revealed?" See there, he said, "He hath
[1:09:19] no form." Jesus said, he said, "When
[1:09:21] Jesus comes, he'll have no form or
[1:09:23] comeliness." Amen. And when we'll see
[1:09:25] him, there's no beauty that we should
[1:09:27] desire him. Amen. Think of when Jesus
[1:09:30] came, he came so humble. He looked so
[1:09:32] weak. He looked so he looked so human
[1:09:34] and so frail. Amen. That the great men
[1:09:37] of his day could not receive him because
[1:09:38] he didn't impress him enough. Amen. But
[1:09:41] when he began to go down the the the
[1:09:42] highways and the byways and when he
[1:09:45] would go down amongst the Amen. the real
[1:09:47] the real people. Amen. The Amen. with
[1:09:49] their struggles and with their sins and
[1:09:51] Amen. and with all of the things that
[1:09:53] they were dealing with and Amen. and
[1:09:55] their addictions and their and their
[1:09:57] fornications and their cursing and all
[1:09:59] that and all those things. Amen. The ter
[1:10:02] he found them in that terrible
[1:10:03] condition. Amen. But because these
[1:10:06] people were weak and because these
[1:10:07] people were meek, because they were
[1:10:10] lowly, they could receive the revelation
[1:10:12] of God. Amen. That's what heaven came
[1:10:15] looking for. Heaven didn't come down to
[1:10:17] get heavenly into his embrace. Amen. But
[1:10:19] this embrace is between heaven and
[1:10:21] earth. You say, "Brother Nathan, I'm so
[1:10:23] human. I'm so frail. I'm so weak."
[1:10:26] That's what God's looking for. Amen. But
[1:10:28] let him get his arms around you one
[1:10:30] time. Amen. He said, "My strength is
[1:10:33] made perfect in what?" In weakness.
[1:10:36] Amen. You say, You say, "I'm weak,
[1:10:38] brother Nathan." Good. You're a good
[1:10:40] candidate for the strength of God to
[1:10:42] display itself. When you can't do it,
[1:10:44] when you can't figure it out, Amen.
[1:10:47] That's when the strength of God can
[1:10:48] really be glorified. Amen. That's what
[1:10:51] he's looking for. Amen. And if you meet
[1:10:53] him in that humility, that's where
[1:10:55] you'll find him. That's where you'll
[1:10:57] find him. Amen. When in that human now
[1:11:00] look, never He's such a gentle savior.
[1:11:04] But never mistake gentleness for
[1:11:06] weakness.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Never mistake gentleness for weakness.
[1:11:10] No sir, it's not the same thing. Amen.
[1:11:13] But the scripture would say in Isaiah 42
[1:11:14] would speak of of Christ and when he
[1:11:16] would come and it's a judgment
[1:11:18] scripture. It's a scripture about him
[1:11:20] bringing judgment. Amen. But I love the
[1:11:22] words that uh my son is named after my
[1:11:24] son Reed. He's named after this
[1:11:26] scripture. He says a bru when he comes
[1:11:28] now Isaiah says a bruised reed he will
[1:11:31] not break. In other words like a reed or
[1:11:34] a cattail or something. It's been
[1:11:36] bruised. It's been it's been bent and
[1:11:38] bruised. Amen. But he'll come by and
[1:11:40] when he passes by that bruised reed,
[1:11:42] he'll come so gentle with his judgment.
[1:11:45] Amen. The Bible said he won't break it
[1:11:46] off.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And even a and even he said a
[1:11:49] smoking flax. Amen. He will not quench.
[1:11:52] Flax is just about the most fragile
[1:11:54] little fiber of a plant. Amen. And he
[1:11:57] but when he passes it by, Amen. He
[1:11:59] wouldn't even blow out a candle. He
[1:12:01] wouldn't even put out a little a little
[1:12:02] ember on a smoking flax. Amen. And he
[1:12:05] says uh he says, "But he shall bring
[1:12:07] forth judgment unto truth." I'm talking
[1:12:10] about a gentle savior. Friends, I know
[1:12:12] we've heard a lot of sermons preached
[1:12:14] about sinners in the hands of an angry
[1:12:16] god. Let me tell you something about
[1:12:18] sons and daughters in the hands of a
[1:12:20] gracious father. Amen. You see, his arms
[1:12:23] when he gets a hold of one of his
[1:12:24] children, they're very gentle arms. You
[1:12:27] might be bruised tonight. You might have
[1:12:29] been mistreated. I don't know your
[1:12:31] background. You might have been hurt.
[1:12:33] Amen. Maybe people have hurt you.
[1:12:35] Churches have hurt you. You think the
[1:12:37] message has hurt you. Amen. But the
[1:12:39] message, the real message is Christ. And
[1:12:41] Christ has never hurt one of his own.
[1:12:43] Amen. No, he's gentle. Friends, you've
[1:12:45] been bruised in your life. I tell you
[1:12:47] what, this message won't break you.
[1:12:49] Amen. But Christ, Amen, will reach his
[1:12:51] gentle hand. Amen. And he can fix you.
[1:12:54] Amen. If you're ill, I know our flame
[1:12:57] gets real fragile sometimes. And we feel
[1:12:59] like just the littlest puff of air, just
[1:13:01] a heart, just a little one harsh word is
[1:13:03] all it would take. Amen. To kill our
[1:13:05] flame, Amen. and and just snuff us out.
[1:13:08] Amen. But my gentle savior, he knows
[1:13:10] what to do with weak Christians. He
[1:13:12] knows what to do with a weak flame. He
[1:13:14] knows how to bring the revival fire.
[1:13:17] Amen. And fan it up in your life again.
[1:13:19] Amen. He won't snuff you out. Amen. And
[1:13:22] oh, you say, "Oh, and brother Nathan,
[1:13:24] I'm backslid." The prophet said, "We
[1:13:26] backslide every day." Amen. But the
[1:13:28] point is, there's a gentle savior. Amen.
[1:13:30] Who reached down his hand and he's got a
[1:13:32] hold on your life. He didn't save you
[1:13:34] yesterday to lose you today. But his
[1:13:37] with his gentle hands, he knows how to
[1:13:39] work with us. He knows how to work with
[1:13:40] our weakness. Oh, it's good to be in the
[1:13:43] arms of God. Hallelujah. I know. You
[1:13:46] know, we go through things as
[1:13:47] Christians. We have disappointments. We
[1:13:49] have hard trials. That's called the
[1:13:51] tender hand of Jehovah. And the day will
[1:13:54] come, the day will come when you look
[1:13:56] back, no matter how horrible what you've
[1:13:58] been through, you look back and say,
[1:14:00] "But I can see the tender hand of God
[1:14:02] that was guiding me all the way." Amen.
[1:14:05] He was Amen. Oh, the gentle hands of the
[1:14:08] Savior. See, the world is full of better
[1:14:11] men, more religious men, better people,
[1:14:14] a better class. Amen. But God sent a
[1:14:17] humble message today to put it in the
[1:14:20] hands of a humble bride. And God is
[1:14:22] going to take a humble little bride that
[1:14:24] the world didn't hold out hope for.
[1:14:26] Amen. And he is going to do the
[1:14:27] miraculous. He's going to put her in a
[1:14:29] rapture. She's going to do the greater
[1:14:31] works. She's going to do mighty things.
[1:14:34] Not by her own strength, but by his
[1:14:36] strength. Amen. Amen. He put the message
[1:14:39] in your hands. Well, of course, we would
[1:14:41] think about Simeon. How many know the
[1:14:43] story about Simeon in the temple? Amen.
[1:14:45] When they took Jesus on, Amen. down to
[1:14:48] the temple to be dedicated, there was a
[1:14:50] man there named Simeon. I love the way
[1:14:51] brother Brown talks about him. Simeon.
[1:14:54] Now, he wasn't an important person
[1:14:55] there. He wasn't maybe an official. He
[1:14:58] wasn't the high priest. He might not He
[1:15:01] might have had a rank or a position. It
[1:15:03] was just Simeon. And I I'm not a great
[1:15:06] storyteller. I let brother Brandham do
[1:15:08] it. He's so good at it. Brother Brandham
[1:15:10] would say, "Let's say it's Monday
[1:15:11] morning. Hundreds of babies are born
[1:15:14] every day.
[1:15:15] Amen. But it's Monday morning. It's all
[1:15:18] busy all around the temple. Think of how
[1:15:20] bit, you know, just elbow to elbow,
[1:15:21] people moving around and milling around
[1:15:23] and just chaos everywhere. And he said,
[1:15:26] "And Caiaphas, the high priest, he's
[1:15:28] sitting back with his fan as a judge."
[1:15:31] Amen. Knowing nothing about it. He said,
[1:15:34] "The priests are on their their regular
[1:15:37] routine. They're arguing about what kind
[1:15:39] of buttons they should wear on their
[1:15:40] shirt." Amen. And and there's an old man
[1:15:44] now by the name of Simeon. He's sitting
[1:15:46] in the prayer room, maybe reading
[1:15:48] Isaiah.
[1:15:50] Amen. And brother Br would say that that
[1:15:52] old Simeon there, he's sitting in the
[1:15:53] temple amidst all the hustle and bustle.
[1:15:56] Amen. And he said, but the Holy Ghost
[1:15:58] had made a promise to Simeon. Amen. And
[1:16:00] promised him, he said, Simeon, before
[1:16:02] you die, you're going to lay eyes, Amen.
[1:16:05] on the Messiah. Amen. You're not going
[1:16:07] to leave this world until you get a
[1:16:10] personal vision of my redeemer. Amen.
[1:16:13] And so, but I love what brother Bam
[1:16:14] said. He said, "Now, and the same Holy
[1:16:16] Ghost that promised he would see the
[1:16:19] Messiah, the same Holy Ghost led him to
[1:16:22] him." Oh, I'm thinking of my life today.
[1:16:25] Amen. How how that you know, I was
[1:16:27] raised in the message. I've got the
[1:16:29] pedigree. I cut my teeth on a pew like
[1:16:32] many of the young people sitting here.
[1:16:33] That didn't get me any closer to God.
[1:16:35] might as well been on a bar stool. Amen.
[1:16:37] But there was something the Lord did. He
[1:16:39] put a desire down in this heart. Amen.
[1:16:41] That said, I want to know God. I want to
[1:16:44] know re something real. I want real. I
[1:16:47] want reality. I want meaning. I want
[1:16:50] purpose. I'm desiring that. Amen. And
[1:16:53] one day, how many remember, Amen, the
[1:16:56] first time the Lord put that in your
[1:16:57] heart? Something waken on the inside.
[1:16:59] Said, I'm desiring after the things of
[1:17:01] God. Amen. I want to know him. I don't
[1:17:03] want to just read about him. I want to
[1:17:05] know him. Oh, hallelujah. It was the
[1:17:08] Holy Ghost that gave you that desire.
[1:17:11] Amen. But one day, amen, you came across
[1:17:13] this message. Amen. And the light
[1:17:15] flashed across your eyes. And in that
[1:17:17] moment, the same Holy Ghost that put the
[1:17:19] desire in you led you right to the
[1:17:21] answer. That's what the message is,
[1:17:23] friends. It's the answer to the heart's
[1:17:26] cry. There's a deep call in a man or a
[1:17:28] woman, a deep call for something real,
[1:17:31] for something true. Amen. But when this
[1:17:34] message came forth, deep responded.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God reached out his arm to bring a
[1:17:40] bride into his embrace. Oh, the same
[1:17:43] Holy Ghost that promised. And now look
[1:17:45] at Simeon. Now think of where he's
[1:17:46] standing now in the temple. Amen. Can
[1:17:48] you give me a little more on the
[1:17:49] monitors, brothers? Amen. He's standing
[1:17:52] there in the temple. Amen. And he's
[1:17:54] holding a little baby in his arms. Oh
[1:17:57] my. Amen. And of all the people in
[1:18:00] Israel, of all the priests, the high
[1:18:04] priests, the princes, Herod, Caesar, of
[1:18:07] all the people in the world, here's
[1:18:09] Simeon, and he's holding in his hands a
[1:18:12] little baby, and he's got him cradled in
[1:18:14] his arms. Amen. And it's the very child
[1:18:18] that will save the world.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Simeon would say, "My eyes have
[1:18:23] seen thy salvation." That's what happens
[1:18:25] when a man or woman's born again. Amen.
[1:18:28] The world doesn't change. Politics
[1:18:30] doesn't change. Amen. The economy
[1:18:33] doesn't change. The world goes on like
[1:18:34] nothing ever happened. Amen. But blessed
[1:18:37] are your eyes. And because the invisible
[1:18:39] God has become visible to you. And now
[1:18:42] to think we're holding in our arms a
[1:18:44] message. Oh. Amen. Mine eyes have seen
[1:18:47] that salvation. Oh, if you only knew
[1:18:50] what you got a hold of tonight. Amen.
[1:18:52] You say, "I'm a message believer,
[1:18:53] Brother Nath. I believe God sent a
[1:18:54] prophet." Amen. But if you only knew
[1:18:57] what you're clinging to. Oh yeah. Simeon
[1:19:00] said this will be a sign that's spoken
[1:19:01] against. Oh yeah. Anytime God does
[1:19:04] anything, it's criticized. It's
[1:19:05] disbelieved. Amen. Not the world will
[1:19:08] never see what God does cuz he doesn't
[1:19:10] send it to the great big world. He sends
[1:19:11] it to little small people. Oh. Amen. But
[1:19:15] look. Amen. We've had a sign that was
[1:19:17] spoken against. Amen. How many times in
[1:19:19] prayer lines, Brother Van would reach
[1:19:21] hell. Amen. He would begin to discern
[1:19:23] hearts. Amen. the miracles would happen.
[1:19:26] All those kind of things would take
[1:19:27] place. Amen. Brother Bam said, "What are
[1:19:30] they touching?" He said, "They're not
[1:19:31] touching me. They're touching the high
[1:19:33] priest. They're touching Jesus Christ in
[1:19:36] the Holy Ghost." He said, "It's the same
[1:19:38] one that led Simeon."
[1:19:40] Amen. Now, now I know people criticize,
[1:19:43] Amen. with that gift that was in Brother
[1:19:45] Brandham. People called him a fortune
[1:19:46] teller. They called it uh mental
[1:19:48] telepathy. They called it cold reading.
[1:19:50] They they considered all those kind of
[1:19:51] things. When brother Bran would stand in
[1:19:53] a pulpit, he would begin to speak
[1:19:54] people. He would say, he would say,
[1:19:56] "Your name is this. You come from here.
[1:19:59] Amen. Here's what you're praying for.
[1:20:01] This is what you're thinking in your
[1:20:02] heart." And yeah, people would criticize
[1:20:04] that. But what about the one it happened
[1:20:06] to?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; What about the one it happened to? Amen.
[1:20:10] For that one, it was different. Amen.
[1:20:12] Because they realized they'd made
[1:20:14] contact with a God. Amen. Who knew
[1:20:16] everything about him. Amen. A God that
[1:20:19] was imaginary a moment before. Now he
[1:20:21] became tangible.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. What would Brother
[1:20:26] Bram say? Many times, Amen. Somebody
[1:20:28] would recognize, Amen, that it wasn't a
[1:20:30] man speaking to them, but they were
[1:20:32] hearing the voice of God. Oh, and they
[1:20:34] would cut loose and they would begin to
[1:20:36] just they would begin to cry out. They'd
[1:20:38] be affected by the experience. And
[1:20:40] Brother Anne would say, what would he
[1:20:42] say? He'd say, "Now, what did she touch?
[1:20:45] Now, what did he touch?" Oh, friends,
[1:20:47] what did you touch? Amen. The first time
[1:20:50] you came across this message,
[1:20:52] Amen. and you heard, Amen, what you
[1:20:55] thought was the words of a man. But as
[1:20:56] you listened, amen, you began to realize
[1:20:59] there was deity speaking to you. There
[1:21:02] was something, amen, there was a voice
[1:21:04] behind the voice. Amen. And that knew
[1:21:06] who you were and knew what you were
[1:21:08] thinking and knew what you desired down
[1:21:10] in the deepest places of your heart.
[1:21:12] Amen. What did you touch, friends? Amen.
[1:21:15] I'm talking to a people, amen, who have
[1:21:17] touched God. Amen. this bride. Amen. She
[1:21:20] may be criticized. Amen. She may be made
[1:21:22] fun of. She may not be she may be uh she
[1:21:25] may not be a great class of people.
[1:21:27] Amen. But she's a people who has touched
[1:21:29] God. She has touched the untouchable
[1:21:31] God. Amen. Because the logos has
[1:21:34] revealed himself in a very personal way
[1:21:38] by the message of the hour. Oh yeah.
[1:21:41] Simeon said now, "Oh, some will rise,
[1:21:43] some will fall." He said, "This this
[1:21:45] this baby is going to turn the world
[1:21:48] upside down." There's some people
[1:21:50] because of this baby are going to come
[1:21:52] from the lowest position all the way to
[1:21:54] the heavenly. And there's others that
[1:21:56] are going to come from a high position
[1:21:58] all the way down to a place of shame.
[1:22:01] Amen. It's going to turn the tables on
[1:22:03] everything. Amen. When this baby, Amen.
[1:22:06] When this baby, Amen, comes and
[1:22:09] manifests itself. Now, think of Simeon.
[1:22:11] Now, he's holding a baby, the Christ
[1:22:13] child. And you want to talk about
[1:22:15] cradling potential.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Cradling potential. Now he's holding a
[1:22:20] little baby there. Didn't look like
[1:22:21] much. All the priests are going around.
[1:22:23] Amen. The high priest is doing his
[1:22:25] thing. He's too busy being important.
[1:22:27] But there's Simeon with a little baby.
[1:22:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Just a little baby.
[1:22:32] Now, that little baby he was holding had
[1:22:34] never healed a sick person. That little
[1:22:36] baby that he's holding, Amen. had never
[1:22:38] discerned a heart. That little baby had
[1:22:41] never hung on a cross. That baby had
[1:22:43] never performed a miracle. That little
[1:22:45] baby had never preached a sermon. But
[1:22:47] just as sure as Simeon's holding that
[1:22:50] baby, he's cradling potential. He's
[1:22:52] cradling the very life. Amen. That would
[1:22:54] bring his old Amen. Simeon would die
[1:22:56] someday. But he's cradling the very
[1:22:59] thing that would bring his body out of
[1:23:00] the ground. Amen. Potential friends.
[1:23:03] That's what you got in your hands
[1:23:04] tonight. That's what this message is.
[1:23:07] It's not a bunch of doctrine. Amen.
[1:23:09] You're cradling a Christ child. You say,
[1:23:11] "Brother Nathan, I've never seen a
[1:23:12] miracle." Then keep holding on to this
[1:23:14] message. I've never seen the
[1:23:16] supernatural. I've never had the baptism
[1:23:18] of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Get a hold of
[1:23:20] this word. And you begin to rock it.
[1:23:22] Amen. Oh, it'll surprise you one day.
[1:23:26] Hallelujah, friends. Amen. That's where
[1:23:28] I want to be standing. I want to know
[1:23:30] that I got this message not just on my
[1:23:31] hands. I want to have it in my heart. I
[1:23:34] want to cradle it in my arms. I know a
[1:23:36] bunch of preachers are out here and
[1:23:38] they're still arguing about what kind of
[1:23:39] buttons to have and how we should dress
[1:23:42] and a whole bunch of legalism. Amen. But
[1:23:44] I want to get a hold of God. I want to
[1:23:47] get a hold of Christ.
[1:23:51] I want to touch him. I want to know him.
[1:23:54] I want to feel his arms around me. I
[1:23:57] want to know the love of God. And that's
[1:24:00] what the message was sent for.
[1:24:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not going to
[1:24:05] get too important. Amen. You know, I we
[1:24:09] got a ministry. We got a position in the
[1:24:11] church. All those things are wonderful.
[1:24:13] Amen. But look, we're not going to take
[1:24:15] that. Amen. And then leave Christ over
[1:24:17] here. Amen. I'd rather hold on to
[1:24:19] Christ. Amen. And strip everything else
[1:24:21] away from me. Amen. I'd rather lose my
[1:24:23] home. I'd rather lose my family. I'd
[1:24:26] rather lose my church. Amen. And not
[1:24:28] lose my soul. Amen. I want to get I want
[1:24:30] to know Christ and him crucified.
[1:24:34] Hallelujah. There's something in you,
[1:24:37] friends. Amen. That's crying out for
[1:24:39] that. It's in your lap. It's in your
[1:24:42] lap. Think of what this message is. It's
[1:24:45] not Amen. It's not a bunch of rules and
[1:24:46] regulations. It's Christ. Christ
[1:24:49] revealing himself to the church. And
[1:24:50] he's come and he's set it right in your
[1:24:52] lap. What are you going to do with it?
[1:24:55] Oh, we know how Brother Brham would
[1:24:57] preach that challenging message. What
[1:24:59] shall we do with this man called Jesus?
[1:25:02] What shall we do with Jesus the Christ?
[1:25:04] Amen. He would preach and he would be he
[1:25:06] would paint a a dire picture. He said,
[1:25:08] "Now look, he's either going to be on
[1:25:10] your hands or he's going to be in your
[1:25:11] heart." Amen. You can't now you you come
[1:25:15] too far now. Amen. You know God is real.
[1:25:18] You know there's a reality. You know
[1:25:20] there's a real baptism of the Holy
[1:25:21] Ghost. You know there's real
[1:25:22] Christianity. Amen. Oh. Amen. Well then,
[1:25:26] friends, are you going to just lay it
[1:25:28] there in your lap or are you going to
[1:25:30] gather up this message and pull it into
[1:25:32] your heart? Amen. Young man, young
[1:25:34] woman, are you going to let this message
[1:25:36] just be the church that you belong to?
[1:25:38] Is it just going to be the way you were
[1:25:39] raised? Is it the lifestyle of your
[1:25:42] home? Amen. Or is it something in your
[1:25:44] heart? Amen. Is it an experience? Amen.
[1:25:47] That you know you got a hold of God. And
[1:25:48] much more importantly, you know God has
[1:25:51] got a hold of you.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz the message, Amen, is his arm
[1:25:55] reached down. Amen. To take a hold of
[1:25:57] his elect in his day. Now listen
[1:26:00] friends. when he began to preach that
[1:26:01] message, that message wasn't just about
[1:26:03] accountability. It was also about
[1:26:05] identification. Amen. Cuz there's a lot
[1:26:07] of people that would be like Pilate,
[1:26:09] they'll try to wash their hands of this
[1:26:11] word. Amen. They don't want to preach it
[1:26:13] cuz it's not popular. They don't want to
[1:26:14] they don't want to talk about it cuz it
[1:26:16] Amen. It'll interfere with the way they
[1:26:18] want to live their life. But there is a
[1:26:20] class of people. Amen. There is a group
[1:26:22] of people say, "God, though you slay me,
[1:26:24] I want to get a hold of this word."
[1:26:26] Amen. God, even if it hurts, even if I
[1:26:28] got to, even if it changes me, even if
[1:26:31] it changes the way I dress, changes the
[1:26:33] thing I do. Amen. I want to get a hold
[1:26:35] of you, God. Amen. And when you and that
[1:26:38] desire in you now is identifying that
[1:26:41] you're the one it was sent for.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Now, if you could just go now, wherever
[1:26:46] your if your mind is in your failures,
[1:26:48] if your mind is in your mistakes, I want
[1:26:50] you to go down a level deeper than that,
[1:26:52] down to the desire of your heart. And
[1:26:54] that desire down in there that says,
[1:26:55] "God, there's something in me crying out
[1:26:58] for you." Amen. I wanna I want to know
[1:27:00] you. I want to be a real Christian. I
[1:27:03] wanna I want to have a real experience
[1:27:04] with you. I want that real reality.
[1:27:08] Amen. That identifies you as one of his
[1:27:10] sheep. Amen. Because see, he said, "My
[1:27:13] sheep know my voice and they come, they
[1:27:15] follow me." Hallelujah. Brother Bam
[1:27:19] said, "The anointed word of God, when
[1:27:20] it's vindicated before any man that's
[1:27:23] born to be a son of God with the
[1:27:24] predestinated germ in him for this hour,
[1:27:26] he will see God's message as sure as
[1:27:29] there's a God in heaven."
[1:27:32] He will see God's message as sure as
[1:27:35] there a God in heaven. Martin Luther saw
[1:27:37] it for his. Wesley saw it for his. The
[1:27:40] Pentecostals saw it for his. He said,
[1:27:42] "Now, what about you?" And then he
[1:27:44] quotes this scripture. My sheep know my
[1:27:46] voice and a stranger they'll not follow.
[1:27:50] Oh friends. Amen. That that cry in your
[1:27:53] heart. Amen. Oh, you say, "Brother
[1:27:56] Nathan, am I ever going to understand
[1:27:58] all these mysteries?" Amen. The
[1:28:00] preachers are talking about the seventh
[1:28:01] seal and the third pole and all these
[1:28:03] things and I I find it very intimidating
[1:28:06] because I'm a very simple kind of person
[1:28:08] and I'm not very educated and I just got
[1:28:10] a very humble mind. Amen. You say, "Do
[1:28:15] I really have a chance, Brother Nathan?"
[1:28:17] Amen. Is the message really for me?
[1:28:18] Could I ever really get a hold of it? My
[1:28:20] sheep know my voice. My sheep know my
[1:28:23] voice. Don't you worry. That
[1:28:24] predestinated seed on the inside of you
[1:28:26] that qualifies you more than any doctor
[1:28:29] of divinity, more than any theologian,
[1:28:32] more than the most intellectual men of
[1:28:34] this world. Amen. You'll see this
[1:28:36] message. Don't be afraid of it. Amen.
[1:28:38] Don't think it's a bunch of mysteries
[1:28:40] that are held back from you. A mystery
[1:28:42] is a truth that used to be hidden, but
[1:28:44] now it's not. Amen. Because the hand of
[1:28:46] God reached down and broke the seals off
[1:28:49] of the word.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; It's your message. It belongs to you.
[1:28:53] Just begin to gather it up in your arms
[1:28:55] and pull it up close to your chest. You
[1:28:57] begin to feed on the message of the
[1:28:59] hour. Don't be afraid of it. Don't think
[1:29:00] it's too deep. You'll see the message.
[1:29:03] You'll get the picture.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz it's for you.
[1:29:08] Hallelujah.
[1:29:10] Amen.
[1:29:11] Oh, you you know
[1:29:14] because you're a son. Because you're a
[1:29:16] daughter of God. It's like that prodigal
[1:29:18] son. You know, for a while he thought
[1:29:20] for a while he was out in the world and
[1:29:22] then but then he he he he wanted to get
[1:29:24] his life right. He said, "Well, you
[1:29:26] know, I I need to I need to get my life
[1:29:28] right. I need to turn over New Leaf. I'm
[1:29:30] going to go back to I'm going to go back
[1:29:31] to Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle
[1:29:33] this Sunday. I'm going to come in the
[1:29:35] church and and I I I've been I haven't I
[1:29:38] just my life hasn't been right, but I'm
[1:29:40] going to I'm going to take a step. I'm
[1:29:41] going to go back. I'm going to see if
[1:29:42] God will let me serve him. That's what
[1:29:44] the prodigal thought. He thought, well,
[1:29:46] I'll go back to church. I'll just do my
[1:29:48] best. You know, I don't know if I'll
[1:29:50] ever if I'll really get anything, but I
[1:29:51] I just I feel I got to I got to make a
[1:29:53] step. I got to I'm just going to go I'm
[1:29:55] going to be a servant. I'm going to come
[1:29:57] I'm going to sit in the back row. I'm
[1:29:59] going to leave right after the, you
[1:30:00] know, I'm going to read read leave right
[1:30:02] after the prayer and I'm just going to
[1:30:04] slip in. I'm going to, you know, I need
[1:30:05] a little religion in my life. I need a
[1:30:07] little bit of God, but I I I probably I
[1:30:10] I probably can't go all the way cuz I've
[1:30:12] tried it before and it didn't work out.
[1:30:13] Amen. And so, you come down to church
[1:30:15] and Amen. You thought you thought,
[1:30:17] "Well, I'll just be a servant." But you
[1:30:19] never were a servant. The prodigal never
[1:30:21] was a servant. He said, "I'll go back to
[1:30:23] my father's house. I'll see if he'll
[1:30:25] just let me work for him. I'll see if
[1:30:27] he'll let me live there. He don't have
[1:30:28] to treat me like a son. I'll just be a
[1:30:30] servant. Amen. But he wasn't a servant.
[1:30:33] He was a son. And being backslid didn't
[1:30:35] keep him from being a son. Amen.
[1:30:37] Weakness didn't make him a not a son.
[1:30:40] Amen. Struggles didn't make him not a
[1:30:41] son. Amen. No friends, he was a son. And
[1:30:45] so when he came back to the father's
[1:30:46] house, Amen. There was a loving father,
[1:30:49] amen, who didn't wait for him, amen, to
[1:30:52] climb up the hill to where he was. He
[1:30:54] came running down the road with his arms
[1:30:56] outstretched. Amen. That's what he did
[1:30:59] for you friends. You said, "I'll be a
[1:31:01] servant." He said, "No, you're my son."
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You thought, "Oh, I don't."
[1:31:07] You had an idea about what this message
[1:31:08] was, but it treated you better than you
[1:31:10] thought you deserved. Why? Because you
[1:31:13] were elected to believe it
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; cuz you're a son or a daughter of God.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. You're one of his thoughts.
[1:31:22] Brother Ram said, 'If God was thinking
[1:31:24] about you in the beginning, he's still
[1:31:26] thinking about you now. He'll still be
[1:31:28] thinking about you tomorrow because God
[1:31:29] don't think thoughts today and forget
[1:31:31] them tomorrow. God's thoughts are
[1:31:33] eternal. Brother Brandham said, "God is
[1:31:35] omnisient. He's never had a new thought
[1:31:38] about anything." Because all his
[1:31:40] thoughts he always had and he always
[1:31:42] will have. And he knows the end from the
[1:31:45] beginning because he's God. He said,
[1:31:47] "Thus the thoughts of God are real and
[1:31:51] they are eternal."
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; That's you. Amen. Say, "What am I,
[1:31:56] brother Nathan? You're eternal and you
[1:31:59] are real." Look now, Brother Brand would
[1:32:01] say, "They're not just like a man with a
[1:32:02] blueprint." Amen. That he's drawn up and
[1:32:05] one day it'll be translated into
[1:32:06] substance and form. He said, "The
[1:32:09] thoughts of God are already real.
[1:32:11] They're already eternal and they're part
[1:32:13] of God." Oh, I know. You know, you know
[1:32:16] when you're building a house, you draw
[1:32:18] up a bunch of blueprints and you got it
[1:32:20] all drawn out just exactly how you hope
[1:32:22] it'll be and every detail is just right.
[1:32:24] Then what happens when you move in?
[1:32:26] Well, you know, they were sold out of
[1:32:28] the cabinets you wanted and you couldn't
[1:32:29] get quite the right shade of paint. And
[1:32:32] you know, they had to they had to kind
[1:32:33] of move the trim around to amen to make
[1:32:35] the plumber happy and the plumber had to
[1:32:37] move the pipes to make the electrician
[1:32:38] happy and and you end up with something
[1:32:40] that's pretty close to what you drew up,
[1:32:41] but it's not just exactly right. That's
[1:32:44] not how God fore orained his children.
[1:32:46] Amen. He didn't have an idea of you, you
[1:32:49] know, in his mind that was a perfect
[1:32:50] form of you. And then when you came in
[1:32:52] the world, Amen. And you came into
[1:32:54] substance, God looked at you and he
[1:32:55] thought, "Close enough." No, friends.
[1:32:59] Amen. The message will tell you, Amen.
[1:33:01] that he picked out the color eyes you
[1:33:03] would have. He chose the color of hair
[1:33:05] you would have. Amen. He knew exactly
[1:33:07] how tall you would be. He knew what
[1:33:09] you'd be good at. He knew what you'd be
[1:33:11] not good at. He knew the struggles you
[1:33:13] would face. You were designed on
[1:33:15] purpose. Amen. By a God. Amen. But I'll
[1:33:18] tell you what. Amen. There. Amen. As
[1:33:20] much as it pleased him to think of you,
[1:33:23] what really pleases God, Amen. was to
[1:33:25] bring you forth as a spoken word, child.
[1:33:28] Amen. So he could come running down that
[1:33:30] dusty road and get his arms around you
[1:33:33] and have a real relationship with the
[1:33:36] thought that once was a mystery in his
[1:33:38] mind, but now it's a living, breathing
[1:33:40] person that can touch God and be touched
[1:33:44] back. Oh, how precious are thy thoughts
[1:33:48] unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of
[1:33:50] them. Amen. David said, "If I should
[1:33:52] count them, they're more in number than
[1:33:54] the sand." You can't Amen. You can't in
[1:33:56] your mind. Amen. conceive. Amen. Of how
[1:34:00] perfect God's thoughts are of you.
[1:34:05] Amen. That can I take you to Sunday
[1:34:07] school for a minute? I'm I'm I'm just a
[1:34:10] little different kind of a guy, so just
[1:34:11] indulge me tonight. I'd like you to
[1:34:14] close your eyes if you have to. But you
[1:34:16] have a special ability in your mind as a
[1:34:18] human being. It separates you from all
[1:34:20] the animals. Amen.
[1:34:23] I want you to in your mind, in your
[1:34:25] mind's eye, and close your eyes if you
[1:34:26] got to, I want you to picture an apple.
[1:34:29] Make it a red apple, but it's got one,
[1:34:32] it's got a little stem sticking out the
[1:34:34] top. It's got one leaf on it. Can you
[1:34:35] see it? Now, you can you that's an
[1:34:38] amazing ability you have as a human to
[1:34:40] contain that apple in your mind. And you
[1:34:42] can turn it around. You could even you
[1:34:44] could even do two apples. Maybe uh maybe
[1:34:48] one's red and the other one's green and
[1:34:50] the green one's got two leaves instead
[1:34:51] of one. See, you're already losing it,
[1:34:53] aren't you?
[1:34:55] You're Some of you maybe got a sharp
[1:34:57] mind. You could keep up with me there.
[1:34:58] Now, here's what I want you to do
[1:35:00] tonight. I want you to picture in your
[1:35:02] mind exactly
[1:35:05] 172 apples.
[1:35:08] Anybody got it? No, you can't. Because
[1:35:11] our minds have limitations and we can
[1:35:14] imagine so much. We can visualize so
[1:35:16] much. But then, you know, it just gets
[1:35:17] outside of our grasp as a human. That's
[1:35:19] why we invented numbers. We got 172 and
[1:35:21] it represents something we cannot number
[1:35:24] in our minds. But listen friends, that's
[1:35:26] not God's thoughts toward you. That's
[1:35:28] not his mind toward you, friends. Amen.
[1:35:31] No, he he we are serving a God. He
[1:35:34] counts every grain of sand in the world.
[1:35:37] He knows every star that's in the sky.
[1:35:39] He knows every hair that's on your head.
[1:35:42] Amen. I'm talking about a God that
[1:35:44] numbers you and he's able to contain you
[1:35:46] in his mind. You're not a You're not a
[1:35:48] vague idea of a person to him. He's got
[1:35:50] you. He's got a hold of you. You're in
[1:35:53] his mind. Amen. How many sleepless
[1:35:56] nights? Amen. We lay awake and we cry
[1:35:58] and we feel like God's not listening and
[1:36:00] the heavens are shut and you weep and
[1:36:02] tears run down your eyes and you thank
[1:36:04] God you're not even aware of me. But the
[1:36:07] Bible says God has a bottle and he took
[1:36:09] that bottle and he catches every tear
[1:36:11] you ever cried. One day it'll all be
[1:36:14] poured out. Amen. God's got a purpose in
[1:36:16] your life. Listen, friends, you're not
[1:36:18] just on his list. You're in his mind. He
[1:36:22] numbers you. He knows you. Amen. And
[1:36:25] he's got his arms around you. And you're
[1:36:27] so precious to him, he can't lose one of
[1:36:30] those thoughts. If he lost one of those
[1:36:32] thoughts, he would no longer be God.
[1:36:36] You want to talk about security,
[1:36:38] friends? I'll tell you something about
[1:36:39] security. Amen. Amen. Paul said, "One
[1:36:43] day we're going to know as we are
[1:36:44] known." I'm talking about a God that
[1:36:46] knows you. You know, now when I find out
[1:36:49] about a God that knows me like that,
[1:36:51] Amen. Something wells up in my heart,
[1:36:53] Brother Andrew, I want to know him back.
[1:36:55] I want to know a God like that. A God
[1:36:58] that would care about me. A God that
[1:36:59] would number me. A God that designed me
[1:37:01] on purpose. Well, I want to find out
[1:37:03] what that purpose is. I want to know
[1:37:05] what it means to be Nathan Ericson. The
[1:37:06] thought of God. I want to I know what I
[1:37:09] want to know what it is to do what
[1:37:10] Nathan Ericson, the thought of it of of
[1:37:12] God is supposed to do. I want to know
[1:37:14] him. Amen. Because he knows me and he's
[1:37:18] got me cradled up safe in his arms. He's
[1:37:20] not going to lose me. I'm one of his
[1:37:22] thoughts.
[1:37:24] Amen. That's what he said. He said, "My
[1:37:26] sheep are mine and I know them
[1:37:29] and no man shall pluck them out of my
[1:37:31] hand."
[1:37:33] Now, I thought about that. I was
[1:37:35] thinking one time, Brother William, I
[1:37:36] was I thought it was curious wording
[1:37:39] there in the King James how it says, "No
[1:37:41] man shall pluck them." And I thought,
[1:37:42] "Why wonder why that is?" And I oh my I
[1:37:45] started, you know how preachers do I
[1:37:47] start going down and I started I started
[1:37:49] just working on a little sermon there,
[1:37:51] you know, and I'm thinking about, oh,
[1:37:54] you know, uh it's about influences of
[1:37:56] men and you know, God uses men, so the
[1:37:59] devil uses men, too. And so, you know,
[1:38:01] that's where that greatest battle ever
[1:38:02] fought is. And it's different men's
[1:38:04] influences and things like that. And so,
[1:38:05] we got to watch and man, we got to stick
[1:38:07] with the word or somebody will turn us
[1:38:09] astray and all. Oh, I had a real idea in
[1:38:11] my mind of the nuance of that statement.
[1:38:13] And then I thought, I better go check
[1:38:15] that in the Greek or Aramaic or whatever
[1:38:18] it is. And uh and you know uh you know
[1:38:21] uh quoting the Greek or Aramaic that
[1:38:22] don't make you real fancy. You know,
[1:38:24] it's free on the internet. It's called
[1:38:27] Strong's concordance. So, you're you're
[1:38:29] not deep cuz you can look up the Greek.
[1:38:31] All right. But I I looked it up and I
[1:38:33] thought I thought well
[1:38:36] I thought I want to know really I want
[1:38:38] to make sure I really got the meaning of
[1:38:39] that. It don't say nothing about a man
[1:38:41] at all. It said the word is dunami
[1:38:45] which means power. Amen. In other words,
[1:38:48] there is no power that is able to pluck
[1:38:52] you out of his hands. It don't matter if
[1:38:55] it's a man. It don't matter if it's a
[1:38:57] devil. It don't matter if it's a
[1:38:58] sickness. It don't matter if it's a
[1:39:00] temptation. It doesn't matter what it
[1:39:02] is, friends. There's no power, no
[1:39:04] dunami. There's nothing that ever was.
[1:39:06] There's nothing that is. There's nothing
[1:39:07] that ever will be that is capable.
[1:39:11] Amen. Of taking one of God's thoughts
[1:39:13] and ripping it out of his hands. No.
[1:39:16] When he got a hold of you, he got a hold
[1:39:17] of you for good.
[1:39:21] No power. There's nothing that exists.
[1:39:24] You say, "But brother Nathan, it's not
[1:39:25] other powers I'm worried about. I want
[1:39:27] to know if I have the power. I'm worried
[1:39:29] whether I have the power. I know God's
[1:39:31] got a hold of me, but I'm afraid I'm
[1:39:33] going to let go of him. And I'm afraid
[1:39:35] I'm going to go too far in my mistakes
[1:39:37] and failures. Amen. And I'm going to
[1:39:39] slip out of his grasp. So, I'm not
[1:39:41] worried about other power. I'm worried
[1:39:42] about my power." Brother Nathan, well,
[1:39:44] yeah, you got power. You got a very You
[1:39:46] got a power of something called uh free
[1:39:49] moral agency. You got the power to make
[1:39:52] decisions and they're your decisions.
[1:39:54] You got the power, amen, to make the
[1:39:56] wrong decision and then you got to bear
[1:39:58] the consequences of that decision. Amen.
[1:40:00] And when with your decision, you have
[1:40:02] the power to get off into something
[1:40:04] called the permissive will of God. Amen.
[1:40:07] That's quite an amazing power that God
[1:40:09] gave you. But there's something else
[1:40:10] Brother Brandham said. He said, "But the
[1:40:12] permissive will of God must always come
[1:40:15] back to glorify the perfect will of
[1:40:18] God." What are you telling me, brother
[1:40:20] Nathan? I'm telling you, Amen. God is a
[1:40:23] sovereign God, and he's sovereign in his
[1:40:25] grace. You lack the power in all of your
[1:40:29] weakness to wrigle out of the grasp of a
[1:40:32] gracious God. Amen. He reached down to
[1:40:34] take a hold of you, and he's not letting
[1:40:37] anything take you out.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know we make mistakes. I
[1:40:42] know we bear consequences. I know
[1:40:44] sometimes we need correction. Amen. We
[1:40:46] need restoration. Amen. But God never
[1:40:48] lost you for a moment. He won't lose one
[1:40:51] of his thoughts. I'm talking about
[1:40:53] security, friends. Hey, brother Nathan,
[1:40:55] you can't be preaching all the election
[1:40:56] like that. You'll cause loose living.
[1:40:58] Not to the bride of Christ.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; No, sir. That's who she is. Amen. She's
[1:41:03] those true sheep. She knows his voice.
[1:41:05] She knows what's right. And there's
[1:41:07] something heart she wants to do right.
[1:41:09] But sometimes she does wrong. But when
[1:41:11] the bride does wrong, it doesn't make
[1:41:14] her less bride. When a son or daughter
[1:41:16] of God falls, they get back up again and
[1:41:19] they stay in the path of duty
[1:41:21] and it all ends up in God's perfect will
[1:41:24] in the end.
[1:41:26] Cuz God's arms are strong. He's got
[1:41:29] strong arms tonight. I tell you what
[1:41:32] Jesus said, I got a hold of them and
[1:41:33] they will never perish. They will never
[1:41:36] perish. What are we afraid of tonight?
[1:41:38] What are you afraid of? Death can't
[1:41:40] touch you. The first death, it can't
[1:41:42] harm you. All it can do is change your
[1:41:44] dwelling place. Death is a doorway into
[1:41:46] the presence of God. Amen. But there's a
[1:41:48] second death. Amen. Which is
[1:41:50] annihilation. And that don't have
[1:41:52] nothing to do with you. That's for the
[1:41:53] devil and his angels. Amen. So when the
[1:41:56] devil comes to talk to you about
[1:41:57] failures and talk to you about your
[1:41:59] past. I know it's cliche, but don't
[1:42:01] forget to remind him of his future. Cuz
[1:42:04] the devil's got an end, but a thought of
[1:42:06] God. A son or daughter of God is as
[1:42:09] eternal as God is eternal.
[1:42:12] You're not saved today to be lost
[1:42:13] tomorrow.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You're elected, predestinated.
[1:42:18] Amen. If Satan could, he already would.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; He already would. You trust the hand of
[1:42:25] the Lord. Isaiah said, "Behold, the
[1:42:27] Lord's hand is not shorten that it
[1:42:29] cannot saved." Amen. The same hands that
[1:42:32] delivered you at birth, they also
[1:42:34] deliver you from all your troubles. When
[1:42:36] Moses made that personal contact with
[1:42:38] God at the burning bush, you know, when
[1:42:40] he left that burning bush, he didn't get
[1:42:41] down the street and have and get into
[1:42:43] trouble and have to run back to the
[1:42:45] bush. No. Cuz when Moses left the bush,
[1:42:48] the fire left the bush. Amen. And and
[1:42:52] somebody who's really Amen. Somebody
[1:42:54] who's really made a personal contact
[1:42:55] with God. Amen. When you make a mistake
[1:42:57] or a failure, you don't got to run back
[1:42:59] to youth camp to get another experience.
[1:43:01] No, friends. Because God left that youth
[1:43:03] camp and he left and he's with you. He
[1:43:06] said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never
[1:43:07] forsake you. When you struggle, I will
[1:43:10] strengthen you. When you fail, I will
[1:43:12] forgive you. Amen. When you when you're
[1:43:14] sick, I will heal you. When you're
[1:43:16] bound, I will deliver you." Amen. I am
[1:43:18] with you and you're in my arms and
[1:43:22] you're safe. Oh, gentle hands, friends.
[1:43:26] See, see, it's the same gentle hands.
[1:43:29] There was a strong hand that went before
[1:43:31] Joshua. And God said, "I'll reach down
[1:43:33] my hand before you. And as you go into
[1:43:35] the land, I'll push everybody back. I'll
[1:43:36] push your opponents back before you.
[1:43:38] I'll take my strong hand. I'll sweep the
[1:43:40] enemy out of your path." But those same
[1:43:43] strong hands that are so rough on your
[1:43:45] enemy, they're so gentle with you. Oh,
[1:43:48] how many know the hands of a gentle
[1:43:49] savior tonight? Amen. He's so gentle
[1:43:52] with his children. I Amen. Now, now you
[1:43:54] know it's just like at home, you know,
[1:43:57] uh we got a we mama's got a wooden spoon
[1:44:00] at home. It's not for stirring the
[1:44:02] cookie batter. Amen. You see, but there
[1:44:05] there's a spoon and it's got a purpose
[1:44:07] and it it gets used, but not the hands.
[1:44:11] Amen. Because that's the way it is with
[1:44:12] God. God's got a rod of correction, but
[1:44:15] the hands are for comfort. Amen. And we
[1:44:18] go through we we we disbelieve. We we we
[1:44:21] struggle. We we go through all kinds of
[1:44:22] things. Thomas did, too. Remember
[1:44:24] Thomas? He got in unbelief and he got
[1:44:27] the rod, but then he got the hands. Oh,
[1:44:31] and I'm talking about the hands of a
[1:44:32] gracious God. Brother Brand told that
[1:44:35] story. It might as well happen in my
[1:44:36] house. It'd be something just like my
[1:44:37] girls would do. He came back from a
[1:44:39] trip. Uh, little Rebecca climbed up in
[1:44:42] his lap. Little Sarah comes along.
[1:44:45] Rebecca says, "Sorry Sarah, you can't
[1:44:48] have daddy because I've got all a daddy.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; I got all a daddy." Yeah. Some of you
[1:44:54] come out of churches where you say,
[1:44:55] "Well, you can't have no revelation. I
[1:44:57] got all the revelation. You'll never
[1:44:59] understand this message. You'll never
[1:45:01] No, no. I got it all. Maybe if you sit
[1:45:03] under me for 40, 50 years, you might be
[1:45:05] able to understand it."
[1:45:08] Sarah had a better revelation than that.
[1:45:10] She jumped up and she said, "Well," she
[1:45:12] said, "You might have all of daddy, but
[1:45:15] daddy's got all of me." Friends, amen.
[1:45:18] It ain't about how much I know. It ain't
[1:45:21] about how much I can quote. It ain't
[1:45:22] about what a great person that I am. I
[1:45:24] just want to know, Amen, that that
[1:45:26] daddy's got a hold of me tonight. And I
[1:45:29] have and through this message, I have
[1:45:31] come back into personal contact with my
[1:45:33] father. Hallelujah. You see, God has got
[1:45:37] you tonight. God has got you. I don't
[1:45:39] know what you're going through. You
[1:45:40] know, Christians, I find out Christians
[1:45:42] don't mind going through a trial. They
[1:45:43] just want to know, is God considering
[1:45:45] me? Is he considering me in my trial?
[1:45:48] Does he know where I'm at? Does he know
[1:45:49] what I'm You know, Brother Bram said,
[1:45:51] "The predestinated are the only ones
[1:45:53] considered in redemption." You say, "Is
[1:45:56] God thinking about me?" You're the only
[1:45:58] one he's thinking about.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; This world exists. The universe exists.
[1:46:04] Kingdoms rise and fall. Presidents come
[1:46:07] and go, leaders of men, empires crumble
[1:46:11] and rise and crumble and rise around
[1:46:13] you. And it all serves one purpose, to
[1:46:16] bring the bride of Christ back into his
[1:46:18] arms. Amen. He he he he he he set the
[1:46:22] sun in the sky to be your light. He said
[1:46:24] it all speaks of his bride. That's Oh, I
[1:46:27] don't have time to preach it all
[1:46:28] tonight, but let me tell you what the
[1:46:30] message is trying to get across to you.
[1:46:32] Amen. Is that God has been thinking
[1:46:34] about you for a very long time. Amen.
[1:46:37] And he wrote a whole story in the Bible.
[1:46:39] Amen. I know it talks about Moses. I
[1:46:41] know it talks about Elijah. It's really
[1:46:43] about you. Amen. And your connection
[1:46:45] with God. And now we have come, amen, to
[1:46:48] the climax of the story. It's a great
[1:46:51] romantic part where the bridegroom
[1:46:54] finally comes and he takes the bride in
[1:46:56] his arms. He say, "Now you see what it
[1:46:58] was all about.
[1:47:00] What it was all about.
[1:47:03] God wrote a book about you.
[1:47:06] God wrote a book about you. You think
[1:47:08] he's going to leave you now?
[1:47:11] When I was a kid, we used to listen to
[1:47:13] that old uh radio show, The Lone Ranger.
[1:47:16] I'm not that old. We just ate a Cracker
[1:47:18] Barrel a lot.
[1:47:21] You know that Lone Ranger guy, Brother
[1:47:23] Gabe, he's always getting in trouble.
[1:47:25] Every episode, he's getting another fix.
[1:47:27] And you think, I wonder if he's going to
[1:47:28] make it out of this one. I And as a
[1:47:30] little kid, I remember I think it was my
[1:47:31] dad said one time, I said, "Man, I I
[1:47:34] don't know if he's going to get out of
[1:47:34] this." He said, "What does it say on the
[1:47:36] cover of the album?" Oh, it says The
[1:47:38] Lone Ranger. So, he's the main
[1:47:41] character.
[1:47:44] So, if he gets in trouble, I'm preaching
[1:47:46] now. If he gets in trouble in chapter
[1:47:49] three, I have a feeling he'll still be
[1:47:51] around chapter six,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; friends. And we've already read the back
[1:47:55] of this book. And God's not going to
[1:47:57] lose a one of his own. So, no matter
[1:47:59] where you're at, no matter what you're
[1:48:00] going through, Amen. Whatever would
[1:48:03] strike your body, your spirit, or your
[1:48:04] soul, I'm talking about a God who's got
[1:48:07] his arms around you. You just hold on to
[1:48:10] him. He'll get you through. Let's all
[1:48:11] stand tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:48:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:17] Amen. Brother Bam said when Jesus went
[1:48:20] down the river,
[1:48:22] he said that was the greatest event the
[1:48:24] world had ever seen and will see until.
[1:48:29] It was the greatest event until
[1:48:32] Christ and the church have united
[1:48:35] together again.
[1:48:37] Friends, there's never been a day like
[1:48:39] this day.
[1:48:41] If you don't know God like I'm talking
[1:48:42] about, God is not a bridegroom who has
[1:48:44] wrapped his arms around your life.
[1:48:48] Let me tell you, there's a message who
[1:48:49] can introduce you to your Isaac.
[1:48:53] Amen. And if he can never get you in his
[1:48:56] arms, he'll never let you go.
[1:48:59] That's what he's looking for tonight as
[1:49:00] we bow our heads.
[1:49:03] He said, "As until Christ and the church
[1:49:05] is united again, when God and Christ,
[1:49:08] God and man become one, heaven and earth
[1:49:11] embraced each other, kissed each other,
[1:49:14] settled the sin question forever."
[1:49:17] when the dove and the lamb united
[1:49:19] together.
[1:49:24] Friends, God's looking for a people
[1:49:26] today.
[1:49:30] Not a great people, not a
[1:49:33] not a special class of people, just
[1:49:36] somebody who can get in his hands.
[1:49:39] I I just wonder
[1:49:41] there'd be a heart here tonight say,
[1:49:43] "Lord,
[1:49:45] take me in your arms and use me, Lord.
[1:49:51] I don't want this message just to be a
[1:49:53] theory, just to be a
[1:49:56] a tradition, Lord. I I want to know you
[1:49:59] in your embrace.
[1:50:01] I want to know the love of Christ. I
[1:50:03] want reality."
[1:50:05] How many got a need in your life
[1:50:06] tonight? Some of your hearts say, "Lord,
[1:50:10] I'm so needy, Lord, but if I could just
[1:50:12] touch you tonight, but if you could just
[1:50:15] see
[1:50:20] that we're talking about a God who wants
[1:50:22] to be touched,
[1:50:24] a God who's reaching his arm out back to
[1:50:26] you." Somebody get a hold of him tonight
[1:50:29] by faith. Say, "God, I I take hold of
[1:50:31] you tonight for my healing. I I take my
[1:50:33] deliverance. I take my family. I take my
[1:50:35] need. I take my provision, Lord. I take
[1:50:37] it in my arms. And I and I embrace the
[1:50:40] promise, Lord. I Lord, I want to touch
[1:50:42] you. Not just the hem of your garment,
[1:50:44] Lord, but may you take me in your arms
[1:50:46] tonight, heavenly father. Let it be so.
[1:50:49] I pray the Holy Spirit now, Lord, would
[1:50:51] come. The word has been preached,
[1:50:52] Father. But Lord, now let the let that
[1:50:55] pillar of fire come and move through
[1:50:57] these place, Lord. Touch lives, Lord.
[1:51:00] Touch hearts. I pray you'd move on our
[1:51:02] needs, Lord. There's great sicknesses
[1:51:04] among us, Father. But you're a healer,
[1:51:06] Lord. We know you to be a healer. I pray
[1:51:08] you'd reach down your mighty hand,
[1:51:10] Father. Touch every heart. May you meet
[1:51:12] every need, Lord. Oh, God. We thank you
[1:51:15] for your grace, Lord. We never could
[1:51:17] have climbed up to where you were, but
[1:51:19] Lord, you came running down to us,
[1:51:22] Father, and took us in your arms,
[1:51:24] Father. The prodigal returned. Lord, we
[1:51:27] want to be your sons and your daughters.
[1:51:30] We want to, Lord, we want to know your
[1:51:32] love. We want to, Lord, your arms are so
[1:51:35] securely wrapped around us, Lord. We
[1:51:36] just want to hold you back, Father. I
[1:51:39] pray, Lord, you take these people here,
[1:51:41] Lord. This church, this ministry, Lord.
[1:51:44] Lord, the the pastors, the ministers,
[1:51:47] Lord, the people, Father, take them in
[1:51:50] your hands. Do something with them, Lord
[1:51:53] Jesus. That's what you're looking for,
[1:51:55] Lord. That's why you sent a message,
[1:51:58] Lord. not to stay a million miles away,
[1:52:00] but to come real close by, Lord. We just
[1:52:03] welcome your presence, Lord, and we
[1:52:04] throw everything that we are into your
[1:52:05] arms. We love you, Jesus. I commit this
[1:52:09] service to you, Lord. And Lord, the
[1:52:11] things that were spoken, I pray, Lord,
[1:52:12] it would just strike the heart right and
[1:52:14] accomplish, Lord, what you wanted it to
[1:52:16] do. We pray in Jesus name now. Amen. God
[1:52:20] bless you tonight.

[1:52:34] [Music]
[1:52:35] every day. I see.
[1:52:41] He's helping me faithfully
[1:52:46] to overcome
[1:52:48] my trials.

[1:53:00] He's giving me victory.
[1:53:04] [Music]

[1:53:57] It's a reality
[1:54:01] cuz something keeps holding me.
[1:54:06] You enjoy the word of the Lord tonight.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] Aren't you thankful for the father's
[1:54:13] embrace?
[1:54:16] I heard the prophet say it today in the
[1:54:18] oncoming storm. He said, he said, "Paul
[1:54:20] was successful in having Stephen
[1:54:22] stoned." He said, he said, "The message,
[1:54:25] the messenger didn't affect him." He
[1:54:27] said, "But the message did." He said,
[1:54:29] "And the message got a hold of Paul."
[1:54:32] The message got a hold of Paul. You may
[1:54:34] have never been around William Brandon,
[1:54:36] but this message has got a hold of you.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; It's got a hold of your life, and he
[1:54:40] ain't letting go of you. And I'm so
[1:54:42] thankful to realize that we have a
[1:54:45] father that is so strong. Maybe key of B
[1:54:48] flat. I don't know if it's right or not.
[1:54:52] He's got the whole world in his hands.
[1:54:57] He's got the whole world in his hand.
[1:55:02] He's got the whole world in his hands.
[1:55:07] He's got the whole world in his hands.
[1:55:12] Oh, he's got the whole world
[1:55:16] in his hand. He's got the whole world
[1:55:21] in his hands. He's got the whole world
[1:55:26] in his hands. He's got the whole world
[1:55:29] in his He's got the whole
[1:55:34] [Music]
[1:55:36] in his hands. He's got the whole world
[1:55:41] in his hands. He's got the whole world
[1:55:46] in his hands. He's got the whole world
[1:55:49] in his hands.
[1:55:53] Hallelujah.
[1:55:55] Wounded and forsen.
[1:55:59] I was shattered by the fall.
[1:56:05] did ever forgotten.
[1:56:07] [Music]
[1:56:08] Feeling lost and all alone.
[1:56:13] Oh, summoned by the king
[1:56:17] [Applause]
[1:56:19] to the master's court.
[1:56:24] lifted by the Savior
[1:56:29] and cradled in his arms.

[1:56:57] I was carried to the table.
[1:57:02] [Music]
[1:57:06] Oh, swept away by his love.
[1:57:17] Oh, and I don't feel my brokenness
[1:57:23] anymore.
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:29] When I'm seated at the table
[1:57:34] of the Lord,
[1:57:37] I was carried to the table.
[1:57:43] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:57:46] Oh,
[1:57:48] the table of the Lord.
[1:57:54] Oh, fighting thoughts of fear
[1:58:00] and wondering why he called my name.
[1:58:06] Am I good enough?
[1:58:08] Want to share the scar this world has
[1:58:13] left me lame.
[1:58:17] But even in my weakness,
[1:58:22] the Savior called my name.
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:28] In his holy presence
[1:58:32] I'm feeling unshame.
[1:58:39] I was carried to the table.

[2:07:04] [Music]
[2:07:10] day he came.
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:14] Oh, and walked into my life.
[2:07:20] He pulled me from
[2:07:22] a life of sin.
[2:07:27] Oh, to be a part of his pride.
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:35] But now there's been
[2:07:38] a change in me.
[2:07:44] Now I used to see things one way
[2:07:48] but now so differently
[2:07:52] and God is one thing and it still
[2:07:57] remains the same
[2:08:00] and it will never change.
[2:08:04] No, it will never
[2:08:07] change.

[2:08:19] Oh, like a mighty mountain
[2:08:23] that will never fall.

[2:08:33] of God's own hand.

[2:08:47] Are you living
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:50] a life of sin
[2:08:55] [Music]
[2:08:57] and you can't see
[2:09:00] way out
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:06] and you can have that
[2:09:10] sweet peace within
[2:09:16] or You can sing and you can shout.
[2:09:25] You see, there was a day on Mount Calary
[2:09:35] when he embraced the cross
[2:09:40] so you can be set free.
[2:09:45] And God is one thing and it still
[2:09:50] remains the same
[2:09:53] and it will never change.
[2:09:57] No, we will never
[2:10:00] change.
[2:10:03] Oh love still say
[2:10:08] it stands strong and tall.
[2:10:13] Oh, like a mighty mountain
[2:10:17] that will never fall.
[2:10:23] Held by the strength
[2:10:27] of God's own.
[2:10:32] Love still s.
[2:10:36] [Music]
[2:10:38] Hallelujah.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you thankful?
[2:10:43] for a God that would embrace you
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; when you didn't think that you were
[2:10:50] worth embracing.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; There come a spot in my life and I was
[2:10:54] kind of like brother Nathan said
[2:10:56] tonight. I grew up in church and I I cut
[2:10:59] my teeth on this message. Cut my teeth
[2:11:00] on these church pews just like he said.
[2:11:04] But I got my focus off and I got to
[2:11:06] looking at people instead of looking at
[2:11:08] the message.
[2:11:10] And it
[2:11:13] I got disillusioned
[2:11:16] just because of people.
[2:11:18] And there's great people in this
[2:11:19] message, but I had my eyes on the wrong
[2:11:21] thing. And I thought, I don't want
[2:11:24] anything if that's what the message
[2:11:26] produces. I don't want anything to do
[2:11:28] with that. And I I come so close to
[2:11:30] walking away
[2:11:32] because of people, not the message.
[2:11:37] And I remember I remember going through
[2:11:39] those stages of my life and I was
[2:11:42] [Music]
[2:11:45] just thinking how great God is. And I I
[2:11:48] was just thinking about it and at that
[2:11:51] moment and I was going through all of
[2:11:52] them things
[2:11:54] and a man of God that was was anointed.
[2:11:56] I I was I I was hearing a church service
[2:11:58] and I had them things on my heart and I
[2:12:01] was thinking, how could I get through
[2:12:03] all of that and I'm still here?
[2:12:07] How how could how could those those
[2:12:09] people and how could this happen and how
[2:12:10] could that happen these trials and all
[2:12:12] those things and I just had that thought
[2:12:14] in my mind if it would not been for the
[2:12:16] grace of God I wouldn't have been here
[2:12:20] and I was just holding those things and
[2:12:21] all of a sudden the man of God he just
[2:12:23] he was completely out of out of cater he
[2:12:25] was going a completely different re
[2:12:27] direction he said he said brother he
[2:12:30] said don't you know that God had you in
[2:12:32] his hands the whole time he was
[2:12:35] completely preaching somewhere else. But
[2:12:36] I was I was thinking about those things.
[2:12:38] He said, "Brother, don't you know that
[2:12:39] God had you in his hands the whole
[2:12:41] time?" So, you couldn't left this
[2:12:44] message because God had you in his hands
[2:12:46] the whole time? Don't you realize that
[2:12:48] where you came from and where you are
[2:12:51] now that God's had you in his hands the
[2:12:53] whole time? The road might have been
[2:12:55] rough how you got here, but God had you
[2:12:57] in his hands the whole time. And what no
[2:13:00] man, what no idea, what no trouble, what
[2:13:03] no devil going to get you out of his
[2:13:05] hands. Aren't you thankful that the
[2:13:07] master
[2:13:09] has still got his hand on you?
[2:13:13] Hallelujah. I tell you, this message
[2:13:16] makes me want to shout from the
[2:13:17] rooftops.
[2:13:20] Through it all, I've learned to trust in
[2:13:23] Jesus.
[2:13:24] Ah, don't you just enjoy the message of
[2:13:26] the hour? God bless you, brother Nathan.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; That was that was beautiful. God richly
[2:13:32] bless you tonight. We're going to let
[2:13:33] you be dismissed tonight go praying for
[2:13:36] brother Ron in the morning that God will
[2:13:37] give him exactly what we have need of. I
[2:13:41] believe God has has done great things
[2:13:43] here tonight. Maybe we could just by a
[2:13:45] raise of hands just say, "God spoke to
[2:13:47] me."
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God God bless you. God
[2:13:52] richly bless you. You're dismissed
[2:13:54] tonight. Go in the name of the Lord
[2:13:56] Jesus Christ. Come expecting in the
[2:13:59] morning. God bless you.
