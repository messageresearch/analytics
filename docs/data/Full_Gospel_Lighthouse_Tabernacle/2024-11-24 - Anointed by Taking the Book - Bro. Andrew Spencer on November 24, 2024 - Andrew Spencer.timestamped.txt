[56:20] Lighthouse does so amen amen if you have
[56:24] your Bibles today we'd like to uh just
[56:28] just look over in the Book of Luke 4 and
[56:30] verse 17 also Revelations chap
[56:34] 10 I want to welcome all of our visitors
[56:37] here uh today we happy to have you in
[56:39] the house of the
[56:41] Lord man
[57:03] as a minister you you're constantly
[57:05] looking unto the Lord to just see the
[57:08] very mind of God and i' I've been
[57:10] studying an actual thought for about two
[57:13] two and a half months or something right
[57:15] at two months and I thought the Lord was
[57:17] going to give us Liberty to speak at
[57:18] this weekend and and uh just just on
[57:22] Friday evening he just uh turned my
[57:24] heart I was actually driving uh my
[57:27] daughter to uh basketball practice and
[57:29] Lord just just dropped this thought in
[57:30] my heart on anoint it by taking the book
[57:33] and I'd like to by the help of the Lord
[57:35] just just speak to you um on these
[57:37] thoughts there's so many ways that we
[57:39] could dive into this but just Gathering
[57:42] some inspiration we'd like to speak to
[57:44] you today on these scriptures here in
[57:46] Luke 4 and: 17 and the Bible said that
[57:50] and there was delivered unto him the
[57:53] book of The Prophet Isaias and when he
[57:55] had opened in the book he found the
[57:57] place where it was written the spirit of
[57:59] the Lord is upon me because Heath
[58:01] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[58:03] poor he has sent me to heal the broken
[58:06] hearted to preach Deliverance to the
[58:07] captives and recovering of sight to the
[58:10] blind to set at
[58:13] Liberty them are them that are bruised
[58:16] to preach the acceptable year of the
[58:19] Lord and he closed the book and gave it
[58:23] again to the minister and sat down and
[58:25] then the eyes of all of them that were
[58:28] in the synagogue were fastened on him
[58:30] and he began to say unto them this day
[58:33] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[58:37] Revelations chap 10 and verse
[58:48] one
[58:50] amen Revelations 10 and 1 and I saw
[58:55] another mighty Angel come down from
[58:58] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[59:00] rainbow was upon his feet on his head
[59:02] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[59:06] his feet as pillars of fire brother
[59:09] William just did a wonderful wonderful
[59:11] job tying those things in the scriptures
[59:13] together last
[59:14] night and he had in his hand a little
[59:18] book open and he set his right foot upon
[59:22] the sea and his left foot on the earth
[59:24] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[59:26] lion Roth and when he had cried seven
[59:30] Thunders uttered their voices amen let's
[59:33] just go to the Lord in prayer here this
[59:35] morning Heavenly Father we come before
[59:38] you father Lord we we feel so charged by
[59:42] the Holy Spirit to be setting here
[59:44] together Lord there's many places that
[59:47] that Believers are meeting there are
[59:48] some that are meeting in storefronts
[59:50] this morning there are many that are out
[59:52] underneath of a canopy of maybe maybe
[59:55] Palm leaves that that are gathering
[59:56] together there there are those that are
[59:58] underneath of sheet Meadow and they're
[1:00:00] Gathering and sitting on a post but Lord
[1:00:03] here we are at Full Gospel Lighthouse
[1:00:04] sitting in this wonderful Tabernacle
[1:00:06] that you've blessed us with Father
[1:00:08] sitting here with our friends and our
[1:00:10] family Lord Jesus but more importantly
[1:00:13] Lord we're not just sitting here with
[1:00:14] you we recognize that you are here and
[1:00:17] that you have come to speak to us oh God
[1:00:19] and we invite you Lord Jesus to to take
[1:00:22] this take this Pulpit just now and to
[1:00:24] take our hearts Lord and you would
[1:00:26] Minister unto us by by the reading of
[1:00:29] the word I pray that you would break the
[1:00:31] scriptures one more time father and that
[1:00:34] we would be careful to be able to see
[1:00:35] you Lord Jesus you you drew near to
[1:00:38] those that were walking to the road to
[1:00:40] EMAs and you you made yourself and
[1:00:43] disguised yourself in such a way that
[1:00:45] they wouldn't know you and I pray father
[1:00:47] that today Lord that while the breaking
[1:00:49] of the word is going forth may we not be
[1:00:53] may we not recognize may we not fail to
[1:00:56] recognize your presence Lord may we may
[1:00:58] we see it's just more than Humanity of
[1:01:01] the elements of the body that that is
[1:01:03] bringing and breaking forth but may we
[1:01:05] see Jesus high and lifted up father I
[1:01:08] know that there are many needs here Lord
[1:01:10] God and I have dedicated myself for this
[1:01:13] service today but Lord I pray Lord as
[1:01:15] I'm dedicating myself to preach this
[1:01:18] this meeting today I pray that these
[1:01:20] Believers would dedicate themselves to
[1:01:22] hear the preaching of the word that that
[1:01:24] you would charge them as they are moving
[1:01:26] forward into this coming week of
[1:01:28] Thanksgiving that you would give them a
[1:01:30] word for the situation of life that they
[1:01:32] would recognize that you have heard
[1:01:34] their cries that you have seen them in
[1:01:37] the midst of all the chaos of this life
[1:01:40] and may they just return and give thanks
[1:01:42] to you for you have given us a book not
[1:01:45] closed but open unto us so father we
[1:01:47] turn and give thanks to the CH to to the
[1:01:50] true and living God and the Church of
[1:01:52] the Living God
[1:01:54] says amen and amen may God bless his
[1:01:57] word he may be seated here in the
[1:02:00] presence of the Lord as we say we like
[1:02:01] to take a thought on anointed anointed
[1:02:04] by taking the book and and and the Bible
[1:02:07] says here in John 1 and verse 11 that he
[1:02:11] he came unto his own and his own
[1:02:14] received him not but as many as received
[1:02:18] him to them gave he power to become the
[1:02:21] sons of God even to them that believe on
[1:02:24] his name now that word if you begin to
[1:02:27] study out and and your studiers of the
[1:02:30] scriptures and looking into the the
[1:02:32] Greek Lexicon you'll find that that this
[1:02:35] word here in he he came unto his own and
[1:02:38] his own received him not that word
[1:02:41] received in the Greek it is it is uh it
[1:02:44] is pronounced as lambano and that word
[1:02:47] receive it means to take it means to it
[1:02:50] means to take with a hand or to lay hold
[1:02:52] on it is to take up a thing to be
[1:02:54] carried it's to have have it's to catch
[1:02:57] and he goes on and he says he said but
[1:02:59] as many as received him to them gave he
[1:03:04] power to become the sons of God that as
[1:03:06] many as caught the Revelation as many
[1:03:08] that that took the Revelation as many
[1:03:10] that that laid a hold on it and carried
[1:03:13] it as to run with it to them gave he
[1:03:15] power to become the sons of God even to
[1:03:18] them that believe on his name which were
[1:03:20] not born of blood nor of the will of the
[1:03:23] flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[1:03:25] so the reason why that you are able to
[1:03:28] lay a hold and and the reason why you
[1:03:30] have come to this message is because
[1:03:33] simply that the spirit of God has saw
[1:03:35] you and ordained your being here he has
[1:03:38] elected you it wasn't your mother it
[1:03:39] wasn't your father it wasn't your family
[1:03:42] genealogy that brought you here you may
[1:03:44] have your granddaddy may have been in a
[1:03:45] message and your mother may have been in
[1:03:47] a message but that's not the reason that
[1:03:49] you are here God uses families to
[1:03:52] witness to one another but the reason
[1:03:54] why you are here is because the very
[1:03:56] Mind Of God saw you he saw you grabbing
[1:03:59] a hold of the revelation of the hour and
[1:04:01] I think it's I think it's powerful to
[1:04:03] recognize that that God not only he not
[1:04:05] only calls our parents but he calls you
[1:04:07] and I as well even even though even
[1:04:10] though we might have we might have seen
[1:04:11] them grow up we may have seen their
[1:04:13] experience we may have seen them go
[1:04:14] through the the the uh the uh Elements
[1:04:17] of Life but it is amazing to look that
[1:04:20] it isn't your mother and your father's
[1:04:22] Revelation that you're here but it's
[1:04:24] simply because of the Gen seat of God
[1:04:26] that that he deposited on the inside of
[1:04:28] you that that's the reason that you're
[1:04:30] here that's the reason now now brother
[1:04:33] brandom what I'm just going to labor
[1:04:35] some things here on these thoughts this
[1:04:37] morning and and I I pray that you'll
[1:04:39] you'll just bear with me this morning
[1:04:41] now brother manam would say in the
[1:04:42] anointed ones at the end time he said
[1:04:44] now anointed one is one with a message
[1:04:48] anointed one is one with a message and
[1:04:51] the only way that a message can be
[1:04:53] brought out is by the one that's
[1:04:55] anointed and that would be a prophet or
[1:04:57] an anointed the anointed one and Jesus
[1:05:00] would say in Matthew 10:40 that he that
[1:05:03] receiveth you receiveth me and re he
[1:05:06] that receiveth me receiveth him that
[1:05:09] sent me he goes on to say that he that
[1:05:11] receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:05:13] prophet or he that he that takes or he
[1:05:16] that carries or or he that grabs a hold
[1:05:18] of it to carry it away he that receiveth
[1:05:21] a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[1:05:24] receive a prophet et's reward and he
[1:05:27] that is a right receiveth a righteous
[1:05:29] man in the name of a righteous man shall
[1:05:31] receive a righteous man's reward and
[1:05:34] brother brandom has asked a question in
[1:05:36] 1964 in question and answers that said
[1:05:39] brother brandom if you have time please
[1:05:40] explain Matthew 10 and 41 he said I
[1:05:43] would like to know what is a prophet's
[1:05:46] reward he said I he said he said it's
[1:05:48] like this he said if they want to know
[1:05:50] what a prophet's reward is it's to be a
[1:05:53] friend to the prophet he said that's
[1:05:55] reward he's your friend like the
[1:05:57] shunamite woman it might come in handy
[1:06:00] sometime it did with her he said you
[1:06:02] watch God servant you see sometimes you
[1:06:05] don't even realize that you you have
[1:06:07] become a friend to a prophet and
[1:06:09] sometimes you don't even realize who you
[1:06:11] who youve bumped shoulders with but they
[1:06:13] are the anointed of God and you say well
[1:06:16] what is that what does that mean brother
[1:06:17] Andrew it's kind of like maybe I'll just
[1:06:19] put it in in perspective to you it's
[1:06:21] kind of like a guide or or a supporter
[1:06:23] of somebody that is a that is a mountain
[1:06:25] climber and the guy is standing down at
[1:06:27] the bottom and he he's standing there
[1:06:29] and he's watching the mountain climber
[1:06:30] and he's he's telling he said he's
[1:06:32] telling them from the bottom said now
[1:06:33] look if you can if you can just go to
[1:06:35] your left and you can hang on right
[1:06:37] there that guy down there at the bottom
[1:06:39] he's sitting there and he's supporting
[1:06:40] him he's giving him motivation now you
[1:06:42] hold on right there because you're
[1:06:44] getting ready to to come to some steep
[1:06:46] spots you're getting ready to get into
[1:06:48] some areas you see that's kind of like
[1:06:50] you and I it's kind of like you and I
[1:06:52] have become a friend to a prophet you
[1:06:54] see we are not able to go up to the
[1:06:56] heights of the mountain climber but
[1:06:59] we've been able to stand right there and
[1:07:01] look and see and enjoy the benefits of
[1:07:03] what the mountain climber has been able
[1:07:05] to go up there and see and tell us that
[1:07:08] he's seen these things he he saw heaven
[1:07:10] opened up he he saw the revelation of
[1:07:12] the hour it's a very powerful thing to
[1:07:14] recognize that the reason why you're
[1:07:17] benefiting to overcoming in Leia it's
[1:07:20] because there's somebody that climbed a
[1:07:23] mountain there was somebody that climbed
[1:07:25] a mountain mountain and is looking down
[1:07:26] to you and says this is what it looks
[1:07:28] like over there Joshua this is what it
[1:07:31] looks like over there Caleb this is what
[1:07:33] it looks like it's a good land it's a
[1:07:35] goodly land it's got a it's got good
[1:07:37] Heritage in
[1:07:39] it
[1:07:41] Hallelujah now we begin to study out the
[1:07:45] context of anointing throughout the
[1:07:46] Bible and there's there's so many
[1:07:48] scriptures that that lay there and I
[1:07:50] just would like to hit some highlights
[1:07:52] of of the context of anointing
[1:07:54] throughout the Bible
[1:07:56] that we realize when you when you study
[1:07:58] out the definition of of anointing
[1:08:00] throughout the Bible you'll see when
[1:08:02] whenever it is somebody is is is is when
[1:08:06] God says they are anointed or they are
[1:08:08] God's anointed or or or they are
[1:08:09] anointed of the Lord that anointing
[1:08:11] means to authorize or to set a person
[1:08:14] for a particular work or a service it
[1:08:17] signifies that that person belongs to
[1:08:19] God in a special sense it being he he
[1:08:23] has chosen he is commissioned for a
[1:08:25] Divine Purpose just like Jesus could
[1:08:28] stand there in Isaiah he could read
[1:08:30] Isaiah 61 and he realized that this was
[1:08:33] not for another Prophet but this was for
[1:08:35] him he he saw himself that that he come
[1:08:38] under the anointing of the Messiah when
[1:08:40] you study out the anointing in the Old
[1:08:42] Testament you see the context of it
[1:08:44] you'll see the roles of the anointed was
[1:08:46] ones that was priests or Kings and
[1:08:49] prophets were were anointed and when
[1:08:51] they when they would come to their
[1:08:53] position you would find that a prophet
[1:08:55] would come in there and they would
[1:08:56] anoint them with oil to signify that
[1:08:58] they had a dedication and an authority
[1:09:01] by almighty God to stand in the position
[1:09:04] that they were in and you see when they
[1:09:06] come to that spot when many times you
[1:09:08] you'll see Samuel as he's pouring the
[1:09:10] oil out upon it is a symbolic act by a
[1:09:14] prophet that is that is under God's
[1:09:16] authority to pour out the anointing oil
[1:09:18] on Saul or o pour it out on David or or
[1:09:20] to pour it out on Solomon there's two
[1:09:22] prophets that were anointed in the same
[1:09:24] way throughout in Old Testament but
[1:09:26] you're watching it it is a symbology of
[1:09:29] the holy spirit being poured out upon
[1:09:31] your life just when you watch the
[1:09:34] anointing fall or David being anointed
[1:09:36] to be king it's like you sitting there
[1:09:39] you didn't look like the right kind of
[1:09:40] man you didn't look like the right kind
[1:09:42] of King you was short you was Ruddy you
[1:09:45] was insignificant but almighty God saw
[1:09:48] you he ordained you to this
[1:09:51] position and there are in the Old
[1:09:53] Testament Messiah prophecies that are
[1:09:56] laying there that are described as the
[1:09:58] anointed one and and the Book of Psalms
[1:10:00] and the Old Testament prophecies would
[1:10:03] lay in there that would cause the cause
[1:10:06] the future generations to be looking for
[1:10:08] a coming king or one that would be
[1:10:10] anointed or or the Messiah and when you
[1:10:13] dive into the New Testament and you look
[1:10:15] at the context of of the word anointed
[1:10:17] you'll find that Christ the anointed the
[1:10:20] word Messiah the word messiah in the
[1:10:22] Hebrew and Christ in the Greek both mean
[1:10:26] anointed
[1:10:27] one they both mean the anointed one but
[1:10:30] when you dive into us as his disciples
[1:10:33] that all the Disciples of God are are
[1:10:36] are are what we would say as the
[1:10:38] anointed ones that we are God's own
[1:10:42] commission for his service I'm going to
[1:10:45] give you some scripture here just now
[1:10:47] for the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 1
[1:10:49] and 21 now he which establish us with
[1:10:52] you in Christ hath anointed us
[1:10:55] is God the reason why you're here and
[1:10:59] the reason why you're understanding is
[1:11:01] because there is an anointing that has
[1:11:03] been poured out by almighty God when you
[1:11:06] look at it that you can find that when
[1:11:09] when they would come that when you look
[1:11:10] at the context of anointing in the old
[1:11:13] in the New Testament you'll find that
[1:11:14] healing anointing was there that the
[1:11:17] that Jesus would he would send out his
[1:11:19] disciples he would send them out two by
[1:11:21] two and he would stand there and he
[1:11:22] would tell them said now if any man does
[1:11:24] not receive you dust your feet off of
[1:11:26] that situation he said but when you come
[1:11:29] into a city he said You cast out devils
[1:11:32] and you anoint the sick with oil and you
[1:11:34] pray the prayer of faith over
[1:11:36] them you anoint the sick for healing
[1:11:41] that's why we can stand here and
[1:11:43] recognize that everything that is given
[1:11:45] to the Church of the Living God you're
[1:11:47] anointed for
[1:11:48] it you realize that you could come here
[1:11:51] this morning with a sickness in your
[1:11:53] body and I as a man of God as a minister
[1:11:55] of God that I'm anointed to pray the
[1:11:58] prayer of faith over top of you anoint
[1:12:00] you with oil and you can walk out of
[1:12:02] here
[1:12:04] healed do you realize that I'm anointed
[1:12:07] in the same way to stand here and to
[1:12:10] preach salvation unto you I'm anointed
[1:12:12] as a man of God to stand here and preach
[1:12:15] the Gospel of Jesus Christ and sons of
[1:12:18] God in a moment can be saved by the
[1:12:23] preaching of the word
[1:12:27] Hallelujah the Holy Spirit anoints
[1:12:30] Believers and he brings them to an
[1:12:32] understanding and a guidance and
[1:12:34] empowerment because the Bible said in 1
[1:12:36] John 2 and 20 but you have an unction
[1:12:39] you have a an anointing from the Holy
[1:12:42] One and you know all things verse 27 but
[1:12:46] the anointing which you have
[1:12:49] lambano received of him abideth in
[1:12:53] you come on amen thank you Lord David
[1:12:58] would feel the anointing of God that
[1:12:59] would come upon him and the spirit of
[1:13:02] God would partly anoint him and it would
[1:13:04] partly anoint Moses and it would partly
[1:13:07] anoint Solomon and it would partly
[1:13:09] anoint it would partly anoint Daniel and
[1:13:11] all the old prophets they would come
[1:13:13] under the anointing but the anointing
[1:13:15] would leave them and the anointing would
[1:13:17] come and the anointing would go but
[1:13:20] Jesus said that the anointing that I've
[1:13:23] placed on your life it is abiding in you
[1:13:27] so that's why Jesus would say don't you
[1:13:29] ever fear to go anywhere he said I'll
[1:13:32] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[1:13:34] you and the prophet Heard a Voice said I
[1:13:37] the never-failing presence of Jesus
[1:13:40] Christ is with you wherever that you
[1:13:44] go so there is a dual
[1:13:47] anointing there's a physical anointing
[1:13:50] of laying hands an anointing with oil
[1:13:53] but there's an spiritual anointing
[1:13:55] it's the work of the spirit of God in a
[1:13:57] believer's heart and mind and filling
[1:13:59] them not with not with knowledge not
[1:14:02] with psychology but Power because that's
[1:14:05] what William Brandon would say that that
[1:14:07] is what the anointing is the anointing
[1:14:10] is not shouting the anointing is not
[1:14:12] emotions but the anointing is supreme
[1:14:15] power under
[1:14:16] control that's why William Brandon when
[1:14:19] you would hear him say over and over
[1:14:20] again that the anointing of the Lord is
[1:14:23] here I'm waiting on it the anointing of
[1:14:25] he said the anointing has just left me
[1:14:27] he said but here it comes here it comes
[1:14:30] he was anointing him for a Ministry of
[1:14:33] discernment and taking him through
[1:14:35] people's lives well you say brother
[1:14:37] Andrew what are you saying what is the
[1:14:38] anointing I can say it only by the
[1:14:41] scripture that it is Christ the word
[1:14:44] because the Bible said in Isaiah 59 and
[1:14:46] 21 as for me this is my Covenant with
[1:14:50] them sayith the Lord my spirit that is
[1:14:53] upon thee and my words which I have put
[1:14:55] in my mouth in thy mouth shall not
[1:14:57] depart out of thy mouth nor out of the
[1:14:59] mouth of thy seed Hallelujah nor out of
[1:15:02] the mouth of thy seed seed saith the
[1:15:04] Lord from henceforth and forever more so
[1:15:08] I'm saying this to you that the
[1:15:10] anointing that is coming upon you it's
[1:15:12] the word of the
[1:15:13] hour it's the word of the hour you say
[1:15:16] well is it just for me absolutely not
[1:15:19] it's for your seed and for your seed
[1:15:21] seed it ain't just for brother Charles
[1:15:24] it ain't just for sister
[1:15:26] Katie it's for Quinn it's for AA it's
[1:15:29] for every single one of us every single
[1:15:32] one you say well how in the world are we
[1:15:34] going to get in this position I don't
[1:15:37] understand how your prodal are going to
[1:15:39] have to come under this anointing but I
[1:15:41] simply take it by the word of the
[1:15:44] Lord that we would be there and our
[1:15:47] Offspring
[1:15:49] also I don't know how to do it I don't
[1:15:52] know how to get them there I don't know
[1:15:54] how to preach come there but ex simply
[1:15:56] expressing the very thoughts of God and
[1:16:00] if I can express it if I can push it if
[1:16:04] I can preach it and you can pull
[1:16:07] it I don't know how they're going to be
[1:16:09] there I don't understand where they're
[1:16:11] going to be standing at when the
[1:16:13] Revelation strikes them but they are
[1:16:16] anointed to come to this message
[1:16:27] Hallelujah they're anointed to come to
[1:16:30] this
[1:16:33] message Hallelujah a Baptist message is
[1:16:36] not anointing them to come here a
[1:16:38] Methodist message is not anointing them
[1:16:40] to come here but there is an anointing
[1:16:43] of the message of the hour that is
[1:16:45] bringing you to their
[1:16:49] position how do I get there brother
[1:16:51] Andrew you're anointed by taking the
[1:16:56] right that's right I know it's going to
[1:16:58] get awkward when you sit down at your
[1:17:00] Thanksgiving dinner this week and there
[1:17:03] are people that are sitting over across
[1:17:04] from you that do not believe this
[1:17:07] message but you stand there as a Son of
[1:17:10] God they may not believe like you and
[1:17:13] you ain't got to preach to them you just
[1:17:15] simply live a life it'll be that life
[1:17:18] that power that anointing that literally
[1:17:22] draws him
[1:17:31] come on sir you can lock them up in a
[1:17:32] prison and they'll still get out you can
[1:17:35] put them in drugs and they'll still get
[1:17:37] out there is an
[1:17:45] anointing
[1:17:47] Hallelujah my brother Brandon would say
[1:17:49] in the message of
[1:17:51] paradox he said now what is it he said
[1:17:54] Christ is coming to the body Christ is
[1:17:56] the word he said we all know the
[1:17:58] anointing is Christ he said that comes
[1:17:59] on the word that makes the word live is
[1:18:01] that right amen he said that is the
[1:18:09] anointing y'all okay he said we all know
[1:18:12] that the anointing is Christ that comes
[1:18:14] on the word that makes it live I I I I
[1:18:17] felt that kind of just go over but let
[1:18:19] me I want to reiterate that and
[1:18:21] actually
[1:18:23] yeah I'll just say it he wants to say it
[1:18:25] again we all know that the anointing is
[1:18:28] Christ that comes on the word that makes
[1:18:30] the word live he said that is the
[1:18:34] anointing that is the anointing now
[1:18:36] brother Rand I'm just going to just hear
[1:18:38] by the inspiration just for a minute I'm
[1:18:39] coming back to this but brother Brandon
[1:18:41] was talking to a lady he said I see you
[1:18:43] out there in a wheelchair he said now he
[1:18:45] said why would you be in a wheelchair he
[1:18:47] said except for God wanted to test your
[1:18:49] faith he said now if if the ministries
[1:18:51] of the day cannot produce he said if
[1:18:54] they cannot produce they shall lay hands
[1:18:56] on the sick and they shall recover that
[1:18:58] these signs shall follow them that
[1:18:59] belief he said then you have a right to
[1:19:02] disbelieve the message he said if signs
[1:19:05] aren't following that but the reason why
[1:19:08] the anointing Hallelujah is here it's
[1:19:11] because Christ makes the word
[1:19:15] alive that's why I take such uh gumption
[1:19:19] to come out and I take such courage to
[1:19:22] walk out and pray the prayer of faith
[1:19:23] over you no matter how bad the situation
[1:19:26] is no matter how ugly the place is no
[1:19:29] matter the condition that you're in or
[1:19:31] the back pain that you're in I can take
[1:19:33] gumption as a country boy as a preacher
[1:19:36] of this message I can stand there and
[1:19:39] pray it over
[1:19:41] you because I know there's still power I
[1:19:45] know there's still anointing I know
[1:19:47] there's still enough power in the name
[1:19:49] of Jesus
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:19:52] Christ you ain't got no right to
[1:19:54] disbelief this
[1:19:57] message you got no right to disbelieve
[1:19:59] this message there's power here there's
[1:20:02] healings here there's signs here there's
[1:20:04] wonders here so I say this to you be
[1:20:08] healed in the name of Jesus
[1:20:15] Christ let me go just a little bit
[1:20:17] further I'm not talking about your
[1:20:19] physical body but I'm talking about your
[1:20:21] emotions be
[1:20:23] healed I'm talking about your complexes
[1:20:26] be healed I'm talking about your fears
[1:20:29] be
[1:20:32] healed I want you to know I feel healing
[1:20:35] in the room this morning there's an
[1:20:37] anointing here for your healing you've
[1:20:39] been hurt there's an anointing here for
[1:20:41] that you've been Afflicted there's an
[1:20:43] anointing here for
[1:20:49] that that is the anointing Christ is the
[1:20:52] anointing the spirit that comes upon the
[1:20:53] word that quick is the word to make it
[1:21:00] live he said the church has got to get
[1:21:02] to the
[1:21:03] ministry until the church and Christ
[1:21:06] become one he can anoint you for every
[1:21:09] blessing that's in the
[1:21:14] Bible all of it is
[1:21:18] yours I'm going somewhere today y'all
[1:21:21] just y'all keep hanging on with me I
[1:21:23] know I know you're listening t
[1:21:25] he said but all of it is yours he can
[1:21:27] anoint you for every blessing that's in
[1:21:29] the Bible you see you see then if the
[1:21:32] anointing strikes he said it don't
[1:21:34] anoint it so if you're standing there
[1:21:36] and you're believing for your prodical
[1:21:38] and you're standing under that anointing
[1:21:40] and the anointing strikes that you can
[1:21:42] believe it because all of them things
[1:21:44] are for you if you got if you got
[1:21:46] certain situations and the anointing of
[1:21:48] God at the pulpit strikes the heart of
[1:21:51] the believer back there that's holding
[1:21:52] on to something that the preacher
[1:21:54] himself can't see it anoints you to
[1:21:56] believe it and accept it and it'll make
[1:21:58] it happen you see it's kind of like
[1:22:00] these wires it's kind of like these
[1:22:02] wires that run from Harrisonburg to Elon
[1:22:05] that are bringing power back and forth
[1:22:07] through their energy plants you see you
[1:22:09] see it it can be a perfectly fine wire
[1:22:12] it can be sitting there he said but you
[1:22:14] see but it's it's a notot it's not got
[1:22:17] no power in it he said as as long as
[1:22:20] it's looking if it looks like the right
[1:22:22] kind of wire come on you you see you can
[1:22:25] look at it you can see all the
[1:22:26] descriptions that that's got that's got
[1:22:28] the ability it's got the capacity it's
[1:22:31] got it's got It's it has the ability to
[1:22:33] power houses it has the ability to light
[1:22:36] up a light up a air conditioner and a
[1:22:38] heating pump to bring to bring warmth in
[1:22:41] the winter and cool in the
[1:22:43] summer but unless it's hooked up to a
[1:22:46] conductor it just looks the part and
[1:22:50] there's a whole lot of Christians that
[1:22:52] just look the part there's a whole lot
[1:22:54] of people in the message that try to
[1:22:56] dress the
[1:22:57] part but they're not hooked up to a
[1:23:00] power
[1:23:02] source it can look the part it can dress
[1:23:05] the part it can talk the part but unless
[1:23:09] it is hooked up to a conductor to the
[1:23:12] power
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:15] source Hallelujah I believe brother
[1:23:18] brandom said it in wisdom versus Faith
[1:23:20] he said when Jesus he said when Satan
[1:23:22] came against Jesus up there on the
[1:23:23] mountain he said he come up against he
[1:23:25] said he didn't realize it he said but he
[1:23:28] singed his feathers when they come up
[1:23:29] against him he said he hit a 100 billion
[1:23:31] vote wire when he hit him he said now
[1:23:34] Satan had a vult too he said but it
[1:23:36] didn't have no power in it he said but
[1:23:39] Jesus's wire had some power in it I say
[1:23:42] Satan's in for
[1:23:44] trouble if he comes against the Church
[1:23:46] of the Living God they might be a cage
[1:23:49] of every unclean and hateful bird but
[1:23:51] when they come against the power the
[1:23:54] conductor the Holy Ghost is
[1:23:57] there he's there to make it live he's
[1:24:00] there to make it
[1:24:06] work what are you saying BR I'm saying
[1:24:08] that you are destined you are prepared
[1:24:11] to

[1:24:32] pickles
[1:24:35] sometimes we was up there working in the
[1:24:37] Attic one
[1:24:38] time he looked at me said if I don't do

[1:25:03] power I felt that he's tried to kick you
[1:25:06] off his power he's tried to keep you
[1:25:08] from this message he's tried to keep you
[1:25:10] from the realities of this message by
[1:25:12] offering you worldly things let me tell
[1:25:14] you something you have got to be sold
[1:25:16] out to this message you have got to be
[1:25:18] so it cannot be about your money it
[1:25:20] cannot be about your job it cannot be
[1:25:22] about your influence in this world world
[1:25:24] it's got to be about the anointing of
[1:25:27] the
[1:25:28] hour you see so many people that are
[1:25:31] chasing a dollar and chasing this and
[1:25:33] trying to get rich and trying to get
[1:25:34] Fame but it'll get them
[1:25:38] nowhere Mercy I didn't think I'd hurt
[1:25:40] y'all that bad but I'll say this again
[1:25:42] it's about the
[1:25:48] message I know you got to provide I know
[1:25:51] you got to take care of your family but
[1:25:53] let Church be church
[1:25:57] again it's time you get hooked back up
[1:25:59] to the Dynamo get hooked back into the
[1:26:02] power I know that every devil in Hell's
[1:26:04] try to kick you away from the message
[1:26:05] tried to tell you that that we were that
[1:26:07] we were nothing but a cult that we were
[1:26:09] nothing but a bunch of people that were
[1:26:11] following a man but it's time to get
[1:26:13] hooked back up to some anointing power
[1:26:16] if you left the
[1:26:17] message it's time to come
[1:26:23] back h
[1:26:25] Hallelujah get back into it get back to
[1:26:28] reading your Bible get back to praying
[1:26:31] get
[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:38] back Jesus said when he was in his
[1:26:43] prayer of
[1:26:46] intercessory he comes to his prayer of
[1:26:49] intercessory and he's standing
[1:26:52] there John chapter 17 is such a
[1:26:56] powerful powerful chapter but Jesus is
[1:26:59] standing there and he said father make
[1:27:02] them one like we are
[1:27:05] one not the kind of world that the world
[1:27:08] not the kind of Oneness that the world's
[1:27:09] trying to produce but let me read it to
[1:27:11] you from a prophet he said who do you
[1:27:12] say this is in 1964 he said be one as I
[1:27:15] and the father one he said be that kind
[1:27:18] of one he said then how will that be he
[1:27:20] said the word in us would be the
[1:27:22] anointed word that is the Oneness of God
[1:27:25] he said the Oneness of God is the word
[1:27:27] anointed in you and then you become a
[1:27:30] messiah of the age that's what a messiah
[1:27:33] means it is the anointed one and that's
[1:27:36] why Jesus would say or brother Randon
[1:27:38] would say in the message Messiah he said
[1:27:40] he was Messiah he said but you are
[1:27:42] Messiahs your little lights the same
[1:27:45] power that was in Jesus is the same
[1:27:48] power that is in you now G or the Bible
[1:27:52] said in John 3 and 27 that man can
[1:27:54] receive nothing except it be given him
[1:27:57] from heaven now we know that the Bible
[1:27:59] teaches us that all scripture is given
[1:28:02] by the very breath of almighty God by
[1:28:05] the very inspiration and we realize that
[1:28:08] the word that we have read in the old
[1:28:09] test that the prophecy that came in old
[1:28:12] time was not by the will of man but it
[1:28:15] was simply by the will of God and they
[1:28:17] were moved and they spake as they were
[1:28:20] moved by the Holy Ghost you see there is
[1:28:22] only one thing that will ever catch the
[1:28:24] elect of God's mind and that is they are
[1:28:27] watching for the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:28:30] of what a prophet said you see it's the
[1:28:32] identification of a prophets of his
[1:28:35] presence is when he stays with the word
[1:28:38] that's his credentials is when a prophet
[1:28:40] stays right there with the word and when
[1:28:43] when when the angel came to Gabriel or
[1:28:45] the angel Gabriel came to Mary and he
[1:28:47] standing there and he's talking to her
[1:28:49] he's telling her all the scriptures he's
[1:28:51] telling her how these things are going
[1:28:53] to be the the reason why Mary had faith
[1:28:55] enough to believe that angel was because
[1:28:57] a prophet had said
[1:28:59] that and the reason why you can stand
[1:29:02] here and you can receive these things is
[1:29:05] because you know that it's laying right
[1:29:07] there in the scripture the message ain't
[1:29:09] bringing you something new the message
[1:29:11] is simply clarifying and bringing a
[1:29:14] light to it so that you can
[1:29:16] see you see all the things were perfect
[1:29:20] in the Ephesian Church age until they
[1:29:22] left the first love but you see way
[1:29:25] throughout men came in there and they
[1:29:27] broke off this and they broke off that
[1:29:29] but that's why the ministry of the
[1:29:31] seventh angel was so
[1:29:33] important was to Simply Place everything
[1:29:36] back and he could not have done it on
[1:29:39] his own accord he had to get under the
[1:29:41] anointing of the eagle anointing and
[1:29:43] stand there under the anointing of
[1:29:45] Malachi 4 he could stand there he had to
[1:29:48] have the same holy ghost that Mary had
[1:29:51] he had to receive the same experience
[1:29:52] that Paul had
[1:29:57] but they come
[1:29:59] there the angel starts talking to her so
[1:30:02] these things are going to be this way
[1:30:04] you see the reason why the word could
[1:30:06] sink into our heart was because there
[1:30:08] had been some ground that was already
[1:30:10] prepared for it you see God is never
[1:30:12] going to say something unless there's
[1:30:14] somebody out there that's already set up
[1:30:16] to receive it you see you see he was
[1:30:19] able to speak those things because he
[1:30:21] knew Mary was
[1:30:22] coming he would have never said that
[1:30:25] through Isaiah's mouth if he didn't see
[1:30:27] Mary already coming he would have never
[1:30:29] said that there's going to be a spotless
[1:30:31] bride unless he already saw you
[1:30:33] coming I say it like this Christ does
[1:30:36] not have to have a rebuttal he doesn't
[1:30:39] have to go back and take anything out of
[1:30:40] his documents and go back in there and
[1:30:42] restudy the case he doesn't have to look
[1:30:45] back in say did I really do that or did
[1:30:47] I really say that about them he's not
[1:30:49] having to have a rebuttal this morning
[1:30:51] he's looking in there and you may not
[1:30:53] look like the part
[1:30:56] but you are
[1:30:58] everything you may not feel it right now
[1:31:01] but it's all over
[1:31:04] you reason why she could receive it was
[1:31:08] because she didn't run
[1:31:12] around she wasn't manhandled she had put
[1:31:15] herself in position of urgency so that
[1:31:18] she could receive the spoken
[1:31:20] word that's why this message is able to
[1:31:23] come to you you ain't been manhandled
[1:31:25] you ain't been handled by denominations
[1:31:27] you ain't been hand you ain't been
[1:31:30] handled by men
[1:31:32] theologies you see well I was in that
[1:31:34] condition I was in that democracy I was
[1:31:36] I was in that denomination I was under
[1:31:38] that
[1:31:39] power but that's why there's an
[1:31:41] invisible Union that has taken place
[1:31:43] you're Justified as if you never was a
[1:31:46] Catholic you never was an homas you
[1:31:48] never was a
[1:31:50] menit you never did it in the first
[1:31:53] place
[1:31:54] he put you in position to receive the
[1:31:58] [Applause]
[1:32:05] word
[1:32:11] hallu
[1:32:13] hallelujah he knew where you'd be at he
[1:32:16] knew the ground that you'd be planted in
[1:32:18] he knew the time and the season that
[1:32:20] you'd be coming but your heart was just
[1:32:23] life for the seed to fall into and when
[1:32:26] the seed struck Mary's heart she didn't
[1:32:29] wait till she was positive she didn't
[1:32:31] wait for a cycle to stop she started
[1:32:34] testifying that there was a new cycle
[1:32:37] that was in
[1:32:39] position
[1:32:42] Hallelujah let me say this to you you
[1:32:44] are in you are in Rapture cycle there's
[1:32:47] never been anybody in your position
[1:32:49] before but the reason why you're in this
[1:32:51] position is because the message of
[1:32:53] Malachi 4 got you in this position you
[1:32:57] was no good you was unworthy but the
[1:33:00] message change your
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:12] story what are you saying brother hendre
[1:33:15] I'm saying it's time you step in your
[1:33:17] position it's time we have some more
[1:33:19] marries before you get healed start
[1:33:22] testifying about it before you see your
[1:33:24] prodical get back in
[1:33:27] here I may not have the ministry I may
[1:33:30] not have the ministry of brother Donnie
[1:33:32] I may not have the ministry of brother
[1:33:33] Tim I may not have the ministry of
[1:33:35] brother Ron but I will have a Ministry
[1:33:38] that my Ministry is is liable for going
[1:33:40] after your prodal and I will go to my
[1:33:44] grave believing that God is
[1:33:49] able I'm anointed to believe it
[1:34:06] I firmly believe that with all that's
[1:34:08] within
[1:34:08] Me Jesus wasn't walking around asking
[1:34:11] himself am I the Messiah am I am I
[1:34:13] really the one am I am I am I the guy he
[1:34:16] didn't go around questioning he simply
[1:34:18] stepped into the position of it he
[1:34:20] simply knew that he was there to do it
[1:34:21] he knew who he was he knew it so much
[1:34:24] that he was talking to a woman like you
[1:34:26] that was out of shape and she said I
[1:34:28] know that when the Messiah comes he said
[1:34:30] he that speaketh unto you he wasn't
[1:34:32] questioning he said I'm he I'm the guy
[1:34:36] I'm the guy that's returning your
[1:34:37] worship back to its rightful
[1:34:41] position and he that receiveth
[1:34:44] you receiveth him that sent
[1:34:48] me now the Bible said in Revelations 10:
[1:34:52] 7
[1:34:55] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:34:56] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:34:59] sound the mystery of God shall be
[1:35:00] finished as he had declared it to the
[1:35:02] servants as prophets and the voice which
[1:35:03] I heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[1:35:05] and said
[1:35:08] go and take
[1:35:12] it
[1:35:14] go and receive
[1:35:17] it to
[1:35:20] them that received him gave you power
[1:35:24] to become the sons of God what are you
[1:35:27] saying I'm saying that the God that was
[1:35:30] back there in Jesus's day is a god that
[1:35:32] is standing right here saying go and
[1:35:34] take the little book which is open in
[1:35:37] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:35:39] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:35:40] went unto the angel said unto him give
[1:35:42] me the little book and he said unto me
[1:35:46] take
[1:35:47] it take it take it what are you saying
[1:35:51] brother Andrew I'm saying it ain't
[1:35:53] William brandom's job no more I'm saying
[1:35:55] it's your job I'm saying take it I'm
[1:35:58] saying receive it I'm saying run with
[1:36:00] everything that you got within you I run
[1:36:03] as though I had not attained but I'm
[1:36:05] going to apprehend I'm going to believe
[1:36:08] this I'm going to run with this message
[1:36:10] let me get some letters from home and
[1:36:12] let me tell you that God is faithful God
[1:36:15] is able God is good God still saves God
[1:36:18] still got
[1:36:20] Mercy go and take the book
[1:36:23] you're not fumbling around trying to
[1:36:25] figure out your position as the body of
[1:36:27] Jesus Christ you took it and if you took
[1:36:32] it
[1:36:35] hallu if you took it it was a sign of
[1:36:38] your election it was a sign that you
[1:36:40] were ordained from almighty
[1:36:44] God that's why Satan is roaring like a
[1:36:47] he's going about like a roaring line
[1:36:49] it's because he recognized that the
[1:36:51] scripture of Christ The Mystery of God
[1:36:54] has been revealed that's what he's
[1:36:55] howling about is that this message is
[1:36:58] becoming identified in a bride's body
[1:37:01] she's anointed by taking this
[1:37:09] book my my I've told you this before
[1:37:12] that there's some new ones that are
[1:37:14] amongst us my great grandmother Clara
[1:37:17] Spencer she she
[1:37:21] was she was a real Christian lady I
[1:37:24] never had the opportunity to meet her
[1:37:26] but but as as a patriarch of our of our
[1:37:31] family the meetings that you the
[1:37:33] meetings that you go down and enjoy
[1:37:35] brother Shawn Martin's there in
[1:37:36] Christiansburg that was on my that was
[1:37:38] on my great grandfather's property right
[1:37:41] there is where my my grandfather Charlie
[1:37:43] Spencer would plant ters and and
[1:37:44] tomatoes and different things and and
[1:37:46] the Lord preserve that preserve that
[1:37:48] land so that it would stay that it would
[1:37:50] stay in the family because my
[1:37:52] grandfather was a my great-grandfather
[1:37:54] was a he was a wicked man and he was
[1:37:56] trying to sell family he was trying to
[1:37:57] sell the land and everything else and
[1:37:59] CLA Spencer recognized that that if this
[1:38:01] if this land got sold that she wouldn't
[1:38:02] be able to provide for her family
[1:38:04] because it provided nourishment for
[1:38:06] their family and so all these men came
[1:38:08] in there and they they had it up for
[1:38:09] auction and all these people come in
[1:38:11] there for the auction and it was going
[1:38:12] up for
[1:38:13] sale but when it time come time to for
[1:38:16] the auction there was not one person
[1:38:18] that bought a razor
[1:38:20] hand because there was a woman that
[1:38:22] prayed there was a woman that prayed
[1:38:24] that she needed she needed some land to
[1:38:27] be able to preserve her family do you
[1:38:29] realize that God has got a preservation
[1:38:31] for the elect of God that when when when
[1:38:35] when when the CH when the cries of the
[1:38:37] children of Israel had got down there
[1:38:39] and God be to hear their cries that God
[1:38:42] would he would have a conference with
[1:38:44] Moses back there on the backside of the
[1:38:46] desert you see and your cries have the
[1:38:49] ability to preserve the
[1:38:52] elect that even in the midst of your
[1:38:54] crisis that you can have a showdown with
[1:38:57] almighty God and believe and pray and
[1:39:00] God will have a conference with
[1:39:04] you and she when she she she was a lady
[1:39:07] and there's Visions in our family and
[1:39:10] and my my great-grandmother had a vision
[1:39:13] of William brandham I know that many of
[1:39:14] you already know this but she had a
[1:39:16] vision of William brandham of who Elijah
[1:39:18] was in Malachi for she didn't know it
[1:39:19] was William brandham but she she had she
[1:39:22] had a vision of who Malachi 4 was that
[1:39:24] that this was going to be Elijah and she
[1:39:27] she had uh my P Charlie when he he came
[1:39:30] to the message in 1962 it was handed to
[1:39:33] him a message on a way of a true prophet
[1:39:36] and and and brother brandham would tell
[1:39:37] in the meeting right before that he said
[1:39:38] I'm going to preach I'm going to preach
[1:39:40] a sermon tomorrow or or the next day on
[1:39:42] the trail of a prophet I think it's
[1:39:45] pretty beautiful to think that that my
[1:39:47] family was on a trail of a prophet
[1:39:48] before we ever before we ever really
[1:39:51] realized it but God had us on that trail
[1:39:53] and and and she with my papa Charlie he
[1:39:56] received the message he wanted to share
[1:39:58] it just like anybody else wanted to
[1:39:59] share with his family well back in them
[1:40:01] day they they used to have the in the
[1:40:03] only Believe Books they had the message
[1:40:05] books and on the front fly leaf of it
[1:40:07] they had a picture of William brandom
[1:40:09] right there in the first and and my P
[1:40:11] Charlie started going in and he started
[1:40:12] presenting a message to her and and all
[1:40:14] of a sudden he he he opens it up and
[1:40:17] before she can read one word of it she
[1:40:19] sees William Brandon picture and she
[1:40:21] said that's Elijah
[1:40:23] that's Elijah because God had showed her
[1:40:26] before William Brandon was ever in
[1:40:28] position he had already showed Claris
[1:40:32] Spencer and you think about your family
[1:40:35] history how did you get here where you
[1:40:37] are how do you understand like you
[1:40:40] understand there is an anointing that
[1:40:43] has been placed on your life to come
[1:40:45] here and receive this
[1:40:50] message David would say in Psalms 4 5
[1:40:53] and 7even thou lovest righteousness and
[1:40:55] hateth wickedness therefore God thy God
[1:40:59] have Anointed with thee with oil of
[1:41:01] gladness above thy
[1:41:03] fellows you see he would say in the
[1:41:06] world again Fallen apart the church
[1:41:09] cannot run without the power of God
[1:41:10] through the word the Holy Ghost will
[1:41:12] only confirm the word of God for that's
[1:41:15] what it's to do the anointing is to
[1:41:18] confirm the word so the anointing in
[1:41:22] your life is to confirm the word of the
[1:41:26] hour so you've not just received an
[1:41:28] ordinary
[1:41:30] seal you've received a king's
[1:41:34] seal nobody can imitate this seal
[1:41:38] there's nobody can that can plug at it
[1:41:40] and pull you out of his hand because
[1:41:42] it's his seal he put it there the king
[1:41:45] knows where he where he plac the seal
[1:41:48] the Bible said in Psalms 92 and10 but my
[1:41:51] horn shall thou exalt like the Horn of a
[1:41:53] unicorn I shall be Anointed with fresh
[1:41:56] oil the passion says it like this your
[1:41:59] anointing has made me strong and mighty
[1:42:03] you've empowered my life for Triumph by
[1:42:06] pouring fresh oil over me David would
[1:42:10] say in Psalms 23 and4 yay though I walk
[1:42:14] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:42:15] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:42:19] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[1:42:21] comfort me thou prep preparest a table
[1:42:24] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:42:27] thou anointest my head with oil and my
[1:42:30] cup runneth over and I know that we are
[1:42:33] standing right here in the most wicked
[1:42:35] and most evil days where the forces of
[1:42:38] hell are against the Church of the
[1:42:40] Living God it does not surprise us
[1:42:43] because hell has fought against the
[1:42:45] Warlords of Christ over and over and
[1:42:48] over again but our Jehovah that is a
[1:42:51] Jehovah jyra he is a provider he has
[1:42:55] anointed a people and provided a people
[1:42:57] that will stand for
[1:42:59] truth I want I want you to know this
[1:43:02] that the anointing that is upon you to
[1:43:04] overcome Le
[1:43:06] osia is more than
[1:43:10] enough it's more than enough David said
[1:43:14] my cup
[1:43:16] runthe have to drink of it sparingly you
[1:43:19] don't have to wonder at it but you can
[1:43:21] stand there in this evil day as Paul
[1:43:23] would say finally my brethren be strong
[1:43:26] in the Lord and in the power of His
[1:43:29] might and put on the whole armor of God
[1:43:31] that you might be able to withstand in
[1:43:33] the evil
[1:43:35] day you have been anointed to stand
[1:43:38] against all the forces of
[1:43:41] hell and David would go through so many
[1:43:44] trials he was anointed king went back to
[1:43:48] back to hurting sheep and taking care of
[1:43:51] sheep comes out on the battlefield he
[1:43:53] worships before the king he goes out on
[1:43:55] a battlefield walks down into a
[1:44:01] valley and he sees all the fall he sees
[1:44:04] the rise of the economy of the anointed
[1:44:06] on Saul how that Saul had so completely
[1:44:10] in his apostasy turned away from the
[1:44:12] very mind of
[1:44:14] God and David come to the rise and the
[1:44:19] fall and he says in Psalms chapter 20
[1:44:22] and6
[1:44:23] now I
[1:44:25] know that the Lord saveth his
[1:44:28] anointed through it all sister C through
[1:44:32] it all I now
[1:44:34] know that the Lord
[1:44:38] saveth his
[1:44:40] anointed he will hear from his holy
[1:44:42] heaven with the saving
[1:44:44] strength of his right
[1:44:49] hand you see it's kind of like this
[1:44:54] it's like the sounding of a distress
[1:44:57] signal on a
[1:44:59] ship and they're out there caught in the
[1:45:01] middle of the storm they're out there at
[1:45:04] Sea and they're tossed about but the
[1:45:07] captain
[1:45:08] knows he knows that if he can sound this
[1:45:12] distress signal if he can get an
[1:45:14] attention of the coast guards he can
[1:45:17] send it through the fog they may not be
[1:45:19] able to see the light but they can hear
[1:45:21] the sound they can hear the sound and
[1:45:24] even maybe they don't come just right
[1:45:26] away but he keeps on sounding and he
[1:45:29] turns up the volume on his prayer and he
[1:45:31] keeps turning it up and now he can say
[1:45:33] now I know now I know that thou has
[1:45:36] saved thine anointed one I know I know
[1:45:39] that he will hear from his holy Heaven I
[1:45:43] know this I know that he's God in the
[1:45:45] mountain I know he's God in the valley
[1:45:48] he's that kind of a
[1:45:50] God because the spirit speaks
[1:45:54] expressedly of this leoty in church age
[1:45:57] how that it would be lukewarm and cold
[1:45:59] and formal she would be naked blind
[1:46:03] didn't even know that she was so
[1:46:04] wretched in a miserable
[1:46:07] stake but God has not made you to be a
[1:46:11] lukewarm conditioned
[1:46:13] believer he's not put you here so that
[1:46:16] you could feel the drafts of of the
[1:46:18] denominational breezes bro over you but
[1:46:20] he said in his scriptures that that this
[1:46:23] is the Zeal of the hour that thou must
[1:46:27] repent and anoint your eyes with
[1:46:33] ISAC brother man would say he said now
[1:46:35] what he said what would remind me of
[1:46:36] this scripture he said back on him Old
[1:46:38] Kentucky nights he said when we would be
[1:46:41] sitting up there and he said the snow
[1:46:42] would be blowing through the through the
[1:46:44] rafters of the cabin he said we get that
[1:46:46] old matter in our eyes he said get that
[1:46:49] matter in our eyes and he said he said
[1:46:50] we wake up in the morning said Mama we
[1:46:52] can't see
[1:46:53] there something wrong with me I can't
[1:46:54] see he said she' go in there and she'd
[1:46:56] take that old hot grease and she
[1:46:59] warm it up and she' said we'd be coming
[1:47:01] down the stairs and she'd take that hot
[1:47:03] grease and she'd rub it and smear
[1:47:06] it into our eyes you see anointing in
[1:47:08] Leviticus 8 is when the the anointing is
[1:47:11] poured over the priest and when it's
[1:47:14] smeared over the altar he said she would
[1:47:17] take that hot grease he said and
[1:47:19] she'd rub it on there and he said before
[1:47:21] long he said all the matter had come out
[1:47:24] of our eyes and we could see clearly the
[1:47:27] reason why the church World sees three
[1:47:29] Gods is they got too much Family Matters
[1:47:32] and and they've got too much the church
[1:47:34] denominational matters that's that's
[1:47:37] blocking their Vision so they can't
[1:47:38] focus on who the true God is so that's
[1:47:42] why you've got to have the Holy Spirit
[1:47:44] come in and rub the oil over your eyf
[1:47:47] rub the eyf over your eyes so that you
[1:47:50] can clearly see it ain't three Gods up
[1:47:52] up here it ain't two Gods up there it's
[1:47:55] one
[1:47:56] God and that same power that same
[1:47:59] anointing is in you little
[1:48:02] bride you're not
[1:48:09] lukewarm brother Mar said them cold
[1:48:11] drafts have been blowing on the church
[1:48:12] for quite some time he said they've been
[1:48:14] blowing on their church he said they've
[1:48:16] got some theology he said no theology
[1:48:18] that they've got has came from the book
[1:48:20] of an unbeliever he said it's come from
[1:48:22] a book of an unbeliever he said we don't
[1:48:24] need some psychology how to teach us who
[1:48:27] God is he said we've got the best book
[1:48:29] on psychology and it's a Bible he said
[1:48:32] it come from the mind of God he said
[1:48:34] that's the only psych Hallelujah that's
[1:48:36] the only psychology that we need the
[1:48:39] only book that we
[1:48:40] need let me tell you something I don't
[1:48:42] need Dr Dobson's ideas on how to live
[1:48:45] our how to live a life as a husband and
[1:48:47] not go down into pornography I don't
[1:48:49] need Dr doson seven steps on how to live
[1:48:52] and over coming life I've got the
[1:49:00] message there is no spot in this message
[1:49:03] for psychology the only psychology that
[1:49:06] we need is the
[1:49:08] [Applause]

[1:51:53] mean that to hurt you at all but I want
[1:51:56] to I want to expose something right here
[1:51:58] it's amazing it's amazing to look at it
[1:52:02] how that you can yield yourself over to
[1:52:05] the pleasures of life well you say well

[1:52:21] have no problem being able to stay awake
[1:52:23] and watch something on your phone or a
[1:52:25] movie but as soon as you pick up your
[1:52:27] Bible
[1:52:32] you Spirit of Slumber comes over you
[1:52:35] ain't that amazing I mean here you are
[1:52:38] you're a holy ghost fi person and you as
[1:52:40] soon as you grab your bible or your
[1:52:41] church age book and all of a sudden you
[1:52:43] start diving in
[1:52:48] there come on ain't that amazing
[1:52:53] now you know you got the Holy
[1:52:56] Ghost you know you do and all of a
[1:52:59] sudden you absolutely if you got the
[1:53:01] Holy Ghost you love to do it but what is
[1:53:03] it it is the spirit of the age that you
[1:53:05] are under that affects every preacher
[1:53:08] and affects every little bitty child
[1:53:11] that there is something that is in you
[1:53:13] that wants to lean on the pleasures of
[1:53:16] life it's it's the anointing of the age
[1:53:19] that makes you want to ease yourself
[1:53:21] into of emotional
[1:53:25] entertainment that I've got to take care
[1:53:27] of this and it
[1:53:33] happens don't
[1:53:36] me it's amazing what is it it's the
[1:53:39] spirit of this age that's trying to get
[1:53:41] you to entertain your flesh it's trying
[1:53:44] to get you to entertain but there is
[1:53:46] something powerful about a believer that
[1:53:49] when they feel that coming on them you
[1:53:51] know what there's no way I should be
[1:53:54] more comfortable by watching something
[1:53:56] on YouTube than reading the word of God
[1:53:59] and all of a sudden you get a sword in
[1:54:02] your hand and say wait a minute devil I
[1:54:04] shouldn't be falling asleep in this
[1:54:06] sermon I should be woke
[1:54:10] [Applause]

[1:54:18] is you think you got enough oil you
[1:54:20] think you got enough eyesa so you go
[1:54:22] asleep but when the Midnight Cry comes
[1:54:25] you ran out of oil but the secret to
[1:54:28] overcoming Le osia is to get so filled
[1:54:31] with the oil that your Cup's running
[1:54:33] over that the anointing is there whether
[1:54:35] you feel it or whether you don't you

[2:01:13] you brother mcclard had put me on a book
[2:01:22] I shared with
[2:01:24] him I wanted I've been building this
[2:01:26] sermon for two two months now right at
[2:01:28] two months I started sharing with him
[2:01:31] some things and he he pointed me towards
[2:01:33] a
[2:01:36] book I always watch moments with the
[2:01:39] Lord like when he places somebody in
[2:01:43] your life at the right time amen like
[2:01:46] you come at a perfect time whether you
[2:01:48] knew it or not
[2:01:52] and I always watch when God allows
[2:01:53] relationships to be built at certain
[2:01:55] times in certain moments and I always
[2:01:58] watch when God allows a message to drop
[2:02:00] to a congregation that it that it's it's
[2:02:03] for a
[2:02:04] reason because I I I understand
[2:02:07] things uh under pastorship I understand
[2:02:10] things and all of a sudden God will just
[2:02:12] just drop something and he'll he speak
[2:02:14] it it's it's it's for this
[2:02:17] situation brother Matthew had mlar had
[2:02:20] told me he said now no go listen to this
[2:02:22] book and I tell you it's been a real
[2:02:23] blessing to me but
[2:02:26] I I told Brother William I I had the
[2:02:30] hardest time last night I wanted
[2:02:31] speaking tongues the whole entire time
[2:02:32] last
[2:02:38] night because there is no impersonation
[2:02:41] to this
[2:02:42] message there's no impersonation brother
[2:02:44] Brandon would go into the he'd go into
[2:02:46] the seals he'd go into the seals and he
[2:02:48] would go in there and he'd come on the
[2:02:49] back side of it and he preach a token he
[2:02:51] said that was that was the Capstone of
[2:02:52] his ministry was a token message and
[2:02:55] both in both Services brother Brandon
[2:02:56] said there can be no impersonation to it
[2:02:58] and he's talking he said can be no
[2:03:00] impersonation like it was in the first
[2:03:01] and the second pool he said there could
[2:03:03] be no impersonation to the third
[2:03:04] pool if you you studied out the message
[2:03:07] and there's there's nine times brother
[2:03:08] brandom says this on on my Revelation
[2:03:11] but Brother brandom start saying that in
[2:03:13] 1963 in March 1963 he starts preaching
[2:03:16] the seals he said now my Revelation on
[2:03:18] it if you study that out brother brandom
[2:03:19] is talking about that's my revelation of
[2:03:21] what the seals is that's my Revelation
[2:03:24] just it won't take you long just go go
[2:03:26] look it up in the message and type in my
[2:03:27] my Revelation it it do you heart real
[2:03:30] good won't take you very long but it's
[2:03:31] powerful because brother brandham
[2:03:33] brother brandham goes in there and every
[2:03:34] single time he says that in the first
[2:03:36] second fourth fourth seal and he comes
[2:03:38] in there and he comes in the seventh
[2:03:39] seal or question and answers on the
[2:03:40] seals and then he comes in there he
[2:03:42] comes in there in the seventh seal he
[2:03:43] said now my Revelation on the seventh
[2:03:45] seal and he goes in there if you studied
[2:03:48] out real listen real closely brother
[2:03:50] manam starts talking about his ministry
[2:03:53] in Malachi 4 he's identifying that his
[2:03:56] ministry has a portion to do with the
[2:03:59] seventh seal and he starts diving into
[2:04:02] and he says now there can be no
[2:04:03] impersonations of it because only one
[2:04:05] Ministry of Elijah can come and turn the
[2:04:07] hearts back because there was an
[2:04:08] anointing on the hour and this ministry
[2:04:10] that you have received it can be no
[2:04:12] impersonation to it there can be no
[2:04:14] impersonation he goes in 19 1963 on on
[2:04:17] September the 1st he stands there and he
[2:04:19] preaches a token he goes in there and he
[2:04:22] starts saying he said now you got to
[2:04:24] kill the lamb you've got to have the
[2:04:25] blood on your door you've got to have it
[2:04:27] he said there can be no make belief the
[2:04:30] lamb had to die there can be no
[2:04:32] impersonation of it there can be no make
[2:04:34] belief you know that it's
[2:04:36] there and there's been every kind of
[2:04:38] mimic of vultures that have tried to fly
[2:04:41] at the same height that you flew at that
[2:04:44] vulture can look like it he can study it
[2:04:47] out in the you can study it out in the
[2:04:48] sky and until you get binoculars you'll
[2:04:50] think it's an eag flying but it's a
[2:04:52] vulture and brother rham said that that
[2:04:55] vulture is Anointed to fly too but he
[2:04:57] can't fly as high as that eagle can
[2:05:00] go see there can be no mimics of this
[2:05:03] message because you are anointed to go
[2:05:07] where nobody else can
[2:05:09] go and that's why you can stand Toe to
[2:05:12] Toe with every devil that comes up in
[2:05:15] Joshua 10 and you've got a right to put
[2:05:18] your foot on its neck

[2:05:23] circle but I want to come back to that
[2:05:24] book I was talking about it's called the
[2:05:26] day of
[2:05:28] War and the wrer right this and he said
[2:05:32] the amates were so scared of entering
[2:05:35] into the Afterlife headless so David's
[2:05:39] Warriors wanted to swing with everything
[2:05:41] within them to make sure they took their

[2:05:45] their hands off they didn't want to just
[2:05:47] cut their legs off they wanted to cut
