Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God at the highest praise the Lord he loves to hear his children worship Him in spirit and in truth because little brides you know where you're standing you know right where you are you're able to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen I tell you what we've been feasting all week on what the Lord has been doing and my goodness I it just feels like the Lord is going to come at any moment doesn't it amen but I but we say let it be because that was you know the last testimony of the Bible was even so come Lord Jesus that is our hearts cry amen so certainly honored to be standing before you this evening to share the good news in this powerful message that we love and believe with all of our hearts I always certainly look forward to this time of year you know and just we all get to kind of speak to you at one time and certainly the lord always does something so special for us amen so we'll won't keep his standing if he'll turn with me to Numbers Chapter 20. verse 7. we'll begin reading don't you love the word of the Lord amen everything in life will fail our health will fell us our money will fail us our houses will fail us but he will never fail amen we'll begin reading here and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water so here we have a rock that actually has a personal pronoun he didn't say speak to the Rock and it'll give forth it's water he said speak to the Rock and he will give forth his water and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock so shalt thou give the congregation and their beasts to drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gather the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he smote the what he smote The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their Beast also also when we read First Corinthians chapter 10 and as you're flipping there we understand the prophet teaches us that when Moses struck this rock two million people plus and all of their cattle and their camels and everything they had drink this was not just a little trickle this was not like you may find in the forest somewhere here in the mountains but it was an absolute gusher that they drunk from in First Corinthians 10 verse 1 moreover Brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all of our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and we're all baptizing to Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ amen let's bow our heads the gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity that we can come we can examine ourselves in the word father we just ask that you take complete control of the service father there's one thing Lord Jesus that I ask I ask that you help me get out of the way may you speak to our hearts may you listen father through us speak through us and we'll give you the praise honor and the glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you as you're seated if I just titled just uh this briefly I would like to speak on that rock is Christ you know Moses had a lot to put up with when he was in the first Exodus there was a lot that he had to deal with he was responsible for two million people as I said and he had to trust God for the logistics of keeping these people fed and watered and happy and you know God did all of that yet they still always murmured and complained Moses was under a lot of pressure we understand that the prophet also teaches us that when Moses went to the Rock God told him to speak to the Rock there was an earlier time in their Journey where God told them to smoke to Smite it and he did it gave forth his water but this time Moses was to speak to the Rock for it to give forth his water and Moses went and he he got angry the anger got to him his temper did and he smote The Rock instead of speaking to it the scripture tells us that he smote The Rock twice so he smote it the first time and they didn't give forth water so he smote it again and brother Ram said that God that he Moses knew that he had power with God as a prophet so even though it wasn't God's perfect will that water had to come out of the Rock but you know the prophet tells us that was the only place in the scripture where the types were broken because Jesus Christ is that rock and he was only smitten once so because Moses did that he was not allowed to cross over into the promised land God had him he climbed up the mountains and Mount Pisgah I believe it was and he was able to climb up the mountain pretty good for 120 year old man isn't it he climbed up the mountain and he was able to look off in the distance and he could see that everything that God had promised them everything that he said would come to pass he could look right over and he could see it he could see the Fulfillment of God's word but he was not allowed to actually cross over because of his disobedience now it's important to understand that Moses was not allowed to physically enter into that land but Moses did enter that land because 800 six 800 years later he was seen talking to Jesus Christ Moses did not die the Paul the Bible said that it died but the Angels came and took him away and he appeared on Mount Transfiguration to Jesus and strengthening him and tell and talking to Jesus rather having a conference with God and then 3000 years later he's still in the he comes back to the promised land and he literally goes to the promised land brother Fred and he's with Elijah and he's preaching Jesus Christ to the Jews so how much better of a promised land that because Israel went over and they begin to lose land because of unbelief they ended up getting carried away to Babylon but here Moses has the opportunity to present the real promised land to the Jews all these thousands of years later that's what we're waiting on that's what the Jews are waiting on the Jews are waiting on Moses and Elijah to return to present this same message this same gospel that we believe is going to go to the Jews and Moses even though he couldn't cross it in the natural was now able then now in our day he will cross it and he'll be there in the natural but most importantly he'll be presenting it to the Jews in the spiritual it will be he will present he will he will bring his people over into the promised land which is Jesus Christ that is the real promised land is the Lord Jesus Christ so Moses will still be there God has a reason and a purpose for everything because when Moses Was preparing today remember he climbed the mountain and he seen the promised land of far off the Old Testament Saints and all the church age Saints what did the Bible tell us that they've seen that they seen the promises of God are far off but weren't able to go over they weren't able to take a Rapture like we can they weren't able to to take a body change like will be but they believed it and they seen it afar off now in The Exodus many times when we think of The Exodus we think of the pillar of fire that led them by night and we think of the pillar of the cloud that led them by day but you know there was also a rock and this rock literally followed them they say how does a rock follow people that's a paradox how does a cow eat green grass and give white milk how does a man stop the Sun how does the biggest oak tree you've ever seen start as a Little Acorn in the message of leadership the prophet said in the Bible you know there was a rock that went with Israel and when Moses got ready to die he stepped up on this rock and that rock was Jesus you remember when Jesus was talking in Saint John the sixth chapter he said well our fathers eat man in the wilderness he said your father gave my father gave you that Manna he said yeah they ate that manner that's right but they're everyone dead because they couldn't keep going on see they're everyone dead but he said I am the bread of life that came down from heaven our fathers drank from a rock Moses smote The Rock and said the waters came forth he said I am that rock that was with him and look when Moses died he stepped on that rock you know what happened the Bible said the Angels came and got him that rock was there for Moses when he when he when the the children of Israel follow the children of Israel Moses got ready to die that rock was there on the way on if they came he says into the smitten Rock notice when they come to the Rock they had need now Moses smote the rock with the rod that's where we left last night smoked the rock with the rod and the rod was God's judgment Rod he smoked the Rock and there was a cleft on the left side of The Rock when the children of Israel got hungry they went there remember Christ is that rock and the Beehive a bee had got in there and they made a hive and they got honey out of the rock everything they had need of was in The Rock The Rock followed the church and The Rock was Christ Jesus when they were thirsty they drank from The Rock when they were hungry they ate from The Rock wherever they went the rock followed them because remember it was a journey so they couldn't if if that rock was in a just in one spot and could never move they'll be tied down but the rock follow them in the Lord Jesus Christ the angels of God are with you right wherever they went the rock followed them and the Rocks still following the church Christ is the rock that was in the wilderness notice now then that same Rock all you have to do is go to the cleft of The Rock the stronger the storm get in the cleft because he's your shelter and sometimes you know you're you're in you're under shelter and it's a bad storm and your feet may still be getting wet there's a gust of wind so if the storm is getting worse get in the cleft even more get in the cleft of the rock for the shelter from your storms and God not only has a shelter from your storm he's got a little treat in there for you while you're in there and there's Honey in the Rock my brother and my sister when you're in a storm you get in the cliff and you reach up there and you need some strength for the journey you say Lord here's some Honey in the Rock but you've got to get to the rock for your honey you've got to get to the rock for your shelter you don't get in the Rock you'll get struck by the storm but that cleft came from a striking a smiting and I left a cleft in the rock and you will find the sweetness of the Lord Jesus while you're taking shelter in the cleft that's where you learn about how sweet your lord Jesus is when the storm's going on when things are going good you're believing God and you're on the mountain and there's Faith but when you've got to get into that cleft and you're hearing the storm go by that's when you're thankful for that rock that's when you're thankful for that shelter that's when you're thankful and you reach up there and you get honey and you find full satisfaction and you know that honey never goes bad do you know that honey never ever has an expiration date on it you can eat honey it preserves itself this word children of God does not expire this word never goes bad you just reach in there you're in the cleft of the Rock You Reach in there and you grab you a promise if you're sick and then he got to touch you you reach up there and you grab some healing you're down you lost a loved one or you need some comforting you reach in there and get it it's for you praise the Lord now Moses literally struck The Rock they literally drank from it you we cannot over spiritualize things you've got to understand when something is natural and you've got to understand when something is spiritual there is a that was a literal Rock Jesus Christ is literally coming he spiritually came but now he's going to literally come our souls are in a raptured condition spiritually but we're going to literally be changed we are literally going to be missing we are literally going to be caught up in the air to meet him in the clouds it will be a literal coming now there's a spiritual coming and we preach about that all the time but we're also but don't forget there's a literal coming so this rock that is Christ Jesus begins to condescend from an actual rock it then becomes prophecy and then it becomes flesh in Isaiah 20 16 therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not make haste now in the scriptures we all know who Nebuchadnezzar was he had a dream and this dream bothered him so bad when he could not get the interpretation he was ready to kill every wise man in his kingdom because they had no interpretation for the dream but there was a man that had the interpretation the spirit of God lived in a man to give him that interpretation so in Daniel chapter 2 verse 34 is as because the the dream if you remember to give them a chance to pull it up there Daniel 2 34. remember the dream even left Nebuchadnezzar he couldn't even remember what he dreamed but if he heard it he would know what he'd dreamed so that Daniel begins to tell the king exactly what he dreamed and then he begins to say in verse 34 thou sawest till a stone till that a stone was cut out without hands man had nothing to do with it which smote the image on his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces that then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smoked the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth that's the revelation of Jesus Christ because remember a stone is a revelation and it not only smote the image on the foot but it then grew and it began to fill the whole Earth this great Mountain that man had nothing to do with because remember each kingdom literally historically represented something the gold the silver the brass the thousands that went down because remember that Satan's kingdoms of the world is going from the head to the toes God builds his kingdom from the feet to the Head so as they're coming down this rock that's cut out without hands begin rolling down smites this huge image in the feet it falls just goes to dust and yet this mountain just grows and covers the whole earth have a cook 214 says in the Earth shall be filled with a knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea have you ever been to the ocean and you look and it's so far that the ocean sister Heather touches the sky it's so as far as you can see it's the ocean that's how the glory and the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the Earth we're going to that kind of kingdom aren't you tired of this world and the politics and everything that it has I'm ready to go to a kingdom I'm ready to go to that place that's where I want to go where we don't have to worry about none of this anymore no more sickness No More Tears no more crying Zechariah 4 there's another prophecy as it's coming down 4-6 then he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto the rubble saying not by power not not by might nor by power but by my spit Spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou old gray Mountain before zerubbabel thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone therefore with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it do you know that this message that you and I believe is a message of Grace that is the message of the hour that has come despite all of our mistakes and all of our Mix-Ups and everywhere where life has put us everywhere where our wrong choices have put us yet there's a double measure of Grace that is given to you and it's actually Christ it's not crying judgment it's crying Grace Grace like that woman that was caught in adultery remember the the law was crying out judgment but there withstood The Headstone himself and what did he cry Grace Grace unto her is crying great this is a message of Grace this isn't a message of Commandments and a message of do's and don'ts I can't do this and I wish I could but I can't this is freedom if this message ain't Freedom nothing is if this ain't it then nothing is The Headstone is Christ himself and the body of Christ shapes up the same Ministry and the acts of the church exactly as Jesus was because remember when The Headstone is Christ he's both Cornerstone and he's headstone he's Alpha he's Omega he's the beginning he's the end he's a root he's The Offspring so when The Headstone comes down remember have you all seen that chart that brother Ram drew the statue of a perfect man that is a type oh that is also the body of Christ as it's being built up The Headstone if you notice has got to fit the rest of the pyramid perfectly brother Ram said it was the grooves had to fit perfectly so the Capstone could not have come in the days of Luther it wouldn't have fit the the top of the pyramid without the Capstone that had been like the Capstone trying to sit on this it don't fit well as Wesley came and got a little closer as the Pentecostals came and got a little closer but now the Capstone is here the Capstone is Jesus Christ the fullness of the word I love this here he said but now as she begins to heat to the top each one of these Stones coming from Luther Methodist Pentecost then the church will have to get in such a place when the real Stone headstone comes it'll fit right joint to joint with it like I said last night in the Covenant the church will have to have the spirit of God in it so so much till that spirit will be doing the same works that Jesus Christ did here on Earth the Holy Ghost having complete control before that woman the church could ever Unite with her husband the bride grandchildren will never see that they'll say I'm Pentecostal that's all and go on it's got to be a personal experience because remember the Cornerstone and The Headstone both tie the structure together the Cornerstone will start you outright and The Headstone will tell you if you if you got it right remember you get off just a little bit by the time you end up way over there you are way off so it's got to be so perfect you know the Great Pyramid in Egypt still don't have a headstone it literally does not have a headstone and they're arguing about why they think it was stolen maybe it was this maybe it was that but we know why it doesn't have a headstone because Jesus Christ was rejected and he's the headstone now I love this here he said in the message Israel in the church and The Rock's still following the church Christ is the rock that was in the wilderness now notice that same Rock no wonder when he came into Jerusalem brother Ron read this last Sunday the scripture that he's referenced they said make him hold their peace make them hold their peace he said if they hold their peace the Rocks stones will immediately cry out the prophet said what was it the Chief Cornerstone was come rolling down among the stones something had to take place rocks were crying out what are we so excited about is because the headstone has come down and all of us Lively stones are crying out to him because he's a chief headstone he's the Chief Cornerstone beginning to end he's everything without him you have nothing with him you have everything now now this right here is something is an architectural quote they especially did this in more older engineering but it said in relation to architecture a Cornerstone is traditionally the first stone laid for a structure with all other Stones laid in reference a Cornerstone marks the geographical location by orienting a building in a specific Direction and Jesus Christ is the Chief Cornerstone and he's orienting us up first Peter 2 5. he also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house you are a spiritual house We Gather in this physical church building but you are actually the church the bride Across the Nation around the world Lively stones that is why no one can take your place when God is building a building he's got a place for you this one he's got a place for that one he's got a place for that one he don't need no tools he don't need no works of man he cuts you exactly by the spoken word you come to church and you and maybe we're getting a little loose about certain things in life and these brothers get up here and they preach the word or in the anoint you of the Holy Spirit some stuff gets shaved off they don't do that they don't do that it's the power of the spoken word where conviction happens and you go out Lord I didn't realize I was doing that forgive me help me shake me mold me make me and that God don't have sauce God don't just cut you you don't once they were building Solomon's Temple you didn't hear tools it came from all over the world and everything fitly joined together so between the alpha Cornerstone and the Omega headstone are all you Lively stones are all you Lively Stones all over the internet Romans 8 29 called him the firstborn among many brethren he's the first fruits of them that slept he's the first begotten of the Dead because remember this has this message is a headstone message not a Reformation this isn't just a movement throughout history they've been little movements little Sparks little revivals that that would like the Welsh Revival and different things genuine moves of the spirit that God would use God would put souls in the kingdom of God this is an actual this is the presentation of Jesus Christ himself to the bride this is God's love message to you this is a Rapture message when Jesus came he was speaking in type about building a house on a rock he said therefore in Matthew 7 whosoever heareth these things of mine and doeth them that's a big and right there I will liken him into a wise man which built his house upon a rock now is Jesus just storytelling and just wasting people's time he's that rock and the rain descended remember being in the cleft of The Rock and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock but you remember the foolish man built his house in sand so what is sand anything other than this anything because remember he's that rock of Revelation Iraq is the type of Revelation when he came and he asked Peter whom do men say that I the son of man am he said some say you're you're John the Baptist or rose from the dead or you're Jeremiah or you're one of the prophets and then Jesus brings it right right to him and he says but whom say ye that I am what do you say about this message some people say oh the Miracles were good oh he went off brother and went off at the at the latter end oh this that or the other what do you say about this message and whenever you get that Revelation that rock which is Christ himself in your heart to say that this is the message this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then he can build upon that and Jesus told them Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock the rock of the revelation of who he was not upon Peter but literally upon Peter's understanding of who Jesus was because the churches of the day called him the devil but here you have an ignorant fisherman who said you're certainly not a devil and you're not even one of the prophets as flattering as that may be but you're literally the Messiah you are literally the son of God and he was blessed for that the woman at the well she was thirsty and she'd come to this well every single day for water and one day The Rock was there the same Rock was waiting for her now you notice whenever she whenever whenever she came she didn't Smite him like all them people did at his crucifixion and jerked handfuls of beard out of his face she spoke to him and as she was beginning to speak to him what did it do The Rock gave forth his water she began to speak to him and the water just came out it wasn't just a trickle just to help her be a better person it was a gusher it was such a gusher that she had something to give out she ran into the City and said come see a man who's told me everything I've ever done isn't this a very Messiah she spoke to the Rock and they gave forth his water Jesus stood one day and he cried the Bible says if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink when Jesus came and he went all the way to the cross he had a he had a price to pay he had to pay for your soul and he had to pay for my soul so Jesus had to go on the cross so that he could be smitten he literally had to be smitten so when he was on the cross and he said it was finished and a Roman literally remember not spiritualizing it a Roman literally took a spear put it up to his side and sister Julia literally pushed it into his eye and he gave out the elements of the new birth at that moment he made possible the new birth Rock of Ages Cliff for me let me hide myself in the let the water and the blood from thy wounded side which flowed be of sin a double cure Grace Grace save from Wrath and make me pure and then Jesus said it is finished everything that you have need of was taken care of your healing Brother Andy was taken care of your healing brother wrong was taken care of brother Donnie every knee that was that is here represented here was taken care of so now if you need the Holy Ghost tell them what you want don't Smite him you don't have to to try so hard and be to him just tell him what you want if you need salvation tell them what you want good after his resurrection remember Thomas was there and I find it interesting in the scripture when Thomas said except I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger in the print of his nails Jesus was not there but Jesus still hurt him because when Jesus appeared to him he said Thomas and Jesus wasn't there but he heard his very words and then Thomas believed closing I want to say this speak to the Rock he has everything that we have need of he's your shelter he's your food he's your protection he is literally everything that you have need of if you're staying out want to read it from The Book of Psalms and go through several several verses here in Psalm 18 verse 1 I will love thee O Lord my strength the Lord is my rock in my Fortress my deliverer my God my strength in him will I trust my buckler in the Horn of my salvation in my high tower Psalm 18 31 for who is God save the Lord or who is a rock Save Our God Psalm 1846 the Lord liveth and blessed be my rock can you say he's my rock and let the god of my salvation be exalted make it personal Psalm 27 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me remember that cleft of the Rock in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock in Psalm 42 he had brought me up also out of an horrible pit and out of the Maori clay and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings Psalm 61 from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed what beautiful words when your heart is overwhelmed and you literally don't even have the words to pray then lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy Psalm 62 2 he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved Psalm 71 3 be thou my strong habitation where unto you I may continue to Resort thou has given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my Fortress Psalm 95 1. let's say all this together I'll give him a chance to pull it up Psalm 95 1. aren't you thankful for the rock of your salvation when your heart is overwhelmed you can go into the cleft of The Rock and have and taste and see that the Lord is good his mercy endureth forever everything you have need of children of God is in him aren't you thankful for that rock that rock of salvation he set your feet Upon

that is exactly is exactly what we have seen in this generation is The Rock has come down and that is Revelations 10 and it is exactly what William Branham was laying there in bed when he was considering and laying have I ever done anything in life have I've done anything remember what he said you'll remember if you'll go studying out in 1962 when he preaches to us serves is this a sign of the end he said my Bible was open to Romans chapter 9 and verse 33 behold I lay in Zion a stumbling song that whosoever believeth on him shall never be ashamed and I think it's pretty profound that the angel had the whole you can lay out your whole entire Bible and there's there's thousands maybe maybe not thousands but a couple hundred scriptures that are laying there but this this Bible was opened up to Romans 9 33. it was a statement to the Church of the Living God I am laying this message right in front of you and whosoever believe it shall not be ashamed I certainly appreciated that brother William we we certainly we certainly really appreciated that very much very much we before we go forward tonight we we always enjoy these these type of services that we have around New Year's and we were unable to have it last weekend due to all of the business of things of ordination of deacons and and things of that nature and communion and why didn't we have a time last weekend I I I've had a hard time getting over it all week long physically and spiritually and I don't think I'll ever get over it spiritually and and uh just I tell you I've never I've been in some very special spots and I think that something that we're very acquainted with is the presence of the Lord and the names of the Lord slipping by but I I personally have never been a part of anything quite like what went on here last weekend and I've never heard so many voices uh speaking in tongues all at the same time and it was just I believe that this is the final sweep of the Holy Ghost and and um just want to make this mention I'm going to ask sister Whitney if she'll come help me sing a song and I got a purpose in singing this song tonight hopefully hopefully I can take my 25 minutes and get to the point that I want to but uh if not I got y'all next weekend or the weekend after that so uh but we want to be remembering sister Erica Parker that I believe it's this coming week that she'll be going to take her next treatment and so we just want to be remembering that and and uh I believe the Lord's getting ready to do something very special and uh singing song The Blessing sister Whitney probably shouldn't say this before he was saying I'm going to uh you'll understand if I say it I may not get it back together up here but um I believe there's I believe there's prophecy I standing before us tonight amen and it's you and I believe that I believe that they are his power I believe there's power in our words and uh two years ago two years ago I had a very special night with my family and uh I'll just say the angel of the Lord got in the car and uh he uh he spoke something uh sister Whitney I said never been drunk in your life but you're going to experience it it took two years for that to come to fruition but last weekend we carried sister weekend sister Whitney me and brother Davey carried her in she was so drunk on the Holy Ghost I believe that God is here and I believe that if you have a desire for anything tonight I know he'll meet your need he knows why you come here tonight and he's blessed us abundantly key of E sister Casey y'all help us sing it to love [Music] the Lord bless you and keep you oh make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you the Lord's turn is based toward you and give give me [Music] one [Music] man [Music] oh [Music] man [Music] the Lord

hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Merry Christmas [Music] Hallelujah I was asked to send this quote to somebody today my brother Bynum said when he was preaching in 1961 he was preaching the revelation of chat uh The Book of Revelations chapter 4 chapter 5. and he got to going down through there he said when those seals are released he said everything must be worshiped then you are standing in the greatest hour that you've ever been standing in the book is open the seals have been released it's worship it's a Time To Worship it's a time to praise the word has been revealed and we're the ones that do it Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah [Music] thank you [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah this is the Lord's daughter behold I lay inside our stumbling Stone many of us stumbled at this storm many have stumbled at this message but whosoever believeth in him shall never the president's on your case whether the boss is on your case where Satan is on your case it doesn't matter shall never be ashamed I'm not ashamed of this rock I'm not ashamed of this message [Music] Hallelujah [Music] well I won't take much longer but I do want to say something so if you have your Bibles and I know I know it's hard to gather yourself but this is this is about worship and it's about sacrifice and that's the greatest thing in worship is knowing how to sacrifice completely giving myself over that's what makes it worship because anybody can praise when they got shoes on their feet anybody can praise when they got bread on their table but worship is when you ain't got no shoes worship is when you ain't got no bread worship is when you ain't got no money worship is the heart of the father Matthew chapter 3 and verse 15 and God does all things well Matthew chapter 3 and verse 15 and just one just one scripture for this evening and we're going to have some baptisms tonight after after the service and I know that we're not accustomed to holding you too long but it seems like the Lord keeps rolling the time back on us a little bit so I hope that's okay this is my highlight of the week so not me preaching but being in church I'm not that carnal Matthew chapter 3 and verse 15 and Jesus answering said unto them suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him may God bless his word he may be seated tonight and before we before we go on I'd like to pray as a congregation for sister Erica Parker as she goes forward brother Ron has test this coming week in the next coming week so we'll just I know you're already seated but let's just go to him in prayer father we come to you tonight Lord Jesus Lord bearing Lord all of these things upon our hearts Lord and they are Lord very burdensome to us Lord Jesus to see that your children Lord have been afflicted by the enemy father but Lord we know that you are high and that you are lifted up above every disease above every above every Cancer say oh Lord that could be in the body father and Lord we want to give you praise and adoration Lord for you are truly do of it father and Lord we had a prophet stand in this generation when he was speaking to an angel in the cave and he asked him he said he told him he said nothing would stand in front of his prayer and William Branham spoke these words he said not even cancer and the angel spoke back not even cancer now father We Believe Lord that where we're setting at that we are under the very spoken word the very opening of the word and we recognize that there is Authority in this body that is gathered here tonight but Lord there's a body of Believers all around the world that is calling upon the name of Jesus Christ for sister Erica father for brother Ron and the many others Lord that we could go on and mention father but these are the names that are presented to us tonight and Lord we would ask father that your Holy Spirit would arrest every Cancer cell father that Lord you would allow the Holy Spirit to work the works that you manifested there at Calvary to be manifested in their bodies father now Lord as we prepare ourselves to give over just for a few moments in Time Lord I pray that you would speak to us through thy Living Word In The Name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen amen I'd like to just speak to you just just from a thought on the elements the elements are ready the elements are ready and brother Brandon brother Brandon praise this in his prayer when he begins to break into the greatest the greatest series of messages that that he's going to bring forth throughout his ministry and he goes and there in 1963 in March of 1963 he holds a meeting and he begins to he begins to do exactly what the angel told him to do is go back to Jeffersonville and preach the revelation of the Seven Seals but when brother Branham comes down to the seventh seal you remember that that brother Branham thought that he had said too much about it that he went back and re-recorded something something the very next day because he thought he had said too much but we have we have both copies as as we're listening to the seven seal you were hearing exactly like William Branham preached it to us but here brother Brandon when he when he's getting ready to break into the Rapture the Rapture seal and he goes in there and brother Brandon praise this prayer he said we can see the elements already are ready to bring the church into the presence of Christ he said we can see the bride taking on form and putting on the wedding garment making ready he said we can see the elements ready to bring the church into the presence of God and you know that William Branham was more than just a prophet but he was a prophet messenger but he wasn't just looking with him with a prophetic gift but he was looking through the eyes of the seventh angel as his operating there and he's watching all of the elements as all of the attributes that God has dispersed throughout the generation as they're coming into play that all of the elements already ready to think that tonight that that you are a part of those elements and to think that tonight that all the elements are ready to bring the church into the presence of Christ what the the brother or excuse me the Bible says here in Zechariah 4 and 10 that that who hath despised the day of small things and we recognize that that God always does extra extraordinary things with what we would say is ordinary stuff you see just think about what he's made out of dirt look at you you think well how amazing that our bodies are that God made us out of the very elements of this Earth that all of us are made of 16 different elements to think that that God took what would say we would say ordinary dirt and he would make human beings out of it and the Bible tells us that he makes everything out of nothing and we recognize that with God that nothing is impossible you think that tonight that God would take what we would say is ordinary and he would make it extraordinary you see because in the hands of God when he blesses something or puts his blessing upon it you see you're not just dealing with Mortal man but you are dealing with the almighty all-powerful God that has all things in his control you think about a little boy a little boy that skipped lunch one time and he took well Jesus took that that little lunch and he fed five thousand with it you see in little as much if God is in it you see you see God knows how to take a sling and he knows how to kill a giant with it you know you recognize that here tonight I have in my possession I have a rock I think that's pretty neat I have a rock in my possession tonight that that it isn't just an ordinary Rock but this rock is a very special rock this rock came from David's Brook as we would say it came out of the rock that day out of the brook where David would walk down into the valley of Eli that he walked down in there he walked down in there and he grabbed at five smooth stones and he picked up an ordinary Rock but it was more than just an ordinary Rock but if we could let a rock testify for a moment tonight if we could let a rock testify just for a moment tonight I'd say that this rock could testify that I was there on that day when David walked down into that Valley and I watched David come down into that Valley like he was just another 14 year old boy but I watched him when he walked into that Valley he had the courage he had the courage greater than Goliath to think that tonight that that this rock if we can let it just speak to us just for a moment that he could testify I have been waiting for a moment like this all them days of my life ever since I was created I was waiting for the moment that somebody would pick me up and I could sling my little My Little Life and I could go and be known as a giant killer to think that a little video rock and these aren't just ordinary rocks but if you go to studying out the Bible that these are the rocks that God rained down over in the Book of Joshua that God ran down hailstones out of hell elephant and he destroyed the enemy right there these aren't just ordinary rocks these are rocks from another world and the rock of Revelation that's been presented to you tonight is a supernatural Rock it'll slay every time it'll kill every Cancer cell it'll kill every depression this rock is not an ordinary Rock it's the rock of testimony it's a rock to a fence of somebody but this is a rock that'll destroy every devil [Applause] this ain't just your ordinary message but this is a message for a rapture to think that God was forming all of the elements of these little ordinary rocks as we would say that God was creating and God was forming but you see most people never reach their full potential in life simply because they overlooked the potential of the ordinary you see if you simply start where you are instead of waiting to start until you get to where you hope to go you will never you will become all that you ever hope and everything that you ever dreamed if you'll start where you are instead of waiting for somebody else to put you into a position to get you to a spot there's a lot of people that want to be uh they want to be a supervisor but they never want to clean out the stars or they never want to work their way through the janitor position you got to start somewhere and you might be the lowest man on a totem pole you might be the weakest Christian in this building tonight but I want you to know you're not just an ordinary person because a prophet spoke to you and said the weakest of Christians shakes hell I say tonight if we be weak let's shake hell but if we be strong let's cause an earthquake down in hell so never Overlook the potential of the ordinary brother man brother random when he would begin to refer when he begin to refer when Jesus would walk past one person but he heals the Nets he said all of it was done by the will of the Lord and Jesus would stand there and he said now I'm not the Healer but I I am here he said I can do nothing except my father for shows me those things and not none of those things would be to question meaning you've got a reading over in the Book of John chapter 5 that when Jesus walks over there he walks into a hospital room and there's hundreds that are laying there waiting for their opportunity to step into the water but Jesus walks in there and gets a man that's had an infirmity in his life for 38 years he wasn't going to die of that infirmity but he had something that was calling to the father to come by his way but notice brother Madam said there's three elements that people dwell in the first one is humanistic he said we down here he said well I'll pray for that one and he said I'm hoping that now they'll get well he said but the second element is divine revelation he said that's when something down in your heart anchors it and it says it's going to happen he said something is going to happen he said but third the third element is the vision he said or the word of the Lord made manifest and he said when you see it it's thus say of the Lord and to think that where you're living at no man has ever lived here no man has ever possessed the realm that you're living in because you are living at the vision of the Holy Ghost and to think that you're living as the Church of the Living God you're living out the save the Lord you're speaking out the saith the Lord you see what this message does this message is calling you to come up a little bit higher this message is pulling you into another realm it is the element this message is the element that will take this body into a Rapture change we we recognize and I forgive me I I'm too nervous I'm too nervous up here tonight because what could happen but we recognize that when Jesus is having and when Jesus is and in our scripture reading that Jesus when he's there and he's coming into it and we recognize when you go to reading over in Matthew chapter 3 that John is up there and he's preaching repentance unto them and he's preaching the repentance or remissions of sins and he's up there telling them he said now he said I'm baptizing you with water he said but ah there's one that is coming after me that is greater than myself he said you see now I'm baptizing you with water but the one that is coming after me is mightier than me and he's going to baptize you with a fire and the Holy Ghost and when John began to speak those words there the Lamb of God was seen standing on the banks of the Jordan River and John turned around and prophesied that there was the Lamb of God and to think that this was exactly what was laying in the scriptures that was foretold in Malachi chapter 3 that behold I send my messenger before my face now look at the elements that are coming into play John was there Jesus was there and Jesus is saying it is becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness now to think now Jesus Jesus is is the perfect one but Jesus recognized recognizes that he has got to be washed before before he goes to Calvary just like every sacrifice has got to be washed before it can go before the father and that's the problem with too many people's worship is they've never watched themselves by the watering of the word so they can never bring a clean worship to God so they'll bring a half-hearted worship or they'll bring a half-hearted desire or a half-hearted prayer life and they'll never see the fruition of a manifestation of what God Said would be and they'll turn around and blame God but I'll say this by the word of the Lord that the elements are ready to take this bride higher than you've ever been before I'm just talking about your faith but I'm talking about another dimension there is a word in this generation that'll take you to another world now William Branham said that if we we have enough faith and we have the ability to go out there and speak a new world and walk out into it to think that you have the ability but God's got a law that won't allow you to do that because God's got to have an overcomer that lives out this generation but to think that tonight you have the elements in your mind in your life in your body to speak a new world Hallelujah let me keep building here just for a moment we recognize that before a seed can fall into the ground that the ground has got to be ready to receive what God has breast predestinated it to be just like when God was there in the very beginning he spoke the word he thought the word he spoke the word and we saw the manifestation of the word we recognize that by the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth so God believed his own world and he rode worlds off of his fingertips and what was he doing he was giving us insight into the mind of God and we recognize we recognize that there Adam was in spirit realm he was there in spirit realm but God didn't have a man on the earth that could kill the ground so God caused a deep sleep to call to to fall excuse me he created man Out of the Dust of the earth and their man began to till the ground is that all right now to think that God's been working on his creation for six thousand years for six days he's been working on his creation he's been watching as he said let there be and molecules came into existence he spoke it and he could have rolled out there a million years and then it got to its little spot and then God stopped it where it needed to be and for six thousand years as God is creating as God is creating an earth they are Adam's Body is laying in the dust of the Earth but when God got to a spot that he needed a flesh man to till the ground there which God had spoke over 6 000 years ago Adam's Body had been laying in the ground to think that he grabbed the potass and he grabbed the calcium and he grabbed this element and he brought it together and he formed his creative Son by the name of Adam and to think that God took what he spoke and made it come into existence and to think that the world has rejected you and hated you all of your life but you are exactly what God has been looking for brother Branham said that he bred this one to that one and read this one to that one until he got exactly what he wanted it's like a man building times he adds in so much brass so much steel and so much horror until he gets the right ring or the right tone as it's coming forth and there is a music on the inside of the Bride of Jesus Christ that has got to ring out it's guttering out I ain't got enough time to preach all that's on my heart tonight but do you recognize that William William Branham is standing there in the message Shalom he said what was it he said it was the drug it was the beating of the drums that was taking place he said when I went back there on the back side of that desert and he said those angels met me and told me to go back and preach those Seven Seals he said what was it he said it rang out in the sky Shalom now what was that it was peace to the Church of the Living God and to think he said it was the beating of the drums he said it was a sympathy it was a changing of the part let me tell you methodists they fulfilled their position Luther fell fulfilled his position but it is behooving unto us that we fulfill our position let me tell you William Branham ran his race and he ran it well but it's our turn to run coming to us that we take this mystery we take these revealed Mysteries [Applause] vertical you imagine how the father felt that he takes these elements and he breathes out Adam and he breathes into him the very Breath of Life can you imagine how God felt to watch it that this one is made in my own image to carry out the duties on this Earth that I am asking him to do can you imagine how he felt as a father brother Brandon said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said he loved fatherhood so much that he became a father can you imagine how much God feels tonight you can go all the way back to the Garden of Eden and think tonight brother Jason that God has the same feeling over you as he does over that back there all the way some 6 000 years ago that he had back there that there I created the very first one but here is the manifestation of the sons of God again coming into fruition and to think you're not like Adam and you're not like Eve because the first Adam and the first Eve fail but you will never fail because a prophet said that you've been predestinated not to fall you are standing on thus saith the Lord out of the elements of spoken word as the has this come into position when Noah when Noah come to his spot and he began to preach that it's going to rain that Noah got up there that God had already provided a way for Noah and he got up there he's sitting there he said now he said there wasn't no rain Affair he said but Noah began to preach that it's going to rain and by the preaching of the word the elements of rain come into the heavens now God is going to have somebody believe him God's going to have somebody take him out his word whether somebody tells you you can do it or whether somebody criticizes you and tell you that it's never going to rain you're never going to get out of laodicea but Noah believe what God said no matter the critics of 120 years saying it ain't gonna rain but he kept preaching it's going to rain I'll tell you Noah preached so much he preached it's going to rain so much that it rained 40 days and 40 nights I'll tell you if we turn ourselves loose to preaching healing and the bridge Miracles and the preach thus say of the Lord you'll see a manifestation of the reign of the Holy Ghost in This Place I'll tell you what it is it's the latter rain it's the Holy Ghost Reign it's a manifestation of the hour that we're living in [Applause] now you believe in healing because you've heard somebody tell you of healing so how can you hear without a preacher and how can they preach unless they be sent now to think that tonight because you believe in healing somebody was sent so that you could hear about healing there's a need in your body so he sends a preacher by your way to preach it's Isaiah 53 for you and he preaches it in such a way that you believe that no matter what else anybody else says it's going to happen or not you believe it's going to happen now you've got needs in your body so God sends Somebody by there because you have a need so he preaches he sends an evangelist that believes in Divine Healing or he preaches or he preaches on deliverance from chains of sigmix sigmas and and sickness and complexes and those things because you have a need in your life God has it's a deep call to the Deep church and to think that tonight the reason why you believe in miracles is because you've heard of Miracles if you've never heard of them you'd have never believed in them and that's why too many people sit back there and there are afraid to believe in the impossible because they never heard of it but Hallelujah I'll be one of those preachers that'll stand here and say we still have Miracles with an angry shouts in Miracles we are seeing Miracles the reason why people don't have the Holy Ghost in their church anymore is because they don't preach the Holy Ghost the reason why they don't have demonstration They Don't Preach demonstration the reason why they don't have speaking in tongues because they don't speak it and preach it but this is a message of restoration and there is a body on Earth that believes the saith the Lord I'll say this the elements are ready to take this body into another world [Applause] when brother Adam comes and he preaches perfect faith he said faith it's a substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen he said faith is a real thing if you ain't listening to a while go and listen to it he'll do you hit it to you great it'll build your face up but he said he said you find a man that's living in that kind of Faith he said he is he is so isolated to the rest of the world he said you find a man like that he said they're getting in Broad material and they're getting in Rapture and condition and to think that you are exactly what William Branham said would come to pass in the seventh seal that the elements are ready to bring the church into the presence of the Living God now I have to tell you I enjoy shouting I enjoy speaking in tongues I enjoy dancing here I enjoy worshiping the Lord here I enjoy watching prodigals come back home but there is nothing that can take it away from my heart to see the rapture I'ma tell you what if there's going to be one thing that we're going to preach in 2023 it's our Rapture it's not for a day gone by you are Hallelujah you are the people of the Rapture there's not another generation coming it is the save the Lord [Applause] you imagine what it's going to be like urine Rapture and condition brother Timmy you're in bright material little bride but can you imagine when reality sets in that it's more than a dream and it's more than just happening in the middle of the night a while back brother Jeffrey watched his daddy come into the room stand right there in the corner and watched him it's going to be one of these days he ain't gonna leave us but he's going to pull us up what was it it is this message that is pulling us into the realm of a higher calling let me tell you I'm not against any church and not I'm not against any any of these denominations I'm against the system but I am against the people but I'll tell you that what they've got can never take this ego off the ground but what William Branham brought to this generation will take this body and change her every molecule to think that all of her hair that's been lost throughout the ages is going to come back on her head all of those people that have false teeth all of a sudden things will start happening why not the elements are ready [Applause] [Music] and Satan's going to do everything he do to try to stop you from getting to this rapture but he don't have enough to stop you he can throw every tactic he can throw every weapon he can throw every idea every carnal impersonation every carnal intellectual idea at the pride of Jesus Christ and she will not be stopped from making it into the Rapture let me tell you she's going to be there I was sold by a prophet I was sold by Jesus Christ I'm going to be there laughs I'm gonna be there because a Rapture is already in me the elements are ready it's a powerful thing when I think about you think about what has went on and we could there's no way I started a book this past year on the supernatural events of what's happened and I ain't been able to keep up I literally cannot keep up with all the supernatural things I ordered this I ordered this notebook and I began to write those things down and the person that made the book for me said I can't wait to hear that that sounds like an interesting thing they'll probably never see it I'll never be able to write down all the things that I've seen sister Stephanie let me tell you brother Brandon said when he was out there he said it was happening so fast that he couldn't keep up with I think that that when Jesus was hanging on the cross prophecy after prophecy after prophecy was being fulfilled it's going to be like that that one of these mornings between the hours of six and nine things are going to be happening so fast to you that you won't be able to keep up with I think about what's happened this past year and there there's Miracles all in this room and if you ain't if you ain't heard of a miracle or you ain't seen a miracle talk to somebody in this room foreign that was here last weekend talk to somebody this week and hear about the Miracles that they have had happened in their life what is it it's the supernatural [Music] probably I um I'm past my time already but I'm going to tell you one more thing we're not just ordinary people but one of the greatest events that ever happened to me in my life and I there's no way I can write it down because the Vivid the vivid memory of it is too great but to think about to think about what the Lord has done for my little family my little family I could go on and on on this front this front row of the Miracles but to think of that God had something pre-planned in his mind you've heard me tell it before maybe just once but I was there at a camp and the Lord spoke to my wife and told her you're going to experience the Lord in a higher way or a greater way is that is that how it spoke something along those lines you're going to experience the Lord in a higher level now the reason why I'm married Katie is because she had the Holy Ghost I watched her get it you ever seen somebody born you ever seen somebody come to life you never forget it I'd say brother Reuben can testify to these things to watch somebody the elements of the body come together in all of these events but I don't watch sister Katie I watched around all her I watched her all my life and I think about when I was first married I didn't have the Holy Ghost I don't advise that but I got I was a man that needed the Holy Ghost but I got so mad at times because she prayed so long oh man I got to go to sleep sometime I could get up and work in the morning you think man what a devil I was but I had I had a need of what she had in her life I watched I watched her I watched how the Lord it would work through her and and just help that she would pray and how she could bring the presence of the Lord down I finally got what she had I got it too late in my mind or a lot of people's minds foreign there I watched the fruition of what God had spoke going to pass at our Labor Day this past year when brother Tim Pruitt preached on investigating angels that an angel has come and investigated our faith and the angel Lord got in the car with us at something about when you get him in a car something's going to happen he'll drive for you too and presence of the Lord got so so strong in the car and I said Lord if you can just get me home if you can just get me home I sure would appreciate it I got to the house where we got to the end of the driveway we got to the end of the driveway I jumped out of the car began speaking in tongues and all of a sudden the presence of the Lord Katie was just sitting there praying in the car praying and I hope I'm not taking up your time but I'm telling you I'm telling you that this is happening it's happening every it's happening every weekend it's happening every moment there's somebody that is calling out for a deeper sincerity a deeper calling and I'll take whatever he has need for me to have in this life if the elements are ready I want to be exactly where he wants me to be I got up as a spirit of the Lord instructed me and I spoke to Sister Katie this is it she busted out that car she busted out that car speaking in tongues dancing rolling around on the ground underneath an oak tree and brother Tim Pruitt had preached on Melchizedek coming and setting underneath the oak tree that night now I I've said that not just to draw attention to my family or to Sister Katie but I want to tell you what you are experiencing this is it now I don't believe you got to speak in tongues to have the Holy Ghost but I believe that you can and I believe that you will at some point in your life be able to speak in another tongue now I don't I don't believe that that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and I don't want you getting that picture whatsoever from my preaching but I want you to gather from this that there has been a restoration of the gifts back into the Church of the Living God and I what I what I what I'm here I believe that God has set us at a place in time that we ought to be able to preach that all of the elements are back to the Church of the Living God I believe that Visions are back in the church I believe that tongues are back in the church I believe what William Branham said was the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to be able to say Amen to every word of God that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to be able to say Amen to this message Amen to all of the things that the Lord has in store for us I'd say that we stop putting the elements of up on the Shelf somewhere and we pull the elements down and let it pull us back into the presence of the most high God you won't stop the move of God Satan can do everything he wants to us but he won't stop it you know where it was you know there was a there was a big Corporation one time that said that they were going to they were buying up all these properties because they were putting their big they were putting their big uh their big Corporation their big Market at this certain place and they were buying up all the properties in this place but there was one guy that wouldn't sell out and he had this little bitty old building right right in the middle of where they were going to be building at and they were bound and determined that they were going to get that guy to completely get out of there because they wanted that spot and he said I'm not selling out he said I built this from my hands up he said I built it all the way up he said it's mine my daddy worked for this he said I've worked for this he said I'm not selling out because because you want it he said well we're going to force you to get out of it and they built this big corporation on every side of this side they built it so much higher they said they built it so high and they build it 500 yards that way they put this side of the building for on the other side of his property and they built it 500 yards that way he said we're going to put you out of business and they put up there they put up there they put up their grand opening and they're doing their best to shut this guy out of business they're trying to trying to make him sell out and that's what Satan has tried to do to a lot of people he's trying to get them to sell out but you see this man had a different idea he wasn't going to sell out they had built all kinds of things around him but on the opening day he put a sign on his door main entrance so the enemy can build all kinds of things around you but this is the main entrance this message is the main entrance into the portals of Glory somebody giving Praise In The House of God the elements are ready so let's go let's go you want to
