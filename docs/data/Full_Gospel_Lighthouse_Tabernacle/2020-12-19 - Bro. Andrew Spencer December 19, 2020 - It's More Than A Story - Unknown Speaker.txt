amen what a mighty god that we serve to be standing in this hour and to still see god amongst us we're a blessed people when a lot of the world today doesn't know about god and half of the i forget the statistic what what people don't even know the name of jesus but to say that we realize and understand the power of the name of jesus there's 7.6 billion people in the world and 31 percent of the world is christian i'm thankful to be a christian in this day i'm thankful to stand for jesus we're certainly uh certainly excited about the things of this of this season of the christmas season and and the things that we have transpiring in front of us and we're thankful we're very very thankful we're moving into the christmas eves and then it's and it's more than a day to us it's more than flowers it's more than a tree it's more than lights this is about jesus and i think as a congregation this this past year i believe we've been given more than more than we could ever ask for we've seen miracles we've seen jesus he's a miracle-working god to have jason smith sitting in the house of god that's a miracle [Music] we love him he's been he's been a part of our services and supporting these supporting the church here and we would just like to welcome you tomorrow we're having a dinner at 3 30 at traditions in harrisonburg and we'd love to have you if you can make it tomorrow after church so there'll be a little bit of gap between service tomorrow for the people our sunday group and so there'll be a little bit of gap there that'll give all of us adequate time to be able to get there and for them to clean and sanitize everything and and so we'll we'll meet you at traditions at 3 30 so you just kind of write that down and and we thank you for being a part of this church and being a part of of what god is doing here we couldn't do it without you and we're just we definitely couldn't do it without him and we don't want to take the things that we're seeing for granted and god's doing some very special things very special things and only time will tell amen god bless you this evening let's sing let's stand and let's sing that song emmanuel god with us amen who are we that you be mindful of us what do you see that's worth looking our way we are free in ways that we never should be [Music] [Music] straining from the weight my heart no longer singing all that is within me christ for your lord with us in my heart sings a brand new song the deadest way these chains are gone emanuel god with love lord you know our hearts don't deserve your glory but still your show [Music] my heart no longer can keep from singing oh that is within me christ for you will love me glorify my heart sings a brand the new is made the shades are gone amen you will god with us for such a tiny offering compared to calvary but nevertheless we laid at your feet and such a tiny offering compared to calvary [Music] and all that is christ for you alone be glorified with us hallelujah can you say god's with me god's with us but any of the back guard above us it ain't even about god above god with us it's about god in us amen why don't we just receive him just now offering our lives to him our soul to him let's just pour out our lives to him at this moment and ask that we would receive the greatest gift there is himself father we love you with all of our hearts there's not a word there's not a there's not a word in the dictionary that would describe how we feel and how our hearts they they begin to burst and to begin to express the the greatness of god and how much we as your children want to pour out our gratitude to you lord as i sit here lord before your children lord and i watch them as they worship i watch them as they praise you father lord it makes me so happy to see that your children just want to they want to touch you with their praise they want to they want to bless you father when they begin to go out into another realm of praise and adoration to the great i am lord i can imagine how that makes you feel this evening lord to receive their worship and receive their praise unto you father i pray now that you would just begin to unwrap yourself to them father and unveil the great masterpiece of god that they would see jesus christ face to face now father i pray that you'd bless your children far and near lord you see every person that sitting here and every need that has been lifted up to you we present that to you just now and we ask god do you be mindful of the small things lord the bible says in zechariah chapter 4 who has despised the day of small things lord i'd say that if you come and do just one little maybe insignificant thing to somebody it's not too small it's nothing too small and when you come father it's not just a small thing you make you make small things great you make the ordinary extraordinary and you make the natural supernatural father in this service may be more than preacher may it be more than worshipers maybe more than hearers father maybe jesus [Music] dedicate our lives to you father in jesus name amen amen amen if you have your bibles this evening i'd like to turn over to matthew chapter 1 and verse 18. hey man i'd like to uh i'd like to speak to you just kind of something that's transpired while we were speaking last weekend on the power of your story and truly i i don't think that time would time would definitely evade us to hear everybody's story here but uh and there's some stories that don't need to be told in public but and but we're here our story has led us to him but i'd like to i'd like to speak to you tonight on on more than a story it's just more than a story and i i believe it you'll catch my my vision as we move forward but christmas is more than just a story matthew chapter 1 and verse 18 now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things and notice those words the prophet would catch that and say that's when he comes to us is when we think on those things when thinking about him that's when he comes to us and we hold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thou wife for that which is conceived in hers of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth the son and thou shall call his name jesus he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus may god bless you you may be seated this evening in the presence of the lord also luke chapter 2 and verse 7 and the bible says and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end i'd say that there's plenty of room here for him tonight a story is is something that we're all very acquainted with especially as little children were very acquainted with with stories and it's a narrative of a true of a either a true or a fictitious fact and a lot of times we especially especially if you live close to grottos truth is sometimes stranger than fiction and there's there's certain people that you meet that that you hear their story and you think can that really be true can the things that they're saying is is there is there some grounds that can be backed up by the things that they're saying and in this christmas season there are there are many stories that are being told and and there's many parents that are gathering their children and their and they're beginning to tell them of stories of of sugar plum fairies and they're they're they're pointing out different things throughout the world and there's people all around the world even in china and it's not just in the us but they're beginning to tell a story about about an overweight man and he's he's got a big belly and he's and he's and he's jolly about life he's got a beard that will tickle you if you get close to him and and there's a mat this man as he as he morphs into this into this man that can be around the world in a matter of seconds people are telling their children about this man that gets into a red suit that lives far above where anybody in the world would ever want to live and up there he lives in the north pole and they begin to tell this story to their children from a little bitty age as they they begin to tell them about santa claus and they begin to tell and and they begin to build the story of santa claus as it goes on that that santa claus lives in the north pole where nobody else can see him and they're building the story all the time and they're telling their children that he lives up in the north pole and he's he's got a bunch of children there in the north pole with overgrown ears working in a sweatshop and they're building toys all year long and they're they're making these toys and they're they're they're building things before apple can come out with them they're building things before before toys r us can come out with them they're they're building all of these things and parents are building the hype and they're beginning to tell a story about a man that is a very fictitious man but yet if you would see a child if you would see a child and they've been told that story about santa claus they would believe that he's real and their parents are due to this and they're building up a hype about a man that drinks coca-cola and he likes cookies and he likes milk and he likes almost everything that i like as well and they're building up the hype and they're beginning to tell they're beginning to tell this story about a man that's that that at midnight on christmas eve as it begins to roll over santa gets his santa claus suit on he gets everything in order he gets his sleigh out and he packs his slave with all of these toys and he gets his reindeer he gets comet and cupid and donner and vincent and he gets all of them in line and if it's a really cloudy night they get rudolph out and they put him right in line and they begin parents begin to tell this story about a man that's sneaking down your chimney why do we tell a story about a breaking and entering happily about it but we begin to tell the story about how he slips into your house and he begins he's got his red suit on and he casts the power of magic to slip down a chimney and come in there and walk around where you wouldn't let nobody else walk around and he begins to put out presents and he puts out all the things that you asked for by a class you wrote it down in a letter i can tell you one thing i am definitely not going to let some fictitious man get the credit for me working for my children's toys for my children's gifts and if somebody would tell a little child santa claus isn't real the parent would cover up the story and they would say well they just don't believe in the christmas magic and they begin to tell as as santa claus is getting close and everything is getting ready and the parents begin to tell the story and build up the story and maybe the night before christmas they'll read it was the night before christmas when all through the house not a creature was touring not even a mouse the stockings were hung by the chimney with care and hopes that saint nicholas would soon be there and all of this is just a story all of this is just made up in the imagination of mankind where they built up where saint nicholas was a man that went around and did about good but could i tell you about another night before christmas about a god that's real about a god that wants to enter not just your house but he wants to enter your heart he don't want to just enter your heart he wants into your mind he wants to come into your life and because of a christmas 2000 years ago you're sitting here and you can have christmas not just on the 25th day of december but you can have christmas every single day of your life he don't want to be just born in a manger he wants to be born in your heart he don't want to be just born in hay he wants to be born in your life so let me tell you about another night before christmas it was the night before christmas and all through the land people were traveling to their homeland the ends were full of travelers you know and a young couple was searching for some place to go she was heavy with child and found permission to rest in a small stable not considered the best it had a manger in hay and not much more just a few animals and a dirt floor in the same country abiding in the field shepherds were tending their sheep as they will the stars up above were shining up high one in particular was lighting the sky all of a sudden there appeared in the sky the angel of god with a message from on high the angel pronounced don't be afraid i bring you good tidings for all people today a savior is born to you this day which is christ the lord he had to say in the city of david wrapped in old clothes lying in a manger is the sign you should know and all of a sudden there was a singing in the air a multitude of angels singing with care glory to god in the highest and on earth peace and good will towards men and when they were gone the shepherds agreed that they would travel to bethlehem immediately and when they arrived they found the sign mary joseph and the baby he was lying in the manger just as the angel proclaimed they told their parents that they were told of this holy child that she now holds and mary was thinking of the things that they had said then they returned and they bowed their heads they praised and they prayed and glorified him for all the things that the angels had said and eight days later when it was time the small child jesus was named remember the star that lighted the sky the special night the angels came by from even that time from really afar they'd been three kings that been following that star it taken much time to follow the star but they but they rejoice with great joy when they saw what they saw a mother named mary with a child that they saw they fell to the floor and worshiped with all they brought him gifts of myrrh and frankincense of gold very pricey items i am told over 2 000 years have passed since then when jesus was a child born not of sin he came and he lived and he died for us god almighty he really loves us he will be back very soon indeed to gather his bride for a wedding feast christmas will continue forever indeed so give your gifts in his memory merry christmas to all and to all a good night may your life be filled with his joy and his light you see since that night before christmas this story has filled the life of every person that has came here now whether they accept it or not or whether they believe it or not this story is more than just a story it's more than just another baby that was born on a starry night it's more than a little mother that had got pregnant at 16 years old it's more than that story behind this story is the author of peace he's not the author of confusion but the one that is writing this story is the author of life he's the author of eternal salvation he is the author and the finisher of our faith and when he writes a story it's more than just a story i know that i'm dealing with a dealing with a mixed crowd here and understanding that some people don't under they don't they don't really like reading but could you imagine as you're walking through just walk with me just for a moment as you're walking through the greatest library that there is what we would say in the library of the usa is the library of congress holding over 170 million books there in the library of congress but could you imagine as you're walking through there and every single one of those books that are lined out every one of them have a story behind it every one of them represents certain things or maybe history or maybe different public things that had happened or transpired and they're all written by an author but there is not one book in the in the library of congress that can compare to this book there's millions 100 170 million books in the library of congress but tonight if you don't like reading i'll take you through a book that's got pictures in it i know you can go with me through that book you you know what i'm saying some people don't like reading all those things but you know i used to hate reading myself i used to hate reading hated reading about things but all of a sudden when god put something on my heart i fell in love with one book there's been a lot of books that i started and i didn't finish but this book i've been reading and i can't put it down for nothing that's within me this book the the library of congress ain't got one book in there that can compare to this book there have been books in that library of congress where men have debated and argued with other men on the other side of the room but this book was written by 40 writers that were inspired by the holy ghost 66 books make up this bible 1189 chapters in this bible 31 173 verses make up this bible and there's not one of them that disagree from one another you can read it from genesis you can read it to revelation it lines up every jot and every title it's so dovetailed together that nobody can break it up even god himself can't break it up it's more than just a story it's life it's life in this book in this book it'll tell you about creation in this book it'll tell us to tell you about the fall of humanity it'll tell you about all the things and the struggles and the toils of of vain men it'll tell you about the rise and the falls of kingdoms this book will tell you about defeats and this book will tell you about victories this book is filled with characters much like sitting here tonight it's filled with characters that were outcast it's filled with characters that were nobodies it's filled with characters of of women that shouldn't been nowhere close to the author of this book but they were found kneeling at his feet when everybody else when everybody else thought that they knew the book hear the author of the book told him he picked up and he started writing in the sand and said if you've got you without sin cast the first stone there were people thought they knew what the book said but here was the person of the book that understood the book that could say where are your accusers at hallelujah in this book you'll find men and women that were pilgrims and strangers that were looking for a builder that had built a city that had been called been called and they were destined to go to in this book you'll find men like noah that could barely build a house or barely build a barn but he could take god's divine instruction and he could build an ark and he could take that ark go over the judgments of god because in this book was more was more than just another author but the one that was writing out this book was the one that had predestined noah to go across that water i want to tell you church that the god that is writing this book is the god that will take you through the judgments of hell he'll take you through sickness he'll take you through turmoil he'll take you through sin he'll take you through laodicea he's writing your story but it's more than just a story it's more than just another book it's more than just pages your life is written and it cannot be struck away this book doesn't hide the secrets of humanity like a lot of men today they want to hide out they want to hide and they want to push out and stamp out their testimony they want to try to cover up and they want to guard they want to guard their reputation and they'll pay people to say the right things about their testimony but this book doesn't hide those secrets this book will tell you about the weaknesses of prophets this book will tell you about the weaknesses of the greatest king that would ever live by the name of david this book doesn't hide the secrets of humanity but in the very much contrary it exposes the characters of this book it exposes their weaknesses to show you that if those characters could receive mercy you can receive mercy you don't expose the the the weaknesses of the characters but it exposes and unveils the author of the book it exposes his strength it exposes his power it exposes his anointing it exposes his love it exposes his compassion this book this book will change your life there's a lot of people that read books during christmas time they'll read about a sappy love story that are just telling about somebody that broke up with somebody else and they fell in love with somebody else and tell you about all kind of adultery and try to sear your conscience and make you think it's okay but this book this book right here is more than just another love story at the end of this love story you won't be left hanging wondering who got the girl and did she get the man at the end of this book you'll know exactly that the bridegroom got the bride you won't have to worry about the villain in the book at the end of this book hallelujah it's more than a story but the accuser that made you fall in sin the accuser that trapped you into trouble the accuser the villain of the story will be destroyed in fire and in hell but you when he ceases to exist you will reign throughout eternity because it's more than just a story book will tell you about a man named moses had a temper had a temper so badly to fight a buzzsaw will it'll tell you about that he was a murderer that he ran from pressure he had a stuttering problem but it'll tell you about a man that could get so anointed with god that he would take a little stick and he could call heaven down he could open up a red sea because it's more than just a story that you tell your children it's about a god that was backing up moses this book will tell you about a man named joshua when he got over to with the promised land and god told him he said i will not fail thee but there will be no man stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so will i be with thee and he would stand there and the jordan river would open up and he'd walk over on dry land he would tear down walls that was bigger than this church hallelujah he would stand there and he would control the sun and hold the moon in its place by his spoken word because it's more than just a story this book will tell you it'll tell you about a man named samson he'd tell you about a man named sampson that was a boy had hair and make him look like a woman seven curly locks rolling down his head boy mama's boy but yet he had a covenant with god he had his issues in life he had his issues in life and he and he and he went after and he went after philistines girls and his mama and daddy didn't understand it it was a paradox of him why in the world samson would long after the philistine girls when there was israelites that were under that covenant that would stand there but yet the bible said that it was done for the purpose of god that he might destroy the philistines when satan thinks he's trapping you into a relationship god is putting you in a place to destroy the enemy this book is more than just a book this book will tell you about a man named elijah who is subject to like passions like you and i ourselves are elijah was moody elijah got depressed elijah thought that he was the only one that was living right but elijah could get so anointed that he could hold up the heavens that it wouldn't rain for three and a half years he was a man he was a man that was moody he was a man that was depressed he was a man that had anger issues when he would call down when he would pull down she bears and it would devour children he was a man that had the power of fire that when he went to a showdown between god and baal and it would put to them a showdown which god will you serve god or baal and he said let the god that answers fire fire by fire let him be god this is more than a story this is more than just somebody making this up this is about men and women just like yourself going through life they didn't have a guidebook noah didn't have a god book moses didn't have a god book what to go by what to say what not to say it showed all of his humanity and it showed all of elijah's humanity the book showed all of those things it showed that they were men that were troubled by this little thing that's controlled by five senses that you have so much trouble with they were troubled by the flesh they were troubled by their emotion they were troubled in their spirit but what is god doing he's not just making up stories he's showing his artwork a man named elijah that could call fire down from heaven people would watch as he would take 12 barrels of water and poured on a sacrifice and all of a sudden the fire of god would come down and consume that sacrifice but that man would get so weak under the anointing that he would have to send his servant to go climb a hill it showed that even when you feel like you can't go god's getting ready to send you in a refreshing he got so weak in his in his flesh that he had to send his own servant go up and see if there'd be any clouds and he sent ahab back down to his kingdom and told him to get ready i hear the abundance of rain coming before elijah ever seen that cloud he began to testify of what was coming [Applause] here was a man that was so weak that he couldn't even climb a hill but when the refreshing of the lord came upon him he outran ahab's fastest chariots 17 miles back to a kingdom because it's more than a story there's a god that's behind the characters of the book and if you could realize tonight that your life is just more than your life it's his life it's his story he's the one that's behind you when you feel like he can't go on he gives you a perseverance and say you're not giving up i built you for greatness i didn't build you for defeat i built you for victory it's more than a story santa claus is a story the easter rabbit it's a story but this god is not just a fictitious god he's a god that can be handled he's a god that can be touched he's a god that he wants you to experience him it's more than just reading this book how many could testify that you read this book before you ever had an experience i read this book all my life i grew up with this book i grew up reading these stories i grew up reading and learning to love david learning to love elijah learning to love about a little boy about a little boy they had skipped school one day and all he had plans to do that day was take his lunch with him and skip school because he had heard about a man that was telling stories but there was something different about this man but little did this boy know that he would play a part in one of the greatest stories that would ever be told i grew up reading these stories but one day i experienced i experience the god that writes these stories the god that makes characters to step out of position of going to school to make them go and listen to a man that he was healing the sick he was teaching them on the hill he was telling them about a god that was real he would be the god he would be a god that would tell you all you got to do is write a check that you're more than just a girl you're my wife and you may feel like you ain't brought much you may feel like you ain't brought much to the meeting but what you got for people that have despised the day of small things what you got is everything i need hallelujah everything you've got is all that i need oh you say well i ain't got very much this little boy all he had was two loaves of bread and five fishes but when god put his hand on it there was people that had despised a small thing but when god went to blessing he was showing that he was the same god that rained down manna for the children of israel and he was the same god that could take these fishes and these loaves and he could bless and feed 5000 and they would take up 12 baskets full you may feel like you ain't got much to offer but god all he wants is your heart hallelujah all jesus was born in was a stable but it was enough he don't need a pink decorated bed a hospital room or a blue decorated hospital room he just wants your heart oh hallelujah this god will tell you about the greatest stories that has spanned humanity these stories that we read to you time in and time out over and over again we're not just trying to get you to a certain point we're not trying to just preach to you about elijah or preach to you about david or preach to you about noah we're not just trying to get you to a point we're trying to get you to a life you heard me from this pulpit a few weeks ago when i stood here and i i proclaimed something that was on my heart god i want it more than just a sermon and god's given me something lord willing i'll give it to you in the next couple of weeks lord it's more than stories it's more than sermons it's more than just a preacher it's more than just a church building it's more than just people there is a god that's behind all of these stories that's behind all of these characters and he's trying to work his way into your thinking and into your life that you would say let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus i can point you to the life that i once lived but the life that i now live i can tell you about a god that would show up and he would follow the children of israel by the pill of fire and a pillar of cloud but i'm not just telling about that of 2000 years ago or 6 000 years ago but i want to tell you church of the living god it's thus saith the lord the pillar fire is here in this building it's more than a story that we can make up in our mind he's here he's here hallelujah you're more than just another girl you're more than just a part of the crowd you're the queen of heaven it's more than just a little girl that had heard about a prophet that 800 years before she would step into role i would say behold a virgin shall conceive she was made up of the same 16 elements like you are her mother ate her body out of the ground just like your mother ate her atrial body out of the ground but this little girl 16 years old it was more than just a story to her because her and joseph had been communing on this thought i wonder i wonder when we'll see that i wonder when we'll see this transpire could it be a maiden in the land today or is it for a time on there's something pushing there's prophecy behind this and she's walking down a road she's walking down the road from the meanest city that there is nazareth she's from a town that nobody wanted to be from even nathanael would say can any good thing come out of nazareth it was the meanest city that there was but it was a city that god himself wanted to be birthed from hallelujah and this little girl takes a walk going out it's more than just seeing a light and talking and commuting and thinking on these things and she's walking and making her way and she sees a light and out of that light steps a six foot being and he begins to tell her mary thou art highly favored let me drop this to you why is this girl so focused on saying that she met an angel why is she so driven to say that she had a meeting with an angel that says that i'm the one when everybody else around her would criticize her and say that can't be that's for a day coming or a day gone by why is she so driven why is she so adamant on saying that she met this met this angel that he had an olive complexion had hair down to his shoulders and he stood there he had deep set eyes and as i looked at him it looked like he was looking through me why is this girl so driven to say that she was the one that met that angel let me bring it up to you why is a man by the name of william branham so driven so perseverant that he would stand in faces of thousands of the greatest of the who's whose and said i had a meeting with an angel on the backside of a cave and he told me that if i would get the people to believe my prayer not even cancer would stand before me it's more than just a story of an angel it's god working in his redemption plan getting to his children he said well i don't necessarily believe about mary met an angel i do because i met him i'm a witness i have met him and when joseph is visited by an angel in a secondary way by the way of a dream what does the angel do he confirms mary's testimony the things that had been spoken the things that had been uttered by human voice joseph i know you may not understand this but i'm with child oh hallelujah there be one person that would say i'm pregnant with this word hallelujah mary would say joseph i know you're a just man and i know you'll do the right thing but i i have met an angel and he has deposited something on the inside of me and i am telling you that what that is inside of me has been conceived of the holy ghost she was speaking what the angel said and the angel came and confirmed what mary had said hallelujah brother branham spoke it and the angel has come in this service to confirm the testimony that there will be a bride without spot without wrinkle she's dread she's dressed she's ready it's more than a story you're the people of the story you are the redeemed [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and he's watched over your life throughout your humanity he's watched over your life and you look at your your great span of time and you look at all the mistakes it's real easy it's real easy to flip through this book and find where sarah lied it'd be real easy to flip through your life and find all the mistakes could we be honest it'd be real easy you wouldn't have to do no background check on us we're just human enough to tell you there's mistakes in our past you ain't gotta search very deep you ain't gotta search very far hallelujah you're a people you're a people that came here broken up you're a people that came here and it doesn't take much to look through your life and find that there was faults and found that there was failures i told you that god didn't hide those things but when you get on the other side of the blood there's not one mistake on your life he don't see you in prison he don't see you in chains he don't see you with anxiety he don't see you with fear he don't see you in baby trouble he don't see you with cancer he sees you complete it's more than a story redemption is at work why would god take all of these characters there's a lot of characters that maybe you can't identify with i'd say 90 percent of you and there's nothing wrong in this there's 90 percent of you that probably have never seen the pillar of fire but i'd say there's maybe i'll just say maybe let this be prophecy but i'd say there's a hundred percent of you that have experienced that pillar of fire there's a lot of characters that you you read through the bible and you read through there and you think i didn't get nothing from that i can't identify whatsoever but there might be a brother or a sister that's sitting here that person has got my name identified to him i'd say there's a lot of men that are sitting here that could identify with simon peter that you'd be the kind of guy that if somebody stood up against your pastor you'd stand up with more than a sword you'd stand up with brass knuckles and maybe something else you could identify with it but peter on the other side of pentecost was a liar on the other side of pentecost he was he said things that wasn't right he'd done things that wasn't right but just hallelujah just more than 50 days from this spot where he's a deceiver where he mocks god way where he won't be identified with this jesus 50 days from now somebody might be sitting here and they may not look like the picture that god has planted but just give them 50 days maybe give them on the other side of pentecost if you only knew my story it's more than a story of andrew spencer it's the blood of the lamb it's about the power of pentecost i can tell you about a fire that came down on the day of pentecost 2 000 years ago and filled 120 vessels in an upper room and came out shouting and praising god everywhere but i don't want to just tell you about a god of history let me tell you about a god of his story he's the same yesterday today and forever it's more than a story that you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost you can have it right now sitting in your pew where you're at wash made new it's more than a story it's his story i don't have control over your life and i don't have control over your story but i'm here representing the one that does and you look at your life and you think my goodness here is my life and it's identified it's identified as man i had some great mountain tops then i had some great valleys man it was dark and it seemed like when the sun was with china i only seen it for 20 minutes a day but then all of a sudden you you look at your life and you look and you think i'm coming up on the roadside of a mountain and i'm doing my best to make it in and you climb on up that mountain then all of a sudden god will give you another another valley but when you're walking down in that valley you say hey i can point back to my mountaintop experiences hey i remember what it was like to stand up there i heard a prophet tell me if you stay too much on the mountain your fruits will freeze but if you get down in the valley that's where they flourish at you wouldn't understand the sunshine if you didn't have some rain you wouldn't understand the good times if you didn't have some bad times you wouldn't understand health if you didn't have some sicknesses you wouldn't understand freedom if you didn't have some bondage hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah why can i dance why can i sing why can i preach i know what it's like i know what it's like for satan to put his hands on my feet and say you're not going to dance but what did i do i kept on dancing i know what it's like to be bound up in sin bound up with drugs bound up with alcohol but i can tell you about a god i can tell you about a god that can save and a god that can deliver i want to tell you he's ever present he's another present help in a time of trouble can i tell you that he still delivers from suicide he does can i tell you that he still delivers from alcohol he does i can tell you that he still delivers from homosexuality i can tell you that he still delivers from laodicea because it's more than just a story he watched you all your life hallelujah when you were getting ready throw the towel in he'd come and grab the towel out of your hand hallelujah when you get checked out to a spot where you say i ain't got enough money to put food on my table he supplies all your needs i hear a prophet say how many times has he said in a seat with you how many times how many times has he been there that was him that came to drop those groceries off at your door this is about him they saying about william brown he's saying about ron spencer tim brewett donnie reagan had biscuit jason jackson danny steaming it ain't about me if you've got that's in your mind you're missing the whole story there's more than just me standing here there's more than just you standing here you say well i tell you what i feel like daniel and the lion's den and they're just tearing me down can i tell you what a prophet said there's more standing with you than there is against you you can't see them but the angels of god have gathered here to protect you to watch you you're in his hand hallelujah it's about him it ain't just about it ain't just about a star it ain't just about wise men it ain't just about shepherds it's more than just angels singing in the sky the first noel it's more than a crib can i even go on beyond that it's beyond the cross before this baby was ever born in a manger he was destined to die but more than die he was testing to rise again it's more than a story that you read over in the book of luke and talking about two men that were walking down a road and they were talking about the messiah and all of a sudden the messiah came close to them because they were talking about him he was more than just another man that identified himself with them this was the man that had wrote the book and nothing had happened to him that he didn't know was going to happen to him but he drew near as they began to walk he drew near and he took him from general genesis to revelation kind of like i've done with you this evening he took you from the front of the book to the back of the book and when it got to a spot when it looked like the preacher was getting ready to close and the stories were done getting told there was two people that pulled on him and said why don't you come on in the inside with us he said you know what i believe i will since you pulled so hard i'll let the bethlehem that i am come on the inside of you hallelujah and you'll watch me do something you won't know it's me until i do what i'm gonna do and when i do what i'm gonna do you'll know that it's me now you're looking and you see just andrew you're looking and you just see ron but when you see him do what he's about to do when he works that miracle and he breaks the bread of life he'll say that wasn't andrew that's him that's him that's him when i see those prodigals coming back i say it's more than a story when i see my loved ones that i got prayer cloths laying all over their houses i'll say that was him that was him this is more than fiction this is christmas let's stand oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's more than just a manger it's more than just hay it's more than just a virgin birth about you being in bethlehem but he would choose a little place called bethlehem and the prophet would say that all sons and daughters of god that are living real believers are bethlehem you're the house of god's bread it's more it's more it's more than you could ever imagine it's more stories than i could ever tell it's a true story that could point you out to the stable that he was born at they could take you to a spot where they said the inn keeper would say there's no room this is where it happened at but right here in this service there have been people when they looked on this rejected christ and they seen where other people wouldn't let him in they say you could come in here you can be born right here hallelujah hallelujah this is more than just another service this is more than just me telling stories about bay about bibles and stories of days of old this is more than that this has been him standing here you've been spiritual enough to receive it you've seen it's him it's not christ of days old it's christ in you the hope of glory it's the son of man still walking working in a body living in a body testifying to a body there's a room full gospel lighthouse is a room there's a room in the sin there's a room in your heart as a room and his church is a room in your worship it finally got to a spot that mary had got to a spot that jesus had grown so much that he finally had to come out the son of man has come to a spot that he's finally got to come out come out in your speaking come out in your actions come out in your dance come out in your worship come out in your praise let the son of man come on out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah father we love you father we praise you father we have seen you at work this evening i've seen how you've taken certain people's lives and you went through addresses and you begin to strike cataracts off eyes and he said it was people said if i can just get to the healer i'll find where i'm supposed to be at and i watch people that sing past the story and they got to the healer hallelujah i've seen people that looked past even a little girl named mary and they identified themselves lord i pray that they would remember this service not just as a service not just as another preacher but it was the time that their story was told before the world and their name wasn't even called but they seen himself in the scripture father what a mighty god that you are i pray that you would come and you would bless your children and father we don't have much to give you give us everything you gave us your life you redeemed us you gave us joy you gave us you gave us assurance in our soul you gave us an anointing that would take us past our thinking [Music] you gave us this word [Music] now lord it's not very much lord i give you my heart lord you don't need a very big spot you wouldn't for looking for fine decorated things you're just looking for a little spot maybe about the size of less than an inch setting under our fifth rib that's the spot that you want lord if there's something there that is filling that place that you can't come in may we order from our lips lord forgive me i knew not what i was doing but i opened up this room so that you can feel it let it be more than a story let it be more than brother brother andrew's testimony brother ron's testimony but may i have a testimony the shell to share this story the greatest story ever told the story of the lamb of god we thank you lord we thank you lord jesus name amen [Music] this is [Music] jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory [Music] of god born of his spirit
