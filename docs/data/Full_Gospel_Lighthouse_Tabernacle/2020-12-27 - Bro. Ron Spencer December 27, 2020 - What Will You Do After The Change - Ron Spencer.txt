and find you and minister to your hearts and so good to be in the house of the lord this morning certainly enjoyed last night's service and wow what uh what a high well that sermon kept me up a little bit i thought that uh that was just awesome and we certainly do appreciate that this morning so good to see each and every one of you we welcome brother duggans at your chastity back with us again this morning and thank them for being here with us and certainly love you guys with all of our hearts and each and every one of you good to see you you survived christmas you're here amen we're not going to ask about weight or anything like that today and so we're certainly thankful we'd like to thank you for everything that you did for us and every gift every card every every everything that you did whether it was minuscule or great we we certainly do appreciate it all with all of our hearts and and uh we thank you we thank you for what you did amen amen looking forward to the coming coming months and year and coming to the lord amen next saturday night we'll have a special service we'll not have what's not service but we'll have a special service brother andrew brother matthew and brother william will be speaking on next saturday night and if they leave anything left in the bible i will try to speak on sunday so amen amen like brother donny reagan said we'll find something over in the maps if we if we can you know so amen certainly love you with all of our hearts and uh just thankful that it rained one day before it got cold amen had it been 24 hours later we'd had about two foot of snow and i know it made some of you happy but you wouldn't have got to see me if it did that and so so we're i'm thankful i'm really thankful my wife's not as thankful but i'm thankful and so amen and amen i like the cold weather because it tries to kill the bugs out and so we're really glad for that too amen if you would turn with me in your scriptures to revelations chapter 21 and verse 1 this morning then revelations chapter 3 and verse 12. i'd like to ask you a question what will you do after the change the ultimate question is many have great intentions incredible abilities but they're never committed what will you do after the change jesus said behold i make all things new amen amen revelation chapter 21 and verse 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heavens and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them be their god it's hard to think of it that's such a future forecast vision prophecy but one day that'll be reality and this will be history one day that will be real amen and in the vision i'm there in the vision i'm there hallelujah i like that i like to read i like to read my future and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying and neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away i could close right there and just shout the rest of the day and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these things these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end and i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son you see what you're doing here now is overcoming how many of you even in christmas week had some trials to go through really are you expecting any this coming week yeah yeah yeah so that is part of the scripture that has just been read overcometh all things to be able to live there revelations 3 and verse 12 and he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i write unto him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write unto him my new name you may be seated this evening may god bless the reading of his word amen we certainly love you with all of our hearts wasn't it nice last week to have the dinner together where we were all kind of we were all kind of together that was just really nice and we're looking forward to the day where we can be back together again maybe that's not going to be too far off from now but we're looking forward to that time to where we can be together we realize in the scriptures that god is the same yesterday today and forever the scripture takes us all the way from in the beginning and then the prophet's message took us before the beginning to where that god wasn't even god to where that there was nothing to worship him he dwelt along with these attributes now being god if we were ever with him we'll never be without him so god saw us then then he watched over our parent lineage all the way down through time and and all the way through the genetics and watched over every situation of our life and and some of us were disasters all of us wants to be kind to george washington or kin to some king somewhere another but you know most of us were disasters bootleggers and drunks and prostitutes was in our family tree and some traitors and some different cult situations all of us would have liked to had a prophet in our in our in our bloodline but but most of us for the most of us you know we were just pulpers coming down through but god rich in his mercy watched over us brother mike he watched over us as it came down through angelic beings watched over that human embryo as it was coming down the line now notice you're not alone in some of these trappings as as brother andrew were talking about some of the past if you remember in your first marriage of your first nature you were born in sin we put two scriptures together here you were born in sin you were shaping an iniquity [Applause] that's how you came into the earth it was a it was by that shape and an iniquity you came into the world you spoke lies nobody had to train you to do that your first nature was wicked uh your first nature took you in a lot of different directions made choices that some of you wouldn't make today but it made choices because the king that was sitting on your heart the ruler which you thought that was just you but it was actually by perverted birth you were being led by that first nature and it constantly kept you in trouble and maybe there were times that you felt a leading for god and you would get close to god but because that king that was on the heart was still alive there and jesus hasn't become the king of the heart then you constantly made up and down mistakes and failures in and out of church doing this doing that and a constant disappointment to yourself could i have a good hearty amen right now it's because the king that was over top of your book of your nature was was the satan himself from that first birth are you with me now let's just let's just read some scripture uh andrew read it he went over some of this but andrew read some of this the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham and abraham beget isaac and isaac beget jacob and jacob beget judas and his brethren and judas beget feyrez and zayar of tamar and you remember what she did because there was something on the inside of her that was driving her that she would carry on the lineage of jesus christ let me just say this to you sometimes god just drives you and you can't figure out what in the world is going on you're just driven you're driven there's something inside of you you're driven and you find out later as you look back it was god driving you even her own father-in-law that wanted to have her life taken recognized that she was more righteous than him but yet she would play the part of a harlot because the blood of jesus christ was speaking of better things the seed of god was pressing its way through and it had to go through her womb there was not another womb that it could go through just like abraham's seed had to go through sarah's womb though it seemed to be impossible that's the way that it would go through and begat salmon and salmon beget boaz of rahab now let me just say this to you jesus had to be born in bethlehem but here's a woman on the wall at jericho and she has a before life like you had a history and she had a history and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna drive these things along but she had a history but god went looking at her history because she her womb would carry the seed of the motherhood of jesus christ are you with me and there would be life after prostitution there would be life after a supernatural experience with the token she wouldn't just go decades there was a line there was a a line that i was put for a token and all of my household would be saved and she'd tell that testimony after that and after that and after that but let me just say this you she became the wife of a captain [Applause] and they would settle a community where they would raise the best bread and have the most purest water and this was the place that jesus christ would be born there would be a time to where she was not recognized or even thought of as rahab the prostitute oh if you and i could get to that spot in our lives we're no longer looked at as the past failure we're no longer looked at as our past life or our past scars or our past conditions hallelujah the situation's the trials that you went through listen they just helped mold you to what you needed to be but there's life after all of that [Applause] hallelujah ruth is mentioned but she's not going to be recognized as a moabitus after a certain period of her life she's going to be married into a lineage and her kinsmen redeemer is going to pay for all her past and it's going to be a type of jesus christ in the bride the scripture now the next scripture talks about jesse beget david the king and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of uriahs if you remember what brother random said about uriahs he was such a righteous man he was a gentile man fighting in the kingdom of david listen by the laws of the old testament didn't even have a right in the kingdom are you with me he didn't have a right but he had gave his life for the throne of david and even being the man when when the real trial comes down refuses to go lay with his wife because men were dying for the kingdom and he felt like he needed to be at war and it was david would become a murderer sending this righteous man because david had impregnated his wife are you with me you think you've got history i hear people talk about brother branham made some mistakes you haven't read your bible very well you're just stupid i don't mean to be hard you're just being stupid but brother brandon made mistakes she did what did you think he's a man his father was a bootlegger his family wound up many of them in prison brother branham would have been a murderer had that gun went off he'd have killed those six boys he meant to do it brother branham exaggerated you do too brother brown sometimes the whole story is different he was a human being wake up i don't know who that's for but there it is brother brown had a life before and he had a history and he was just honest he was just honest well brother ron have you looked on the internet and seen all the brother brown mistakes yeah can i look on the internet and see yours [Applause] there was a man standing in the office giving me some grief one time about this message and i felt a little something hit me and i just stood up from my table and i just looked at him and i said would you like for me to call the names of the women that you've committed adultery with and he just stepped out all of a sudden brother branham's problems wasn't too big of a problem and i'm just a man with a gift you're going to meet god [Applause] you don't have to impress me i'm just a man with a gift but one day you're going to meet god with that interesting brother branham would say that uriah would be the man the first man he wanted to shake hands with of all of the prophets of all the gallant gallant men uriahs is the man that he wants to meet last night we were sitting in the office and i was thinking about the sermon that i have today and i want to i'm going to bring i'm going to bring something to you in a realm to where that you'll get it when brother homer was here he was the he was the founder of this church some of you don't know him but he had a heart as big as this building he was driven he was a powerful man or an extremely gifted man but also there were times that you could see god and there was times you could see man now sister nancy would probably be the one that could point out more than anybody of the man part even the times that homer disappointed himself but today he stands with generals are you with me it would be no good for you to throw a stone at him as a matter of fact it would be a waste of your human energy to throw a stone at his past life and maybe some of the failures of his past life are you getting what i'm doing here are you with me so what they are doing to brother branham or to moses or to david throwing stones at past life or at brother homer to throw stones at a man's past life that's gone now if you can only get this what about your present life wipe those stones at your past life enjoy your present life [Applause] glory now let me just caution you here just for a moment we can sing about streets of gold and dancing and and doing those things and looking to the future sitting at the marriage supper of the lamb sitting at the white throne judgment and not being judged and sitting in the in the new world and everything being forgotten in the past forgotten but you're not there yet but neither are you back yonder as a drunk or a prostitute [Applause] neither are you a liar or a cheater but you are an overcomer of laodicea so the tick of the clock let it pick overcome one day at a time if you get knocked down get back up again hallelujah that'll require times when you come to church you don't feel nothing but you know he's healed that'll require times when you feel sick and you're worshiping the lord and you're clapping your hands and it's going to be a worship unto god and you jump into the service and the week before you has been ragged and tough but you come to church and you break through that realm and you break into the spirit of god and you begin to worship the lord and create an atmosphere around you [Applause] paul said this for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was not me was made subject to vanity not willing but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered under the bondage of corruption and the glorious liberty of the of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body i want to give you another example that brother branham gave us every almost every service now jacob's well was there and jesus therefore being wearied with his journey set thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water and jesus said unto her give me a drink for the disciples were going away to the city to buy meat and then the woman's of samaria then saith the woman of samaria how was it that thou being a jew asketh drink of me which i'm a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with samaritans but let me just say as a christian we don't have race issues jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god if you could capture the moment that you're living in can you i just want to just bring you into the thought this morning if you can get past your five husbands and recognize who you're talking to in this moment your future will be different [Applause] then she recognized after a conversation of who he was that he was the christ he was the messiah she recognized something that the priest in the city had not recognized in 28 the scripture says this that the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the city and saith to men come see a man which told me all things that i ever did is this not the christ now this woman is going to go it's not going to take her two years to figure out who she is it's not going to take a bunch of psychology it's not going to take books of learning the disciples can't figure out why he's even talking to her but this woman is going to do something that none of them's done she's going to lead thousands to christ [Applause] in coming days somebody ought to shout somebody ought to shout not 10 years from now not one day i intend to do something for god listen within moments she went into the city not recognized as a harlot no more but she had been with jesus and when you've been with jesus it changes your atmosphere it changes everything about you and she led thousands to jesus christ glory last week we talked about shepherds but the scripture tells us emphatically that these people begin to travel all about saying that we met an angel of the lord and then we went to bethlehem and we saw the christ child and then they begin to spread the news all over their country that we're not looking for jesus to come are we not looking for a messiah to be born he is on the earth they spent the rest of their lives what did you do after the change what did they do after the change [Applause] brother branham tells us about his angelic visitation in a cave he could have stayed there and said i met an angel but it impacted the rest of his life and in prayer line after prayer line when he couldn't break through he would remind the devil you know that i met an angel of god in a cave and he commissioned me so he had passed the cave experience come on so many times listen let me just say this message was more than about christ the mystery of god revealed mighty god unveiled leadership communion and all of those sermons those sermons were more than just preached there was a bride that would come on the scene and not just be identified with elijah this day but would eat the book and then live the book and prophesy again to the world we don't have much time left let us ring it loud and clear let freedom ring the rapture is on the way the bride is not coming she is here she is an invincible army she's not just coming she is living in laodicea she's living in this bright age she is overcoming every day hallelujah brother brown would tell a story about here some time ago the religions of the world met and he said i was reading in a book bring me something that's got some sugar in it i was reading in a book that they had this lady maccabee from oklahoma that's arrested out here that might that might have been in tulsa or one of these places she was running through the street driving a stagecoach smoking a cigar breaking the speed limits of the stagecoach all the religions and different religions raised up and had told their part of religion and how great it was the muhammadans and the priests who told the great how great their religion was the buddha had told how great his religion was and that certain little minister was representing the religions of america the christian religion and when he got his time in the platform he told the story of a great foul woman low down till they didn't want to get around her to even get close to her to tar and feather she was immoral she was degraded thank you she was degraded heard me she was degraded your religions produced there was nothing that could help her and then said gentlemen of the religions of the world can your religion produce anything that could cleanse the hands of this vile woman everybody felt still right on the end of their seats no one said nothing then he jumped in the air and screamed and kicked these hills together and he said the blood of jesus christ won't only cleanse her hands but it'll cleanse her heart and make her pure as a lily the blood of jesus christ takes your sins away and cleanses you from all iniquity and makes us a new creature in christ jesus nothing else will do it [Applause] creeds won't do it do it nothing else will do it but the blood of jesus christ i may have just broke a lot of rules but i'm not worried about your rules i got a message to preach and satan's trying to stop me i read i run across something this week and i don't know where i got it from but it's worth reading to you do you seriously think god can't use you do you seriously think god can't use you noah was a drunk abraham was too old jacob was a liar isaac was a daydreamer leo was ugly you think that you've got complexes and god writes it down in the bible that you're tenderized but god used leah to bring forth his seed joseph was abused moses had a stuttering problem gideon was afraid samson had long hair and was a womanizer rahab was a prostitute jeremiah and timothy was too young david had an affair and became a murderer elijah was suicidal isaiah preached naked jonah ran from god naomi was a widow job went bankrupt peter denied christ the disciples fell asleep while jesus was praying the samaritan woman was divorced zacchaeus was too short paul was too religious timothy had an ulcer lazarus was dead jesus has a conversation with a man named simon and i won't be but just a few more moments for reasons and the lord said simon simon now listen we all know where simon came from most of us would have not welcomed him to our church but there's places there's places that simon is on a boat naked cossack he's rough he's not danny he hasn't been schooled and yet he's the lead disciple sometimes they're so we are so ashamed of our past we can't get over it but what if simon would have a complex help me preach what if he'd had a complex that i can't get over my years of my past listen it's over get over it [Music] how many you drive in this place how many you've ever had near misses yeah you've had near misses to wear that you think that i'm going to crash it's going to probably kill us and then just seems like the angels of god put you on the road and your heart's going and you're still driving down the road well you can either get past that experience thank the lord for it that he guided you through it are you with me and every time you get a hold to the will you don't relive that over and over again are you getting are you putting this together [Applause] god has watched over your life [Music] i've read you this list before i want to read it to you again sarah endured 90 years of the frustrating humility humiliation of being barren but there came a time that she didn't have to live with that no more she was known as the mother of isaac come on there was a time that job got past all of the misery that he went through are you with me and he was restored at all now sure you and i go back for the remembrance remembrance of what he went through to give us strength to get through our trials but let us remind you now there was a time in his life he didn't have that issue his children were waiting on him all of his animals had been restored his lands had been restored his family
