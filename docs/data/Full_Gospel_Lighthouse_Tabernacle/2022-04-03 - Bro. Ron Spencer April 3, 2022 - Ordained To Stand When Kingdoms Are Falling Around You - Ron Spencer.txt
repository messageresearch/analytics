song today i actually had something else picked out but uh on the way to church we were listening to brother branham and he started singing only believe and elijah asked why did brother branham always sing that song and a lot at william says because the angel the lord loved it so much and just right then just something just dropped in my heart and said sing that for me today and i kind of forgot about it once i got in church but the quote that they played today also amazing enough where brother brown was talking about the pillar of fire and we were talking about the pillar of fire on the way to church but very softly in the background the song only believed was being played in it just dropped in my heart again seeing only believe and i kind of wrestled with it but i just want to go ahead and relieve my heart of this and just sing it and this is not only brother branham's theme song but i believe that as message believers it is our theme song so just sing it with me as believers [Music] all things are possible only [Music] [Music] oh all things [Music] lord i received the lord i receive and all things [Music] the lord i received the lord i received and all things [Music] i received jesus [Music] is here and all things are possible cause jesus [Music] is here yes jesus is here and now all things are possible [Music] cause jesus is here let's only be thee [Music] all things possible just [Music] that all things are possible just only believe [Applause] hallelujah what a powerful song what a powerful song and that's all it takes is to see the impossible made possible is to simply to believe on the lord jesus christ amen amen we're certainly thankful to be in the house of the lord this morning certainly happy to have the coffee family with us this morning

think that's just a special thing amen if you don't if you don't understand what it is just thank the lord anyway and so amen god bless you we have a lot of appointments coming up in the next couple of weeks and we'd ask you to remember us in prayer and uh i don't know but i wouldn't mind getting off a chemo for a while so i'd be a really i'd be a really nice gift from the lord and so i believe if we ask big things we can get it and so amen we've been on chemo for two years and it's a very difficult product to have to take and it affects a lot of parts of your body and just to give you an idea uh i'm in a spot now to where i'm having spasms in my chest and so i'd really like to i'd really like to get rid of that and so you remember it in prayer and i know sometimes people say well you know just get over that well i i sure would if i could and so and god's a healer he's never left me he's never forsaken me i'm still standing i'm still doing well and i refuse to complain but we take one day at a time and go forward and and just in case you think you're having a bad day there's a lot of people having bad days and your house hasn't been bombed this week old sister in the ukraine her house got bombed she's 80 years old got a concussion for it she just moved right out into her garage so that some of the other saints their houses got bombed they moved right with her and then they were in church on sunday and so you know i don't know if your house been bombed or not but boy i'm really happy god will keep you in your storms he'll keep you in your storms and amen god bless those people there amen amen if you'll turn with me to daniel chapter 5 today daniel chapter 5. we certainly love you with all of our hearts daniel 5 and verse 1. i'm not going to read the whole chapter but i want to read a few verses from it and i want to take the handwriting on the wall and the lord has just been dealing with me with me for a couple of weeks on this and it just keeps coming it just keeps coming and so we're going to deal with it may not get done with it but i want to take a subtitle to that ordained to stand when kingdoms are falling around you amen daniel being a prophet of god could read the the unwritten or undescribed word that was there and nobody else could read it i'd like to say that we had a prophet in this day that could take the book that nobody else could read and was allowed to open the book that you and i can see what god is doing in this day amen daniel chapter 5 and verse 1 and belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand and belshazzar wiles he tasted the wine commanded to bring golden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives and his concubines made drink therein then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and his princes and his wives and his concubines drank in them they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron and wood and of stone in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand and rode over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall in the king's palace and the king saw the part of the of the hand that wrote and then the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of the loins were loosed and his knees his knees smote one against another and the cream king crowd allowed to bring the astrologers notice who he calls he calls astrologers chaldeans soothsayers tell me my future here what is this saying about me and the king spake and said to the wise men of babylon whosoever shall read this writing show the interpretation thereof shall be clothed in scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom and then came in all the king's wise men that but they could not read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were astonished now the queen by the reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house and the queen spake and said o king live forever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changed there is a man in thy kingdom i love this in whom the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father the king say i say thy father made master of the magicians astrologers child deans and soothsayers for as much as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding and interpreting of dreams showing a hard sentence dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel whom the king named belteshazar now let daniel be called and he will show the interpretation hallelujah let the prophet be called he's got the answer for the trouble of this day let's talk to the lord just now lord jesus we love you with all of our hearts so we heard this song just moments ago saying only believe and it was a song that was very much loved by the angel of the lord we believe that same angel is here even now we ask you that you would anoint our hearts and anoint us for for the service of the kingdom today anoint not just speakers singers but anoint this entire audience those that are watching by way of internet father i pray that you'd send your word may the atmosphere of the presence of god touch their lives now we have many needs amongst this audience and we believe that you're the healer of all of them father maybe even our needs i've heard the prophet say this morning it's a hard thing for pentecostals to say but the word backslidden he said in backslidden condition lord if we're backslidden in our spirit father i pray for rekindling of the fire of god touch our hearts today father minister to us you know every need in our lives in jesus christ's name we surrender ourselves to you in jesus christ's name you may be seated this morning quite a kingdom that babylon was as a matter of fact it was the most powerful kingdom in the whole world at that time they built such a city until the prophet would say that they would write they could ride chariot races around the walls it was a it was a a city to which that even the walls they had would have great hanging gardens they called it the second garden of eden in some places of its beauty of its glory of its power of its riches that was there jeremiah had prophesied and remember this god sends warnings and then then there comes judgment jeremiah had prophesied that israel would come into captivity whenever a prophet speaks it may it may be quite a long time before it actually comes to pass maybe nobody hardly listened to jeremiah a weeping prophet but this prophet had prophesied that you're going to go into captivity and in this captivity they they came and they took all the gold and the vessels of the of the tabernacle the riches of of jerusalem they took they took within them with some teenagers that you and i would recognize one was named daniel one was their other three was shadrach meshach and abednego brother adam would tell us a story when he's preaching and handwriting on the wall he said though they be a foreigner in another country and be under captive condition they would be like the slave that came to was brought to america and the broker wanted to buy that slave and he constantly he constantly wanted to buy that certain one and that certain one that conducted himself different that he that he that he did better he worked harder and so he said i want to buy that one he said well he's not for sale he's not for sale well why do you treat him different do you treat him do you feed him better do you do anything different he said well for a long time i wondered about him what was different about him he said but when i discovered that he's a king's son back in his home country and though he be in a foreign country he still conducts himself as a king son and so daniel was a prophet of god your prophet born from birth being a prophet of god with a gift in his life to be able to interpret dreams to be able to read the word of god to also write the daniel parallels the book of of revelations which also parallels your newspaper today so daniel would would be in this in this country and if you remember uh as as as it would be when they first arrived there and then there came trouble in the in the country there there there came a situation to where that the king would would use him to understand a dream and then and then daniel would be lifted to a place as a prophet because gentiles like to worship humanity and they lifted they lifted daniel to a spot to where they wanted to make him a god though he was a prophet he was not a god but god did dwell inside of him and so they built up they built a statue to to daniel and and he would have a lot of parallels inside of it but and in all of that shadrach meshach and abednego to them he was just he was just their brother they had great respect for him but he was their brother he was not god he was their brother and they refused to bend or bow and upon their not refusing to bend their bow they they went to a fiery furnace and and we know the end of that story now decades would pass that king would get high and lifted up in his spirit into which even though that daniel would be the man that would be a man that would that would contribute much knowledge to him yet he wouldn't serve the god of daniel and he was lifted in his spirit there's where men get in trouble is when you get lifted in your own spirit and you become more important and you begin to draw them into yourself let me just say as ministers our responsibility is for to draw people to jesus christ that's our total responsibility it's to draw people to jesus christ no matter how greatly gifted we are no matter how great that we can speak are you with me now we tend as human beings to like this or like that kind of like strawberry ice cream or chocolate ice cream or vanilla ice cream and i don't mean to put that with preaching but we have likenesses of who we like who we don't like who we couldn't care lest ever hear again we're human don't get don't get all sanctimonious on me right quick here we're human beings i have my likes i have my ducalots i'm on i'm just honest here i'm just real honest now daniel would be forgotten he would be forgotten in the kingdom he was still captive god was still working with him but he'd be forgotten in a kingdom how quickly a nation can forget god [Music] how quickly a nation can forget god brother branham was standing preaching handwriting on the wall over and over again brother branham preached it other great evangelists preached hand handwriting on the wall and he comes to america it comes to an a america we forgot god let's just say we're not a christian nation anymore [Music] we're not a christian nation anymore you know if you're you've got the idea that we are a christian nation you have forgot or you're not paying attention we took god out of our school we took him out of our governments we've we've taken him out of our voting booths when a puritan college can be polled on whether they're christian or not 70 were socialists 30 were were communists not one christian and it's the highest level college for lawyers that there can be and it's a puritan college look how far you can fall look how far you can fall we're a great nation we have been the policemen of the world but we're a weak nation now brother branham would use a couple of illustrations and i i just want to say some things and to get it started brethren it's later than you think sodom and gomorrah little knew that that night that they were living their last hour little did egypt know that death the death angel had predicted to come would come that night little did pearl harbor realize that the raid was that took place we are weighed in the balances and found wanting we are near the end time i could say this to you if he could say that in 1958 we are at the end of the end of the end [Music] watch what he says he says satan your days are numbered your kingdom has been numbered your weight in the balance isn't found warning brother animals took it to a higher level than america or russia or rome or any country he's telling satan himself who rules kingdoms your kingdom is your days are numbered only a prophet could stand there with the authority of the word and tell satan himself your days [Music] separate place he says he said he does it out in the military life he said i was reading an article sometime ago on the sudden attack of pearl harbor that wasn't exactly an unknown attack that wasn't ex he said they had already been warned that the jacks were going to come to do that but the sad part was they ignored the warning i don't want these quotes to just go over your head but a lot of people sit in church because of a seared conscience and they get by with sin for years and years and years and just cross their arms and say preacher you don't have any effect on me understand i'm only the messenger and you can ignore the warning for decades but understand this as a nation as a people your sins will find you out god sees everything they had seen signs the japanese army had assembled themselves together the big ships had been loaded with ammunition the threat was in the air and they were just exactly in the line of the for invasion but they ignored it that's the way it is today with the church the church is in the line for judgment but they're ignoring the coming of the lord you can't blame god they said where were noised about about pearl harbor the japs could attack at any time their big fleet was set out in the waters and the sea moving slowly but steadily towards pearl harbor and they laughed at it on nonsense gloom builders you bunch of worrywarts all you think about is some trouble and on the night just before the great attack the next morning there was a great dance a big party given in pearl harbor itself and no matter how much they tried to say that the japs were coming because men sounded the alarm men echoed the alarm all over the country and said they're coming they're invading they're here but because of their drunken revelry they didn't realize that masses of them would be murdered it don't matter if you're the strongest army in the world when you ignore the warnings i say this to you you can set in the strongest church in the message under the most powerful ministers that there are and ignore the warning i don't want to there's a statement that you need to have in your ears left behind the bombs won't always stay in ukraine it's hard for us as human beings can have to have empathy we haven't tasted of it on our own ground we suffered through a civil war 150 years ago on these grounds we fought for our land whether it was a good cause or a bad cause we thought brothers were separated we talk about war sometimes it's become spiritual brother brahman says the titanic he said presbyter tyrion's in the same way nazarene's peel pentecostal pilgrim holis all of them some man-made achievements but it's just as sure as nimrod's tower did and nebuchadnezzar city did like america's titanic went down so will they go down every man made achievement they'll go down where is the titanic today in the bottom of the sea where is nimrod's tower she's fallen to the earth where is nebuchadnezzar's immortal city it sunk where is france's sigrid line she's blown to pieces where is germany's maganat line just busted to pieces where is the denominational church dead what is it all all of it is a historical memory that's all that's left of sigfrid line is history all of left of the maganat line is left is history all that's left of the towers the of the towers is history and all the church has got today is history [Music] moody sankey feeney smith it's all history but god still lives today he is the same and he always will live when ichabod has been written over the door ichabod says the spirit of the lord has departed there's a reason why god departs when you won't keep his word you challenge him to a spot to where he has to leave because he can't stay in a contaminated church neither can he stay in a contaminated vessel you can't be a christian on sunday and on monday be a complete different individual [Applause] revelations 3 and verse 17 because thou sayest i am enrich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked so we have a church world that don't need god we don't have a service here that we don't need god i want to declare to you we don't need a program i don't want to substitute nothing for true worship and let me just say it's more than about a building or a nation it's about you don't let the walls of your heart where god has to come and tell you i'm done with you because there is a line of judgment there's a line of demarcation there's no return and then there's not a preacher in the world with the most powerful sermon that can touch your heart because it's been crushed over by sin and doubt i wonder how this message would be received at the church that you're now giving grace to they're okay but they're okay brother ron maybe those that are listening to me today by the way of internet and you're tied into a denominational system ask yourself and be really honest with yourself would my church be comfortable with brother branham's message in it maybe would it be comfortable with having brother ron as kind and sweet of man as he is and he seems to be politically correct in a lot of things do you really believe that they would want me to be their convention speaker [Music] so they get men that are politically correct where their church is constantly changing going toward the world there's no going back why if someone be in the church that's trying to get the church back to the original revival they're called a fanatic [Applause] [Music] [Applause] daniel is 68 years old when he's called to this event this evening he's a man that's a seasoned prophet he walks in you notice he's not at the party you can live in a world but you don't have to be a part of it notice even even belshazzar's mother wasn't at the party because she remembered daniel and she knew that her husband got lifted in his spirit and god allowed him to lose his mind to where that he was eating grass with the cattle and the dew was falling on his back don't tell me you can lift yourself so high if this could be preached into the into the the the circles of washington today you forgot god you're on the borderline of insanity and god's going to judge you [Music] daniel refused to defile himself you know there sometimes has to come a line where you as an individual have to decide it's god first and god blessed him regardless of his captive situation notice daniel was the prime minister of the country but they forgot who he was he comes in i'm going to preach to you this morning center i got a visitation so i'm going to preach directly to you god does not destroy him that king because of his drunkenness he does not destroy him because of his pornography he does not destroy him because of all of his concubines he destroys him because he goes and gets the vessels of honor the things that were dedicated to god the the things that were set aside that had been there for decades gold and silver vessels that were for communion that were for worship that were for dedicated to worship god the day that you take god's word and make fun of it the day that you laugh at god's prophet the day that you call it from the devil [Music] and they poured their wine in it they began to drink and they got drunk the who's who of the kingdom was there it was a massive country massive had incredible leaders there they didn't know today we're going to die they didn't know today they were going to die fighting what i fight there's a word that's called bucket list get this done before you die get this done before you die well i'd have did a few things that i enjoyed one was hunting with you i spent every quality time that i can with my wife but i'm not worried about dying because the day that i do will be my first day there i'm the kind of a preacher that's a kind of a guy that money won't buy me popularity won't buy me because it'll do you no good in a casket the most dangerous preacher to the devil is a guy that you can't buy with money and you can't buy them with popularity and you can't buy them with women when that guy will only preach what god tells him to preach that's a dangerous preacher to the devil's kingdom he walks in and assesses the situation i want you to just notice he doesn't worry about himself when he preaches the sermon you see daniel recognized that those words came from his father because he was in touch with his father and though he lived in that kingdom those undecipherable words were very recognizable to a believer it may not matter to the rest of your family but because of who you are baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ is a must knowing who god is is a must having a sanctified holy life in this hour is a must being sealed with the holy ghost is a must andrew preached last night and he touched on emotions and that's where satan's trigger point is satan don't mind you going to a rock and roll convention and scream and holler and do every kind of illicit thing he don't mind you going to a ball game and worshiping guys that make millions and millions of dollars he don't mind you fanning there but you come to church and he reminds you to believe just believe you just believe and and you know that's partly correct you've got to believe but if you believe it's got attachments that goes with it no emotion is not the certification that you got it but it goes with it are you with me tongues is not the evidence but it goes with it miracles is not the evidence but it goes with it all the gifts go with it and if you've got jesus christ inside of you which is this message it all goes with it [Applause] so don't let no hypocrite make fun of your worship [Applause] [Music] because they don't have it themselves don't let no hypocrite even if he's a preacher try to calm you down a little bit just cause they ain't got enough victory to praise the lord don't mean that your victory should be shut up i'm putting together another sermon i preached it many years ago the autopsy of a dead church and i want to tell you why a lot of churches are dead they've got a nice machine for a preacher and he's preaching ice cubes all across the audience the scripture tells us let everything that hath breath praise the lord you have a reason not to worship if you're dead but if you're alive and you've got oxygen in your lungs you ought to worship with all your might don't tell me about what you're going to do on streets of gold you're doing what you're doing right here it's what you'll do over there because death is only your dwell this don't change you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let the redeemed of the earth say so this goes too good with that people don't want prayer lines anymore but i can take you back through some power lines that i have been through mariah that had the alcopecia as a disease and the last time i was in louisiana and she came across that platform with three bobby pins in her hand she believed that when she walked through that prayer line her hair would begin to grow again [Applause] i want to say this to every devil in hell and it did it was in a prayer line that i saw the vision of drew walking i got a picture of him this morning fishing at the edge of the lake with his little hat on saying don't i look dapper today let me just say this you god that's rich in mercy knows how to change your future in a moment whether it's a prayer line or a powerful service whether you're sitting on the front or sitting in the back [Applause] this is the writing that was written many many tackles safari this is the interpretation of the thing many god hath numbered thy kingdom notice these next words and it's finished i said this the other day i did it my way they sink you're standing the day of judgment tackle thou art weighed in the balances and found wanting perez thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and the persians they were drinking they had forgotten god they no longer wanted daniel as their spiritual leader if i take a break i got a right to take a break as great as this kingdom was here pro puts it a prophet i want to i want to hone in on something here just for a moment i don't know how much further i can go but this kingdom was getting ready to fall apart tonight tonight tonight this was the greatest kingdom on earth this was the richest kingdom that there was but sin had caused them to rotten the scripture bears out that this young king had got lifted in his spirit and now he doesn't realize it but if you would take it by time he's got hours to live not days not months he's got the best doctors he's got the best military men that there is he's got some of the greatest advisors that you can have and he's only got hours to live you're weighed you found wanting god won't destroy you until it's the measure of the cup is full the cup of iniquity is full here in america i know this is going to a lot of other countries but america is a awesome nation our flag still hangs here we are still identified as a nation we we still love our country but it's rotten it's forgotten god the revival's not coming back to it we kill so many babies every day it's murder i don't care how you say it i don't know i don't care how you do it it's murder a dollar tree is everywhere satan's seat in hollywood is such a rotten seat until they don't even like themselves if you could just come to a a deal today to where the america's playground disney world about one percent of the country of the whole the whole place has come to a spot to where families don't even want to take their children there anymore it don't take 50 percent it just takes one percent of the top-level billionaires to start making decisions because their life is rotten their decisions will be rotten that's why america has fell apart it isn't a common everyday folk i'm sorry i don't care which party you're associated with your party has let you down your party has let you down and they're rotten let me just say this to you our prophet would say this we're at a point to where you could put an abraham lincoln and a george washington in every county and you couldn't turn it around and to give you an example some good moral person will begin to speak out and immediately they will be tormented well this ain't new have you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men that signed the declaration of independence men that said we don't want to pay taxes if you're interested in how much taxes they were paying you as an audience are paying about 40 percent whether you know that or not it takes you to the middle of june or the end of june to ever start making money for yourself because we're so taxed here in this country don't get mad at me i am the messenger and these people were tired of the foreign country telling us how to worship and taxing us on their teeth and their products and they were being taxed .5 [Music] not 40 a half a penny was the tax that was being levied against him but they said we will not let you be ruler over top of us 56 men men that were not vagabonds they were not dear licks they were powerful men that owned companies that were lawyers several of them were millionaires in that day let me just describe to you what it costs to stand up sent this to my family this morning maybe you're interested in it five the signers five of those signers were captured by the british as traitors they were tortured to death when you see your declaration of independence and we all want it to still be a part of our remember what it cost them they were tortured their names was on that page and for that reason they were tortured and would die from their torture 12 had their homes ransacked and burned two lost their sons serving the revolutionary army another had sons captured nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds of hardships of the revolutionary war they signed francis lewis had his home and his properties destroyed the enemy jailed his wife and she died within a few months john hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was done their 13 children fled for their lives his fields his grindstones were laid to waste for more than a year he lived in forests and in caves returning to his find his home destroyed and his family vanished these men pledged their lives they pledged their fortunes it was their sacred honor 24 were lawyers eleven were merchants nine were farmers large plantation owners these were men of means they were well educated but they signed the declaration of independence stay with me knowing full well the penalty that would be of death would be brought before them if they were captured carter braxton of virginia a wealthy planter trader saw his ship swept from the seas by british navies sold his home and his properties to pay his debt and he died in rags thomas mclean was was hounded by the british that he was forced to move his family almost constantly he served in the congress without pay i bet that bunch up there wouldn't serve a day without pay brother ron i don't like this kind of preaching hang around i'm only getting grayer [Applause] his possessions were taken from him poverty became his reward vandals of soldiers looted the properties of dillary hall climber walton grenit hayward ratledge middleton at the battle of yorktown thomas nelson jr noted that general cornwall cornwallis had taken over his home for his headquarters this was his response he quietly urged general george washington to open fire and destroy his home because he refused the enemy come on church [Applause] these men it seemed it seemed glorious that these men would be there and sign this but it come with cost [Applause] listen being in a rapture is going to come with costs [Applause] i'm willing to pay the cost i'm willing to stand for jesus i'm willing to stand when kingdoms are falling and crashing around us like daniel will still be standing [Applause] thank you i'll i'll leave you with this for a side note john hancock when he came his turn to sign he said i want to sign it so big until the king can read my name without putting these glasses on let me just say this to you i'm not i could care less if i'm in the top 10 15 5 preachers in the message could care less about that but i want to be in the top 10 in hell that's the biggest enemy that hell's got brother ron i'm afraid to get shot at then you're not a warrior no doubt daniel stood and refused to be defiled with the king's meat but no matter what condition he was in he was successful regardless of whether he was in bondage or captive he still became the ruler can you imagine the jealousy that he had to deal with humans fight because since the garden there's been jealousy that's why abel was killed because of jealousy they can't make a god out of you they'll make a devil out of you they get jealous of when god blesses you and because you give your tenth he gives you a hundredfold no matter what you drive people will be jealous no matter what kind of home you live in people will be jealous can't they see that god blesses those that bless him i'm not preaching a prosperity god but i want a prosperity gospel like the charismatics do but i'm saying you're god's children and you're entitled to benefits don't let the devil rob your benefits away from you [Applause] jealousy drives critics they make comments because of their human spirit and in their human spirit they cut and bite look what they got do you understand what they went through to get what they got i drive by brother william's home it's okay to pick on you i've never had a day where i ever ever commented on who does he think he is i only wish he could have built one bigger and if he would come in driving the greatest luxury car that there is it wouldn't cause me one drop of jealousy if you can't see your brother and sister blessed [Applause] i recently bought a coin it was in a package of 12. i gave 78 for that package at an auction people say well how do you make your money i'm gonna give you just a touch while you're on your couch relaxing i'm driven cancer will not defeat me cause i'm driven i'm driven for this gospel i'm driven for this message i'm driven in everything that i do and i bought a package of coins i gave 78 i'm not gonna hide nothing from you listen money don't rule me i gave 78 for that package those coins are worth 299 dollars a piece let me just say this to you if you can get yourself in a spot to where god can bless you it's not who you are what you are it's not i make myself let me just say that's a good way to fall but if you can get yourself into a spot to where god can bless you we had a young man here preached the other day he's 25 years old he's going to be a daddy in a few days going to be a boy and no doubt there's a lot of older preachers that are jealous of that young man a young man that didn't have a fighting chance a multiracial boy born out of a difficult marriage raised by his grandparents but since he was a child said he was going to be a preacher sat on the front row listen at the louisiana camp got an experience with god now stands in the pulpits like he did ours andrew glover the other day don't throw a stone at him but i want to ask you what are you doing with your life what are you doing with your life are you finding yourself with the critic huh does critics bother you brother ron oh they're supposed to be there they're supposed to be there all their words all their videos they're supposed to do that but you see i know who i am and when the angel wakes me up and he talks to me i realize where i'm standing and it don't matter if there's 10 million critics against me are you getting what i'm saying i go too steve i go to the big doctor tuesday she's a wonderful doctor but if she tells me i'm eat plumb up with cancer and there's nothing more she can do for me i'm going to walk out of that place just the way that i walked in believing another report by his stripes i am healed brother andy i believe it was you and i that had this conversation a lot of people can bark and blow and preach and do all different kind of things and ain't never been in a battle but i stand in a complete different situation i've been through hell and still standing for those that think it's not as bad as they think they are let me just say this you this last week we passed the million-dollar mark on medicine that they put through this body somebody thinks it's bad stuff but being where i'm at brother clarence's brother that has much of the same kind of disease brother clarence call me and he said brother ron he said my brother eugene he needs you to come see you well you see immediately i responded i'll see him this afternoon that's exactly what i said you see let me give you a little history here you'll like this sister sarah the last time that i went to see sister pearl i walked out the door and as i walked out the door the spirit of the lord spoke to me said the next time that you walk through that door you'll lead eugene to the lord and that's exactly the truth and that's exactly what happened on monday evening not only did i lead eugene to the lord but i led his wife loretta to the lord as well oh glory i don't think you could probably hear that on the internet internet but it's worth repeating on monday i led him to the lord he was wearing sunglasses couldn't stand light he hadn't hate for days now this was the kind of man that didn't want no part he said i remember one time i talked to him he said i'm not ready for that yet i'm not ready for that yet i'll tell you what god knows he's rich in mercy on wednesday brother clarence took him ham biscuits around here in virginia ham biscuits his royalties better than steak took him hand biscuits and he ate it then he went outside didn't even have his sunglasses on he went outside and and what son wasn't even bothering him that's the kind of god that we serve that's our god that's our god this morning i woke up to a vision i don't care what the critic's thinking now i woke up to a vision of a sister in this church and there was a dark spirit kept telling her she was weak and she was weak and she was weak and she was weak and i saw her turn on that spirit and say i will not put up with you no more because when you say i'm weak i am strong sister heather that was you hallelujah will you stand will you stand under pressure will you stand under situations when kingdoms fall around you will you still be standing will you give me one more minute sure glad to have you brother you too sister connie yeah you're named after another wonderful sister here in this church and she's a queen my timers went off but i'm not done now that kingdom fell because the medes and the persians actually turned the euphrates river and it became dry they actually turned it and that city became a dry it became a dry river almost overnight and this most powerful country in a night the medes and persians invaded them and destroyed their kingdom king gone all the royalties gone the leaders were gone daniel's still standing daniel's still standing he's still he's still there that's the constant in this world this world is going to go through tribulation period it's going to go through a burnin and brother mark we're still going to be standing [Applause] united states is going to be a memory rush is only going to be a memory it's going to be history but i'm still going to be standing won't you turn to your neighbor i'm going to still be standing [Applause] now the torment that you're going through on your job through your life your situations that seem like it's way overwhelming why don't you just i know this is kind of unorthodox for the end of a service why don't you just right this very moment say satan you've been tormenting me this way in that way when you gone i'm still going to be standing can you say that across your lips i'm still going to be standing i'm still going to be standing you get it today you may get it tomorrow i'm still going to be standing i'm still going to be standing that's the constant in this whole story let kingdoms fall let them rise i'm still going to be standing the battle today will get you ready for the battle tomorrow the very next chapter from chapter 5 that next kingdom that daniel is still the prime minister of says he's praying too much and so that one percent of the nation decided he needs to go into a lion's den that one percent of the governing party said we got to get rid of that guy and the king knew what he was at what position he was in because of the one percent they put him in a lion's den but because of he who he was who he was he was god with me as a boy he was god with me when he showed me the writing on the wall he'll be god with me in a lion's den oh king i'll see you in the morning did you get it i'm proclaiming my healing with all of that o king i'll see you [Applause] buddha [Applause] brother mark we never did pay too much continuous attention to our critics no way so why should we pay any attention to them now i'll stand with generals maybe a little shorter than most but i'll stand with generals on that day and i'll hear my name called and when my name is called i'll applaud for all of them but when my name is called don't you expect me to be quiet you silly bunch of dead preachers don't you expect me to be quiet when my name gets called don't know how far i'll have to stroll but somebody's going to be meeting me at the stairs a little blond-headed woman will take my arm put her hand up under my arm we'll spend eternity together well if you get the right one here you'll have the right one there well i got the right one here and i'm enjoying here and if your marriage just tore all the pieces i want you to know you need to fall in love you need to get over yourself and fall in love just fall in love and if you ain't fell in love with jesus fall in love with him and if he wants me to dress a certain way i'm going to dress a certain way if he
