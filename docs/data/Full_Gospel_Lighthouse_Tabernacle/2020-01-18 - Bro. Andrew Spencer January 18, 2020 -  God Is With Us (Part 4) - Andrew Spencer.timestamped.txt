[3:26] times and in divers manners spake in
[3:30] tongues passed under the fathers by the
[3:32] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[3:35] unto us by his son whom he hath
[3:39] appointed heir of all things by whom
[3:41] also he made the world's being the
[3:44] brightness of his glory and the Express
[3:46] image of his person and upholding all
[3:48] things by the word of his power when he
[3:51] had by himself by himself by himself
[3:56] purged our sins sat down on the right
[4:00] hand of the Majesty on high I mean
[4:03] here's a need that you'd like to take
[4:04] before the father this evening man let's
[4:07] just bow our hearts before him Heavenly
[4:10] Father would come to you and the most
[4:11] precious name that there is the name of
[4:13] our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ the
[4:17] God that is our strong tower and you are
[4:19] a refuge Lord you are our peace and Lord
[4:22] it is our privilege Lord that we could
[4:24] just gather around the table as it were
[4:26] this evening and just to be able to
[4:28] feast upon the fresh manna Lord there
[4:31] are certain things in our life we've
[4:33] known scriptures we've read over quotes
[4:35] and we've had things Lord that that have
[4:38] ministered to our lives but Lord we need
[4:40] a fresh word from you today Lord and
[4:42] Lord not that not that the word that we
[4:45] have had is is is not necessarily it is
[4:47] it isn't that it doesn't mean something
[4:49] to us but Lord we want something direct
[4:51] from you father for this moment that
[4:54] we're in Lord we know that that all
[4:56] Scripture was given by the inspiration
[4:58] of God but Lord we want that we want
[5:00] that scripture father we want that word
[5:03] from you that will that will speak to
[5:05] our life and have such an effect on our
[5:07] life that it'll that it'll change the
[5:09] course of our human abilities and it'll
[5:12] change the way we think can change the
[5:14] way we speak Father and lord we we know
[5:16] that we're just mortal men but Father
[5:18] that's exactly what you chose to preach
[5:21] Lord to your to your children you could
[5:24] have chose the trees or the wind or
[5:25] anything but you chose you chose men and
[5:28] father we pray that you would take
[5:30] redeem vessels the semen and speak to
[5:33] redeem that so that we pray that you'd
[5:35] hear through redeemed vessels Oh God and
[5:37] we pray that you would do exceedingly
[5:39] abundantly above all that we could ever
[5:41] ask or think Lord according to the power
[5:44] that's working within us we've asked
[5:46] supernatural things we've asked for
[5:48] major things we've asked for things of
[5:50] mighty and stature but Lord that
[5:53] scripture says that that whatsoever
[5:54] things we desire when we pray we believe
[5:57] that we shall receive them and Lord you
[5:59] take you seem to never let us down but
[6:01] you always go to the next level Lord we
[6:04] can ask something but you always give
[6:06] something better and father I pray that
[6:08] whatever their hand is up tonight about
[6:10] I pray that you administer to them on
[6:12] that need upon that situation that they
[6:15] would hear from you today one word will
[6:18] change their life and so we pray God
[6:20] that you would come I know that you're
[6:23] interested in every person here this
[6:25] evening and I pray that you'd speak to
[6:27] them in such a way that they would say
[6:29] that that was none other than Jesus
[6:31] speaking we love you Lord if all our
[6:34] hearts we commit our ways unto you and
[6:36] we believe that you'll give us the
[6:38] desires of our heart in Jesus name Amen
[6:41] man god bless you may be seated this
[6:44] evening the Word of God to us is such a
[6:53] very precious thing we don't take it for
[6:56] granted when we flip back the pages of
[6:59] the Bible and begin to read over in the
[7:01] scriptures and we read of these things
[7:03] we don't take those things for granted
[7:05] we don't take them very lightly either
[7:06] but we realize that that these things
[7:09] are a divine communicate
[7:10] to you and I that these are the divine
[7:13] Oracles of God and we'll realize that
[7:16] that the Word of God is a power and we
[7:19] realize that nothing can stop the Word
[7:21] of God and Jesus would say that heaven
[7:24] and earth will pass away but my word
[7:26] will never pass away and we realize that
[7:30] the Word of God has a force behind it
[7:32] and and that force is life and we
[7:34] realize that this is the Living Word of
[7:38] God in written form to you and I and we
[7:40] realize that it is his word that upholds
[7:43] all things that it bears all things that
[7:45] it strengthens all things that it's his
[7:47] word of power that creates the world
[7:49] that we even live on today the
[7:51] manifested Word of God is is what we are
[7:54] standing upon and we must realize that
[7:56] there is such power in the Word of God
[7:58] and there is there is that there is
[8:01] nothing that can defeat the Word of God
[8:03] the Prophet would tell us that the Word
[8:05] of God will defeat Satan anytime
[8:07] anyplace under any circumstance that the
[8:11] Word of God will always prevail it will
[8:13] always win and we realize that that God
[8:16] desired to become human flesh because he
[8:19] had attributes that he wanted to display
[8:21] himself in he had attributes of faith
[8:24] Savior and father and all these things
[8:26] that were in him so Jehovah became
[8:28] manifested in the flesh and when he was
[8:31] here on earth he said he was God he
[8:33] looked like God he talked like God he
[8:36] even preached like God hallelujah he
[8:39] healed like God he rose like God he
[8:41] ascended like God he was God he was God
[8:44] in the flesh he was he was God in him
[8:47] God was in his son manifesting himself
[8:50] to his people and all that was in all
[8:54] that was in God he poured into Christ
[8:56] and all that was in Christ he he poured
[8:59] into the into the church and we see that
[9:01] same God that we read over in the Old
[9:04] Testament we see him in action in the
[9:07] form of his son the Son of God and when
[9:10] he walked on the shores of Galilee we
[9:12] watched as God was displayed in human
[9:15] flesh by the name of Jesus we watch God
[9:17] work we watch God
[9:20] he'll we watch God deliver we watched
[9:22] God speak peace to storms we watched God
[9:25] walk down to the widow of nain son that
[9:28] was there and he was dead and and maybe
[9:30] all hope was gone for her but when he
[9:33] laid his hand on the bear and said bring
[9:35] it near we were not watching a man we
[9:37] were watching God in a man who ever
[9:40] walked we watched him as he walked up to
[9:43] thee he walked took to the tomb of
[9:45] Lazarus and he was afraid and I and he
[9:47] was and he was sad because his friend
[9:49] had died anybody that's got a real
[9:51] friend or you're a real friend to
[9:53] somebody you're gonna cry bout him and
[9:55] he was a man when he was crying there
[9:57] but we watched more than a man when he
[10:00] said Lazarus come forth and the prophet
[10:02] said that there was so much power in his
[10:04] word that if he wouldn't have named
[10:06] Lazarus by the name it would acosta
[10:08] general resurrection because there is
[10:10] power in the world of Jesus and we
[10:13] realized that if he that if God had so
[10:16] much power in that man and we watched
[10:19] God working it was God in flesh but God
[10:23] did not desire for this just to be in
[10:25] one man but he desired for that to be in
[10:27] a mini member Bridey
[10:29] called his bride that that she would do
[10:31] the same works the same action same life
[10:34] same power same manifestations that she
[10:37] would look like him she would talk like
[10:39] him she would act like him she would
[10:41] live like him he did not desire that
[10:43] this just be himself and everybody would
[10:45] come to him but he had a purpose in
[10:48] coming that he could redeem a lost
[10:50] people that he could bring them to a
[10:52] spot into a position of who she is and
[10:55] what he thought of her before the
[10:57] foundation of the world and God intended
[11:00] that word of power would not only live
[11:02] in him but he would live in human beings
[11:04] just like you and I and we look back
[11:07] over in the book of John chapter 18 and
[11:09] we see that when the Pharisees and and
[11:11] then the chief priests and the band of
[11:14] men came after Jesus that they walked up
[11:17] to Jesus while he was there in the
[11:18] garden and all of his disciples around
[11:20] him and they they coming to Jesus and
[11:23] Jesus said whom do you speak and they
[11:25] said geez
[11:26] and when Jesus said this there was so
[11:29] much power in his word he said I am he
[11:32] and when he spoke these words the Bible
[11:35] said that the men fell backwards onto
[11:38] the ground there was so much force in
[11:41] his word it was not it was not the man
[11:44] it was not the flesh but it was a God
[11:47] that was behind that word that I am he
[11:49] and I want to say this to you that that
[11:51] same one the same he that walked on the
[11:55] shores of Galilee is walking in human
[11:58] flesh right here in Elkton Virginia
[12:01] there's a people on earth that embody
[12:03] the Holy Ghost the baptism of God they
[12:06] embody his spirit his life hello yeah
[12:12] there is power in the spoken word and
[12:15] this I'm not talking about I'm not just
[12:17] talking about you speaking the word or
[12:19] just speaking what you want to come into
[12:21] existence but when you take up home
[12:23] speaking what Jesus had you will watch
[12:28] miracles take place your watch
[12:31] phenomena's take place it was the word
[12:34] that knock the enemy down and it will be
[12:38] the enemy it will be it will be this
[12:40] word that knocks your enemies down in
[12:42] 2020 hallelujah this is not only in
[12:46] written form but in a people a people
[12:49] that I have the same positions the same
[12:51] potentials and the same actions just
[12:54] like Jesus did and we watch and we will
[12:56] recall that when when the Prophet went
[12:58] over to Germany by a vision that there
[13:01] were witch doctors there that were that
[13:03] were trying to cause a ruckus and trying
[13:05] to destroy the meeting there and and the
[13:08] witch doctors they would take feathers
[13:09] and they were Korean and they were
[13:11] chanting and transmits and trying to
[13:13] bring up a storm and and they were
[13:15] trying to shut down that meeting and the
[13:17] end the tip began to breathe life lion
[13:20] laying like it was taken off of the
[13:22] ground and those witch doctors were
[13:24] chanting enchantments trying to stop
[13:26] this and brother Branham told the
[13:28] interpreter he said don't you interpret
[13:30] this he said you are the Lord Lord God
[13:34] you give me a vision and
[13:36] sent me to Germany these witches has
[13:38] brought up this storm you're the god of
[13:40] creation let it be known that you are
[13:43] God and all of a sudden in less than
[13:46] five minutes the Sun was shining right
[13:48] down through there and right after that
[13:51] fifteen thousand Germans came and gave
[13:54] the heart to the Lord Jesus Christ he's
[13:58] just the same God right now
[14:02] hallelujah this is where we are living
[14:05] in Church that the word has made
[14:08] manifest now in 1959 what was the Holy
[14:12] Ghost given for he said that God poured
[14:15] himself into Christ correct Christ
[14:17] poured himself in the church so
[14:18] therefore now watch out that day you
[14:20] will know you will know that I am in the
[14:23] father and you are me and I am in you at
[14:25] that day you'll know it for it's the
[14:27] whole thing is one plan of redemption
[14:30] coming down that God can come that God
[14:33] coming back to live in and dwell with
[14:36] and commune to his people as he did at
[14:39] the beginning now then as soon as he
[14:42] gets his church in speaking conditions
[14:45] he gets his church to a place that he
[14:47] can flow himself through and love and
[14:50] persuade and fellowship then now come
[14:52] and eat him when he gets his church on
[14:56] speaking conditions you know when you
[14:59] and your wife where maybe she was your
[15:01] girlfriend you kind of danced around the
[15:02] idea that you were boyfriend and
[15:04] girlfriend maybe maybe thought about
[15:06] maybe thought about becoming a couple
[15:08] and you didn't necessarily tell
[15:10] everybody everything you didn't tell her
[15:12] everything but when she became your wife
[15:15] you begin to reveal your secrets to her
[15:18] and tell her all those intricate details
[15:20] of your life of how you were made of all
[15:23] of your financial status and now God has
[15:26] a people that has been speaking
[15:28] conditions they know his financial
[15:30] status they know where he lives that
[15:33] they know what he stands for they know
[15:35] what he believes and what he said is her
[15:38] command and she does it in the save the
[15:41] Lord
[15:43] there's a people that is on the face of
[15:46] the earth the Prophet said that there's
[15:48] been churches churches Brides Brides but
[15:50] there's got to come on I say to you in
[15:54] the rest of the world she's here she not
[15:57] only has the mechanics but she's got the
[16:00] dynamics hallelujah
[16:03] that makes the church live and move in
[16:06] the power of the resurrection of Christ
[16:08] oh yeah we're serving a God who is and
[16:14] has and will continue these supernatural
[16:18] acts and works
[16:19] he made supreme promises and he will
[16:22] have supreme results this is the year
[16:27] that God is with us as he has been but
[16:29] this is a year that I have theme that
[16:31] God is with us and we're going to see
[16:33] miracles but to have miracles you got to
[16:36] have extreme things extremist situations
[16:41] huge obstacles that you can't figure out
[16:43] that doctors can't figure out that human
[16:47] beings can't figure out that's a miracle
[16:49] when nobody can put their finger on it
[16:51] and make it happen but a miracle watch
[16:54] it come into existence in a matter of
[16:56] seconds
[16:58] there's gotta be huge opposition for a
[17:01] miracle to take place and we are in the
[17:04] midst of a miracle making moment
[17:09] [Applause]
[17:11] oh I'm not talking about your flesh I'm
[17:18] not talking about your sickness I'm
[17:20] talking about a body change there's a
[17:22] huge obstacle that is standing between
[17:24] you and I and that rapture and you're
[17:27] getting ready to watch the greatest
[17:29] miracle that's ever hit the face of the
[17:32] earth you know what God is good enough
[17:34] to he'll take care of your sickness he's
[17:36] good enough he'll take care of his eyes
[17:38] on earth but he's got something bigger
[17:40] in store it's bigger than your sickness
[17:43] it's bigger than your problem it's
[17:45] bigger than your trials you got a body
[17:48] change Church don't get your eyes on
[17:50] what's going on right here get your eyes
[17:53] on what he said behold the hour that you
[17:57] think not the Son of Man is coming I say
[18:00] it's just around the corner oh yeah we
[18:07] got to have extreme things extreme huge
[18:10] obstacles for miracles to take place
[18:12] when I found in life that God works in
[18:16] the impossible you don't find God
[18:19] working in the possible and making it
[18:21] possible you find God working in the
[18:24] impossible and making it possible he
[18:29] fulfilled every seven he fulfilled all
[18:33] the seven compound names of Jehovah
[18:36] Jehovah Shama that the Lord is there
[18:41] he's there with you in your trouble he's
[18:44] there with you in good times he's there
[18:47] with you in bad times he's there when
[18:49] you feel him he's there when you don't
[18:51] he's there when you serving him and he's
[18:53] still there when you won't he's there
[18:56] when the money is good and he's there
[18:58] when the money ain't there he's there
[19:00] when you got a Cadillac and he's there
[19:02] when you got a pencil he's there when
[19:04] you don't know you don't have the money
[19:06] to buy new shoes he's there he's always
[19:08] there
[19:09] he's a God that will not leave you he's
[19:12] a God that will not forsake you he said
[19:14] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[19:16] of the world he's a God that ain't
[19:17] leaving you will have friends walk away
[19:20] from you young people but I want you to
[19:22] know there's a friend that's
[19:23] take it closer than a brother he said
[19:25] I'm not gonna leave you when you're
[19:27] going through the valley of the shadow
[19:29] of death I'm gonna be right there with
[19:30] you you ain't walking through it alone
[19:32] I'm right there with you
[19:35] I'm with you on the mountain I'm with
[19:38] you in the valley he's that kind of a
[19:40] God hallelujah but you've got to realize
[19:45] that we are in a struggle between death
[19:46] and life and you gotta realize that
[19:49] death wants to destroy you death is
[19:52] after you it's doing its very best to
[19:54] come after you tonight but I want you to
[19:56] realize this that death is harnessed by
[19:59] God that sickness is harnessed by God
[20:02] that demons are harnessed by God and
[20:04] they cannot come near God's children
[20:06] unless God allows it and if God allows
[20:10] it it shows that he's got confidence in
[20:13] you he'll remember over in the book of
[20:15] Job that job that Satan swore that he
[20:18] would make job curse God to his face and
[20:22] I want you to notice the confidence that
[20:24] God had in job he said I don't believe
[20:27] you can do it you talk about the
[20:31] confidence that God has in his children
[20:33] he's got confidence in you
[20:35] that if he sent you through the fire if
[20:37] he sends you through the waters if he
[20:39] sends you through the mud that you'll
[20:41] not curse him God wouldn't send you
[20:44] through it if he didn't believe that you
[20:46] would still come out on the other side
[20:48] lifting up the name of Jesus
[20:51] Smart's we've seen battle after battle
[20:53] after battle but what did we do every
[20:57] single time we celebrated the victory I
[21:00] don't care what you are facing you can
[21:03] name the name of it but you can name
[21:05] your banner but let me assure you that
[21:07] God will have the victory
[21:13] [Applause]
[21:17] that's right
[21:22] it showed the faith that God had in job
[21:26] and it showed it showed the faith the
[21:34] job had in God and to think tonight that
[21:41] there's somebody bigger than you and
[21:42] bigger than your problem and bigger than
[21:44] your situation that believes in you even
[21:49] when you don't believe in yourself even
[21:54] when you don't feel like you can go
[21:56] another mile he believes in you even
[22:00] when your health is failing he believes
[22:02] in you even when you feel like praising
[22:05] him or you don't feel like praising him
[22:07] he believes in him you see because he's
[22:10] seen you before the foundation of the
[22:12] world and he's not bothered by your
[22:15] mistakes neither is he bothered by how
[22:17] you handle situations he's seen you in
[22:20] victory he said where was you joke when
[22:24] I saw the sons of God shouting for
[22:27] victory you were in God's mind and God
[22:30] did not see you down here and Laodicea
[22:32] all destroyed and all defeated he seen
[22:35] you sound and if God seen me shouting

[22:43] lift your head up walk into it you were
[22:47] singing shouting you were singing dance
[22:51] sing hallelujah I'm gonna walk right
[22:56] into faith is gonna stand to the trouble
[22:59] faith is gonna stand through the trial
[23:01] even when the chips are down and you
[23:06] know that you should have said something
[23:08] negative something spoke out of you
[23:10] positive you know when you don't feel
[23:14] good but something speaks out of you
[23:18] something on the inside is working on
[23:22] the outside when the chips were down and
[23:26] Satan thought that he would curse that
[23:28] you would curse God something spoke out
[23:31] of you
[23:32] faith goes to talk I think this is the
[23:36] time that we all let a faith talk I
[23:38] faith in ain't in a man ain't in man's
[23:41] wisdom Paul said that I came not to you
[23:44] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[23:46] I came under you with the power and
[23:48] demonstration of the Holy Spirit that
[23:51] your faith would not stand in the wisdom
[23:52] of man but in the power of God I faith
[23:55] ain't standing at what man is saying or
[23:58] what signs his hand I faith is standing
[24:00] upon the power of God and if God said he
[24:03] do it God will bring in the past if God
[24:05] made a big promise he'll bring a big
[24:07] result he said I am THE LORD thy God
[24:12] that heals all of your diseases
[24:14] he said I'd make your head and not the
[24:16] tail you may be at the bottom of the
[24:18] barrel but I want you to get ready
[24:20] you're getting ready to float to the top
[24:22] the rain is coming get the barrels ready
[24:26] [Applause]
[24:35] hello faith don't stand on how you feel
[24:41] our faith is resting in the power of God
[24:46] brother madam said that faith finds the
[24:49] word its sanctuary of rest that's where
[24:54] faith is setting that tonight faith
[24:57] ain't setting over here on what you say
[25:00] faith is setting over here on the word
[25:03] notice this he said it moves right up on
[25:06] top of that eternal rock Christ Jesus
[25:09] the word and it lays down there that's
[25:13] where faith rest at faith climbs all the
[25:18] way up it may be a big old mountain but
[25:21] faith climbs all the way up on top of
[25:24] the eternal rock whoo hallelujah
[25:29] sometimes it takes a mountain sometimes
[25:33] a trouble see but faith has failed its
[25:37] resting place and it climbs up on top of
[25:40] it sometimes we want to get over
[25:43] yourself sometimes you got to get over
[25:45] your own pity party and get up and pull
[25:48] yourself up on top but the eternal Rock
[25:52] hello somebody this is our sanctuary he
[25:57] said let the winds howl that the storm
[25:59] shake she safe evermore she rests right
[26:02] there on that word that's where faith
[26:05] genuine faith rests resting place is the
[26:08] word notice for it knows that God will
[26:12] ever prove himself superior over every
[26:15] one of his enemies it ain't your job to
[26:20] prove God right it's God's job

[26:33] he said I've got it for it knows that
[26:38] God will ever prove his self superior
[26:40] over every one of his enemies let him up

[27:06] faith is a little bit cocky I know I
[27:12] caught out probably twenty percent of
[27:14] everybody on the internet just cut off
[27:15] but that's okay but the Prophet said
[27:18] faith still knows faith ain't backing up
[27:24] hallelujah faith is got it's got hair on
[27:31] its chest and it's got great big muscles
[27:34] faith knows what it is you are not
[27:37] building your faith upon faith you're
[27:39] building your faith upon God's Word

[30:20] believe what God said jesus said if you
[30:24] say to this mountain he didn't say if I
[30:26] say to this mountain but if you let it

[31:04] float Daniel know that God could close
[31:07] the lion's mouth the Hebrew children
[31:09] knew that God could stop the fire and
[31:12] jesus knew that God would raise him up
[31:15] for the scripture said in Psalm 16 that
[31:18] I will not leave your soul in Hell
[31:20] neither will I allow corruption to set
[31:23] in jesus knew what the word had said
[31:25] about him and faith knows what the word
[31:30] says about you
[31:35] faith knows what the word says about you
[31:38] and the devil knows what it says about
[31:41] you the devil you can get yourself in a
[31:47] good old competition quoting scripture
[31:48] to the devil and I guarantee you every
[31:51] time that he'll weep he will beat you in
[31:53] a competition of saying what the
[31:56] scripture says you see he knows what the
[32:01] scripture says and I like to remind him
[32:05] that he knows what the scripture says I
[32:08] like to take him back to the back of the
[32:10] book that when he is cast into a pit
[32:13] where I'm standing that I like to remind
[32:17] him that over over in the Book of
[32:19] Revelations that the Bible says that he
[32:21] was heading on a white horse and he had
[32:24] his name and the title of his name was
[32:27] the Word of God and there was a host
[32:29] coming with him and I like to remind him
[32:32] that I am a part of that host that I am
[32:35] sin here not only to destroy him in this
[32:38] age but I am sin here to torment him for
[32:41] evermore faith knows what the word says
[32:52] turn with me to Isaiah 44 ain't God good
[33:00] to give us so many blessings well I was
[33:06] what you don't need holler back at me
[33:08] undeserved that's what we are ain't got
[33:13] good to give us so many blessings god is
[33:20] good all the time and all the time
[33:25] Isaiah 44 yet now here o Jacob my
[33:29] servant and Israel whom I have chosen
[33:31] let's save the Lord that made thee
[33:34] inform be from the womb which will help
[33:38] thee fear not o Jacob my servant and and
[33:41] thou just her on whom I have chosen for
[33:44] I will pour water upon him that is
[33:46] thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I
[33:50] will pour my spirit upon my seed and my
[33:53] blessing upon that offspring brother's
[33:56] Angela your baby ain't even here yet but
[34:00] the Bible said that I will pour a
[34:02] blessing upon my offspring your baby
[34:05] ain't getting here for what another six
[34:06] months but before the baby ever got here
[34:10] it's already got a blessing pronounced
[34:12] over top up and to think that God seen
[34:20] me coming from the very beginning I
[34:22] can't even imagine that the blessings
[34:24] that are stacked up upon you and I
[34:27] that's why Satan hates you is because
[34:30] you're blessed before the foundation the
[34:32] wall and Satan has been cursed from the
[34:35] foundation of the world you were born to
[34:38] be a victor and he was born to be
[34:41] defeated and they saw spring up is among
[34:49] the grass as willows by the watercourses
[34:52] once I say that I am the Lord then
[34:54] another circle himself by the name of
[34:56] Jacob and another shall subscribe with
[34:59] his hand unto the Lord and surname
[35:01] himself by the name of Israel verse 6
[35:04] thus said the Lord the king of israel
[35:07] and his redeemer the lord of hosts I am
[35:10] the first
[35:11] and I am the last and beside Z there is
[35:15] no God and who as I shall call and shall
[35:20] declare it and said in order for me
[35:23] since I appointed the ancient people and
[35:25] the things that are coming and shall
[35:27] come I appointed these things that are
[35:29] coming and the ancient people and the
[35:33] things that are coming and shall come
[35:35] and let them show unto them fear ye not
[35:39] neither be afraid have not I told me
[35:43] from that time and have I declared it ye
[35:45] are even my witnesses whoa hallelujah is
[35:52] there a God beside me you're his
[35:55] witnesses is there any other God that's

[37:07] heal now He blessed from the beginning
[37:09] and he'll bless now I am the Lord that
[37:13] God and I change not I'm Hebrews 13:8 I
[37:17] am the same yesterday today and forever
[37:20] the promises of God are yay and amen you
[37:23] can tell on him he knows no other God
[37:28] but he calls all the stars by their name
[37:31] he knows all of his children before they
[37:34] were formed in the womb he saw Isaac
[37:37] coming before Sarah met Abraham he saw
[37:40] fire shut up in Jeremiah's bones
[37:43] he saw job restored with a double
[37:46] portion before he was ever afflicted he
[37:49] saw the well before jonah ever needed
[37:51] him he saw lines before daniel was ever
[37:54] cast into the pit and he sees every time
[37:57] and anytime that satan plans to afflict
[38:00] you he knows what's coming and he sees
[38:03] it afar off and he gods trouble so that
[38:06] we are molded into the image that he
[38:08] thought of us he sees all things he
[38:10] knows all things but this God can't see
[38:13] one ounce of your sin
[38:17] [Applause]
[38:25] there's none like him number sod him
[38:28] number for him and that God lives on the
[38:31] inside of me ain't none like it you're
[38:37] gonna look over in the book of First
[38:38] Samuel Chapter five and you can go over
[38:40] there and you can look that when the
[38:42] Philistines came in and they took the
[38:45] Ark of God and placed it in the temple
[38:47] in the temple of Dagon that they said
[38:50] the Ark of God up there beside their God
[38:53] akin which was a fish God half fish half
[38:56] female God that they set there and they
[38:58] worship but this God didn't have no
[39:01] power to begin with but they set the
[39:03] most powerful God right Masonic and when
[39:06] the Philistines went to bed that night
[39:08] when they rose up the next morning they
[39:11] come back and they looked in the temple
[39:13] and Dagon was flat on his face
[39:16] worshiping the true God but here's what
[39:20] I love about this is that the
[39:22] Philistines had to picked their God up
[39:24] and put him back in place my god don't
[39:27] have to be picked up he's the God that
[39:30] picks me up he's the God that gets me
[39:32] when I fall I ain't got a worry about
[39:34] getting God when he falls he ain't
[39:36] falling so they pick their God back up
[39:42] and put him back in place they went
[39:44] their self and they went back to bed
[39:46] that night but when they got up the next
[39:48] morning not only was he laying on the
[39:51] ground but his head was cut off and his
[39:54] hands was cut off showing that Dagon had
[39:56] no wisdom showing that Dagon had no
[39:59] power there is no God like our God the
[40:04] enemy that is fighting against you has
[40:06] no wisdom compared to our God he has
[40:09] been stripped of his strength of his
[40:11] power he has no legal rights legal
[40:14] rights he's nothing but a bluff and I'm
[40:19] made out of that stuff that don't Bluff
[40:21] and that came from Calvary
[40:26] here you him I'm quoting a quote if you
[40:30] don't know it oh god what an evil thing
[40:33] Satan is he binds the helpless he comes
[40:37] in by force and he puts the children of
[40:39] God in the corners he puts them in
[40:42] unpleasant situations and he makes you
[40:45] deal with something that you don't want
[40:46] to
[40:47] he puts the children of God in the
[40:49] corners but tonight he's exposed tonight
[40:52] we realize that he's just a bluff he has
[40:55] no legal rights cry stripped him of
[41:00] everything that he had at Calvary
[41:02] everything even fear even fear
[41:10] everything was paid for at Calvary and
[41:14] Satan you don't have any legal rights
[41:16] over God's children how many's God's
[41:18] children and I Satan has no legal right
[41:21] over you they're God's heritage you
[41:25] can't hold them any longer come out of
[41:27] here I adjure thee by Jesus Christ God's
[41:30] own son come out Satan in the name of

[42:18] every time Satan tries to put me in a
[42:21] corner I go back and I do the same thing
[42:23] that I did before
[42:25] I keep whipping him like I did before
[42:27] when he tried to put me in a corner and
[42:29] he tries to put me back again but God
[42:31] pulled me out of the corner because you
[42:34] know Satan is a defeated foe he is
[42:37] nothing but a bluff and I want to tell
[42:39] you tonight if Satan has put you in the

[51:16] wants to keep me and Satan wants to kill
[51:18] me but I know who's sad I'm or the Lord
[51:24] is for me what do I have to fear if God
[51:27] be for us who can be against us
[51:33] David said that I will live and not die
[51:36] I will live and not die death you can't
[51:41] take me God knows what he's doing and
[51:48] God has never defeated God always is
[51:52] seen in triumph on this side but the
[52:01] notepad it tells me it tells me that
[52:07] Satan is against me on this side of the
[52:12] paper it tells me that there's a whole
[52:14] line of a mess in my family history and
[52:17] even in mine even in my own life it
[52:20] tells me that there's all kinds of DNA
[52:22] markers that are against me but on this
[52:24] side on this side I've got a God that
[52:29] told me that I'm as white as snow that
[52:33] he turned over not a new page but he
[52:36] give me a place that my name is written
[52:39] and it's indelibly written by the blood
[52:41] of the Lamb he can't be struck off he
[52:43] can't be marked off Satan is against me
[52:46] but God is for me he give me a place in
[52:49] his kingdom
