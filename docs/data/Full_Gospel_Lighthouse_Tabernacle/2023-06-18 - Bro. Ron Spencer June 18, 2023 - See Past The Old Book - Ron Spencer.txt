gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you so much this morning Father Lord what an opportunity Lord it is to call you father Lord Jesus and Lord if we call you father Lord and that is our approach to you that means we are your children Lord and what an honor and a privilege Lord it is to be Sons and Daughters of the king Lord despite father Lord the world that we live in Lord we think of that story Lord the prophet told Lord of that slave Lord that was Lord that was living in life Lord that things maybe didn't go his way but yet the way he walked the way he held himself other people had to recognize that he was the son of a king though he was so far away from his homeland he still conducted himself as the son of the king and Lord Jesus here we are Lord and Satan's heed and Lord sin all around Insanity abounds hell has come up and incarnated the people but yet there is a light on the earth and in spite of the gross Darkness on the people there is a light that the darker it gets the brighter it shines and your sons and your daughters are made manifest upon the Earth and father God lord we carry ourselves as you told us to conduct ourselves and we conduct ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God what an honor and a privilege Lord it is to reflect your kingdom on the earth and Lord to witness the other people or that there is a way there is a way father Lord out that a life that can live above sin there is an overcoming power not within ourselves but Lord Jesus by the Holy Ghost father that you promise proof of your resurrection that then comes upon the repentant sinner and Lord you allow father Lord you living through a yielded vessel or that you literally overcome through our bodies no matter what the enemy May throw at us no matter what trap Lord the Holy Ghost in US is more than able to overcome anything and everything father as the scripture says that no weapon that is formed against us can prosper they may try and be formed against us they may try and trap us but oh God it won't prosper because Lord Jesus we've been sealed in your kingdom by the Holy Ghost and father God we bring this token life of Jesus Christ with our prayers we've been instructed to do Lord we lift up and we exalt your name because you're so worthy and we love you with all of our hearts Lord and Lord we know that you love us father the entire gospel story the entire Plan of Redemption is based on your love that you refuse to be separated though we were sold out to sin Lord you refuse to be separated from us and you came you partook of humanity that we can partake of the Heavenly oh God what a loving God that you are we want to tell you how much we love you we want to offer you up Thanksgiving and praises and Lord Jesus you heard each request Lord that was read this morning Lord the enemy is so ruthless he doesn't count age he doesn't count innocency he attacks anywhere he can but Lord Jesus we thank you Father Lord that we have an advocate that we have in a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity so father we take the feeling Lord Jesus the infirmities of these prayer requests the infirmities or that we may be experiencing in our own bodies the infirmities of life and with them infirmities by faith we reach out to our great high priest and we ask Lord Jesus that you go through the neighborhood as it was Lord of Our Lives go through the neighborhood of this Sanctuary even now those streaming by way of the internet Lord and those requests Lord through the lives of every request or that's represented here go by their way

bless you if you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning to Revelations chapter 19 and verse 6. amen Hallelujah sister Edward says has asked me the other week and I I waited till this

damn I'll do the best I can and if I can't do the best I can Andrew will do it the best he can and then we'll leave it up to Matthew and so you're in trouble if you get to Matthew and so and we all say amen for that amen I've read this statement to you a few times and I I think it's so profound and especially for today I want to speak to you on seeing past the old book I've given God a a million reasons not to love me none of them changed his mind I think that's so profound brother Branham said he said he that cometh unto me I will and know why cast out he said I believe that once coming under the blood and take his word for anything that he says and every believer here it is I want you to get it every man and woman that has once been brought into the blood of Christ all fear and condemnation is gone out then he will believe every word that God writes in the Bible to be the truth he will not say this is not inspired and that's not inspired but he will believe every word of it come to the Fountain fill with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins oh what a wonderful savior that we have What A Plan of Redemption Jehovah alone allotted for us laid out the carpet for us to come home I love that what a wonderful heavenly father that we have Revelations chapter 19 and verse 6. and I heard as if it were a voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many Waters as a voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the final lineness the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God I think that's so incredible Revelations 19 and 11 and I saw I saw heaven opened and a and a white horse and behold a white horse and he that set up upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire in his head were as many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a master dipped in blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and tread upon the wine presses of fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and he hath on his master uh on his a name written king of kings and Lord of the Lords you can be seated today may the Lord add the blessing to the word Revelations chapter 21 I love to read my hand our future and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Strokes were passed away and there was no more sea and I John sold the holy city in New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a broad adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God shall be with him and be their God that's our future and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death we should we should have a shouting service right now there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away I love it and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said it to me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely and he that overcometh I want to be one of these and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son [Music] Hallelujah Romans chapter 7 and verse 15. for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to me for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for that for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do what a conflict now if I do that I would not it is no more I do it but sin dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members war and against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members notice these next words maybe you could read it with me all wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I Des I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin I want you to understand our soul is born again our soul is born again but this flesh that is worth about 84 cents in chemicals you can put the best suit on it you can put the best hairstyle on it you can put your best belt your best boots you can put you can put the best dress that you could wear and we pamper it we love it we try to take care of it at least you should you brush its teeth you calm its hair you wash it every day hope you wash it every day but it's still worth about 84 cents it came from the cursed earth when Adam fell the Earth fell with it when God laid out the potassium and the potash God knew where you would be born you were pre-planned this first body this first Union that you would have is your greatest enemy your greatest enemy is not Biden or Trump or the high school principal or your teachers or your husband or your wife nobody go to punching each other right now your greatest enemy is yourself the old man nature that when you're when you said you got to be born again you were born in sin you were shaping an iniquity you're fearfully and wonderfully made God knew how tall you'd be how fluffy you would be he knew how skinny you would be I'm not tall dark and handsome just a few of us understand that but and so and so we we realize that maybe we would like to be like somebody else but God made us exactly how we are he pre-planned us he watched over us knowing that we would come through this old birth or our first husband of our first nature and we would come through that through the bedding grounds of her mother and father and inherit their sins and inherit their DNA sometimes in our DNA it it allows temper to fall down into her lives perfectly good child with a wild temper stubborn Natures lustful passions fall right down the DNA chain and as much as no matter if you're gentle no matter how loving that you are no matter how good a person you are we still got to be born again born again it's not putting your name on a church book or signing or making vows born again is your nature your first Nature has to die you have to die to that original nature and Jesus comes in he gives you a new spirit like Ezekiel said he gives you a new spirit so God can live with you sometimes sometimes not even Jesus can live with certain people so let me just say God gives you a new nature he gives you a new spirit where you can live with yourself listen you can live at peace you don't have to war all the time that old nature leaves you but it will haunt you it used to be the king of your heart it used to rule and reign s there was condemnation you were down the stream with the world you were doing everything that you wanted to do but listen when God comes then a war begins to happen in your body that body that came from a sinful Earth that body that loved the sin the love the lived loved all of the attributes of everything of unbelief now that body has got a new king that's living on the inside let me just say this king's got the power he's got the power to take dominion over your life and let me just save yourself well brother Ron I still I still have a temporary well you need to be born again I still lust I still do all of those different kind of things if that King truly lives in your heart you can have dominion over those things in your life now I want you to just notice Romans chapter 8. sometimes when when the the scriptures are laid out it doesn't mean that the sermon was over with but chapter from chapter seven o Wretched Man that I am that's a man that's in a Justified state he's in a state that is trying to become Sanctified but when you become full of the Holy Ghost chapter 8 and verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation I'm not that guy that I used to be I'm not married to that original husband now I'm not talking about two or three different wives here and I'm not talking about the woman at the well I'm talking about your old nature there is a therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus when he is your husband when he is your lord when he is your king there's no more condemnation I want to drive this point today there's no more condemnation to them who walk not after the flesh [Music] Hallelujah I'm not going back to that cursed Earth condition I might be buried in this ground one of these days but let me just say this you listen don't weep for me I'll be more alive then than I ever have been here [Applause] Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 6. seek ye the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way the unrighteous man his thoughts let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him to our God I love this for he will abundantly pardon his Mercy never runs out for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts then your thoughts I want to go back and grab a thought from last week don't go back and dig up bones [Music] those were not the good old days are you with me don't teach your children about your wickedness your children are growing up in a Christian atmosphere they don't need to know you're married to your wife and both of your Christians don't dig up old bones don't dig up old boyfriends and old girlfriend are you with me now that should never been be ever said in anybody's presence I'm going somewhere with this I cannot imagine salmon who becomes married to Rahab after they're married I don't care what everybody else's memory is I don't care what everybody else's thoughts is being a type of Jesus Christ I can believe that salmon never brought up her harlotry I can believe that salmon a prince of a man a captain of a man never brought up her harlotry because now she's married and she's part of the line of the tribe of Judah and through her womb it's going to come Jesus Christ are you with me I would say in the home of Boaz Boaz no doubt never brought up Ruth's past it's good for you he never brought up her past though she had a history just like you boy you got quiet though she had a history no doubt that had some very rugged moments she had been an idol worshiper from a country that was cursed but she told Naomi I will go where you go I'm going to go where you live I'm going to live your God is going to be my God her sister-in-law turned back to her guts but she made a decision not knowing she was going to become a woman of History but when Boaz purchased Naomi and purchased the property and purchased everything Ruth was included and he took her as a wife he was not ashamed of her God's not ashamed of you I have read to you he's going to give you a vesture he's going to give you clothes that are clean and white [Music] listen no memory in god of what you used to be hey that's the theme of the service this morning I I think it's going to be good our garments has been changed garments are important they have ultimate importance there's a wedding going to happen this week Sarah Beth is not going to show up in clothes like you would feed a hawk it's going to be a day I don't know it's going to be a day to which it which is dreamed of addressed to which she's dreamed of she's going to stand as a wife to Seth and he's not going to have a t-shirt torn jeans if you are I'm leaving I don't care what the nonsense of this world says I think God requires us to act like men and women I want to just say this to you today in our body we're either veiling one of two two powers you're either veiling God on the King on your heart or you're veiling the Devil Himself the influence from hell there's only two destinations Jesus talks more about hell than he talks about heaven so it's a place there's garments for both of them the garments we have just read about clean and holy clean and white there's not going to be any sin in heaven none of your past none of your history is ever going to be mentioned there the only thing that is man-made in heaven is the nail scars that will be in his hands in hell they also have a vesture it's called naked naked in hell naked in hell there's not going to be friends there there's not going to be parties it's going to be torment we realize it's not going to be Eternal because God made it so anything that's made is not eternal so but I want you to understand well brother Ron I want to argue with you about eternal hell this man was standing one day with me at a graveyard and he said you said hell's not eternal and so he began to jab at me a little bit and said God don't remember your sins he said God can remember everything and he just kept jabbing he kept trying to make a scene and I said I don't believe this is your wife that you're you're here with you've been living with your girlfriend you're arguing with me scriptures and you're standing in a sinful condition you better pray hell is not eternal I would say hell is 10 minutes is too much I'm glad that's not where I'm predestinated to go to [Music] you're procrastinated for a journey and if there's a literal Heaven which I believe and there's a literal hell I thank God that God chose me before the foundation of the world listen it wasn't because I was from a certain family or I was good enough all sin to come short of the glory of God but God chose us before the foundation of the world and for that we need to be extremely thankful the scripture says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son God don't send a man to Hell man's own choices sends him to hell but due to those choices men news to become nothing more animalistic flesh we realize that there are predestinated seat electric seat that will be the Bride of Jesus Christ but for others you're in a family and maybe you see the message of the hour and all of a sudden something comes to life inside of you and you go that's what I've been looking for all my life then maybe your brother or your sister or maybe even your spouse will go there ain't nothing about that I want I'm going as far as I can in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken in non-seed there's nothing to come to life it's like a bag of corn it is said certified seed there is a percentage of that that is in that bag that will never do anything cause it's nothing quick in there my dad would always point that out to me you know and dad would give Mark and myself instructions of what to do today and you know at home I was raised to work that's why I don't have any problem with it now I hate lazy people and don't I'm not going to get on that soapbox I disdain them I disdain lazy people that's got no ambition people that are count Sinners all their life generous those people that criticize everything that everybody else does the reason they do that they never done nothing there I got on that soapbox on Father's Day you know me and my brother enjoyed playing basketball my brother was about six inches taller than I was almost from birth and so we enjoyed playing basketball we had the Championships the NBA we had the World Championships right in my Grandma's driveway we would play for hours huh but we had to get our work done first and I was planting corn on this day I had a bag of corn to plant now man we had a big Garden a lot of potatoes a lot of corn a lot of corn a lot of corn did I say a lot of corn and I was coming toward the end and all of a sudden I I came to about the last two pounds I just dug a hole and I put two pounds in the ground and I said nobody will ever know but you know it's like the scripture said your sins will find you out you know it went good for a few weeks it went really good for a few weeks we played basketball we had a wonderful time a few weeks later my dad brought me up to the Garden we just took a walk he said let's take a walk I always hated when Dad said let's take a walk it's kind of like that day brother Homer said let's take a walk I was getting ready to get married to Sister Connie he said let's take a walk I hated those words I hated those words let's take a walk all right we walked to that place where I dug that hole every one of those seeds must have been certified that said today I'm going to teach you a lesson in life it's going to take you more than just a few minutes but you're going to take every one of those little spricks there's life in them and they had potential but you buried it now I want you to reach and reach down in there be real tender care and pull it up and I want you to replant it probably 200 of them baby dogs so it's all let's all do it right the first time if it's worth doing do it right then you don't have to redo it again so when you're being born again don't hold on to the original nature or you'll always have to revisit it and always revisit well I'm not going to get rid of that or I'm not going to I'm not going to quit doing that I will not surrender that you'll always fight with that thing tell you go back and dig it up invisible Union which is a powerful I think it's one of the most phenomenal the prophets standing there and now he's these are some of the last sermons that he'll preach it won't be long till his lips will be sealed and he's talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ and I think it's phenomenal he says now he's talking to you he said you separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you're born again remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your innate natural life to the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you quite a statement The Germ that was in you from the beginning found you now your old book is gone with your old union now your name in your old has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness and you stand perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the Book of Life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union but the new bride Hallelujah your life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah were you were the true Eternal gen germ from the beginning takes hope and sometimes it takes hope differently in your life some of your ten some of your 20 we're going to baptize a Adonai how old is faith and so Adonai is five and she's been a wonderful young girl she's ready to be baptized Sarah is going to be baptized today I think this is your another maybe a second time maybe is that right and so anyway she's going to be baptized today I'm glad your mom's with you and so she's going to be baptized today and so all of us it takes a halt in different light different times of life but it takes a hope and he says no he says now you're not only forgiven this is so powerful but you're justifying Romans chapter 5 verse 1 therefore being justified by faith Look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean that you're forgiven for instance you heard I got drunk and done some evil things and everything and then you come around say to me you you found out that I didn't do them then you said brother Branham I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it I didn't do it I tell you I didn't know you may have heard I did it but I didn't do it I didn't do it in the first place now if I did do it I'm guilty but you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I actually did it but the word Justified is as though you never did it as though you never did it in the first place now listen it's not how you look at yourself it's not how your neighbor looks at you I want to give you a real Point you're going to spend eternal life with God and he don't see nothing you're welcome to shout [Applause] you never did it in the first place God don't see it when he forgives you you're guilty of digging up the bones you're guilty of going back and pulling up bad things but God don't look at you like that so let me just point it why should you why should you I want to drive this brother Ron but I I don't get it then I'll preach it again two weeks from now I want you to get how God looks at you he don't look at you as a sinner [Applause] the word Justified it is as though you never done it it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book the marriage is divorced and it's dead I'm not getting a text shot and he says it's not even in the memories of God you're Justified and therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you never did it in the first place the old Union is the Sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with the bridegroom bore your shame himself in your place he took your place you were predestinated for him to be his bride before the foundation world I'm driving this now the Bible said you are the predestinated seat you got to believe that you got to take a hold of that I am his predestinated seed it's not what I think about myself it's what I believe what God said about me are you with me don't believe what others say about you believe what God says about you he said you're forgiven you're Justified it's as though you never did it and if he took all the old book that had a lot of accusations against you and he looked at it he knew it was there and he forgave you and Justified you and it's as though you never did it he being your husband will never point back to your original [Applause] those Eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are sons of God even as we were so-called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were see and therefore hmm reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken hold this perfectly in mind let's take another step redeem needs to be by back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed blood bought by his own he brought back the spoken word seed bright notice the words Jesus says my sheep hear my voice and they follow me you always were a sheep come on come on I want you to get it you always were a sheep you always were a sheep you didn't act like it you may have did a lot of bad things but you always was a sheep that's why you couldn't find satisfaction in the world that's why you and your friends were much different there was something on the inside of you you were born for another kingdom and this world's not your home we're just passing through you tried this you tried that you tried this you tried that you tried this you look for love in the wrong place it's about one day God rich in his Mercy reach down and picks you up and then you realize I have been born for this all the time I never was at home in this world [Music] Hallelujah you never was a pig you never was a dog turned to it into a sheep I love my dog history says that you'll have anywhere from 7 to 17 different pet dogs in your life some of you don't like dogs but for those that like dogs some of you don't like cats but for those like cats I got Ted and Judy at my house they're the best mousers they're the best ground molars they're the best sneakers and they we got copperheads at my place and they'll they'll bring them right up on my porch there thank the Lord little rat little rattlesnake the other day and a little rattlesnake up on the porch dead sometimes their head will swell up and I'll give them Benadryl I'm not taking them to the doctor and spending five thousand dollars on them Hey listen I'm I'm sorry they die I'll get another dog okay I'll get another cat I'm not harmless here but if I die somebody will feed them tomorrow there ain't no whine and cry all day long there's another stump but my dogs are not redeemable my dogs won't turn into human beings they're not going to do it my cats are not they may be Ted and Judy but there's a whole lot better Judy sitting back there than it's sitting there they will not let me rub them they will not let me pick them up they will not let me hold them almost like another little girl here but she warmed up to me this week we thank the Lord for that you see as human beings we had a first nature well that baby died that King died it's got to die and listen the only reason that it it's that that you would even want it to die is you met a new king the potential was inside of you are you with me now you had two different little Natures lay it on the inside of you I'm not preaching too so but you had two little Natures laying on the inside of one was dormant when you were born born of your original nature but one day God began to deal with your heart you came to church and all of a sudden you started crying you started weeping you started you didn't know why one sister told me she said I was leaving the building as hard as I could because you made me mad the next thing I know I was at the altar giving my heart to the Lord I was thinking about I was thinking about you know sometimes the word will actually jab us our original nature were getting mad you know listen it's you know if the word comes across and just starts cleaning you a little bit don't get mad just open your arm and go yeah Lord I need to be scrubbed there a little bit the other day I was at the doctor Matthew went with me and they pulled my toes apart they were looking he said I know you don't like it and I said not necessarily he said pull my toes apart and he was looking he said the cancers can get inside of your inside of your toes he said that melanoma will hide we'll hide where you can't see it and he said we gotta look we got to look and we got to look and you know and then once he looks and he finds something he'll he'll get to stick and then he'll get a little scalpel and he'll start digging and when he digs you know it hurts I I'll be honest with you you'll spray a little something on it but that spray really don't work that well so he'll spray a little something and then he takes that thing and he just cuts it and he cuts it real hard I'll moan but I know it's doing me good because that little thing if I leave it alone will go in my body listen I I didn't do sunglasses in my life so I got a tumor in my eye and it was in my left eye and I got cancer in there I got cancer on my face I got cancer on my arms and and I didn't know it but I left it alone and and then it got in my my lymph nodes and then it got in my lungs and then it got in my brain now we fight it with chemo but had it been originally we could have caught it I'm preaching to you now if you could catch it in time it won't destroy your body that's why you got to destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you [Applause] you say brother on I don't want to talk about that part of my life let it die out let it die out don't let it rule you don't let it constantly Burr at you it's like pornography it's a hidden thing it's a quiet thing it's a it's a thing that we people do in private but it's a thing that destroys them and they become addicted to it Satan will only talked you into doing it once or twice and then you'll become addicted to it maybe your wife don't know maybe your girlfriend don't know but you're addicted to a certain thing listen that's somebody else's wife that's somebody else's husband and maybe you get bored in life and all of a sudden your husband don't give you the 1500 words a day what women have fifteen thousand words and Men is allotted 1500 words major difference and maybe your husband you know he don't talk to you a whole lot that don't give you a right to go back to old boyfriends [Applause] it don't give you a right to go back and and try to rekindle all things it'll destroy you that's the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't need another lover we can't be in love with the world and in love with God at the same time you didn't think I was getting her but I was getting there hey brother Dan daisley's last sermon here you know I've quoted it to you many times I was going to quote it last week it was in the notes but I didn't do it with sister daisley here brother Dan Davis they said he said tonight I'm going to preach to you I think my wife's having an affair all of her mind this audience got dead quiet and he went on for about 20 minutes before he revealed his thing the Bride of Jesus Christ don't need to be in love with the world you can't be in love with the world and in love with God at the same time simply put your priorities is here your priorities is to Worship the Lord your priorities is to put the God first I can't do that brother Ron well let me just say this you haven't died out sometimes things are difficult like a little little thing about that tumor between your toes huh brother Billy Andrews stood in here how many remember brother Billy Andrews Billy was sharp to the point him and Homer were great buddies great friends and we just enjoyed it Billy Andrews was standing here one night and and you know he was telling about how sometimes it's difficult for women to train change their dress to the message of Howard and to how God wants us to dress listen if God wants us to be a certain way that's exactly the way I want to be I don't make the rules I I just preach what he says so and I know this story really well Billy had a sister all right I was there right after it happened they were at a family reunion and Billy's sister was kind of a doll baby and they were in Nashville area and you know it was that it was that country doll baby atmosphere and uh she was a black-headed uh Dolly Parton and so she was standing there unchristian-like dressed in front of Billy and she's kind of taunting him a little bit honestly she was just kind of taunting him a little bit and she said Billy how do I look she wasn't expecting the answer that she got now listen if you want if you want to know the facts ask God if you want to know the facts ask a real Holy Ghost preacher not one of these compromising patch you on the back worried about your money not word whether we get the mayor of the city or the governor of the of the state you might know him you might love them but we're not really interested in that and Billy said you want to know how I think you look he said I can see the blue flames of hell coming up around you said brother Ron that was hard for him to even say in front of a it was true he was honest he was just that honest did she get mad did you take an attitude did she disclaimed him no because when he was telling the story she was setting about where you're sitting and she stood to her feet and screamed Hallelujah he told me the truth remember that Sister Nancy she's a beautiful lady and she served the Lord she may be still alive now she may be watching this service I'm thankful I'm really honest with you I'm thankful I'm thankful that a preacher will tell us the truth [Applause] I'm thankful our Prophet told us the truth I won't be good I won't be much longer but I think this point these are some points that I need to drive there's a great disturbance going on in the world today because there's a new King in England his name is Charles and you know we're Americans and sometimes we get you know we get our different colored glasses on it you know we'll think what a shame what a shame one son is a he follows the protocol you know as a king that King has a certain dress where that he dresses in yes this week he has brought back into order that he will ride a horse in the parade it never has been done for about 40 years he's going to pick up the duties that need to be done as a kink he's going to follow what the king's order says for him to do and he's got stripes and he's got buttons and everything means a certain thing he's over top of a a certain he's over top of a church he's over top of a military he's over top of the government it may seem fake for a while and you may think well that's a fake deal that's just a facade just just let him stop the money flow you find what he's over top of but he has a son that is following him in the duties that son married a girl of royalty the rule says that you marry a a girl of royal descent and that lineage has to go back and she has to be so pure and she has to be a certain way she has to have a certain education she has to have a certain family she has to have a certain character about her so the first son he married a girl who is Kate Middleton he married a girl that fit the protocol then they have children that now become under the lineage of the king but there's another son that you know he's he's just rebellious he's constantly been rebellious he's he's I'm not saying anything it's not in the news and he's you know he's laid with this when he's been a Playboy he's went all over the world and they tried to pull him back in the queen tried to pull him back in she called him in I've been making notes for a while because this is so special and she called him in trying to get him they he was in the military he was he did great things in the military he did great things and a lot of things but but you know even in the even in the duties of of giving money away and going to Africa and create Wells and taking care of children but he refused to follow protocol and in refusing to follow protocol he he went with different women that didn't meet the criteria [Music] and then he married a Hollywood star he married a girl that that fits in the American agenda don't you get quiet and now he's mad because he don't get to be in the king's deal he can't be in the Inner Circle he's not allowed to live in a certain place that was given to him he can live there and have servants and have security [Music] just to give you an idea his security is 450 000 a month and he's been whining over the last month that he's going to have to pay for that well baby doll you made choices [Applause] you made choices that you were going to rebel and there was an order that the king had to follow he didn't make the choice the boy made the choice are you with me now now he's upset he can't be in the lineage of the king he can't get all the all of the benefits of living in the family but he made a choice not to follow protocol this is God's protocol [Applause] how many remember brother Guido brother Guido was with me and we were talking about this line of thought and brother Guido said that brother Guido said there was a princess there was a princess that that would go to the war they kept the horses and she was warned don't give your heart away to the wrong man and she fell in love with a stable keeper this wasn't England but she fell in love with a stable keeper and her father brought her in and she said but I love him and he said but you were warned not to give your heart away to the wrong person well it feels good yeah and I'm in love with him but he's a stable keeper you know what she did she married that boy and you know what the father had to do banish her from the family that boy only made dollars an hour he couldn't provide for her what she lived in the first day all of her life as a princess don't she be born she made a choice to marry a stable keeper The Story Goes On to say that they lived in a one-room house the rest of their life but she could have lived in a castle it wasn't the king's fault it's not God's fault here he's going to be the judge he's going to be the bridegroom he's going to have a wife and she will be without spot or she will be without blemish but I want to tell you don't give your heart away to another lover God sent you a message not just you he sent around the world a message there is going to be a bride God's there there is going to be a tribulation period there is going to be a heaven and hell but God sent you a message well I don't believe it he's not going to send another one if this message didn't awaken you I'm sorry I I'm really sorry the last family reunion was about a hundred people at the Spencer reunion I didn't know most of them I left as soon as I could that ain't my family my grandmother became a message believer she had a vision of who William Branham was my daddy gave her a book The Way of a true Prophet she opened the book and that was the that was brother Branham that was the man in division she never doubted it she believed it with all of her heart my grandfather hated it with everything that was within him it didn't change her my daddy's baby daughter she's now back in church she's now re-baptized but she was a Believer for many years and got away but now she's back thank God for Grace thank God for Grace but many of my father's siblings absolutely hated this message it didn't matter God didn't come down say I'm sorry I sent the wrong Messengers he sent the one he sent the one I had a friend of mine write me this morning Happy Father's Day from new New Zealand when I got off the plane I didn't know who he was never met him before I shook his hand I traveled 31 hours I shook his hand and it was like we hadn't never been apart we rattled for about seven days it's like I'd met a brother that was long that I never met and now we because we stepped out of Eternity into time and now God brings us together I've gotta I've gotta I've got a note right here from Tom Ray while I've been preaching listen I don't talk to Tom every day but let me just say when I met Tom Ray it was like I met a brother from my family that I'd never met before and we can just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk we have different backgrounds we have different histories but we stepped out of Eternity into time am I getting you there we're a family here we're a family here it doesn't matter what the world says against us it doesn't matter what they're doing or you're with me they're charted one course and we're charted another [Applause] now let me let me just can I pick this up in a couple weeks or three weeks or so I don't do this too much so we took off the old coat that old coat was abusive yeah I've lost a little weight it'll be okay that old coat was abusive did a lot of bad things to this body that old coat was abusive they gave me a new one so I took off the old coat and I put on a new so you'll take off a t-shirt and put on a tuxedo because it's an event so God's gonna give you a new body because you can when the presence of God comes down and you shout and you dance and you praise the Lord just as soon as it's over your body's going oh I'm so tired so God's going to give you a new body so you're going to lay off the old coat he's going to give you a new one I'm finished with this Jesus tells us a parable of the wedding supper and there was a man there that didn't have on the right garment he didn't have on the right garment garment I'll get to it in three weeks the right garment's important we're not looking for a Baptist garment we're not looking for a Catholic garment we're looking for the word if you don't understand that don't let that offend you just keep eating pie but we're looking for the wedding garments can I just pull that up just for a moment listen when Esther came into the kingdom there was there was hundreds of virgins that were presented to the king and they were given all the riches of the kingdom of what what could they would want to be as a queen but Esther did something that was extremely important she asked the Elder servant what does the king like [Applause] I'll finish with this so when the king saw Esther he saw himself saw himself in her he couldn't turn her down because she was everything that he wanted in a wife so so when God looks at you and he sees himself in you he can't turn you down punch your neighbor and say did you get it I saw your light your eyes light up right there when he sees himself in you he can't turn you down I've had a good time I've had a good time Matthew you mind singing with me and Donnie Nicholson sang together I don't sing with Andrew because he blew me away I'll sing with you though I'll sing with you [Applause] thank you when I was in a fire he didn't walk away he risked his own life to pull me out Happy Father's Day Aunt Matthew Hallelujah mom told me that I wasn't tall dark and handsome that was my Father's Day and me telling you that I'll sing with you and not Andrew that's your Father's Day [Applause] I'm not
