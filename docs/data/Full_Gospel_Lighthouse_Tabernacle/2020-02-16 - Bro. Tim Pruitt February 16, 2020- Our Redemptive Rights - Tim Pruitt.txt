TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] amen let's just bow our heads for a moment let's just talk it over with him Lord we thank you for grace grace that is so amazing and love that astounds us and you would love somebody like us that you as the psalmist would sand would say even in the Hebrews what is man that thou art mindful of him the son of man that I would visit him Lord when we think about it is almost incomprehensible to think of what you would do to leave all of glory to come down and be one of us and Lord not only just be one of us but Lord to take home our sickness in our sin and pay the price of redemption we're asking Lord your blessings upon us now tonight you look down on his service and then you walk among us by the Holy Spirit and the angels of God and camped round about us may Lord we feel your presence as you sweep over this audience and you speak to hearts in a real living way I pray your guard my words Lord let me speak as just an oracle of God Lord let me speak very very plainly and yet Lord o God with the Wiz mother holy spirit Oh God can't help us now in this hour as we stand here needing your help we realize our own humanity how lil we are and how great you are that you do great things through little men so Lord we just pray God that you'll be the great one among us tonight if they're sick in our midst that you would heal them as we have covered so many situations and all of us are human and so we need a God we need you Jesus and we ask God that you'll just come and and speak to hearts and lives that there be somebody that is lost and Lord there's always among us those that don't know you are those that have been just justified believed in on the Lord or those that you do not work a sanctification here and they need the Holy Ghost Lord there's always those among us in the body and we just pray God that wherever they are in their walk with you they would move a step forward that you just calls them Lord to come on in to heart around with you and come to know you in a more real and living way and I pray in amongst your Saints those that have been filled with the Holy Ghost that you would so inspire them and set them on fire with the glory of God that their lives are changed in your presence in the great and mighty way Lord that they're sent out as a as a torch light in this generation to bear forth the name of Jesus Christ I pray father bless this church bus our pastor brother Ron Lord we know the work you're doing or we're confident in you and we're just asking your grace now to continue thank you for your favor on our life in Jesus name Amen amen praise the Lord what grace God gives us what love he shows us what mercy that is indoors and this new ever morning a man's we have new mercies for today aren't you glad for that amen god bless you brother I missed your wave a while ago here's your wave a man I didn't mean to do that I was in deep thought amen everybody else if I missed her way well sometimes we get in deep thought I love all of you appreciate you amen Daniel chapter 12 verse 1 we're going to read from I'm just gonna do this as you're standing here because it'll be a few minutes for I get to my text but we'll read this since we're in the custom and it's the right thing to do to stand an honor to the reading of the word so we'll read this portion let you be seated and Daniel chapter 12 verse 1 and at that time shall Michael stand up I want you to notice this word and we'll come back to it later at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever amen god bless you you can be seated I want to thank you for this opportunity to be here with you this weekend is a very very wonderful privilege to be together with you and have this moment a little time to spend together with you thank you for the wrong for being so gracious Amanda welcoming when he didn't know I was coming and just kind of stepped in as a surprise thank you brother Matthew for allowing me to speak last night your place and thank you brother brother for lovin for doing the same you know actually you know Gabriel is my cousin and that's the truth she's my first cousin his daughter and she was raised up in our home and so she's like a daughter to us spend many hours there and we love her a lot and I was privileged yesterday to get to be one to the first of the family that get to be coming and hold her - I told her him a little boy and and just just prayed a little prayer of dedication over him and we're thankful to the Lord for His grace amen you know I did a little bit of research in my family history and and of course many of our family members out west we're west of here you probably don't know that you think we're in the south but it's real west of here and South you know we we all come our roots came right down from the Shenandoah Valley right through here coming from Plymouth Rock and New York right down this way into the Shenandoah Valley and then out from there into Tennessee and down through Arkansas Mississippi and kind of lined up and where we wound up in and my family did in Texas and my mother and dad moved to Louisiana that's where I was born but you know it's um so when when I look at my ancestry and look back a lot of them have that had landed places lived right here in this area amen so we're much kin than you thought see I'm really not Cajun I'm just from Louisiana cuz that was born there so no French and me that I know of but anyway um you know they they took we did a little DNA test and they've changed their mind to three times about what I really am some only God knows I think Amen who we are and what we are because we came from God we're going back to him amen so it's a real privilege to be here tonight and so we want to say thank you for your warm welcome in your hospitality and your love and spending the time with the Spencer family now you know that I'm here for a purpose you know that and even tonight I'm here to announce our common goal and our mission of the Bride of Christ and I have some very very important things to say to you tonight as I believe that God has orchestrated this moment and some of the things that I will say comes as a result of I just celebrated on February the first fifty years of ministry and no I don't look that old I don't even look 50 I know but I've had 50 50 years of ministry now and and but you know here we are in this day and this time and this hour and and so as I speak tonight I'll speak from many years of experience and things that as I've seen as we've gone along now as I said I came here on a mission I came here at Thursday um and I'd been feeling like I should come for some weeks ever since we've heard the news back in the 1st of January and I was seeking the Lord for the right time to come you know as many of you know that we had had plans to go to Japan we have we have a church there that we was able to our church was able to send missionaries there and established a church in Japan they now have a pastor a group of people gathering together there of them from you know different nationalities really but Japanese also we're currently translating the message into the Japanese language and getting them on the message hub that brother Bisco sponsors him in his church so anybody in the world that speaks Japanese can go to the message hub and be able to read those sermons and the Japanese language and then of course I was to go on go to the Philippines for some ministers meeting and this was to happen Tuesday so I didn't know when or how it would work out and so I was just looking for the right time and my son Timothy if you remain OTT remember but twelve years ago when I I began to talk to him about coming to see brother Ron and I I was saying you know I really feel unheard to go and I don't I don't know I'm not getting the news correctly I mean I don't understand what's going on and I'm really really burdened about it and I had spent several days and my son just under inspirations and dad go today and I said today he said yeah go today and I said well you know we have a farm and I have was in the middle of chores and I said I've got and it shows up I just can't walk out of the barn and the Mesa will take care of everything you go pack and so we got in the car we drove here all the way up into Tennessee picked up the journey the next day got here and of course I'm you you know the rest of the story God moved on the scene what we were here and and answered our prayers and the bludgeons my prayers but the prayers of thousands around the world your prayers and we just seen the Holy Spirit move in a tremendous way as I prayed it and asked the Lord I said God don't let me I don't want to leave here without being able to talk to my friend and so I'm looking for something that miraculous to happen and that that day we walked into the hospital and as I come into the area I heard him talking I said praise God amen you're doing the work amen and we saw him from there and the Holy Spirit doing a work of course you know the process of healing and things that went on for sometimes actually probably six months a year or more and then the kinetic rate healing that took place and brother bisko's meeting you remember and so you don't mind that talk to you a minute all right well good because that's what I'm gonna do anyway but you know we we as I was praying about it and brother Timothy was coming down the highway he was coming from Missouri where he just preached a meeting there and saw the Lord do some wonderful things and and there as he was thinking about different things he gave me a colonies at dad it's time for you to go to see brother Ron and I said you think so I said well I've been praying about it no he said dad it's the time and I said okay I'll I'll pray about it some more so I prayed about it and as I prayed the Lord confirmed it with me nothing short of a miracle I was able to get plane tickets for me and my wife to get a flight to Charlottesville and I really appreciate your support sister Karen it meant your encouragement your strength to me she's a wonderful wife she's been a part of this ministry for 45 years old and so I really love and appreciate her very much a man and but I didn't know if we could surprise brother Ron because you know I had an old aunt that was a Pentecostal aunt Dadson aunt Exley's is a great aunt she was way up in age and we drove 6 7 hours down to beit el in texas one time to see her didn't tell her we were coming just was just gonna show up and and you know she greeted us at the door and said come on e and i got dinner fixed the Lord woke me up this morning said honey child you've got family coming today get ready [Music] [Applause] [Music] I said well knowing brother Ron I may not sleep either hand on him and sure enough he had told brother brother Andrew he said I just feel like some of my friends are fixing to come see me amen but he he had no he had no clue you know next thing I'm hearing from John andis I hear you've gone to brother Ron's and then I hear from then I hear from Japan you're going to brother Ron's and I'm here and so how does all these people know what I'm doing and so you know India knows and Japan knows and ending up in Cloverdale nose and different but other on don't know that we're coming and so we were able to go into the airport terror and as we landed and brother brother wrong sister Connie Metis Terry didn't know who was coming and but it was a very emotional moment you know brother Ron's had some weeks of bad news and doctors reports and and of course I've been on top of everything but um I felt I needed to obey the word and do like I said last night when God spoke to me about brother Kenneth and said I've already done my part what are you gonna do about it so you know this is response to that I've been commissioned and so have you and every other believer in God was only reminded me of the Commission I did my part I went to Calvary I paid the price you go and apply it so you know when we heard the news of his diagnosis but the Donny Reagan had text me about it and communicating with me about it I just said why don't you just meet me here and we'll double up on the devil and so we we went from the airport where brother Donny sister Carol were waiting on the inside and brother Ron's house and and you know I thought it was very wonderful as we as we talked and you know we was brother Donnie was gonna be here Friday all day and I didn't know how everything would not be unfun fold but brother Ron wanted prayer right now you know right now and you know it was unlike Pharaoh who wanted another night with the frogs you know he wanted threat right now well you know so since he wanted prayer right now I had to preach in a little bit so you know I began to because I wanted an atmosphere you don't understand sometimes what how important an atmosphere is was in the right atmosphere things can happen that's why it's gonna be really important that you work on your atmosphere in this church and every service come with an expectation of faith and believe in that God's going to do some great things amen now so you know um I had brother Donnie and I began to talk to divine healing and deliverance and just I just want to make something very clear that this this what is happening is not from God it is the depth sickness does not come from God sicknesses of the depth and it's common to humanity because of Adam's sin selling us and sent into slavery where everyone are subject to sickness and if you ain't had it well you will at some point in time in your life amen and you say well I don't see any need for praying and then these prayer lines and praying well you just never been sick enough yes [Applause] you get sick enough you believe in divine healer and then you you'll be seeking for somebody with that can pray a prayer of faith we had a man up in Arkansas when brother Ron and I was back in June brother Jason Jackson's we had a man in Arkansas that um that was that was actually came to the meeting because he was invited he had met with a man who does body work and he's quite a little witness and began to talk about the Lord and he said well man I've I've got stage 4 cancer and I've been to two churches and they won't pray for me because they said we don't do that we don't we don't do that we don't pray for the sick you know because a lot of them don't don't believe that it's God's will to heal and and they don't believe God does that anymore and so he said you know I can't find a church she'll pray for me said we'll come to our church tonight we're having special services and we believe in praying for the sick and and of course during that course of the service the Lord come and moved and and we it was prayer there was many miracles that took place and you probably have heard some of this already but but anyway this man has just recently reported that he's cancer free and healed the doctor said no need to even come back amen [Music] so I began to talk to divine healing and deliverance and how God had delivered those who were dying I've been in times where people were dying and right brother on himself when he was dying from the burns you know and I I was there in that moment and sing God move on the singing and you know and and and I began to speak about the will of God to be healed and the ladies were the adjoining room they came in as we were about to pray and the Holy Spirit came down and anointed us and we prayed and we curse that demon of cancer and then for his immune system to be activated to seek out and destroy this cancer and brother Donnie began to interceding in the spirit and hands and tongues from a heavenly language began to flow out of his mouth for seven or ten minutes and we were charged by the Holy Ghost and demanded that evil spirit of cancer to leave his body I want you to know it was a powerful and anointed moment and as I concluded in prayer I looked up and I saw the word Shalom's written over the door of his office and I thought of a little sister Shalom in India who is also struggling with cancer and she is contacted me and of Senator prayer cloth and and and I began to pray for her also because I saw her name up there and it just slightly just real quietly I was praying for her and then the Holy Spirit began to move and the word Shalom meaning peace and I began to speak peace peace peace peace peace peace Lord your peace and the Spirit of torment wasn't fear it was a spirit of oppression that has been haunting brother wrong for weeks left him right there a balloon [Music] today is felt better than ever and we believe he's healed but that doesn't mean we he won't have another battle but rather healing is a process once you'd understand healing is a process a man a miracle you know it just snapped right out of it but you know and never have another issue but healing is a process God promises he does give miracles but he promises healing and just speaking about that that our peace I I just want to tell you about a situation that happened at youth camp and we we had more demons that has attacked our young people and we had we had major during that time of that weekend we had we had over 10 different demonic manifestations of demons that we dealt with it that youth camping and then the after service on Sunday and just seeing it and I just want to testify of all of them we didn't have a one without a victory not a without a bit but when you know we had a long prayer line that night and I prayed till the last person came through and I was uh I was we had prayed for nearly 400 people or more there's close to 900 or more people come to the youth camp and as in our services we've had that camp since 1987 and so for 30 30 something years now and but you know it's one very large meeting we had nearly 400 or over in the prayer line that we prayed for lay hands on and believed and saying God come on the scene and bring deliverance and and so when we as I speak about this it was a young man that after I turned around looked over to audience now and of course I'm exhausted after prayin for so many people and I'm standing there just kind of in a daze looking out and I notice there's a crowd of young people and others some counselors and others or over a young boy that has and I look and I'm watching it and seeing what what is going on here and and and I see it's another demonic manifestation that as they passed him through the line some of them just grabbed him and took him out and and put him down at the altar and then it began to manifest and so here we yeah and I look in I said oh I've still got another one to deal with and so I'm standing there looking what I do you know I'm watching and I'm seeing and I I don't say that I prove of all of this but this is what was going on that that you know they they were demonstrated and young people could bind the devil and he couldn't speak and they were doing it and then have shown him pictures of brother Branham of the pillar of fire and who is this and and and he would react and do and whatever yeah and then they would you know put a Bible on him and you don't know nothing worked to cast out the devil and and so finally they made away from me and I got down there and I just locked my eyes to his eyes and I looked deep into his eyes and I looked and from my soul and projected and I began to speak peace peace peace peace and I said it about the seventh time and when I did it left him and the boy said I'm free I'm free it's gone I'm free now let me just tell me if we can cast out demons out of a personal spirit we can cast him out of a body are you with me amen and that's all that a cancer is it is a evil spirit and by his word we cast him out Jesus did it by the word brother Branham did it by the word he spoke to them and expected them to do what he said because he was commissioned to use the name their way you know as we said you know when we were praying for brother Ron there we we and the Holy Spirit came in the room we know what happens when God comes in the room we sing this before he comes to heal he comes to deliver he comes to win he never loses so you know what should we say to this thing that has attacked the you at this church and your pastor here what shall we say well I've got just one question that I want you to answer and that is is there anything too hard for the Lord amen so we have overwhelming evidence that God is with us so who then can be against us so we hear a prophet saying and he sees her people come in at the end time and he says Satan be careful because there's a people that know their God that'll do exploits a man now just to tell you a little something here at the same time we're praying brother Jason Jackson is in his office at home he he knows nothing about our visit here or that we're praying or the time we're praying that moment the Lord speaks to him and he writes a note he puts a date he puts a time and it's the same time of our prayer and his note says is a message to brother Ron says brother Ron fear not don't doubt I have not forgotten my promise to you if you trust me I'll use you like never before [Applause] hallelujah not simply the name of the law and last night I spoke to you on whose report will you believe now I just gave you the report so what are you gonna believe a man I'm just gonna share a note dear brother Ronson out adage a team of Ministers that we are all friends with and we communicate with and he this is his note and I hope you don't mind me doing this so but this week the doctors have declared that master melanoma cancer is in the lymph in both lungs the through surgical biopsy two different procedures they've asked me to see the oncologists on Tuesday this week coming and I'm gonna be here for that kept the plane right after all of this is for treatment recommendations and here here's God's report that you know on Thursday morning he says I got down on my knees and I asked God for a boost eight weeks of bad news each week worse and worse God was already on the move brother Joe Green came to each surgery Thursday afternoon I was surprised with two of God's angels brother Tim through it and brother Donnie Reagan and wives Wow Wow Wow Thursday evening we had prayer meeting he came in the house he made a doctor visit and he brought us a touch that only he could bring only God can bring peace and calm troubled waters so I asked you to continue to pray for us on this journey God is in control can't thank them enough for taking the time and sharing their strengths in this battle we shall see miracles and he said this morning I reported to my wife and that sister Connie and her brother Tim I feel like a new man [Applause] [Music] and what did that tell you last night Yvette begin the good work we'll finish it he'll never do something halfway [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen now I'm not through talking testimony from last night's service you were here most of you but I was ministering to Japanese and I didn't even know it I supposed to meet ministering to the Japanese but I didn't know I was ministering to Japanese there's a doctor this comes from sister Angela right over here that you heard singing a while ago but there's a doctor you as is originally from Tokyo Japan he's been in the US for for 25 years dr. yu is international correspondent affairs professor and he has several PhD titles he's originally from Tokyo Japan he's lived in the u.s. here he's alumna of the pins of Penn State who is who taught three classes that sister Angela had during her graduate studies he is a philosopher and always shared you must have scientific evidence to prove anything the disinterred dissertation dissertation for English literature have already been accepted I was very thankful we had your in review on Monday and Tuesday I shared that on the dick tree too many opinions the supernatural occurred several times in history without scientific understanding sister Angela used several examples in the Bible knowing the arc regardless of scientific proof it raining 40 days and night and God shut the door not Noah another example was Joshua and the son standing still the question was asked well how when scientific research says there had to be movement us stated I don't know how God did it I know just know it happened and before the cat leaving the campus I shared that I would be at J mu and the visiting special friends and church family in Elkton I shared the youtube link and expressed you should check out the link you'll be blessed and encouraged last night during my service my phone kept during service my phone kept vibrating I knew it had to be urgent as my family knew I was at church I checked my phone and it was dr. u he had decided to check out the youtube youtube link and her brother Pruitt's comments about Joshua and the son standing still he shared he was so overwhelmed by a presence that came into the room he immediately gave his heart to the Lord [Applause] [Music] this job is full of miracles hallelujah [Applause] he was thankful that the Lord understood him as he had never prayed and he asked me what should I do next she replied be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he quickly said he knew someone who did that and just let me tell you if you're listening in tonight yes and you have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come right here they know exactly how to do that hey man he's baptized in his name a man's own she says I have the so thankful to share the good news with others we're looking for that last one and I'm thankful our paths cross who knew that I would complete my graduate studies and would encourage him to listen to truth God knew so thankful so that sister Angela's testimony now I just think it beyond amazing that I forfeited going to Japan to come here and yet God saves the Japanese answered his question decides his heart and he experiences salvation what a mighty God I just want to say this it's his vision we're walking in tonight like Phillip leaves a meeting to minister to one man the ministry continues tonight amen god bless you a man I'm sorry for taking up that much time this now start preaching amen try not to wear you out tonight but I just have a few things to speak to you about and you know we we are wanting to speak about our redemptive rights and kind of where we're at at this moment and taking as much time as I have already I won't be able to maybe go into the depths of this like I would like to tonight but I just want to read from revelation chapter 5 and verse 1 as we can it's moving to our thoughts and our thinking for a moment if you've been sitting a little why won't we all stand as we read this again and that way we'll give you just a little bit of a break amen again I'll try to keep this in a reasonable time but Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 I saw in the hand right hand of him that sat on that throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and you know then he the the call went out was who was worthy and there was no man worthy and so just to go down to verse six I beheld lo in the midst of the throne two four beasts and the midst of the elders stood a lamb now notice we read that Michael shall stand up who stands for the children of that people and now we see you over here because Daniel is actually the the Hebrew or the Jewish version of the book of Revelation they are parallel together in one applies to the Jews the other applies to the Gentiles and are largely applies to the Gentiles and that's others largely applies to these users things that applies us to of course in the Book of Daniel but in he said in verse six and beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth amen god bless you you can have your seats now now speaking about as I said a redemptive rights and where we are standing at this hour in this moment and here brother Branham talking about this in the token he said I'm looking for a time of break forth of the Spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for eruption faith and just before it comes and everything is setting straight in order for that and I believe we're now at the time that the word should have the preeminence and I think this is very important that we lay aside our creeds and our thoughts and come back to the word put that word in the proper place in our lives in our and our vocabulary and what would say put it in put the word in our mouth because that's where the sword the Lord must be held is in the mouth God doesn't hold the sword in his hand he holds it in his mouth it goes forth is a word the sharp two-edged sword it'll cut out diseases it'll heal the sick it'll save the lost and it comes as the word is spoken now so you it's important as I said to keep the right atmosphere in this church I'm gonna speak very very personal to you right here because there was gonna be a many ups and downs in this journey a man but you must stand steadfast in the faith no matter how many ups and downs are in the journey you stand steadfast in the faith a man in the greatest battle ever fought brother Branham told of the stars of heaven the heavenly hosts a knee and knee and he says how they hold their positions in the heaven and they stay where that God placed them and he said that we as daniel said should be less shining like the stars of the heaven and our battle here we just as the stars hold their position no matter what changes comes what win bows what situations happen they stay steady and he said so must we hold our position in times like these a man until you must stand strong notice the michael is standing a man the lamb is standing but you also must stand a man you are mature congregation now you've been here a long time just passed by a while ago yours I think it was your second church up in the house they're where where I bleep ass by the word brother Fraser changed a house into a church and and so on if you many of you would remember how many remembers that all right we'll only you've been in here a long time so I'm telling you you're a mature congregation now a man and I'm just gonna say to you you know with some of the things that we're going through at this time you don't have to be so needy and lean on preachers you're mature Church you don't have to lean on your pastor you can stand on your own two feet and man you don't have to pull on him for every little thing amen I know we want to God the skin of a man but you're not babies anymore you're mature Church and anyone with the Holy Ghost is an adopted son commissioned God to take your authority and your position in Christ so so again you know you you need to you must direct some of this pull my own gobs were skinned hold and put it to the real God in heaven a man and get in connection with him I hope you understand what I am talking about and man I don't really usually figure for people to read what I'm thinking between the line I usually put it right out on the line so you get what I'm talking about amen so so they're there again you know you can pray you know how to pray you've been taught to pray you got you know I get a call here the other day from California in the middle of the night you know and pray for me pray for my wife brother I'm sees he's got a year Aitkin I don't even know the man never heard don't don't know who he is or nothing about him and whatever else but you know he wanted a God with skin on during the night so I've had an earache and and and I said hey I'll pray for you but you pray I mean you know you're your Christian you got as much right to go before the throne as I do I'm a never believer can go boldly before the throne of grace and find help in their time of need even even his sisters it didn't say brothers it said these signs of all of them that believe you can lay hands on your sick child and they shall recover amen and they're not trying to discourage him from reaching out to the ministry I'm trying to encourage you to reach out to God a man and to to to pull on him and come together and create an atmosphere where where you're easy to preach to a man and you've got a great atmosphere I love it amen we enjoyed that and meant seeing the Holy Spirit move but you know again you got to do everything you can during times like this to keep in the atmosphere of believing you don't allow circumstances to control where you stand in Christ and what happens in the church I told you I'm here to rally you the congregation you understand amen so I'm taking a lot of Liberty here amen and I and you you just hey you know I'm not here to make you mad I'm here too I'm here to make you glad they've been make you glad you got a great big God that you can lean on during this time a man now brother branham said some things about revival he said if you want to see a revival start started in yourself you know it's got to begin in you faith has got to begin so it's right in you is where the revival must be and mistake amen and I and again I'm not saying you ain't got in your revival I'm saying you've got to keep throwing on the word of the word of God own that revival keep that flame of going amen brother Branham tells us again here you just take one put one or two good members in the church that's really on fire for God it'll do something for that church that more than 40 revivals you can have right a good cleanse of member set an example with a face shining with the glory of God with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of God amen and so what do you do what do you do when there's a fire and you wanted to to get up higher you know you have a little spark you blow on it and then you fan the flames and that means no matter who the preacher is a [Applause] man and so no matter who that is preaching yet don't lay out of church or stream because your favorite preacher is it gracious [Music] [Applause] [Music] you've come right over the church and you support your chart and you pull on the gift of God a man you come with the right attitude toward that you see God use men in ways that they could never be used because you pulled on the gift of God you pulled that right out of them a man you don't realize but even brother Brendan said about his gift to heal and he said you don't realize it but it's you doing it he said you are operate this gift you pull me right pulled from me God right out of me to you to your need and you got to realize this is what happens even when preaching is going on and man yeah and you can date to the greatest preacher in this message and stand him here with the wrong atmosphere in his church and he won't be able to do a bit of good because God will never bless the resenting audience hey man you got to come with some faith now brother Badham talked about revival times and he said I remember one night in Vandalia Illinois's I walked into the meetings and I had not been in the meetings more than five minutes and there wasn't a feeble person around the place anywhere you know what did that expectation Amen brother branham walks into the door and just with him walking in the door people get up out of wheelchairs and off of beds and healed by the glory of God dumb the deaf and dumb speaking and the blind scene and just simply the Spirit of the Lord was present and He healed the whole group of them he said now that's when you can do something when revival is going but you let that revival fire you die down then you can hardly the people are still Christians but they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that does something I meant just like in the Forge and a blacksmith's shop you got to get the iron hot before you can build a pounding on the anvil and if you don't it'll never straighten it so you got to fan the flames and they he said that's what it takes to have a revival is everybody under the heat of the Holy Spirit that brought down the powers of God in a revival movement and he said there is prayer meetings going day and night every minute so you don't get into the woe is me and the woe is us attitude but you go to prayer about this and you call on God like you never have you get here early to the church and man you quit singing the song when the saints come drag him in and get to the house of God and be here and pray and create an atmosphere and pull them the gift of God a like I said no matter who's preaching I'm gonna use it if you come in the right attitude and man you got to make this personal a man who you know God we realize God is doing the final work of the pouring out of his spirit it started on the day of Pentecost well I'll pour out my spirit saith God upon all flesh and here he's pouring out the last bit of his spirit and you've got to come here with a fun and say fill me up with that new wine for your corn out your Holy Ghost I want more of it and make room for God to get rid of something of the world and your own sorry attitudes and have a change on the inside let the Holy Spirit come in and saturate your being really important you say God created me that revival oh it's a you know it's kinda like an old boy come into church one night and he sat down you ain't made it through the singing and then he went to sleep on the pewter and st. and count down for a little while and when they dismissed he got up he looked of course you know the Saints had been worshiping and they've been preaching and altar calls and shouting that he slept right through it all and he looked around when he finally got up and looked around he said boy it was a dead duck tonight wouldn't it well there's more than one way to sleep you can sleep spiritually sit right there in your Pew and refuse to move into the Holy Spirit so wow that's just gonna be a dead duck tonight we heard this news or this happened or that happened or handled my favorite preacher ain't preaching disco it's your attitude [Applause] that will make the difference and if you come with the right mental attitude toward eating divine promise of God it will make it come to pass [Applause] [Music] now so you crazy you cried God greeted me a revival Amen brother Branham says in in the Easter seal this is one of his the last year of his ministry he says men and women it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do things that God wants you to do I don't care what what somebody else says about it the neighbor says oh that person's lost a man pray all night to read the Bible I don't care what they say is what God called you to do that's right oh they say we can have these old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals and it says oh yes we can - you can have it in yourself and you're the majority and God no matter what the rest of them think so your Bible begins with you and right now we need to be in a state of revival moving in the spirit faith moving in the church believe in God in every situation are you with me this is very very important that you that should take what I'm saying you know we've been through a lot of things in the message through the years as I said I just had 50 celebrated 50 years of ministry and one of the big celebration we just talked about it a little bit of church and and and so on but um you know you know at the same time we're just honored to still be here holding forth the word of life a lot of people think you know that I came that I'm Pentecostal well they as far as denomination I never was in that I just told you up front you know where where I was I got saved in this message the first sermon I ever preached was this message I have never been I've never been in the denomination Pentacles but I am true Pentecostal and I'll always be true Pentecostal because my heritage goes back to the book of Acts a man a man Peter was a Pentecostal and Paul as a Pentecostal and it was Jesus spirit that came down on the day of Pentecost cause for any cost so if you get the Holy Ghost from the inside of you you two will be Pentecostal [Applause] so don't ever think that I've got a foot in Pentecost or I got a little bit of Pentecost I'm all the way Pentecostal so is that midnight right here raise the ball man you get the Holy Ghost on the inside of you it'll make you Abbot you believe it'll make you Sally to make you rejoice it'll make you left the word it'll make you move in the spirit brother Brennan talked about the divine healing moose and and so on and I've done a lot of study about that why did that divine healing move die and of course it was because because that it moved into you know where it became about money and popularity and who had the biggest ten and you know the biggest magazine and you know who's the great one and kingdom building and so on like that and and the revival died but divine healings are still supposed to be in every church in fact brother venom said God never wanted these big divine healing movements and meetings he said he wanted divine healing to be in every church that's where it belongs so you know but then in this brother branham would look back himself and he'd say you know what is it accomplished he said bunch of church members maybe make some man some stop stealing or live true to his wife and but you know what you make have it and the church member come join our group you can hear all this and and a prisoner of Christ and and that brother branham preached paula prisoner and and again you know all of these things that he looked out and he realized you know why why the movement failed him in is because that men would not come harnessed to the Word of God they wanted to the Baptist one to bring his own Baptist is in Pentecost I want to bring his Pentecostal ideas in the Methodists and brother wanted to bring his Methodist ideas in and so you know he said they wouldn't come harness to the word but we we have had now many years to become harnessed to the word there's no excuse Amanda that we are harnessed to the word that we we are pulling the word we're not pulling for a denomination or a move but we're we're pulling that word and woked to Christ and he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you if your yoke to me you know because him and his word is the same so then of you then you can ask what you will and it shall be done to you and so you know there's been many men that God would have to strip down to the ages and you know in order to use them and I think we've had a time of being stripped stripped of our own ideas and our own ways and whatever and to come harness to the word and then it's a wonderful hour and the time where I believe that God can do something in the the members of his bride and you know I can see and I can look back and I can see these men were that they had to stand there was a time of training and we've had times of training so I go and I was there in the hospital room with my wife and I said we've been trained for moments like this we are believers and we're going to believe because that's what believers do hey mom and there she had a life-threatening brain bleeding just within four weeks later another MRI and couldn't even find a trace of it left [Music] but anyway you know again again is it's a very same thing as we're looking at this and I'm trying to to hurry through this to get to some points here that I want to leave with you tonight but you know God's going to have a church in the last days a bride without spot or wrinkle and they're gonna have to be harness to the word and realize we're not going on our since knowledge anymor see taste smell feeling here and and what we're hearing the doctors every what we're seeing this or but we're going on what the word said hey man cuz god's gonna have a people he promised to do it he's gonna have somebody that would believe somebody that will walk in the power of god so you take men like Joseph that would be called for a purpose and receive a vision then great dreams and things of what he would see and yet in order to be come into the place he would have to have a lot of things shaved off of him and this little boy that was hated by his brother because he seemed to be arrogant saying oh you know you're all gonna bow down to me I got Stern showed me and God had to take him and tore him down into a pit and humble him down and strip him down and make him a nobody in order to make him a somebody a man I believe God's been doing that with this bright movement not just here but all over the world that he's been stripping them down to make them realize well you know we who we and many of us have got real puffy in their own spirit and we're the bride and we're the chosen and we're the ones going into rapture and we're predestinated and we will lose our humility we even lose our compassion and it gets to be us father and no more and we don't have a real care for others are you with me and Joe's about to get a few things shaved off of him and then before he could meet his king and he and brother madam said sometimes God takes his people out like that and saves a few of their own wheels off and so then they just can't do what they wanted to do they're not Liberty to do what they want to do because before they could come into full power and the love slave to Christ they had to be helped and had to be shaved off and presented a man and then anointed to fulfill a purpose that he had ordained them so you see there come a time when all of these men like Moses would have to be stripped down Paul would have to be stripped down of all his knowledge his own ideas and and and to go through this time of being stripped and I just want you to know I believe that we're in a cycle of time when when the stripping is over and it's a time now to stand there comes a time where you move into another another era you've been in here at this time for a while but now we move into another era where we're called to take a stand so you know Joseph Moses Paul had to be said to stand upon their call and though they first had to be stripped and and retrained and then God would show what he could do with nobodies you know in all these cases they thought they were somebody then they learned there were a nobody and Joseph the favored son with his dreams and the slave down in Egypt and Moses a prince reduced to a common Shepherd in in Midian and and Paul a Pharisee of the Pharisees and knocked off his high horse and found himself in the desert being retaught we've been through a time of reteaching mm-hmm but when Joseph stood up out of the prison he came to be right next to Pharaoh when Moses stood up out of Midian he came with a word in his lips and brought mighty Egypt down to his knees a man when Paul stood up and out of the desert he came with signs and wonders and miracles and God's Word open to him of what the New Covenant was about I'm calculating my time now I want just to go here come real personal down to this church and what were called far back on December the 30th back in 2016 but the wrong had a dream and this word really we were with brother Bisco we just finished a meeting we were rejoicing of the accomplishments and the victories there in this dream people were taking photos of us and this would this would actually be fulfilled in Switzerland which at that time but the Bisco was not even going to Switzerland it would be we'd only find that out just a few days before the meeting began that he would have decided to come this Dennis dream change to Memorial Service and their Timothy who was speaking on I that's my son Timothy he was speaking on I am the resurrection and the life and then I came and and I spoke on all doubt suffer stand and be healed and as I spoke I address brother Ron Spencer personally and that knowledge him being my friend that was present I think this is very important and brother Ron would would come to from that dream and the presence of the Lord but feel his bedroom and he'd speaking other tones for over a half an hour that morning he would text me and I have heard of records of all of this he would text me that morning about this but it would be just an hour so later that his son-in-law Davey would would you know Hillman Whitney had been promised a child and he would be crushed and the truss the tree he would be crushed against a tree with his truck on when slid on the back of ice you remember he would be crushed and broken pelvic now the doctor's report again whose reporter you gonna believe though doctors report says you won't be able to have any children his wife was born with a female condition that made it medically impossible to have a child he was a sufferer Davey was a sufferer a man that stood and was healed [Applause] but iran's mother just a few hours after the dream would have a heart attack and be taken to the hospital just hours after this dream and their suffering and health issues would be gone as she said I'm ready to go and she moved from here into a youthful body I would actually use that sermon title that are that that as a sermon title and I preached it in convention some of you heard me preach it I had brother Joe greens and and spindella and I also preached it at home and brother Kelly Hilda Branson in a convention Theron and also in Holland convention up at brother Ivan cars up in New Brunswick and finally over just at a regular and Wednesday night meeting that brother Nathan Brian so I preached on that on that sermon or suffer stand and be healed I've done it six times which is the number of Seth for me and when I preached it at brother Kelly's it was really phenomenal because as I was preaching that my son back home not knowing what I was preaching he preaches on I am the resurrection and the life simultaneously as I'm preaching or you suffer stand and be healed and so he preached that you know that um if he had actually preached on it before or left I preached on Saturday night Rose now suffer stand and be healed and he preached it again on Sunday morning now it's been a great sermon for me however I come to realize it's not just a sermon it is a message and I don't mean it's a new message we got a message it's the 7th angels message and not and there's no change into that it's a message but this is a message of restoration that we received by Malecha for the Elijah prophet and it speaks of healing and restoration amen but now it is time that we preach it like never before that it becomes more than just a sermon but be it but becomes the thrust of a ministry of this man ministry but the bride ministry you know it's time that we stand up and and we say the Bride of Christ has suffered through the ages and then we've continued to suffer right now even to this time and we've suffered through pains of thoughts doctrine in this message we've suffered through pains of Kingdom building we are we're men for selfish gain of salt to beat abiding to conquer but it's time it is the hour for the bride estab I'll be healed be restored and see that see that manifestation of that word coming the power haven't we learned are we are we now ready to be commissioned and see the Spirit move are we ready now to be the revival you said brother Tim the satan has just really hit us a great blow here it says I didn't say what Satan's do and I said what are you ready to do are you ready to become the revival amen are we ready to see the spirit move or we're on the edge of the move of God and it's already happening you know you had miracle after miracle you had a blinding crowd this platform you've seen God in your midst way too we've seen God in your midst it's not just a oh yeah a church thing it's a universal thing not just happening here is happening around the world and you're listening to me tonight it can happen in your church is getting the right atmosphere start believing I just want you to know the winds of change are in the air [Music] when I looked out my study window I see a big pear tree we're further south than you are I've got a big pear tree in it's in full bloom daffodils that popped up everywhere there are signs of wear [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and the winds of change are in yeah have we got rid of our own ideas are we ready for to be the revival what are these years taught us like I said the church in general is still operating on since knowledge instead of faith since knowledge is see taste smell fill in here by now we should be a people who look to the unseen instead of what we see around us we're hearing awful things we are seeing awful things come on now but now we gotta quit operating by sense knowledge and start operating by looking into the unseen because the healing that we're looking for is not something that can be done with since knowledge it is something that can only be done by dealing with the unseen a demon you can't see remember is alive but the ron was telling me you know when they they've took him into the the surgery and said look here and what's this said it that you know it'll help you keep distracted as they look and he said what's the eddy and he's going toward that cancer with that needle he said once these things are alive and he said they would jump and they would move away and they would have to chase them around to be able to poke into them because they're a living creature they're a demon and they seek a body and they don't want to be cast out and they scream and they get tormented when they get cast out but we're like Jesus we're here to torment Devils before their time because we have been called to be serpent bruza meters over covers in this hour the people who know their God and do exploits was preaching the greatest battle ever fought and I pay real close attention to visions and dreams of brother Brian will not really meditate on them and think about them and what's the details as you would watch them but in this dream he tells of a dream in the greatest battle ever fought in this dream he saw his former trainer which was six-second Smith and he said I I I actually fought fifteen professional bouts and he said then left it and went to the ministry this dream he was watching Smith fight fellows that was much younger than himself and Smith was smashing him down throwing him out of the ring and the young guys just couldn't stand up against the old trainer and in this in this dream he remarks to his wife which represents the church that Smith was his first trainer and and soul as he would tell later in and one of the next following sermons at Jeffersonville he would tell this dream again this time he would call it a vision because now he's got some interpretation because a a dream when it's interpreted is a vision yeah so then you know he said that he tells again about George Smith my first trainer and he said he was more than a match for any of the young people in the land today in his fighting and he said that was my first training in the prayer lines and this whole sermon was about trained soldiers who stand in holder positions like the stars of heaven who never moved from the course and then he tells us exactly what we were to do he said now the devil is sitting right at Everhart this morning and he's sitting there like this little girl's heart a little girl that was sick with cancer there he's sitting at your heart she's sitting running he's saying oh I've seen you try before I've heard that before he said cast him out that's all cast him out what the Bible say here are takes casting him out that's right cast him out we have been trained a man and he said I think what's the matter was i spree Church he said I wonder what kind of training we've had God's training for this great battle of Matthew 24 it said there and Daniel 12 said there would be a time of trouble such as like never on the earth before and we're living that time with culture and education and things have smothered over the Word of God and got into reasoning and the battle is now who will stand the battle is ready to go in she's an array and look what a great opposition we got younger who will be like David you stand and let that uncircumcised philistine defy the armies of the Living God I'll go fight him God wants men and women this morning who will rise up and say I'll take the Lord at his word no matter what fail worth this or dad or what that one did that has nothing to do with it you solves and so forth if you're afraid of them get back where you belong but God's army is moving forward a madman the power men of faith men of power our men of understanding they don't have to be smart they don't have to be educated they have to be channels Amen God take these little channels and it's a preacher that's whole time get your channels cleaned out we're God can use you get dad out of there get beer out of there a man getting let the word flow through freely through you hey man it's got to come down in your heart and anchor there but it can't stay in the heart it's got to come out of your mouth because when it comes out of your mouth the Holy Spirit follows that word and makes it come to pass and no word of his will return unto Him Boyd but he will accomplish what he said to do and he showed that this training of the younger man won't stand up against the enemy I'm going to talk through your personal hair we should have learned by now that doctrine without power won't work mechanics without dynamics won't work confessions of faith without experience will not produce Christians Amen haven't we learned that easy believe ISM won't work and neither will just emotion the emotion is fine but we won't results with it hey man yes you see we can't work it up we're getting shout it down come on hey man you know many of you probably have watts you probably watch to sister Lana in our church you know when she had their victory lap around the church a couple of times was she sitting there and were you aware but the Holy Spirit got ahold of her and I'll tell you what you know the next day she goes back absolutely no cancer and I've seen other people run around the church and it was just exercise you can't reproduce it you can't produce it on your ownself and then you got to move in some spirit moves you can't you can't just you know well this worked here you know we'll try it again it won't work that way you've got to have exactly the right word for the right moment for the right hour and you got to be a channel where the God can flow through you hey man so I just want to say that the this new training ain't gonna work the psychology that's been preached around the message don't save people and keep them saying come on hey man you know preach and doctrine without and without power without miracles is not true doctrine through doctrine will have miracles if we preach the word signs follow the word and the Lord went with them confirming the word that they spoke with signs following it's a part of the gospel no it is an emotion but I remember the emotion of it when my daughter Lydia stood and grabbed her suffering baby Jude who had a kidney that was gonna have to be removed because it was dead and it would not operate and there that was it was going to take that that kidney out of that non-functioning kidneys that the doctors were thinking of removing and one morning as the Holy Spirit moved I remember the emotion of it when she grabbed that baby in her arms and run down to the altar and said dad pray for this child the doctors are saying they're gonna have to take out its kidneys and there this baby had never wet a diaper all night long would wake up every morning with a dry diaper because of a kidney problem are you with me hey man I remember the emotion of it I remember when we prayed and I remember the next morning when the baby had a wet diaper [Music] and I remember when she took attack to the doctor and the doctor examines that ain't nothing wrong with this baby we must remain a mistake I said there was no mistake we had God on the scene I remember another sufferer Aaron Oglesby that big tall man ran down the alter one day and surrendered his life to God and God filled with the Holy Ghost I remember I remember the emotion of it but also seeing the results of the power of God living in a life hallelujah I remember the emotion of it when that suffers sister Karen there stood on the promise and there did you what catch my key word stood lydia stood Aaron stood Karen now stands she stood on the promise and then had her visitation it didn't look good we could not go by since knowledge we had to look at the unseen and I stood in that hospital that day with my children and thank god I've got four godly children I'm blessed I know that it's just grace wasn't not the anything that I did it was His grace that's what he did if I did if I did anything it was him working through me but anyway I stood there with my children my son-in-law sandwi daughter and we got her down in the in the ICU Roy waiting room doctors had said they'd bring bleeds like this yes it don't look hopeful but I remember the emotion of it as I stood there that day am I said okay one thing we're gonna do is we're not gonna fear this is what we're gonna do we're going to believe because that's what we do we are believers and believers believe but you know don't you get this and this is very important because there can be ups and downs but you got to stay steady healing many times there's a process and it comes in stages I want you to get this I don't know how this will be I don't know how this will turn out I'm believing we got a miracle but even even healing is a miracle now I'm going to say for some of you that don't believe in medicine I'm going to stop here just for a minute because you should have been stripped of that long time ago of you to listen to the tapes instead of holding on your old ideas or whatever it was Pentecost whatever it was and got watched let me just say this there are four living creatures before the throne there's a lion the Ox man and the eagle these are nine teens they would anoint their principal part is to anoint the bride down to the aegis the verse soon starts out in the first age overlaps into the second is the lion anointing and it produced great faith and great great power and the roar of the lion isn't a bonus of a lion and the tenacity to hold on to the promise the over power of the enemy and then of course there's the Ox anointing were that it would change from that to where they would die and and go down into death and greater Rorick things would happen under them under that anointing and it would take great persecution and go down into death then there would be the man anointing and God wouldn't use modern inventions actually the Gutenberg press and and he would print the Bible in the language the common language of the people which at that time was a German the German under Luther's move and they they brought it out of the cloisters of and the dark places the caves of Roman and then they take some print the Bible put it in the language of the common people instead of Latin and bring it our Greek or some foreign language put it right down into the common language of the people Germany German and they and it would bring such a Liberty and bring such a deliverance and it was to posed a black horse rider that was coming out you know selling the very gospel itself measured weep for the penny measure or for penny and so on like that and so it would it would do that and then and then then God would use then the Eagle anointing for the last days and we believe we're under that an eagle anointing and the eagle and the eagle this is wonderful he never has to worry about crossing the river all of the other beasts aligned the man and the ox are earthbound creatures but the eagle can fly into other dimensions and in say was a sitting duck said he was a flying eagle hey man and the very word rapture meat comes from the Greek word for pazzo which means to snatch or to seize and carry away amen so it is the coming of the Lord where he will catch away that's harpazo cat's away seize grasp and pull them right out it'll be a miracle right in the nick of time take a bride out of here in the glory right out of the problems right out of the world right out of the sin around us somebody's still with me so you gotta you got these all of these not when it comes down to natural applications to divine healing because they are they're healing God sometimes will anoint us with great faith like a lion and a great boldness and tenacity to hold on to the word and you know it it may take a time for for the enemy to die but it's gonna come to this death because we're fighting it out amen you come over on the other end of the speculum it's the Eagle heat that's the miracle and it's not as you write at one moment you're in this situation next moment you're out of it that's a miracle there's there's other times that God uses he uses the the man the unmanned anointing and God says I'm going to heal you but I'm going to use man I'm going to use knowledge I'm going to use doctors I'm going to use medicine but they can't heal you because I am the Lord God that heals all diseases is somebody with me medicine can heal doctors can heal but they can insist medicine use it well brother damn I believe that God can heal without medicine soda ah I preferred that way any man I love it that way when it comes and we didn't take even appeal right hey man III preferred that way that's wonderful actually I would have preferred when I come here not to have to get in the airplane I hate him I would rather the Lord just pick me up and set me and brother Ron's house he can do it he did it with villa we got one example in the Bible where God did it we got hundreds of examples where he healed so you see so you see again sometimes God says all right but I'm turning the face of the anointing this way and I'm gonna use doctors I'm gonna use medicine I'm gonna use that sometimes you know we don't like to talk about this one but God heals by death brother Tim you know we have faithless and these all died in faith Hebrews 11 you see he heals all diseases man that's why we can save the sufferer Christine sister Christine Spencer you know stood and was healed moved into a new body a greater divine healing God took her right out of suffering right into his presence and it's real he heals all diseases it doesn't matter if he uses the line the Ox the man or the eagle he heals all he with me so far so anyway as I said I remember the emotion of it that night when sister Karen was Derek in the room now here here I told her I spoke under the anointing right there it just came out of my mouth it's like sometimes you just don't have any power over your tongue and they just spoke out of me I said she'll be in IC room tonight tomorrow night she will be in her own room and the next night she'll be at home in her own bed and it happened just that way oh thank you say she was healed brother damn and yeah it had begun but she was still weak she's unable to dress herself I have to take her to the shower I had to help her get dressed hi again she was unable to do regular work she was there in her home later she lost the peripheral vision was borned could not see you when you walked up to her side she had to look just directly at you to be able to see doctor said well you know some special glasses and that's not you know we there's some hope here you know to not ever see like she could see but you know she'll we can fix some of that so she's laying on her bed after about a week of this and she's thinking about what her life is gonna be like from now on and we're human at least I am and my family we're human and she was feeling sorry for herself and she was thinking about her future and what it would be like and what you know the state that she was in and and and and it felt very hopeless and all of a sudden she began to think about the Lord and she began to look into the unseen began to thank him for all his many blessings begin to praise him and as he as what's now as the atmosphere changed what's what I'm saying as the atmosphere changed the Holy Spirit moved down into that room come right there over her her vision returned in that moment and a little crippled child 18 months old who had never walked brother Ron had seen him in a vision walkin but he had still never walked and then Bethany had just set him down at the end of the bed not where he could reach anything just right in the middle of the floor as she walked into the room and the Holy Spirit swept through and her mother she recognized her mother could see her mother you can see your visions coming back you saw me as I walked up and and as the Holy Spirit will rush down through there and moved around into that house and come around and swept over that child it got up out of the middle of the floor and ran all over my house [Applause] and all that was wonderful that was marvelous but she still had a high blood pressure she still had some other problems and she still her blood pressure was spiking on her and we were concerned about not took her back to the doctor and you know he was trying to tell us what - you know what medicines - taken dis nothin so on I denounced we're gonna have a prayer line on Wednesday night she was still weak I decided to come back she was still weak Thomas are you listening she was sitting in the chemical recliner right back there in my study I'm brother Wayne Lawson had come I just announced we're having a prayer line winds tonight he was working on the dozer all day and he come in and jump changed clothes and we were going to church that night he preached and together we had I called a prayer line and and there as as as we were praying and I saw the holy spirit that was fear began to get right is somebody with me some things I'm very important things I'm talking to you about atmosphere standing hope you're connecting the dots getting the picture and there as as he was as he as we were praying I saw the spirit moving I went out and I got that sufferer that was in a recliner back in my room laying down and and you know she said I'll just stay home tonight I said no no no we're out of the prayer line tonight they went and put them in cots and brother Brandon's meeting we put you in a chair you're coming to church we're gonna see God move tonight and so he had that prayer line and thereby brought her at him the Holy Spirit was moving that suffer was still weak and was still having high blood pressure and terrible headaches we brought that week and he suffer into that line she was pretty far and she was healed in that moment and stood on her feet until midnight praising God I tried to tell this here while back and I didn't get through with it but we were in Germany some people wonder why I went to the Rings you know it not kind of home for a preacher I don't know what Bible verse study is but I was got a letter from a guy the other day and said you know you brother Tim um they're asking about your ring you know it's Satanists that wears a ring on that finger not sitting well I'm not a Satanist I said um I'll tell you why were the ring well you know my wife had been going through horrible menopause and some really emotional difficult times where everything in life was upside down and this is what it brought on the brain bleed because that caused high blood pressure which caused a wee you know bursting of a blood vessel and and so on like that and and and and you know and even now she's been healed and she's back to normal and she's doing her work but she still she says still having these horrible emotional situations and so we we go to Germany and I'm preaching there in the meeting we're in very difficult times there's some men there that are in some that are in a cult following a cult preacher and they they there was some of them that was even speaking in that meeting and I was I was ministering there I you know I there were things I was preaching that was dealing with different situations and then we had a man that you know got up from the cult preaching and he began to you know he looked right down at me and told me you know put your notes down and get with me and whatever cuz I was writing for one false doctor after another false doctor another doctor after another false doctor and he says he looked at me it's kind of like looking looking back I'm looking back at one of you aligned right straight through where there was nobody and he look right down at me and he says you know you know you you put down your notes and get with me I said and then he was saying if you don't get on our train you're gonna miss the rapture listen I'm getting on your train to go nowhere so after the service I gathered some of them guys and we have a good here sometimes you don't see what goes on behind the scenes but I'll tell you what I had my sword out and sometimes I use a sword it's a slice and cut and sometimes I just spank with it but I was using the Word of God and I was dealing with some of those and my wife you know had heard some of these about some of these people and their meanness and how they treated and did and she got real nervous she went to her room and she was crying all through the night and I was out 2 2 o'clock in the morning and she was just an emotional basket case and and all nervous and whatever from this hormonal issues that just pushed everything over the over the edge and you know I I went into the room and I had to calm her down and talk to her and pray with her and we finally get to bed and and brother Ron and brother Frasier is going through some deals he's not able to come to meet and say jeomsun kind of late and he comes in for the meeting and and he begins to preach and and he says you know he talks about sister Karen and her healing and little drew and different things and and then he says you know God's going to God's going to finish the work that he started and he walks down he pulls sister Guerin and prays for her and from that moment there was no more hormonal issue no more hormone medicine totally me well you know when I got married it was in 1975 somebody sort of said bless her heart but I bought a little ring for her it was constant 98 dollars we scraped for every penny we could get she bought a ring for me for $48 little gold simple ban about 25 years aboard later hid had worn thin that broke she said I want to get you a nicer ring this one's right here is I don't know a little over $500 ring someone will get you a nicer ring I wasn't able to get you know we wasn't able to get a nice ring then I'll get you a ring that one's broke so I took that one and laid it in a box put this one on my wart and it was too big for this finger and my board he was too big for this finger and he kept sliding around has got grooves in it and it was eating him to my finger and wasn't comfortable it was irritating and I finally just have to try and for some months to wear it I said I reached and got my old ring out took it as jeweler and said fix this thing and he repaired it and I took this ring put it in the box and put my original ring on and went on but when I come home from that meeting I passed by that box and I looked over at it and I thought as I looked at that ring and I said you know what I got a new wife God gave me a new wife she's healed delivered brain bleed high blood pressure nervousness hormone situation all gone I got a new wife so I reached in there and I got that ring out of my box and then tried it on that finger and it wouldn't work and so I tried it on that finger that ringer there that finger and that fit and so I we're dissing because this is before menopause and the way this one plugs his afternoon [Music] what I want you to remind you if you're going through that God heals menopause too and you don't have to let the devil attach to it yeah somebody with me now you don't have to let the devil attach itself it's a natural thing in your life but God can bring you through it but I remember the emotion of it I remember the motion when that sufferer Justin we're cemented him a wayward boy living out in the world came running down to the church in the middle of the night of that prayer line right 20 minutes after his sister had come through the line and said our family has separated my brother's out in the world and in sin and and and I want my brother back hey man and it wasn't just noise and shouting and then there was something that happened in that atmosphere is that boy come to church in his pajamas somebody with me James will of God wind got him out of bed and brought him to the house of God and here he comes back turning the church on the arms of the Deacons and they bring him down to the altar and we pray him through to the Holy Ghost amen that's been four or five years ago now and he's a young married man a man still delivered I'm just telling you it ain't emotion this emotion there's a pattern [Applause] hallelujah amen I remember in that trailer and also with a little boy Jed five years old had he been to the doctor that day had burned a hundred warts off of his body and the doctor says there's too many more and I cannot do them all in one session you'll have to bring him back after he heals up from this and bring him back to get some more burned off and she and that mother stood and brought her little boy through that prayer line and that night every wart fell off of his body [Applause] I remember the emotion at the morning service when I was preaching on the revealing of sons and I was saying God has done some extreme things in this generation and he's still doing extreme things tonight he is a God who of do extreme things to get his people to believe [Music] and God sits Malekith for with miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle to turn our hearts back to believe and again because God does extreme things and he will go to the extreme to save the Lost he'll go to the extreme to heal the sick this God is an extraordinary God who does extreme things hallelujah and as I was preaching that and we come to the end of the service and I started singing glory to his name and I changed it to leaning on the everlasting arms a little sister 90 pounds dying with lymphoma no type of limp on the cancer or cancer in the lungs is Hodgkin's disease that was in the lungs and she was dying and she sitting up in the mezzanine of our church with a mask over her face because she had had forked of 12 treatments that she was to have and she was on her fourth one and the next day that were to do PET scan her cat scan her some scan to just find out whether medicine was even working whether the cancer was still growing but in that atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that day that little girl stood mother of five children stood up in that mezzanine and she began to run around our building worshiping God shouting and praising him I don't even know how she had the strength to do it she made two laps around the the building went back and sat down in the mezzanine seating and worshiped God didn't for some some hours after that worshiping God and thanking God for his healing and he goes back to the doctor the next day and she's watching the the nurse and the technician seeing what kind of reaction and she has and she can't read nothing she's just done face and she doesn't show any emotion so she don't know what to think in here the doctor comes in and he sits down and he says ma'am I don't know how to explain this but your cancer is gone [Music] and she's trying to wrap her mind around this you know and so she says whoa how often do you see these kind of results he said we've never seen these kind of results I remember the emotion with the prayer line when that sufferer Mariah Pruett stood with some bobby pins in her hands and she came there she wanted to wear hairpins again she had alopecia and all the hair had left her head she was a bald-headed little girl eyelashes lose a license good arm hair a leg hair every two all the hair is attacked and gone and then she is completely bald and she walks into the prayer line with her little three pens and she said I want to wear these and I remember the emotion of the moment but I also remember the results it wasn't just emotion her heritage in the Dro a man and here it all came back and today she has a full head of glory and I just want to say it's a representative of the Church of the Living God I believe God is restoring the glory to in spirit power and the Holy Spirit is not moving in the midst of us and there's a people standing on their feet restored and then people want me to be afraid of emotion afraid to rejoice I've been been stripped a long time ago of all my my ambition and my pride and I just say use me God is a tool to bring realization to this sinful cursed world that we're living in today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we've got a commission let's tell the Supper everywhere to stand and be evil what the wrong your name was called [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and seeing this finished fair and save this to the bride around the world I'm saying this everybody this is our message we have suffered long enough we have separately the agent is a rapture time it's a time for people to stand and be killed and our message this tool it's not just so suffer stand and be healed but as Timothy was to preach I am the resurrection and
