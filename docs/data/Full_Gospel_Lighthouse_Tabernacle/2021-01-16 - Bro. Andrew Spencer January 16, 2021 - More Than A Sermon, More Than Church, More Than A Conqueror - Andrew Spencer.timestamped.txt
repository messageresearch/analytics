[0:06] setting up in colorado
[0:08] a few months ago in a a little cabin
[0:12] i went and said to my son my wife my
[0:14] daughter-in-law
[0:15] and them last couple of hours something
[0:19] happened
[0:20] i saw a young lady a beautiful woman
[0:24] and she had kind of thick lips look like
[0:26] i saw her somewhere
[0:28] and she she was trying to get to a
[0:31] doctor
[0:33] and she died and the spirit that was
[0:36] speaking to me
[0:37] said now they will say
[0:42] that she committed suicide but she died
[0:45] with a heart attack
[0:47] and said it's just a little before four
[0:50] but you can say it was four o'clock and
[0:53] the vision left me
[0:54] i told him what did that mean i didn't
[0:56] know somebody's fixing a dime
[0:58] when we come out of the mountains two
[0:59] days later that the
[1:01] movie star what's that marilyn monroe
[1:05] she was kind of a scriptees or you read
[1:08] her story
[1:10] she was a illegitimate child her
[1:12] mother's in the insane institution
[1:14] poor little girl probably had a hard way
[1:17] and she
[1:18] always hungered for something i wish i
[1:20] could have got to her
[1:22] i know what she needed i knew what she
[1:26] needed yet she joined churches and
[1:27] everything
[1:28] but see it's just a ritualistic form she
[1:31] needed the application of the blood
[1:34] see now
[1:37] i guess there isn't a sex fiend in the
[1:40] country
[1:41] but what an older had her picture she's
[1:44] supposed the most perfect built woman as
[1:46] i understood
[1:47] there was in the world but if that
[1:51] anatomy is so great then watch
[1:54] when the life went out of her body
[1:58] they had to give her a number to lay in
[2:00] a room
[2:01] and nobody would claim her body
[2:06] so which is the important part the soul

[52:45] assembly in the church of the firstborn
[52:47] which are written in heaven
[52:49] and to god the judge of all and to the
[52:51] spirits of just men
[52:53] made perfect and to jesus a mediator of
[52:56] the new covenant and to the blood
[52:59] of sprinkling that speaketh better
[53:01] things than that of abel
[53:03] see that ye refuse not him that speaketh
[53:07] for if they escape not who refused him
[53:09] that spake on earth
[53:11] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[53:13] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[53:17] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[53:20] he
[53:20] hath promised saying yet once more i
[53:23] shake not the earth only but also heaven
[53:26] and this word yet once more signifies
[53:29] the removing of those things that are
[53:31] shaken
[53:32] as of things that are made that those
[53:35] things which cannot be shaken
[53:37] may remain wherefore we receiving a
[53:40] kingdom which cannot be moved
[53:43] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[53:46] god acceptably
[53:48] with reverence and godly fear for our
[53:51] god
[53:52] is a consuming fire i'll let you have
[53:55] your seats at this time
[53:57] amen also revelations chapter 12 and
[54:02] verse 7.
[54:08] if you don't know where it's at it's in
[54:09] the last book of the bible
[54:12] and there was war in heaven and michael
[54:15] and his angels fought against the dragon
[54:18] and the dragon fought against his angels
[54:21] i love this and prevailed not
[54:27] and prevailed not now notices neither
[54:30] was their fair their place found any
[54:33] more in heaven
[54:35] notice about all of these these these
[54:38] angels and the
[54:39] and the dragon and and all of the all of
[54:42] the things that are sitting here they
[54:44] prevailed not
[54:45] and their place was found where their
[54:48] their place was found no more in heaven
[54:51] and the greek dragon was cast out that
[54:53] old serpent called the devil and satan
[54:56] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[54:59] cast out into the earth
[55:01] and his angels were cast out with him
[55:04] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[55:06] heaven now
[55:06] is come salvation and strength
[55:10] and the kingdom of our god and the power
[55:12] of his christ
[55:13] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[55:16] down
[55:17] which accused them before our god day
[55:20] and night
[55:21] and they overcame him by the blood of
[55:23] the lamb that's you and me
[55:26] they overcame him by the blood of the
[55:27] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[55:30] and they love not their lives unto the
[55:32] death
[55:33] therefore rejoice ye heavens
[55:36] rejoice ye heavens rejoice ye heavens
[55:40] it's a battle right now we're in a
[55:42] battle for heavenly places
[55:44] but you uh you as the children of god
[55:47] have got a right to rejoice
[55:50] because the accuser of our brethren has
[55:52] been cast down and we overcome this
[55:55] enemy
[55:56] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[55:58] of our testimony
[55:59] therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[56:02] dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of
[56:05] the earth and of the sea
[56:06] for the devil has come down unto you
[56:09] having great wrath
[56:11] because he knoweth that he hath but a
[56:13] short time
[56:15] oh what a wonderful scripture reading
[56:17] this evening
[56:18] we know that that all of the heavens and
[56:21] even at this time that the heavens and
[56:23] the earth they are contaminated
[56:25] they're contaminated with devils that
[56:27] are always constantly there to accuse us
[56:31] before our brethren
[56:32] but noting noting these things that
[56:35] there is an accuser that is against us
[56:37] it is also something to note that jesus
[56:40] is
[56:40] always there to intercede on our behalf
[56:43] that when the enemy comes and says
[56:46] the they did this and they did that or
[56:49] this is what they did there is a blood
[56:51] that is there to intercede that that
[56:54] jesus is still on the mercy seat
[56:56] that is saying that satan the blood is
[56:59] against you
[57:00] and no matter what you accuse them of
[57:03] the blood
[57:04] is bigger than all of your accusations
[57:07] no matter what you've been through in
[57:09] life the blood is bigger than what you
[57:11] did
[57:12] can we say amen that the blood is bigger
[57:15] than all that we've done in our past and
[57:17] all the things that will happen to us
[57:19] in our future the blood is bigger
[57:23] the blood is bigger than anything that
[57:26] we could imagine this evening
[57:30] now i'd like to speak to you on a
[57:32] thought
[57:33] on more than a sermon more than a church
[57:37] and more than conquerors now if we would
[57:41] if we would take time and just begin to
[57:43] reflect upon the power of a sermon
[57:46] you know as all the preaching that we
[57:48] could do
[57:49] sitting here and many hours have been
[57:52] spent of your life
[57:52] setting and listening to the preaching
[57:54] of the word but notice
[57:56] no matter what kind of speech is being
[57:59] given if
[57:59] if if all it is is just a speech then
[58:02] that's all it is
[58:04] but of all the preaching and all the all
[58:06] of the things it's just
[58:08] it's just speaking just like an
[58:10] auctioneer would be speaking or
[58:12] or a great orator would be speaking it
[58:15] would have no value and it would have no
[58:17] backup unless god backs up what the man
[58:21] of god
[58:22] is saying you see if if all we take
[58:25] of the preaching of the word is it's
[58:27] just words
[58:28] then there's no power to it but if god
[58:31] comes behind that man that is preaching
[58:34] that word
[58:35] and proves that that word is true and
[58:38] then the people still out there
[58:40] choose to disbelieve what the man of god
[58:42] has said when it's been proven
[58:44] then it is sin but notice that when god
[58:48] comes behind that word
[58:50] it's no longer a man speaking but then
[58:53] it becomes thus saith the lord to you
[58:57] you remember as i was in my study
[58:59] several several weeks ago and i told you
[59:01] that god was
[59:02] was allowing me to work on a subject and
[59:05] when it when it was the time that i
[59:06] would release that now
[59:08] now this is the time that god has
[59:10] decided that he would allow me to speak
[59:12] these things
[59:13] but i was in my i was in my study and
[59:16] you remember that i was praying
[59:18] god i ask that you give me more than a
[59:21] sermon
[59:22] because we are very acquainted with
[59:24] sermons we can never get tired of
[59:26] running out of sermons
[59:27] but i was praying god i want something
[59:30] more
[59:30] than just a sermon we want more than
[59:33] just church service we want
[59:35] more than just a good time at church we
[59:38] want life to come
[59:39] and i heard these words you keep
[59:42] stacking word on top of word
[59:44] and building cell on top of sale and it
[59:47] doesn't look like the body may be moving
[59:50] but you just keep stacking word on top
[59:52] of word
[59:53] and sail on top of sale and that body
[59:56] will move
[59:59] now i i figure in my my space of
[1:00:02] the life span that i've had here on
[1:00:04] earth for 33 years
[1:00:06] and i've spent most of my life i've
[1:00:08] spent most of my life in church services
[1:00:11] and i was doing some calculations i've
[1:00:13] been
[1:00:14] and what i can calculate over 5 000 live
[1:00:17] services in my lifetime and still not
[1:00:21] enough
[1:00:22] there's still a whole lot of work to do
[1:00:24] on this guy
[1:00:26] but i've been a part of some of the most
[1:00:27] powerful services
[1:00:29] that's ever been on the face of this
[1:00:30] earth
[1:00:32] and so have you
[1:00:36] i've i've been in over 5 000 live
[1:00:38] services in my lifetime
[1:00:40] i've heard some of the greatest some of
[1:00:42] the greatest men on earth
[1:00:44] give some of the most powerful sermons
[1:00:47] i've listened
[1:00:48] over thousands of tapes i've read
[1:00:50] scripture on top of scripture
[1:00:52] i've read quote on top of quote i've
[1:00:55] said here and i've listened to some of
[1:00:57] the greatest
[1:00:58] men of this world that have preached
[1:01:00] this message and to me
[1:01:01] the world doesn't hold a candle to what
[1:01:03] the preachers of this message preach
[1:01:06] but i have said and i have heard sermon
[1:01:08] after sermon
[1:01:10] where men of god begin to glorify god
[1:01:12] and you begin to watch as that man would
[1:01:14] glorify god
[1:01:16] and he would whip the devil every which
[1:01:17] way but every which way but up
[1:01:21] and yet in all of our life
[1:01:24] we still want more of it
[1:01:28] in all of the preaching that we've done
[1:01:30] we still yearn for more for all of the
[1:01:32] hearing that we hear
[1:01:33] we still long for more but i know that
[1:01:37] that at one point in my life that i was
[1:01:39] on a total different course
[1:01:41] than what it looks like that i was on
[1:01:43] today i was on my own
[1:01:45] path of life doing my own thing i was
[1:01:47] walking my own way
[1:01:49] at one point in my life i wanted to be a
[1:01:51] rodeo clown
[1:01:53] it's a far-fetched from where i am today
[1:01:57] but when i found out that brother
[1:01:58] timothy pruitt also had the same longing
[1:02:01] in life to be a rodeo clown i thought
[1:02:03] it's a match made in heaven but yet
[1:02:06] in all of that in all of that and when i
[1:02:09] was walking my way
[1:02:10] full-heartedly there was something on
[1:02:13] the inside of me
[1:02:14] that was pulling me in a total different
[1:02:17] direction
[1:02:18] and when i started to push with
[1:02:20] everything i had
[1:02:21] to run after my way the magnitation
[1:02:25] of the power of god and redemption began
[1:02:28] to pull me
[1:02:29] his way when i was pulling everything
[1:02:32] within my own self to get
[1:02:34] away from this word and get away from
[1:02:36] this
[1:02:37] i'd heard sermon on top of sermon i'd
[1:02:39] heard message on top a message
[1:02:41] but one day when i heard the voice of
[1:02:43] the living god
[1:02:45] calling out my name there was nothing on
[1:02:47] the inside of these 16 elements
[1:02:49] that could hold me back from going to
[1:02:52] that voice
[1:02:53] and i say to the church of the living
[1:02:55] god for your children
[1:02:57] and for your prodigals and for your sons
[1:03:00] and for your daughters
[1:03:02] don't you ever give up hope that when
[1:03:04] god
[1:03:05] goes to calling and when god goes to
[1:03:07] speak and
[1:03:08] if they are his they will come
[1:03:12] if they are still without the holy ghost
[1:03:14] if they're his
[1:03:16] he'll fill them and the same way with
[1:03:19] you sitting here tonight
[1:03:21] though you may be sitting here without
[1:03:23] the unction of the holy ghost
[1:03:24] though you may be sitting here without
[1:03:26] the anointing of almighty god upon your
[1:03:28] life
[1:03:29] you can walk out of here tonight
[1:03:33] with the same power that was there in
[1:03:36] the beginning
[1:03:37] that spoke worlds into existence that
[1:03:40] rode the worlds right off of his
[1:03:41] fingertips
[1:03:42] that same power wants to live in an
[1:03:45] earthen vessel
[1:03:47] and take over your life where you no
[1:03:49] longer live your own life
[1:03:51] that you could say like paul live the
[1:03:53] life that i once live
[1:03:55] that thing's in the past but the life
[1:03:58] that i now live
[1:04:01] hallelujah notice he says and what it
[1:04:05] takes to overcome all
[1:04:06] unbelief is our faith he said now
[1:04:09] there's a time that a man can come to a
[1:04:11] place
[1:04:12] where he can have a purpose it's
[1:04:15] something that will change him
[1:04:17] and that is when a man meets god a man
[1:04:20] can never be the same
[1:04:22] if he ever meets god face to face it
[1:04:26] will change him
[1:04:27] in spite of anything that you can do
[1:04:30] about it
[1:04:31] a man can never be the same after he
[1:04:33] once
[1:04:34] meets god now that's the truth now i
[1:04:37] want you to pay
[1:04:38] very special attention you know the
[1:04:40] subject that i'm speaking on
[1:04:41] but i want you to hear this word change
[1:04:45] that when you when you allow god to
[1:04:48] change your life that you're no longer
[1:04:49] the same
[1:04:50] and once you meet god you're no longer
[1:04:52] the same and that's
[1:04:54] the power of a sermon
[1:04:57] i'm going to give you a few trade
[1:04:59] secrets tonight
[1:05:00] that that the point of a sermon is not
[1:05:03] so that
[1:05:04] we get up here and we sound floweredly
[1:05:06] like we spent hours and study like we
[1:05:08] have
[1:05:09] but the power of a sermon is to see an
[1:05:12] earthen vessel changed
[1:05:14] no matter if it's healing no matter if
[1:05:16] it's sickness no matter if it's
[1:05:17] deliverance
[1:05:18] no matter no matter what the case is the
[1:05:21] point
[1:05:22] of a sermon is that you walk out of here
[1:05:24] changed
[1:05:25] and if this sermon don't change you it
[1:05:28] is completely in vain
[1:05:34] you know oftentimes as christians we
[1:05:36] come to church
[1:05:38] and we enjoy the preaching of the word
[1:05:48] we enjoy sermons
[1:05:51] we enjoy worshiping but many times we
[1:05:55] don't see
[1:05:57] the sermon for what it really is
[1:06:01] you hear a topic you hear a title but
[1:06:04] you don't really recognize the power
[1:06:07] of that sermon of what it really is
[1:06:10] and you'll hear us say now now don't
[1:06:12] take this service as just another
[1:06:14] service
[1:06:15] you see because many don't see the value
[1:06:19] of that sermon i'm not just preaching
[1:06:22] about this one but i'm preaching about
[1:06:24] every sermon
[1:06:26] this will help you this will help you
[1:06:28] when you're sitting there and you feel
[1:06:30] like
[1:06:30] man i could be somewhere else
[1:06:33] my stomach's growling i wish i ate the
[1:06:36] snickers before i came in here
[1:06:38] this sermon will help you tonight
[1:06:42] many times you walk in and you think
[1:06:45] this
[1:06:45] is just another service this is brother
[1:06:47] andrew again this is this is brother ron
[1:06:49] again this is
[1:06:50] this is brother william brother matthew
[1:06:52] these other men of god
[1:06:53] and many times you don't see the value
[1:06:55] of that sermon
[1:06:57] many people don't realize what it cost
[1:07:00] to preach a sermon they don't understand
[1:07:03] the life work that is behind this sermon
[1:07:06] now
[1:07:07] for this particular sermon i have been
[1:07:09] studying and grabbing and
[1:07:11] preparing for this sermon for over four
[1:07:13] weeks now
[1:07:14] but in this sermon you will hear things
[1:07:17] that have been taken me
[1:07:19] my whole life to grab out
[1:07:22] to grab that revelation it didn't just
[1:07:25] come in four weeks or it didn't just
[1:07:27] come in an hour
[1:07:28] and many times an audience doesn't grasp
[1:07:32] what is really transpiring in that
[1:07:34] sermon
[1:07:36] they don't understand the cause they
[1:07:39] don't understand the prayer
[1:07:40] that the pastors prayed they don't
[1:07:42] understand the struggles of
[1:07:44] of the people of god and then they don't
[1:07:47] understand
[1:07:48] the power of a word that was spoken at a
[1:07:51] right season
[1:07:52] to know that when that man got the
[1:07:54] utterance of the holy ghost
[1:07:56] to drop that sermon that anointed it
[1:07:58] with a spark of fire
[1:08:06] many times when you're sitting and you
[1:08:08] hear a sermon
[1:08:11] ask yourself why
[1:08:14] why is this sermon being released at
[1:08:15] this time
[1:08:17] you ever looked at a painting and looked
[1:08:19] at that painting said now
[1:08:20] now what did that artist what captured
[1:08:23] in his
[1:08:24] mind that would make him paint
[1:08:27] this portion of maybe a scripture or a
[1:08:30] place in the world
[1:08:32] what would capture him what would
[1:08:34] inspire him
[1:08:35] that he would draw out this painting and
[1:08:37] depict
[1:08:38] things in a certain way now you'll watch
[1:08:40] and you'll look at some people
[1:08:42] how that they paint jesus walking on the
[1:08:44] water and they'll grab from a different
[1:08:46] spot
[1:08:47] maybe they're grabbing from john or
[1:08:49] maybe they're grabbing from mark
[1:08:51] and they're catching separate spots but
[1:08:54] it's meaning something to them
[1:08:56] and they're trying to get your attention
[1:08:59] to look at the picture and when a sermon
[1:09:03] is coming forth
[1:09:04] why is that man preaching that why is he
[1:09:07] so moved
[1:09:08] why is he so passionate about what he's
[1:09:11] speaking
[1:09:14] we don't want to just hear the sermon we
[1:09:17] want to hear the inspiration of that
[1:09:19] sermon
[1:09:20] we want to really hear what god is
[1:09:23] saying
[1:09:24] behind the words it's more than my voice
[1:09:29] it's more than me standing behind this
[1:09:31] pulpit
[1:09:32] it's about hearing the voice behind the
[1:09:35] voice
[1:09:39] now i'm going to read you a quote here
[1:09:42] just a minute
[1:09:44] now a minister cannot bring a revival
[1:09:46] himself it takes god to send that
[1:09:49] revival
[1:09:50] it takes people his people who are
[1:09:53] willing
[1:09:54] to congregate themselves together and
[1:09:56] pray then he said i would hear from
[1:09:58] heaven
[1:09:59] if the people that are called by my name
[1:10:02] shall assemble themselves together and
[1:10:04] pray
[1:10:05] then he would hear from heaven and he
[1:10:08] would heal them
[1:10:09] and we know that his promises are true
[1:10:15] now this is more this is more than just
[1:10:18] catching this quote
[1:10:20] but if you'll go and look at where the
[1:10:22] prophet
[1:10:23] is speaking this he is not speaking this
[1:10:26] just anywhere
[1:10:27] but he is dropping this in his very
[1:10:30] first words
[1:10:31] that he's speaking right here in
[1:10:33] harrisonburg virginia
[1:10:36] and he is saying to a people
[1:10:39] within his very first words he starts
[1:10:41] dropping
[1:10:42] the power of a new birth the power the
[1:10:45] power of a people
[1:10:47] that if they would go to worshipping god
[1:10:50] that if you begin to call on his name
[1:10:53] and begin to congregate in his name
[1:10:55] now notice when this sermon is being
[1:10:58] released
[1:10:59] in 1958 right out here at the armory
[1:11:02] in harrisonburg virginia the building's
[1:11:04] still standing today
[1:11:05] there's many a people that are no longer
[1:11:08] connected
[1:11:08] with this message there were people that
[1:11:11] were there that
[1:11:12] are long gone but there are people
[1:11:15] sitting here today
[1:11:17] that knew that the minister didn't pack
[1:11:20] the revival
[1:11:21] it was a people that got on fire for god
[1:11:26] that begin to get under the anointing of
[1:11:28] the lord
[1:11:29] and they are the people the revival
[1:11:32] don't start here
[1:11:34] the sermon don't start here it starts in
[1:11:37] your home
[1:11:38] the revival don't start here the revival
[1:11:41] starts in your home
[1:11:44] oh hallelujah you see why full gospel
[1:11:47] lighthouse
[1:11:48] is the way she is it's because there is
[1:11:51] a people
[1:11:51] that know how to pray there is a people
[1:11:54] that know how to worship
[1:11:56] there is a people that know how to call
[1:11:59] on god
[1:12:11] it's more than a sermon
[1:12:14] now you see when a man of god comes with
[1:12:16] the word of god
[1:12:19] you can amend me tonight it won't scare
[1:12:21] me
[1:12:23] when a man comes with the word of god
[1:12:26] he's not just coming with scriptures
[1:12:28] he's not just coming with quotes
[1:12:30] he's coming with a thought he's coming
[1:12:33] with a message
[1:12:35] when that man of god gets so inspired
[1:12:38] that god would allow him
[1:12:40] to grab a hold of a of a scripture maybe
[1:12:42] it's one scripture
[1:12:44] maybe it's one quote that god so anoints
[1:12:47] this man of god
[1:12:48] to grab and go in there and maybe he'll
[1:12:51] grab that diamond
[1:12:52] and turn it just a little bit away and
[1:12:54] you'll sit there and say
[1:12:56] i've never heard it like that before in
[1:12:59] all of my life
[1:13:01] but you see that man of god got inspired
[1:13:04] so that he could turn that diamond
[1:13:06] so that you could like get that diamond
[1:13:09] and you could see the power of that
[1:13:10] diamond
[1:13:11] you see the man of god knows that if he
[1:13:14] can allow the holy spirit to take over
[1:13:17] and he could allow the holy spirit to go
[1:13:20] to expressing
[1:13:21] the power of that sermon
[1:13:26] now there's many times i preach sermons
[1:13:28] sometimes i preach 30 minutes you don't
[1:13:30] remember them lately but sometimes
[1:13:32] there are times when i preach 30 minutes
[1:13:34] 45 minutes
[1:13:36] but what i'm watching for i'm not
[1:13:38] looking to run out of material when i'm
[1:13:39] preaching
[1:13:40] i never run out of material but what i'm
[1:13:42] looking for
[1:13:43] sometimes i've even had to preach an
[1:13:45] hour and a half so you get it
[1:13:48] but what i'm watching for i'm not
[1:13:51] watching for your emotion
[1:13:52] i'm not watching for you to get excited
[1:13:55] i'm not watching for your amends
[1:13:57] i'm not running out of material i'm
[1:13:59] watching
[1:14:00] when the people of god catch the
[1:14:02] inspiration
[1:14:04] of that message and then a people
[1:14:07] get so inspired that they catch the
[1:14:10] expression of the word
[1:14:11] and then they go and make it live
[1:14:14] can you imagine how god felt when he
[1:14:18] rolled the worlds off of his fingertips
[1:14:20] but then to watch his son adam go and
[1:14:23] take the same word
[1:14:24] and begin to speak the spoken word and
[1:14:27] control nature
[1:14:28] and control life and say hey
[1:14:31] he's getting it he's doing what i did
[1:14:35] now when a man of god gets so anointed
[1:14:38] and he realizes that it's no longer him
[1:14:41] that is more than a sermon that the
[1:14:43] people are catching
[1:14:44] what the man is saying hallelujah
[1:14:48] that it's no longer on pages that it's
[1:14:50] no longer on a tablet
[1:14:52] that it's no more in a book but it's in
[1:14:54] a life
[1:14:56] you see this message is no good unless
[1:15:00] you take it off the pages
[1:15:02] this sermon will be no good to you if
[1:15:05] you just walk out of here
[1:15:07] like you never heard it in your life but
[1:15:09] this message
[1:15:10] has the power to change your life if you
[1:15:14] catch the inspiration
[1:15:18] you see that man of god knows that he
[1:15:20] can turn that diamond
[1:15:21] and that diamond gets lit up on the
[1:15:23] inside of your soul
[1:15:25] you see a diamond shines its best when
[1:15:28] it's put against darkness
[1:15:29] and satan has tried to stop the light
[1:15:32] out of your life
[1:15:36] but that diamond has been placed and the
[1:15:39] light of the pillar of fire
[1:15:41] is visible to make the diamond shine
[1:15:46] i want to tell you church you're a real
[1:15:48] ruby
[1:15:49] you're a real jewel you're a real jewel
[1:15:52] in the queen of heaven
[1:15:53] as the queen of heaven you have all
[1:15:56] power
[1:16:00] hallelujah
[1:16:05] watching him in creation
[1:16:08] that's my son
[1:16:12] that's my son i watched him
[1:16:17] i watched him as he moved that tree for
[1:16:19] eve
[1:16:20] when it was blocking her view that's my
[1:16:22] son
[1:16:24] i watched my son as he began to control
[1:16:27] the wind as it was
[1:16:28] blowing eve's hair a little too much
[1:16:33] you have that same power you have that
[1:16:36] same power
[1:16:38] and now is the time when sons are being
[1:16:40] manifested
[1:16:42] when you as a people of god start taking
[1:16:44] this word
[1:16:45] and when the enemy comes blowing against
[1:16:47] your soul and it seems like you're
[1:16:49] having a bad hair day
[1:16:50] and the wind's blowing your hair every
[1:16:52] which way you have the power
[1:16:55] of the spoken word in your life to
[1:16:58] control the storms of your life
[1:17:00] and one of these days that same voice
[1:17:04] will cause this body to resurrect
[1:17:11] hallelujah we're not just a people
[1:17:13] that's running with something
[1:17:15] we're a people running with a message
[1:17:18] running under a ministry of malachi 4
[1:17:21] our hearts have been turned back to the
[1:17:23] faith of the pentecostal fathers
[1:17:25] our hearts are on fire we're running
[1:17:28] with a message of deliverance
[1:17:29] running with a message of healing
[1:17:31] running with a message of power
[1:17:33] and it will be this message that will
[1:17:36] change our bodies it's more than a
[1:17:40] message
[1:17:40] it's more than a sermon it's the life
[1:17:44] it's the life behind the sermon it's the
[1:17:47] life behind the picture
[1:17:50] sometimes all you see is a person that
[1:17:52] walks in
[1:17:53] and they walk in take their pew and they
[1:17:55] worship
[1:17:56] but you don't understand you don't
[1:17:59] understand the inspiration of their
[1:18:02] worship
[1:18:02] you don't understand the inspiration you
[1:18:05] don't understand what they went through
[1:18:10] where'd you get them scars yet
[1:18:14] where'd you get them scars at what made
[1:18:16] you this way
[1:18:17] what built you this way
[1:18:22] the music has got to be played out
[1:18:25] the sheet music has got to be played out
[1:18:29] and it may look like he's never going to
[1:18:32] look your way
[1:18:33] so that you can play your part but there
[1:18:35] is a god that created the sheet music
[1:18:38] and he knows when it's your part you
[1:18:40] stay steady
[1:18:42] this is more than just your average song
[1:18:45] this
[1:18:45] is more than just your average sermon
[1:18:48] you stay steady
[1:18:49] when the director turns his little he
[1:18:52] turns his little white stick
[1:18:54] and he starts pointing it your direction
[1:18:57] it's time for your miracle
[1:18:59] it's time for your healing
[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:05] hallelujah when the director looks your
[1:19:08] way
[1:19:08] it's your time church this is more than
[1:19:12] a sermon
[1:19:13] the director is looking your way it's
[1:19:16] your time to play the music
[1:19:23] hallelujah it's this
[1:19:26] it's this sheet music that's going to
[1:19:29] change our bodies
[1:19:30] there's a lot of people that didn't want
[1:19:32] to sheet music
[1:19:35] there's a lot of people that didn't want
[1:19:36] this message there's a lot of people
[1:19:39] that didn't want these sermons
[1:19:43] hallelujah i had some of my best friends
[1:19:45] in this life say hey i don't want no
[1:19:47] part of it

[1:19:50] this
[1:19:51] message that will change my body
[1:19:57] [Music]

[1:20:06] change in the bible

[1:20:09] english in the english
[1:20:12] you could catch it and it may not mean
[1:20:14] the same exact thing
[1:20:16] but there is one form of the greek word
[1:20:18] of change

[1:23:23] change
[1:23:24] this corruption has got to put on
[1:23:26] incorruption
[1:23:27] and this mortal has got to put on
[1:23:30] immortality
[1:23:31] and it's going to take more than a
[1:23:33] sermon to put me there
[1:23:35] it's gonna take the same life of the
[1:23:38] second adam
[1:23:39] living in my body
[1:23:43] it's gonna take more than just a normal
[1:23:45] sermon to get that power on the inside
[1:23:47] of you
[1:23:48] he's going to take that life where you
[1:23:50] die out to yourself
[1:23:51] and you allow him to come in and you
[1:23:54] have an experience
[1:23:55] that you know that you know that you
[1:23:58] know that he's there
[1:24:00] i got good news for you if you know that
[1:24:03] he's there
[1:24:04] you know he ain't leaving because he
[1:24:06] never puts his stamp
[1:24:07] of approval on anything unless he loves
[1:24:10] what he's looking at
[1:24:15] they say oh i'm so tore up i'm so
[1:24:18] fearful
[1:24:18] you know what fear is it's faith in the
[1:24:21] enemy
[1:24:22] and when you start listening to what the
[1:24:24] devil's got to say
[1:24:25] you're putting your faith in the enemy
[1:24:27] i've got no reason
[1:24:29] to fear and put my faith in the enemy i
[1:24:32] got every reason to believe
[1:24:34] what god has said i'm not gonna leave
[1:24:38] you
[1:24:39] i'm not gonna forsake you i'll be with
[1:24:41] you i'll be in you
[1:24:42] i'll change your body
[1:24:48] god's word is his absolute
[1:24:51] he's not obligated to your flesh
[1:24:54] but he is obligated to his word
[1:24:58] and when there's a deposit that has been
[1:25:00] made he's obligated to it
[1:25:04] you don't have to run from his word
[1:25:07] you let the enemy do that
[1:25:10] you don't have to get shook up on the
[1:25:12] timing
[1:25:14] the vision's for an appointed time it's
[1:25:15] going to take place
[1:25:18] come on somebody he said we'd be there
[1:25:22] don't get shook up hallelujah
[1:25:26] he's going to get me there because he's
[1:25:28] obligated to his word
[1:25:30] now jesus said in matthew 24
[1:25:33] that heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:25:35] my word
[1:25:36] will never pass away now if you look up
[1:25:39] that word pass away
[1:25:41] you can hear these things in future home
[1:25:43] it also means
[1:25:44] it also has a meaning of change and it
[1:25:47] means in the greek it is
[1:25:48] parashimi which means the passing
[1:25:51] from one to another it does not mean
[1:25:55] annihilate it does not mean totally
[1:25:57] destroyed
[1:25:58] but jesus said that heaven and earth
[1:26:00] will pass away
[1:26:02] they will pass away from one form to
[1:26:04] another
[1:26:05] but my word will never change from one
[1:26:08] form
[1:26:09] to another are you with me
[1:26:12] so we know that this earth has got to be
[1:26:15] changed
[1:26:16] before we come back to live in it in a
[1:26:18] millennium after the wedding supper of
[1:26:20] the lamb
[1:26:21] and it's going to take a holy fire
[1:26:23] brother branham said that that holy fire
[1:26:25] will come
[1:26:25] and it'll burn out the evil it'll burn
[1:26:28] out the politics hallelujah
[1:26:30] it'll go it'll create such a fire that
[1:26:32] the h2o
[1:26:33] will disintegrate in the air and the
[1:26:36] bible said that it will be a loud noise
[1:26:39] can you imagine the power of that fire
[1:26:41] when that fire gets to burning
[1:26:43] and that all the h2o gets so
[1:26:46] get so changed from one form to another
[1:26:50] you remember when isaiah was preaching
[1:26:52] in isaiah 65
[1:26:54] he was bringing to you a sermon about
[1:26:55] your homeland he's telling you that i'm
[1:26:58] going to create god's creating a new
[1:27:00] heaven
[1:27:00] and a new earth he's telling you that
[1:27:03] the lion will lay down with the lamb
[1:27:05] you see what god is doing he's creating
[1:27:07] a fire
[1:27:08] on top of this earth that is going to
[1:27:10] completely
[1:27:11] destroy with a holy fire all the sin
[1:27:15] all the iniquities all the devils on
[1:27:17] this place and you
[1:27:18] what is god doing he is building a place
[1:27:21] for his church to live for a thousand
[1:27:24] years
[1:27:26] and his word will not return void unto
[1:27:28] him but it will accomplish
[1:27:30] what he sent it to do i got good news
[1:27:32] for you
[1:27:33] you're going to be there his church is
[1:27:36] going to be there
[1:27:37] sister sarah you're going to be there
[1:27:40] and i got just enough enough confidence
[1:27:43] in his word
[1:27:43] that he said that our offspring will be
[1:27:46] there with him
[1:27:47] that means our prodigals will be there
[1:27:49] that means our sons will be there
[1:27:51] our daughters will be there our
[1:27:53] grandchildren will be there
[1:27:56] hallelujah he is obligated to
[1:28:00] his word you are serving a god
[1:28:04] that believes his own word and you're
[1:28:07] also serving a god that loves
[1:28:09] to display his power he likes to show
[1:28:12] his muscles
[1:28:13] now satan don't like it when god goes to
[1:28:15] showing and displaying his power
[1:28:18] you see because satan thinks he's got a
[1:28:19] lot of power
[1:28:21] but he was finished at calvary
[1:28:25] all of his power is nothing but a bluff
[1:28:28] all it is is words all it is
[1:28:32] is you can basically call satan a big
[1:28:35] win back
[1:28:37] all he is he's got words he's basically
[1:28:40] like a dog that's on a chain
[1:28:43] and he ain't got no teeth he can bark
[1:28:46] all he wants to
[1:28:47] but he can't bite you he's been lying on
[1:28:51] you
[1:28:51] all your life why turn around and start
[1:28:54] putting your faith in him
[1:28:58] hallelujah why it's a time that the
[1:29:01] people of god start living
[1:29:03] start living above their god-given
[1:29:05] privileges and stop
[1:29:06] living below them and recognizing who
[1:29:09] they are
[1:29:10] you are more than a church
[1:29:13] it took more than a sermon to get you
[1:29:15] there but you're more than a church
[1:29:18] you're more than just a church on the
[1:29:20] side of a road sitting on 33
[1:29:22] down here in elkton you're the bride of
[1:29:25] heaven
[1:29:28] and as the bride of heaven you know that
[1:29:30] he's your groom
[1:29:32] you know he's going to take care of you
[1:29:33] you know he's going to heal your body
[1:29:35] you know he's going to give you that
[1:29:37] baby you know he's gonna take care of
[1:29:39] you
[1:29:40] oh why don't you live like it well i
[1:29:44] live like it on saturday and sunday
[1:29:46] how about living like it all week long
[1:29:50] oh in the sweet by
[1:29:53] and by i'm just waiting brother andrew
[1:29:56] it ain't gonna work
[1:29:58] hallelujah if you wait to live right
[1:30:01] till you get over there
[1:30:03] i got bad news for you where you're at
[1:30:05] is not where you're wanting to go
[1:30:08] but if you can live like the sermon that
[1:30:11] you heard down here
[1:30:15] you won't just be a church you'll be
[1:30:17] more than a conqueror
[1:30:23] notice in mark chapter 11 he says
[1:30:27] have faith in god for verily i say unto
[1:30:30] you that if you say to this mountain be
[1:30:32] moved
[1:30:32] and plucked up and cast into the sea and
[1:30:35] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:30:37] that what you will say will come to pass
[1:30:40] you'll have
[1:30:41] whatever things you say is that right
[1:30:44] you shall have it not me
[1:30:46] you shall have it what power has been
[1:30:48] given to the church
[1:30:52] now you can express it by mental
[1:30:55] conception
[1:31:00] you can express these words by mental
[1:31:02] conception
[1:31:04] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:31:06] god
[1:31:07] that you see it before it happened
[1:31:11] are you with me you remember what i told
[1:31:13] you sometimes you got to hear things
[1:31:14] before you see things
[1:31:16] and when you allow the word of god to be
[1:31:20] a real revelation
[1:31:21] that you see it before it happened
[1:31:23] that's what faith is
[1:31:25] and express it in word form that word
[1:31:28] takes a hold
[1:31:29] and becomes a material a thought express
[1:31:33] your heart and your mind is so filled
[1:31:36] with god's spirit
[1:31:37] until your thoughts become his thoughts
[1:31:40] i hear a prophet say don't take your
[1:31:42] thought take his thought
[1:31:45] you see when your mind and your leading
[1:31:47] and your guiding becomes a direct
[1:31:49] inspiration
[1:31:50] of the holy spirit that's moving your
[1:31:52] mortal being
[1:31:54] what kind of people should we be
[1:31:58] he asked us this question what kind of
[1:32:00] people should we be
[1:32:02] if the very holy spirit has you so
[1:32:05] embodied
[1:32:06] or empowered that you don't use your own
[1:32:08] thoughts that you don't use your own
[1:32:10] mind
[1:32:11] you don't use your own opinions but the
[1:32:13] holy spirit has you so built
[1:32:15] until your thoughts and your being is
[1:32:18] god's spirit expressing itself through
[1:32:22] you
[1:32:23] what kind of a church would we be
[1:32:26] we would be the word made flesh again
[1:32:31] now the bible says in first john 3 and 2
[1:32:34] that
[1:32:35] now are we the sons of god he doesn't
[1:32:37] put it off somewhere in the future
[1:32:39] but he's telling you right now
[1:32:42] in this hour in this day there is a
[1:32:45] power that is setting in earthen vessels
[1:32:50] and that creator is in action the same
[1:32:53] one that rolled the worlds off of his
[1:32:54] fingertips
[1:32:58] you heard me say before can you imagine
[1:33:00] how god felt when he watched adam
[1:33:02] take that same word and start speaking
[1:33:04] those things
[1:33:06] that god gave adam he gave it to him to
[1:33:10] name all the beasts of the land
[1:33:13] he had such confidence in the first adam
[1:33:16] that he would name things according to
[1:33:18] their character
[1:33:19] he's got caught he had confidence in his
[1:33:21] second adam
[1:33:23] he had confidence that he would call
[1:33:24] them by their nature that they had in
[1:33:26] them
[1:33:27] and you watch when jesus was here on
[1:33:29] earth that he would call things
[1:33:31] by the nature that they had or by the
[1:33:33] characteristics that they had
[1:33:35] what did he do when those disciples were
[1:33:37] down there screaming said hey
[1:33:39] we ain't got we we don't know what
[1:33:41] happened here we tried to cast that
[1:33:43] thing off of him that epileptic spirit
[1:33:45] off of him
[1:33:46] but it didn't move jesus didn't mince
[1:33:49] words
[1:33:50] he told it exactly what it was he called
[1:33:53] it a devil
[1:33:55] and now you're watching the same second
[1:33:58] adam
[1:33:58] in body form speaking and calling things
[1:34:02] by their nature you're going to walk out
[1:34:05] of here tonight
[1:34:06] and you're going to say i got the same
[1:34:08] nature that the second adam had
[1:34:10] and i'm calling all of these lies of the
[1:34:12] devil
[1:34:16] i'm going to call these things a
[1:34:18] sickness it's a devil
[1:34:19] covet it's a devil depression it's a
[1:34:22] devil
[1:34:22] brain tumors it's a devil and those
[1:34:25] devils got to go
[1:34:27] in the name of jesus christ
[1:34:34] his wife now takes the same word
[1:34:41] satan come out
[1:34:44] that one clean spirit when you see a man
[1:34:48] of god
[1:34:50] this ain't never done before ever been
[1:34:52] done before in the face of the earth
[1:34:54] and it's done in front of the world you
[1:34:56] see a kentucky
[1:34:58] hillbilly stand behind a pulpit
[1:35:01] and start speaking good evening friends
[1:35:05] and demons start moving and he comes
[1:35:08] down to the end of the preaching
[1:35:10] and he stands there and says now you
[1:35:12] know i'm waiting on something
[1:35:14] i'm helpless as helpless can be unless
[1:35:18] he comes
[1:35:20] now he's here i now take every spirit
[1:35:23] under my control for the name of the
[1:35:25] lord that was not a man
[1:35:28] that was elohim that was the same one
[1:35:32] that was talking to those birds and
[1:35:35] those bees
[1:35:36] you fly here trees you land here it was
[1:35:39] the same one
[1:35:40] in the beginning standing right here
[1:35:44] in our day and there is a people
[1:35:47] hallelujah
[1:35:48] that are running with a message they're
[1:35:50] creating again
[1:35:51] saying little fishy come back to life if
[1:35:54] a possum
[1:35:55] could go to a prophet's doorstep what
[1:35:58] about the bride of jesus christ
[1:36:00] how much more should we lay before our
[1:36:02] lord
[1:36:05] as david said i'd rather lay before
[1:36:07] right before the door
[1:36:09] i'd rather be a rug than to dwell a
[1:36:11] parent that went into the tents of the
[1:36:13] wicked
[1:36:14] how much more should we lay before our
[1:36:16] lord that is faithful
[1:36:20] you are his wife you're creating again
[1:36:23] and you watched as tumors leave
[1:36:27] as you've seen squirrels come into
[1:36:29] existence when you've seen storms in
[1:36:31] colorado
[1:36:32] spoken out of existence when you've seen
[1:36:35] salvation given to boys
[1:36:38] when he's seen life given to a man by
[1:36:40] the name of doug hill
[1:36:42] when he sees salvation and deliverance
[1:36:44] coming to our young people
[1:36:48] what is it it's that same life coming
[1:36:51] into a body again that's controlling
[1:36:54] life that's controlling nature
[1:36:56] that's controlling sickness and
[1:36:58] overcoming hell
[1:37:00] overcoming demons overcoming the enemy
[1:37:06] it's the same life now you better
[1:37:09] destroy your enemy
[1:37:11] before he destroys you
[1:37:17] now notice
[1:37:21] we had a man of god come on the scene
[1:37:24] and tell science how cancer worked
[1:37:30] there has been there has been
[1:37:32] documentation of doctors
[1:37:34] that have said now we didn't know
[1:37:35] exactly we knew that the heart was built
[1:37:38] up in this way
[1:37:39] but when william branham started
[1:37:41] describing the organs
[1:37:44] he said he was describing what was on
[1:37:47] the inside of the man
[1:37:49] and here a prophet comes in demonology
[1:37:52] and he starts telling you
[1:37:54] what cancer is that cancer comes from
[1:37:57] the war
[1:37:58] from the word like a crab that when that
[1:38:00] cell
[1:38:01] is bruised he starts describing this
[1:38:04] thing out
[1:38:05] this this life of cancer that it grabs
[1:38:08] out and it grabs a hold of
[1:38:09] everything that it can grab he said now
[1:38:12] look
[1:38:13] what satan is doing he's building
[1:38:16] a life
[1:38:20] he says now he takes sale on top of sale
[1:38:25] see how close he works he works cell
[1:38:29] on top of sale and he takes one bruce
[1:38:31] cell
[1:38:32] and he comes and brother burnham said
[1:38:34] that he takes his shiny
[1:38:36] tiny older soldiers his tiny soldiers
[1:38:39] and he starts sending
[1:38:40] sale on top of sale on top of sale and
[1:38:44] starts contaminating you
[1:38:45] and all of a sudden that cancer has
[1:38:47] grown and that cancer
[1:38:49] has spread throughout the body
[1:38:55] what is it doing it's trying to stamp
[1:38:57] out
[1:38:58] the very life and he's trying to send
[1:39:00] you to a premature grave
[1:39:04] now look how close he look how close
[1:39:07] he watched he watched as these things
[1:39:10] are transpiring sell
[1:39:12] on top of sale and god is building
[1:39:14] himself a body
[1:39:16] and satan takes and he perverts
[1:39:19] brother branham said he's trying to
[1:39:21] build himself a life
[1:39:25] he has no authority to be there
[1:39:28] but he's on the inside of your cell
[1:39:32] now that cell was not meant to be there
[1:39:36] that cell was not meant to be there but
[1:39:39] because a sail
[1:39:40] got bruised all of a sudden the enemy
[1:39:43] comes with pus
[1:39:44] and sores and all of these things and he
[1:39:46] starts attacking that thing
[1:39:48] he starts sending all of his little
[1:39:50] soldiers towards this thing
[1:39:52] he said now he said now it's you watch
[1:39:55] that life
[1:39:56] he said now it's it's the enemy's job
[1:39:59] to bring sickness but it's your job to
[1:40:01] kick it out
[1:40:03] it's your job if satan can get that
[1:40:06] close
[1:40:07] in a vessel that god wants to fill and
[1:40:09] build sail on top of sail
[1:40:11] that satan wants to come and steal your
[1:40:14] life and build sail
[1:40:15] on top of sail that he can destroy your
[1:40:17] life there's got to be a power
[1:40:20] that you can tap into and destroy that
[1:40:22] life
[1:40:24] and jesus said in luke chapter 10 and
[1:40:27] verse 19
[1:40:28] behold i give you power i've given you
[1:40:31] power
[1:40:32] that whatsoever you bind on earth shall
[1:40:34] be bound in heaven
[1:40:36] and whatsoever you loose on earth shall
[1:40:38] be loosed in heaven
[1:40:39] it's a time that the bride stands in her
[1:40:41] authority
[1:40:43] and she binds every demon of hell and
[1:40:45] looses the holy ghost
[1:40:47] on that situation
[1:40:52] hallelujah if satan's wanting to rob you
[1:40:56] of your life that bad
[1:40:57] that means you got value to god
[1:41:02] that means there's something laying
[1:41:04] there that he can't get
[1:41:06] you're more than a church
[1:41:12] you're a church
[1:41:18] jesus conquered all things
[1:41:23] if he didn't he didn't do his job
[1:41:28] if he's not god he's the greatest
[1:41:31] deceiver that the world's ever seen
[1:41:33] is that right if he didn't finish it
[1:41:37] all then what are we doing here
[1:41:41] but i stand in complete assurance
[1:41:44] tonight
[1:41:45] that when jesus said at the cross it is
[1:41:48] finished every devil is under his feet
[1:41:53] and you don't have to conquer the world
[1:41:55] no more he's already conquered it
[1:41:58] that makes you more than a conqueror
[1:42:01] nay and all these things we are more
[1:42:04] than conquerors
[1:42:15] what good is it going to you good for
[1:42:17] you to do to go hang on a cross
[1:42:19] your sins already paid for what good is
[1:42:22] it going to do for you to go and get
[1:42:24] beat over all the sin
[1:42:28] man sometimes you can get so down and so
[1:42:31] depressed
[1:42:33] it gets so shook up man i did something
[1:42:36] wrong
[1:42:36] man i did something bad i look back
[1:42:39] people look back through the history of
[1:42:41] their life they get so beat up
[1:42:43] that if they could go to pilot's
[1:42:45] judgment hall they'd walk right there
[1:42:48] what good is that going to do you when
[1:42:51] he's already been beat for you
[1:42:53] when he's already been whipped for you
[1:42:56] what good's he going to do
[1:42:57] when jesus already paid for it
[1:43:01] how are you going to pay for it
[1:43:05] hallelujah when you look through the
[1:43:07] book of hebrews it tells us
[1:43:09] that the promises of god are more and
[1:43:12] better
[1:43:14] and the bible said that once and for
[1:43:17] all he's paid for your sin
[1:43:22] you ain't got to go to the cross you
[1:43:24] ain't got to go to hell
[1:43:27] jesus paid it
[1:43:30] now when i walk out a restaurant i now i
[1:43:32] have to tell you i enjoy eating good
[1:43:35] i enjoy my steaks and i enjoy my ice
[1:43:37] cream maybe a little bit better than
[1:43:39] some people should
[1:43:41] but when i walk into an establishment
[1:43:44] and i walk in there
[1:43:46] if i want to order a porterhouse i'm
[1:43:48] gonna order a porterhouse
[1:43:50] when it comes down to it if i want to
[1:43:52] order me a hershey bar a brownie
[1:43:54] with the ice cream on top of it with a
[1:43:57] cherry on top of it
[1:43:58] i'm gonna get it if i want to and when i
[1:44:02] leave there
[1:44:03] if i've paid the bill gave my tip i walk
[1:44:06] out of there
[1:44:06] in full assurance that ain't nobody
[1:44:09] coming after me
[1:44:10] because i paid for my bill
[1:44:13] now i i you you've done it many of you
[1:44:17] done it for me and i thank you very much
[1:44:18] you ain't got to do it there's been many
[1:44:20] times
[1:44:21] i walk down here to see rose and i go to
[1:44:24] pay the bill
[1:44:25] and somebody they look at me say
[1:44:27] somebody's done took care of it for you
[1:44:28] you must be a light guy so i don't know
[1:44:30] why
[1:44:32] i don't know who did that but i think
[1:44:35] you know if i knew that it was one of
[1:44:38] you and i got confidence in you
[1:44:41] that you got money to pay for it i can
[1:44:44] walk out of there the same assurance as
[1:44:46] i walked out when i paid for
[1:44:48] it because it's already been paid for
[1:44:52] are you with me most of you know how to
[1:44:54] work and most of you know how to save
[1:44:56] your money
[1:44:57] if you don't you need to learn how to
[1:44:59] but most of you know how to save your
[1:45:01] money and you know how to get a blessing
[1:45:03] and if you pay for my meal i can walk
[1:45:05] out of there with full assurance
[1:45:07] that the bill has already been paid for
[1:45:10] and i know ain't nobody coming after me
[1:45:12] now there's some people i'm a little bit
[1:45:14] skeptical
[1:45:16] you better check again that may give you
[1:45:18] a fake 20. i'm not talking about anybody
[1:45:19] here
[1:45:21] look you go in my business walk in my
[1:45:23] world just a little bit time
[1:45:26] it's scary it makes you be a preacher
[1:45:31] but there's some people that you
[1:45:33] wouldn't dare walk out say hey i got you
[1:45:35] today you wouldn't dare walk out of
[1:45:36] zeros
[1:45:37] on their word but when jesus said i paid
[1:45:41] for it
[1:45:42] when jesus said i took care of it you
[1:45:45] can walk out in full assurance
[1:45:47] that he took care of it you ain't gotta
[1:45:49] look behind you
[1:45:50] the devil ain't even follow you because
[1:45:53] surely
[1:45:54] goodness and mercy are following you all
[1:45:56] the days of your life
[1:45:58] and the enemy has been stripped of his
[1:46:00] power
[1:46:01] jesus paid for it cancer's been paid for
[1:46:06] broken wounds have been paid for broken
[1:46:09] homes have been paid for
[1:46:10] cancer's been paid for tuberculosis been

[1:46:15] let me nail it down covet has been paid
[1:46:18] for
[1:46:19] every strand of coffee has been paid for
[1:46:23] why should we put our faith in the enemy
[1:46:26] when we should put all our faith in god
[1:46:28] he said

[1:46:34] i pray for this
