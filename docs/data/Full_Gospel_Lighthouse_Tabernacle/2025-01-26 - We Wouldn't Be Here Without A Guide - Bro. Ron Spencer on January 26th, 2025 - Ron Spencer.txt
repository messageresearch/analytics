than this and then all of a sudden you hit another tune and I thought wow this is just so special amen if you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning we'd like to go to Matthew chap 6 and verse 9 it's very familiar to you it's the Lord's Prayer I want to speak to you on a very simple subject where would we be without a God where would we be without a god let's let's read this together and after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen for if we forgive men their trans trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses I want us to read those three scriptures again this morning and lead us not not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen for if we forgive not men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses you can be seated we're scripturally taught today that the Holy Ghost is our guide he is our leader he is that little place in your body that begins to check you when you've done things wrong I don't think by raise of hands this morning but you know within an instant when well you know and you just feel that little thing and then you just drop and go father forgive me I am sorry am am I am I in the same house this morning I'm really thankful for that amen I I want to say first of all I'm really thankful that he would do that for us amen you know of all of the billions and trillions of people on the Earth he's so mindful that he can watch over the smallest end insect but he can watch over us as individuals and he watches over us and and let me just say this to you we don't know the way right well you say well brother Ron I know the way well I tell you what if you know the way I want to I want to buy the same stock that you're going to buy tomorrow right you know if if you know the way I I want to go in the same business that you're involved in but I think we're all on the same page right we can't see an hour from now we got a good idea where we're going to be an hour from now but we need him right come on in the scriptures he calls us to come after me come follow me it was constantly in the script rures and he was asking people to leave their homes he was asking to leave their Lifestyles many times their families but come follow me right now what an incredible decision that you have to make if you're going to leave you got to leave somewhere right I I remember many years ago when I when I was I was being dealt with to come and Pastor The church here this year is my 25th anniversary of being here so this year so boy that went quick that went real quick so but but I remember I had a very successful Chimney Sweep business and and we were doing really well with that and you know God knows how to interrupt your plans right and so we were doing so well and and uh things were going so good the last year that I was I was in that I preached 46 different meetings so you can imagine I would leave about Thursday evening go somewhere travel fly or whatever and preach those meetings and come back home and and the Lord dealt with me and showed me a vision that I would pastor this church now let me just tell you that was not what I was wanting to do being a pastor was not top on my list all pastors ought to sh say Amen right there Andrew you really need to say Amen keep him alive Lord keep him alive the Lord dealt with me to sell my business I didn't want to do that either because I had plans to preach here on the weekends and go back there and run my business so I came out and told sister Connie I said the Lord just spoke to me that I would sell the business do you know within an hour there was a man standing on my porch with a check in his hand no way could have a rumor nothing could go on and he said I want to buy your business and he bought my business well we had a house there and my brother said I want to buy your house and so they bought my house now the Lord knows how to get behind you he knows how to open the door he knows how to open the door get behind you and push you through I just gave you a personal experience of how I got here every one of you have got a story right now I I I want to I I know the political world is all is all array right now of of getting real rid of the illegal aliens and all of those different kind of things and I'm not going to talk politics but we're getting ready to leave come on and it's not going to take police officers to make me move I may be drinking coffee I don't drink coffee now but maybe I'm drinking maybe drinking a hot tea and and drinking a hot tea and all of a sudden I feel a real sharp CH body change I'm going to a place Hallelujah now let me just say I don't have everything figured out of how we're going to get there so I'm glad that I have a guide amen the scripture says that in Revelations it says it several times come up hither and it's an invitation because you can't reach yourself that way then Jesus prays lead me not into temptation Lead Me Not So if he can lead me not he can lead me yes amen Amen brother Brandon would preach a sermon the dove leads the lamb five years ago and I'm celebrating my fifth year anniversary thank God if you trust me I will use you like never before for five years he has led me through Cancer Treatments through a lot of difficult things and the re reason I haven't preached over the last few weeks is I've been through a a kidney stone Journey let me just say us men are not built to have babies but I gave birth to a healthy boy you've never had one you pray never to have one mine just happened to be pretty large and then there were several others that came as well in Psalms chap 68 and verse one it says let God arise and let his enemies be scattered I think this is such a powerful scripture let God arise and let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him in Revelations Chapter 3 of course we know the scriptures I Know Thy works and thou art neither cold or hot and they would that thou were cold or hot this is Revelations 3:14: 1516 and so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth now notice what he says here and I think this is important because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked over the last couple of weeks you have saw some of the richest people some of the most powerful people that there is they were living in a cursed place was a place that was cursed by the prophet of the Lord and it's also cursed to to sink into the sea but there's many occasions where the sin became so great until the fire consumed and I'm not saying good to anything I think it's so horrible but let me just say this to you it burn it up rich poor incredible million dollar homes and even tents this world is not built to stay here brother BR says it reminds me of a little boy going home in a dark nut and going through a graveyard whistling he just whistles as hard as he can because he's merely calling a bluff to himself he don't want to think that he's scared but he's whistling to try to relax himself but down in the bottom of it he's scared behind every Tombstone there's a go and he's so scared and he's whistling just as kind to kind of to quieten himself that's where America is at he tells of a story and I think it's incredible he said It reminds me of a story that I read some years ago about a prospector in Arizona for those that you remember I told this story at brother Homer Frasier's funeral and he was one of those goldm minded people and he wanted to get rich all at once and so he goes into the desert to Prospect and while he was prospecting The Story Goes that he found a a great nest of nuggets and just overnight became a multimillionaire with socks full of gold and he packed his burrow and he and his burrow and his faithful dog started back to civilization with a with the sweet flying from the fa from sweat flying from his face and his eyes glittering and on the road he was having a good time the rest he was going to have a good time the rest of his life so when he was nearing to the place where he was his destination would be they said that that was an old abandoned Shack and he'd went into this Shack and laid the money and up on up upon the table by itself and there was a grease candle and he was looking over the nuggets and little did he know that there was eyes that was watching him and along about the time that he laid down and he went to sleep while starting to get some sleep his Old Faithful dog be to bark and he was laying on his pillow thinking tomorrow I'll I'll change these nuggets for currency and I'll buy great cars and I'll drink good whiskey and I'll do all of these things and I'll have a big time I'll go to Every dance and and and all that he would be he was just daydreaming and his dog kept barking and barking away and he went to the door and opened the door and said shut up and the old dog whin and he was tried to he was tied to a leash and and he tried to warn his master but he went back again and he laid down upon his bed and the dog barking again and he called him and Time After Time shut up I don't want to hear you I want a lovely dream tonight of Good Times of I'm going to have tomorrow and and when I cash in my gold and finally the dog barking again he became angry and reached in the corner and got a double barrel shotgun and went to the door and both pulled both of the Hammers back and shot that dog so that'll take care of you I won't need you anymore anyhow he set the gun down and laid it on his bed and folded his hands and went went with his dream and he fell to sleep and in just a little while the door opened easily and someone slipped across the floor and plunged a knife into his bosom and took the gold and left with it oh what did he do and this is a statement we get to what did he do he killed the voice that was warning him I use that in brother Frasier's funeral because brother Homer had had baptized hundreds and hundreds of people led many to the Lord but not everybody stayed they walked away you know after a while you can hush that warning you can you can actually sear your conscience right to where you don't want to hear that voice anymore you can seear it to the place to where you know as a pastor you're a shepherd and you're watching watching over sheep brother Homer would always say sheep are dumb remember that brother Ray he' say sheep are dumb and they get in all kind of trouble and you know sheep try to they try to actually they try to doctor their themselves and Doctor one another and they'll get in trouble and you said but brother Ron I I don't need a pastor I I don't need a guide I don't need a leader brother BR says a GU he he has to know the way he has to know where he's going and what he's doing and how to take care of you along the road he's got to see that you don't come up lost I love that a God is a selected man the state the state selects this man and if he is a God now he's he's going to take you on a trip Into the Wilderness and and he said where perhaps that you're not used to going it's not a good thing for you to go without one amen I'm sorry here just for a moment I can't see this morning so I'm having trouble he said frankly sometimes you can't even go go without one for instance maybe to Canada all of us know that you have to have a guide if you've hunt in Canada he said the God has to assign your license to the game board he has to assign himself to it and he is responsible for you and if anything happens to you it's his responsibility he's got to take care of you he's got to see that you're not lost he's got to be sure that he don't send you in somewhere that you don't know your way back and if you do get lost he's got to know the country so well that he can pick you up just any time he's got to know all of these things or he cannot be a God right come on now I want you to think about this Our God knows the way amen he knows what we'll get into even tomorrow even next week There's Nothing a surprise to my God God never gets in crisis he's always watching over you you've heard me say it before you are more protected than the president of the United States of America let me just say it to you young people that are going to school you're not alone right you're not alone there's angels that actually go to school with you to protect you to watch over you listen they know the way amen now the scripture says he is the only place that can give you safety he is God's provided safety now he says oh we can provide this and provide that and and it's fall but when God provides anything it's Eternal and God's provided way is safety in Christ he said oh how I love it when you're in him when troubles come like sickness or weary dis disappointments any of youve ever had any of those amen he bore our sorrows with his stripes we are healed amen everything that we have need of for the rest of our journey come on everything we have need of for for the rest of our journey is in Jesus Christ Now 1 chonicles chapter 16 and verse1 15 be you mindful always of of his Covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations even of the Covenant which he made with Abraham and the oath to unto Isaac and confirmed the same to Jacob for a law and to Israel for an Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee will I give thee land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when you were but a few even a few and strangers in it notice I have provided for you all along not just for you but for your children and for your children's children children and when they went from Nation to nation and from one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong notice how he watched over his children are you with me now he suffered nobody to do you wrong thank you Lord many of our lives would be much different if God wasn't watching over and the enemies doing different kind of things to destroy you and God said I will not allow them to do it Hallelujah he reproves Kings for your sake hallelujah hallelujah Donald Trump cannot make a decision on without God watching over you that's right as much as he thinks he can do all of these things with executive orders God has already made a decision right I've got children right that I'm watching over they're not going to be here long he repr reproved Kings for their sakes now notice the statement touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm I find it interesting that you can attack a lot of different people out of the world and not get into any trouble but when you attack one of God's kids when you attack one of God's kids you're in trouble right and listen then it's not you against that person it's you against God that's right Amen brother brother Brandon would use the term you become God's enemy right right let me just tell you you'll lose that's right now watch this sing unto the Lord all the Earth and show forth his day to day his salvation declare his glory among the Heathen His Marvelous Works among the Nations for great is the Lord we'll get here in a moment great is the Lord and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods for all gods of the people are Idols but the Lord hath made the heavens Glory and Honor are in his presence and strength and gladness are in his place give un to the Lord you you childr of all people give un to the Lord glory and strength give un to the Lord the glory do unto his name bring an offering and come before him Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness fear before him all the Earth the world also ha also shall be stable and that it be not moved let the heavens be glad and the Earth rejoice and let men say unto the Nations the Lord reth say it with me the Lord reth Let the Sea Roar and the fullness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is therein then shall the Trees of the woods sing out at the presence of the Lord because he cometh to judge the earth oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that's the kind of God we have we could take a five minute break and Shout for a little while that's my God that's how great he is now brother Bram says it like this he said love one another love one another above everything what does that matter we are as Eternal as God is eternal are you with me love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group but remember my warning Satan won't let it stay that way he'll shoot everything he if he has to bring somebody in and has to make a Target he'll bring a critic or unbeliever and set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start right through the church don't take any sides with it don't take any sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it he said with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind and love One Love to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman woman that they'll be saved or whoever it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor he's the shepherd and he'll give and you give him respect he'll lead you through and that's CA he's ordained of God to do so now you guys that have been here forever in a day since the church started you know brother Homer used to hand out a word to the church he would have brother Bill Hinkle about once a year you boys don't know this but brother Bill Hinkle about once a year you remember Sister Linda he would get up and he would read this this this portion of of the word to the church because let me just say this you God is leading us and while he's leading us an enemy will try to get into you whether it's your personal family or a body of Believers he'll try to get into you it's not just you he tries to get the pastor he tries to get one another right listen we live in a world there where there's two different kinds of spirits one is the spirit of God and one is the devil spirit and if you remember it's which dog that you feed the most it don't take long for you to feed the wrong dog that's right come on I think I'm getting on the right page with you don't take long for you to get in the wrong dog and before long you'll get the wrong Spirit that's right go and it was an enemy that did that to you it wasn't God that did that to you you remember brother Wayne he brother Wayne just has a way of saying things he said somebody told me about this guy and he said told me a bad story about this guy and and he said this he said I he said that guy told me the story and I believe the guy and he said he said I I hated that guy I wouldn't talk to that guy I didn't want nothing to do with that guy he said years later he said I found out it wasn't that [Laughter] guy don't sit there like your a bunch of angels you'll hear a story not going there but I do want to go here I read you a scripture just a moment ago that told us to for ask forgiveness amen and then told us that if we forgive not our brothers then God won't forgive us now let I'm going to preach on forgiveness in a couple weeks but but I I think it's a good time to drop it right here God's telling us in his prayer of leadership being our God you've got to forgive you got to forgive and and let me say this to you when you forgive it sets you free it sets you free right and let me just say even to even the new ones here let me let me just say this to you I don't want to know your history I don't need a two-hour conversation with you to figure out you've been a bad boy I I don't need that I don't want to know nothing about that I want to know about your future that's what I want to know about your future we'll say well brother Ron I've held this against that person I've held this against that person let let me just say this to you when when Isaac will you stand just a moment yeah what are you doing on the front row did you not have a seat so Isa Isaac has stole a car and he stole a Camaro from a brother and he took it on a spin trip you know he comes back and you know Isaac gets right with God he gets right with God how long does it take to get right with God 30 seconds it'll take you much longer to ask forgiveness for your spirit so Isaac drops his head and he sincerely says God I've done wrong I shouldn't have stole brother Chris's car and he goes to brother Chris he said I'm sorry brother Chris and brother Chris says did you get it up to 90 thank you and then you're sitting all way across the church and say do you know Isaac stole somebody's car when you don't think about it God's already took care of that come on aren't aren't you thankful for that [Applause] I want to ask you today how big is your god that's right how big is he you see God don't have any limits to him that's when he asked job he said job where was you at when I laid the foundations of the earth God doesn't talk to him about his circumstances or his situations he didn't have a pity party with him about what he was going through he said job where was you at when I laid the foundations of the earth I want you to just notice job had a lot of enemies and a lot of laughers but there came a time to where job could laugh at his enemies amen brother Tim brother Tim PR and brother Kelly Hilder brat was having a conversation brother Kelly had went through it we were sitting it was a glass table we were sitting at a place probably had 10 or 12 seats sitting at it and brother Tim was sitting on the end of the seat and he he made a statement that I that I've caught a hold of he said there will come a day brother Kelly that you will laugh at your enemy let me just say you got an enemy this morning just start [Applause] laughing listen when you have God on your side what else do you need I I know this is just simple but when you have God on your side what else do you need sister Teresa laugh at your enemy you call Sister Connie the other day and I was sitting in the car listening and somebody had done something to you I thought I already to just scream out to her laugh at your enemy laugh at your enemy one day you and I laugh at this cancer that we're fighting we'll laugh at it now I want you to think God picked you you didn't pick you God picked you God elected you God anointed you and God placed you are you with me well brother Ron my choice you know it's only about me let me just say selfish people is only about them are you with me it's only it's only about me brother Ron selfish people operate like that brother Shannon your grandmother prayed for you to be here this is generational this is a generational thing when you see my boy sitting up here my my family here my grandchildren here this is not an accident right this has been work that's went on for decades right it started with grandfathers right it it kept up with a father that believed this word it kept up with myself overcoming for decades and I'm still standing at trunk Hallelujah Brother Martin look at your family are you with me look at your family there will come spouses amen there will come children amen probably a lot of them children we'll build that church at that point children and children because you made a decision you made a choice you made a choice and there's benefit to making a choice when you make a choice there's benefits that comes along with it I like God's benefits I like it Hallelujah I like it brother Ron but I've got a child that's lost and prodical that's that's what you're looking at that's what you're looking at God's looking at something totally different when he sang that song last night about a prodal son many of us were prodal running away from God doing things that we thought that we were really enjoying the life of the party but God rich in mercy God rich in Mercy got a hold of Our Lives you guys sit here now you guys sit here now you got wonderful families and there was a time that it was only a dream but in a few days we'll have a marriage a wedding celebration only God does these things listen if it's the influence of a man it'll only last for just a little while right if it's the leadership of a human being let me tell you about human beings human beings when you first meet them you fall in love with them face value greatest people you've ever met but you get around them a little while brother Ron brother Ron you're I'm telling the truth I'm telling the truth your wife knows you better than anybody else knows you you sound like a husk ofar and a chainsaw in the middle of the night there's nobody that would put up with you but her that's right cuz she stepped out of Eternity are you with me now I'm preaching to you I'm preaching to you God watched over your life he put you with the right one that could be there with you in the thick and the thin the ups and the Downs the sickness and in health why you need leadership to marry oh my you really need leadership to marry you need a guide you need a guide to get you through this situation Amen brother Ron I I'm looking for a beauty queen look in the mirror baby come on brother Homer one time uh we were in conference and this guy was saying that his wife had got quite large and it was disappointing to him and brother Homer simply looked at him and said you sir do not have a Coke bottle figure either aren't you thankful that whoever that was didn't come to this church that's the only reason I could use that illustration let me just say this you God didn't bring you here to lose you he's not the kind of God that gets you to a certain spot and then says I I I'm not going to be able to get him any further the scripture says and it's very familiar to us the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want it he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and he leadth me beside of the Still Waters he restoreth my soul and he leadth me at the pass of righteous for his name's sake and yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies and thou anointest my head with all and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever chapter 2 7 and verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion let me tell you something about life it ain't Hollywood I saw a clip the other day of a man that had been in soap opers still in soap opers his home is gone it's burnt up he was sitting there in a wore out t-shirt pajama bottoms and he was going I have nothing I have nothing everything that I work for it's all gone let me just say as Christians we'll never come to that spot am naked I came in the world naked I'm going to leave and I have it all yeah amen hallelujah the scripture Isaiah chapter 41 and10 fear thou not for I am with thee aren't you glad of that be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen ye y I will help thee yeah I will uphold thee with the right hand of my of my righteousness amen second Timothy chap 1 verse 7 for God has not given us a spirit of fear right but of power and of love and of a sound mind we're going to face a lot of fronts in this life a lot of attacks on many sides I'll just share with you what we have been through the last few [Music] weeks help us Lord [Applause] there's probably some times that Connie feels like caring me out and I tell you I tell you what I do I'd scream help pray for me church but there's things that you come to that you never saw coming am right you never see coming and I I had pain that was going situation that was going on had been going on for months and I didn't know what it was different doctors were saying different things and it was giving me some pretty evil reports and and all of a sudden after I preached here the last time I preached on Sunday morning I felt like it was a powerful sermon but walked out of the pull pit and by the time I got in the car I knew it was in trouble so we went to the doctor of the hospital the next morning it was snowing and Connie was driving in that snow and and I was praying for her and trying to handle the pain and I was trying to get there we got to the hospital we we got told that we're going to have a baby boy I've had brain surgery I've had lung surgery I've had I've had many different kinds of surgery take chemo every day but I had never been here before I kidney stones a brand new world and so you know they send me back home you can pass this listen I could have passed the Titanic easier so I go back to the hospital and listen I'm pleading do something do something you was with me listen just do something I didn't like what they did but they did something now I'm praying God help me to recover did I see it all coming no sir I did not see it coming you didn't see your car breaking down you were about 8 hours away and your car breaks down you had no idea before you left that you was G to have to trade cars how many of you have come to a spot to where that you didn't see it coming and boom you were in the middle of it I'm telling you those stories not just just to be telling you a story listen listen God knows the way am God knows the way I've been with different guides different guides was whether it was hunting or fishing God knows the way we were fishing one time and and you know we were we had already been there about six hours and and you know none of us had got a bite we were all paying really good money to be involved in that and you know I I just looked at the guide and I said is there no fish in this Lake and he said listen Jesus is the only God that he's a sure thing that you're going to get a fish it must have been this the bright thing for him to say we limited out in five minutes and it was over I want you to go take the hook that's in your pocket and they're wanting to pay taxes it's tax season prime time for me to tell this isn't it and I want you to take that hook and I want you to catch a fish and when you catch the fish open its mouth and it's going to have enough money to pay the taxes now listen if you'd have been standing close you'd have doubted that right listen we're human beings you're human beings well brother Ron I I I wouldn't have okay then you go fishing with brother Vernon and the Lord tells you that when you catch a fish open its mouth and it's going to have a$1 thousand check in it there'll be a lot of people in your boat brother Veron listen we're human beings so we doubt the process brother brandham tells of a story of a man named Jack Koy you ever heard this story Jack Coy he was in the wilderness and he had lost his way his horse was dying and there was no water and they were following pass that was made by Buffalo and they came to a split now there was a path that was Less Traveled and the horse refused to go on the path that was better traveled now after a little bit Jack actually decided I'm going to follow this horse cuz he's got senses that I don't have and within minutes they were in the middle of a pond with with water bathing over top of them and they were just enjoying the water over and over amen now there was some Prospectors that was there and so Jack got out of the water and they begin to tell him they're going to try to force him to take a drink of whiskey and he told them a story of his father had died a drunk and he made a promise to his mother that he would never drink and they held that jug out and they told him that if he didn't drink they were going to kill him well just about that time shots rang out there was somebody else that was watching over shots rang out and busted that whiskey jug apart and there was a guy listening to him tell the story about making a promise to his mother that he would never drink and he shot that whiskey jug right out of those those men's hands and he said sir the story that you told about your mother my mother told me to make the same promise but I didn't make the I failed on my promise but from this day forward you're going to be my God and we're going to lead many to Jesus Christ on [Applause] I hear about Peter cartright and you've heard about Peter cart where's brother Denny at I waved to brother Denny and told him I'd tell the story but this a good spot to tell it how many know Peter cartright by name Peter cartright was under the influence of John Wesley he was a circuit writer preacher but he was such a powerful speaker he would speak about 30 minutes and shake the audience now he was against slavery and he was against alcohol against the other things that he felt like that the the politicians wasn't doing good enough he thought I'm going to help him so he began to run for office and in that day you know they didn't have the luxuries of the the Telegraph and things that we have today so they had to go from town to town and they'd give their speeches and they give their speeches they stand in front of hundreds of people and give their speeches and tried to get their votes so he shows up in this town and his opponent is giv his speech I'm going somewhere with this one and his opponent is saying if I could ever meet Peter car I'd whip him I'd frail him I'd knock him I'd tear him all to pieces and Peter CL was listening to this about 30 minutes and so when it seemed like it was about a wind down he said sir do you know Peter C right he said no I've never seen him before he said well I'm Peter carright amen remember brother Brandon talks about him in the greatest battle ever fought that was an appropriate preacher to pick out and he said I'll tell you what you come down here and do to me what you said to to all of these people come down here and do do that to me cuz Peter cartright was quite a preacher I think I could compare him to maybe Homer Frasier and so he said if you don't do it you're a liar and you don't deserve public office so that man felt a little courage and he jumped down off of the stage and he ran up to Peter cartright and wanted to thrash him wanted and Peter car whipped him right there and then pulled him down to the river and he explained to the hundreds of people up on the up on the bank says this man's not converted so I'm going to baptize the devil that's inside of him [Applause] can you imagine where we would be without a messenger right can you imagine where we would be I'm coming to a close without the seals being opened that's right without knowing who the horse riders were and knowing the enemy that we're fighting right now can you imagine where we would be without one sermon called false anointed ones of the end time that's right I think about that sermon with all these preachers with all of these gifts but no truth right I think about all of those things as as our guide laid it out for us America didn't want to God right and that's why she's in the condition that she's in right that's right let me let me just explain something to you had America accepted this message we wouldn't need a police force right we wouldn't need a hospital we wouldn't need a psychiatric lab anywhere because that's the kind of land that we're getting ready to go to this message has come not just to raise up men but to raise up a bride of Jesus Christ to live in that City yes no hospitals we'll never start a service there with a prayer request line there will never be a funeral service help me now we'll never get old we'll never see Dead Leaves ever again but we need a God to give get us [Applause] there we went to Illinois and I'll close we went to Illinois to hunt this year you have to have a guide and we were given a new guide this year a man it was Bill hle number two and so I don't have the strength to carry my backpack a mile or walk a mile and so they would they would pull my their car right up to where we were at and then I'd get out and hunt the day well we would fellowship with our guide and you know after a day or so he said if you if you don't mind I I want to sit in a stand with you all day I was sit with you all day well I never had nobody do that now this guy had been a writer for magazines and owned a magazine and he did a lot of things in hunting he knew more about deer than than I ever thought about it he done forgot about it but we got in that stand and we begin to talk about God am we begin to talk about God listen he had been a teacher in denominations a teacher for years and decades and he was an astrophysicist and had that degree super smart man and after a couple of days of hunting with us in that stand I we talked about from Abraham to Nehemiah all the way through when I finished he told me he said he made a statement to you he said I don't know who was guiding who I don't know who was guiding who let me just say this to you and I want to end this with this you're guiding people that you don't even know about your light is shining so bright till there's people that's standing in the shadows watching amen many times they're watching for you to make a mistake right they're watching for you to fall but because your light becomes so bright and there seem a believe be be more Christ than you tell they want some of that I finish with this there was a boat that pulled up to the to the Bay they were mad and no doubt there was a lot of cussing going on and Jesus said have you any fish and I'm sure one of them was grumbling worse than anything you see the other one had met Jesus and he knew what he was capable of doing have you any fish nobody wants to admit failure amen nobody wants to admit it and Jesus tells them drop your net on the other side of the boat we've did this all night long we've did it all night long listen to drop a net there could be hours involved in dropping a net and then bringing it back in in we are wore out he had an incredible amount of excuses say can say I'm wore out I'm ready to go home I'm ready to quit just drop your net do you know that finally something came over them just follow his leading Hallelujah aren't you glad that one day you said yes Lord [Applause] and when they dro the net let me just say this you this huge net begin to fill up and it fills so much it begin to turn the boat over right and they begin to scream for help and people run from everywhere to help them to catch the fish it was a year salary in that net I want to remind you God knows where the fish areen God knows how tired you are God knows how wor out you are but he knows where the fish is at don't tell me that God's a bad
