[0:03] [Music]
[0:22] it's interesting to notice how that
[0:25] that the church tries to attract the
[0:26] attention of the people by buying ropes
[0:28] and dress choirs and bob tears women and
[0:31] painted faces and
[0:32] they think it's a sign like an angel lie
[0:35] like a devil
[0:36] run around all night to dance like and
[0:39] think nothing about it
[0:40] and that's what they think is all right
[0:42] that's beautiful but you see
[0:44] that's false maid
[0:47] that's not the word of god while the
[0:49] true bride
[0:51] attracts the attention of god by keeping
[0:54] his word
[0:55] i notice now let us notice christ
[0:59] they say when i wait a minute what about
[1:01] this beauty you're talking about
[1:03] the bible said in isaiah 53 2
[1:07] that when jesus come there was no beauty
[1:09] of him that we should
[1:11] is that right there's no beauty if he
[1:14] would have come in the worldly beauty as
[1:16] satan is today the people would have run
[1:18] around him and accepting the way they do
[1:20] the church today
[1:22] they would have believed him receiving
[1:24] as they do satan today
[1:26] certainly they would but he didn't come
[1:28] in that kind of a beauty
[1:29] but he always comes in the beauty of
[1:32] character
[1:34] their christ wasn't a beautiful great
[1:36] strong stout
[1:37] man god doesn't choose that kind
[1:40] i remember one time a prophet went up to
[1:43] to take a king to
[1:44] make a king of jesse's sons to take uh
[1:48] another king's place saw and
[1:51] so jesse brought him out his great big
[1:52] fine boy he said the
[1:54] crown would look right on his head the
[1:55] prophet went to pour the arm on him and
[1:57] said god's refused him
[1:59] and he refused every one of them said he
[2:00] comes a little old stoop shoulder ruddy
[2:02] looking fellow
[2:03] they poured the oil up on him and he
[2:05] said god chose him
[2:07] see if we choose besides god's used by
[2:09] character
[2:10] character there never was a character
[2:12] like jesus christ
[2:14] it lands in him manifests him we see
[2:17] it's
[2:18] true it's not worthy beauty of him that
[2:20] attracts his bride
[2:22] it's is his character the character of
[2:25] the church that jesus looks for
[2:27] not worse big buildings whether it's
[2:29] great denominations where's the big
[2:30] membership
[2:31] he promised to meet with wherever two or
[2:33] three are together together
[2:35] truly that's where the true believer
[2:39] rests his hopes is up on that word of
[2:42] god being vindicated in truth
[2:44] one is choose by his word not a
[2:47] worldly loving fruit they hate that no
[2:50] wonder she is divorced from him
[2:52] because she's missed his revelation and
[2:54] she don't have it
[2:55] he cares not for her the way she acts
[2:57] and doesn't how much of this
[2:59] worldly stuff she has he's looking for
[3:01] her character
[3:02] the character of christ now just a
[3:05] moment now
[3:06] he chooses a bride to reflect his
[3:09] character
[3:10] to which the modern churches of the day
[3:13] certainly
[3:14] misses his his program here a million
[3:17] miles
[3:18] because they deny this to be the truth
[3:21] so how could it be how he's looking for
[3:24] the day for that bride to be formed
[3:26] hebrews 13 8 just exactly like it was
[3:29] like he was
[3:30] it's got to be his same flesh same bone
[3:32] same spirit same
[3:33] everything just exactly built up and
[3:35] them to them become
[3:36] one until the church becomes that
[3:40] they're not one the character of him the
[3:42] word
[3:43] or this age must be molded she must be
[3:46] molded
[3:47] like he is

[1:05:24] shake hands and
[1:05:25] hug each other's neck again and um
[1:05:28] but until then we'll just have to keep
[1:05:31] doing what we're doing
[1:05:33] and we had a wonderful doctor's reports
[1:05:36] this week and
[1:05:38] and uh we just thank the lord for that
[1:05:41] we'd like to continue to get those kind
[1:05:43] of reports and
[1:05:45] it's kind of like going to the dentist
[1:05:46] and he tells you you have no cavities
[1:05:50] amen so i'll just keep taking that no
[1:05:52] cavity situation
[1:05:54] and so they have doubled our our
[1:05:56] immunotherapy
[1:05:58] and chemo and if you just pray that our
[1:06:00] bodies can continue to tolerate that
[1:06:03] and do well with it we're at the max
[1:06:05] level now and so
[1:06:06] we're killing cancer so that's what
[1:06:09] we're doing and so
[1:06:11] we're at a spot now to where they say
[1:06:13] they'll start begin to reach the brain
[1:06:15] and get rid of those cells inside of
[1:06:17] there
[1:06:18] and so i hope it leaves some good cells
[1:06:22] amen at least we know we got a brain we
[1:06:25] got a good heart and we got our brain so
[1:06:27] somewhere and the lungs look like
[1:06:29] they're doing really well so we're we're
[1:06:31] thankful for
[1:06:32] that amen wanting you to continue to
[1:06:35] remember brother donnie reagan's
[1:06:36] daughter

[1:06:41] the initial stages of
[1:06:42] finding out that she has stage four
[1:06:45] liver cancer
[1:06:46] and so they've entered a port with
[1:06:48] chemotherapy
[1:06:50] to begin to just go at that as hard as
[1:06:53] they can go at it
[1:06:55] those that know herchee's a little
[1:06:57] precious little lady and little
[1:06:59] little bitty girl and so that we just
[1:07:02] pray we want you just to bind your faith
[1:07:04] together with them and pray that god
[1:07:06] would
[1:07:06] just touch her body and and raise her up
[1:07:10] and do a
[1:07:11] supernatural work for her we know that
[1:07:14] god's greater than cancer and so
[1:07:16] amen do want you to continue to pray for
[1:07:19] me that god would just help me
[1:07:21] until we can ring that bell i i'd like
[1:07:24] to ring that
[1:07:25] bell and so amen
[1:07:33] amen i believe we can and so we got a
[1:07:37] ways to go but so
[1:07:38] you just continue to pray for us that
[1:07:40] god would just help us in all of that
[1:07:42] and uh and we just thank the lord we're
[1:07:45] a long way from where we was
[1:07:48] but we're a long way from where we need
[1:07:50] to be and so
[1:07:51] amen but i really enjoy having doctors
[1:07:54] come in and smile and dance
[1:07:56] and and and and are really happy that
[1:07:58] we're one of those numbers that is on
[1:08:00] the good side of the things and so
[1:08:03] amen we're not looking to die we're
[1:08:05] looking to live and so
[1:08:07] that's what we're thankful for amen
[1:08:10] amen if you will turn with me in your
[1:08:12] scriptures this morning to matthew

[1:08:42] isn't it
[1:08:43] amen amen matthew chapter 16 and verse
[1:08:48] 17.
[1:08:50] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:08:53] blessed art thou simon barjona
[1:08:56] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:08:59] unto thee but my father
[1:09:02] which is in heaven and i say also unto
[1:09:05] thee that
[1:09:06] thou art peter and upon this rock
[1:09:10] i will build my church
[1:09:14] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:09:17] against it
[1:09:18] now i want you just to notice who's
[1:09:20] building the church
[1:09:23] god's taken personal responsibility
[1:09:26] to build his church he's not going to
[1:09:29] leave it to a man
[1:09:31] he's said i will build my church
[1:09:35] now notice what he said with that when
[1:09:37] he builds his church
[1:09:40] and then the strongest part of hell
[1:09:44] the strongest demons of hell shall not
[1:09:48] prevail against it amen god bless you as
[1:09:52] you're seated this morning
[1:09:54] certainly good to see you in the house
[1:09:55] of the lord we love you with all of our
[1:09:57] hearts
[1:09:58] amen god bless
[1:10:01] we realize in the scriptures that
[1:10:05] that there are places to where that god
[1:10:08] asks what
[1:10:08] what house will you build me we can look
[1:10:11] at different spots and not to take a lot
[1:10:13] of time with it but just to give you a
[1:10:16] just a drop reference or point reference
[1:10:19] god's god had had even had even
[1:10:22] after the garden of eden two boys
[1:10:26] abel came to worship the lord
[1:10:30] and abel came by revelation knowing it
[1:10:32] had to be blood
[1:10:34] wasn't a huge building that he built but
[1:10:37] he went to a rock and he offered a
[1:10:40] sacrifice
[1:10:41] of a lamb and he pulled it up on that
[1:10:45] up on that that rock and begin to work
[1:10:48] up on that rock
[1:10:50] and the life of that animal began to
[1:10:52] pour back upon him
[1:10:54] and god would accept his sacrifice
[1:11:00] but there was another his brother came
[1:11:02] and
[1:11:03] came and he offered up his works
[1:11:07] and he offered his works and his ability
[1:11:10] brother branham said it was a beautiful
[1:11:12] offering
[1:11:13] he said flowers and fruit
[1:11:17] and he said he came and he said god
[1:11:19] refused it
[1:11:21] because it had to be blood to get back
[1:11:24] to god
[1:11:25] if you remember abraham made a
[1:11:28] worshipping before
[1:11:29] god and he would he would take and slay
[1:11:32] the beast
[1:11:34] because he knew it was blood and he
[1:11:37] would offer up those
[1:11:38] beasts and and the pillar of fire would
[1:11:41] come down and come through the midst
[1:11:43] of those beasts and walk through the
[1:11:45] mist
[1:11:46] and god would speak and he would hear
[1:11:49] the voice of god
[1:11:51] speaking to him and he would no doubt
[1:11:54] come back and
[1:11:54] reference these things to the people
[1:11:56] that was around him
[1:11:58] that he was fellowshipping with god
[1:12:02] now no doubt they had their their
[1:12:04] opinions about what he was doing
[1:12:07] but listen it was abraham and god
[1:12:13] there was another man that met god and
[1:12:16] he would have an
[1:12:17] altar and god would give him
[1:12:20] instructions
[1:12:21] this time not to build a church but to
[1:12:24] build an
[1:12:25] ark and he would gather the materials
[1:12:30] some of them seemed inferior to be able
[1:12:33] to
[1:12:33] dare be able to put it on a on a stormy
[1:12:37] ocean
[1:12:38] or or a stormy waterway
[1:12:41] it would be inferior wood that most
[1:12:43] people would throw away
[1:12:45] but you see god was taking
[1:12:47] responsibility
[1:12:48] for the gathering of all of the
[1:12:50] materials
[1:12:54] moses would be would be would be told
[1:12:57] how to build a temple
[1:12:59] and even in there he would talk about
[1:13:02] badger skins
[1:13:04] which would be representatives of you
[1:13:06] and i
[1:13:08] the worst animal meanest animal
[1:13:14] the most cantankerous animal and that
[1:13:17] would be one
[1:13:18] of the skins that god would require
[1:13:21] in his temple it would take an
[1:13:24] innumerable amount of time
[1:13:27] to to be able to pull all of the
[1:13:29] materials together
[1:13:31] just think about this even some of the
[1:13:34] materials
[1:13:35] had to come from places like australia
[1:13:39] and new zealand all the way to israel
[1:13:44] sometimes that's mind-boggling when you
[1:13:47] think about when
[1:13:48] god starts gathering material
[1:13:53] are you with me david would would have a
[1:13:56] desire
[1:13:57] that he could build god attempt a temple
[1:14:01] and his desire was that god could have a
[1:14:04] place to where that
[1:14:05] that people could turn their face toward
[1:14:08] and worship the lord
[1:14:11] he saw that it was a blessing in obed's
[1:14:14] house
[1:14:15] he saw that it was a blessing wherever
[1:14:17] that ark was
[1:14:18] and he wanted to build god a tabernacle
[1:14:21] but understand god could not let him do
[1:14:24] it
[1:14:24] because david had shed way too much
[1:14:27] blood
[1:14:29] and david had sin in his life to which
[1:14:32] that had
[1:14:33] blood was now coming back upon him but
[1:14:37] interesting enough it would be by the
[1:14:39] grace of god
[1:14:41] through which even the marriage that
[1:14:44] solomon came
[1:14:49] god proves his grace over
[1:14:52] and over and over again that's what he
[1:14:54] did for you
[1:14:57] he proves his grace and mercy to you
[1:15:00] just when he should have throwed you
[1:15:02] away
[1:15:07] he reaches down and grabs a hold of you
[1:15:09] and picks you up
[1:15:11] does a supernatural work for you
[1:15:15] are you with me jesus would make some
[1:15:18] interesting statements
[1:15:21] destroy this temple
[1:15:24] and in three days i'll raise it up again
[1:15:30] they all thought he was talking about
[1:15:32] solomon's temple
[1:15:35] there's no way that they could
[1:15:37] comprehend
[1:15:38] that he was talking about this temple
[1:15:43] are you with me now no way because
[1:15:46] jesus was working his way toward the
[1:15:50] temple
[1:15:50] of mankind he wanted to live in your
[1:15:54] life
[1:15:57] are you with me now
[1:16:02] in jesus day he would he would use a
[1:16:06] statement
[1:16:08] come follow me and people would leave
[1:16:12] their houses and leave their homes and
[1:16:14] their families and
[1:16:16] they would leave their job for three
[1:16:19] years
[1:16:20] and walk with jesus live almost like a
[1:16:24] nomad
[1:16:26] almost out in the in the open sky
[1:16:30] jesus didn't have a house as a matter of
[1:16:33] fact jesus really didn't have a church
[1:16:35] to preach in
[1:16:40] it's man but yet jesus
[1:16:43] owned it all
[1:16:46] and there was something about his voice
[1:16:48] that when he
[1:16:49] said come follow me
[1:16:55] it's kind of like when it spoke to you
[1:16:58] it was something that just said
[1:17:00] that's real i don't know what it is
[1:17:04] about it but
[1:17:05] but i'm leaving my family i'm leaving my
[1:17:07] home
[1:17:08] i'm going with this man jesus
[1:17:12] jesus was an interesting character
[1:17:16] you see he would go to the temple of
[1:17:18] solomon's place to where that it would
[1:17:20] be and
[1:17:20] they would all be offering their
[1:17:22] sacrifices
[1:17:24] but jesus in his humanity in his earthly
[1:17:28] structure
[1:17:29] as what we can i just term it today
[1:17:33] pastor jesus as he's sitting down he's
[1:17:37] making something interesting today
[1:17:40] he's not making a door
[1:17:43] he's not building a table he's pulling
[1:17:46] together
[1:17:47] some some twine
[1:17:54] and it's going to it
[1:17:57] it's going to be an instrument to which
[1:18:00] that he's going to use
[1:18:03] today in his sermon
[1:18:09] and he comes into the place to which
[1:18:11] david has had solomon to build and
[1:18:14] they've had to
[1:18:15] rework it times again and and over the
[1:18:18] years and now it's become tradition
[1:18:21] and there's all kinds of things that's
[1:18:23] going on and when jesus
[1:18:26] enters the temple
[1:18:29] sometimes he does like when he comes
[1:18:31] into your temple
[1:18:36] he goes through your temple and he
[1:18:38] starts swinging that
[1:18:40] rope
[1:18:43] and he starts beating the sin out of
[1:18:46] your life
[1:18:47] and conquering the demons that's down
[1:18:50] inside of there
[1:18:51] and cleans out your alleys and cleans
[1:18:54] all those things
[1:18:55] out this is the temple to where i want
[1:18:58] to live at
[1:19:02] and satan you can't stay here any longer
[1:19:05] lust you can't stay here sin you can't
[1:19:09] stay here
[1:19:11] temper you can't stay here and so the
[1:19:14] presence of god just goes through
[1:19:16] and starts cleaning it kicking over
[1:19:19] tables and
[1:19:20] chains going in every kind of direction
[1:19:24] you've made my father's house a den of
[1:19:27] thieves
[1:19:32] it's pastor jesus at work maybe you've
[1:19:36] had that same thing in your life
[1:19:39] to where down on the inside of you
[1:19:41] you're so sick of sin
[1:19:43] you can't live another day
[1:19:48] sometimes people say well i'm trying to
[1:19:50] overcome this or i'm trying to overcome
[1:19:52] that
[1:19:53] if you ever hate sin enough
[1:19:56] you ever get to this spot to where you
[1:19:58] hate that sin enough
[1:20:04] so many times people are in love with
[1:20:06] that thing
[1:20:08] and they really don't want to overcome
[1:20:10] it
[1:20:12] but if you ever come to the spot in your
[1:20:14] life
[1:20:15] to where you hate that weakness enough
[1:20:18] you'll come to a spot to where you'll
[1:20:21] invite
[1:20:22] jesus with a platter rope to come and
[1:20:25] take that thing out
[1:20:26] and go down through your tin can alley
[1:20:29] and
[1:20:30] raise you up to a level like you've
[1:20:33] never been at before
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:44] now god is not like this now i'll take
[1:20:46] this one and how
[1:20:47] you get this one i'll take this one and
[1:20:50] you'll get this one
[1:20:51] i'll take this one and you'll get this
[1:20:53] one that isn't how he does this
[1:20:56] he predestinated you before the
[1:20:58] foundation of the world
[1:21:04] he predestinated you before the
[1:21:06] foundation of the world
[1:21:09] you were gods to begin with you with me
[1:21:14] but you were born in sin
[1:21:18] and we quote it we quote it just like
[1:21:20] where the branham did but
[1:21:22] you were born in sin you were shaping in
[1:21:25] iniquity
[1:21:26] you came into this world speaking lies
[1:21:32] nobody trained you to do that you came
[1:21:35] from the dna
[1:21:36] chain but yet god watched over your seat
[1:21:41] you were a diamond in the rough
[1:21:50] until even satan thought you were too
[1:21:52] far in sin
[1:21:56] why god it got in his great infinite
[1:21:59] plan why would he ever pick
[1:22:00] that guy he would bypass
[1:22:04] people with degrees that you could hang
[1:22:06] on a wall
[1:22:07] like a thermometer
[1:22:11] hollywood looking people
[1:22:15] people of of old world
[1:22:19] wealth and god just bypass them
[1:22:25] i find an amazing grace that may be won
[1:22:28] out of a family
[1:22:32] are you with me are you with me our
[1:22:35] prophet was sent
[1:22:36] as a bootlegger's son
[1:22:39] and most of his family would wind up in
[1:22:41] prison
[1:22:43] not throwing stones but he was a
[1:22:45] bootlegger's son
[1:22:47] are you with me and no doubt satan
[1:22:50] laughed
[1:22:52] how can he ever use that boy and then he
[1:22:55] becomes a boxer and
[1:22:56] wins all of his fights but many years
[1:23:00] later in some of the
[1:23:02] same places that he boxed he'll preach
[1:23:10] many people become attached to church
[1:23:13] they get attached to to the to the pull
[1:23:17] in of millions of more in 44
[1:23:20] the programs or the schools or the
[1:23:23] church entity
[1:23:25] maybe trying to find a church that will
[1:23:27] fit
[1:23:28] me
[1:23:32] a mentality of a of a recipe of a church
[1:23:36] that you know that will leave certain
[1:23:38] scriptures alone
[1:23:41] maybe it'll be hair scriptures or maybe
[1:23:43] it'll be
[1:23:45] these kind of things and and it before
[1:23:48] long you you've got the same crowd that
[1:23:50] was at the bar
[1:23:52] is at the church the same crowd that was
[1:23:56] at the strip
[1:23:57] joint was at the church the same crowd
[1:24:00] that was at the rock concerts at the
[1:24:03] church
[1:24:07] are you with me now you just moved from
[1:24:10] one
[1:24:10] coliseum to another
[1:24:14] and you just put on a different outfit
[1:24:20] come on church a lot of times we want to
[1:24:24] fall in love with
[1:24:26] become entangled with the machine of the
[1:24:28] church
[1:24:30] the organization of the church we want
[1:24:33] to become like the pastor we
[1:24:35] will if we're not careful we'll call me
[1:24:37] our hair like him and
[1:24:39] we'll walk like him and talk like him
[1:24:42] and
[1:24:42] and we'll do that i hope none of you do
[1:24:44] none of the above
[1:24:48] but brother ram said we'll take on the
[1:24:50] spirit of the church or
[1:24:51] or the spirit of the pastor but he said
[1:24:54] we must get to christ
[1:25:00] we must get to christ
[1:25:03] don't you love him but the man says oh
[1:25:07] how we need in jeffersonville tonight
[1:25:09] thousands of lived voices
[1:25:12] now let me just explain this the
[1:25:14] rapture's not going to come back and
[1:25:16] take your computer
[1:25:18] it's not going to take your pictures off
[1:25:20] of the wall
[1:25:22] it's not going to take any of the
[1:25:24] saiyans that you've got on the wall
[1:25:26] god's coming to get you
[1:25:29] this is a beautiful building there's
[1:25:31] been phenomenal amount of work done on
[1:25:33] this building to make it beautiful
[1:25:35] but let me just say this to you a
[1:25:38] tornado could take care of this
[1:25:41] a fire could take care of this and we'd
[1:25:44] have to rebuild it and go through all
[1:25:46] that all again
[1:25:47] but let me just say this god's not going
[1:25:50] to rapture a building
[1:25:53] he's coming to rapture human tabernacles
[1:25:58] that he has chosen by his divine
[1:26:03] plan he chose you
[1:26:07] when you couldn't choose yourself
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:12] oh glory to god oh
[1:26:16] glory to god no you say well brother ron
[1:26:19] i was looking for god
[1:26:21] nope you've got that wrong
[1:26:25] you wasn't looking for god it was
[1:26:28] god came looking for you
[1:26:36] you were happy where you was
[1:26:41] you were happy doing what you were doing
[1:26:44] the pleasure of
[1:26:45] sin was incredibly
[1:26:49] joyful in the season
[1:26:54] when is a drunk when is a drunk don't
[1:26:56] like alcohol
[1:26:58] the next day when he's sick but you
[1:27:01] can't convince him that he don't like it
[1:27:04] the night that he's enjoying it
[1:27:10] are you with me satan drives people to
[1:27:13] commit idolatry
[1:27:14] and they're just overwhelmed to be
[1:27:16] involved in that
[1:27:18] knowing it's going to cost that's going
[1:27:20] to come to it
[1:27:23] everybody's sorry after they get caught
[1:27:31] everybody's sorry after they get caught
[1:27:33] and their world has been destroyed by it
[1:27:43] are you with me brother branham said he
[1:27:47] said no
[1:27:48] he said now what's god did for us and
[1:27:50] this cr
[1:27:51] us in christ god manifested in the flesh
[1:27:55] and took his own son up to calvary
[1:27:58] and there he killed his own son on
[1:28:01] calvary as
[1:28:02] a cross to make a covenant with human
[1:28:05] race
[1:28:06] and when he did he nailed him to the
[1:28:08] cross and he
[1:28:09] and and that dead sacrifice it was
[1:28:12] pulled out of him
[1:28:13] the holy spirit into thy hands i commend
[1:28:17] my spirit
[1:28:18] blood running down from his side hands
[1:28:21] and his feet
[1:28:22] and god pulled out the spirit from him
[1:28:25] and shoved the body
[1:28:26] down into the grave and raised it up on
[1:28:29] the third day
[1:28:30] and set it on the right hand and sit
[1:28:33] and sent the rest of the agreement back
[1:28:36] to the church
[1:28:38] which is the holy ghost that was upon
[1:28:41] christ come upon the church
[1:28:46] and the only way in the world we'll ever
[1:28:49] be able to make it at the day
[1:28:51] of the judgment is that for
[1:28:55] for the same holy spirit that was
[1:28:58] upon jesus christ will have to
[1:29:01] dovetail as his wife
[1:29:04] through the body so the same life that
[1:29:08] was in him
[1:29:12] now lives inside of you
[1:29:18] you know when i read about what's going
[1:29:20] to be in heaven
[1:29:22] or what's not going to be in heaven
[1:29:26] makes me excited
[1:29:30] because i don't have any problems when
[1:29:32] it talks about
[1:29:34] there's not going to be any liars
[1:29:37] fornicators idolaters blasphemers
[1:29:42] i'm not that
[1:29:46] i'm not that i can't hardly walk in a
[1:29:49] hardy's today
[1:29:50] and feel comfortable in this world that
[1:29:53] i live in
[1:29:56] but go into that world where there's not
[1:29:59] going to be
[1:29:59] no sin
[1:30:04] come on church
[1:30:12] oh glory i could preach that for a
[1:30:14] little while
[1:30:15] the same holy spirit that was upon jesus
[1:30:18] christ was torn of his body
[1:30:20] to take the life out of him to shed the
[1:30:23] blood of remission of sins and god
[1:30:25] raised up his body
[1:30:26] and set it up on his throne at the right
[1:30:28] hand
[1:30:30] friends if you have received the holy
[1:30:33] spirit
[1:30:35] you are sons and daughters
[1:30:38] of god
[1:30:41] you are the seed of abraham join ours
[1:30:44] with him in the kingdom
[1:30:45] and the same faith that was in abraham
[1:30:48] is in
[1:30:49] every believer tonight
[1:30:53] god by his amazing grace
[1:30:57] called you out of the slot pens of the
[1:31:00] world
[1:31:03] and give you the holy ghost not because
[1:31:06] you deserved it
[1:31:09] but because he called you
[1:31:12] to it unconditionally
[1:31:16] not because you were good
[1:31:26] there's nothing bores me any more more
[1:31:30] than when people start telling me how
[1:31:32] great they are
[1:31:38] i went and preached for a man one time
[1:31:40] that took me out and i'm not going to
[1:31:42] say a whole lot about it because he
[1:31:43] might be watching this morning he
[1:31:46] entertained me all day
[1:31:47] got me back just to the motel about 40
[1:31:50] minutes before i was supposed to leave
[1:31:52] and go to his church to preach that
[1:31:54] night
[1:31:54] and he told me how great he was all day
[1:32:00] fed me a hot dog with beans on it
[1:32:04] put cheese on top of it i'll order for
[1:32:07] you i don't like people ordering for me
[1:32:14] hey listen i'm real i'm as real as you
[1:32:15] can get
[1:32:18] there's certain things i eat
[1:32:24] and there are certain things i don't eat
[1:32:27] and if i don't like it i'll start taking
[1:32:29] that fork and i'll do like titus
[1:32:32] i'll just push it in a direction make it
[1:32:34] look like at least i attempted
[1:32:43] the stuff i eat makes me fat
[1:32:50] are you with me
[1:32:54] and he showed me pictures of all of his
[1:32:56] family and i said what do they do what
[1:32:58] you know will i will i meet them tonight
[1:33:01] no none of them serve the lord we're
[1:33:03] still praying
[1:33:07] and i began to think we have a church
[1:33:09] and our family don't want to serve the
[1:33:11] lord
[1:33:14] what kind of a ministry do we have
[1:33:19] i'm going to preach to you it may not be
[1:33:22] long but i'm going to preach to you
[1:33:24] if this don't live at home
[1:33:28] if this don't live at your dinner table
[1:33:32] if this don't live in your office then
[1:33:35] don't try your recipe on me
[1:33:43] well amen anyway
[1:33:48] hallelujah
[1:33:51] glory glory glory glory glory
[1:33:54] now remember god is the one that's done
[1:33:58] to choosing
[1:34:00] god is the one that dies the gathering
[1:34:04] now notice brother branham says in the
[1:34:06] sumerian church age he says now
[1:34:08] those who are the royal seed are the
[1:34:11] elect of god
[1:34:13] are the predestinated foreknown of god
[1:34:16] and we're in their
[1:34:17] mind of god and in his thoughts in the
[1:34:19] very plain language
[1:34:20] the true bride of christ was in the mind
[1:34:24] of god
[1:34:25] eternally though not expressed until
[1:34:30] each
[1:34:30] came forth in its designated decreed
[1:34:34] season
[1:34:35] as each member came forth it became
[1:34:38] expressed
[1:34:40] and it took its place in the body thus
[1:34:43] this bride is the literal
[1:34:46] spoken word seed blood
[1:34:52] i'm just told you what you are just as
[1:34:55] much as god said let there be a son
[1:34:59] let there be a moon god knew what day
[1:35:02] you'd be born he pre-planned you he knew
[1:35:04] how tall you would be
[1:35:06] what color heritage you'd have what
[1:35:08] color eyes that you would have
[1:35:12] and how contankerous you would be
[1:35:15] and then he gave you a spirit a new
[1:35:18] spirit
[1:35:19] and then gave you the holy spirit
[1:35:22] had to give you a new spirit where he
[1:35:24] could live with you
[1:35:26] and then give you the holy spirit where
[1:35:29] you could overcome the world
[1:35:32] oh glory to god he said we did not
[1:35:36] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[1:35:40] therefore we could be reborn
[1:35:46] and because we were seed
[1:35:51] it's the reason you could be quickened
[1:35:54] so the same word that goes by you
[1:35:57] and you thought your mother and father
[1:35:59] would get it and all your family would
[1:36:01] get it
[1:36:02] you got it they didn't get it
[1:36:05] it's because god deposited something in
[1:36:07] you
[1:36:08] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:21] now it's not for you to get snoot knows
[1:36:23] with it
[1:36:24] it's for you to praise god that got rich
[1:36:27] in mercy
[1:36:31] it's not for you to think i'm better
[1:36:33] than somebody else
[1:36:35] but god rich in mercy saw a diamond in
[1:36:38] the rough
[1:36:39] and said i choose him i place myself in
[1:36:43] him
[1:36:49] because in non-seed there's nothing to
[1:36:52] quicken
[1:36:57] let's think about pastor jesus can you
[1:36:59] give me
[1:37:01] just a few more minutes this great
[1:37:04] shepherd
[1:37:08] now let's just say it like this as as
[1:37:10] he's a great shepherd
[1:37:14] he begins to go and gather to his church
[1:37:20] he said i haven't come to call the
[1:37:22] righteous
[1:37:24] to repentance
[1:37:29] he didn't go to the church world
[1:37:32] and say okay i'm going to gather you
[1:37:35] pharisees and sadducees
[1:37:38] as a matter of fact you find jesus gave
[1:37:40] them a very rough time
[1:37:45] but jesus finds himself sitting with the
[1:37:47] woman at the well
[1:37:50] and let me just say most churches would
[1:37:53] not have wanted her
[1:37:54] in their church
[1:38:01] most churches wouldn't have wanted her
[1:38:03] at their church
[1:38:05] most churches would not have wanted
[1:38:07] peter
[1:38:11] that was naked on a boat screaming
[1:38:14] cursing and jesus said come follow me
[1:38:19] you know that's probably what made the
[1:38:21] devil laugh
[1:38:24] you know for a while i thought he was
[1:38:25] the messiah but look what he's picking
[1:38:27] for his church
[1:38:32] it might make him laugh today at what's
[1:38:41] the woman that sat at his feet and found
[1:38:43] her way
[1:38:46] to the place to where that she could
[1:38:50] wash his feet
[1:38:53] no doubt would have not been welcomed in
[1:38:55] a lot of places
[1:38:58] but if you remember she was the reason
[1:39:02] that jesus goes
[1:39:06] simon thought that he was the reason
[1:39:09] because simon was going to bring him to
[1:39:11] make fun of him
[1:39:13] but jesus seeing what's going to happen
[1:39:15] this afternoon
[1:39:17] he comes knowing they're not going to
[1:39:19] put a robe on me
[1:39:20] they're not going to wash my feet
[1:39:22] they're not going to perfume me
[1:39:24] they're not going to make me welcome but
[1:39:26] she's going to come
[1:39:31] she's going to come and because she's a
[1:39:34] predestinated seed
[1:39:38] they won't offer her up at the temple
[1:39:41] they won't offer her the fountain of
[1:39:43] purity
[1:39:45] my feet is the only place that
[1:39:48] she can find forgiveness
[1:39:52] come on help me preach now help me
[1:39:56] preach now
[1:39:57] so many times we come to church
[1:40:02] and we forget to entertain jesus
[1:40:06] we'll find our pew and we'll forget to
[1:40:09] entertain
[1:40:10] jesus we'll listen to the singing
[1:40:13] and we'll forget to entertain jesus
[1:40:16] we'll listen to the sermon
[1:40:18] and we'll forget to entertain jesus
[1:40:24] it's our tears not
[1:40:27] simon that we're wanting to impress
[1:40:37] i came to this revelation many years ago
[1:40:41] i examine
[1:40:45] who i'm trying to impress
[1:40:49] if i'm trying to impress somebody in the
[1:40:51] world
[1:40:57] i don't want no part of it
[1:41:01] i don't know part of it need a job gotta
[1:41:04] have friends in the world
[1:41:06] gotta have business associates in the
[1:41:08] world but let me just say
[1:41:10] i'm not headed in the same direction as
[1:41:12] them
[1:41:16] this is only a temporary situation
[1:41:20] don't sell your soul for a temporary
[1:41:22] situation
[1:41:25] sometimes you get in a jam in life but
[1:41:27] don't sell your soul for a temporary
[1:41:30] situation
[1:41:32] i gotta have a job and it takes me out
[1:41:34] into the world and i'm gone
[1:41:36] and i'm away from my family over and
[1:41:38] over again don't sell your soul
[1:41:40] for a temporary situation
[1:41:45] hey listen i just gave advice i might as
[1:41:47] well give it this would give it to you

[1:44:46] jesus just let her wash
[1:44:50] and she didn't have a bowl of water but
[1:44:53] she washed with her tears
[1:44:57] and she didn't have a towel but she
[1:44:59] dried with her hair
[1:45:04] and she had all of her money tied up in
[1:45:07] that
[1:45:07] perfume that she was getting ready to
[1:45:09] give
[1:45:14] and there was people in the room said he
[1:45:17] could you know if he was a real shepherd
[1:45:19] or a real pastor he could have done
[1:45:21] something with that money
[1:45:26] but he let her open it and the perfume
[1:45:29] filled the whole room and she began to
[1:45:32] pour it out
[1:45:34] and brother branham said she became a
[1:45:38] mess
[1:45:39] and she was the perfume was all over
[1:45:43] and she was washing his feet and
[1:45:46] perfuming it
[1:45:48] and it got all in her hair he said you
[1:45:51] need to get the smell of jesus
[1:45:54] on you
[1:45:58] [Applause]
[1:46:10] i want to think about this just for a
[1:46:12] moment
[1:46:14] jesus's table at the end is going to be
[1:46:16] filled
[1:46:18] and there's people that have refused to
[1:46:20] listen
[1:46:22] to the word and they came to it and they
[1:46:25] walked
[1:46:26] away and they came to and i'm not just
[1:46:28] talking about
[1:46:29] this day but i'm talking about in every
[1:46:31] age
[1:46:34] but he commands them to go out into the
[1:46:39] street
[1:46:41] and get the blind the hot
[1:46:44] the main
[1:46:49] could we call them the unqualified
[1:46:57] could we call them us could you say that
[1:47:00] with me us
[1:47:03] i know it might be hard to say it but us
[1:47:08] so i want you to think about just for a
[1:47:09] moment just as i would come to a wind up
[1:47:12] here
[1:47:17] some of brother branham's personal
[1:47:20] people that you know his ministry
[1:47:23] gathered in the tens of hundreds of
[1:47:25] thousands maybe millions
[1:47:27] but in his personal life
[1:47:31] he gathered a burp call
[1:47:36] you know what brother brahma said about
[1:47:37] burke call he said the meanest man i've
[1:47:40] ever met in my life
[1:47:46] that's what he said he says meanest man
[1:47:47] i've ever met in my life and here god
[1:47:50] has him to go to burke paul and be
[1:47:52] hunting with him
[1:47:53] and lead him to the lord
[1:47:57] brother branham in his early ministry
[1:47:59] has a woman that is a dancer
[1:48:02] and her name is nelly saunders
[1:48:06] and he's got a friend that's a drunk
[1:48:08] that didn't get it but
[1:48:09] he's got a friend that's a drunk and
[1:48:12] remember nellie saunders comes to the
[1:48:13] house
[1:48:15] nellie had came to church and got a work
[1:48:17] of grace and
[1:48:18] and then she goes by the the town hall
[1:48:21] where they were playing the music
[1:48:23] and she stopped to listen
[1:48:26] now god didn't give her up and throw it
[1:48:30] away
[1:48:32] help me preach i will build my church
[1:48:35] and nellie saunders walks out and once
[1:48:38] she gets done at the town hall she says
[1:48:40] i've sinned i've obama i've did the
[1:48:42] abomination i i i've uh i'm no way could
[1:48:45] god handle me now
[1:48:46] or receive me now and she goes by
[1:48:48] brother branham and brother brown begins
[1:48:50] to pray for

[1:49:10] take care of you

[1:52:19] uh i'd like to give you a preventive
[1:52:22] thing and then i'm done
[1:52:26] da vinci painted the lord's supper
[1:52:31] da vinci is known as one of the greatest
[1:52:33] painters or scientists
[1:52:36] or architects of the field amen
[1:52:39] and he was known for the study of
[1:52:40] humanity as a matter of fact he took
[1:52:43] away
[1:52:44] took actually took corpses apart for
[1:52:46] decades
[1:52:48] to be able to figure out how to paint
[1:52:49] him the best
[1:52:55] and his last painting or his painting
[1:52:58] that he
[1:52:58] was his masterpiece was the lord's
[1:53:01] supper
[1:53:08] and so he looked for six months
[1:53:12] to find the most innocent looking man
[1:53:15] that he could find
[1:53:16] to paint jesus
[1:53:20] and he found this man
[1:53:24] and he painted jesus after painting
[1:53:28] jesus
[1:53:29] he spent six years on painting the
[1:53:31] disciples
[1:53:35] and after painting the disciples now
[1:53:39] he spends almost a year looking for a
[1:53:41] man that is so
[1:53:42] evil
[1:53:46] that he could portray the man judas
[1:53:51] he went into prisons all over
[1:53:54] finally in rome there's a man that's
[1:53:58] getting ready to be put to death
[1:54:01] and being going to be put to death
[1:54:02] anyway but he looks so horrible somebody
[1:54:05] sends a
[1:54:06] word to da vinci this might be your man
[1:54:12] and so they bring him and da vinci
[1:54:15] paints
[1:54:16] judas from this man's structure
[1:54:21] and this man set speechless before
[1:54:24] da vinci's six months and he studies
[1:54:27] every line in his face
[1:54:28] and his hair and everything
[1:54:32] and at the end where he's finally done
[1:54:34] this man breaks loose from the guard and
[1:54:36] he comes and
[1:54:37] grabs da vinci and he says
[1:54:41] don't you know who i am you met
[1:54:44] me before
[1:54:47] and he said no sir i've studied your
[1:54:50] face for six months and i can tell you
[1:54:52] for a surety
[1:54:53] i never met you
[1:54:56] now here's the greatest painter the
[1:54:59] greatest artist
[1:55:01] in the world at that time
[1:55:05] and judas this man that just has
[1:55:07] portrayed judas for
[1:55:09] these six months tells him but
[1:55:12] i stood as jesus
[1:55:19] seven years ago i stood as jesus
[1:55:23] and he just looked at him and he said
[1:55:25] how far
[1:55:28] sin has took you
[1:55:36] now think about this i'm not giving you
[1:55:39] some
[1:55:40] story there it is
[1:55:44] but how far sin takes a person
[1:55:49] you're going to be a temple for
[1:55:51] something
[1:55:54] your friends are a temple of something
[1:55:59] young people your friends are a temple
[1:56:01] of something
[1:56:02] they're representing something
[1:56:10] yesterday race cars went by us
[1:56:13] with little markers on the side of their
[1:56:16] their car and and they're
[1:56:20] they're in the race across america
[1:56:23] and i saw sister connie because she now
[1:56:25] drives me now everywhere i go i beg to
[1:56:28] drive and she just looks over and smiles
[1:56:33] but i don't have no stickers on the car
[1:56:36] and i felt that van
[1:56:37] lunge and take about a 10 mile per hour
[1:56:42] and i looked over at her and said have
[1:56:43] we entered the race
[1:56:58] many people will color the hair a
[1:56:59] certain color because of their rock star
[1:57:04] many people will wear a shirt michael
[1:57:06] jordan ain't paying you for that baby
[1:57:12] the dallas cowboys are not paying me to
[1:57:14] wear their star
[1:57:16] nor the kansas city chiefs nor the green
[1:57:19] bay packers
[1:57:21] i just sometimes pick the hat up cause i
[1:57:23] like the color
[1:57:26] if it make me look younger i worked
[1:57:39] but i don't get paid for that
[1:57:42] but when jesus came into my life
[1:57:47] he told me he'd give me eternal life
[1:57:50] and he made me a promise
[1:57:54] this world offers you none of that
[1:58:02] brother brandon made a statement and i
[1:58:04] end it with this
[1:58:06] he said if i spent my whole life and
[1:58:09] then he yet sent me to hell
[1:58:11] he said i'd serve him all over again
[1:58:14] he said because it was worth living as
[1:58:20] the musicians come i want to share this
[1:58:22] with you
[1:58:23] young people let me say this to you you
[1:58:26] want a wife or a husband you can trust
[1:58:32] because a real christian will get his
[1:58:34] lazy self out of bed
[1:58:37] and go to work
[1:58:51] and will provide for his family
[1:58:55] and and he'll come home and he'll pray
[1:58:57] with his children
[1:58:58] and he'll love his children and it won't
[1:59:00] be a house of arguing and fussing
[1:59:03] and abuse
[1:59:08] and you say well brother ron this is for
[1:59:10] out there on the internet my husband's
[1:59:11] an abuser

[1:59:34] reason
