[47:03] for a moment don't let them run away
[47:05] from you you can keep your feet to
[47:09] however you want to do you can sit down
[47:11] stand up just whatever you do today just
[47:13] praise the Lord
[47:16] may a man a man God is so gracious to us
[47:22] and to see his wonderful acts amongst us
[47:25] what a mighty God that we serve I sent a
[47:29] clip a little scripture that I was
[47:31] reading in Psalms reading this morning
[47:33] over in Psalms chapter one 19 and 16
[47:35] David said that I would delight myself
[47:37] in thy statues that I will not forget
[47:40] thy words and when we delight ourselves
[47:42] in something we won't forget it is that
[47:45] right if it's a pleasant time in the
[47:47] Lord you won't forget it if it if it's a
[47:49] drab time for you you'll forget these
[47:52] things but I can tell you for the
[47:53] children of God I don't think there's
[47:55] ever a drab time and his presence but
[47:57] it's things that we delight ourselves in
[48:00] the Lord and we know that we have a
[48:02] faithful high priest that is standing
[48:03] amongst us today that is more than able
[48:06] to meet the needs that we would present
[48:07] to him today we want to continue to lift
[48:10] up our pastor brother Ron he'll be
[48:12] speaking for us this morning we ask that
[48:14] the Lord would use him in a mighty way
[48:16] were so thrilled with what the Lord is
[48:18] doing in his life and we can truly say
[48:21] that we're seeing miracles in front of
[48:24] us we started out this this year with
[48:26] the theme that we will see miracles and
[48:28] if you have not seen a miracle you have
[48:31] not got your eyes open
[48:33] hallelujah to have our pastor standing
[48:36] in this pulpit today is an absolute
[48:40] miracle
[48:41] I say blessed be the name of the Lord
[48:44] blessed be his holy name the doctors
[48:48] told him they was given in four months
[48:50] when they gave him when they seen the
[48:51] brain tumor for the very first time they
[48:54] told him you've probably got about four
[48:55] months to live I told you he had a knack
[48:58] for breaking what the doctors had said
[49:00] and that don't surprise me because it's
[49:02] not Ron Spencer it's Elohim so I'm so
[49:06] thankful to know that he's in our
[49:07] presence so we want to continue to lift
[49:09] up brother on and pray for him today
[49:11] that God would use him in a special way
[49:13] to be able to speak to us and the people
[49:15] in Edmonton today that God would bless

[1:05:09] to my family and in Edmonton Canada as
[1:05:13] well this morning we certainly love you
[1:05:17] with all of our hearts and brother
[1:05:18] Harold and sister Lian and brother and
[1:05:22] and sister sandy and brother Moses that
[1:05:26] Minister there what a team that they
[1:05:29] have and what an a group of people that
[1:05:31] they have there we certainly love you
[1:05:33] with all of our hearts as well as the
[1:05:35] people here you know sometimes Satan
[1:05:39] thinks he's got us all buffaloed and it
[1:05:45] just seems like you can't be in touch
[1:05:47] with one another but God knows how to
[1:05:49] arrange things and so amen we love you
[1:05:54] with all of our hearts and we love you
[1:05:56] there we wish we could be there they've
[1:06:00] they've got me restricted flying right
[1:06:02] now for the for the time being because
[1:06:05] of the tumors and and different things
[1:06:08] but I believe that will resolve itself
[1:06:10] before long and so I'd like to thank you
[1:06:14] this would be my first time addressing
[1:06:17] you in Edmonton but I'd like to thank
[1:06:19] you for your prayers over the last
[1:06:21] months and I remember 12 years ago you
[1:06:24] prayed for me that when I came through
[1:06:26] the burns that my face would not be
[1:06:28] disfigured and you prayed as a body of
[1:06:32] believers brother Harold who has been my
[1:06:35] buddy hero for so long and and we've
[1:06:39] traveled and did a lot of things
[1:06:41] together and and and so we brother
[1:06:47] Harold had you as an audience to pray
[1:06:49] that my face would not scar in the
[1:06:51] Bernsen and it didn't and we thank the
[1:06:55] Lord for that
[1:06:57] I don't know particularly what you
[1:06:59] prayed for on this journey but over the
[1:07:02] last six months since about Christmas
[1:07:04] when we were diagnosed with cancer and
[1:07:07] then Stage four and brain cancer and
[1:07:10] then lung cancer
[1:07:11] I don't know particularly what part that
[1:07:13] you decided to pray for but I'd like to
[1:07:16] thank you for praying for that part and
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:29] what you don't realize only a few weeks
[1:07:32] ago I was hardly able to stand in the
[1:07:34] pool fit to speak but this morning I
[1:07:36] feel strong as they did in December I'm
[1:07:40] thinking the Lord for that
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:51] hallelujah it's a paradox we're just at
[1:07:56] the prep just before they doubled the
[1:07:58] chemo and you know the medicine is the
[1:08:01] same but you see a couple of weeks ago
[1:08:04] we were inspired to make a trip 17 hours
[1:08:08] and to be with brother Tim Pruitt and
[1:08:11] his wife in the situation that is going
[1:08:14] on there but it was during the service
[1:08:16] just previous before that that I must
[1:08:18] get to Jesus you know sometimes God
[1:08:22] could heal us right exactly where we are
[1:08:24] but I felt that inspiration in the
[1:08:27] middle of the night that spoke to me you
[1:08:30] spoke it and it seemed like an insane
[1:08:37] trip but and I spoke to Andrew about it
[1:08:40] and he made the arrangements very
[1:08:42] quickly and and brother Alden and
[1:08:44] brother Adam quickly agreed to drive
[1:08:48] that trip secretly because nobody else
[1:08:52] wanted me to make such a trip as that
[1:08:54] but I just felt on my heart I had to get
[1:08:57] get there and it was in a prayer meeting
[1:09:01] on Tuesday night that the Lord came in a
[1:09:04] supernatural wagon did an incredible
[1:09:07] work for us and we since that night it's
[1:09:13] not been the same
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:23] a man
[1:09:24] a man so you continue to pray for us as
[1:09:29] we we journey through the different
[1:09:31] curves and we certainly love you this is
[1:09:35] your body as well and we as from
[1:09:40] Virginia love you with all of our hearts
[1:09:42] and you know we didn't have to buy a
[1:09:45] ticket we did have to eat airplane food
[1:09:53] we didn't have to worry about being on a
[1:09:55] schedule we're not sleeping in a hotel
[1:10:00] room hallelujah and we're going to have
[1:10:08] service together here this morning
[1:10:11] amen
[1:10:13] [Music]
[1:10:20] amen brother Harold felt that this was
[1:10:24] the will of the Lord and I just felt an
[1:10:26] unction of the Spirit of God as we begin
[1:10:29] to make some preparations and I Andrew
[1:10:33] as Andrew as you know does most of our
[1:10:35] preparing now and what an awesome job
[1:10:38] that he did last night but the things
[1:10:42] that he does behind the scenes it's just
[1:10:44] incredible and and in this season of
[1:10:47] life he's just been a lifesaver to me
[1:10:50] and I thought last night was as good as
[1:10:54] I've ever heard him preach and so a man
[1:10:57] I hope you enjoyed it there in Edmonton
[1:11:02] this was already on my heart before I
[1:11:05] knew anything about the Edmonton
[1:11:07] meetings and so I believe that this
[1:11:10] morning is going to be epic for not just
[1:11:13] here but for Edmonton and a lot of
[1:11:17] places and so and so I begin and I want
[1:11:22] to lay a little groundwork for not just
[1:11:24] Edmonton but also for you when God
[1:11:29] inspires us to speak a sermon
[1:11:31] God uses man he doesn't he doesn't use a
[1:11:37] piano to speak his word he doesn't use a
[1:11:40] guitar he uses man and he uses us to
[1:11:46] speak and many times it's even in
[1:11:49] prophetic words that he is using and
[1:11:54] sometimes we're sitting in a service and
[1:11:57] cannot fathom what he's doing even as a
[1:12:02] speaker even as a speaker we don't
[1:12:07] understand what he's doing in the moment
[1:12:10] that he's doing it until that we can
[1:12:13] look back and see that God was
[1:12:18] orchestrating some events
[1:12:22] how many of ever said in a service to
[1:12:25] wear that that you were said in there
[1:12:28] and you maybe went 30 40 minutes in the
[1:12:31] service and then all the sudden you
[1:12:32] realized he's talking to me
[1:12:37] he's the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:12:40] the intents of the hearts he he knows
[1:12:43] exactly what's going on and he can
[1:12:46] gather thousands of people together and
[1:12:48] yet be so intimate Kelly comes to you
[1:12:53] and that service and you go did they
[1:12:56] pick out that service just for me so
[1:13:03] last year I was I was just being pushed
[1:13:07] to war driven to order a thought and
[1:13:10] that thought I would deliver it in a
[1:13:13] couple of different places one of which
[1:13:15] would be Edmonton and an Edmond and I
[1:13:20] would speak it and I think it was one of
[1:13:22] the first places that I spoke it and I
[1:13:25] think I came home and spoke it later
[1:13:27] here and that sermon would be take it
[1:13:32] back and I I don't want to do this by
[1:13:36] redundance but I but I want to look back
[1:13:39] at that being prophecy and I want to
[1:13:42] look at this as being fulfilled
[1:13:45] where yes because they would say that
[1:13:49] there's very few people has been through
[1:13:51] what we have been through in the last
[1:13:54] six months one side of the trial and now
[1:13:58] on the other side of the trial with a
[1:14:00] lot of with a lot of uncertainty in
[1:14:03] front and Satan's saying a lot of things
[1:14:05] in front of us but we're going to make a
[1:14:07] declaration and I feel anointed to make
[1:14:12] a declaration it's time to pursue it
[1:14:17] and overtake it and have a full
[1:14:23] restoration could you agree with us as

[1:14:47] not the only one in this boat and so if
[1:14:50] Satan stole some stuff from you
[1:14:52] today's a good day to put him on notice
[1:14:58] this is more than a service this is more
[1:15:03] than a sermon this is more than a
[1:15:05] preacher we're just not any church we're
[1:15:09] the bride of Jesus Christ and this is an
[1:15:13] open book and we're people of the open

[1:15:50] shall not want he maketh me to lie down
[1:15:54] in green pastures and he leadeth me
[1:15:56] beside the still waters
[1:15:58] and it restores my soul and he leadeth
[1:16:01] me in the paths of righteousness for his
[1:16:04] name's sake
[1:16:06] Wow here's a scripture we're fulfilling
[1:16:10] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:16:12] the shadow of death I will fear no evil

[1:16:36] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[1:16:40] my head with all in my cup runneth over
[1:16:43] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:16:46] me all the days of my life and I will
[1:16:50] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:16:53] amen you may be seated may the Lord
[1:16:55] bless the reading of his words this
[1:16:57] morning I want to go to the end of the
[1:17:02] book in revelations 21 and verse 1 and I
[1:17:08] saw a new heaven and a new earth for the
[1:17:12] first heaven and the first Earth were
[1:17:14] wrought were passed away and there was
[1:17:17] no more sea and I John saw the holy city
[1:17:21] the New Jerusalem coming down from God
[1:17:24] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[1:17:27] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[1:17:30] great voice out of heaven saying behold
[1:17:33] the tabernacle of God is with men and he
[1:17:36] will dwell with them and they shall be
[1:17:38] his people and God himself shall be with
[1:17:42] them and be their God how many of you
[1:17:46] believe that you're a part of that
[1:17:48] promise before we go any further this
[1:17:52] morning in the infinite mind of God I'm
[1:17:58] a part of that promise so if he could
[1:18:02] get you here if he could watch over all
[1:18:10] your gene seed all the way since Adam
[1:18:13] and he could get you here can he get you
[1:18:20] there
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:27] hallelujah
[1:18:29] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:18:32] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:18:37] death neither sorrow or crime as human
[1:18:45] beings we can't compromise even
[1:18:47] comprehend a world with no death no
[1:18:55] tears of agony no sorrow no dying we
[1:19:04] cannot compromise even comprehend a
[1:19:07] forest with it
[1:19:10] with no dead leaves laying at it not one
[1:19:15] blade of grass dead no rose wilted but
[1:19:22] we're headed to such a lamp he that
[1:19:27] setteth upon the throne
[1:19:29] sis behold I make all things new and he
[1:19:33] said unto me write these words are true
[1:19:36] and faithful God says these words that I
[1:19:40] have just spoke to you John are true
[1:19:45] and faithful and he said unto me it is
[1:19:51] done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:19:56] and the end and I will give unto them
[1:19:59] that is athirst of the fountain of water
[1:20:02] of the life freely hallelujah
[1:20:07] he that overcometh shall I in shall
[1:20:13] inherit all things Kris this is for you
[1:20:19] what you call your name this is for me
[1:20:23] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:20:31] son now the one that wrote it like that
[1:20:35] is also the one that wrote it like this
[1:20:38] in Psalms 27 through David his prophet
[1:20:43] the the Lord is my light and my
[1:20:45] salvation of whom shall I feel the Lord
[1:20:51] is the strength of my life of whom shall
[1:20:54] I be afraid when the wicked and even my
[1:20:57] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[1:21:00] my flesh they stumbled and fell though a
[1:21:02] host should encamp against me my heart
[1:21:05] shall not fear the war should rise
[1:21:07] against me and this will I be confident
[1:21:11] one thing I have desired of the Lord
[1:21:15] that I will seek after that I may dwell
[1:21:17] in the house of the Lord forever
[1:21:19] how never lose my focus no matter how
[1:21:23] bad the battle come on church so many
[1:21:30] people blame everybody around them
[1:21:32] because of their battle because of their
[1:21:35] discourage him because of what they're
[1:21:37] going through never lose your focus
[1:21:40] because of what you're going through
[1:21:47] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:21:50] me in his pavilion in the secret of his
[1:21:54] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:21:57] me upon a rock and now shut my head be
[1:22:01] lifted up above my enemies round about
[1:22:04] their fall I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:22:08] sacrifices of joy I will sing I will
[1:22:14] sing praises unto the Lord not the choir
[1:22:21] will sing for me or my favorite singers
[1:22:24] were sinful men but in the midst of all
[1:22:28] of the trouble when the world is falling
[1:22:30] apart political systems have fallen
[1:22:34] apart churches are falling apart people
[1:22:37] are falling apart come on church stay
[1:22:43] with me I will encourage myself I will
[1:22:48] stop when I'm the only one standing
[1:22:50] there by myself
[1:22:52] I won't begin to sink I won't begin to
[1:22:56] lift my spirits I will begin to
[1:22:58] fellowship with Almighty God for in the
[1:23:01] time of trouble in in Revelation chapter
[1:23:09] 3 in verse 20 behold I stand at the door
[1:23:13] and knock Jesus is standing at this door
[1:23:16] and knocking and If any man will hear my
[1:23:19] voice and open the door I will come in
[1:23:22] to him and will sup with him and he with
[1:23:26] me now notice these words
[1:23:29] to him that overcometh not to him that
[1:23:33] survived us not to give that just mix
[1:23:41] away or to him that serves God on Sunday
[1:23:48] and then it's different the rest of them
[1:23:54] yes but to him that overcometh will I
[1:24:01] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:24:03] as I also overcame and I've sat down
[1:24:07] with my father in his throne revelations
[1:24:11] chapter 12 forgive me he says and I
[1:24:14] heard a loud voice in heaven saying now
[1:24:18] there comes a junction now is come
[1:24:21] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[1:24:26] of our Lord and the power of his Christ
[1:24:29] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:24:32] down which accused them before our God
[1:24:35] day and night and they overcame him and
[1:24:42] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:24:46] Lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:24:53] you've got to take this personal
[1:24:57] nobody's going to overcome for you but
[1:25:01] you I want you to say this with you
[1:25:07] nobody's going to overcome for me but me

[1:25:31] individual the Word of God this ain't
[1:26:17] magic this ain't some special spell or
[1:26:22] some special recipe this ain't just
[1:26:28] magic quotes magic words this isn't some
[1:26:34] myth of Hollywood this is not
[1:26:37] churchianity you have been placed in
[1:26:42] Laodicea the wickedest work condition
[1:26:47] the world has ever seen it is a world
[1:26:52] that put Jesus outside of the door and
[1:26:55] said they don't need him in their home
[1:26:57] in their churches in their governments
[1:27:02] they took their Ten Commandments down
[1:27:05] and told God they didn't need it and
[1:27:07] churches became weak pulpits men became
[1:27:12] sissies wait with me don't believe it on
[1:27:18] the governess don't believe it on the
[1:27:20] presidents don't blame it on the king´s
[1:27:22] overseas come on Trix we have we are
[1:27:28] reaping the seeds that have been sold
[1:27:32] but God also made some sowing
[1:27:37] he has showed a bride in this interim
[1:27:41] that will not Bend and will not bow but
[1:27:45] she will take the Word of God and she
[1:27:49] will prevail
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:28:11] baby idiot lazy boy brother on people
[1:28:20] fall away we had this conversation
[1:28:23] coming down the road people do this
[1:28:26] people does that people dress this way
[1:28:28] people dress that way and people have
[1:28:30] that kind of music people are caught up
[1:28:32] with this and people are caught up with
[1:28:34] that and I just finally said to to
[1:28:37] sister Cluny and sister Nancy I said
[1:28:40] well Jesus had some words for that Jesus
[1:28:44] was on his way of the cross and people
[1:28:47] were doing everything in the world and
[1:28:49] people are doing all of that and doing
[1:28:50] all of that and the disciples we're
[1:28:53] talking about it and Jesus just spoke up
[1:28:55] said what is that to you let's just
[1:29:03] examine it just a moment oh but my loved
[1:29:06] ones are doing that they're just don't
[1:29:10] you know they're just nothing but cosmic
[1:29:12] dust and if they don't reach for mercy
[1:29:17] there's a hell but they are sending
[1:29:21] themselves there it's not you it's not
[1:29:27] you they rejected the light you accepted
[1:29:32] the light and they rejected to light and
[1:29:34] it puts you on two complete different
[1:29:37] paths even Spurgeon would say they're
[1:29:52] just dust
[1:30:01] I'm supposed to take it easy Romans 8
[1:30:18] and verse 31
[1:30:23] what shall we then say to these things
[1:30:28] now let's just look at where we're at
[1:30:31] just now and I I don't want to spend 30
[1:30:34] minutes here but let's just look at
[1:30:35] where we're at right now with the world
[1:30:38] falling apart but it's supposed to do
[1:30:42] that but the bride has been gathered and
[1:30:46] we were supposed to be gathered and
[1:30:49] where did he gathered us from from all
[1:30:52] ends of the earth we didn't gather
[1:30:55] ourselves to this message God gathered
[1:30:58] us to this message and we heard a voice
[1:31:02] and it was real and that voice gathered
[1:31:05] us to this word and we just recognized
[1:31:08] the word and the word spoke volumes to
[1:31:12] us and it became real so he gathers you
[1:31:21] thought you were in control of your life
[1:31:23] and then you recognize God was in
[1:31:26] control
[1:31:28] then we recognized that we were
[1:31:30] pre-planned before the foundational
[1:31:32] world we recognized we were in the mind
[1:31:36] of God we recognize that we're part of
[1:31:39] an orchestration that God has taken part
[1:31:42] in and whether it was Abraham or Sarah
[1:31:45] or Rahab or me a Meyer a Jeremiah and
[1:31:49] Mabel or Gomer or for whatever matter
[1:31:53] their names were called in the scripture
[1:31:55] whether it was Shamgar that would defeat
[1:31:58] six hundred men and and of all of the
[1:32:01] entire Bible God uses one scripture to
[1:32:04] tell his life story where it was that
[1:32:07] the woman into well that brother Branham
[1:32:09] would use night after night after night
[1:32:10] and she goes to a well and she's had
[1:32:14] five husbands and the one she's living
[1:32:18] with not her husband but she goes to the
[1:32:21] well and Jesus sends his disciples away
[1:32:23] and Jesus goes to the well and waits on
[1:32:27] her he was gathering the seed and that's
[1:32:33] what he's even doing today he's
[1:32:35] gathering his seed and in the matter of
[1:32:42] a little bit of a conversation
[1:32:45] she recognizes this is the Messiah Oh
[1:32:50] brethren I don't know how that new birth
[1:32:53] works let me just say you can't meet
[1:32:55] Jesus and walk away the same person I
[1:33:02] don't know I don't understand all the
[1:33:05] mysteries you can't make Jesus of this
[1:33:07] word and walk away the same person oh
[1:33:11] you might say I don't know how that fits
[1:33:14] together how I fit in it but let me just
[1:33:16] say this - God's got a plan for your
[1:33:19] life
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:35] if God be for us who can be against us
[1:33:43] now we're just laying some things down
[1:33:45] here and he that spared not his own son
[1:33:53] but delivered him up for us all how
[1:34:01] shall he not with him also freely give
[1:34:09] us all things now you thought I was just
[1:34:19] being a little dyslexic reading my works
[1:34:22] slow he's telling you brother Nathaniel
[1:34:29] there's nothing in the book he will hold
[1:34:33] nothing nothing are you catching that
[1:34:57] then why can't we believe for all things
[1:35:05] then why can't we believe for all things
[1:35:08] but better on some things are impossible
[1:35:12] are they are they are they are they are
[1:35:23] they look at your net but are they what
[1:35:31] a Bunny's grace waited what about his
[1:35:40] grace don't be surprised at this very
[1:35:45] last end as we're coming toward the
[1:35:48] raptured days as we're coming in people
[1:35:51] that come to the well that are so
[1:35:54] disqualified that have such filthy lives
[1:36:01] that are so since cards and tell you it
[1:36:07] you would probably in normal life not
[1:36:10] said nowhere near them in a restaurant
[1:36:12] must let Church but God so rich in mercy
[1:36:28] there's a table that's gotta be full and
[1:36:35] he said go to the hedges in the highways
[1:36:37] and bid them to come just in vitam just
[1:36:44] in vitamin and your invitation spade
[1:36:47] something to their hearts and they go I
[1:36:49] believe a will I can speak volumes right
[1:36:58] there verse 37 a and all these things
[1:37:11] were more than conquerors through him
[1:37:12] that loved us for I am persuaded this is
[1:37:18] Paul's writings for I am persuaded that
[1:37:24] neither death nor life nor Angels nor
[1:37:32] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:37:38] present nor things to come nor things to
[1:37:45] come nor things to come go ahead and say
[1:37:50] my thanks to Tom
[1:37:52] Satan keeps telling you he's gonna make
[1:37:55] a blow at you nor things to come and I'm
[1:38:00] saying it Plus Lee nothing's to come nor
[1:38:05] height nor depth nor any other creature
[1:38:07] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:38:11] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:38:14] Lord
[1:38:19] last year I read a scripture and I'm not
[1:38:22] going to go back and reread your
[1:38:24] scriptures but it was in 1st Samuel
[1:38:26] chapter 30 and it was where the
[1:38:29] Amalekites David came back from from
[1:38:33] incredible victory and they were all all
[1:38:37] of his men were shouting and all of them
[1:38:39] were singing a lot of them were dancing
[1:38:42] and all of them were doing great things
[1:38:43] and they were all happy and they were on
[1:38:46] their way home and they were on their
[1:38:53] way home and they were they had had an
[1:38:54] incredible victory
[1:38:56] all of us enjoy incredible victories all
[1:39:00] of us enjoy victories we all enjoy
[1:39:03] having testimony services and song
[1:39:05] services after we've just had a victory
[1:39:09] but you find a full listing and the
[1:39:12] Felicity to stand out front and he'll
[1:39:14] boast and he'll bragged and he'll tell
[1:39:16] you how big he is and he'll tell you
[1:39:19] what he's gonna do to you but remember
[1:39:22] you've got a sling remember you've got
[1:39:24] five stones
[1:39:27] you've met his kind before
[1:39:30] but David on his way home as a tight for
[1:39:34] us David on his way home the Endicott's
[1:39:38] had came and destroyed his homes his
[1:39:42] wives had taken all of their possessions
[1:39:45] not just the king but taken every man
[1:39:49] that had
[1:39:50] in a way and all of the company of
[1:39:53] Israel and taken all their goods you
[1:39:59] know that's what the enemy wants to do
[1:40:01] he don't want to just make you sick he
[1:40:04] wants to cure you he don't want to just
[1:40:08] turn you and get you out of church he
[1:40:10] wants to lead you into sin and get you
[1:40:13] into real trouble and to destroy your
[1:40:16] [Applause]
[1:40:24] he wants to make a slave out it he wants
[1:40:28] to do a lot of things together if he can
[1:40:31] just get your focus up just a little bit
[1:40:34] and if you remember last year as we were
[1:40:37] standing in Edmonton and I was preaching
[1:40:41] to you that David stood there and now
[1:40:43] his men as they were standing on the
[1:40:45] ashes of their homes these homes had had
[1:40:49] a had had where the Spirit of God had
[1:40:52] been there with him and they had danced
[1:40:54] and shouted read the scriptures together
[1:40:56] and enjoyed the presence of God but now
[1:40:59] their wives were gone
[1:41:00] their children were gone their treasures
[1:41:02] was gone their families was gone their
[1:41:05] environment was gone
[1:41:06] and they're standing on the ashes and
[1:41:08] now the men want to turn against the
[1:41:12] leader because the enemy has done this
[1:41:16] to them it proves to us that you cannot
[1:41:21] lose your focus and you must keep it on
[1:41:25] God
[1:41:28] Edmonton especially at your place I read
[1:41:32] to you and I tried to recount it this
[1:41:34] last couple of days of how many
[1:41:36] scriptures that are read but I read
[1:41:38] hundreds of scriptures to you about and
[1:41:42] David encouraged himself now that was
[1:41:51] then before a trial no doubt that that
[1:41:57] sermon blessed many people and I got
[1:42:01] many letters and many calls and many
[1:42:04] texts over that sermon of how that it
[1:42:07] touched people's lives now if it would
[1:42:09] do it then I want to come back and touch
[1:42:11] it now I want to come back and touch it
[1:42:16] now remember when I stood there and I
[1:42:21] begin to say to us it's our
[1:42:23] responsibility to take it back
[1:42:26] [Applause]
[1:42:27] the words of God was takes it back this
[1:42:36] is where David has to encourage himself
[1:42:39] as I look back God was speaking
[1:42:42] prophetically not just to me but to many
[1:42:47] others speaking to the bride of Jesus
[1:42:50] Christ sending it around the world we
[1:42:55] are people of the open book we are the
[1:42:59] bride we're not just a church we are the
[1:43:02] bride we have not been gathered to the
[1:43:05] personality of a man we're not man
[1:43:09] followers were not a court where the
[1:43:11] bride of Jesus Christ Jesus has lifted
[1:43:14] our mists and none of us because where
[1:43:19] Jesus is I will draw all men unto me God
[1:43:23] will not tolerate worship to no mana or
[1:43:27] to no image it must be to him and him
[1:43:32] alone just as the first commandment
[1:43:37] would be as I've looked back standing on
[1:43:45] that platform there and now I said here
[1:43:51] today and I thought over the last couple
[1:43:54] of weeks is it's time for this sermon to
[1:43:57] be preached and God just kept bringing
[1:43:59] it back up not knowing that Edmonton
[1:44:02] would be a part of this as well as other
[1:44:04] congregations that God has inspired me
[1:44:08] to speak this to the last time that I
[1:44:14] would speak such a sermon like this was
[1:44:15] at brother miss Colson
[1:44:17] but the Tom race and God would do much
[1:44:20] work there in that service
[1:44:29] naturally think of service is just a
[1:44:30] service and I just want to I just now I
[1:44:35] want to focus something so that these
[1:44:37] next few minutes will become real
[1:44:41] when is a service more than just a
[1:44:45] service at brother Joe greens I would
[1:44:57] speak to service and they would feel
[1:45:00] some resistance in the service and they
[1:45:07] would just stop feeling it and I would
[1:45:11] feel some things in and very cautious
[1:45:13] about how things are God's not a showman
[1:45:18] for nobody and as they begin to make
[1:45:24] some statements that if the audience
[1:45:27] don't want it God will operate behind
[1:45:29] the curtain if an audience is not
[1:45:34] receptive to it God will go to move
[1:45:36] behind the curtain and the service takes
[1:45:40] place and and and a few come to the
[1:45:43] author and they pray for them and one of
[1:45:45] them was sister Charlotte as sister
[1:45:48] Charlotte had had had suffered sugar
[1:45:51] diabetes for many years in her life and
[1:45:54] God just come and touched her body right
[1:45:58] there in the service and then another
[1:46:00] sister right behind her
[1:46:01] got a supernatural touch and they just
[1:46:03] happened right the corner and then
[1:46:05] another young lady and I just turned
[1:46:07] around and and and I never I don't think
[1:46:10] I even gathered my Bible and I just
[1:46:12] stepped behind a curtain you were there
[1:46:15] Matthew was there how Dan you were there
[1:46:20] and as a step by the height but behind
[1:46:23] the curtain
[1:46:24] what you dissed and sister Anna your
[1:46:26] sister was involved and her sister was
[1:46:30] sitting there this could be in grow
[1:46:35] and she was she was standing and she was
[1:46:42] standing in that service behind that
[1:46:46] curtain nobody could see her back there
[1:46:48] but she was doing work behind the
[1:46:51] curtains in the technical booth and as I
[1:46:55] passed by and I walked by all the sudden
[1:46:58] something turned me like that and God
[1:47:01] spoke to me to go to her and he began to
[1:47:08] speak just a couple of things to her
[1:47:10] then only she would know and then her
[1:47:12] husband would know and I prayed for them
[1:47:16] that they'd have that child was it just
[1:47:21] the service listened in just a few days
[1:47:26] avoiding charlie is getting ready to be
[1:47:29] born
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:35] [Applause]
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:44] then another young man would step up and
[1:47:47] his wife would step up and she stepped
[1:47:49] before and and and then the Lord told
[1:47:52] her exactly what was going on and then
[1:47:54] and then and then her hospital would
[1:47:56] stand there and and and and God would
[1:47:59] speak to him he had ran from the Lord
[1:48:02] for 17 years and God would speak to him
[1:48:05] he's now preaching the gospel of Jesus
[1:48:09] Christ
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:16] was it just a service I'd say it was
[1:48:20] more than a service brother gido my
[1:48:23] friend and many of your friends even in
[1:48:25] Edmonton would step they have to step
[1:48:27] out and he was standing there and gido
[1:48:30] had been in a meeting the South Carolina
[1:48:32] and while it was in South Carolina he
[1:48:36] was standing there amongst about 40 40
[1:48:40] preachers 60 preachers God would call
[1:48:48] guiteau's name and tell him you got a
[1:48:50] letter in your a girl in your case in
[1:48:57] your hotel and it's a critics letter
[1:49:01] pay no attention to it and he carried
[1:49:07] that letter for me to read pay no
[1:49:10] attention to it
[1:49:11] veto would come the next week to North
[1:49:15] Carolina and said in the mission
[1:49:16] meetings there at North Carolina and
[1:49:19] then and then standing there it would be
[1:49:23] the last time we'd see each other and
[1:49:25] standing there as he's watching all of
[1:49:28] these events happened and the Lord spoke
[1:49:31] to him as couple specific things and
[1:49:33] then God spoke to him said Geeta there's
[1:49:40] a train coming it's okay for you to get
[1:49:44] on it
[1:49:50] was it me or was it God was it me or was
[1:49:59] it God

[1:50:25] not just happening here it's happening
[1:50:27] around the world had a special friends
[1:50:34] name's Terry Terry was standing there
[1:50:39] and as he's standing there brother Joe
[1:50:42] we'd been friends for many years as a
[1:50:45] matter of fact we were the kind of
[1:50:47] friends that he had let me hunting his
[1:50:50] treestand and his boys all of the years
[1:50:54] of their growing up never got to hunting
[1:50:57] treestand brother Joe Green never got to
[1:51:01] hunt in the treestand no other
[1:51:04] evangelist pastor nobody got to hunting
[1:51:07] to trace that but he let me hunt in
[1:51:10] history staff Terry had said in church
[1:51:15] for years decades since they've been
[1:51:18] married and he was an incredible guy he
[1:51:21] had an incredible personality and he'd
[1:51:26] never give his heart to the Lord
[1:51:28] he'd never surrendered he knew what was
[1:51:31] right and he would do some what you
[1:51:34] might say preaching but he had never
[1:51:36] surrendered his life to the Lord and he
[1:51:38] was standing there and he watched all of
[1:51:41] those events happen there that night
[1:51:45] this service was more than a service
[1:51:51] I hope you're catching some things now
[1:51:54] not just here in Edmonton here and in
[1:51:59] Edmonton and Terry and Terry said I can
[1:52:13] serve a god like that hello was a Andrew
[1:52:25] I'd say sixty couple
[1:52:30] and one day I want you to ask yourself
[1:52:32] in Edmonton and now what have you done
[1:52:35] with your time how important is the
[1:52:39] moment right now how important is the
[1:52:43] moment right now and Terry's had a lot
[1:52:47] of complexes but in that moment he said
[1:52:53] I can serve a god like that young people
[1:52:59] may be moms and dads is held back for
[1:53:03] decades they don't take they don't take
[1:53:13] 10 minutes I wonder all the pettiness of
[1:53:21] life and and the blame games of life and
[1:53:26] what about you you serve a god like that
[1:53:39] I grabbed you brother and it was a very
[1:53:45] emotional moment for me because I
[1:53:48] realized this was not just a time moment
[1:53:51] this is eternal and the seat which God
[1:53:58] had deposited before the foundation of
[1:54:01] the world was now having a moment
[1:54:11] two weeks later Terry would would find
[1:54:15] out he had cancer didn't know it before
[1:54:17] and in a couple of months I would stand
[1:54:22] at his funeral and they held that
[1:54:27] funeral to like agree that and I stood
[1:54:30] with every confidence brother Vernon
[1:54:34] that a man could stand with and say this
[1:54:39] man met her real good and stood in a
[1:54:44] real moment and his life was changed in
[1:54:49] that moment never to go back let's just
[1:54:54] say glory be to God
[1:55:15] how important is a moment it's life and
[1:55:20] death maybe the enemy seems to have
[1:55:34] destroyed a lot of things in your life
[1:55:48] God didn't make me sick because God
[1:55:55] don't make people sick God didn't make
[1:56:01] me sick
[1:56:02] that was in my DNA and it started out
[1:56:08] somewhere they don't know where it
[1:56:09] started out but it started out in there
[1:56:14] maybe it was a place on my face maybe it
[1:56:17] was a place on my leg
[1:56:19] and it's in there and it's been in there
[1:56:24] for we don't know but we know it was at
[1:56:27] least been in there eight years it's
[1:56:31] what they're saying in that eight years
[1:56:35] supernatural offense have happened while
[1:56:41] I was there now hang with me just a
[1:56:44] moment so during that process of time
[1:56:49] this body was taken on death and at the
[1:56:59] paradox of the same time some of the
[1:57:03] most phenomenal miracles that mortal
[1:57:05] beings can visibly watch
[1:57:10] God was doing through the same body are
[1:57:18] you with me dad been raised teachers
[1:57:21] been healed people coming out of
[1:57:24] wheelchairs death Theory finish and
[1:57:28] coming back are you with me
[1:57:30] type low pressure sugar diabetes and the
[1:57:34] greatest miracle of all is drunks and
[1:57:37] prostitutes drug addicts and even
[1:57:43] religious people
[1:57:47] hallelujah switch is the greatest
[1:57:49] miracle of them all can get a new birth
[1:57:52] and a transformation because we're not
[1:57:55] rehab sinners this is not a place where
[1:57:59] you come and live with your sins will
[1:58:02] not rehab centers formation centers is a
[1:58:18] paradox where life and death works right
[1:58:22] side by side so did we just when death
[1:58:31] begins to operate and destroys our homes
[1:58:34] and destroys months of our lives do we
[1:58:41] just stand and say well this is the way
[1:58:44] that it's going to be get our bucket
[1:58:48] list together fill it out and then start
[1:58:55] to try to fulfill it or do we ask
[1:58:58] believe us say I don't need you to pity
[1:59:03] me I need you to rejoice with me
[1:59:08] [Applause]
[1:59:15] do we lie and say we don't have a bad
[1:59:17] day no do we look at our problems and
[1:59:23] our situations and just say well I got
[1:59:27] it coming to me
[1:59:31] we just mark those days down as bad days
[1:59:35] and say Satan you tormented me on this
[1:59:40] day so now you're guilty because God is
[1:59:45] a just God and being a just God he won't
[1:59:50] even whip the devil unless he's got a
[1:59:55] just cause and then God says there's no
[2:00:00] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[2:00:03] prosper now I might be fighting cancer
[2:00:11] but I'm not quit
[2:00:17] [Music]
[2:00:19] I'm not volts in a way and I'm not
[2:00:23] scared of it and I'm not a coward
[2:00:26] so when you look down the line and there
[2:00:29] stands Ron Spencer he ain't runnin he
[2:00:35] ain't a coward and he ain't turning back
[2:00:40] [Applause]
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:50] now I want to ask you if I can stand
[2:00:53] here under these conditions now I'm
[2:00:57] going to preach to you what about you
[2:00:59] [Applause]
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:06] [Applause]
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:09] [Applause]
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:18] Oh
[2:01:19] [Applause]
[2:01:37] Oh
[2:01:39] [Applause]
[2:01:48] [Music]
[2:01:51] come on okay I'll see you in the morning
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:37] [Music]
[2:02:45] now this might be a simple simple
[2:02:48] thought as I close I'm not going to be
[2:02:51] long because I wanted to I want it to
[2:02:54] last it's up to you it's up to you it's
[2:03:09] up to you it's up to you we're not
[2:03:14] waiting on God to fulfill his part right
[2:03:19] take these off we're not waiting on God
[2:03:23] to fulfill his part
[2:03:25] Edmonton we're not waiting on God to
[2:03:27] fulfill his part he's done everything
[2:03:30] that he can do it's our turn the grand
[2:03:47] said we were the final voice to the
[2:03:49] final age he said God's looking for
[2:03:51] thousands of live voices are you with me
[2:03:54] well then said I'm so glad a man can so
[2:03:56] completely serve God until the desert
[2:03:58] serve God tell the devil don't know what
[2:04:00] to do with him are you with me yes all
[2:04:06] of those are powerful quotes the
[2:04:08] scripture said greater is He that is in
[2:04:10] you than he that it's in the world it is
[2:04:14] true jesus said if he abide in me and my
[2:04:17] words abide in you ask what you will
[2:04:23] when when the boys went down in Acts
[2:04:26] chapter 3 and said silver and gold have
[2:04:28] I none but such as I have give up thee
[2:04:32] in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and
[2:04:35] walk this is an action Scripture
[2:04:39] we are not waiting on somebody else to
[2:04:42] do the job or somebody else coming we're
[2:04:44] here we're here you don't have to wait
[2:04:51] on a blog to come out or some favorite
[2:04:54] thing to come out it's you and God it's
[2:04:57] you in this message it's you in the Word
[2:04:59] of God this message is more than a
[2:05:03] script it's more than just words that
[2:05:06] are poetically put together but this
[2:05:09] message is Christ given to the bride of
[2:05:12] Jesus Christ not to be imitated but to
[2:05:16] be lived Satan don't have enough you
[2:05:41] don't have enough he would have already
[2:05:45] defeated you if he had enough hema
[2:05:54] needed this week the devil's talk to you
[2:05:59] don't listen to him he's a liar and he
[2:06:04] tells you all different kind of things
[2:06:05] he would have already cooked you if he
[2:06:10] had enough I think the devil would've
[2:06:22] killed is going to kill me well here's
[2:06:26] where I want to come down to this
[2:06:27] morning brother a we're buddies
[2:06:35] but when Satan got the opportunity
[2:06:38] somewhere and now I'm closing because
[2:06:43] I'm gonna go back to 2007 witness
[2:06:46] convention
[2:06:49] and I preached there that the devil Kate
[2:06:51] touch a hair of your head until he gots
[2:06:53] permission from God he cannot touch one
[2:07:00] red or gray hair of my head until he got
[2:07:04] permission from God so somewhere God and
[2:07:09] him had a conversation and before then I
[2:07:15] would go through this round God said I
[2:07:18] got confidence and it wasn't confidence
[2:07:24] in the flesh of Ron Spencer or the
[2:07:26] confidence of it in you in your flesh
[2:07:29] when he had confidence in the seed
[2:07:32] brother William and that seed has
[2:07:37] eternal life in it with me and God has
[2:07:40] watched over that seed that he deposited
[2:07:43] before the foundation well he's watched
[2:07:45] over that seed that seed is eternal you
[2:07:50] remember a little bit ago we said and I
[2:07:53] saw a new heaven and a new earth and
[2:07:55] then God will be with him and got a
[2:07:56] watch over them and he will be their God
[2:07:58] and he'll wipe away the tears are their
[2:08:00] eyes so he watched over you before the
[2:08:03] foundation world and he watched over you
[2:08:06] doing your mom and dad and he watched
[2:08:08] over your grandfather and all the way
[2:08:09] down the line he's watched over you now
[2:08:13] and he's going to get you there and
[2:08:16] you'll go through trials and God said
[2:08:19] I'll never leave you and I'll never
[2:08:20] forsake you but I'll be with you to the
[2:08:23] end of the world
[2:08:29] [Music]
[2:08:35] and though this body was kind of
[2:08:38] discouraged when it heard about that it
[2:08:41] had three tumors in it and they were all
[2:08:43] full of cancer and the lungs were full
[2:08:45] of cancer and the cancer was trying to
[2:08:48] spread sure it brings all kind of worry
[2:08:51] and agony and situation but God didn't
[2:08:53] fail me there
[2:08:54] he ain't failing me now
[2:08:57] [Applause]
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:14] if he couldn't touch a hair of my hand
[2:09:17] without this permission it was that God
[2:09:20] that gave him permission then that God
[2:09:24] is with me and that God told David
[2:09:29] pursue it overtake it recovered all
[2:09:44] lovely scriptures and musicians come
[2:09:49] without fail recover all did you hear
[2:10:05] that words without fail without fail I
[2:10:14] want you to repeat this works with me
[2:10:16] was not failure without fail
[2:10:22] now Edmonton you may not understand but
[2:10:26] I'm having to preach short sermons it's
[2:10:29] made I've been too short I don't know
[2:10:30] how long I've reached because I'm
[2:10:34] because I'm weary in my flesh but
[2:10:40] sometimes short sermons are powerful but
[2:10:50] I don't know what you're fighting in
[2:10:53] Edmonton or in Louisiana or in North
[2:10:58] Carolina or wherever you hear this
[2:11:00] sermon this sermons more than about Ron

[2:11:13] have been through but my family has been
[2:11:19] dreary has been very good to me and when
[2:11:24] I've been laying in the floor and having
[2:11:27] to be helped at the bathroom and that
[2:11:30] can be on days like today in a moment's
[2:11:33] notice but the Donny you know that I
[2:11:35] mean chemo can make you sick and you can
[2:11:39] have this stronger day and then take
[2:11:41] chemo and in a matter of about 20
[2:11:44] minutes you're you're tough shape but
[2:11:49] our neighbors don't know anything about
[2:11:51] it my friends don't know anything about
[2:11:53] it but this church many of them know how
[2:11:57] weak that I've been but you have watched
[2:12:01] a miracle happen to hear in this
[2:12:04] audience you've watched a miracle happen

[2:13:01] world has watch God perform a miracle in
[2:13:05] front of your eyes now I'm going to say
