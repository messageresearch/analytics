privilege to have the crest family with us i know that they've had a battle to get here and they have had a desire to be here and i'm certainly thankful to have them here they are they're going to be so journaling with us for until the lord comes and and so we just want to welcome you here and just say god bless you also sister erica we thank you for being in the house of the lord amen first john chapter five and verse one amen before we read from there i'd like to read this this quote from the ephesian church age brother barum said the true church of jesus christ the bride is locked into pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him and what he is she is to reflect and what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god how can one fathom it and how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for our god hath spoken it first john 5 and 1 that whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and everyone that loveth him that begot loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous they're not oppressive they're not heavy they're not burdensome but whatsoever for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to speak to you for a few moments this evening on the identity the identity of of the believer and if you turn over just for for reading's sake just for over to luke chapter 24 and you can catch it on the board if you don't feel like turning there i know maybe your hands might be tired but it's okay to exercise your faith and roll that thing over every once in a while but luke chapter 24 and verse 15 and we find that that jesus is jesus as he breaks in here it's it's right after his resurrection that he that he comes to the two disciples that are on the road to to emmaus and and jesus begins to have a conversation with them and we'll just break in right here on verse 15 and it said that it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned that jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have that you have with one another as you walk and are set so you find that the disciples are speaking uh if you go back and read they're speaking of the happenings of the events that's just taken place but notice what what draws jesus attention or what happens is that jesus draws near to them while they were talking with them and brother branham would tell us that then when you go to talking about god that god will draw near to you when you begin to magnify his name and glorify his name that when you begin to testify of all that he has done in your life that jesus will draw nigh and here they were they were speaking about the happenings of easter of what has just went on what they've just witnessed or or they thought that this would be the very messiah but jesus is getting ready to unfold or unveil the happenings of what really happened there what what he really was and and be and the bible said that it beginning at moses verse 27 and the prophets that he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh into the village and and whether they went he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him notice their eyes are still closed they don't recognize who he is but there was something on the inside of them that they constrained him saying abide with us for it is for towards evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them notice notice their eyes are still closed but something on the inside of them was drawing them to pull on him to lean on him because they they recognize that there's something about this one that they've been talking to they don't realize that it's the one that they'd hoped for they don't realize this is the one that they'd walk walk with for the past three and a half years they've not recognized but they've recognized something about the way that he is speaking unto them that this is that's just something more than just an a normal man that's going along the way this is something special about this man they they he's got an atmosphere about him that they just want to draw on just a little bit longer they they've walked all of these six and a half miles they walked with jesus and they and he took them through the scriptures all that the prophets had foretold of him but there was something showing on the inside of them it was an identity that was being attached to the one that had identified himself as the one that was the messiah and when they got him on the inside they began to pull on him they pulled him on the inside of there they said jesus i'm not going to let you pass me by there's something about you they've not known that this is him they've not understood it but they begin to pull on him and maybe you've walked into a service much like tonight maybe you don't understand everything but if you can just pull on him just for a little bit but you recognize there's an atmosphere in this building there's an atmosphere about the way that he handles himself and he began to pull on him and say god and when he got on the inside and when he gets on the inside of you young people when he gets there you'll recognize that the one that you have walked with that has guided you all throughout your life he made sure that you found him when you were fishing he made sure that you found him when you were going through the journey he made sure that he got to you when you were in trouble he is going to be the one that'll break the bread and you'll recognize that this was the same one immediately they identified they identified that this was the one are you with me the one that they hoped for the one that they longed for when they watched him do what he had done before they watched what he had done before and they recognized the way that he handled himself they watched his works and it identified what he was that amazing that his works identify who he is and so you can see it in the same way today you watch when somebody when you see the same power or the same manifestation of the holy ghost you are recognizing and identifying that that's jesus [Applause] now notice i know now just for just for myself just follow me in this just for a moment that that identification the word it means the act of making or proving to be the same it's the act or proving to be the same so when you have an identification you you are identifying that the one that is of this identification is the same identity it is the distinguishing character or a personality of an individual and brother branham would come and he would preach thousands of times and and not just titles but but he would preach entitles god identified by his characteristics identified with christ identified with the christ of all the ages but you listen throughout the message and brother branham is lacing in there of the identity of the believer of the of identified you can hear it and you can hear it in spiritual amnesia you can hear it through identified christ but he is attaching and he's lacing in there that there's somebody that you've got to be identified with and what was the prophet doing he was lacing the word together he was tying up those loose hands and he's putting there and showing to you that this is the one that was promised for this day so just just for this sort of on identification but each and every one of us sitting here this evening have an identification card it's an important thing when you have an identification card it's something that you have to carry if not this guy right here if you stop him he might if he stops you you might get in trouble but you've got to carry that card or maybe you maybe you've got an identification badge to get you into certain spots of your work or a badge of authority that's allowed you to get into a different place or access into a federal building or different things or or maybe it may be a maybe a passport so that you have the ability of crossing borders and you see they they snap that picture of you and they snap that picture of you and i'm trying not to be myself here just for a moment we're getting loose here just just yet you take that picture some of our here's where i'm going here's where my thoughts are some of our pictures that they took on our identification car was took a long time ago and it's hard to recognize it's hard to recognize maybe you was having a bad hair day or maybe maybe the person behind maybe behind the camera pushed your buttons just before they took that picture and you don't want that cop thinking just because you made that ugly face when you were taking that picture that you're that kind of a guy all the time really you're a smiling person but but how that picture how that picture is it identifies it that identification you can look on your you can look on your license and it tells you what your it tells what your color of your eyes are it tells you how it tells you how tall you are it tells you different characteristics whether you wear glasses or whether you got restrictions or different things but it's the identification that identifies the human being so if brother william would take my identification or not he'd take my driver's license and he bit get pulled over down here by the lovely elkton police he get pulled over and he'd show them they asked for his driver's license and his registration and he hands them my identification card they're gonna say son where did you get that plastic surgery at i mean you got six foot tall you hit me you're six foot two i mean mean come on somebody you're looking looking a whole lot better than what you do on that picture something is wrong man i wish it was that easy but something is out out of cater with if if he can't identify with what i am because he's not he he might carry my card there might be people that might carry a message book under their arm but they can't they can't handle themselves the way that you handle themselves they can't identify like you identify because there's something on the inside of you that makes this work you make this work i'm trying not to preach before i preach here but you are the people of the open book and you have the ability to make this little message that's so thwarted or or so the enemy has tried to thwart and try to push into a corner you're the only people with a badge of authority there's a lot of churches that try to put on plastic surgery and try to dress themselves up to make themselves look like the park but it's a life that makes the difference it's the life that makes it live out it's the life that pushes out because you are watching the same one that walks with the road to emmaus with those two disciples he's the same one that is identifying himself in the body of the church of the living god notice in spiritual amnesia he said your spiritual your spiritual attitude towards god's words identifies exactly where you're standing at and today we are living in an hour when we're when there's so many things of of technology where we're dealing with lost identities and stolen identities and even in this even in this in the south more so than up in the north but we're dealing with a people and a generation that is wanting to strip our heritage try to step our strip our statutes out of our life strip our rights away from us tear down our civil war monuments and all of those things but you can try all that you want to now you can try everything that you want to to wipe out our history and you can do the very best that you do but america's past is written and sealed in blood good and bad it's sealed in blood they don't want anything that happened back there that was that was what they would call offensive in today they don't want it showing up in this day but yet yet they they want to remove our history they want to remove our heritage but our past makes us better you look at science and what they did with cancer 50 years ago but you look at what it did today it makes us better and they try to move history of of slavery or out of our midst and say it was such a bad thing yes it was a bad thing but man didn't do it man did that it wasn't god that did that man make slaves but look if we're not learning or listening to our history then we are nothing but be mere beasts and we're not learning but we're simply acting like animals again and you look at this nation and you look at the politics of today you've got nothing but but people that's minds are blown out by the chaos of this world and they're inviting in a demon they're inviting in the abaddon to come in and take the throne and they're trying to fort out or fresh out our heritage but our heritage tells us where we came from it tells us of what we did wrong it makes us better when you start remembering about what jesus did for you and you start remembering where you fell and saying it does something for you you remember that old trick that the devil talked you into doing you remember it but it doesn't make you a bad person because the devil talks you into it it's temptation if you listen to him it's temptation if he's always talking to you but sin is when you give in to it remembrance is a powerful thing brother nathanael when you can remember you remember when when peter got up there when jesus told him that before the night's over you're gonna deny me three times but when the crowed he said oh no i said i won't do this there's no way that i'll i'll neglect you or i'll i'll deny you when the old man will walk away from you i will never walk away from you but when peter remembered what the lord said when the cockroach what did it do it humbled him to get to pentecost your past can take you to your future if you allow it to when you look at the fall you look at the fall when you see science today saying saying trying to look back there and trying to find the mess in lincoln trying to find our origin where man came from the big bang theory i say it was god spoke it boom it happened but they're trying to trace it back they trying to find that serpent tried to find him and tried to find his source but his life is still here and you look at at science they're trying to source it back of this is where man came from we've got the feet of a bear we've got the we've got the hands we've got the hands like an ape or a monkey and and and they say that that's where we originated from that's got nothing to do with mankind but when god made man he made man in his own image man was made as a spirit man in the beginning and then god formed man out of the dust of the earth we this ain't got nothing to do with our origin we came from god and we're going back to god [Applause] the more we go throughout this chaos of life i happen to believe that there are some people that are kind to monkeys they are kind of these apes they got monkey brains up in washington dc trying to push in all kinds of things trying to make our young girls do things that young boys they've lost their identity it ain't just in politics it's right here it's right here in denominations men have lost their identity of what god destined them to be in it lost his origin back there man lost his origin back there in the garden of eden he was made to walk and to control life to control nature but man lost his relationship he lost his communion with god because of sin and unbelief coming in and when god sowed his seed abel would have came here by the way of of spiritual multiplication but cain would have never been here but because satan came and he sowed his seed of discord of discrepancy cain was brought here he brought his discrepancy up to the word of god he brought it in and it's contrary to the word of god and it started the ball of sin rolling right there and the same things that you're seeing in the natural where men are being turned back to brute beast and the man without the holy ghost is nothing but a brute beast you watch what men are doing you watch what they're trying to influence our young children to do in schools today i'm gonna get a good i'm gonna get a little plane right here but you watch what they're trying to push in into our school systems and try to push into our young girls and pushing our young boys of making of acceptance [Applause] it's okay and they're trying to desensitize the morality of humanity to say that this is just the way that it's supposed to be i'll stand here on the word of god and said this is nothing but sodom again well you what you see in this in the natural you're also seeing a spiritual a man creating spiritual fornication going and getting baptized in the name of a father son and holy ghost that ain't got no power in it if you've been baptized in titles you have not been correctly baptized but man has lost his identity he's completely lost his mind i'm afraid that we've rolled back to the time of daniel again when the king of nebuchadnezzar went in there and he exalted himself up and he got under the spirit he got under his spirit because he exalted himself and god let a spirit come upon him and he'd come and he thought he was a an animal and he went out there and they found him he was out in the field eating grass like an ox he had long hair over him had feathers like an eagle and he had the heart of an animal because he forgot that he was a human being because man exalted himself i can handle this brother andrew can you really you can't handle laodicea and everything it throws at you but only the power of the living god has the ability to roll you back right where god destined you to be at [Applause] he forgot he forgot that he was a human being notice what brother branham said he said we sometimes forget sometimes that what the christian church is he said we act like the world that shows that we got spiritual amnesia but you don't act like the christian you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this you see what you see what they're trying to push is they're trying to push you into an animal nature when we've got when we've got it raising in our own schools where men have lost their identity of what they are of what gender they are where now they want to identify as a dog or a cat or they need a litter box in their school or they need a lease to lead them around they have lost their minds [Applause] fox news carried a carried a segment a while back it said young christians are leaving the church and here's why let me let me read to you these people that have less left the christian church why they are saying that they have left the church he said when they asked when they asked why they didn't believe many said their views about god had evolved where'd that come from and some reported having a crisis of faith learning about evolution once said when learning about evolution when i went away to college religion is the opiate of the people rational thought makes religion go out the window lack of any sort of scientific proof or specific evidence of a creator that's what they say christianity is it lacks that one said i just realized somewhere along the line that i didn't really believe it one said i'm not doing a lot more learning i said i'm doing a lot more learning and studying and kind of making my decisions for myself rather than listening to somebody else rather than embracing a blind or an unreasonable faith christians must develop an informed and forensic faith that can stand up in the marketplace of ideas that's the generation that the lukewarm church world is producing i don't want no forensic faith i don't want nothing that will stand up in the marketplace of the ideologies of the religions of the world nor in order nor on social media i don't want no forensic faith that can stand up into them or into the marketplace of of these homosexuals today and stand up in front of these of these political worlds where we can be we're all one we're not all one we are one under god one by his spirit baptized by the holy ghost there is a true oneness i don't want a forensic faith but i want a god-given faith that'll stand up toe-to-toe to the spirits of the demonic powers of satan's and thwart every demonic power weak pulpits produce weak churches and weak churches produce weak christians but for me and my house i serve god in his fullness man has lost his identity when he starts getting away from the word of god that's the kind what i've just read you is what the church world produces but let me show you our young people this is what that message produces this ain't william branham's life this is a life of jesus christ you take a look at what happened down in louisiana and i'll show you i put our young people up against joe biden donald trump and anybody in the halls of congress our young people are more powerful than any secret service we got the best of the best in the message and the message will produce jesus christ the world may have lost their identity but we have found ours in christ i have a mind of christ but notice notice when jesus came he didn't identify himself by traditions he didn't identify himself by the robes of humanity or the religions of the day or their creeds but he identified himself by the word and the word was his weapon and when jesus was here he didn't leave he didn't leave any question who he was he clearly identified by himself by the scriptures he said i am the resurrection and the life i am before abraham was i am moses spoke of me i am my father a one when pilate asked him said are you a king he said thou sayest judas had to testify that this was an innocent one pilate had to wash his head tried to wash his hands of him they testified that this was him there was no questions satan satan may have had his ideas but jesus clearly identified himself by the scriptures what did we do we took the badge of the prophets of the old testament we looked at what they said we took their id badge we looked at what they said the messiah would be and we looked at the person he was everything that they said that he would be jesus was so much god that sickness couldn't stand in his presence jesus was so much god that death was arrested jesus was so much god that lazarus couldn't stay in a grave jesus was so much god that hell couldn't stop him jesus was so much god that the grave couldn't contain him i'll say this that that same jesus is living in a people identified once again you are identified by the message for rapture i got my identification card that i carry and they try to do it they're trying to do a thing in the state of virginia i guess it's everywhere but what they call a real id and if you fly domestically or if you gotta get into certain federal buildings you have to have that to be able to get in or to fly domestically but i want you to know i found my real id when they give me that real id i thought man i got myself a subject to preach right now this is my real id i can lose that card i can lose that card it might get rolled up or crack and put into the trash but i can't lose this identity my seed is my identity my birth is my identity my holy ghost is my identity this is my real idea and jesus when he up went up there on the amount of temptation and satan put towards him those temptations he didn't use his power brother jeffrey he used the word he's not wanting you to use your power sister jada he's simply wanting you to use the word of god against every critic against every demon of hell hallelujah jesus did it in such a way that when the weakest of christian goes on their knees when you've got a problem that's bigger than you i am the lord thy god that heals all of your diseases you ain't got to feel no emotion about it you ain't got to get excited about it it will excite you and it will get you emotional but there's going to be some bad days in your future [Applause] well i'm not going to listen to you you're going to need this one day you can sit there and roll your eyes at me all you want to but you're going to need this one day you're not going to feel it's going to be sometimes young people when you don't feel like shouting and running all over the building that you're going to need the lord thy god that heals all your diseases you're gonna need to know that jesus he was up there fast he was up there fasting he was up there hungering it wouldn't have been temptation if he wouldn't have been hungry he had the power to do it he had the ability to do it but because of you but because of you notice you look what jesus what satan did when he assailed on jesus a prayer notice what jesus did he did not give him it it's by this or i'll show you my i'll flex my muscles at you no it was i it is written amen and the demons that you face young people are designed to attack you they're designed to press against you and they're designed to work against all of those that press towards god's word and you watch the religious spirits of the day it's easy believism of i've got it or i felt emotional but you watch that demon will work on your flesh he'll work on your spirit but he cannot get to that soul if you got what you really got if you really got an identification that i am birthed by the word of god satan can throw cancer on you but it won't stop you satan can throw all kinds of diseases on you but it won't stop you it's not by might it's not my power but by my spirit saith the lord we got religious spirits against us we've got every demonic gun of hell that's pointed against the church of the living god and you watch the roman empire that's revived its ideology again and working its way into the methodist you look what the method has got in their pulpit you look what they're inviting into their pulpit you look what the catholic church is doing to those young boys you look what they're doing to those nuns back there men have brainwashed the society of christianity and they've lost their identity and satan come up out of that bottomless pit he has no foundation and he is simply attacking the value of the word of god and he's trying to strip you of your heritage it's for days gone by it's for those young people it was just for the generation before you it's not for you but ain't god good he so designed these promises that they never run out they ain't got an expiration date on them it doesn't say just for andrew spencer just for william branham it says for the church of the living god whosoever believeth oh do we got any believers in the house of god today god is the designer of the body he built that body he built this earthly body with with with channels to be able to reach out and contact the earthly world senses that brother william talked about last weekend reaching out but he's also the designer of the church body and he placed in the church body gifts of speaking in tongues gifts of prophecy gifts of wisdom gifts of knowledge gifts of healing he designed man's body so certainly he can design the church church's body is that right and he lets the power work through the body and something works through the body and it tells something in their natural flesh and tell something's wrong anybody can attest to something maybe something down in your foot and man all of a sudden it sends a shock up to your head something's wrong and god has so designed the body that there's a pastor over top of a sheep that he knows when something is wrong he can stand there and take his god-given gift and speak the word of god and watch the power roll through the channels of the word and bring that situation bring peace to it but notice notice god lets out his power and lets it out his revelation to the people he said and not as an individual so much but as a unit we're all together one great body of believers how do we get into the body of this mystic body by one spirit we're all baptized but notice this he said satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin death brought operate sin and death makes everything that sin and death brought operate to satan he sends cancer and the man recognized it and received it satan sends hard acts heart attacks or heartaches he said we recognize it and we receive it he said but if satan can make his laws be sure and us recognize it how much more ought god to his children to make his laws recognized be recognized among his people of divine healing of revelation of power gifts and manifestation of the spirit he said the law of sin and death works in the people so if humanity works by the laws of sin and death and man sent cancer and we recognize it or satan sends cancer a man recognizes it man receives it that surely god ought to have his spiritual body in operation to be able to receive the law of the liberty of jesus christ is that right we ought to be able to get into a spot where we recognize and we receive every promise of god we ought to be able to get ourselves in condition so that we can recognize that this is not just for days gone by but this is for the church of the living god power work the works of the body but god this ain't just paul's day this is your day [Music] we're living in an hour and an age where it's it's a spirit of depression on the people it's a spirit of barrenness on the people it's a spirit of depression and you see every demonic power of hell rising out of the river euphrates but never speak his language my depression my fear my complexes my stigmas we're not to speak his language when they were up there on the day of pentecost they come out and their whole entire language was quickened everything was quickened and when you are birthed by the word of god everything changes i want you to change your language it ain't he said oh i just wish i'd speak in tongues just get your language changed it's not my fear it's not my depression it's not my cancer it's not my sugar it's not my problem my god my hope my strength my abilities change your language over to the identity of the church of the living god my identity is not in satan my identity is not in complex yes my identity is not in depression my identity is not in suicide my depression it's not my depression fearing my identity troubles ain't my identity hell ain't my identity heaven is my identity god is my identity [Applause] if you're american you're identified with patrick henry you're identified with george washington you're identified with with the ones that came across if you really are an american citizen you'll bleed for america you'll die for america but the problem with the american people today we don't have americans we've got people that have been implanted hey if i if i was them i'd want to move here too and i'm not against that this is america i'm not against those wanting to get here if i was over there i'd do everything within my power to get here we just got a government that's stupid enough to pay for everything that they ain't doing but if you're an american you're american to your accord you can't shake it out of you i'll stand for that flag as long as i got along i got air in my lungs but i'm afraid that america is past praying for but i have found myself in something that i will die for i it's not just good enough to have a death bed confession it's good enough to live by it's good enough to die by it's good enough to fight by we must fight if we must reign but lord increase my courage i'll be like winston churchill we'll fight on the battlefield we'll fight on the beaches we'll fight in the air i say i'll fight behind the pulpit i'll fight in the avenue i'm fighting abuse i'll fight whatever i gotta fight at satan can push his identity and try to move it into our young people but i'll stand here by the holy ghost power of god and said satan not today not this young group not this church we've got some young people that are worth fighting for we've got a message that's worth living hallelujah i said hallelujah [Applause] satan's got his agenda he's got his attack and he's thrown every rock of offense at us you got to allow the holy ghost to be your keeper parents you got to step up and you got to guard for your young girls i told you i'm going to get plain well i just want them to have my i just want them to have their own testimony i want them to be able to go out into the world and say they overcome this parents it's your job to be the holy ghost until they get the holy ghost but oh i just want to let them enjoy their life i'll take a caitlyn shifflet i'll take the charity spencer i'll take a carly fraser oh well let's just let him go out there enjoy the world and let him come back and have a real earth-shaking testimony i take taking caitlin shifflet that was willing to say i'm not going after her to that trash i'm not going out there her testimony is more powerful a young girl that refused to walk out to the world and say i'm not going to be a part of this layout of seeing flu she has identified herself with a message that will keep her when troubles come that'll keep her when trials come that'll keep her when she goes through the struggles her identity is attached to his identity and satan can do his worse but he won't shake you you've got something that hell don't know what it's working with what you've got sister caitlin hell tried always wanted to back in the beginning hell lucifer tried to get the power that you got are the powers that he was able to overthrow all the angelic power seth that he tried to overthrow sits on the throne room of your heart haley never tasted of the power that you've got when brother branham said you've got enough power on the inside of you to go out and create a new world satan you can't touch this you can't have this this ain't for you it's for me it's for my family i protect my family i'll keep my family i'll take that kind of testimony [Applause] satan hates this message he hates everything his message is for [Applause] because this message is truth because he knows it's got the life on the inside of it satan hates this message and he hates you he ate everything he hates everything that you believe in he tries to work against your flesh to keep you from getting here he tries to work against your spirit to get you in a bad mood he tries to work all he wants to to make you disbelief that this is right but at the end of the day when you are battling in your night season when you're crying and say god i have fought all day long i don't even feel like a kiss christian satan knows that it's right [Applause] just remember when you're battling just remember when you're going through it the power you have shaken knows that it's real satan knows that he ain't got enough
