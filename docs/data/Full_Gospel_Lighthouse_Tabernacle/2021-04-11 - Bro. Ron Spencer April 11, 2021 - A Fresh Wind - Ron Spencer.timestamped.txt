[0:44] he'll let us get right down to the last
[0:48] the last mile away
[0:53] you know he he likes to do that he did
[0:56] it with the hebrew children
[0:58] he knew who he could trust so he let
[1:01] that them boys walk right
[1:05] up to the fiery furnace so they could
[1:07] almost
[1:08] smell the fire and he never moved
[1:13] but when it comes time he'll move
[1:18] he'll move but he waits till his own
[1:20] time
[1:21] he wanted to see what kind of a reaction
[1:23] they had
[1:24] he knew they had made their stance
[1:28] and when he knows that you make your
[1:30] stand
[1:32] he'll let satan take you to the last
[1:35] mile
[1:36] away just remember he's still there

[1:47] sure believe it and the next day you
[1:49] still got your pain

[1:55] sure you got it just want to see how
[1:58] you're going to react or what you're
[1:59] saying
[2:01] you say oh praise god i believe in the
[2:04] baptism of the holy spirit
[2:06] the personal temptation comes along
[2:08] these flowers like above
[2:11] trying to see your reaction on your
[2:14] actions
[2:16] trying to test you every sun that cometh
[2:20] to god must
[2:21] first be chasing tested

[36:11] then i read
[36:28] [Music]
[36:37] that day
[36:40] [Music]
[36:45] fell like lightning in my veins
[36:51] my dead heart
[36:58] breath of god filled my lungs and the

[40:31] but the woman's guilt was gone
[40:41] jesus stood for sinners that no one
[40:45] else would stand for
[40:48] then he stood at calvary when we thought
[40:51] he
[40:52] could stand
[41:07] in the days after jesus had gone away

[41:15] not because of men who were full of
[41:20] hate he went on trial for
[41:23] his faith
[41:32] he fearlessly preached about the days
[41:36] of when the prophets their father slayed
[41:41] and how they all rejected the holy ghost

[53:05] gathering here for 30 to 40 days and
[53:09] then go to meet the lord in the air i
[53:11] think it's a very neat process that

[53:15] the reason for that 30 40 days he said
[53:18] so you get to get to see who's there and
[53:21] he said you won't be looking around

[56:59] and so we just thank you thank the lord
[57:01] that's the benefits of coming to church
[57:05] amen amen acts chapter 2
[57:10] and this is the eternal prescription
[57:13] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[57:15] come they were
[57:16] all in one accord in one place and
[57:19] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[57:22] as of
[57:23] a rushing mighty wind
[57:26] and it filled all the house where they
[57:28] were sitting
[57:29] and there appeared unto them clothing
[57:31] tongues like as a fire
[57:33] and it set up on each of them notice
[57:36] this next words and they were
[57:38] all filled with the holy ghost
[57:42] and began to speak with other tongues as
[57:44] the spirit gave them
[57:45] utterance and they were dwelling at
[57:48] jerusalem
[57:49] and there were dwelling at jerusalem
[57:52] jews devout men
[57:54] out of every nation under heaven and
[57:57] when they were
[57:58] this was noised abroad the multitude
[58:01] came together
[58:02] and were confounded because that every
[58:05] man
[58:06] heard them speak in his own language
[58:10] and they were all amazed and marveled
[58:13] saying one another be behold
[58:17] are not all of these which speak
[58:20] galileans
[58:23] and how heard we every man in
[58:27] in our own tongue wherein we
[58:30] were born you may be seated
[58:36] i'd like to preface this it's been quite
[58:39] a
[58:40] a quite a several weeks or months that
[58:45] these people have been a part of
[58:48] they have watched jesus come toward the
[58:50] ending of his ministry
[58:52] and very much explaining who he is and
[58:54] trying to get the people to see
[58:57] who he is and what his mission on earth
[58:59] is to do
[59:01] and then telling them that i'll not
[59:03] leave you comfortless
[59:05] but i'm going to send a comforter a
[59:08] guide
[59:09] to you that that that will be with you
[59:13] that will will watch over you because
[59:16] jesus knew in their own humanity
[59:19] our humanity fails as much
[59:23] energies that we have as much vision as
[59:27] we have
[59:28] as much ego as we would have if
[59:32] it's not the right word but as much ego
[59:35] or press
[59:36] or driven as we have your humanity will
[59:39] only take you so far
[59:44] david built a house for people he wanted
[59:48] to build a house where people
[59:50] could look toward or come and worship
[59:52] god
[59:54] because he had a house he had a castle
[59:58] he had a tremendous place that he lived
[1:00:00] in and he wanted to build
[1:00:02] god a house and in this house he wanted
[1:00:06] people to come and they could worship
[1:00:08] and feel the presence of god he had felt
[1:00:11] him as a child
[1:00:13] but david knew that he was nothing
[1:00:16] without god
[1:00:18] you and i are nothing without god
[1:00:21] all of your abilities all your gifts all
[1:00:24] of your givings and all of those things
[1:00:26] you're nothing without
[1:00:28] god and even jesus would say this
[1:00:32] i can do nothing except my father
[1:00:36] shows me first jesus had to go away to
[1:00:40] pray
[1:00:41] and draw strength from almighty god
[1:00:44] never come to the place to word that you
[1:00:46] can just think you can get
[1:00:48] by without praying reading your bible
[1:00:50] coming to church
[1:00:52] we've got to have his presence in our
[1:00:56] lives
[1:00:57] we need a deeper consecration a deeper
[1:01:00] committal
[1:01:01] like never before sometimes you just
[1:01:04] need a fresh wind
[1:01:10] now these men as they're there
[1:01:13] jesus is going to make some astounding
[1:01:15] things to them
[1:01:16] and he's going to say let not your heart
[1:01:18] be troubled
[1:01:19] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:01:23] he knew these men were going to go
[1:01:25] through some incredible
[1:01:27] difficult trials so they
[1:01:30] needed the life of god
[1:01:36] they needed the life of god to live on
[1:01:40] the
[1:01:40] inside of them people can go to school
[1:01:44] and pick up the characteristics of
[1:01:46] beethoven
[1:01:47] or or shakespeare or some great author
[1:01:51] or some great artist somewhere
[1:01:54] but listen let me just say this that's
[1:01:56] only carnal impersonations
[1:01:58] to become like somebody else and what we
[1:02:01] need
[1:02:02] more is than churchianity or religious
[1:02:05] or any kind of theology we need the life
[1:02:08] of god
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:12] we need the same life that jesus had
[1:02:16] and jesus was telling them i'm going to
[1:02:18] send this same
[1:02:20] life i'm going to come back i'm going to
[1:02:23] change my veil
[1:02:26] before you couldn't see god pillar of
[1:02:29] fire
[1:02:30] will by will in the middle of a will
[1:02:32] fire in the in the tabernacle
[1:02:34] a burning bush that was the effects of
[1:02:37] god
[1:02:39] that he was in the prophets and it was a
[1:02:41] portion of god and
[1:02:43] in humanity and you could see god once
[1:02:46] in a while
[1:02:46] and then you could see moses
[1:02:52] you could see god and david then you
[1:02:54] could see david
[1:02:56] but god wants to so live in our lives
[1:03:03] and it's for you for the promises unto
[1:03:06] you
[1:03:06] and to your children even it's as many
[1:03:08] as afar off
[1:03:10] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:03:11] call that dispensation never
[1:03:14] ended it's as much for you today
[1:03:17] as it's ever been
[1:03:21] and listen i don't care how long you've
[1:03:23] been a christian 30 40 years
[1:03:24] never let your fire burn out
[1:03:26] [Applause]
[1:03:28] are you with me oh brother ron but y'all
[1:03:30] have been here back in the days ago my
[1:03:32] that will give you a wiggle tail
[1:03:34] experience
[1:03:36] are you with me brother brown would
[1:03:38] preach sermons like restoration of a
[1:03:40] bride tree
[1:03:41] broken cisterns are you with me what is
[1:03:45] the attraction on the mountain
[1:03:47] you've got to keep your experience
[1:03:50] fresh
[1:03:51] [Applause]
[1:03:54] because remember god's not just a god of
[1:03:57] i was or i
[1:03:58] will be he wants to be an i am god for
[1:04:00] you
[1:04:01] what is he doing for you right now
[1:04:04] it's not the revival that was here 40
[1:04:06] years ago
[1:04:07] or 20 years ago or 10 years ago what
[1:04:10] about today
[1:04:13] where are you today on the map with god
[1:04:17] in your relationship with him is this
[1:04:20] all right
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:24] are you with me now
[1:04:28] no i i want to just because i have to
[1:04:31] there were a group of people of all of
[1:04:35] the millions
[1:04:36] that literally saw the resurrected
[1:04:39] christ
[1:04:46] millions were there a handful of people
[1:04:51] saw the resurrected christ
[1:04:54] was it an illusion
[1:04:57] was it a story by others
[1:05:00] no they actually saw jesus
[1:05:03] they actually handled him
[1:05:07] they actually watched him drink milk and
[1:05:09] and eat
[1:05:10] fish and he would walk in and out of
[1:05:13] walls
[1:05:16] sometimes you wonder where those fish
[1:05:18] went but
[1:05:22] an answer for you sister sue jesus
[1:05:26] ate in that body
[1:05:32] tom has handled him
[1:05:36] jesus talked to them about 40 days
[1:05:39] on the road to emmaus he spent about six
[1:05:42] hours
[1:05:43] when historian says about six hours and
[1:05:45] 20 minutes
[1:05:46] quite detailed isn't it about six hours
[1:05:49] and 20 minutes with the boys on the road
[1:05:51] to emmaus
[1:05:51] why wasn't they in jerusalem
[1:05:55] how quickly people can walk away
[1:05:59] jesus is dead buried and resurrected
[1:06:02] and these guys are walking away from the
[1:06:04] fulfillment of the word
[1:06:06] but because they were predestinated seed
[1:06:09] jesus went after them
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:12] and he talked to them for six hours
[1:06:14] about the fulfillment of
[1:06:16] of what jesus ministry was and finally
[1:06:19] they constrained him and he went in with
[1:06:21] them
[1:06:22] and they asked him to break bread and
[1:06:24] when he broke bread they recognized that
[1:06:25] was jesus
[1:06:27] [Applause]
[1:06:30] i pray when you come to a service like
[1:06:32] this that you can recognize
[1:06:34] that that same jesus is still breaking
[1:06:37] bread
[1:06:38] [Applause]
[1:06:43] now he comes to the end of the 40 days
[1:06:45] and i don't want to spend a lot of time
[1:06:46] with that 40 days
[1:06:48] but he comes to the end of it there's
[1:06:50] about 500 people gathering
[1:06:53] audience about twice his size gathered
[1:06:56] with jesus this is going to be one of
[1:06:59] the phenomenal days in history
[1:07:02] jesus is going to ascend into the skies
[1:07:08] and he's going to take those resurrected
[1:07:11] saints that he that's brought out of
[1:07:13] hell with him
[1:07:14] or the abraham's bosom with him
[1:07:18] and they're going to ascend as well
[1:07:22] and he gives this group of people
[1:07:25] instructions
[1:07:27] to go to the upper room because there's
[1:07:30] going to come a sound of a jubilee
[1:07:34] there's coming a fresh wind and you need
[1:07:37] to be a part of it are you with me
[1:07:40] i'm going to give you power and that
[1:07:42] power is going to have authority with it
[1:07:49] and you wait on it you
[1:07:52] stay there you stay in that upper room
[1:07:55] and tell you
[1:07:56] you receive this power
[1:08:02] now god doesn't describe how it's going
[1:08:04] to come
[1:08:06] he doesn't give them instructions on how
[1:08:07] they're going to act
[1:08:10] but the same life that was in jesus
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:14] that they needed he was going to breathe
[1:08:18] into them
[1:08:20] are you with me he was going to pour
[1:08:23] into them
[1:08:24] all that was in god he poured it into
[1:08:26] christ
[1:08:27] and all that was in christ he poured it
[1:08:29] into the church
[1:08:30] [Applause]
[1:08:32] they needed this it's essential
[1:08:35] it's still essential
[1:08:38] it's still the inoculation for laodicean
[1:08:42] flu where the church is rich and
[1:08:44] increase with goods and have
[1:08:46] need of nothing they can have
[1:08:49] church and don't really need god
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:09:06] now you can fold your hands if you want
[1:09:08] to and say i this is an elementary
[1:09:10] service
[1:09:12] but you that's got your hands folded
[1:09:14] needs this
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:28] i want that to land
[1:09:38] now think about this because this was
[1:09:41] the attitude
[1:09:44] of 380 people
[1:09:50] what you just watched happen here
[1:09:53] was the attitude of 380 people
[1:09:59] right i'm a jew i don't need that
[1:10:04] we've seen a phenomenal event hey did
[1:10:07] not we see
[1:10:08] jesus as sin well we should have
[1:10:10] everything we need
[1:10:14] we've got cows to take care of we've got
[1:10:17] farms to take care of
[1:10:18] we've got to go back to our sheep we've
[1:10:20] got businesses that we've got to take
[1:10:22] care of
[1:10:23] why i i i've got all kinds of excuses
[1:10:26] that i need to take care of
[1:10:28] why should we go to an upper room and
[1:10:32] the wind was getting ready to change
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:10:37] now let me just come back just for a
[1:10:38] moment in acts chapter 19
[1:10:41] paul is speaking to the people and he's
[1:10:44] telling them
[1:10:45] have you received the holy ghost
[1:10:49] since you believed
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:53] how was she baptized why was baptized
[1:10:55] under john's baptism
[1:10:57] the messiah had came
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:02] jesus said walk the earth for three
[1:11:04] years and all the miracles that have
[1:11:07] happened
[1:11:08] that will fill the whole world of
[1:11:10] miracles
[1:11:12] and then the the literal crucifixion the
[1:11:15] beating of the body
[1:11:16] and the the resurrection has happened
[1:11:19] mary magdalene
[1:11:21] and the other sisters came and witnessed
[1:11:23] it
[1:11:24] then peter came the day of pentecost
[1:11:28] comes
[1:11:29] and these people are still following
[1:11:31] john the baptist
[1:11:33] [Applause]
[1:11:36] i'm afraid too many today are still in
[1:11:38] some
[1:11:40] some pentecostal organization
[1:11:43] or or even worshiping the prophet that
[1:11:46] came
[1:11:47] we can plan them if all you saw was we
[1:11:50] can pray in them
[1:11:51] you missed the picture
[1:11:59] because god has moved incredible amounts
[1:12:03] since his leaving the angel didn't leave
[1:12:06] the pillar of fire didn't leave
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:10] and i'm telling you there's a fresh wind
[1:12:13] that is moving even now
[1:12:38] forgive me this wasn't the who's who in
[1:12:40] the 120.
[1:12:43] there's some recognizable names
[1:12:45] disciples
[1:12:47] but but even judas has
[1:12:52] he's been baptized
[1:12:56] and he's preached jesus was the messiah
[1:13:00] and he's had miracles but he turned
[1:13:03] jesus into the sanhedrin council
[1:13:06] and sold him out because he couldn't go
[1:13:10] to pentecost
[1:13:12] there's a lot of people that would do a
[1:13:14] lot of things because they can't go to
[1:13:16] pentecost
[1:13:19] and pentecost is your adoption
[1:13:23] pentecost is your your new birth
[1:13:26] pentecost sets you free no longer the
[1:13:30] old king
[1:13:31] lives on your heart but there's a new
[1:13:33] king
[1:13:36] there's a new king in there
[1:13:49] now they gather
[1:13:53] now remember peter just
[1:13:56] just days we would just say days and the
[1:14:00] breath of time is just days
[1:14:02] has denied the lord
[1:14:07] but the lord personally came to him to
[1:14:10] make sure
[1:14:11] because he's going to be the lead
[1:14:12] disciple because remember he has said
[1:14:15] flesh and blood
[1:14:16] hath not revealed this unto thee because
[1:14:19] peter had recognized that jesus
[1:14:22] was the christ
[1:14:27] now let me just say this to you well
[1:14:29] that's not such a big deal
[1:14:30] is that true
[1:14:35] people today can't still realize that
[1:14:38] jesus was god
[1:14:42] we're 2 000 years later and he's been
[1:14:45] walking through the church ages
[1:14:47] every age and it's been christ
[1:14:51] among them are you with me it's been
[1:14:54] christ among
[1:14:55] us even now
[1:14:58] and for us to turn and say well he's not
[1:15:01] god
[1:15:02] he's just a prophet or he's just a great
[1:15:05] man
[1:15:06] is to refute his divinity
[1:15:11] are you with me the greatest lie ever
[1:15:14] told was father son holy ghost baptism
[1:15:19] amen because what it does is
[1:15:22] take away from who jesus christ
[1:15:25] really is and and let me just say this
[1:15:29] to you
[1:15:30] the receiving the holy ghost is not a
[1:15:33] third person in the godhead
[1:15:36] it's jesus himself wanting to tabernacle
[1:15:41] himself
[1:15:42] on the inside of you
[1:15:53] now peter standing up with the eleven
[1:15:56] lifted up his voice
[1:15:57] unto them and said you men of judea
[1:16:00] on all the you that dwell in jerusalem
[1:16:04] be it known unto you and hearken to my
[1:16:06] words
[1:16:07] for these are not drunken as you suppose
[1:16:11] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[1:16:13] day but this is that
[1:16:16] so here is a group of people that is
[1:16:19] literally
[1:16:20] seeing the fulfillment of god
[1:16:23] pouring himself into human bodies
[1:16:27] and it's no longer up at the temple
[1:16:31] it's no longer blood of bulls and goats
[1:16:34] it's no lie
[1:16:38] under the blood of bulls and goats you
[1:16:40] could offer your perfect goat and your
[1:16:42] perfect lamb and your perfect turtle
[1:16:43] dove
[1:16:44] but the sin of that that was in your
[1:16:47] body
[1:16:48] you returned the same man only to have
[1:16:51] to repeat the process
[1:16:53] and literally oceans of blood was poured
[1:16:56] out
[1:16:58] but there was no repetitious sin but
[1:17:01] when jesus
[1:17:02] fills you with the holy ghost the blood
[1:17:05] of jesus christ
[1:17:06] washes you like you've never been washed
[1:17:09] before
[1:17:10] therefore there is no condemnation to
[1:17:13] them that are in
[1:17:14] jesus who walk not after the flesh
[1:17:21] but after the spirit of god
[1:17:31] these men were men and women wasn't
[1:17:33] babbling
[1:17:35] and just google goggling
[1:17:38] they were speaking it in another
[1:17:42] language
[1:17:44] and those people literally later would
[1:17:46] come and said
[1:17:48] this group was galilean yet
[1:17:51] we heard him multitudes heard them in
[1:17:55] different languages
[1:17:57] it wasn't humanity it wasn't the emotion
[1:18:01] of humanity
[1:18:02] it was god pouring out his spirit
[1:18:06] and life into this 120 vessels
[1:18:11] and as the prophet of god said if mary
[1:18:14] the mother of jesus had to go to the
[1:18:16] upper room
[1:18:17] so will you
[1:18:18] [Applause]
[1:18:24] now this fulfill the prophecy of joel
[1:18:27] prophecy is god's forecast laying for
[1:18:30] future events
[1:18:31] they're going to happen you can question
[1:18:34] it you can make fun of it you can
[1:18:36] throw rocks at it but it's going to
[1:18:38] happen
[1:18:40] and it happened
[1:18:44] and it happened
[1:18:49] and yet millions of people didn't get it
[1:18:55] it happened and yet millions of people
[1:19:00] didn't get it some of you are one in a
[1:19:03] million
[1:19:06] your family you they don't see it they
[1:19:08] don't like it
[1:19:10] you just keep going back to church your
[1:19:13] life has changed
[1:19:14] and they literally hate that they didn't
[1:19:18] they didn't say nothing to you as a
[1:19:19] drunk or a prostitute or
[1:19:22] they didn't say nothing to you is when
[1:19:23] you were doing wrong and ball games were
[1:19:25] your god or these other things were your
[1:19:27] god
[1:19:28] they didn't say nothing against that but
[1:19:29] you go to church couple times a week
[1:19:32] you listen to tapes you read your bible
[1:19:34] your children are growing up in an
[1:19:36] incredible atmosphere
[1:19:37] and yet yet your very close loved ones
[1:19:40] disdain what's going on it's because the
[1:19:44] life of jesus
[1:19:45] is so living in you it convicts them
[1:19:51] and it brings them under condemnation
[1:19:53] and your atmosphere
[1:19:55] changes the atmosphere of those that
[1:19:57] work around you
[1:19:58] and then they'll mock and say things
[1:20:00] against you don't worry they did it to
[1:20:03] jesus they'll do it to you
[1:20:05] just keep walking with god
[1:20:15] peer pressure will do a lot of things to
[1:20:17] you you may be the only one at your
[1:20:18] school
[1:20:20] you may be the only one at your job
[1:20:22] thank god for that
[1:20:32] now peter begin to preach the
[1:20:36] inoculation
[1:20:38] therefore let all the house of israel
[1:20:40] know assuredly that
[1:20:41] god hath made that same jesus
[1:20:45] whom you have crucified
[1:20:49] both lord and
[1:20:52] christ
[1:20:58] now when they heard this they were
[1:21:00] pricked in their heart
[1:21:04] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[1:21:05] apostles
[1:21:07] men and brethren what shall we do
[1:21:09] because they're causes in action
[1:21:11] and peter said unto them repent
[1:21:16] repentance is not that you got caught
[1:21:20] everybody's sorry after they get caught
[1:21:23] [Applause]
[1:21:25] politicians are sorry they're sorry they
[1:21:29] got caught
[1:21:29] and they walked in the pulpit with a
[1:21:31] hanky in their hand
[1:21:35] we've let you down no you were a sturdy
[1:21:38] stinking sinner to start off with
[1:21:43] and you're just sorry you got caught
[1:21:45] just give it a few weeks
[1:21:46] all of that sorrow get off of you be
[1:21:48] doing the very same thing all over again
[1:21:52] if you don't truly repent
[1:21:55] and turn aside from your old ways it
[1:21:58] will be a repetitive habit
[1:22:00] that will only come back in your life
[1:22:05] and you'll consciously struggle listen
[1:22:07] people sit for 30 and 40 years in
[1:22:10] seats in churches and they still have
[1:22:13] birth issues because they never did it
[1:22:16] right
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:20] they never did it right listen we're not
[1:22:24] a halfway house
[1:22:25] [Applause]
[1:22:28] we're not a place where you come and
[1:22:29] learn to live with your demons
[1:22:32] this is a transformation
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:37] sure house love the sinner but we hate
[1:22:40] the sin
[1:22:48] now look we all want to go to heaven
[1:22:50] could we have a unanimous vote on that
[1:22:52] we all
[1:22:53] want to go to heaven
[1:22:57] nobody wants to die
[1:23:01] but we all want to go to heaven
[1:23:04] but if you read in your scriptures
[1:23:08] there's an incredible list of people
[1:23:11] that won't make it
[1:23:18] in heaven there will not be a murderer
[1:23:22] a drunkard an idolater
[1:23:26] an adulterer
[1:23:30] there will not be none of that sin in
[1:23:33] heaven
[1:23:34] if you arrive and you you've wound up at
[1:23:37] a las vegas looking outfit
[1:23:40] you've wound up in hell that's
[1:23:43] not heaven
[1:23:53] are you with me
[1:23:59] somebody got offended that jesus could
[1:24:01] come the other day
[1:24:02] jesus jesus showed up at your house and
[1:24:05] opened the refrigerator and there was
[1:24:07] wine there
[1:24:13] somebody actually got offended it when i
[1:24:15] said that
[1:24:17] well you know let me just say this to
[1:24:18] you jesus don't even need to show up at
[1:24:20] your house
[1:24:21] he knows
[1:24:26] he knows and there's going to be a day
[1:24:29] let me just say this to you
[1:24:31] many will come to him and say lord did
[1:24:33] we not
[1:24:34] prophesy in your name didn't we have a
[1:24:37] holy ghost filled ministry
[1:24:39] in your name didn't we have miracles in
[1:24:43] your name
[1:24:44] and jesus says depart from me
[1:24:48] i never knew you
[1:24:54] so don't you get your eyes on humanity
[1:24:59] because preachers will fail you
[1:25:03] men will fail you women will fail you
[1:25:07] don't you get your eyes on failures you
[1:25:10] keep your eyes on jesus
[1:25:27] are we okay am i okay
[1:25:37] just a word of warning when i have
[1:25:40] trouble in the pulpit i'm not going to
[1:25:41] walk away no more
[1:25:42] i'm going to work my way through it so
[1:25:45] you help me work my way through it
[1:26:04] the other day i had an mri
[1:26:08] one doctor calls me and tells me that
[1:26:11] the temple tumor is growing
[1:26:15] and so in three months we'll be doing
[1:26:17] pet scans and
[1:26:18] those kind of scans we see growth we
[1:26:22] can't explain it but we see growth
[1:26:25] the next day i get a call from my
[1:26:28] uh cancer doctors and she said
[1:26:31] yeah we see this but but it's not cancer
[1:26:36] and matter of fact we want to take you
[1:26:39] off of chemo for a week just to give
[1:26:40] your body a break
[1:26:45] and so you have the same test
[1:26:49] you have the same test and different
[1:26:53] doctors
[1:26:54] look at the same test and give you
[1:26:57] different opinions
[1:27:01] now that's nothing new
[1:27:06] [Applause]
[1:27:14] so you have the same test
[1:27:18] and you have different doctors look at
[1:27:20] it
[1:27:30] and give you different results
[1:27:34] well so i'm going to go to a church that
[1:27:36] fits me really
[1:27:38] that's an interesting observation
[1:27:41] i want to fit the word
[1:27:44] now sometimes it becomes kind of a
[1:27:46] difficult deal because king james can be
[1:27:48] rough
[1:27:50] so that means that we're going to
[1:27:52] rewrite the bible
[1:27:55] now in rewriting the bible there's
[1:27:58] 40 different 40
[1:28:01] 000 different translations
[1:28:08] and everybody's got their own opinion
[1:28:12] because they didn't like what the word
[1:28:14] actually said
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:20] you know in china we had a deal where we
[1:28:22] had to rewrite the bible
[1:28:25] because their bible didn't have the
[1:28:27] blood of jesus christ in it
[1:28:32] are you with me and their bible took
[1:28:35] away the power of god
[1:28:37] in the people but you give them the real
[1:28:40] word
[1:28:42] and there'll come a fresh wind that'll
[1:28:45] blow through
[1:28:51] you can send them to prison that won't
[1:28:53] stop them
[1:28:54] you can take their churches away that
[1:28:57] won't stop them
[1:28:58] [Applause]
[1:29:02] come on church a real believer
[1:29:05] anchors his soul in the word of god
[1:29:09] and a revelation drops in their heart
[1:29:11] and the kingdom of hell
[1:29:13] can't shake that away from them
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:18] [Music]
[1:29:19] [Applause]
[1:29:23] yesterday morning and i'm going to just
[1:29:25] take just a moment here just to relax
[1:29:27] but yesterday morning
[1:29:30] i woke up to a video in my in one of my
[1:29:34] uh text links and it was a video
[1:29:38] of me preaching and i was preaching in
[1:29:41] switzerland
[1:29:43] and i call out brother guido which to
[1:29:46] this audience would be judo
[1:29:49] and i call out brother guido and while
[1:29:53] i'm preaching on god getting his
[1:29:55] own and god will not lose a one and god
[1:29:58] will chase down that predestinated
[1:30:00] seed
[1:30:05] and i call brother guido specifically
[1:30:10] that god will go after your children
[1:30:15] he'll not lose one
[1:30:18] and the clip stops and he said
[1:30:23] and this this text was from isaiah
[1:30:26] vonderbrunt
[1:30:28] now isaiah was a a
[1:30:32] good-looking man i don't have man
[1:30:34] fancies but
[1:30:37] he's a nice-looking man and he's chased
[1:30:40] the dollar he's chased the world he's
[1:30:42] chased
[1:30:43] things in life and he's avoided christ
[1:30:46] raised in a good christian home a
[1:30:49] tremendous
[1:30:51] preacher for a daddy and he's just
[1:30:54] avoided that relationship with god
[1:30:57] and all seems lost
[1:31:02] he's came to a spot in his life they're
[1:31:04] divorced
[1:31:05] he's divorced from his wife and and then
[1:31:08] later
[1:31:09] later brother guido actually talks to me
[1:31:12] about his son isaiah and and he says
[1:31:15] i've got a real burden for him
[1:31:19] that was after the meeting he begins to
[1:31:22] share that with me
[1:31:24] and so isaiah and i and i'm going to do
[1:31:27] my best to have my facts straight isaiah
[1:31:29] wants to get married and wants his daddy
[1:31:31] to marry him
[1:31:32] gido asked me said would you marry him i
[1:31:35] said absolutely
[1:31:37] marry him to his wife i said
[1:31:40] and he's going to find christ
[1:31:46] i got pictures in a little while of
[1:31:48] gaydo
[1:31:50] and his wife and guido and his son and
[1:31:52] his wife
[1:31:53] marrying beautiful days sun shining
[1:31:57] and time goes on
[1:32:00] ditto comes to north carolina in that
[1:32:03] meeting
[1:32:04] brother guido was standing to the left
[1:32:07] right
[1:32:08] that night had just the prayer line
[1:32:10] changed and
[1:32:12] i felt led to pray for the preachers
[1:32:17] boy things can get sticky when you start
[1:32:19] praying for preachers
[1:32:20] but there are some preachers that really
[1:32:22] need to be prayed for
[1:32:25] and i turned and and guido was standing
[1:32:28] about where you are brother john
[1:32:29] and he was stan and he was just standing
[1:32:31] there and he had his hands in the air
[1:32:33] and i told him about a letter that was
[1:32:36] in his briefcase
[1:32:41] i heard i heard brother andrew speak on
[1:32:43] curses last night
[1:32:45] how satan tries to curse you let me just
[1:32:48] remind you
[1:32:50] a curse is only a curse if you believe
[1:32:53] it
[1:32:54] [Applause]
[1:32:57] a curse is only a curse if you believe
[1:32:59] it
[1:33:00] you can turn that thing on its heels
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:05] are you with me one night a preacher
[1:33:08] cursed
[1:33:08] laid a curse tried to curse me and said
[1:33:11] i was going to be
[1:33:12] financially unstable the rest of my life
[1:33:16] and i turned and i said no sir
[1:33:19] god's promised he'd bless everything
[1:33:21] that i touch
[1:33:25] and god's proved himself faithful
[1:33:27] [Applause]
[1:33:29] and because i've got some great business
[1:33:31] with i got a partner
[1:33:33] his name is jesus
[1:33:39] he should be in your marriage he should
[1:33:42] be in your
[1:33:43] job he should be in your business he
[1:33:46] should be your lawyer
[1:33:47] he should be your doctor
[1:33:50] he should be your psychologist he's
[1:33:53] everything
[1:33:54] he's got the answer to every need in
[1:33:56] your life
[1:33:58] hallelujah he is the answer
[1:34:02] brother i'm looking for an answer jesus
[1:34:05] is the answer
[1:34:20] brother guido is at the next meeting
[1:34:22] that we go to
[1:34:24] and that night i had had two preachers
[1:34:27] fight me from the pulpit
[1:34:29] and they'd set back to the back and i
[1:34:31] told them to let your brakes off
[1:34:33] sitting in the audience about 800 people
[1:34:35] let your brakes off
[1:34:37] finally i walked out behind the pulpit
[1:34:38] and i said if you don't let your brakes
[1:34:40] off i'm going to call you by name
[1:34:43] then let their brakes off and then i
[1:34:46] preached
[1:34:51] everybody don't have that but i'm very
[1:34:54] very conscious of those things
[1:34:58] you see they were exposed and from that
[1:35:01] time they couldn't hide themselves
[1:35:04] as imposters in the message
[1:35:15] and they're gone now they're gone
[1:35:19] they're gone
[1:35:34] i made a statement in that pulpit i'm
[1:35:36] being very reverent now
[1:35:39] because no man does this
[1:35:42] i said if god can't work out here
[1:35:47] he'll work behind the
[1:35:51] the we're in a huge auditorium he'll
[1:35:54] work behind these curtains
[1:35:59] and i prayed for just a few people one
[1:36:01] was sister
[1:36:02] charnock that just was killed in a car
[1:36:05] wreck
[1:36:06] along with her son-in-law and daughter
[1:36:12] and she had sugar diabetes and was
[1:36:14] healed instantly
[1:36:17] and i i just stepped i i may have been
[1:36:20] wearing this suit i don't know
[1:36:22] but i stepped behind the pulpit and
[1:36:24] matthew was there and
[1:36:25] howden was there some others were there
[1:36:28] to
[1:36:29] gather me and take me to the office and
[1:36:32] do what we have to do but i just stepped
[1:36:35] behind them
[1:36:40] and you know even as i said those words
[1:36:46] i didn't realize what god was getting
[1:36:47] ready to do
[1:36:49] i'm saying some things here now how many
[1:36:52] times do we sit in church
[1:36:54] as a body believer and don't recognize
[1:36:58] god's moving
[1:37:03] like he is this morning
[1:37:06] and so i stepped behind the curtains and
[1:37:09] i stepped toward
[1:37:10] matthew and all of a sudden i just
[1:37:12] turned i felt him
[1:37:14] i just felt that fresh wind and i turned
[1:37:17] and when i did caitlyn was there
[1:37:22] and i just went and said some very
[1:37:23] personal things to her
[1:37:25] it was just for her
[1:37:28] and then nate was there
[1:37:33] and i turned and i spoke to him some
[1:37:36] very personal things
[1:37:42] and i just spoke to them
[1:37:45] and then at the end of speaking to them
[1:37:48] i said god's going to give you your baby
[1:37:54] that's not just a projection but a year
[1:37:57] a year later charlie's born
[1:38:03] i stepped up and prayed for a couple of
[1:38:06] more
[1:38:07] and then and then then i prayed for
[1:38:10] guido
[1:38:12] and gato standing there and when i speak

[1:40:08] your family to them you needed god
[1:40:12] it's more than just being a good old boy
[1:40:16] you know the good old boys club don't
[1:40:18] get you eternal life
[1:40:22] they don't get you eternal life you need
[1:40:24] a fresh wind
[1:40:29] we saw that this week
[1:40:32] men and women get a fresh wind
[1:40:35] at easter we saw a fresh wind come
[1:40:38] through the building and
[1:40:40] prophecy to speak in tongues and
[1:40:41] prophesy
[1:40:43] and talk about a total surrender to god
[1:40:47] we'll give you ultimate victory let me
[1:40:49] just say this you without a total
[1:40:50] surrender
[1:40:54] and terry just surrendered it all right
[1:40:56] there and i just hugged him
[1:40:59] i hugged him and i knew the change had
[1:41:02] happened
[1:41:05] sister betty sister betty said
[1:41:08] i walked in with one man
[1:41:11] and i walked out with another
[1:41:17] how important was that service i'll tell
[1:41:19] you how important that service was
[1:41:21] in a few weeks he finds out he's got
[1:41:22] cancer and in a couple of months
[1:41:25] his his esophagus and all of that burst
[1:41:28] inside of his lungs
[1:41:30] no way to save him but from
[1:41:34] the time that he had that moment with
[1:41:37] christ
[1:41:39] till the night that he bled out
[1:41:42] he was listening to the tapes and he
[1:41:45] just kept saying brother ron's my
[1:41:47] favorite preacher
[1:41:48] and he would listen to me over and over
[1:41:50] and over again i'm not ashamed of that
[1:41:54] i'm thankful i was a part of a man's
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:41:58] life i haven't forgot you isaiah i know
[1:42:01] you're watching
[1:42:05] and isaiah all of this has come together
[1:42:09] and guidos got on the train but god
[1:42:13] didn't forget his
[1:42:14] promise and god began to work on
[1:42:18] isaiah and he goes to a meeting that
[1:42:21] timothy pruitt is preaching
[1:42:22] in belgium
[1:42:26] and timothy pruitt is preaching on the
[1:42:29] birth
[1:42:30] and as he's preaching i something gets a
[1:42:33] hold of isaiah
[1:42:36] and isaiah finds himself at the altar
[1:42:39] and before long his wife became
[1:42:42] converted
[1:42:44] are you with me when you come to a spot
[1:42:46] in your life that nothing else is
[1:42:48] important
[1:42:49] but having an experience with jesus
[1:42:54] christ
[1:42:57] he sent me that note in that video
[1:43:01] and he said i've spent my time since
[1:43:04] then
[1:43:05] digging golden nuggets that i've missed
[1:43:09] all of these
[1:43:22] years
[1:43:39] i don't want you to miss none of these
[1:43:40] golden nuggets
[1:43:43] don't set none through none of these
[1:43:45] services and come to the point that it's
[1:43:46] just good entertainment
[1:43:50] not just cause you've got good singing
[1:43:52] and and good song leaders
[1:43:55] not because you're part of a certain
[1:43:57] family in a church
[1:43:59] that don't give you eternal life
[1:44:02] what gives you eternal life is you and
[1:44:05] jesus
[1:44:07] you and jesus when you have that moment
[1:44:11] i think i've seen you before and i'm
[1:44:12] glad to have you here amen
[1:44:14] god bless you god bless you
[1:44:30] this young man sits here because he
[1:44:31] don't want to miss nothing
[1:44:34] he's a phenomenal young man he's a
[1:44:38] phenomenal singer
[1:44:40] raised in a phenomenal home
[1:44:43] but he don't want to miss nothing that
[1:44:46] jesus has got for him
[1:44:50] it'll make you a phenomenal husband too
[1:45:04] i stood outside on the porch today i
[1:45:08] just had spoken to brother stephen
[1:45:10] and sister kara and i walked across the
[1:45:14] i walked across back to the to the
[1:45:17] office
[1:45:19] and i just kept hearing these words and
[1:45:21] they too
[1:45:22] shall be one and they too shall be one
[1:45:26] was he talking about a wedding a real
[1:45:29] wedding brother
[1:45:30] ron is he talking about this no i'm i
[1:45:32] think a union is going on here
[1:45:38] a real union where you and christ it's
[1:45:42] not a fighter
[1:45:43] wrestle your way listen marriage is not
[1:45:46] to be wrestled with
[1:45:48] it's not to be fussed about
[1:45:52] it's it's not to to spend your days on
[1:45:55] who's
[1:45:55] right and who's wrong and
[1:46:00] just being stupid for 50 years don't
[1:46:02] make that a happy marriage
[1:46:08] when you've missed your opportunity at
[1:46:10] having
[1:46:11] a wonderful relationship
[1:46:16] i'm preaching i'm preaching are you with
[1:46:19] me
[1:46:19] chasing the dollar is not what it's
[1:46:24] about
[1:46:27] driving the best car living in the best
[1:46:30] house
[1:46:30] i don't care if you live in a railroad
[1:46:32] car with tacky buttons on it
[1:46:47] you don't have to talk god don't need to
[1:46:49] talk on you for 50 years to try to get
[1:46:52] you to live right
[1:46:54] if you just surrender your life to god
[1:46:57] whoa if you just surrender your life to
[1:47:00] god
[1:47:01] and just say god i'm yours
[1:47:08] yours i'm giving myself away
[1:47:12] i'm giving myself to you
[1:47:18] fresh wind breathe upon us
[1:47:25] i watched those girls dancing last week
[1:47:30] and they were dancing you can keep
[1:47:31] standing because i'm done the musicians
[1:47:33] can come
[1:47:38] and i watched them dancing and dancing
[1:47:41] and dancing and dancing and
[1:47:44] i watched them and it was not some
[1:47:47] made up choreographed
[1:47:53] fleshly move because i
[1:47:56] i dislike all that i don't like
[1:47:59] artificial i don't
[1:48:01] i like real
[1:48:06] i like real real really really
[1:48:18] i like real i don't like pretend
[1:48:21] christians
[1:48:22] i like real hollywood don't have the
[1:48:26] best actors
[1:48:27] most of them sit in churches
[1:48:33] i like real so i told brother tim i said
[1:48:36] brother tim what i witnessed was
[1:48:38] scriptural
[1:48:40] it's a sign of the coming of the lord
[1:48:49] now whether you know it or not god sent
[1:48:50] his messenger
[1:48:53] he's gave us the inoculation sodom is
[1:48:55] here
[1:48:56] you don't have to wait on it sodom's
[1:48:58] here your government's corrupt
[1:49:02] the leaders are in their place
[1:49:04] [Applause]
[1:49:07] blue and purple the leaders are in their
[1:49:09] place
[1:49:11] that's purple
[1:49:15] for the sake of argument the color that
[1:49:17] she had on was that color
[1:49:20] and it was purple
[1:49:32] brother brown described what she would
[1:49:34] be what position she would hold
[1:49:37] what color she would have on i don't
[1:49:40] think you need to argue with that no
[1:49:42] more
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:45] the reason that you would even argue
[1:49:47] with it is because you can't live
[1:49:48] right
[1:49:50] [Applause]
[1:49:52] the reason people didn't want brother
[1:49:54] branham as a prophet is
[1:49:56] because they couldn't live what he was
[1:49:57] preaching but it was a fresh wind
[1:49:59] [Applause]
[1:50:04] god's not just on paper ipads
[1:50:10] he's just not on pictures on the wall
[1:50:16] here's where he's at
[1:50:19] here's where he's at
[1:50:23] and it's about separating the people
[1:50:26] well brother ron kovitt was horrible
[1:50:28] really
[1:50:30] there's people today that have not been
[1:50:32] able to be in a live service like this
[1:50:34] for a year
[1:50:37] for a year all over the world
[1:50:40] europe is still many other places to
[1:50:42] shut down canada just shut down some
[1:50:44] places other places shut down
[1:50:46] who knows we may have to do it again one
[1:50:48] of these days i don't know
[1:50:49] i hope not i love love's live services
[1:50:52] but let me just say covered being as bad
[1:50:56] as it was let me say
[1:50:57] worse is coming
[1:51:02] it shut people in homes and they found
[1:51:05] out
[1:51:06] i really love you
[1:51:11] i really love my mate or i really hate
[1:51:14] her
[1:51:17] they found out that they really needed
[1:51:19] to love their teachers
[1:51:23] because now they have to become the
[1:51:24] teacher and what a horrible job
[1:51:34] some of them didn't survive covet
[1:51:38] and they went right back in the world
[1:51:44] now there's a worse flu than covet it's
[1:51:46] called laodicea
[1:51:49] and it tells you that you don't need god
[1:51:53] and you can do your own thing well
[1:51:56] let me just tell you tribulations coming
[1:52:02] and during that three years you couldn't
[1:52:04] get to church
[1:52:05] but during that three years you'll find
[1:52:07] out that you need god so bad you're
[1:52:08] willing to die for him
[1:52:11] and god will give you grace to get you
[1:52:13] through it
[1:52:15] the guy that you hated that you you just
[1:52:17] didn't want to hear him preach anymore
[1:52:20] you'd wish that you was able to be in a
[1:52:28] service
[1:52:32] now i haven't wound my way out of out of
[1:52:34] my original
[1:52:35] text 380 people had something better to
[1:52:39] do
[1:52:40] than go to the upper room
[1:52:43] of you've got friends loved ones
[1:52:45] neighbors
[1:52:47] that are doing the same thing today
[1:52:52] but god deposited something on the
[1:52:54] inside of you and you said
[1:52:56] i'm not gonna miss it i can't wait till
