[56:43] people of the last age and amen amen God
[56:47] richly bless you tonight and and we'll
[56:50] just let you turn to the Bible today
[56:52] we'd like to look over in the Book of
[56:54] Revelations chapter 3
[56:57] Book of Revelations chap 3 and: 14 and
[57:00] as you're turning there we want to just
[57:02] remind you that there will be a baptism
[57:04] tomorrow after
[57:07] service and uh anybody uh anybody that
[57:10] would like to be baptized I just see one
[57:13] of the deacons there at the back and I
[57:14] know that we have a few that are
[57:17] Desiring to be baptized in the name of
[57:18] the Lord so if there's any others um we
[57:22] just ask that you uh just make yourself
[57:24] known or just come spontaneously you
[57:28] know so we don't have to have plans but
[57:30] we got plenty of water for you so we
[57:33] just uh we just we're we're under great
[57:36] anticipation for for everything that God
[57:38] has in store for us in this last age we
[57:40] don't we don't fully get to see the
[57:43] complete vision of it all but we
[57:44] recognize that we are the people of the
[57:46] reality of it and we're going to live
[57:48] out we're going to be living out the the
[57:50] very final moments and I believe that
[57:52] we're I believe that we're right here I
[57:55] believe we're right here here upon the
[57:57] the coming of the Lord and I believe
[57:59] that with everything that's within us I
[58:01] want to push I want to push to get that
[58:04] last seed and it doesn't matter doesn't
[58:06] matter what country it comes from it
[58:08] doesn't matter what continent that last
[58:10] seed is in we want to do everything
[58:12] that's within our power to preach this
[58:15] gospel with everything that's within us
[58:16] and we want that last seed because when
[58:18] that last seed matures we will go
[58:21] home amen I know that's that's the
[58:24] desire of every every Christian is to go
[58:27] home because this world is not ours amen
[58:31] Revelations 3 and: 14 and under the
[58:34] angel of the Church of the Le oans write
[58:37] these things saith the amen the faithful
[58:40] and true witness the beginning of the
[58:43] creation of God I Know Thy works that
[58:46] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[58:49] thy Work cold or hot so then because
[58:52] Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[58:54] hot I will spew thee
[58:56] out of my mouth now notice this is not
[58:58] the individual but this is the church so
[59:01] then because Thou Art lukew and neither
[59:04] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[59:07] mouth because thou sayest I am rich and
[59:10] increased with goods and have need of
[59:12] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[59:15] wretched miserable and poor and blind
[59:19] and naked I counsel thee to buy of me
[59:22] gold tried in the fire that thou mayest
[59:25] be rich and white rment that thou mayest
[59:27] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[59:29] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[59:32] eyes with iive that thou mayest see as
[59:36] many as I love I rebuke and chasen be
[59:39] zealous therefore and repent behold I
[59:42] stand at the door and knock and if any
[59:45] man hear my voice and open the door I
[59:47] will come into him and will s with him
[59:50] and he with me to him that overcometh
[59:52] will I grant to set with me in my throne
[59:55] even as as I also overcame and am set
[59:58] down with my father in his throne it's
[1:00:02] wonderful to be recognized in the Throne
[1:00:04] of the
[1:00:05] Overcomers verse 22 then he that hath an
[1:00:08] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:00:11] under the churches let's just bow our
[1:00:14] hearts just before the Lord just now
[1:00:16] Heavenly Father we approach you just now
[1:00:18] Lord we are your children and we have
[1:00:21] dedicated our life to your entire work
[1:00:24] father that everything that everything
[1:00:26] that is within us Lord we want to
[1:00:28] declare that that you are God and there
[1:00:31] is none like you and we invite you just
[1:00:34] now Lord to become Lord over our life
[1:00:36] and over every situation father the
[1:00:39] songs have been sung and Lord your your
[1:00:42] beautiful presence has came down amongst
[1:00:44] us and we invite the Lamb of God to come
[1:00:47] and to allow the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:50] to wash over our lives just now by the
[1:00:52] preaching of the word I pray that you
[1:00:54] would restore our heart Hearts to a
[1:00:57] place of worship to a place where we
[1:00:59] have been destined to be in Lord of
[1:01:02] anything that would be upon our old
[1:01:04] nature our sticky nature I pray that we
[1:01:07] would just release ourself to to the
[1:01:10] promises of God the things that you have
[1:01:13] laid out in this generation we want to
[1:01:15] be the Fulfillment of that father so God
[1:01:18] I pray that you would come and begin to
[1:01:20] speak to us through Thy word tonight you
[1:01:22] have dealt with me for quite some time
[1:01:24] upon this thought Lord Lord and you've
[1:01:26] allowed me to be able to begin to put
[1:01:29] this in a sermon this week and I pray
[1:01:31] that you would just help me move aside
[1:01:33] father even even I know that there are
[1:01:36] those that are sitting here tonight that
[1:01:38] have have infirmities in their body they
[1:01:40] have sicknesses that are going on even
[1:01:43] myself I need a touch from you and I
[1:01:45] pray God that you would just come
[1:01:46] amongst us by the preaching of the word
[1:01:48] and by your stripes may we declare that
[1:01:51] we are healed and we are delivered and I
[1:01:54] pray that you would cast Satan out today
[1:01:57] by the preaching of the word and may you
[1:01:58] break every spirit that would hold us
[1:02:01] back whether it be whether it be lust
[1:02:03] whether it be Pride or whether it be
[1:02:05] just a little bit of condemnation I pray
[1:02:07] that you'd move every bit of unbelief
[1:02:09] out father so that you could have your
[1:02:11] way in the service father we are asking
[1:02:13] for a supernatural meeting father and
[1:02:16] our hearts are hungering for more of you
[1:02:18] so we ask Lord that you would just come
[1:02:20] amongst us tonight as we pray these
[1:02:22] things in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:02:26] amen and amen may God richly bless you
[1:02:29] you may be seated you may be seated in
[1:02:32] the presence of the
[1:02:34] Lord amen amen in the morning in church
[1:02:39] age brother Brandon picks up the picks
[1:02:42] up the last verse of all the all that is
[1:02:45] written in the seven Church ages it says
[1:02:48] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:02:49] the spirit says to the churches of each
[1:02:52] age he said in every age it was the same
[1:02:55] cry hear what the spirit says he said if
[1:02:58] you're a Christian you will get back you
[1:03:01] will get back to what the spirit is
[1:03:03] teaching that is the word of this age
[1:03:06] every Messenger to every age will preach
[1:03:09] that word every fresh and true Revival
[1:03:12] will be because men have gotten back to
[1:03:14] the word for their age he said repent
[1:03:17] and come back to the word from this
[1:03:19] first book in the Bible Genesis to the
[1:03:21] last book Revelation there is only one
[1:03:24] reason for God's dis pleasure it's the
[1:03:27] leaving it's leaving the word and
[1:03:28] there's only one remedy to regain his
[1:03:31] favor it's back to the word and out of
[1:03:35] this out of this out of this context
[1:03:37] tonight I'd like to speak to you on a
[1:03:39] fresh Revival a fresh Revival that a
[1:03:42] fresh and true Revival will be because
[1:03:44] men have gotten back to the word for
[1:03:47] their age and I believe that that there
[1:03:50] is there is a call upon the uh upon the
[1:03:53] believer's heart in this generation and
[1:03:56] is to be zealous therefore and repent I
[1:03:59] believe that it it's the Zeal of this
[1:04:01] hour and I believe that when you get
[1:04:03] when you begin to hunger and thirst for
[1:04:05] almighty God that it creates a a sense
[1:04:08] of urgency on the inside of Believers
[1:04:10] and we recognize that when elaser come
[1:04:13] to where he begin to sweat things out
[1:04:15] that he was looking for a bride for for
[1:04:17] Isaac that there he begin to pray and
[1:04:20] there he begin to pray a supernatural
[1:04:22] prayer and he begin to ask God to do
[1:04:24] something very super Supernatural and
[1:04:26] there he be to pray a certain way that
[1:04:29] that God would send out a woman that
[1:04:31] would fit the description that would fit
[1:04:33] fit the description of his prayer and no
[1:04:36] more than elaser had released had
[1:04:39] released that prayer out of his mouth
[1:04:41] there Rebeca came out and I believe that
[1:04:43] I believe it was Supernatural I believe
[1:04:45] it was Supernatural how that how that he
[1:04:47] prayed that and she came out at that
[1:04:49] very moment and William Brandon would
[1:04:51] tell us he said no more than your heart
[1:04:53] goes to hungering and thirsting for God
[1:04:55] he he said some kind of a holy ghost
[1:04:57] Revival will break out somewhere he said
[1:05:00] something will take place he said a
[1:05:01] neighbor might get healed and come and
[1:05:03] tell you about it he said but something
[1:05:05] will take place to let you see that the
[1:05:08] angel of the Lord is moving ain't that
[1:05:11] powerful as soon as you go to hungering
[1:05:13] for it as soon as you get to calling and
[1:05:15] thirsting for a for a Revival that God
[1:05:18] will release something that God will
[1:05:20] release something to let you know that
[1:05:22] the angel of the Lord is moving ain't it
[1:05:24] powerful to know know that that if
[1:05:26] you've got a hunger on the inside of you
[1:05:28] whether it be for whether it be for
[1:05:30] healing or whether it be for something
[1:05:31] Supernatural or whether it be for the
[1:05:33] word of God that God will meet you and
[1:05:36] every time that he meets you it is
[1:05:38] Supernatural when he comes to you in
[1:05:40] that kind of situation because when men
[1:05:42] get desperate and men get in a spot of
[1:05:44] emergency that's when God shows up
[1:05:46] because God is the only one that can
[1:05:49] show up in a time of emergency and gets
[1:05:51] you out of and I believe that if we're
[1:05:53] ever if we're going to say that we're an
[1:05:55] emergency that the Le Odyssey and church
[1:05:57] age could say that they are in a spot of
[1:05:59] desperation to realize that they are in
[1:06:02] need of something that is that is
[1:06:04] greater than something that is man-made
[1:06:06] they are in need of something that is
[1:06:07] more than just a church building but
[1:06:09] they are in they are in need of a
[1:06:12] Revival and when men go to Desiring and
[1:06:15] a Desiring a Revival then the spirit of
[1:06:18] God will show up and bring a Revival to
[1:06:21] meet the hour or meet the situation of
[1:06:24] the need now will brandom said in broken
[1:06:26] cister I hope you don't mind quotes
[1:06:29] tonight but he said education can never
[1:06:32] bring life he said it takes the spirit
[1:06:34] of God to bring life and that life must
[1:06:36] not come out of just an intellectual
[1:06:38] Revival it's got to come out of the
[1:06:40] Bible a word Revival and that word is
[1:06:43] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:06:45] he said when it falls today and quickens
[1:06:48] you you get the same results that you
[1:06:50] did in Acts chapter 2 you see it always
[1:06:53] has and it always will be it's because
[1:06:56] the spirit of God conditions the
[1:06:58] atmosphere so we can't have an
[1:07:00] intellectual Revival when we're in need
[1:07:03] of a word Revival and you can watch it
[1:07:05] in every age that there was there's
[1:07:07] always twins there was always a word
[1:07:09] Revival and there's an intellectual
[1:07:11] Revival in every single age but how you
[1:07:14] tell the difference between a true
[1:07:16] Revival and a false Revival is a false
[1:07:19] Revival will take people away from the
[1:07:21] word of the hour but a true Revival will
[1:07:24] bring people and draw them them right
[1:07:26] back to the word of the hour and we've
[1:07:28] had man-made revivals we've had
[1:07:30] theological revivals but what we are
[1:07:33] experiencing in this hour is a
[1:07:35] manifested word of God as it's come back
[1:07:39] and and it is it has brought us into a
[1:07:41] word Revival and what this word Revival
[1:07:44] has done to the Church of the Living God
[1:07:46] it has caused us to put our life or put
[1:07:49] our bodies on verge of a body change you
[1:07:52] see that's what the word that's what the
[1:07:55] word wants to do it wants to be made
[1:07:57] flesh in our bodies and it is we
[1:08:00] recognize that what we are a part of is
[1:08:03] a manifestation of the word of the hour
[1:08:06] that you recognize that the condition
[1:08:08] that you are in is because the spirit of
[1:08:10] God has set up the atmosphere to create
[1:08:13] a word Revival what you are a part of no
[1:08:17] man did this what you are a part of no
[1:08:19] school did this what you're a part of no
[1:08:22] intellectual Revival caus this you see
[1:08:25] what is it the spirit of God conditioned
[1:08:27] the atmosphere so that we could have a
[1:08:30] word
[1:08:31] Revival you see even William brandham
[1:08:34] recognized that his own children needed
[1:08:36] a word Revival even when William
[1:08:38] brandham was standing there in certain
[1:08:40] meetings he he said now he said if you
[1:08:42] seen me come in and I winked at a little
[1:08:44] girl he said I was winking at my
[1:08:45] daughter out there he said he said it
[1:08:47] takes an atmosphere he said it takes an
[1:08:50] atmosphere to bring the supernatural he
[1:08:52] said an i he said that's the reason in
[1:08:55] the purpose purpose of this is for the
[1:08:57] atmosphere or the Supernatural and he
[1:08:59] said I'm wanting my daughter to receive
[1:09:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he
[1:09:03] said it takes an atmosphere like this
[1:09:06] you see William Brandon was even though
[1:09:08] he was a prophet of the age he
[1:09:10] recognized that his children needed the
[1:09:12] same atmosphere that you have need
[1:09:16] of you see but he's only going to appear
[1:09:19] to those that are looking for him you
[1:09:22] see then when when he goes down there
[1:09:25] when when Jesus goes down there unto a
[1:09:27] woman in Samaria because the Samaritans
[1:09:29] knew he said you know they were looking
[1:09:31] for a messiah and he said anybody that's
[1:09:34] looking for a messiah he will come he
[1:09:36] said if you're here looking for him
[1:09:38] tonight he will meet you how many come
[1:09:41] here looking for him tonight he said if
[1:09:43] you're here looking for him tonight he
[1:09:45] will meet you he said but if you're not
[1:09:47] looking for him he's not looking for you
[1:09:51] either woo he said if you're not looking
[1:09:55] for him he's not looking for you either
[1:09:58] he said if you're not looking for him he
[1:10:00] will never come to you but God only ever
[1:10:03] appears to those that are elected for
[1:10:05] the hour you see there's so many of
[1:10:08] people that heard the word but he never
[1:10:10] appeared to them why because they were
[1:10:12] unbelievers from their birth but God is
[1:10:16] in this generation has elected a people
[1:10:18] that he would appear himself would come
[1:10:21] and he would show himself
[1:10:23] to I'm think thankful to be a part of a
[1:10:27] people that he's that he's elected to
[1:10:29] appear to now just indulge me just for a
[1:10:32] minute when William brandham said what
[1:10:34] we need is not a new membership he said
[1:10:37] it's the power of the Holy Ghost back in
[1:10:39] the church again old fashion Pentecostal
[1:10:42] Revival in the power and demonstrations
[1:10:44] of the Holy Ghost again he would say
[1:10:47] what we need is back to the Bible back
[1:10:50] to real Holiness back to back to where
[1:10:52] people can have faith again again he
[1:10:55] said what we need is the gospel from the
[1:10:57] pulpit to straighten up all the way from
[1:11:00] the pulpit to the janitor what we need
[1:11:03] the oldfashioned St Paul Revival that
[1:11:06] the Bible holy ghost days God doesn't
[1:11:09] change it all again what he said he said
[1:11:11] what we need is a Revival a Revival
[1:11:14] doesn't mean bring in new members it's
[1:11:16] revive what we already
[1:11:21] got I believe we've got some great
[1:11:24] things as a church of the Living God but
[1:11:26] I believe that you can have more I
[1:11:28] believe there's more God for you here
[1:11:30] tonight I believe there's more
[1:11:32] Deliverance here for you tonight I
[1:11:33] believe there's more of the message for
[1:11:35] you here tonight I believe there's
[1:11:37] greater understanding for you here
[1:11:39] tonight and again he would say in the
[1:11:41] absolute and he said the only thing that
[1:11:43] you want to do is dance in the spirit
[1:11:45] and speak in tongues he said that's all
[1:11:47] you know about he said that's all that
[1:11:48] seed that has been planted he said but
[1:11:50] what we need is the Full Gospel planted
[1:11:54] in a full heart with full power to bring
[1:11:57] back a full
[1:11:58] absolute you see God put you in Revival
[1:12:02] a supernatural being with Divine Healing
[1:12:05] and divine power and divine workings and
[1:12:07] so forth by miracles of god put the
[1:12:10] church the Rapture bride that's got oil
[1:12:13] in her lamp put her in Revival there is
[1:12:16] a supernatural God that maybe you have
[1:12:18] never witnessed in your life or maybe
[1:12:20] you never seen but because you have
[1:12:22] received a word Revival you recognize
[1:12:25] that there was a supernatural being that
[1:12:28] put you in Revival well I say it like
[1:12:30] this if if he put me in Revival there
[1:12:33] ain't no man going to take me out of it
[1:12:35] there's no idea going to take me out of
[1:12:37] it there's no sickness that can take me
[1:12:39] out of it there's no depression that can
[1:12:42] take me out of it if he put me in it
[1:12:45] then I ain't coming out come on somebody
[1:12:49] I didn't put myself in this message I
[1:12:51] didn't bring myself back to the word but
[1:12:54] he put me in it
[1:12:57] Hallelujah if you're not in Revival then
[1:13:00] you need a change you would say well I I
[1:13:02] we're waiting on Labor Day for a Revival
[1:13:05] that's absolutely false the bride is in
[1:13:08] a word Revival that can't be taken away
[1:13:11] from her that can't be robbed away from
[1:13:15] her what is it the word Revival Came To
[1:13:19] You by the preaching of the message you
[1:13:22] see a Revival is going on it's a sewing
[1:13:25] that has taken place and the
[1:13:27] denominations are sewing their seed but
[1:13:29] a denomination will only sow or only
[1:13:32] reap a denomination but what has been
[1:13:34] swn in this generation will reap a bride
[1:13:37] for Jesus Christ it's a word Revival
[1:13:39] that has taking place and the only thing
[1:13:42] that can water a message seed is the
[1:13:45] anointing of Malachi 4 you see you are
[1:13:49] anointed you are anointed with a you are
[1:13:52] being watered with an anointing that
[1:13:54] would only prod produces bride material
[1:13:57] you see you can take this anointing and
[1:13:59] pour it on the rest of the churches but
[1:14:01] it'll never produce on the anything
[1:14:03] anything else but what they already are
[1:14:06] because the seed was already what it was
[1:14:09] before it ever got
[1:14:11] deposited but he put something on the
[1:14:13] inside of you that you're not just
[1:14:15] Lutheran that you're not just Wesleyan
[1:14:18] that you're not just Pentecostal but
[1:14:20] bride material and only bride material
[1:14:24] can be watered by a bride
[1:14:28] anointing Hallelujah you see because
[1:14:31] every seed is going to bring forth of
[1:14:32] its kind you see that's why William
[1:14:35] Brandon would say about you that you are
[1:14:37] a word kind of people you see you're a
[1:14:39] word kind of people because as just as
[1:14:42] Jesus or or God would say there in the
[1:14:44] beginning let every let every seed bring
[1:14:47] forth after its kind and you know that
[1:14:50] you are a word kind you're a word kind
[1:14:53] that even David was a word kind that
[1:14:56] David was a man that was made after
[1:14:59] God's Own Heart you see when God creates
[1:15:02] a man he creates him of his own kind but
[1:15:06] David was the kind of man that that God
[1:15:08] would say you're a man after my own
[1:15:09] heart because David was quick to repent
[1:15:13] David would say I've hid Thy word in my
[1:15:15] heart I've hid your word in my heart
[1:15:18] that I might not sinned against you and
[1:15:20] brother Bram said this about David I
[1:15:22] found it so amazing he said the only
[1:15:24] thing that David needed was the rain you
[1:15:28] see he was a he was a kind of God he was
[1:15:30] a seed of God but the only thing that he
[1:15:33] needed he said but you see you see the
[1:15:36] Holy Ghost had not been given
[1:15:38] yet the Holy Ghost had not been given
[1:15:41] yet he said I've hid it in My Heart Lord
[1:15:43] but it won't blo out and act like it
[1:15:47] should here's a man that was made after
[1:15:50] God's kind but he said I've hid Thy word
[1:15:53] in my heart I've hid it in there he said
[1:15:56] I've constantly i' I've hung it on my
[1:15:58] dead my bed post I I studied it day in
[1:16:01] and day night I I put it on my eyelids
[1:16:04] but you see when Jesus came which was
[1:16:06] the word made manifest he took the germ
[1:16:08] of life out of it and brings it back to
[1:16:11] the word of God
[1:16:12] again and if David's cup run
[1:16:16] over if David's cup run over then how
[1:16:19] much more should your cup be running
[1:16:21] over come on somebody this is not a
[1:16:24] Revival that takes you from one meeting
[1:16:26] to the next meeting and you're still
[1:16:28] waiting for the Holy Ghost but the
[1:16:31] Hallelujah but this message has given
[1:16:34] you power to stay in
[1:16:39] Revival stay in Revival and if David was
[1:16:42] a man without the Holy Ghost and it
[1:16:44] could say that my cup runneth over how
[1:16:46] much more as Sons and Daughters of
[1:16:48] almighty God should we be saying here my
[1:16:51] cup's running over
[1:16:56] come on somebody if you are not in
[1:16:58] Revival you've missed the
[1:17:02] message I'm going to be very plain with
[1:17:04] you if you are not in Revival you have
[1:17:06] missed what is going on let me tell you
[1:17:09] this I don't need somebody to pump me up
[1:17:12] Prime me up try to press me up or press
[1:17:15] me down I am in
[1:17:20] Revival come on somebody there ain't no
[1:17:22] preacher that can Pump It Up all I
[1:17:25] simply do is preach the gospel and the
[1:17:27] gospel do what he said it would
[1:17:31] do the message came to put you in
[1:17:37] Revival
[1:17:39] Hallelujah you see the message is
[1:17:42] Christ the message is Christ and that's
[1:17:45] what the the call of the hour is is back
[1:17:49] to the word you see the reason why that
[1:17:53] you as the body of Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] or inter waps or cycle it's because
[1:17:58] you've been feeding on the unfailing
[1:18:00] body word you've been eating you've been
[1:18:02] eating this book you've been eating this
[1:18:04] book you've been you've been feeding on
[1:18:06] it you've had over 1,00 sermons you've
[1:18:09] got spiritual food in due season and if
[1:18:11] there ever was a time of famine the
[1:18:13] church the world is in famine but while
[1:18:17] they are in famine you're in
[1:18:19] Revival you've been feeding on this
[1:18:22] you've been feeding on this and what
[1:18:24] power gave ezekiel's bones to come back
[1:18:27] to life again is the same power that has
[1:18:29] put a church in its position I'll say
[1:18:32] this this word Revival this word Revival
[1:18:36] has put you in position to believe that
[1:18:38] all things are
[1:18:40] possible you remember when William Bam's
[1:18:42] out there on Lake Michigan he got to
[1:18:43] watch in that Lake how that that wake
[1:18:46] that Lake was it was jumping and it was
[1:18:48] it was breathing and all the waves were
[1:18:50] splashing around and it was it was
[1:18:52] foaming up he said I got to studying
[1:18:54] that thing out he said there wasn't no
[1:18:56] more water in that than when it when it
[1:18:59] was sitting still when it was completely
[1:19:01] glass he said but the only difference
[1:19:03] was is there was a wind behind it that
[1:19:06] created all that jumping that created
[1:19:08] all that shouting that created all that
[1:19:10] praising let me say this to you you've
[1:19:13] had the same power on the inside of you
[1:19:16] but let the wind get behind it come on
[1:19:19] somebody you've heard the message all
[1:19:21] your life but let the wind get behind it
[1:19:25] come on little stream what are you
[1:19:27] bubbling for what makes you bubble is it
[1:19:30] the deer is it the Cockroaches is it the
[1:19:33] antelopes is it the denominations is it
[1:19:36] the world absolutely not it's something
[1:19:40] on the inside of
[1:19:41] me what makes you stay hungry for the
[1:19:44] word what makes you feed on this what
[1:19:46] makes you pray what makes you stay make
[1:19:49] you stay dignitary or stay in a spot of
[1:19:52] Revival what is it you can't explain it
[1:19:55] to nobody else they don't understand how
[1:19:57] your prayer life has waned they don't
[1:20:00] understand how your prayer life has not
[1:20:01] went away but it's got stronger it's
[1:20:04] something on the inside of you come on
[1:20:07] somebody it's something on the inside of
[1:20:10] you to keep you in
[1:20:15] Revival
[1:20:17] Hallelujah now notice this leay odyssean
[1:20:19] age that God spews a church out of his
[1:20:22] mouth not individuals not any place in
[1:20:25] the Bible does it say that we are in his
[1:20:27] mouth but the Bible says that we are
[1:20:30] engraved upon the palms of his hand so
[1:20:33] the word has got to be in his mouth as
[1:20:36] it said in Matthew 4:4 but he answered
[1:20:38] and said unto him it is written man said
[1:20:40] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:20:42] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:20:43] God you see the word is supposed to be
[1:20:45] in our mouths too now we know that the
[1:20:48] church is his body he said is there is
[1:20:51] it here taking his place he said what
[1:20:54] will be in in the mouth of the church
[1:20:56] the
[1:20:57] word the word you see every fresh and
[1:21:00] true Revival will be because men have
[1:21:03] gotten back to the word well you say
[1:21:06] brother Andrew I can't seem to live
[1:21:07] right I can't seem to overcome let me
[1:21:09] ask you what's in your mouth I can't to
[1:21:11] I seem to keep falling down and seeing
[1:21:13] what's in your mouth come on somebody I
[1:21:16] seem to I seem to always be in a spot of
[1:21:18] depression what's in your mouth you see
[1:21:21] if you want power to come into your life
[1:21:23] if you want vision to come in your life
[1:21:25] if you want demonstrations of the Holy
[1:21:27] Ghost to come into your life then you've
[1:21:29] got to get back to the word because
[1:21:31] Jesus said if you abide in me and my
[1:21:32] words abide in you ask what you will and
[1:21:35] it shall be done unto you if you want to
[1:21:36] know where the secret lies to Heaven
[1:21:39] power to Heaven anointing if you want to
[1:21:41] understand Hallelujah if you want to
[1:21:44] understand how to be a part of the
[1:21:46] brid's Revival get back to the
[1:21:49] word get back to the word you see you
[1:21:53] see where Samson got him s is in trouble
[1:21:56] was he let go of the word of God you see
[1:21:59] he gave God his strength he gave God his
[1:22:02] he gave God his he gave God his power
[1:22:05] but he gave to Lia his
[1:22:07] heart he gave God he gave God of his
[1:22:10] power what did he do he shared his
[1:22:14] secret he shared his secret where his
[1:22:17] power
[1:22:18] was with a woman of the
[1:22:21] night and William brandham comes and he
[1:22:25] speaks to brandom Tabernacle he said
[1:22:28] brandom Tabernacle the Philistines are
[1:22:30] on
[1:22:31] you he said where you've told your
[1:22:34] secret where your power comes from he
[1:22:37] said Pentecost he said the Philistines
[1:22:39] are on you he said but how are we going
[1:22:41] to have a Revival in our day how can we
[1:22:44] have it when the regular Revival Giver
[1:22:47] is bound by the word it's bound by the
[1:22:50] world you see because men gave
[1:22:52] themselves over to money they gave them
[1:22:54] themselves up to they gave themselves up
[1:22:56] to the world they gave themselves up to
[1:22:58] their jobs and the world kept creeping
[1:23:00] in and it bound Hallelujah it bound
[1:23:03] Jesus and it couldn't have a Revival on
[1:23:06] the inside of him but William bradam
[1:23:09] said this he said here is the only H
[1:23:12] hope that I have this morning is to wind
[1:23:14] up my message is while Samson was bound
[1:23:17] that a new suck of hair begin to grow
[1:23:19] out you may have been bound with the
[1:23:22] world but let your hair grow out Let
[1:23:24] Your Glory come out you may have got
[1:23:26] strung out and you may have started
[1:23:29] cutting your hair Hallelujah you may
[1:23:30] have been start cutting your hair and
[1:23:32] letting the world come in and letting
[1:23:34] the world rob you from this that or the
[1:23:36] other but I pray and my only hope is
[1:23:38] that this message has produce the power
[1:23:41] on the inside of you to unbind the
[1:23:45] Revival
[1:23:47] Giver unbind the Revival Giver I say it
[1:23:50] like this like the message of the hour
[1:23:53] has got the vitamin
[1:23:54] to put power back in the Church of the
[1:23:57] Living
[1:24:01] God so a real true Prophet points back
[1:24:05] to the word of the
[1:24:08] Lord a real true Prophet points back to
[1:24:11] the word of the Lord so the promise of
[1:24:12] the Lord the promise of the Lord not a
[1:24:15] declaration that a church has made but a
[1:24:17] declaration that God has made back to
[1:24:21] the word of the Lord that's what a true
[1:24:25] Prophet is going to do you see the
[1:24:27] reason why you see the reason why sent
[1:24:30] Malachi 4 was to come and unbind the
[1:24:32] Revival Giver because over Seven Ages
[1:24:36] they had bound him up by Creeds and
[1:24:39] dogmas they bound him up but here in
[1:24:42] this generation there was an eagle
[1:24:44] Prophet that pointed us right back to
[1:24:46] the word of God and came here and Loos
[1:24:49] the Seven Seals every every fundamental
[1:24:52] doctrine that men have built up and
[1:24:55] build up their ideas there was a message
[1:24:57] that struck this generation that Unbound
[1:25:00] the Revival Giver William Brandon said
[1:25:02] in the Feast of the trumpets he's been
[1:25:04] bound at the doors of Creeds and dogmas
[1:25:07] he said but the church is going to be
[1:25:10] liberated again I'll say what this
[1:25:13] message did it put you in a position to
[1:25:16] have a word
[1:25:18] Revival even Jesus would say that where
[1:25:21] the carcass is the Eagles will be
[1:25:23] gathered you see you see why Jesus
[1:25:25] likened you not only His prophets but he
[1:25:28] likened you to Eagles is because Eagles
[1:25:31] don't eat some dead carryon they don't
[1:25:34] eat what Luther eats they don't eat what
[1:25:36] Wesleyan eat they don't eat some dead
[1:25:38] rabbit on the side of the road like a
[1:25:40] Hulk does you can't you can't feed this
[1:25:43] Bride on some man-made idea or some
[1:25:46] man-made Revival but what it takes is a
[1:25:49] fresh kill of the word you see you can't
[1:25:51] even feed this bride Pentecostalism
[1:25:54] because she won't eat it because it's
[1:25:56] dead where is it dead at the life left
[1:25:59] the stock and went into the
[1:26:02] seed come on somebody this word puts you
[1:26:05] in position for a body
[1:26:08] change a Revival is stirring something
[1:26:12] that you already
[1:26:15] got where'd you get the power at where'd
[1:26:18] you get the anointing at you had it ever
[1:26:21] since
[1:26:24] ever since God saw you before the
[1:26:26] foundation of the world you didn't look
[1:26:28] like a son you didn't act like a son but
[1:26:31] God saw
[1:26:33] something on the inside of you that was
[1:26:36] worth
[1:26:40] redeeming every generation each
[1:26:43] generation gets a fresh
[1:26:47] chance a fresh chance an opportunity at
[1:26:51] the fresh word I'm quoting to you I'm
[1:26:54] giving you quotes tonight cuz I ain't
[1:26:57] going to let the devil beat you around
[1:26:58] on this is my idea but I'm telling you
[1:27:01] that this is a word Revival that was
[1:27:03] given by a word Prophet that was
[1:27:05] anointed for this generation and he said
[1:27:08] that every generation has its
[1:27:10] opportunity at the fresh word of God
[1:27:12] that's why I believe in preaching these
[1:27:14] youth camps that's why I believe in
[1:27:16] believe believing in preaching to these
[1:27:17] young people that they can receive the
[1:27:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost that it wasn't
[1:27:21] just for our oldtimers it wasn't just
[1:27:24] days gone by but I believe it's for
[1:27:26] every son every daughter of God that you
[1:27:28] can have a fresh chance of this word
[1:27:31] hallelujah the devil's tried to take
[1:27:33] every chance away from you but God said
[1:27:35] I've giv you another chance the world's
[1:27:37] tried to rob you of chances but God said
[1:27:40] I'm giving you a chance when the world
[1:27:42] discounted you and the world tried to
[1:27:44] push you aside God said I'm giving
[1:27:47] you a chance
[1:27:54] come on
[1:27:56] somebody you've heard me say it before
[1:27:59] you gave G you gave drugs a
[1:28:01] chance you gave the world a chance you
[1:28:04] gave politics a chance come on somebody
[1:28:07] you gave your God your job a chance you
[1:28:09] gave money a chance why not give God a
[1:28:13] chance he's giv you a chance where you
[1:28:16] say well I failed him one time I say get
[1:28:18] back up again because God's not just the
[1:28:21] god of first chances he's not just a god
[1:28:23] of second Second Chances he's said God
[1:28:25] of third fourth and fifth chances maybe
[1:28:28] you've been to the doctor and the doctor
[1:28:30] ain't gave you a chance but give God a
[1:28:33] chance give him an opportunity to show
[1:28:36] his power to show his demonstration to
[1:28:39] show that he still
[1:28:42] God what is it brother Ron that's held
[1:28:45] you all these years it's a fresh Revival
[1:28:48] and it ain't something that just
[1:28:49] happened years ago but it's as fresh now
[1:28:53] it's as fresh now
[1:28:54] as it was
[1:29:00] then now go study in the church age book
[1:29:03] brother random said in the Ephesian
[1:29:04] Church age he said you watch he said
[1:29:06] that God that the cycles of Revival and
[1:29:09] death never die he said when it looks
[1:29:11] like the glimmer of Hope's going out God
[1:29:13] comes in light the fire
[1:29:15] again you see in every age in every
[1:29:18] generation he's given them an
[1:29:20] opportunity because when it looks like
[1:29:22] all hope is gone God lights the fire
[1:29:26] again I'm thankful to be a part of this
[1:29:29] generation I'm thankful to be a part of
[1:29:31] this message I'm thanking to be sitting
[1:29:34] here understanding what the message is
[1:29:38] that it ain't just a new book that it
[1:29:40] ain't just a new theology but it's a
[1:29:43] person it's a person we hav't
[1:29:47] encountered a power that the world can't
[1:29:51] understand
[1:29:54] you see in every age he is raised up
[1:29:57] when when Jews when the Jews rejected
[1:30:00] him and pushed him aside God raised up a
[1:30:03] gentile
[1:30:06] bride you see in every age I'm going to
[1:30:08] give you a little bit of a little bit of
[1:30:10] History here but in every age he gives a
[1:30:13] thres chance the word when you look at
[1:30:15] Columba there in the th tyan Church age
[1:30:18] which means laxed and loose or hazy
[1:30:21] brother brandom said it was an
[1:30:22] illegitimate time
[1:30:24] but Columba believed the word of God he
[1:30:27] believed in the power of God and you go
[1:30:29] to study and I'm not going to take you
[1:30:30] through it all but you go to studying
[1:30:32] Out Columbus life he had some powerful
[1:30:34] Miracles that happened this man took a
[1:30:36] took a message he took a message of what
[1:30:39] he knew and he shook he shook all of is
[1:30:42] he shook all of Ireland and he shook all
[1:30:44] of Scotland and he stood right there and
[1:30:46] he cursed all the snakes I wish he'd
[1:30:48] have done that in America but he cursed
[1:30:50] all the snakes out of Ireland and in
[1:30:52] Scotland and the pillar of fire was was
[1:30:54] identified in Columbus's Ministry that
[1:30:56] men would recognize that when Columba
[1:30:58] was praying in his house that the pillar
[1:31:01] of fire would come flying and showing
[1:31:03] through his
[1:31:04] house what was it when men like when
[1:31:07] when St Parton or St Martin would stand
[1:31:09] there and he would preach the gospel he
[1:31:12] didn't just preach it from some
[1:31:13] Theologian idea he preached it in power
[1:31:16] and in demonstration and when he would
[1:31:19] walk into cities and he would preach the
[1:31:21] gospel to a city and they wouldn't show
[1:31:22] him no respect that even God when they
[1:31:25] wouldn't show this prophet of that age
[1:31:28] any respect God even burn up that King's
[1:31:32] robe and the back of him and made him
[1:31:34] rise up and salute the prophet of God
[1:31:36] that entered that City he said even his
[1:31:38] seat caught on fire what he was sitting
[1:31:40] there on the
[1:31:42] throne because God is going to give an
[1:31:45] opportunity to every every age and every
[1:31:49] time to have a chance at the word of God
[1:31:52] men like Luther raised up
[1:31:54] and nailed 95 pieces to the church door
[1:31:57] and he refused to recant and he created
[1:32:00] he started one of the greatest
[1:32:02] reformations that ever has been and it
[1:32:05] said about say it said about Luther
[1:32:07] about Marth and Luther he said it was no
[1:32:10] strange thing how that Martin Luther
[1:32:12] could protest the Catholic church and
[1:32:13] get by with it he said but how Luther
[1:32:16] could hold his head above the fanaticism
[1:32:18] that followed his Revival he said it's
[1:32:20] been that way in every reformation and
[1:32:23] in every age and the same way it is
[1:32:25] today there's a lot of fanaticism that's
[1:32:28] tacked on to call Divine Healing and
[1:32:29] signs and wonders he said but what does
[1:32:32] a bogus dollar represent a bogus dollar
[1:32:35] speaks that there's a real one
[1:32:38] somewhere to think that they saw Martin
[1:32:41] and they saw Luther rise up in power and
[1:32:43] they said we'll identify with that but
[1:32:45] they went on their own false Revival but
[1:32:48] just because there's false revivals does
[1:32:51] not mean that what you're a part of is
[1:32:53] false
[1:32:55] come on somebody just because people
[1:32:57] build their campfires around wrong
[1:32:59] theologies of the message does it mean
[1:33:02] that this revival is
[1:33:06] wrong come on somebody you're going to
[1:33:09] have a whole lot of fanaticism that
[1:33:10] comes in and tries to identify it it's
[1:33:13] that close to being a reality that that
[1:33:16] that in this last age that Christ would
[1:33:18] come that Christ would come and the
[1:33:20] Antichrist would come and it would be
[1:33:22] that close that it would deceive the
[1:33:24] very elect if it was possible but
[1:33:26] because there's a gene SE of God
[1:33:28] fanaticism never catches the idea or
[1:33:32] never catches a soul of a true born
[1:33:34] again son and daughter of
[1:33:41] God when it come to the Welch
[1:33:43] Revival when Wesley started
[1:33:48] preaching the power of God would
[1:33:51] fall and tens of thousands would begin
[1:33:53] to faint at the presence of the
[1:33:56] Lord when you study out the Walsh
[1:33:58] Revival you see that Walsh Revival it
[1:34:01] was a jubil time for them people it
[1:34:03] started out just a bunch of illiterate
[1:34:05] people just a preaching the gospel and
[1:34:07] the power of the glory of God Begin to
[1:34:08] Fall until businessmen would go to work
[1:34:11] and sit down at their desk and weep like
[1:34:14] babies close their businesses farms in
[1:34:16] the farmers in the
[1:34:18] field farmers in the field would be
[1:34:20] sitting on their plows and plowing
[1:34:22] they'd stop their teams and get get out
[1:34:23] in the field rank Sinners would raise up
[1:34:26] their hands to God and cry out for Mercy
[1:34:28] people walking on the roads everywhere
[1:34:30] whistles started blowing and everything
[1:34:32] else what was it there was a revival
[1:34:34] going on there brother random said that
[1:34:37] that men didn't even know where to where
[1:34:40] to put the source on of where the Welch
[1:34:43] Revival even came from it just started
[1:34:46] with a bunch of illiterate people they
[1:34:48] started praying men like William Cary he
[1:34:51] raised up under that Welsh Revival and
[1:34:53] gave was gave himself to foreign
[1:34:55] missions and he translated the Bible
[1:34:57] into 42 different languages men like
[1:35:00] Evan Roberts at 12 years old gave
[1:35:02] himself over to God he looked like any
[1:35:04] other child he worked alongside of his
[1:35:06] father in the dangerous wst coal mines
[1:35:09] in the 1890s and he would spend the next
[1:35:11] 11 years working with his father until
[1:35:14] he was 23 years old for it was in those
[1:35:16] Minds he said that there though in those
[1:35:19] Minds it impacted his life more than any
[1:35:22] other time in his life
[1:35:24] because they are in their minds God
[1:35:26] begin to stir Evan Robert's heart to
[1:35:29] pray for his beloved dwells and the more
[1:35:31] he prayed the more he began to have a
[1:35:34] god-ordained vision showing whales being
[1:35:36] lift up lifted up into
[1:35:38] heaven he said those days made him a man
[1:35:41] of prayer not a man who prays but a man
[1:35:44] of prayer every day he would spend no
[1:35:47] less than one hour in prayer often much
[1:35:50] longer than that he arranged his
[1:35:52] schedule to to include that
[1:35:55] hour and if he woke up late then it was
[1:35:59] his work that had to wait and not his
[1:36:04] prayer oh my my my my
[1:36:08] my how mean y'all been late now don't go
[1:36:10] tell your boss just cuz you're late you
[1:36:13] was
[1:36:14] praying but men like Evan Robert's got a
[1:36:17] hold was a part of the W Revival and
[1:36:20] they created such a stir with the noble
[1:36:24] men from America when they went over
[1:36:26] there to the W they went over there and
[1:36:28] they was looking for it they was looking
[1:36:30] for it they come out there and their
[1:36:32] dignified collars and everything else
[1:36:34] and there was a policeman out there that
[1:36:36] was standing out there had a whistle in
[1:36:37] his mouth and had a had a had a club in
[1:36:39] his hand it was just whirling around and
[1:36:42] these noble men begin to ask that police
[1:36:44] officer said where is the Welsh Revival
[1:36:47] at he looked at them and said you're in
[1:36:49] the middle of it you're in the middle of
[1:36:51] it I am the W Revival
[1:36:54] well if you're looking for a word
[1:36:55] Revival and the brid's Revival I want to
[1:36:58] say this to you you're in the middle of
[1:37:00] it you're in the middle of it I am the
[1:37:03] brides Revival I am the brides Revival I
[1:37:07] am the brides Revival I am the bride's
[1:37:10] Revival let me say this to you if you
[1:37:13] want your children to get a hold of this
[1:37:15] Holy Ghost put them right in the middle
[1:37:17] of
[1:37:18] it don't push it off for days gone by
[1:37:21] tell them it's right here don't push it
[1:37:23] off and say well God's coming in maybe
[1:37:24] 10 or 15 years tell them he's coming
[1:37:28] today he might come for you today he
[1:37:30] might come for you tomorrow but you
[1:37:32] better be
[1:37:34] ready Hallelujah you're looking at
[1:37:38] it and there God would raise up the isua
[1:37:43] Street Revival and it's one of the most
[1:37:46] historical series of Revival meetings
[1:37:49] that's ever took place on the face of
[1:37:50] the
[1:37:52] earth when a colored man that was
[1:37:55] blinded in one eye humbled his heart
[1:37:58] with no
[1:37:59] education he was looking for a fresh
[1:38:02] Revival he grew up under Ministry that
[1:38:06] believed in the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:07] Ghost and when churches invited him out
[1:38:11] there to Los Angeles and they found out
[1:38:13] that he had a view on the baptism of the
[1:38:16] Holy Ghost the churches barred him from
[1:38:18] coming and preaching in their her
[1:38:21] churches but if God send you to do
[1:38:24] something you will not find any excuse
[1:38:27] not to preach come on somebody it's
[1:38:29] Satan that brings up excuses it's Satan
[1:38:32] that brings up trouble it's Satan that's
[1:38:34] trying to stop you from believing this
[1:38:36] message but William Seymour was not
[1:38:39] discouraged because churches didn't want
[1:38:42] him preaching on the Holy Ghost he
[1:38:43] started going to little he went started
[1:38:45] going to Little House meetings and he
[1:38:47] started preaching the gospel about God
[1:38:49] is go pouring out his spirit and a
[1:38:52] restoration of gifts of speaking in
[1:38:54] tongues and there he begin to preach in
[1:38:56] homes there he begin to preach in this
[1:38:58] home and that home and then he went to a
[1:39:01] little bit omission and one night while
[1:39:03] he was a preaching on April the 9th of
[1:39:06] 1906 he started preaching right there
[1:39:08] and all of a sudden one started speaking
[1:39:10] in tongues and another started speaking
[1:39:12] in tongues and before long six were
[1:39:14] speaking in tongues well the word
[1:39:16] started getting out that God was
[1:39:18] creating a Revival right there on the
[1:39:20] isua street they had to move from the
[1:39:22] building and go outside people were
[1:39:25] being healed some of the greatest
[1:39:27] healings you ever heard of when you go
[1:39:30] to studying out the isusa Revival
[1:39:32] happened right there men came from all
[1:39:34] over the world to be a part of the isua
[1:39:38] Revival but it stopped in
[1:39:41] 1915 and ever since then Pentecost the
[1:39:45] denomination has been trying to restore
[1:39:48] and go back to them days of Revival
[1:39:51] again
[1:39:55] out of that Revival men like Paul Raider
[1:39:58] would catch fire he was an instrument
[1:40:02] and sending scores of missionaries to
[1:40:03] countries all over the world in addition
[1:40:06] to influencing hundreds of young men to
[1:40:08] enter the
[1:40:10] ministry men like Charles finny would
[1:40:13] rise up there in Rochester North New
[1:40:15] York he would stand there he would
[1:40:18] preach the gospel in the street and from
[1:40:20] five miles away conviction would strike
[1:40:23] and men would drop their lunch Pals and
[1:40:25] give their heart to almighty
[1:40:30] God it was two women in finny's church
[1:40:33] at the time said finny you got a great
[1:40:36] hold on the word but what you really
[1:40:38] need is a holy
[1:40:40] ghost what you really need is a holy
[1:40:42] ghost you might have a good hold on this
[1:40:44] message but what you really need is a
[1:40:47] holy ghost you might have listened to
[1:40:49] every single tape and you may have read
[1:40:51] your Bible through three or four times
[1:40:53] but what you really need is a holy
[1:40:55] ghost He said I tell you one thing he
[1:40:57] said I've got the Holy Ghost I've got
[1:41:00] the Holy Ghost said no sir I pray that
[1:41:02] you get the Holy Ghost well this
[1:41:05] bothered Charles finny and while he was
[1:41:07] at work one day every day he get out
[1:41:09] there behind behind his office and he
[1:41:12] get down there and pray and ask God to
[1:41:14] do something for him how while he was
[1:41:16] out there day after day after day of
[1:41:18] praying he was out there in a bush a
[1:41:20] tree branch begin to break and Charles
[1:41:23] he jumped up real quick because he was
[1:41:26] ashamed that his boss would catch him
[1:41:27] out there
[1:41:31] praying and he found out it was nobody
[1:41:33] but
[1:41:36] Jesus and he started thinking there I am
[1:41:39] I'm ashamed of my boss if he'd catch me
[1:41:41] praying I'd be ashamed of my boss he'd
[1:41:44] catch me praying he said but how much
[1:41:45] greater is my Jesus over my boss and he
[1:41:49] got down and he started praying and
[1:41:52] brother bam said he got so much in the
[1:41:54] presence of God that Charles finny
[1:41:56] started screaming and shouting and going
[1:41:58] all over the city he he said he made
[1:42:01] such a fool of himself that he hid
[1:42:03] himself behind the door said God if you
[1:42:06] don't help me stop this I'm going to
[1:42:08] make a fool of
[1:42:10] you when's the last time that you got so
[1:42:13] under the
[1:42:15] anointing I'm not just talking about
[1:42:17] Pentecost I'm talking about I am not
[1:42:20] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:42:23] for it is the power under salvation
[1:42:28] hallu it created such a stir in Charles
[1:42:33] finny that he stood there he was just
[1:42:36] testing out the Acoustics in a building
[1:42:38] one
[1:42:41] day he stood there and said repent or
[1:42:44] perish and a man that was up there in
[1:42:46] the balcony dropped over the it scared
[1:42:49] him so bad that he dropped over G he
[1:42:52] dropped over and right
[1:42:54] there what was what was it Charles finny
[1:42:57] was
[1:42:58] stirred he was
[1:43:01] stirred by a fresh
[1:43:04] Revival you think about this how
[1:43:07] precious that God
[1:43:09] entrusted these Souls of men with the
[1:43:12] true word of their
[1:43:14] age men like Moody that would read lead
[1:43:17] over five million souls to Jesus Christ
[1:43:20] men like morai ham would raise up and
[1:43:23] out of his ministry would rise a Billy
[1:43:25] Graham and William random said of
[1:43:27] anybody that's got the Mechanics for the
[1:43:30] Revival he said it's Billy Graham he
[1:43:32] said but he don't have no Dynamics to go
[1:43:34] with it you see because denominations
[1:43:38] had bound had bound the word of God from
[1:43:41] having the dynamic
[1:43:43] power what was it every single one of
[1:43:46] these revivals that ever took place it
[1:43:48] denominated within 3 to 5 years but this
[1:43:52] m message has been going on for close to
[1:43:56] 70 years now and there's not one
[1:43:58] denomination of
[1:44:02] it
[1:44:05] Hallelujah Pentecost is asking they're
[1:44:08] asking for a restoration of them days
[1:44:10] have gone by of a Revival but I've got
[1:44:13] bad news for them William brandham said
[1:44:15] the prophet of this age in 1957 he said
[1:44:18] the Pentecostal Revival is
[1:44:21] over he said it's over why they rejected
[1:44:24] the word of God you think about this in
[1:44:27] 50 years from 50 years from the very
[1:44:31] start of Pentecost how far had they
[1:44:34] fallen from their Heritage in 50
[1:44:37] years and they were missing the Revival
[1:44:39] that was taking place and they were
[1:44:41] looking to go back you see that's the
[1:44:44] problem with so many people like Nelly
[1:44:46] Saunders they want to go back they want
[1:44:48] to go back to the days gone by they want
[1:44:51] to go back to their past they want to go
[1:44:53] back to their history I'll tell you this
[1:44:56] I appreciate brother Homer but I don't
[1:44:58] want to go back to brother Homer's
[1:45:03] day oh my don't let me hurt your
[1:45:05] feelings I don't want to go back to
[1:45:07] William brandom's day now you'll get
[1:45:10] with me I don't want to go back just to
[1:45:12] William brandom's day I want to stay
[1:45:15] right here in this revival because when
[1:45:19] William Brandon was standing there in
[1:45:21] 1965 there was even one message church
[1:45:24] as we know it today but if William
[1:45:27] brandham would stand in this
[1:45:29] Pulpit he could preach the message
[1:45:32] without fault and without failure he
[1:45:35] wouldn't have to hold himself back
[1:45:37] because he was afraid of hurting
[1:45:38] somebody's
[1:45:40] feelings this is a message church and we
[1:45:43] believe a message a message that came
[1:45:46] from the Throne of almighty
[1:45:50] God you see because even in early days
[1:45:53] in the 1950s William Brandon would stand
[1:45:55] there right in front of the Isuzu Street
[1:45:58] people and the full gospel movement and
[1:46:00] tell them that what they had was not
[1:46:03] enough he would stand there and tell the
[1:46:05] Pentecostals that you ain't went far
[1:46:06] enough and when they had him to stand
[1:46:10] there in
[1:46:10] 1956 in their Jubilee year in their
[1:46:14] anniversary meetings he stood right
[1:46:16] there in
[1:46:17] California and he preached a sermon on
[1:46:20] why Pentecost failed
[1:46:23] am
[1:46:24] woo you better know where you're
[1:46:26] standing
[1:46:29] at can you mind imagine preaching where
[1:46:32] Pentecost faed right in front of them
[1:46:33] Bishops and all them so-called so-called
[1:46:36] prophets of their
[1:46:38] generation to stand up there and tell
[1:46:40] them this is why Pentecost failed and
[1:46:43] when when you go to listen back to why
[1:46:45] Pentecost failed brother bandam takes
[1:46:47] them through the three courts from the
[1:46:49] outer courts to the inner courts he said
[1:46:52] if you win all the way in there he said
[1:46:54] you received the Mana you received the
[1:46:56] spirit he said but you didn't go on to
[1:46:58] the holies of holies he said but if
[1:47:01] you'd go on you would have you would
[1:47:04] have what Peter had you say well brother
[1:47:07] Andrew is that where we're living at
[1:47:09] absolutely not because when Christ rent
[1:47:12] The Veil when Christ rent The Veil every
[1:47:15] believer can come into the presence of
[1:47:18] the holies of holies and you're not just
[1:47:20] feeding on a dead carryon but you're
[1:47:22] feeding on the fresh man of the word of
[1:47:25] God you see when he rent The Veil when
[1:47:27] Christ rent The Veil at the day of
[1:47:29] Calvary he was showing that he was going
[1:47:31] to do a fresh work and when you start
[1:47:34] reading the book of Acts you begin to
[1:47:36] see Christianity for the very first
[1:47:39] time that God was going to fill his
[1:47:42] church not just walk with them but he
[1:47:45] was going to fill his church with his
[1:47:49] spirit because he told him in Luke 24 49
[1:47:53] that go up there and wait in Jerusalem
[1:47:55] for I will send you power from on high
[1:47:58] he told him in Acts chapter 1 that
[1:47:59] you're going to be Witnesses unto me you
[1:48:01] see what he did God started a Revival
[1:48:03] with them 120 completely surrendered in
[1:48:06] his hands and it never ended and the
[1:48:09] fire cannot be put
[1:48:10] out you see I want you to I want you to
[1:48:13] hear me loud and clear this message did
[1:48:15] not just take us back to an isua
[1:48:18] Pentecost because isua is a denomination
[1:48:22] but Pentecost is an experience you see
[1:48:25] but true Pentecost this message took us
[1:48:28] back to a true Pentecostal experience
[1:48:32] and beyond all of
[1:48:34] that because when Peter is standing
[1:48:36] there in Acts chapter 2 the Bible said
[1:48:38] that when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:48:40] come they were all with him in one
[1:48:43] Accord in one place and suddenly there
[1:48:45] came a sound from Heaven As A rushan
[1:48:47] Mighty Wind and it filled all the house
[1:48:50] where they were sitting at and there
[1:48:51] appeared under them clo tongues like as
[1:48:53] as a fire and set upon each of them and
[1:48:56] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:48:59] and began to speak with other
[1:49:02] tongues you got to think where they're
[1:49:05] setting
[1:49:06] at this is a present truth that they're
[1:49:10] living in the very moment that Joel
[1:49:13] saw this was when when when Peter begins
[1:49:16] to preach Peter has to calm himself done
[1:49:20] down out of out of the anointing to
[1:49:22] begin to preach could you imagine could
[1:49:25] you imagine handing Peter a microphone
[1:49:27] on Sunday
[1:49:30] morning said okay now Pete you only got
[1:49:33] 20 minutes because we got to let this
[1:49:34] church out at 1:00 so they can go out
[1:49:37] there and see the chariot races it ain't
[1:49:39] going to work it ain't going to work
[1:49:41] because Peter had something greater than
[1:49:44] a bunch of carnal message Believers that
[1:49:46] want to get out just so they can enjoy
[1:49:49] their favorite TV show or their or their
[1:49:52] ball game names but Peter was not that
[1:49:54] kind of man I know I hurt your feelings
[1:49:57] but we're in a fresh Revival I don't
[1:49:59] care if Tim pu comes here at Labor Day
[1:50:02] and preaches 15
[1:50:04] hours as long as it's anointed from
[1:50:06] almighty God I'll take every
[1:50:10] sentence I get sick and tired of people
[1:50:13] saying that the preacher's too loud and
[1:50:15] the preacher preaches too long and he
[1:50:18] gets too sweaty and he sweats too much
[1:50:20] and he smells too bad he preach too long
[1:50:23] he didn't preach long enough the air
[1:50:25] condition ain't right the Heat ain't
[1:50:26] right somebody took my seat get with
[1:50:29] it get with it when we fund churches
[1:50:34] over in China when we fund churches over
[1:50:37] in Africa that don't even have a chair
[1:50:39] to sit
[1:50:41] on they'd be happy to have a chair like
[1:50:44] you got but you're so
[1:50:47] [Applause]
[1:50:50] carnal but God start something on the
[1:50:53] inside of me that I don't care how long
[1:50:56] he preaches I don't care how long we
[1:50:59] worship I don't care I just want him I
[1:51:04] want him I want him I want
[1:51:09] him to think for the very first time the
[1:51:13] Church of the Living God can have an
[1:51:15] encounter with the one that wrote this
[1:51:17] word come on somebody he's not held back
[1:51:20] by Creeds he's not held back by do dogas
[1:51:23] he's not held back by superstitions he's
[1:51:25] not held back by intellectual revivals
[1:51:27] but he's here and you can encounter him
[1:51:30] the angel of the Lord is moving because
[1:51:33] somebody is hungering for
[1:51:39] it what makes you run all the way up
[1:51:41] here what makes you come all the way
[1:51:43] eight hours for what a chance at a fresh
[1:51:48] Revival what made you move what made you
[1:51:51] get out of your chair
[1:51:53] what made you get
[1:51:58] up an encounter with
[1:52:02] him an encounter with
[1:52:05] him brother Jim it's worth
[1:52:09] everything I have been so
[1:52:12] moved I have been so moved
[1:52:17] and maybe I shouldn't say it but I just
[1:52:20] I have been so moved for the the ex
[1:52:27] homage I
[1:52:32] I to see them to come all the way that
[1:52:35] they're
[1:52:39] coming now I'm not trying to get on you
[1:52:42] I'm just trying to tell you where you
[1:52:43] should be living
[1:52:47] at because let me just drop some things
[1:52:50] to you
[1:52:52] they gave up
[1:52:55] everything this ain't just like you this
[1:52:58] is this is their Community this is their
[1:53:01] this is the world that they know as soon
[1:53:02] as they identify with this message as
[1:53:05] soon as they identify with this message
[1:53:06] brother Tom they were immediately
[1:53:09] shunned that men no longer can do
[1:53:12] business with them they can't talk to
[1:53:14] them and I was talking to brother Melvin
[1:53:16] this past week he said he said if we
[1:53:18] ever in when when we was in the amus
[1:53:20] community he said if we even stopped by
[1:53:22] a by a tent meeting on the side of the
[1:53:25] road he said we was shunned right
[1:53:31] there now every one of you gave up
[1:53:34] something but to this to them it's
[1:53:38] fresh this message is everything to them
[1:53:41] because they lost family they lost
[1:53:43] friends they lost jobs they lost let me
[1:53:47] tell you they lost they lost a lot in
[1:53:50] the human life but what they lost
[1:53:53] God has gave them more and
[1:53:55] gain let me tell you God if you give
[1:53:59] something up for God God is no de to no
[1:54:03] man if he brings you out he's got a
[1:54:06] purpose in bringing you out to take you
[1:54:10] somewhere he took Abram out of his kin
[1:54:13] folks home to take him to a land to take
[1:54:17] him to a city whose Builder and maker
[1:54:19] was God
[1:54:25] he brought
[1:54:27] Noah he brought Noah out of the
[1:54:29] Wilderness to give him
[1:54:32] Victory he G he brought Moses he brought
[1:54:35] Moses out of water to make him a
[1:54:38] prophet he brought Moses out of out of
[1:54:40] the desert sitting back there with a
[1:54:42] sunburn a stick in his hand and a
[1:54:44] talking
[1:54:47] Butch let me tell you but what he got
[1:54:49] was a fresh Revival because he had got
[1:54:51] some news he got some news from the
[1:54:53] angel of the Lord that I'm getting ready
[1:54:55] to create the greatest jailbreak that's
[1:54:58] ever been recorded in history over 2
[1:55:00] million people in one night are coming
[1:55:03] out but if God is bringing you out he's
[1:55:06] taking you
[1:55:07] somewhere let me tell you he brought you
[1:55:10] out of churches to bring you to be a
[1:55:12] part of this
[1:55:14] bride I'm just going to lay you some few
[1:55:16] things I'm gonna preach to you
[1:55:18] now I'm gonna preach to you now William
[1:55:21] Brandon would stand there he would stand
[1:55:23] there in
[1:55:23] 1963 he would stand there in the seals
[1:55:26] and said the bride has not had a Revival
[1:55:28] yet she's not had a great stirring yet
[1:55:30] he said but it'll take them seven
[1:55:33] unknown Thunders to wake up the bride
[1:55:35] again he would say it he said before a
[1:55:37] revival can come he said God has got to
[1:55:40] be the one that send it he said and
[1:55:42] it'll take some nip with it'll take some
[1:55:44] nip with and it don't even know how to
[1:55:46] write his own name just like he did on
[1:55:48] the day of Pentecost and he said he'll
[1:55:50] raise he will create a Revival right
[1:55:53] there before a revival can come God's
[1:55:55] got to send it again when he's standing
[1:55:58] there and recognizing your day and his
[1:56:00] message if you ain't listened to it for
[1:56:01] a while go and listen to it William bham
[1:56:04] is standing there he said some of my
[1:56:05] best friends Jack Moore he said they're
[1:56:08] standing out there and they they publish
[1:56:10] that great magazine and it said it's
[1:56:12] constantly fast and pray fast and pray
[1:56:15] fast and pray he said what is it he said
[1:56:17] they're awaiting a Great Awakening he
[1:56:20] said but they have not recognized that
[1:56:22] the bride has already been woke
[1:56:24] up from
[1:56:26] 1963 when the seals were being opened he
[1:56:29] said the bride had not received her
[1:56:31] Revival yet but in
[1:56:33] 1964 he stands right there and says the
[1:56:36] bride has been woke up what was it it
[1:56:40] was a sign not that six seals had been
[1:56:42] released but Seven Seals had been
[1:56:49] released I'm saying this to you that if
[1:56:51] you want the B baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:53] if you want a fresh Revival if you want
[1:56:55] a fresh stirring don't wait on it you
[1:56:58] ain't got to wait 10 days for it you
[1:57:00] ain't got to wait for your deliverance
[1:57:02] you ain't got to wait for the next
[1:57:03] Revival you're in it you're in the
[1:57:06] middle of
[1:57:09] it he said if you've ever if you've ever
[1:57:12] studied the Revival of the ages he said
[1:57:16] you'll studied out he said that when
[1:57:18] God he said Revival is a signal that the
[1:57:24] power of God is being released a Revival
[1:57:28] is showing that there is a power of God
[1:57:30] that can be received he said but when
[1:57:32] that is taking place he said you see he
[1:57:35] said when when when God's in Revival he
[1:57:38] said then Satan is in one
[1:57:43] to he said because you look at the W
[1:57:45] Revival and you studied out he said not
[1:57:47] many people know this he said but the
[1:57:49] insane asylums he said they were
[1:57:51] absolutely full in the middle of the
[1:57:53] West Revival he said what it is is Satan
[1:57:55] is trying to distract from what really
[1:57:58] God is doing and you look what is taking
[1:58:00] place the message of the hour that has
[1:58:03] been released in this generation there's
[1:58:05] never been a day that we've understood
[1:58:07] like we're understanding where we
[1:58:09] understand eternal security where we
[1:58:11] understand the godhead has been released
[1:58:13] into a body form and we recognize that
[1:58:16] there is a true serpent seed but we
[1:58:18] recognize that there is an elected seed
[1:58:20] that the seals have been opened that's
[1:58:22] true water baptism and all of these
[1:58:25] things it's been
[1:58:28] restored but what is it that Satan has
[1:58:30] raised his head with men behind
[1:58:32] computers that tried to stop this
[1:58:34] revival with men of deceivers of
[1:58:37] denominations and dogmas and Creeds that
[1:58:40] tried to stop this Mighty move of God if
[1:58:43] God has sent a Revival then s had then
[1:58:46] Hil has in a Revival
[1:58:55] you saidwell I'm waiting on
[1:58:56] it I'm waiting on my
[1:58:59] opportunity I'm waiting on my
[1:59:03] opportunity well I want to tell you your
[1:59:05] opportunity is right
[1:59:07] here because because I can say this that
[1:59:10] it is a rising of the
[1:59:12] sun it is a rising of the Sun that this
[1:59:14] what you have received and not just
[1:59:16] mechanics but it's the
[1:59:18] Dynamics of almighty God
[1:59:24] I ain't had rain for a little bit
[1:59:25] brother
[1:59:26] Andrew I pray God opens up the windows
[1:59:29] of
[1:59:30] heaven and he opens up the windows of
[1:59:33] heaven and pours out upon the seed that
[1:59:34] he
[1:59:36] deposited and creates a Revival on the
[1:59:38] inside of you like never before you
[1:59:41] might be like Elijah in First Kings 18-
[1:59:45] 41 when he's standing there he ain't had
[1:59:47] no rain Israel ain't had no rain for
[1:59:49] quite some time and he standing there
[1:59:53] and he tells Ahab go back down to your
[1:59:55] kingdom and get your rain barrels out
[1:59:58] because I hear the abundance of the
[2:00:00] sound of rain a
[2:00:02] coming I want to tell you this if you're
[2:00:04] waiting to get your rain barrels out
[2:00:06] you're too
[2:00:07] late don't wait to get them out put them
[2:00:11] out right
[2:00:13] now don't wait to put them out don't
[2:00:16] wait till tomorrow morning service put
[2:00:18] them out right now the rain is here the
[2:00:21] rain is here maybe all you can see like
[2:00:24] Elijah is the size of a cloud of a man's
[2:00:27] hand but I want to say by that little
[2:00:29] moving right there that there is a
[2:00:31] Revival that is
[2:00:33] here hallelujah it's what I got to press
[2:00:37] through this and I got to press through
[2:00:38] that press past your unbelief press past
[2:00:41] your fear
[2:00:43] press press past your soal
[2:00:49] awkwardness press pass your social
[2:00:53] awkwardness I'm afraid that if I receive
[2:00:56] that it'll make me do things that I
[2:00:58] don't really want to
[2:01:02] do brother Gabriel do you mind if I
[2:01:10] scream brother Timothy do you mind if I
[2:01:14] shout Brother David do you mind if I
[2:01:20] dance I guarantee these people that are
[2:01:23] sitting here don't mind if you
[2:01:26] cry I guarantee you these people don't
[2:01:28] mind if you break through I guarantee
[2:01:31] these people ain't going to get on
[2:01:32] Facebook and say well ah they should
[2:01:33] have been down in the altar 20 30 years
[2:01:35] ago I guarantee you this there ain't
[2:01:38] going to be one person that'll make fun
[2:01:40] of you but there'll be a whole host of
[2:01:43] of Believers that will surround you and
[2:01:45] pray for
[2:01:48] you but too many times people because of
[2:01:52] social awkwardness don't release what's
[2:01:55] on the inside of him that's
[2:01:57] burning forget your social awkwardness
[2:02:00] who cares if you boohoo and wash some
[2:02:03] makeup off of your face who cares if you
[2:02:05] cry and come to this Altar and soak this
[2:02:08] carpet with
[2:02:10] [Applause]
[2:02:16] tears the only person that's holding you
[2:02:19] back is you
[2:02:23] it's you but I want to I want to stand
[2:02:25] here and I want to be the guy in your
[2:02:27] corner you can do this you can press
[2:02:30] through you can have the Holy Ghost you
[2:02:32] can have your breakthrough you can have
[2:02:34] more you can have more Revelation you
[2:02:37] can have a deeper sincerity you can roll
[2:02:39] away condemnation you can push sickness
[2:02:42] down you can be a real Overcomer you can
[2:02:44] be a real wife you can be a real husband
[2:02:47] you can be a real son but I don't know
[2:02:49] if I can let me tell you like William
[2:02:51] brandom said it he said if that plane
[2:02:54] ever pushes past that sound barrier it
[2:02:57] breaks forth into unlimited speed he
[2:03:00] said if you'll break forth past that
[2:03:02] unbelief barrier un unlimited Revival
[2:03:05] will break
[2:03:07] forth you've never experienced anything
[2:03:10] like this in all your
[2:03:14] life I'm not trying to take you back to
[2:03:16] something I'm trying to tell you it's
[2:03:19] here you see because at the day of
[2:03:22] Pentecost 10 days before 10 days before
[2:03:25] they had to go up there and wait for it
[2:03:28] but you don't have to wait for it
[2:03:29] because the times of refreshing are here
[2:03:32] and they are
[2:03:35] now well to be honest brother Andrew
[2:03:37] it's a little bit too chilly in here for
[2:03:38] me
[2:03:40] tonight so I'm I'm a little bit afraid
[2:03:44] cuz I got to put my sweater and my
[2:03:45] jacket on
[2:03:56] I preached a meeting in Belgium this
[2:03:58] past
[2:03:59] year year after year after year it's a
[2:04:02] middle winter there but young
[2:04:05] people young
[2:04:08] people that are having a fresh Revival
[2:04:11] said take me out there in that cold
[2:04:13] ocean and baptize me in the name of
[2:04:15] Jesus Christ they don't care if it's too
[2:04:19] cold our pastor's been to to Jamaica
[2:04:22] then been all over the world preach this
[2:04:24] message everywhere there's people that
[2:04:25] sit on
[2:04:26] post there's people that sit in lawn
[2:04:28] chairs just to hear set underneath a
[2:04:32] tent where are you living at where you
[2:04:35] living at the word has been restored
[2:04:37] under
[2:04:38] you come on somebody you don't have to
[2:04:40] wait for me to preach you into a Revival
[2:04:43] you're in it the reason why you're
[2:04:46] having a happening like you're in it's
[2:04:48] because you recognize that something is
[2:04:51] happened a message has came to
[2:04:57] you I'm just waiting on the angel to get
[2:05:00] in the
[2:05:01] water I'm just waiting to get he's I'm
[2:05:04] just waiting for a certain season when
[2:05:05] he comes by and when he comes by I'll
[2:05:07] step in I want to tell you step in right
[2:05:09] now step in right
[2:05:11] now there ain't nothing else that has to
[2:05:14] be released to this bride of Jesus
[2:05:16] Christ because when William Brandon when
[2:05:18] God sealed his lips in 1965
[2:05:21] let me tell you the message had came to
[2:05:23] its fruition but now it's a time for a
[2:05:26] body to stand up in
[2:05:31] position this is your
[2:05:35] chance ain't it good to be in
[2:05:38] Revival ain't it good to be in Revival
[2:05:41] ain't it good to be a part of a
[2:05:44] stirring ain't it good to be a part of
[2:05:49] something that you don't care care you
[2:05:52] don't care what the mockers say you
[2:05:54] don't care what the critics say they
[2:05:57] don't understand why you're shouting
[2:06:00] they don't understand why you're
[2:06:03] happy well there's some people that I
[2:06:05] know that never went out there in the
[2:06:07] world I know they never went out there
[2:06:09] in the world they never did drugs they
[2:06:12] never did dope they never did alcohol
[2:06:14] musicians get up here so I can stop
[2:06:18] preaching but they shout as loud as some
[2:06:21] of you you that was ranked
[2:06:23] Sinners they've got as much right to
[2:06:25] shout because they was born in sin and
[2:06:27] they were shaped in iniquity just like
[2:06:29] anybody else and they recognize that
[2:06:32] they've got a reason to Rejoice just
[2:06:34] like anybody else has got a reason to
[2:06:35] Rejoice so I say unto you if you're not
[2:06:38] living in Revival it's time for a season
[2:06:41] change and come up here to where the
[2:06:44] message is
[2:06:45] at come on Eagles it's a fresh word for
[2:06:49] you you can't feed on denomination ISM
[2:06:52] you can't feed on your own ideas start
[2:06:54] feeding on this unfailing body
[2:06:59] work you ain't got to sing the song let
[2:07:01] Revival come you're in
[2:07:03] it you're in it come on somebody you
[2:07:07] might need a Revival but the Revival
[2:07:09] that you're needing is in this
[2:07:11] room you might need a fresh stirring but
[2:07:14] your fresh stirring is in the room you
[2:07:16] might need a miracle but your Miracle's
[2:07:18] in the room
[2:07:24] hallelujah

[2:07:29] proud I'm proud I'm proud to be a part
[2:07:35] of this fresh
[2:07:38] Revival you're not
[2:07:40] lukewarm you have to deal with
[2:07:42] lukewarmness you have to deal with Le
[2:07:44] Odyssey but you ain't lukewarm by no
[2:07:46] means this bride of Jesus Christ her
[2:07:49] heart is on fire for more of God
[2:07:52] nobody's got to tell you to pray
[2:07:55] nobody's got to tell you to worship
[2:07:57] nobody's got to tell you to read your
[2:07:59] Bible you are in Revival because you and
[2:08:02] the word have become one come on
[2:08:04] somebody you're in it you're in it and

[2:08:16] going to come a change over you a
[2:08:18] sweeping of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:22] it could have never happened unless this
[2:08:24] message came that's right but you're
[2:08:27] here now you're here now so the only
[2:08:31] thing left for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:08:34] is the
