[12:41] christ was born

[12:50] [Music]
[13:13] that jesus christ
[13:18] that
[13:20] [Music]
[13:31] just to testify the lord i know many of
[13:33] us know
[13:35] i spoke with
[13:36] speaking with brother ron and
[13:39] i don't think we can ever brag enough on
[13:41] our lord
[13:42] and he's certainly been good to me
[13:45] and
[13:47] i spoke to you about the job and many of
[13:49] us here know about the situation but
[13:51] maybe there's some
[13:52] over the internet that don't know and
[13:53] maybe this testimony might help somebody
[13:55] believe
[13:57] this morning in the promises of the lord
[13:59] and his word
[14:01] if i can remember because my memory
[14:03] ain't the best but i'm going to try to
[14:05] give god glory for what he's done
[14:07] because the job that i now have is
[14:10] without
[14:11] doubt was the hand of the lord
[14:13] it's better than i even imagined
[14:16] this week
[14:18] all the final tests and everything are
[14:20] over they finally came they certified me
[14:23] as a conductor for the railroad i didn't
[14:25] realize it was all that much to it as it
[14:27] was but a lot of tests
[14:29] a lot of things went on
[14:32] but back in december when they came to
[14:34] me and brother greg and
[14:36] gave us news right there two weeks
[14:37] before christmas they was closing our
[14:39] shop
[14:40] and that december 29th would be our last
[14:42] day of working for the railroad
[14:46] and it was a job that i enjoyed a lot
[14:49] just something i enjoyed doing the type
[14:51] of work and
[14:52] but i knew that god was with me
[14:56] he says he's with me and i knew that if
[14:58] that door closed he had something for me
[15:02] and then not having a job brother ron
[15:05] preaching one night
[15:07] under the anointing spoke and he said
[15:08] they thought that they hurt you by
[15:10] taking your job away
[15:12] but god's going to bless you
[15:14] he said the latter will be better than
[15:16] the beginning and i'm here to tell you
[15:18] tonight that it is
[15:19] more so than i ever imagined
[15:21] [Music]
[15:23] but as time went and i heard about an
[15:25] opening coming up on the cnw that's
[15:28] where i wanted to get and that's where
[15:29] the lord placed me
[15:32] i kept trying to reach out to people and
[15:34] the bosses i went all the way through
[15:36] the command of here local to the ones
[15:38] that do the hiring in mcdonough georgia
[15:40] and atlanta georgia and i talk to people
[15:43] no one knew of this position that i kept
[15:44] asking for for the cnw
[15:47] they're not a union part on the railroad
[15:49] so it's not known about too much
[15:53] and i just kept getting nowhere
[15:56] and
[15:57] i wanted to get back to the railroad i
[15:59] felt guilty in the heart because the god
[16:01] had blessed me i had a good job
[16:05] that he gave me at mckee
[16:07] a job that i spoke to the lord there'd
[16:08] be many men would like to have the job
[16:11] that i had but it just wasn't what i was
[16:13] wanting to do in life
[16:15] kind of difficult when you had a job and
[16:16] it's really what you want to do when you
[16:18] get up and go to work and you're happy
[16:19] that this is what you like doing and
[16:21] then you got a job where it's a good job
[16:23] just not quite what you want to do
[16:26] but i felt bad about that now and i just
[16:28] talked to the lord i said lord i
[16:29] it's not that i'm not grateful i know
[16:31] you gave me this job and how it worked
[16:33] out
[16:34] but i'd just like to get back to where i
[16:36] was and i had a lot of time invested
[16:38] there in that retirement and things and
[16:41] just praying and asking to the lord that
[16:43] he would move for me and
[16:46] that position come up on the cnw but
[16:48] they were hiring in shannon door also
[16:51] and no one knew how to get to the cnw
[16:53] the only thing i could do was apply for
[16:55] the position in shannon door and the
[16:56] downfall of that was if they put me in
[16:58] shannon door
[16:59] it was going to pull me out of church
[17:01] greatly
[17:02] i would miss more than i would be here
[17:05] and the only hope i had of getting over
[17:06] there
[17:07] was by applying for conductor and
[17:09] shining door and hoping that it would
[17:10] move and get me there
[17:12] but i asked the boss who i have now what
[17:14] have i got to do to get over there they
[17:16] should be like winning the lottery to
[17:18] get this spot that you're wanting
[17:20] [Music]
[17:22] so
[17:23] one night there in the prayer line well
[17:24] first we had an interview
[17:26] i applied for that conductor's job i got
[17:28] an interview
[17:29] and i prayed to the lord i said lord if
[17:32] it be your will
[17:35] then let it be for the cnw because if
[17:37] it's not for the cnw lord that job will
[17:39] take me away and i don't want that
[17:41] i didn't want to miss coming here i knew
[17:43] who i was before this and i know you go
[17:46] to miss and it won't be long you'll fall
[17:47] right back to where you was
[17:49] and i thank god for the hunger in my
[17:50] heart because this is where i like being
[17:52] when these doors are open
[17:55] so there was a prayer line one night
[17:57] there after just right directly after
[17:59] that interview and i asked jenny i had
[18:00] to go to work that night on third i said
[18:02] go through that prayer line
[18:05] and ask about that situation and about
[18:08] our son and before i left i said don't
[18:10] mention don't mention the job
[18:13] i said god's well aware of the job now
[18:16] me and her haven't said nothing to no
[18:17] one about this job situation
[18:19] i said if it's important
[18:21] to the lord he's going to lay it on
[18:23] brother ron's heart
[18:24] and we'll know
[18:26] she come through that prayer line for
[18:27] our son
[18:29] and after praying for him she went to
[18:30] walk off from brother ron grabbed her by
[18:32] the shoulder
[18:33] and he said
[18:35] god's got that job situation
[18:37] [Music]
[18:38] i knew then
[18:40] because as i was praying to the lord
[18:44] i said god
[18:45] i know we don't ask for things to for
[18:47] signs and things but
[18:49] it's really important this move could
[18:51] pull me out of church
[18:53] and i just need to know lord is it your
[18:55] will or not and
[18:57] i spoke to the lord about gillian
[18:59] about how he gave him two signs he gave
[19:01] him one sign and that wasn't enough he
[19:02] asked for another i said i'm not asking
[19:03] for two
[19:05] but i'd like to just know
[19:06] lord
[19:08] well there was a sign right there
[19:11] jenny texted me that night at work when
[19:12] i come out on break and i seen it and i
[19:14] was so excited because i was sold i knew
[19:16] then he didn't know that
[19:18] about that job situation
[19:21] so the next day
[19:22] after church i text brother ron i said i
[19:25] want to
[19:26] tell you something about what the lord
[19:27] has done he said call me
[19:30] so when i called him
[19:32] i went to tell him about what the lord
[19:33] done he said wait i want to tell you
[19:35] something
[19:36] [Music]
[19:38] you say anything
[19:40] three weeks before i even had the
[19:42] interview
[19:44] god doesn't give this to brother ron and
[19:46] says shannon's gonna be a conductor on
[19:47] the railroad
[19:49] the statue of a conductor
[19:52] that was three weeks before the railroad
[19:54] even knew they was giving me an
[19:55] interview
[19:58] when we got that
[19:59] me and jenny both agreed we can go ahead
[20:01] and give the notice
[20:03] and we gave my notice
[20:06] and six weeks we went
[20:09] without hearing a thing no one contacted
[20:11] me no job
[20:13] now you know the enemy likes to whisper
[20:16] but his me and brother denny spoke
[20:18] that night when i told him about that
[20:19] statue i went to that i said god you
[20:21] said
[20:22] i'm going to be a conductor
[20:25] and i'm here to tell you this week that
[20:26] i am
[20:28] a conductor
[20:29] [Applause]
[20:39] when they got rid of me there on the
[20:40] railroad i just did reach three weeks
[20:42] vacation
[20:44] they've hired me back in january i got
[20:46] five weeks paid vacation
[20:48] that's what the lord does
[20:52] i won't even get into all the other
[20:53] benefits

[41:57] [Applause]
[42:05] thank you sisters for that wonderful
[42:07] song
[42:09] brother gabriel
[42:10] you have a testimony you'd like to share
[42:12] this morning
[42:19] you know after brother shannon gave that
[42:20] testimony
[42:22] i'm a firm believer in and out of the
[42:23] mouth of two or three witnesses
[42:26] and as we sat down i texted danger and i
[42:28] said if it's okay i'd like to like say a
[42:30] testimony before before he came out and
[42:32] started
[42:33] and i just want to say brother shannon
[42:35] that that was an awesome testimony and
[42:37] at first if there's a true light just
[42:39] look at just take a look at brother
[42:41] shannon
[42:42] and he is a true light to this message
[42:46] and
[42:47] you know i wear this i wear this pen
[42:50] um for many reasons you know brother ron
[42:53] gave it to me and
[42:54] uh
[42:55] you know it's it's very special to me
[42:59] because the night before his brain
[43:00] surgery
[43:01] and i've told this testimony many times
[43:05] i just pray i can get through it so you
[43:06] guys can understand it without me crying
[43:09] but
[43:11] there was a pool in my heart
[43:13] to go and to go and speak with brother
[43:15] ron
[43:17] and i'm saying this testimony again
[43:18] because maybe there's somebody on the
[43:20] fence maybe there's somebody that
[43:21] doesn't certainly understand which way
[43:22] to go and i'm just here to tell you that
[43:24] if you take god at his word he's going
[43:27] to open doors that you don't even know
[43:28] that you can that you can walk through
[43:32] and i went and stood there before
[43:33] brother ron and i i opened my heart to
[43:35] him and i said you know i've
[43:37] i've done things and i've lived a life
[43:39] that i know i shouldn't be living
[43:41] and a lot of you probably gonna
[43:44] ask sarah to come up and get prayer
[43:45] after i get done because
[43:47] you don't know what she got into but she
[43:48] knows
[43:50] and
[43:51] i told him i said you know i'm tired of
[43:53] running from it i'm tired of running i'm
[43:54] ready to come home
[43:57] and you know
[43:59] there's a reason brother ron's going
[44:01] through this
[44:01] going through this trial
[44:03] and i'm a firm believer in that because
[44:05] i'm a testament of that
[44:06] because ever since that time
[44:09] you know but
[44:10] that week
[44:11] and i was i was actually just to go
[44:13] through what i what god's opened the
[44:15] door um since that time
[44:19] you know for a long time it was hard for
[44:20] me to actually give my full testimony
[44:22] and i've only i've only gave a couple of
[44:24] people the testimony because
[44:26] to be honest it's been it's embarrassing
[44:28] to know exactly where i was at
[44:31] and
[44:32] one night after service
[44:34] but the ron came down to me and he said
[44:36] you don't have to worry about the rest
[44:37] of it
[44:38] you're going to be there
[44:40] he said don't worry about the past
[44:45] well i was working the same job
[44:48] making the same money having to pay the
[44:50] same bills
[44:52] but i was living in a place
[44:55] that when i would go to work
[44:58] i would get up
[45:02] and i would be
[45:03] dusting concrete dust off of my pants
[45:05] just to go
[45:07] as my dad put it
[45:09] i was living in a dungeon
[45:12] and many people they may look at me and
[45:14] say you know
[45:17] you're starting to live this way because
[45:18] it's your uncle
[45:20] well believe it or not when he went
[45:21] through the fire he was still my uncle
[45:24] and believe it or not i was still
[45:25] leaving
[45:26] his his services when he would come and
[45:28] preach meetings i was still leaving him
[45:30] early
[45:31] to go do things of the world and go to
[45:32] parties and do things that
[45:34] that i thought was going to make me a
[45:35] popular and make me a better man
[45:39] so
[45:39] to say that you know he's my uncle this
[45:41] is only reason i want to live this life
[45:43] is you know absurd to me
[45:45] but
[45:46] god has used this trial to bring me
[45:48] closer to him
[45:50] as soon as i made that
[45:53] decision i didn't know what to do i
[45:55] didn't know where to go
[45:56] and he told me he said just you know we
[45:58] can get you a job up here you know you
[46:00] work with harrisonburg you can do um
[46:01] what you need to do and i said well let
[46:03] me just try and put a transfer letter in
[46:05] you know they can transfer me up here um
[46:07] and i'll find a place to stay and we'll
[46:09] figure something out
[46:11] and
[46:12] in two weeks they had me transferred up
[46:14] here
[46:15] and they had me transferred up here and
[46:16] in two weeks i had to find a house well
[46:18] the housing market was already getting
[46:19] crazy i couldn't i didn't know what i
[46:21] was going to do about a house
[46:23] and then one day a house opened up and i
[46:25] was moving i was supposed to transfer up
[46:27] here in a week
[46:29] and i called my realtor and i said hey
[46:30] call that house that's a house we're
[46:32] gonna get we're gonna make a show and
[46:34] put an offer on it
[46:36] well we ended up not even being the high
[46:37] the highest bidder and they decided that
[46:39] they wanted to give me the house because
[46:42] they wanted me to come into there
[46:44] well since that time we have sarah came
[46:46] down and that's when we first started
[46:47] talking and
[46:49] she came down and she helped us fix it
[46:50] up and terry came down and helped me fix
[46:52] it up
[46:53] and we got it together well i still
[46:55] wasn't satisfied i told sarah i said
[46:57] we're too far too far out once we get
[46:59] married it's too far of a drive for you
[47:01] or too far from family so we've got to
[47:02] figure something out to get us to get us
[47:04] closer
[47:05] and
[47:06] um he said i'm going to have to transfer
[47:08] because i can't live up as far as
[47:10] grottos i can't do anything like that so
[47:12] i was praying about it praying about it
[47:14] and then
[47:15] back the last week in august
[47:19] policy changed with the state police to
[47:21] where we could live 45 minutes away well
[47:22] grotto's is 40 minutes away so i said
[47:24] well i don't have to transfer or just
[47:26] start looking for somewhere
[47:28] and
[47:29] so i went and i knocked on labor day
[47:33] i decided you know i'm just going to go
[47:34] knock on um
[47:36] a gentleman's door that he he has uh
[47:39] land right there beside uh
[47:41] terry and brenda
[47:43] i said you know if he he tells me to go
[47:45] on and they'll tell me to go on but i'm
[47:46] just going to ask if he wants to sell
[47:47] property
[47:48] i knocked on his door and he sat there
[47:50] he looked down and he said you want to
[47:52] look at survey
[47:54] and i'd already told terry i said i can
[47:55] only take it if he gives me for this
[47:56] certain price and everything was
[47:58] skyrocketing at the time we went in
[48:00] there and he gave he he gave me a price
[48:02] exactly what we were looking for
[48:04] and then in that same that same week
[48:07] me and sarah we started looking at at
[48:08] plans and
[48:10] uh we said you know we'll just see if we
[48:11] got somebody that we can put a house
[48:13] together for a good price when that same
[48:16] week we found a
[48:17] contractor that they were ready to move
[48:19] and they they were ready to go for it so
[48:20] i said well we'll have to find see if we
[48:22] can sell the house
[48:24] well we go to get married
[48:26] and our house sold the day of our
[48:28] wedding
[48:29] and we laughed and we said you know i
[48:30] guess we're coming home homeless
[48:32] and
[48:33] so
[48:35] so uh and all of this has just came
[48:37] together so perfectly and uh so the
[48:39] house sold and everything's lining up
[48:40] and they were fine with us going uh to
[48:42] do that
[48:44] but you know i still wasn't satisfied
[48:46] and it goes back to that job situation
[48:48] you know i wasn't satisfied i was
[48:50] i couldn't be in church every i couldn't
[48:52] be in church every weekend and if you
[48:54] asked me what i was doing in two weeks i
[48:55] couldn't tell you i was probably gonna
[48:56] be at work because it was rotating
[48:58] schedule and then there was one service
[49:01] and
[49:02] you know i just in the middle of service
[49:04] andrew was preaching and i bowed my head
[49:05] and i said lord i don't care what it is
[49:07] i don't care what i'm doing whether it's
[49:09] with the state police whether it's doing
[49:11] whatever it is i want a job to open up
[49:13] that
[49:14] you know i can be in service every
[49:16] weekend because at the end of the day
[49:17] the job i don't care what comes with it
[49:19] it's just going to put food on the table
[49:21] it's going to put a roof over the head i
[49:22] you know main thing is trying to be in
[49:24] church
[49:25] as soon as i finish
[49:27] saying that prayer request or
[49:29] praying right there
[49:31] andrew stepped to the right side of the
[49:32] the pulpit and he looked right at me and
[49:35] pointed at me and said i'm gonna bless
[49:36] you and he i don't even know if he
[49:37] realized what he had done but god had
[49:39] just anointed him and told him that he
[49:41] was gonna bless me
[49:43] well the week before our wedding a job
[49:46] came open
[49:47] as a job that when i took i said i'd
[49:49] never take that job
[49:51] and
[49:52] then i started talking to the guys about
[49:54] it
[49:55] well i went ahead and i put in for that
[49:56] job and well i sit down with the captain
[49:59] of that division
[50:00] this week they gave me the job
[50:02] and
[50:03] he said it's unheard of to get this job
[50:06] at three years on he said it's never
[50:08] been done it's never been done at all
[50:10] and he said you know
[50:12] you don't have to worry about getting a
[50:13] phone call after five o'clock on friday
[50:15] he worked six to two
[50:17] and every answer to that prayer
[50:20] has been answered
[50:21] and here in the next next couple of
[50:23] weeks me and sarah we're going to be
[50:24] able to we're getting out of the house
[50:26] we're we're going to be able to have
[50:27] everything work out just as god has
[50:29] planned it to do and a lot of times you
[50:31] know it you may look at it and say it
[50:33] seems stressful and we're going to have
[50:34] storms we have storms that come across
[50:36] but when we have an acre
[50:38] there's no there's no storm that's going
[50:40] to blow us from our path
[50:42] and we've we've stood there and you know
[50:44] i
[50:44] we we've talked about it's like you know
[50:46] through all the changes all the changes
[50:48] that's going on as it has not been one
[50:50] one ounce of stress on us we're just
[50:51] taking it one step at a time and you
[50:54] know not only that going back to you
[50:55] talking about
[50:56] you praying for your son well when i got
[50:58] baptized
[50:59] i went back there and i said
[51:01] you know there's a still small voice
[51:03] that said malachi is going to be okay
[51:06] but
[51:06] my michael was sitting in it back here
[51:09] and i told i told andrew and i told ron
[51:12] i said there's one guy here that i want
[51:13] to pray for and i wasn't going to tell
[51:15] this testimony until he saw him walk in
[51:17] the doors
[51:18] and god has changed his life but i want
[51:20] to do this for you
[51:22] because
[51:23] i've had that prayer
[51:26] and
[51:27] here a couple weeks ago
[51:29] you know michael he's like i said he's
[51:31] bro he's not going to watch the service
[51:33] he might but but that's just where he's
[51:35] at right now but i know he's coming
[51:37] because i rece i received a word and a
[51:39] couple weeks ago brother andrew he
[51:41] i didn't know what he was doing but he
[51:42] called me up here and he said
[51:44] in in his statement
[51:46] he said what god gives he's not going to
[51:49] take away
[51:50] and he handed me
[51:52] a hundred dollar bill
[51:53] and i tried to give it back to him tried
[51:55] to give it back to him he wouldn't take
[51:57] it well i told sarah i said this hundred
[51:58] dollar bill is never gonna be spent
[52:00] because i'm gonna write that word on it
[52:02] and i'm gonna put it right in the bible
[52:03] right where it lays well that next day
[52:06] that same promise that he gave me the
[52:08] night before he came down and spoke to
[52:10] brother ron
[52:11] and he gave me that promise and he he
[52:13] came down right before everybody was
[52:14] getting baptized and he came down and he
[52:17] said michael and alexis coming
[52:20] hello
[52:22] and you know it's just like that that's
[52:23] an eternal blessing
[52:25] that we could just lift our faith that
[52:26] if there's a loved one out there that
[52:28] we're praying for
[52:30] i know because i'm a testament but we're
[52:32] going to watch my brother come in the
[52:33] doors that you know he's not even living
[52:35] that way right now
[52:37] as we hand it to brother andrew i'm just
[52:39] believing that this morning god can move
[52:41] move on situations that that we don't
[52:43] even know he can move on the doors that
[52:45] will open that we don't even know will
[52:46] open
[52:47] and i just thank you for for giving me
[52:49] this time to
[52:51] have that testimony
[52:52] [Applause]
[52:59] what's your mouth in this morning what's
[53:01] your trial
[53:03] we set those wings on the winds of faith
[53:05] i tell you when we just lay our trust in
[53:07] god
[53:08] because i didn't speak well ago i forgot
[53:10] it was so much but you know when i went
[53:12] for that job i didn't know it was cnw
[53:14] until i got there and they called roll
[53:16] call that morning
[53:18] and they said you're here for the cnw i
[53:19] said yes sir i am.
[53:24] when i knew god if when god then said i
[53:27] was going to have that job and knew he
[53:28] wasn't giving me the one that was going
[53:29] to take me from here and that's what i
[53:30] laid on

[1:01:18] maybe as they played that let's just
[1:01:20] let's just turn to luke chapter two this
[1:01:22] morning
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:44] i know we take time to read over these
[1:01:46] scriptures at christmas time
[1:01:49] but laying here
[1:01:50] is one of the greatest
[1:01:53] scenes that's ever been seen
[1:01:55] let's read it together this morning
[1:01:57] and it came to pass in those days that
[1:01:59] there went out a decree from caesar
[1:02:02] augustus
[1:02:03] that all the world should be taxed
[1:02:05] and this taxing was first made by
[1:02:07] cerrinius
[1:02:09] when cyrenius was governor over syria
[1:02:12] and all went to be taxed every one into
[1:02:15] his own city
[1:02:17] and joseph also went up from galilee out
[1:02:20] of the city of nazareth
[1:02:21] into judea
[1:02:23] under the city of david which is called
[1:02:25] bethlehem
[1:02:26] because he was of the house and lineage
[1:02:28] of david
[1:02:30] to be taxed with mary is a spouse wife
[1:02:33] being great with child
[1:02:35] and so it was that while they were there
[1:02:37] the days were accomplished that she
[1:02:40] should be delivered
[1:02:41] as she brought forth her first born son
[1:02:44] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes
[1:02:46] and laid him in a manger
[1:02:48] because there was no room for them in
[1:02:50] the end
[1:02:51] and there were in that same country
[1:02:53] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[1:02:55] watch over their flock by night
[1:02:57] and lo the angel the lord came upon them
[1:03:00] and the glory of the lord shone round
[1:03:02] about them
[1:03:04] and they were sore afraid
[1:03:06] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:03:09] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[1:03:11] great joy which shall be to all people
[1:03:14] for unto you is born this day in the
[1:03:16] city of david a savior
[1:03:19] which is
[1:03:20] christ the lord
[1:03:22] and this shall be a sign unto you
[1:03:25] that you shall find the babe wrapped in
[1:03:27] swaddling clothes lying in a manger
[1:03:30] and suddenly there was with an angel the
[1:03:33] angel a multitude of heavenly hosts
[1:03:35] praising god and saying
[1:03:37] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[1:03:40] peace good will towards men
[1:03:43] and it came to pass that as the angels
[1:03:45] were gone away from them into heaven
[1:03:49] the shepherd said one to another let us
[1:03:51] now go even unto bethlehem and see this
[1:03:53] thing which has come to pass
[1:03:56] which the lord hath made known unto us
[1:03:59] and they came with haste and found mary
[1:04:01] and joseph and the babe line in a manger
[1:04:04] and when they had seen it they made
[1:04:06] known abroad the same which was told
[1:04:08] them concerning this child
[1:04:11] and all they that heard it wandered at
[1:04:14] those things
[1:04:17] they wondered at those things
[1:04:20] what a wonderment our jesus christ is
[1:04:24] they were wandered at those things which
[1:04:27] were told them by the shepherds
[1:04:30] but mary kept all those things and
[1:04:32] pondered them in her heart
[1:04:34] and the shepherds returned glorifying
[1:04:37] and praising god
[1:04:39] for all the things
[1:04:40] that they had heard and seen as it was
[1:04:43] told unto them
[1:04:44] how many he has a need this morning that
[1:04:46] you'd like to make known unto the lord
[1:04:48] amen especially want to be remembering
[1:04:50] sister janetta's family in prayer this
[1:04:52] morning let's just go to the author of
[1:04:54] life
[1:04:55] father we approach your throne of mercy
[1:04:58] mercy and grace just before we
[1:05:01] dive into the word of god this morning
[1:05:04] lord we invite you to come and take
[1:05:06] complete preeminence in this service
[1:05:09] lord as we are nearing into this
[1:05:10] christmas week
[1:05:12] father we know that without the first
[1:05:14] christmas there would be no christmas
[1:05:16] today
[1:05:17] and father i know that the current world
[1:05:20] that we are living in has changed and
[1:05:22] shook up some things
[1:05:25] but there's one thing that remains the
[1:05:26] same in that as you
[1:05:28] and father i pray that you would bless
[1:05:30] your children you see their hands you
[1:05:32] see their needs

[1:05:39] as we take the word of life today may
[1:05:41] you just come and be the discerner of
[1:05:43] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:05:45] heart may you move us out of this out of
[1:05:47] the way and set us down in a corner as
[1:05:49] it were

[1:05:52] children today
[1:05:54] we love and appreciate you and we bless
[1:05:56] your holy name amen
[1:05:58] amen god bless you this morning you may
[1:06:01] you may be seated
[1:06:05] also if you could turn with me over into
[1:06:07] colossians
[1:06:09] chapter 1
[1:06:11] verse 16
[1:06:14] this morning i'd like to speak to you
[1:06:16] on a thought
[1:06:18] on out of these shall come a ruler
[1:06:21] out of these shall come a ruler
[1:06:24] colossians 1 6 tells us that that for by
[1:06:27] him were all things created
[1:06:29] that are in heaven and that are in earth
[1:06:31] visible and invisible
[1:06:34] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[1:06:36] principalities or powers
[1:06:38] all things were created by him and for
[1:06:41] him
[1:06:42] and he is before all things and by him
[1:06:45] all things consist
[1:06:47] and he is the head of the body the
[1:06:49] church who is the beginning
[1:06:51] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:06:53] things he might have
[1:06:55] the preeminence
[1:06:57] and we we know that as we've just read
[1:06:59] over this this chapter in the book of
[1:07:01] luke here and we realize that there are
[1:07:04] so many prophecies that are packed here
[1:07:06] in this one segment of scripture that we
[1:07:08] take time to read of and but we realize
[1:07:11] that all of the all of these prophecies
[1:07:14] that are laying there you could go back
[1:07:15] and you could take you could go back and
[1:07:17] take each scripture and you could look
[1:07:19] into the scriptures and you could see
[1:07:21] how that god at laced throughout the old
[1:07:24] testament the oncoming messiah that was
[1:07:27] coming to the generation of 2000 years
[1:07:30] ago
[1:07:31] and you could look at it and you could
[1:07:32] you could maybe look at it and you could
[1:07:34] see it and maybe it would be like it
[1:07:36] would be like a it would be like a clock
[1:07:38] and on the inside of that clock there's
[1:07:40] all kinds of little mechanisms that are
[1:07:43] that are working everything but it's all
[1:07:45] one main source that's making it work or
[1:07:48] maybe you could maybe you could take a
[1:07:49] shotgun and you could shoot it at a
[1:07:51] piece of paper and you could see how
[1:07:53] that how that it was scattered how that
[1:07:55] that little those beads would be shot
[1:07:57] into a different place and you could see
[1:07:59] how that how that it was scattered but
[1:08:00] you realize that it came from one source
[1:08:04] and you look back into the old testament
[1:08:06] and i absolutely love going through the
[1:08:08] old testament and finding those old
[1:08:10] prophecies that are laying there those
[1:08:12] those hidden gems that are laying there
[1:08:14] but if you could go back and just in
[1:08:16] your mind just for a moment and you
[1:08:18] begin to conceive in your mind about the
[1:08:21] about the ages of god and how that god
[1:08:23] rolled down throughout the ages and you
[1:08:25] can begin to think back as far as
[1:08:27] humanity and science can begin to think
[1:08:30] back how far and when the beginning was
[1:08:33] and you can go back way before you can
[1:08:35] think of and god was already there and
[1:08:38] you can hear a prophet when he would say
[1:08:40] when he said i see him when he rolled
[1:08:41] those little clinkers off of his hand he
[1:08:44] he he rolled he spoke it into existence
[1:08:46] and he rode the stars and the moon and
[1:08:49] the sun right off and you recognize
[1:08:51] really quick that you'll see that the
[1:08:54] author of life was holding all of these
[1:08:56] promises that are laying there we know
[1:08:58] that that before it could be a word it
[1:09:00] had to be a thought and when you're
[1:09:02] looking at all of those prophecies
[1:09:04] you're looking and you're seeing that
[1:09:06] there is an author over top of life and
[1:09:09] you can see when it begins to speak into
[1:09:11] existence in the very beginning that god
[1:09:14] is that you are in the evidence in the
[1:09:17] beginning so way back before you can
[1:09:19] ever think of god was already there god
[1:09:22] is the god of all things and so when we
[1:09:25] begin to trace back and look and lace
[1:09:28] back all of the prophecies that are
[1:09:29] laying there throughout the old
[1:09:31] testament you can source it back and it
[1:09:33] come from one source you can look at all
[1:09:36] those mechanisms in there but they're
[1:09:38] working for one time for one purpose is
[1:09:41] to keep that time and we realize that
[1:09:43] it's the little things that hold the big
[1:09:46] things together you and i could not be
[1:09:48] here without him this morning but he is
[1:09:51] counting on each and every one of you to
[1:09:53] hold your place to hold your position to
[1:09:56] stay right in line because every single
[1:09:58] one of you are in a spot and in a
[1:10:01] position to bring about a promise in
[1:10:03] this hour and we realize that it's not
[1:10:06] man that is doing all of these things
[1:10:08] when you look back when you look in the
[1:10:09] old testament and you can see daniel
[1:10:11] when he would prophesy about the messiah
[1:10:13] when you could see isaiah it was not man
[1:10:16] that was doing it but the bible tells us
[1:10:18] that men of old were moved by the holy
[1:10:21] ghost when they were inspired so we
[1:10:23] realized it's not man that is making
[1:10:25] this work but it's the holy spirit
[1:10:28] that's working in the great economy of
[1:10:30] god that's moving all of these small
[1:10:32] pieces and building a picture and
[1:10:34] building a drama so so if you could take
[1:10:37] just one scripture and you could lace it
[1:10:40] there and you can look back in zechariah
[1:10:42] you can look about the evening light you
[1:10:44] can look back in isaiah that that we
[1:10:46] will be there with our offspring but all
[1:10:48] of those things are pointing to one
[1:10:50] thing and that is our messiah and all of
[1:10:53] these things are lacing together if you
[1:10:54] look at a puzzle this morning you can
[1:10:56] look and you've got to make sure
[1:10:58] everything's lining out but notice the
[1:11:00] one that's helping you put your life
[1:11:02] together is the designer of it all
[1:11:06] notice what the bible says in zechariah
[1:11:08] 4.
[1:11:11] that then he answered and spake unto me
[1:11:13] this
[1:11:14] this is the word
[1:11:16] this is the word of the lord unto
[1:11:19] zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[1:11:21] power but by my spirit saith the lord of
[1:11:24] hosts who art thou o great mountain
[1:11:26] before zerubbabel thou shalt become a
[1:11:28] plain and he shall bring forth the
[1:11:30] headstone thereof with shouting's crying
[1:11:33] grace grace unto it and moreover
[1:11:36] the word of the lord came unto me saying
[1:11:39] the hands of zerubbabel have laid the
[1:11:41] foundations of this house his hands has
[1:11:44] his hands shall also finish it and they
[1:11:47] shall they shall know that the lord of
[1:11:50] hosts
[1:11:51] capital l o r d the lord of hosts has
[1:11:54] sent me unto you for who hath despised
[1:11:58] the day of small things for they shall
[1:12:00] rejoice and shall see the plummet in the
[1:12:02] hand of zerubbabel with those with those
[1:12:05] seven and the eyes of the lord which run
[1:12:08] to and fro throughout all the earth so
[1:12:11] we look and you look in this scripture
[1:12:12] and you see that the angel that was
[1:12:14] speaking to zechariah was as much as
[1:12:16] saying this that what you see means that
[1:12:19] the church of the living god cannot do
[1:12:22] anything or accomplish anything by its
[1:12:24] own might or by its own power but it's
[1:12:27] got to be done by the holy ghost it's
[1:12:30] not you and i that are putting this
[1:12:32] together it's not brother shannon or
[1:12:34] brother gabriel's testimony that's
[1:12:36] lacing this
[1:12:37] that's lacing this ministry this morning
[1:12:39] but each and every one of them are tying
[1:12:41] together and somebody will get blessed
[1:12:43] out of it and somebody will be a touch
[1:12:45] buy out of it maybe one scripture maybe
[1:12:48] one life maybe somebody looking at your
[1:12:50] life walking through walmart they'll
[1:12:52] watch that testimony that you're living
[1:12:55] never said a word but almighty god has
[1:12:57] been working throughout your life
[1:12:59] because out of you shall come a rule
[1:13:02] you're not going to make yourself a
[1:13:03] ruler but out of your very bowels out of
[1:13:06] your soul it's going to come a rule like
[1:13:08] you're going to rule over top of
[1:13:10] laodicea you'll rule over top of cancer
[1:13:13] you'll rule over top of depression your
[1:13:15] depression will not rule you death will
[1:13:18] not rule you but you are placed here in
[1:13:20] this hour of the laodicean church age
[1:13:23] not to be a whip and not to be a
[1:13:25] survivor but to be an overcomer in this
[1:13:28] hour but out of thee out of thy bellies
[1:13:32] shall come and live in water and right
[1:13:34] out of you in this hour god is bringing
[1:13:37] about a body that will do the same works
[1:13:40] that jesus did
[1:13:42] but notice what what was spoken about
[1:13:45] the city
[1:13:46] about the city bethlehem the bible also
[1:13:48] says in in psalms 87 and 3 that glorious
[1:13:52] things
[1:13:53] are spoken of the old city of god salah
[1:13:55] notice in micah 5 and 2
[1:13:58] but thou bethlehem ephrata though thou
[1:14:01] be little among the thousands of judah
[1:14:04] yet out of these shall he
[1:14:06] say he
[1:14:08] come forth unto me that is to be the
[1:14:10] ruler in israel whose goings forth have
[1:14:13] been from old and from everlasting to
[1:14:16] begin to think and just reflect over
[1:14:18] this one this one powerful scripture
[1:14:21] that was laying there in the old
[1:14:22] testament and you begin to think about
[1:14:24] the true eternity of god that the
[1:14:27] eternity of god is boundless it's all
[1:14:29] existing it it's all at once to the
[1:14:31] duration it's a duration without
[1:14:34] beginning and without end and without
[1:14:36] change and notice when you look at that
[1:14:38] word translated in in the very latter
[1:14:41] part of micah 5 and 2 it means that word
[1:14:45] there from of old and you go to studying
[1:14:48] out the greek lexicon from old it is
[1:14:50] also used of the eternity of god in
[1:14:53] habit chapter 1 and verse 12 that he is
[1:14:56] the god of before so we realize that the
[1:15:00] title this is a title that is chosen to
[1:15:02] express that he is before all things
[1:15:05] which he had made so we could say that
[1:15:08] god is the dweller of a for he is the
[1:15:11] dweller of before time so let me put it
[1:15:14] into your mind just to just to
[1:15:15] illuminate your illumination or your
[1:15:17] imagination this morning that god is so
[1:15:20] big that that devil can't even touch him
[1:15:23] that god is so great that humanity can
[1:15:26] never build anything that can outgrow
[1:15:29] our god but yet our god is so big but he
[1:15:32] becomes so humble that he wanted to come
[1:15:35] into a baby and live and live in a
[1:15:38] little baby to feel like a little baby
[1:15:40] to understand like humanity to
[1:15:43] understand like a mother that maybe have
[1:15:45] a little child that maybe they have an
[1:15:47] upset stomach he wants to understand
[1:15:49] like a child
[1:15:51] he wants to understand like what it's
[1:15:53] like to be a two-year-old child and and
[1:15:55] wise men come from afar and bring him
[1:15:58] gifts he wants to understand like a 12
[1:16:00] year old man that could stand there and
[1:16:02] make and he could thwart the minds of
[1:16:04] the theologians of the day he wants to
[1:16:06] understand what it's like to get a
[1:16:08] headache
[1:16:10] he wants to understand so god is so big
[1:16:12] but yet he can become so small that's
[1:16:16] what makes him god to me is that he
[1:16:18] wants to feel like humanity
[1:16:22] but notice out of these shall come forth
[1:16:25] to me a ruler
[1:16:27] in israel notice when joe when judah was
[1:16:30] setting up that that bethlehem was a
[1:16:33] part of the thousands of judah
[1:16:35] notice judo uh bethlehem was so small
[1:16:39] that they had no political power
[1:16:41] whatsoever
[1:16:42] she was so small that she was so
[1:16:44] insignificant and that it was so small
[1:16:47] that that not that not anybody was
[1:16:50] rarely known out of this one city but
[1:16:53] out of that one city would come a ruler
[1:16:57] would come a ruler that would rule over
[1:16:59] top of that generation and the
[1:17:01] generations before and the generations
[1:17:04] afterwards so let me put it to you like
[1:17:06] this out of a 16 year old girl
[1:17:10] out of a 16 year old girl would come
[1:17:13] would come and rule or would come the
[1:17:15] author of almighty life but how is this
[1:17:17] going to happen the holy spirit will all
[1:17:20] will overshadow you
[1:17:22] the holy spirit will overshadow you and
[1:17:25] the power of the most high will come out
[1:17:27] of you the heart that thing that will be
[1:17:29] born of you will be a holy one and he
[1:17:32] shall save his people from their sins
[1:17:37] and you think god can't use you
[1:17:40] you think god doesn't care about you and
[1:17:42] where you're at and where you're living
[1:17:43] at it what the obstacles that you're
[1:17:45] facing about if he can use a 16 year old
[1:17:48] girl
[1:17:49] if he can use a girl that that's been
[1:17:51] made rumors about throughout 2 000 years
[1:17:54] that she had an affair with a soldier if
[1:17:57] he can use a 16 year old girl that
[1:18:00] people made fun of her all of her life
[1:18:02] they called her all kinds of names they
[1:18:04] called her son an illegitimate son
[1:18:08] if he can use a 16 year old girl what
[1:18:10] can he do with your life
[1:18:12] are you with me mary is the only one
[1:18:14] throughout the whole entire bible that
[1:18:16] could say that she got jesus twice one
[1:18:19] time in the belly on the other time is
[1:18:21] on this hole and notice when she got him
[1:18:25] on the soul where was she at
[1:18:27] she was in the upper room and if mary
[1:18:30] had to go to the upper room so do you
[1:18:32] have to go to the upper room that ruler
[1:18:34] won't come there unless you invite him
[1:18:37] to come in there
[1:18:42] out of this little city well i'm just
[1:18:45] i'm too insignificant
[1:18:48] he bypassed all the theologians
[1:18:50] he bypassed herod's house he bypassed
[1:18:53] caiaphas house and he came to humble
[1:18:56] little shepherds
[1:18:57] that come day come to humble little
[1:18:59] shepherds
[1:19:00] that were that were unlearned
[1:19:03] they were unintelligent didn't know how
[1:19:05] to write their own name but they come to
[1:19:07] a little city that was insignificant
[1:19:11] didn't have didn't have no power to it
[1:19:13] but out of that little city
[1:19:16] out of that little city would come forth
[1:19:18] a child
[1:19:19] and all of those all of those prophecies
[1:19:21] and all those wise men knew that there
[1:19:24] was something that was laying there when
[1:19:26] herod began to ask where is he going to
[1:19:29] be born at they told him that there's a
[1:19:31] prophecy that is laying there in micah
[1:19:34] chapter 5 and it said out of bethlehem
[1:19:37] and notice what was laying there that
[1:19:40] herod was trying to kill every child
[1:19:43] from two years old and on
[1:19:45] and younger so he's trying to get to the
[1:19:48] little child that was so insignificant
[1:19:52] well i
[1:19:53] my child my this baby's life is
[1:19:56] insignificant oh really
[1:19:59] what if abortion laws were in play right
[1:20:02] there
[1:20:04] you see what the enemy was trying to do
[1:20:07] he was trying to stop the life of
[1:20:09] almighty god from getting to you
[1:20:12] he wasn't just trying to stop it 2000
[1:20:15] years ago he wasn't just trying to stop
[1:20:17] a ruler from coming on the scene and
[1:20:19] living in bethlehem and living in
[1:20:21] jerusalem and walking on the shores of
[1:20:23] galilee and healing the left person and
[1:20:25] healing the blind and healing those that
[1:20:27] were lost he was coming he was trying to
[1:20:30] stop the ruler from coming to you and
[1:20:33] offering you almighty god
[1:20:38] but out of this city
[1:20:40] bethlehem which means the house
[1:20:43] of god's
[1:20:44] bread it's insignificant oh really
[1:20:48] who is the one that feeds you daily
[1:20:51] who is the one that says i am the bread
[1:20:53] of life
[1:20:54] but you think well i'm my part or my
[1:20:57] past is too heavy the things that i've
[1:20:59] been through through spirituality and
[1:21:02] through religiousity
[1:21:04] and throughout my own humanity it's too
[1:21:06] much let me ask you was it too much for
[1:21:09] rahab
[1:21:11] when rahab was the one that founded
[1:21:13] bethlehem and you think god ain't
[1:21:15] wanting to set up something on your life
[1:21:18] but rahab was the one you think about a
[1:21:21] paradox that rahab truly is that rahab
[1:21:24] was the one that set up bethlehem
[1:21:29] and you're a complete paradox that god
[1:21:31] wants to set up his bethlehem in your
[1:21:33] life
[1:21:34] and you you think about the paradox that
[1:21:36] that's happening there in jericho
[1:21:39] and here she's got two spies that are
[1:21:41] hiding in her house
[1:21:42] hiding underneath the flats hiding from
[1:21:45] it from the men of jericho and her
[1:21:47] testimony is we're afraid of you
[1:21:53] we're afraid of you and you're up there
[1:21:54] hiding
[1:21:59] what a paradox
[1:22:01] what's god doing
[1:22:03] he's after his seat
[1:22:05] he's after his lineage because out of
[1:22:07] rahab she's noted as as one in the
[1:22:10] lineage of your lord and your savior
[1:22:13] jesus christ her her story may have been
[1:22:16] insignificant to the men that she had
[1:22:18] been with but it was not insignificant
[1:22:20] to almighty god because he had a plan
[1:22:23] that out of bethlehem would come a ruler
[1:22:26] if you stop
[1:22:28] if you stop rahab you stuck the city
[1:22:33] if you stop this bride you stop the city
[1:22:36] from coming to pass if you stop this
[1:22:38] bride you stop almighty god from setting
[1:22:41] up a city in john chapter 14 behold i
[1:22:45] have gone to prepare a mansion for you
[1:22:48] if you stop ernest meadows if you stop
[1:22:51] gabriel spencer if you stop the fraser
[1:22:54] family you are stopping us from our city
[1:23:00] somebody give the lord a hand clap a
[1:23:01] priest
[1:23:03] [Applause]
[1:23:06] but whoever despised the day of small
[1:23:08] things notice the world is after great
[1:23:10] things
[1:23:11] they're after the greatest present right
[1:23:13] now
[1:23:14] russian and busy and about whether what
[1:23:16] i'm going to get this one or this one
[1:23:17] bought something for me so now i gotta
[1:23:19] go now i gotta go get something for them
[1:23:22] don't make christmas
[1:23:24] about outdoing somebody else
[1:23:26] make christmas what christmas truly is
[1:23:30] but the bible tells us that that that
[1:23:33] who hath despised the day of small
[1:23:34] things
[1:23:35] they're they're looking for the next big
[1:23:37] revival they're next they're looking for
[1:23:39] the next billy graham they're looking
[1:23:41] for the next healing campaign they're
[1:23:42] looking for great things and christ
[1:23:45] and christ to come riding on the clouds
[1:23:47] but they have missed him
[1:23:49] they have missed him in the coming uh in
[1:23:52] the return of his people they missed him
[1:23:55] in a still small voice they missed him
[1:23:57] in a kentucky preacher they missed him
[1:24:00] they missed him when he was there as a
[1:24:02] baby and a manger but shepherds didn't
[1:24:04] miss him
[1:24:06] why did he come to shepherds it's
[1:24:08] because shepherds were willing to go to
[1:24:11] the message of the angels
[1:24:13] you see if it had come to herod herod
[1:24:15] would have never went there if it had
[1:24:17] come to the theologians he'd never went
[1:24:19] there but god knows where to send his
[1:24:21] message to
[1:24:23] god knows who will receive it god knows
[1:24:25] what he'll do what did those shepherds
[1:24:27] do when the angel testified of the
[1:24:30] things that was happening the bible said
[1:24:32] they ran down there
[1:24:35] you ran to jesus that's what happened in
[1:24:38] your life
[1:24:39] there's a lot of people that never would
[1:24:41] have came there was a lot of people that
[1:24:42] said i'm not going to that pig pen i'm
[1:24:44] not going down there and ain't nothing
[1:24:46] but a bunch of moly grubs and there's a
[1:24:48] lot of people that's a backwash god
[1:24:50] thought more of you than a backwash of
[1:24:52] christianity god thought that you were
[1:24:54] so great that he slipped on the wedding
[1:24:56] brand of a wedding band of a
[1:24:58] predestinated grace on your life
[1:25:01] he thought something of you
[1:25:06] they missed him in a manger
[1:25:09] they missed him in a 12 year old boy
[1:25:11] they missed him in a 30 year old man
[1:25:14] that said before abraham was i am
[1:25:17] they missed him when he fed the 5 000.
[1:25:19] they missed him when he raised the dead
[1:25:22] they missed him when he was hanging on a
[1:25:23] cross they missed him in paul they
[1:25:26] missed him in irenaeus they missed him
[1:25:28] in luther they missed him in wesley they
[1:25:31] missed him in william branham they
[1:25:33] missed him in uni today they're looking
[1:25:36] for a messiah that would come to their
[1:25:38] ranks and come to their denominations
[1:25:40] and they miss the very author of life
[1:25:48] but god
[1:25:49] so chose
[1:25:51] your 16 elements
[1:25:58] when i hear a man
[1:26:00] i hear a man by the name of denny vance
[1:26:03] a lot of people would
[1:26:05] rode
[1:26:06] off jesus
[1:26:09] would you just come to spend the evening
[1:26:11] with us
[1:26:13] you think about
[1:26:15] that's christmas
[1:26:17] that's christmas every day
[1:26:19] is when jesus
[1:26:21] comes and spends
[1:26:22] your present day with you
[1:26:25] every one of you should have been rolled
[1:26:27] off by the ranks
[1:26:29] of the world
[1:26:30] nathaniel holmes should have never been
[1:26:32] sitting in a service like this
[1:26:35] michael buchanan should have never been
[1:26:37] sitting in a service like this where you

[1:27:23] normal
[1:27:24] if you've got the baptism of the spirit
[1:27:27] your life is not insignificant you're
[1:27:30] not a nobody you're a somebody if mary
[1:27:33] was overlooked you'll be overlooked but
[1:27:36] you're not overlooked by god
[1:27:38] god has got his eyes on you he's got his
[1:27:41] eyes on your circumstance he's got his
[1:27:43] eyes on your problems
[1:27:46] hallelujah
[1:27:48] because out of you has got to come
[1:27:49] something

[1:27:53] ruling the day and ruling over your
[1:27:55] problems and ruling over your
[1:27:57] circumstances i'm nobody moses all he
[1:28:00] had was a staff
[1:28:02] david all he had was a sling sampson all
[1:28:05] he had was a jawbone rory had all she
[1:28:08] had was a string only jesus jesus only
[1:28:11] had a whip mary only had some anointment
[1:28:14] aaron only had a rod dork has only had a
[1:28:17] needle but every single one of these
[1:28:19] things they might have been small but
[1:28:21] god used every single one of them
[1:28:25] it may have been insignificant to the
[1:28:27] rest of the world that he came to
[1:28:29] shepherds but he come to those that
[1:28:31] would receive a message
[1:28:33] notice
[1:28:34] they didn't care where this messiah was
[1:28:37] laying at
[1:28:39] he was in their own
[1:28:41] environment
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:46] he was in their own environment you know
[1:28:48] where you can find them at you know your
[1:28:51] environment you know what you're
[1:28:53] comfortable too you're comfortable to
[1:28:55] this kind of preaching you're
[1:28:56] comfortable to this message you're
[1:28:58] comfortable to holiness and a standard
[1:29:01] of righteousness you're comfortable and
[1:29:03] he comes in that environment
[1:29:06] you're not like the rest of the world
[1:29:08] saying i'm not going down there with him
[1:29:09] then put your cry babies and get so
[1:29:11] worked up when the preacher gets to
[1:29:13] preaching that they got to feel like
[1:29:15] they got to give their heart all over to
[1:29:16] god again
[1:29:18] you don't mind crying because you ain't
[1:29:19] going to wipe your mascara off when you
[1:29:21] cry you ain't dressed up like the world
[1:29:24] you ain't acting like the world
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:32] it comes
[1:29:34] to your environment
[1:29:37] it comes where
[1:29:38] you know the message
[1:29:41] will be received
[1:29:43] where to be vindicated
[1:29:46] notice
[1:29:47] your life
[1:29:48] is the interpretation
[1:29:51] of this message
[1:29:54] your life is spelling out this message
[1:29:58] if i never heard another tape
[1:30:01] if i never if i never read another
[1:30:04] scripture
[1:30:05] and all i got to do was watch a little
[1:30:07] girl
[1:30:08] carly frazier
[1:30:10] i could see the message works
[1:30:13] i could look all over this build and i
[1:30:15] could look at the harveys i could look
[1:30:16] at the van says your life is an
[1:30:19] interpretation
[1:30:20] of the message
[1:30:22] and notice what the bible said in ii
[1:30:24] peter 1 19 that we have also a more sure
[1:30:27] word of prophecy where until you do well
[1:30:30] that you take heed as unto a light that
[1:30:32] shineth in a dark place until the day
[1:30:34] dawn and the daystar arise in your
[1:30:37] hearts knowing that the first knowing
[1:30:39] this verse that no prophecy of the
[1:30:42] scripture is of any private
[1:30:44] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:30:47] in old time by the will of man but holy
[1:30:50] men of god spake as they were moved
[1:30:54] by the holy ghost so it's god that's
[1:30:57] setting this up so when isaiah was
[1:30:59] speaking 800 years before mary got there
[1:31:05] god didn't have to explain it
[1:31:08] mary was the interpretation
[1:31:10] of the message
[1:31:12] and when the bible said that in the last
[1:31:14] days that i will pour out my spirit upon
[1:31:16] all flesh that your sons and your
[1:31:19] daughters shall prophesy your young your
[1:31:21] young daughters and your sons and
[1:31:22] daughters shall prophesy your young men
[1:31:24] shall see visions when it says in isaiah
[1:31:27] 28 and 18 when it says there that this
[1:31:30] is the refreshing of the lord that with
[1:31:32] a stammering lips and unknown tongues
[1:31:35] well i speak to this people and this is
[1:31:37] the rest
[1:31:39] you are the interpretation
[1:31:42] of the message he interprets it by
[1:31:44] bringing it to pass
[1:31:47] now all the prophets had told about it
[1:31:50] all the prophets were they had told
[1:31:51] about a star when when when uh balaam
[1:31:55] would get so anointed and we would come
[1:31:57] there with this final prophecy that out
[1:32:00] of jacob a star shall rise and a scepter
[1:32:03] shall rise out of israel
[1:32:06] god using
[1:32:08] a backslidden prophet
[1:32:11] using this man but those wise men were
[1:32:14] looking for it
[1:32:16] this door had passed over every
[1:32:18] observatory in every planetarium but
[1:32:21] there was only three that the bible
[1:32:23] testified that had seen it there's been
[1:32:26] a lot of things just like down there on
[1:32:28] the ohio river on the 17th when the 17th
[1:32:32] person was getting baptized and that
[1:32:34] star shown over top of that river and
[1:32:37] said ask john the baptist for run the
[1:32:40] first coming of christ so with a message
[1:32:42] of william branham forerunned the second
[1:32:44] coming of christ and the papers packed
[1:32:46] that a mysterious star was seen over top
[1:32:49] and just in this generation alone as the
[1:32:52] working wonderful power of the messiah
[1:32:55] been seen
[1:32:58] what is he doing
[1:33:00] he's bringing the interpretation of it
[1:33:02] all
[1:33:03] because there was people that were
[1:33:05] looking for there was wise men that were
[1:33:07] looking for him and wise men are still
[1:33:10] looking for him today
[1:33:12] they were looking for the person
[1:33:15] of the fulfillment
[1:33:17] now
[1:33:18] let me let me just say this that that
[1:33:21] satan knows that you're coming
[1:33:24] satan knows that there's going to be a
[1:33:26] people that's without spot without
[1:33:28] blemish
[1:33:32] he's looking for her
[1:33:34] he's looking for her
[1:33:36] and he's got his eyes
[1:33:38] on a people that's dressed right talk
[1:33:41] right living it out
[1:33:43] and he knows that it's coming to
[1:33:44] fulfillment that's why you're battling
[1:33:47] so hard
[1:33:48] that's why shading is satan is battling
[1:33:50] this message so hard it's because he
[1:33:53] knows that he's coming to the final
[1:33:56] chapters of the book
[1:33:58] his end isn't near but your future is
[1:34:02] clear
[1:34:04] your future's not a dungeon your
[1:34:07] future's not a seller your future's not
[1:34:09] hell your future is heaven
[1:34:16] because you've got a character
[1:34:18] that's fit to rule
[1:34:22] that god has so seen you
[1:34:24] he knows how you'll handle this message
[1:34:27] he knows what you're going to do with it
[1:34:30] power with character
[1:34:33] is fit to roar
[1:34:36] these wise men
[1:34:39] when they come to a two-year-old child
[1:34:42] they've seen the fulfillment of it
[1:34:45] that this is that which was spoken in
[1:34:47] numbers chapter 24 and 17 that the stars
[1:34:49] arise
[1:34:51] and they found it the shepherds found
[1:34:53] him when he was just a baby
[1:34:55] they found
[1:34:56] jesus's life was the interpretation of
[1:35:00] all the old testament and that prophecy
[1:35:03] that was laying there that something had
[1:35:05] been foretold and you could say that
[1:35:07] when the shepherds went there
[1:35:09] and that thing that had been spoken unto
[1:35:11] mary that this that this will be the
[1:35:14] things that will happen as it come out
[1:35:16] of the mouth of the angel gabriel and
[1:35:19] those shepherds come there
[1:35:21] and the angels begin to sing at his
[1:35:23] birth
[1:35:28] this day
[1:35:29] this scripture
[1:35:30] is fulfilled
[1:35:33] in your ears
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:39] you think about this little girl
[1:35:41] having a conversation
[1:35:45] with an angel that's about six foot tall
[1:35:50] dark complected
[1:35:52] she's walking down
[1:35:56] just going about her business and all of
[1:35:57] a sudden she sees a little
[1:35:59] flicker of light
[1:36:01] and out of that light steps this this
[1:36:03] being
[1:36:05] it says fear not mary
[1:36:06] i am sent from the presence of the most
[1:36:09] high god

[1:36:14] who was that back there in that cave
[1:36:16] who was that back there meal
[1:36:18] in me hotel who was that back there
[1:36:21] who was that that stepped out of that
[1:36:22] light when it come and said i'm here to
[1:36:24] tell you of your peculiar birth

[1:36:28] you about though that the world won't
[1:36:30] receive it

[1:36:33] take this message you'll take these
[1:36:35] signs and you'll pray for kings and
[1:36:37] you'll pray for potentates
[1:36:39] what was that
[1:36:41] it was a sign to a generation

[1:39:48] understand they got questions about the
[1:39:50] trinity they've been taught that
[1:39:52] i had a conversation with the
[1:39:54] trinitarian pastor
[1:39:56] and he spoke these words to me
[1:39:58] i thought man i'd never let the cat out
[1:40:00] of the bag if i believe something like
[1:40:01] this he said brother andrew he said we
[1:40:03] don't even know what we believe
[1:40:05] i thought my jesus how are you teaching
[1:40:07] people
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:10] how you teaching people about eternal
[1:40:11] life and you don't even know what you're
[1:40:12] teaching
[1:40:15] but when jesus stood there in matthew
[1:40:17] chapter 28 and he said all power
[1:40:20] in heaven and in earth is given unto me
[1:40:24] how could it be but jesus was deity
[1:40:27] himself and that same deity is one to
[1:40:31] dwell in humanity
[1:40:35] these he's not in heaven deities in the
[1:40:38] sons and daughters of god yes he's god
[1:40:40] on the throne but he's god in your life
[1:40:44] he's not wanting you to be rude
[1:40:46] he's not wanting you to be ruled by
[1:40:48] laodicea he's wanting you to rule they
[1:40:49] ought to see you

[1:41:03] you're facing things that i as a young
[1:41:05] person that that maybe i didn't face and
[1:41:08] we know that each generation gets 10
[1:41:09] times harder
[1:41:11] but out of view
[1:41:13] out of you that are facing laodicea when
[1:41:16] the hell is battling up against you over
[1:41:18] peer pressure and social media agendas
[1:41:21] over and over and over again

[1:41:27] somebody's going to be a ruler of that
[1:41:28] thing it's not going to whip them peer
[1:41:30] pressure is not going to whip them but
