offering you give as god's bless you and after you've given you can be seated real quick before i sing um i was speaking with brother ron and brother andrew earlier in the week and uh we're just talking about things we've been through in our lives and what's been going on i haven't told a lot of people here everything that we went through when my son was born little elijah when he was in the womb we went and had an ultrasound done doing the anatomy scan and they informed us at that time that they couldn't see the proper formation of his arm and his leg and they were quite concerned at that time they were not really giving us much information and as parents we were we were scared um we didn't really know what to think it was on a friday we went and talked to the doctors while we were there again still not a lot of hope so they said we wanted to schedule us to go to a bigger hospital and do a more thorough scan to determine what was going on but again they weren't telling us anything about his arm or his leg other than it wasn't developing right they said possible i can't remember the words they used but basically he wasn't growing properly and possibility of down syndrome things like that so we went we left the doctor's office we called a lot of people that we knew um i called my parents we called our pastor talked to them you know we just asked everybody to pray because we were we were scared in ourselves we there was nothing we could do other than pray and you know we all believe god can take care of things he can handle every situation that comes at him so sunday we had prayer at church on monday we went to the bigger hospital to have the scans done and they took us into the room and first the doctor told us she's like you know with these things going on we want to talk about possible termination and i looked at him and i said no i said that's that's not that's not where we are i say god can take care of this and you know she talked her whole thing and then we went to the room that brought us up on the big scans and the first picture that came up was his arm they said wasn't developing right i seen his hand i seen all his fingers seeing everything the next picture they turned them i seen his legs they said he will you know he's going to have club feet he's going to be dealing with all these things and they're like well you know we might be okay and i said no he's going to be fine you know god did this for us he showed us that he was going to be okay so we went through the whole pregnancy we had extra scans done all along they kept talking about this could happen that could happen and we just kept praying and believing that god was going to take control of everything when he was born he did have a club foot on one of his feet the doctor said you know he's going to be limited we'll have to put him in a cast we're going to have to put him on these shoes to wear for two years and then have to monitor it and all these other things and you know we took it but we knew god was going to take care of everything he i don't remember exactly how long they said he was going to have to wear the cast but it was less than half the time and they took him out of the cast they put him in these special shoes that had a bar in between them and he couldn't move his feet they want to strengthen his turn his foot and it was less than half the time again that they said okay he's going way ahead of schedule and i told him and i said that's just god he's taking care of everything yes we got to go through this battle but god's got everything and you know if we went to the next stage the next stage and they're like all right well we're gonna have to just wear it at night for the next few years well that only lasted a few months and then we went into the doctor they had him walk around his foot looks fine there's nothing wrong with him my boy is is happy he's healthy you know he he does all the sports he wants to do he's in karate it's just we give all the glory to god because he completely handled everything that we we at one point thought was impossible we were in that storm in that battle and all we did was pray and it was it was a test of our faith and you know we could have just we could have gave up but that's not what god said to do he said trust and believe and i'll be with you and he's been in his life and guided him and helped him though since he before he was born he's been dealing with elijah and helping him get through this and now he don't even remember except for now i told him again but you know he's just he's perfect there's nothing wrong with him i just want to tell everybody and put it out there you know even if the doctors say nothing can't be done god can handle everything in the eye of the storm you remain in control in the middle of the war you've got my soul when my sails are torn your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm when a solid ground is falling out from underneath my feet between the black skies and my red eyes i can barely see and when i i've been sold out by my friends and my family i can feel the rain reminding me that in the eye of the storm you remain in control and in the middle of the war you guard my soul are you alone on the anchor when my cells are torn love surrounds me in the eye of a storm and when my hopes and dreams are far from me and i'm running out of faith i see the future i picture it slowly fades away and when the tears are painted hearty they're pouring down my face i find my peace in jesus name in the eye of a storm you remain in control and in the middle of the war you guard my soul you alone are the anchor when my sails are torn and your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm when a test comes in and a doctor says you only got a few months left it's like a bitter pill that you're swallowing you can barely take a breath and when a sickness tries to take my baby away and there's nothing i can do but my only hope is to trust in you in the eye of the storm you remain in control [Music] your love surrounds me in the higher storm and the eye of the storm you remain in control in the middle of the war [Music] you guard my soul you alone are the anchor when my cells are torn your love surrounds me in the eye of a stone in the eye of the storm and you remain in control in the middle of the war you guard my soul you alone are my anchor when my sails are torn your love surrounds me in the eye of a storm [Applause] amen aren't you glad he's your anchor in that storm amen you can sing that song before you go through a storm but when you really go through it and you find that anchor and after the storm rages you know he's that eye in the storm for you amen good to be here this evening we're happy to

his feet i believe it'll be that same jesus that comes and meets your needs and not how many has a need that you'd like to take before the lord amen amen god sees each and every one of your hearts your desires to see now let's just go to the lord in prayer heavenly father we approach you lord jesus in the most holy name that there is the name of the lord jesus father we recognize that all power in heaven and earth is given unto us lord we recognize that it's all power is in your name father we stand here lord as the ransom we stand here as the redeemed father if it was not for our redeemer lord we would not know the perfection of this redemption father we're just thankful that we can lord one more time lord look unto you the author and the finisher of our faith father we're just asking lord that you'd move across this congregation lord as we've witnessed you move here time and time again but lord we have gathered one more time lord and the circumstances of life allow us to go through things and things are not always constant the real constant in life is that things are always changing lord we're knowing that when time ceases you will still remain when things pass away you are still the same father and lord even through all of the turmoil of this life we realize that you're here right now lord we invite you to come and take the pulpit just now lord we we give space father that you would come and work through the veil of humanity lord one more time lord lord as it were maybe just set us down in a corner lord as we yield our vessels to you father lord we don't want anybody glorified but you hear father lord i you see these hands lord jesus below them is a heart that has a desire that that only you can meet and father we're desiring as a church of the living god that we would see you high and lifted up resurrected right here manifesting yourself amongst the church of the living god we ask lord as we stand here father lord we take our possession as sons and daughters of god may we enforce the claim that we've been given and father may we push satan out of the way by the power of the word may you come in power and demonstration tonight and we'll be careful to serve you and give you all the glory and the honor and praise that is due unto your name and the bride said amen amen god bless you this evening if you have your bibles we'd like to look over in the book of hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5 and then down to romans chapter 8 verse 14. it's honored to be in the house of the lord once again amen amen we ask that you'd be praying for us this coming week as we'll be headed to ohio there at true word tabernacle the the uh camp meeting that they have the youth camp there at uh saint mary's camp and i know it's a youth camp and and i believe there's a few from the turks here that's going and and uh so we're just just asking that you'd be remembering us in prayer in those meetings that the that the lord would do special things and i sure would appreciate your prayers myself and brother timothy pruitt will be speaking that meeting again last last year some of the most supernatural events i i'd ever witnessed we witnessed right there and you know they they're they're asking us to come back and i'm i'm certainly privileged to go there and i certainly love brother ray and brother ray is just a real general and a real man of god and brother wayne lawson there and we're just uh we're just privileged to know these men of god and to to be a part of this wonderful message amen amen we trust you all had a wonderful week amen amen i believe i believe god's got something in store for us this evening you believe that before you see it or before you hear it you believe it amen i'd like to speak to you again i was thinking or looking at a different thought but the lord just brought us back to this thought on experiencing the liberty of the message and we'll just follow the leadership of the lord here so i believe i believe that if we're following him he'll never lead us into anything wrong amen amen so by the help of the lord we'd like to speak to you again on this song and experience and the liberty of the message hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice an offering thou what is not but a body a body thou hast prepared me amen romans chapter 8 and verse 14. for as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of god can you say that you are a son of god amen for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs and heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willing not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord we we've been going over this thought for the last few weekends i trust that you're enjoying that and and it's been a blessing unto you but we recognize that that webster webster said that liberty it is the freedom it is a freedom from restraint in a gentle in a general sense and applicable to the body it is a state of exemption from the control it is an exemption from the control of others and a man truly enjoys a liberty when there is no restraints or there is no physical force to operate upon his life to restrain him or to draw him back and i believe that is what god is desiring is a body that is without restraint and that's what paul would stand there in hebrews chapter 11 and he would lay out those heroes of faith and then it turns over into chapter 12 and he said let us lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us any of the things that would hold us back from truly giving our complete life over to jesus christ let us lay aside everything anything and everything that would hold us back from the power from the power of being released to the supernatural power of the holy ghost and that's what we desire in in each and every one of our lives no matter how far we've grown in the message or how far we've been here or how long we've been here i believe that every single person or every christian has a desire that they would completely lay aside everything and to to surrender their life unto him so that they can fully be used by the leadership of the lord in the areas of life that that he's destined for us to walk in i truly believe as sons and daughters of god that that we are to completely lay aside our abilities and completely lay aside every weight and completely lay aside all of our thoughts and what we think about life and how we think that we ought to go in life but we are to lay aside everything that would hold us back and and paul would go on to say let us run let us run within within us and you can't truly you can't truly run with this message if you're if you're holding on to the things of the world and and that's that's something that william branham the ministry of malachi 4. he would he would stand there and he would he would express to us especially in the later coming or the later years of the message he would stand there and he would place the emphasis of the dynamics uh in the body of jesus christ and he would stand there and he would he would preach right in front of those pentecostal men that would that would shut him down or or men that would be against him but he would stand there and he said you've got too much theology you've got all the mechanics on the theology but there's no dynamics to make it work and you can have all the letter but you don't have the spirit you you'll see it on it'll never work it'll never be indeed it'll never be exactly what god destined it to be you see you can know you can know all the scriptures you can know all the quotes but unless there's a life to back up that scripture or a life to push the enemy back off of it you see you're just you're just waiting in the water it might be a nice thing to know that that god has a chosen place of worship or god's provided a place of worship but to realize that that same jesus christ is dwelling on the inside of his bride today and that she alone that she is standing here in the midst of in the midst of chaos in the midst of laodicea but there is a chosen place of worship and that bride of jesus christ she's not robed in her own righteousness she's robed in his righteousness she's not standing there in her own mechanics but she's standing there in the mechanics of the word and the dynamics the spark of the holy ghost has come and set her life of fire i think it's an amazing thing to recognize and to be able to experience the true liberty of the message i recognize that that many of you came out of came out of denominations some of you came out of catholicism and some of you come out of productivism at protestant and you come out of those works or those movements of the world but to think about the true liberty that you have as sons and daughters of god sitting here under the auspices of the message of the hour i think what a powerful testimony that it is to witness that god's still getting his elect that god is still going after his seed and there's not there's not anything that can be put upon a child of god brother branham would say that he would say some of the greatest experiences that i've ever had in my life is when i couldn't see my way through it or if i couldn't wake my way through it that god would stand there and he would move that mountain out of our life and i think it's amazing thing that we could point back and all the roadblocks and we could point back at all the stepping stones that we've had in our life that led us to where we are today and if we've not grown in our christian walk then when there's something wrong but to think that to say today is that the same pillar of fire that was there with the children of israel it's the same pillar of fire that showed up and had its photograph taken with our prophet william branham it's that same pillar of fire that has decided to come down in the midst of the church of the living god again today and to bring us back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers i believe malachi 4 ran his race i believe malachi 4 laid aside everything that would hold him back and i think if we've had a prophet that would stand before us and give us a give us such a testimony how much more should the children of the of the living god stand here under their witness of the message of malachi 4 be able to roll their shoulders back and live out this message if we had a prophet stand before us and show us how to do it how much more as sons and daughters of god how much more shall we stand here under the authority of this message and recognize that our liberty has not been taken from us but our liberty has been given unto us we've not received a watered-down gospel we've not received a prophet that was wishy-washy in his thoughts we had a prophet that stood there and he preached the word whether they liked it or whether they didn't but i like this message just the way it is you don't need to change it up you don't need to water it down i've seen what it produces in our young people i've seen what it does to care to people that were paralyzed i've seen what it's done to babies with crippled feet i've seen what this message can do and if we're going to do anything we're going to stand behind the full word of god we're not going to take anything away from it because when you start taking away from the word of god and you start adding to the word of god that's when you remove the liberty right out of the message let's let the message be the message [Applause] brother marin would say no he said now the wheat alone it's just the wheat he said but when the quickening life gets into it he said into the wheat he said then it gives it life and he said when we which were once dead in the trespasses of our sin we that were made into the very images of almighty god he said god brother madam said that god had to get that quickening power or that quickening life in your mortal bodies he said i'm talking about your body a body the house prepared for me brother madam said that god had to get that quickening power on the inside of your body now to think to think that that it was promised he was promised a messiah that he would come and we know that the bible said that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god is that right but we recognize that brother brandon would tell us and teach us he said that jesus jesus just as a man wasn't able to do that to go in there and grab those prophet's prophecies and make him manifest right before right before the church of that day but it took the very quickening power of almighty god it took the spirit of almighty god to come on the inside of jesus just like you you have to be fully adopted as a son and daughter of god you see you can stand there know all the scriptures have i stated but you could sit there and say well it said in mark 16 that will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now god is obligated to keep his word but if you're standing there as a fully adopted son and daughter of god you've got a right to tell satan take your hands off of god's property you see it took the very life of jesus christ to make it manifest and make it prove exactly what it was to think that same quickening power is the quickening power that's got to be on the body of jesus christ today he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth within me and you might come up here and somebody lay their hands upon you and you might get completely restored maybe life-changing events happen in your life but it is not the man it is the spirit of the living god that is working through that man and i'm gonna tell you what if there's one thing that i'm gonna do i'm gonna get myself out of the way and let god have his liberty god don't need my two cents god don't need my ideas god don't need my energies god just wants me to yield my vessel unto him and if i can yield my vessel unto him and let god have his liberty i'll say that the message will produce exactly what william branham preached that it would do it'll create sons it'll create daughters of god this message preached in its entirety will be exactly what paul preached exactly what peter preached that's why satan is trying to do everything within you because god satan knows that god is immutable both in his ways and in his actions and he recognizes that there is a church on earth today that is a mark 16 church in action and he recognizes that if the church of the living god catches this he will be an invincible army i'd say it's too late satan we've already received a prophet's message and that invincible army is up on her feet she's not sitting down she's not backing up but we've stood up right exactly where the message put us at [Applause] i'm sitting right here exactly where i'm supposed to be at this is the overcomers domain it's from eternity to eternity and hell don't know what to do with a believer that knows their position in jesus christ about glory [Applause] it ain't just enough to see it working in one person but working in a body it ain't just enough it ain't just enough to just to see the thumb move it ain't just enough to see the see the neck move it ain't just enough to see the hand move the body has got to be under the headship it's got to be under the intellect of the headship and when you start moving to a different room to a different groove or a different rhythm of music you're getting out of step you're getting out of cater and god does not want a church that's led by their own emotions led by their own intellects and that's where people get in trouble at is when they start putting their own intellects to the message putting their own theology to the message this message was perfect the way that it came [Applause] [Music] let me tell you when i received the message i ain't just talking about hearing it on the tape but when the message got ahold of me it didn't come down to some watered-down thing it didn't take it easy on me it didn't say well you can do this that or the other it what's the full message it cut sin off of my life it cut sickness off of my life it was the message it was the very quickening power [Music] there's going to be any actions done in your body it's got to be christ working through your body you see when you're letting him have complete liberty in your life you are saying god you're in control of everything god you've got my finances god you've got my you've got my problems god you've got this situation this that or the other if god would work through elijah and elisha would stand there under the anointing under the anointing of christ when christ the anointing of god would come upon elijah he would stand there and god had god had given elijah a great ministry and when it come down to the jordan river when elijah was going to be taken away from elisha you remember the story and you remember you remember sitting there that elisha asked a very specific word is that right he asked for a double portion of his spirit is that right and you remember if you go to studying out you go to studying out the life of elijah and elisha they were they were under the same anointing which was christ they were under the same ministry and what was it to do it was to restore the altar and it was to restore faith is that right am i preaching to you the truth but remember when elijah asked for that double person you can look throughout elijah's life and there was eight miracles but you can look throughout elijah's life while he was living and there was 15 miracles and it looked like god had missed it or it looked like god had forgotten but there was a band of men one day that was carrying a brother they was carrying a brother that had died in the battle and they they were walking out through there and they were going down through there and they seen an army coming up they seen the enemy coming up and they threw this band they threw this soldier in that ra in that little in that little place but they didn't know where they was laying him out you see they threw that dead man into not just to any message they threw him in elijah's message and there was a promise on elijah's message that there was a double portion that would be poured out what's been poured out in this day it's not just another cloak it's the same life of jesus christ oh somebody they threw him in there on elijah's bones and they took off and running [Applause] now i wonder if we could get a testimony from a soldier real quick i wonder if we could get a testimony from a soldier boy you know i was up there i was up there in british columbia and i was up there and i was i was desiring to get into a meeting where william branham was at i was desiring to get up there but because but because of things of that this that or the other and it seemed like it wasn't going to get to him but it come down when william branham was singing oh how i love jesus oh how i love jesus he stops and says soldier boy soldier boy you're not gonna do that satan is just trying to ruin your life i wonder if we'd have tv three right here just for a minute and said we'd like to interview a t we'd like to interview a soldier boy real quick we'd like to ask you what it's like we're asking now can you explain to us exactly what happened over here well i'll tell you i'll tell you i was in the battle and things were going all right and all of a sudden i i must i must have died or something because i felt this coldness come over my body and the next thing that i know the next thing i know i come running out of a place that looked like a place where people needed to be buried at but i was very much alive and i come running out and there was my some of my buddies out there some of my war companions and i was running faster than they were what can you tell us a little bit more about it well i don't really really know but i recognize this that my buddies had to tell me that when we threw you in there we threw you in there as a lifeless corpse but when you come out of there we found out we didn't just throw you in any grave we threw you upon the quickening power of elijah's bones and god had remembered his promise i'll say this to you you can throw any god-man man-made image of god you can throw it on this message and it'll raise it back to life again you can throw any of your particles on this message and it'll bring them back to life you can throw any cancer disease on this message and the message has got the power to push it out you can throw any covert devil any sugar diabetes therefore on this message and the message has got the power to set you free he was a soldier boy up there in british columbia and you walked in one way but when the message came by your way and told you the very secrets of your heart he said you go back and be a real man you'll not go back to that filthy habit no more hallelujah that's why i got confidence that no matter how far you are no matter how deep you are no matter how lost you are you put this message on anybody as far as they are down in the pit and this message has got enough power to raise them back to life again [Music] i'm just a little i'm a little boy trapped on the inside of a man's body there's a whole lot of boys still left in me and you know i like [Applause] hallelujah we're not having confessional tonight but you know there's something on the inside inside of humanity that likes pushing down on a pedal just a little bit to get a thrill you know you put them you can put them angel wings back there baby that's something don't tell the police officer up here or anything like that but there's every once in a while that you got to get the you got to get the dust out of the carburetor [Applause] i'm afraid too many times people got dusted or carbureted or worshiped and it's been so long since you put your foot on the pedal and you lifted your hands and you lifted your voice and things started restraining you so that you weren't at a full liberty to be able to move at a capacity that you were destined to move at but oh if you can just get into his atmosphere one time and blow the dust out of the carburetor of your soul and say god i'm here to worship you god i'm destined and built so that i could run after you father i've come to lift up the name of the most high god start blowing that dust out of the carburetor you'll see what you can run at now they tell me they tell me that in certain classes of cars like mercedes that they have the ability to run at so many so many horses per hour and they they they can run a standard a standard a standard 550 can run at 362 horses per hour i'm gonna tell you what that's more horses than brother williams got in his barn out there that thing can flat out move but you see you see if you can you see on that certain amg package you see there's something that is there that after the warranty goes out after the warranty goes out you can go in there and you can remove you can remove remove certain settings and they can go in there and take a chip and that thing is being able to move at from 362 horses per hour then to 720 horses per hour now you think about so much power that's contained in an automobile and you think if you can just remove the restraint off of it if you can remove that restraint off of it it'll move at a terrific speed and i'll say this if you get your cold ideas of what you think it is or what you think jesus is capable of doing why don't you let god out of a box just for a moment and why don't you remove the restraints that you put on the message and why don't you run it full speed ahead you'll move at a speed that you never imagined i got bad news for you that are wanting to get horses and ride in the buggy again so that you can save yourself some gas let me tell you those days are going by you might ride in one here or there up in amish country but it'll never get you to your destination and we're not living down here in martin's day we're not living down here in luther's day we're not living here in wesley's day we've been called up to come a little bit higher this is an astronaut age and only those that are destined to get in there that are elected and go through a certain course are able to move let me tell you your jet fuel's already been paid for you ain't got to worry about the price of it you ain't got to worry about how you're going to get it in there it's already in there the message has already got the dynamics just get in it just get in it [Applause] now some of y'all need to let that little boy out in you i ain't talking about here on this natural ground i'm talking about right here when you lay everything down when you decide that enough is enough of layout to see you and you decide that i'm going to finally serve god the way that he wanted me to be you know he so designed you that you are fearfully and wonderfully made that everything is in his order and everything is set up and he's designed your vessel to be a spot of worship he's designed you in such a way that you echo out hallelujahs and you went throughout amen and you worry you'll start worshiping he's the one that designed you you remember when brother branham is standing there and he's preaching on there is a man that turned on the light you remember there was a there was a mechanic that was down there working and he was working with everything within him to get this chevrolet part try to get it back together he was trying to put it back together the way that he thought it would go and he'd try this and he tried that and it just seemed like it wasn't working the way the way that he that he thought it would be but brother madam said that there was a man that was standing there and he said he was a dry a nice dressed man he was sitting there and he said son he said i believe that if you'll take this part and put this with it that everything will work according the way that it was designed to go and that brother branham said that man had enough sense to turn around and said now who are you he listened to him and he did come out exactly the way he come out exactly the way that it was designed to work at is that right and he said no who are you he said i'm the chief designer i'm the chief designer i'm the one that built this product i'm the one that built this and he knew this was the man the chief designer was there and he knew exactly the speed or he knew exactly how it was built and how it was going to manifest he was the one that designed it now brother branham said now who's got more who's got more knowledge the methodist or the baptist how to get this church in rapturing order it's the one that has designed it and he said he's a nice dressed man robed in the power of his resurrection and he's here to manifest i say god has designed you hell ain't gonna win hell ain't gonna destroy you he won't make you go down in defeat he designed you to have full victory [Applause] brother marilyn would tell us hey tell us in the feasts of trumpets he said the bride is with the words he said they're one he said how can they be one he said when the word that's wrote in there becomes you in you and makes you what makes you and the word become one he said he would go on to say and who do you say this is when the ex when the ecclesiastical powers and the economical churches or the ecumenical councils were were asking for you to come and join your hand with them so that you might be one the catholics joining together the presbyterians joining together this one joining together and they're saying that we'll be one but jesus said he said jesus prayed that we might be one he said that's true he said but not that kind of one he said be one as i and the father are one he said be that kind of one he said then how will that be he said the word in us will be the anointed word that is the oneness of god he said you see the oneness of god is the word anointed in you and then you become a son or a messiah of the age and i think that's why we can stand here and see what william branham was standing there and said it was the anointed man but now it's anointed people anointed by what by accepting what eve turned down and when eve turned down the headship of the word back there in the garden of eden she was turning down the oneness of god but there is another body on earth today that is anointed to be the messiah of this age that's had every restraint moved off of her that can do the same works that he did hallelujah now you go studying out in the old testament and you find that the bible records how that god how the gods people had lost their physical liberties at time and time again as various empires would overtake them you see the the loss of physical freedom was often tied to spiritual disobedience like worship and false gods i was reading this morning over in second chronicles 13 when jeroboam when jeroboam and abaja of abijah they come out to go to battle together and jeroboam was the king of israel and abigail they come they come to fight they come up to battle together and here jeroboam jeroboam was over there and he was supposed to be serving the true and living god as the king of israel and they voted they voted jeroboam in because of solomon's son because of his son's mistakes and because of his failures they voted jeremiah jeroboam in to be the king of them and jeroboam he got to looking out on the congregation of israel and he'd seen them going up there to feast and he seen him going up there up there to worship on the mountain going up there to jerusalem and he seen that he was beginning to lose his church he was starting to lose his church so he what he did he started introducing false gods into the message and he started introducing ideas and he started introducing and he started introducing the same thing that they wanted to do back there when moses brought them out and they built a golden calf and said this is the god that brought us out i think it's amazing when that devil raises his head again it comes back again in jeroboam and they built a golden calf and said this is the god that brought us out there ain't nothing new underneath the sun and you watch when people try to start moving in and shutting down the move of god but abajal was a real brother he was a real he was a real christian right here in this moment here eight hundred thousand men come out with jeroboam and only four hundred thousand men come out of judah they were outnumbered two to one and abijah begins to talk to him like a real brother he begins to talk to him like a real brother and sitting there you know remember he's starting to he's trying to persuade him said look look don't you remember don't you remember of the covenant that god had made between us and and david and the levites the covenant of salt the one that preserves you the one that will protect you the one that i give you that saving power don't you remember the covenant that undying covenant that he made with us notice that he's he's laying this out turn from your wicked ways he's he's he's trying to he's trying everything within him to show him the message this is the way god has said it nebuchadnezzar said look man you cast out everything that god set up you said you cast out the very design of worship you cast this out you cast out the levites you cast out the real anointed preachers and you tried to make priests instead of making them worship like god designed us to worship you made them run after false gods gods that ain't got no power god said ain't got no saving power godzilla can't heal you average i was trying to promote the message get it into his heart showing look man turn from your evil ways look man a king uses war as his last result you watch a real leader a leader will use war as his last result and abigail's taking the message and he's preaching a message and he's trying it but friend bring it before him said look you're up there in israel israel now i'm over here in judah and god set up our worship that we would bring it in before him that we'd have the sacrifice and we'd worship under the true and living god i'm telling you jeroboam don't go your way don't go after your way if you do you're going to lose look look jeroboam god himself is with us you've got gods that have no power but we have the true and living god the omnipotent jehovah that is on our side you have forsaken him but we've not forsaken him god has remembered us we kept the sabbath we worshiped we we we brought everything in before the priest we let the priest do do exactly as he as he's set up over there there's a sacrifice there's incense that's burning morning and evening that's burning there that sweet incense before the lord you walked away from it but we kept the charge of the lord our god but you forsook him and behold god himself is with us now look this is where true worship gets you you have god in your midst god himself is with us for our captain and his priests sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you o children of israel fight ye not against the lord of god the lord god of your fathers for you shall not prosper abigail knew the scripture and he was laying out before him and he recognized what moses had said over there in numbers 10 and 9 that if you go out to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and you shall be remembered before the lord your god and you would be saved from your enemies ebijah knew the scripture he done set up his worshipers he's then set up as levite christ his priest he set everything up and he said it's time to blow the trumpet and you're going to lose if we blow this gospel trumpet satan you are going to lose if we preach the message in its entirety you're not going to prosper [Applause] brother marlon would say that satan had a marvelous success but it failed when he met this body in this day when he met that same jesus that defeated him two thousand years ago in body form again he lost his success look verse 13 he said but jeroboam caused an ambush to come out behind him so that they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them was before judah and the ambushment was behind them and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind and they cried unto the lord and the priest sounded with the trumpets what were they doing they were following the instruction of the message now if god if god is as good as his word and his word is preached god will back up his word that's why i'm not afraid to lay hands on a sick and they shall recover because god is obligated to keep his word god is obligated to prove his word and if there his believing children will take him at his word you watch it doesn't matter what enemy comes up against you if you sound the trumpet that the lord your god will remember you and your enemies would be scattered i'll say this it's time to sound the gospel trumpet again it's time right now to sound off this gospel message that you're free and when the sun is set free it's free indeed and the bible said then the men of judah gave out a shout as the men of judah shouted and it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah completely surrounded surrounded on the front and surrounded on the back everywhere you look ain't nothing but devil devils that are trying to destroy you devils rather trying to destroy your health devils that are trying to destroy your worship devils that are trying to destroy your family you're completely surrounded but do what judah did judah still shouted and judas still worship this is how we fight our battles we might look like we're surrounded but [Applause] it might look like we're we're in defeat it might look like cancer is winning cancer can't win we've sounded the gospel trumpet we're still worshiping god the same way william branham said worship god some people don't understand your worship but it is designed to bring glory and honor unto him we've tried our best we've preached our hardest but now it's time to worship refute the devil refuse what they say about you stop listening to the lies of the devil i'm like paul i'm going to confess in the way that's called worship in the way that's called heresy is how i worship my god they say it's true pentecostal well i just worship god this way they say we're too excited well i just worshiped god this way brother ram says we believe in them old time heartfelt salvation he said we believe in the people's liberty to be able to say amen and praise the lord he said whatever the spirit of god leads you to do do it and he won't lead you to do anything but what's right amen and he is the spirit and god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth and god the very word god means an object to worship so god likes to be worshiped by his children that we can be free and not bound down in the yolks but we can exercise our faith in him and believe it and not be ashamed to tell the world about it let me tell you there's been a lot of things taken from me i've had my friends taken from me i've had my family taken from me don't take this from me i've had people turn their back on me i've had people laugh at me and mock me don't you take my liberty from me don't you take away the greatest thing that ever come into my life don't you take this message away from me it was his message that got me out of a pit it was this message that turned me to life it was this message that gave me a wife it was this message that gave me a real family it was this message that gave me the greatest friends in life it was this message that put me on a stage to stomp out every devil that's raising its head it's this message and now i'm i'm obligated to preach this message i'm obligated to stand here why would i turn my back on the greatest thing that's ever happened to me don't take this message from me oh [Applause] you forgive me things keep cutting in and out but i ain't done yet patrick henry stood right across this mess it's right across this mountain right here and riding on horseback and there was a man that was given his life because of the gospel of jesus christ and he was standing there and this preacher was saying some of his last words and he heard this preacher patrick henry riding on his horse and he stopped by and he heard this preacher standing there saying give me liberty or give me death patrick henry had been in the house of birds has been out of it back and forth and all those things but when it come time when britain was pressing down upon upon the americans and trying to rule them trying to rule the nation and trying to make intolerable acts come to pass patrick henry stood there so look man we're going to have to put on a posture of defense it's in the time this ain't the time to it's a time to just roll over and take what they're saying he stood there in the church in williamsburg which many of you stood there and many of you felt you felt the impact of that building you could you could sense you can sense the american nation being birthed right there they said let me tell you sir he said these are some of his remarks standing there on march 23 1775 he said that we he said sir they tell us that we're weak and unable to cope with such a formidable adversary but when shall we be stronger he said the millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess aren't invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us here's patrick henry saying these things in the natural he said we are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just god who presides over the destinies of the nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles the war is inevitable let it come and i repeat let it come he said i don't know what everybody else will do he said i don't know what course others may take but ask for me give me liberty or give me death i'm tired of britain trying to rule my worship i'm tired of them trying to tax me over this and that let me have my liberty i've had enough with satan trying to push us in a corner i've had enough with him telling us that the days of miracles have passed give me my liberty or give me death and patrick henry could stand there and say hey man we're going to have to have the posture of defense let's stand as a church of the living god and have a posture of defense there's no weapon there's no weapon that is formed against the bride of jesus christ that'll prosper if god is for this bride who can be against this bride if jesus said i can do all things through christ who strengthens me let's stand there [Applause] you're gonna have to fix it it's too terrible up here it's it's reverberating up here i'm sorry but we're gonna have to stop giving power to the voice of our adversary and stop confessing his thoughts if we're going to confess anything let's confess what jesus said about us he is the high priest of our confession he's the high priest of your confession let me quote you your prophet he said do you get what i mean what you confess you are that's what you are any man will never live any further or any higher than what he believes he's living he said you take a man that's talking about drinking all the time and he talks about drinking he thinks about drinking he drops right down into that category and becomes a drunkard he said a man that's always thinking about vulgar things that's what he'll do but i'm going to stand here and i'm going to confess what jesus said i'm going to confess isaiah 53 i am healed i am delivered i am stronger than i thought i was i am not as weak as the devil tells me hell i am i am gonna make it i have what it takes i'm a real overcomer i'm a child of god i am god's son i am robed with the holy ghost i can cast satan out before the throne of god anytime i'm equipped i'm empowered i've been given authority as adopted sons and daughters of god and i have full status as his offspring i am fully authorized to use the name of jesus christ for any need at any time i am a believer i'm not going to confess what satan said about me i'm going to confess what jesus said about me it's time that you start taking the mentality as a son and daughter of god what if you take the mentality and you listen to what the enemy has whispered about you let's go down to his camp real quick and let's hear him whispering about you you're not good enough you'll never live this you'll never be this let's go down to his camp and let's call him out just for a minute let's let's listen to what he's got to say that's what he's whispering in your ears but down in hell he's whispering some other things if they ever catch who they really are i am defeated i see too much quickening power on them and if they really grab a hold of it they're right there in the atmosphere and if they ever really grab a hold of it i'm gonna get my props knocked out from underneath of me [Music] why don't you start thinking what the devil really thinks about you not what he whispers in your ear he knows he can't handle you you remember in ezekiel 37 when ezekiel went over there and he was shown a valley full of dry bones you remember he said he said you come over here and look on this valley full of dry bones and you watch he said can these bones live again he said thou knowest lord thou know us if these people can really live out this message you really you know if they can really experience the liberty of this message you only know that he said prophesy speak to the bones speak to them prophesy upon them son of man and you watch you watch as that's four stages of it it was bones in you skin and and the wind that came upon them he said prophesy upon him prophesy and he said i heard a rattling and i heard a noise and he said it was bone coming to bone he said and there he said then prophesied and then he watched the sin you come upon him he watched the muscle come upon him he watched the skin come upon him but he said there was no wind there there was no wind there he said son of man prophesy to the wind and breathe on them now a while back i was studying on this salt i studied on this salt right here just going over ezekiel 37. man i was heaven i was having a hard time putting it together exactly the way the lord wanted me to put it together my papa charlie met me in a dream he said andrew he said if you'll focus on that fourth spot if you'll focus on the fourth stage he said everything will be all right now let me give you some words from the other side from a man of faith if you can focus on the wind if you can focus on the wind god's got a body god's got muscles here and god's got skin on earth right now but if he can breathe upon you the breath of life that which he was standing there in john and he said breathe and he breathed on them and said receive you the holy ghost and they went up there on the day of pentecost if my papa charlie could come from that side of the grave and said focus on this part let me tell you full gospel lighthouse it's time that you focus your life into the power of the holy ghost and then and i breathed upon them i spoke the word and breath entered into them what happened they stood upon their feet what was it it was the word that brought them to their position what's brought you here it was the word it's not man's doing it's the word that brought you here this is him this is a lord steward [Applause] each time that you start taking words from the other side don't take what satan said take what god said you're gonna make it and there stood up an exceeding great army breathe on him don't you see why satan's afraid of you it's because the breath of god is breathing on his children today and he's doing everything within his power to stop you to stop you from getting to this position but he showed up too late the word is here the word's called to your feet the word has done this [Applause] back in the late 80s early 90s there was a bad there's a bad dude that was in a ring named mike tyson man he showed up on the scene everybody's saying this is the next muhammad ali nobody could stop and he'd won fight after fight after fight and there'd never been anybody after mike tyson and knocked them up knocked them out had they ever got back up knocked them completely out and they never got back in the ring but buster douglas come for his time to fight him and his mama told him buster you're gonna whip mike tyson you're gonna whip mike tyson he trained with everything within him because ain't never been anybody that got knocked out by mike tyson that got back up he trained like never before his mama kept telling him so you're going to beat mike tyson you're going to beat him you're going to beat him and two days before the fight buster douglas's mama died it come to the fight mike tyson is warned with buster douglas he's beating him everywhere around that ring and knocks him out buster douglas lays there and he gets back up and he goes over in his corner and he starts remembering what his mama told him you're gonna whip mike tyson you're gonna whip mike tyson and buster douglas come out there and he beat mike tyson mike tyson's own words everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the mouth mike tyson lost a plan and buster douglas remembered what his mama had said and he remembered those words beyond that veil of death and here's my thought to you if a man can take those words from that side of a veil how much more as the elect of god should we take the words of a prophet that's went beyond the veil and said there's been a vision seen over you you can do it you're going to win you are bone of his bone life of his life power of his power i'm gonna take what a prophet has said about me not what satan has said about me we're fighting this enemy right now like never before right here in the middle of satan's eaton and you ordained to be an overcomer you ordained to win this battle there's a power on the inside of you that's got to come out there's healing on this in this body there's deliverance in this body there's power in this body there's peace in this body there's glory in this body but the enemy's trying to creep its way into this body and tell you you can't have full liberty it's time as sons and daughters of god you start manifesting what god has destined you to be this is the manifestation of the resurrection for the people in this day i'm struggling brother andrew i'm struggling i got good days and i got bad days i've got days when i feel like a christian in days when i don't feel like a christian there's a lot of emotions that i go through brother andrew satan wars with my mind over and over and over again it's time you focus on the fourth stage and when you get there and he breathes the breath of life in you get ready you're gonna have more troubles than you ever had before you're gonna have more mind battles than you ever have before you're gonna have more struggles there's days when you don't really feel like a on top of the mountain there's days when kids are screaming and man it's just fun to be a teacher in it it's days when brother stephen he just gets a little out of hand you need a little bit more jesus in the house right but does it mean that you don't have the holy ghost just because you go through troubles and just because you go through trials this body is the most powerful body that there is but brother branham said it's one of the most sickest bodies that i know is the body of the lord jesus christ you're going to go through trials you're going to go through tribulations you're going to go through struggles but all of that is coming to an end when satan is finished you'll never be finished when satan is over you're just beginning because you focus on the fourth stage when the wind come into a body and a resurrected body to be exactly like the son of man walking in flesh again a body thou has prepared for me a body i can work a body i could work through a body i could lay my hands on a body i can do that as a really believer a body it looked close in luther it looked close in wesley but a body it was so close the pentecostals really thought they were there but i finally got a body i got a body that's john 14 12. i got a body that's john 15 7. i got a body that's mark 16 an action i've got a body that's got full liberty that's got the same power that i've got that's got power to cast satan out that's got power to condemn sin it's got power destroy this temple and i'll raise it up again it's going to be my greatest honor to stand there on that day to stand shoulder to shoulder with brother homer and brother ron say lord jesus men said i didn't have much and they despised a day of small things but i took this message and i preached it with everything within me it was just a small group over there in elkton but this is the body if i could hear coming through the veil just for a moment give me a little bit of liberty right here if i could hear coming through the veil brother homer you're exactly what i built this church for i didn't build it for my own emotion and i didn't build it for my own eagle but i built it that it would be a place where god would come and feel welcome men scrutinize me and men criticize me but i preach the message keep fighting keep fighting don't give up keep fighting you're almost there you're almost there and when you get to the finish line i'll be right there and when we're going to present you before the lord jesus christ i'll be right there with brother on i'll be right there with brother angel i'll be right there with those men of god [Applause] but if we could echo out through that veil on the other side brother homer we appreciate you standing for this message thank you for setting a a standard a body thou has to prepare for me a body that's not afraid to use the gifts of god a body is that it's not ashamed to speak in tongues a body that's not ashamed to interpret a body that's not ashamed to prophesy a body that's not ashamed of love a body that's not ashamed to work a body that's not ashamed to move a body a body thou has prepared for me i echoed out my heart to you a few weeks ago on god's anticipation i can't get away from it i cannot get away from the facts or the thoughts of god's anticipation you know as a little child mama says you're going you're going on this trip or you're going to disney world man you you're anticipating it you've made out plans you've already picked out what you're going to eat i know what i'm talking about those those are the dreams that are real nightmares to me i'm trying not to go cardinal right now you've just designed this whole trip and set it up you've already picked out your mickey waffles you've already got every idea where you're gonna get your cotton candy and the greatest ice creams and the biggest donuts ain't that right brother scotty you've got everything set up and a child as a child you're anticipating this day you can't hardly sleep at night you're dreaming about it and you get there and it's raining things did not turn out the way you thought it would your wife don't let you have that extra spicy chicken waffle and things just don't go the way that you want it to go but god has anticipated this day it won't not be out of place there won't be one person missing there won't be one plate that's missed or added to god designed you and he built himself a body and he's already got your seat and your name tags picked out everything's gonna be just right you eat something that just don't satisfy and you start looking for something else down here on earth but when you start eating there the wedding supper the best the world's got to offer here is nothing that is to be compared i believe that his anticipation has been met in this body with every fiber of my being god has a body that he fully trusts god has a body that he has full confidence in she won't fail she won't fault her she won't cater to men's ideas but she's strictly led by the leadership of the lord amen why don't you stand with me um i can't see [Music] it feels good to know that god slept slipped onto your hand the
