power of the Holy Spirit has led us into this place One More Time Lord we realize Lord that we are setting on Holy Ground father lord it's a place that we recognize that the angels of God have gathered to watch your children worship you father for only we as your children can worship you the way that we do because no angel understands the power of Grace like we do father and Lord we we've sang the songs of Zion Lord we've we've entertained you father with our worship now Lord we ask Lord that you would come and grace us with your presence Lord and you would begin to bless your children by the preaching of the word now father there are many things that we look upon in the natural that sustain us but this is our real sustaining father This Is Where We Gather our strength from lord it's been time of Crisis that we look back upon moments like what we're setting in here now father and you know our future father Lord and you know the enemy's future as well Lord and our and our own community and our own life father you see Lord the things Lord Jesus that we have need of here in in Elton Virginia we are asking Lord that the almighty God lord you you we have a pray we have a very special position that we hold with you tonight Lord Lord we as children can go before you at any time or any time of day or any moment Lord that we have need of Lord it's something about children they they know to come to you they know to come to their parent whenever they need father it doesn't matter if they're asleep it doesn't matter whatever it is they can go to their parent father we have the same access here tonight we come before you Lord and we are asking Lord that you would Minister to us father through the preaching of Thy word Lord may it give us strength and and energy in our spiritual being father to serve you to the best of our abilities now we commit this service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray these things amen and amen if you have your bi your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the Book of Genesis CH 4 verse three and then also to Numbers Chapter 23 Genesis 4 and Numbers Chapter 23 you love the Lord this evening amen the Bible says here in Genesis 4 and3 that in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass that when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him Numbers Chapter 23 verse one here the Bible says that and balum said unto Balo build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven Rams and Bao did as balum had spoken and Balo and balum offered unto every on every altar a bolock and a ram and balum said unto Bao stand by the burnt offering and I will go per adventure of the Lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee and he went to an high place and God met balam and he said unto him I have prepared seven altars and I have offered upon every altar a bolock and a ram and the Lord put a word in bam mouth and said return unto Bao and thus shalt thou speak and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of Moab and he took up his Parable and said Balo the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram out of the mountains of the East saying come curse me Jacob and come defile Israel and how how shall I curse whom God hath not cursed or how shall I defy whom the Lord hath not defied may God bless his word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord I'd like to speak to you this weekend on a thought uh Lord willing here on a thought that the Lord placed on our heart last weekend while brother Ron was speaking he was speaking along these lines of developing a picture that God developing his picture of of us and his predestination and knowing the journey that we are on that that we are walking with him and God developing that picture and one brother Ron began to speak those things this this thought dropped in my heart that I'll speak to you this weekend on on a collision of atmospher and immediately when brother Ron began to speak those things my mind went to reeling back into in my schooling and remembering when we would when we would take photography and videography classes that when we would develop the pictures that they had to go through a dark room process that they had to go through the solution that they had to be had to sit there for so long and they had to go through an agitation process before they could be brought back into the light and and so tonight by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you this thought uh is very fresh to me and uh so we just we just take it as far as we go tonight and let the Lord lead us as he does but that word Collision it is the act of striking together it is it is a clashing it is an opposition a collision can mean a running against each other as just like it ships at Sea that we would see or maybe in olden times when we would look back and think about when when kings and kings and queens would have jousting events when two knights would be fully decorated in their heavy armor as they would as they would go against each other and they charge each other and horse back back and forth with lanches and they would do it with all and trying to hit each other as hard as possible and they were what they were doing they were causing a reaction to their actions that they were that they were in the process of doing they they they created a collision and the one that the one that maybe got pierced through or one that moved at a terrific rate of speed was the one that maybe would win the battle or whatsoever but it caused a collision as we would know and it caused a reaction to what they were looking at and there are there are many common chemical reactions that we are aware of that we would see in our everyday life but we don't necessarily think about the process of them because we just simply expect the results of them and one of them being combustion which we enjoy y all enjoy a fire and especially as a season that we're getting ready to go into but we don't think about the process of combustion how that it takes three elements to bring about the the fire that we all enjoy it takes it takes oxygen it takes heat it takes fuel and it you can you can understand that you don't really think about it you don't really think about the the process of what we enjoy necessarily even in a meeting like what we're having here tonight or or things that have happened in our past or maybe that are happening in our future it's because of all of the elements of Prayer of fasting and believing how that they come together and it creates a fire of the Holy Ghost that that channels our that channels our belief into a into and it causes a reaction when all of these elements come together it's wonderful to know that there is power in prayer it doesn't matter who is praying it it doesn't matter where they're praying it but we realize that we understand that many of times we don't understand the effects on or the design or the elements of prayer but we all enjoy the results of prayer there are many things that we pray about that we don't necessarily see in our maybe in a week or so but maybe there are things that we have prayed about maybe maybe months and years ago but we don't even realize that healing or or or the power of the Lord is already worked we don't think about all the elements that are involved we just think about the results it's just like one time I was when I was working as a kid with brother Thomas back when I was in high school we we were cleaning this chimney and this guy he was I believe he was a a professor or doctor and he was he was beginning to tell brother Thomas how to create a fire and went through all the steps of it but he couldn't create a fire I thought it was amazing this guy could tell brother Thomas all about how to build a fire but yet he couldn't do it and it's amazing how people can take all the chemical ideas of all their ideas and try to make a church just work exactly the way it is but you see it's amazing how God Gets behind certain elements and then God begins to build a fire there are certain elements about these things that we common common uh chemical reactions that we don't even think about it's like everybody that is sitting here tonight you don't even think about your respiration system but it's something that God created on the inside of you that you have the ability to breathe in and to breathe out and when you breathe in you are breathing in oxygen and you're breathing out CO2 you don't even think about it but those plants that are out there those trees they are putting off they're putting off that oxygen they're breathing out oxygen to us and we're breathing out CO2 to them you don't think about it but every single one of us here are are operating through a chemical reaction that is that has happened and without that action in our life we couldn't be sitting here tonight it's it's what we understand what if you would take a if you would take a 1950 old Ford truck that you had kept up in the garage somewhere that you'd never seen that it was always garage kept and you ever kept it you kept it real clean and nice and everything it would stay in its perfect condition if it was out from underneath the elements but you take that truck and you put it out there under the elements of of water and air and under the conditions of of the atmospheres that it's in you you you'll see what you'll see is you'll begin to see a brownish oxide color that will come over that truck and that's that's one thing that a dealer is it's his worst nightmares to see one of those classic trucks that that has rust on it because rust is a is a truck's worst nightmare and the to go back in there but you don't really think about you don't really think about the process of it you just see the results of it you don't think about while while it's out there setting in the rain you don't think about the rust but after a while it begins to be a reaction to the elements that it's under and you don't really think about the power of the preaching of the word but when you see the results of it you understand that there was a collision of atmospheres that took place in the world that you're living in I think it's amazing that we have the ability to tap into a world that maybe we don't fully understand but yet there's something on the inside of us that wants to tap into that world of Faith or the world of the word and to tap into it and when you begin to operate in that level that you move in there by faith you begin to pull down things of God you don't really think about the process of the song leader working and beginning to stand there and begin to build an atmosphere you don't really think about it that much but all of a sudden that man that has a gift from God he he takes the atmosphere and he he changes it according to the Lord's desire you see that's the power of A Gifted Man Of God he understands what it's like to to get into the mind of God he's prayed about it he's he's studied what the Lord wants and he begins to move under the elements of the atmosphere and we always recognize that though no matter where we go that there is a there is a battle that is between the natural and the spiritual and we always recognize that that there are twins of every Revival and I don't have time to go through every twin that came but we know that there was Cain and Abel which we read of and throughout every Revival it always produces a twin of it but we recognize immediately in the Bible that there is a collision between Lucifer and Michael when Lucifer which was God's coworker in heaven to think about this tonight that God God had a man that was his right-hand man he was his leader of Music they in in heaven and this man was a right-hand man to almighty God but this man had something that would rise up on the inside of him which is pride that he wanted to lift himself above the stars of God but this man had every ability that God had except for the ability to be able to create so he had the ability to to stand out there and to create or to to worship God but he did not have the be the ability to speak things into existence so so tonight to know that you have more power than Satan has ever had I think it ought to make you be able to Rejoice to understand to know that you have done something tonight by your worship that Satan has never done you have created something here by these elements of of respiration you have breathed in and you have breathed out the Praises of almighty God you have done something that Satan has never done but what Satan can do he can pervert what God has created so what he does he cannot have the ability to be able to create anything so he simply deforms or he perverts what God has created you watch any seed that's that God has created the only ability that Satan has is to be able to pervert it or to change it in some way it's just like the cells of our body every one of those cells in our body was formed to be a product of almighty God but Satan wants to get get into those Cs and he wants to break up those CS because if he can break up those CS he can make us sick so Satan comes in to what we would realize is is what we are made of of of 16 different elements that are in our body there are 206 bones that are in our body that our little my little daughter taught me about today but there are six there's there's 16 elements that we are made out of and there every one of them they have a we have a cell on the inside of us and if we know that those cells are created for God to use but Satan wants to come in there and pervert those cells and brother Brandon would take that and he would type it and he would break down what cancer is that cancer is a life he said it's just like a cell that's in your body he said you can look at anything in the natural and it'll type the spiritual he said you look at cancer he said what it is he said it's a backsliding sail he said but you look at it he said if you look at it in the in in the spiritual he said it's a devil he said but in the natural it's like a buzzard it's like a scavenger he's eating on dead things that sell was meant there put there to be to be an abstract an an attribute of almighty God to begin to express what God had in his mind you see these bodies were formed so that we could bless God these bodies were formed that we would prosper and be in good health but Satan is against everything that God is for is that right so we see that when when Satan comes into that sail here you see every single one of us we come through we come through the bedding grounds of our mothers and our fathers and it doesn't matter what God intended that seed to be whatever that germ is whether it's a dog or whether it's a bird or a foul of the air God has destined that cell to produce exactly what he thought of that germ that it would be and it's just like when you pass through the bedding grounds of your mother and your father father you were then a product of what your father was but your father could not fellowship with you in that realm so he had to produce you he had to produce you so that he could have fellowship with you and God wanted to understand what it was like to be a savior so God created himself something that he could save so he reached down and he grabbed Adam and Eve out of their condemnation and he wrapped them up with a blood cell of a lamb and he allowed them the Eed that they were born to be in he allowed them to walk back into it by this body in this generation to walk back into that same atmosphere of the Garden of Eden as the body of Jesus Christ now has done we understand that cancer it comes from a bruise for instant may he would say he in my hand he said it hasn't got cancer he said it may have sometime but right now it doesn't he said but what is cancer he said it's some sale or germ in my body that backslides it gets bruised or something sets in it and he said from that cell it starts a multiplication of cells and multiplying and and it forms a Cancer and it begins to start eating on my body now brother random said now he would say he said now any sale he said any kind of germ he said it will nothing he said if nothing interrupts that program he said God's program if nothing interrupts it it'll be a perfect it'll be a perfect maybe it's a dog bear or bird or bear or any a child or anything he said if nothing interrupts God's program it'll be perfect he said it'll grow to be a perfect normal adult he said if nothing if nothing interrupts it he said but when something interrupts it he said then it's bound to be evil that interrupts God's program he said God didn't intend you to be sick he made you in his likeness and he wants you to be well he's done everything that he can to keep you well but it's Satan that is against you it's Satan that is against you you see that sale has a life like you have a life so there is something that is calling for you to live and there's something that is calling for you to die and we realize this that Satan is absolutely obsolute without a body to work in is that right we look we look back in the Bible and we see when Legion is standing there before Jesus that he stands there and he those demons begin to cry out send us into that herd of swine because those Dem demons have no ability unless they have a body to work through that's why Satan hates anything that is that is including Mark chapter 16 because he recognizes when the church begins to believe the word of God they have the ability to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and Satan knows that when you begin to tap into the spiritual that there is a collision with the carnality that Satan is trying to produce in your own body you see Satan knows that if he can make you sick he can make your mind weak if he can make your mind weak he can make you doubt God's word but this we know that that when Whenever there is a class when the carinal and the spiritual meat there always is a collision we notice when Judas and Jesus Jud Judas and Jesus excuse me when they begin to meet there was a collision there was a clash one of them one of them was was the pastor and one of them was a treasure of the church just like Cain and Abel there was a collision that happened between them it was a collision that happened between them and notice what it is it's always a constant war or a collision between the two you notice always there was when Saul and David were on the same on the same scene at the same time there was always the Bible said there was war between Saul's house and David's house and David's house got stronger and stronger but Saul's house got weaker and weaker but this we know that Jesus said in Matthew chapter 24 that you will hear of wars and rumors of wars and this we know that brother Brandon would teach us he said if you see this National spirit and they cause a war against this National Spirit he said what it is is two demon spirits that are at War at each other he said they cannot get along he said so they begin to fight each other that's exactly what happened in World War I and World War II it was demonic powers that were against each other so they begin to fight it out they begin to fight it out but the angel of the Lord came and stopped that war but I don't know if you read the news today or not but we realize that Israel is at War right now they're at War right now with Hamas and Iran and we recognize that that everything of hell is against anything that has God called and we know notice that even all the way back with with with Esau and Jacob that we go all the way back from Abraham and lot that we realize that there's always been a clash between the natural and the spiritual it doesn't matter what type it is in Christ or Antichrist but there's always a battle between the two and didn't Yahoo said today he said our enemy will pay a price they'll pay a price of which it has never known he said we are in a war and we will win it and Satan doesn't realize that he's going to pay a price that he has never known and he may battle us and he may attack us sale after sale time after time but we will win this war we will win this war it doesn't matter the attacks of the enemies it doesn't matter how he comes against us but we will stand here under our god-given privileges you go and study out how big Israel is Rhode Island's almost bigger than Israel but every Army in the in the Nations is against that one place but anybody that is for Israel God will bless them and anybody that is for Spiritual Israel God will bless them in return don't you see when somebody begins to bless you or bless your children that you'll see the benefits of almighty God poured out upon them and they don't know nothing about this message it's because of who you are if you stand for Israel God will stand for you and if you'll stand for this message God will stand for you we look all the way back let us let me just roll through these scriptures just real quick that we roll all the way back in the Garden of Eden there we find that when God begins to create man and I just want to make reference to these things that there God in in Genesis 1 and 26 he said let us make man in our image in Genesis chap 2 and 7 there we see that God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and there he breathed into him the breath of life and there when God had created the Garden of Eden Eastward he there took man and he placed him in there of which he was formed out of the ground of the earth and we notice that there in that Garden was two trees there there was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and it was the tree of life that was setting there in Genesis chap 2 and 16 then we see the command commment that God gives unto man that thou shall not eat or or or of every tree of the garden thou might freely eat except of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil so we immediately watch that God creates man in his own Spirit then God after his own Spirit then God creates Man Out of the Dust of the earth then God places that man under a under a Commandment that thou shalt not touch these things so we immediately watch that in that Garden there are two ATM atmospheres there are two atmospheres there's two persons and that each person has an atmosphere it's like everybody sitting here tonight you put off your own air or you put off your own atmosphere there's a lot of people that are here tonight or maybe people that you meet out there brother bandam said there's certain people that you just love to be around he said then there are certain people that you don't want to be around at all he said be it's because of the atmosphere that they create you don't have to ask people how they're doing typically their face will tell you how they're doing they'll they'll they'll tell you by their acent you watch a mama that ain't got no sleep all night she's been up all night putting up with children they had and hardly slip you'll watch that mama she snaps real quick at her children she snaps at her husband it's because you never know what a mama's going through you never know what a mama's going through and you watch you don't have to you really don't have to stick around long to find out that that Mama's had a long night by the atmosphere that she's creating but oh if you'll give that Mama eight hours of sleep she'll be just as good as new you don't really have to ask somebody what kind of atmosphere or what kind of day that they're having you can simply tell by the atmosphere that they're creating you don't have to ask your boss on the job how his weekend was when he comes in there and he ain't talked to you after three cups of coffee you understand there has been a collision in his life that has wrecked up wrecked up what he had going on this weekend and things didn't pan out like he wanted to but we watch right there in that scene that we've just seen that the prince of the power of the air comes on the scene this is your first introduction to the wrong atmosphere then you immediately roll over into Genesis chapter 3 and you'll find that there is a serpent that was more subtle than all the beasts of the land he was one so close to humanity that brother Brandon would say in the church age book he said there was definitely an affinity between him and Humanity that his seed could intermingle between Humanity but then God hid that but notice what Eve said when when they find themselves outside of God's will when they find themselves awakened to the fact that they are fully naked that they are not dressed how did they come by this knowledge Eve said this word the serpent that you created begot me and what did Adam do the woman that you gave me god notice what he did he immediately begins a blame game in humanity it's so amazing how people begin to start the blame game when they get caught in the act of sin that they blame this one or they blame their mother well I my daddy died with that or my mama dealt with that there was carnal impersonations in my life there was there was always drugs in my family there was alcohol in my family there was cancer in my family and they begin to blame it on that but here she says the serpent beguiled me that word begal means to entice it means to catch by bait and any good fisherman knows you're only as good as a bait that you're using you're only as good as a bait you're using I know of a I know of a story one time of an oldtime that used to go up there in the mountains and he and he he would go up there after him native trout and he would take maybe his grandson with him or or or somebody in his family he'd take them up there and and you had to use certain type of baits when you was fishing after them native Native fish and you had to have certain things and all the elements everything just right according to the state laws and I don't really know all that cuz I ain't necessarily done all that native trout fishing but I believe you can ask somebody in here but there there was there was there he be to he be to go out and maybe the grandson come back didn't have no fish but the granddaddy come back and he had all kinds of fish he said now tell me what are you doing different than I'm doing and he took him over and began to stomp on a little thing the grubs fell out you ain't necessarily supposed to do that and I don't know anybody and I ain't calling nobody a name that would do that but I do know that there are people in the past that would do that this man had been out there fishing with the wrong type of bait what he was supposed to be and he didn't catch anything but this man had a secret and he had the ability to go in there and catch those fish and and Peter knew of anybody Peter knew of anybody that knew how to fish Peter knew how to fish and he's standing there in second Peter chapter 2 and 14 he said having eyes of full of adultry then that cannot cease from sin beg galing unstable Souls so Peter begins to tell us that there are men that are full of adul tre that cannot cease from sin and they immediately entice or catch by bait unstable Souls you watch somebody that maybe it's the weakest of Christians they're always attracted to to different things or unstable in their soul it's easy sometimes it seems like it's easier for Satan to get a hold of them weaker ones than it does them that them stronger ones that's been in there a long time but Satan knows that if he can entice you by the right kind of bait and you know Satan's real slick he's real slick in what he's doing he's been doing this for 6,000 years so he knows and he studied your family history and he knows there are things that are laying there so he realizes that if he if he sees you going this way and you're going Full Speed Ahead in the right direction oh Satan's got to do is come to you in the other direction with the right kind of enticement and he can turn you around so Satan has the ability to study you and you watch a daddy you watch a daddy or aead of a home that's always carnal always thinking about carnal things always thinking about always thinking about things of of of Nature and never thinking about spiritual things you'll find that you'll be that those children will be a product of their father they will have the carnality of their father but you take a husband or a head of a home that is constantly keeping his family in prayer or keeping his family ever before the Lord you will watch the children that are under the in influence of that father that they'll be praying children they'll be reading Bible kind of children there'll be people that love the message what is it Satan knows that if he can ever trap somebody in that type of carnality he can keep them there he has studied he has studied God's children for so long he knows that if there's somebody that has dealt with all kinds of enticements of lust all he's got to do is show them the wrong kind of AD and immediately that their mind begins to think on those things and they have such a hard time getting out of it because of their carnality but you put Satan Satan can put those same ads right in front of a born again son and daughter of God and it won't inflict pain on him it won't inflict bad thoughts on him why because he got something that he's anchored on to that's why James would say in James 1:14 but every man is tempted when he's drawn away after his own lust and enticed he's literally drugg off by his own passions Paul would say in Romans 7:11 he said for sin Tak an occasion by commandment deceive me deceived me and it slew me when you look up that word in in the Greek expat it means to cheat to thoroughly to dece the thought is to be completely deceived as to accept falsehood for the truth and Paul said for sin taken occasion by commandment it deceived me it looked right that's right the law looked right but it did not have the grace to unlock me from my sin it was a deceiving it was a deceiving carnal commandment that's why the Book of James would say in James 1 and22 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own self when you look up that word in the in the Greek a par parazo it means to miscalculate to be imposed upon it refers particularly to being beged by mere probability by mere probability that word probability means it has the appearance of Truth is be ye doers of the word and not hearers of the word only deceiving your own self so you don't want to just look like a Believer you don't want to just talk like a Believer you don't want to just dress like a Believer you want to be a believer you want to do like a Believer you see there are a lot of people that sit around the skirts of the message or the fringes of the message and they want to stick close enough just to get the blessings of the message William brandham said that's more dangerous than going out there and sinning you see because people have the ability to play the part of a h hypocrite but probability is the appearance of the right kind of agreement but maybe I'll just put this in my kind of words unpracticed truth is no better than denying the word unpracticed truth is no better than denying the word so you can know the word you can have the word and never act on the word or cause a reaction to the word it's no better than denying the word is that okay in my hillbilly kind of a language so it it means it means if you got what you got take what you got and do something with it that's just like King Saul he was a servant of the most high God the Israelites were the children of Promise they had all the Commandments on their side they had a covenant on their side they had circumcision on their side but they didn't do nothing with that giant that was in their way what were they doing they were hearers and not doers but the ears of David Avid walked into the camp one day he was not just a hearer only but he was a doer of the word of God and when Satan came against David it was a hit on collision it was a h on collision because Satan was running headlong he was going along with his plan but when David stepped into the camp Hallelujah it was a head on collision there's one thing they taught me about football I never was too good at it but what they did teach me they said now look you are lacking what your brother has but your brother is lacking what you have all I had on my side was a quick step and they taught me this I was small I'm trying to get back down that body weight one more time I highly doubt I ever see it again maybe my glorified body but they taught me this because you got a quick step the harder you hit them the harder their fall they taught me that that if you they might be bigger than you they might they might have more power than you but if you can learn how to make the right kind of collision rate at the right speed you can knock them right where they belong and maybe you might be weak in faith or maybe you might be small in your own mind but if you can just have the right Collision rate if you can have the right signs to it all maybe you don't understand the elements but maybe the results is what you're looking for well Glory little is much if God is in it the Bible said that there is a day when they despise the day of small things this is maybe a little bride but she's not weak in strength she's strong in almighty God was it they had everything they had need of but they wern't doing anything with it and that's many times the way that so many so-called Christians want to do they want to do something but they don't want to take what God give them and do something with it but brother bandam said that's what we need tonight is to get somebody who will take what you got and put it into action it might be something that you don't even want to do it might be it might be something so far off that you don't even want to pursue you know that Jeremiah got in the same spot a prophet of the Lord he had got tired of people re rejecting him he got tired of people turning down his message and said Lord I'm no longer going to speak in your name I'm no longer going to talk in your name I'm not going to do it Lord and we get so territorial so territorial about us that well if it ain't something I want to do I don't know if I'm going to do it and we get so territorial about well that person got prayed for and I didn't get prayed for or you know there C there's certain time there's certain people I I typically have a choice in this kind of if I got anybody treats me like this I'll just go ahead and decide to walk away from them kind of people but you ever had them kind of friends that were territorial about you that if they were your friend you were the only friend that they could have them's a kind of friends you need to drop and walk walk away like a bad habit but so many times we get territorial about our space or what we want to do in the kingdom of God or in the economy of God well I don't want to go out and pray for that sister I know how bad she's been Jeremiah said God I'm not going to no longer talk in your name I'm not going to speak in your name but then he said these words it was like a fire shut up in my bones that I couldn't keep my mouth shut even when it's things you don't want to do and you don't want to pursue God has the ability because Jeremiah knew that obedience was greater than sacrifice he knew against his own will against his own wants he wanted to obey almighty God so many times we get in our realm or our walk or our talk and our ideas and we just don't want to do it but when God speaks to you when God puts that pulsation on the inside of you that's why William Brandon would say he said you give me a church that's so completely Anointed with God to their every action and move as thus sayith the Lord and walk in that sh kind of Glory he said I'll show you a messiah an anointed one of God that is standing upon the Earth you see now Jesus would stand there when he would preached to us the parable of the swer that went out to sow his seed and he sowed it and the Bible said that some fell on good ground and some fell on Stony ground and some fell by the wayside William bandham said you first have got to let the word fall in the right type of faith and he said every seed will produce its kind if it's put in the right kind of atmosphere and under the right kind of condition you see if you put the right kind of a seed no Farmers PL planting corn thinking he's going to get strawberries he's planting it in the right condition if there is that kind of misconception in the seed it's somebody that's pulled a trick on him and when you watch as that old Slicker slipped out there after the Good Men went out there and threw good seed out there then the black man or the man in the black hood went out there and threw out tears into the field the owner of the field knew that there was a trick that had been played and you might feel like the attack of the enemy of throwing tears in your family family and cancer in your family and destruction in your family that it's an attack against you but you've got the picture completely wrong the attack is against the owner of the field and the owner of the field is obligated to make sure that the tears and the weak grow together at the right process don't you try to get rid of it the owner the angels will make sure to get rid of the tears in your life that tear ain't doing nothing you doing nothing to you but destroying the nutrients that was meant for you it's amazing how the carnal impersonators can attach themselves brother Randon would call them suckers grafted suckers that they would be grafted in and they would suck the very life out of the line that out of the vine that it was meant to be what are they doing they're sucking the very life out of it what is that terar doing all of those nutrients in the ground was meant for you but they were pulling it out trying to make you weaker but what Satan didn't realize is there was an angel that was watching over your seed the entire time that's why we understand the power of predestination that we come through all kinds of carnalities and all kinds of sickness and through all kinds of turmoils and snares but God was always there he was always there you can't release your potential living outside of your god-given privileges you say I want to be blessed I want to I I want to I want to be blessed God can never bless somebody that is not willing to give their all but if you're willing to give your all if you're willing to give your everything God can turn around and bless you God cannot bless somebody that robs from him he cannot bless somebody that's not willing to be his partner and give him of 10% of what is rightfully owned if you really want to release your potential you've got to give God your everything you see that's why the eagle could never produce his potential down there in the chicken pin was because he was under the atmosphere of a hen and you will never be able to produce the right kind of an atmosphere living with chickens thinking like chickens but oh if you can get in the atmosphere of an eagle one time I know it might be hard for you to understand but you are going so far against the grain of things that leoy is going to have to push you right out of here one of these days what is it you're not built for that kind of growing you're built you're built to grow in the atmosphere of faith to be continued let's stand so if we want everything right the right atmosphere everything we've got to lay out all things we've got to labor we've got to labor for the right things we've got to create the right kind of elements we've got to produce the right kind of product if we want to be considered in the whole of Fame there's a lot of things that we recognize as great art but before it can be great art it has to go through the Hall of critics a lot of people don't want to go against and they don't want to they don't want to stand they can't stand rejection amen I always want to be accepted on and man I just want to say this if we ever live in an age where the children of God are ever rejected we're living there right now we're rejected on every front on every angle Satan is against us like never before so if you if you if you can't stand being rejected well let me tell you let me talk to you about a king that was the rejected King that should have been the most accepted King there ever was but tomorrow I'll tell you about the Collision of the atmosphere that Jesus met when he came God richly bless you tonight brother Shannon would you sing for us amen there is an endless song echoes in my my S I hear the music ring and
