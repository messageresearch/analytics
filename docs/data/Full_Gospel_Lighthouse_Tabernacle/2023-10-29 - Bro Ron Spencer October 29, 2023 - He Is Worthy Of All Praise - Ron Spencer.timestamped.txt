[52:44] it's just not the killing that so much
[52:46] and so amen Revelations chapter 5 and I
[52:50] want to worthy of all praise today
[52:53] Revelations chapter 5 and we're a part
[52:56] of the scripture and I saw in the right
[52:58] hand of him that sat upon the throne a
[53:01] book written within and on the backside
[53:03] seal with Seven
[53:06] Seals and I saw a strange a strong angel
[53:09] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[53:13] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[53:15] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[53:19] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[53:22] able to open the book neither to look
[53:24] thereon
[53:25] and I wept much because no man was found
[53:28] worthy to open and to read the book
[53:31] neither to look thereon and one of the
[53:34] elders saith unto me weep not behold the
[53:38] line of the tribe of Judah the root of
[53:40] David ha prevailed to open the book and
[53:43] to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I
[53:46] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[53:48] and the four Beast and the in the midst
[53:51] of the elders stood a
[53:52] lamb as it had been slain have having
[53:55] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[53:57] seven spirits of God sent forth into the
[54:00] all the Earth and he came and he took
[54:03] the book out of the right hand of him
[54:05] that sat upon the throne and when he had
[54:08] taken the book and the for Beast and the
[54:12] four and 20 Elders F fell down before
[54:15] the lamb having everyone of them hearts
[54:18] and golden vials full of odors which are
[54:21] the prayers of the
[54:22] Saints and they sang a new
[54:26] song and this is our part and I'd like
[54:29] for you to read it with me saying Thou
[54:32] Art Worthy to take the book and to open
[54:36] the Seven Seals thereof for thou was
[54:38] slain and has redeemed us to God by the
[54:43] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[54:46] and people and Nation next verse and has
[54:49] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[54:53] and we shall reign
[54:55] upon the Earth let's pray Lord Jesus we
[54:58] love you today so good to be in the
[55:01] house of the Lord Lord we don't know
[55:03] what is going to be our last service and
[55:07] I just ask you that you would anoint our
[55:09] hearts and anoint our lips today I pray
[55:13] that not only as a speaker but also as a
[55:15] hearer strengthen Us in this this hour
[55:19] minister to us in a special way today in
[55:22] Jesus Christ's name we pray you may may
[55:25] be seated God bless
[55:28] you
[55:30] amen I'd like to talk to you as a pastor
[55:33] and also as a father just for a few
[55:35] minutes before I before I begin to
[55:38] preach any of you that are watching the
[55:42] news and I would say most of us are we
[55:46] realize that we're in a very in a very
[55:51] special time now for the Bride of Jesus
[55:54] Christ she's very
[55:56] aware we have tomorrow's
[56:00] newspaper and the reason that we have
[56:03] tomorrow's newspaper is because God sent
[56:06] us a message it came through a prophet
[56:09] Prophet is a sear of the word he is the
[56:13] voice to of God to that
[56:16] generation he posts the church on where
[56:19] we're at what is going to go on not just
[56:22] in the past and puts all the puzzle
[56:25] together but also takes the word and
[56:27] puts it into a new
[56:29] Administration and the bride is begins
[56:32] to begins to make herself ready and we
[56:36] begin to put the wedding dress on and we
[56:39] begin to place our we begin to take our
[56:42] place and we realize that we're the in
[56:45] the end of the Gentile
[56:47] dispensation this is the last days where
[56:50] the lsy is going to go right into the
[56:53] tribulation period and we realize that
[56:57] we've got to
[57:03] leave we got to leave we got to we we we
[57:08] we have come to the point to where the
[57:10] token is applied to our household we
[57:14] realize that the death angel has hit the
[57:16] denominational world we realize that
[57:20] people are confused Sodom is here the
[57:23] world leaders taken their place and
[57:26] they're doing their job militaries are
[57:29] rising and they're doing and they're
[57:31] saying all different kinds of things but
[57:33] if all of that be going on we eat the
[57:38] lamb we eat even the parts that are
[57:42] difficult for us to to eat but it's also
[57:46] an hour for prodal children to come
[57:49] home and uh we want to make sure that
[57:52] we've got everything
[57:53] ready now here's the part I want to talk
[57:56] to you as a father of this
[57:59] church listen if there's
[58:02] anything that is not right between you
[58:04] and
[58:08] God that standing between you and God I
[58:13] want you to get that
[58:14] ready get that taken care
[58:17] of if I could come to your home and sit
[58:20] down at your table as the prophet of God
[58:23] would do before communion he would go
[58:25] around and he say now get that right
[58:28] before you take communion get that right
[58:31] I'm not a prophet neither do I want to
[58:33] take brother brandom's place but I want
[58:35] to tell
[58:36] you we could be at the very
[58:40] end no man knows the day or the hour
[58:44] this isn't a play in time church we
[58:47] realize that every nation is coming
[58:49] against Israel even our
[58:53] nation leaders are saying the right
[58:57] things but our inner system of our
[59:00] nation our colleges our young people
[59:03] don't understand that they're under a
[59:07] spirit they're under a spirit that is
[59:10] leading this nation in a realm to where
[59:12] that it'll come against Israel and let
[59:15] me just say this to you it's
[59:18] prophecy it ain't a time for us to get
[59:20] in a political fight it's a time to put
[59:23] the dress on
[59:25] [Music]
[59:27] now if you remember just for a type for
[59:29] you
[59:32] elzer as a messenger as a type of of the
[59:37] messenger in this day he would go and
[59:40] the angel would go before him and
[59:42] Rebecca would would would would would
[59:46] actually receive the message and and she
[59:49] would tell her people I got to go with
[59:51] the man so she would leave her denominal
[59:54] system and and she would begin to make
[59:57] her way with elzer and on the journey
[1:00:01] the message would tell her what Isaac
[1:00:05] liked and he would tell her that this is
[1:00:08] how he wants you to dress and this is
[1:00:10] how he wants you to conduct yourself and
[1:00:12] this is what your future home is going
[1:00:14] to be like because we wasn't marrying
[1:00:22] elesar we were marrying Jesus
[1:00:25] Christ and so when they came to the
[1:00:28] certain spot there would come to a
[1:00:30] certain spot that they would come to to
[1:00:33] where elzer would would come over to a
[1:00:36] hill and in the field Isaac was standing
[1:00:41] there and she would know that that's
[1:00:46] him listen that's him that is Among Us
[1:00:51] now and we're not worship the prophet NE
[1:00:54] neither are we worshiping a man we're
[1:00:57] worshiping Jesus
[1:00:59] Christ and he that is Among Us he is
[1:01:02] worthy of all
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] worship are you with me he has taken the
[1:01:11] book and he revealed the seals That's
[1:01:13] History
[1:01:15] now that's history all the lucans have
[1:01:18] been tied together not to build another
[1:01:23] denomination that's right right not to
[1:01:25] even head headquarters in
[1:01:28] Jeffersonville but to present us and get
[1:01:30] us
[1:01:32] ready because it's him that is Among
[1:01:37] Us he's worthy of all your
[1:01:43] praise for anybody that's on the
[1:01:45] internet watching now we're not wanting
[1:01:48] to build the personality of a Ministry
[1:01:51] of a
[1:01:53] kingdom neither do we want to point you
[1:01:56] to different places in the Earth but I
[1:01:59] want to point you to the
[1:02:02] word and there's anything that that you
[1:02:05] just haven't applied just right
[1:02:08] yet go ahead and get that taken care
[1:02:12] of because he already knows you say well
[1:02:15] brother Ron but I'm so ashamed he
[1:02:17] already
[1:02:18] knows he already knows he's he he knows
[1:02:22] what's going on but if you remember
[1:02:25] there's a lot of things that we look in
[1:02:26] our Humanity that is so big to us we
[1:02:30] can't hardly get across it but when God
[1:02:33] looks at it he don't look at it like a
[1:02:34] man does you was a in a mess before God
[1:02:39] got a hold to
[1:02:41] you but he's we're not Catholics here we
[1:02:44] don't have to keep doing penants or qu
[1:02:47] keep paying for prayers listen we just
[1:02:50] thank him for our Grace and his mercy
[1:02:53] and we march on
[1:02:55] [Applause]
[1:02:57] are you with me now now let me just give
[1:03:00] you a little point of reference here
[1:03:03] when the angel came in a
[1:03:05] tree to brother brandham as a boy he was
[1:03:09] carrying water to his to his father's
[1:03:13] steel that was making making whiskey
[1:03:19] right now a lot of people might get
[1:03:21] tangled up on that but God didn't look
[1:03:24] where that water was
[1:03:28] going are you with me he wasn't looking
[1:03:31] at our past brother Roger he wasn't
[1:03:33] looking at the nonsense of our life he
[1:03:36] had a work for him to
[1:03:38] do don't don't never smoke or drink or
[1:03:42] all of those different kind of don't get
[1:03:43] tangled up in that I got a work for you
[1:03:46] to
[1:03:47] do now I want to say this to you we got
[1:03:49] to finish this
[1:03:51] thing and those things that are in your
[1:03:53] life that's just needs to be taken care
[1:03:56] of get it taken care of he's got a work
[1:03:59] for us to finish just
[1:04:02] now is that all right is that all
[1:04:06] right in John chapter 1 and verse one
[1:04:09] and in the beginning was the word and
[1:04:13] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:04:17] God yeah now so many times we get so
[1:04:19] tangled in that you was in the word
[1:04:23] right Hallelujah and we're identified in
[1:04:26] the
[1:04:27] word and and the same was in the
[1:04:30] beginning with God and the things all
[1:04:33] things were made by him and and without
[1:04:36] him was not anything made that was made
[1:04:39] in him was life and the life was the
[1:04:42] light of men and the light shineth in
[1:04:45] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[1:04:48] it not and there was a man that was sent
[1:04:52] from God whose name was John
[1:04:55] and the saying came for a witness to
[1:04:57] Bear witness of the light that all men
[1:05:00] through him might believe he was not
[1:05:04] that
[1:05:05] light but was sent to Bear witness of
[1:05:09] that light that was the True Light which
[1:05:13] lightthe
[1:05:15] world he was in the world and the world
[1:05:18] was made by
[1:05:20] him and the world knew him not he came
[1:05:25] unto his own and his own received him
[1:05:30] not but as many as received him to them
[1:05:35] he gave power to become sons of God even
[1:05:39] to them that believe on his name which
[1:05:42] were born not of blood nor of the will
[1:05:45] of the flesh nor of the will of
[1:05:48] man but of God you're an offspring of
[1:05:53] God
[1:05:56] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:05:59] among
[1:06:01] them oh don't you love the Lord and
[1:06:04] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[1:06:09] the glory as of the only begotten of the

[1:07:55] the Lord a good hand right
[1:08:03] there now Jesus was the highest

[1:08:16] Jehovah savior he is the fullness of the
[1:08:20] revelation of God that name has it all

[1:08:36] provider he is Jehovah Nissi he's my
[1:08:40] banner he is Jehovah rapi he said he's
[1:08:43] my healer
[1:08:46] everything let's just say it
[1:08:49] everything is in that one
[1:08:52] name
[1:08:54] he said Jesus the name the name that is
[1:08:58] highest of all
[1:09:00] names he is highest of all names go
[1:09:03] ahead and say it he is the highest of
[1:09:06] all
[1:09:07] names there is not a greater revelation
[1:09:11] of God than
[1:09:13] Jesus and from him comes all other
[1:09:18] Revelations if if Jesus Is God incarnate
[1:09:22] then Jesus is is the greatest name that
[1:09:25] has ever been
[1:09:28] revealed Matthew chapter Matthew chapter
[1:09:31] 1 and verse 21 and she shall bring forth
[1:09:34] a son and thou shalt call his name
[1:09:41] Jesus it was said by angels and the
[1:09:44] first time that his name comes across
[1:09:47] human lips a baby that's dead in the
[1:09:50] womb comes to life
[1:09:55] so let me just say don't fail to let
[1:09:58] that name come across your
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:01] lips because he is Jesus he is the
[1:10:05] savior he's my king he's my
[1:10:10] bridegroom Philippians chapter 2 verse
[1:10:13] 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee
[1:10:17] should
[1:10:18] bow of things in heaven of things in
[1:10:22] Earth of things under the Earth Jesus is
[1:10:25] the highest name of all names there is
[1:10:28] no other name given among men whereby we
[1:10:32] shall be
[1:10:35] saved are you with
[1:10:38] me acts 4 and verse 10 be it known unto
[1:10:43] you and to all people of Israel that by
[1:10:46] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:10:49] whom you crucified whom God raised from
[1:10:52] the dead even by whom do this man stand
[1:10:56] but here before you hold this is the
[1:10:59] stone which the was set at the KN at the
[1:11:02] Builders of the which has become the
[1:11:05] head of the corner neither is there
[1:11:07] salvation in any other
[1:11:13] name there is not another name under
[1:11:16] Heaven given among men whereby we must
[1:11:22] be sa sa
[1:11:26] D Matthew 28 and verse 19 go ye
[1:11:30] therefore and teach All Nations
[1:11:32] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:11:35] and of the son and of the Holy
[1:11:38] Ghost these are titles but when the
[1:11:41] Revelation come in the name of the Lord
[1:11:44] Jesus
[1:11:47] Christ that's how that's a scriptural
[1:11:52] baptism
[1:11:54] Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6 For unto us
[1:11:57] a child is born unto us a son is given
[1:12:01] and the government shall be upon his
[1:12:03] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[1:12:06] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[1:12:11] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:12:15] no none of those titles is his name but

[1:12:20] things in the name of Jesus wonderful
[1:12:24] counselor Mighty God Everlasting father
[1:12:27] Prince of Peace every bit of that is in
[1:12:30] the name of
[1:12:31] Jesus when you say Jesus he is wonderful
[1:12:35] when you say Jesus he is our counselor
[1:12:38] when you say Jesus he is a mighty
[1:12:41] God he is the Everlasting father he is
[1:12:45] the Prince of
[1:12:48] Peace father is not a name no more than
[1:12:52] wonderful counselor Prince of Peace
[1:12:55] Mighty God our Everlasting father
[1:12:56] there's no salvation in the name of
[1:12:58] Father Son and Holy Ghost you must know
[1:13:01] that the Holy Ghost is and if you don't
[1:13:04] know the Holy Spirit you're none of his
[1:13:07] right it is by the name of the Lord
[1:13:11] Jesus Christ that we're
[1:13:17] saved in Revelations chap 21 and verse 1
[1:13:22] and I saw a new Heaven
[1:13:25] and a new Earth for the first Heaven and
[1:13:28] the first Earth were passed away and
[1:13:30] there was no more sea and I saw the holy
[1:13:33] city the New Jerusalem coming down from
[1:13:36] God out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[1:13:38] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[1:13:41] great voice out of H Heaven saying
[1:13:43] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[1:13:46] he will dwell with
[1:13:49] them and they shall be his people

[1:13:58] future I like it when I read about
[1:14:01] myself don't

[1:14:06] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[1:14:08] no more
[1:14:10] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[1:14:13] shall there be any more pain for the
[1:14:15] former things are passed away and he
[1:14:18] that sat upon the throne said behold I
[1:14:20] make all things
[1:14:22] new and he said unto me right for these
[1:14:25] blessed these words are true and
[1:14:27] faithful and he said unto me it is done

[1:24:18] was a it was words out of Pilgrim's Pro
[1:24:21] progress
[1:24:23] it was talking about the Palace of a
[1:24:26] home that how you could go there and you
[1:24:30] could
[1:24:31] enjoy and you could feel
[1:24:34] refreshed and you could feel charged by
[1:24:38] the presence of
[1:24:40] God and he said brother
[1:24:43] Ron that's your
[1:24:47] home I I just was breathtaken by it this
[1:24:51] is your home
[1:24:52] he had taken quite a bit of time to to
[1:24:56] transcribe those words cuz it's
[1:24:59] definitely two full large
[1:25:03] pages and he pulled all that from
[1:25:05] Pilgrims Progress and I was just
[1:25:08] breathtaking God made my home be like
[1:25:11] that but I don't want just my
[1:25:18] home I want your
[1:25:21] home

[1:25:27] and
[1:25:30] stewing driving the spirit of God away

[1:25:37] time you could fall on your knees and
[1:25:39] begin to talk to God I'm not talking
[1:25:41] about just you but I'm talking about you
[1:25:42] and your
[1:25:46] wife how long has it
[1:25:49] been since you fell on your knees and
[1:25:51] you begin to pray and you felt the
[1:25:54] spirit of God come and sweep through the
[1:26:01] room oh brother Ron we were looking for
[1:26:04] Rapture are you
[1:26:07] ready are you
[1:26:09] ready because you need to have an
[1:26:11] atmosphere here to go
[1:26:16] there that's right are you ready
[1:26:19] remember in the air you don't change
[1:26:23] if if you die
[1:26:25] here that's what you'll be there if
[1:26:28] you're a liar here you'll be a liar
[1:26:30] there if you're a cheat here you'll be a
[1:26:33] cheat there let me just drop this to you
[1:26:36] you remember the rich man in
[1:26:40] Hell the rich man in hell he he had done
[1:26:43] a lot of things on earth that wasn't
[1:26:45] pleasing to God matter of fact he had an
[1:26:49] opportunity he came to Jesus
[1:26:52] right as a Rich Young
[1:26:55] Ruler but in hell he got religious let
[1:27:00] me go back and tell my brothers don't
[1:27:02] come
[1:27:07] here the angel told him he
[1:27:10] said Moses is there the prophets are
[1:27:16] there but they won't hear them they
[1:27:19] wouldn't hear
[1:27:21] you
[1:27:22] but I want to capture something
[1:27:25] here that man is
[1:27:27] still 2,000 years later is still in that
[1:27:36] torment he's still in that torment 2,000
[1:27:40] years have passed America's been
[1:27:43] discovered yeah we raise our flag we're
[1:27:47] only just a couple hundred years
[1:27:49] old but that man is still still in
[1:27:54] hell and the deal is it is not
[1:27:59] over he still got a long stretch to go I
[1:28:03] read a statement the other day from a
[1:28:06] from a famous preacher he said if we
[1:28:08] could just lift the lid of hell and and
[1:28:10] let people see he said our altars would
[1:28:13] be
[1:28:15] full but listen fear don't make you
[1:28:21] converted let me just say I don't know
[1:28:23] how many services are
[1:28:27] left the word of God should draw on your
[1:28:31] life when I'm saying this about your
[1:28:34] home don't live one way at work and one
[1:28:37] way at school in one
[1:28:41] way it's highly unlikely that the
[1:28:45] Rapture will happen here on Sunday
[1:28:48] morning it may happen that way and I'm
[1:28:51] not dis qualifying now but most likely
[1:28:54] somewhere between 600 and
[1:29:05] 9:00 I just want to say this to you I
[1:29:08] want to be
[1:29:11] ready but brother Ron I've been done a
[1:29:13] lot of ways in my life it don't matter
[1:29:15] that's just tough that's just stuff ask
[1:29:18] God to forgive whatever it is well
[1:29:22] brother Ron but I have a lot of things
[1:29:23] in my life it's okay it's just
[1:29:33] stuff you can tell that I'm not
[1:29:36] a I'm not
[1:29:38] a marathon runner you can tell
[1:29:43] that but I am a

[1:30:08] clothes that I can we walk with but if I
[1:30:11] was a marathon

[1:33:30] through that man he was a man that cried
[1:33:33] on Calvary my God my God why hast Thou
[1:33:36] forsaken me he was a man that he was
[1:33:38] cried for Mercy but on the third day

[1:42:51] one of the last people in the prayer
[1:42:53] line was a wife of a brother in church
[1:42:56] and she had taken on a spirit it's easy
[1:43:00] to take on a spirit negative Spirit
[1:43:02] comes along and before long it gets
[1:43:05] inside of
[1:43:06] you listen just because the spirit comes
[1:43:09] along you don't have to take it on
[1:43:11] somebody tells you something and you get
[1:43:13] in that spirit and you start getting
[1:43:15] negative and before long that Spirit
[1:43:17] controls
[1:43:19] you
[1:43:23] Hey
[1:43:25] listen you you watch a man it gets so
[1:43:27] old and he starts buying sports
[1:43:31] cars start dying his
[1:43:35] hair and he's he's feeling young again
[1:43:38] and he's he knows that he's not built
[1:43:40] for a
[1:43:43] 20 he's built for
[1:43:46] 50 and and you know he's changing his
[1:43:49] life but he takes on a spirit
[1:43:51] I can be young again well it ain't made
[1:43:53] to do that in this
[1:43:59] life does same thing to ladies they go
[1:44:02] through menopause if they're not careful

[1:44:05] spirit brother brandom tells us that I'm
[1:44:07] not telling you this brother brandom
[1:44:09] tells you that you take on a keep saying
[1:44:12] and they and they'll take on a spirit
[1:44:15] and if you're not careful that spirit
[1:44:17] will destroy
[1:44:19] you it can go to such a point to where
[1:44:22] you don't know your husband you don't
[1:44:25] know one
[1:44:28] another Pastor a friend of mine his wife
[1:44:32] got so bad she hated him every day she
[1:44:36] became
[1:44:38] bedfast he he waited on her hand and
[1:44:40] foot took care of her and she hated the
[1:44:44] ground and he knew it was a
[1:44:48] spirit and one day that spirit
[1:44:51] left she has said in this church
[1:44:54] multiple times you didn't know
[1:44:58] that she look like a pastor's wife she
[1:45:00] looks like a queen she looks like a you
[1:45:03] know Mrs
[1:45:04] perfect but you didn't know the war that
[1:45:09] she went
[1:45:12] through the war don't have to Define
[1:45:17] you the war don't have to Define you
[1:45:20] keep
[1:45:23] fighting that's why you got to have good

[1:45:35] you this girl was standing before us I'd
[1:45:38] say she probably she probably watch this
[1:45:40] so I got to be
[1:45:42] careful maybe
[1:45:44] 40 he said
[1:45:49] that she she locked eyes with
[1:45:53] me and when she locked eyes with me I
[1:45:57] knew I was dealing with a
[1:46:01] demon and she locked eyes and I knew I
[1:46:05] knew now it was going to take more than
[1:46:07] a
[1:46:08] man she was in the line because she
[1:46:10] wanted to be free of that she wanted to
[1:46:14] be free and she' came to the right
[1:46:19] place I
[1:46:22] knew that I needed more than
[1:46:25] myself but I also knew that I had have
[1:46:28] such a life inside of me that that Devil
[1:46:31] Couldn't call nothing out that's
[1:46:33] right come on now listen if you're not
[1:46:37] right that devil has a right to call you
[1:46:41] out listen that just should happen with
[1:46:44] brother brandham men of God we have a
[1:46:46] right to cast out Devils but you got to
[1:46:49] be right that's
[1:46:52] right and I just stood there for a while
[1:46:55] and I stood there and I stood there and
[1:46:58] I knew if I didn't get to the root
[1:47:01] cause of why this devil was
[1:47:06] there I'd never be able to help her was
[1:47:10] you
[1:47:13] there and in just a
[1:47:16] moment probably five
[1:47:19] minutes I said ' I see what it is you
[1:47:23] was molested at four years old and she
[1:47:27] crumbled I said you don't have to live
[1:47:29] under that thing you can be
[1:47:33] free and in a
[1:47:36] moment I'm talking about it in a
[1:47:39] moment greater than he that was in me
[1:47:43] amen spoke to the winds and the storms
[1:47:46] of her life and in a moment she was
[1:47:49] totally different
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:53] she came in the prayer line just a few
[1:47:55] weeks ago at brother Tim's a completely
[1:47:59] different
[1:48:00] atmosphere and I said I see that you're
[1:48:04] free hair was different her atmosphere
[1:48:07] was
[1:48:09] different because greater is
[1:48:13] he are you with me now greater is
[1:48:19] he
[1:48:25] the night that she got
[1:48:28] delivered they came and met
[1:48:31] me where I was
[1:48:34] sleeping and they shook that
[1:48:37] trailer I shook that trailer and I woke
[1:48:40] up to see a wolf's head with a lot of
[1:48:43] others that was with him and they shook
[1:48:46] that trailer and they screamed at me
[1:48:51] Andrew on the other end of the trailer
[1:48:54] heard the racket heard the
[1:48:57] noise and I looked at it knowing who I
[1:49:01] was even laying in the bed and I said
[1:49:05] you go to the
[1:49:08] river and go drown
[1:49:10] yourself in that River because the same
