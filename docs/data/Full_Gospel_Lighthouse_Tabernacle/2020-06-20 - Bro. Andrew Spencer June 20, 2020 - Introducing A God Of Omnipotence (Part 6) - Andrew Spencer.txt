need to make make known to you certainly privileged to have each and every one of you in the house of the Lord every every one of you so thankful so thankful so thankful to see sister Debbie Meadows back in the land of the living so god bless you and richly touch you tonight sister sister Debbie would love you follow heart every one of you and it's a it's an awesome honor to be in the presence of the Lord want to make a few things known to you due to all of the foreseen things that are that are coming and not not releasing us and different things that are still going on we have decided to postpone our fourth of July meetings this year and also our Labor Day meetings until we are able to hold a crowd and we don't know exactly when we'll set that date whether it's in the fall or wherever we're just postponing those things so we've got three great speakers that are that are just waiting for a phone call and so just be be mindful of those sayings just want to make those things known to you to be praying about those things and I'm just thankful that we can have service in this manner this evening also Lord willing in the morning we'll be having a baby dedication for sister Haven Hill and all that is due and depending on how our pastors feeling and the enemy pulled a slick one this evening and tried to punch him right before service and so he was on his way here and and just the enemy got mad and so we just want to be remembering brother on God would touch his body supernaturally just now and we know that the miracles coming and we know that it's on its way and we know Jesus is on his way and so we're studying our course according to his word not according to our emotions nor our feelings nor even how bad the situation's look in our lives we study our course to the Word of God for everything else around us is changing but his word remains the same a man as the as brother Matthew said at the end of the service the sisters have something set outside for you and that's for all the guys little boys myself included and I was I've got an inkling on what they are so I'll try to preach fast so I can enjoy it with you and and so we we just want to do that for Father's Day we want to enjoy this Father's Day it's coming up tomorrow and want to be mindful mindful of our Heavenly Father and also our earthly our father's here and truly we wouldn't be here without them and so we just want to make sure - to honor our fathers and we know that that gives us longevity of life and we do that we do that because it's a commandment to us and and we certainly love and appreciate every one of you fathers and soon-to-be father's and and we're just expecting expecting great things from the Lord and so cherish every day that you have with your family because every day is a present from the Lord and so cherish those things and I think I think times like we go through and we go through valleys that makes you appreciate the good times it makes you appreciate life and I believe that this church is very appreciative of all the things that we've been through and all the things that every one of us were truly a family and when one of us is hurting all of us is hurting and so so never feel alone because we're right there with you and we're in we're with you in the battle and sometimes you may not see us maybe you don't see a brother or sister but know that without a shadow of a doubt they're there praying for you upholding you by the word of prayer and we're just we're just a family we're a family of God and and we're so thankful to be called by his name a man I

more than able to do all things for you let's go to him and prayer this evening father we come and we approach your throne of grace boldly Lord realizing that you have released to us a portion of your mind Lord in this day that were standing in knowing that that all things have been released to us a father you've not dispersed stayed a new word father were added a word taken away anything father you've just released the unwritten water father would stand here as believers this true ordered of God Lord that's why we're here the same because we desire a portion of your your word to be deposited into our hearts father to take us further in our journey of life Lord we we don't understand that we can't see the future Lord you're already in it and you know how to release a word in this hour that'll take us through in our future and I pray that you would deliver the very the very thoughts of God to us tonight Lord where your children men were very needy and we just humbly request that you come the Lord you see ever need here you see our pastor the enemy has struck down and and may do this evening father I was reading over up reading over a statement brother Bannerman said he was standing there at a prayer line I was a man standing before him that was dealing with sugar issues the Branham tapped into that channel said thou demon of hell that is bounded with sugar if you don't release him may a double punishment come upon you father I don't know how to do that Lord but I ask on to you to release a double portion a hail towards the enemy that struck down our pastor father pray that you'd restore him back father for you bring him back Father Lord Jesus I pray that you would do the work that you promised that you would do now Lord Jesus every person sitting here under the sound of my voice father they've not come to hear me they're not that petty minded to think that I could speak to them on their needs but they have come because they have heard that there's a being a god that that's being introduced here from this pulpit and I pray father that here and that on the other side of the streaming that you would introduce yourself as the same yesterday today and forever we ask that you would take control of this service for the glory of the Lord and the Bride of Christ says they may bless you if you have your Bibles this evening we'll turn over to her to the book of Hebrews chapter 1 and verse 1 and then also down to 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 7 hebrews chapter 1 and verse verse 1 God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times passing to the father's by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 7 Paul says here but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in US but life in you we have in the same spirit of faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe in therefore speak therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak so if you believe you can speak these things knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our inward outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more and exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but of the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord so said would like to speak to you again on introducing the god of omnipotence and as we read here in the last verse verse 18 that while we look not at the things which are seen and it's very easy in the day that we're living in to get caught up with the things that we're seeing to get caught up with what the world is doing in the chaos that it's in and we realize that God has a law and that law is a law of contrasts that that we would not we could not understand we could not understand the daylight unless we had the nighttime and we could not understand the sunshine unless we had clouds and we could not understand health if we didn't have days with days of infirmity and days when we're sick but God is here in this hour and he's releasing to us and it's in the hour of extreme things in which God displays his his majesty and his wonders is when he shows forth or when we see things as he is declaring himself he's always God he's 100% of the time absolutely God but sometimes we get caught up with the things that we see and we get caught up with what we're looking at that we forget that God is always there but God it's in those moments or in those extreme measures of deepness of despair that when we truly see God as he truly is and we get our eyes off of the things that we're that we're looking at and we begin to look into another realm and to see the things that God is wanting us to see and we realize that the hour that we're living in is the darkest of days and we realize that that when brother Branham was preaching the seven church ages that he was drawing it out on the blackboard and brother Branham was allowed to draw in a certain amount of light in this last day and that light represented you and I and then those lights flashed on the wall to declare exactly what he had just spoken was thus saith the Lord and it was declaring that he was God so we realized that that we're living in an hour when things are the darkest that they could absolutely be there they're the darkest we look through the dark ages and we think my they're so dark but there's never been such a lukewarm spirit that the children of God have ever had to battle through like the day that we're living in and we see that when when the Prophet would stand there in Shalom he said you're seeing a facing or we're facing a mixture of light and darkness that the world is in the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in but yet it's standing in again the most blessed light that it's ever stood in so we see that we're living in a contrast of time that because because we're in this darkness we can understand that we're not of that darkness but we understand that light shines it's very best when it is dark outside you know it's the darkest right before the daylight begins to spring it gets so dark and it gets so miserable and you would think that nighttime is just continuing or just starting but when you are in those dark moments or in those dark valleys just know that there's light coming there's going to be moments in your life when you feel like God ain't around but just know that God is right there and if you can roll away the darkness you'll see the light of day it is the evening light and it's shining on the children of God now listen to this in 1965 of December the 12th at communion now this is the last service brother Branham takes and he speaks to us on communion now these now anybody knows that if you search out a man's life you look at his last words and and you watch as the Prophet is is speaking and he's uttering out these things because he knows that the that the end is in front of him and notice what he says here he said now there's one thing that I want to say just before we start the communion is this that I believe that we have seen enough in our day that we live in that we ought to really give all of our being to God that we should really serve God I believe that he has blessed us with the direct answer to the scripture as brother Perry gave it a few moments ago that that we are at that time that we're not blind we see that we're here we have arrived and we also can look around and see like the way that the human mind is leaving the people that's exactly where we're at that we can't stay too much longer or we'd be in a complete insane institution the whole world would be we're at the end time now here the prophet is relaying to us something that was there in 1965 but was declaring something that is very pertinent to you in 2020 it's a time when the human mind is escaping humans and they no longer have sense they no longer have common sense I've found in life that common sense is not very common but some people actually have to pay for that sense but we find where people are so in a neurotic state where they don't even realize who they are anymore don't realize what they were born to be don't realize what they were placed here to be they even can't even find their way in the right bathroom anymore but you are living in such a chaotic time that men don't know who they are and women don't know who they are but there's a people own hallelujah that knows exactly where they're standing that knows who she is and knows what he wants done with the word you see in this utter chaos there is a light that is shining and that man is here to turn on the light it's just like at the very beginning God is separating the light from darkness and it's an hour when we're not seeing we're not seeing an invisible God but we're seeing his visible presence made known to you and I now you may not see him but do not look at the things which you see look past what you see but here the visible presence of God is being made manifest where we're watching the works of the Son of Man when the word of God is being dispersed in this hour like never before this message has produced God's best do you understand what I'm saying that this message has produced the bride stress where and God is very at ease very till it's where he's not dilatory but he's very diligent in who he allows to speak to his wife and you are watching some now I'm not under saying that about myself I'm saying about the other men of God and I'm just thankful to be a part of that portion but you're seeing a people of God and ministers of God let's grab a hold of this word and to do a quick work for the Lord and you're watching it as men grab ahold of this message and take this message and go running like a never before you see this is the reality of the word made plain in view right in front of you and I this is not a message of reformation but this is a message of the full restoration of the Word of God you see that is exactly who we are we're full gospel people this scottsville that we preach to you is not a gospel that's full of holes it is a whole gospel now you can't pick out what you own and what you like and what you don't want but this is book that you have to eat the whole book well you asked me are you with me we're living in that hour when the Word of God is made restored it's completely restored and the fruit is at the top of the tree as we are told by Joe that in the last days that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh that we're living in this hour where all Israel no know that I am the Lord and I am in the midst of them and my people shall never be a saint now you've been standing in the last few months and you're living in a spot when everybody else is kind of kicked back and relaxed and enjoyed their self a time but you're living as a people that you kept the standard you kept the faith through the darkest of times you were still real men and women of God what was that that was him working on the inside of you hallelujah when you see churches being shut down or you see when you see men being shut down because of things that they're doing you are watching you are watching Satan at his very best but this is the hour of restoration that he'll bring out of that whole conglomeration a church that's blood walks that's a Bible Belt award solid bride of Jesus Christ I says here in Ephesian Church age that that he that hath an ear let him hear what they what the spirit saith unto the churches how tragic is it it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listen to man but thank God in the last days there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return hallelujah and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ oh give the Lord a hand clap oh please allelujah this message has done exactly that it has introduced us to our Lord Jesus Christ now we realize we realized that that there had to be a full running of Jesus in his first coming and that there's a second guy a forerunner that is coming before his second coming now we don't want to miss what is happening because they missed him in his first coming they miss the first runner the first floor runner and they again many have missed the second floor runner but we want to be diligent in our looking and diligent in our speaking and diligent in our praying that we don't miss what's happening now gardening just give us this message just to have another church or two maybe just make us huh hey people that's called out but he has to give us this message to introduce hallelujah the headship to a body and we realize that these things that are being relayed to us they have not come from some man's mind are you with me they didn't just edit just come out of some back study they came from the mind of God you look at the things that are happening there's no denomination that could create these things there's no there's no idea or theology that could tap into these sources or tap into that channel and come in and break those things out now I know that you think that I'm stuck on a treadmill and I keep speaking to you the same things but I'm trying to get something to you I'm trying to build you up and be rooted in the faith like Paul told us to be over in the book of Colossians I'm trying to tell you Church that there is one that is standing amongst you right now that is willing to move in your life if you just reach out and touch him blind bartimaeus reached out one day and his cry hallelujah got ahold of him it got ahold of the offer of life what was it he got the attention of Jesus tonight that your need so gets the attention of Jesus that Jesus comes walking down the aisle talks to you lip to ear and he speaks directly to your heart hello we don't want to miss what's going on we look at the things and so many times these stories they become stories to us when they're more than stories it's God showing you that I am in my creation and I'm making creation so many times we look over and we see when when brother Branham spoke those squirrels into existence and we just we take those things regret us but that was more can you imagine a denomination trying to produce that they can't do it they can't do it because they have not returned back to the pure word sure they want the restoration of gifts but they don't want headship but here we watch this event take place and now we wonder and we all had those things and think my how we would love just to create something sometimes but it was God showing forth his glory that it was deity in man speaking through a man you remember when brother Branham was standing there and speak to this mountain he said he had spoke most he said now what are you out here hunting he said squirrels he said well how many do you need and he said three now brother Branham said nice and I've done told those other two squirrels and spoke those other two squirrels where they would be and he said I was sitting there and I said well that's about enough actually he got a second one he said now that's enough he said it's about time for me to go and something said to me are you doubting that are you doubting what you spoke and he said no I'm not doubting that and he said he waited there another five or five or so minutes and he said well it's about time for me to get going and the angel said are you doubting what you spoke you said that there would be three are you doubting what you spoke and he said no and he said when I said that other squirrel came into existence right where I said it would be it was showing to you and I hallelujah that there was not just a man on earth that could create squirrels it was showing to you that if we could approach him with a faith that is not mixed up with some creed or some denominational idea but come forth in its shrewd pureness that he could speak to the mountain and the mountain be moved alleluia alleluia this was the creator in action through humanity now the bible jesus said himself speaking about john the baptist that there was not a man born of a woman that was greater than John the Baptist that's what Jesus said but Jesus follows that same to record and says he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he do you realize who you are this evening some of you said here and you think oh my I'm just happy to be laughs I made it through coronavirus but he hallelujah that is weakness or is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater well illusion I am trying to get you to see your possession in Christ hallelujah I know that some of you think that's all I preached but if you could ever find your position hello somebody I've heard it said well that brother on and brother Andrew say all they speak about is a believers position in Christ if you realize the believers position in Christ will take a body change I notice I sent this to the brothers I don't know if they got it or not but he said now the brother man said now I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into the sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been speaking of the squirrel since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon oh I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen now that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she'll raise up to her feet like a mighty marching army the sick will be healed by word the blind will see the death will hear the Dead will be raised up and the power of God was sake the whole world with the Church of the Living God were in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming to pass I believe he will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike the Church of God soon and it's going to start a revival that'll shake the world I believe it the Lord God of heaven who made heavens and earth who serve and I am and stand here now before you in the name of Jesus Christ those words are true oh we're near something my heart's waiting with anticipation so you can see the prophets anticipation of of this striking the church I want to say to you Church of the Living God we're here we have arrived we're not waiting for it to come it's here well I don't see it are you sitting in this church today there have been a people praying that this night would come you are here we have arrived there were not seekers of slides and seekers or wonders but we are told that signs and wonders will follow them that believe we're not out here searching for a sign in the hand looking for wonders or looking who can create and looking for that those things if you're a believer are to follow you so if I walk this way signs who wonders have got to follow me is there a church so if I preached the same message that Paul preached then signs and wonders have to follow me I don't follow them there in the church they're active they're moving and we're watching none other than Elohim declaring himself now if you look over in the Bible in Exodus chapter 6 you look there and you see that when when Moses is standing there having a conversation with God he tells him he tells him now I have declared myself as the Lord Almighty al-sharia to Abraham Isaac and Jacob but by my name Jehovah have I not declared my name he has not declared himself so God was telling them that I'm getting ready to declare myself as a name in a name that you've never seen before you see they had watched him as Jehovah Jireh they had watched him as hell said he either breasted one and he would bring them up to himself and they would draw from his bosom and draw strength from them but now he was getting ready to declare himself as the mighty deliverer they were in such a chaotic spot that they couldn't get out on their own but God had come down to show forth his power that he is Jehovah I believe he's still Jehovah how many is in the building tonight I noticed that when he came all of these titles were declaring a portion of who he is but when Jesus showed up two thousand years ago he embodied embodied all of those titles hallelujah he was declaring himself as Jesus that we are told that there's no other name under heaven on earth given among men whereby you must be saved but by the name of Jesus by the name of Jesus you can be set free by the name of Jesus you can be delivered by the name of Jesus you can be completely made whole there are miracles in his name there are way makings in his name there is deliverance there are all things in his name you remember brother Branham had to deal with with a nervousness in his own condition that he had he had dealt with it and they would come and it would he would come to him and it would completely come be completely tear him down and wear him down you remember those things that he would deal with those things that you remember that the Lord gave him a vision of this this little squirrel that was he said it was six inches long is that right you remember that exact thing but notice that the vision before was saying that brother Branham said no he said I was walking down the road he said I was walking down the road and he said I was kind of skipping along and shadowboxing as it were he said I was kind of shadowboxing and he set up on that road came on died he said out came a black dog running out from behind me and he's saying that came up from me and he said he made like he was going to bite me he said when he did he said I kicked at him and said get away you talk he said but when I said that that dog turned into a tall dark looking fellow that was dressed in black and that man grounded him and he said I'm going to kill you and brother Bantam said in the vision he said now I'm sorry sir I thought you were a dog I thought you were I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you a dog and that man screamed at him I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you and he said that man backed him up against the culvert on that road backed him up against the culvert on that road and grounded him and he said I'm going to kill you brother Bantam said I said in the vision I said in the vision now sir I'm not afraid to die Jesus Christ is my strength Jesus Christ is my protection and he said that man drove for that knife that he had like a saber blade he drove back and he said when he did there was a noise as it came from heaven and there came a mighty angel come and stood by my side and looked sternly at that man hallelujah look sternly at that man that man dropped his knife and moved back and took off running as hard as he could go now I know that that was stealing pertaining successfully with brother branham's the healing of his body but I want to tell you tonight Church of the Living God that there's a mighty angel that standing here and that dark spirit that's followed you of sickness that's followed you with diseases that's followed you with all of those things there's a mighty angel here to look sternly on that devil and they can't drop his knife and make him run hello church were here it's not coming he said you remember he said now there's been Church to search this bronze bronze but there's got to come one we're here we're here we're not looking for signs those signs are following us you remember we're a couple days ago when brother on how to win up to brother Eric since he normally goes in the fall time but this time they set up a meeting in May and they're in that meeting on the Sunday movie sisters sister Martha Eriksson I believe it's brother Eric's install her and came into the prayer line had been bit by tick and got Lyme disease and she was bound to a wheelchair you remember the story she was bailed to a wheelchair and they rode her a player she's second one I believe in the prayer line comes a player and all of a sudden that came that came a strength from God and she stood up but God wasn't finished yet brother on spoke to her say these words I will live and not die three times and when she spoke those things there came a wind that came a wind into that place and sister Martha started shouting all over the building what was it it was showing that God is Almighty that I am the lord that heals all of your diseases that there's nothing too hard for me no matter what you got no matter what you name it no matter what you call it i am the lord that heals you all of your diseases [Applause] we're here now you can make out your plans when you're going on vacation you can try to plan every little restaurant you're going to eat you're going to try to plan out where you going to do this certain things and there's gonna be plans that get messed up but there's not one plan of God that's been messed up just because you're in a certain situation does not change your predestination [Applause] hallelujah good to have y'all back now the Bible says here in Psalms 119 and 89 that forever O Lord thy word is settled in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all generations so he's still speaking to you thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou has to establish the earth and it abideth they continue this day according to that ordinance where all are thy servants the moon the stars all are his servants they continue to this day according to his ordinances now notice what the psalmist says unless the law had been my delights I should have perished in my affliction now think about that I think about a person it goes through a trial or goes through affliction that does not have the Lord and here the psalmist is telling you exactly that that unless the word of God have been is the light I should have perished in my affliction but I will never forget thy precepts for with them thou hast made me alive thou has quickened me with thy precepts now notice here in verse 18 on that word settled his render it means to set it means to put the place and then understanding the cause to set up it's settled it's stable I love it it's stable when you look at the children of God and you look at all their battles and you look at all their ups and downs it still did not change they went through some stuff you think you going through some stuff but they went through some stuff it did not change what the word said about them it did not change what God had spoke it was settled look past what you see are you with me so whose report are you going to believe are you with me you can believe the doctors report and that puts you in a grave or you can believe God's report and he'll bring out the green you see Satan is the author of confusion and the father of lies I do not want to believe in Lahaina be damned but I want to follow the prince of life the Prince of Peace the king of kings and the Lord of lords lobotomist a nerd I found this it's not it's not very very long when I come across this today I became so overwhelmed in my study that all I could do was cry mother bear I'm standing there in Zurich Switzerland he's in 1955 in a sermon Abraham he said not of you people that are along here sitting in these chairs and stretchers God loves you to me that's enough to me that's enough no matter matter what you go through God loves you no matter how good you feel God loves you no matter how bad you feel God loves you your people are here that are there longer here sitting in these chairs and stretchers God loves you now I could have walked out if I'm saying that mean I could've walked out right there I said thank you he said but no matter what is wrong with you if he's Almighty God he can do all things and if he can do all things if he cannot do all things then he is not Almighty God the brother Adam comes right behind this and he says there's not been a night when somebody's not got out of those wheelchairs or stretchers see God was coming behind it and vindicating it that he is see God no matter what's wrong with you God loves you close your Bible you can leave I don't know who it's for but God wants to tell you he loves you I love it I love being able to tell my wife I love her but when she tells me she loves me boy it does something to me but when God tells me God it's enough now the Bible says in Psalms 105 and 37 they're speaking when Israel had left Egypt he now the Bible says verse 37 II that he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes woo and there was not one feeble person among their tribes now if you look at it you'll see that there were six hundred men that were there and we know by theology and look at the history by what brother Branham said that there was two to three million people that were in the tribes of Israel that came out I love Egypt but when they came out there was not one feeble person among their tribes now if that was true for Israel under the law how much more true is that for you you that have been redeemed by the precious blood of the Lamb of God let this become a settled thought for you a settled truth for you that he is the Lord that heals all of your diseases that were soso means salvation it is not too different atonements it's the same atonement the same otomí that saved you it's the same otomí the hill the same otomí the hills you is the same atonement that delivers you hallelujah in the Old Testament two million people let's say 2 million people of God's people believed his word and it was spoken and every one of them was completely healed you remember what brother Brent said let's take a look at Moses of script back what was it what was it I am the Lord that heals all of your diseases you see two million people believed that's the only reason those Israelites became well and strong was that they believed what God said you see if you believe what God said you can speak what God has said hallelujah that when you're walking through the darkness of Alex I will fear no evil Wow for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they cook for me he's with you Church one scripture but we need a whole bundle of them is that Alright so many times we get so cast down but we're not destroyed but so many times I think search it over I got such an over they had one scripture they held on to that one scripture and Moses took the brass Serpent and set it before them and every one of them that looked on that brass serpent looked and lived why because there was an angel of healing that was on that pole hallelujah do you believe that there's a healing angel that is still here he's still here you remember with other lamps off of that little girl who down there that blind girl had those cataracts and she lost her daddy and she's going around there and when there was a time of crisis of racism like never before and they were separating them White's world miss not blacks were on that side but yet there was a profit that walked over there on that side and he heard her screaming daddy daddy he said what's wrong with you honey she said I can't find my daddy I came here to see my healer I heard about that man from Kent in Missouri that was blinding his eyes and was completely made whole and brother Balaam said I played the part of a hypocrite for a minute he said do you believe that there's an angel of healing that is coming this generation she said yes I do if you get me to the healer I'll find my daddy oh if we could just get to the healer tonight it's not to get to brother on not to get to brother Branham not to get to brother Andrew not to get to brother to him not to give to brother Bisco not to get to brother Regan but to get to the healer I'm not just talking about physical healing I'm talking about mind healing spiritual healing Oh body healing you really believe there's an angel of healing come to this generation well if he's still the same yesterday today and forever that means he's here so if he's here I can expect him to do the same thing that had done then right now Alleluia notice in acts 5 8 and 5 that when Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ on them notice what he preached Christ and the people with one Accord gave heed to those things which Philips fake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with a loud voice came out many that were possessed with them and many taken with policies and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that city Jesus proved he proved that he was exactly the same God working through Philip when Philip went down there preached Christ Jesus was so and that he's still the same and if Jesus is preached in the same it's gotta be received as the same I wonder fares are people that's willing to receive a Christ that heals a price i Christ that delivers a Christ that sets free the early church tapped into a channel they tapped into a channel and when they got in that channel I was I'm speaking brother gay who yesterday when you go will you get somebody in the channel you get some buy-in channel telling Soros they'll get in that channel and they'll start releasing stories that's not releasing stories and when you can get in the channel of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost who go to releasing himself you see if you can go to pulling on the gift of God you'll pull me into that channel and you'll pull yourself into that channel and God will draw nigh to you and you'll draw nigh to God and you'll get in the channel with one mind and you'll watch God own discipline now let me get where I'm going I know this is hurting I know it's hurting Satan's Kingdom so let's just give it to him let's stop a mud hole in him that I review country talk okay with you that's what you go get country talk we know second Corinthians 4 and 13 says that we have in the same spirit of faith according as it is written written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe in therefore speak so when a believer is standing in his position he stands there in the opposition of all things against all odds he stands firm because he's a believer and he stands there with that badge of authority on him knowing that it's not the name of the nomination nor the name of a church but it is resurrection of Jesus Christ personally in an individual life you know you know that police officer can stand down there stand down there at that roadside and he can stand there with that badge and he's got the authority to stop cars and pull over cars and do things because he has the badge of authority home you see what he says the whole city is behind him he ain't got no power to stop him cars down there he ain't got the power to stop a tractor-trailer Deborah might look like it but he can't stop a tractor-trailer but he's got the authority to do that that's what the believer does when they stand in their position they stand there and they have the authority to do so in the name of Jesus Christ and that is why Satan is so upset tonight that we don't come to him with power but we come to him with the authority the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Satan goes to screaming and goes to hollering because you are in your authority that police officer ain't got no strength in his own ain't got no hand got no power in his own to do it but he's got the authority to do that but I want you to take a look out on your nation tonight look out there your nation and you see a nation that's in turmoil a nation it's in chaos Annie I got a nation that is so completely disrupted that they're one to rob the authority away from the policeman they're wanting to take away his authority wanting to take away his privileges to under take away his rules they're trying to strip him of his authority you're living in an hour when the badge of authority is being disrespected like than ever before I was raised and taught that that badge represented a power it represented a government that had the authority to do what they wanted to with me if I broke what they said they could put me in jail but you're looking out of people that so disrespect the bags of authority they break the Constitution they break what they put in their loss just to please somebody and you look at along the churches the day they change the rules of the Bible just to please somebody hello you look at Satan that so disrespects you in your position brother Stephen that he wants to rob you of your job rob you of your health rob you of your strength he so disrespects you or who you are because he hates who you represent but don't you dare let nobody rob from you who you are and what you're meant to be shaken Satan can disrespect you all he wants to and that these cities they can back off of their promises back off the shields back off what they said but God is not backing off of his badge of authority to the believer hello he used to be the whole city was behind that badge now nobody's behind that badge everybody's saying oh I'd hate to be a policeman right now it takes a man of real gumption to stand in that position to be a real man we got a lot of police officer sitting in this church and I thank the Lord for them hear me loud and clear here and on the Internet I think the Lord for Holy Ghost field cops [Applause] [Music] somebody comes breaking in your home who you gonna call call the pastor he'll pray maybe he'll stop the robber what if you can't get hold to me the Matthews a natural-born protector that's what his name means is a protector but what if I can't get ahold of him and somebody's breaking in here Who am I gonna do I know what I'm gonna do I won't get on there I'm gonna get on that night but you look at people and they standard I think oh my oh my let's strip let's strip the people their authority let's strip the people of who they are let shrimp the people of what they represent that is the same thing that Satan is trying to do to believer he's trying to strip you and rob you from your peace robbed you from your joy robbed you from your happiness robbed you from your health robbed you from your pastor Rob you from your worship I'm sick and tired of shaking disrespecting the bride of Jesus Christ let's stand in our authority and cast Satan out and shake Satan I apply this token take your sickness and go back to Hell where you came from he did not ask you to be strong in yourself but to be strong in the Lord Paul said they're second Corinthians 4 I believe first read our second Timothy 4 he said that when no man would stand with me the Lord stood with me there's going to come a time young people old people everybody sitting here there's going to be a time when people won't stand with you but the Lord is staying there the Lord will be right there he'll protect you he'll guide you he'll heal you you'll minister to you now we know that certain things in life is going to take a miracle is that right we know that there's things that we come up against in life that we need a miracle well if we need miracles and he's still God he's got to show up I'm not forcing his hand but I am only introducing a God of omnipotence to you it's a time that you stand there in your authority stand there as a believer and say you know what I'm sick and tired of Satan robbing me of hearing my pastor I'm sick and tired of Satan robbing me I'm being able to worship in spirit and in truth I'm sick and tired of living in this whole world it's a time that you stand there and you display the badge of authority the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you say down with you Satan oh let God arise hole a god or a hush too long we've been holding him behind too long we've been holding him back too long we've been letting him letting him just stand there and be preached to us from the pulpit I wish there'd be somebody here tonight say no longer it's a time that we start speaking to this scar it's a time that we start ministering to this God and invoking this God I believe therefore I speak look at your neighbor say I believe therefore I speak like the musicians come give the Lord a hand clap of
