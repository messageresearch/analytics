[25:21] like they say to me.
[25:26] They try to change my name. told me who
[25:29] I was born to be. My heart was racing,
[25:32] raging in the world that doesn't seize.
[25:36] It always fights
[25:41] my own miles.
[25:46] They can't have my soul. No, I will bow
[25:49] my knee. When the world's crashing down,
[25:53] another stands with me
[25:56] in the fire. I wonder what they'll do

[26:04] there too.
[26:09] [Music]
[26:16] He led me down through the town and
[26:19] brought me dinner to our king. The only
[26:22] king that I fear is he who lives in me.
[26:27] He can save me from the flames.
[26:32] And if he don't, I'll burn for him. They
[26:37] can't have my soul know I'm bow my
[26:40] knees. When the world is crashing down,
[26:44] another stand of me
[26:48] in the fire. I wonder what they'll do
[26:52] when they see with their eyes. There's
[26:55] nothing there too.
[26:58] They grabbed my wrist and clenched a
[27:00] fist and threw me in those flames.
[27:04] On my shoulder was the hand of another
[27:07] man.
[27:09] He said just five words.
[27:13] [Music]
[27:14] I'm there
[27:16] through the worst.
[27:20] [Music]
[27:30] Taking out my soul. Oh, I'm about my
[27:33] knees. When the world is crashing down
[27:37] another stand with me
[27:41] in the fire, I wonder what they'll do
[27:45] when they see with their eyes. There's
[27:48] nothing in there too. They can't have my
[27:52] soul know I'm will bow my knee. When the
[27:57] world is crashing down, another stand of
[28:00] me
[28:02] in the fire. I wonder what they'll do
[28:06] when they see with their eyes. There's
[28:09] nothing there to

[29:17] and pray this for you. I pray for your
[29:21] healing,

[38:29] of God on my life.

[39:24] in the dark.

[39:39] I've known you as my friend
[39:44] and I have been
[39:48] in the goodness
[39:50] of God.
[39:57] And all my life you have been faithful.

[40:43] [Music]
[40:47] And all my life you have been so so good
[40:57] with every breath that I have made.
[41:03] Oh, I'm going to sing
[41:07] of the goodness
[41:10] of God.
[41:16] Cuz your goodness is running after. It's
[41:20] running after me.
[41:25] Cuz your goodness is running after. It's
[41:30] running after me.
[41:34] With my life laid down, I'm surrendered
[41:38] now. I'll give you everything.
[41:42] [Music]
[41:45] Your goodness is running after. It's
[41:50] running after me.
[41:55] And all my life you have been faithful.
[42:00] [Music]
[42:05] And all my life you have been so so
[42:12] good.
[42:16] With every breath that I am able,
[42:24] I will sing
[42:27] of the goodness
[42:30] of God.
[42:33] Father,
[42:35] there's something so special about that
[42:37] song.
[42:39] Lord, we every time we sing it, it seems
[42:42] like there's just a nearness of the Holy
[42:44] Spirit that comes.
[42:47] Father, it is a testament to every
[42:49] single one of our lives.
[42:52] When David was writing that in the
[42:53] Psalms, I believe he tapped into every
[42:56] single one of our lives. Father,
[42:59] Lord, we can truly point back time and
[43:01] time again that we've seen the goodness
[43:03] of the Lord shone on our life. And
[43:06] Father, we are gathered here tonight,
[43:08] Lord. Your children, we've come here,
[43:11] Lord, expecting a move of the Holy
[43:13] Spirit in our lives, Lord. Lord, for the
[43:16] word of God to come and meet us where we
[43:18] are, Lord, to take us from a little
[43:21] bitty acorn into a great big tall oak
[43:24] tree, Father. Lord, I pray that tonight
[43:27] that we would not walk over the
[43:29] seedlings that are continually growing
[43:31] up, but may we recognize the greatness,
[43:34] the potential, the opportunities that
[43:37] are here tonight. Lord, I I look out
[43:40] across this building tonight and I see
[43:42] all of the ye these people. They're your
[43:44] children, Father. And Lord, I count it
[43:47] such an honor to be speaking to your
[43:49] wife. And I pray Lord tonight that you
[43:51] would just move this this servant aside
[43:53] and you would begin to use me, Father,
[43:55] for your glory. Lord, I have nothing to
[43:58] give except my all. I give you the gift.
[44:03] I give you my life. I give you my
[44:05] spirit, Father. And Lord, I I've spent
[44:08] much time in prayer today and study,
[44:11] Lord, just looking unto you. And Lord, I
[44:13] pray that you would take, Lord, these
[44:15] humble words, Lord, that I have been
[44:18] able to study and look over and put
[44:20] together some thoughts, Lord, feeling
[44:23] inspired by the Holy Ghost. And I pray
[44:26] that you would get under the inspiration
[44:28] of your people just now. And we would
[44:30] just begin to move as one body, Lord,
[44:32] one unit, Father. Lord, may we focus our
[44:35] attention on this word, Father, that we
[44:37] would see you high and lifted up,
[44:39] Father. God, we are committed to your
[44:42] word. We're committed to this rapture,
[44:44] Father. And I pray, God, that you would
[44:47] just allow us the opportunity just now
[44:50] to worship you while the word goes
[44:51] forth. We love you so much. And we give
[44:55] you this service in Jesus name. Amen.
[44:58] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[45:00] the Lord this evening. If you have your
[45:02] Bibles, like to go to Luke chapter 2 and
[45:05] verse 41 and Hebrews chapter 12 and
[45:10] just take a little thought here tonight.
[45:12] We want to welcome all of our our
[45:13] visitors and our guests here tonight.
[45:15] There we got uh quite a host of
[45:17] believers here tonight. We we've
[45:19] gathered them from the east and the west
[45:21] and the north and the south. And we just
[45:23] want to make make sure that everybody is
[45:26] uh welcome here tonight. Brother Chad
[45:28] from Brother Mark Spencer's church want
[45:30] to say God bless you and your family and
[45:32] brother Christian, sister Maddie,
[45:34] they're here celebrating two months of
[45:35] marriage and and we're happy to have
[45:37] them here and he can't wipe the smile
[45:39] off of their faces. So, and uh also want
[45:43] to welcome uh brother Sam Borlavon and
[45:46] his family and God richly bless you. I
[45:48] hear you've had a wonderful time with
[45:49] your brother here and your sister here
[45:52] this week and if you can't have a good
[45:54] time with brother William, you're just
[45:55] not able to have a good time. It's just
[45:57] how it is. And also our our family from
[46:00] up north, brother Aiden, Aiden Horst
[46:03] here. God bless you. A dear friend to us
[46:05] and have a very very special memory that
[46:09] we we share. And uh
[46:14] well, of course, Brother Ron has a very
[46:16] special memory with him, but I have a
[46:17] very special memory with him because my
[46:19] wife and daughter decided to go have
[46:21] dinner at their house one day. and and
[46:24] uh they had a little dog out there and
[46:27] Ally was just just rambunctious as she
[46:29] is. Spitfire.
[46:31] She comes back in there. Everybody's
[46:33] sitting around the dinner table. She
[46:34] said, "You're not going to believe this,
[46:35] Mom. That dog just licked his rear end
[46:37] and then kissed me."
[46:41] So, it is a story that we will always
[46:43] share together.
[46:47] They say that's the cleanest kiss you
[46:48] can get is from a dog.
[46:52] We have a testimony to beg difference.
[46:54] So,
[46:56] Amen.
[46:57] And also, Brother Steven and Sister
[46:59] Amanda, God richly bless you. They're
[47:01] expecting a child and and uh they're
[47:04] very excited. I got a phone call a few
[47:06] days ago now, and I believe it's okay.
[47:08] Is it okay if I share that? They're
[47:10] they're expecting a little girl. So, so
[47:12] God richly bless you. Amen. Ain't it
[47:15] good to be a Christian?
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hebrews chapter 12 and verse
[47:20] one.
[47:22] Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[47:25] about with so great a cloud of
[47:27] witnesses. Let us lay aside every weight
[47:30] and the sin which does so easily beset
[47:33] us. And let us run with patience the
[47:36] race that is set before us. Looking unto
[47:39] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[47:41] faith, who for the joy that was set
[47:45] before him endured the cross, despising
[47:48] the shame, and is sat down at the right
[47:51] hand of the throne of God. Also Luke
[47:54] chapter 2 and verse 41.
[47:57] also want to w uh wish our my
[48:01] grandmother uh sister Nancy a very happy
[48:04] birthday today. And uh she's such a
[48:06] special lady.
[48:11] She's such a special lady that she gets
[48:14] two days for her birthday.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:17] The doctor wrote it down on the 19th and
[48:20] and uh but her mother said it's the
[48:22] 20th. So So she gets two days like a
[48:25] queen does. So we just we love we love
[48:28] our our sister Nancy so much. Amen. Luke
[48:32] 2 and verse 41.
[48:34] Now his parents went to Jerusalem every
[48:37] year at the feast of the Passover. And
[48:40] even when when he was 12 years old, they
[48:42] went up to Jerusalem after the custom of
[48:45] the feast. And when they had fulfilled
[48:47] the days as they returned, the child
[48:50] Jesus terried behind in Jerusalem.
[48:53] That's a very powerful thing to forget.
[48:56] Amen.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Is Jesus.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And Joseph and his mother knew not of
[49:01] it. But they supposing him to have been
[49:03] in the company went a day's journey, and
[49:06] they sought him among their kinsf folk
[49:08] and acquaintances. And when they found
[49:10] him not, they turned back again to
[49:12] Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to
[49:14] pass that after 3 days they found him in
[49:16] the temple, sitting in the midst of the
[49:18] doctors, both hearing them and asking
[49:21] them questions. And all that heard him
[49:25] were astonished at his understanding and
[49:28] answers. And when they saw him, they
[49:30] were amazed. And his mother said unto
[49:32] him, Son, why hast thou dealt with us?
[49:36] Thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father
[49:38] and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he
[49:41] said unto them, How is it that ye sought
[49:43] me? Wis not that I must be about my
[49:46] father's business? And they understood
[49:48] not the saying which he spake unto them.
[49:51] May God bless his word. You may be
[49:53] seated here tonight in the presence of
[49:55] the Lord. I'd like to just continue a
[49:58] little thought that that was on our
[49:59] heart a couple weeks ago on our focus is
[50:03] the message of the hour. Our focus is
[50:06] the message of the hour. And to me, when
[50:08] you begin to study, there's many
[50:10] characters that you can study and many
[50:12] that you can identify yourself with. But
[50:15] to me, my favorite character in the
[50:17] Bible is our Lord Jesus Christ. And when
[50:20] you begin to study out Jesus's life,
[50:22] it's such a very powerful a very
[50:25] powerful character that you begin to
[50:26] read that you realize immediately that
[50:29] there's something special about this
[50:31] little bitty boy. And you begin to you
[50:33] begin to witness everything about his
[50:35] birth. And you begin to witness that
[50:36] there's great men that come at his
[50:38] birth. And there's great men that come
[50:39] to him when he's a child. And and
[50:41] shepherds are called and and then you
[50:43] begin to look at Jesus's life. And you
[50:45] begin to look at the whole of Jesus's
[50:47] life. And Jesus's life was very short.
[50:50] It was only 33 years that we recognize
[50:53] that Jesus was lived here. And Jesus
[50:56] made a very powerful statement in John
[50:58] chapter 9 and verse four. He said, "I
[51:01] must work the works of him that sent me
[51:04] while it is day. The night cometh when
[51:07] no man can work." And we realize that
[51:09] when Jesus is standing there and he is
[51:11] saying this, he said, "I must be about
[51:14] my father's business." And he is saying
[51:16] unto us that we've he we've got to
[51:19] realize that Jesus had one purpose.
[51:22] Jesus was not here to bring peace, but
[51:24] he was here to bring a sword. And we
[51:26] realize that when Jesus came here, he
[51:29] was completely different than any other
[51:30] prophet that had ever stepped upon the
[51:33] face of the earth. This was God embodied
[51:35] on the inside of human flesh. The reason
[51:39] why he knew all things was because he
[51:41] before he was flesh, he was the word.
[51:44] Now Solomon would say in Ecclesiastes
[51:47] 9:10 that whatsoever thy hand findeth to
[51:51] do, do it with thy might. For there is
[51:53] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor
[51:56] wisdom in the grave, in the grave where
[51:58] thou goest. And Solomon and and Jesus
[52:01] are both emphasizing unto us that we
[52:04] only get one chance at this life. We
[52:06] only get one opportunity while we're
[52:08] here. We only get one shot. So Jesus is
[52:11] saying unto us and Solomon is saying
[52:13] unto us that we've got to stay focused
[52:16] that we've got an objective that is out
[52:18] before us and we've got to be busy about
[52:21] the father's business. When Elijah is
[52:24] working and he is coming to the end of
[52:26] his ministry and he's getting ready to
[52:28] lay out his uh his portion over on the
[52:31] next ministry. He goes out and he finds
[52:34] Elisha and he's out there working in a
[52:36] field. And you remember what the
[52:37] scripture said about Elisha that Elisha
[52:40] was very careful when he was out there
[52:42] to make sure that all of the all of the
[52:45] field and all of the the plow everything
[52:47] was straight and in line. And when
[52:49] Elijah saw that there was a workman that
[52:52] was worthy that he be to throw his
[52:54] mantel over on top of him. He found
[52:57] somebody that could stay focused in what
[53:00] they were doing and had an attention
[53:01] span to make sure that they were in
[53:04] line. You find that when Jesus comes and
[53:06] he starts picking his disciples, he
[53:09] starts picking Andrew and Peter and the
[53:11] different ones that had different
[53:13] occupations. Some of them were tradesmen
[53:15] and some of them were fishermen. Some of
[53:17] them their occupation was unknown. But I
[53:20] find this immediately that Jesus finds
[53:22] them while they are working. He does not
[53:25] find them out there sunbathing. And he
[53:27] does not out they doesn't find them out
[53:28] there buming on the street or sitting
[53:30] there waiting for their welfare check.
[53:33] He simply finds them working. So God is
[53:36] not calling a bum, but God is calling
[53:38] somebody that is willing to work for the
[53:41] kingdom of God that is not ashamed. So
[53:43] God is not going to take something out
[53:46] of he's not going to make something.
[53:48] He's going to use your past to be a part
[53:51] of your future. You see, when he picks
[53:53] up Peter, he Peter was a fisherman.
[53:57] Peter was a fisherman. He was he was the
[53:59] kind of man that taught other men how to
[54:01] fish. He was a kind of man that had had
[54:04] a good business. He had worked he had
[54:06] worked alongside with with Peter. He had
[54:08] worked alongside with his brother
[54:10] Andrew. And many of times you'll find it
[54:12] in the scriptures that he worked
[54:14] alongside with James and John. But when
[54:16] Jesus begins to call him to his own
[54:19] ministry, he said, "You just come over
[54:21] here and you follow me now." Begin. You
[54:25] watch what Jesus tells him. You're
[54:27] getting ready to stop fishing, but I'm
[54:29] going to make you a fisher of men.
[54:31] Notice he was getting ready to change
[54:33] his occupation, but he was going to use
[54:36] the same process that Peter had used of
[54:39] casting out the net. Peter was simply
[54:41] going to take that same thing that he
[54:44] had been built up and everything that he
[54:46] had been in his past of showing how to
[54:48] throw the net on this side or on that
[54:51] side. He was simply going to throw the
[54:53] gospel net now. And notice it was the
[54:56] same effort. It was the same attention.
[54:58] It was the same job occupation. But the
[55:01] results were going to be completely
[55:03] different.
[55:05] A lot of you have went to church
[55:06] throughout your life, but when you come
[55:08] to the message, the results were
[55:10] different. Things might look the same,
[55:13] buildings might look the same, churches
[55:15] might look the same, but the thing that
[55:17] is so powerful about this message that
[55:20] we've got to focus on is the results
[55:22] that come from it.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's amazing when you
[55:28] study Jesus's life.
[55:31] It is not necessarily
[55:33] how long that you live because Jesus
[55:36] didn't live a very long life, but what
[55:38] matters in what you accomplish in this
[55:41] life. It matters what you do with the
[55:44] life that you've been given. And you
[55:46] notice when Jesus goes to the silent
[55:48] years from 12 to 18, you'll notice that
[55:51] those years were not wasted. You don't
[55:53] know much about Jesus in the silent
[55:56] years, but I'd say it like this that
[55:58] Jesus was crafting his ministry in those
[56:01] moments. He was building relationships.
[56:04] He was praying for people. He was
[56:06] showing people what his job was here to
[56:08] do. His silence was not wasted.
[56:11] Hallelujah. His silence was not wasted.
[56:15] So you see, it isn't the longevity of
[56:18] it, but it's how you run and how focused
[56:21] that you are. Jesus when he is standing
[56:23] there, he's got friends around him. He's
[56:26] got critics around him. He's got mockers
[56:29] around him, people that love him and
[56:31] recognize he is the Messiah. But Jesus
[56:34] is not worried by the crowd that is
[56:36] surrounding him. Jesus is simply
[56:39] occupied with this one objective and
[56:42] that is to get the message out.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; To get the message out. And to me that
[56:50] is what makes the message of the hour so
[56:53] pertinent and so powerful is that we
[56:56] realize that this message did not come
[56:58] to lift up a man but this message came
[57:01] to make Christ the principal theme of
[57:04] our life of our testimony of our shout
[57:07] of everything that we are. The message
[57:10] did not come and I I realize that the
[57:12] message is harsh for some people. I
[57:14] realize that the message of the hour
[57:16] ruffles some feathers as it as it were,
[57:19] but I realize this is that this message
[57:22] is none other than Jesus Christ.
[57:26] And it might ruffle some feathers, but I
[57:28] say this that if you're a true eagle,
[57:31] the reason why it is ruffling your
[57:33] feathers is so that you can fly higher.
[57:39] The message didn't come to build a
[57:40] creed. The message didn't come just to
[57:43] build another church. There's been a lot
[57:45] of beautiful churches. There's been a
[57:47] lot of great ideas. There's been a lot
[57:48] of a lot of revelation that came from
[57:51] God. But there was nothing like the
[57:53] message of the hour. There is nothing so
[57:55] powerful in this generation like the
[57:58] message of the hour. Or Roberts had some
[58:01] powerful things to say. Aa Allen had
[58:03] some powerful things to say. Billy
[58:05] Graham had some powerful things to say.
[58:07] But that ain't my focus. I am focused on
[58:10] one thing and that is the message of the
[58:12] hour. Because I realize this that the
[58:15] angel of the covenant accompanies the
[58:18] message always. And if I preach what
[58:20] William Brandon preached, then that same
[58:22] angel
[58:25] has got to accompany the message of the
[58:28] hour.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; This message didn't just build bigger
[58:34] buildings. Actually, our churches are
[58:36] smaller than a lot of the denominations.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; But I will stack up our our quality
[58:42] against numbers.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; But what's so powerful is not the
[58:47] numbers that you see. It's not the
[58:49] buildings that you see, but it is our
[58:52] mindset that has been changed because it
[58:55] changed us from a chicken mindset to an
[58:58] eagle mindset. It take us it took us to
[59:01] a heavenly it took us to a heavenly
[59:04] mindset. Maybe maybe say it like this a
[59:07] kingdom mindset
[59:10] &gt;&gt; because we realize that the prophet
[59:12] would teach us about dimensions that
[59:13] there's a blending of dimensions and he
[59:16] would tell us that a Christian operates
[59:18] in that realm. Now notice what
[59:20] brotherham does here in in 1955 in the
[59:24] glorify Jesus. He said, "Now say here's
[59:26] a line like this, and in there is where
[59:29] all mortals live. On this side or that
[59:31] side, men are influenced by one side.
[59:34] This side comes from God, and that side
[59:37] comes from the devil." He said, "Now,
[59:39] let's just take that. It is a great
[59:42] conglomeration of blackness and gaity
[59:44] and muck and sin and divisiveness of
[59:47] this world. And every once in a while,
[59:49] you'll see a little white spot." He
[59:51] said, "That's a Christian like a light."
[59:54] He said, "Now those that are in the
[59:56] darkness are influenced from beneath,
[1:00:00] but those that are light are influenced
[1:00:03] from above." Now, when you leave either
[1:00:07] when you leave either one of these
[1:00:08] channels, you go into the realm of the
[1:00:10] spirit. This is the mortal realm, the
[1:00:13] dimensions that we live in. So, what
[1:00:16] happened? You look like everybody else.
[1:00:19] You can even dress like everybody else.
[1:00:21] But there's something that is completely
[1:00:24] different about you. It is a it is that
[1:00:26] you have been given eyes of the spirit.
[1:00:30] You have been given a kingdom mindset
[1:00:32] that you're you are focused on the
[1:00:35] eternal. So what makes you so different
[1:00:39] is that you are looking through the lens
[1:00:42] of revelation to only see the word.
[1:00:46] That is the major difference between
[1:00:49] between elect and non-elect because you
[1:00:52] can be looking at the same thing that
[1:00:54] everybody else is
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; but you could be seeing something
[1:00:57] different than anybody else is seeing.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; It's because you have been elected to
[1:01:04] look through the lens of Revelation just
[1:01:07] like Elijah and Gahhesa when they looked
[1:01:10] out there and he seen all the enemies
[1:01:12] that was out there in front of him.
[1:01:14] Elijah simply prayed, "Lord, open up his
[1:01:17] eyes." Notice Brother Brandham said them
[1:01:21] angels was already there, but he simply
[1:01:24] changed his eyesight so that he could
[1:01:27] see.
[1:01:29] Hallelujah. Do you realize this? That
[1:01:31] the message of the hour has always been
[1:01:34] here. It's been for you. The revelation
[1:01:38] has been here. But it took a star
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; that was held in the master's hand
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; to reveal what you was looking at.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; I love what Paul says in Ephesians 1
[1:01:54] and8 18, excuse me, that the eyes of
[1:01:57] your understanding being enlightened.
[1:02:00] And you you remember what brother said.
[1:02:02] He said, "Now you look with your eyes,
[1:02:04] but you understand with your heart." the
[1:02:07] eyes of your understanding being
[1:02:09] enlightened that you might know what is
[1:02:11] the hope of his calling and what the
[1:02:13] riches of the glory of the inheritance
[1:02:16] of the saints. But if you really want to
[1:02:18] capture the power of verse 18, you've
[1:02:21] got to go back to verse 17.
[1:02:27] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:02:29] the father of glory, may give unto you
[1:02:32] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:02:35] the knowledge of him. The reason why you
[1:02:38] can see is because there has been given
[1:02:41] a revelation not of William Brham but of
[1:02:45] almighty God.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Let me let me just paint the picture
[1:02:50] maybe just a little bit for our children
[1:02:52] just here. You can go out and you can
[1:02:55] look tonight if especially here in the
[1:02:57] Cidola Valley when we have our our clear
[1:03:00] nights. You can go out with your naked
[1:03:02] eye and you can go out and you can see
[1:03:04] little specks of light of stardust there
[1:03:07] and you can maybe pick out this this
[1:03:09] this zodiac and you can maybe pick out
[1:03:12] where Leo the lion is and different
[1:03:13] things and it would really take somebody
[1:03:16] that has a greater education than myself
[1:03:19] to really tell you what I'm looking at.
[1:03:21] But if you change that lens and you go
[1:03:25] down to something that can focus the
[1:03:27] attention down and start looking into
[1:03:30] the heavenlies and look through a
[1:03:31] telescope that in that telescope as you
[1:03:34] focus it, not only are you seeing little
[1:03:37] specks of light and not only are you
[1:03:39] seeing specks of dust, you begin to see
[1:03:42] complete formations. You begin to see
[1:03:44] the nebula, you begin to see galaxies
[1:03:46] and planets. Sometimes
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; what happened is that you changed your
[1:03:52] focus from your natural eye into
[1:03:55] something that was built to be able to
[1:03:58] see in that realm. Now, let me let me
[1:04:00] just paint the picture just a little bit
[1:04:03] clearer. The stars didn't change. Your
[1:04:06] focus changed. The stars was already
[1:04:09] there, but how you were looking at it
[1:04:12] changed. the message of the hour. Simply
[1:04:16] focus it down so that you realize that
[1:04:19] he's not the God of yesterday, but he's
[1:04:21] the God of today.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:04:29] Woo. I thank God for the seventh star.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. When William
[1:04:35] Brandham, you can hear him over and over
[1:04:36] again say, "I'm helpless and I'm
[1:04:38] hopeless without him." when he goes to
[1:04:40] the seals, he said, "If it had not been
[1:04:42] for the angel of the Lord coming in
[1:04:44] about the 12th hour of the day today,
[1:04:46] I'd have been completely wrong." What
[1:04:49] was it? The seventh star was pointing us
[1:04:52] back to the one that was holding the
[1:04:55] seventh star in his hand to make sure
[1:04:59] that we was not focusing on the star,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; but we was focusing our attention in the
[1:05:06] one that was holding
[1:05:11] Hallelujah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; I love what David or the Psalmist would
[1:05:16] say in Psalms 141
[1:05:19] verse 8. But mine eyes are unto thee,
[1:05:25] oh God, the Lord, in thee is my trust. I
[1:05:29] love what God sets before the children
[1:05:31] of Israel. You shall have no other God
[1:05:34] before me. It is the first commandment.
[1:05:39] But mine eyes,
[1:05:41] my direction, my gaze, my my emphasis,
[1:05:44] my glimpse of what I'm looking at are
[1:05:47] solely upon you.
[1:05:50] David was a man that was so intent on
[1:05:55] pleasing the father,
[1:05:57] even
[1:05:59] Hallelujah.
[1:06:00] Even when it got his own flesh in
[1:06:03] trouble,
[1:06:05] even when it got people mad around him,
[1:06:08] he was simply focused on pleasing the
[1:06:11] father.
[1:06:12] Now notice when a prophet comes and
[1:06:15] preaches in 1965, a man running from the
[1:06:18] presence of the Lord and you study that
[1:06:20] message out and it's very very powerful
[1:06:22] when brother Brandham begins to tie in
[1:06:24] Jonah's life and he he he said he begins
[1:06:27] to talk about him sherking his
[1:06:29] responsibilities. You look in there and
[1:06:31] you can see what brother Random is
[1:06:33] doing. He is showing the critical
[1:06:35] importance of our attention and paying
[1:06:38] attention and directing our
[1:06:40] understanding
[1:06:42] solely to the word of God. And brother
[1:06:45] Random would say in paragraph 68, he
[1:06:48] said that's the same thing the message
[1:06:49] is. He said you might say it's right or
[1:06:51] this that or the other. And I say and
[1:06:54] say I sympathize with it. I believe it's
[1:06:57] the truth, but you've got to accept it.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; You've got to accept it. It's got to
[1:07:03] become a part of you and you a part of
[1:07:07] it.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Too many times people focus, churches
[1:07:11] focus on building building numbers and
[1:07:16] building popularity and building this
[1:07:18] and building that. Brother Random said,
[1:07:21] "I'm afraid that too many times we've
[1:07:23] got the people to church, but what we
[1:07:25] need to do is get them to Christ."
[1:07:28] You see, when you you accept it, you
[1:07:31] become a part of it.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; That's why I have never thought of
[1:07:36] William Brandham as somebody way out
[1:07:38] there or that was above us.
[1:07:41] Brother Brandham's a part of this bride
[1:07:43] just like I'm a part of this bride.
[1:07:45] He's a part of this body like I'm a part
[1:07:47] of this body. There's a lot of people
[1:07:49] that elevate and I appreciate the man
[1:07:51] and I'm not taking away I'm not taking
[1:07:53] anything away from the prophetic realm.
[1:07:55] But I want you to realize this. If you
[1:07:58] could change your focus that what
[1:08:00] happened to William Brandham and his
[1:08:02] ministry is a part of you.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; What happened in that cave is a part of
[1:08:09] you. What happened up there in Sabina
[1:08:11] Cannon is a part of you. What happened
[1:08:14] when he preached the seals, that's a
[1:08:16] part of you. What happened in marriage
[1:08:18] divorce and who is this Melzdc? That's a
[1:08:20] part of you. in things that are to be
[1:08:23] and the rapture that's a part of you.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'mma have a fit today.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You notice when you notice when Paul I
[1:08:34] got to keep preaching. I got to get
[1:08:36] focused. When Paul when Paul was
[1:08:38] preaching, he was a theologians of the
[1:08:41] theologians.
[1:08:43] He knew the word like nobody else. But I
[1:08:46] love what brother said about Paul and
[1:08:48] God who is rich in mercy. He said about
[1:08:51] Paul, he said, "Now when the word saw
[1:08:53] the word, he became the word." When Paul
[1:08:56] was riding on his high horse and he
[1:08:59] looked out there and seen his Lord
[1:09:00] standing there, he realized that he saw
[1:09:03] the word and the word became flesh.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] Hallelu. I tell you what, it means
[1:09:14] something to you when you become a part
[1:09:15] of something.
[1:09:17] You can realize that you are born with a
[1:09:18] destiny over your life and there's
[1:09:20] nothing that can stop it. Your own human
[1:09:23] flesh can't stop it. Your own human
[1:09:25] ambitions cannot stop it.
[1:09:28] Let me say it like this. There's a lot
[1:09:30] of times that people walk over our young
[1:09:33] people and they don't realize the
[1:09:34] potential that is laying there. There's
[1:09:36] a lot of times that people neglect the
[1:09:39] older generation and they don't realize
[1:09:41] the potential that is laying there. A
[1:09:43] lot of people look out and they see the
[1:09:45] great oak tree and they they they get
[1:09:48] mesmerized by it. But at some point in
[1:09:50] its life, it was a little bitty old
[1:09:52] seedling. And you remember when you
[1:09:55] begin to ask God for a promise and all
[1:09:57] of a sudden God gives you a little
[1:09:59] acorn. What is it? He is giving you the
[1:10:02] potential of a miracle. But it's got to
[1:10:05] go through the watering. It's got to go
[1:10:08] through the flood. It's got to go
[1:10:09] through the process of being born again.
[1:10:16] Samson was a man
[1:10:19] that was born for a purpose.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; He was born to be a destroyer of the
[1:10:24] Philistines.
[1:10:26] Let me just say it like it was, but he
[1:10:29] got distracted.
[1:10:31] He lost focus. He got his eyes
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; like a lot of these young brothers do.
[1:10:37] Say, "My goodness, look at that sin.
[1:10:43] But he lost his focus and he started
[1:10:46] looking at the wrong things. But you
[1:10:48] see, all of his life, he was born to be
[1:10:53] a destroyer. He was born for greatness.
[1:10:57] But he kept losing his focus. But it
[1:11:00] took him where he'd lose his eyesight so
[1:11:03] God could focus him back down so that he
[1:11:06] would realize his purpose. You realize
[1:11:09] that God has to send you sometimes
[1:11:11] through the thick and through the thin
[1:11:13] just so that you realize what kind of
[1:11:16] greatness is on the inside of you.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that love to
[1:11:20] sign up to be a convention speaker like
[1:11:23] brother Ron, but they don't want to go
[1:11:24] through the things that Brother Ron's
[1:11:26] went through.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that are jealous
[1:11:29] over a convention speaker or they're
[1:11:32] intimidated by this brother. Let me say
[1:11:34] this. I got some fine brothers that are
[1:11:36] setting up here. I'm not intimidated and
[1:11:39] I'm not jealous of their gift. There's a
[1:11:42] lot of things that are in their ministry
[1:11:44] that I admire and I would love to have,
[1:11:48] but I'm not jealous of it and I'm not
[1:11:50] intimidated by it because I recognize
[1:11:53] that God made them that way for such and
[1:11:56] such a time as this.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:05] It's like every little kid, they want to
[1:12:09] they want to be the hero. They want Let
[1:12:12] me let me just paint the picture. It's
[1:12:13] been in the news of late, but every kid
[1:12:16] that's ever swung a baseball bat, they
[1:12:18] want to be the guy that wins a home run
[1:12:20] derby in the MLB. Let me just be honest.
[1:12:22] I had great aspirations of being the ML
[1:12:25] derby uh home run derby winner, but
[1:12:28] Coach Spots and Coach Hail, they did not
[1:12:30] see the greatness that was on the inside
[1:12:31] of me.
[1:12:33] They shut down my aspirations. Kind of
[1:12:35] like Adam shut down Jay and Nathan's
[1:12:36] aspirations to be the greatest at Fort
[1:12:38] Defiance basketball.
[1:12:41] But there's a lot of kids that
[1:12:43] Hallelujah.
[1:12:45] There's a lot of kids that dream about
[1:12:47] being the home run derby winner. But if
[1:12:50] you don't start out by going through the
[1:12:53] T-ball practices of learning how to
[1:12:55] swing and getting hit by a coach and
[1:12:57] getting being talked to by a coach that
[1:13:00] that tries to get on you, tries to coach
[1:13:02] you the right way. If you can't stand it
[1:13:04] at a T-ball level, you'll never stand it
[1:13:07] at a convention speaker problem.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; To be great, you've got to go through
[1:13:16] the trial.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:20] That's right.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; I could call I could call seven of these
[1:13:26] fine brothers up here.
[1:13:30] They fine.
[1:13:32] A lot of them single sisters.
[1:13:37] They ain't got no rings on their
[1:13:39] fingers.
[1:13:41] You can look at brother Noah, man of
[1:13:44] fine stature, built man. I'll tell you
[1:13:46] what, he's a man. You can look at
[1:13:48] brother Luke. A lot of things there.
[1:13:53] You can look at brother Jordan. You can
[1:13:54] look at all these brothers here. You can
[1:13:56] line up seven of them. They could be
[1:13:58] great in stature and have great
[1:14:00] intellectual minds and all those other
[1:14:03] things that would make them right,
[1:14:06] but yet there's something like it. And
[1:14:09] then you pull a little scrawny old Noah
[1:14:12] up here
[1:14:16] and God says, "That's exactly what I'm
[1:14:17] looking for."
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what Jesse thought. I I
[1:14:22] pick out my biggest and I'll pick out
[1:14:23] the best prosperous one and I I pick out
[1:14:25] the great ones. Because Jesse was
[1:14:27] focused on stature and the firstborn.
[1:14:31] But God was focused on something else.
[1:14:33] He was looking on something that man
[1:14:36] wasn't looking on. Why? Because God was
[1:14:39] looking at David's heart.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:45] And all of a sudden, David comes down
[1:14:47] and Samuel anoints him to be the prophet
[1:14:49] or anoints him to be the king. You see,
[1:14:52] what happened was David was a humble
[1:14:54] shepherd, 12 to 14 years of old,
[1:14:58] red-headed, ruddy,
[1:15:00] just a scrawny looking boy. But there
[1:15:03] was something special about David.
[1:15:06] Because David had practice
[1:15:09] in private,
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; but he was about to have public favor
[1:15:14] because of his focus and his attention
[1:15:18] to God's holy word.
[1:15:21] You see, a lot of people
[1:15:24] I'm going to get to the good stuff in a
[1:15:26] minute, but I got to I I got to drop
[1:15:27] this in because I feel very heavy right
[1:15:29] here. Feel I feel to say these things.
[1:15:31] There's a lot of people that want to be
[1:15:33] ruler over many things, but they have
[1:15:36] never been faithful over a few things.
[1:15:39] There's a lot of people that could say,
[1:15:41] "How sister Cassie ought to play the
[1:15:42] piano."
[1:15:47] No, you shouldn't do that. You're going
[1:15:49] to get in some There's a lot of people
[1:15:51] that would try to tell the preacher what
[1:15:54] he should say. There's a lot of people
[1:15:56] that that want to do the if I was a
[1:15:58] pastor, if if I was a mother, if I if I
[1:16:01] had if if they were my children, they
[1:16:03] ain't never had no children. If that was
[1:16:04] my piano, if that was my drum set, if
[1:16:07] that was my guitar, if that was my
[1:16:09] church,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; there's a lot of people that have the
[1:16:13] desires, but they never put the practice
[1:16:16] in. Like Sister Cassie put the practice
[1:16:19] in. There's a lot of people. Now, Sister
[1:16:22] Cassie played at some very well-known
[1:16:24] spots in Carnegie Hall and played before
[1:16:26] the greats and right there in
[1:16:27] Washington, DC. But to me, when she sits
[1:16:31] here before the angels of God,
[1:16:35] because she was faithful in a few
[1:16:37] things.
[1:16:41] Because you went to church when you
[1:16:43] didn't want to go to church and when
[1:16:45] your flesh didn't feel like going to
[1:16:47] church. Because you were faithful in a
[1:16:49] few things. He will make you ruler over
[1:16:53] many things. Sometimes you got to focus
[1:16:57] yourself.
[1:17:03] Now notice what the prophet said in
[1:17:04] victory day. He said, "Now that's a
[1:17:06] thing that broke the fellowship in
[1:17:08] Eden." It's because that Eve failed to
[1:17:12] keep focus of her looking on God's word
[1:17:14] and listening to reasoning of of the
[1:17:16] enemy. See, if she'd have just stayed
[1:17:19] right with God said so, that settles it.
[1:17:21] God said so. But she didn't want to do
[1:17:23] that. She changed the focus of her glass
[1:17:26] and began to see instead of being just
[1:17:29] one way, she began to see that there was
[1:17:32] two ways. And if we want a restored
[1:17:35] fellowship, then we've got to focus back
[1:17:38] that he is the way, the truth, and the
[1:17:41] life.
[1:17:44] When when David
[1:17:46] begins to move into public favor,
[1:17:50] I love this because David
[1:17:53] did not focus on how big his giant was.
[1:17:59] He did not focus on how big his line how
[1:18:02] his line tongue was.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; He did not focus on how big his spear
[1:18:07] was and how great his armor was.
[1:18:11] David simply focused himself on how big
[1:18:13] his God was.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; And I can say this that if you'll begin
[1:18:18] to focus on how big your God is, you'll
[1:18:21] begin to minimalize how big the devil
[1:18:24] is. And if you'll start saying bootle
[1:18:27] bootle
[1:18:29] and you'll start picking up f a i t h
[1:18:32] and j e s u s that little giant
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; will be bowing before you. And almighty
[1:18:41] God, I say every problem's got to bow.
[1:18:44] Every disease has got to bow.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:52] Now when Paul when Paul addresses the
[1:18:55] church and he begins to speak to them in
[1:18:59] Ephesians 6:10, he starts taking them
[1:19:02] through the whole armor of God. And he
[1:19:05] said, "Men and brethren," he said, "We
[1:19:07] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[1:19:09] against principalities and powers and
[1:19:10] wickedness of things." Notice
[1:19:15] Paul begins to point you to the
[1:19:17] spiritual. And I'd say church, let me
[1:19:20] say it. It It's so easy. It is so easy
[1:19:23] in this day and age to get consumed by
[1:19:26] everything that's going on. It's easy to
[1:19:28] get consumed with the powers of darkness
[1:19:31] and to get consumed with the schemes of
[1:19:33] the enemy and consumed against what is
[1:19:35] attacking you and what is attacking the
[1:19:37] bride. And it's it's easy to get
[1:19:40] consumed. But let me tell you what Paul
[1:19:42] did and what Paul did not do. Paul did
[1:19:46] not fix his eyes on the forces of hell.
[1:19:49] He simply pointed you and I to our
[1:19:52] victory and where our source was.
[1:19:55] He simply forced us and focused our
[1:19:58] attention to look on where the ability
[1:20:01] to come from to focus our attention on
[1:20:04] how to win the battle.
[1:20:07] Well, I'm I'm pretty strong, brother
[1:20:09] Andrew. I I've been in this I've been in
[1:20:10] this journey for quite some time and I
[1:20:12] know how to win and I know how to war.
[1:20:14] Let me tell you, the strength you walk
[1:20:15] in is not human strength.
[1:20:18] It is not our strength. It's God's
[1:20:20] strength. The power that you operate in,
[1:20:23] it is not it is not of the flesh. It
[1:20:25] didn't come from your mama. And it
[1:20:26] didn't come from the preacher. It come
[1:20:28] from God's power. The armor that you
[1:20:31] wear. Some man didn't issue that. Some
[1:20:34] soldier out of the army didn't issue
[1:20:36] this armor to you. But almighty God
[1:20:39] issued this army.
[1:20:42] The same God, the same God,
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; the same God who called you out of
[1:20:48] brokenness
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; and restored you.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; The same God that called you and rescued
[1:20:56] you when you was helpless and hopeless.
[1:20:58] The same God who saved you when you were
[1:21:00] dead in your sin. Is the same God that
[1:21:02] is arming you right now. Is the same God
[1:21:05] that is focusing your attention back to
[1:21:07] the message of the hour. You are not
[1:21:10] fighting alone. You are not in this
[1:21:12] battle alone. You are not standing in
[1:21:14] your own strength. But you are clothed
[1:21:16] in the divine baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:19] And your sword that you are wielding is
[1:21:22] forged in the fire of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; I say if you'll focus away from the
[1:21:28] demons in your life and focus on where
[1:21:32] you got your armor at,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; it's kind of like a It's kind of like a
[1:21:37] racehorse. He's built to run. He's built
[1:21:40] to give everything he's got. But you
[1:21:43] see, a good trainer knows that he's got
[1:21:46] to put the blinders on him. And that
[1:21:48] horse is built to run. And he's got
[1:21:50] those blinders on. So, he's focused on
[1:21:52] one thing. He's focused on the goal that
[1:21:55] is ahead of him. He ain't looking who's
[1:21:57] beside him. He ain't looking at the
[1:21:58] crowd back there, but he's focused on
[1:22:01] running this race. That's why Paul said,
[1:22:04] "I press towards the mark of the prize
[1:22:08] of the high calling in Christ Jesus."
[1:22:10] Paul recognized he could not look at the
[1:22:12] things that he was saying because the
[1:22:14] things that he was saying.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Joshua realized he can look
[1:22:20] at the things he was seeing. Hallelujah.
[1:22:25] Hallelujah.
[1:22:27] What did brother Ron do?
[1:22:33] He didn't focus his attention on that
[1:22:34] name cancer.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; He focused on the one that spoke to him,
[1:22:40] said, "If you'll trust me, I'll use you
[1:22:42] like never before."
[1:22:46] How many of you have received death
[1:22:47] reports from the doctor?
[1:22:51] Oh, okay. Nobody here. Nobody's been
[1:22:54] sick.
[1:22:57] I know I got one here. But the doctor
[1:23:00] said if this don't we got no cure for
[1:23:02] you.
[1:23:05] Another man said now if if a man he said
[1:23:08] a doctor told me this that if a man or a
[1:23:10] woman
[1:23:13] can take the right mental attitude
[1:23:15] towards it.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; He said it will literally paralyze
[1:23:20] that demon. Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; You realize what you're looking at
[1:23:25] matters.
[1:23:27] There's a lot of people that look at
[1:23:30] the side effects. You take this pill,
[1:23:34] you take this pill to get rid of your
[1:23:36] headache and all of a sudden you got a
[1:23:37] bowel problem and all of a sudden you
[1:23:38] got you've got things that are going on
[1:23:40] that you didn't know and you was simply
[1:23:41] just trying to get rid of a headache.
[1:23:44] Yeah,
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; we look at all the side effects of this
[1:23:47] and you ever you ever been around
[1:23:48] somebody that and I'm not going there.
[1:23:51] I'm not going there. Not going there.
[1:23:53] I'm moving on. Somebody say, "Praise
[1:23:55] God."
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; You notice when brother Brandham when
[1:23:58] brother random he he's standing there.
[1:24:01] This is what I really want to get to. It
[1:24:02] it'll prove the point before I what I
[1:24:04] was going to say. What I was going to
[1:24:04] say. Brother Brandon would talk about
[1:24:06] when that maniac at Portland, Oregon
[1:24:08] when it was running at him and he he
[1:24:10] coming right here. He said people ask
[1:24:11] him said, "Brother Brandon, was you ever
[1:24:12] scared of that?" He said, "Absolutely
[1:24:13] not. He said, "Because as long as I know
[1:24:15] that he's there," he said, "I got no
[1:24:17] reason to fear." Let me say this to you,
[1:24:19] you fine people, if you can just focus
[1:24:22] your attention. Brother Brandham
[1:24:24] realized he did not have the abilities
[1:24:26] to heal one of them patients. But he
[1:24:29] focused the patients attention to the
[1:24:32] one that was standing between him and
[1:24:35] them. And if you can focus your
[1:24:37] attention away from complaining and away
[1:24:40] from nagging and away from this and away
[1:24:43] from that and focus it back down.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; You see, there's there's so many people
[1:24:54] that forget today because they're
[1:24:56] focused on yesterday and they're focused
[1:24:58] on tomorrow. But that's what I love
[1:25:01] about the message of the hour is because
[1:25:03] the message makes the gospel present
[1:25:04] tense. It makes the unseen present
[1:25:07] tense. And that's what I I so love about
[1:25:09] the message is that it realize it puts
[1:25:12] the emphasis on he is the God of today
[1:25:16] that he is focused
[1:25:19] that the God that was yesterday is the
[1:25:21] God of right now. The God that gave
[1:25:24] Sarah her baby is the God that'll take
[1:25:27] care of you. The God that took care of
[1:25:29] Mary is the God that'll take care of
[1:25:31] you. It matters where you're focused on.
[1:25:36] You remember when you remember when
[1:25:38] brother Brandon would tell about the
[1:25:42] tell about that musician? He he'd give
[1:25:44] that great performance.
[1:25:47] He'd give it out and when he finished
[1:25:50] up, everybody was in the crowd. They
[1:25:52] were applauding him and screaming,
[1:25:54] throwing roses and everything out there.
[1:25:57] the but the musician wasn't focused on
[1:26:00] the crowd. He was focused in the
[1:26:03] banisters up there because up there in
[1:26:06] the banisters was the master.
[1:26:10] He didn't care
[1:26:12] if people neglected
[1:26:14] how he played or they appreciated how he
[1:26:16] played. He was simply focused on what
[1:26:20] the master thought.
[1:26:22] So many times we focus our attention
[1:26:25] about this one says this and that one
[1:26:27] says that. I only care what does the
[1:26:31] master think.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Martha Martha busied herself
[1:26:37] and she was so worried. She was so
[1:26:40] worried about about up about the house
[1:26:42] meant everything else. But when Lazarus
[1:26:44] died, she got her attention focused back
[1:26:48] on the master.
[1:26:50] There was a lot of people weeping. There
[1:26:52] was a lot of people crying. There was a
[1:26:54] lot of people that was that was saying,
[1:26:56] "If Jesus really cared." But she focused
[1:26:59] her attention and said, "Even now, Lord,
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; no matter what you're going through,
[1:27:05] even now,
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; I say he's more than able. Even right
[1:27:10] now, I say he's in this room. Even right
[1:27:12] now,
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we got any Marthas in here
[1:27:19] tonight that want to focus their
[1:27:21] attention that their brother's dead and
[1:27:23] he ain't coming.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; And they want to focus back that he's
[1:27:30] still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:27:32] forever.
[1:27:35] You know good and well that Leodysy has
[1:27:37] tried to rob you of all of your
[1:27:38] inheritance and all of your blessings
[1:27:40] and tried to make you live below all of
[1:27:42] your God-given privileges.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:53] We have a family that are sitting right
[1:27:55] here, Brother Jeremy and Sister April,
[1:27:58] and they have such a powerful testimony.
[1:28:02] I could point out all kinds, but this
[1:28:03] one just comes to my mind right now.
[1:28:06] They come here. They had one intention
[1:28:09] and that was to get this message out. It
[1:28:12] didn't matter how Brother Jeremy
[1:28:13] started. He just wanted to do something.
[1:28:15] He took the highlights of Brother Ron's
[1:28:17] ministry and he started typing them out
[1:28:19] and he started putting it on book form
[1:28:21] for everybody here that didn't take
[1:28:22] notes. He wanted everybody to make sure
[1:28:23] they had the highlights of it. Then he
[1:28:25] went from there and he started he
[1:28:27] started making sure we had a that that
[1:28:29] we had the right kind of audio tech
[1:28:30] because God had gifted him in that
[1:28:32] manner.
[1:28:34] He realized that he couldn't focus his
[1:28:35] attention on preaching the gospel
[1:28:37] because he wasn't called to be a
[1:28:39] preacher. But God had put something on
[1:28:41] the inside of him where he could focus
[1:28:43] himself. So God blessed him and God God
[1:28:46] used him. I'll be honest, if it wasn't
[1:28:48] for brother Jeremy, he probably would
[1:28:49] never be on the internet.
[1:28:52] If it wasn't been for brother Jeremy,
[1:28:55] you would have suffered during co. But
[1:28:58] that man, and I I'm sorry if you get
[1:29:00] mad, but I'm going to give him some
[1:29:01] flowers right now.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; That man was used of God.
[1:29:13] But it the story doesn't end there. They
[1:29:16] had something that they wanted. He
[1:29:18] wanted something that he could provide
[1:29:20] for his family. something that that he
[1:29:23] could have a kind of job that that he
[1:29:24] could take care of his family in such a
[1:29:26] way. And in a prayer line one day right
[1:29:29] here at this altar, God gave him a
[1:29:31] promise. And it looked like it wasn't
[1:29:33] coming, but he stayed focused. He stayed
[1:29:36] focused on the promise. And God gave him
[1:29:39] a job that blessed him and his wife in
[1:29:42] such a way. If you knew the story, you
[1:29:45] would understand why he's so focused.
[1:29:50] I could go all over this room.
[1:29:56] Hallelujah.
[1:29:58] I I better not. Somebody's going to get
[1:29:59] offended if I don't call their name.
[1:30:03] Let me say it like this. God does not
[1:30:04] call the people that are not willing to
[1:30:06] put their shoulder to the wheel.
[1:30:09] God is calling somebody that can use
[1:30:12] what was in their past and make it great
[1:30:14] in their future.
[1:30:16] somebody that is willing to focus their
[1:30:18] attention. You look at what brother
[1:30:20] Gabriel's doing with those devotions and
[1:30:22] those testimonies. That ain't my
[1:30:25] calling. But he focused his attention to
[1:30:28] it.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; You look at brother Jeffrey, you look at
[1:30:31] brother, that ain't my calling. Y'all
[1:30:34] thank God it ain't my calling. Cuz I'm
[1:30:36] going to tell you right now, if I had
[1:30:37] what Sister Cassie had, I'd be laying on
[1:30:40] that piano and I'd be playing it like
[1:30:42] Jerry Lee Lewis. I'd be the Jerry Lee
[1:30:45] Lewis of the message.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; I'm telling the truth. I don't care
[1:30:52] whether you think it's true or not. I'm
[1:30:54] telling the truth.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Let me Let me just Let me just Let me go
[1:31:00] ahead and preach. I'm I'm done loose
[1:31:02] now. It's bad now. I done got loose.
[1:31:04] Woo.
[1:31:08] Y'all can turn me off the internet if
[1:31:10] you want to or not. But I love what
[1:31:12] brother Nathan said last weekend about
[1:31:14] Simeon holding Jesus. He was cradling
[1:31:16] potential. It made me think about Moses
[1:31:19] and Pharaoh down there. Brother Brandham
[1:31:21] said that Pharaoh never had that
[1:31:23] potential in him. But he looked out the
[1:31:25] same window. Why? Because he couldn't
[1:31:27] focus it right. But all of a sudden,
[1:31:30] Moses was born in the same house, had
[1:31:32] the same attention span, had the same
[1:31:34] education, but there was something
[1:31:36] different. He be to focus. He was kind
[1:31:39] of like that duck that was headed for
[1:31:41] water. And the mama hen was trying to
[1:31:43] call him back. There was no way that
[1:31:46] Egypt was going to get Moses back
[1:31:49] because he done got a smell of a real
[1:31:52] living God. Let me say this duck was
[1:31:56] built to swim.
[1:32:02] Let me say something. The guy that was
[1:32:04] looking at the master had been
[1:32:06] practicing before he got before the
[1:32:09] audience.
[1:32:11] Let me say this. If you don't want to
[1:32:13] worship God here, you prepare to get ran
[1:32:16] over.
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:22] Because let me say this, this is just a
[1:32:25] rehearsal of what we're going to do up
[1:32:27] there.
[1:32:30] And if you can't act right here, you'll
[1:32:33] never act right there. If you can't amen
[1:32:35] here, you'll not amen there. If you
[1:32:38] can't shout here, you'll never shout
[1:32:40] there. If you can't dance here, you'll
[1:32:43] never dance there. Why? This duck is
[1:32:46] headed for water.
[1:32:51] It's too many people that's tried to pin
[1:32:53] the ducks up and say, "We can't have the
[1:32:56] Holy Ghost." But I hear a prophet say,
[1:32:59] "Let the waters rise. Let the waters
[1:33:02] rise and let the ducks get to their
[1:33:05] position.
[1:33:11] I got a smell of the supernatural and
[1:33:15] I'm headed for water.
[1:33:19] 38 years I've been laying here and I've
[1:33:22] been focusing on
[1:33:25] Hallelujah.
[1:33:26] Hallelujah. I've been laying here for 38
[1:33:29] years and I've been focusing on me.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; But I need somebody to change my focus.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. And then Jesus
[1:33:47] stepped in.
[1:33:49] I say there's a man that can walk on the
[1:33:51] water. I say there's a man that knows
[1:33:54] how to trouble the waters around you
[1:33:57] and change your focus. I ain't got
[1:34:00] nobody. Nobody cares for me. Nobody
[1:34:03] calls me. Nobody checks on me. If
[1:34:06] Brother Ron really loved me, if Full
[1:34:08] Gospel Lighthouse really cared for me,
[1:34:10] they had called on me and checked on me.
[1:34:12] I ain't been to church in too much and
[1:34:14] nobody's checked on me.
[1:34:17] Change your focus.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. We ain't a
[1:34:22] bunch of busy bodies here
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; and we ain't nosy. It's not that we
[1:34:27] don't care. We just don't know whether
[1:34:29] you're on a sabatical or not.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; But I heard a man,
[1:34:42] why don't you get up out of your bed and
[1:34:43] walk?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't got no man to put me in
[1:34:47] the water. What did it do? He changed
[1:34:52] his attention and he focused him that
[1:34:56] he was the one
[1:34:59] that could change everything.
[1:35:04] Brother Mar said that when God moves in
[1:35:05] the spirit, his spirit, his children
[1:35:08] move with the spirit. You see, if you
[1:35:11] ever want to be close to the
[1:35:13] supernatural, you've got to move with
[1:35:15] the ark of the covenant.
[1:35:18] Let me say this. When you start moving
[1:35:20] with the ark, then the supernatural is
[1:35:22] going to take place. What happened with
[1:35:24] Congressman Upshaw? What happened with
[1:35:25] Georgie Carter? What happened with that
[1:35:27] blind girl with the cataracts? What
[1:35:28] happened with that little baby down
[1:35:30] there in Mexico? What happened? They
[1:35:33] started moving with the ark and the ark
[1:35:36] produced the supernatural. What happened
[1:35:39] when they were down there in the Jordan
[1:35:41] River and the ark started moving? The
[1:35:43] Jordan opened up. What happened when the
[1:35:46] ark started going around going around
[1:35:49] and going around Jericho walls? The ark
[1:35:52] was moving and the supernatural produced
[1:35:54] Jericho walls falling down. What
[1:35:57] happened when the ark started to move?
[1:36:00] When the ark started to move and there
[1:36:02] was a men that didn't want to put the
[1:36:03] ark back in his right place, so they set
[1:36:05] it back on on some cows. Let me say if
[1:36:08] God can lead some cows and they set the
[1:36:10] ark of the covenant back on them cows
[1:36:12] and God supernaturally led the ark back
[1:36:15] to its rightful place surely he can take
[1:36:18] Hallelujah surely he can take
[1:36:20] insignificant people and he can move
[1:36:23] them right back in the supernatural. Let
[1:36:25] me say when the ark began to move, when
[1:36:27] the ark began to move, when it began to
[1:36:30] move, the supernatural took place. And
[1:36:32] when it got to such a place and it
[1:36:34] couldn't go no further and the ark sat
[1:36:36] down in OE Edom's house. Hallelujah. And
[1:36:39] the message of the hour stayed there for
[1:36:41] a certain season. What was it? Oed
[1:36:43] Edom's house became indefinitely blessed
[1:36:46] because the message, the ark was on
[1:36:49] their life. I say this, it's more than a
[1:36:52] picture on the wall and it's more than
[1:36:53] tapes. I say the ark of the covenant,
[1:36:57] the Holy Spirit has rested in your
[1:36:59] heart.
[1:37:01] I say when the ark begins to move, then
[1:37:03] the supernatural's got to manifest.
[1:37:06] Go to Numbers chapter 10 verse 33.
[1:37:11] Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] Hallelujah.
[1:37:15] Hallelujah.
[1:37:17] Hallelujah. And they departed from the
[1:37:20] mountain on the Lord of the Lord. Three
[1:37:22] days journey. And the ark of the
[1:37:24] covenant of the Lord went before them in
[1:37:26] three days journey to search out a
[1:37:29] resting place for them. Verse 34. And
[1:37:32] the cloud of the Lord was upon them by
[1:37:34] day. And when they went out of the camp,
[1:37:38] it came to pass that when the ark set
[1:37:40] forward that Moses said, "Rise up, Lord,
[1:37:44] and let thine enemies be scattered, and
[1:37:48] let them that hate thee flee before
[1:37:51] thee." When the ark moves, then every
[1:37:54] demon's got to bow. Every disease has
[1:37:57] got to bow. You let the ark move.
[1:38:01] I say it's time that you focus your
[1:38:03] attention. Like Moses said, "Rise up,
[1:38:06] Lord.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Rise up."
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; I'm like David said, "Let God arise and
[1:38:13] let his enemies be scattered."
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; I say the name of Jesus should be our
[1:38:28] focus.
[1:38:31] When you read in Acts chapter 19, and
[1:38:34] I'mma I'mma focus this on down
[1:38:38] and you begin to see Paul beginning to
[1:38:40] move in the supernatural and
[1:38:42] demonstration
[1:38:44] and they begin to be some pretenders of
[1:38:46] the message that got around and they
[1:38:48] started seeing the supernatural manifest
[1:38:51] and there were seven sons ofKeva that
[1:38:53] was there and they started operating by
[1:38:57] the name of Jesus. I believe it's Acts
[1:39:00] 19 and 13 and 15 that you'll begin to
[1:39:02] see that the sons ofKeva and it's they
[1:39:04] begin to go out there and they seen this
[1:39:06] demon-possessed man and they begin to
[1:39:08] say in the name of Jesus Christ who Paul
[1:39:10] preached come out of him and them demon
[1:39:13] spirits in that man said Paul I know and
[1:39:16] Jesus I know but who are you?
[1:39:21] Who are you? Let me say this. them
[1:39:23] demons that you come up against face to
[1:39:25] face every single day, they know who our
[1:39:28] Lord is. They know who our Lord is. You
[1:39:31] can go up there and say, you can say in
[1:39:34] the name of Jesus Christ who William
[1:39:36] Brandon preached, but if you don't know
[1:39:39] him, let me say the name of Jesus Christ
[1:39:41] is not a formality, but it is a
[1:39:44] relationship.
[1:39:46] And that demon spirit jumped on them and
[1:39:49] beat them.
[1:39:52] You go read the rest of the details. Let
[1:39:54] me say this. The name of Jesus Christ is
[1:39:58] powerful when it's focused to a new
[1:40:00] birth. And out of a new birth, all of a
[1:40:03] sudden, Congressman Upshaw begins to get
[1:40:05] healed. And Georgie Carter begins to get
[1:40:08] healed. And blind eyes begin to be open
[1:40:12] because the name of Jesus Christ was in
[1:40:14] a relationship
[1:40:17] with somebody that was focused.
[1:40:23] It's easy.
[1:40:25] It's easy to lose fake focus.
[1:40:29] It's easy to get our mind on
[1:40:31] disappointments and distractions.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; It's easy.
[1:40:37] I'll be honest. It's easy to get your
[1:40:39] eyes on emotions.
[1:40:42] Well, let me say this.
[1:40:44] The void or the the wind didn't move a
[1:40:47] lot.
[1:40:49] The wind didn't move Elijah. The fire
[1:40:52] didn't move Elijah. The earthquake
[1:40:54] didn't move Elijah. But the voice behind
[1:40:57] the voice moved Elijah.
[1:41:03] I I think it's Jeremiah 12:15. Let Let
[1:41:07] me just put it up there. I I'll tell you
[1:41:08] if I'm right or wrong, and you'll know
[1:41:10] if I'm right or wrong immediately.
[1:41:13] Nope. That's not it.
[1:41:17] Sorry. You think I'd be prepared?
[1:41:28] I got it up here in my brain. But
[1:41:34] you nervous, brother Andrew? Oh, no.
[1:41:38] Not nervous at all because I know what's
[1:41:40] in here.
[1:41:42] There it is. Ha. Verse five. Mental
[1:41:45] mental laps right there.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Y'all love me. Praise God.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; If thou has run with the footmen,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; and they have wearied thee,
[1:42:08] then how canst thou contend with the
[1:42:11] horses? Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you get tired of
[1:42:15] running with
[1:42:18] natural human beings, let me let me just
[1:42:21] paint it down just a little bit clear.
[1:42:23] Let me If if brother Dylan, he could
[1:42:27] come to a spot and he got wearied with
[1:42:29] running with men and they couldn't take
[1:42:31] him no further,
[1:42:33] then how was he ever going to run with
[1:42:35] the horses? Come on.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; How in the world in your natural human
[1:42:39] abilities are you going to be able if
[1:42:41] you get tired of running or running in
[1:42:43] your home? You ain't never going to be
[1:42:45] able to keep up.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're doing it on on your
[1:42:49] own. And there's been a lot Let me say
[1:42:51] this. Let me because I I I could point
[1:42:53] this out to a lot of people and it's
[1:42:55] definitely me. I tried to live this
[1:42:57] message on my own for a long time. I
[1:43:00] tried to run with the footman and I got
[1:43:03] weary. Then how am I going to keep up
[1:43:06] with the horses? How am I going to get
[1:43:07] in a horse race
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; if I can't keep up with the footmen?
[1:43:12] But let me say there's some supernatural
[1:43:14] power here.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; I say there's some supernatural power
[1:43:17] here because Elijah was weary of running
[1:43:20] with the footmen. But all of a sudden he
[1:43:24] saw a cloud like the size of a hand of a
[1:43:28] man and he outran the horses of Ahab's
[1:43:31] chariots. It was showing that there is a
[1:43:35] supernatural element when you focus your
[1:43:38] attention.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; You might get weary of me down here, but
[1:43:44] let me say the supernatural is here to
[1:43:47] make you run.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; I say, "Let us run."
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do, brother
[1:43:57] Andrew? I'm going to run till every one
[1:43:59] of these prodals get back in this
[1:44:01] church.
[1:44:04] I'm going to run
[1:44:07] until I get wearied. I'm going to run
[1:44:10] till I feel like quitting. And then the
[1:44:12] supernatural is going to take over.
[1:44:15] I'm going to run. I'm going to run. I'm
[1:44:19] going run. I'm going to run. I'm going
[1:44:22] to run. I'm going to run.
[1:44:29] I'm going to run. I'm going to run. I'm
[1:44:33] going to run. I'm going to run. I'm
[1:44:36] going to run. I'm going to run.
[1:44:41] Don't you be weary in welloing for in
[1:44:45] the time of season. Our God. I say run
[1:44:50] with this message.
[1:45:03] Lord, let the musicians come.
[1:45:12] Hallelujah.
[1:45:20] Hallelujah.
[1:45:36] I look for this quote all day today
[1:45:44] showing that there is some supernatural
[1:45:46] elements to the human abilities.
[1:45:52] Brandon talks about
[1:45:54] about a man. He said, "I watched it on a
[1:45:56] on a telecast the other night of a man
[1:45:59] that was that burned some people up." He
[1:46:03] said, "Of a man that had set and had a
[1:46:06] psychic mental power and he set a glass
[1:46:09] of water out there and he had
[1:46:12] concentrated on it so much
[1:46:15] until he made it burst with his own
[1:46:18] human abilities."
[1:46:21] Brother Brandham said that. He said, 'If
[1:46:22] that man could have ever got a hold of
[1:46:25] the right thing, what he could have done
[1:46:29] for the kingdom of God.
[1:46:32] And then brother Brandham turns it in
[1:46:35] Messiah and he starts focusing the
[1:46:38] attention down. He said, "What is in
[1:46:41] man? It's to thirst after God." But he
[1:46:45] begins to satisfy it and put substitutes
[1:46:47] in there before it. You see, that was in
[1:46:50] man.
[1:46:51] that was in man to be able to do those
[1:46:54] things. But he was doing that from
[1:46:57] psychic powers. You remember when
[1:46:59] brother Brandham is standing there and I
[1:47:01] you remember he's standing with that
[1:47:03] little girl and she's she's in that bed
[1:47:05] and she's sick and he tells her said,
[1:47:09] "Won't you move that little chain right
[1:47:11] there?
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Won't you move that little chain right
[1:47:13] there?" She said, "I can't do that. I
[1:47:14] can't even touch it." He said, "Well, I
[1:47:17] can and not touch it." And brother
[1:47:20] Brandham starts looking on it and he
[1:47:23] starts moving in a circle and she said
[1:47:25] said that's that that's that's of the
[1:47:27] devil. He said oh no because Jesus said
[1:47:31] that if you had faith as much as a grain
[1:47:33] of mustard seed you could speak to it.
[1:47:36] And brother Brandon said he started
[1:47:38] turning around the other way.
[1:47:41] What was it? A man had focused so much
[1:47:44] in the natural that he could break
[1:47:47] glass. But here's a man that was focused
[1:47:51] by the new birth and had the abilities
[1:47:54] of Mark 11 and 22 and 23 and 24 that he
[1:47:58] could operate. What is it? One man that
[1:48:02] is in contact with a world of blow and
[1:48:06] one man that is in contact with the
[1:48:08] supernatural
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; of Almighty God.
[1:48:11] You watch in that witch in that witch
[1:48:13] camp when brother Brandham is standing
[1:48:15] there and there's those there's those
[1:48:17] spiritualists down there in that camp
[1:48:19] and they've got that table and the
[1:48:20] guitar and those clothes floating in the
[1:48:22] air and brother Brandon walks in there
[1:48:25] that table's floating and men had tried
[1:48:28] to grab a hold of it and bring it down
[1:48:29] and break it and all different things
[1:48:31] and they couldn't move it
[1:48:33] and they said we hear that you're a
[1:48:35] preacher and you've got power. He said I
[1:48:37] don't have no power. He said but I
[1:48:38] represent a power. You remember what
[1:48:40] brother Brandon does? He said, "In the
[1:48:42] name of the holy church, come down." And
[1:48:43] it didn't move. In the name of the
[1:48:45] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, come down.
[1:48:47] And it didn't move. In the name of
[1:48:48] William Brandham, come down. What was
[1:48:51] Brother Brandham doing? He was showing
[1:48:53] us that we cannot focus our attention on
[1:48:55] titles. We cannot focus our attention on
[1:48:58] the name of a man. We cannot focus our
[1:49:01] attention on our human abilities. But
[1:49:03] we've got to focus our attention to the
[1:49:05] power where the name of Jesus Christ is.
[1:49:08] And he said in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:49:11] come down. And he said at that time he
[1:49:13] said it completely come down. What was
[1:49:15] it showing that a man that is in contact
[1:49:18] and in fellowship with his maker can do
[1:49:21] the impossible?
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; What would happen in your life if you
[1:49:27] focused your attention
[1:49:30] to this word and to it only and got your
[1:49:34] eyes singled? Brother Ron shared this
[1:49:36] with me today. Here in Stanton in 1880,
[1:49:40] there was a little bitty woman that
[1:49:42] weighed 100 pounds and she went around
[1:49:45] all of all around the states and she was
[1:49:48] doing a phenomenal thing and she she'd
[1:49:50] gather people in the arenas and
[1:49:52] different things. She's just 100 pound
[1:49:55] and she would challenge four of the
[1:49:57] strongest men of that of that crowd to
[1:49:59] come and try to move her off of the
[1:50:02] ground.
[1:50:03] And the newspaper article said that they
[1:50:06] four men tried budging her and they
[1:50:08] couldn't move her. They tried this way
[1:50:10] and that way and they couldn't move her.
[1:50:13] Then she began to tilt on one leg and
[1:50:16] they couldn't move her back or forth.
[1:50:18] What was it? She was in tune with a
[1:50:22] wicked spirit that could have had the
[1:50:24] ability to give her supernatural
[1:50:26] strength. If you've ever been around a
[1:50:28] demonic person, they have a very
[1:50:31] supernatural power. Brother Brandon
[1:50:33] would say that that that legion it give
[1:50:35] him seven times more power.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "But a man with the Holy
[1:50:40] Ghost."
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; How much power does he have?
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I don't need to move a 100 pound woman
[1:50:48] and show that I'm anything.
[1:50:51] But I do need to pray
[1:50:55] that my people be let go of
[1:50:59] circumstances.
[1:51:00] I do need to pray for our children they
[1:51:03] get the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:08] This gospel is not for show, but it is
[1:51:11] for reality.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; I say young people, he's here to make
[1:51:16] himself known to you.
[1:51:19] I I I'll be honest. I want to be real
[1:51:21] real with you.
[1:51:24] I would never take time advantage of
[1:51:26] your time.
[1:51:28] If this message wasn't right, I wouldn't
[1:51:30] preach it.
[1:51:33] If it didn't have the same power that
[1:51:34] William Brandham had, then I wouldn't
[1:51:36] preach it. Cuz we'd be preaching
[1:51:38] anything else that everything everybody
[1:51:39] else is. And there's good people out
[1:51:41] there in them denomination. That's not
[1:51:43] that's not that has nothing to do with
[1:51:44] that.
[1:51:46] But if what you have does not make you
[1:51:49] live this gospel,
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; then you need to change your focus.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this,
[1:51:57] this message lives.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; I want to say it lives in our young
[1:52:02] people.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; I I I I
[1:52:06] told this story when I was in
[1:52:07] California.
[1:52:10] It was so just hit me and God used it in
[1:52:14] a way, but
[1:52:16] you know, Satan always wared with my dad
[1:52:18] and said, "Well,
[1:52:22] Angel will never get it." And then when
[1:52:25] I got it,
[1:52:28] Satan began to war with me and my
[1:52:30] children won't get it. And I I remember
[1:52:33] I remember when I was I had just had a
[1:52:36] little humble study out there and a
[1:52:37] little storage building. Had a little
[1:52:40] had a little desk there I'd made up and
[1:52:41] I was is a kingdom for me, man. I had
[1:52:45] all my study Bibles and all those
[1:52:47] different things laid out there and
[1:52:48] didn't have a clue what I was doing, but
[1:52:50] I was studying it anyway. And uh I just
[1:52:53] sitting there and all of a sudden the
[1:52:54] enemy began to speak to me and said,
[1:52:56] "You might live this, but your children
[1:52:57] never will."
[1:52:59] And I began to pray, God, if this
[1:53:02] message is real. I pray you do something
[1:53:05] for my children. I pray you do something
[1:53:06] for for my daughters. I pray you do
[1:53:08] something just something supernatural
[1:53:10] that I know I know that it works. Little
[1:53:14] Reagan, she wasn't but four or five
[1:53:16] years old that time. She she come
[1:53:18] running in that little office said,
[1:53:19] "Daddy, won't you talk to me about the
[1:53:21] message?"
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; It may not have meant anything to
[1:53:24] anybody else, but I know what I just
[1:53:26] prayed.
[1:53:31] I'm here to prove that the devil's a
