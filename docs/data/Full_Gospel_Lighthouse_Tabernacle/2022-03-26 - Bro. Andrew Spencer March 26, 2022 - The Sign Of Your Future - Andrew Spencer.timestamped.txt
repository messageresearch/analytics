[51:33] amen
[51:34] amen if you ever bibles this this
[51:36] evening we'd like to look over in the
[51:38] book of exodus chapter four and then to
[51:40] hebrews chapter one
[51:58] exodus chapter 4.
[52:07] say amen when you have it this evening
[52:10] amen
[52:12] and moses answered and said
[52:14] but behold they will not believe me nor
[52:17] hearken unto my voice
[52:19] for they will say the lord hath not
[52:21] appeared unto thee
[52:22] and the lord said unto him what is that
[52:24] in thine hand
[52:26] and he said a rod
[52:28] and he said cast it onto the ground and
[52:30] he cast it on the ground and it became a
[52:32] serpent and moses fled
[52:34] from before it and the lord said unto
[52:36] moses put forth on hand and take it by
[52:39] the tail
[52:40] and he put forth his hand and caught it
[52:42] and it became a rod in his
[52:44] hand that they might believe that the
[52:47] lord god of their fathers the god of
[52:49] abraham the god of isaac and the god of
[52:52] jacob hath appeared unto thee
[52:54] and the lord said furthermore unto him
[52:57] put now thine hand into thy bosom and he
[53:00] put his hand into his bosom and when he
[53:03] took it out behold his hand was a
[53:06] leprous as snow
[53:07] and he said put thine hand in thy bosom
[53:10] again and he put his hand into his bosom
[53:12] again and plucked it out of his bosom
[53:14] and behold it was turned again
[53:17] as his other flesh
[53:19] brother branham would draw our attention
[53:20] right here and say look it's divine
[53:23] healing
[53:24] and it shall come to pass that if they
[53:27] will not believe thee neither hearken to
[53:29] the voice of the first sign that they
[53:31] will believe the voice of the latter
[53:33] sign
[53:34] and it shall come to pass that if they
[53:36] will not believe also these two signs
[53:39] neither hearken unto thy voice that thou
[53:41] shalt take out of the water of the river
[53:44] and pour it upon the dry land
[53:46] and the water which thou takest out of
[53:48] the river shall become blood
[53:50] upon the dry land
[53:52] hebrews chapter 1
[53:54] and verse 1
[53:57] we're also thankful to have brother
[53:59] thomas frazier back in the house of the
[54:01] lord this this evening after his surgery
[54:04] there he's he's there in the back so
[54:06] we're just we're mindful that he's here
[54:08] and we're certainly thankful that the
[54:09] lord has brought him through and
[54:12] amen
[54:14] hebrews chapter 1
[54:16] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[54:19] manners spake in times past unto the pro
[54:21] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[54:24] last days spoken unto us by his son
[54:28] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[54:30] things
[54:31] by whom also he made the worlds
[54:34] who being the brightness of his glory
[54:36] and the express image of his person and
[54:38] upholding all things by the word of his
[54:42] power
[54:43] when he had by himself purged our sins
[54:45] set down on the right hand of the
[54:48] majesty
[54:49] on high may god bless his word he may be
[54:51] seated in the presence of the lord i'd
[54:54] like to take a thought this evening on
[54:56] on this on this subject from these from
[54:59] these texts here i'd like to take a
[55:01] subject this evening on the sign
[55:03] the sign of your future the sign of your
[55:07] future and brother branham would say
[55:08] that that we find out he said the
[55:10] burning bush was a sign it was it was
[55:12] given to attract the attention of moses
[55:15] and he said that's what god gives a sign
[55:17] for is to attract the attention of the
[55:21] people again he would say the burning
[55:23] bush was given to moses to attract the
[55:25] runaway prophet's attention and he
[55:27] turned aside to see what it was then the
[55:31] sign gave a voice the sign itself gave a
[55:33] voice now now these voices and signs are
[55:36] to alert to the people
[55:38] of god's word it's just about ready to
[55:40] be vindicated always a sign is to
[55:42] attract the attention
[55:44] the attentions of the people now many of
[55:46] you bible readers here and are thinking
[55:48] now are different passages in the bible
[55:50] and we're going to come to some of them
[55:52] he said but when a sign is given it
[55:54] attracts the attention of the people
[55:56] because god is getting ready to speak
[55:59] notice what he says he said he wants an
[56:01] audience
[56:03] he wants an audience he wants somebody
[56:06] that's going to listen to what he's
[56:07] going to say now he always does that his
[56:10] word alerts them the sign is an alert to
[56:13] attract the people
[56:15] to to to attract the attention of the
[56:17] people that the word is getting ready to
[56:20] speak and every time that you begin to
[56:22] see god move he doesn't move without a
[56:24] purpose whenever god moves he is doing
[56:27] it to bring about and vindicate his
[56:29] purpose and bring about and vindicate
[56:31] his word and we realize that that here
[56:33] was the pillar of fire that moses moses
[56:36] that was a shepherd out there on those
[56:38] mountain hills he'd been out there for
[56:39] 40 years and run away run away from the
[56:42] things that he knew he grew up in the
[56:44] laboratories of science of down in egypt
[56:46] he knew all of those things and had
[56:48] great had a great time down in in egypt
[56:50] but yet something was pulling him out
[56:53] into out into another world on the
[56:55] backside of a desert and there his
[56:58] attention was attracted to a bush that
[57:01] was on fire but notice it was not that
[57:03] the bush was on fire maybe he'd seen a
[57:05] bush on fire before but this bush was
[57:08] not consumed and there was something
[57:10] that was drawing him the attention of
[57:12] the prophet notice attention of the
[57:14] prophet to go up there on that mountain
[57:17] and see what this was about and when he
[57:20] turned aside to see
[57:22] then god began to speak unto him and
[57:24] notice it's whenever people begin to
[57:26] turn their attention away from the world
[57:29] and turn their attention onto god that
[57:31] god begins to speak to them but when you
[57:34] keep your mind on the things of the
[57:35] world god will not necessarily come down
[57:38] to you yet he's obligated to speak to
[57:40] you and he's obligated to move by your
[57:42] way but if your mind and your attention
[57:44] is on laodicea you'll miss what he's
[57:46] doing right here in the midst in the
[57:48] midst of the congregation but moses was
[57:51] attracted to a sign that was taking
[57:53] place up there brother branham said that
[57:55] that pillar of fire was assigned to the
[57:58] prophet he said and notice a sign has
[58:00] got a scriptural voice behind it but he
[58:02] would also say that a prophet is a sign
[58:06] is it right a prophet is a sign and we
[58:09] believe that we are living in an hour
[58:11] that we have received a sign to this
[58:13] generation but notice this sign that was
[58:16] coming that was there before moses moses
[58:19] said he'd recognize who he was he
[58:21] recognized that he was run away he'd
[58:23] recognize the certain things in his life
[58:25] that were leading him out of egypt
[58:27] things that were that they were not
[58:29] laying there that he couldn't get out of
[58:31] himself but there was something that god
[58:33] had put there before the foundation of
[58:35] the world it was a word that was
[58:37] attracted to the word and when you begin
[58:40] to see the word in this hour it began to
[58:42] attract you to the word and they didn't
[58:45] attract you to luther's message this
[58:47] word of this hour didn't attract you to
[58:49] wesley's message but the word of this
[58:51] hour attracted you to the last day
[58:54] message and notice what has attracted
[58:56] you has the ability to get you out of
[58:58] every chaos of laodicea and notice what
[59:01] was attracting moses his attention up
[59:04] there it had the ability to be able to
[59:06] get him out of the trouble and get all
[59:08] of israel out of the trouble that they
[59:10] were in notice what that voice said he
[59:13] said i am coming down to deliver notice
[59:15] that pillar of fire he was bred the
[59:18] pillar of fire was reminding moses
[59:20] notice what the voice was saying he was
[59:22] reminding moses about the promise to
[59:25] abraham he was reminding him that he was
[59:28] that he was a part of abraham's seed he
[59:31] began to tell him i remember what i told
[59:34] abraham i remember when i told him that
[59:36] his seed would sojourn in a strange land
[59:38] notice what the pillar fire was doing it
[59:41] was reminding him of the promise and the
[59:44] pillar of fire was saying that i'm here
[59:46] because of the promise i want to say
[59:48] this and declare it unto you that the
[59:50] reason that the pillar of fire is still
[59:52] in the midst and still in the
[59:53] congregation of the church of the living
[59:55] god is because there's a promise here
[59:58] and notice god is always obligated to
[1:00:00] stick to his promise and i want you to
[1:00:02] know i found a quote the other day that
[1:00:04] brother branham said that god is guilty
[1:00:06] unless he brings his word to pass god is
[1:00:09] not going to let his word fall on the
[1:00:11] ground god will not be guilty of not
[1:00:14] neglecting one promise god will be
[1:00:16] guilty of bringing it to pass the reason
[1:00:19] why the son of man is in the midst of
[1:00:21] the church of the living god is because
[1:00:23] there's a promise people there's a
[1:00:25] chosen people there's an elected people
[1:00:27] that have decided they are not taking
[1:00:30] the way with the day we're with the way
[1:00:31] of the world but they have chosen to
[1:00:33] follow the way under the lord's despised
[1:00:35] few they're not worried about what
[1:00:37] laodicea is doing they're not worried
[1:00:39] about what russia is doing they're not
[1:00:41] worried about what's going over in the
[1:00:43] world in the middle east but they are
[1:00:44] concerned with a promise
[1:00:47] they are concerned about what's going to
[1:00:49] take place because it has attracted
[1:00:51] their attention this promise has moved
[1:00:54] them into a realm that only a prophetic
[1:00:57] eye would be able to take him into
[1:01:07] notice he said i am coming down
[1:01:09] to deliver he didn't say how he was
[1:01:10] going to do it
[1:01:12] but he was going to bring them out of
[1:01:13] egypt and he had heard their cries he'd
[1:01:16] heard their groans he heard their
[1:01:17] prayers notice he said brother brandon
[1:01:19] said they were only waiting on god and
[1:01:22] god was only waiting on them
[1:01:26] he had his prophet out there in the
[1:01:28] wilderness but he was only waiting for
[1:01:30] the people to call him into action
[1:01:35] notice they were waiting on god but god
[1:01:38] was waiting on them i would to god that
[1:01:40] there be somebody that would rise up in
[1:01:42] the middle of laodicea that said let god
[1:01:45] be god and let his word be the truth let
[1:01:47] every man be a liar
[1:01:50] god is going to have somebody that's
[1:01:52] willing to raise him into action to call
[1:01:55] him on the scene say god i still believe
[1:01:58] that you're still in the wonder working
[1:02:00] power business i still believe that
[1:02:02] you're able to heal
[1:02:03] i still believe that you're able to
[1:02:05] drive out cancer i still believe in the
[1:02:07] promises
[1:02:09] god's got somebody that's willing to
[1:02:11] move past their own self
[1:02:13] [Applause]
[1:02:15] moses had to get past his own self
[1:02:18] to me to me one of the greatest miracles
[1:02:20] we see that there was a sign there was
[1:02:22] one sign there was two signs there was
[1:02:24] three signs but the miracle that i see
[1:02:26] up there on that mountain was moses
[1:02:28] getting past his own reluctance
[1:02:32] and many times as you getting past your
[1:02:34] own flesh god don't want your flesh
[1:02:38] god don't want your flesh he's wanting
[1:02:40] your soul so that he can operate your
[1:02:42] flesh he's not worried about how big you
[1:02:45] are he's not worried about how little
[1:02:47] you are he's not worried about how smart
[1:02:49] you are
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:51] what did he take out there he took a
[1:02:53] bunch of illiterate disciples and he
[1:02:56] made a church of the living god out of
[1:02:57] them and he shut down the very gates of
[1:03:00] hell in front of the sanhedrin what is
[1:03:02] it
[1:03:03] god was not willing that their past
[1:03:06] would stand in their future
[1:03:09] he was not willing that they would go
[1:03:11] down as much just a bunch of fishermen
[1:03:13] he was not willing that they would go
[1:03:14] down it's just the people that walk with
[1:03:16] jesus he was wanting them to be known as
[1:03:19] a people that was walking and being in
[1:03:22] jesus
[1:03:25] hallelujah
[1:03:29] he's the same right now
[1:03:31] now notice
[1:03:33] notice when god shows
[1:03:35] he shows the phenomena
[1:03:38] and he attracts the attention of his
[1:03:39] prophet when the prophet got down there
[1:03:41] he showed the phenomenon
[1:03:44] notice it took in a phenomenal prayer to
[1:03:47] attract the attention of the prophet but
[1:03:48] when the prophet got down their egypt he
[1:03:51] showed them phenomena
[1:03:53] because he was god's voice how could a
[1:03:56] man pick up dust and throw and say thus
[1:03:58] saith lord and not even a not a flee in
[1:04:00] the country in a couple hours from then
[1:04:02] it's crowded full of fleas not a fly
[1:04:04] nowhere at all at all he'd say let there
[1:04:07] be flies and the first thing you know
[1:04:08] that big old blowfly began to fly around
[1:04:11] and they were bloating the people
[1:04:12] everywhere
[1:04:13] who
[1:04:14] what man could do that
[1:04:16] it was god using that prophet making his
[1:04:19] word a sign to give a call that we're
[1:04:22] going out of each
[1:04:23] now what what good sense would it make
[1:04:26] if god would just simply send them a
[1:04:28] prophet send them a sign if he didn't
[1:04:31] have an ability to get them out of their
[1:04:33] trouble
[1:04:34] what good would it have done for god to
[1:04:36] send william branham if he didn't have
[1:04:38] the ability to get us out of creeds to
[1:04:40] get us out of dogmas to get us out of
[1:04:42] stipulations of the world but he has an
[1:04:44] ability
[1:04:46] i say in the son of man there is an
[1:04:48] ability not just to get you out of each
[1:04:51] other but it gets you into the promised
[1:04:52] land
[1:04:53] [Applause]
[1:04:57] oh hallelujah
[1:04:59] hallelujah it wasn't it was a man it was
[1:05:01] god using that prophet making his word a
[1:05:03] sign to give a call that we're going out
[1:05:04] of egypt he said now you're going to be
[1:05:07] my mouthpiece you go on down there and
[1:05:09] i'll be with you
[1:05:11] and when he got down there the promised
[1:05:13] word that he had promised was vindicated
[1:05:15] that was
[1:05:17] the voice
[1:05:18] of the son you remember when brother
[1:05:20] branham was up there in that cave and he
[1:05:22] meets that angel up there
[1:05:24] you remember
[1:05:25] i'm talking to message people ain't i
[1:05:27] i'm talking to a message church i didn't
[1:05:29] leave you all i didn't leave y'all y'all
[1:05:30] didn't turn into something else while i
[1:05:32] left did you i'm talking to a message
[1:05:33] church is that
[1:05:34] right you remember what that angel he
[1:05:37] told him he said just like the prophet
[1:05:38] moses was given two signs so shall you
[1:05:42] be received and you shall have two signs
[1:05:44] one will be a gifted a sign of the hand
[1:05:46] and the other will be able to discern
[1:05:48] the very secrets of the heart
[1:05:50] and you notice what was doing that it
[1:05:53] was not the man william branham
[1:05:56] it was something supernatural this was
[1:05:58] not some some seventh grade kentucky
[1:06:01] hillbilly a player that was dividing
[1:06:03] dividing perfectly dividing the word it
[1:06:06] was some intelligence up there it was an
[1:06:08] intelligence that was taking him through
[1:06:11] the scriptures it was an intelligence
[1:06:13] that was taking him through the promises
[1:06:16] aren't you thankful that that
[1:06:17] intelligence didn't leave us where we
[1:06:19] were but he's taking us to where we're
[1:06:21] going
[1:06:22] [Applause]
[1:06:23] this was not the intelligence of some
[1:06:25] man this was the intelligence of
[1:06:28] almighty god
[1:06:29] i happen to believe that he met that
[1:06:31] angel a prayer i happen to believe that
[1:06:33] those signs that were produced are the
[1:06:35] same things it's a voice behind those
[1:06:38] signs that's still in the church of the
[1:06:40] living god
[1:06:41] [Applause]
[1:06:43] notice when brother branham comes into
[1:06:45] the seventh seal he said now he said he
[1:06:47] said now he said you could he said you
[1:06:49] could up here on this platform he said
[1:06:50] there could be he said there could be
[1:06:52] trumpets laying over here he said a
[1:06:53] whole bunch of trumpets laying over here
[1:06:55] he said but he said he said it's not the
[1:06:58] man that's doing the work he's talking
[1:07:00] about the ministry he's not it's not the
[1:07:01] man that's doing the work he said but
[1:07:04] it's something on the inside of him
[1:07:06] that's making it come out of him he said
[1:07:08] you could take these trumpets he said
[1:07:10] all of them look the same all of them
[1:07:11] have the abilities he said but it takes
[1:07:14] an intelligence to be able to sound out
[1:07:17] to sound out the music of it it's not
[1:07:19] the man william brown it's not ron
[1:07:22] spencer it's not tim pruitt it's not
[1:07:25] donny reagan it's an intelligence behind
[1:07:27] it it's not myself
[1:07:30] he said it wasn't me he said i was just
[1:07:33] the body that it was you said i was
[1:07:36] standing close
[1:07:37] [Applause]
[1:07:39] he said it's what i surrendered myself
[1:07:41] to
[1:07:42] and you are now feeding on the unfailing
[1:07:45] body word of the son of man
[1:07:48] what the church world is looking for is
[1:07:50] setting right in the heart of the church
[1:07:52] of the living god
[1:07:58] it's a sign
[1:07:59] it's a sign of your future
[1:08:02] a prophet's a sign
[1:08:04] we have the gentiles have received their
[1:08:06] last sign
[1:08:07] but you notice that something that is
[1:08:09] always on the question
[1:08:11] of people what about their future
[1:08:14] what what will come of them what what
[1:08:16] will their future be how how old will
[1:08:18] they be when they get married how

[1:10:03] invincible army it doesn't say that i'll
[1:10:06] be run over by the devil but it does say
[1:10:08] that i will smash the mouth for the
[1:10:10] enemy he said he'd be my adversary he'd
[1:10:13] be my advocate and he'd be an adversary

[1:11:43] married
[1:11:44] they don't know
[1:11:45] they don't know what their future is
[1:11:46] going to be like they don't know what
[1:11:48] kind of house they're going to live in
[1:11:49] whether they're going to be in a shannon
[1:11:50] they're going to be in a match some of
[1:11:52] you worry some of you some of you i know
[1:11:55] katie was worried
[1:11:56] lord have mercy she prayed all the way
[1:11:58] down altar
[1:12:01] and i was praying she wouldn't run away
[1:12:05] but some people get nervous some people
[1:12:07] get nervous when they're walking down
[1:12:09] the aisle but you ain't gotta be nervous
[1:12:11] walking down the aisle with the holy
[1:12:12] ghost
[1:12:13] he'll be your guide he'll be your
[1:12:15] sustainer
[1:12:16] he's your everything he's your all in
[1:12:19] all he can get you out of trouble he
[1:12:21] knows how to get you out of trouble when
[1:12:22] you make a mistake and you don't know
[1:12:24] how to get out of it he said i will make
[1:12:26] a way of escape under thee
[1:12:33] there's a lot of nervousness about
[1:12:35] futures
[1:12:39] western state is full of people that are
[1:12:41] nervous and anxiety full of anxiety
[1:12:44] about the future
[1:12:45] go just go do a study through the
[1:12:47] message on deep thinker
[1:12:51] that you're crossing bridges before you
[1:12:52] get there that it causes nervousness and
[1:12:54] condition causes stomach trouble that
[1:12:57] nervous condition causes stomach trouble
[1:12:59] which causes an ulcer notice go study
[1:13:01] those things he said you're always
[1:13:03] taking on somebody else's problems
[1:13:07] and we live in a world where ain't
[1:13:09] nothing but an age of neurotics you've
[1:13:11] got to have a bunch of narcotics to take
[1:13:13] care of the neurotics
[1:13:17] but there's a prophet would stand here
[1:13:19] he would say you you're a deep thinker
[1:13:21] you go through these things you're
[1:13:22] always crossing bridges before you get
[1:13:24] there you're anxious about these
[1:13:25] different things he said but if you'll
[1:13:27] believe me to be his prophet
[1:13:29] he said if you believe me to be his
[1:13:31] prophet will you accept his suffering
[1:13:33] that he took there on the cross for your
[1:13:35] perfect healing
[1:13:36] then you're going to walk away healed
[1:13:38] notice he was able to look into the past
[1:13:42] but he didn't leave him at their past he
[1:13:43] took them to their future
[1:13:49] notice
[1:13:50] this book holds your future
[1:13:53] it holds god's plans but it also holds
[1:13:55] satan's future
[1:14:00] notice what david would say in psalms 31
[1:14:02] and 15
[1:14:05] that my times are in my hand
[1:14:07] deliver me
[1:14:09] deliver me from the hand of my enemies
[1:14:11] and from them that persecute me
[1:14:13] brother branham said in shalom he said
[1:14:14] do as david did put your future in his
[1:14:17] hands he said don't look to anything
[1:14:19] else but david said here he said my time
[1:14:21] is in his hands
[1:14:22] he said my time is in his hand he's my
[1:14:24] rock what is he's revealed to me he is
[1:14:27] the revealed truth that my time is in
[1:14:29] his hands my time belongs to him i am in
[1:14:33] his hand because he holds the time he
[1:14:35] said i don't know what the future holds
[1:14:37] but i know that he holds the future
[1:14:41] so he that holds the future
[1:14:43] holds me
[1:14:45] he said i just put myself in his hands
[1:14:48] he said i walk like david did my time is
[1:14:50] in his hands he knew that god held the
[1:14:53] future he said but david didn't know
[1:14:55] what the future was but he know that god
[1:14:58] had the future and i don't know what the
[1:15:00] future is none of us do but we know
[1:15:03] who holds
[1:15:05] the future
[1:15:07] notice david said my time is in your
[1:15:10] hand
[1:15:11] to think about this that the times of
[1:15:13] your trouble
[1:15:14] are in his hands the time of your the
[1:15:16] time
[1:15:19] excuse me
[1:15:21] i went out to oklahoma
[1:15:24] it was 80 degrees one day and it's 30
[1:15:26] degrees the next day and
[1:15:28] i did everything in the world but try to
[1:15:30] cough up a lung out there
[1:15:32] but notice
[1:15:33] david said my times are in your hands so
[1:15:36] times of prosperity were in his hands
[1:15:38] times of adversity was in his hands time
[1:15:41] of darkness was in his hands time of
[1:15:43] times of times of desertion and
[1:15:45] temptation were all in his hands now
[1:15:48] notice if all these things were in his
[1:15:50] hands surely our joy is in his hands our
[1:15:53] peace is in his hands our comfort is in
[1:15:56] his hands and if these things could be
[1:15:58] trusted over to the hand of the lord
[1:16:00] then why won't we allow our troubles to
[1:16:03] be in his hand
[1:16:05] notice all of our time is at the
[1:16:07] disposal of our good and faithful
[1:16:11] servant jesus christ
[1:16:15] so nothing can happen to you unless god
[1:16:17] allows it
[1:16:18] we are immortal in this world until our
[1:16:22] work on earth is done
[1:16:25] and satan can make all kinds of attacks
[1:16:27] against you he can destroy he can
[1:16:29] destroy your character he can try to
[1:16:31] destroy your mind he can try to destroy
[1:16:33] your reputation but we're not like the
[1:16:36] church of years gone by we're not living
[1:16:38] off of past reputations
[1:16:40] we're living off a future reputation
[1:16:43] that we're not going to be lived leaving
[1:16:45] left here like the rest of the rest of
[1:16:47] the cannon fodder but there's a world
[1:16:50] that's calling our name there's a world
[1:16:52] that's calling us to come up a little
[1:16:54] bit higher and satan can send his
[1:16:56] threats and satan can send his ideas but
[1:16:59] we've had a prophet
[1:17:02] we've had a prophet say that you're an
[1:17:04] invincible army that you're too powerful
[1:17:07] to be defeated
[1:17:11] satan will warf you
[1:17:13] hit war with you but my future is in his
[1:17:16] hands
[1:17:17] he'll make you sick and put you in a
[1:17:19] corner but god has my future
[1:17:23] the doctors can whisper all kinds of
[1:17:25] things but god has your future
[1:17:28] men can give up on you
[1:17:30] friends can walk away from you sickness
[1:17:33] can rob you but god has your future
[1:17:40] i don't know about what's going to
[1:17:41] happen god's got this
[1:17:43] god ain't shook up god ain't in surprise
[1:17:46] god ain't looking god ain't upset by who
[1:17:48] ain't in here and who ain't setting in
[1:17:50] their rightful place god knows where
[1:17:52] they're at
[1:17:54] god's gonna have a body and it won't be
[1:17:57] a freak body it won't be a hitless body
[1:18:01] he's going to have every part sitting at
[1:18:04] the members place
[1:18:06] you ain't got to worry about the pew
[1:18:07] besides you god's already got it figured
[1:18:10] out you said well i all this has got to
[1:18:13] happen that's got to happen and this has
[1:18:15] got to do this i got to lay my hands on
[1:18:17] them no you're putting god in a box
[1:18:19] you're trying to say god's got to do
[1:18:20] this before it can do that
[1:18:23] god's got your future god's got your
[1:18:25] family god's got your money god's got
[1:18:28] your health god's got your future
[1:18:33] i'm gonna preach with you and preach
[1:18:34] without you this evening but satan can
[1:18:36] do everything that he wants to do he can
[1:18:39] try to stop god's plan but god doesn't
[1:18:41] try to do anything when god says
[1:18:44] something he does it
[1:18:47] and god said that i am for you and there
[1:18:49] is no weapon that is formed against you
[1:18:52] that shall prosper i trust him with my
[1:18:55] life i trust him with my health i trust
[1:18:58] him
[1:19:02] satan can go around like a roaring lion
[1:19:04] seeking whom he may devour but he ain't
[1:19:06] gonna get me
[1:19:08] he ain't gonna give me i got enough
[1:19:10] courage to look at devil in the face and
[1:19:12] said you lost the battle 2 000 years ago
[1:19:15] you will lose it again
[1:19:18] i got enough courage to believe that i
[1:19:20] am a part of this bride that the bride
[1:19:23] is a part of the group
[1:19:27] what's he doing
[1:19:29] what does that bride do
[1:19:31] over in the eastern countries when it's
[1:19:33] a wedding going on
[1:19:35] when it's a union going on
[1:19:37] she takes her veil and places it over on
[1:19:40] his shoulders
[1:19:42] and it's saying
[1:19:43] that he is now responsible for her
[1:19:48] i take her under my full control
[1:19:51] i will be her head
[1:19:53] i will beat her protector
[1:19:56] i will be there in the dark moments
[1:20:00] i will be there in the good moments i
[1:20:02] will be her power i will be her strength
[1:20:11] don't look ahead
[1:20:13] look up
[1:20:17] don't be crossing bridges before he get
[1:20:19] him look up
[1:20:21] he said my time is in his hands and just
[1:20:23] like a river just like a river out there
[1:20:26] that we drive past so many times that
[1:20:28] river that stream can never get higher
[1:20:30] than its source it's coming from
[1:20:32] somewhere
[1:20:37] it's coming from somewhere
[1:20:40] the stream can't get no higher than a
[1:20:42] source
[1:20:43] and you can't get no higher than your
[1:20:44] god
[1:20:46] you can't get no higher than the
[1:20:48] fountain so let me put it to you like
[1:20:50] this troubles can do what they want to
[1:20:53] but they'll never get higher than god
[1:20:56] sickness can do what it wants to but i
[1:20:58] never get higher than god your desires
[1:21:01] can do what they want to but they'll
[1:21:02] never get higher than god
[1:21:05] this ain't some legal agreements you've
[1:21:06] got with god saying god if you do this
[1:21:08] or god if you do that god's got an
[1:21:10] unconditional covenant with you
[1:21:12] notice this ain't a legal agreement
[1:21:14] between the husband she ain't got some
[1:21:16] prenuptial agreement that if you do this
[1:21:18] or i'll do that all the money's gone god
[1:21:20] ain't got some prenup set up for you
[1:21:23] this is a union it's a life it's a holy
[1:21:26] ghost
[1:21:28] he's the head we're the body i just
[1:21:30] simply choose to listen i
[1:21:33] [Applause]
[1:21:35] i ain't like somewhere some women that
[1:21:37] they're the neck of the head and they
[1:21:39] roll that thing everywhere they want to
[1:21:42] i wear the pants in the family brother
[1:21:45] if you've got to say you wear the pants
[1:21:46] in the family you don't wear the pants

[1:21:51] i ain't turning him he's turning me
[1:21:58] he's got the whole
[1:22:00] world
[1:22:01] in his hands
[1:22:05] oh you just wait till he gets home early
[1:22:09] i show him something different oh no
[1:22:10] this is a union this is a love affair
[1:22:15] this ain't something that was set up in
[1:22:17] a lawyer's office this was set up before
[1:22:19] the foundation of the world and i got a
[1:22:21] promise for you god's not going to leave
[1:22:23] you he's not going to forsake you he'll
[1:22:26] be with you even in you to the end of
[1:22:28] the world
[1:22:29] grieve not you the holy spirit whereby
[1:22:31] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:22:34] redemption
[1:22:36] satan can do everything he wants to but
[1:22:38] the bible said jesus said when he was
[1:22:40] talking about the door he said i am i am
[1:22:43] the door and he said i give unto them
[1:22:45] eternal life and they

[1:25:37] of god's hands
[1:25:43] he can attack you and give threats
[1:25:45] he can prophesy your demise
[1:25:48] but you will not go down to feed it
[1:25:51] you got a sign
[1:25:53] you got a sign
[1:25:55] brother branham would preach a true sign
[1:25:57] overlooked
[1:25:58] and when jesus was walking on the shores
[1:26:00] of galilee they overlooked him
[1:26:02] they missed him
[1:26:03] but you've not missed him you've
[1:26:05] entertained him you've worshipped him
[1:26:08] you've said at his feet
[1:26:10] you said thou art worthy thou art worthy
[1:26:14] to be praised
[1:26:16] you're entertaining the one that set you
[1:26:18] free
[1:26:19] it's a sign
[1:26:21] it's a sign this ain't some man worship
[1:26:24] this ain't some prophet worship it's a
[1:26:27] king of king that you're worshiping
[1:26:30] you won't just get it finished here we
[1:26:32] will be doing it throughout the
[1:26:34] eternities of the eons of time
[1:26:39] i'm trying not to go there but i am
[1:26:42] worshiping him
[1:26:43] not
[1:26:44] i am worshiping him not because of what
[1:26:47] he got me out of
[1:26:49] i'm not worshiping him not of what he
[1:26:51] got me out of i'm worshiping him what he
[1:26:54] saved me from
[1:26:55] [Applause]
[1:26:57] my own choices got me in trouble my own
[1:27:00] choices let me down wrong roads my own
[1:27:02] choices but his election
[1:27:05] his election overrode my decision
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:11] even when i thought i wasn't worthy
[1:27:13] enough he said you will be my messiah in
[1:27:17] this world
[1:27:19] [Applause]
[1:27:21] you're a sign
[1:27:24] i'm not i'm not even going i
[1:27:26] i ain't got the five pages of notes but
[1:27:28] i i ain't gonna get to them all
[1:27:32] but you're a sign
[1:27:33] you're assigned to the rest of this
[1:27:36] dying generation that there is freedom
[1:27:38] in the kingdom of heaven
[1:27:40] there is liberty where the spirit of the
[1:27:42] lord is you're a sign and when the
[1:27:45] veterans when they were coming back from
[1:27:46] the wars they said that when they got up
[1:27:49] there and they got a pair of them
[1:27:50] harbors and they began to see that woman
[1:27:53] that was standing there with a torch in
[1:27:54] her hand they said that was a sign of
[1:27:57] their liberty they said everything that
[1:28:00] they loved was on the other side i want
[1:28:03] to say this to you there's a lady that's
[1:28:05] standing in this day she's an elected
[1:28:07] lady
[1:28:08] she's been chosen to stand in the harbor
[1:28:11] you can go and you can crash around her
[1:28:13] the waves can roll around her but she's
[1:28:16] got the fire of the holy ghost sitting
[1:28:18] at the throne room of her heart
[1:28:20] and it's a sign to lay out a seal that
[1:28:22] if he sets you free
[1:28:25] he can set your brother free he can set
[1:28:27] your wife free
[1:28:30] you are assad that whom the son is set
[1:28:33] free
[1:28:36] is free
[1:28:41] oh it's good to be free
[1:28:43] it's good to be free
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:50] you're a sign
[1:28:53] you're a
[1:28:54] sign brother brown preached signs of his
[1:28:57] time
[1:28:58] voice of the sign
[1:29:00] super sign
[1:29:02] the messiah signed and he would come
[1:29:04] down and he preached modern events made
[1:29:06] clear by prophecy
[1:29:08] i mean no
[1:29:09] we know that a sign
[1:29:11] points you
[1:29:12] either where you're going or where
[1:29:14] you're at
[1:29:16] it's what a sign does
[1:29:17] it points you where you're at or where
[1:29:19] you're going
[1:29:20] and we realize that that men of old
[1:29:22] they've seen the times by the prophet's
[1:29:25] prophecy
[1:29:26] abraham was led by a voice he'd heard
[1:29:28] that voice it said it said get apart get
[1:29:32] a party heard that voice said everywhere
[1:29:34] you look everywhere you look eastward
[1:29:36] westward northward every southward
[1:29:39] everywhere you look it's yours he wasn't
[1:29:41] just giving him that land so he had
[1:29:43] something to look at he was giving him
[1:29:45] some possession
[1:29:48] he didn't give you this message just so
[1:29:50] you can look at it he didn't give you
[1:29:52] this word so that you could look at it
[1:29:53] he'd give you a possession
[1:29:56] walk through this land have some troops
[1:29:58] go out josh walk through this possess it
[1:30:01] but abraham had heard a voice that told
[1:30:03] him that you're going to have a son and
[1:30:05] it won't be it won't be is me hell but
[1:30:07] it'll be a son and his name should be
[1:30:09] isaac he'd heard that voice all of his
[1:30:11] life he listened to that voice he told
[1:30:13] him that about a promised son
[1:30:17] he told him i'd be your seahawk he told
[1:30:19] him i'll be your buckler
[1:30:20] he heard it it was a promise to him but
[1:30:23] when melchizedek came
[1:30:25] it was vindicated that this was the time
[1:30:28] for isaac to show up
[1:30:31] and isaac was the fulfillment of what
[1:30:33] that voice had spoken
[1:30:36] jonah was a sign
[1:30:38] he was assigned to those heathens
[1:30:42] when he didn't want to go down there
[1:30:45] he didn't want to go down there and bust
[1:30:46] a bunch of layout of scenes and tell
[1:30:48] them that god's still safe
[1:30:50] he didn't want to go down there and a
[1:30:51] bunch of heathens and tell him that god
[1:30:53] could get him out of it
[1:30:56] he said oh brother brandon said oh don't
[1:30:58] make fun of him
[1:30:59] he said he wasn't backslid he was right
[1:31:01] moving right into the plane of god
[1:31:04] he said there's some people that make
[1:31:05] fun of him and call him backslidden
[1:31:07] telling me what say jonah wasn't a
[1:31:08] christian he said but they'll sit there
[1:31:10] in their pew and look at their symptoms
[1:31:11] and say well if god won't do it for me
[1:31:13] then i'm not gonna serve him
[1:31:16] but jonah got down there in the belly of
[1:31:18] that prepared fist for him and he said
[1:31:20] all these things are lying vanities
[1:31:23] you see he was moving right into the
[1:31:25] perfect plan of god's sign and he had to
[1:31:28] be swallowed by a prepared fist and it
[1:31:30] went to the bottom of the bottom of that
[1:31:32] sea but when he come out and he sowed
[1:31:35] his sign to those ninevites
[1:31:37] those ninevites worshipped that whale
[1:31:40] they worshipped that sea god and when
[1:31:43] they saw that man walk out of there it
[1:31:45] was a sign to them but they didn't just
[1:31:48] look at the sign they heeded the voice
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:31:54] john the baptist was a sign of
[1:31:55] preparation
[1:31:57] he was a sign of preparation that
[1:31:58] there's one coming after me he was a
[1:32:00] forerunner to the messiah there's a
[1:32:02] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:32:04] and john would stand there and say i
[1:32:06] indeed baptize you with water but the
[1:32:08] one that is coming after me is greater
[1:32:10] than me he will baptize you with the
[1:32:12] holy ghost and with the fire
[1:32:14] he was pointing to one that was coming
[1:32:17] john was a signpost to get ready
[1:32:20] but when jesus was standing there on the
[1:32:22] jordan river he wouldn't say he was
[1:32:24] coming he was saying that he's here
[1:32:28] notice what brother mayor said in super
[1:32:30] sign he said he said he said god showed
[1:32:32] abraham the end from the beginning of
[1:32:34] what was going to take place god
[1:32:35] manifested in a man his super faith son
[1:32:38] man that could destroy this son they
[1:32:41] that man could not destroy this son he
[1:32:43] said they could destroy isaac they could
[1:32:45] destroy jacob and successors after them
[1:32:48] but this super son
[1:32:51] this super son could not be destroyed
[1:32:54] abraham the seed of abraham this faith
[1:32:56] that not by it not the natural seed but
[1:32:59] the faith that abraham received not by a
[1:33:02] law of circumcision but by the faith in
[1:33:04] the word and abraham's super faith son
[1:33:07] which was jesus christ now all his other
[1:33:09] sons died but this son could not be
[1:33:12] killed he was killed but he couldn't
[1:33:14] stay dead and the grave couldn't hold
[1:33:16] him
[1:33:17] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:33:20] forever
[1:33:21] notice when jesus was standing there he
[1:33:23] was standing there and he he would heal
[1:33:25] the sick he healed the blind he healed
[1:33:28] the blind of god he healed the lepers
[1:33:30] when he stood there and he took five
[1:33:31] loaves and fishes he blessed them and
[1:33:34] they broke them
[1:33:35] and they followed him they followed him
[1:33:38] for the sign
[1:33:41] but when the voice began to say that i
[1:33:43] and my father are one
[1:33:45] the voice changed their direction
[1:33:48] they were only following it for the
[1:33:50] signs
[1:33:51] now we know that the bible says in mark
[1:33:53] 16 that these signs shall follow them
[1:33:56] that belief
[1:33:58] well you guys ain't nothing but a bunch
[1:34:00] of sign followers you know some
[1:34:03] it's a funny thing what jesus said right
[1:34:05] there he said these signs shall follow
[1:34:07] them
[1:34:10] everywhere i go on monday they follow me
[1:34:13] on tuesday they follow me
[1:34:15] [Applause]
[1:34:17] i have received my son it is the son of
[1:34:20] man again in body form
[1:34:27] these signs shall follow them that
[1:34:29] belief and if we are preaching a message
[1:34:32] doctrine it'll produce message works
[1:34:35] if we approach it if we're preaching
[1:34:38] john 14 12 that the works that i do
[1:34:41] shall you do also
[1:34:42] then these signs will follow you
[1:34:47] he said have faith in god speak unto
[1:34:49] this mountain and have so how you pray
[1:34:51] whatsoever things you pray when you pray
[1:34:53] desire whatsoever things you desire when
[1:34:55] you pray believe them and you shall have
[1:34:58] them
[1:35:01] let me say this if we're preaching a
[1:35:03] baptist theology what we will get is a
[1:35:06] bunch of baptist setting here
[1:35:08] if we're preaching a methodist theology
[1:35:10] we'll get a bunch of methodist setting
[1:35:12] here but if we're preaching the message
[1:35:14] we'll get a bunch of eagles
[1:35:16] [Applause]
[1:35:18] the reason why the rest of the world
[1:35:20] can't follow this into their future is
[1:35:23] they weren't destined to fly up here
[1:35:28] but you are not some earthbound chicken
[1:35:32] [Music]
[1:35:34] you are built for another level
[1:35:37] let me say this your future is not just
[1:35:40] to come to church and just to lift your
[1:35:42] hands every once in a while and lift
[1:35:44] your hands and praise him and sing to
[1:35:46] him and go out the same way you walked
[1:35:48] in your future is to walk out of here
[1:35:52] be so much like jesus that one of these
[1:35:54] days that you'll have a testimony just
[1:35:56] like enoch did that
[1:35:58] that he had this testimony that he
[1:36:00] pleased god
[1:36:02] and one of these days when the spirit of
[1:36:04] the lord gets to move in you're going to
[1:36:06] walk like enoch walk and you're going to
[1:36:08] change like sarah changed
[1:36:17] i just happen to believe you can call me
[1:36:19] crazy you can say i'm a fool but i
[1:36:22] happen to believe that i'm one of these
[1:36:23] last final runners of this message
[1:36:26] that's going to run this thing right in
[1:36:28] not into the grave but i'm going to run
[1:36:30] this thing right into the rapture
[1:36:34] you forgive me
[1:36:36] you might think we're too much but i
[1:36:38] happen to believe that full gospel
[1:36:40] lighthouse is a part of that body
[1:36:45] that in a moment
[1:36:48] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:36:53] this mortal will put on immortality
[1:37:01] what is this happening in these services
[1:37:05] you get so high and lifted up there
[1:37:06] sometimes i'm preaching man i feel like
[1:37:08] i could jump through the roof
[1:37:10] hey sometimes i feel like i could jump
[1:37:12] better than michael jordan and grab hold
[1:37:13] of that chandelier man i could just do
[1:37:16] something and sometimes
[1:37:18] i better not
[1:37:20] for the fan you better be close to
[1:37:22] something like it happens
[1:37:23] something bad gonna happen to me
[1:37:26] but you watch it you get the praising
[1:37:28] god and all of a sudden you begin to let
[1:37:30] loose
[1:37:31] you begin to move into another
[1:37:32] atmosphere you are getting that you are
[1:37:34] getting a temporary rapture you're
[1:37:37] moving from this world
[1:37:41] when i say this world i'm talking about
[1:37:42] your troubles i'm talking about what you
[1:37:44] went through this week i'm talking about
[1:37:46] what your boss said about you i'm
[1:37:48] talking about your wife what she said
[1:37:49] about you when you move out of this
[1:37:51] flesh world and you move in past what
[1:37:54] you see see past what you see and think
[1:37:57] past what you think and you get a
[1:37:59] temporary
[1:38:00] rapture it's only a sign
[1:38:04] it's only a sign that there's one coming
[1:38:07] that one of these days you're going to
[1:38:08] be worshiping so much
[1:38:11] oh no you ain't going back down there no
[1:38:14] more
[1:38:17] you don't have to live with troubles no
[1:38:18] more
[1:38:19] this is a sign
[1:38:24] there's a body
[1:38:26] that's got to be connected to a headship
[1:38:36] you got a few more minutes and i'll
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:40] i'll try to get you to where i'm where
[1:38:42] i'm going
[1:38:45] moses met that pillar of fire
[1:38:48] paul met that pillar fire
[1:38:50] it was that same
[1:38:51] you forgive me for being stuck on this i
[1:38:53] know that you've been i know you've been
[1:38:55] hearing me say these things but it's in
[1:38:56] my spirit but
[1:38:59] moses had met that pillar fire and paul
[1:39:01] had met that pillar fire he was able to
[1:39:04] go further than what the disciples had
[1:39:06] walked
[1:39:08] they said they walked with him he jesus
[1:39:11] everybody walk of jesus down on the
[1:39:12] street but paul had an experience that
[1:39:14] was higher than just walking with him he
[1:39:17] met him after his ascension
[1:39:20] and what was it when he seen him it was
[1:39:22] the same pillar of fire that was leading
[1:39:24] the children of israel and when jesus
[1:39:27] was standing there when jesus was
[1:39:29] standing there in front of the sanhedrin
[1:39:31] court he said that i am before abraham
[1:39:34] was i am it was that same pillar of fire
[1:39:37] in the body of jesus
[1:39:41] when moses got up there and he'd seen

[1:42:48] he's not just god over the nile but he's
[1:42:49] god over the god of the mouth and if you
[1:42:51] go to studying out egyptian history
[1:42:53] you'll go back there and you'll find
[1:42:55] that they got a god that they call happy
[1:42:59] anybody heard of that dude today
[1:43:01] if you're happy and you know it fill
[1:43:04] your wallet
[1:43:05] if you're happy and you know it
[1:43:07] inflation won't hurt
[1:43:12] but they got a god down there man i'm
[1:43:14] having too much fun up here
[1:43:16] they got a guard back here that they
[1:43:18] call hoppy hoppy
[1:43:20] hey
[1:43:21] tell me help me help me help help me
[1:43:25] i'm gonna try to contain myself right
[1:43:26] here
[1:43:28] but this god hoppy
[1:43:30] you know the egyptians were connected
[1:43:33] with that now if you take the nile away
[1:43:35] from them you take away their prosperity
[1:43:37] you take away their business you take
[1:43:39] away their livelihood
[1:43:42] and he was saying that i'm not just god
[1:43:44] of the over the now but i'm god of the
[1:43:46] god of the nile and that god happy that
[1:43:50] he has his name means the god of
[1:43:53] fertility
[1:43:54] and the god
[1:43:56] of life
[1:43:57] and god was not willing that this sound
[1:44:00] would be overlooked
[1:44:02] god was not willing that these things
[1:44:04] would stand in their way he was showing
[1:44:07] to them that he was god over everything
[1:44:10] he was god over the nile he was god over
[1:44:13] god's the one of life god's the one of
[1:44:15] fertility god's a sustainer
[1:44:20] ain't even pertaining to you
[1:44:27] let me say this in a little more clear
[1:44:28] view for you death ain't got a voice
[1:44:33] death ain't got a voice death can't
[1:44:35] speak to you little bride
[1:44:38] death can't even talk to you ron spencer

[1:44:43] way of the grave you were birthed here
[1:44:45] to overcome cancer
[1:44:50] and
[1:44:51] the god of the nile is not the one that
[1:44:53] makes you fertile
[1:44:54] the god of the bible the same god
[1:44:57] william branham introduced to us is the
[1:44:59] god of the miracle

[1:45:07] brother bannon said those two voices
[1:45:09] those two signs had a voice behind him
[1:45:12] he said they wasn't just talking about
[1:45:14] what moses is going through it was a
[1:45:17] sign of their future deliverance
[1:45:26] you didn't just follow this voice
[1:45:28] for the fishes and the loaves you didn't
