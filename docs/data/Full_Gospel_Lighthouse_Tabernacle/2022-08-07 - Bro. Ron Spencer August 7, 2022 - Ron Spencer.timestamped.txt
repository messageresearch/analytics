[43:13] loud voice
[43:16] for
[43:17] all the mighty works that they had seen
[43:21] saying blessed be the king that cometh
[43:23] in the name of the lord peace in heaven
[43:27] glory in the highest
[43:30] some of the pharisees
[43:32] among whom the multitude said unto him
[43:35] master rebuke thy disciples that
[43:38] spirit's not dead
[43:41] and he answered and said unto them i
[43:43] tell you that
[43:45] if these should hold their peace
[43:49] the stones
[43:51] would immediately
[43:53] cry out

[44:38] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[44:41] world and preach the gospel to every
[44:43] creature
[44:44] and he that believeth and is baptized
[44:47] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[44:49] shall be damned
[44:51] these signs shall follow them that
[44:54] believe
[44:56] we're believers aren't we
[44:58] in my name shall they cast out devils
[45:02] they shall speak with new tongues
[45:05] they shall take up serpents and if they
[45:07] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[45:09] them and they shall lay hands on the
[45:12] sick and they shall recover
[45:16] we
[45:17] are commissioned to be a church in
[45:20] action
[45:23] we're not clubs and we're not just a
[45:25] group of a clique or a cult we're a
[45:28] church in action
[45:34] let me just say this to you this won't
[45:35] offend believe us
[45:38] children of god but it does offend the
[45:40] devil
[45:42] the scripture in in psalms chapter 100
[45:45] of verse 4 enter into his gates with
[45:48] thanksgiving
[45:50] and into his courts with praise and be
[45:54] thankful unto him and bless his name
[45:58] if there's anybody that we ought to be
[46:00] thankful to and that's our god
[46:04] brother brown said
[46:06] the people
[46:08] said you make too much noise
[46:12] he said this is the quietest place that
[46:14] you will ever live in
[46:17] if you go to heaven even the angels are
[46:20] singing day and night holy holy unto the
[46:23] lord and if you go to hell
[46:26] it's weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[46:28] teeth
[46:29] this is the quietest place that you'll
[46:33] ever live in
[46:36] nicolaitan
[46:38] he said and what did the
[46:40] nicolaitans asked for
[46:42] it asked to get people away from a bunch
[46:45] of people that shouts
[46:47] claps their hands
[46:49] looks like it's disgracefully
[46:52] like they did at pentecost act like
[46:55] drunk men staggering in the spirit
[46:59] they didn't want none of that stuff
[47:02] they said they were drunk
[47:04] and when that when the celebrity he said
[47:06] listen don't miss this
[47:08] it's it may sound crazy to you but it's
[47:10] the truth when the dignitaries begin to
[47:14] come in
[47:15] they didn't want to stoop to that
[47:19] amen
[47:22] man
[47:42] a man spoke to brother branham said i
[47:44] was enjoying your son billy i was
[47:46] enjoying your sermon until that woman
[47:48] raised up and started crying
[47:51] said how in the world could you preach
[47:54] and her acting like that
[47:57] i said that's the only time i can preach
[48:00] [Applause]
[48:01] when i see that power of god is caught
[48:03] away in the church and caught away with
[48:05] the message
[48:06] he said it just made shivers go all over
[48:09] my back
[48:11] i want you to just listen to our
[48:13] prophet's response if you'd ever be
[48:15] fortunate enough to get to heaven
[48:21] you'd freeze to death
[48:23] because they're crying and shouting and
[48:25] praising god day and night
[48:28] angels flying back and forth crying holy
[48:31] holy unto the lord
[48:34] now let me just tell you something right
[48:36] now my brother you're living in the
[48:39] quietest world that you'll ever live in
[48:44] if you go to hell there'll be weeping
[48:46] and wailing and gnashing of teeth
[48:51] in revelation
[48:53] chapter 19 and verse 1 and after these
[48:56] things i heard a great voice of much
[48:58] people in heaven saying hallelujah
[49:00] salvation and glory and honor and power
[49:03] into the lord our god for true and
[49:05] righteous are his judgments for he hath
[49:09] judged the great which did corrupt
[49:11] the earth with her fornication hath and
[49:14] avenged our blood of the servants at her
[49:16] hand
[49:17] that's enough to shout at right there
[49:20] and again they said hallelujah and her
[49:22] smoke rose up forever and ever
[49:25] and the four and twenty elders and the
[49:26] four beasts fell down and worshiped god
[49:29] that sat on the throne saying amen
[49:32] hallelujah
[49:37] and the voice came out of the throne
[49:38] saying praise our god all ye his
[49:41] servants ye that fear him both small and
[49:44] great and i heard as if it was a voice
[49:47] of a great multitude has a voice of many
[49:51] waters a voice of mighty thundering
[49:54] saying hallelujah for the lord god
[49:57] omnipotent reigneth
[50:02] let us be glad and rejoice
[50:06] let us be glad to rejoice
[50:09] and give honor to the man to him for the
[50:12] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[50:15] wife has made herself ready
[50:20] now listen we could read about jonah and
[50:22] rejoice we're going to read about
[50:23] abraham and rejoice but we're reading
[50:26] about ourselves right here
[50:31] we are his wife
[50:33] and to her was granted that she should
[50:35] be arrayed in fine linen
[50:38] clean and white for the fine linen is
[50:40] the righteousness of saints
[50:43] and he which and and he saith unto me
[50:46] right blessed earth they which are
[50:49] called unto the marriage supper of the
[50:51] lamb and he said unto me these
[50:54] are the true
[50:55] sayings of god
[50:58] why should we be so excited
[51:01] as i spoke on friday night in north
[51:04] carolina we are unashamed of worship
[51:08] [Applause]
[51:10] listen let me just say never let your
[51:12] worship bring shame
[51:15] be ashamed to worship god u.s and
[51:18] ashamed to worship the cowboys or the
[51:20] redskins or the yankees
[51:24] or dale earnhardt i'll find you or elvis
[51:27] presley you wasn't ashamed to worship
[51:30] some humanity don't let the devil put
[51:33] you in a corner for where you're ashamed
[51:36] to worship god
[51:55] luke 10 and verse 17
[51:57] and the seventy returned again with joy
[52:00] saying lord
[52:02] even the devils are subject unto us
[52:04] through thy name
[52:06] and he said unto them i beheld satan as
[52:08] us lightning fall from heaven
[52:11] behold i give you power to tread upon
[52:14] serpents and scorpions and over the
[52:16] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[52:19] any means hurt you and that prescription
[52:22] is still alive for us
[52:24] put the devil that you're fighting under
[52:27] your feet
[52:31] he wants to boast and rile with you put
[52:33] him where he needs to be
[52:35] under your feet
[52:37] [Applause]
[52:41] walk on him stomp on him
[52:50] notwithstanding
[52:52] in this rejoice not
[52:54] that the subjects are
[52:56] subject unto you
[52:58] but rather rejoice
[53:00] boy this is powerful
[53:02] but rather rejoice because your names
[53:06] are written in heaven
[53:11] let me just say this you if you were
[53:14] eternal there you always will be eternal
[53:18] if god thought of you before the
[53:20] foundation of the world there's not a
[53:22] devil in hell that can take you from
[53:24] that position
[53:26] i don't care what trial i don't care
[53:28] what temptation i don't care what
[53:30] difficulty that you'll have to go
[53:32] through in life god's got a host of you
[53:35] and he will not lose one
[53:48] it's not you holding on to him
[53:52] it's not you going from one revival to
[53:54] another revival and it's all based on
[53:56] your feelings
[53:58] it's not you gotta hold to him he's
[54:01] gotta hope to you
[54:04] [Applause]
[54:11] in that hour
[54:14] jesus
[54:15] rejoiced
[54:17] in the spirit
[54:20] i've always thought that was such a
[54:21] powerful scripture
[54:24] it's not written anywhere else
[54:27] jesus was more than just had a little
[54:29] hand up
[54:32] evidently he had himself
[54:35] an old-fashioned
[54:36] holy ghost breakdown
[54:40] because he knew who he was
[54:42] and he knew what he was getting ready to
[54:44] accomplish
[54:46] and there wasn't one name that was
[54:48] written in the lamb's book of life that
[54:50] was going to be lost and he knew that
[54:53] there was not a devil in hell that could
[54:54] defeat him
[54:57] and when he would breathe his last
[54:59] breath he would pay the price but he
[55:01] could say you can lay this life down and
[55:04] in three days i'll take it up again
[55:07] no man ever speak like this man
[55:10] he knew who he was
[55:12] he came from god and he's going back to
[55:15] god
[55:16] no wonder he can shout
[55:19] we're his children no wonder we can
[55:21] shout
[55:42] psalms 24
[55:45] lift up all your dates
[55:48] hold your gates
[55:50] o-b-u-b-b you lift up
[55:52] ye everlasting doors
[55:55] and the king of glory
[55:59] not 15 kings
[56:03] the king of glory
[56:06] our king brother jean the king of glory
[56:09] shall come in
[56:11] who is the king of glory the lord strong
[56:15] and mighty the lord
[56:18] mighty in battle
[56:22] lift up your heads all your gates
[56:25] lift him up
[56:26] he everlasting doors
[56:28] and the king of glory shall come in
[56:31] who is the king of glory the lord of
[56:34] hosts
[56:36] he
[56:37] is the king of glory
[56:45] and jesus answered to pilate
[56:48] my kingdom
[56:50] is not of this world
[56:56] this is a powerful statement he got to
[56:58] call one angel
[57:01] he gonna call one angel to change the
[57:03] whole scene
[57:04] do you realize when isaiah saw him the
[57:07] the seraph and screaming holy holy holy
[57:09] holy even the scripture said the voice
[57:12] of one shakes the throne
[57:16] an earthquake could take place with one
[57:19] serpent shaking
[57:21] could have changed the whole scene but
[57:23] in his silence
[57:27] saying i'm not the king of this world
[57:30] and my kingdom is not of this world
[57:33] it held them at bay
[57:38] [Music]
[57:41] hallelujah it held them at bay but he
[57:44] knew you was coming
[57:48] he conquered sickness
[57:50] he conquered temptation
[57:52] and when the enemy spit in his face and
[57:54] smote his jaw and he turned it the other
[57:57] side they jerked the beard out of his
[57:59] face and they spit on him he never
[58:01] revolved back
[58:03] he conquered the gate of temptation yes
[58:07] then you say my temper won't let me do
[58:09] it
[58:10] you seed of abraham
[58:12] he conquered it for you
[58:15] when he reviled
[58:16] when he was reviled upon he revolved not
[58:19] back when he was made fun of he held his
[58:23] peace
[58:24] imagine the power that was upon display
[58:30] that power's just not in heaven
[58:32] it's in you
[58:36] you take it to school you take it to
[58:38] work you live with it home it's on the
[58:41] inside of you
[58:45] the scripture says in john chapter 1 in
[58:48] the beginning was the word and the word
[58:50] was with god and was god the same was in
[58:53] the beginning with god all things were
[58:56] made by him and without him was not
[58:58] anything dismayed that was made in him
[59:00] was life and the light was life was the
[59:03] light of men and the light shineth in
[59:06] darkness
[59:07] and darkness comprehendeth it not right
[59:11] verse 10 he was in the world and the
[59:14] world was made by him and the world knew
[59:16] him not he came to his own and his own
[59:20] received him not
[59:22] but as many as received him
[59:25] oh why don't you just shout right now
[59:39] hallelujah while your friends turned him
[59:42] down something ignited on the inside of
[59:45] you
[59:48] [Music]
[59:52] but as many as received him to them he
[59:55] gave power to become the sons of god
[59:58] even to the them that believe on his
[1:00:00] name which were born not of blood nor
[1:00:04] the will of flesh nor the will of man
[1:00:06] but of god
[1:00:09] your new birth did not come by some
[1:00:12] persuasion of some preacher
[1:00:14] your new birth came by god he knew where
[1:00:17] he was at he knew the situation you was
[1:00:20] in he knew the trouble that you was
[1:00:22] going to go through in your life
[1:00:28] and the word was made flesh
[1:00:30] and dwelt among us
[1:00:32] and we beheld his glory
[1:00:35] the glory as the only begotten of father
[1:00:38] full of grace
[1:00:40] and
[1:00:40] truth and when jesus was standing in mar
[1:00:44] in matthew 16 and when jesus came to the
[1:00:47] coast of caesarea philippi
[1:00:50] he asked his disciples saying
[1:00:52] whom do men say that are the son of man
[1:00:54] am
[1:00:56] and they said some say thou art john the
[1:00:59] baptist some elias
[1:01:01] others jeremiahs are one of the prophets
[1:01:04] and he saith unto them but who say ye
[1:01:06] that i am
[1:01:08] and jesus answered and said unto them
[1:01:13] and simon peter answered and said
[1:01:16] thou art the christ
[1:01:21] the son of the living god
[1:01:25] and jesus answered and said it in
[1:01:27] blessed earth thou simon barjona
[1:01:31] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:01:33] unto thee but my father
[1:01:37] which is in heaven
[1:01:39] this is more than a scripture 2 000
[1:01:41] years ago
[1:01:45] sometimes we miss what god's doing now
[1:01:52] miss what god's doing now
[1:01:54] brother brown would go into a city and
[1:01:56] churches all over would boycott the
[1:01:58] meeting
[1:02:01] tell their people not to go to the
[1:02:03] meeting because god was doing something
[1:02:08] he was doing something and he would tell
[1:02:11] their people not to go to the meeting
[1:02:12] but yet they'd go theirself
[1:02:17] are you with me
[1:02:19] don't worry god will have a pride
[1:02:23] don't worry
[1:02:28] they boycotted the media but yet god
[1:02:30] sowed the sink
[1:02:33] he knew this church would come
[1:02:36] he knew that you were on the way
[1:02:41] why are you with me
[1:02:42] my brother just shared as brother
[1:02:44] branham flew across ghana and he and he
[1:02:47] wanted to land there he said but there's
[1:02:49] many people there and he just showed a
[1:02:51] church that he that he went to when he
[1:02:54] was in god has about 10 000 people in it
[1:02:57] let me just say this you god's got a
[1:02:59] people
[1:03:01] don't you worry about whether god's
[1:03:03] going to have a bride

[1:03:21] back

[1:08:50] have one person in mind
[1:08:52] destroying their life or they're in the
[1:08:54] car wreck and their car's flipping or or
[1:08:58] or if they're in a bankrupt situation
[1:09:01] and there's no way out
[1:09:03] there's even heathen screamed for jesus
[1:09:06] in the time of trouble
[1:09:09] but this jesus wants to be more than
[1:09:11] your rescuer
[1:09:29] he came from the bosom of the father
[1:09:33] to the bosom of a woman
[1:09:36] he put on humanity
[1:09:38] that we could put on divinity
[1:09:41] he became the son of god
[1:09:44] that we might become sons
[1:09:46] of god
[1:09:49] he came from heaven
[1:09:50] where rivers never freeze
[1:09:53] winds never blow
[1:09:55] frost never chills the air
[1:09:58] flowers never fade
[1:10:00] and no one is ever sick
[1:10:04] there's no undertakers there's no
[1:10:05] graveyards hallelujah no one ever dies
[1:10:11] and no one is ever
[1:10:14] buried he was born contrary to the laws
[1:10:18] of nature
[1:10:20] he lived in obscurity and poverty
[1:10:23] he crossed the boundary of land
[1:10:26] once in his childhood
[1:10:28] he had no wealth and nor influence
[1:10:32] he neither had training or any formal
[1:10:34] education
[1:10:36] his relatives were inconspicuous
[1:10:40] and wasn't influential
[1:10:43] in infancy
[1:10:44] he startled kings
[1:10:46] and boyhood
[1:10:48] he puzzled the wisest of men
[1:10:51] in manhood
[1:10:53] he ruled the course of nature
[1:10:56] he walked on billows and he hushed the
[1:10:58] seed to sleep
[1:10:59] he healed multitudes without medicine
[1:11:02] and made no charge for his services
[1:11:04] he never wrote a book
[1:11:06] yet all the libraries of the country
[1:11:09] could not hold the books that have been
[1:11:11] written about him
[1:11:13] never wrote a song yet all it has
[1:11:15] furnished the theme of more songs than
[1:11:17] all the songwriters combined
[1:11:20] he never founded a college yet all the
[1:11:22] schools together cannot boast of as many
[1:11:25] students as he has
[1:11:27] he never practiced psychiatry yet he has
[1:11:30] healed more broken hearts than doctors
[1:11:32] have healed broken bodies
[1:11:34] he never merced an army or drafted a
[1:11:37] soldier or fired a gun yet no leader has
[1:11:40] more volunteers who have under his
[1:11:43] orders made rebels stack arms and
[1:11:45] surrender without firing a shot
[1:11:51] he is a star of astronomy
[1:11:54] he is the rock of geology
[1:11:57] he is the lion and the lamb of zoology
[1:12:01] he is a harmonizer of all discords he is
[1:12:04] the healer of all diseases
[1:12:07] great men have come and gone yet he he
[1:12:10] lives
[1:12:11] herod could not kill him
[1:12:13] satan could not seduce him death could
[1:12:16] not destroy him and the grave could not
[1:12:19] hold him
[1:12:26] nobody
[1:12:29] can it be said
[1:12:30] of that paragraph right there
[1:12:35] not a man
[1:12:37] from abraham to william branham
[1:12:41] there's none
[1:12:43] like jesus
[1:12:46] and i want to say this you jesus will
[1:12:49] never be one of the boys
[1:12:52] are you with me he's going to be king of
[1:12:54] kings and lord of the lords
[1:12:58] we respond we
[1:12:59] we incredibly respect all the prophets
[1:13:02] but there's none like our lord
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:26] he laid aside the purple robe
[1:13:29] for a passage gown he was rich
[1:13:34] but for our sakes he became poor
[1:13:36] right
[1:13:38] wise men
[1:13:40] and he slept
[1:13:44] in another man's manger
[1:13:49] he cruised ships
[1:13:52] in another lance boat
[1:13:55] he rode on another man's donkey
[1:14:00] he was buried
[1:14:02] in another man's tomb
[1:14:10] everyone else has failed
[1:14:13] but he never
[1:14:17] never failed
[1:14:27] you've heard me read this before
[1:14:30] but i've come to this point
[1:14:32] the devil would have been standing there
[1:14:35] if he would have had an evil thought
[1:14:39] because our thoughts sound louder in
[1:14:41] heaven than they do on earth
[1:14:44] and that perfect sacrifice that was
[1:14:46] tempted by women
[1:14:48] tempted by popularity tempted by the
[1:14:50] kingdoms of this world
[1:14:54] and even being tempted to take it could
[1:14:56] be found innocent
[1:14:59] and you no doubt have thought evil
[1:15:00] thoughts already this morning
[1:15:03] amen
[1:15:04] don't sit with the angel wings
[1:15:10] i thought evil thoughts again this
[1:15:12] morning
[1:15:13] you needed jesus
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:18] you needed jesus
[1:15:20] i want to say this to you i needed jesus
[1:15:24] i couldn't stand here without him today
[1:15:27] [Applause]
[1:15:29] i thank god for great doctors that have
[1:15:31] helped to prolong my life but they can't
[1:15:33] heal me but i'm preaching about one that
[1:15:36] can
[1:15:46] if they went in one side to remove one
[1:15:48] of the tumors it would cause me not to
[1:15:50] be able to walk on one side if they went
[1:15:52] into the other side to get the other
[1:15:54] tumor it would cause me not to have
[1:15:56] cognitive abilities and i wouldn't be
[1:15:58] able to talk but since jesus is in
[1:16:01] charge
[1:16:05] i'll just leave it in the hands of jesus
[1:16:08] and tell the devil he can't touch a hair
[1:16:10] of my body until god's done with me
[1:16:15] what about you this morning what about
[1:16:17] you
[1:16:19] trust this kind of jesus
[1:16:34] that was him when he created the heavens
[1:16:36] and earth
[1:16:41] when he said let there be and he
[1:16:42] believed his own word
[1:16:45] that was him
[1:16:46] when the sun was spoken into existence
[1:16:50] and it was absolutely a perfect degree
[1:16:52] of temperature
[1:16:53] so that this earth that we stand on
[1:16:56] could have winter
[1:16:59] spring
[1:17:00] summer
[1:17:04] and fall
[1:17:06] man wants to talk about
[1:17:08] heating
[1:17:11] you know this climate change
[1:17:13] this earth is going to have a climate
[1:17:15] change
[1:17:20] it's going to i want to say this to you
[1:17:22] i'm a believer in climate change
[1:17:26] i'm not a democrat by no stretch of
[1:17:29] anybody's imaginations
[1:17:35] but i am a believer in climate change in
[1:17:38] a few days
[1:17:41] this baby's gonna burn
[1:17:48] it's gonna burn so don't plan to stay
[1:17:51] it's gonna burn
[1:18:01] she gonna burn
[1:18:03] and if you don't believe me watch the
[1:18:05] next time it rains
[1:18:07] little rain or a flood there comes a
[1:18:10] rainbow
[1:18:12] and it's not for that bunch of gay
[1:18:14] homosexuals out there that's our
[1:18:17] covenant
[1:18:18] [Applause]
[1:18:53] that was him in a cradle
[1:18:56] that was god
[1:18:58] as a baby
[1:19:00] in a cradle
[1:19:03] and god had shepherds to come
[1:19:06] and kings to come
[1:19:08] it shocked the nations that a king had
[1:19:11] come as a baby
[1:19:12] and to which it even spent an abortion
[1:19:15] rate throughout all of the land and they
[1:19:17] killed the babies
[1:19:19] and they killed the babies in egypt
[1:19:21] thinking there was a prophet there and
[1:19:23] they killed it when jesus was there
[1:19:24] that's what they're doing now because
[1:19:26] our king is coming
[1:19:29] but you can't destroy god's seed
[1:19:42] there's him in the cradle
[1:19:47] that's him
[1:19:49] when he controls your disasters
[1:19:52] that's him when he walks into your
[1:19:54] hospital room
[1:19:55] that's him when he goes and takes your
[1:19:58] difficulties
[1:20:00] that's him when he takes your disease
[1:20:02] and tells the devil he can't go no more
[1:20:05] that was god when he healed the blind
[1:20:08] that was god when he healed the lame
[1:20:10] that's god when he healed the cripples
[1:20:15] no disease could stand in the way of
[1:20:18] jesus
[1:20:21] that was god when he raised lazarus from
[1:20:23] the tomb that was god when he raised
[1:20:26] jerry's daughter up that was god when he
[1:20:29] screamed lazarus come forth and all of
[1:20:32] the other dead had to hold their place
[1:20:35] but lazarus could
[1:20:36] scream i heard my savior callin
[1:20:41] and they he told them take the grave
[1:20:43] clothes off he don't need him no more
[1:20:47] loose him and let him go
[1:20:50] oh if we could just hear that today you
[1:20:53] may be dead in your sins
[1:20:55] loose him and let him go take off your
[1:20:59] sinful nature
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:06] that was him on the cross
[1:21:10] but he's not there no more
[1:21:12] so many religions and even churches will
[1:21:14] want to take you back to the cross but
[1:21:16] it's empty today
[1:21:19] that cross is empty it had an enzyme and
[1:21:22] it was extremely important but he's not
[1:21:24] hanging on a cross no more
[1:21:28] that was him in the resurrection
[1:21:33] because he said destroy this temple and
[1:21:35] i'll raise it up again
[1:21:40] that was him conquering hell
[1:21:44] he knocked on satan's door took the keys
[1:21:47] away from him and now satan don't have
[1:21:50] the keys to his own house
[1:21:53] so why should we pray satan's kingdom
[1:21:58] he don't even have arrows for his bow
[1:22:01] he don't have keys to his own house
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:10] that was him walking through the ages
[1:22:12] that was with him with paul
[1:22:16] that was with him with iranians
[1:22:20] that was with him with every messenger
[1:22:23] all the way down through
[1:22:25] each one of them speaking in tongues
[1:22:27] then why should we criticize it now
[1:22:33] why should we criticize worship now
[1:22:37] well i don't believe in this being slain
[1:22:39] in this spirit well you obviously
[1:22:40] haven't heard about john wesley he
[1:22:42] preached with such power until ten
[1:22:45] thousand people would be slain in the
[1:22:47] spirit at the same time
[1:22:49] don't tell me god don't know how to slay
[1:22:51] you in the spirit
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:56] when you get back up you'll be a
[1:22:58] different person
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:13] god
[1:23:14] came in the form of malachi 4.
[1:23:19] and he used a boy from kentucky
[1:23:22] to shape the world
[1:23:26] other ministers around the world would
[1:23:28] grab their inspiration from him
[1:23:31] billy graham being one included or
[1:23:33] robbers being one included oh al jaggers
[1:23:36] all of those men got their inspiration
[1:23:38] and credited brother brianna as being
[1:23:40] the spearhead of the revival
[1:23:44] but god had a bride
[1:23:46] he was not going to bring a church he
[1:23:48] was bringing a bride
[1:23:50] that would be without spot or wrinkle
[1:23:54] a bride that would wash away the creeds
[1:23:56] and the dogmas from our lives
[1:24:00] the denominational systems
[1:24:02] sure they had the bible but the bible
[1:24:04] wasn't open to them
[1:24:07] sure they could powerfully read the
[1:24:08] bible
[1:24:10] but the bible
[1:24:11] is not a good book for you until it
[1:24:13] becomes open
[1:24:15] and once it becomes open and you see
[1:24:17] yourself in the book
[1:24:21] for thessalonians tells us that he's
[1:24:23] been descending down through the ages
[1:24:25] and he's going to have a bride out of
[1:24:27] every age
[1:24:28] overcomers through every age and as we
[1:24:31] stand on the precipice of the cliff
[1:24:33] between here in the tribulation period
[1:24:36] we're not going to be here
[1:24:41] as we see a world that is so volatile
[1:24:52] so incredibly volatile
[1:24:56] my prayer every day is come lord jesus
[1:24:59] come
[1:25:00] my prayer every day is come lord jesus
[1:25:02] come we need a rapture
[1:25:06] we need a body change
[1:25:08] the things that we see
[1:25:10] on a daily basis brother branham and
[1:25:13] souls now in prison described some of
[1:25:15] the things that he would see and he
[1:25:17] called them as dimensions blending out
[1:25:19] of hell
[1:25:22] those things that he describes
[1:25:24] then we see that every day
[1:25:30] as i walked through the airport the
[1:25:32] other day
[1:25:33] i'm a country boy i had never seen naked
[1:25:36] suits
[1:25:38] to where that the the the clothes on a
[1:25:40] person's body
[1:25:42] is just hoes
[1:25:45] nothing under it
[1:25:53] nothing
[1:25:55] under it
[1:25:58] nasty
[1:26:06] nasty
[1:26:14] they're worshiping their god
[1:26:18] their body has become a paint surface
[1:26:25] satan marks his children
[1:26:29] oh but brother on but it says in the
[1:26:30] bible it'll mark it mark mark their
[1:26:32] foreheads
[1:26:35] you've already missed the point
[1:26:38] you already missed the point
[1:26:40] they mark themselves all over the place
[1:26:45] before long they're interacting in games
[1:26:47] that's taken them to another world
[1:26:52] those games to which it's taking them
[1:26:55] listen let me just say this you a young
[1:26:56] man got converted last week
[1:26:59] and he said he said the more marijuana
[1:27:02] that i was on and the more drugs i was
[1:27:05] on
[1:27:06] the natural life became like playing
[1:27:09] a a game
[1:27:12] he said that's the reason people can
[1:27:14] shoot up the community it's because
[1:27:17] they're so high on drugs
[1:27:20] until it's just a game
[1:27:24] that was a boy raised in the message
[1:27:26] preacher's son
[1:27:30] you think those games are not taking
[1:27:32] people somewhere
[1:27:35] oh but it's just an innocent game do you
[1:27:37] think those games are not taking people
[1:27:38] somewhere
[1:27:40] do you think those light drugs are not
[1:27:42] taking people somewhere after a while it
[1:27:44] takes a stronger drug and a stronger
[1:27:46] drug and a stronger drug
[1:27:48] a little pornography will take you into
[1:27:50] home
[1:27:52] it only gets worse and worse and worse
[1:27:54] sin takes you further than you ever
[1:27:56] thought you'd go
[1:28:01] why are we screaming with all the
[1:28:03] passion in our life run to the ark of
[1:28:06] safety
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:18] that's why you need to have your
[1:28:19] children in church
[1:28:22] keeping under the atmosphere
[1:28:29] so that's him
[1:28:31] preaching in camp meetings
[1:28:33] it's the voice behind the voice
[1:28:35] if all you saw was william branham you
[1:28:37] missed the picture
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:40] we're not here to praise a man and give
[1:28:41] a man praise
[1:28:43] although we give him reverence we're not
[1:28:45] here to give one another praise although
[1:28:47] we certainly enjoy one another's gift
[1:28:50] but don't miss the moment when you come
[1:28:53] to church and enter into his gates with
[1:28:55] thanksgiving and into his courts with
[1:28:58] praise to properly give jesus
[1:29:11] brother branham dealt with it
[1:29:13] you can hear him deal with it
[1:29:15] people come and they get an attitude we
[1:29:17] enjoy coming to church
[1:29:19] worshiping the lord
[1:29:20] if we're not too tired
[1:29:31] i'm going quick i'm going quick
[1:29:34] let me just share some things
[1:29:37] psalm chapter 34
[1:29:40] i will bless the lord at all times
[1:29:46] remember this that you have the power of
[1:29:47] life and death in your tongue
[1:29:51] point at it
[1:29:52] just go ahead and point at your tongue
[1:29:54] you have the power of life and death in
[1:29:56] that
[1:29:58] right here
[1:30:00] right here you have the power
[1:30:02] you can create an atmosphere around you
[1:30:04] right here
[1:30:07] you don't do that with your hands you
[1:30:08] don't do it with your feet you do with
[1:30:09] that right there
[1:30:14] you have the power to release negative
[1:30:16] words
[1:30:17] that destroy and
[1:30:27] you ever been in a room
[1:30:29] where that everything was just calm and
[1:30:31] peace one person can walk in a hundred
[1:30:34] people
[1:30:37] and have a mighty
[1:30:40] devil on them
[1:30:42] and destroy the atmosphere in the whole
[1:30:45] room
[1:30:50] that's why we should come to church and
[1:30:52] pray before we get here
[1:30:57] because the devil wants a ride so if
[1:30:59] you're not careful he'll get you in a
[1:31:01] moody new
