[37:04] begin to pierce through the darkness
[37:06] father allow the light of Thy word to
[37:08] come and shine upon us father we're your
[37:11] children and we love you with the every
[37:13] fiber of our being father so we submit
[37:16] this service into your hands Lord Jesus
[37:18] we ask that you would come the mighty
[37:20] Angel would stand up father and you
[37:22] would begin to declare yourself alive
[37:25] like never before in the the name of
[37:28] Jesus Christ and the bride says amen
[37:31] amen do you love the Lord this evening
[37:33] amen amen if you have your Bibles this
[37:35] evening we'd like to look
[37:36] over again over in Joshua chapter
[37:40] 1 Joshua chapter 1 and verse 9 and then
[37:44] also down to Joshua chapter
[37:47] 2 we would like to thank all the the
[37:50] brothers and everybody that's been a
[37:51] part this this past week on the
[37:53] construction project here at the church
[37:55] and and I know that um I know brother
[37:58] Ray and Jonathan and several other
[38:01] brothers have been here throughout the
[38:03] week and uh we just want to say that we
[38:04] greatly appreciate every one of you
[38:06] that's been here been a part of that and
[38:08] and um things are taking shape here and
[38:11] we're making room and God's Building a
[38:14] Church and he's he's putting he's
[38:16] putting people right in place that love
[38:18] this message with all their heart and
[38:21] we're just thankful for what the Lord is
[38:22] doing and what he's going to continue to
[38:24] do right on to the coming of the Lord
[38:25] and we just want to prepare our hearts
[38:28] for whatever he he has in store so we
[38:31] just want to say Lord here here we are
[38:34] here we are you you you use this how you
[38:36] want to amen I'd like to continue to
[38:40] stay in the same vein of thought that
[38:41] we've been in on dividing The
[38:43] Inheritance but I'd like to speak to you
[38:45] tonight on entering Jericho and claiming
[38:48] every possession entering Jericho and
[38:51] claiming every possession Joshua chap 1
[38:54] and verse 9 have not I commanded thee be
[38:57] strong and of a good courage Be not
[39:00] Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[39:03] Lord thy God is with thee withs soever
[39:05] thou goest then Joshua commanded the
[39:08] officers of of the people saying pass
[39:12] through the host and command the people
[39:14] saying prepare you victuals for within
[39:17] three days you shall pass over this
[39:19] Jordan to go in to possess the land
[39:23] which the Lord your God giveth you to
[39:25] possess it then just flip down to
[39:28] chapter 2 and verse one there and just
[39:32] one verse from chapter 2 and Joshua the
[39:34] son of none sent out out of shadam two
[39:37] men to spy secretly say saying go view
[39:42] the land now notice that when when Moses
[39:45] sent out spies in Numbers Chapter 13 he
[39:48] sent it out and gathered the whole
[39:49] congregation together notice that Joshua
[39:52] wasn't going to allow this to be some
[39:54] Uprising here but Joshua sent them out
[39:56] secretly saying and go view the land
[39:58] even Jericho and they went and came into
[40:02] a harlot's house named Rahab and Lodge
[40:05] there may God bless his word he may be
[40:07] seated here in the presence of the Lord
[40:10] Brother bandam I'd just like to just
[40:12] draw this this context tonight just to
[40:15] gather some of these things as we're
[40:17] preaching tonight from the pergamin
[40:19] church age brother brandom said he he
[40:21] said here is the secret of this he said
[40:24] the word is in the bride as it was in
[40:27] Mary the bride has the mind of Christ
[40:30] for she knows what he wants done with
[40:32] the word she performs the command of the
[40:35] word in his name for she has thus sayith
[40:38] the Lord then the word is quickened by
[40:41] the spirit and it comes to pass like a
[40:43] seed that is planted and watered it
[40:46] comes to pass or it comes to full
[40:48] Harvest serving its purpose those in the
[40:52] bride do
[40:53] only his
[40:56] will the those in the bride do only his
[40:59] will not their will not The Bishop's
[41:02] will but only his will no one can make
[41:05] them do otherwise they have thus saved
[41:08] the Lord or they keep still they know
[41:10] that it has to be God in them doing the
[41:13] works fulfilling his own word he did not
[41:16] complete all of his work while in his
[41:18] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[41:21] through the bride she knows that for it
[41:23] has not yet come not yet time for him to
[41:26] do certain things that that he must now
[41:29] do but he will now fulfill through the
[41:32] bride that work which he left for this
[41:36] specific time let's say that together
[41:38] that he left for this specific time now
[41:41] let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our
[41:44] promised land is coming in sight even as
[41:47] theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah
[41:49] Savior and as he represents the end time
[41:51] leader that will come to the church age
[41:54] even as Paul came as the original leader
[41:57] Caleb represents those that stayed true
[42:00] with Joshua remember God had started
[42:02] Israel as a virgin with his word but
[42:05] they wanted something different so did
[42:07] the last day church now notice how did
[42:11] how God did not move Israel or let go
[42:14] let her go into the promised land until
[42:17] it was at it was his own appointed time
[42:20] now the people might have put pressure
[42:21] on Joshua the leader and said the land
[42:24] is ours let's go and take it it sounds
[42:25] like a lot of people in in Acts chapter
[42:27] 2 it said well we're already here we've
[42:29] already seen these things why don't we
[42:31] just go on out there but there was
[42:33] something that God was waiting on it was
[42:35] the Fulfillment of the letter becoming a
[42:37] reality and Joshua he said you're all
[42:40] they said the land's ours let's go take
[42:42] it Joshua you're all through you must
[42:44] have lost your commission you don't have
[42:45] the power that you used to have you used
[42:48] to hear from God and and know the will
[42:50] of God and act quickly something is
[42:52] wrong with you but Joshua but Joshua was
[42:55] a god-sent prophet and he knew the
[42:57] promises of God so he waited for them
[43:00] and he waited for a clear-cut decision
[43:02] from God and when the time came to move
[43:05] God placed the full leadership in when
[43:08] the time came to move God placed the
[43:09] full leadership in Joshua's hands
[43:12] because he had stayed with the word so
[43:15] if we want to be under the commission of
[43:17] our our hour we've got to stay with the
[43:19] Joshua commission we can't get outside
[43:21] of it because God placed the full
[43:23] leadership in the in the hands of Joshua
[43:26] because he stayed with the word so if we
[43:29] want to be in a Joshua commission we've
[43:30] got to stay in the word so God could
[43:33] trust Joshua but he could not the others
[43:36] so we will repeat in this end day the
[43:39] same problems and the same pressures and
[43:41] we notice the same exact things he he
[43:44] that Joshua is under those same problems
[43:46] and under the same pressures and that's
[43:48] where the Church of the Living God is
[43:49] against today that are under the same
[43:51] problems and they're under the same
[43:53] pressures and we realize as the Church
[43:55] of the Living God that the word Reigns
[43:58] Supreme it is preeminent in everything
[44:01] uh in a Christian's life it Reigns
[44:03] Supreme without the word of God we don't
[44:05] move without the word of God as
[44:06] Christians and we know that God has a
[44:09] very specific time that he's going to
[44:11] raise kingdoms up and he's going to
[44:13] raise Kings up to fill that portion or
[44:16] or men or leaders that would step into
[44:18] their place so God has a time that he's
[44:20] going to release a word because you know
[44:23] it was laying in the mind of God that
[44:25] God was going to bring forth a virgin
[44:27] son but it could not come until the time
[44:29] that Mary was in her fulfillment as as
[44:32] the portion of the scripture that was
[44:35] there so God has allotments of times
[44:37] that he's going to release a certain
[44:39] allotment of scripture or prophecy that
[44:42] he will allow to be fulfilled and Joshua
[44:45] was in his commission he was in his time
[44:47] when the prophecy had came for Joshua to
[44:50] come in and fully divide the land out
[44:53] but Joshua was under his full commission
[44:56] standing there
[44:57] depending upon the leadership of the
[45:00] pillar of fire he was laying there under
[45:02] his commission and he was only
[45:04] successful as long as he was under that
[45:06] commission and if men of God ever get
[45:09] outside of their commission and go
[45:10] outside of doing what the message of the
[45:12] hour is saying unto them you will find
[45:15] that they are living powerless as life
[45:17] but notice what Joshua was his
[45:19] commission was to do is to go in there
[45:22] divide the land and he had to fight for
[45:24] every single inch of ground that he was
[45:26] up against it was his job to take all of
[45:29] the children of Israel out of those
[45:31] winds or of the ones that had all the
[45:33] old Fighters had died off but those
[45:35] those that had raised up under Joshua
[45:38] and Caleb's Ministry he was going to
[45:40] take them over there because God had
[45:43] seen a people that were elected to move
[45:45] into a promise that he had seen them in
[45:48] before the foundation of the world and
[45:50] God had given this allotment of of of of
[45:53] the of the promised land over into the
[45:55] hands of the children of Israel and
[45:58] there wasn't going to be anything that
[45:59] would stand against them for fully
[46:01] moving in there God had give them the
[46:04] promise and God had give them the
[46:05] possession didn't matter whether there
[46:07] was Giants over there didn't matter
[46:09] whether if there was atheist over there
[46:11] didn't matter if there was infidels over
[46:13] there didn't matter if there was co-
[46:14] foral Church Believers over there it
[46:16] didn't matter what thing that mattered
[46:18] the only thing that mattered was that
[46:20] God had made the promise and if God made
[46:23] a promise it was good enough for Joshua
[46:25] to move right in there and leave the
[46:27] full inheritance and step right in there
[46:30] and that's the thing about God is that
[46:32] God has a long range
[46:34] Vision you know we in our finite Minds
[46:37] we can only see past or we can only see
[46:39] today or maybe we can see maybe just a
[46:41] week in the future or whatever but God
[46:44] sees all the way out a long range Vision
[46:47] by prophecy he looks out there and see
[46:49] things that we don't see you might be
[46:51] wondering why is God moving in this in
[46:54] this area right here when you wanted to
[46:56] be moving over there but the secret of
[46:58] the key of it is that there is
[47:00] redemption at that is at work there are
[47:02] certain things that God has got to
[47:04] fulfill before he moves over here and
[47:07] takes care of this situation before he
[47:09] goes over there and he destroys he
[47:12] destroys over there in Joshua 10 he's
[47:15] got to come here and move into Jericho
[47:17] because there is a key part laying right
[47:20] here in the midst of
[47:23] Jericho Hallelujah now you begin to do
[47:26] study out you begin to study out this
[47:29] this woman of Grace that Rahab has a
[47:32] very key part to play in the story of
[47:36] redemption it's very powerful study when
[47:38] you begin to study out this this woman
[47:41] it is told To Us by by tradition that
[47:44] she is one of the four most beautiful
[47:46] women in the world according to rabic
[47:50] tradition and she was the ancestor of
[47:53] eight different Old Testament prophets
[47:55] she had a lot to do do with prophecy she
[47:59] had a lot to do with Redemption and you
[48:01] think about this woman this woman of
[48:03] Grace but when you look at her in a
[48:05] certain spot of her life it doesn't look
[48:08] like She's a Lady of Grace but brother
[48:10] Brandon would say it like this that that
[48:11] more Misfortune had led her into the
[48:14] lifestyle and had forced her into the
[48:17] lifestyle that she was living being a
[48:19] pagan or raised up in a pagan family she
[48:22] was forced into this situation that she
[48:24] was living in and many times people
[48:26] people are forced into living that kind
[48:29] of a life that they're they're forced
[48:30] into living at but I want you to know
[48:33] this might shck the socks right off of
[48:35] you but I want you to know that that God
[48:37] will use you just to prove a point to
[48:41] Satan this that God will use you to
[48:43] prove a point to Satan that his plans
[48:46] that he has made threats against your
[48:48] life are not stronger than redemptions
[48:51] claims that God has put on
[48:54] you to think that tonight that God was
[48:56] going to use this little Rahab to prove
[48:59] a point to Satan that everything that he
[49:02] had thought of against this lady that it
[49:05] wasn't strong enough to keep her out of
[49:07] the lineage of Jesus
[49:09] Christ now Satan's got plans for your
[49:12] life he's got plans for your future but
[49:15] redemption's hold on you is stronger
[49:18] than Satan's plans against
[49:21] you I know you may not understand
[49:23] everything that you've been through and
[49:25] you may not understand everything that
[49:27] you're going to go through but God is
[49:29] going to use you to defeat Satan's plans
[49:33] if you can ever figure out in your life
[49:35] that you are Eternal part of God there
[49:37] is nothing going to come there is
[49:39] nothing go that is going to take away
[49:41] from your success as a predestinated
[49:44] seat of
[49:47] God because Satan's Duty Satan's duty is
[49:50] to destroy your life and it doesn't
[49:52] matter how he's going to do it but his
[49:55] duty is to try to dest destroy your life
[49:57] if he will bring in a disease or a
[49:59] cancer whatever it is it what what what
[50:03] what what science or the devil calls it
[50:05] is a disease or CS it cancer but what we
[50:08] know that it is it's a demon possession
[50:12] is that right so Satan comes in and he
[50:15] tries to influence the Church of the
[50:17] Living God he tries to influence them
[50:20] maybe by health or different things what
[50:22] is it what is that disease it's going in
[50:25] there it's doing its Duty it's trying to
[50:27] go in there and destroy your life what
[50:30] is it it's a sale that's got out of
[50:32] place and you watch that one cell that
[50:35] it'll begin to influence another cell
[50:37] and they'll start colliding together and
[50:40] they'll begin to be a growth that takes
[50:42] place that's exactly like the like
[50:44] people that get out of the will of God
[50:46] they simply get out of under the
[50:48] influence and they start colliding
[50:50] against one another and all of a sudden
[50:52] that influence of that person starts
[50:54] taking that person down a wrong
[50:58] road but that's Satan's duty is to take
[51:02] your
[51:03] life but thank God that there is a cure
[51:07] that is greater than the sickness there
[51:09] is an eternal atonement that is greater
[51:12] than your problems there is an eternal
[51:14] atonement atonement that is greater than
[51:16] your
[51:17] sin
[51:19] Rahab was forced into this
[51:22] situation another random would say it in
[51:24] one spot that she didn't even want to do
[51:26] this but she was forced there because of
[51:28] her father being a crippled state that
[51:30] she had to do something for her family
[51:33] and you think that sometimes that you
[51:35] get yourself involved with situations of
[51:38] life because of your family
[51:41] situations well I don't really know if
[51:43] Rahab really was a harlot you study out
[51:46] where she lived at the position of her
[51:48] house proved it proved by where she was
[51:53] living at it proved that her career was
[51:56] that of a harlot she was living on the
[51:59] outside
[52:01] wall and you go to studying out many you
[52:03] begin to study out theologians and
[52:05] different things there's a lot of people
[52:07] that are ashamed to say that Rahab was a
[52:09] harlot even Jo Josephus which is a which
[52:12] is a Jewish scholar and and a theologian
[52:15] he would even say that that that that
[52:17] Rahab was an inkeeper because it it uh
[52:21] It embarrasses some people to say that
[52:24] she was a harlot and maybe she was an
[52:27] inke keeper but we really know may
[52:29] because because the scripture tells us
[52:31] that these two spies went in there and
[52:33] they lodged there but no doubt we
[52:35] understand what Rahab was really running
[52:37] On The Backs side of things she was
[52:40] running on the backside of things and
[52:41] the Bible's very clear about this is
[52:43] that she was a harlot she was a harlot
[52:46] and to think that she's on the outside
[52:48] because she was all the way out there
[52:51] where men didn't want anything to do
[52:52] with
[52:53] her they didn't want anything to do with
[52:56] her
[52:57] but I find it amazing I find it amazing
[53:00] that Rahab had something that the rest
[53:02] of these so-called polished up
[53:04] Christians of today don't have Rahab had
[53:08] Faith she believed when everybody else
[53:11] wouldn't believe there were people that
[53:14] were ashamed or embarrassed to say that
[53:16] she's a harlot but to me it shows the
[53:20] power of
[53:21] Grace it shows that no matter what
[53:24] situation or what house that you're
[53:26] living in you can still be a part of
[53:29] God's economy and play out the part of
[53:32] Prophecy you might be wondering how in
[53:34] the world am I going to play out
[53:35] prophecy in this condition but the Bible
[53:38] tells us that by faith the Harlot Rahab
[53:42] perish not with them that believe not
[53:44] when she had received the spies with
[53:46] peace you begin to think about this that
[53:49] this prostitute had such a powerful
[53:52] testimony that she was
[53:54] testifying pho she was testifying to the
[53:58] two word preachers that had came in
[54:01] there and said we done heard about your
[54:04] God we've heard about your God about how
[54:07] big your God is and how great your God
[54:10] is we've heard about
[54:12] it brother mam said it like this he said
[54:14] now Rahab know that Joshua had this
[54:18] commission she knew that Rahab or Rahab
[54:21] knew that Joshua had this commission and
[54:23] Rahab recognized it before she seen
[54:26] anything thing she know that Joshua had
[54:28] the power of God and that he was going
[54:30] to take that land and she asked for
[54:32] mercy and God granted her mercy now when
[54:35] Joshua came into the land of course we
[54:37] know that she was spared now when Jesus
[54:41] came in there and he showed himself
[54:43] openly to Thomas and said look here's my
[54:45] hands here's my feet he said but blessed
[54:49] are those blessed are those that do not
[54:52] see but still believe Rahab had not seen
[54:56] one work of the miracle working power of
[54:59] Jesus Christ but she heard about it she
[55:02] heard about it look at what happened to
[55:05] Durham North Carolina you heard about a
[55:07] god you saw a God and you made a move
[55:10] towards
[55:13] God look about where you are in your
[55:15] spiritual condition you simply heard it
[55:18] by the hearing of the
[55:19] ear but something happened on the inside
[55:22] of you that drawed your
[55:25] attraction what was it the third pole is
[55:28] the Living
[55:29] Word it cannot be impersonated this
[55:32] ain't some workup let me say this to you
[55:35] there I'm not taking away from the first
[55:36] Pole or the second pole but what
[55:39] attracted you was not the first pole was
[55:42] not the second pole it you're not seeing
[55:44] this in a man's hand you're not seeing
[55:47] this by Vision but you're seeing it by
[55:49] the Living
[55:52] Word and by the Living Word you are
[55:55] taking this word
[55:57] and destroying Satan's
[56:02] stronghold hallelujah what was it it was
[56:05] something it was something there laying
[56:07] on the inside of Rahab that she couldn't
[56:10] necessarily explain what was taking
[56:13] place but something down on the inside
[56:16] something down on the inside of her was
[56:19] calling the Bible would say in Psalms 42
[56:22] Psalms 42 and 7 it's a deep calling
[56:26] to the
[56:28] Deep it's a deep that's calling to the
[56:31] Deep there was something on the inside
[56:33] of this this woman of Grace this woman
[56:36] of harlotry that she had something that
[56:38] she couldn't explain but it was
[56:40] something laying there that she couldn't
[56:43] see it in her natural family she could
[56:45] look back to her Pagan father she could
[56:47] look back to her Pagan mother but it was
[56:49] nothing it was nothing there that would
[56:51] take her to a higher level but it was
[56:54] something on the inside of Rahab
[56:57] it was the Jean seat of
[56:59] God it was something that was drawing
[57:02] her when the rest of Jericho wasn't
[57:04] drawed it was something pulling her when
[57:07] the king of Jericho wasn't draw to it
[57:10] but something on the inside of Rahab
[57:12] made her amen the
[57:15] word she didn't fully see everything she
[57:18] didn't understand the third pole exactly
[57:20] she didn't understand speaking squirrels
[57:22] into existence but she
[57:24] believed she she didn't see Moses open
[57:27] up the Red Sea she didn't see the 10
[57:29] plagues happen down there but she
[57:31] accepted it as thus sayith the Lord how
[57:34] did you get in the
[57:36] building how did you get where you are
[57:39] it was something that was drawing you
[57:42] you were magnetized by the gene seed of
[57:45] God it was something that was pulling
[57:48] you it's a force that you don't see it's
[57:51] the drawing power of the Gospel of Jesus
[57:55] Christ it's amazing when the Gospel of
[57:57] Jesus Christ begins to pull upon
[58:00] individuals when it looks like when it
[58:02] looks like Satan's got a grip on their
[58:04] life but all of a sudden God's gospel
[58:07] Goes
[58:08] Forth his gospel Goes Forth and begins
[58:11] to draw them draw them closer to his
[58:14] side to think that this
[58:18] woman was in a condition a lot worse
[58:21] than most of you sitting here she had a
[58:24] bad name she had a bad reputation she
[58:27] was ill- famed she was beautiful but she
[58:31] was
[58:33] manhandled but notice this that when God
[58:36] gets done with this woman she's going to
[58:39] be virgin in his
[58:41] sight to think where you came from you
[58:44] came out of denominations you came out
[58:47] of a prostitute system but when God gets
[58:49] done with you you are going to be a
[58:52] virgin bride you're not going to think
[58:55] the way of denominations you're not
[58:57] going to think the way of the of a
[58:59] carnal men but you're going to think
[59:03] like a virgin
[59:05] bride If You Can Think Like a Virgin
[59:07] bride you never knew what it was like to
[59:09] be with a man before this invisible
[59:12] Union you're Justified as if you never
[59:15] done
[59:16] it it was this Union brother Timothy
[59:20] that set you on a course
[59:27] been manhandled she'd been manhandled by
[59:28] a lot of
[59:30] men but when Shon was coming by her way
[59:33] brother Jim something different
[59:36] something different was
[59:40] coming so do God does not care about
[59:43] your past reputation God does not care
[59:47] God does not care about your scars God
[59:49] does not care about your complexes God
[59:51] does not care about your memories
[59:54] [Applause]
[59:56] are you hearing me loud and clear if I'm
[59:58] not talking to anybody here I'm talking
[59:59] to somebody on the internet God does not
[1:00:01] care about your complexes God does not
[1:00:04] care about your memories God does not
[1:00:05] care about where you've
[1:00:07] been this woman was a woman of disgrace
[1:00:11] but William Brandon would
[1:00:13] say he would say he said may I add to
[1:00:16] this lady Grace Grace an elected lady a
[1:00:21] chosen
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:00:24] lady you shouldn't have been in the
[1:00:26] picture but
[1:00:28] Grace but
[1:00:31] grace Amazing
[1:00:36] Grace mom said I I can see
[1:00:40] her that's powerful when a prophet's
[1:00:43] going back thousands of years he
[1:00:46] said all the time she knew that this was
[1:00:52] wrong or was it something on the inside
[1:00:54] of her
[1:00:58] all the time she knew that that was
[1:00:59] wrong he said there was something in her
[1:01:01] that told her now that's not right to do
[1:01:03] that she knew it wasn't he said but one
[1:01:06] day do you remember that day what day
[1:01:09] are you talking about I'm talking about
[1:01:11] that day at Calvary that day at Calvary
[1:01:14] you once was one way you once was one
[1:01:17] way but from that day at Calvary you are
[1:01:20] no longer thinking those kind of
[1:01:22] thoughts one day she heard that there
[1:01:25] was a god that was moving her heart be
[1:01:28] to tremble and she found a messenger
[1:01:30] from the great move that had told her
[1:01:32] what was going to take place what did
[1:01:34] she say
[1:01:37] Joshua now Joshua had signs Joshua had
[1:01:40] the same size signs that Moses had he
[1:01:43] said exactly he said but
[1:01:45] Rahab didn't ask to see Joshua
[1:01:50] sign she just heard it she just heard it
[1:01:54] it's a type of a church a type of the
[1:01:56] true church that's been pulled away by
[1:01:58] prostitution I'm a Methodist today I'm a
[1:02:01] Baptist tomorrow I'm a presbyterian the
[1:02:03] next day I'm pulled they are pulled away
[1:02:06] in the prostitution he said but all of a
[1:02:10] sudden but all of a sudden where do you
[1:02:13] hear that word over in the book of Acts
[1:02:17] that all of a sudden there came a sound
[1:02:20] from a Russian Mighty Wind all of a
[1:02:23] sudden what was it in an old test woman
[1:02:26] and in a new testament Lady of
[1:02:29] Grace that all of a sudden a little
[1:02:32] preacher enters into a city and said
[1:02:34] there's a God that lives that lived
[1:02:37] yesterday is the same today his power is
[1:02:40] just the same he does the same works
[1:02:42] that he did when he was here on Earth he
[1:02:44] said his agents are on road are on the
[1:02:47] road he said but now Rahab the Harlot
[1:02:50] known as a harlot she was a type of the
[1:02:52] believer the real believer
[1:02:56] all of a sudden all of a sudden let me
[1:02:59] say this very clearly that Satan did not
[1:03:02] understand what was about to take place
[1:03:04] here he did not understand what was
[1:03:06] about to take place here because this
[1:03:08] was rahab's first opportunity at the
[1:03:11] word and when you read the Bible I want
[1:03:13] you to read it in this way when you see
[1:03:15] two spies I want you to see the
[1:03:18] word that God was using two men the word
[1:03:21] to go into Jericho and this was when she
[1:03:25] encountered the SE two men they were not
[1:03:27] like other men but this was her first
[1:03:29] opportunity at the word and when she saw
[1:03:33] the word there was something brother
[1:03:35] Brandon would say when the word saw the
[1:03:37] word when the word saw the word when
[1:03:40] Rahab that Jean seed of God on the
[1:03:42] inside of her so the word in the message
[1:03:45] of the hour she said I got to get out of
[1:03:47] this mess that I'm
[1:03:49] in Hallelujah that's where God found you
[1:03:53] you are manhandled there were men that
[1:03:55] were doing wrong things to you but there
[1:03:58] were some preachers that came by your
[1:04:00] way there were some gospel message
[1:04:03] preachers that came by your way and when
[1:04:06] the word passed by your
[1:04:08] way you couldn't stay the same
[1:04:13] way when was Rahab different from the
[1:04:16] very time she heard
[1:04:18] it when was you different from the first
[1:04:21] time you heard it something on the
[1:04:23] inside begin to work on the outside
[1:04:26] and before long Eternal Grace wrote your
[1:04:32] story now you're not as bad as Rahab and
[1:04:35] you're not down in Jericho but you still
[1:04:37] got
[1:04:38] walls you still got walls I don't care
[1:04:41] how long you've been in the message I
[1:04:43] don't care if you've been a preacher in
[1:04:44] the message if you still got walls it's
[1:04:47] time to tear them
[1:04:51] down come on Rahab recognize who you
[1:05:02] are what was it from the very first time
[1:05:06] of the preaching of the word Satan was
[1:05:07] losing his grip on
[1:05:10] her it's amazing thing when God comes in
[1:05:13] there and strongholds or strong hands he
[1:05:16] strongholds and grabs a hold of Satan
[1:05:19] and he strong arms him that's the word
[1:05:20] I'm looking for and he strong arms Satan
[1:05:23] said you don't have enough power to keep
[1:05:25] the where they
[1:05:27] are I'm just talking about your sin I'm
[1:05:30] talking about where you are in the
[1:05:31] message Satan does not have enough power
[1:05:34] to keep you in a watered down gospel he
[1:05:38] does not have enough power to keep you
[1:05:40] in some indoctrinated idea that you can
[1:05:43] do whatever you want to and get by with
[1:05:47] it Satan's power is not strong enough to
[1:05:50] keep you out of this message
[1:05:59] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:06:02] Lord so what am I saying to you Hold
[1:06:04] Your Position it might be your first
[1:06:06] time at it but enjoy it because from
[1:06:10] this day forward you'll never be the
[1:06:14] same it's my first time enjoying the
[1:06:17] presence of the Lord but it won't be
[1:06:19] your
[1:06:23] last I remember the day he saved me oh
[1:06:27] from my sin and shame I came up out of
[1:06:30] that water baptized in Jesus
[1:06:34] name it might be my first time hearing
[1:06:37] the message but it won't be the last
[1:06:39] time it might be my first time hearing
[1:06:42] the preach word but it won't be my last
[1:06:44] time it means something to
[1:06:49] me it didn't mean nothing to anybody
[1:06:51] else there in Jericho but it meant
[1:06:53] something to her
[1:06:56] this message may not mean anything else
[1:06:58] to the rest of the world but it means
[1:07:00] something to
[1:07:03] me it may not mean anything to the 70
[1:07:05] that can walk away but I'm like Peter
[1:07:08] Lord to whom would we
[1:07:11] go it may not mean nothing to them but
[1:07:14] it sure means a whole lot to
[1:07:18] me it means something to you if it means
[1:07:22] something to you you'll stick with it
[1:07:25] well something it's something that's
[1:07:27] working you can't explain it but it's
[1:07:29] something that's working it's there it's
[1:07:31] it's real it's a reality it's touching
[1:07:33] you it's it's
[1:07:35] physical you remember that little girl
[1:07:37] that little girl that came up into the
[1:07:38] prayer line came into the prayer line
[1:07:41] had to Embraces on her leg and brother
[1:07:42] brandom said that she didn't have quite
[1:07:43] enough Faith at the time so brother
[1:07:45] brandom set her back there in the corner
[1:07:47] said honey you just sit back there and
[1:07:48] you watch you watch the angel of the
[1:07:50] Lord get to working when the time is
[1:07:53] right I'll bring you back up here
[1:07:55] brother B worth and Doc got to thinking
[1:07:57] brother bam I forgot about her brother
[1:07:59] bam caught it and discerned their heart
[1:08:01] said I ain't forgot about her he said
[1:08:03] about that time he said I begin to feel
[1:08:05] a pulsation of faith on the inside of
[1:08:07] that little
[1:08:07] girl said take her take Embraces off of
[1:08:11] her and she went running out of there
[1:08:13] what was it it was a pulsation of faith
[1:08:16] and Rahab had not seen the hand of God
[1:08:19] but she knew something was different
[1:08:21] there was some power that was pulsating
[1:08:24] on the inside of her her that was
[1:08:26] calling her to a higher level what is it
[1:08:29] it was a pulsation of faith when Noah
[1:08:32] was out there and he got to preach him
[1:08:34] for 120 years but something on the
[1:08:37] inside of Noah when the rest of the
[1:08:39] world was criticizing him he stood right
[1:08:42] there on the word of
[1:08:46] God brother maram said that Noah got in
[1:08:48] a spot one time he said Lord where are
[1:08:50] you and God spoke back to him said no it
[1:08:52] doesn't matter where I am I'm still
[1:08:57] God it doesn't matter where he's at as
[1:09:00] long as he's still God I don't care what
[1:09:03] the doctor say I don't care what critics
[1:09:05] say I don't care what the doctors say or
[1:09:07] what this says that or the other as long
[1:09:09] as God's still
[1:09:11] God as long as he's still on the throne
[1:09:14] as long as he still got a
[1:09:17] promise it's time that you start
[1:09:19] marching into your
[1:09:22] inheritance Noah preach a message Noah
[1:09:27] live the message build the ark live in
[1:09:32] it they came a time when the ark got so
[1:09:35] big that Noah left his home and moved
[1:09:38] into the ark there's coming a time when
[1:09:42] the Church of the Living God gets so
[1:09:44] enveloped by the word of God that she
[1:09:47] gets in the Chariot and The Chariot
[1:09:49] takes her
[1:09:52] home it was a pulsation of faith that
[1:09:54] kept working working at
[1:09:56] Noah he kept working on
[1:09:59] him brother brand said that by that
[1:10:03] pulsation Noah be to look out there
[1:10:05] before he saw rain he started seeing
[1:10:10] clouds come on
[1:10:13] somebody I know it's difficult to get
[1:10:16] your eyes on what you see in the
[1:10:19] natural you get your eyes on your
[1:10:21] prodical you get your eyes on you get
[1:10:24] your eyes on situ ation that you prayed
[1:10:26] about and it's still the
[1:10:28] same but let the pulsation of Faith take
[1:10:30] its work let it move and brother Ram
[1:10:33] said in looking at the Unseen he said if
[1:10:35] these people here in these Wheelchairs
[1:10:37] and on these carts and you that sick to
[1:10:39] die you could ever hear the word of God
[1:10:41] tonight he said don't you try to figure
[1:10:43] it out don't think how long you going to
[1:10:45] be sitting there and don't don't think
[1:10:47] how long you've been sick and think
[1:10:48] about what God said he said there comes
[1:10:50] a pulsation of the Holy Spirit In Your
[1:10:52] Heart saying it's a truth how do you I
[1:10:55] know it's the truth the devil said I
[1:10:57] know it's the truth it's God's word it's
[1:10:59] a truth something begins to pulsate on
[1:11:02] the end of your bosom he said that is
[1:11:04] that it is the truth then make
[1:11:08] ready you give me a paper tow or
[1:11:11] something I got to do better about
[1:11:13] bringing these handkerchiefs I got so
[1:11:15] nervous before coming to church here I
[1:11:17] thought I was going to get sick forgot
[1:11:19] my
[1:11:21] handkerchief it must mean something
[1:11:25] it means something to
[1:11:28] me he said oh thank you if I get
[1:11:31] something white on my face my wiing with
[1:11:33] this paper towel y'all be sure to tell
[1:11:37] me cuz I've heard about preachers that
[1:11:39] were preaching with napkins one time and
[1:11:40] had stuff all all over their head and
[1:11:42] the rest of people couldn't get nothing
[1:11:43] out church so we don't have nothing like
[1:11:45] that going on
[1:11:47] here he said but something begins to
[1:11:49] pulsate in your bosom he said that the
[1:11:51] truth then make
[1:11:52] ready then make ready he said you're
[1:11:55] coming out of there he said just as sure
[1:11:58] as I'm standing in the Pulpit tonight so
[1:12:01] if you can make ready for it you can
[1:12:04] prepare for it and if you can prepare
[1:12:06] for it well I know this one out there in
[1:12:09] the world brother Andrew that they they
[1:12:10] once lived and they once came here and
[1:12:13] they they once heard the message and I
[1:12:15] know the world can sit out there and
[1:12:16] they can point at this one that came and
[1:12:18] this one that came and this one that's
[1:12:19] gone they can point at this one that got
[1:12:21] prayed for and they left sick they can
[1:12:24] point at this one that danced in the
[1:12:25] spirit and now they're out there
[1:12:26] drinking alcohol they can point at this
[1:12:28] one that they came here and got under
[1:12:30] the influence spoken tongues interpreted
[1:12:32] things then went right back out of the
[1:12:34] world but how about the ones that are
[1:12:36] still
[1:12:37] here how about the ones that are still
[1:12:40] sealed how about the ones that are still
[1:12:42] secure how about the ones that refuse to
[1:12:45] give up we're standing with more that's
[1:12:48] on our side than is against us so I'll
[1:12:52] be careful whose side I choose
[1:12:57] come on somebody I know that the rest of
[1:13:00] the world can point at them naysayers
[1:13:02] out there and say look what they've got
[1:13:03] and look how God's blessing them and
[1:13:06] you're living a message and you're not
[1:13:07] getting
[1:13:09] blessed but let me say this like Jesus

[1:16:30] it means to be invited to a banquet but
[1:16:33] you remember those that were invited to
[1:16:35] a banquet and they wouldn't show up they
[1:16:38] were invited it was it was like the
[1:16:40] gospel call or proclamation of the
[1:16:41] Gospel to them to Eternal salvation but
[1:16:44] they turn it down but you go to study
[1:16:46] out the word many are called but few are
[1:16:49] chosen it means elect it means chosen it
[1:16:54] means picked out
[1:16:55] it means chosen by God it means to
[1:16:58] obtain salvation through Christ it means
[1:17:01] that the Messiah called you and elected
[1:17:04] you and appointed by God to the most
[1:17:07] exalted office
[1:17:11] conceivable now I didn't say this I know
[1:17:14] there's a whole lot of people that sit
[1:17:15] around the ranks of the message and
[1:17:16] think that we call oursel and make
[1:17:18] oursel higher than anybody
[1:17:22] else and y'all got that idea here
[1:17:25] here if you do we need to have a
[1:17:29] talk it's one thing for you to think it
[1:17:32] but it's another thing for him to say
[1:17:35] it you can say it and it have no value
[1:17:39] to it but if he says it it means
[1:17:42] something it means
[1:17:44] something it means something because the
[1:17:47] Bible said that you're the best of its
[1:17:51] kind or class
[1:17:55] I'm going to drop a name right
[1:17:57] here sister Nancy Fraser one time there
[1:18:01] was some people that was some people
[1:18:03] around there around I a say where but
[1:18:05] they was
[1:18:07] around they was around said y'all act
[1:18:09] like y'all better than
[1:18:11] us I love you
[1:18:13] Grandma she said I am better than
[1:18:18] that I am better than that I don't have
[1:18:22] to live like a dog I'm better than that
[1:18:25] I don't have to act like a prostitute
[1:18:27] I'm better than that I don't have to
[1:18:29] live in a water down gospel I'm better
[1:18:31] than
[1:18:33] that I got
[1:18:35] Authority by the word of God to say I'm
[1:18:38] a higher class of people and I don't act
[1:18:41] like it I don't go around touting and
[1:18:43] stooting myself making me think that I'm
[1:18:45] somebody but God said that before the
[1:18:48] foundation of the world I was elect I
[1:18:51] was chosen
[1:18:56] and no man has the power to set a
[1:18:58] boundary at it that means there's no
[1:19:02] Bishop there's no priest that has the
[1:19:04] authority to say you're called or not
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:16] called I'm going to need some scripture
[1:19:18] brother Andrew praise God I got you some
[1:19:22] Ephesians 1 and3 blessed
[1:19:25] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:19:27] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[1:19:30] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:19:33] in Christ what does that mean Heavenly
[1:19:34] places it means the believer's position
[1:19:36] in
[1:19:37] Christ
[1:19:39] according as your mama chose
[1:19:42] you there a whole lot of people got that
[1:19:44] Mama chosen thing got that Dad my daddy
[1:19:46] made me come to the message no no no no
[1:19:48] no no according as he hath chosen Us in
[1:19:54] him before the foundation of the world
[1:19:56] so it matters where you're chose at
[1:19:59] you're chose in him before the
[1:20:02] foundation of the world Rahab before you
[1:20:05] ever got in Jericho and before your
[1:20:07] family ever got in there you were chose
[1:20:10] in him before the foundation of the
[1:20:14] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:20:16] Blame before him and love having
[1:20:18] predestinated us under the adoption of
[1:20:20] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:20:22] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:20:24] will so it matters who calls you it
[1:20:28] matters who elects you and the Bible
[1:20:30] said that he has made us Kings and
[1:20:32] Priests brother bam said that in the in
[1:20:34] the church age book he said you can
[1:20:35] never overemphasize that that he hath
[1:20:37] made us Kings and
[1:20:39] Priests so that God had something
[1:20:42] predestinated in the back part of God's
[1:20:44] mind that's what God that's what brother
[1:20:45] brand said in Christ the Myster of God
[1:20:47] revealed that God had something in the
[1:20:49] back part of God's
[1:20:50] mind that he had he had something there
[1:20:53] that he was going to achieve aeve that
[1:20:55] he was going to express so you
[1:20:58] are the express images of
[1:21:03] Christ so who are you
[1:21:07] really I begin to think about this who
[1:21:10] was I before I was
[1:21:12] Andrew who was I before I was Ronald and
[1:21:15] gy Spencer's son who was I who was
[1:21:20] I I was part of the original seat
[1:21:25] you begin to think of things in that
[1:21:27] realm temporal things don't seem seem to
[1:21:30] matter as much when you begin to put
[1:21:33] things in that realm who are you how did
[1:21:36] you get where you are you're original
[1:21:39] that he has made us accepted in the
[1:21:40] belove you're chosen you're a chosen
[1:21:44] generation you're a royal priesthood
[1:21:47] You're A peculiar people you're an
[1:21:52] elected so who is this who is this
[1:21:54] message for who is this who is this
[1:21:56] Rapture
[1:21:58] for it's for the
[1:22:01] elect I don't know how any other way to
[1:22:04] put it when people ask me who's a
[1:22:05] Rapture for the ticket to the Rapture is
[1:22:09] your
[1:22:10] election it's for the elected lady
[1:22:13] there's many there's many out there but
[1:22:16] there's only one mes Jesus
[1:22:19] Christ there's a lot of ladies there's a
[1:22:21] lot of women that are sitting here today

[1:24:05] while go ahead it ain't going to hurt
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:16] you click click click click click there

[1:24:34] I can tell her I love her when I want to
[1:24:37] I can take her on a date when I want to

[1:24:42] me do that to some other woman and I'm
[1:24:44] dead meat Parry me and say good words
[1:24:47] about
[1:24:48] me but there's only one M Jesus
[1:24:52] Christ he can make love to her anytime
[1:24:55] he wants to he can fellowship with her
[1:24:58] anytime he wants to he can call her up
[1:25:01] and she'll talk to him she's got
[1:25:03] Authority in his name she's got power in
[1:25:05] his
[1:25:07] name and the great thing about M Jesus
[1:25:10] Christ she's not ashamed to make love
[1:25:13] back to
[1:25:15] him but there's too many people that try
[1:25:18] to sit around and think they got the
[1:25:20] wedding band of unmerited Grace upon
[1:25:22] their fingers and they're ashamed of to
[1:25:24] make love with
[1:25:27] Jesus they're ashamed to praise him
[1:25:30] they're ashamed to act in his name
[1:25:32] they're ashamed to prophesy they're
[1:25:34] ashamed to call on God in public view or
[1:25:38] in private
[1:25:41] view but if you're ashamed of
[1:25:44] me I will be ashamed of you before
[1:25:47] angels and before all of
[1:25:52] men there's a lot of people that look
[1:25:55] the
[1:25:57] part but only one of them is going to be
[1:26:02] virgin there's a lot of
[1:26:05] them there's a lot of them that's really
[1:26:08] close to the
[1:26:09] borderline but they never go over
[1:26:14] Jordan let me find this
[1:26:16] quote matter of fact it's right there
[1:26:18] that's perfect he said you follow that
[1:26:20] true word and you get a true experience
[1:26:23] of the word
[1:26:25] because the word is made flesh in you
[1:26:28] and you become God's son and the word of
[1:26:30] God is revolving right out of God into
[1:26:34] you what is it it's a true
[1:26:37] experience she has every bit of
[1:26:39] checkboard book authority to take my
[1:26:41] name and act in my
[1:26:44] name she's got that Authority now RAB I
[1:26:48] don't under I don't know if you
[1:26:50] understand where you are in this grand
[1:26:52] scheme of things but you've got
[1:26:54] Authority because of what you
[1:26:58] believed your experience matches the
[1:27:01] word for the
[1:27:03] hour it might look like you're living in
[1:27:06] the worst condition you might have some
[1:27:08] of the worst problems stacked up against
[1:27:10] you but let me tell you Rahab where
[1:27:13] you're living at it makes a great escape
[1:27:16] plan for
[1:27:22] Joshua RAB knew what to do with this
[1:27:27] word when the king of Jericho I don't
[1:27:30] know how long I've been I'm sorry if I'm
[1:27:31] done gone over time but when the king of
[1:27:34] Jericho heard about these two spies when
[1:27:37] he heard about the
[1:27:39] word it proved that he'd been to that
[1:27:41] house
[1:27:42] before he knew exactly where to go where
[1:27:46] where are these guys at he knew exactly
[1:27:48] where to go and you watch the Power of
[1:27:51] predestination she's been here before
[1:27:53] she's been in this condition before
[1:27:56] she's probably lied before but here's a
[1:27:58] king in her
[1:28:00] house that's got
[1:28:03] Authority said where's these two spies
[1:28:07] at and she lies to them she Li
[1:28:12] them they were here but they ain't here
[1:28:16] now she probably lied before brother Ron
[1:28:20] but this time was different because up
[1:28:23] above her hiding in the flax was the
[1:28:26] word over top of her
[1:28:29] mistakes you had been in this condition
[1:28:31] and you made mistakes before but this
[1:28:33] time the word is covering your
[1:28:39] situation I don't know any other way to
[1:28:41] put it but she was
[1:28:42] lying she was lying but God saw
[1:28:45] something on the inside of her that the
[1:28:48] Book of James would say that she was
[1:28:50] justified by her
[1:28:53] works and when she said these words to
[1:28:56] them in verse 12 she said because I
[1:28:59] showed you kindness show kindness to my
[1:29:03] house and give me a true token don't
[1:29:07] give me some of this make beliefs up
[1:29:09] don't give me some of this hoopy BL
[1:29:11] stuff don't be give me some of this
[1:29:13] stuff I can f in My Flesh and then I go
[1:29:14] out and sin and just do anything I want
[1:29:16] to anymore I want a true token I want a
[1:29:19] true baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[1:29:22] don't I don't want just something that I
[1:29:24] feel on Sunday and Saturday I want
[1:29:28] something that's
[1:29:30] real she didn't just say it for herself
[1:29:35] she wanted it for her daddy she wanted
[1:29:37] it for her mama she wanted it for her
[1:29:42] brother Rahab acted on the word of
[1:29:47] God and
[1:29:49] then and
[1:29:51] then and then she saw a
[1:29:57] miracle before you ever going to see it
[1:30:01] you got to act on
[1:30:05] it brother Mar said he slipped into her
[1:30:09] house said I could see her down there
[1:30:12] and she's Gathering all those
[1:30:14] predestinated seeds in she's Gathering
[1:30:16] them
[1:30:19] in granted now she's never seen one
[1:30:22] miracle
[1:30:24] she's just heard about how God destroyed
[1:30:27] Gog and MGA she's just heard about how
[1:30:29] that he opened up the Red Sea she's
[1:30:30] heard about these Miracles she's heard
[1:30:32] about the healing of hady Wright She's
[1:30:33] heard about she's heard about these
[1:30:35] things she's heard about Georgie Carter
[1:30:36] she's heard about Congressman Upshaw but
[1:30:38] she ain't seen one thing about it yet
[1:30:41] she ain't seen one thing but she's
[1:30:42] Gathering all these predestinated seeds
[1:30:44] in there what is she doing she's taking
[1:30:46] that word that she's heard and she's
[1:30:47] going around and she's testifying about
[1:30:49] it and she's getting every single one of
[1:30:51] them in there she's doing what anybody
[1:30:53] that's got a message will do you'll
[1:30:55] start Gathering them to
[1:30:57] you that's what the message would do
[1:30:59] it'll gather the true seed into the
[1:31:03] house and they begin to brother they
[1:31:05] begin to ask a question how do we know
[1:31:07] we're going to be okay brother ROM said
[1:31:09] she said I'm acquainted I'm acquainted
[1:31:13] with this destroying Angel she ain't
[1:31:15] never met Joshua but she'd met the
[1:31:18] message of Joshua she'd heard about it
[1:31:21] and she said I am acquainted I Am AC
[1:31:23] acquainted with this destroying Angel
[1:31:27] Joshua because that's what the Bible
[1:31:30] said in Romans 10:1 17 that Faith cometh
[1:31:32] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:31:36] God
[1:31:39] Rahab was backing
[1:31:43] prophecy and I'm I Lord willing I'll get
[1:31:46] to it next
[1:31:50] weekend it is also said because people
[1:31:53] were in embarrassed about her but it
[1:31:55] said that she also
[1:31:57] died
[1:31:59] Linens she died Linens there in her
[1:32:04] house she didn't know it but she had
[1:32:07] that message sit in her all that
[1:32:09] time she didn't know it but she had the
[1:32:12] cloud there the whole time she didn't
[1:32:14] know it but she had the token there the
[1:32:15] whole time she had been sitting around
[1:32:19] the message her whole life the thing
[1:32:22] that was going to get her out of her
[1:32:24] situation she'd been living right there
[1:32:27] with it in her house how many people
[1:32:29] sitting there with a message in their
[1:32:32] house right
[1:32:33] now and don't even realize it but one
[1:32:37] day there's going to be the word that
[1:32:38] come by your way it's going to pass by
[1:32:40] your way you're going to hear it you're
[1:32:43] going to accept it and you're going to
[1:32:45] move
[1:32:46] forward and she didn't care she didn't
[1:32:50] care she didn't care what the rest of
[1:32:52] the world said about it
[1:32:55] I know there's a lot of people that's
[1:32:57] probably don't understand why you're
[1:32:59] driving two and a half hours to get here
[1:33:01] brother but it means something to
[1:33:07] you they may not be a whole lot of
[1:33:09] people that don't understand why in the
[1:33:10] world
[1:33:12] you brother Denny's got a lot of
[1:33:14] question why in the world you got to
[1:33:15] drive an hour and a half to go to that
[1:33:17] church all the way up there weekend
[1:33:19] after weekend it means something to him
[1:33:22] you look at these brothers sister drove
[1:33:24] here for all these years across the
[1:33:25] mountain and four four hours getting
[1:33:28] here it means something to them and
[1:33:32] Rahab did not care what the rest of the
[1:33:35] world they were making fun of her by
[1:33:38] dropping down the token on the outside
[1:33:41] they saw
[1:33:42] her and she didn't pull it
[1:33:45] up she didn't pull up the token when
[1:33:48] people started making fun of her it's
[1:33:51] just like down there in Exodus chap 12
[1:33:54] when they was down there and they was
[1:33:55] applying the token to the door and there
[1:33:58] that blood was on the door brother R
[1:34:01] said it got the stinking so bad that
[1:34:04] them people said well look at them Holy
[1:34:05] Rollers up there said them Pentecostals
[1:34:07] out there doing things like that theyy
[1:34:09] applying the token to the door he said
[1:34:12] it didn't mean one thing to them he said
[1:34:14] but it meant something to them
[1:34:16] Israelites and it may not mean nothing
[1:34:18] else to anybody else but that same
[1:34:21] Pillar of Fire that was with with
[1:34:23] William pram is in the room and it means
[1:34:26] something to
[1:34:28] me it may not have meant anything back
[1:34:31] to anybody else to reach out there and
[1:34:33] touch Jesus but to the woman with a
[1:34:35] blood issue it meant something to
[1:34:38] her it meant something to her and Jesus
[1:34:41] didn't even feel it but he felt virtue
[1:34:44] go through
[1:34:48] him it may not have meant anything to
[1:34:51] Simon for Jesus to come in his house but
[1:34:53] it meant something for
[1:34:55] jaras it meant something to him it
[1:34:58] didn't mean nothing to anybody
[1:35:00] else when Jesus was sitting down and he
[1:35:03] wasd
[1:35:08] drawn Jesus is drawing in the
[1:35:11] sand when this woman was deserving of it
[1:35:14] and by the law it didn't mean nothing to
[1:35:17] them pharaohs it didn't even mean
[1:35:18] nothing to Pharisees and Sadducees but
[1:35:21] it meant something to this woman that
[1:35:22] was caught in the act
[1:35:27] this message may not mean anything else
[1:35:29] to you but it means something to Rahab
[1:35:31] and Rahab I want to tell
[1:35:34] you you're going to watch the word go
[1:35:37] back across a Jordan
[1:35:38] River but I want you to prepare because
[1:35:42] just in four chapters honey you getting
[1:35:46] out you are coming out of your situation
[1:35:49] you're not going to live down here in
[1:35:51] Jericho no more your past is going to be
[1:35:55] so fused together by the word of
[1:35:59] God that natural geographic draw it and
[1:36:03] said they saw layers on top of layers of
[1:36:05] Jericho's rock that had fused together
[1:36:09] that the heat of Jericho what am I
[1:36:12] saying to you that when the pillar of
