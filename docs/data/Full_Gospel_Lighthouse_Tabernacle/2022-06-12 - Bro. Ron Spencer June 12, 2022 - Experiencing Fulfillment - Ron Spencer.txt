people left the baby start having the same symptoms baby eyes flipped and everything we said no this is not right so we rushed the baby to the edie and they found that the baby had something on his brain and they needed to uh to go through the procedures and everything but i said no we need to pray and the prayer that we're going to go through and i call brother apostle andrew here again i say brother join us in prayers because the baby is not feeling good at all and i know because my faith is 10 000 times than anyone that i can think about i said because because i believe this message and

take me off the stage you the world's not falling apart i just need to i need a good comfortable bed so so so we're we're fighting we're fighting some things and so we'll get through it i fought some things this morning and we're standing here and uh every day seems to be a new day and you're either kicking cancer or cancer's kicking you but at the end of the day god's got it so we thank the lord for that i want to have prayer for brother joseph and his family i'd like for you guys to come and bring the baby i'd like to anoint the baby and and and we prayed for it we went immediately to prayer we know it's a miracle what not in phenomenal atmosphere when he prayed this morning i i thought of i i don't mean to put this wrong but i thought of brother branham when he was was in was in uh memphis he said won't you pray and he said when i heard her pray i knew she'd been talking to him and brother joseph i heard you when i heard you pray i said he's been talking to him amen would you just comment brother andrew brother william amen yes please amen amen hallelujah now we want to remind satan he can't have him they've been feeding you potatoes this boy eats like i do told me the

going to be okay heavenly father how dare an enemy come on god's property this baby was dedicated to you and it's not just a baby it's a believer's baby and we have a position not just in this realm but in another realm and if we're very sensitive we can feel the angel of the lord real near that watches over this baby now dear god i thank you for what doctors have done to preserve its life satan swooped in trying to take it and it means that there is a a work to do in this baby i asked you that you would touch it just now touch this family strengthen them minister to them in a mighty way father i ask you may the holy ghost come into their home like never before father satan you take your hands off of god's property in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen amen amen i'll be

are get a little bit older and and doctors tell them don't come don't mean they're still not pillars and so brother roger watches every service it's with you he pays his tithes all of that business and he's a real friend to me and and brother homer just because we're in different dimensions don't mean we're not friends and pillars and all of those kind of things and so their family has got some bad news is it okay to share their family's got some bad news and that's their daughter debbie and uh how old is debbie 60. wow my age amen i had her a lot younger than that but she's 60 years old she found out in the last just days that she has uterus cancer liver cancer and pancreas cancer you and all you and i all know just to hear those words uh sends a dread or a fear or just a little torment among you and it just uh i know it sends it sends a torment among you because without the hand of god it's a death sentence we're we're grown-ups here without the hands of gods it's a death sentence and so these organs are very much needed generally when it's said pancreas cancer whether you're the president or or some hollywood star that gets the best in the world there's just not much that they can do but we happen to have a different source we have a different source we have a different doctor and that doctor's jesus now now let me just say this to you sometimes we get ahead of god and we we we get a conclusion but what if you'd have got a head of god with lazarus and four days late but the master came to the house the master came i don't know about you but i like the master to come to my house amen amen brother roger and sister hannah you might come in and i'll i will pray with you amen amen is she in uva today is she in uva today midnight last night okay yes we believe that with

at at brother wayne's or brother rays brother wayne's brother wayne race uh uh if that would be okay and i'll just start out with the same scripture that we used there exodus chapter 12 and we'll just go we'll just go down to verse seven amen amen god bless you god bless you exodus chapter 12 and verse 7 amen and they shall take the of the blood and shall strike it on two sides of the post and on the upper door post of the house wherein they shall eat of it and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast it with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not out of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast it with fire and his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning that which remain of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it now notice these words thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it with haste it is the lord's passover for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn of the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord the blood shall shall be to you for a token upon your houses where ye are and when i see the angel blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the of the land of egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it at the feast of the lord throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by ordinance forever let's talk to the lord lord jesus we love you tonight and are so incredibly thankful for what you have done lord we have watched the events of the last few weeks within the bride not just within the bride but the world is taking shape prophecy being fulfilled daily things that are happening the bride is in revival like never before your supernatural hand satan fighting against us with everything that he can because he realizes just like this scripture is saying we are at the end of the end we're the final voice to the final age and we realize that all the prophecies have come to this point it's a going home time for us and lord will will slip out of here and lord while we're here let us shine the light to a dark and dying age lord they won't realize that they've slipped into tribulation be no messenger there to tell them that the tribulation has started it will have just slipped into that but there was a messenger that came that told us of these events that would happen now sharpen our attention catch our hearts minister to our needs even as i stand here and preach today anoint our lips for our hearts for rapture lord may we be ready may we be on the mark like never before father speak to our hearts now in jesus christ's name we pray a man and a man and a man you may be seated last week we went to brother ray erickson's to speak and on thursday morning just before going there i had prayed i had dedicated time to prepare for that meeting and i felt it was going in a certain direction and then on thursday morning the lord woke me up it was at 406 i looked over at the clock and and i heard the voice of the lord and he spoke to me these words experiencing fulfillment experiencing fulfillment and then the third time he spoke to me again experiencing fulfillment any minister that's got any salt to him immediately knows that that's not his thoughts that's god's thoughts and god wants to say something and so i quickly at that time in the morning begin to begin to make notes and thoughts and while that presence was in the room and then just a bit later i would i would i would lay back down and and i would fall asleep and the lord would give me a dream and that dream would give me direction for for the next coming months and later i will share that with my family that's more of a family thing to share not a world thing to share but i would get a visitation in that dream i i just as as i began to look at these things and then look what happened we went to to brother wayne's and house and brother wayne was hosting us on on the evening of saturday afternoon we would only speak sunday morning and brother brother ray was sitting beside of me his basically his family was sitting there in the room and it was actually two rooms and and there was the sisters were there the brothers were there don't i don't have an idea maybe 40 people was in the room and and some children that was there and brother ray just asked me a question about the supernatural and we just begin to talk about the supernatural for just a bit and as we begin to talk it just dropped it just dropped it felt like the hair on my head caught on fire it felt like the presence of god was consumed and it felt like you didn't want to say a word out of place we're not here to recreate that because that same presence is already here and brother ray began to speak in tongues one by one individuals got a word from the lord for them it was not a dry eye in the room and then brother wayne had a request and and we began to pray tongues were being spoken of a heavenly language and and that that event was just life-changing now only just a couple of weeks before that we had been with with brother biskell and brother tim pruitt brother michael ray and then there was several people that were there matthew was there uh there was quite a few that was in the room and it was kind of the same setting and we just begin to to talk about supernatural things and things that had happened with us things that would happen with brother tim with a little drew that that conversation would be then sister karen how god has been with us through cancer brother biscuit would be making comments and and after just about 20 minutes eat about 20 minutes of that presence being there he he just said many years ago i was in a presence like this and we were sitting at the table with brother branham and he said i'll tell you that pillar of fire brother branham said that pillar of fire is hanging about two feet from us brother biscuit said that same presence is here then that same presence was at the table with at brother wayne's house i want that presence at my house and i say that because it comes he's welcome anytime [Music] not just at the house but in this church i want it for your homes when these people were asked to get their get their lamb ready it had to be perfect it had to be a certain way blood had to be on the door because the angel was passing by the death angel was passing and listen life after today it wasn't going to never be the same for those egyptian people their oldest child was going to perish that night because they had rejected the message whatever nation you're listening to whether you're sitting in switzerland or in ireland wherever you're at listening to this message today i want you to understand because this world has turned down the message we're preparing to leave this message it's rapture message this message turned abraham and sarah back young again that's a type that there were a people that were going to receive this melchizedek of this age this mighty angel of this day that would stand at the pulpit night after night after not let me just say you said well brother ron i'm looking for vindication today you are the vindication god will not send another messenger he's already came but as he began to speak those words to me experiencing fulfillment experiencing fulfillment i begin to realize that we're no longer just looking for things to happen i want you to be real conscious with me we're no longer just looking for things to happen or one day or i just hope i'm here or i i it's happening and it's like an enoch walk it's like a rebecca ride with elijah the word is carrying you the dress fits it's not you having to make yourself do anything we're not a religious order [Music] we're not just another church we are the bride of jesus christ and we've been married to him by a message of the hour that has put us in position now i want you to stay with me we realize that dimensions are blending we realize that the world has fallen apart but this is the result what you're seeing today on our streets is the results of seeds that have been sowed for a hundred years and now the harvest is in our cities it's in our schools it's in our communities you could put an abraham lincoln and a george washington in every county in america it won't turn it around brother branham said he said our children and grandchildren will never pay off the tax debt that they're spending i'd say that's true today we have spent so far until there's no way to ever unspend it blame can be placed in a lot of different directions a lot of directions it can be and we are now experiencing i'm trying to kind of bring you into it when you go to the gas station your experiencing amen and maybe you don't have an idea of why you're experiencing that is it's because men have made the decision that they're going to put windmills and they're going to put solar panels and america's going to be run by a battery well they tried that in the 1900s and about the 1910s and it didn't work it just didn't work but you see the seed of that never died and as people we face the penalty of billionaires making choices don't freeze up on me many people sit in churches and their churches are dead and maybe they're even mega churches and their churches have lost grip lost their moral compass they have they don't have any strength for revival you'll never turn around how women dress in those places you'll never turn out you'll never turn around the ministry where the god moves from the front to the back so you have to manufacture programs and you have to manufacture worship by worship teens you have to have a you have to have the old traditional music for for certain classes and you have to have contemporary music for a certain class [Music] you can't buy a lawnmower without a voting system take place preacher preaches too long they'll get rid of him after a while if he doesn't have a certain style if he doesn't have a certain manner about him they'll move him on after a while but the reason they've done that they moved god on [Applause] [Music] ichabod is written over the door and it says the presence of god has departed brother branham walked to the pulpit and he preached blasphemous names this is not going to be one of his most popular messages and he will name denominational systems that went off without god they crucified the word again afresh and said god don't do miracles no more and he began to go down through how that they're not looking for even an elijah in this day amen what they did was they didn't understand it but they were experiencing fulfillment they were sitting in a pew watching their church died they were watching their church die they were watching their church change brother random was here when there was just less than one percent to said take prayer out of school elijah was here elijah was here so was some other kings here martin luther king was here elvis presley was here john f kennedy was here there were a lot of things that were going on when brother branham was here and at the same time of all of that the seals were being released you see the world's going to do what it's going to do they're going to make their decisions the outside noise is going to do theirs but god's got a plan [Applause] and they tried to take prayer out of schools but listen it didn't stop there it didn't stop there they took prayer out of the government and then they took the prayer out of churches and too many people has taken prayer out of homes i pray that's never your situation in your life backsliding is not drinking smoking cheating and lying and stealing backsliding is quit feeding the fire that's in your life it's getting satisfied getting numb by the world and its system brother branham would make a state but he said he'd call it don't be numb numbness he'd also say paralyzing your faith call it dull of hearing maybe we could say distracted by the world i remember brother dan daisley coming to this pulpit we came and set for just another service and brother dan walked through the back of the of the building he walked in no town he just walked in his jovial self i said where'd you've been i said what are you doing here he said i just come through he said well when did you get here he said well i've been here all week he said i just came to relax stayed in a hotel he said i thought i'd come have service without such good you're preaching he said okay he walked out here you know the story you've been here for a while you walked out here and he began to preach to us and he made an announcement to us my wife is having an affair this audience has sent a shockwave you could just feel it from the front to the back and as he began to preach we realized real quickly it wasn't his wife but it was it was like eve having an affair on adam it was like pentecost becoming catholic and if we're not careful we'll start looking at another lover [Applause] are you with me you can't love god and love the world at the same time it just don't work out sitting on a fence just don't work out like that sermon aaron spoke i think he spoke it in ohio on empty fences you got to make a decision somewhere another we didn't realize that this would be brother dan's last sermon to preach he would walk out of here it would be his last sermon here but he was saying something to this audience don't be found with another lover brother homer his last sermon was being there for ready in sichuan hours you think not sometimes we come to church we sit there and we think well this is the way it's always going to be i made the statement as i was standing in front of probably 400 people at brother ray erickson's knowing the condition of where where we're at in life have no promise of being able to be there next year after 29 years of preaching there no promise that i'll have enough strength to be there next year to do that but listen while we're here in this moment that we're here let's take advantage and as i begin to make some statements this may be your last service they didn't know that charlie and rachel charlie was sitting right there charlie and rachel was getting ready to go to heaven that theophany body that we sing about was getting ready to pick them up god's not dainty whether we go by a car wreck or whether we go by cancer or whether we go by a fire he's not gaining saying that sometimes we glorify death we sing about death we glorify it we worship it and let me let me just just tell you here cancer is not going to kill me fourth stage cancer it's not going to kill me the day that god decides to bring me home cancer will have absolutely nothing to do with it so i don't fear cancer or the sugar i don't fear that to worship cancer is like worshiping a taxicab worshiping cancer is like worshiping a taxicab none of us in our rightful mind want to worship a taxicab so don't worship the cancer don't worship the heart attack because god's greater than all of that and death only changes your dwelling place [Applause] and death can't come a second too early until god says all right now go move him go moving from that house to this house go move him from that wretched pest house to this house where he'll never suffer again he'll never agonize again he'll never have another problem again he'll never age another day satan can't never touch him again worshiping death is kind of like getting in an uber a car and trying to figure out the life story to the driver all of my concern is is you get me from point a to point b i don't need to know how many kids you have i don't need on church let's preach death fell from heaven it fell from heaven when god said let there be light there was darkness darkness is only the antitype to tell us how great our god is amen so we realize that there are certain events that we experience that has been pre-ordained and you start experiencing them and you know sometimes we're sitting in a service and don't realize that god is being the very discerner of our thoughts and the intents of our heart and he's come to our kitchen he's come to our bedroom he's come to where we pray and he's answering our prayer and we're thinking about how long the preacher has preached or who's here or who's not here i learned a long time ago i preached to the people that are here and who's not here i'm not i'm you know they're just going to do their own deal but we're going to have church so let's just suppose let's do it this way brother branham has preached uh let's go patriarch abraham and so he's just preached and and he's just talked about abraham and the promise to abraham and el shaddai and all of these these parts of the sermon and he said now let's turn from evangelistic work says this by direct quote let's turn from a evangelistic work to a prophetic work now i want to caution you right here for those that have never heard some of these things i want to say this to you there wasn't another charismatic preacher in the world and there's never been one since jesus christ that had a messiah gift or messiah sign like god showed this generation but it was to get your attention that you would hear the thunders and hear the seals and hear the prophetic word it was more than just to call a patient up and tell them their condition well let's just say you're the patient and you've handed in your cart tuberculosis or whatever your disease was and you're standing there brother danny you're standing there and you're standing just feet and brother brown says now now don't be afraid of that that presence between you and i is him and he would tell us many times when that presence comes around that's him you just ask for more of him don't be afraid of that that's him that's him in your home that's when you're praying you feel him come that's him don't you be afraid of that it's a good time to repent too the zeal of this age is to repent i'm sorry for the things that i've made mistakes and then and then he began to talk to him and maybe he would turn and they're standing their feet from them maybe they've been suffering this with this for decades and they're standing there in front of him and they've been to tons of doctors spent incredible amounts of money nobody's given hope now they're standing and they're standing there and now that prophet turns and maybe calls out somebody over here somebody over there and somebody over there and it comes back to no you're the patient yes yes yes i am and begins to talk about the woman at the well maybe talks about blind bartimaeus what he's doing is he's raising the faith of that audience and taking them back to the same messiah son that was there with abraham and sarah are you with me because god is amen in the hour and a half sermon that he's just preached now if god don't do this may he strike me dead you heard him say that over and over again for the critics you need to re-listen to that so so are you the patient yes i see you your name is so-and-so yes you're you're you're not from here you're from this place that's right that's right you've been to a doctor that's right and then go right down the line one person 22 different things if he's wrong one time it blows it all away well i don't know so much about that it did to that patient you know you could have critics all over the building it's not for you no way this is not for the unbeliever you know you may have friends that say well i they don't want to come to church it don't matter well they don't see what i see it don't matter it's for you [Applause] here's a girl she's blonde head is sitting right here all right raise your hand right there she'd never been around any kind of thing like this and she meets a boy and she starts coming she's she's riding four hours for these services she could stay at home and just blow this off and say i'll see you when you get back home i'll see you monday but there's something on the inside of you that's causing you to really like this in that ride that's right there he goes your answer and he's going to make everything work for you good he's going to do that for you that's nice isn't it now that patient she's standing there and she may not feel nothing and brother brown will go now you go believing maybe walk off of that stage with incredible disease and in a few days she begins to notice i'm not sick anymore i'm not sick anymore i i i'm not sick anymore i feel good and it begins to confess that by his stripes i'm healed and there's not a devil in hell that can stop that and she just begins to confess now all of us has got a human grab bag of weaknesses in our humanity as we begin to get older and things begin to happen in our lives and we begin to deteriorate but god's still a healer sister whitney we said this the other day sister whitney had which spent thousands and thousands of dollars and had all kind of doctors to to see her because of this eating disorder and and she couldn't eat certain things and couldn't eat certain things and and she would try to eat she would try and she would try and she would get sick and and we wanted our best for the baby but the other night as she was coming into that prayer line at the tent as they were pulling me out god stopped us and in a moment [Applause] in a moment god healed her are you with me let me just say sometimes we're sitting and standing and brother brahma would say these words in two worlds at the same time if we could only be conscious of what is going on around us we don't have a day off with god [Music] i heard last night doomed devils are on the run are you with me they've come to their end they realized they throwed everything at the bride of jesus christ and there's nothing there's nothing that has deterred her faith [Applause] brother brown would tell us two years before of a certain animal that he's going to kill caribou 42-inch horns actually he wouldn't know it would be a caribou he just knew it was a certain animal had a certain color but the horns were a certain way and be exactly 42 inches now that's incredible but that's only half he and the guide would be walking down off of the mountain and they would kill a silver tipped grizzly bear one shot with too small a gun now i've heard brother briscoe tell it i heard brother branham tell it even the god had never seen that kind of an animal and he had definitely never seen a silver tipped grizzly bear the area was new to him but he had never seen that kind of a grizzly bear there and so they're there and they're glass in the area and there have been days now and there there they are there is that caribou and brother branham said that we must go this way we must go this way to get to him and the god told him said we can't go that way we'll cause a rock slide and he said well that's what the angel said for us to do he said let's go are you with me the caribou's shot brother branham is standing there reeling in the vision he's experiencing the fulfillment of it taking place are you catching what i'm doing now he's experiencing it don't take long it's just minutes two years now it's just minutes happening brother biscuit standing there in a green checkered shirt he had told his wife to throw it away but she ironed it put it back in he fell in the mud had to put it back on because it had to fulfill the vision he stood here in this pulpit and told us that listen we as ministers we don't have any agenda to lie to you we don't have any agenda to embellish the story let me just say god don't need to be propped up [Applause] his word is true he's he's incredibly accurate [Applause] now i as a minister realize you've heard these stories a hundred times but you don't realize what i'm going to do with that now they're walking back down off of the mountain pictures no doubt taken measured exactly 42 inches brother biscuit actually says i hinged my entire faith and that thing being exactly 42 inches if it had been a quarter one way or the other there'd have been room for error but it was exactly 42 inches brother branham his guide are walking back bud is walking down off of the hill now they're walking but the second part now is coming and bud begins to explain to him brother branham i can see for miles and i can't see a grizzly bear a bear anywhere brother branham asked him about even his brother you know they begin to talk and he says but or you doubting the vision now here's where i want to go with this i i'm explaining to you part two of this incredible vision listen there's not a guide anywhere in the world that you describe to him i want to kill i want to kill a a white-tailed deer and it to be 208 score may it be so and may jason mount that deer and then and then when we get done with that we're going to kill an elk on a way back down off of the rich there's not a god in the world wants to sign up for that amen that's a dream that's more than even hollywood can conjure but that's not that's not even thinking about we got a god i i want to just stop here for a moment we've had the message delivered to us part 1 said behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great and the dreadful day of the lord the message came he delivered you don't have to add nothing to it we don't need another great man to come on the scene we don't need another popularity we don't need a kingdom builder the message is delivered now the devil whispers in your ear especially when there's time [Applause] as it stretches out over decades and it stretches out but god made a promise he's never failed on a promise check him out he's never failed [Applause] well brother ron i i need vindication well what are you going to vindicate it by some silly college education idiot oh but i got a better idea our nation can't figure out who to have as a president we've come to the end i'm sorry my insurance agent told me today i need to be careful in the pulpit well i'm gonna do my best it's a no-brainer we need somebody to garner school it's a no-brainer it's a no-brainer we don't need to kill our unborn babies it's a no-brainer and i just want to say this you god sent you a prophet he sent you a prophet he's your prophet whether you believe him or you don't believe it he was a prophet that gets you in the rapture or send you into the tribulation period but he's still a prophet well brother ron he since he said some things that i didn't i didn't agree with okay okay let's go to our prayer line let's let's let's go to uh private prayer there's a woman that's been brother branham's friend for decades and she's got a nervous condition and brother brandon says one day one day when the angels here just have her to come in and we'll pray with her she walks in they bring her in and set her down brother random says i i see you when your husband was away at war and you were in a certain certain car and you just about get hit by a train and you was with another man i see that she could have got mad she could have stomped out but now she realizes decades didn't cover up her sin and she's sitting there i can't confess that to my husband now her husband wasn't in the room i can't confess that to my husband it would destroy our marriage and brother and says bring your husband here he's got the same problem now listen that wasn't just in prayer but that was in preaching when brother branham is preaching is your life worthy of the gospel and it goes through the characteristics of a christian life there will be spots in there that you go that's dumb that stunk brother roger you had a statement that homer was getting on your toes and you would pull your shoes up under he said still stomp my feet you could have got mad and you and brother homer were best of friends but the zeal of this age is to repent somehow we want the holy ghost i sat with gabriel this morning at breakfast and we have breakfast every sunday morning it's kind of a thing that we do thank you sarah it's a thing that we do we have breakfast every sunday morning together and i was sitting there and explaining to him like a jelly jar now that jelly jar can't be sealed until all the impurities are out of it so you can wash the jar you get all the impurities out you you cook the jelly you get it exactly ready everything is just right then you put a cap on it if the impurities are out of it and you cook it just right it will seal and you can set it on a jar forever or a long time understand that but if there's rottenness on the inside of it if there's rottenness on the inside of it when the repentance is preached that thing will blow up you can desire to have the holy ghost for a hundred years but if you're not right somebody ought to be helping me right now [Applause] it's daily in your prayer life well i i don't have any brother branham said pray to repent of your unbelief that's one of the biggest things we're expecting rapture where he changes her body more than just cleanses us of cancer he's going to turn me back to a red-headed boy again where i can run like a deer i tell some of you kids that's interested in athletics when i was a boy i was the fastest boy in our class i weighed 118 pounds i could fly i was strong because we put up hay all of our life since a little boy put up thousands of bales of hay every year worked hard lift weights well i could lift about 350 pounds for a bench press then i set a record six [Applause] it's for you brother denny i never told my boys those things homer told me he said don't tell your boys those things he told them a lot of things but he told me don't tell them none of that we were buying a bull one day we're looking across at a black angus bull weighing about 700 pounds the guy that was we were buying it from knew me in another life and he started telling these two guys back here not you william but matt and andrew he started telling them about a a guy that came into the grocery store where we worked and said he'd been beat up by a gang said he was he was beat up and said couldn't come to work for a week he'd been beat up by a gang he said i found out it was your daddy that did that you know that guy was you there i told him i said craig don't tell these boys that kind of stuff they've never heard it you see i'm not proud of those things and i didn't tell you that i would be proud of that and i'm not proud of that but i am proud that since god changed my life i have grinned while i've defeated a lot of devils in the name of the lord jesus christ now i'm saying that i'm not going to get done but i'm saying this i experienced what this message is i grew up and i i had an upper hand on many of you i grew up listening to tapes that was in our home you can't substitute that hearing the prophet's voice listening to the word i grew up in that kind of an atmosphere and i'm tying some things together one of the worst fights i was ever in was when a guy told me that brother branham wasn't a prophet in a bar room that was a really bad thing to do amen it was a bad thing to tell me that brother branham wasn't a prophet because i was convinced you know it's even still a bad thing to do to this 60 year old guy to tell me that brother brandon wasn't a prophet i'm not going to whip you physically but i'm going to tell you where your choices will take you and it ain't going to be good you'll start falling like you've never felt before in your life sin will take you somewhere and before long this won't work for you you're gonna have to have another one and there's no church will fit you before long husbands and wives are gone and children are gone don't even know their own genders anymore but when i got a change i realized that i had to so repent and keep repenting and keep repenting and keep repenting because i needed to keep my spirit clean now i want to give you just a little bit right now in your enoch walk in laodicea satan can't get to your soul because that's sealed for eternity but he can get to your flesh how many ever feel that temper rise up just a little bit they ain't done that in 10 years and all of a sudden boom somebody cut you off at a red light boom yep i'm preaching to the right group then if you can't work on your flesh you'll go right to your spirit in their lay's conscience and memory affections your feelings lay on the inside of all of that and begin to work backwards and forwards with your flesh and if you're not careful he'll bring up tin can alley and you'll be texting some old girlfriend oh come on somebody help me preach you got no business doing that texting some old guy out there that you used to drink and smoke and cheating lie with let me just say this to you let them grow we're not heading in the same direction brother ron but i keep hearing these words but the rapture keeps getting further and further and further away are you doubting the vision are you doubting the vision when you're actually walking in it did you catch those last words when you're actually walking in it that little girl the armor and company girl how do you remember that story she fixed breakfast last time made beds last time took her apron off last time one of these mornings notice when god told them to with the token put your shoes on be ready you ain't gonna have time to clean your closets out to get your shoes just right you got to be ready in such an hour as you think not brother ron i got all the time in the world last week putin told us how quick he could destroy america four bombs he could do it in less than 30 minutes he's just reiterating what brother branham said long time ago he couldn't do what he's doing except for a prophet come on church you don't need some prognosticator to tell you all of those things you definitely don't need a talking head on fox news to tell you all those things or cnn with their filter you had a profit [Applause] i don't have the answer of how it all works out we're already driving cars that are smarter than even brother branham explained we've already had a woman in an office with purple dress los angeles is shook and shook and shook sin is everywhere it's everywhere the world has fell apart rush is doing what they're doing they're preparing they're they're ranking it they're they're shaking the world they're shaking the world don't let ten dollar gas blur your vision i don't know about you but i get aggravated at five dollar gas but our canadian friends are paying ten dollars ten dollars their money god has an agenda it's kind of like putting your shoes on and i don't want to come to some sort of a close here be alright if i say this to a couple weeks but one night brother joe forney was going to the camp meeting and he was going to the service that night and and i would be speaking and he said i walked into my my closet and he said the voice spoke to him said put on a suit you're going you're going to be praying in the prayer line with brother ron well i preached that evening and it come to time to pray for those that were needing prayer and it was just an immediate prayer line that went all the way up some of you were there and i motioned back and there was probably 40 preachers sitting in that corner and i just motioned like that and jewel immediately jumped out of his seat he said god didn't tell the rest of them he told me now i'm going to use that he didn't tell the rest of them he told me to go there and to put on the suit he didn't tell the whole world this message he told me and i'm one of them wow you know i'm done you can you can stand how do you explain an experience how do you explain it what was it like to get burned by fire it was hot what was it like to fall off of a roof i didn't feel an angel it just hurt what is it like to fight cancer it's kind of like having the flu every day but in all of those cases jesus is with you we stepped out of a restaurant and i looked down at the end of the street and there stood andrew with tom ray and in just a few seconds andrew was a different guy from that experience you get a song leader like you got and a preacher like you god and he feeds it he's a good student of the message sister ruth you know that you feed from his ministry and you feed from that experience but it's not just his experience but now you want yours it's not just enough for him to have it but katie's got to get it their children's got to get it i'll never forget when i baptize you brother jordan and sister kirsten in their old order clothes to me it was one of the greatest experiences of my life because it was showing one thing as dying and a new life is coming and i i looked at him last night and he was on his feet and he was dressed to the nines he wasn't in old order last night daddy's at home what happened he experienced something more than church more than a pew more than tapes and books but this message i heard it it works hallelujah you'll be drinking coffee maybe hot tea and you'll feel a little wave come by you maybe you'll look out the door coming up your walkway you'll see your mama coming stepping up on the steps don't be scared just let her in you hear that voice of homer you never knew him as a young man but you see his structure thomas is his best friend and you
