[1:08:30] and he's saying this very passionate
[1:08:32] sacred from his heart
[1:08:34] that which was from the beginning
[1:08:38] which we have heard
[1:08:40] which we have seen with our eyes
[1:08:43] which we have looked upon
[1:08:46] and our hands have handled
[1:08:50] the word of life for the life was
[1:08:53] manifested and we have seen it
[1:08:56] and bear witness and show unto you that
[1:08:58] eternal life
[1:09:00] which was with the father and was
[1:09:03] manifested unto us
[1:09:05] that which we have seen
[1:09:07] and heard
[1:09:09] declare we unto you
[1:09:11] that you also may have fellowship with
[1:09:14] us
[1:09:15] and truly our fellowship is with our

[1:09:35] god is light
[1:09:37] and in him
[1:09:40] is no darkness at all
[1:09:43] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:09:46] him and walk in darkness we lie
[1:09:48] and do not the truth
[1:09:50] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:09:53] the light
[1:09:54] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:09:56] the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:10:00] cleanses us
[1:10:02] from
[1:10:03] all
[1:10:04] sin
[1:10:07] amen you may be seated
[1:10:13] in luke chapter 9
[1:10:17] that will hovel up on the screen but in
[1:10:18] luke chapter 9 and verse 23
[1:10:22] this is a
[1:10:23] this is when jesus is standing literally

[1:10:30] and i hope you understand it the man
[1:10:33] and the eternal part
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:39] and he said to them
[1:10:42] if any man will come after me
[1:10:45] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:10:48] cross daily
[1:10:50] and follow me
[1:10:52] and whosoever will
[1:10:54] shall save his life shall lose it but
[1:10:57] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:10:59] the same shall save it
[1:11:01] for what is a man advantaged if he
[1:11:03] gained the whole world and lose himself
[1:11:08] or be cast away
[1:11:10] for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
[1:11:14] of my words
[1:11:15] of him shall the son of man be ashamed
[1:11:19] when he had come
[1:11:21] into his own glory
[1:11:23] and in his father's and of the holy
[1:11:26] angels now notice this next verse and i
[1:11:29] want you to just hang on to it and i'd
[1:11:31] like for you to read it
[1:11:33] several times this week would that be
[1:11:34] okay
[1:11:36] but i tell you of a truth
[1:11:39] that there be
[1:11:40] some standing here
[1:11:42] and i don't want you to think two
[1:11:44] thousand years ago
[1:11:53] which shall not taste
[1:11:55] of death
[1:11:58] till they see
[1:11:59] the kingdom
[1:12:01] of god
[1:12:04] and they did
[1:12:07] and we will
[1:12:11] will you read that scripture again with
[1:12:13] me and i want you to say before we read
[1:12:16] it this is for me
[1:12:20] but i tell you the truth
[1:12:24] there be some standing here
[1:12:26] which shall not taste of death
[1:12:29] till they see the kingdom of god
[1:12:37] philippians chapter 3
[1:12:40] and verse 13
[1:12:42] brethren i count not myself to be
[1:12:44] apprehended
[1:12:47] but this one thing that i do forgetting
[1:12:50] those things which are behind and
[1:12:52] reaching forth unto those things which
[1:12:54] are before
[1:12:55] i press toward the mark
[1:12:59] for the prize of the high calling of god
[1:13:02] in christ jesus
[1:13:06] brother branham is given a quote and i
[1:13:08] want to share a couple with you before
[1:13:10] we go forward
[1:13:13] he said as it was in them days
[1:13:16] he said so will it be
[1:13:19] the message went forth and they merely
[1:13:22] laughed at it
[1:13:23] mocked at it
[1:13:25] as someone who was telling some kind of
[1:13:28] an idol tale
[1:13:30] but it was of mercy
[1:13:32] and it was a grace
[1:13:34] and it was of deliverance
[1:13:37] oh my
[1:13:38] he said and the angel said that morning
[1:13:41] to lot after he'd give that message
[1:13:44] he said hasten
[1:13:46] come hither
[1:13:48] for i can do nothing till thou has come
[1:13:51] hither
[1:13:53] i want you to notice now this this now
[1:13:56] because we have to cut short here on the
[1:13:58] account of a prayer line did you notice
[1:14:00] that the angel said i can do nothing
[1:14:04] till you come hither
[1:14:06] what was it it was the message of
[1:14:08] deliverance
[1:14:11] and before one of the fire could fall
[1:14:14] from heaven lot had to get out of sodom
[1:14:19] he said and before one drop of rain fell
[1:14:24] from heaven
[1:14:25] noah went into the ark
[1:14:28] and before the atom bomb can strike this
[1:14:31] nation
[1:14:32] the church will go in a rapture to meet
[1:14:35] the lord jesus
[1:14:42] and if sputniks and missiles are said
[1:14:44] and hammers are pulled back
[1:14:46] and the angels of god are all standing
[1:14:49] in order hallelujah
[1:14:51] the great quarters of heaven is crowded
[1:14:53] full the hearts are all in tune the
[1:14:57] great bands are already practiced up
[1:15:00] there's a home time
[1:15:02] coming pretty soon he says a homecoming
[1:15:06] time coming pretty soon for the church
[1:15:08] of the living god who's been waiting for
[1:15:11] his coming
[1:15:12] everything's in order
[1:15:16] i'm so glad i'm tell i'm getting so
[1:15:19] tired oh for that great hour and to
[1:15:22] think that we've had a part in this
[1:15:25] junction of time
[1:15:30] remember
[1:15:31] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:15:33] of man
[1:15:34] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:15:36] from heaven
[1:15:37] now remember before the rain fell noah
[1:15:40] was in the ark
[1:15:42] before fire fell lot was out of sodom
[1:15:45] the angel said i can do nothing
[1:15:48] until it you come hither
[1:15:53] he said i've got the lever in my hand
[1:15:57] to pull and make the fires fall from
[1:15:59] heaven
[1:16:04] and i think that's exactly
[1:16:06] the angel of destruction is holding
[1:16:12] the hand of russia
[1:16:20] with atomic bombs
[1:16:23] until the church comes together as one
[1:16:26] great body
[1:16:28] of christ
[1:16:29] i can do nothing
[1:16:33] until you come hither
[1:16:35] or if that isn't a blessed assurance
[1:16:40] and if we can see everything set in
[1:16:43] order
[1:16:44] i don't want this just to be another
[1:16:45] quote
[1:16:46] you're a part of this
[1:16:50] it could not happen until you were ready
[1:16:59] you thought you were just moving from
[1:17:00] mississippi you thought you were moving
[1:17:02] from west virginia you thought you were
[1:17:04] doing this you thought you were doing
[1:17:06] that
[1:17:09] everything had to be in exactly the
[1:17:11] right order
[1:17:13] hats got to be in the right place
[1:17:17] before it can happen no man listen let
[1:17:20] me just say this is not being
[1:17:22] orchestrated by some feeble man
[1:17:26] i want to be very much assured you this
[1:17:28] is not being orchestrated by some
[1:17:30] politics
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:35] listen brother branham wasn't even in
[1:17:36] charge of this
[1:17:38] he was the messenger of the age
[1:17:41] that was entrusted
[1:17:44] a man that could not even save his own
[1:17:46] self it took the blood of jesus christ
[1:17:50] a redeemed man to speak the word of life
[1:17:54] and we are redeemed people that can come
[1:17:57] to our place of order
[1:18:08] another quote
[1:18:10] the church has not recognized her day
[1:18:16] like israel back in her promised land
[1:18:19] she don't know how she got back there
[1:18:24] it's quite a step isn't it brother
[1:18:26] brandon was saying as a prophet
[1:18:28] looking at israel back in her homeland
[1:18:31] she don't even know how she got back
[1:18:32] there
[1:18:34] how many times have we heard people that
[1:18:36] were extremely rich
[1:18:38] left their homes left their businesses
[1:18:40] left everything with the clothes on
[1:18:42] their back and moved back to israel
[1:18:44] because they were driven
[1:18:48] they were driven to go home
[1:18:51] that's where we're at you united states
[1:18:54] is a wonderful place
[1:18:56] your country's wherever you're listening
[1:18:58] to this message is a wonderful place but
[1:19:00] this isn't home
[1:19:03] we're being driven
[1:19:09] we're magnetized to the word of life
[1:19:13] [Applause]
[1:19:15] what left others they wasn't magnetized
[1:19:17] to it jesus would say blessed are your
[1:19:20] eyes for you see blessed are your ears
[1:19:23] you couldn't make yourself see this
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:32] she don't know how she got back there
[1:19:35] she was just automatically put back
[1:19:37] there
[1:19:40] national forest notice these words
[1:19:43] national force
[1:19:45] put her in her place
[1:19:47] and he said i'm going to say something
[1:19:50] national force put israel in her
[1:19:53] homeland
[1:19:55] national force
[1:19:57] notice these next words by the prophet
[1:20:00] national force
[1:20:02] will put the church in the world council
[1:20:06] of churches
[1:20:13] the umbilical cord that holds them all
[1:20:15] together is the baptism
[1:20:18] the greatest lie that was ever told that
[1:20:20] denies the deity of jesus christ
[1:20:25] that jesus was god
[1:20:28] or he was the greatest deceiver that
[1:20:30] ever lived
[1:20:31] but jesus was god
[1:20:33] and the lie was father son holy ghost
[1:20:36] baptism
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:45] but the power of god
[1:20:47] that's what we're witnessing now
[1:20:51] the power of god will put the people
[1:20:55] in the bride
[1:20:58] then who gathered you
[1:21:04] who gathered you
[1:21:06] who put you here
[1:21:08] wherever you are listening
[1:21:11] who put you in your church
[1:21:14] who put you there what drives you there
[1:21:17] not the personality of a man
[1:21:23] we're not building kingdoms here
[1:21:26] worshiping it god's not going to send
[1:21:28] another messenger
[1:21:31] listen if this message didn't awaken you
[1:21:33] to prepare you for the rapture there's
[1:21:36] not another rapture coming
[1:21:40] there's not another messenger coming
[1:21:49] the world forces this way and the world
[1:21:51] forces that way
[1:21:53] but god forces
[1:21:54] upward the spirit of god which is the
[1:21:57] word of god which is
[1:21:59] the word
[1:22:01] my word is spirit and life
[1:22:03] will put the bride in her place
[1:22:05] and she'll recognize her position in the
[1:22:08] word
[1:22:08] and she'll be in christ will put her in
[1:22:11] her place no national force will do that
[1:22:14] he said but the national force did drive
[1:22:17] israel to her homeland the national
[1:22:19] force puts the church of the council of
[1:22:22] churches will drive every organization
[1:22:24] into it but the power of god will raise
[1:22:26] the bride into glory
[1:22:34] i wanted to say this to you we are the
[1:22:36] final we're the final runners
[1:22:42] never let this statement just ease
[1:22:44] across your ears
[1:22:47] you're the final voice
[1:22:52] to the final age
[1:22:59] you may not be a preacher but you're
[1:23:01] preaching a life
[1:23:04] you're a signature addition of what this
[1:23:07] bible and this message is
[1:23:10] you're sealed by the token the the
[1:23:14] conductor himself checked your your your
[1:23:17] luggage he checked your life
[1:23:20] everything was in order
[1:23:25] hallelujah you went through the
[1:23:26] sanctification process you went through
[1:23:29] the justification process
[1:23:32] and he sealed you with the holy ghost
[1:23:36] his own life
[1:23:48] we
[1:23:49] i just want to share a couple things
[1:23:50] with you before i go far
[1:23:54] the scripture said that these signs
[1:23:56] shall follow them that believe
[1:24:03] we're not imitators of brother branham
[1:24:09] neither and that was not a gift
[1:24:12] that was christ himself
[1:24:16] don't don't confuse what brother branham
[1:24:18] had as some pentecostal gift
[1:24:22] he was not reading minds he was not
[1:24:24] telepathy
[1:24:26] when he was standing there with that
[1:24:28] blind man and he turned and said which
[1:24:30] of your gods can come heal this man
[1:24:36] when he was standing there over that
[1:24:37] little boy in finland
[1:24:40] he said if he smiled off of the ground
[1:24:41] in five minutes call me a false prophet
[1:24:44] you better know where you stand
[1:24:46] when he would step out behind the
[1:24:48] audience said if i'm not telling the
[1:24:50] truth may god strike me dead
[1:24:54] and then in the next few minutes call
[1:24:56] out 14 different people
[1:24:58] and tell them more than five incidents
[1:25:01] of peace
[1:25:03] and was absolutely right
[1:25:08] we're not fooling with some pentecostal
[1:25:10] nonsense
[1:25:20] when i said that nonsense i'm talking
[1:25:22] about impersonators
[1:25:27] i caught that
[1:25:32] now
[1:25:34] just like you
[1:25:35] we all have a testimony
[1:25:44] brother biscuit was
[1:25:46] i'm just going to share a couple things
[1:25:47] here to kind of set the stage
[1:25:50] brother biscuit was wrote
[1:25:53] by a sister in switzerland
[1:25:56] and you've heard it you've heard it for
[1:25:58] decade
[1:25:59] that she was a wounded one
[1:26:02] stood in your pulpit and told this story
[1:26:05] stood here
[1:26:06] i actually accompanied by the david
[1:26:09] mayer
[1:26:10] incidentally i'll share that in a moment
[1:26:13] brother
[1:26:15] bischo
[1:26:16] felt led to ask me to be a part of those
[1:26:18] meetings
[1:26:21] i felt greatly honored
[1:26:25] because i believe in the supernatural
[1:26:29] and that this sister which i know very
[1:26:31] well
[1:26:32] wrote him
[1:26:34] she was driven to see revival
[1:26:38] she was driven to see this message lived
[1:26:42] in her country
[1:26:45] meetings evolved and i'm not going to
[1:26:47] take a long time because history tells
[1:26:49] it meetings evolved
[1:26:54] and year after year that meeting grew
[1:26:57] and people came from country after
[1:26:59] country
[1:27:01] one cut one particular meeting was 19
[1:27:04] different countries came to that meeting
[1:27:08] and i went there
[1:27:10] about 10 times
[1:27:14] it's not an easy trip
[1:27:16] it's not a vacation
[1:27:20] one morning after being severely sick
[1:27:22] for about 36 hours i would think
[1:27:26] maybe just a little less than that
[1:27:30] extremely sick i actually thought i was
[1:27:31] going to die
[1:27:33] and i'm not i'm not making that up
[1:27:36] brother glenn gruener came to my rescue
[1:27:40] god touch my body
[1:27:44] and i went back to sleep and when i woke
[1:27:46] up a couple hours later it's i i was as
[1:27:48] strong in that moment as i am right now
[1:27:51] i knew it was supernatural
[1:27:54] and i walked to the pulpit that morning
[1:27:56] and i spoke a sermon called
[1:27:58] what will you be remembered for
[1:28:00] sister cassie actually wrote a
[1:28:04] wrote a song
[1:28:08] about that
[1:28:10] in that meeting
[1:28:12] brother biscuit was sitting there
[1:28:14] and he recognized i want you to
[1:28:16] understand now he recognized the
[1:28:18] atmosphere not the man but he recognized
[1:28:21] the atmosphere was the same that he said
[1:28:24] had in the 60s
[1:28:29] and he said i have a need
[1:28:31] and he had worked on a project for for
[1:28:34] over a decade with lawyers and and many
[1:28:38] high-powered men to try to help it get
[1:28:40] taken care of
[1:28:42] and after the meeting was over with he
[1:28:45] said i have a need and i want brother
[1:28:48] ron to pray for me
[1:28:54] and i prayed for a man on the left of
[1:28:56] the and then i left because i was very
[1:28:58] weary and i walked down and joshua von
[1:29:01] de brunt was standing there you've heard
[1:29:03] me tell this story before
[1:29:06] joshua von der brock was standing there
[1:29:08] brother guido's son
[1:29:10] and i
[1:29:11] and i turned to him and i said you'll
[1:29:13] preach the gospel and you'll need the
[1:29:15] holy ghost to go with it and he fell to
[1:29:18] the ground
[1:29:22] and he turned and brother biscuit was
[1:29:23] there and he prayed with brother bischo
[1:29:26] and as i prayed with brother biscuit his
[1:29:29] wife and daughter as i prayed with him i
[1:29:31] didn't know the deed he didn't share it
[1:29:33] with me and didn't need to share it with
[1:29:35] me and as i prayed the words flowed out
[1:29:38] of my mouth they gave him direction
[1:29:44] 90 days later it was done
[1:29:51] what men couldn't do what himself
[1:29:53] couldn't do
[1:29:57] that atmosphere
[1:30:00] that same lord jesus that's in the
[1:30:03] building right now
[1:30:08] don't you make light of this right now
[1:30:10] don't make light of it
[1:30:20] boys are a witness
[1:30:22] brother biscuit called me
[1:30:27] a few years ago
[1:30:29] and he said brother ronnie
[1:30:31] i'm only calling you
[1:30:33] i'm sitting on the table right now
[1:30:35] and they're wanting to do heart surgery
[1:30:38] open heart surgery
[1:30:40] i'm no better than anybody else but he
[1:30:42] felt to call me
[1:30:44] matthew was you
[1:30:47] was you driving the truck
[1:30:50] i think you were
[1:30:51] i think you were driving a truck
[1:30:56] i'm just gonna empty my heart today
[1:31:02] matthew
[1:31:04] was driving the truck we were sitting in
[1:31:06] the truck
[1:31:08] we had just left
[1:31:10] near
[1:31:14] harbor freight
[1:31:16] we had just left that area in
[1:31:18] harrisonburg
[1:31:20] and we're turning the corner i didn't
[1:31:21] tell brother biscuit that i was in a
[1:31:23] truck
[1:31:25] he just asked me to pray
[1:31:29] and i was aware that this is the same
[1:31:32] man
[1:31:33] that said in the car
[1:31:36] when they were talking about could this
[1:31:38] be elijah
[1:31:41] and in that instance the angel came into
[1:31:44] the car
[1:31:46] stay with me now the angel came into the
[1:31:49] car
[1:31:50] and pushed brother briscoe whom i'm now
[1:31:52] praying for his head and he turned and
[1:31:55] he said i looked out the corner of my
[1:31:56] eye and brother biscuit
[1:31:59] brother branham's face was ash and white
[1:32:00] and his beard was standing out
[1:32:05] and i realized who i'm praying for
[1:32:10] there's some moments between life and
[1:32:12] death
[1:32:15] when you're talking about open heart
[1:32:17] surgery
[1:32:19] on an 80 couple year old man
[1:32:21] you're talking about
[1:32:23] this is between life and death
[1:32:27] and as the prayer went
[1:32:29] god anoint
[1:32:31] a young doctor to step in at the last
[1:32:34] moment to take the case
[1:32:40] brother biscuit had been been dealing
[1:32:41] with a set of doctors
[1:32:44] and in the last moment
[1:32:46] a young doctor walked in and took the
[1:32:49] case and said i'll be taking the case
[1:32:51] and he remembered what the words were in
[1:32:53] the prayer
[1:33:00] and it was a complete different kind of
[1:33:01] procedure
[1:33:03] don't tell me god's not among us
[1:33:08] here's what i'm trying to drive down to
[1:33:10] us now
[1:33:11] don't sit on your pew and think this is
[1:33:13] just another church
[1:33:16] or just another bride around the world
[1:33:18] where we built
[1:33:20] churches we drove down stakes
[1:33:24] we preached the message of the hour
[1:33:27] god didn't do this just to see if he
[1:33:29] could build a church
[1:33:30] he's building a bride
[1:33:37] and she's born of his bone she's life of
[1:33:40] his life she's power of his power
[1:33:51] it would be in that country
[1:33:53] that a man like francois leprecha has
[1:33:55] been driven to speak to translate the
[1:33:59] message
[1:34:00] to the french people for all of these
[1:34:03] years
[1:34:04] would see renewed revival and i'm
[1:34:07] speaking this i hope it gets to him
[1:34:09] and a man named
[1:34:11] david mayer
[1:34:13] would rise from the ashes
[1:34:22] now as a church
[1:34:23] now has a beautiful congregation
[1:34:26] now speaks in brother biscuit's meeting
[1:34:29] brother tom's meeting over the last few
[1:34:31] years the morning service and i say
[1:34:33] doing a phenomenal job
[1:34:36] not because he was a talented man
[1:34:38] because god had elected him and anointed
[1:34:42] him
[1:34:44] and there was a time and season to raise
[1:34:46] him up
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:51] are you with me
[1:34:53] this is more than ed bischo's vision
[1:34:56] this is more than our vision this church
[1:34:59] is more than homer fraser vision it's
[1:35:02] god's vision
[1:35:04] [Applause]
[1:35:18] i found it interesting that brother
[1:35:20] david mayer sent me pictures
[1:35:23] of baptizing his last daughter joanna
[1:35:27] this morning
[1:35:35] this morning
[1:35:36] all three of his children baptized
[1:35:53] i want to be very
[1:35:55] attentive now
[1:36:01] we are here to advance
[1:36:06] we're not here to go back
[1:36:11] our worship is not taking us back to
[1:36:13] azusa street pentecost
[1:36:16] that was under the man age
[1:36:19] it is not to create a rally
[1:36:24] it's not to ride on our emotions
[1:36:27] but it is what the word has produced
[1:36:30] and brother ram said anything that
[1:36:32] without life it's dead
[1:36:34] and it needs to be buried
[1:36:41] brother branham said
[1:36:42] in in the
[1:36:44] invisible union of the bride he said
[1:36:47] the modern church
[1:36:48] don't want any of this whooping and
[1:36:51] screaming and crying
[1:36:54] they'd get real nervous in our services
[1:36:56] even now
[1:36:59] whooping screaming and speaking in
[1:37:01] tongues but he said that's the only kind
[1:37:05] that the word can produce
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:28] now
[1:37:33] this is more than an evolving
[1:37:39] with man
[1:37:41] it wasn't much too long ago
[1:37:44] that the highest horsepower
[1:37:47] was
[1:37:48] was horses
[1:37:52] you haven't got it that's where that
[1:37:53] term come from
[1:37:56] and men bred horses
[1:37:59] the fastest the strongest
[1:38:02] to do work with them
[1:38:04] to
[1:38:06] foreforeign work and of course they
[1:38:08] raised them because that's always in man
[1:38:10] it's competition
[1:38:12] and so
[1:38:13] it went from
[1:38:15] horses
[1:38:17] to a guy that was driven to have an idea
[1:38:22] that you could have horsepower
[1:38:25] in an engine
[1:38:27] i know i'm skipping a lot of steps but i
[1:38:29] i don't i don't
[1:38:31] have long to speak to you
[1:38:33] so
[1:38:35] one engine after another
[1:38:38] now you could have stayed with that
[1:38:39] horse
[1:38:42] but coming by you
[1:38:45] were men in race cars
[1:38:56] now i don't want you to miss this now
[1:38:59] but in
[1:39:01] but in martin luther's day
[1:39:03] they were driven that me and you could
[1:39:06] have a bible
[1:39:09] they were driven that the church could
[1:39:11] have a bible of their own
[1:39:14] we were driven
[1:39:16] that there would be bibles in in china
[1:39:21] listen murphy wong was driven that there
[1:39:23] would be bibles in china
[1:39:27] don't worry god's got a bride there
[1:39:30] and the communistic party will not shut
[1:39:32] them down
[1:39:35] you can arrest them
[1:39:37] you can do what you want to but you
[1:39:39] can't you can't stop the seed of god
[1:39:44] [Applause]
[1:39:54] now
[1:39:55] the next messenger would come
[1:39:58] many would stay with the old message
[1:40:02] many would stay with the old message
[1:40:04] because it felt sure
[1:40:07] it's mamas it was mama's church it was
[1:40:10] daddy's church how could they be wrong
[1:40:12] but the light went further
[1:40:18] and the just shall live by faith
[1:40:22] you don't have to pray to a bishop you
[1:40:24] don't have to pray for a pope you don't
[1:40:26] have to count rosary beads the just
[1:40:29] shall live by faith
[1:40:31] but there came a day where that word
[1:40:33] became obsolete and men denominated it
[1:40:37] and then along came wesley
[1:40:40] and wesley left his co-formal lutheran
[1:40:44] church
[1:40:45] and moved out and preached in streets
[1:40:48] and in fields and wherever he could
[1:40:51] preach
[1:40:52] and they called it the new method
[1:40:55] and people would fall out of the holy
[1:40:58] ghost literally thousands at a time
[1:41:00] would fall out under that anointing
[1:41:06] i wish this could get to jeffersonville
[1:41:08] tonight
[1:41:09] i wish this would go to them
[1:41:11] but it wasn't just wesley preaching the
[1:41:14] message
[1:41:15] but men were anointed around the world
[1:41:20] to grab that new light and preach it men
[1:41:23] like peter cartwright
[1:41:27] and they were driven
[1:41:30] they spent their their energies they
[1:41:33] spent their life
[1:41:35] they were driven to preach this new word
[1:41:39] [Applause]
[1:41:44] this message came
[1:41:48] and there's a fifo ministry
[1:41:54] and no jeffersonville will never shut us
[1:41:57] down
[1:42:00] it is not our headquarters
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:19] and i'm going to say it very strongly
[1:42:21] they're only living on the light
[1:42:24] of decades ago
[1:42:36] we are the final voice
[1:42:39] and let me just echo this i believe in
[1:42:42] listening to james
[1:42:45] i believe that atmosphere ought to be in
[1:42:47] your homes
[1:42:49] but you need a god call pastor
[1:43:12] to keep the church clean
[1:43:14] [Applause]
[1:43:17] a man he doesn't have to be able to do
[1:43:19] nothing to preach his way out of a paper
[1:43:21] bag that doesn't matter but a holy
[1:43:23] ghost-filled man
[1:43:25] that believes the message and he's
[1:43:27] driven
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:31] he's driven
[1:43:32] not to reproduce himself but to preach
[1:43:35] the word of christ
[1:43:37] and this message is christ and if you
[1:43:40] get in it it'll produce jesus christ
[1:43:51] the reason some of you are not rejoicing
[1:43:53] is because you ain't been in it in a
[1:43:54] long time you're only occupying a pew
[1:43:58] you're only taking up space
[1:44:00] and if you're not careful you're going
[1:44:02] to miss it
[1:44:18] amen
[1:44:28] and i'm saying these things because i
[1:44:30] feel the very freedom
[1:44:32] of the very angel of the lord
[1:44:37] you see last night i'm just going to go
[1:44:39] ahead and tell you this
[1:44:41] last night when i started saying some of
[1:44:43] these things and even about the vaccine
[1:44:47] if that made you mad you need the holy
[1:44:49] ghost
[1:44:52] [Applause]
[1:45:02] the holy ghost is the inoculation to
[1:45:05] keep you from sin
[1:45:08] you need that vaccine
[1:45:13] and if you don't have the holy ghost
[1:45:15] it's a sure thing you're going in the
[1:45:17] tribulation period
[1:45:20] so you above all people need to pay
[1:45:22] attention to these services to prepare
[1:45:25] you to give you strength to get you
[1:45:27] through
[1:45:28] the tribulation period
[1:45:30] don't miss a service
[1:45:52] i'm going to be longer in an hour i
[1:45:54] apologize ahead of time
[1:46:06] but i'm paying for your ice cream
[1:46:10] i've already paid for your ham
[1:46:12] sandwiches i'm going to pay for your ice
[1:46:13] cream you're going to get after church
[1:46:15] so we might as well have church
[1:46:18] [Applause]
[1:46:28] i'm sorry i made that announcement early
[1:46:36] but i had to get some of them back on
[1:46:37] board with me
[1:46:41] brother branham would have a vision of a
[1:46:43] bride
[1:46:46] and they
[1:46:47] first of all there was a vision of this
[1:46:49] this bride as it came into view and it
[1:46:51] was worldly it was that modern church
[1:46:55] and it came up and he saw it
[1:47:00] i don't want you to do it but these
[1:47:02] modern televangelists
[1:47:04] when they scan the audience
[1:47:09] i'm not being judgmental they are being
[1:47:11] judgmental
[1:47:16] when brother brandon says not one bobbed
[1:47:18] heard woman in heaven
[1:47:25] and they've got crossdressers sitting
[1:47:26] all across their audience
[1:47:32] you thought i was talking about a man
[1:47:36] but there they said in their pants the
[1:47:37] women sit in their pants
[1:47:40] and run the church
[1:47:43] the church is run by a bunch of cross
[1:47:45] dressers if you ain't got it
[1:47:46] straightened out yet
[1:47:48] put it on youtube if you want to it'll
[1:47:50] be all right it's the truth anyway
[1:47:51] [Applause]
[1:48:02] brother branham was ashamed he said is
[1:48:04] this what my message produced oh yeah
[1:48:07] he was ashamed he felt like
[1:48:09] i haven't done the job he was just so
[1:48:11] defeated
[1:48:12] and the angel reminded him
[1:48:15] here come the bride
[1:48:18] now when brother branham was even here
[1:48:19] in harrisonburg just like he was all
[1:48:22] over the world seven times
[1:48:24] the mouse that he traveled is why they
[1:48:27] say it seven times but
[1:48:29] brother branham preached the same
[1:48:30] message in africa as he did here
[1:48:35] now this reason that is is the same holy
[1:48:38] ghost that's in
[1:48:39] elkton virginia is the same holy ghost
[1:48:43] that is in johnson
[1:48:44] city or in in arkansas it's the same
[1:48:48] holy ghost it doesn't it's not cultural
[1:48:52] it's not cultural
[1:48:55] it's not european it's not it's not
[1:48:57] german
[1:49:00] it's not black and white
[1:49:04] it's the same life that was in jesus
[1:49:07] christ and if you remember
[1:49:09] he said that we would do the greater
[1:49:11] works
[1:49:12] i'm okay i just failed
[1:49:14] that we would do the greater works
[1:49:17] satan knows
[1:49:21] brother nathanael when he looks in our
[1:49:23] eyes
[1:49:24] it's the same life that he looked in
[1:49:27] jesus's eyes
[1:49:30] [Applause]
[1:49:33] satan knows it's the same life when he
[1:49:36] looks in your eyes
[1:49:39] in your vassal it's not you living it no
[1:49:42] more it's
[1:49:44] him living
[1:49:56] i need i need a tissue or something
[1:50:02] thank you
[1:50:10] reason i shared that with you about
[1:50:14] brother bisical
[1:50:16] is now i want to share something across
[1:50:18] the airwaves
[1:50:20] to a very dear buddy of mine
[1:50:27] as i was reminded last night
[1:50:30] at about 3 30
[1:50:32] about a vision that i had
[1:50:35] when i stood
[1:50:37] we were standing in a very dark place
[1:50:40] and people were mingling in the darkness
[1:50:43] and and i was standing on one side of
[1:50:46] the gate
[1:50:47] and tim pruitt was standing on the other
[1:50:49] side of the gate
[1:50:51] and we were doing our absolute best
[1:50:55] to get them into the light
[1:50:57] and it was the greatest light i'd ever
[1:50:59] seen it was like ropes coming out of it
[1:51:01] was like beams of light that was coming
[1:51:04] out of the gates and it was like angels
[1:51:06] music that was coming out of it
[1:51:11] it was beams and we were working we were
[1:51:14] driven
[1:51:18] brother tim has just lost that which is
[1:51:20] most precious to him
[1:51:22] is his wife
[1:51:25] she's now standing in another room
[1:51:31] with esther's baby
[1:51:34] with other babies
[1:51:36] that she didn't get to know in this life
[1:51:38] but she got to know them the moment she
[1:51:40] stepped across
[1:51:41] [Applause]
[1:51:44] i've got two sisters there i'll meet one
[1:51:47] of these days
[1:51:57] god has ordained a doctor
[1:52:00] to be able to perform surgery on you
[1:52:01] brother tim
[1:52:03] because you've got a lot of work to do
[1:52:06] and i'm reminded by that vision
[1:52:09] he said brother on you're talking
[1:52:10] personal now absolutely i'm reminded by
[1:52:13] that vision
[1:52:14] that you will continue to work in this
[1:52:17] dark age
[1:52:18] and you will be driven
[1:52:21] driven beyond humanity
[1:52:24] you'll be driven
[1:52:26] we got a lot of work to
[1:52:28] do hallelujah we've been praying for a
[1:52:32] visitation and it came last night
[1:52:35] and i stand there order to the lord to
[1:52:37] say this very clearly we've got a lot of
[1:52:40] work to do brother tim
[1:52:43] [Applause]

[1:52:59] and i'm going to need your help here
[1:53:00] just now
[1:53:02] he stood here just only months ago a
[1:53:04] couple months ago
[1:53:05] and he told you that he was going to
[1:53:07] sing

[1:53:19] in theory and composition she don't want
[1:53:22] me telling that but she does
[1:53:24] a piano
[1:53:28] she could have sold that gift to the
[1:53:29] world
[1:53:35] and i'm going to say this very clearly
[1:53:37] she could have walked out
[1:53:39] when a lot of the others walked out
[1:53:43] so if you want a hero
[1:54:19] and she begins to play that song while
[1:54:21] he continues

[1:54:29] very sensitive to the spirit of god

[1:54:38] i'm not for time's sake
[1:54:40] he's in tune

[1:55:54] that this room is getting ready to be
[1:55:56] filled with the presence of jesus

[1:56:04] be here at the same time
[1:56:06] his brother-in-law timothy pruitt
[1:56:08] is preaching
[1:56:11] and he's coming down to the end
[1:56:15] and he steps out here
[1:56:17] and he begins to talk about the fourth
[1:56:19] man in the fire
[1:56:21] and could you imagine
[1:56:24] and his ipad
[1:56:27] i was sitting there watching
[1:56:32] i watched the ipad flip
[1:56:36] and change
[1:56:38] what's the term
[1:56:40] go from one
[1:56:42] one act to another
[1:56:46] i just know how to thumb through these
[1:56:47] things
[1:56:49] and i watch it change
[1:56:51] i turned to andrew and i said the angel
[1:56:54] of the lord is standing at the pulpit
[1:56:57] and brother branham's voice begins to
[1:56:59] come on
[1:57:02] and he's talking about the song being
[1:57:04] written
[1:57:05] down from his glory
[1:57:10] no man did that
[1:57:13] no man brought you here
[1:57:16] no man produced this message
[1:57:19] no man did
[1:57:21] that you're right
[1:57:49] i'd like to mention a few few driven men
[1:57:52] had biscuit
[1:57:54] driven to get this message out
[1:57:57] driven not to have a kingdom of his own
[1:58:01] driven not to call not to have men lift
[1:58:03] him up
[1:58:04] driven
[1:58:05] and would become upset if you would lift
[1:58:08] him
[1:58:13] donny reagan
[1:58:15] driven
[1:58:19] let me just say this to you and i say it
[1:58:21] around the world
[1:58:23] there's not a denomination in the world
[1:58:25] has produced
[1:58:26] preachers
[1:58:31] not a school of theology has produced
[1:58:34] men
[1:58:36] that could carry donnie reagan's lunch
[1:58:38] box
[1:58:40] [Applause]
[1:58:52] last night when i i defended
[1:58:54] when i defended the fifo ministry a
[1:58:57] demon raised up from right here and
[1:58:59] began to raise and it raised and it
[1:59:01] raised i don't care if you believe it or
[1:59:02] not it raised and it was taller than me
[1:59:05] and i turned and started preaching to it
[1:59:08] and i preached to the devil and i stood
[1:59:10] here and i preached to the devil and
[1:59:12] after about five minutes it
[1:59:14] disintegrated
[1:59:16] like a bomb went off
[1:59:27] that is why
[1:59:33] [Applause]
[1:59:52] tim brooke could have said a crippled
[1:59:54] boy all of his life
[1:59:55] but he was driven
[1:59:59] he was driven to be able to stand on his
[2:00:01] feet and preach the gospel and go around
[2:00:04] the world and preach the gospel
[2:00:06] from a hole in the world place
[2:00:10] when he built this and he didn't have to
[2:00:12] go to get a loan god provided for every
[2:00:15] dime because god wanted that building to
[2:00:18] be set in there
[2:00:33] that's why satan hates this ministry
[2:00:41] that's why i have a 60th birthday
[2:00:43] present
[2:00:44] that my family got for me
[2:00:46] and it was my mother's bible that she
[2:00:48] gave me in 1984
[2:00:52] and i've used it through the years
[2:00:56] nathaniel it's nathaniel in the building
[2:01:00] nathan nathaniel you're nathaniel
[2:01:06] i carry his picture in this bible as a
[2:01:09] boy
[2:01:13] and it was so wore out
[2:01:16] but my family
[2:01:17] had it rebound for me that i could carry
[2:01:19] it
[2:01:20] so i could carry
[2:01:23] the way of a true prophet
[2:01:34] and on the back of it the lord said if
[2:01:36] you trust me i'll use you like never
[2:01:38] before
[2:01:42] it won't be much longer
[2:01:47] brother joe sits here today because of
[2:01:50] his father
[2:01:52] was driven
[2:01:56] it didn't take him 42 times to hear
[2:01:58] brother branham
[2:02:00] but when brother branham walked on the
[2:02:02] pulpit
[2:02:06] and he saw brother branham he said all i
[2:02:08] could do was weep
[2:02:12] he was consumed
[2:02:14] with the humbleness
[2:02:16] of elijah
[2:02:19] and from that point
[2:02:21] he was driven
[2:02:22] that there be churches around the world
[2:02:26] and i've heard you use the term of over
[2:02:28] 600 churches
