our heart a man you mean so much to us and we have certainly missed you during this time but anything it good just to be back together a man a man it's it's worth it to go through all the all the hoops and the jumps and everything just to be able to be in service and man we just love to would love to praise our Lord Jesus Christ for all that he has done for us and we want to move forward with things and and also want to keep these things in the back for a mind that we want to we want to keep these things so that we don't have any government or state anything shutting us down or whatever you know we don't want to be able to chase it trace something back to us and shut us down or shut your work down so that's why we're taking these precautions but I know that there's a god that is here that is greater than any sickness that's greater than any cancer he's God he's God and he's an awesome God if you would if you don't mind standing with me this morning and turn to the book of Psalms chapter 145 I like to do something just a little bit different this morning I'd like to read the The Book of Psalms 145 the chapter here I'll read the first verse and if you as a congregation could read the following verse and and we'll just move right down through the chapter there any good to be in the house of the Lord amen Psalms 145 I will extol thee my god Oh King and I will bless thy name forever and ever great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable I will speak of the of the glorious honor of the majesty and of thy wondrous works they shall abundantly utter the memory of that great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness the Lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over his works they shall speak of the glory of the kingdom and talk of thy power the kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and thy Dominion endureth throughout all generations the odds of all wait upon thee and now give us them their meat in due season the Lord is righteous

the one that is worthy to be extolled praise honor for his mighty acts that he's done in your life amen amen now we won't do we won't do as sumit said or maybe have thought we won't preach to you the same thought as we did last night just to see which one a man is the best or not we we just want to we're ready for the word this morning amen let's sing that song because he lives I can face tomorrow

it's just good to be here in a whole lot of ways we love you with all of our hearts and thank you for every prayer that you have prayed for us and every prayer that you will pray for us we are in a battle and we're here to fight amen amen I'm sorry that everybody from the church couldn't be here during this today but I wanted to go ahead and try to speak but I'd like to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'd like to thank you for being here I'd like for it to thank those that are was here last night and boy what an awesome job brother Andrew did last night am I just so awesome I'd like to thank sister Connie for being such a good nurse so awesome we have an incredible team that is taking care of ass of a family that is taking care of us and as I've related to you a team of doctors and nurses that are so caring and so kind and so so we're thankful for that we're thankful for all the things that he has brought us through we realized that we've got a long way to go I asked the doctor the other day when shall we see thee when will we see the end of the tunnel she said we haven't got to the tunnel yet so so we would take one day at a time until we do but isn't God good it's just so good to us and we have so many friends around the world that is praying for us and and we just we want to thank the Lord for His goodness and His mercy that endureth forever if you will turn with me this morning I'd like to I don't know I'd like to just talk to you about what's on my heart I don't know how long I / have the strength to speak my strength is limited I wish you could all come to my house but there will come a day where we'll have a picnic together and we'll try to get that fixed up and and they're limited in my company and you understand all of those things and a lot of preachers would like to come in and spend time with me but that's just not it's just not it I'm just not at that spot yet so we we thank you and there's a lot of there's a lot of difficult things that happen and and they happen almost daily but we we are glad that we can stand here yesterday morning we had a I had a seizure and that caused the whole day to be upset so I'm hoping not to have one here this morning but but I am you know if you just lay on the bed all the time the enemy gets the credit so I just might as well whip him while I can [Applause] I have a statement I'd like to make he hates me and I hate him we want to be real clear with that brother Steve he hates me and I hate him amen amen I'd like to speak to you today and maybe in a couple of weeks carry it on and I'd like to speak on who is Jesus and it may say seem simple for a few minutes but I got a feel and it's gonna get more complex than you would imagine because sometimes we think we know him and we don't we're acquainted with him and were not we're standing real within feet of him and we don't recognize him so do we really know him I think this is going to be good John chapter 1 and verse 1 can you hear me okay in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything that was made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended that not so you could be so close and miss him and there was a man sent from God whose name was John and the same comfort came for a witness to bear witness of the light then all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world and he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him not I like this next part but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth very familiar portion of Scripture and I read it to you in Luke chapter 9 and verse 18 and it came to pass as as they were alone a long praying and his his staples came Worth were with him and he asked them who say the people that I am and Jesus answering and they answered him saying John the Baptist and and some saying Elias and others saying one of the old prophets old prophets is risen again and he said unto them but who say ye but who say you than I am and Peter answering said the Christ of God you may be seated brother Brendan says now a lot of people have the wrong impression of Christ some people think that that Christ was a Christ was the greatest of all men he was an example man not only was he a man but he was God man he was God with us Emmanuel he was the humblest of all men but you can be too humble you can get so humble until until the devil would make a puppet out of you he was humble enough to to allow them to watch his feet he was forgiving enough to pray for those who drove spikes in his hands but he was man enough to plant ropes and run the money changers out of the house of God many times we come to church and we should ask ourselves this question did we see God or did we see man sometimes we should be asked the question look past what you see fake past what you think have faith beyond the realms of your senses many people never believed Mary's story of an angel of the Lord coming to her but there was a king that was getting ready to come to the earth we're just before Memorial Day and in this Memorial Day it's a day of remembrance to remember that there's been many battles lots of scars across this young nation of ours we are in an interesting and if even a very strange time we're in an election here where people have different various opinions willing to fight over them willing to politicize it we're willing to do whatever it takes to get their opinion across whether it will be virtual media or whatever it will be they will try their best to project their the thoughts and their opinions kingdoms have risen and kingdoms of fell Caesar Pharaoh Alexander they thought that they had incredible kingdoms they thought they had a lot of answers to different situations we look back at our great precedence whether it be George Washington or Abraham Lincoln we've had a Roosevelt's we we've had her Hoover's we've had her Bill Clinton's we've we've had them they stood and had great speech makers that stood down they were doing trying to do their best one of my favorite was a man named teddy and he went around the world one year given a speech I'd like to preach on that in a couple of weeks if I can men think that they have an answer they're looking for an answer for a plague this is an invisible war it's an invisible war ninety seven thousand of us Americans has perished in this war that's the size of one of the hugest football Coliseum's has died and many times that has been afflicted with the disease that you can't see and almost overnight you're afflicted thank God for those that are on the front line that is fighting that war [Applause] [Music] why are we here this morning because we're preparing to be a part of a citizenship a citizenship unlike anything this world has ever seen perfect peace perfect harmony we're built for that Kingdom to live in for the for the world they had great complexes about being shut-in but for the bride of Jesus Christ we're actually built for that we have a token over our home we have our God to take care of us we're believing for the best and even if we get sick we have a high physician are you with me I enjoyed over the last I'm going to be in quarantine for a while but mom's gonna be longer than 14 days but I think it's been about 19 weeks so far I've enjoyed being with my best friend I married her hallelujah I hope you're finding when you're you're you shut-in that you actually love your wife you've got a lot of things in common with her and you're enjoying the company enjoying family meals together we're built for this in this thoughts I'd like to just kind of begin by saying this did you entertain Jesus during this time through the Scriptures they would ask who is this Jesus they of all people should have known who he was they'd been looking for him since Abraham every prophet had a part of Jesus in him and when Jesus came on the scene he didn't come as a king he came as a baby and he began to grow up and this Jesus was among them Jesus is a baby in a manger Jesus is a child in Egypt Jesus being left with the doctors and the philosophers and the astronomers and actually when Jesus got finished talking they wanted to worship Him and even when Mary came back and forgot who Jesus was and denied the supernatural birth jesus corrected the error that she spake and said I am about my father's business he knew who he was he came with the mission of the earth knowing who he was today if we knew who he was we would not be so shaken our nation thinks that they know who Jesus is but they are so shaken they think they're looking for an answer but their pulpits are weak they've weakened their pulpits they took him out of their schools they took him out of their government they took him out of their halls of justice that's the reason America has became a weak nation it's they forgot who Jesus really is let me just say this to you if you ever meet Jesus you'll never be the same if you'll ever meet Jesus you will never have need Alcoholics Anonymous again in your life if you ever meet Jesus there will be no going back if you ever really meet him and he changes your life all your experiences will be much different one from another and it'll be personal in your life but if you ever meet the Jesus of this message many people meet this message but they don't meet the Jesus of it they meet pairs of personalities of ministers and fall in love with those personalities and follow it that way it's good to have strong personalities in the message and good to have strong preachers in the message but this message is more than about William Branham it's more than about our favorite preachers it's more than about our favorite quotes this message is Jesus Christ in word form in life form in action form this message is Jesus living in 2020 it'll cause a lot of reactions sometimes when Jesus comes on your hands people want to wash him they quickly want to wash Jesus but you can't escape him you can't escape this Jesus Pilate knew that he met somebody greater than him Herod knew that he met somebody greater than him because his presence was greater and they knew it why did the church world so hate him then and why did they hate him now it might be a great question to ask I know this is a different style of Ron Spencer preaching but this is what we got but I've got a feeling in hell they're very disappointed that I'm able to do anything when Jesus stood there and said I'm a I'm from above and you're from beneath I'd say that that didn't make a whole lot of friends we need Ben aside your fathers were in the wilderness yes they were but there everyone did they miss the message of their day from your churches you whited the walls of the Sepulcher I'd say that they wanted to wash their hands of Jesus dude they built seminaries without him huge schools without him all they hang his picture today but they'd be ashamed to have Jesus at their home they've got ashamed to have Jesus sitting across the table when he can look through you and he knows you know Jesus had strange friends you would think that that Jesus being the king of kings and the Lord of lords would not get hungry but he did you would think he would not get tired but he did you would think she would not curse a tree but he did this Jesus when he wanted to eat some of his best friends were married Martha and a man named Lazarus it was a place where he hung alt I'd like for my home to be a hangout where Jesus would feel comfortable that maybe maybe we you know we can think of it but maybe he would go to the home of the woman at the well after the change and he would feel comfortable at her home and people would come in and he would talk about the parables it isn't all written in the book brother Denis but he would tell us he would tell us many things one day he would he would call him and out of a tree today I want to eat with you you see they would say that he has dinner with sin us I'd like for him to have dinner with me songs poems pictures they have all been written about him painted of him I've read this to you before he came from the bosom of the Father and the bosom of a woman he put on humanity that we could put on divinity he become the son of a man that we might become the sons of God he came from heaven where rivers never freeze winds never blow Frost's never chills the air flowers will never fade where no one is ever sick I like a place like that don't you there's not an undertaker there there's not a graveyard on any Hill no one ever dies and no one ever is buried he was born contrary to the laws of nature he lived in poverty and reared in obscurity and crossed the boundary of land only once in his childhood he had no wealth he had no influence no training no formal education his relatives who was inconspicuous and not influential in infancy he startled the king in boyhood he puzzled the wise men in manhood he ruled in the course of nature he cruel he walked across the billows high special men and their wise men in manhood he ruled the course of nature He healed the multitudes without medicine I'd like to say his hands was dr. sands in his hands a dead girl could raise and live tell a walk a healthy life again are you with me now I would say sitting in our audiences we have felt the hands of this Jesus are you with me we have felt his nurturing hands reach and touch us wipe the tears from her eyes Paterson our backs covered us in her fear and our torment and remind us that he still our great intercessor he's still our healer he's still our covered up he's not 10,000 miles away he never founded the college yet all the schools together cannot boast of as many students as he has he never Marcille dander me drafted a soldier fired a gun yet no leader ever made had more volunteers who under his orders made rebel stack their arms of surrender without a shot being fired so I would say on this Memorial Day we have a five-star general that we remember to not and I read that with purpose I am honored I am honored beyond honor to be called one of the generals in the army of the Lord I am honored but the homer would sing the song I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord when I die I'm gonna go down fighting in the army of the Lord CS Lewis would say it like this when I die may all hell know that it's been a fight hallelujah he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief as we hit his where her face is from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows acquainted with grief there isn't nothing and he hasn't been acquainted with he has on me he had power to say these words I have power to lay my life down hearty heat it up again so he has power to carry us through some real difficult times everybody doesn't get a warning that they're gonna go through a trial like I was given warning I was gonna go through but he gave me ammunition after ammunition but the greatest ammunition he gave me was his word that I could hold on to every day and a family around me that would remind me of his word forgive me I don't know how many would see this and get bored and click off the channel but it doesn't mind I'm not really interested I'm really not interested I was thinking Jesus as he was there and he asked them whom the men say that I am that would that would come kind of like it has came today in the revealing of the son of a man and he and when brother Branham came to this area then they didn't know who he was you see if they do recognize who he was we'd have a cathedral on this hill that would go all of the way to the road but too many he was just another healing evangelists and they really must who he was but the Branham spokes five sermons on who is Jesus and he'll name one who is God in a cup and three of them and then who is Jesus especially in two of them missus men breakfast was what most of them were and he would stand before them and he would use this simple topic to talk about who is Jesus you can feel it why such a simple topic why don't you preach something neat to us he would say it later just by just by a couple sermons we'd like to figure out you know you know how to have miracles in and he he would explain that how can I teach you algebra when you don't even know you're a beast cease and he would break that down as always believe Christ before preach in a series that would be the greatest ever the seals he would preach God hidden and revealed in simplicity sometimes when we're looking for a great formula for success it is so simple just live the message just be there at the right time and at the right place brother on how how does it operate did you believe your mother when she told you your name did you trust her when he told you I forgive you of your sins go and sin no more or you had tried religion before maybe you tried and failed and tried and failed but when you really met Jesus in that moment whether lightning struck or where you saw a lot but you just know when you really met him you walked away from that event and you felt like you were cleansed and you would never be the same ever again and there wasn't a devil in hell could convince you away from that sometimes when you're looking at deep mysteries of God and God just one day opens up the page for you and you go I say something and you've read it all your life and they just opens it up and you go honey I've never seen this before but God just reveals something to me and I've not seen it I've read this a thousand times I've read it a thousand times and I've not seen it baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you've read it a thousand times but today you realize it's more than a recipe for baptism but it's the marriage covenant for Jesus Christ and it's the way that he fills you with his 'el your life and he seals you and he says your mind and you can read it to people and they never see it I wrote some interesting notes this morning you know the Jesus that lived 2,000 years ago came and lived inside of a redeemed man and that man would go on hunting trips with some of the most cruel people in the world BIRT called for one and this man had such a presence that that man saw Jesus and it changed his life in the last months of the brother branham's life he goes to a place you won't hear this many times but bread the brennaman still at hunting check out wood for a family and the man was a constant smoker and he was sitting on the porch with he told him what a millionaire that he was and led him to Christ brother branham as a younger man would stand in an infidel yard and pick up an apple that the bees was eating up that man that Haiti preachers all of his life but he'd never met Jesus sometimes we want to change men with philosophy but if we haven't don't have Jesus in our lives hurry with me doctors met Jesus over the last few months they proclaimed that they met Jesus over the last few months I heard them talk about the Jesus that was in the room over the last couple of months and I never preached a sermon I never hardly quoted a scripture but every one of them testified that he was in the room all your Jesus that lives on the inside of you will have characters around you like Jesus had Jesus had leaders around him Pilate Herod and Herod was known to be the greatest one of the greatest of all orators and there he was feet away and he missed Jesus there be people within feet of him that would be the rich rich young ruler if they really caught who you were coming to you now if they really caught who you were they'd respect you like never before but just as a rich young ruler they walk away from you like I walked away from Jesus all of us loved the believer that surround us the affection that I felt that I walked out of the into this room that's worth more than millions of dollars someone told me the other day that they believed I was one of the most loved men in the world I'll take that compliment and I appreciate the compliment but to get a friend you're gonna be a friend I'm not to identify with this part a believer I heard brother Homer preach a lot of funeral sermons but the funeral sermon that we'll always love that Homer preached was this man the believer the believer this woman the believer that's quite a statement without a whole lot being said the believer Jesus could turn and say that you were a believer Jesus also had some other characters in these in his life he had scoffers he had critics without saying a man you do too he had a Judas in his life sometimes we get things written about us that hurt our feelings that are scars to our life sister Connie that's difficult you don't know why people say what they do but that must be I'd like to tell you the critics in your life they must be there the critic stored the message they have to be there the critic stored Jesus they had to be there but the believers had to be there too are you with me I wrote a note down this morning what will you do with your twenty or thirty pieces of silver if that's what you get for hating this message and throwing your life away how will you spend your twenty to thirty pieces of silver is this what I get out of turning the message down my marriage falling apart my children going every whichaway I thought it would be different oh no that's what you get for turning Jesus down that that's the payment there's always a payment that goes with it there's ropes on these pews but what you don't realize when you turn Jesus down there's a rope around your neck maybe someone listens to that today and they said well brother Ron was talking about me thank God that it was while you still got breath in your lungs while you still got breath and there's a chance for you to turn it around get over your petty feelings get over it [Applause] people walk away from Jesus from for the silliest things they walk away hey listen I'm I can speak and you don't know how much longer I have in my life but I'm just gonna speak plainly from this point forward listen I'm just a representative of this message I'm a billboard of this message I'm a sound of this message listen the brother man preach sermons true sound overlooked I'm a sign that this message is still alive and it's well me standing in this pulpit today is a voice that says God can bring a man through brain cancer and he can still stand in the pulpit and still preach the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm a sign that this message works [Applause] inquiring minds want to know sob what just tell you my doctor told me the other day said sister gone I asked her what's the crystal ball for my future of my months and the future may be years in front of me she said how do you feel now and I said well I'm very weak she said well we're going to continue to pour chemo into your body and you'll get weaker and weaker one day you'll have to make a choice I don't want to take that no more but you'll get weaker and weaker so you're probably at your best right now I came home I wrote Andrew and said I'll be preaching Sunday morning if this is as strong as I get I'll preach and if it's 2 or 3 weeks from now I'll preach again are you listening can you give me that can you give me that they thought I would get more out of selling Jesus out no you didn't negotiate the deal that Elvis Presley did Elvis Presley sold him out and became a rock and roll star yeah and he had a castle and had women and he had and he had planes but you sold that way too cheap oh but I just turned on the Heather I turned on Jason oh no no no you turned on Jesus you just didn't recognize who Jesus was I turned on Steve I turned on Jeff you didn't recognize who Jesus was steve was one of those powerful men that said in this church but i'm sure he had his critics and I'm sure even as he was fighting in ALS that his critic said you know if God really healed he'd heal a great man like Steve but what you didn't realize at the end of the journey God gives him a body oh I want to say for my part it's been worth it I want to finish this sermon this morning and I know it's simple but I want to really say I'm glad I met Jesus I'm glad I met the Jesus of this Bible I'm glad I met the Jesus of this message brother bill I'm glad that you prayed with me that night at the altar you may not remember that but I'm glad you spent that time at the altar and prayed with me I knew quotes and I knew scriptures but I didn't know Jesus young people you may be sitting here this morning and yeah and you know you know a lot about the message but you don't know Jesus maybe you don't even know why we are going to go neck under to continue with Sunday morning services and your you know but it don't fit my schedule I could care less about your schedule one of the reasons is because I'm strong in the morning than the evening I'm very weak and so I asked Andrew to continue the Sunday morning services and if you want to tussle with that you probably need to meet Jesus anyway yeah can I just give you one more statement this morning if you don't believe this Jesus why don't you just go as Satan he knows who he is he knows who he is he's been whipped by him every day and 100% sure he knows who Jesus is but I'd like to ask God today that God would feel every fiber of my being and your being with the Jesus of this word and feel a life like never before but this Jesus of Christ but the realm would come to the spot and he would say are you the patients yes yes you can see it on deep calleth through the deep yes I can I can see you're nervous I can see you're emotional oh boy I can't see it I can't see that I i watch closely standing between you and eyes is him I don't know you we've never met before in our lives and in the just a few moments he begins to tell the story of the woman at the well and brother Harold before long he comes across that audience and you've stopped from this patient he'll point 14 out I counted it the other day brother William 14 people in a row he called them by name right down the line counted them counted it by name told them every one of their conditions let me tell you another part of that story in the evening service he comes back and he preaches another hour and a half and he comes and he prays for a couple of people and he goes across the aisle and goes all the way down through that aisle and tells all of their needs who is this Jesus I'm not talking about brother Branham but they walked out of that building and were never the same ever again I just read just before I came to the pulpit brother Branham was taken to an ambulance and the woman had kicked the windows out of the out of the ambulance before she had been in an institution for ten years and when brother got it brother Branham got finished he took tolling said go ahead and take her back to the institution but when she came to of the next morning she was different she didn't need to be an institution no more she went home clothed in a right mind and brother Brown who said the son of that family came to him and told him mama's different are you with me and that person would walk off for that a completely different individual then they'd walk off a complete different individual they they came into the presence of a God not the man we don't worship the man but they came in the presence of God when you read this message and when you really read it brother Benny you've been student of this message for many many years and you have I have had a special project going on even in China and there's brothers that are in prison now and may be in prison for a long long time and we are praying that they're out of prison we'll get out of prison listen we sit here today and we've been nine weeks without Church how many's missed that there's situations going on in China now they'll never have service ever again never they'll never be able to have service ever again but they say that as believers they're stronger than they've ever been through thought this last week Russia has condemned the message and their brothers and sisters under persecution it's been called the illegal material now that they no doubt what will happen to some of those churches and those pastors we need to pray for them but this Jesus made us a promise I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you to the end this Jesus made us a promise you'll come back for us John 14 in verse 6 and I want to leave you with the scripture I am the way boy this is a simple sermon issue is I have to agree with you it sure is des it live does it live for those that are watching by way of internet and you're going well brother Ron's washed up now he's going to preach more simple than he's ever preached in his life and I've just preached to you one of the most couple complex sermons does your neighbors see Jesus this the guy at work see Jesus the community do they see Jesus so this sermon just became more complex than you ever thought because I'm really not talking about the Jesus of two thousand years ago or even the one that lived in William Branham but the real Jesus is the one that lives in Katie and Katie and lives in you Deloris and lives in you Terry because it's easy to point there and there and there and there but did you meet Jesus who is the Jesus that lives in her life as a teenager you won't offer her drugs you won't really ask about why she even dresses the way that she does she's different why is that teacher that way because they met Jesus listen I'm not an apologetic Christian I don't know I am NOT an apologetic Christian oh I am this way because I'm a Christian you got the wrong attitude about that I am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you would have known him you should know my father also and henceforth you know him and you've seen him brother on I want to see Jesus he's living he's a living he's living in Johnson City he's living in Louisiana I'd like to report he's living in Elkton Virginia I love you I love you with all my heart hallelujah you'll get to cut the curls again they're growing really really slow right now when I walked in and sit down in her chair many years ago I didn't preach to her I didn't tell her what a bad girl she was I didn't tell her I lost but I prayed in her chair you know I did that you're just here your children said that Jesus has changed your life got time for one more story I was being pushed into the operating room and they prayed a prayer I pray for you as a church I pray for my family I prayed that God would break the cycle of this cancer and the man that was pushing the the hospital bed they called him transport he said that's the most beautiful prayer I've ever heard prayed I hope he saw Jesus on the way to the operating room I love you with all my heart I want to thank you for your time today I love the Brethren sisters around the world could we just stand to sing that song I love him because he first loved me don't you love him more than you've ever loved him before I just love it when he washes my eyes with tears I just love it when he curls me up and hugs me it tells me how much he cares but I sure like to sing it back to him Andrew Andrew won't you come sing that I just I want to thank the Lord for what an incredible job Andrews doing [Applause] I love him [Music] because he first loved [Music] Cheers [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] let's just sing it make it ring [Music] [Applause] because he first loved me [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh Calvary history whoa [Music] Oh [Music] love Rico heeey [Laughter] [Music] and [Music] Samhain sheesh [Music] Oh [Music] true who did you see today [Music] did you see a man that had been diagnosed with cancer did you see Jesus did you see the formalities or did you see Jesus and what will you do with this man called Jesus the word has been delivered to you you will make your ways home go about your week but what will you do with Jesus sister what will you allow Jesus to do you let them enter your your home enter your heart into your relationships what will you do with this man called Jesus I know what hard to do I want to make him Lord not just Lord over services the Lord over my heart Lord over everything that I no longer own anything but he owns it all he's the one that gave us life why don't we let Jesus take our life the Jesus our matters is more than what we would say is a watered-down Jesus or other Jesus the Jesus on that is a healer the Jesus I met as a way maker the Jesus I met the first day I met him he was a promise keeper and every day since he's a promise keeper he's a provider he's a deliverer he's an aunt I'm God he's awesome he's mighty he's powerful that's the Jesus I know I don't know where Jesus that gives up but I know it's Jesus they keeps pushing on and I know that this Jesus will do the work that we've asked him to do to me sure the world may look and they may see a different Ron Spencer and maybe what they seen a few months ago but I've seen a preacher today a gospel preacher that squared down and rolled his shoulders back and preached to you that one of the deepest sermons you ever hear whether Ron kept saying it's simple but there will be people that walk out of the service as sure as I'm standing here that we'll miss what were their own priests today who is Jesus who is Jesus dude there's one statement that brother branham makes that to me it's probably one of my most favorite statements he said what makes him God to me is that he came from the highest and he went to the lowest but he came to me oh what a wonderful day it is to serve our Lord Jesus ain't God good is he God to you a man is good is he God to you today do you love him today will you make him your Lord of all maybe we we sing that song you deserve the glory you deserve the honor we will dismiss you as we said we will dismiss you from the back roads to the to the front and the bridge deacons and the ushers will dismiss you so thank you for being than this service today I trust we don't have to have too many more services like in this matter but we'll do what we need to do to have Church you don't mind just dismissing in reverence and respect and may God richly bless you in every way that he can you deserve the glory [Music] and the odd [Applause] lift our hands to worship as we praise your home here deserve the glory and be honored we lift our hands to worship as we praise your Holy Name pre-war grade to miracle so great there is no one else like there is no one else like it for you are great do to me
