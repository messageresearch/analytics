[48:03] paul that's a it's a true statement
[48:06] amen something came to my heart this
[48:09] week and
[48:10] i whenever the lord kind of speaks
[48:12] something to your heart you
[48:14] you just you just say well
[48:17] i i was preparing for funeral service
[48:19] and i just just spoke a few minutes on
[48:22] it
[48:22] and i knew it was more than just for a
[48:24] funeral service so i'd like to speak to
[48:26] you this morning
[48:27] maybe for a short time with my energies
[48:29] i'd like to speak to you on
[48:31] he cares he cares
[48:34] if you will turn with me in your
[48:35] scriptures to hebrews chapter 2
[48:38] and verse 1.
[48:44] i'd like to just set the scene just for
[48:46] a moment brother branham is going to
[48:48] walk to the pulpit
[48:50] and he's going to speak a sermon and i'd
[48:52] like for you to listen to it this week
[48:53] if you could
[48:54] if you could remember to do it you know
[48:57] in your daily activities
[48:58] he speaks a sermon on he cares
[49:02] do you care and he's going to take it at
[49:06] a different angle than even i'm going to
[49:08] take it this morning but
[49:10] he speaks a sermon to the layout of seen
[49:13] age
[49:15] christ has come in this age
[49:19] there's a new administration that is
[49:21] going on we've had reformers all down
[49:23] through the ages
[49:24] and now god has sent a prophet and
[49:27] brother branham will take the time to
[49:29] tell us that
[49:30] billy graham is on the scene he's not
[49:33] going to do it in this service but he's
[49:34] taking the time billy graham is on the
[49:36] scene
[49:37] six letters and he will he will spell
[49:39] out his name
[49:41] and and he'll take his time wanting
[49:44] people to get it
[49:47] if you can just get it sometimes we set
[49:49] it even in a service like today and we
[49:52] we let it just go through us and we
[49:53] think well it was sunday morning
[49:55] but did you get it
[49:58] did you get what the thought was the
[50:00] theme thought of it
[50:01] brother branham walks through the pulpit
[50:03] and for probably for many of those
[50:05] people that were there that
[50:07] morning they they thought well this is
[50:09] just another service brother branham is
[50:11] in his own simple way
[50:16] and they called him too simple
[50:19] but in his simple way he was telling
[50:21] them
[50:22] god cared enough about this generation
[50:26] to come himself
[50:30] i've said a whole lot in that mouthful
[50:33] god
[50:33] cared enough about this generation
[50:36] to come himself
[50:40] now i want to say it to you he cared
[50:42] enough about
[50:43] you where was you at stephen
[50:48] where were you at paul where were you at
[50:51] brother hill where were you at god cared
[50:54] about you
[50:58] not a president not some dictator
[51:02] somewhere another
[51:04] but god cared about you
[51:13] we could dismiss already now i want you
[51:16] to watch the scripture that he takes for
[51:18] a text
[51:20] and then we'll go to another scripture
[51:24] therefore we ought to give the more
[51:25] earnest heed to
[51:27] to the things which we have heard
[51:32] lest at any time we should let them slip
[51:36] for if the word spoken by angels was
[51:39] steadfast
[51:41] and every transgression and disobedience
[51:43] received a just
[51:45] recompense of reward how shall we
[51:48] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[51:52] which at first began to be spoken by the
[51:55] by the lord and confirmed unto us by
[51:58] them
[51:59] which heard him god also
[52:02] bearing them witness both with signs and
[52:06] wonders and divers miracles
[52:08] and gift of the holy ghost according
[52:12] to his own will
[52:16] not your will thank you lord
[52:19] his will you can be seated
[52:29] i don't think david could have put it
[52:30] any better
[52:32] i think he describes every one of us if
[52:35] you're a christian and you've had some
[52:36] good days and you've had some difficult
[52:38] days
[52:40] i want you to just take this to heart
[52:42] this morning you've heard it before
[52:44] you've read it before
[52:45] but i want you to just take it to heart
[52:48] in psalms 139 and verse 1
[52:54] oh lord thou has searcheth me
[52:59] and known me thou knowest my down
[53:03] setting
[53:04] mine up arising thou
[53:07] understandeth my thought afar off
[53:13] he understands things about us that we
[53:15] don't understand
[53:20] i think that scripture is so complex
[53:23] we'll never
[53:23] understand it thou compasseth my path
[53:29] and my lying down and art
[53:33] acquainted with all my ways
[53:37] [Applause]
[53:39] now this is the god that watches over
[53:42] the universes
[53:45] and they say there's about 70 universes
[53:49] with 70 sons like the one we have
[53:53] and in the ball this little old ball
[53:55] that we are on
[53:57] most of us will not do much traveling
[54:00] but we
[54:01] we won't we won't go over this earth too
[54:03] much
[54:05] and god is so concerned about
[54:09] even where we're at
[54:14] hallelujah you're acquainted with all my
[54:19] ways
[54:21] for there is not a not a word in my
[54:24] tongue but
[54:25] lo thou knowest it all together
[54:28] and that makes me want to have a prayer
[54:30] meeting right there
[54:34] thou hast beset me behind him before and
[54:36] laid thine hand upon me
[54:40] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[54:44] it is high and i cannot attain to it
[54:48] i just can't grasp everything that god
[54:50] thinks about me
[54:52] whether i go from thy spirit or whether
[54:55] shall i flee from thy
[54:57] presence if i send up into heaven
[55:00] thou art there if i make my bed in hell
[55:05] behold thou art there
[55:09] if i take the wings of the morning and
[55:11] dwell in the other most parts of the sea
[55:14] even there shall thy hand lead me and
[55:16] thy right hand shall hold me
[55:19] if i say surely darkness shall cover me
[55:21] even the night and the light about me
[55:24] yea the darkness hideth from me but the
[55:26] night shineth this day
[55:28] and the darkness and the light are both
[55:30] alike
[55:31] to thee for thou hast possessed my
[55:35] reigns
[55:37] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[55:40] i will praise thee for i am fearfully
[55:43] and wonderfully made
[55:47] you talking about a statement a
[55:49] predestination
[55:50] he knowed exactly what the bell of your
[55:54] life would need to sound like
[55:56] and he had every individual to marry
[55:59] all the way down so he could get you
[56:08] hallelujah my substance 15 my substance
[56:11] was not hid from thee
[56:13] when i was made and secretly crawl
[56:16] curiously
[56:16] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[56:19] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[56:21] being unperfect
[56:23] and in my book all the members were
[56:26] written
[56:27] which were incontinence were fashioned
[56:30] when as yet there was none of them
[56:34] how precious are thy thoughts unto me
[56:40] my god how
[56:43] great is the sum of them
[56:47] i'd like for us to read that verse
[56:49] together if we can
[56:51] how precious also are the thoughts
[56:55] unto me oh god how
[56:58] great is the sum of them
[57:03] well brother ron that doesn't seem too
[57:05] too much if he ever thought of you
[57:12] he ever thought of you you're as eternal
[57:16] as god is eternal
[57:22] hallelujah god's not in the forgetting
[57:25] business
[57:28] his eyes on the sparrow and he's
[57:30] watching over you
[57:34] listen to the prophet as he begins to
[57:36] say it in just a couple of
[57:38] quotations he said he said maybe the
[57:41] devil has caught you
[57:42] out somewhere and give you a disease or
[57:45] some sickness or
[57:46] your backslid or something like that but
[57:48] remember
[57:50] he climbed the ramparts of glory and
[57:53] setting on
[57:54] high and his eye is on the sparrow and i
[57:57] know he's watching over me
[58:01] he is from everlasting to everlasting
[58:06] god
[58:08] he steps up and he watches you he sees
[58:12] where you're at
[58:13] he knows that we're having this meeting
[58:15] tonight
[58:16] he knows how concerned each one of us
[58:19] are about
[58:20] he he knows your interest in him he
[58:23] knows your interest in the kingdom
[58:26] he knows where your heart is
[58:31] so he watches over his word
[58:36] he said oh cast your cares on him he
[58:38] cares for you
[58:41] he cares for you
[58:45] now we know he said let's let's just ask
[58:48] for a few minutes
[58:49] if he cares for us all right he cared
[58:52] for a leopard when he was on earth
[58:55] there said a leopard did you ever see a
[58:57] leopard he said
[58:58] he said i've seen many hug them in my
[59:00] arms and them
[59:01] white white with leprosy looks like a
[59:04] seed wart
[59:06] turned inside out he said sitting there
[59:08] nobody would touch them
[59:10] down with the slime and the dirt and the
[59:12] filth of the street
[59:14] about as low as you can get and
[59:16] everybody was afraid to get around them
[59:20] he was an outcast a cast away from
[59:22] society of the city
[59:24] from the society of the church from the
[59:26] society of
[59:27] everything that there was in the city
[59:30] and nobody wanted to touch them
[59:34] if they'd done anything they'd pitch
[59:36] them a piece of bread or
[59:38] let them get out and get it out of the
[59:40] dirt
[59:41] they wouldn't get near them but jesus
[59:44] cared for them and he walked right down
[59:48] with him and
[59:49] sat down and i can see him lay his hands
[59:51] upon them
[59:53] i will that thou be clean
[1:00:00] oh he cared when nobody else would care
[1:00:05] he cared when nobody else will care for
[1:00:10] you
[1:00:11] he still cares now let me just say this
[1:00:14] to you and this is my phrase to you now
[1:00:17] let me just say i don't care where
[1:00:18] you're at and what your situation is
[1:00:22] and don't and you may feel like there's
[1:00:24] nobody that loves you
[1:00:26] in the entire world but he cares
[1:00:33] are you with me brother on why hasn't
[1:00:35] the resurrection happened to the rapture
[1:00:37] he still cares there's people that he
[1:00:41] still
[1:00:42] cares there's people that he refuses to
[1:00:45] let go through the tribulation period
[1:00:48] he still cares
[1:00:54] hallelujah
[1:00:56] maybe some of them are your loved ones
[1:01:01] he still cares when you give
[1:01:04] up and others give up he still cares
[1:01:08] when you was a reject from society
[1:01:11] he still cared for you what others
[1:01:14] wouldn't have nothing to do with you
[1:01:16] he cares for you
[1:01:27] in the busyness of a day and you feel
[1:01:30] that warm presence sweep through the
[1:01:32] room
[1:01:35] you realize that you're not alone
[1:01:37] anymore
[1:01:40] you realize there's another individual
[1:01:42] in the room that's got
[1:01:43] every problem that you've got in control
[1:01:48] and he's there to give you the strength
[1:01:51] he's not gonna move your mountain he's
[1:01:53] gonna give you strength to climb
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:01:57] he's not gonna take your storm away he's
[1:02:00] gonna
[1:02:00] take you by the hand and walk across the
[1:02:04] water with you
[1:02:10] hallelujah
[1:02:13] he said now my question for us tonight
[1:02:15] is do you care
[1:02:18] we live in a generation that don't care
[1:02:20] anymore
[1:02:22] we live in a very unthankful generation
[1:02:26] a very unholy generation
[1:02:29] a very hand-out generation
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:38] with people that just plain don't care
[1:02:42] they don't care about them the society
[1:02:49] look around in america
[1:02:52] the riots that happened and burned down
[1:02:55] innocent people's homes
[1:02:58] destroyed innocent people's businesses
[1:03:01] that they spent their life
[1:03:04] building generations
[1:03:08] building and they just looted it
[1:03:11] and destroyed it
[1:03:14] humanity doesn't care anymore
[1:03:18] the drug world don't care anymore
[1:03:30] brother nathaniel they took me to the
[1:03:32] emergency room the other day
[1:03:36] and and our cancer doctor told us that
[1:03:40] all you did is you had a supernatural
[1:03:42] intervention
[1:03:45] and that was quite a statement from a
[1:03:47] doctor
[1:03:49] and i was having a heart attack and it
[1:03:52] was going on it was progressing
[1:03:55] and all of a sudden it just went
[1:03:58] it was just gone
[1:04:02] labs came back everything's good you can
[1:04:04] go home
[1:04:05] i'd like to went to eat but
[1:04:11] but nothing was open
[1:04:18] and so i was with the cancer doctors the
[1:04:20] other day and
[1:04:21] they asked me i said how was your
[1:04:24] experience well you know most of the
[1:04:26] time i'm very cordial
[1:04:29] i'm i don't try to complain
[1:04:33] but i said i said i'm kind of concerned
[1:04:38] i said i i'm i'm uh
[1:04:44] what am i looking for i'm a patient here
[1:04:47] with the cancer clinic
[1:04:50] i i have stage four
[1:04:55] and the head doctor was in my room 30
[1:04:58] seconds
[1:05:00] in the ring he was in my head my room 30
[1:05:06] seconds
[1:05:08] i said i'm concerned they don't care
[1:05:20] now now let's just think about this
[1:05:25] you're supposedly having a heart attack
[1:05:29] and the head doctor's only in your room
[1:05:31] 30 seconds
[1:05:34] and i looked at her and i said that's a
[1:05:36] failure
[1:05:38] you want me to fill out a survey paper
[1:05:41] i'm not gonna
[1:05:42] i'm not gonna fill it out
[1:05:47] i'm not gonna fill it out i don't want
[1:05:49] to see nobody lose their job
[1:05:51] but 30 seconds isn't enough time to say
[1:05:53] hello
[1:05:59] you know and we had a resident in three
[1:06:02] or four times
[1:06:03] but i brought my own personal doctor
[1:06:05] with me
[1:06:06] thank god for that thank god for people
[1:06:10] who do
[1:06:16] care
[1:06:21] i think about us as a body here
[1:06:25] and a body around the world and i hear
[1:06:28] about people
[1:06:29] passing for covet and things and how
[1:06:32] many prayers have came our way
[1:06:35] this week brother ray montgomery passed
[1:06:38] away and i knew him for many many many
[1:06:41] years and he was a horn player
[1:06:43] and he and his wife both were
[1:06:46] were musicians in their small church of
[1:06:49] about 15
[1:06:49] people and here he passes away
[1:06:54] sister blue a pastor's wife she passed
[1:06:58] away
[1:07:00] and this morning i i said i sent letters
[1:07:02] in their direction to
[1:07:04] to strengthen them because i've received
[1:07:07] a lot of letters
[1:07:10] through the last year i've received a
[1:07:11] lot of letters and i keep
[1:07:13] every card i keep every one
[1:07:16] they're starting to mount up but they
[1:07:17] keep every card because i care about
[1:07:20] people
[1:07:22] i care about you i pray a lot behind the
[1:07:25] scenes
[1:07:26] i pray when you when you send a request
[1:07:30] in
[1:07:30] i pray like it's me going through it
[1:07:36] are you with me brother branham said you
[1:07:38] got to step into that
[1:07:40] man's position to know how he feels
[1:07:43] so you can have compassion to pray for
[1:07:46] him
[1:07:49] so the question is asked he cares for
[1:07:52] you
[1:07:52] do you care
[1:07:58] churches on every corner but do they
[1:08:00] care
[1:08:04] you know that's that's that'll be for
[1:08:06] that's above my pay grade
[1:08:08] but let me just say this to you i want
[1:08:09] to be a church
[1:08:11] that cares i want to be a
[1:08:15] people that cares
[1:08:16] [Applause]
[1:08:22] you've heard me say this before
[1:08:26] i grew up in a a from a little bitty boy
[1:08:32] diapered in the message large
[1:08:36] churches large assembly
[1:08:40] a lot of preachers coming through
[1:08:44] a lot of men having a lot of great
[1:08:46] things to say
[1:08:48] but even as a little boy i could see who
[1:08:50] was real and who wasn't
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:56] and i wouldn't give you a nickel
[1:08:59] for for somebody that can quote the
[1:09:01] message all the way through
[1:09:04] and the bible all the way through and
[1:09:07] their tongue is like a
[1:09:08] silver sword
[1:09:12] and they're wearing a thousand dollar
[1:09:13] suit
[1:09:15] and they're they're all stuffed shirt
[1:09:17] better than anybody else
[1:09:19] i wouldn't give you a nickel for that
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:31] but i like a man of god when he walks
[1:09:34] out of the office
[1:09:35] you can feel the presence of god
[1:09:39] emulating through his life and he's
[1:09:42] humble with it and he would speak to the
[1:09:45] smallest child
[1:09:46] in the building
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:50] are you with me
[1:09:58] those two little boys right there are
[1:09:59] tithe payers right there there's two
[1:10:01] little guys right there

[1:12:12] little world i can be caring
[1:12:16] about the most
[1:12:19] things that i'll not touch very many
[1:12:21] times
[1:12:22] but i care about it can i tell you a
[1:12:25] story i don't want to get on too much
[1:12:26] storage to get
[1:12:28] brother gato and myself were getting on
[1:12:30] a train
[1:12:31] and there were two kids there were two
[1:12:35] kids and one of them is brother derek
[1:12:37] donaldson's grandson
[1:12:39] from new zealand and he had came to the
[1:12:42] meeting he heard i was speaking
[1:12:45] and his company had sent him locally to
[1:12:48] a training session and he had a weekend
[1:12:50] off so he came to the meeting
[1:12:52] and so he comes over the meeting he's
[1:12:54] backslidden and he comes to the meeting
[1:12:58] and i just spend a few moments with him
[1:12:59] because i know him
[1:13:01] and so in the meeting he gets a
[1:13:03] supernatural touch
[1:13:05] you know how that works and he gets a
[1:13:07] supernatural touch and here he is on the
[1:13:10] other side of the earth
[1:13:12] in a meeting in switzerland
[1:13:15] or in belgium and then there's a girl
[1:13:18] from arizona
[1:13:20] and she just felt impressed to go to
[1:13:24] this meeting
[1:13:27] and so she didn't take any friends and
[1:13:29] so she goes to this meeting
[1:13:31] and she's there and we all meet at the
[1:13:34] bus stop
[1:13:35] with brother guido and brother guido's
[1:13:38] there and here's these two kids and you
[1:13:39] can tell they hadn't spoke a word to
[1:13:41] each other
[1:13:43] not a work it was as though they had
[1:13:46] never met
[1:13:47] in their entire lives they've been in
[1:13:49] the same meeting together
[1:13:50] and i said have do you guys know each
[1:13:52] other's name
[1:13:54] no no no i've never met her and so

[1:14:03] depot and i said this is this is this is
[1:14:06] so and so and this is so and so
[1:14:08] so they introduce one another and so we
[1:14:11] go and we
[1:14:12] we walk about a mile to get on the train
[1:14:14] and we're all following guido's head
[1:14:18] and so it's just i've never been in that
[1:14:21] kind of a situation
[1:14:22] how many people was in a tunnel in my
[1:14:24] life and i'm thinking dear god just let
[1:14:26] me keep up with guido
[1:14:29] and so we get to the train and we get to
[1:14:31] the place to where we've got to get on

[1:15:43] sitting
[1:15:44] at the same seats on a train
[1:15:48] for they to discover who they are
[1:15:52] well that's just coincidental you want
[1:15:55] another story
[1:15:56] there's a man in germany and he's
[1:15:59] walking down the street and he looks
[1:16:01] over at a girl
[1:16:03] and he's and he sees something about her
[1:16:05] she's on the opposite side of the street
[1:16:09] and he sees her and she has an
[1:16:11] atmosphere about her
[1:16:12] and he says i'm going
[1:16:16] i want to and he actually tells his
[1:16:18] friend i'm going to marry a girl like
[1:16:19] her
[1:16:21] i'm going to marry that girl
[1:16:24] and the guy says you've never seen her
[1:16:27] before
[1:16:28] you've never met her before we're
[1:16:31] we're leaving the country war is going
[1:16:35] on
[1:16:39] well she she winds up in canada in a
[1:16:42] little bitty town
[1:16:47] because they have to vacate
[1:16:53] what are the chances he winds up after
[1:16:56] the war
[1:16:57] years later in the same little bitty
[1:17:00] town
[1:17:02] and he's walking down the street and he
[1:17:05] looks across the street
[1:17:10] and there she is this time he's not
[1:17:13] going to miss
[1:17:14] the program
[1:17:18] and across the street he goes
[1:17:25] and he goes and he meets her and she's a
[1:17:28] christian girl
[1:17:29] and she asked him if he was a christian
[1:17:32] he don't know anything about god
[1:17:34] well come to the house and she read him
[1:17:37] the bible
[1:17:38] that was their date
[1:17:42] and she read to him about prophets and
[1:17:44] scriptures and
[1:17:46] read to him and when she would finish
[1:17:48] reading he'd go home
[1:17:50] but something kept making him go back to
[1:17:53] the house
[1:17:54] over and over and over again
[1:17:57] and finally she says would you like to
[1:18:01] go to a meeting with me
[1:18:03] and so they go to a meeting
[1:18:07] and william branham is a speaker
[1:18:11] and so he takes his friend with him
[1:18:15] and they said in the meeting and he said
[1:18:18] when brother branham said
[1:18:20] good evening friends
[1:18:23] good evening let's pray
[1:18:27] he said he looked over at his friend and
[1:18:29] said
[1:18:30] this is a man like i've been listening
[1:18:32] to in the scriptures
[1:18:34] he's a prophet
[1:18:38] now listen this man never been in a
[1:18:42] church
[1:18:44] he'd never been in a message meeting and
[1:18:46] yet
[1:18:47] something inside of him
[1:18:51] responded to the
[1:18:54] first sentences of brother branham
[1:18:57] speaking
[1:18:58] and he said this man's a prophet
[1:19:03] it don't take you six weeks 10 years
[1:19:06] it just takes a moment
[1:19:10] hallelujah
[1:19:18] you say what does that have to do with
[1:19:20] he cares
[1:19:21] he watched over that seed
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:26] he watched over that life
[1:19:29] [Music]
[1:19:33] i think about brother meadows back here
[1:19:35] 1966 i may not have all the figures
[1:19:38] right
[1:19:39] but he thought he was at the end of his
[1:19:41] life maybe suicide was just right in
[1:19:43] front of him
[1:19:44] and god was dealing with him
[1:19:48] he didn't realize he'd be one of the
[1:19:50] pillars of this church
[1:19:52] his family would be one of the largest
[1:19:55] of this church
[1:19:56] and be the inner workings of the
[1:19:58] community of this
[1:19:59] church he didn't know nothing about me
[1:20:03] but his grandson would become my
[1:20:06] my son-in-law
[1:20:12] god would not let him commit suicide
[1:20:15] he had a work for him to do
[1:20:26] hallelujah sometimes we think when we're
[1:20:29] starting to get old
[1:20:31] think well there's nothing left for me
[1:20:33] to do let me just say this to you
[1:20:36] your prayers shake the kingdom of hell
[1:20:40] [Applause]
[1:20:45] and you may not be able to move your
[1:20:47] legs but you can talk to god
[1:20:49] [Applause]
[1:20:53] brother branham said god don't forget
[1:20:55] you
[1:20:56] he said you in those convalescent homes
[1:21:00] in those nursing homes he hasn't forgot
[1:21:03] about you
[1:21:13] there's a land beyond the river
[1:21:17] oh thank god there's a land beyond the
[1:21:20] river
[1:21:24] i'm not going to get to my text
[1:21:31] but how much has he cared about us
[1:21:37] how much has he cared about us as a body
[1:21:42] knowing what we were getting ready to go
[1:21:44] through last year at this time
[1:21:48] when sister suzanne she comes to our
[1:21:50] house to bring some desserts
[1:21:53] she walks in and i've got a place on my
[1:21:56] side that's
[1:21:57] heating up and swelling periodically and
[1:22:01] getting real hot and i said sister
[1:22:04] suzanne what do you think about this
[1:22:07] she said you need to go to the doctor
[1:22:11] right you need to go to the doctor
[1:22:17] we go the doctor
[1:22:22] i go to my family physician
[1:22:25] wonderful man
[1:22:29] and so he said we need to check your
[1:22:36] prostate
[1:22:39] he walks back in the room and he said
[1:22:42] ron i'm afraid i'm going to send you
[1:22:44] down a real dark road
[1:22:46] he said i'm really sorry so what do you
[1:22:50] think it is
[1:22:52] he said i think it's cancer he said but
[1:22:55] i can't tell you that
[1:22:56] but i think it's cancer
[1:22:59] he said i i would dare say it's not just
[1:23:02] worry
[1:23:05] but where he thought it was it wasn't
[1:23:09] so we go to this is okay
[1:23:15] so we go to after christmas we went to
[1:23:20] pigeon forge if you don't believe
[1:23:23] believers go to pigeon forge you
[1:23:25] probably don't enjoy this church
[1:23:30] so we go to pigeon forge and so we go to
[1:23:32] dollywood me and my
[1:23:34] family we we just took a little time
[1:23:35] away
[1:23:37] and we we had just eat beans and greens
[1:23:41] and and that's to me as good as a steak
[1:23:46] although if you take me out this evening
[1:23:48] maybe i'll choose a steak
[1:23:53] it's okay it's i'm going home but but
[1:23:58] we walk up the hill and the nurse calls
[1:24:01] me
[1:24:03] and she said ron we have
[1:24:06] we found some things
[1:24:10] and said we've got some news for you
[1:24:15] i didn't know what i was getting ready
[1:24:18] to get into
[1:24:20] amen you see but before it all started
[1:24:26] we were getting ready to have our
[1:24:27] christmas dinner
[1:24:29] and we're going to have it that evening
[1:24:33] and and i'm in my office and i'm just
[1:24:36] busy about life
[1:24:38] and the lord speaks to me
[1:24:41] if you will trust me i will use you like
[1:24:45] never before
[1:24:48] now you remember when brother branham
[1:24:52] prayed for that little girl in finland
[1:24:56] and he said he said they were taking me
[1:24:59] through the basement of the church
[1:25:01] and said she's an orphan and she steps
[1:25:04] out
[1:25:05] and she kisses his pocket
[1:25:13] she's an orphan she steps out and kisses
[1:25:16] his pocket
[1:25:18] and it made a huge impression on brother
[1:25:20] branham
[1:25:22] huge and they're kind of pushing him on
[1:25:26] and he's looking back at her
[1:25:31] can i just blend a couple stories here
[1:25:33] just for you
[1:25:35] there's a 14 year old girl named ruth
[1:25:40] which would later become biscuit
[1:25:43] and she's just in a little shotgun of a
[1:25:45] church
[1:25:47] and they're they're pressing brother
[1:25:48] branham out of the building and
[1:25:50] huge crowd and they're pressing him out
[1:25:52] of the building and she stuck behind the
[1:25:55] door
[1:25:56] and they're pressing him out of the
[1:25:57] building and said he just rolled his
[1:25:59] hand back like this right here
[1:26:02] and he pronounced a blessing on a 14
[1:26:05] year old
[1:26:06] ruth biscuit amen
[1:26:16] brother ryan's looking back at that
[1:26:18] little girl
[1:26:19] and he's thinking about her she's an
[1:26:22] orphan
[1:26:24] what will happen with her and she has a
[1:26:27] real need
[1:26:31] wasn't it interesting that god had made
[1:26:33] such a way
[1:26:34] that she would be in the prayer line
