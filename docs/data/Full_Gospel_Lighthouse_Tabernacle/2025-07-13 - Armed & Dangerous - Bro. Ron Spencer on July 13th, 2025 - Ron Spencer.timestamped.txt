[21:15] pray for them. Also, everyone that's
[21:18] dealing with cancer, fighting that,

[21:57] or Robbie Robby Turner. He had a stroke
[22:00] in May and because of previous problems
[22:03] with his knee
[22:06] now being inflamed with inflammation,
[22:08] it's making it hard to do therapy. He
[22:11] had a stroke about 10 weeks ago and is

[22:16] real touch, a miracle to get out of
[22:19] where he is as well. Amen. Just be
[22:22] remembering that. Sister Don McBride.
[22:25] Amen. I want to pray for Bobby Smith,
[22:27] Brother Josh Jones. ask us to remember
[22:29] him. He has a brain tumor and he has
[22:32] surgery on Tuesday. So remember those
[22:35] needs there. How many that would have an
[22:37] unspoken request? Say, "Lord, just pass
[22:39] by my way this morning." Amen. I'm going
[22:42] to ask brother Andrew if he would just
[22:43] come pray over these needs this morning.
[22:46] God bless you.
[22:50] Amen. Heavenly Father, we come before
[22:53] you, Lord Jesus. Lord, there's no God
[22:56] like our God. Lord Jesus, we just want
[22:59] to express, Father, how much that we
[23:00] love you. Lord, how great that you are,
[23:03] Lord. You created the worlds with the
[23:05] very breath of your lungs. Lord, you
[23:08] spoke the words. You said, "And let
[23:10] there be." And there was, Father. Lord,
[23:13] everything has to obey. Your
[23:14] commandments, oh God. The dust had to
[23:17] obey. The stardust had to obey. And it
[23:20] came into fruition. Father, we're your
[23:22] children, Lord. And we realize that you
[23:24] are the great Jehovah here in our midst,
[23:26] Lord. And you said where two or three
[23:28] are gathered in my name there you would
[23:30] be. Now Father we have gathered here
[23:32] tonight Lord today Lord Jesus binding
[23:35] our faith together in the spirit of
[23:37] unity Lord. We are centralizing Lord
[23:39] Jesus our attention Lord to these needs
[23:42] this morning. And we ask Lord that you
[23:44] would just take our faith oh God and
[23:46] brother Brandham would talk about it
[23:47] being the atomic bomb. It's greater than
[23:49] the atomic bomb. It's greater than this
[23:51] bomb and that bomb. Lord, I pray that
[23:53] you would take our faith of your beloved
[23:56] wife, Lord Jesus, and that you would
[23:58] just begin to move, Lord, upon these
[24:00] needs, Lord, for Bobby Smith, Lord, for
[24:03] this individual that's had in this spot
[24:04] of depression, oh God, for every cancer
[24:07] patient here. Lord, we have had a word
[24:10] in this generation, Lord, that not even
[24:12] cancer would be able to stand before our
[24:14] prayer, Father. Lord, you have
[24:16] challenged us to believe, Lord, like
[24:18] never before. And Lord, we just come to
[24:20] this moment in time and we are expecting
[24:22] you to do exceedingly abundantly above
[24:25] all that we could ever ask or think. And
[24:27] we just want to push back Satan this
[24:29] morning and say, "Satan, your hand has
[24:32] been upon us too much. It has gone too
[24:34] far. And we ask, oh God, that you would
[24:37] just come and renounce everything, Lord
[24:39] Jesus, that Satan has put against your
[24:42] children. Lord, we we we put a reproach
[24:45] against this enemy and say, "Satan, you
[24:47] take your leave from this body. Take
[24:49] your leave from this building. Take this
[24:51] leave from our minds, oh God, and make
[24:54] us to be liberated in your word, Father.
[24:57] May our faith exceed, Lord, our
[24:59] expectations this morning. Lord, may you
[25:02] just come on the mountaintop and prove
[25:04] that you're Jehovah Gyra. May you come
[25:06] on this hilltop and prove that you're
[25:08] Jehovah Shalom. May you come on this
[25:10] mountaintop here this morning and take
[25:13] us into the realm to believe for the
[25:15] impossibles. Lord, as brother Ron would
[25:17] come and minister the word today, we ask
[25:19] that you would use the man of God to
[25:22] speak directly to our needs. Father, no
[25:24] matter what level of sincerity that we
[25:27] are, no matter how deep that we've been
[25:29] in the message or how new we are to it,
[25:32] we ask God that you would speak to us,
[25:34] Lord, only as you would speak to us.
[25:37] Father, you know how to find us where we
[25:39] are. This service is yours today. We put
[25:41] it in your hands. We ask God that
[25:44] everything that'll be done and said here
[25:46] for your glory today that it would not
[25:48] be that it would not be unto men to
[25:51] please men, but it would be unto the
[25:53] most high God. So we invite you here
[25:55] this morning. We want you to feel
[25:57] welcome, Lord. We wash your feet with
[26:00] our tears and we dry it with our praise.
[26:02] Oh God, may you come amongst us in a
[26:04] very specific way. This day is a day
[26:07] that you've made so we will rejoice and
[26:10] be glad in it in Jesus name. Amen. And
[26:13] amen.
[26:16] Amen. Continue to play that for me if
[26:18] you don't mind. This morning we're going

[33:08] He's my comfort
[33:14] holds
[33:15] me close.
[33:19] [Music]
[33:23] Oh hallelu
[33:28] I am not
[33:32] alone.
[33:35] [Music]
[33:41] He's my comfort

[33:48] me close.
[33:50] [Music]
[33:56] [Applause]
[34:29] [Music]
[34:44] I remember
[34:47] how you provided,
[34:51] how you held me
[34:55] through the night.
[34:59] And I remember
[35:02] how you sustained me
[35:07] when you stepped in
[35:10] to save my life.
[35:14] If I knew then
[35:18] what I know now,
[35:22] I would be still
[35:24] and let you work it out.
[35:30] Jesus,
[35:33] I was toss in the water,
[35:37] but I never went under.
[35:41] You were always on time,
[35:46] Jesus.
[35:49] When I went through the fire,
[35:53] you were right there beside me. You were
[35:59] always on time.
[36:02] You were always
[36:07] always on time.
[36:10] You were always always
[36:16] on time.
[36:19] And I remember
[36:22] [Music]
[36:23] how you carried
[36:27] when I couldn't
[36:32] take a step.
[36:35] And I remember
[36:38] [Music]
[36:39] how you loved me
[36:43] when I could and
[36:47] love myself.
[36:52] Jesus,
[36:54] I was tossed in the water,
[36:57] [Music]
[36:58] but I never went under.
[37:02] You were always on time.
[37:07] And Jesus,
[37:10] when I went through the fire,
[37:13] [Music]
[37:14] you were right there beside me. You were
[37:20] always on time.
[37:23] You were always
[37:28] always on time.
[37:31] You were always
[37:34] always
[37:37] on time.
[37:39] And you were always always
[37:44] always on time.
[37:47] You were always always
[37:53] on time.
[37:58] There's never been a day, never been a
[38:02] minute, never been a moment that you
[38:05] weren't in it. There's never been a time
[38:08] that you didn't see me through God. So I

[38:57] So I worship you, Jesus.
[39:01] [Music]
[39:04] I was tossed in the water,
[39:07] but I never went under.
[39:11] You were always on time,
[39:16] Jesus.
[39:19] When I went through the fire,

[45:43] I worship you.
[45:48] Everybody's got their own reason, but

[45:54] way maker, miracle worker, promise
[46:00] keeper, light in the darkness.
[46:04] My God,
[46:06] that is who you are.
[46:10] [Music]
[46:13] Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[46:18] keeper, light in the darkness, my God.
[46:24] Oh, that is who you are calling.
[46:31] Away maker, a miracle worker, promise

[46:42] Oh, that is who you are.
[46:47] [Music]
[46:50] Even when I don't see it, you're
[46:53] working.
[46:54] Even when I don't feel it, you're
[46:57] working. You never stop. You never stop
[47:02] working. You never stop. You never stop
[47:06] working.
[47:08] Even when I don't see it, you're
[47:11] working.
[47:12] Even when I don't feel it, you're
[47:15] working. You never stop. You never stop
[47:20] working. You never stop. You never stop
[47:24] working.
[47:26] Even when I don't see it, you're
[47:29] working.
[47:30] Even when I don't feel it, you're
[47:33] working. You never stop.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; You never stop working. You never stop.
[47:46] You never stop working. You never stop.
[47:50] You never stop working. You never stop.
[47:54] You never stop working. You never stop.
[47:59] You never stop working.

[48:09] you're working. You never stop. You
[48:13] never stop working. You never stop. You
[48:17] never stop working.
[48:20] Way maker, miracle work,
[48:24] promise keeper,
[48:27] &gt;&gt; in the darkness,
[48:29] &gt;&gt; my God,
[48:33] &gt;&gt; you are.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; I want you to take a minute and I just
[48:35] want you to begin to thank the Lord for
[48:38] right here in this place for him coming
[48:40] and filling this atmosphere with his
[48:42] presence. I want you to lift your voice.
[48:45] [Music]
[48:48] I want you to think
[48:50] there was a lot of people sometimes that
[48:52] had saw a lot of rainbows,
[48:56] but when they read the scripture why God
[48:58] put the rainbow in the sky, it meant
[49:00] something different to him.
[49:02] [Music]
[49:03] you know why God has done what he's done
[49:05] for you in your life
[49:08] and you've read the scripture about it.
[49:10] It gives you a different meaning than it
[49:12] does to the people that just see the
[49:13] different things going on out there in
[49:14] the world. They see it just as normal
[49:17] circumstances or daily life. But because
[49:20] you are who you are, you see it through
[49:22] the lens of the word. So through that
[49:25] lens, I want you to praise God for what
[49:27] he is to you right now.
[49:29] [Music]
[49:32] I want to ask you as Bible believers, is
[49:34] he a way maker to you? Is he a miracle
[49:38] worker to you through the lens of his
[49:40] word? Is he a promisekeeper to you? Has
[49:43] he been a light in the darkness to you?
[49:46] Is he your God this morning?
[49:49] &gt;&gt; I know he was Sister Mary Morris's God
[49:51] yesterday, but whose God is he today? I
[49:55] say he's my God. I say he's a mighty
[49:58] God. I say he's more than able. I say
[50:01] he's a promisekeeper. I say he's a way
[50:04] maker. I say he's my God. In the midst
[50:07] of my trial, in the midst of my chaos,
[50:09] in the midst of my despair, in the midst
[50:12] of my criticism, in the midst of the
[50:14] shadow of the valley, I realize he is my
[50:17] light.
[50:19] Can you worship that kind of a God
[50:21] through the lens of his word? As brother
[50:23] Ron comes this morning, I want you to
[50:26] lift your voice. I want you to make your
[50:28] declarations very clear this morning
[50:31] that God, I need you this morning to
[50:34] speak to me live to ear that I'll know
[50:36] that it was Jehovah.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; My God, that is who you are.
[50:47] Oh,
[50:50] way maker, miracle worker, promise
[50:55] keeper, hide in the darkness.
[50:59] My God,
[51:01] that is
[51:05] [Music]
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that is who he is?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; And you know him that way. Amen. God
[51:15] bless you this morning. So good to see
[51:17] each and every one of you. And
[51:20] &gt;&gt; have you come to have church?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Have you
[51:28] come to have church?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Won't you tell your neighbor this
[51:33] morning, I have come to have church?
[51:43] Hallelujah.
[51:45] Hallelujah.
[51:47] Hallelujah.
[51:51] You see, we don't know what tomorrow
[51:52] holds or the next week holds,
[51:56] but God does.
[51:59] And we have a God that's always on time.
[52:03] So, he feeds you in the word, preparing
[52:06] you for the battle that you're getting
[52:08] ready. God is never reactive. He's
[52:12] always proactive.
[52:14] He's always ahead of your battle getting
[52:17] you ready for it. And so,
[52:20] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We love the Lord. And
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I just share something with you was on
[52:25] my heart this morning.
[52:30] Many years ago, I sat in your seats.
[52:34] And I always came to church thinking,
[52:38] God, I want you to speak to me.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. There may be hundreds of people
[52:43] here, but I want you to come to my pew.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; And speak to my heart today.
[52:50] Our prophet would speak to us and tell
[52:52] us that you pull
[52:54] on the gift of God
[52:57] &gt;&gt; and God will come to exactly where
[52:59] you're at.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; You know, if you walk out of service and
[53:04] say, "I didn't get nothing." It's
[53:06] nobody's fault but yours.
[53:12] Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to carnally compare this,
[53:16] but many of us go to Costco for $20 item
[53:22] and walk out with $300 in our
[53:29] &gt;&gt; need may have been this small this
[53:30] morning when you walked in, but won't
[53:33] you walk out of here?
[53:43] Hallelujah.
[53:45] He's that kind of a God.
[53:47] Amen. Didn't you enjoy last night?
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I just I just thought it was just a tots
[53:53] and so we certainly love Brother Nathan,
[53:57] his family, his church, Brother Wayne,
[54:00] and all of them. Please tell them all
[54:02] hello. I thought last night's message
[54:05] was just absolutely great. He shared
[54:07] with something with us last night and it
[54:09] was he had did some research. He went to
[54:11] where Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1963. His
[54:16] grandfather was in a meeting and then he
[54:19] was also in the meeting with brother
[54:20] Brandham. He shared with us a picture
[54:23] last night of of his grandfather,
[54:26] Brother Samuel,
[54:27] introducing Brother Brandham to the pull
[54:29] pit. And brother Brandham is coming to
[54:32] speak. And I would say that's probably
[54:34] one of the greatest honors that he ever
[54:36] had. And he called him the one of the
[54:38] greatest preachers that ever lived since
[54:40] Jesus Christ. I'd say that was accurate
[54:42] as well.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:45] And then he introduced brother Brandham.
[54:49] And here's his grandson along with
[54:51] brother Ray's grandson
[54:54] standing and speaking what the prophet
[54:56] spoke. And so we're so honored to have
[55:00] brother Nathan with us. And uh
[55:03] I I feel like a little boy when I stand
[55:05] beside of him. And
[55:09] I
[55:12] Amen. He's just a great speaker. And so
[55:15] we thank the Lord for what God is doing
[55:16] in his lives. And want to continue to
[55:19] remember Sister Mary that God would be
[55:21] with her as she has had this bike wreck.
[55:24] And and so if you ride bikes, you'll
[55:27] eventually have a wreck. And so we just
[55:29] pray that God would just be with her
[55:31] during this time and and uh just pray
[55:34] that God would be with the entire
[55:35] family. I quit riding bikes because I
[55:39] I got hit by a car and uh and so I quit.
[55:45] My wife don't know it today, but they
[55:48] had paved Port Republic Road. It was a
[55:50] new paving project that had just been
[55:52] happening. So, the pavement was on the
[55:55] side was too tall and I slipped off of
[55:57] that pavement when cars were passing me
[55:59] and my my bike flipped me out in the
[56:01] road and an elderly woman got stopped in
[56:05] time until her her her
[56:10] car was right against my back and it
[56:14] flipped the bike out of the road. And
[56:17] so, I hid her license plate and God was
[56:21] just rich in mercy. And so
[56:24] I I told that little lady, she was
[56:28] probably she was probably in her 80s,
[56:30] and I told her, I said, "Well," she
[56:32] said, "I've witnessed a miracle." I
[56:34] said, "You're not only going to witness
[56:35] a miracle, but when I take this bike
[56:37] home, I'm going to hang it up, and I'm
[56:40] never going to ride it again." So, and I
[56:43] have been as good as my promise. And so,
[56:46] if Mr. If Sister Mary is uh watching
[56:48] today,
[56:50] hang that back up,
[56:54] man. Amen. We're also thankful for for
[56:59] brother Jeff's report.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; They did the biopsy this week and they
[57:04] had told him that he only had a matter
[57:05] of time if it was cancer on his liver.
[57:09] There's a spot of cancer on his pancreas
[57:11] that they're going to work on. And so,
[57:13] but if it's on your liver, we're that
[57:15] they gave him no hope. And so, they went
[57:18] this week with the biopsy on his liver
[57:21] and it was zero cancer. And so, we thank
[57:24] God for that. We thank God for that.
[57:36] So, he's got a lot more days to be
[57:38] grandpa. And so, we thank the Lord for
[57:41] that. When you get those kind of
[57:42] reports, they're your life and death.
[57:45] And so we thank God for life. Amen. I go
[57:49] tomorrow to the cancer center and to see
[57:51] all my cancer team. So you if you'll
[57:53] please remember us in prayer that God
[57:55] would just continue the process and be
[57:57] with us. And so for those that don't
[57:59] know, we continue the chemotherapy every
[58:02] day. Some days it makes me some sick,
[58:04] some days it don't. Some days it makes
[58:06] me tired, some days it don't. But you
[58:08] know, I got a good nurse. And so we just
[58:10] thank the Lord for that too. I'd like to
[58:12] speak to you today on armed and
[58:15] dangerous.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think I'm preaching to the right
[58:21] audience. And so
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:25] Amen. If you will turn with me to
[58:27] Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. Then
[58:30] I've got a few scriptures I'm going to
[58:31] quote pretty quickly and so but we'll
[58:34] start with Philippians chapter 4 and
[58:36] verse 13. And I want you to read this
[58:39] scripture with me today.
[58:42] You said you was ready to have church,
[58:44] so let's do it.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] Hey, I heard myself in the in the sermon
[58:52] last night.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; And it was pretty interesting.
[58:57] I was in a lone ranger
[59:01] and uh he said, you know, he asked his
[59:03] dad, "Dad, he's in trouble. He's in the
[59:05] third chapter. He's in trouble." He
[59:06] said, "Well, he's going to be in the
[59:07] sixth chapter, so he's going to be all
[59:09] right." So, I heard myself in the sixth
[59:11] chapter last night. And so,
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We may be in the third, but we'll
[59:16] be in the sixth. So, thank you. Thank
[59:18] you, brother Nathan. Philippians chapter
[59:20] 4 and verse 13. Let's all read this
[59:23] scripture together. I can do all things
[59:27] through Christ which strengthen me. May
[59:31] the Lord bless the reading of his word.
[59:32] You may be seated.
[59:35] 1 Coronicles chapter 16 and verse 11.
[59:39] Seek ye the Lord and his strength.
[59:44] Seek his face continually.
[59:48] This this scripture was quoted last
[59:50] night, was already in my notes. So, here
[59:51] we are. Isaiah 40:41 and verse 10. Fear
[59:56] thou not, for I am with thee.
[1:00:02] I love that. Fear thou not, for I am
[1:00:05] with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy
[1:00:08] God. I will strengthen thee. Yay, I will
[1:00:12] help thee. Yay, I will uphold thee with
[1:00:15] the right hand of my righteousness.
[1:00:18] These are your promises.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; This is God's love letter to you. I want
[1:00:24] you to read this like your girlfriend
[1:00:26] wrote it to you.
[1:00:32] boyfriend wrote it to you. I'll get I'll
[1:00:35] get you there. Isaiah 41 and verse 10.
[1:00:37] Let's read it. Fear thou not, for I am
[1:00:41] with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy
[1:00:44] God. I will strengthen thee. Yay, I will
[1:00:48] help thee. Yay, I will open uphold thee
[1:00:52] with the right hand of my righteousness.
[1:00:55] Amen.
[1:00:58] I want you to remember God's words never
[1:01:00] has an end to it. That's right.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; It's not like your milk. It's not like
[1:01:05] your eggs
[1:01:07] that have expiration dates.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Words have power.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; They have incredible potential for them.
[1:01:16] These words were given to you as a
[1:01:18] believer. And the most supernatural
[1:01:20] thing about you is your tongue. Right.
[1:01:22] That's right.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; And when you take this word into your
[1:01:26] heart, life and death is in your tongue.
[1:01:28] And when you quote these words back to
[1:01:30] God,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; notice what the scripture Isaiah 40:31
[1:01:35] says. But they that wait upon the Lord,
[1:01:39] they shall renew their strength.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; They shall mount up on wings as an
[1:01:44] eagle. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:01:47] They shall walk and not faint. Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Psalms 73 and verse 26. My flesh and my
[1:01:57] heart faileth, but my God is the
[1:02:01] strength of my heart and my portion
[1:02:06] forever.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; God's word's eternal.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; His thoughts is the weapons of our
[1:02:14] warfare.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; We're here to wage war. Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; We are Satan's worst nightmare.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me how bad the devil is.
[1:02:26] You're greater than him.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Don't make him bigger.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't David that went down off of a
[1:02:34] hill measuring Goliath. Goliath told us
[1:02:37] how big he was.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter how big the devil is.
[1:02:43] You're greater.
[1:02:46] Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Because greater is he that is in you.
[1:02:50] I'm not talking about you. Your flesh is
[1:02:52] greater. But the seed of God that's on
[1:02:54] the inside of you that God deposited
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; It wasn't your choice. It was God's
[1:03:07] choice.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And you as eternal as God is eternal. So
[1:03:11] no matter how bad your battle is, you're
[1:03:14] going to make it.
[1:03:15] Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. We're commissioned.
[1:03:19] We're commissioned and we have
[1:03:21] authority. Brother Brandon would explain
[1:03:23] to us authority greater than the angels
[1:03:27] that are in heaven.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus,
[1:03:35] you have power to bind and loose devils.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We're amening.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Everybody ought to be amening right
[1:03:47] here.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; These are your promises. So instead of
[1:03:51] binding and loosening devils, stop
[1:03:54] complaining.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Stop whining.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. This is only the
[1:04:04] beginning here.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Stop complaining.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Stop dealing with the devil credit.
[1:04:10] Don't get up before your neighbors, say,
[1:04:12] "Oh, how bad the devil's been to you."
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Start talking about how great God is.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, what do I do when I
[1:04:26] explain how mean the devil is and how
[1:04:28] bad it's been this week? You're only
[1:04:30] giving him a testimony. That's right.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; You're only giving him a voice.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; That he's had power in your life.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it how it is. You're
[1:04:44] explaining that the devil that has
[1:04:46] fought you this week is greater than the
[1:04:48] power of the angels that are in in
[1:04:50] heaven. I got news for you. I got new no
[1:04:53] sympathy for none of that.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; So she we should walk in victory. Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; We should talk in victory.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; We should think in victory.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; There should never be a spot to where we
[1:05:09] give up.
[1:05:10] [Applause]
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Many years ago, I saw a t-shirt.
[1:05:19] I've came to the end of my rope and I've
[1:05:22] tied a knot and I'm hanging on. Well, I
[1:05:24] got news for you. If that is how you're
[1:05:26] doing, you're in trouble.
[1:05:29] If you're hanging on with your human
[1:05:31] flesh,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; you're absolutely in trouble.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But I found out a long time ago, it
[1:05:38] isn't me that's hanging on.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Help me preach. It is not me that's
[1:05:45] hanging on.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; It is not how my feelings are this week.
[1:05:53] It's not where I'm having a great
[1:05:55] sunshiny week or or great gloomy week.
[1:05:59] It isn't me hanging on.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; It's God that's hanging on to us.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; I've got a news bulletin for you this
[1:06:13] morning. God answers your prayer,
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; but you have to pray them.
[1:06:20] Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; God answers your prayer,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; but you have to pray them first,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But I can't get my prayers
[1:06:30] answered. Are you praying them?
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to get that one.
[1:06:44] You got to pray the prayer. That's
[1:06:47] right.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Spend time in your prayer instead of
[1:06:52] begging God. Just tell him what you need
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; and start thanking him for what he has
[1:06:59] done. He is doing and is going to do.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Thank him that he made you in his plans.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; You ought to be able to shout. And we
[1:07:13] ain't even got started yet.
[1:07:15] I want you to understand many years ago
[1:07:17] there was a man that wrote a books on
[1:07:19] power of positive thinking. You know
[1:07:21] that wasn't the message but it is the
[1:07:23] message.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; You need to think positive.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; You need to talk p positive.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? Brother said
[1:07:34] never let a negative word go through
[1:07:36] your mind.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Sure. This is our mortal life and this
[1:07:40] is where character is going to be built
[1:07:42] at. You're going to go through brother
[1:07:45] Bram said God doesn't just stick you
[1:07:47] through a pipe. You come out on the
[1:07:48] other end. That ain't how it happens.
[1:07:50] This is where character is molded.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; But listen, if you can read the book and
[1:07:56] says, "I'm going to win."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; And you get struck by cancer, you're
[1:08:02] going to win.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; You got a headache today, you're going
[1:08:06] to live. Are you with me now?
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; My leg hurts. I don't know how I'm going
[1:08:10] to make it. You're going to make it to
[1:08:12] tomorrow.
[1:08:13] You're in chapter six.
[1:08:16] [Applause]
[1:08:29] Maybe you're watching this and you're
[1:08:31] right at the point of death. You still
[1:08:33] went.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; The doctors come in and said, "That's
[1:08:37] all I can do for you." You still went
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; cuz there's another physician that's
[1:08:41] coming to see you.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; He's coming to see you. Are you with me
[1:08:48] now? He doesn't have an inoculation or
[1:08:51] some woo on you. God has the answer.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; You step from this body to a brand new
[1:09:01] body.
[1:09:03] This is a powerful quote to start out
[1:09:05] with. When the weakest
[1:09:09] of saints go on their knees,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; what a power and privilege has been
[1:09:15] given to the church of the living God.
[1:09:18] When you fall to your knees in prayer,
[1:09:23] even devils tremble.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. So the
[1:09:33] enemy that's been telling you you're
[1:09:34] nothing, nobody loves you, you're the
[1:09:37] weakest in this church,
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; cuz he tells you those things.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to just to be remembered
[1:09:48] right now. You when you pray shake hell.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; That's not an Elvis Presley song. That's
[1:09:58] a promise by a prophet of God. You shake
[1:10:01] hell.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; When he took Jesus upon the mountain and
[1:10:09] he set him down,
[1:10:12] Jesus rebuked him again with the word,
[1:10:15] he defeated Satan with the word of God.
[1:10:19] Now watch this. showing that the weakest
[1:10:22] of Christian
[1:10:24] can defeat Satan with thus sayaeth the
[1:10:28] Lord.
[1:10:30] It is written, it is written.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, he says, God will
[1:10:38] never give you a promise
[1:10:41] unless first there is a deposit for it.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave. A good man
[1:10:48] wouldn't give you a check with no money
[1:10:51] in the bank.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; An honest man wouldn't. Well, God won't
[1:10:57] give you his check for salvation or
[1:11:01] healing unless there is a deposit for
[1:11:04] it.
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:13] And God's, don't take this wrong, God's
[1:11:15] not an Indian giver.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Don't get racial on me. God's not
[1:11:22] someone that gives it to you and then
[1:11:24] takes it back.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; God gives it to you and it's yours.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; So, he gives you salvation and he's not
[1:11:33] going to decide 10 years later, I'm
[1:11:34] going to take that back.
[1:11:42] God promised Abraham, "I'm going to give
[1:11:44] you a child."
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; That's all he had to have. And that
[1:11:47] settled it.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; God told you that you're going to be in
[1:11:50] a rapture. That settles it.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave up here. Come on.
[1:11:59] You don't have to behave back there. I'm
[1:12:01] giving you permission.
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:05] [Applause]
[1:12:07] If God made a promise, God gave the
[1:12:09] promise and you just believe it.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; I don't care what takes place. It's
[1:12:14] yours.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Fight the devil over every ounce of
[1:12:17] ground that he stands. He set stands on.
[1:12:20] Walk over it. Take it.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Take the sword of the word.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. God's promises is true.
[1:12:32] Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop them.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; They're God's promise. And he gives us
[1:12:39] the promise of that just like he did to
[1:12:43] the children of Israel.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal church has come to their
[1:12:50] Kadesh Barnea. And we are able. We can
[1:12:53] do it. Jesus Christ is the same
[1:12:56] yesterday,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; today
[1:13:02] and forever.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; I hear people say, "Well, you ought to
[1:13:09] have been here 15, 20 years ago, 30
[1:13:11] years ago, 40 years ago. We really had a
[1:13:13] meeting." What about tonight?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Sure, God was with us 40 years ago.
[1:13:20] Sure, we had a prophet just right down
[1:13:21] the street in 1958. But listen, that
[1:13:24] same God,
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; that same God is here with us right now.
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we miss things because we're
[1:13:47] looking for something. You ever talk to
[1:13:49] somebody that's always looking over your
[1:13:50] shoulder?
[1:13:56] I'm going to give you a little clue in
[1:13:57] life. If somebody's always looking over
[1:14:00] your shoulder, you're not important
[1:14:02] enough to spend a conversation with
[1:14:04] them.
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And so when somebody's looking over my
[1:14:09] shoulder, I simply walk away.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Why, brother Ron? They're not taking the
[1:14:17] conversation personal, and I'm not the
[1:14:20] important person that they're wanting to
[1:14:22] see. So I just simply walk away.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; That's why when I go on my knees,
[1:14:37] I'm not thinking about Walt Disney.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to God.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And God is first place in my life.
[1:14:48] Listen, God does not like yard sale
[1:14:50] stuff that you want to give him. He
[1:14:52] wants first place.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, this is this is it. This is it.
[1:14:58] Now, I want you to just think a couple
[1:15:00] of I want to I want to give you a couple
[1:15:02] powerful theme thoughts from the first
[1:15:05] church messenger Paul. And he writes it.
[1:15:08] This is the adoption chapter of the
[1:15:10] Bible in Ephesians. Let's go to
[1:15:11] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10.
[1:15:13] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[1:15:17] Lord
[1:15:18] and in the power of his might.
[1:15:22] Notice what he does. Put on the whole
[1:15:24] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:15:25] stand against the ws of the devil.
[1:15:30] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:15:32] blood, but against principalities,
[1:15:34] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:15:36] the darkness of this world, and against
[1:15:38] spiritual wickedness
[1:15:40] in high places. Wherefore take unto you
[1:15:43] the whole armor of God that you may be
[1:15:45] able to be able to withstand in the evil
[1:15:47] day and having done all to stand.
[1:15:52] stand.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, having your loins
[1:15:56] girded about with truth, and having on
[1:15:58] the breastplate of the righteousness,
[1:16:00] and your feet shot with the preparation
[1:16:02] of the gospel of peace,
[1:16:06] and above all taking the shield of
[1:16:07] faith, wherewith you may be able to
[1:16:10] quench all the fiery darts of the
[1:16:12] wicked, and take the helmet of
[1:16:14] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[1:16:16] which is the word of the of God, praying
[1:16:19] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:16:22] in the spirit, watching there into with
[1:16:25] all perseverance and supplication for
[1:16:28] all saints.
[1:16:32] Now, I want you to just notice Paul is
[1:16:34] writing this with inspiration.
[1:16:38] And it's a battle armor that he's got
[1:16:40] on. So, if we could look at history
[1:16:43] where Paul was when he's writing this,
[1:16:47] he is in a Roman dungeon.
[1:16:51] So the guy that is chained to him has
[1:16:54] got all of this armor on
[1:16:57] cuz Paul is a dangerous criminal
[1:17:02] cuz he's shaking hell.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And listen, those soldiers fought to be
[1:17:08] able to guard Paul. He must have had a
[1:17:11] presence around him that they just
[1:17:13] wanted to be on.
[1:17:15] Maybe they was as tall as that guy, as
[1:17:18] strong as brother Denny.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But they were standing there and they
[1:17:23] were guarding hanging on his helmet. And
[1:17:25] Paul was saying, "I'm going to take that
[1:17:26] and make a sermon out of it."
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's going to be believers down
[1:17:30] in the dark ages going to need this.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; There's going to be leotysan believers
[1:17:35] that are going to need this.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Put on your shield. Put on your helmet.
[1:17:41] Grab a hold of your sword.
[1:17:44] And prayer is an atomic bomb. Use it.
[1:17:48] [Music]
[1:17:50] [Applause]
[1:17:55] Okay.
[1:17:57] So,
[1:18:00] Brother Brandham is going to preach on
[1:18:01] the rapture.
[1:18:04] Of all the scriptures
[1:18:06] that he picks, he's going to pick this
[1:18:08] one. Psalms chapter 27 and verse one.
[1:18:15] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[1:18:20] Whom shall I fear?
[1:18:25] Fear is mentioned 600 times in the
[1:18:26] scripture. So it's a real thing. But for
[1:18:30] a believer,
[1:18:34] it don't matter.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord is the strength of my life. Of
[1:18:40] whom shall I be afraid? He's literally
[1:18:43] making fun of the devil.
[1:18:47] He's telling him, "I don't have to fear
[1:18:50] you.
[1:18:52] I don't have to be afraid of you. When
[1:18:55] the wicked, even mine enemies and my
[1:18:56] foes came up onto me to eat up my flesh,
[1:18:59] they stumbled and fell. Though a host
[1:19:02] should encamp against me, my heart shall
[1:19:04] not fear. Though war should rise against
[1:19:06] me, and this will I be confident. One
[1:19:08] thing that I have desired of the Lord,
[1:19:09] that will I seek after, that I may dwell
[1:19:12] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[1:19:15] my life.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; To behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:19:19] inquire in his temple.
[1:19:23] David is right. No matter what trials I
[1:19:27] come up against, I'm going to still go
[1:19:29] to church.
[1:19:42] But the devil will turn that on you. But
[1:19:45] you don't quit Walmart.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Well, they're all a bunch of hypocrites
[1:19:50] there at church. You don't quit Walmart.
[1:19:52] You don't quit Kroger's.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; And I got news for you. We are not a
[1:19:58] congregation of angels. We are a
[1:20:00] congregation of believers.
[1:20:02] We all have a history here. News
[1:20:06] bulletin. We are all saved by the grace
[1:20:09] of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:14] Glory.
[1:20:16] Glory.
[1:20:22] Hang your wings in the wing closet.
[1:20:28] Take your halo off and hang it up back
[1:20:30] there. We are all
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; saved by the grace of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Verse five, before I get in too much
[1:20:45] trouble. For in the time of trouble,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; cuz it's going to come, baby. For in the
[1:20:51] time of trouble, he shall hide me in his
[1:20:53] pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:20:55] tabernacle shall he hide me, and he
[1:20:56] shall set me upon a rock. And now shall
[1:20:59] my head be lifted up above mine enemies,
[1:21:01] and roundabout thereof. Thereof will I
[1:21:03] will offer up in his tabernacle
[1:21:05] sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay, I
[1:21:08] will sing praises unto God. Unto the
[1:21:11] Lord. Here, oh Lord, when I cry with my
[1:21:15] voice.
[1:21:17] Those that don't pray, read the
[1:21:19] scripture with me. Here, oh Lord, when I
[1:21:22] cry with my voice, have mercy upon me
[1:21:26] and answer me.
[1:21:36] When thou saidest, "Seek ye my face, my
[1:21:38] heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord,
[1:21:41] will I seek. Hide not thy face far from
[1:21:44] me, and put not thy servant away in
[1:21:46] anger. Put thou hast been my help. Leave
[1:21:52] me not, neither forsake me, oh God of my
[1:21:56] salvation.
[1:21:57] When my father and mother forsake me,
[1:22:00] then the Lord will take me up. Teach me
[1:22:03] thy way, O Lord, and lead me into thy
[1:22:05] plain path because of mine enemies.
[1:22:08] Deliver me not over to the will of mine
[1:22:10] enemies, for false witnesses are risen
[1:22:12] up against me, and such as breathe out
[1:22:14] cruelty. All of that's went on. Notice
[1:22:18] he begins to explain where he's at. I
[1:22:20] had fainted
[1:22:22] unless I had believed to see the
[1:22:24] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[1:22:26] living.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Wait on the Lord and be of good courage.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; And he shall strengthen
[1:22:36] thine heart. Wait, I say on the Lord.
[1:22:42] Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a couple points. When
[1:22:50] you get in a hurry, you get a hold get
[1:22:52] ahead of God.
[1:22:55] So many people wanted the rapture to
[1:22:56] happen in 1977.
[1:23:00] But some of us needed to be born.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Some of us needed to be born.
[1:23:09] Well, give me a scriptural preference.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Abraham got ahead of God
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; and he produced in his natural energies
[1:23:22] Ishmamail
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; had he waited on God.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, Solomon was going to come
[1:23:34] through Basheba.
[1:23:38] David got ahead of God.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; This is a sermon for another day. But
[1:23:45] David was getting to the age that even
[1:23:47] his people that was with him said, "You
[1:23:49] fouled all of your battles. You fought.
[1:23:52] You fought. You've been a warrior.
[1:23:54] You've been a mighty man. Why don't you
[1:23:56] stay home
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; and not go to church on Wednesday?"
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stay at home? You don't
[1:24:03] need to go all the time. He stayed home,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; but he should have been at battle.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; If he'd have been at battle, he would
[1:24:12] not have been lusting.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Don't let your enemies
[1:24:18] talk you out of doing God's will.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; And when he was staying home, he got in
[1:24:28] trouble.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; What did it produce? a dead child.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; But God still had Solomon to come
[1:24:39] through that womb.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Predestinated.
[1:24:46] He was going to come through there. But
[1:24:49] God would have provided a different way.
[1:24:52] But instead, he murdered a man.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Our energies will get us in trouble.
[1:25:02] Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm going to do the will of God
[1:25:04] if I have to do it myself. Yeah, you
[1:25:06] will.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you will. You'll get ahead of God
[1:25:10] and then you'll get in trouble.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Minister, young minister walked up to me
[1:25:20] one night and he said, "I'm going to go
[1:25:22] down to that that that Pentecostal
[1:25:24] church and I'm going to introduce the
[1:25:25] message to him." And I just simply
[1:25:27] looked at him and I said, "Do that? You
[1:25:29] lose your wife, you lose your children,
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; you'll walk away from the message. It
[1:25:35] was exactly, it happened exactly like I
[1:25:37] told him.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; He now sits in a message church alone
[1:25:45] cuz he did something he wasn't supposed
[1:25:47] to do.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; He thought, I'm going to do it. I'm
[1:25:52] going to go introduce. You don't go to a
[1:25:54] barroom
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; to introduce the message.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; You get on the devil's grounds.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to go to that church.
[1:26:06] Introduce the message to him. Listen,
[1:26:09] let me just say, and it might be many
[1:26:10] times things that can happen, but let me
[1:26:12] just say this to you. As it turned out,
[1:26:15] there was his wife gone. There was his
[1:26:17] children gone.
[1:26:22] But it wasn't the right thing to do.
[1:26:36] Brother Ram says in victory day
[1:26:39] he said it seems like
[1:26:41] in the Christian life
[1:26:44] if a fellow is not absolutely centered
[1:26:47] on Christ
[1:26:50] the Christian life seems like
[1:26:54] it holds so many disappointments
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; but those disappointments ments
[1:27:03] are God's divine will happening for us.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; What are they doing? Building character.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Now, it don't seem like
[1:27:20] that it would be like that,
[1:27:23] but it's God's way of doing things.
[1:27:30] He lets us hit the river
[1:27:33] to see what we'll do.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:27:39] In identification, brother Bam says the
[1:27:43] word
[1:27:46] molds God's character to us.
[1:27:51] I thought this was incredible, a
[1:27:53] credible statement. A lot of times we're
[1:27:55] looking for truth in the wrong places.
[1:27:59] And I knew it. I knew it was accurate
[1:28:03] when I found this quote.
[1:28:06] And then brother
[1:28:08] brother Gabriel was sitting with us at
[1:28:10] breakfast this morning. He said, "I'm
[1:28:11] scared of all of these devotionals that
[1:28:14] these AI things are putting together
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; because they're giving us things that we
[1:28:21] want to hear
[1:28:23] and they're bolding it to their own
[1:28:24] opinion."
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. But the word
[1:28:29] molds God's character to us. Now
[1:28:33] remember Elisha,
[1:28:38] they didn't trim the robe to fit Elisha.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; God trimmed Elisha to fit the robe.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; We sing the song as a child. He's still
[1:28:52] working on me. and we're 80 years old
[1:28:55] and he's still working on us.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; He said he's molds God's character to us
[1:29:06] and anything that's tried to be mixed
[1:29:09] with character breaks that mold. And
[1:29:12] your character will not mix with the
[1:29:15] world.
[1:29:16] If you're being molded in the form of
[1:29:18] God by letting the mind of that was in
[1:29:21] Christ being in you, that's the control
[1:29:25] tower.
[1:29:27] Always take it back with the word.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; If it don't fit the word, don't do it.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Brother D, I'm going make a statement.
[1:29:35] If you got a question to it,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; don't do it.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; If that dress is too thin, don't do it.
[1:29:46] Young men, if them pants are too tight,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; don't do it.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Matthew 16 and verse 18. And I say this
[1:30:01] unto you, that thou art Peter, and upon
[1:30:03] this rock I will build my church, and
[1:30:05] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:30:08] against it. And I will give unto you the
[1:30:10] keys of the kingdom of heaven. This is
[1:30:13] powerful words. And whatever thou shalt
[1:30:16] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.
[1:30:19] And whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:30:21] shall be loosed in heaven.
[1:30:25] A good good place to bind and loose is
[1:30:28] Isaiah 53. Who hath believed our report
[1:30:31] unto whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:30:32] revealed. For he shall grow up him
[1:30:34] before him as a tender plant, as a root
[1:30:36] out of dry ground. He hath no form nor
[1:30:38] comeliness. And when we shall see him,
[1:30:40] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:30:42] him.
[1:30:44] He is despised of and rejected of men, a
[1:30:47] man of sorrows, acquainted with grief,
[1:30:51] and we hid as it were our faces from
[1:30:53] him. And he was despised, and we
[1:30:56] esteemed him not.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Surely he hath bore our griefs.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Carried our sorrows.
[1:31:12] Yeah, we did esteem him shricken and
[1:31:14] smitten of God and afflicted. Let's read
[1:31:17] this next one. But he was wounded for
[1:31:21] our transgressions.
[1:31:22] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[1:31:27] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[1:31:30] And with his stripes,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; we sing the song, it's already done.
[1:31:48] 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 58.
[1:31:51] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be you
[1:31:53] steadfast.
[1:31:59] Let's read this together. Therefore, my
[1:32:01] beloved brethren, be you steadfast,
[1:32:05] unmovable,
[1:32:06] always abounding in the work of the
[1:32:08] Lord. For as much that you know that
[1:32:11] your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[1:32:25] Jesus says in John chapter 14, he says,
[1:32:27] "Let not your heart be troubled."
[1:32:32] You could preach for years on what
[1:32:35] troubles your heart.
[1:32:40] And Jesus said, "Let not your heart be
[1:32:42] troubled." And let let me just take 30
[1:32:44] seconds. He was standing before
[1:32:47] disciples.
[1:32:50] They were going to cut their heads off.
[1:32:53] They were going to be crucified upside
[1:32:55] down.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; You talking, you know, there's always
[1:33:00] scoffers says, "Is he the Lord? Is that
[1:33:02] Jesus? Is that really him?"
[1:33:05] Let me just say the proof was in the
[1:33:06] pudding. with these disciples.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Once he's gone,
[1:33:13] when they come up against the most
[1:33:15] incredible adversity,
[1:33:17] Peter would say, "Don't crucify me like
[1:33:20] him. I'm not worthy of that. Turn me
[1:33:22] upside down." Listen, crucifixion was
[1:33:25] horrible as it was, but double the
[1:33:27] burden.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Take my head off. Drag me through the
[1:33:33] street.
[1:33:35] These guys believed he was the Christ.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? They believed it with
[1:33:44] all their heart.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Now, this sermon they've heard, "Let not
[1:33:52] your heart be troubled."
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Remember these words when they're
[1:33:56] getting ready to cut your head off.
[1:33:58] Remember these words when they put a
[1:33:59] lasso around your neck and you can Let
[1:34:01] not your heart be troubled. You believe
[1:34:03] in God, believe also in me. In my
[1:34:05] father's house are many mansions. Not
[1:34:07] brick and stone, but I got a body that
[1:34:10] looks just like yours, but it's young.
[1:34:12] It has no sin in it.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; And you're going to move from that body.
[1:34:18] I don't mind moving.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; I I want to give you a report. Don't cry
[1:34:23] when I die.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Rejoice. I made it.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. As Billy Graham would
[1:34:32] say, "Don't cry for me. I'll be more
[1:34:35] alive there than I am here."
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; In my father's house of many mansions,
[1:34:41] if it were not so, I would have told
[1:34:43] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; And I go and prepare a place for you,
[1:34:48] and I will come again and receive you
[1:34:50] unto myself, that where I am, there you
[1:34:53] may be also.
[1:34:55] Revelation 1 and verse 17. Fear not.
[1:35:01] I am the first and the last.
[1:35:06] I am he that liveth and was dead. And
[1:35:09] behold, I am alive forever more and have
[1:35:12] the keys of death and hell.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Did I say something make y'all mad?
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Did I say something turned your amens
[1:35:24] off?
[1:35:28] I feel like I'm talking to a radio
[1:35:30] broadcast.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor and say, "I come
[1:35:34] to have church."
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; You know, a preacher can feel that.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want y'all to go to a bar room
[1:35:49] and witness. I really don't want you to.
[1:35:53] There's better places to do that.
[1:35:59] You don't need to go to the Pentecostal
[1:36:01] church and witness the message. They
[1:36:02] turned it down a long time ago.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; That's where the spirit came in. So, I
[1:36:09] think I go back and cut that dude's head
[1:36:10] off.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; How powerful is my prayer?
[1:36:17] How powerful? My mother was a woman that
[1:36:21] she didn't scream.
[1:36:26] My mother was a kind of woman that
[1:36:27] prayed prayers
[1:36:31] that was a whisper. But I watched my
[1:36:34] mama's prayers shake hell.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; So whether you scream or whether you
[1:36:43] whisper,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; pray.
[1:36:51] [Applause]
[1:37:00] Now, some of you have the ability and
[1:37:04] the gift to be able to pray to be able
[1:37:06] to pray for an hour.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; I doubt it, but some of you could
[1:37:13] probably do that. But some of you can
[1:37:16] pray for 45 seconds and shake hell.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; I want you to get the I want you to get
[1:37:22] it.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, give me a scriptural
[1:37:25] reason. Peter is sinking in the water.
[1:37:29] He don't have a He don't have an hour to
[1:37:31] pray.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; So it means whatever you say to God,
[1:37:39] mean it.
[1:37:42] And if all you can do is help,
[1:37:45] [Applause]
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; when I was burning in a fire, I
[1:37:54] screamed, "Help us, Jesus."
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; When I was getting ready for brain
[1:38:02] surgery and he was pushing me down the
[1:38:04] aisle, I simply begin to pray aloud. And
[1:38:06] the man that was taking me down, I said,
[1:38:08] "God, you said we could break the chains
[1:38:11] and it would go from generations to
[1:38:13] generation." They say this cancer that
[1:38:16] I'm fighting come from my generations
[1:38:19] before. I'm praying that God break the
[1:38:22] chains.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Don't let it fall on my children. Don't
[1:38:27] let it fall on my grandbabies.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, pray the prayer and mean what
[1:38:34] you're praying.
[1:38:50] Oh, brother Ron, that was just a prayer.
[1:38:51] Let me just say something. Prayers are
[1:38:53] generational.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; They're generational. They're not just
[1:38:58] for your generation, but they're
[1:38:59] generation to your children and your
[1:39:02] children's children. Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about power prayers.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; I don't want Titus I don't want Isaac to
[1:39:13] have to take chemo for years.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to help me now.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; You don't want your children to fight
[1:39:23] the cycles of temper and anger and lust.
[1:39:32] Break a chains,
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But my my family had fought
[1:39:44] this and my family, let me just say,
[1:39:46] break the chain.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; You break it. You pray.
[1:39:53] Take God's word and break the chain off
[1:39:56] of your life.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] Don't excuse the devil. Say, "Well, it's
[1:40:03] generational. I'm just going to get it.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; My daddy had a lust problem, so I guess
[1:40:09] I'm going to get it." Break the chain.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Did you get it? Amen.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said prayer changes
[1:40:33] things.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:40:39] was ever put in the control of human
[1:40:42] beings.
[1:40:44] Notice these next words. There's no
[1:40:47] atomic bomb
[1:40:49] or hydrogen bomb as powerful
[1:40:54] as prayer.
[1:41:06] People will watch this overseas. They
[1:41:08] don't know anything about our Civil War.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; We fought the Civil War right here.
[1:41:14] Right here where we're at, just up the
[1:41:16] road. Wars took place. Stonewall
[1:41:18] Jackson, you've heard of him. Stonewall
[1:41:20] Jackson had a headquarters right down
[1:41:21] here about a mile from this place. It's
[1:41:23] a brick building, brick house. They
[1:41:26] fought. They fought just right up here.
[1:41:28] Then they come right down, went to New
[1:41:30] Market and fought. They fought there.
[1:41:32] And And I'm not trying to tell you the
[1:41:34] battles. Stonewall Jackson became
[1:41:37] popular for the wars that happened right
[1:41:39] up here. We're no longer fighting that
[1:41:42] war.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; we're no longer fighting the war. They
[1:41:47] say that it was a racial war. That's
[1:41:49] only a cover up. It was about taxes and
[1:41:53] tariffs. Amen.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; The North would not allow the South to
[1:41:59] sell their goods without a monstrous
[1:42:04] tariff.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; They couldn't make a living.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; So they decided to fight.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, that's
[1:42:13] difficult." There's sometimes even in
[1:42:15] your Christian experience, you're going
[1:42:17] to have to man up or woman up on the
[1:42:20] devil.
[1:42:22] You're going to have to be a shamguard
[1:42:24] and say, "I've had enough.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to pass this down to my
[1:42:34] children."
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; I've had enough.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; This is one of my favorite scriptures.
[1:42:44] Romans 8 and verse 31.
[1:42:50] What should we then say to these things?
[1:42:54] Now, in your closet, in your private
[1:42:56] times, I want you to remember this
[1:42:57] scripture.
[1:42:59] If God be for us,
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; don't have a pity party in your closet.
[1:43:06] Don't have a pity party at your house.
[1:43:08] If God be for us,
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; who can be against us?
[1:43:21] you pray at your home. Sister Tracy is a
[1:43:24] cleaner at my house. She comes once
[1:43:26] every two weeks I think is the schedule.
[1:43:28] She comes and she cleans in my office.
[1:43:31] She says many times when she's in our
[1:43:33] office in my office pray in my office
[1:43:36] cleaning she can feel her hair stand up
[1:43:39] because the presence of God that's in
[1:43:40] there.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; It's because I pray.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] and God comes.
[1:43:49] You get the benefits of that.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You get the benefits of those prayer
[1:43:55] times.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; If God be for us,
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; who can be against us?
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; He that spared not his own son, but
[1:44:09] delivered him up for us all. How shall
[1:44:11] he not with him freely give us all
[1:44:13] things? Who shall lay anything to the
[1:44:16] charge of God's elect?
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; It is God that justify.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going help you right here. Quit
[1:44:27] beating yourself for yesterday.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; We are not Catholics. We don't do
[1:44:33] purgatory.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; We don't pay for prayer. We don't count
[1:44:38] rosary beats.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; There is therefore now no condemnation
[1:44:42] to them. Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; History is history. When you ask God to
[1:44:48] forgive you,
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; God puts in the sea of God's
[1:44:54] forgetfulness, it's over.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Now ask God to cleanse that from your
[1:45:05] mind.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[1:45:13] that died, yay, rather is riven risen
[1:45:15] again, who is even at the right hand of
[1:45:17] God, who maketh intercession for us. Who
[1:45:20] shall separate us from the love of
[1:45:22] Christ?
[1:45:23] Shall tribulation or distress or
[1:45:25] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:45:27] pearl sword? As it is written, for thy
[1:45:29] sake we're killed all the day long, or
[1:45:31] we're counted as sheep for the
[1:45:32] slaughter. Nay, in all these things, we
[1:45:35] are more than conquerors through him
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; that loved us. For I am persuaded that
[1:45:43] neither death nor life, nor angels, or
[1:45:44] prince of powers, or powers, or things
[1:45:46] present, or things to come, nor height,
[1:45:48] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[1:45:50] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:45:52] Christ, which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:45:54] Lord.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; For some of you, you might know this.
[1:46:11] Some of you might not know this. Have
[1:46:13] you ever wondered about what happened to
[1:46:15] the men that signed the Declaration of
[1:46:18] Independence?
[1:46:25] Five Signatures was captured by the
[1:46:27] British as traitors,
[1:46:30] tortured
[1:46:32] until they died.
[1:46:34] 12 had their homes ransacked and burned.
[1:46:39] Two lost their sons serving in the
[1:46:42] revolutionary armor armory.
[1:46:45] Another had two sons captured.
[1:46:48] Nine of the 56 fought and died from
[1:46:52] wounds of hardships of the Revolutionary
[1:46:55] War.
[1:46:57] They signed and privileged their lives,
[1:47:01] their fortunes,
[1:47:03] and their sacred honor.
[1:47:07] What kind of men were these men that
[1:47:09] signed the Declaration of Independence?
[1:47:12] 24 were lawyers and jurist.
[1:47:16] 11 were merchants.
[1:47:19] Nine were farmers.
[1:47:21] Farmers with large plantations, men of
[1:47:25] means,
[1:47:26] men that were well educated. But they
[1:47:29] signed the Declaration of Independence
[1:47:32] knowing full well that the penalty would
[1:47:36] be death if they were captured.
[1:47:41] Carter Claxton of Virginia, a wealthy
[1:47:44] planter,
[1:47:46] a trader, saw his ships swept into the
[1:47:50] seas by the British.
[1:47:53] He sold his home and properties to pay
[1:47:56] his debts. And this man that was a
[1:48:00] millionaire died in rags.
[1:48:04] Thomas McKeen
[1:48:07] was so hounded by the British that he
[1:48:10] was forced to move his family almost
[1:48:12] conscially. He served in the Congress
[1:48:15] without pay and his family was kept in
[1:48:18] hiding. His possessions were taken from
[1:48:22] him and poverty was his reward.
[1:48:27] Vandals and soldiers looted the
[1:48:29] properties of of many of these men. I'm
[1:48:34] not going to take time to read all their
[1:48:36] names.
[1:48:38] Their homes were taken
[1:48:41] as headquarters.
[1:48:43] One of the homes was a home of Thomas
[1:48:46] Nelson.
[1:48:48] British General Cornwall Wallace had
[1:48:50] taken over his Nelson home for his
[1:48:55] headquarters.
[1:48:57] Here's what his response was.
[1:49:00] General Washington, General George
[1:49:03] Washington.
[1:49:05] He said, "Will you open fire on my
[1:49:08] house?"
[1:49:11] and that home was destroyed
[1:49:15] and Nelson would die bankrupt. He said,
[1:49:18] "But I would rather my home be destroyed
[1:49:22] than my enemy,"
[1:49:24] Somebody ought to help me preach
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; take over and rule inside of my house.
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:49:41] Francis Lewis had his home and his
[1:49:43] properties destroyed. The enemy jailed
[1:49:46] his wife and she died within a few
[1:49:48] months. John Hart was driven from the
[1:49:51] from his wife's bedside as she was
[1:49:54] dying. Their 13 children fled for their
[1:49:58] lives. His fields and his meal were laid
[1:50:03] to wa waste. No more than a year he
[1:50:06] lived in forest and caves, returning
[1:50:09] home to find his wife dead and his
[1:50:11] children vanished.
[1:50:14] Wow.
[1:50:16] They signed the Declaration of
[1:50:20] Independence.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Here's what I wish. I wish that they
[1:50:26] would give me 25 minutes in Congress
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; to remind them
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; of where we come from.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; And I would tell them that every one of
[1:50:49] them are rotten and they've sold their
[1:50:52] soul
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; for a pot of gold.
[1:50:56] These were men of integrity.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; That did not want to live in slavery.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Folks, I don't want to miss the rapture.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be in a lukewarm
[1:51:13] condition and just get by.
[1:51:17] [Applause]
[1:51:29] They sealed their future
[1:51:33] by taking their pen and putting their
[1:51:37] name, not somebody else's name
[1:51:41] on that piece of paper.
[1:51:47] And I don't want to hurt nobody other
[1:51:48] country's feelings, but that's the
[1:51:50] reason we're not Germans today.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we can stand under
[1:51:57] that flag. She's rotten. Yes, she is.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; But she's still my natural homeland.
[1:52:12] I think it's incredible that John
[1:52:14] Hancock, we'd all know John Hancock by
[1:52:18] his name.
[1:52:20] But they asked John Hancock,
[1:52:23] why did he sign his name so big?
[1:52:27] He said, 'I signed my name large enough
[1:52:30] that the king would not need his glasses
[1:52:33] on to read who I was.
[1:52:36] [Applause]
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; I come to the end of this message today
[1:52:46] and tell you I'm not signing the
[1:52:48] Declaration of Independence for this
[1:52:50] nation,
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; but I want to remind you I am a child of
[1:52:54] God.
[1:52:57] I didn't come here to stay. I came from
[1:53:00] God and I'm going back to God. This
[1:53:03] world is not my home. I'm only passing
[1:53:06] through.
[1:53:10] Let me sign my name big enough until the
[1:53:13] King of Hell
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; don't need his reading glasses on it.
[1:53:27] Put my name behind beside of Abraham and
[1:53:30] Moses and put my name beside of William
[1:53:32] Brandham. I am not ashamed.
[1:53:34] [Applause]
[1:53:53] Hallelujah.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Sister Cassie, today be a good day to
[1:53:57] sing glory, glory, hallelujah,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; but I'm out of air, so I'm going to have
[1:54:05] to have Matthew to sing it for me.
[1:54:14] You may not know this, but brother
[1:54:16] Matthew's been asked to preach with us
[1:54:18] at brother Tom Rays at his camp this
[1:54:20] year.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; And he's going to be one of the
[1:54:23] speakers.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Brother, are you proud? I ain't stupid.
[1:54:42] Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; I'm proud of what Jesus is doing in your
[1:54:46] life.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Let's let's I want to
[1:54:52] mine my eyes have seen the
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Mine eyes have seen the glory
[1:55:01] of the coming of the Lord
[1:55:06] has

[1:55:10] the grace of God.
[1:55:14] Yeah,
[1:55:16] [Music]
[1:55:23] truth is.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it with all of our hearts.

[1:55:35] glory, hallelujah.
[1:55:39] [Music]

[1:55:58] He is true.
[1:56:01] His heart is.
[1:56:06] Will I have seen him? The watch fires of
[1:56:12] the hund circle camps. We have built him
[1:56:19] an alter
[1:56:21] evening
[1:56:23] and
[1:56:25] I can read his rightous
[1:56:31] fling.
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:43] Oh glory,
[1:56:46] glory,
[1:56:48] hallelujah.

[1:57:04] glory.
[1:57:06] Hallelujah.

[1:57:23] Hallelujah.

[2:02:09] Hallelujah. I'm so glad.

[2:02:19] Jesus, I'll never forget what you done
[2:02:23] for me. Well Jesus, I'll never forget
[2:02:27] how you set me free. Well Jesus, I'll
[2:02:31] never forget how you brought me out.
[2:02:36] Well Jesus, I'll never forget. No,
[2:02:39] never.
[2:02:41] Well, how can I forget what you've done
[2:02:46] for me? Well, how can I forget how you
[2:02:51] set me free? Well, how could I forget
[2:02:56] how you brought me out?
[2:03:00] How could I forget? No, never.
[2:03:05] Well, he's done so much for me. Well, I
[2:03:09] cannot tell it all. No, I cannot tell it
[2:03:13] all. No, I cannot tell it all. Well,

[2:03:42] Jesus, I'll never forget.
[2:03:47] Go ahead, Jesus. Turn around and bless
[2:03:50] your neighbor. Just tell them something
[2:03:52] that God's done for you. How can I
[2:03:55] forget that you done for me? Well, how

[2:05:14] choir song right here. I'm going to say
[2:05:16] never. And y'all going to shout back,
[2:05:18] never forget. It's one of them echo
[2:05:20] songs.
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; How can I forget what he done for me?
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; I say never.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; And you say never forget.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Never.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Never forget.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; If John Hancock could sign his name that
[2:05:37] big
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; so that the king would recognize his
[2:05:41] name when it was signed. I want to sign
[2:05:43] my amen so loud
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; that all the hell's got to hear me.
[2:05:48] Amen. Amen. Amen. Never
[2:05:54] never forget.
[2:05:56] Never
[2:05:58] never forget.
[2:06:00] Never
[2:06:03] forget.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; I said never
[2:06:07] never forget. Well, how can I forget
[2:06:11] what you've done for me? Well, how can I
[2:06:16] forget how you set this home free? Well,
[2:06:20] how can I forget how you brought me out?
[2:06:26] How can I forget? No, never.
[2:06:34] Hallelujah.
[2:06:37] Aren't you glad to be in the army of
[2:06:39] Almighty God?
[2:06:41] To be on a battlefield knowing that you
[2:06:43] got a weapon that has never been
[2:06:46] defeated, never will be defeated, and
[2:06:49] will still be the unconquered,
[2:06:52] victorious Jesus Christ throughout all
[2:06:55] of eternity. I say he's my champion.
[2:06:58] He's the greatest warrior that has ever
[2:07:00] put on this armor. And I'm fighting for
[2:07:03] a captain that will never lose.
[2:07:07] Well, whose side are you on, brother

[2:07:33] for I am with thee.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; It always It always makes me chuckle
[2:07:44] when you read Brother Brandham when he
[2:07:45] starts talking about faith has got big
[2:07:48] muscles and a hairy chest. It always
[2:07:50] makes me chuckle. You That's a homely
[2:07:52] looking guy right there, ain't it?
[2:07:56] Fear not. I am with thee. Now go in
[2:07:59] there tomorrow at your job and say,
[2:08:02] "Boss, look. I need to add some things
[2:08:04] to my resume.
[2:08:07] I can do all things.
[2:08:11] I This guy right here, can you imagine
[2:08:15] when Adam Frasier shows up at Rome
[2:08:17] dumpster Reynolds tomorrow and said,
[2:08:18] "Hey boss, I heard a preacher talking
[2:08:21] yesterday said I can do all things." And
[2:08:23] I say, you're absolutely right. Here's
[2:08:25] the employee of the year. We only got
[2:08:27] one, but it's for you, buddy. I can do
[2:08:31] all things through Christ who's
[2:08:34] strengthening me. And I just happen to
[2:08:37] believe it. It ain't me. It ain't how
[2:08:41] big I am, but it's who I believe in. I
[2:08:45] can do all things.
[2:08:49] Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be
[2:08:52] not dismayed, for I am thy God.
[2:08:56] My girls right here never have to fear
[2:09:00] about some teenage pumpkin coming in
[2:09:02] there and trying to rob something away
[2:09:04] from them because they know they got a
[2:09:06] daddy that's packing more than just
[2:09:08] muscle.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; They know that I have some things that
[2:09:12] are hidden in a closet that can take
[2:09:14] care of some matters. And I never have
[2:09:17] to fear what Satan can pinch me in a
[2:09:19] corner with because I got a father
[2:09:22] that's got an open book.
[2:09:26] And he's armed and dangerous.

[2:09:33] sisters.

[2:09:39] at some Church of Christ. We at FGLT. Go
[2:09:42] ahead and flex your muscles. Go ahead
[2:09:44] and flex your faith muscles at that
[2:09:45] devil and say, "Today is the last day."
[2:09:53] That's just a carnal muscle. But down on
[2:09:56] the inside of here, there is something
[2:09:58] bubbling on the inside of me that
[2:10:01] Satan's been trying to put out for over
[2:10:03] 18 years. And he has not been
[2:10:06] successful. But I'm still standing
[2:10:09] because I'm armed and dangerous.
[2:10:12] Matthew, you better sing cuz I'm happy.
[2:10:14] Go ahead. Worship the Lord a little bit.
