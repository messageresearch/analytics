Lord amen isn't it good to us amen amen I love him with all my heart amen first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. I want to speak to you tonight on an inspired word to an inspired seed all of your Bible is inspired it is the Breath of God it is God's thoughts in word form he used 40 different writers and through them inspired them and if you can think about Moses writing the the first books of the Bible Moses wasn't there so God allowed him to see what happened in the Garden of Eden he allowed him to go through Abraham's life he allowed him in all of those and just actually took him right through it that was not the thoughts of Moses that was the thoughts of God being pulled through Moses whether it's Ezekiel or Jeremiah or Nahum or brother Branham the message of this day is the inspired word of God as a matter of fact it is the opticals on the inspired word because even even this year this book is still the the number one seller as much as it's hated it's still the number one seller and I am thankful for that but but you know many men write books of theory and books of their own thoughts but this is God's word and you know we've had it in colleges and they've had great institutions that tried to decode the Bible but God sent a prophet in this day he sent a prophet to a bride-believing people that would catch the word and the reason you could catch the word is because God predestinated a seed on the inside of you you can literally said in the same church beside of one person that is not inspired because brother Brown says in non-seed there's just nothing to Quicken you can't make a goat a sheep but for a sheep he just says that's the truth Hattie Wright said that's absolutely the truth brother Branham and and and let me just say this you that's what we do we don't have to explain it we just believe it I don't even have to understand it all I just believe it with those thoughts in mind I want to speak to you on an inspired word to an inspired seat and the reason it's relevant to you is because that predestinated seed on the inside of you and this is your love letter that works for you Paul wrote this 2000 years ago but it's to you but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him and we can say Amen to that we believe that for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep I want to read that scripture aloud with each and every one of you for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep Hallelujah for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen you may be seated tonight may God bless his word in Revelations chapter 19 and verse 6. and I heard as if it was a voice of a great multitude as a voice of many Waters as the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and you say Amen and your amen's right there says so be it I'm identified with that scripture and to her and that's you what's granted that she should be a raid and find linen clean and white for the final end is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God in Revelation chapter 21 I want to read about your future and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth amen for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no mercy and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with him and be their God I want to read that verse again and I would like for you to read that with me and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God this is a tremendous scripture and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death nor neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold I make all things new brother Fred that's enough to shout about right there behold I make all things new when I look in the mirror I'm glad for that and he saith unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely now this is our scripture and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son I want you to say he's talking about me I want you to read the scripture with me now he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son God predestinated you to live in the darkest wickedest Satan's Eden that there's ever been it was an age to which the witch even the prophet couldn't even see past 1977. let me just give you a for instance how many is born after 77. Hallelujah you babies I preaching to a kid crowd here [Applause] I want you to just think about this brother Branham preached in a time where there was no internet no Facebook none of this nonsense to where that the news was just boom I mean just everybody's got the news that they're and let me just say if you feed on that all the time you're going to be a depressed person because the first thing you get up and you are looking I don't care what Avenue that you listen to you you just look at all the murders and the nonsense that is going on [Music] and you just look at how the world is falling apart but if you can look at another book you'll be inspired okay to another world brother Brandon would stand there and he would stand and stand in Two Worlds at the same time and you being a patient and you've maybe traveled 1500 miles to be in the meeting your wife is sick and you stand for a long time to get a prayer card and then brother Branham at random at random maybe a hundred prayer cards are given out 200 prayer cards maybe even 500 prayer cards are given out and brother Branham will just call out a call out a uh maybe 15. and you get called and you get called and you know there's been huge lines waiting on those prayer cards but now you get called and you walk to the stage and you stand you may stand for quite a while as brother Branham is just taking his time with each individual now listen God told him where to start and it wasn't brother Brown I'm picking out certain individuals and and and and here now their name is being told to them and their condition is being told to them and you know there's something standing between you and I brother Branham didn't have a thing in his ear telling him what was on the prayer card he had none of that modern technology that as that disposal that's a gift today brother Brown had a road generally a row of microphones and he would ask which one is working and I want to speak that everybody in the back can hear sound systems were much different takes were much different it was a new Gadget God knew exactly where to put the prophet where he could operate in a supernatural realm to where every night there wasn't some Facebook challenge I find it interesting that it took almost 50 years after his death for people to start wanting to challenge that are you with me now after his death it's all over listen the messages it's done it's not been delivered it's not up for debate but it was for an inspired people that could hear the word of God and you were one in a million that caught the word and just as a patient standing on the stage you said that's me you said that's me listen the message isn't for everybody though we'll treat everybody as well as we can treat them because one of them might be a believer we don't want to treat anybody rude no matter what faith that they're a part of we want to treat them with respect brother Branham did brother Brown was very respectful to oral Robertson Billy Graham and and many of those people out there and he taught us to be respectful to them are you with me now why I would say that is you know he he would be in California he would talk about people running off to the mountains too to hide and get away from God John steaman was up in those mountains trying to get his wife away from this message and he moved her all over the United States trying to get her away from the message but one day the seed struck one day the seed came to life and he became a phenomenal Pastor his son Danny it's a phenomenal preacher well I wanted the best and he stands there and he preaches the word of God his brother-in-law Bill Hershberger other members of the family her real believers what a paradox that God prepares he bypasses a million many times in cases better looking better educated better jobs God knows where to find you he knew exactly where to find you but this is our moment here we stand in this moment we could truly save this day is this scripture fulfilled now you remember when brother Brady was sitting into services and brother Brandon preaches this day as a scripture fulfilled and then what is the attraction on the mountain brother Brady found a certain seat in in the place and he had a letter in his pocket it was a letter from his wife and that letter told him that she was having trouble with her feet and and serval are called and then all of a sudden he calls brother Brady telling where he was from what country he was from what his name was tell him the condition of his wife and her feet brother Brady would be a testimony of this message around the world these things don't happen by chance now I've got to drive this down I'll probably finish in the morning this doesn't happen by chance God was not taking a chance on finding you he knew where you would be at we see the bride's Revival happening these were things that brother Homer as our founding Pastor here he longed to see he longed to see the moving of God every service he longed to see a people that loved this message with all their heart not a bunch of make-believers not a bunch of people that just want to be there for the emotion but wanted to be here for the word and the word could ignite their life he longed for these kind of services the scripture tells us that these all died in faith they didn't give up but these died in faith believing now it becomes your turn your cycle it's happening Among Us don't take it for granted this is not just other services as I'm preaching you this to you tonight no doubt I could go to many different churches in the nominal World it wouldn't mean nothing to them but because of who you are the vision of God is becoming a living reality now we get excited as we are approaching the resurrection and Rapture and seeing God this message live in humanity we're seeing we're seeing the book of Acts happen among us we're seeing tongues and interpretation of tongues we're seeing Miracles and we're seeing people the greatest Miracle is people living living the word and you're written Epistles it's not something you don't have to make yourself do but this is like breathing [Applause] you don't have to be beat to believe the message you don't have to be beat to come to church it's a love affair [Applause] God's wife is on the scene and this layout of C and H ate Satan's Eden brother Branham would get tore up in a restaurant in a restaurant he would see a woman and she had some stuff over her eyes another brother had to stop him he said she's got a terrible disease said she must I've seen horrible diseases all over the world but she's got a terrible disease and the brother caught him and said brother Branham that's paint that's paint now if we could transfer him to 2023 . how he felt in that restaurant can you imagine how difficult for that Prophet that lived in Two Worlds how difficult it would be for him to function listen that gift just didn't happen in a Pulpit are you with me now but he would he would he would see a woman with paint on her eyes and we become so grieved in his spirit now we see him he's he's like us typical men he's went shopping with his wife and he said in there an escalator because he had been transported into hell when he was a boy and he felt like he was falling and falling and falling he would never stop falling that's what sin will do to you that's what happens when people leave the message oh I'm not going to go that far you can't stop yourself there's no edges of the cliff to where you can stop yourself because sin will take you further than you ever thought you would go [Applause] setting these pews and and become homosexuals later lesbians later divorce later it's because you can't you can't live this message in the world [Applause] sorry I have to say those things it's just the truth brother Brian would see those women come up over the escalator and they're speaking in another language and they've got those hairdos and they've got that paint all over themselves and he would tell us that the Lost is Among Us can you imagine how difficult it is for him to preach Souls now in prison the Eternal lost is Among Us let me just say sitting in a service like this is Grace [Music] don't never take this for granted don't never take it for granted our brother Marcus sits here what a miracle that that is a god rich in Mercy a cycle of over 20 years a spiraling cycle it seemed like it would never end but God rich in Mercy reached into the whirlpool of his life because a seed was laying there and Jesus said I'll not lose one I might lose one sister Judy Hensley said him back there it was her brother-in-law as he's beginning to deteriorate in her life they took him in and took care of him Leo was a deacon here he was a man a pillar of this church and through that that God rich in Mercy touched brother Ted and sister Judy are you with me listen do you good if you hear their story she was running a little shop and Ted would come in and flirt with her they had histories both of them had histories God's not so interested in your history he's interested in your future [Applause] I was speaking to a minister this week and we were talking about people that are coming in as they're coming in now we're in the season of compel them to come the compelling them to come one by one they're coming we're in the season of the bride's Revival and they're coming in listen they're going to be very disqualified in a lot of ways but so was you there was a lot written on your list of History and God had to wipe and clear the deed that's owed against you you were worthy of hell are you with me and God cleans you up and in the cleaning you watched some of us had a lot of cleaning to do but he knows how to clean your spirit he knows how to clean your mind he knows how to clean your body up he knows how to clean your piercing he knows he knows how to clean your pants [Applause] he knows how to he knows how to dress you [Applause] Hallelujah any amazing God now this Bible that we have here tonight every bit of it's inspired it's all God's word and then if you receive the word you received God it's not up for negotiations many times when we come to the difficult parts of the scriptures it's you know we just ate the book and maybe there's parts of the book that's written in there that was difficult for you a long time yeah but just keep eating maybe maybe it was hair for your sisters maybe it was rock and roll for your brothers you just keep eating you see the word cleanses it just cleanses brother Brian makes a statement I think is so profound this is either the word of God or it's a deceiving book it is either right or it's wrong and if even one portion of it is wrong it's all wrong brother Homer would make a statement he'd say you know if you have a pie and one of those apples is rotten just one the whole pie is rotten if you're at my house I'm the official potato pillar I can do something and so being the official potato pillar I come across rotten spots and so I begin to cut those rotten spots out or I just throw the potato away now if I come to a mercy potato nothing stinks worse than a there's some Jesus smell worse but but if I just ah put it in there that whole pot now becomes contaminated a few drops of heavy chemical poison can destroy a reservoir then when we come to denominational thinking [Applause] and we start bringing in denominational thoughts [Music] a new way of thinking what you don't realize you've made this a deceptive book and before long you're tearing Pages out well that's not inspired it's not for this day it's not for this day anymore listen this is an eternal prescription and if it was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's still the same way today if it's one God it's still one God today if it was serpent seed it's still serpent seed today and if you've got to have the Holy Ghost whether you live in America or in Africa or in Zimbabwe wherever you're at it's the same Holy Ghost today [Applause] now brother Branham explains to us he said now it took 10 years for Elisha to fit Elijah's rope ten years think about that he said God didn't trim the robe to fit Elisha I want you to follow this he he didn't trim he didn't trim the road to fit Elisha he trimmed Elisha so that's what goes on with you brother on why do we have to go to church for decades above he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be it took him just a week to make the moon and stars Sun and the Earth Jupiter and Mars how loving next words great patient he must be [Music] he's still working on me sometimes you get under pressure and you know why you're still here [Music] all of a sudden something your worst enemy is this piece of Flesh it don't give you a right to sin but you're thankful for Grace you know what I hear Brother Branham as he enters the pulpit how honest and how humble he was father forgive me of my sins his sins he tells us about his house he said I was I come in and I could tell there was a lot of tension in the house I'm gonna paraphrase here I could and he said I could tell there was a lot of tension in the house and he said I just started whistling singing a little song and he said she was there standing beside of me he said I put on an apron he said I washed the dishes here's a guy that's talking with the angel here's a guy that sees some of the most phenomenal visitations that there is here's a man that is walking in Sunset has a sword appear in his hands he's on top of the mountain and seven angels come down and reveal this book listen if the seals aren't revealed and the Thunder's released we're not going in no rapture we got to have a prophet if brother random did not fulfill Malachi 4 5 and 6 and reveal the Seven Seals and the Thunders we are in a mess but it happened Glory [Applause] thank God but he had to fight difficult things in his life now let me just take you to a spot this is okay I'm taking my time because you know sometimes on Sunday morning I just preach one service and I can go 100 miles an hour a minute for a three-day weekend this weekend so brother Brian was standing in Finland and he later tells the story that little dead boy somebody was arguing that with me one time and they said that didn't happen I said was you there was you there the only way that you can discredit that was you there you listen when brother Brian was explaining the that that cloud and he's talking about that cloud for the first time you can go you can go look it up when he's talking about that cloud that everybody wants to discredit I want you to watch him you go go you can go and listen to it and he and he and he's talking about that cloud how it came down it formed and the angel was there brother Edmund way Falls dead if I was dead and they come and check and he falls dead because he talked about it he had a complex and so he falls down now brother random has just explained that cloud now God is either right or he's wrong and so brother Branham steps off at the stage and goes to him and calls him by name and he resurrects are you with me God's not going to honor a lie that's not going to fill you with the Holy Ghost with you drinking and got all kind of porn habits in your life God don't live with the Devil [Applause] are you with me and listen it's the truth and so God amends his word brother man would step up behind the pulpit and he said if I'm not told you the truth may God strike me dead and then have a prayer line we're not dealing with a half soul listen this ought to make you shout here listen if all of that is correct then what he said about you then what he said about you is correct is this microphone working if all of that is correct then what is said about you is correct he said you just don't know how it feels you know where you're at all the Devils out of hell if he'd line up everything there was in hell up and he'd never stop it it's there it's got to happen notice what he says I want you to take this and think about it I spoke this in North Carolina and brother Joe Greene's meeting standing on the stage and I said you could line up every devil in hell seek every how powerful not just one is but every Fallen Angel that fell out of heaven and was cast into the Earth that operation the realm of hell you could line them all up and they couldn't stop it now remember a note to this side in the vision and I prayed he said you have to do just as you've seen it and I knelt down and they all gathered around and I said now watch the saith the spirit of God This Boy's Life will return to him it wasn't an if foreign call me a false prophet brother Chris you just have to say brother Branham had to know where he stood I'm doing something here I brought you this far you've got to know where you stand it's not just for enough for brother Brian I'm a brother Ron or brother Homer brother Andrew these men of God other people all through this audience you've got to know where you stand there's no wishy-washy you've got to know where you're standing because Satan would like to keep you here in a tribulation period but this word says you've got a rapture he'd like to destroy your family and you stand there on the word of God and say you can't have my wife you can't have my husband you can't have my children I've got a token applied I've got a covenant with God Hallelujah don't let the devil steal your home don't let him steal your job don't let him steal your health all right [Music] ought to be somewhat of an example to you I don't lay at home with the Molly grubs I don't I don't go around with a negative spirit this message has taught me to speak positive think positive speak positive sure there's a reality to cancer sure there's a reality to heaven to take chemo every day sure it's like having the flu almost every day of your life but listen to you God's greater oh amen brother man uses his term he said we're more than conquerors we just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors now we are dealing with a defeated enemy we're dealing with a defeated enemy don't resurrect it he's on the canvas don't help him get up he was defeated at Calvary don't make him no more than what he is we're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated brother Tom sprole is watching from Ohio tonight his mother is they're just they're just saying she could go at any time she's got some horrible situations in her life let me just say this to you if it's her time to go there's nothing that the devil can do to steal her soul and she will step into a well body but if it's her time to live there's nothing that the devil can do to keep her in that condition [Applause] I walked into your father's room he was on a kidney dialysis forgive me brain fog sometimes sets help me sitting beside a Brenda I know Garland but I want to call her name Janetta it wasn't going to come I'll say it like Homer would say I knew I did it my brother was sitting right here and he but the woman said I know you I know your name and he went he kept going kept going kept going going to the man finally he was in his 90s he finally said his name he said that's right I knew I'd get it I walked into brother Garland's room and they were telling him he was going to die at any moment only had hours to live and I walked in and I said you're going to be a winner either way and there's nothing the devil can do to get keep you from getting a well body but if it's God's purpose and he's going to raise you right back up do you know Garland lived in that body for several years not a few moments God raised him right back up listen there's nothing impossible for God to do we're dealing we're disputing with a conquered enemy and he's a squatter on our land Brother Ray I'm going to pray for your sister tomorrow with you but if you went home tonight you and sister Sue went home I know both of your nature so this is perfect you went home tonight and you hear of these crazy people that just move into people's house and squat it's in the news now and they just move into these big homes and hotels and squat and refuse to leave Ray's got something in his house and he's a very good Christian man it ain't going to be good if I could just say it it ain't gonna be pretty there's things that's going to happen and maybe after it all happens they'll call you because you have a deed and that deed has your name on it and I'm sure sister Seuss probably yours and it has your name on it it don't have squatters it don't have a list of 200 people on that and so they're drinking your coffee and they're eating your pizza and they're they're sitting in your favorite chair but you've got a right you got a right to get them out of your house I know we live in a nonsense age but we still got rights [Applause] we've got rights God given rights when Satan comes and starts squatting on her health we can either start believing the doctors report or God's report God's report is inspired whose report will we believe it's more than a song it's a word by his stripes we are healed if he abided me in my word abide in you ask what you will you remember brother Brandon would talk he'd talk about it a police officer and he said he may be as skinny as he can be and he's got a badge on it I hate to go into a place where they got music playing and they're talking about murdering police officers they ought to throw them people that write that stuff up put them in jail I'm gonna get on my saddle here just for a minute but these people that don't want police and then they turn around and hire security these crooked politicians will say anything to get people's votes and they don't want to defund the police and defund this you you just go ahead and get rid of all the police you're going to need a gun you're going to need angels all the way around your house brother Ron we're going to put that on the internet we're a blow up America I could care less but most of us don't have a hundred thousand dollars to pay for security for a month these guys need a raise they risked their life for me and you well you're just advocating police officers tonight well let me just tell you you're not going to make a Rapture without a pastor [Applause] well brother Ron I'm just going to push play well with sermon I tell you why people don't want a pastor because they don't want a real man of God that's a suit has a supernatural gift in his life that will come to your kitchen that'll come to your car and start telling you the conversations that's going on in your life but a real man of God he's not after your billfold he's after getting you in a new body that's what I'm interested in I'm interested in getting your children in a Rapture not just you interested in getting your children in a rapture [Music] [Applause] [Music] well we're all listening to what Joseph's telling us to listen to come on does he have the Holy Ghost for every Sovereign Church I have great respect for him but he stepped outside of his gift he may be brother branham's son but he stepped away out of his gift God called a five-fold Ministry [Applause] and I don't care if a guy can't preach his way out of a paperback he's going to say one sentence that's going to come to your heart and your life he may stagger through and it may be the ugliest sermon in the world but somewhere another if you prayed and you pull on the gift of God I'm not against you listening to tapes a matter of fact I advocated that's I listened to them all my life I listened to one this morning but God tells me to come to church forsake not the assembling of yourselves together we need one another I need you you need me we're a happy family Mustang to be continued [Applause] Hallelujah I like it when you come to church and you feel like you've come to
