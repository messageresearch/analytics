[1:02] ha
[1:08] for those that don't know John maybe
[1:10] knew that don't know John John is my
[1:12] buddy if we go back a long long time and
[1:14] a lot of debt and gratitude to him and
[1:18] we've been friends and some good times
[1:21] and rough times and and and the right
[1:23] times and so we thank the Lord for that
[1:25] he God brought him through a heart
[1:28] surgery this list last year and
[1:31] sometimes heart surgeries don't don't
[1:34] leave us with a lot of strength but we
[1:36] sure glad to have you with us here today
[1:38] John and we said we love you with all of
[1:40] our hearts so love each and every one of
[1:42] you didn't it good to be in the
[1:45] household a man I was thinking this
[1:48] morning as I was thinking as we're
[1:50] closing the year down and I was thinking
[1:53] about all the great times that we've had
[1:55] this year the great preachers that have
[1:57] stood behind this sacred desk and
[1:59] preached the Word of God and we've had
[2:01] the best of the best
[2:02] God's been so good to us they've came
[2:05] and preached in convention like
[2:07] atmospheres whether it was normal
[2:09] services or labor day meetings and you
[2:12] as an audience are so pleasurable to
[2:14] preach to I think about that it's kind
[2:17] of almost difficult sometimes for us to
[2:19] go away because this is a convention
[2:22] atmosphere almost every service and so
[2:24] you bring that you're the one coming
[2:28] pulling on the word of the Lord and we
[2:30] thank you for that and as we press
[2:33] towards a new year may it only get
[2:35] stronger and stronger and stronger and
[2:37] we come and we look back at the cycles
[2:40] of a decade or a cycle of a year and and
[2:43] go when we see the ones that have left
[2:46] us and they're Tamron out and they're
[2:48] standing on the other side screaming
[2:50] come on come on come on we didn't lose
[2:53] them we just gained heavens glory and so
[2:55] we want to just so take advantage of the
[2:59] time that we have here thank you for you
[3:01] being here on this morning and we
[3:02] certainly love you with all of our
[3:04] hearts if you will turn with me to
[3:05] Joshua chapter one this morning a man
[3:10] got a note this morning that just
[3:11] encouraged my heart to preach with
[3:13] everything that's in me a precious
[3:16] sister that is calling out for God to do
[3:18] a miracle in her life and
[3:21] and she's already listened to last night
[3:23] service twice this morning amen brother
[3:26] Jeremy and she's a long way away from
[3:29] here but she said that's exactly what
[3:31] she needed she said the doctor has give
[3:34] her up and and we just pray that God
[3:38] would just reach forth today minister to
[3:41] her and take her by the hand in a
[3:44] special way and several others have
[3:46] already wrote me this morning about what
[3:48] last night's meeting meant to them so
[3:50] may today be just as powerful and you
[3:53] might be find this interesting but the
[3:55] other Tim Pruett is preaching on this
[3:58] morning courage we must have the same
[4:01] boss amen he sent me his text this

[4:41] amen how many we do that a man well God
[4:46] bless the rest of you amen how might we
[4:49] do that god bless you amen
[4:52] Joshua chapter one and verse five there
[4:55] shall not any man be able to stand
[4:57] before thee all the days of thy life as
[5:00] I was with Moses so while I would be
[5:03] with thee I will not fail me nor forsake
[5:06] thee be strong and of good courage for
[5:11] under this people doubt something
[5:12] divided for an inheritance the land
[5:14] which I swear into their fathers to give
[5:16] them only be strong and very courageous
[5:19] that thou mayst observe to do all
[5:22] according to the law which Moses my
[5:24] servant commanded thee turn not from the
[5:26] right hand or the left hand left that
[5:29] thou mayst herbs prosper whether so ever
[5:32] thou goest this book
[5:35] the law shall not depart out of the
[5:37] mouth but thou shalt meditate therein
[5:39] day and night that thou mayst observe to
[5:43] do according to all that is written
[5:45] therein for then shalt thou make thy way
[5:49] prosperous and then shalt thou have good
[5:53] success have none I commanded thee be
[5:56] strong and of a good courage be not
[6:00] afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[6:03] Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever
[6:05] thou goest you may be seated may the
[6:08] Lord bless the reading of his word this
[6:10] morning a man hemming is ready to have
[6:13] Church amen any good to us
[6:17] fear is mentioned in the scriptures 600
[6:20] times so it's something that we will
[6:23] have to deal with as mortal beings the
[6:25] scripture tells us that man is born of
[6:28] woman it's few days and it's full of
[6:31] trouble this is the only spot that
[6:33] you're going to have to deal with that
[6:35] Satan's temptations and his trials and
[6:38] his and his mockery and all of that the
[6:41] things that he would come against you
[6:42] with so he knows that he only has a lot
[6:45] of time to do that whether we're born
[6:48] there and and live a week or we live to
[6:51] be a hundred and ten years old sister
[6:53] Nancy's mother's 98 years old it is a
[6:56] body that now has become a body of
[6:59] torment it's the body that has trapped
[7:01] her but one day God will liberate her
[7:04] and give her a brand new body the body
[7:09] that we're going to is a body that don't
[7:11] have any tall or agony or sorrow it'll
[7:14] never be afflicted ever again
[7:16] so Satan realizes that this is the only
[7:19] spot he couldn't get to you in God
[7:21] before the foundation of the world but
[7:24] this is the only time element that he'll
[7:26] ever be able to get to you now we
[7:29] realize in our feeble humanity that
[7:33] sometimes we run out of fuel we run out
[7:36] of energy we run out of desire sometimes
[7:40] sometimes we can't see through the
[7:42] corner next week we don't know how in
[7:44] the world we're going to make it but
[7:46] when we realized that God is inside of
[7:49] us and God is omnipotent
[7:52] he's infinite he's got the whole world
[7:55] in his hands sometimes we can't see kind
[8:02] of we want to we want to have a faith to
[8:05] word that we can see it happening well
[8:08] let's just think about the faith that
[8:10] God has he spends a world into existence
[8:14] and he tosses his on his fingertips and
[8:18] and he hangs it in midair and it's never
[8:25] lost a revolution and when he's spinning
[8:30] in midair it's the only plan in our
[8:33] celestial zodiac to which it's got life
[8:37] on it
[8:39] are you with me of all the millions of
[8:42] stars that that God just spend into the
[8:44] universe this is the only one that's got
[8:46] life are you with him it makes a good
[8:49] conspiracy theory that there's more
[8:51] urgency and there's this one that and
[8:53] that and that and that but this one
[8:55] seems to be the only one that's got love
[8:57] and God spoke it into existence and
[9:00] spend it and he hung it on nothing so if
[9:06] God could do that what about God being
[9:10] able to take care of you he said one day
[9:18] Adams race had been backed into a corner
[9:21] the law had failed justice had failed
[9:24] the prophets had failed the judges had
[9:27] failed everything that God said to the
[9:29] earth had failed and Adams race stood
[9:33] defeated sickness among them death among
[9:36] them everything the death orison in
[9:38] every place nothing could be done but in
[9:42] heaven there was one that stepped out
[9:45] the Son of God and said this day I give
[9:49] my life for Adams race the Angels asked
[9:52] him what would you do what would you do
[9:55] he came to he came to earth and he
[9:58] looked upon a
[9:59] juh men and women that wanted to serve
[10:01] the Lord they couldn't they couldn't let
[10:06] me just say there was a time in my life
[10:07] I wanted to serve God but I couldn't
[10:09] I've made vows I made promises that I
[10:12] could and I just seemed to be falling
[10:14] back in the same rut over and over and
[10:16] over again but when you finally made
[10:19] Jesus are you with me he makes the
[10:24] difference in your life
[10:26] [Music]
[10:28] so much temptation so much sin so much
[10:32] sickness so much troubles on every hand
[10:35] everything had failed and he looked tell
[10:38] the darkest spot of man's fear that was
[10:41] death it's always been our greatest fear
[10:44] was death and he ran to Calvary and got
[10:47] the thickest bunch of spears and throwed
[10:49] them into his heart and cried back take
[10:51] what I leave and the baptism of the Holy
[10:54] Ghost and fight the scripture says this
[10:59] is when the enemy shall come in like a
[11:04] flood and he's ever felt like he came
[11:08] your way when the enemy shall come in
[11:11] like a flood the Spirit of the Lord
[11:13] shall lift up a standard against him
[11:21] John 19 10 we mentioned this last night
[11:24] then set the decide palette unto Him
[11:27] speakers down not unto me down down
[11:30] knowest thou not that I have power to
[11:33] crucify thee and power to release thee
[11:36] that was a mortal man looking at Jesus
[11:39] thinkin I had power to kill you I have
[11:43] power to give you life
[11:46] are you in me and without God God gave
[11:50] him the oxygen to breathe just sometimes
[11:57] you need to look at the ones that are so
[11:58] tormenting you and just and all of their
[12:02] their vocals and all of their cursings
[12:05] and other making funds just laugh at it
[12:08] it is my God that gives you strength it
[12:13] is my God that gives you the oxygen to
[12:15] breathe that you're cursing with and
[12:21] jesus answered thou could us have no
[12:24] power and all against me except it were
[12:27] given thee from above therefore he
[12:31] delivered me unto thee hath the greatest
[12:37] sin the scriptures of the mark chapter
[12:41] 16 in verse 15 which is the final
[12:44] commission and he said unto them go ye
[12:47] into all the world and preach the gospel
[12:49] to every creature and he that believeth
[12:52] and is baptized shall be saved and he
[12:56] that believeth not shall be damned
[12:57] notice this now and these signs shall
[13:00] follow them that believe in my name
[13:03] shall they cast out Devils they shall
[13:05] speak with new tongues they shall take
[13:07] up serpents and if they drink any deadly
[13:09] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[13:12] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[13:15] recover Ezekiel chapter 10 and verse 4 I
[13:24] believe it is I rise for this matter
[13:26] belongeth unto thee we also will be with
[13:30] thee and be of good courage and do it

[21:56] hallelujah
[21:58] I was identified with him hanging on the
[22:00] cross I was identified him when they
[22:03] beat him until he was unrecognizable as
[22:06] a human being and put a plat of thorns
[22:08] on him
[22:09] and a robe around him that would stick
[22:11] to his body and then later pull it off
[22:13] I was identified as he walked up the
[22:15] hill and they spit on him and and they
[22:17] mocked him and they called him every bad
[22:19] name in the world
[22:21] I'm proud to be identified with Jesus
[22:24] Christ you talking about courage it took
[22:37] courage godly courage that every person
[22:43] in the world seemed to be against him
[22:46] every municipality and government was
[22:48] turned against him and they were
[22:50] screaming for Barabbas and screaming
[22:53] that he would be crucified but he was on
[22:55] a mission and he would not be turned
[22:59] around I want you to know I'm on a
[23:01] mission I'm on a mission young lady they

[25:57] of laying my mother into the grave and
[26:02] three years ago and her dying words as
[26:09] she was slipping over I'm ready to go
[26:16] because my mother realized this is not
[26:18] the end my mother's not a great headed
[26:23] woman today are you with me she's not
[26:27] great headed woman she doesn't have to
[26:29] worry with her with her ankles and her
[26:31] and her knees and the high blood
[26:33] pressure in the heart condition that she
[26:35] fought for so many years my mom was a
[26:38] fun-loving she listened she wrote every
[26:41] roller coaster in this region and she
[26:46] did it screaming to the top of her lungs
[26:49] with her mouth wide open and her smile
[26:53] was from the air to here she was full of
[26:56] life she loved her family she loved her
[26:59] grandchildren she loved God with all of
[27:02] her heart has not diminished the same
[27:16] scripture that said he will raise up his
[27:19] body gives us authority power in the
[27:25] name of Jesus Christ cast out Devils and
[27:29] speak with no tongues and they'll take
[27:32] up serpents and drink any deadly thing
[27:34] it will hurt them if they lay hands on
[27:37] the sick they shall recover
[27:43] possessing the enemy skates he said he'd
[27:46] died till the Sun got ashamed of itself
[27:48] he died until nature got ashamed and it
[27:51] failed to operate the Sun went down in
[27:53] the middle of the day the stars wouldn't
[27:55] even come out
[27:55] he died until the elements were so black
[27:58] until you couldn't see your hand in
[27:59] front of the middle of the day
[28:00] I'd imagine nature said let me die with
[28:03] him brother the devil sent his place his
[28:05] soul into the bottomless pits of Hell
[28:08] and the gates open but when he came out
[28:11] on that third day he conquered it his
[28:14] seed shall possess the gates of the
[28:16] enemy he conquered death he conquered
[28:19] hell and on Easter morning he conquered
[28:23] the grave
[28:33] I'd like to report to you as Christian
[28:36] believers you can go to our champions
[28:40] tune it's still empty it's still empty
[28:46] it's a place where he laid he didn't
[28:50] mean to bite he didn't need to bite he
[28:54] just needed to borrow it hallelujah he
[29:00] wasn't gonna lay there but just a couple
[29:03] of days
[29:03] I like hello could not hold my champion
[29:09] [Applause]
[29:12] Muhammad Ali was a mighty champion Mike
[29:16] Tyson was a mighty champion but one day
[29:20] they meet there there in a man Napoleon
[29:24] was a mighty champion Alexander the
[29:27] Great was a mighty champion Caesar
[29:29] Augustus was a mighty champion not going
[29:31] to mention George Washington was a
[29:33] mighty champion but all of them with me
[29:36] death but when my Jesus met death it was
[29:43] only a portal that he would step through
[29:46] to go get Abraham Isaac and Jacob and to
[29:49] get the keys of hell and fame it to take
[29:54] the sting up yes we got to fear it no
[29:59] more Isaiah 54 says behold I have
[30:14] created the Smith that blow at the coals
[30:16] in the fire there bringing forth an
[30:19] instrument for his work I created the
[30:24] waster to destroy sometimes you just
[30:29] need to wreck tell the devil that is
[30:31] fighting against you hold on just a
[30:33] second you couldn't even create yourself
[30:41] brother Homer loved that little story
[30:43] about you know all the scientists
[30:48] gathered together and telling God that
[30:50] they could create the earth so they had
[30:53] a conversation with God we can do what
[30:57] you did
[30:59] we can create an earth and God said get
[31:03] you own dirt yeah it's your own dirt
[31:21] that devil that torments you he's on the
[31:25] time clock I'm not but he is he's coming
[31:34] to an end that's what he don't like
[31:36] about you you're gonna live when he now
[31:44] live and he don't exist

[32:01] end I want you to get it tell the devil

[32:28] God you are secure as Jesus is secure
[32:37] Lord glory my brother walked into a
[32:45] company in Missouri and he had to hear a
[32:49] job one time it was called a hatchet job
[32:51] to worry that he went to company sin and
[32:55] he would go on inconspicuously and be
[32:59] the man that was getting ready to clean
[33:01] the company out and so one day he went
[33:04] into this company in Missouri and he was
[33:07] walking through and they was giving him
[33:09] a terrible time for being there they
[33:11] talked to him viciously they gave him a
[33:15] horrible time that day you see he was
[33:18] there he was like an art angel unaware
[33:22] he was picking them a new precedent he
[33:27] was picking them a new boss over the
[33:29] whole thing and his job was to get rid
[33:33] of all the top-notch and at the end of
[33:38] the day all those guys that gave him a
[33:40] hard time they was all sitting in a
[33:43] great big room and he said today you had
[33:47] an opportunity you actually had a job
[33:50] interview and you that gave me a hard
[33:56] time are out of a job
[34:02] pack your bags and go home I'm having
[34:15] way too much fun with it because I can
[34:19] see all across this audience I wish God

[34:27] people and I want him to go in their
[34:28] office to call Church what about you God

[34:45] job glad I didn't have it
[34:49] are you with me those companies are
[34:52] prosperous but they were bankrupt at
[34:54] that point and he went in and got rid of
[34:56] the dirt Oh hallelujah that's what Jesus
[35:00] did he went that into hell and he took
[35:05] the keys to the kingdom and he's going
[35:11] to tell the devil I don't need you no mo
[35:13] I don't need you I'm trying to get you
[35:23] to get something I'm taking this analogy
[35:25] to get you to get something he's

[41:08] don't fault Devils I've seen people come
[41:10] out of wheelchairs I've seen cancers
[41:12] delivered the dead raised some of the
[41:16] worst heathen in the world come and be
[41:18] real sons and daughters of God I've seen
[41:24] the worst of the worst raised up out of
[41:27] the galleys and the gutters and homeless
[41:29] situations have become real sons of God
[41:31] and become active members presidents of
[41:34] companies and become top-line citizens
[41:40] of the United States and and China and
[41:43] overseas I've seen people rise from the
[41:46] dire and become presidents of their own
[41:48] companies
[41:57] I've seen God do incredible things
[42:00] absolutely sovereign incredible things I
[42:04] stood with a man in China and we were
[42:07] standing in a little loose place and it
[42:09] was just a narrow place and he had a
[42:11] misson said the head that had literally
[42:14] fell apart for years over and over again
[42:16] and he had put incredible amount of
[42:18] energies decades of energy into this
[42:20] business and he's work and he's an
[42:22] incredible worker and if you saw his
[42:24] hands you can see the calluses on his
[42:26] hands and he's a real servant of God if
[42:28] you if you needed a cup of water he'd
[42:30] run to the moon to get you a cup of
[42:32] water if he had to he's a kind of a
[42:36] fella that's right there with you picked
[42:37] up your bag I preached I preached around
[42:40] him and listened he I've never carried
[42:43] my bag around I'm not asking you to do
[42:44] that but if I'm if I'm walking to a
[42:46] pulpit he'll grab my bag and carry my
[42:48] back

[42:54] just a moment I feel the Holy Ghost I
[42:58] said God wants to bless your business
