[46:38] i believe that that just at any moment
[46:41] the coming of the lord is very near i
[46:44] believe the atmosphere is
[46:46] charged with the coming of the lord and
[46:49] we're here seeking
[46:50] seeking him this morning just wanting to
[46:52] draw closer to him
[46:54] and in every way possible amen let's
[46:57] just go to the lord in prayer this
[46:59] morning
[47:00] amen amen heavenly father we
[47:04] so love and appreciate you this morning
[47:07] what a mighty god that you
[47:08] are lord of the many mighty wonderful
[47:12] acts that we
[47:13] witnessed last night lord with our own
[47:15] eyes
[47:16] lord i personally feel the effects of
[47:19] even the angel's
[47:21] presence lord even now lord jesus and
[47:25] many many effects will go throughout
[47:27] this life
[47:28] just like a just like a rock when it
[47:30] hits the water
[47:32] it begins to send out an effect of where
[47:34] it came from
[47:36] lord last night there was a rock of
[47:39] testimony that went forth
[47:42] and i believe that the the ripple effect
[47:45] is driving away all things from your
[47:47] people
[47:48] lord not just now but in the coming days
[47:51] father i pray that you would bless your
[47:52] people

[47:59] pastor that you would restore it back to
[48:00] him lord

[48:11] word and begin to pour out your
[48:13] revealed word of this hour lord i pray
[48:16] god that you would just come in a very
[48:17] special way this morning
[48:19] may we see you high and lifted up every
[48:21] need amongst us
[48:22] every need on the other side of the
[48:24] internet lord

[48:30] situation you're our high priest

[48:34] take complete supreme control of this
[48:36] situation

[48:40] may every word that be spoken
[48:42] be anointed by you now father we submit
[48:44] ourselves under the
[48:46] work of the lord just now in jesus name
[48:48] we pray
[48:49] amen man if you have your bibles this
[48:52] morning we'd like to look over in the
[48:53] book of hebrews chapter 11 verse 6
[48:56] just one one scripture reading this
[48:59] morning for yourselves
[49:03] but i'd like to i'd like to speak to you
[49:05] this morning on the atmosphere
[49:08] of the supernatural
[49:12] and i've been studying along these lines
[49:16] for many for many months now and you've
[49:18] actually heard a bit of it through
[49:20] through the the ministry and preaching
[49:22] of the word
[49:24] and just been building up some things
[49:25] and then
[49:27] then how the lord led and brother ron
[49:29] yesterday
[49:31] feeling uh to have the prayer line and
[49:33] then to look at these things on the
[49:35] atmosphere of the supernatural i just
[49:36] love how god
[49:38] lays out his work amen
[49:42] and i have to say uh you could line up
[49:45] things in your own human mind and how to
[49:48] set up a meeting of different things but
[49:49] i love it when the lord comes behind
[49:53] and brother branham said in the
[49:55] supernatural he said any person that
[49:56] ever
[49:57] came that come into the atmosphere one
[50:00] time will never be satisfied nowhere
[50:02] else
[50:04] one time in his atmosphere will never be
[50:07] satisfied
[50:08] nowhere else amen hebrews 11 and verse 6
[50:12] but without faith it is impossible let's
[50:15] say that together
[50:16] impossible to please him for he that
[50:19] cometh to god
[50:20] must believe that he is and that he is a
[50:23] rewarder
[50:24] of them that diligently seek him
[50:28] let's read that last part together that
[50:30] he is a rewarder of them
[50:32] that diligently seek him may god bless
[50:34] his word you may be seated
[50:36] in the presence of the lord
[50:40] we know that that no man cometh to god
[50:42] except god
[50:43] first draws him and we we know that that
[50:47] that is one of the
[50:48] greatest things or one of the first
[50:49] things that must be done in worship is
[50:51] that you must
[50:52] recognize that that he is god
[50:56] it is the first thing that is required
[50:58] in worship and you find that throughout
[51:00] the bible that god has
[51:01] laid out his handiwork and laid out who
[51:04] he is all the way down throughout the
[51:06] the old testament and the new testament
[51:08] even over in deuteronomy chapter 6 and 4
[51:11] he would say hero israel the lord our
[51:14] god
[51:14] is is one lord and before you can ever
[51:17] come to god you see he's got to do the
[51:20] drawing but he that comes
[51:22] must believe that he is and when you
[51:25] come to him you've got to believe that
[51:27] he
[51:28] is the self-existing one that he is the
[51:30] one that does
[51:31] all things and controls all things and
[51:33] what faith does
[51:35] is faith is faith is a substance of
[51:37] things hoped for it is the evidence of
[51:40] things
[51:41] not seen but faith breaks us from this
[51:43] world or
[51:44] in this realm of humanity into a world
[51:47] of
[51:48] into a world of faith and into an
[51:50] atmosphere where
[51:51] all things are possible you see in this
[51:54] world that we live in and in this
[51:56] atmosphere we live in there are a lot of
[51:58] things that are going on and
[51:59] even right now and different things but
[52:01] faith will take you
[52:03] into a heavenly sphere what faith does
[52:06] it transports you
[52:07] from this ground where where things are
[52:10] reasoned out it transports you from this
[52:12] ground where
[52:13] where things are seen and things are
[52:15] things are felt where things are sensed
[52:17] but faith takes you
[52:19] higher into a different world and even
[52:21] an astronaut when you begin to study and
[52:23] watch how an astronaut
[52:25] it what does it do it takes this world
[52:27] because he cannot live
[52:29] in that world but he has to take this
[52:31] atmosphere
[52:32] here up there so that he can live in it
[52:36] and you so that astronaut is built he is
[52:38] taking a trip
[52:39] and it's transporting him into another
[52:42] world and that's what faith
[52:43] is doing for the believer it takes him
[52:46] from this world
[52:47] into another world but something that is
[52:50] different from the astronaut and you
[52:52] is that you are built to live in the
[52:55] world
[52:56] of faith there's a lot of people that
[52:57] can't live up there there's a lot of
[52:59] chickens they can't fly where eagles fly
[53:02] at but you were built to fly into that
[53:05] atmosphere
[53:06] now there's a lot of people that can't
[53:07] follow you into that atmosphere
[53:09] there's a lot of there's a lot of
[53:11] there's a lot of so-called or carnal
[53:13] believers that cannot
[53:14] follow the eagle where he goes but that
[53:17] eagle is a special built
[53:19] board of a bird that he has built to go
[53:21] up there
[53:22] and you know that you'll find that if
[53:24] you go to studying out eagles that
[53:25] eagles
[53:26] are a special built bird they're a
[53:28] heavenly bird they're
[53:29] they're testified throughout and laid
[53:31] throughout the old testament that
[53:33] that god even likes his prophets
[53:36] unto eagles that they're able to soar up
[53:38] into another level
[53:39] but you know that eagles actually mate
[53:42] in the sky
[53:43] you so so you see when you begin to
[53:45] watch that ego as he's
[53:47] going up into that atmosphere and if you
[53:49] get up in that atmosphere
[53:51] you'll realize real quick that you're
[53:53] not hooked up with a chicken up there
[53:55] but you're hooked up with somebody else
[53:57] that was built up there and if i want
[53:59] you to know this morning
[54:01] that if you get in that atmosphere one
[54:03] good time you'll find out that you're
[54:05] not hooked up with some denominational
[54:07] creed
[54:07] or some ideology but you're built up and
[54:10] hooked up and made it up with somebody
[54:12] that was built to take you up there
[54:15] because you are a special people that's
[54:17] ordained for the atmosphere
[54:19] of the supernatural and this this faith
[54:22] what it does it takes you from a realm
[54:25] of natural
[54:26] into a realm of the supernatural and we
[54:29] know and realize that the presence of
[54:31] god
[54:31] is essential for the supernatural to
[54:34] ever take place
[54:35] before there can ever be one miracle
[54:37] happen he's got to be present before
[54:40] there can be
[54:40] one change in your life he's got to be
[54:43] present before
[54:44] there could be one particle that fills
[54:45] these pews he's got to be present
[54:48] and what faith is doing it's taking you
[54:50] into an atmosphere
[54:52] where you were destined to be at he is
[54:55] the one that controls and
[54:57] understands and all of these wonderful
[54:59] works that he's doing he's the one
[55:01] that is controlling these things and
[55:02] breaking them over our life
[55:04] and the bible said when when you go to
[55:06] reading over in job chapter 37 when eli
[55:08] you became
[55:09] and he started talking to job and verse
[55:12] 14 he said
[55:13] hearken unto this old job stand still
[55:16] and consider the wondrous works of god
[55:18] dost thou not know when god disposed
[55:21] them and caused the light of this cloud
[55:23] to shine dost thou know the balancing of
[55:26] the clouds the wondrous works of him
[55:29] which is perfect in knowledge and here
[55:32] we look and we have a we have a very
[55:34] difficult
[55:35] life balancing out the different
[55:37] situations that come by our way the
[55:39] different trials
[55:40] but here god is able to hold on to those
[55:43] clouds
[55:44] and even though they're setting up there
[55:46] in that atmosphere
[55:47] and they're full of rain and they're
[55:49] full of buckets of water
[55:51] but god is able to balance it out so
[55:53] that they don't fall out of that
[55:55] atmosphere
[55:56] you see god so designed it that the
[55:58] cloud would stay where it was destined
[56:00] to stay at that the
[56:02] rain would hold in its pocket until god
[56:04] gets a time of release so
[56:06] and i want to tell you this morning get
[56:08] your rain barrels ready
[56:10] god has got the balancing of the cloud
[56:13] hanging over top of you this morning
[56:15] and i'm telling you to get your rain
[56:17] barrels ready god's getting ready to
[56:19] pour out a blessing upon you
[56:21] that you can't hardly handle and when he
[56:23] pours it out
[56:24] you can shake it down press together
[56:26] god's gonna do it
[56:28] because he's the one that controls the
[56:30] atmosphere this morning
[56:31] and your faith is moving into a realm
[56:34] even now where the spirit of god
[56:36] is present to come down that's why it's
[56:39] so important
[56:40] to enter into worship as the song leader
[56:42] is coming forth
[56:44] and bringing songs he's breaking the
[56:46] yoke of bondage
[56:48] by the power of music and god so annoys
[56:51] musicians and and song leaders that they
[56:54] can come in and sing a sweet song or a
[56:57] song of victory and it'll lift your
[56:59] faith into an atmosphere
[57:01] but you've got to believe that all
[57:03] things are possible
[57:04] no matter whether it's sinner or saint
[57:07] you've got to believe
[57:08] before you can ever begin to receive and
[57:11] when you go to look
[57:12] over in hebrews chapter 11 you will see
[57:14] that the
[57:15] that chapter is filled of people and
[57:18] characters of the bible
[57:19] that believed god trusted god obeyed god
[57:23] but do you know that the word faith was
[57:26] only found twice throughout the whole
[57:28] entire old testament
[57:30] you see they didn't have a bible to go
[57:32] by like you got
[57:33] they didn't got tapes to go by like you
[57:36] got but yet they knew how to find god
[57:38] they knew how to seek god they knew how
[57:40] to obey god they know how to find god
[57:43] and you realize that that this person
[57:46] that is diligently seeking after god
[57:49] they will go to any length any length at
[57:52] all to find god and obey
[57:54] his word it's like you and i if we would
[57:56] if we would lose our keys or lose our
[57:58] wallet
[57:59] we would go on to a search party we'd
[58:02] send out our family looking for
[58:03] something
[58:04] and when we find them the search is over
[58:07] but it's different when you go to
[58:08] seeking after god
[58:10] you can find god but yet they're still
[58:12] for more god for you to discover
[58:14] there's still more attributes of him for
[58:17] him to display in your life
[58:18] he's wanting to pour himself out and
[58:21] reveal himself
[58:22] like never before i want you to know
[58:24] that you can never grow
[58:25] tired on searching for god and seeking
[58:28] for god
[58:29] and if you have faith in the almighty
[58:32] god and accept this word
[58:34] you won't ever turn it loose for the
[58:36] bible told us in hebrews 10 and 23
[58:39] to let us hold fast the profession of
[58:41] our faith without
[58:43] wavering for he is faithful that promise
[58:47] that's what god is looking for is for
[58:49] somebody that won't waver off of the
[58:51] promises
[58:52] of the word there was a man that came to
[58:55] brother branham one time that had
[58:56] came from all the way from arkansas and
[58:58] brother branham was holding a meeting
[59:00] there
[59:00] i believe it was in memphis tennessee he
[59:02] was holding a meeting there
[59:04] and they this young this this man his
[59:06] girl was dying
[59:07] and she she was dying from pneumonia and
[59:10] the doctors
[59:10] told her told the dog the dad that she
[59:13] only had three
[59:14] hours to live and the man kept the daddy
[59:17] kept persistently asking
[59:19] brother branham to come and he kept kept
[59:22] asking him and he said well i can't
[59:23] leave this meeting i can't come right
[59:25] now
[59:25] i can't leave it but finally brother
[59:27] branham agreed to go
[59:30] and out on the road brother branham was
[59:32] going had some people that was driving
[59:33] him
[59:34] and brother branham said i was praying
[59:36] and the angel of the lord sat in the car
[59:38] with me
[59:39] just for a little piece and he said say
[59:41] to this
[59:42] say this to him thus saith the lord that
[59:45] waters
[59:46] are running clear ahead that's my word
[59:48] to give to him
[59:49] and brother branham said he went into
[59:51] the hospital room and he asked the
[59:53] parents if they would promise to serve
[59:55] god
[59:56] and to testify of him and what he is
[59:58] going to do and he said then thus saith
[1:00:01] the lord
[1:00:02] your girl is healed and three days later
[1:00:05] that little girl
[1:00:06] returned back to school now here's what
[1:00:09] he said he said
[1:00:10] but when the angel of the lord speaks
[1:00:12] like that there's nothing
[1:00:14] that can stand before it
[1:00:17] you see then then it's absolutely my
[1:00:20] faith well i know it's going to happen
[1:00:22] there's
[1:00:22] there's no need of saying anything more
[1:00:24] about it it's got to happen
[1:00:27] and he said if that person had been dead
[1:00:29] and in the grave for 20 years
[1:00:31] he'd say go there and speak he said i
[1:00:33] believe that all of heaven would shake
[1:00:35] out of its orbit
[1:00:36] before that prayer would ever be refused
[1:00:39] from being answered
[1:00:40] because god will do it that's when it's
[1:00:42] thus safe the lord
[1:00:44] so i what i'm trying to get this this
[1:00:46] this illustration or this event
[1:00:48] is that because a daddy wouldn't let go
[1:00:51] because a daddy would stay there
[1:00:53] persistently
[1:00:54] asking the prophet he would stay there
[1:00:57] and he was afraid to lose his daughter
[1:00:59] he was afraid to lose his loved one and
[1:01:01] so he put his faith into action
[1:01:04] and then the word that was spoken became
[1:01:06] god
[1:01:07] into action oh hallelujah and
[1:01:10] them that diligently seek him that's
[1:01:13] what i'm trying to get to you
[1:01:14] is that you got to go to seek him before
[1:01:17] the rewarder will come
[1:01:20] are you with me abel offered to
[1:01:22] sacrifice by
[1:01:24] faith he did but he had this testimony
[1:01:26] that he went on and his
[1:01:28] uh his offering was accepted enoch had
[1:01:30] this
[1:01:31] faith and it was he was not he was
[1:01:34] translated
[1:01:34] noah had this faith abraham had this
[1:01:37] faith
[1:01:38] but then the rewarder came after he
[1:01:41] sojourned in a strange land
[1:01:46] by faith isaac by faith jacob by faith
[1:01:49] joseph
[1:01:50] then the rewarder came the rewarder
[1:01:54] comes
[1:01:55] on the other side of the faith
[1:02:00] your prophet said give me a preacher
[1:02:02] give me a christian give me a housewife
[1:02:04] that's a christian
[1:02:06] give me a farmer a factory worker
[1:02:07] that'll put god first in everything
[1:02:13] in everything and i'll show you a man
[1:02:16] that'll be successful in spite of all
[1:02:18] that the devil can put on him
[1:02:20] he seeks god first i want you to think
[1:02:21] about that's more than just a quote
[1:02:23] that's more than just just something
[1:02:25] that somebody said but here's a prophet
[1:02:27] of the lord
[1:02:28] saying this that though that you give me
[1:02:31] this person
[1:02:32] you give me a housewife that's sitting
[1:02:33] right here in this house today
[1:02:35] sitting right here a farmer or a factory
[1:02:37] worker how many factory workers we got
[1:02:39] sitting here
[1:02:42] how many construction workers we got
[1:02:44] sitting here how many electricians we
[1:02:45] got sitting here
[1:02:46] you know your opposition you know you're
[1:02:49] you know what you do as a
[1:02:50] as an official or as a worker but you
[1:02:53] show me somebody
[1:02:54] that'll put god first and i'll show you
[1:02:57] somebody
[1:02:58] that'll be successful in spite of all
[1:03:00] that the devil puts on them
[1:03:02] go put them through the trials of life
[1:03:04] he's the one that balances the clouds
[1:03:06] and holds the reigns you show me
[1:03:08] somebody that knows how to seek
[1:03:11] god put him first above all things above
[1:03:13] their money
[1:03:14] above their health above their family
[1:03:17] above all things because they diligently
[1:03:19] sought him
[1:03:20] and i'll show you somebody that'll be
[1:03:22] successful
[1:03:23] that'll be successful in the kingdom of

[1:03:30] worker that'll be successful as a
[1:03:32] christian

[1:03:36] i'll show you somebody
[1:03:37] that the devil don't know what to do
[1:03:39] with because they
[1:03:41] put god first
[1:03:45] ah hallelujah
[1:03:49] proverbs 7 15 says therefore came i
[1:03:52] forth to meet me

[1:05:11] and all these other things will be added
[1:05:14] i am positive sure this morning if men
[1:05:16] and women could get on
[1:05:18] could only get in that position of where
[1:05:20] their soul their thinking their
[1:05:21] attitudes
[1:05:22] would be perfect in the sight of god
[1:05:24] that would be one of the most powerful
[1:05:26] churches
[1:05:28] that have ever existed that's what you
[1:05:31] ought to do is give them your best
[1:05:33] give them your best of your life give
[1:05:34] giving the best of your songs
[1:05:36] give him all of your talent give him
[1:05:38] everything you got give him your feet
[1:05:40] give him your hands give him your eyes
[1:05:42] give him your mouth give him your ears
[1:05:43] give him your soul
[1:05:44] give him your heart give him your praise
[1:05:46] give everything you got hallelujah
[1:05:48] he's deserving of the best
[1:05:53] you believe that this morning now the
[1:05:55] bible says over in second peter 1 and 10
[1:05:59] that wherefore rather brethren give
[1:06:01] diligence
[1:06:02] we understand what it means to be
[1:06:04] diligent don't we
[1:06:06] all right give diligence making your
[1:06:09] calling
[1:06:10] and your election sure
[1:06:13] you must you must be called
[1:06:17] or you will be defeated
[1:06:21] are you with me until you know these
[1:06:23] things you will be
[1:06:24] defeated you can come up against the
[1:06:27] enemy on your own and you'll be defeated
[1:06:29] but one time knowing who you are
[1:06:34] satan won't know what to do with you
[1:06:35] what is it it's because of where you're
[1:06:37] living at
[1:06:39] it's because of what you know who you
[1:06:41] are
[1:06:42] he said but if you do these things
[1:06:45] you shall never fall
[1:06:53] if you do these things you shall never
[1:06:55] fall well you say brother angel i just
[1:06:57] keep falling
[1:06:58] have you come through this line but if
[1:07:01] you do these things you shall never fall
[1:07:03] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[1:07:06] unto you
[1:07:07] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[1:07:10] of our lord and our savior jesus christ
[1:07:15] because you made your calling sure
[1:07:18] there has been an entrance made i want
[1:07:20] you to hold that before you this morning
[1:07:22] that there has been an entrance into his
[1:07:25] glory
[1:07:26] because you made these things joy and i
[1:07:28] want to say it to you like paul would
[1:07:30] say
[1:07:31] that in ii corinthians verse 14 but
[1:07:34] thanks unto god which
[1:07:35] always causes us to triumph in christ
[1:07:39] and making manifest the savior of his
[1:07:41] knowledge by
[1:07:42] every place in every place but i want
[1:07:45] you to know that there is a door open
[1:07:47] unto you that nobody else can walk into
[1:07:51] but the believer i want you to realize
[1:07:55] if you could set it before your
[1:07:56] imagination just now
[1:07:58] that there is a door to all the
[1:08:00] blessings of god
[1:08:01] that is set before the believer and you
[1:08:04] will not fall
[1:08:05] and you will not fail to get in that
[1:08:07] door because so
[1:08:08] an entrance has been ministered unto you
[1:08:12] and i want to preach to the church of
[1:08:13] the living god this morning
[1:08:15] that there's an entrance standing right
[1:08:17] here that there's an atmosphere
[1:08:19] that you are born to live in and all you
[1:08:22] got to do is take the steps of faith
[1:08:25] and walk right up to that door and you
[1:08:27] can knock down
[1:08:28] every devil that stands in your way
[1:08:31] tuberculosis can't hold you
[1:08:33] pneumonia can't hold you covered can't
[1:08:36] hold you
[1:08:36] you are ordained you're not going to
[1:08:39] fall off this way
[1:08:40] or fall off that way you're going to
[1:08:42] make it because
[1:08:43] god said i'm going to make a triumph of
[1:08:45] entry and you're going to have it
[1:08:47] by the abundance of almighty god come up
[1:08:50] here a little higher
[1:08:51] [Applause]
[1:08:55] i'm opening a door for you this morning
[1:08:58] some of you come through that line last
[1:09:00] night asking for the blessings of god
[1:09:01] i want to tell you that the blessings of
[1:09:03] almighty god on the other side of this
[1:09:05] entrance
[1:09:10] what a powerful thought for so an
[1:09:13] entrance
[1:09:14] hasn't been made but to think about that
[1:09:17] this atmosphere that we speak of
[1:09:20] that satan is the prince of the power
[1:09:24] of the air and he controls the
[1:09:26] atmosphere
[1:09:28] you remember when brother ron was
[1:09:29] speaking about it last night that daniel
[1:09:32] daniel had prayed and he stood there for
[1:09:35] 21 days
[1:09:36] and the prince of persia had resisted
[1:09:39] him
[1:09:40] had resisted michael from coming to his
[1:09:43] knee
[1:09:43] but this was what the angel said
[1:09:47] but i heard you the first time that you
[1:09:49] caught
[1:09:51] before you could ever get to the door he
[1:09:53] was already there
[1:09:55] now satan might be trying to hold him
[1:09:57] back but the angel came by your way
[1:10:00] and last night as i was standing there i
[1:10:03] watched the angel of the covenant
[1:10:06] come and open up a door and says enter
[1:10:09] in
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:13] but here he has controlled the
[1:10:16] atmosphere
[1:10:17] since the garden of eden since man was
[1:10:21] condemned
[1:10:23] and committed to sin all the heavens
[1:10:26] were shut off from mankind
[1:10:28] and satan being the prince of the power
[1:10:30] of the air
[1:10:31] you remember when isaiah said how art
[1:10:34] thou fallen o lucifer
[1:10:37] here was the one that had blocked up and
[1:10:40] controlled
[1:10:41] the atmosphere and no man was able to
[1:10:44] break in or understand where that power
[1:10:47] is
[1:10:48] over that atmosphere because that's what
[1:10:50] atmosphere means or heaven means
[1:10:53] it means the heavens or the atmosphere
[1:10:56] above and all of these powers was shut
[1:11:00] off because of sin
[1:11:02] that atmosphere that you're living in
[1:11:04] was shut off
[1:11:06] that atmosphere was held off because
[1:11:09] there was sin that was committed
[1:11:11] and though that there was sacrifices
[1:11:14] after sacrifices
[1:11:15] boxes and bulls that that had gave their
[1:11:18] life but yet
[1:11:19] man was not able to break in to that
[1:11:22] atmosphere
[1:11:23] because there was not a perfect
[1:11:25] sacrifice yet made
[1:11:27] but there came one that made an entrance
[1:11:30] so that you could go into that world so
[1:11:33] that prayers could break in past that
[1:11:35] atmosphere
[1:11:36] so that sin could be removed from your
[1:11:38] life and when jesus
[1:11:40] died and rose again there ain't never
[1:11:42] been anybody there was some people that
[1:11:44] had died
[1:11:45] lazarus had raised but there ain't
[1:11:47] everybody ascended
[1:11:48] back to where he came from and jesus
[1:11:51] said the son of man
[1:11:52] he is coming and he is ascending
[1:11:55] and here he is for the very first time
[1:11:59] 40 days after his resurrection here he
[1:12:01] is scene of 500
[1:12:03] ascending into heaven and he broke that
[1:12:06] atmosphere
[1:12:07] so that you could go there
[1:12:11] and he broke every veil of sin he broke
[1:12:13] every veil of temptation
[1:12:15] he broke everything that could have been
[1:12:17] broke
[1:12:21] and he made an entrance
[1:12:24] when there was doom that was hanging
[1:12:25] over this earth
[1:12:27] hanging over the atmosphere
[1:12:32] he broke through that
[1:12:35] there was barriers that had to be broke
[1:12:37] so he could get through that thing
[1:12:38] but the blood made a way for him to get
[1:12:42] through it
[1:12:44] for you to come up to him because the
[1:12:46] entrance
[1:12:47] of the word of the lord said you're
[1:12:49] going to come through there
[1:12:57] to think that the atmosphere that you
[1:12:59] even feel now
[1:13:00] that you felt last night the old
[1:13:02] testament prophets
[1:13:04] don't know what this type of atmosphere
[1:13:06] is
[1:13:08] the anointing would come and the
[1:13:10] anointing would go but they never had an
[1:13:12] anointing
[1:13:13] like you got where the anointing would
[1:13:16] come
[1:13:16] and live and reign upon the throne of
[1:13:18] your heart
[1:13:19] and he would not leave you and he not
[1:13:22] forsake you
[1:13:23] but living in this type of atmosphere
[1:13:26] and realizing that you and i are amateur
[1:13:29] gods
[1:13:30] that you and i have the ability to
[1:13:32] create an atmosphere
[1:13:36] you ever been around somebody that's all
[1:13:38] the time all the time happy
[1:13:40] all the time on the rooftop you see they
[1:13:43] have found an atmosphere to live in
[1:13:45] there's some people that don't know they
[1:13:48] don't know which way is up and they
[1:13:49] don't know which way is down
[1:13:51] it's because of the atmosphere that
[1:13:52] they're living what kind of atmosphere
[1:13:55] are you creating if you're always
[1:13:56] bringing about strife and and fusses and
[1:13:59] all kinds of things
[1:14:00] i want you to know that temper breach
[1:14:02] temper and love
[1:14:04] breeds love
[1:14:07] and if you begin to let out some love
[1:14:10] out of your life
[1:14:11] you would start seeing love around you
[1:14:14] but if all the time you're fussing and
[1:14:16] bickering
[1:14:16] and got a temper to fight a buzz saw man
[1:14:20] alive
[1:14:20] you'll never live up here where you're
[1:14:22] supposed to be at but let the love of
[1:14:24] god one time
[1:14:25] come on your soul you'll find an
[1:14:27] atmosphere to live in
[1:14:29] where everybody around you on your job
[1:14:31] say hey hey something different about
[1:14:33] that man
[1:14:39] you and i will never know the effect of
[1:14:42] our atmosphere
[1:14:43] because of our atmosphere car wrecks
[1:14:45] can't happen because of our atmosphere
[1:14:47] jobs and companies are blessed
[1:14:49] because of our atmosphere car wrecks
[1:14:51] can't happen before
[1:14:53] because of our atmosphere restaurants
[1:14:55] are blessed because of our atmosphere
[1:14:57] factories are blessed because of your
[1:14:59] atmosphere there is somebody
[1:15:01] that's sitting beside you maybe an
[1:15:03] unbelief because of your atmosphere
[1:15:06] it so charges them to say hey if they
[1:15:09] can
[1:15:10] live that way i can live that way
[1:15:19] one time one time woodrow wilson went to
[1:15:22] go get a haircut
[1:15:23] he walked in there and he sat down and
[1:15:26] you know how a barber shop set up and
[1:15:28] there's all kinds of men sitting around
[1:15:29] it's a
[1:15:30] it's a great place it's a great place to
[1:15:32] hear some some of the best stories you
[1:15:33] ever heard in your life is that a
[1:15:34] barbershop ain't that right says heather
[1:15:36] you'll find out you'll hear some of the
[1:15:38] best stories that and here woodrow
[1:15:39] wilson walks into a barbershop
[1:15:41] there came a man in that set right
[1:15:43] beside him in the chair beside him and
[1:15:45] he had the same agenda
[1:15:46] that woodrow wilson had and that was to
[1:15:48] get a haircut and when he walked in
[1:15:50] there
[1:15:51] when he walked in there that man he he
[1:15:53] never he never really
[1:15:54] got out and started saying who he was
[1:15:56] but he began he said it wasn't preaching
[1:15:59] he said but the people that were sitting
[1:16:01] there in that barbershop
[1:16:02] were held spellbound by this man that he
[1:16:05] was sitting there and he was
[1:16:06] he was talking he said and woodrow
[1:16:08] wilson said he said i
[1:16:09] felt that when i left there that i had
[1:16:12] just
[1:16:13] left a worship service there were men
[1:16:16] that were sitting there because of this
[1:16:18] man
[1:16:18] and woodrow wilson said he said i sat
[1:16:21] there in my chair and after the
[1:16:23] barbershop
[1:16:24] just after that man left and i watched
[1:16:26] the
[1:16:27] influence of the people how that they
[1:16:29] were still spellbound
[1:16:31] and they were astonished at this man
[1:16:33] because of his speaking
[1:16:34] and that man nobody knew who he was
[1:16:37] nobody knew his name except for woodrow
[1:16:39] wilson
[1:16:40] and here set the white moody in that
[1:16:42] chair
[1:16:43] and because people people realize they
[1:16:45] didn't have to know his name
[1:16:47] but there was an atmosphere with the
[1:16:49] white moody
[1:16:50] that men would sit in a barber chair and
[1:16:53] they felt the atmosphere of the holy
[1:16:55] ghost
[1:16:56] charles finney was a great man of god he
[1:16:58] didn't have a church big enough
[1:17:00] to hold his crowds so he got himself up
[1:17:03] on a second story in a bay window
[1:17:05] and he started preaching the gospel of
[1:17:07] jesus christ
[1:17:08] he preached hell in such a way when men
[1:17:11] were two miles away
[1:17:12] on their way to work they dropped their
[1:17:15] pails of lunch
[1:17:16] boxes and they dropped and gave their
[1:17:18] life to the lord jesus christ
[1:17:20] because the atmosphere of the preaching
[1:17:23] of the word
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:29] you remember when those doctors of
[1:17:30] divinity when they went over there and
[1:17:32] they were seeking after the welsh
[1:17:34] revival
[1:17:35] they were looking where the welsh
[1:17:36] revival was and he was walking down the
[1:17:38] street
[1:17:39] and there was a policeman that had a
[1:17:41] whistle in his pocket
[1:17:42] and he was just blowing it and spinning
[1:17:44] it around his finger and those doctors
[1:17:46] of divinity said
[1:17:47] hey we're looking for the welsh revival
[1:17:49] and that policeman said hey you're
[1:17:51] looking at it
[1:17:52] i am the west revival i've got it in my
[1:17:55] heart
[1:17:55] i went to god this morning that that
[1:17:58] would be the case
[1:17:59] that i am the bride's revival you're
[1:18:02] looking at it
[1:18:03] you ain't got to look for some day gone
[1:18:04] by you ain't got to look for william
[1:18:06] branham
[1:18:07] you're looking at the people of the
[1:18:09] bride's revival
[1:18:17] hallelujah
[1:18:18] [Applause]
[1:18:25] you're looking at it you're looking at
[1:18:28] it
[1:18:29] teachers when you walk into your school
[1:18:32] you're not just some another teacher
[1:18:34] lunch ladies you're not just another
[1:18:36] lunch lady principals you're not just
[1:18:38] another principal
[1:18:40] nurses you're not just another nurse
[1:18:42] you're a child
[1:18:43] of the most high god and there are
[1:18:45] angels that are packed around you
[1:18:48] that are protecting you and leading and
[1:18:50] influencing
[1:18:51] and you're bouncing into them all the
[1:18:53] time
[1:18:58] you watch somebody all of a sudden
[1:19:02] last night was perfect man i'll tell you
[1:19:04] you couldn't set this meeting up no
[1:19:05] better
[1:19:05] but last night i watched people bumping
[1:19:07] into an angel
[1:19:09] and all of a sudden you begin to see
[1:19:10] them break out under the influence
[1:19:13] of the angel what was it they were
[1:19:15] bumping into angels all day long
[1:19:18] and they broke into worship what was it
[1:19:23] he was standing right there the effects
[1:19:26] that you feel
[1:19:27] was because the angel was in the room
[1:19:30] and when the angels in the room
[1:19:32] the waters is troubled and all you got
[1:19:34] to do is step right on in
[1:19:40] you ain't got to wait for a certain
[1:19:42] season you ain't got to wait for another
[1:19:44] prayer line
[1:19:45] you ain't got to wait for another move
[1:19:46] of god let it come this morning
[1:19:49] you ain't got to wait for the preacher
[1:19:51] you ain't got to wait for the deacon
[1:19:53] you ain't got to wait here at church let
[1:19:55] it come in your home
[1:19:59] let it so influence you that you're not
[1:20:02] just having church at church but you're
[1:20:04] having church at home
[1:20:06] that the angels of god feel so welcome
[1:20:09] in your house
[1:20:15] that even in the midst of the worst of
[1:20:17] all the ages
[1:20:19] you can have this testimony that i
[1:20:22] please god
[1:20:42] devil's in for a bad day
[1:20:47] i just got hydrated
[1:20:55] you go to reading over in the bible and
[1:20:57] you begin to see the supernatural
[1:20:59] effects
[1:21:00] of when god comes on the scene it ain't
[1:21:02] just got to be an angel
[1:21:04] it could be a child of god that knows
[1:21:07] that there is a god
[1:21:09] when you go to reading over in second
[1:21:10] kings and you find that there was a
[1:21:12] captain
[1:21:13] a general by the name of lame naaman
[1:21:16] that was
[1:21:16] that was a leper here he was a great man
[1:21:20] here he was a great man in all of his
[1:21:22] stature but because
[1:21:24] of this hidden sin in his life he
[1:21:27] couldn't go to where he needed to go at
[1:21:29] but there was a little girl that had
[1:21:31] been taken
[1:21:32] that had been taken from her home she
[1:21:34] was an alien in another part of the
[1:21:36] world
[1:21:37] but yet she got under the influence of
[1:21:39] the atmosphere and the inspiration of
[1:21:42] god
[1:21:42] and there she spoke up this little maid
[1:21:45] spoke up and said
[1:21:46] i would to god that my servant naman
[1:21:49] was over in the country of samaria where
[1:21:52] there is a prophet
[1:21:54] now there had never been anything in the
[1:21:56] word
[1:21:57] that had spoke about elisha healing
[1:22:00] leprosy
[1:22:00] there ain't never been a word in the
[1:22:03] bible that said anything about elisha
[1:22:05] personally healing anybody
[1:22:06] but this girl was so influenced because
[1:22:09] there was a prophet in the land
[1:22:11] that she knew that there was a god of
[1:22:13] jacob and the god of abraham
[1:22:15] that was with elisha
[1:22:20] and you're gonna read in that chapter i
[1:22:22] believe it's chapter five
[1:22:23] you go to reading that and you'll see
[1:22:26] that naaman sent word to the king
[1:22:28] and the king rin is close you see there
[1:22:30] was a major difference
[1:22:32] in the atmosphere of the king of israel
[1:22:34] than there was
[1:22:35] in the prophet of israel
[1:22:40] what was it this little girl was under
[1:22:42] the atmosphere
[1:22:44] though she was in a foreign land she
[1:22:46] could still testify
[1:22:47] that there was a god that was more than
[1:22:50] able
[1:22:51] i'm not going to get caught up on what
[1:22:52] naaman had to do and to get
[1:22:54] what he had to dip seven times you know
[1:22:56] the story
[1:22:57] but this little girl brother branham he
[1:22:59] said you watched the force of that
[1:23:01] testimony
[1:23:03] the force of that testimony made naaman
[1:23:06] come out of his position
[1:23:08] of hiding that secret sin because of
[1:23:10] that little girl's testimony
[1:23:13] i'd say there's going to be some little
[1:23:15] girls that came through a prayer line
[1:23:16] last night that have a force of a
[1:23:18] testimony
[1:23:20] that they'll look out upon this leprous
[1:23:22] generation that's so full of sin
[1:23:25] that said hey i would to god that there
[1:23:27] would you come to this church
[1:23:29] where the prophet of god is still
[1:23:31] amongst us
[1:23:32] the prophet of the word is still
[1:23:34] discerning the thoughts
[1:23:35] and the intents of the heart i'd say let
[1:23:38] the force of a testimony
[1:23:40] of a child be let loose in this place
[1:23:43] [Applause]
[1:23:44] it don't matter what sin you got in amen
[1:23:47] you can come
[1:23:48] all you got to do is just listen
[1:23:52] i'm talking about a testimony that'll
[1:23:54] make you get up out of your comfort zone
[1:23:56] get up out of what you think is normal
[1:23:58] and run
[1:24:09] i went to god that you come to where
[1:24:12] it's at
[1:24:16] hey some people it's afraid to come into
[1:24:18] a prayer line like last night
[1:24:22] you watch your spirits as they begin to
[1:24:25] get close to that prayer line you watch
[1:24:26] them start backing up
[1:24:29] because they're afraid that they're
[1:24:30] going to get exposed don't you ever walk
[1:24:32] in a prayer line
[1:24:33] with unconfessed sin because the word of
[1:24:36] the lord is still calling out sin
[1:24:39] you watch people that's got things
[1:24:40] hidden in their life you'll watch
[1:24:42] when the spirit of god comes and the
[1:24:44] atmosphere drops into place
[1:24:46] watch what takes place
[1:24:52] when i would be god you come up on up
[1:24:54] here where the water's real running real
[1:24:55] clear
[1:24:56] you ain't got to stay back here from
[1:24:58] devils you ain't got to stay back here
[1:25:00] from spirits
[1:25:00] you ain't got to stay back here you
[1:25:02] ain't got dipped seven times name it
[1:25:04] just come up here one time one time in
[1:25:06] his presence
[1:25:07] and you'll never be satisfied nowhere
[1:25:10] else you go
[1:25:11] when i watched a little girl feed about
[1:25:13] 16
[1:25:14] 17 years old by the name of sister emma
[1:25:16] holmes
[1:25:17] when the angel come into the water he
[1:25:20] began to trouble the water
[1:25:22] you watch the fire of the holy ghost
[1:25:24] fall and that fire in through this
[1:25:26] building
[1:25:27] it's the atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:33] what is it it's the atmosphere of a
[1:25:36] people
[1:25:36] that are believing it's the atmosphere
[1:25:39] of sons and daughters of god
[1:25:40] that are really realizing that all
[1:25:42] things are possible
[1:25:43] when you watch a drunk man that's a
[1:25:46] habitual offender
[1:25:49] every time it comes to a prayer line
[1:25:50] every comes to an altar gets
[1:25:52] drunk on the holy ghost and god speaks
[1:25:54] to him
[1:25:59] you know who you are you get drunk
[1:26:03] and god speaks to you and it renews you
[1:26:05] all over again
[1:26:10] what is it it's the effects of the
[1:26:13] atmosphere
[1:26:14] something's breaking something's
[1:26:16] breaking
[1:26:18] that plane breaks into a into another
[1:26:20] atmosphere
[1:26:21] where it can fly out there and when you
[1:26:23] go into a believing realm
[1:26:26] something begins to break i just got
[1:26:36] done going through
[1:26:38] the book of exodus in the leviticus
[1:26:42] and i've been studying on the tabernacle
[1:26:44] witness in the tabernacle of the
[1:26:45] congregation
[1:26:47] and i got to read i've been studying on
[1:26:50] these things
[1:26:51] and he got to looking over i got to
[1:26:53] looking over how the setup of
[1:26:55] of of the tent was set up and different
[1:26:57] things of how everything was in its
[1:26:58] order
[1:26:59] and there there was the outer courts and
[1:27:02] then the inner courts and then the whole
[1:27:03] these are holies
[1:27:05] and on the outer courts on the outer
[1:27:07] courts was where you had
[1:27:08] where you had the altar where you had
[1:27:10] the altar and there was a
[1:27:12] where the sacrifice was killed and the
[1:27:13] blood was taken out
[1:27:15] and everything was taken out of the
[1:27:16] sacrifice and the horns of the altar are
[1:27:18] there
[1:27:19] and he said but you realize and you can
[1:27:21] go to listen to i believe it's hidden
[1:27:22] life in christ and
[1:27:23] i believe it's 1955 56 you can go and
[1:27:26] listen brother madam if you want to hear
[1:27:27] it on tape
[1:27:28] he goes through those things and there
[1:27:30] there you see on the outside
[1:27:32] on the outer courts all day long it
[1:27:35] could be raining man
[1:27:36] out there but it could also be a bad day
[1:27:38] or it could be a good day out there
[1:27:40] but then you move on up into the inner
[1:27:42] courts there
[1:27:43] is what is called even determined or
[1:27:45] determined
[1:27:46] or termed the holy place and in the holy
[1:27:49] place
[1:27:50] there are three pieces of furniture
[1:27:52] there's the altar of incense
[1:27:54] there's the table of shoebread and then
[1:27:56] there is the seven golden candlesticks
[1:27:58] and you move up where the rain ain't
[1:28:00] falling where you're not having bad days
[1:28:02] but then you move up into that spot of
[1:28:04] sanctification
[1:28:05] but yet there's a smoke that rises up
[1:28:08] and your life gets all smoked up
[1:28:10] but you you see what you're doing you're
[1:28:12] coming from one atmosphere and
[1:28:14] into another atmosphere but the high
[1:28:16] priest
[1:28:17] that is uh that is able to walk into the
[1:28:20] next
[1:28:20] holies of holies into the place where
[1:28:23] only the high priest
[1:28:24] could go once a year he could walk in
[1:28:27] there and you know how he had to be
[1:28:29] dressed right
[1:28:30] how that everything they all had to be
[1:28:32] dipping and running off of him
[1:28:33] and he'd walk into there he'd walk into
[1:28:36] that realm
[1:28:37] and what i want to say to you is that
[1:28:39] when that priest would walk in there
[1:28:41] that that that that you couldn't hear
[1:28:43] anything on the outside
[1:28:46] it was it i believe brother brandon said
[1:28:48] that it was a it was soundproof
[1:28:50] but yet it was built in such a way that
[1:28:53] that when you walked in there and those
[1:28:56] golden bells
[1:28:57] and pomegranates were ringing the people
[1:29:00] on the outside
[1:29:01] would still be able to hear you
[1:29:02] worshiping god just to let them know
[1:29:04] that you weren't dead yet
[1:29:07] and when you got on the inside of there
[1:29:09] there was only one piece of furniture
[1:29:11] in the holies of holies and that was the
[1:29:13] ark of the covenant
[1:29:15] and on the inside of the ark of the
[1:29:16] covenant was an omer full
[1:29:18] of the original manna that fell down on
[1:29:21] the first day
[1:29:22] it was the original manner that fell
[1:29:24] down and every priest when he was
[1:29:26] ordained
[1:29:27] was able to walk into that hole he's a
[1:29:29] holiest and he was able to partake
[1:29:31] of the same original manna that aaron
[1:29:33] and moses ate on
[1:29:35] oh what a type of the day that we're
[1:29:38] living in
[1:29:39] that even in this hour you can walk into
[1:29:42] the same presence
[1:29:43] in the same atmosphere of that same holy
[1:29:46] ghost
[1:29:46] that fell down on the day of pentecost
[1:29:48] and you can partake
[1:29:50] of the good things of god what i'm
[1:29:53] saying to you
[1:29:54] is when you walk into that hole he's a
[1:29:56] holiest you're walking into an
[1:29:58] atmosphere

[1:32:46] and the ark of the covenant was being
[1:32:48] brought in
[1:32:51] the bible said in second chronicles 5 13
[1:32:57] that it even that it came even to pass
[1:33:02] as the trumpeters and singers
[1:33:05] were as one to make one sound
[1:33:10] to be heard and praising and thanking
[1:33:11] the lord and when they lifted up their
[1:33:13] voice and when the trumpets
[1:33:15] and symbols and instruments of music and
[1:33:17] praise the lord say
[1:33:18] for he is good for his mercy endureth
[1:33:21] forever

[1:33:26] with a cloud even the house of the lord

[1:35:29] brother branham said that it's the
[1:35:31] hardest thing to do
[1:35:33] the hardest thing to do is to get people
[1:35:36] into the atmosphere
[1:35:37] of believing
[1:35:41] the hardest thing to do is to get them
[1:35:44] into the atmosphere
[1:35:45] of worship
[1:35:51] wow
[1:35:54] what are you living in when you see
[1:35:57] weekend after weekend

[1:36:03] hear me when you see people that walk
[1:36:06] into church
[1:36:07] and all of a sudden they start breaking
[1:36:09] past
[1:36:11] they're saying i know it's hard to do i
[1:36:14] know it'd be a whole lot easier to sit
[1:36:15] there in my pew
[1:36:16] and look like a bump on a pickle i know
[1:36:18] it's a whole lot easier to stay at home
[1:36:20] and sit on the couch i know it's a whole
[1:36:22] lot easier i know it's a whole lot
[1:36:24] easier for me to
[1:36:25] take a weekend off i know it's a whole
[1:36:26] lot easier but they're breaking past an
[1:36:29] atmosphere
[1:36:30] when a prophet would say it's the
[1:36:31] hardest thing to do you're a people
[1:36:34] that says hey hey i i know how to get
[1:36:37] there
[1:36:38] i i know i know where that door's at
[1:36:44] i know where that door is at and if i
[1:36:47] can just
[1:36:48] walk in there'll be an entrance
[1:36:51] ministered unto me

[1:37:03] let me walk in
[1:37:25] my
[1:37:29] john 4 and 23 but the hour cometh
[1:37:35] and now is
[1:37:39] when the true worshipers shall worship
[1:37:41] the father in spirit
[1:37:43] and in truth for the father
[1:37:46] seek as such to worship him
[1:37:50] god is a spirit and they that worship
[1:37:53] him
[1:37:54] must worship him him
[1:37:58] him in spirit and
[1:38:02] in truth in the patmos vision he says he
[1:38:05] said let me give you another
[1:38:06] illustration suppose you need healing
[1:38:08] what does the word say well we we have
[1:38:11] all read it countless times but did not
[1:38:14] get it in
[1:38:14] the spirit when reading it did we ask
[1:38:17] god for his spirit to teach us the real
[1:38:20] truth of it
[1:38:20] he said if we did we'd call the elders
[1:38:22] confess our sins be anointed and pray
[1:38:24] for
[1:38:25] and that would be that it might not come
[1:38:27] immediately
[1:38:28] but in his spirit it is all over
[1:38:32] there is no other court of appeal god
[1:38:34] will fulfill his words
[1:38:36] oh we need to get in the spirit and the
[1:38:38] things will be done
[1:38:40] don't go through the acts first but get
[1:38:42] in the spirit
[1:38:43] and then go through the acts and watch
[1:38:45] what god
[1:38:46] will do have you ever noticed how the
[1:38:49] world gets in the spirit of things
[1:38:51] that are in the world they go to their
[1:38:53] ball games and their sporting events and
[1:38:55] their dances
[1:38:56] they enter into the spirit of it they
[1:38:59] don't sit there like wall flowers or old
[1:39:01] dried up sticks
[1:39:02] they enter in right into the field of
[1:39:04] things and become a part of things
[1:39:06] but oh how they hate the christians
[1:39:10] for getting in the spirit of god's word
[1:39:12] they call us fanatics and holy rollers
[1:39:15] there is nothing they want to do they
[1:39:17] they won't do
[1:39:18] to show their hatred and disapproval but
[1:39:21] ignore that
[1:39:25] the critic won't matter there
[1:39:28] in his spirit but ignore that you can't
[1:39:31] accept it
[1:39:32] you you can expect it knowing where it's
[1:39:34] coming from but just
[1:39:36] go on and get in the spirit of worship
[1:39:42] oh my it's amazing when you go to a ball
[1:39:46] game
[1:39:47] don't sit there like a bunch of angels
[1:39:51] go to a ball game man alive it's it's 30

[1:43:10] was in the bible when miriam seen that
[1:43:13] all of her demons had been defeated
[1:43:17] she began to dance

[1:43:24] demons being defeated

[1:44:06] enemy and the world

[1:44:13] [Applause]
[1:44:17] now you now you're almost there you're
[1:44:19] just almost there
[1:44:22] but you remember when the prophet
[1:44:27] when you read over in the bible and
[1:44:28] there was three kings
[1:44:30] they had went out to battle that was
[1:44:33] there was a king of edom
[1:44:34] the king of judah and the king of israel
[1:44:37] and they went on this battle
[1:44:38] and they had went a hundred miles
[1:44:40] without water three days
[1:44:42] without water and their their
[1:44:44] jehoshaphat being the only righteous one
[1:44:47] amongst them
[1:44:48] said hey is there not a prophet in the
[1:44:50] land
[1:44:52] and they started making their way to
[1:44:54] where the prophet's at
[1:44:55] let me tell you if you lost the well of
[1:44:58] water of life you need to go back
[1:45:03] you might hate me to say this you might
[1:45:05] be against me to say this
[1:45:07] but before you can ever have the water
[1:45:08] of life to overcome this day you have to
[1:45:10] go back to where the prophet's at
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:14] this prophet has the well of pentecostal
[1:45:17] waters
[1:45:18] that'll bring a refreshing drink to the
[1:45:20] king of kings
[1:45:25] and these three kings took all their
[1:45:27] armies up there
[1:45:28] and they went up there to where the
[1:45:29] prophet was
[1:45:32] and when the prophet seen who was coming
[1:45:35] the bible said he was miffy
[1:45:39] he done got worked up and stood up
[1:45:43] and jehoram come up there the king of
[1:45:45] israel
[1:45:47] he looked at him he said why don't you
[1:45:49] get back down there
[1:45:52] yeah he would come up here for help man
[1:45:54] we'll come up here he said won't you get
[1:45:56] back down there to the gods of your
[1:45:57] mothers and fathers
[1:45:59] if they're so great why don't you get
[1:46:00] back down there if you think they can
[1:46:02] produce a rapture
[1:46:03] if you think they can produce a body
[1:46:05] change why don't you get back down there
[1:46:07] what are you doing up here for
[1:46:09] brother brandon said he doesn't got so
[1:46:11] stood up and worked up
[1:46:13] that he looked over there and said bring
[1:46:14] me a minstrel
[1:46:17] because the prophet knew what it was
[1:46:19] when the music got to play in
[1:46:21] that there was a spirit that came
[1:46:26] might have walked in here miffy at your
[1:46:28] wife i worked up because she made you
[1:46:30] late
[1:46:31] once again but let me bring you a
[1:46:38] menstrual
[1:46:41] and the prophet said that when the
[1:46:43] menstrual began to play
[1:46:44] that the spirit of the lord came and a
[1:46:47] vision broke
[1:46:49] oh if you can let it break in this place
[1:46:52] this morning
[1:46:53] when the music's going forward the hand
[1:46:55] of the lord will move over top of you
[1:46:57] and break down those formal shackles
[1:47:00] down when the spirit of the lord gets in
[1:47:02] the songs again
[1:47:03] when he gets in the praise again when he
[1:47:05] gets into preaching again
[1:47:07] something's about to change
