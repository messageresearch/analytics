[54:41] what a God that we're serving a mighty
[54:44] God who will never fail us or nor
[54:48] forsake us you know because of this

[55:14] and feel like that Satan has won but I
[55:18] want to assure each and every one of you
[55:21] that Satan has not won but Jesus Christ
[55:25] is packing out the victory for every
[55:27] one of you you may feel like you can't
[55:29] have an experience like you would at
[55:31] camp but you can have that same type of
[55:33] experience because you don't have to be
[55:35] a church to get the Holy Ghost I'm proof
[55:37] of that I got the Holy Ghost on the
[55:39] street so you don't have to be in church
[55:41] it's the best place in the world to be
[55:43] but you don't have to be in church to
[55:45] have an experience with the Lord you can
[55:46] be right where you're sitting there in
[55:48] your home and the baptism of the Holy
[55:50] Ghost can come flooding into your soul
[55:52] and so rapture you and anoint you and
[55:55] quicken you he's that kind of a God he's
[55:58] alive today Saints he's alive in every
[56:01] way possible
[56:02] he's not dead you can't keep him in a
[56:05] grave

[56:08] scriptures this bride is a powerful
[56:10] bride that is standing on the safe the
[56:13] Lord I like to sing a song to you today

[1:03:57] Jesus you have your Bibles this morning
[1:04:05] turn with me over to to Matthew chapter
[1:04:09] 27 Matthew chapter 27 and verse 62 and
[1:04:16] then we'll follow right on down to
[1:04:17] Matthew chapter 28 you're turning and
[1:04:23] looking through the scriptures and
[1:04:25] flipping through your Bible there you'll
[1:04:28] find that at this moment that we're
[1:04:30] getting ready to break into that that
[1:04:32] Jesus has done dobbed they've placed him
[1:04:35] in a tomb and we're catching a
[1:04:38] conversation that has taken place
[1:04:40] between the Pharisees and the chief
[1:04:42] priests and Pilate just to give you a
[1:04:46] background to set the set the tone of
[1:04:48] this morning service that these things
[1:04:52] have already transpired the disciples
[1:04:55] Peter has cursed he's denied the
[1:04:59] disciples are saddened but Jesus was
[1:05:05] still Jesus Matthew chapter 27 and verse
[1:05:10] 62 now the next day that followed the
[1:05:13] day of the preparation the chief priests
[1:05:15] and the Pharisees came together unto
[1:05:17] Pilate saying sir
[1:05:19] notice we remember that the deceiver
[1:05:22] said while he was yet alive after three
[1:05:26] days I will rise again command therefore
[1:05:31] that the sepulchre be made sure until
[1:05:34] the third day lest his disciples come by
[1:05:38] night and steal him away and say unto
[1:05:41] the people he is risen from the dead so
[1:05:44] the last error shall be worse than the
[1:05:47] first now notice their their thought
[1:05:49] process in this they know they they call
[1:05:52] this man a deceiver they call this man
[1:05:55] and his followers deceivers and yet
[1:05:57] they're still worried
[1:05:59] yet Jesus is dead but yet there's still
[1:06:01] a worry on the inside of them that
[1:06:03] something could take place say and it's
[1:06:07] still him away and saying to the people
[1:06:09] that he has risen from the dead so that
[1:06:11] the last heir shall be worse than the
[1:06:13] first so they're trying to do some some
[1:06:16] quality control here and control the
[1:06:18] pandemic as it were because you see they
[1:06:21] thought that they had stopped them but
[1:06:23] there notice there are some things that
[1:06:25] are going through their mind that there
[1:06:27] are still some some waves that are out
[1:06:30] there that are that are coming and
[1:06:32] they're doing their best to stop them
[1:06:33] and notice verse 65 Pilate said unto
[1:06:37] them ye have a watch go your way make it
[1:06:41] as sure as you can so they went and made
[1:06:45] the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and
[1:06:48] setting a watch Matthew chapter 28 and
[1:06:53] verse 1 in the end of the Sabbath as it
[1:06:57] began to dawn toward the first day of
[1:07:00] the week Came Mary Magdalene and the
[1:07:02] other Mary to see the sepulchre and
[1:07:04] behold there was a great earthquake for
[1:07:07] the angel of the Lord descended from
[1:07:09] heaven and came and rolled back the
[1:07:11] stone from the door and sat upon it his
[1:07:14] countenance was like lightning and his
[1:07:16] raiment white as snow
[1:07:18] and for fear of him the keepers did
[1:07:22] shake and became as dead man and the
[1:07:26] angel answered and said unto the woman
[1:07:28] fear not ye for I know that you seek
[1:07:32] Jesus which was crucified he is not here
[1:07:37] for He is risen as he said come see the
[1:07:42] place where the Lord lay may God bless
[1:07:45] the reading of the word he may be seated
[1:07:47] this morning he is not here for he has
[1:07:50] risen come and see the place where the
[1:07:54] Lord lay out of me this is the greatest
[1:07:58] day there is throughout the whole entire
[1:08:00] year Easter is a powerful day for most
[1:08:05] of the times on this day there are there
[1:08:07] are there are CEO Christians that are
[1:08:10] actually going to church
[1:08:11] Christmas and Easter only Christians but
[1:08:14] this day is more than just a day it's
[1:08:17] more than just a mark on the calendar
[1:08:19] but this day haunts Hale in a major way
[1:08:21] for this day this day our Lord Jesus
[1:08:25] Christ rose from the dead you know to me
[1:08:29] it's an amazing thing when we as human
[1:08:32] beings begin to we begin to drift off
[1:08:35] into sleep that that when we go then we
[1:08:38] go to nighttime as we go and we prepare
[1:08:41] ourselves to go into into sleep and we
[1:08:44] prepare ourselves that our body can go
[1:08:47] and completely be resting completely but
[1:08:50] yet our mind can still our mind can
[1:08:53] still be racing and constantly moving it
[1:08:55] seems and yet you'll be sitting there
[1:08:58] and you'll be completely still as it
[1:09:00] were but yet your your mind is racing
[1:09:03] and you'll start dreaming all kinds of
[1:09:05] different things and there's some people
[1:09:08] that dream about there's other people
[1:09:10] that never have a dream or maybe only
[1:09:12] dream once in a while and the Prophet
[1:09:15] would tell us about dreams that that
[1:09:17] there's people that dreaming are some
[1:09:19] people that don't dream it and he was
[1:09:21] able to as a man he was able because his
[1:09:23] subconscious and his conscious were so
[1:09:26] cold that's so close that he could look
[1:09:28] as it were and he would be like a dream
[1:09:31] like you have you and I would have a
[1:09:33] dream and it would look and he would be
[1:09:35] able to see that as it is transpiring
[1:09:38] now you and I do not have that perfect
[1:09:40] recall because we're not a prophet but
[1:09:43] here this prophet he was able to see
[1:09:45] those visions because of his
[1:09:47] subconscious and conscious were so close
[1:09:49] and he would tell us that he would tell
[1:09:51] us that there are people that that dream
[1:09:54] of people that don't dream and he said
[1:09:55] there's some people's that their
[1:09:56] subconscious is way back here so they
[1:09:59] never dream and there's some people that
[1:10:01] dream all the time and you can you can
[1:10:04] have those dreams and they become so
[1:10:06] real if you've ever had a dream they
[1:10:08] become so real that they will actually
[1:10:11] cause a disturbance in your mood and
[1:10:15] disturbance in your spirit and the
[1:10:16] disturbance in your in your day-to-day
[1:10:18] activity
[1:10:19] and the Prophet would tell us now
[1:10:21] sometimes we will have dreams that that
[1:10:23] we know then we feel like they're from
[1:10:25] the Lord but brother Branham would tell
[1:10:26] us that dreams aren't accurate and he
[1:10:29] would tell us that you need an
[1:10:30] interpreter to be able to tell you what
[1:10:32] those dreams are but also notice that
[1:10:35] that God has used dreams in many ways to
[1:10:38] communicate his will to men we looked
[1:10:41] through the Bible we can look through
[1:10:42] Genesis and we can see how that how that
[1:10:44] Joseph was a man that was a dreamer and
[1:10:47] he was able to interpret dreams and even
[1:10:50] when when when Jesus was born that that
[1:10:53] Joseph was being warned by a dream
[1:10:55] because Herod was going about and he was
[1:10:58] going to slay to slay the children and
[1:11:01] so God warned him by dream so God works
[1:11:05] through dreams there even pilots wife
[1:11:07] she had she was she had a dream and
[1:11:10] right before right before Jesus came
[1:11:12] into pilot's judgment Hall she had a
[1:11:15] dream and she went and proclaimed this
[1:11:17] testimony that then she said I suffered
[1:11:20] many things because of this man and she
[1:11:23] said have nothing to do with him now you
[1:11:26] see what this dream was to pilots wife
[1:11:29] it was a string of grace to pilot to
[1:11:33] warn him to have nothing to do with this
[1:11:35] man Jesus but because of his position
[1:11:38] and because of where he was and his
[1:11:40] hardened heart that he would do the
[1:11:42] things that he'd done now you can have a
[1:11:44] dream at some times IIIi am personally a
[1:11:47] dreamer my dad sees visions but I'm a
[1:11:49] dreamer but there's sometimes I dream
[1:11:51] dreams that I've know they're not from
[1:11:53] God but sometimes I do have dreams that
[1:11:56] I know they're from God and the reason I
[1:11:57] can tell the difference is because the
[1:11:59] atmosphere that comes with the drink but
[1:12:02] also I an realize as a human being that
[1:12:04] Satan can anoint your dreams that Satan
[1:12:07] can come in and he can cause you because
[1:12:09] you are in a spot of peace and it's when
[1:12:12] you are off your guard as it were and
[1:12:14] you're laying there and you're sleeping
[1:12:16] and you begin to dream something that
[1:12:19] there's no way possible that you would
[1:12:21] dream up you dream up something that you
[1:12:23] were sitting down and at a dinner table
[1:12:26] eating carrots with a purple rabbit
[1:12:28] there's no way that you would dream up
[1:12:30] something like that but
[1:12:31] yet the enemy will come and make you and
[1:12:33] make you dream things that you would
[1:12:36] never hear there's things there's people
[1:12:37] that dream up murders and dream up all
[1:12:39] types of things and you would never
[1:12:41] dream something like that as a believer
[1:12:43] but because you are in that that state
[1:12:46] of sleep that Satan can come in through
[1:12:49] your reasoning it can come in through
[1:12:51] your affection and he can come in
[1:12:53] through through the access and he can
[1:12:55] work in that path of memory as it and
[1:12:58] and he would work through there and he
[1:13:00] can trouble you in your dreams now he's
[1:13:04] working and he'll cause disturbances
[1:13:06] because you've had a dream he'll cause
[1:13:09] fear and you cause anxiety and I was
[1:13:11] reading an article and I I'm going over
[1:13:14] these things and I'm very prepared to
[1:13:16] preach these things on Easter whether
[1:13:17] here or whether I was at camp so I'm
[1:13:19] delivering this to you this morning but
[1:13:21] I was reading an article and I found it
[1:13:23] amazing that old Fox News that they had
[1:13:26] an article about people that were having
[1:13:29] a these coronavirus nightmares because
[1:13:34] of the fear that is involved with this
[1:13:35] virus that people are actually getting
[1:13:38] so shook up that it messes up their
[1:13:41] spirit it messes up their day-to-day
[1:13:43] activity it messes up everything that
[1:13:45] they're going about they're depressed
[1:13:47] they're distraught they're they're tore
[1:13:49] up they don't know what to do and these
[1:13:51] dreams have become so affected that
[1:13:53] they're having nightmares and it's not
[1:13:56] just in the thing about these nightmares
[1:13:57] are saying is that sometimes a nightmare
[1:14:00] we'll just be once in a while but people
[1:14:02] are having reoccurring nightmares
[1:14:04] because of this virus and you see that's
[1:14:07] how Satan does he anoints in your dreams
[1:14:10] when you can't even get to you I've had
[1:14:12] to deal with believers on this that
[1:14:14] they're having nightmares and that
[1:14:16] having dreams and fear and anxiety
[1:14:18] because of this virus that is going on
[1:14:20] but you see this night these nightmares
[1:14:23] they will drive you into having a
[1:14:26] reoccurring nightmare I remember as a
[1:14:28] young child as I remember I remember
[1:14:31] vividly that I would have this
[1:14:33] reoccurring nightmare night after night
[1:14:36] and I would dream that I was in church
[1:14:38] and there I was going down to the altar
[1:14:42] and there was this great big bowling
[1:14:44] ball
[1:14:45] and it came and it knocked me down
[1:14:46] before I could get to the altar and I
[1:14:49] continuously I would have that as a
[1:14:51] child and have it as a young adult but
[1:14:53] on that day when I met Jesus Christ that
[1:14:56] nightmare was destroyed you see because
[1:14:59] you see Satan was trying to stop me from
[1:15:02] getting to Jesus but Jesus was on his
[1:15:05] way you see a nightmare also a nightmare
[1:15:10] is also it is called a bad dream it is
[1:15:14] an unpleasant dream that can that can
[1:15:17] cause strong and emotional response from
[1:15:20] the mind typically because of fear or
[1:15:23] despair or anxiety and great sadness
[1:15:26] comes along with nightmares and there's
[1:15:29] a difference between nightmares and bad
[1:15:31] dreams specifically people when they're
[1:15:34] dreaming they remain asleep during bad
[1:15:37] dreams but whereas with a nightmare
[1:15:39] they're awakened they're awakened from
[1:15:42] it and they after a nightmare that
[1:15:43] person cannot go back to sleep they're
[1:15:46] awakened out of a star and out of that
[1:15:48] state and in distress and they're unable
[1:15:50] to go back to sleep to return to sleep
[1:15:54] for a short period of time now notice in
[1:15:57] your sleep there's five different cycles
[1:15:59] of other the sleep pattern and then a
[1:16:02] normally a person that dreams is
[1:16:04] dreaming within the first 90 minutes of
[1:16:06] their sleep but yet you'll have a dream
[1:16:11] that only lasts milliseconds but it
[1:16:14] feels like it's lasted the whole night
[1:16:16] long you're sitting there you're dealing
[1:16:19] with those dreams and it's only less
[1:16:21] than milliseconds and it's happening
[1:16:23] whether in the first 90 minutes of your
[1:16:25] sleep or the last 90 minutes of your
[1:16:28] sleep and what the what scientists say
[1:16:31] is that they call this sleep REM sleep
[1:16:33] it's rapid eye movement where your eyes
[1:16:35] are constantly moving and during that
[1:16:38] REM sleep your brain is almost as active
[1:16:42] as when you were awake and in this phase
[1:16:45] of sleep when you go into this phase of
[1:16:48] sleep actually you will start breathing
[1:16:50] at a total faster pace
[1:16:53] become fast and an irregular and that's
[1:16:56] when nightmares become so vivid and
[1:16:59] they're so vivid that they can be
[1:17:01] recalled years later maybe you haven't
[1:17:06] had that dream maybe you had a drink 20
[1:17:08] years ago but you can still recall that
[1:17:10] dream because of the effect that it had
[1:17:14] he remembers a child that you would have
[1:17:17] a nightmare and you would have to go to
[1:17:19] your parents and have to speak with them
[1:17:21] and the parent would console you and say
[1:17:23] everything's gonna be all right it was
[1:17:24] just a dream
[1:17:25] now there's also things of nightmares
[1:17:28] but there's also a thing that is called
[1:17:30] night terrors and I individuals mostly a
[1:17:33] child deals with night terrors and they
[1:17:36] deal with these things at a very early
[1:17:38] state of life and it's in it's a very
[1:17:41] it's a very traumatizing thing for a
[1:17:43] parent because your child looks awake
[1:17:47] but yet they're shaking they're they're
[1:17:50] screaming they're tired they're
[1:17:51] disturbed and you can't do nothing to
[1:17:53] console them but they'll just fall back
[1:17:56] to sleep
[1:17:57] but it takes it takes hours sometimes of
[1:18:00] dealing with these things dealing with
[1:18:02] these things of my little girl Ally
[1:18:04] she'll still wake up sometimes and have
[1:18:06] a night terror and it's and it's
[1:18:08] bothersome to you and they don't
[1:18:09] actually call something in your own
[1:18:11] spirit you didn't have the dream or you
[1:18:13] weren't going through the night terror
[1:18:14] but yet as a parent you could feel for
[1:18:17] them and you want it to break them out
[1:18:19] of it now you see the thing about
[1:18:21] dealing with a nightmare is that when
[1:18:24] you're actually in that dream you know
[1:18:26] you know sometimes that you're dreaming
[1:18:29] and you think now if I can ever get
[1:18:33] myself shook enough and wake up I'll
[1:18:35] break myself out of this nightmare and
[1:18:37] you're and you'll be able to you'll be
[1:18:40] able to collect yourself and bring
[1:18:41] yourself back to a spot but to wake up
[1:18:46] and your nightmares are a reality oh
[1:18:53] what a horrible thing so today by the
[1:18:57] help of the Lord I'd like to speak to
[1:18:59] you on this Easter morning on Satan's
[1:19:02] worst nightmare
[1:19:05] you see Satan is God's archenemy he's
[1:19:08] the opponent to God and I could imagine
[1:19:11] this as 2000 years ago is as Satan as
[1:19:18] he's watching all of these things
[1:19:20] transpiring he's watching Jesus as he's
[1:19:25] being betrayed by one of his closest
[1:19:27] friends Judas as all of these things are
[1:19:30] happening there's these things are
[1:19:33] transpiring and Satan is getting ready
[1:19:35] for bed on Thursday night two thousand
[1:19:37] years ago and it goes and he and he goes
[1:19:41] and he lays down and all of a sudden
[1:19:45] there's a scream running out through
[1:19:47] hell and all of a sudden that demons
[1:19:51] come a-runnin down to the master and
[1:19:53] they say master what's taking place his
[1:19:57] home I could he could imagine as Satan
[1:19:59] himself as there trembling and he's
[1:20:01] shaking and he's dealing with this thing
[1:20:03] is that I just had the awfulest
[1:20:06] nightmare
[1:20:07] what was it master well I dream that
[1:20:12] this man Jesus that then he went to the
[1:20:16] cross but yet I was defeated and he was
[1:20:22] victorious you can imagine this I can't
[1:20:25] see a demon being a car a counselor but
[1:20:28] you can imagine as the demons of Hell go
[1:20:30] to their masters hello it was just a
[1:20:33] dream Satan don't let that bother you
[1:20:36] you see you I've been the master of
[1:20:39] defeat and you have won the victory and
[1:20:42] defeat all throughout eternity as it
[1:20:45] were through the time and the space of
[1:20:47] time this man is just another man don't
[1:20:51] worry about it he's just another man
[1:20:55] so Satan drifts back off to sleep and on
[1:21:00] Friday morning Jesus goes the pilots
[1:21:03] judgement Hall they have a trial and
[1:21:06] Pilate scourges him he takes the cat of
[1:21:09] nine tails and Satan said now I see it
[1:21:13] was just a dream it was just a dream
[1:21:16] that night
[1:21:17] and he start beating Jesus and it's
[1:21:21] ripping the skin off of him and Satan
[1:21:25] starts to smirk a little bit and say no
[1:21:27] I was just a little bit disturbed in my
[1:21:30] sleep Jesus goes and he and they put him
[1:21:35] on a cross and they nail him to the
[1:21:38] cross and he starts smiling said yes it
[1:21:42] was just a dream
[1:21:45] they put Jesus in a tomb and he says oh
[1:21:49] it was just a dream
[1:21:50] they put Jesus they wrapped him in the
[1:21:54] clear in the fine linen and Satan says
[1:21:57] oh it was just a dream but this man
[1:22:01] Jesus was more than just a man you see
[1:22:05] he had said when he was walking with his
[1:22:08] disciples and he told them he said you
[1:22:11] destroy this temple and in three days
[1:22:13] I'll raise it up again and everybody
[1:22:17] thought what he's just a man he's just
[1:22:20] another deceiver just another false
[1:22:22] prophet but what they did not realize is
[1:22:26] that he looked like a man when he was
[1:22:29] crying he looked like a man when he was
[1:22:31] being beat he looked like a man when
[1:22:34] they took the cat-o'-nine-tails and beat
[1:22:36] him he looked like a man when he was
[1:22:38] hanging on a cross he looked like a man
[1:22:40] when they put him in the tomb they
[1:22:42] looked like a man when they're after
[1:22:44] were fine linen but they did not realize
[1:22:46] that this was more than just an ordinary
[1:22:49] man this man was God himself embodied in
[1:22:54] human flesh hallelujah brother and said
[1:23:00] I can notice how everything and the
[1:23:03] soldiers are there and laughing and
[1:23:06] making fun now see you see it's daylight
[1:23:08] nothing's happened yet and they was
[1:23:11] going on see he was just a deceiver he's
[1:23:15] just a man like a lot of these deceivers
[1:23:17] that has rose up in the last days and
[1:23:19] other days and been done things but and
[1:23:21] made these claims but then all of it or
[1:23:25] wants
[1:23:26] can imagine all the little birds and the
[1:23:28] Robins quit singing and the birds
[1:23:30] stopped singing and the poet said his
[1:23:32] voice is so sweet to leave in the birds
[1:23:35] Huss their singing
[1:23:37] something was fixing to take place I can
[1:23:41] see the great morning star hanging
[1:23:42] yonder in its socket who had hung there
[1:23:45] since the beginning of time begin to
[1:23:47] move I can see it it take her circle and
[1:23:50] marry them watching it what's it doing
[1:23:52] it's an angel and it's looking around
[1:23:55] for the grave where they had laid him
[1:23:57] you see the scripture was ready to be
[1:24:00] fulfilled they were worried how they
[1:24:03] were going to move it but the scripture
[1:24:05] was ready to be fulfilled brother sister
[1:24:08] whenever a scripture of God is ready to
[1:24:10] be fulfilled
[1:24:11] don't you worry it'll be right there I
[1:24:14] can see that star take its journey
[1:24:16] moving around and I can see the Romans
[1:24:18] standing there and a hundred of them
[1:24:21] strong with their swords drawed saying
[1:24:24] now we'll see what takes place and all
[1:24:27] of a sudden this great fireball come
[1:24:29] flying from heaven stood by the grave
[1:24:31] and it turned out to be the mighty angel
[1:24:33] of God who stood there the soldiers
[1:24:36] faded and dropped like dead men on the
[1:24:38] ground with just the breasts of his hand
[1:24:40] he moved it back the stone that was laid
[1:24:43] and broke the Roman seal what does a
[1:24:46] Roman seal mean to him no more than a
[1:24:48] seal of the United States would mean or
[1:24:50] anything else you see or a seal of some
[1:24:53] church or anything else God has to live
[1:24:56] he has to come out he can't live among
[1:24:59] the dead so he moves back the stone when
[1:25:02] it rolled back in here he stood there
[1:25:04] and now who's taken over the soldiers
[1:25:07] grabbing the shields and things and
[1:25:09] running as hard as they could go down
[1:25:11] through there through the guard and down
[1:25:13] over the hill and the clanking of their
[1:25:15] material and the iron that was on them
[1:25:17] and their shields and things and there
[1:25:19] he stood alone and the Bible said in
[1:25:22] Matthew 28 and 4 that the keepers became
[1:25:25] his dead man you seek God when God comes
[1:25:28] he brings comfort to his servants when
[1:25:30] he told him to fear not but he brings
[1:25:33] terror to his enemies you see the
[1:25:36] resurrection of Christ is sub
[1:25:38] of the terror to to to the service of
[1:25:41] sin but is a subject of consolation to
[1:25:45] the sons of God hallelujah
[1:25:47] and for fear the keepers did shake and
[1:25:51] tremble these were not just ordinary men
[1:25:53] these men were Roman soldiers that were
[1:25:56] courageous they were veterans in the
[1:25:58] army but when they had seen terrible
[1:26:00] sights they had seen murders they had
[1:26:03] seen all types of calamity by an being
[1:26:05] on the battlefield they had to be men of
[1:26:08] courage but when this angel came and
[1:26:11] rolled away the stone these courageous
[1:26:13] men became trembling and shaking in fear
[1:26:16] and raining off recover they could not
[1:26:19] dream up that this man this man was more
[1:26:23] than just a man you could say that Hales
[1:26:25] worst nightmare was taking place that
[1:26:28] the royal seed was rising on that day
[1:26:31] four thousand years of death four
[1:26:34] thousand years of men dying and claim
[1:26:36] the sting of death would claim the
[1:26:38] victory but on Easter morning he proved
[1:26:42] that he was more than a man he proved
[1:26:44] that he was he was he wasn't only the
[1:26:46] word but he was God himself
[1:26:48] the dynamics in the word hallelujah if
[1:26:53] you've ever watched a good fight and you
[1:26:56] can watch that underdog as he is in that
[1:26:58] fight and there's always a turning point
[1:27:00] in a fight you can watch at it they can
[1:27:04] be blow after blow blow after blow but
[1:27:06] there is a turning point in every
[1:27:08] contest no matter what style of sport it
[1:27:11] is there's always a turning point and
[1:27:14] when they were putting the crown on
[1:27:16] Jesus head it looked like they were
[1:27:19] winning when they put the nails in his
[1:27:22] hand it looked like they were winning
[1:27:23] but on Easter morning all of the turning
[1:27:27] points all of that wrath of God was
[1:27:30] turned upon them and turned upon hail
[1:27:32] because I have power to lay my life down
[1:27:35] and power to race again he turned and
[1:27:39] proved what he said he is Easter Easter
[1:27:42] is not a day Easter is my Jesus come on
[1:27:46] somebody you can shut down the church
[1:27:47] you can shut down politics you can shut
[1:27:50] down the world
[1:27:51] but you can't shut down God you can shut
[1:27:55] down you can shut down the religions of
[1:27:57] the world but you won't shut down God
[1:27:59] and you are a part of him he cannot stop
[1:28:03] you hallelujah you may think I'm off my
[1:28:08] rocker a little bit this morning but
[1:28:10] demon powers go to sleep demon powers go
[1:28:15] to bed if you don't believe me I'll read
[1:28:20] you a quote for it
[1:28:21] prophet said I don't sleep very much at
[1:28:23] night always in prayer or nighttime is
[1:28:27] when all the demon powers shut down they
[1:28:30] shut down towards the morning when
[1:28:33] they're not roaming that's the time that
[1:28:38] the Holy Spirit moves in and talks to me
[1:28:41] go early if you want to pray rise up
[1:28:45] early he said I think I think a minister
[1:28:47] up they come to the platform not loaded
[1:28:49] down with a lot of care but out of the
[1:28:52] freshness of the presence of the Lord
[1:28:54] get out early of a morning after all the
[1:28:57] demons have gone to bed and that's the
[1:29:02] night rallies are about over and then it
[1:29:04] settles down and quiets and he smelled
[1:29:07] that sweet aroma in the sweetness and I
[1:29:09] can believe if a minister would just
[1:29:11] stay before God until he come into the
[1:29:14] pulpit he'd come as sweet smelling
[1:29:16] savior anointed with the Holy Spirit to
[1:29:18] bring the message of God to the hungry
[1:29:20] hearted people were awaiting so you see
[1:29:23] he'll has to go to sleep
[1:29:25] he'll would like to tell you that it's
[1:29:28] always there tormenting you but he'll
[1:29:30] has to go to sleep there's only one God
[1:29:33] and as I'm not pressing he's not leaving
[1:29:36] his phone he's not shook up but he's
[1:29:39] there watching over you are you with me
[1:29:42] the angels of God are encamped about
[1:29:44] them when you're sleeping I when you're
[1:29:46] awake he's still there who but you can
[1:29:51] imagine the hail the moment that that no
[1:29:55] news started spreading but the SOE n was
[1:29:59] up you could imagine the panic inhale as
[1:30:02] everything was transpiring
[1:30:04] the hell the nightmares that they had
[1:30:06] had the night when they were sleeping
[1:30:08] was transpired hell was running around
[1:30:11] running under panic Satan said I am he
[1:30:14] got the keys to my old hats he was
[1:30:16] running around he didn't know what to do
[1:30:18] and they thought now this is just a
[1:30:21] nightmare I can do something if it's
[1:30:23] only one man but for 40 days Hale had
[1:30:26] the same reoccurring nightmare he is
[1:30:29] still alive
[1:30:33] he'll say well maybe somebody won't tell
[1:30:35] it maybe nobody to tell that he's alive
[1:30:38] maybe nobody to tell that he raised from
[1:30:40] the dead we can handle this we can do
[1:30:42] quality control and handle these things
[1:30:45] if it's just one man but on the day of
[1:30:48] Pentecost come on somebody was more than
[1:30:52] just one man it was not another Jesus it
[1:30:55] was the same Jesus that rose up from the
[1:30:58] grave and it went from one man to 120
[1:31:01] then it spread from 120 to 5,000 hell
[1:31:06] was all shook up whoo everything that
[1:31:11] they had vividly seen in their
[1:31:13] nightmares was coming to pass in front
[1:31:15] of them you see the enemy knew the enemy
[1:31:21] knew that what the Pharisees of the day
[1:31:23] was not going to move them theology will
[1:31:26] not move a demon he'll stay right there
[1:31:28] in this place because he knows that
[1:31:30] education will never lead you to a birth
[1:31:33] and that is why Satan is constantly
[1:31:35] trying to drive drive his intellectual
[1:31:38] conceptions down your throat and make
[1:31:41] you take an intellectual gospel but you
[1:31:44] see it as long as you're receiving
[1:31:46] education as long as this message is
[1:31:48] nothing but just pictures and books and
[1:31:51] things on a wall if all that is to you
[1:31:54] the demons of Hell will stay right there
[1:31:56] in their place but when the demons of
[1:31:59] Hell go to watching the manifestations
[1:32:01] of the Holy Ghost being manifested hell
[1:32:04] gets all hot and bothered they get all
[1:32:06] stirred up because they have seen this
[1:32:09] same Jesus do those works as he's doing
[1:32:12] right now he was doing the same works mm
[1:32:15] years ago on the shores of Galilee he'll
[1:32:18] get stirred up when you start serving
[1:32:20] God and the manifestation of the Holy
[1:32:22] Ghost drops down into your life he
[1:32:25] realizes that it's not just Easter in
[1:32:27] one man
[1:32:28] it's Easter in the body it's Easter in
[1:32:31] the people hallelujah brother Branham
[1:32:38] said in acts of the Holy Spirit he said
[1:32:40] brother you just let something on the
[1:32:43] phenomenal side start and watch how
[1:32:46] every rogue counted Hill would go to
[1:32:48] hollering at him craving blood true he
[1:32:52] says I tell you Peter preached the
[1:32:53] sermon on the day of Pentecost and 3,000
[1:32:57] souls were saved and the devil never
[1:33:01] even moved out of his bed you can
[1:33:07] imagine it hail starts taking a nap and
[1:33:14] Peter Peter comes out and he starts
[1:33:20] preaching to him and you could imagine
[1:33:22] as old diablos himself he's laying there
[1:33:26] and he just rolls over and he says oh
[1:33:31] that's just Peter preaching and he rose
[1:33:34] and he stays right there he didn't
[1:33:38] bother him one bit he didn't bother hell
[1:33:41] one bit you see because there's a lot of
[1:33:45] people that preach there's a lot of
[1:33:47] people that say that that he's the same
[1:33:50] yesterday today and forever but there is
[1:33:52] a people that can prove there's a people
[1:33:56] that can prove that he is what he is and
[1:34:00] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:34:03] forever there's a lot of people that got
[1:34:05] up today and they're having their stream
[1:34:07] and they're having their virtual church
[1:34:09] service just like we're having but there
[1:34:12] is a people that are shutting on the
[1:34:14] inside of their homes when there's more
[1:34:17] than a man sitting there there's an
[1:34:19] omnipotent God the all-powerful one
[1:34:21] that's greater than any sickness greater
[1:34:24] than any disease great
[1:34:25] than any temptation greater than any
[1:34:27] fear there's a God setting on the inside
[1:34:29] of you this message it's not just
[1:34:32] another message it's not just another
[1:34:34] preacher this message is Jesus Christ
[1:34:37] completely restored back to the church
[1:34:42] hallelujah the devil never even moved
[1:34:45] out of his bed he said oh we'll just let
[1:34:48] them alone but notice it he passed
[1:34:52] through the gate called beautiful the
[1:34:53] next day and He healed a man crippled
[1:34:56] from his mother womb and all hell turned
[1:34:58] loose on him that's right and they
[1:35:00] throwed him into jail and kept him there
[1:35:02] overnight put him in the prison the
[1:35:04] inner sail there because the phenomenal
[1:35:07] the devil said I can't let this thing
[1:35:09] get started now the dead now divine
[1:35:11] healing if they do they'll really knock
[1:35:14] my props out from under me
[1:35:15] that's right cuz I might fool them
[1:35:17] around with a little theology once in a
[1:35:19] while but I sure can't fool that real
[1:35:21] thing when it comes and that people see
[1:35:24] it done he said I'll just stop this
[1:35:26] before that other group gets on the
[1:35:28] scene and he never stopped it then and
[1:35:31] they can't stop it now
[1:35:33] that's right God's gospel will move on
[1:35:35] and on and on and when there is no more
[1:35:38] heavens and when there is no more earth
[1:35:40] the word that word will still remain the
[1:35:43] same for heaven on earth will pass away
[1:35:45] but my words shall never pass away there
[1:35:49] is a real genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:35:52] Ghost
[1:35:52] that brings the same results that they
[1:35:54] had on a day of Pentecost you can't fool
[1:35:57] life you can't fool the real thing
[1:36:00] hallelujah Satan had a nightmare 2,000
[1:36:06] years ago and he's still having the same
[1:36:11] nightmare the genuine bride has kept
[1:36:16] hell out of its bed hell has messed up
[1:36:20] you see it looked like he had one but
[1:36:25] Hale lost brother on I feel
[1:36:32] I feel like it I feel like that Mouse
[1:36:34] this morning where's that cat at where's
[1:36:38] that old devil that's coming torment at
[1:36:40] the bride of Jesus Christ where's that
[1:36:42] cat out I've gotten to the stimulation
[1:36:44] of the revelation of this word
[1:36:46] hallelujah hell's messed up hey ain't
[1:36:50] gonna stop us he keeps having nightmares
[1:36:53] after nightmares night terrors after
[1:36:55] night tears and he keeps waking up to
[1:36:57] the same reality that he's gonna lose
[1:37:00] and we're gonna win again and again he
[1:37:05] loses again and again he's defeated if
[1:37:08] you don't mind I'd like to tell you a
[1:37:13] little bit about your title Jesus his
[1:37:18] name is not Emanuel but he fulfilled
[1:37:21] that that God is with us it was just a
[1:37:25] title son is not his name father's not
[1:37:28] his name
[1:37:29] Holy Spirit's not his name at the title
[1:37:32] your name is mrs. Jesus Christ but I'd
[1:37:36] like to talk to you about your title
[1:37:38] today that you are Satan's worst
[1:37:42] nightmare you see in revelation of Jesus
[1:37:48] Christ so then you see why Satan is so
[1:37:50] against the book of revelations anything
[1:37:52] that's revealed spiritual revelation
[1:37:54] Satan is against us that's why he's
[1:37:56] against the ministry today because what
[1:37:58] is it the revealing of Christ let the
[1:38:01] church go over with its great
[1:38:03] denominations and organizations and
[1:38:05] little flowery messages so forth then
[1:38:09] going Satan will bother that they don't
[1:38:11] have no troubles everybody Pat's him on
[1:38:14] the back and when there comes a time
[1:38:16] that God through the Holy Ghost reveals
[1:38:19] Christ back into the church with the
[1:38:22] power and demonstrations of healing the
[1:38:23] sick and making the signs that he said
[1:38:26] he would follow the believers come to
[1:38:28] pass then Satan turns over in his bed he
[1:38:32] does something about it until that time
[1:38:34] Satan don't care how much you church
[1:38:36] join he don't care how much but when
[1:38:38] Christ reveals to you that he is the son
[1:38:40] of God and the works that he did you do
[1:38:43] also not
[1:38:44] other works but the same works you see
[1:38:47] the reason Satan hates revelation is
[1:38:49] because it upsets all of his plans
[1:38:54] hallelujah he don't like it he don't
[1:38:57] like it when you come to church but he's
[1:38:59] not bothered when you just come to
[1:39:01] church and sat there but when all of a
[1:39:03] sudden the Holy Ghost starts revealing
[1:39:05] himself to you
[1:39:06] that's when Hale starts moving out of
[1:39:08] its bed you see because he built his
[1:39:12] charts upon revelation and Jesus said
[1:39:16] the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[1:39:18] against it you see and Jesus speaking
[1:39:21] there in Revelations 3 he said I have
[1:39:24] set before thee an open door and no man
[1:39:27] can shut it what is that open door it is
[1:39:30] the revelation of the supreme deity of
[1:39:32] Jesus Christ what did he say to the
[1:39:35] first church back there in his age he
[1:39:38] said I am he that was which is and shall
[1:39:40] come I am the first and I am the last I
[1:39:43] am the Almighty he said it three
[1:39:45] different times made his self deity to
[1:39:47] the first church here before he went
[1:39:49] into the last church he said I have set
[1:39:52] before you an open door and if you want
[1:39:54] to see the revelation here it is where
[1:39:57] he would build his church and the only
[1:39:59] way that he could take his church is
[1:40:01] back to the revelation of what he is
[1:40:03] that I am the resurrection and life
[1:40:07] and there is a people on earth that is
[1:40:09] working in his name that's breathing in
[1:40:11] his name that's preaching in his name
[1:40:13] and people that are fulfilling the same
[1:40:15] works that have the same life you say
[1:40:23] you have a chip on your shoulder this
[1:40:24] morning brother Andrew yes I absolutely
[1:40:26] do I absolutely have a chip on my
[1:40:29] soldier on my shoulder because I want
[1:40:31] you to realize you need to acknowledge
[1:40:33] you need there and you need to
[1:40:35] acknowledge that there is an enemy that
[1:40:38] is expecting you to be defeated and
[1:40:41] there's an enemy that it's just Darris
[1:40:43] him enough to come and knock that block
[1:40:45] off my shoulder and knock it off your
[1:40:48] shoulder I want you to know that there
[1:40:50] is a people on earth that Hale is afraid
[1:40:52] of Satan is afraid of this ministry
[1:40:55] because it's not just
[1:40:56] another Jesus this is the same Jesus the
[1:41:00] same power same work same Holy Ghost
[1:41:03] same life same oneness and Satan hates
[1:41:07] it when a man knows where he's standing
[1:41:08] that you see when Jesus was standing
[1:41:11] there in Matthew chapter 4 on on Mount
[1:41:14] temptation and Satan came and spoke to
[1:41:16] him and said it is written it is written
[1:41:20] and he ran he spoke to him
[1:41:22] you see Jesus knew where he was standing
[1:41:25] at now Satan knew the scripture better
[1:41:28] than anybody else he could quote it he
[1:41:31] could quote it from cover to cover
[1:41:33] you see he's had a long time on the job
[1:41:37] and he's been watching every move and
[1:41:40] wherever the Word of God is Satan is
[1:41:42] near are you with me you see because
[1:41:47] he's trying to block the move of the
[1:41:50] Holy Spirit but you see Jesus knew that
[1:41:53] he was a predestinated creation of God
[1:41:56] before the foundation of the world he
[1:41:58] knew who he was he knew where he was
[1:42:01] standing yet Satan could quote the word
[1:42:04] to him all he wanted to but he was
[1:42:06] quoting from a spot of knowledge quoting
[1:42:09] from a spot of wisdom but jesus knew the
[1:42:12] word by experience he knew what it said
[1:42:16] about him and he was not afraid to
[1:42:18] fulfill his portion Satan knew it by
[1:42:21] knowledge but jesus knew it by
[1:42:23] revelation and that's the reason the
[1:42:26] Word of God would work through him it's
[1:42:28] because he knew what he was the reason
[1:42:34] why the Word of God will work through a
[1:42:36] body is because the body knows who she
[1:42:39] is the reason why you have miracles
[1:42:42] is because you know who you are the
[1:42:44] reason why you have faith is because it
[1:42:47] has been revealed to you the reason why
[1:42:49] you ever see the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:51] Ghost is because you know who you are
[1:42:54] you've seen your name hallelujah you've
[1:42:57] seen your name there Satan wants to slip
[1:43:02] amnesia over all the people
[1:43:04] make them forget who they are especially
[1:43:07] in moments of crisis that they get
[1:43:11] fearful and get shell shock as it were
[1:43:15] and make you forget your birth make you
[1:43:19] forget your identity make you forget
[1:43:21] your plans make you forget the things
[1:43:24] that are set out before you just like
[1:43:26] the disciples as they were on the road
[1:43:28] to Emmaus and hear Jesus come walking
[1:43:31] and they did not recognize they were
[1:43:35] souls they were so saddened and the
[1:43:38] sheep were so scattered that in the
[1:43:41] moment of crisis they were talking about
[1:43:43] that this is the one that they thought
[1:43:46] would be the Messiah but they were so
[1:43:48] caught up in their fear and so caught up
[1:43:51] in the crisis that they had forgotten
[1:43:53] what he had said that I will go before
[1:43:57] you into Galilee but when they realized
[1:44:01] who he was and realized who they were
[1:44:04] they didn't just lollygag they ran back
[1:44:07] and told everybody hallelujah the church
[1:44:11] is here this is not a continuation of
[1:44:15] just another church but this is a
[1:44:18] continuation of the book of Acts
[1:44:22] hallelujah hallelujah he hates this
[1:44:27] message he hates this word because it
[1:44:29] exposes him it exposes who he is
[1:44:33] he fights this revealing he fights that
[1:44:36] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:44:38] people get the true revelation not the
[1:44:40] true Church and what she is and what she
[1:44:43] stands for that she can do the greater
[1:44:46] works that she will be an invincible
[1:44:49] army you are Satan's worst nightmare now
[1:44:56] I don't understand how everything works
[1:44:58] downhill never been there before no plan
[1:45:00] on going because my god already made a
[1:45:02] deposit for me I don't have to beat
[1:45:04] myself up over my sin because Jesus took
[1:45:07] my sin there I don't understand how
[1:45:09] everything works down in hell I can
[1:45:12] imagine if there is how it is here in
[1:45:15] this earth
[1:45:19] that Satan keeps having this reoccurring
[1:45:21] dream so Satan has to go see a
[1:45:25] psychiatrist
[1:45:29] maybe he lays out on one hand
[1:45:31] funny-looking captious lays back here
[1:45:34] puts his head hands behind his head and

[1:47:34] same one that I thought I had there on

[1:47:42] sudden my demons they come running back
[1:47:45] to him and said hey I thought we had
[1:47:48] powder I thought that we could whip that
[1:47:52] person but out about the middle of the
[1:47:56] day I was warring with them and I was

[1:49:11] the greater works because now it's not
[1:49:13] going just in one person but it's in a
[1:49:15] body it's working in China they may have
[1:49:19] our brothers shut up in prison but it's

[2:03:21] notice your kingdoms coming down we take
[2:03:25] what our Lord and Savior said we believe
[2:03:28] it we receive it and we act upon it for
[2:03:32] he said in John 14 and 12 that he that
[2:03:35] believeth on me the works that I do
[2:03:37] shall he do also and greater works than
[2:03:40] these shall I do because I go unto my
[2:03:42] father and whatsoever you shall ask him
[2:03:46] my name sister Brenda ask it in his name
[2:03:48] that will I do that the father may be
[2:03:51] glorified in the son
[2:03:53] if you shall ask anything in my name I'm
[2:04:11] afraid it covers he's then pulled the
[2:04:14] sheets up he's gonna have to go back and
[2:04:17] make his bed after this sermon if you
[2:04:22] ask anything in my name I will do it
[2:04:28] Oh hallelujah
[2:04:31] it not only defeat Satan back then it
[2:04:35] defeats him right now
[2:04:38] because he sees what's living on the
[2:04:40] inside of you you see what fears him is
[2:04:48] because he has dealt with you before
[2:04:52] he's dealt with the God that's living on
[2:04:56] the inside of your soul before and this
[2:05:00] God that's living on the inside of you
[2:05:02] said that if you abide in me and my
[2:05:05] words abide in you you shall ask what
[2:05:08] you will and it shall be done unto you I
[2:05:13] love this quote is one of my it's one of
[2:05:15] my favorites prophet said in wisdom
[2:05:18] versus faith he said Church of the
[2:05:19] Living God here and on tape do you know
[2:05:22] where you stand
[2:05:22] do you know that you are called of God
[2:05:25] that the Holy Ghost reigns in your heart
[2:05:27] and every word of God is real to you
[2:05:29] oh brother how is how is Satan going to
[2:05:32] stand against that how is he going to
[2:05:34] stop that from go how is he going to
[2:05:36] stop them signs from following why you
[2:05:38] could throw him in jail hey if you could
[2:05:41] I don't care what you do if they're done
[2:05:43] they tried it they rotted in jails they
[2:05:45] was fed the lines they were sold asunder
[2:05:47] they were certain to pieces you can't
[2:05:49] kill him right a church that's
[2:05:51] predestinated those who he foreknew like
[2:05:54] he did Jesus he has called those who is
[2:05:57] called is justified and those who is
[2:05:59] justified is also glorified and
[2:06:01] predestinated and now in these last days
[2:06:03] with every seed sown and everything in
[2:06:06] its order this grown of our sin God got
[2:06:10] out of order and it ain't got the bride
[2:06:12] out order the world everything in order
[2:06:15] the world's in its order the time saved
[2:06:18] up the churches in its order the seed
[2:06:20] even lights the sign of love like he
[2:06:23] said as it was in the days of Sodom an
[2:06:25] angel of God the Holy Spirit coming down
[2:06:27] moving performing the signs that he did
[2:06:29] then Malachi Ford promised that he would
[2:06:32] sin in the last days what he promised
[2:06:34] and we see all of that right there and
[2:06:39] he starts singing that song
[2:06:42] hey man hey man a man a man do you love
[2:06:49] him he says sure sure right here in the
[2:06:59] last days a predestinated Church knows
[2:07:02] where they're standing Satan hates a
[2:07:05] person that knows where they're at sure
[2:07:09] I predestinated Church that knows where
[2:07:12] they're standing sewed with the seed the
[2:07:15] Holy Spirit in the church Satan be
[2:07:20] careful now I have to I have to say
[2:07:24] that's one of my favorites right there
[2:07:25] when the prophet of God has just told
[2:07:29] the realms of Hell that there's a church
[2:07:32] that knows where they're standing
[2:07:34] and he says Satan be careful why because
[2:07:38] he's flesh of his flesh
[2:07:40] she's bone of his bone she's life of his
[2:07:43] life power of his power
[2:07:45] she is him there's a broad that is
[2:07:48] rising out of Scripture
[2:07:50] she spotless she's blameless she's holy
[2:07:53] she's as if she never done it in the
[2:07:55] first place she's higher than any
[2:07:57] Congress higher than any power on earth
[2:08:00] greater than death greater than sickness
[2:08:02] and she is declaring that the head has
[2:08:06] come and what the head is done the body
[2:08:09] will do also the reason why Satan hates
[2:08:12] this word is because it's because this
[2:08:15] word places you in your position it
[2:08:18] tells you who you are and where you came
[2:08:21] from that you always were a son you have
[2:08:24] every right to claim your position
[2:08:26] behold I give you power to tread on
[2:08:29] serpents and scorpions and any but over
[2:08:32] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[2:08:34] shall by any means hurt you
[2:08:36] we have the power to conquer every
[2:08:38] disease every affliction every spirit
[2:08:41] there is no limit to God's power death
[2:08:46] thought it won't
[2:08:50] the disciples were saddened and they
[2:08:55] thought that death had won the sky
[2:09:03] completely shut down the Sun turned its
[2:09:07] back the earth began to quake and the
[2:09:12] Stars stopped shining when the Son of
[2:09:17] God was crucified the veil was rent from
[2:09:23] top to bottom
[2:09:25] the disciples were shook up Mary the
[2:09:31] mother of James Mary Magdalene the one
[2:09:37] that they had thought was the Messiah
[2:09:40] had just died and it looked like death
[2:09:45] had won on Saturday it still looked like
[2:09:52] death had won but the Prophet said that
[2:09:55] there was a rumor that there was a
[2:09:59] rumour that he was the resurrection and
[2:10:02] the life he said all day Saturday
[2:10:06] everybody's still in despair and it
[2:10:08] looked like method 1 the flowers didn't
[2:10:11] seem as pretty the Sun as it begin to
[2:10:15] come back out didn't it seemed to have
[2:10:18] the same brilliance as it did before but
[2:10:22] death had not won because early on
[2:10:26] Sunday morning he rose to prove that
[2:10:30] death had lost its sting
[2:10:35] when the Prophet would stand there when
[2:10:39] he would stand there when the boy had
[2:10:43] Finland had been in that car wreck the
[2:10:46] Prophet said when he realized that this
[2:10:49] was the boy that he'd seen in a vision
[2:10:51] he said you can line up every demon
[2:10:55] spirit you could line up every devil in
[2:10:58] hell
[2:10:58] he said but there was nothing gonna stop
[2:11:01] that vision and he said death you can't
[2:11:05] hold him any loca
[2:11:07] and death had to kick his leave and that
[2:11:10] boy's life had to come back to him and
[2:11:13] that little boy rose up because Jesus
[2:11:16] was proven that he was the resurrection
[2:11:19] and the life and you can line up every
[2:11:22] devil inhaler this morning and there was
[2:11:25] nothing that their Heil had it had all
[2:11:27] of its tactics out it had all of its
[2:11:29] weapons of warfare out but there was
[2:11:31] nothing that would stop it they tried to
[2:11:34] stop Jesus they tried to put a stone on
[2:11:37] and they tried to stop him but they
[2:11:39] couldn't hold him there because a dead
[2:11:41] man a dead man Balilla belongs in a
[2:11:44] grave but a living man belongs on the
[2:11:47] outside you can't keep Jesus locked up
[2:11:51] in denominational creeps in traditions
[2:11:55] of men you can't keep it locked up later
[2:12:00] you can line up every devil and it ain't
[2:12:03] one of them gonna be able to stop this
[2:12:05] bride it ain't one of them gonna be able
[2:12:07] to stop golf for performing this word
[2:12:09] you see it's a true sign that you can't
[2:12:12] stop this you can't stop the move of God
[2:12:15] you can knock us you can beat us you can
[2:12:18] thrill us you can even try to kill us
[2:12:20] but will rise again sister Julia and
[2:12:23] will rise up and say Satan you loose
[2:12:25] Satan has tried to cover us sin is tried
[2:12:29] to stop us sickness has tried to slow us
[2:12:32] defeat has tried to grab victory fear
[2:12:34] has tried to paralyze us pain has tried
[2:12:37] to hurt us cancers tried to kill us
[2:12:40] denominations tried to drown us he'll
[2:12:42] try to find fault with us the key word
[2:12:45] is they tried they tried and they lose
[2:12:48] they lose every time
[2:12:54] what you're looking at is 16 elements
[2:12:59] but on the inside of these 16 elements
[2:13:04] is it God has the power in all heaven
[2:13:09] and on earth and he said that I'll never
[2:13:12] leave you and I'll never forsake you
[2:13:24] I got imagine it as hell gets ready to
[2:13:28] go go to bed tonight and I think you
[2:13:33] know we stopped most of her from having
[2:13:36] Church I kind of feel like it done their
[2:13:39] job there's a lot of people that feel
[2:13:43] like they've been robbed at a Easter
[2:13:44] camp and Hale feels like it's done its
[2:13:47] job
[2:13:49] but what Hale don't realize is that this
[2:13:53] God is packing out the victory they can
[2:13:59] do its very worst but Jesus still wins
[2:14:03] he can try to stop this bride all he
[2:14:06] wants to Satan take your hands off you
[2:14:14] lose again he rose to proof that he was
[2:14:19] the resurrection in the life that he is
[2:14:22] Easter hallelujah
[2:14:26] as the musicians come brother Matthew
[2:14:30] would tell us is him being a police
[2:14:33] officer he would tell us things that
[2:14:35] when they work crashes and if it's if a
[2:14:40] car is on fire her tankers on fire that
[2:14:44] they would use the rule of thumb they've
[2:14:47] had cars on fire that tankers on fire
[2:14:49] they'd use a rule of thumb I got to
[2:14:51] question him I said what is this rule of
[2:14:54] thumb he said well he said you back up
[2:14:56] as far as you can and he said you hold
[2:14:58] up your thumb and he said if you can
[2:15:00] still see this blaze around the edges of
[2:15:04] your thumb back up so how I want you to
[2:15:08] use the rule of thumb you bet back on up
[2:15:10] because the blades just keep getting
[2:15:12] bigger you can try all you want to you
[2:15:16] can try to stop this fire the Holy Ghost
[2:15:18] but this is a fire that will not hurt us
[2:15:22] but it will hurt you it will destroy you
[2:15:26] it will rob you it will kill you it will
[2:15:29] stop you this fire it's a holy fire and
[2:15:33] you can't put it out you can try to
[2:15:35] squirt all your denominational cream
[2:15:37] seeds of water on top of us to try to
[2:15:39] put it out but this flower is a fire
[2:15:42] that came from above and there's a god
[2:15:46] that's back in this body up and if you
[2:15:51] lost 2,000 years ago he'll newsflash
[2:15:55] you lose again rods with me this morning
[2:16:01] again today he stands alive after 2000
[2:16:05] years ago to manifest himself as a
[2:16:07] living Jesus Christ among the royal seed
[2:16:11] of Abraham who are heirs of all things
[2:16:24] they tried to put him in a tomb but a
[2:16:28] tomb couldn't hold him they tried to put
[2:16:32] a Roman seal on him but what's a Roman
[2:16:34] seal to God you may have a loved one
[2:16:39] that's gone by the way in the grave but

[2:23:46] tried to kill me over and over and over
[2:23:50] dia
[2:23:51] you see the Prophet would say that if

[2:26:01] hallelujah that watch is only inside of
[2:26:04] me never had a beginning and never had
[2:26:07] an ending but you knew how will be when
[2:26:13] you are not Satan and I know it torment
[2:26:16] you I know you got the covers all pulled
[2:26:19] up you even got the covers laid out on
[2:26:22] the psychiatrist desk and he keeps
[2:26:24] pulling out our pictures there's a
[2:26:26] picture there's a picture of a man by
[2:26:30] the name of Steve Thomas and he thought
[2:26:33] he had him when he had one with ALS but
[2:26:36] he come out packing a victory there's a
[2:26:39] man that used to sit right here but
[2:26:41] he'll blame I was thinking about him
[2:26:45] last weekend and he said he started he
[2:26:48] remember a song used to sing a thought
[2:26:49] I'd never make it they thought I
[2:26:51] wouldn't last but you and me Jesus we
[2:26:54] sure proved them wrong
[2:26:57] they thought I had him with a stroke but

[2:27:22] think I can think of running right now I
[2:27:25] could tear these walls down
[2:27:27] I think of us preaching this to a life
[2:27:29] group of 200 some people we tear the
[2:27:32] walls down with this service today but I
[2:27:34] think when we get over there I'll feel

[2:27:39] tearing the walls down but you just wait
[2:27:41] to like it over on the other side you
