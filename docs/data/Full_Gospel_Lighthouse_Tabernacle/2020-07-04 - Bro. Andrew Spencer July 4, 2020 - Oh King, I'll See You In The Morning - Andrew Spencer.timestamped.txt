[34:12] here in the house of the Lord we greet
[34:16] you today in the name of the Lord we we
[34:18] have been on a little excursion this
[34:21] week and we went to Louisiana some of
[34:26] you may have already seen that service
[34:28] but we didn't know if we were going to
[34:30] be able to do it and that's why we
[34:32] didn't relay the message to you all last
[34:35] weekend and things were still up in the
[34:37] air but God so ordained us to be in
[34:40] those and those this week just to be at
[34:43] brother Tim's and to be there to hold
[34:47] their hands and prayer and them to hold
[34:49] us up in prayer and and it was a very
[34:53] very supernatural week and just to be
[34:57] able for our pastor to be able to make
[34:59] that trip was a miracle and I can assure
[35:03] you that he was in good hands I took
[35:06] very good care of him watched over him
[35:08] protected him fed him good and and so
[35:11] but we had a wonderful trip and so many
[35:16] things that they could be said and and
[35:18] maybe I'll relay some of those things
[35:20] later and our services evening but just
[35:22] to see the angel of the Lord moving and
[35:24] and that's what I want you as a
[35:26] congregation to watch for and to be
[35:28] attentive and be conscious of is the
[35:31] moving of that angel that when he begins
[35:33] to trouble the water that's that's the
[35:35] time to step in when I when I witnessed
[35:38] three young boys received the baptism of
[35:41] the holy ghost in a little cabin I can
[35:45] tell you God will come to you and your
[35:46] pew he'll come to you and your car he'll
[35:49] come to you wherever you are
[35:51] he's that kind of a garden and be very
[35:53] attentive to him and beware of him and
[35:57] obey Him and and just just the things of
[36:00] God that have happened we cannot thank
[36:03] him enough we are celebrating our
[36:05] independence as a nation today and as
[36:09] the kingdom of heaven we are celebrating
[36:12] our freedom there is no freedom like the
[36:15] freedom that is in Christ Jesus there
[36:18] there will be fireworks set off all over
[36:20] the nation today but there's nothing
[36:22] like the fireworks that's happened in my
[36:24] soul where he changed me and made me a
[36:27] new creation and I cannot thank him
[36:29] enough for all the Freedom and the
[36:31] Liberty that is in Christ and whom the
[36:33] Sun is set free is free indeed are you
[36:37] free this evening they may praise the

[37:22] want to be attentive of those sayings
[37:23] and want to protect you as a people and
[37:26] remind you for no gathering before or
[37:28] after service and I know that that puts
[37:31] a little bit of damper on our fellowship
[37:33] a little bit but we're just we want to

[40:46] to speak to you tonight Oh King I will
[40:50] see you in the morning
[40:52] okay now see you in the morning Daniel
[40:55] chapter 6 and verse 4 then the
[40:59] presidents and princes sought to find
[41:02] occasion against Daniel concerning the
[41:04] kingdom but they could find none
[41:06] occasion nor fault for as much as he was
[41:08] faithful neither was there any error or
[41:11] fall found in him then said these men we
[41:15] shall not find any occasion
[41:16] against this Daniel except we find it
[41:18] against him concerning the law of his
[41:21] God then these presidents and princes
[41:24] assemble together to the king and said
[41:26] thus unto him King Darius live forever
[41:30] all the presidents of the kingdom the
[41:33] governors and the princes the councilors
[41:35] and the captains have consulted together
[41:37] to establish a royal statue and to make
[41:41] a firm decree that whosoever shall ask
[41:43] petition of any kind any God or man for
[41:48] 30 days save of thee O king he shall be
[41:51] cast into the den of lions now O King
[41:54] established the decree and Sandow
[41:57] writing that it be not changed according
[42:01] to the law of the Medes and the Persians
[42:02] which all truth not wherefore King
[42:06] Darius signed the writing and the decree
[42:10] now when Daniel knew that the writing
[42:12] was signed he went into his house and
[42:14] his windows being opened in his chamber
[42:17] towards Jerusalem he kneeled upon his
[42:20] knees three times a day and prayed and
[42:23] gave thanks before his God as he did a
[42:27] four time how many has a need that you'd
[42:30] like to take before the Lord this
[42:31] evening amen God sees your hand he sees
[42:34] your need Heavenly Father we approach
[42:37] your throne of mercy just now Lord with
[42:40] the spirit of humility largest flowing
[42:43] from our hearts Lord knowing that you
[42:46] are the author and the finisher of our
[42:48] faith father Lord we know that you are
[42:51] here to do and here to work amongst your
[42:54] people and minister to them like a never
[42:56] before Lord you see the hands that have
[42:59] been lifted up you see the heart that is
[43:01] below that hand Lord that has a need
[43:03] that that only you can meet now father
[43:06] we know that you are able to speak live
[43:09] to hear to your children we've give many
[43:11] times a witness of the things that have
[43:13] been said from this pulpit Lord that
[43:16] have spoke directly to hearts and
[43:18] miracles happen and miracles take place
[43:20] and life's be transformed and changed
[43:22] Lord you see the newborn babes in Christ
[43:25] how that how that they have came to
[43:28] water
[43:28] see now I pray Lord Jesus that you would
[43:31] be mindful of the youngest child to the
[43:34] oldest here tonight that you would speak
[43:35] to them on their level in which they
[43:37] would receive and attach themselves to
[43:40] father we pray God that you would go
[43:42] across this audience Lord and may they
[43:45] begin to feel that pulsation of the Holy
[43:47] Ghost as you begin to draw ever so near
[43:49] father Lord we know that that that your
[43:52] word you your word you follow that word
[43:55] if your Holy Spirit and and if a heart
[43:58] can receive that word then they have the
[44:00] conductor as it leads the way and may
[44:03] the Holy Ghost go to their situation and
[44:06] go to their hearts door and minister to
[44:08] them my life peace and health I pray all
[44:11] of these things for your name and in
[44:14] your name in the name of Jesus Christ
[44:16] amen
[44:17] may God bless his word he may be seated
[44:21] also in Daniel chapter 6 and verse 16
[44:25] then the king commanded and they brought
[44:28] Daniel and cast him into the den of
[44:31] lions now the King spake and said unto
[44:34] Daniel now notice notice these
[44:37] statements now this what you see from
[44:40] where we left off in verse 10 and from
[44:43] the time that Daniel was thrown into the
[44:45] Lions Den that Daniel does not open his
[44:47] mouth except for the prey under his god
[44:50] but notice what the king there is a
[44:52] connection between the king and Daniel
[44:55] and Dan and the King spake and said unto
[44:58] Daniel thy God whom now service
[45:00] continually he will deliver thee so so
[45:03] we realized that even the King knew how
[45:06] powerful that the God of heaven was and
[45:09] that he was on the side of Daniel you
[45:12] see it makes a statement to us as we're
[45:14] looking at this in this in this
[45:16] condition that Daniel was in and we look
[45:19] and we see that that God had a testimony
[45:22] and that God had a witness there and
[45:24] notice verse 17 and a stone was brought
[45:27] and laid upon the mouth of the den and
[45:29] the King sealed it with his own signet
[45:32] and
[45:32] with the Signet of his lords that the
[45:35] purpose might not be changed concerning
[45:39] that yo now I want you to just kind of
[45:41] imagine these things in your mindset and
[45:44] come to get them in your mind has this
[45:46] has this cave has been set as there are
[45:49] there are lions that are in this den may
[45:51] some historians say from anywhere to
[45:54] seven to ten lions are there and they
[45:57] would feed them depending on what they
[45:59] would feed them whether they would feed
[46:01] them sheep or goats or or whatever they
[46:03] would feed them up to ten sheep a day
[46:05] this this den of lions and and what they
[46:08] would do when they were bringing men
[46:10] into that den of lions they would they
[46:12] would starve them so that as soon as
[46:14] that man would fall into that cave or
[46:17] that or that being or whatever they were
[46:19] throw in there would devour them and
[46:21] break their bones and if they didn't
[46:23] immediately go and kill them they would
[46:25] go and break their bones and let them
[46:27] suffer and then they would go back and
[46:29] had kill off their kill off their their
[46:32] their their their enemy or the person
[46:34] that was in that cave so you can imagine
[46:36] the fear that is going along with the
[46:38] Lions Den now I have to say that none of
[46:41] us sitting here has ever been through a
[46:42] moment like that now if you've been over
[46:45] in the jungles they say that that lion
[46:46] when he begins to roar that he can roll
[46:49] rocks off of a hill miles and miles away
[46:52] that Lions voice has the power to shut
[46:55] everything up in the entire jungle so
[46:58] you can imagine when you put seven to
[47:00] ten lines the fear that it would cause
[47:02] as you're getting ready to be dropped
[47:04] into a cave now one would be enough to
[47:06] scare me but a whole dinner of lions
[47:08] would set the precedence of fear but yet
[47:11] Daniel was a man than God that God
[47:14] trusted he was a man that trusted God
[47:17] and I believe that it's been spoken that
[47:19] if you trust me I'll use you like never
[47:21] before
[47:22] and Daniel was put into a condition of
[47:25] life that would bring him to a spot
[47:27] where he would be recognized but before
[47:30] you can be recognized as a guy as a man
[47:33] that has that has withstood the Lions
[47:35] then you got to go through the lines
[47:36] then and before you can be recognized as
[47:39] a man that kills a dime you got to go
[47:41] into a valley
[47:42] and before you can go and you can preach
[47:45] down to you can go and preach the people
[47:47] about a God that is that is coming to
[47:50] you for repentance you've got to be able
[47:52] to go through through the through the
[47:54] belly of a whale and be able to come out
[47:56] on the other side and be able to testify
[47:59] that I'm a witness I'm a witness of the
[48:02] power of prayer I'm a witness that God
[48:04] does not change I'm a witness that God
[48:07] is ever-present I'm a witness that God
[48:09] still works through humanity you see
[48:13] that is the program of God to be able to
[48:15] walk through humanity and he's looking
[48:17] for one tonight he's looking for
[48:19] children he's looking for mothers he's
[48:21] looking for fathers you see God works
[48:23] through human beings to redeem human
[48:26] beings he can take you and work through
[48:28] you to redeem humanity if you completely
[48:31] dedicate everything that you are if
[48:33] you're a young woman dedicate your
[48:36] morals if you're a young man dedicate
[48:38] your morals dedicate your mind dedicate
[48:40] your thinking dedicate your heart
[48:42] dedicate your soul dedicate all that you
[48:45] are and let Christ's work through you
[48:47] let Christ's work through that what a
[48:50] glorious thing when you can dedicate
[48:53] your whole entire being and God works
[48:55] through you and ministers through you
[48:57] and their Daniel was living in such a
[49:00] spot that that you have to realize the
[49:03] condition that Daniel was here
[49:05] Daniel was living in a city he was
[49:07] living in a land where he was not that
[49:09] we would not call home he was in a spot
[49:12] of captivity when the children of God
[49:14] had been taken away and put in the city
[49:17] of Babylon but Daniel was a man that had
[49:20] purposed in his heart that he would not
[49:22] defile himself with the king's meat in
[49:24] the King Street you see Daniel was a man
[49:27] of God that trusted God as a young man
[49:29] as he's brought all the way up through
[49:31] different Kings and through different
[49:33] leaders who watched Daniel's life and
[49:35] here Daniel is about 70 years old when
[49:38] we're grabbing ahold of his story and
[49:39] Daniel at this age knew and had seen the
[49:43] power of God and at that age Daniel was
[49:46] not willing to back off what God had
[49:48] said how about you children of God that
[49:51] have been here
[49:52] the hand of God you sing the power of
[49:54] God it's too late to draw back it's too
[49:57] late to back up it's too late to give in
[50:00] we've already seen what he can do
[50:02] surely hallelujah
[50:06] surely I'm not going to turn around now
[50:08] and I'm not going to back off
[50:10] what God is head nor what I am going to
[50:13] believe that God can do but you see that
[50:17] man Daniel was a real seed of Abraham
[50:20] living in that land that was different
[50:22] living amongst people that were
[50:24] different but yet he was gallant to that
[50:26] promise that I'll not deflower myself
[50:28] with the Kings meat and the Bible says
[50:31] it tells us if you look over in Daniel
[50:33] chapter one that you can find that that
[50:35] Daniel was preferred above all the other
[50:38] princes and the presidents and the Bible
[50:41] said that Daniel was excellent in spirit
[50:44] and excellent spirit was in him and you
[50:47] see in the spot of condition of darkness
[50:49] light shines its best
[50:52] so you see you could take and you could
[50:56] take and you can look at that light and
[50:58] you could put that light in the middle
[50:59] of darkness and there's no darkness
[51:01] around and the Bible said in Daniel
[51:04] chapter one that the Bible said that he
[51:07] was ten times more wiser than all of the
[51:10] other men
[51:10] Daniel was excellent in spirit I think
[51:13] it's amazing that that the enemy of hell
[51:16] would look out upon the children of God
[51:19] and they would see that there's none
[51:21] like that one there they're more wise
[51:24] than all of the denominations are more
[51:26] wise than all of the kree's that one
[51:28] person is ten more ten more times more
[51:31] wise in all of the ideologies and the
[51:34] Creed's and the things of man that one
[51:37] man is so filled with the Holy Ghost
[51:38] that he's accent in spirit whoo here you
[51:44] in our we live in a land that's
[51:46] different he's saying our whole we're
[51:48] just a passing through right here this
[51:50] ain't my home I am in making a trip I've
[51:54] been making investments I've been making
[51:56] my I've been making a declaration that
[51:58] I'm leaving here
[51:59] one of these days I'm going on vacation
[52:02] and I'm staying on vacation hallelujah
[52:08] hallelujah when I go on that vacation
[52:11] I'm not looking for a tan and I'm not
[52:13] looking like hell I'm gonna come back
[52:15] different but I'm going on that side of
[52:17] that vacation and I'm going to a place
[52:20] when I'll never get old I'll never get
[52:22] frail I'll never get weak I'll never get
[52:25] tired I'll never get sick hallelujah I'm
[52:27] going to a place it's better than the
[52:30] beach it's better than Disneyland I'm
[52:33] going to a land that has been built by
[52:36] the maker of heaven and of art
[52:42] hallelujah here we are this is the
[52:46] darkest of days and the darkest of hours
[52:49] it's a day when no man else when no man
[52:52] has ever went through what you're going
[52:54] through but this is the hour of
[52:56] overcomers this is the hour when we
[52:59] shine our best we know that when you run
[53:02] a relay race that you put in your best
[53:04] and that last so you can look at
[53:07] yourself and you can get all tore up but
[53:10] you can look at the end of the day say
[53:11] look I'm the best that God's got there's
[53:14] a lot of people that'll let you down but
[53:16] God won't let you down and if you're the
[53:18] best that God's got to come through lay
[53:20] on us here
[53:20] he's got faith in you that you're coming
[53:23] out on the other side by the lion stand
[53:30] hallelujah
[53:31] you see overcomers are those that are
[53:34] faithful and obedient Christians who not
[53:36] only talk about doing the will of God
[53:38] but who actually do it and you look at
[53:41] revelations chapter 2 and revelations
[53:43] chapter 3 when Jesus is speaking to John
[53:46] about the church ages and here it speaks
[53:49] extensively of the overcomers and it is
[53:52] to those overcomers that the blessings
[53:55] of the future Kingdom are promised to
[53:58] you can look at you to see that they
[54:00] will be clothed in white they will be
[54:02] pillars in the Lord's temple they will
[54:04] be granted power over the nation's they
[54:07] will enjoy the tree of life they will
[54:09] not be subject to spiritual
[54:11] their names will be acknowledged by
[54:13] Christ they will be fed out of that
[54:15] hidden man they will have our white
[54:18] stone with their name on it Christ will
[54:20] write his own name upon them and they
[54:22] will set with Christ on his soul that is
[54:28] the throne of the overcomer is to set
[54:31] with Christ whoo and notice what the
[54:35] Prophet said in the Laodicean Church as
[54:36] he said now then there will not be one
[54:38] person who was set in that throne of the
[54:41] Lord Jesus unless he has been living
[54:44] that word your prayers your fasting to
[54:48] repentance no matter what you present to
[54:50] God none of that will gain you the
[54:52] privilege of sitting in that throne it
[54:54] will be granted only to the word broad
[54:59] as the throne of the king is shared with
[55:02] the Queen because she is United to him
[55:05] so only they who are of that Lord even
[55:08] as he is of that word will share that
[55:10] throne so if you're going to sit in that
[55:16] seat you've got to be a part of that
[55:19] word you've got to share in that word
[55:22] you've got to be a part of that word
[55:23] you've got to eat that word and when you
[55:25] look at the things that the overcomer
[55:28] has to overcome and the things that the
[55:31] body of Christ is going through and to
[55:33] see that the things out weary we get so
[55:36] come discombobulated about we get so
[55:39] tore up well how's this gonna work out
[55:41] look at this one sick and look at that
[55:43] one sick God's got this it's astonishing
[55:46] sometimes when you take a look back and
[55:49] you say and you look at the drama as God
[55:51] is displaying it completely before you
[55:54] and if you are an admirer of art you can
[55:58] look at this great piece of art and
[55:59] there's not another piece in all the
[56:02] heart in all the halls of critics
[56:04] there's not another piece of art like
[56:06] this in all the halls of the libraries
[56:09] you are his that's picture he's been
[56:13] drawing you out before the foundation of
[56:15] the world and he's getting ready to
[56:17] stamp his name upon that picture
[56:23] hello Luke hello Luke
[56:28] you look at these things you look at
[56:32] what happened to God's general brother
[56:33] on you look at what's happened to men
[56:36] like brother Harold Hildebrandt you look
[56:37] like what has happened to men like
[56:39] brother ed Bisco going through heart
[56:41] attacks men like buy the home of Frazier
[56:43] and going through the battles and many
[56:45] things that are happening to the Pruett
[56:47] family and the things that are happening
[56:48] to the children of God you look at those
[56:50] things and you would get the idea that
[56:52] somebody hates the children of God and
[56:54] you would lie and Satan would like to
[56:56] think that he's got the upper hand cut
[56:59] on you and the upper hand cut on God's
[57:02] children and on God but I want to warn
[57:05] the devil we will not be put in a corner
[57:07] nor will be left hanging over the side
[57:10] of the ropes like we've been beat down
[57:11] and barely gonna make it when we get 10
[57:14] when we go over on the other side we're
[57:16] gonna dance on the other side we're not
[57:18] going to barely crawl and get there
[57:20] we're going all the way completely
[57:22] unharmed I'm sick we are going to make
[57:27] it so why would we back up if we are the
[57:31] overcomers of Laodicea we ought to shout
[57:34] like never before we ought to praise
[57:36] like never before because we know that
[57:39] we are going to make it and we're going
[57:41] to win the only way children that you
[57:45] cannot win is if you switch sides I am
[57:50] NOT switching sides over to the devil
[57:52] side I'll stay with Jesus I'll go with
[57:58] the one that can take me out of the
[58:00] valley I'll go with the one that'll
[58:02] bring me out of the pit hallelujah
[58:15] why would I turn back on him now brother
[58:18] Vernon when I've seen him display
[58:21] himself and disperse himself like never
[58:23] before when we watched when we watch
[58:26] thee the greatest opening of the word
[58:29] that has ever taken place that that we
[58:31] had referee reformers throughout all the
[58:34] ages we had reformers that would come
[58:36] and men would come behind that and
[58:38] within three years they would
[58:39] denominator but there's not been one
[58:42] denomination set on this message men
[58:44] have their ideas but there's not been
[58:46] one denominational set on this message
[58:49] how can you denomination of the hour
[58:52] when it's the king
[58:53] you can't put Christ in a box that Allu
[58:58] you you can't even hold him in a book
[59:01] why should I turn around now and try to
[59:04] give up or try to back off of what God
[59:06] has said we have watched the third poll
[59:09] in action when you see the Holy Ghost go
[59:12] and grab ahold of that word and bring
[59:14] that word into an exact season and bring
[59:17] it and make it manifest when you watch
[59:19] that that third pull that you know what
[59:22] that is that it's the King sword but
[59:24] when you watch that King sword what does
[59:26] it do it produces miracles it produces
[59:29] life hallelujah noe no call a storm
[59:34] completely out of existence and we've
[59:36] watched this third pull in operation in
[59:39] the head of the tent of humanity as we
[59:42] watch as God has taken all human flesh
[59:46] again because God will not back off of
[59:52] his word and to think that he's using
[59:56] you
[59:57] to think that he's using you now that
[59:59] right there that just blade that just it
[1:00:02] makes it makes Satan so so upset that he
[1:00:05] would take you brother Steve that he
[1:00:08] would take you and he would work through
[1:00:11] you and he would redeem humanity and he
[1:00:14] would work through humanity to prove I'm
[1:00:18] the god of creation that I am the one
[1:00:22] that spoke to the winds and I spooked
[1:00:25] I am the author of life we've seen this
[1:00:33] God - I don't have it in my vocabulary
[1:00:37] we've seen him do incredible things
[1:00:39] we've seen him take things and work
[1:00:42] through you manatee just like he did
[1:00:44] 2,000 years ago we've seen the mighty
[1:00:48] God and veiled before us and you watches
[1:00:51] that seed as it's going through the body
[1:00:52] as it begins to come and it begins to
[1:00:55] move as it comes out and you're watching
[1:00:57] that it's the same who the same seed
[1:01:01] that went in the ground is the same one
[1:01:02] as risen in this hour what is it it's
[1:01:09] the word attaching itself to believers
[1:01:16] you watch us as men trying to attach
[1:01:19] themselves with this message and they
[1:01:22] can never attach himself I hope you kind
[1:01:26] of catch what I'm saying right here but
[1:01:29] you watch as that real believer he's not
[1:01:32] moved he's not shook but what does he do
[1:01:36] he begins to dig down deeper when the
[1:01:40] winds of change keep coming he just
[1:01:43] keeps digging down deeper and finding
[1:01:46] his roots and he keeps finding with God
[1:01:49] his head and he pulls up and he shows
[1:01:51] that I am the Lord and I change not that
[1:01:55] I was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:01:58] was bruised for my iniquities and the
[1:02:00] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:02:02] and by His stripes I am healed sickness
[1:02:07] can come torment can come but he begins
[1:02:10] to dig down deeper it is the Lord
[1:02:13] attaching itself to believers well
[1:02:18] notice what the prophet said in perfect
[1:02:20] faith he said when a man lives by faith
[1:02:23] and walks by faith I mean substance
[1:02:25] faith he is isolated from the entire
[1:02:27] world and becomes a new creature in
[1:02:30] Christ there now you're getting into
[1:02:34] broad material
[1:02:35] you're getting in to rapturing
[1:02:41] hallelujah hallelujah when that man
[1:02:46] walks in substance faith that means he's
[1:02:49] got it it's real it's before him he's
[1:02:52] getting him bride material and he's
[1:02:54] getting in rapture condition what makes
[1:03:00] a difference between this church and all
[1:03:02] the other churches out there it's him
[1:03:05] it's him they preach faith they preach
[1:03:09] baptism some of them preach one God but
[1:03:14] they do not know how to live in
[1:03:16] overcoming life and the key ingredient
[1:03:19] is him you watched the story we read
[1:03:23] tonight and you watch that the angel is
[1:03:27] the one that makes the difference
[1:03:30] hallelujah it was not the difference of
[1:03:32] lines that they put down there maybe
[1:03:34] they change the lines out week to week
[1:03:36] but it was the angel that made the
[1:03:38] difference Daniel was a believer and
[1:03:43] Daniel was conscious of that angelic
[1:03:46] realm you remember when brother Lanham
[1:03:48] would stand there he would stand at that
[1:03:50] Hall at that podium and he would say now
[1:03:52] hey now I'm trying to catch your spirit
[1:03:55] and I see you and you feel that sweet
[1:03:59] spirit right now and that is that it's
[1:04:02] none other and you begin to hear his
[1:04:04] voice begin to trail off and he's
[1:04:06] breaking into another round he said now
[1:04:08] that angel the Lord is no more than two
[1:04:10] feet from me and two feet from you now
[1:04:13] don't you be afraid of that don't you be
[1:04:15] afraid of that that will hurt you
[1:04:16] that'll help you now he said now now
[1:04:19] that success that you've got its
[1:04:21] breaking him into another realm over
[1:04:23] into another category and it's breaking
[1:04:26] into that dimension and it's pulling
[1:04:28] down that promise you see that angelic
[1:04:31] realm it's right there beside you it's
[1:04:33] standing every present ever so close and
[1:04:36] if we could ever be so mindful as human
[1:04:40] beings to realize that there is a
[1:04:42] visible audience in the invisible realm
[1:04:45] to
[1:04:46] bringing us into his presence and to
[1:04:48] draw us closer to him what kind of
[1:04:52] people would we be if we acted out what
[1:04:55] the Prophet told us now he told us the
[1:04:58] angel told brother Balaam you remember
[1:05:00] he told him he said now look your words
[1:05:03] your thoughts sell louder in heaven than
[1:05:06] your words do here on earth now
[1:05:08] automatically as human beings we begin
[1:05:11] to identify and think oh my goodness
[1:05:12] what kind of thoughts have I thought
[1:05:15] this week what kind of bad thoughts and
[1:05:17] your mind begins to identify and look
[1:05:19] back through over those things as soon
[1:05:20] as a minister says those things you
[1:05:22] begin to think back is that right some
[1:05:23] of you running through your mind right
[1:05:24] now oh my goodness whoa I lost my temper
[1:05:27] and your thoughts sounding louder in
[1:05:30] heaven than your words to here on earth
[1:05:32] now a lot of people begin to think about
[1:05:34] it that way and they think oh I gotta
[1:05:36] think positive things I gotta think I
[1:05:37] got to make sure I'm not thinking
[1:05:39] negative things but what about this what
[1:05:41] if you turn the diamond this way and
[1:05:43] your thoughts of positivity and your
[1:05:46] thoughts of resurrection power and your
[1:05:49] thoughts of anointing and your thoughts
[1:05:51] are the Holy Ghost if they sell louder
[1:05:54] in heaven if your negative ones sell out
[1:05:56] in heaven how much more about your
[1:05:59] thoughts towards his promise how much
[1:06:01] more do they sound louder in heaven I'd
[1:06:04] say if your thoughts are ringing out
[1:06:05] that kind of a spiritual atmosphere
[1:06:07] it'll do something for the natural that
[1:06:17] same angels here that same angels movie
[1:06:24] I've watched him too many times come in
[1:06:26] his congregation and begin to bless
[1:06:28] people he's here he's moving and he's
[1:06:31] very active in this congregation you're
[1:06:33] a very mature people you're a very
[1:06:35] mature group in the bride of Jesus

[1:10:15] he was sitting there looking he said the
[1:10:16] wind was blowing that sage back and
[1:10:18] forth and his white robe that garment
[1:10:20] that he had on was blowing in the wind
[1:10:22] and he said I stood there and he said I
[1:10:25] wanted to get a little better look at
[1:10:28] him he said so I begin to move myself
[1:10:29] around and he said it looked

[1:10:34] the Hoffman head of Christ that looks he
[1:10:38] said so I I tried to get his attention
[1:10:40] so that he would look this way and he
[1:10:43] said I went and he said he didn't really

[1:10:56] he said I thought I'd call him my name
[1:10:58] and he said Jesus he said Jesus and he
[1:11:03] said then he turned my way and looked at
[1:11:05] me to reached out his arms he reached
[1:11:10] out his arms and he said the next thing
[1:11:11] I know I said I woke up I woke up laying
[1:11:14] in that sage field completely soaking
[1:11:17] wet from tears that had run off on me
[1:11:20] that night Oh church he's ever-present
[1:11:24] don't you ever fear to go anywhere ever
[1:11:27] do anything for the never-failing
[1:11:29] presence of Jesus Christ he's with you
[1:11:31] ever ever so you go that angel of the
[1:11:34] Covenant that led the children of Israel
[1:11:37] across the Red Sea he's ever so near
[1:11:40] he's ever so near and he was the one
[1:11:44] that Daniel could speak from that
[1:11:46] statement of faith and said O king no
[1:11:49] matter what I go through I'll see you in
[1:11:52] the morning Oh what would it do if you
[1:11:55] begin to call on his name what's his
[1:12:00] name every knee shall bow and every
[1:12:03] tongue shall confess that Jesus that
[1:12:07] Jesus Christ is Lord give me just a
[1:12:19] little bit liberty Brother Bear said in
[1:12:22] the pillar of fire
[1:12:23] he said now in the days that he led the
[1:12:26] Israel let Israel through the wilderness
[1:12:28] I want to read some scripture I want you
[1:12:30] to notice closely God commissioning
[1:12:32] Moses to send him now over in Exodus 23
[1:12:36] the 23rd chapter in the 20th verse he
[1:12:39] said listen closely he said behold I
[1:12:40] send an angel before thee to keep thee
[1:12:42] in the way and to bring the end of the
[1:12:44] place which I have prepared what who the
[1:12:47] saint who is beware of him and obey his
[1:12:50] voice and provoke him not for he will
[1:12:52] not pardon your transgressions for my
[1:12:54] name is in him but if thou will indeed
[1:12:57] obey his voice and do all that I have
[1:12:59] spoke that I speak then I will be an
[1:13:02] enemy to thine enemies and an adversary
[1:13:04] to thine adversaries for my name's
[1:13:07] shall go before thee now watch what
[1:13:10] brother Anna says he said let's see what
[1:13:12] the angel look like in the thirteenth
[1:13:14] chapter of Exodus we read this in the
[1:13:17] 21st and 22nd verse and the Lord went
[1:13:20] before them by day in a pillar of cloud
[1:13:23] and to lead them by a flare a pillar and
[1:13:25] cloud in the way by night by a pillar of
[1:13:28] fire and to give them light by night and
[1:13:31] he took not away the pillar of the cloud
[1:13:33] by day neither the pillar fire by night
[1:13:36] from before the people so we see that
[1:13:40] the pillar of fire that angel was the
[1:13:42] one that was leading the children of
[1:13:44] Israel and he would tell them to beware
[1:13:47] of that angel that I'll send him before
[1:13:49] you to keep you in that way
[1:13:51] now what have we seen in this hour we
[1:13:54] have seen a return of the pillar fire
[1:13:57] what he insists that is standing amongst
[1:14:00] the children of God it's Jesus I'll tell
[1:14:07] you right now Church no matter what
[1:14:09] condition you're in the angel of the
[1:14:11] Lord is an expert of getting you out of
[1:14:14] trouble he's an expert of making away
[1:14:18] he's an expert of getting you out of
[1:14:20] prison he's an expert of setting you
[1:14:22] free he's an expert in healing he's an
[1:14:24] axe raisin expert in the way making he's
[1:14:27] that kind of an angel you remember when
[1:14:31] Herod put Peter in the prison and that
[1:14:33] night in hay Acts chapter 12 that the
[1:14:35] angel the Lord came down there when
[1:14:37] there was two prison guards on the side
[1:14:39] of Peter that the angel the Lord came
[1:14:41] and set him free that same age was here
[1:14:46] to set the children of God free from
[1:14:48] every demonic power every sickness every
[1:14:51] cancer every high blood pressure ever
[1:14:54] sugar diabetes every man problem that
[1:14:57] angel of healing is circling the camp of
[1:15:00] God
[1:15:01] [Applause]
[1:15:10] Daniel was a man that they couldn't find
[1:15:14] no fault in they were they hated him
[1:15:20] without cause because he was excellent
[1:15:25] in severe there's a lot of people that's
[1:15:33] afraid to be identified with America
[1:15:35] right now but if you're an American
[1:15:39] you're identified all the way to its
[1:15:41] core
[1:15:42] the Prophet said that I'm American
[1:15:45] through and through
[1:15:46] I'm identified with her same and I'm
[1:15:48] identified with her glory
[1:15:51] but there's another kingdom of God that
[1:15:53] I am identified with I am not ashamed of
[1:15:57] that Kingdom I am not ashamed of that
[1:15:59] word I am not ashamed of them angels I
[1:16:01] am not ashamed to my god
[1:16:03] I'm identified with men like David and
[1:16:06] men like Daniel and men like the three
[1:16:09] Hebrew children and a man like Peter and
[1:16:11] Paul and James I'm identified with a
[1:16:14] nation that cannot be shook
[1:16:16] I'm identified with a kingdom that
[1:16:19] cannot be tore down the men hate them
[1:16:27] the men hate you that's presidents that
[1:16:31] hates you there's governors that hates
[1:16:32] you
[1:16:33] Wow they are led and anointed by the
[1:16:36] demons of Hell and they hate the move of
[1:16:39] God you don't think so just allow or if
[1:16:43] I were to take place and take over the
[1:16:45] city and governors and mayors and
[1:16:47] everything will come and shut you down
[1:16:49] it's corrupt all the way to its core and
[1:16:52] they hated Daniel without a cause and
[1:16:56] they wanted to throw him into a pit that
[1:16:59] he could not get out of
[1:17:01] but what them presidents and them
[1:17:04] princes didn't know is that there was an
[1:17:06] angel that was already on his way before
[1:17:09] the lines ever got hungry
[1:17:14] hallelujah brother Bantam said that God
[1:17:17] was not finished with Daniel yet and he
[1:17:21] said before they threw him in the lion's
[1:17:23] den that was an angel hanging on that
[1:17:25] ladder before brother on went through
[1:17:27] the fire there was an angel there before
[1:17:31] Full Gospel Light House went through the
[1:17:33] fire went through the flood there's an
[1:17:34] angel there's an angel there what the
[1:17:39] community don't know and what they not
[1:17:41] understanding is that there is a mighty
[1:17:44] angel that is ever present to change the
[1:17:47] situation what is cancer

[1:19:00] now for you that do not know and did not
[1:19:04] hear the message let me just give this
[1:19:05] to you and I'm gonna make a part three
[1:19:08] out of this oh Jesus
[1:19:14] the reason I'm preaching to you these
[1:19:17] things with such fervency and as a
[1:19:21] leader of this church it's because I
[1:19:23] know we're gonna win the reason I can
[1:19:29] tell you that you're going to make it
[1:19:31] it's because I know there's an angel
[1:19:34] there he's guarding you he's watching
[1:19:37] over you he's protecting you if you
[1:19:41] could just release your faith just for a
[1:19:43] moment
[1:19:44] he's got your children in his hands he's
[1:19:49] got your situation in his hands is that
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:53] brother Branham said that faith perfect
[1:19:55] faith is a master of all circumstances
[1:19:58] and the circumstances that the children
[1:20:00] of God are going through is none other
[1:20:02] it you can't fight it with none other
[1:20:04] type of faith or a weak faith but
[1:20:06] perfect faith you ain't got to try to
[1:20:09] build yourself up and try to make
[1:20:10] yourself a he-man in faith
[1:20:12] it's just simple common hyssop faith
[1:20:16] that will kill the devil
[1:20:31] faith is the faucet that you turn on
[1:20:37] that releases the flow of God's
[1:20:39] blessings now to me it ain't that hard
[1:20:46] go out there and turn on that water
[1:20:49] spigot and give me a cool drink of
[1:20:51] walking summer if we could just realize
[1:20:56] that faith is that Avenue in which we
[1:21:01] allow the blessings of God to flow
[1:21:04] through brother Roy Shrewsbury lived
[1:21:16] about two and a half hours from here as
[1:21:19] a general and absolute general been
[1:21:23] through Wars but has stood like none
[1:21:27] other in this hour a real general 95
[1:21:32] years old a real a real man of God a man
[1:21:35] of God that I remember as a little child
[1:21:38] the very first time that I ever seen the
[1:21:40] ball of fire the pillar fire it was in
[1:21:45] brother Roy Shrewsbury church and I
[1:21:48] every time every time he comes I'm
[1:21:52] reminded of that very first instance
[1:21:54] where the angel of the Lord allowed me
[1:21:56] to see him brother Roy's a real real man
[1:21:59] of God you all were very acquainted with
[1:22:02] brother Roy we've been so close and
[1:22:03] brother brother Roy we actually we
[1:22:06] borrowed each other's plans for churches
[1:22:08] and work together we've been we've been
[1:22:11] generous in this war together and
[1:22:13] brother on has ministered for brother
[1:22:15] Roy many times and when we we begin to
[1:22:19] go through this journey
[1:22:20] brother ons are very loved to human
[1:22:21] being if you haven't realized by now
[1:22:24] probably one of the most loved men
[1:22:26] throughout the whole entire world
[1:22:28] there's a lot of people that love him
[1:22:30] but I know and realized that he means a
[1:22:32] whole lot more to that side to God than
[1:22:34] what he even means to us in this room
[1:22:38] so God is for mother on just like he's
[1:22:42] for you and brother Roy called brother
[1:22:46] on several times today two times to be
[1:22:48] exact and he called him and he told him
[1:22:51] and he said he said brother on I now we
[1:22:54] cannot embellish and we cannot we have a
[1:22:57] mandate that we cannot rely on God that
[1:23:00] we cannot go off an impulse and say
[1:23:02] anything just because we want to say
[1:23:04] something because you realize as a
[1:23:07] minister of God that you're accountable
[1:23:09] for everything that you say
[1:23:12] you see you see even brother never would
[1:23:15] get in trouble and he would go into that
[1:23:17] realm and he would people wanted them to
[1:23:19] prophesy over top of him and they would
[1:23:22] get in trouble the human flesh wants to
[1:23:24] give seriously every we want to give you
[1:23:27] but no man can say unless God speaks and
[1:23:33] if it comes from that realm
[1:23:35] it's gotta be dead on it's gotta be
[1:23:38] accurate it's gotta hit the mark and
[1:23:41] brother Roy called brother on and said
[1:23:45] brother on you are about to go into a
[1:23:48] cave that no man has ever came out of
[1:23:54] you're getting ready to go into a cave
[1:23:57] that no man's ever came out of but
[1:24:03] brother on I say to you by the Spirit of
[1:24:06] the Lord you will say like Daniel said O
[1:24:09] king I see you in the morning
[1:24:13] [Applause]
[1:24:24] I'll see you in the morning
[1:24:33] Alleluia hello he said brother all
[1:24:39] you're gonna live you're coming out of
[1:24:42] cave like nobody else's came out off
[1:24:44] you're gonna live
[1:24:46] hallelujah Dan you knew what his God was
[1:24:51] capable of but when Daniel got down
[1:24:53] there that angel shut the mouths of
[1:24:57] those lions what did he do he took all
[1:25:01] of the hunger away from those lines to
[1:25:07] think about this let me give it to you
[1:25:09] like this when the thing that you're so
[1:25:11] scared about get scared of you
[1:25:16] hallelujah with tape so when the thing
[1:25:18] you hate so much it's so scared about
[1:25:21] gets so scared that the people of God
[1:25:24] when cancer gets cancer and takes its
[1:25:27] leave those lives shut their mouths the
[1:25:32] Lion of cancer shut your mouth the line
[1:25:35] of depression shut your mouth the line
[1:25:39] of suicide shut your mouth the line of
[1:25:42] depression anxiety fear all of those
[1:25:45] things shut your mouth
[1:25:48] there's an angel here stay with me
[1:25:59] I'm telling you Church there are things
[1:26:07] being released that I don't even
[1:26:08] understand why or how God is releasing
[1:26:12] things in this season like he has before
[1:26:14] but I'm telling you he is putting you in
[1:26:17] a perfect position for a body change
[1:26:21] he's putting you in a perfect position
[1:26:24] for a body change and Jesus knew every
[1:26:27] scripture that he looked at was
[1:26:30] identifying himself and this message is
[1:26:35] putting you in a perfect position from
[1:26:38] none other than the promises of God that
[1:26:51] you were given a little bit of a clip a
[1:26:53] little bit of a vision two years ago
[1:26:55] before our labor day the brother arm was
[1:27:00] going into a cave you didn't realize it
[1:27:02] but the vision had spoke that there was
[1:27:06] craters who remember there was craters
[1:27:08] that was so deep and so dark and looked
[1:27:12] like a war zone and brother Ron come and
[1:27:17] went all the way down into that pit he
[1:27:21] went all the way down into that pit and
[1:27:24] when he got to the bottom of the pit he
[1:27:27] grabbed ahold of a lamb and began to
[1:27:29] lead it right back out of that pit there
[1:27:33] has been no man and his went into that
[1:27:36] pit and ever came back out but there is
[1:27:39] a man that is coming out of that pit
[1:27:41] carrying a lamp
[1:27:43] I don't know who that lamb is but when
[1:27:46] that lamb comes you watch o King I'll
[1:27:52] see you in the morning that's true
[1:28:01] that's true in the mouth of two or three
[1:28:05] witnesses let it be established I agree
[1:28:08] with the trucks of the Living God
[1:28:10] we're coming out Hales trying to do its
[1:28:15] best but a rapture morning we're gonna
[1:28:17] look at death and say you lost we're
