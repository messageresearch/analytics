========================================

I certainly love you with all my heart I'd like to just take a couple of moments before before we goes too much farther we have a couple things to share with you maybe maybe I just share where we're at my family can help me if I I need help over the last few weeks we have found out some very difficult information that we have not shared with many people but I was shared with you as an audience just now we would we have did dr. buck Walker I just spoke to him this week one of those some manny ISM and I so thank him and thank him for being very proactive and we we have we have did a two CT scans and we've did a PET scan and we've just now been ordered to do an MRI which we did did you get a name for those that don't know we we knew for a few months that we were coming up against something we didn't know what it was and December in December the day before Christmas I believe it was let me just take you back December the 22nd the Lord spoke to us and said if you'll trust me I guess you're like never before and so and so we have been having some health issues since about the middle of last summer and we kept that very private Connie I think is the only one that actually knew that and we conducted the meetings that we conducted and we struggled very privately and we you know you just do what you got to do and so and so the day before Christmas brother doctor I call him brother as well dr. buck Walter asked me to begin some tests and he he shared with me and these were his words he said we're getting ready to send you down a long dark road and so we did one CT scan and we actually went away as a family and I found out in Pigeon Forge that I had tumor on my left my left lung at that point that's what they knew we knew that we already had some issues with my stomach and colon area and and so we found that out at Pigeon Forge as a family we try to go away a little bit to try to relieve some stress and so then then we went to brother Bissell's and sister Connie actually got a ticket to go to brother biscuits with us and the Lord shirt just shined down his grace and mercy they actually was able to get her on the same flights setting literally beside of me every flight and that was just incredible great to me that was one of the greatest meetings that I've ever been a part of it to preach and gonna deliver it's a Liberty like never before we came back on Tuesday and on Wednesday we did the second CT scan which would only confirm what the first CT scan confirmed and then and then they asked for us to do a biopsy the lymph node and brother Nathanael Natan went with us and and Holmes he went actually in the into the the room with us and the surgical room and they did the biopsy and I'd like to thank him for being a buddy and a friend to this entire product project and an eye on on what's going on and we got news that later that week that we had cancer and so and then and then then we began to have some more issues as as time would arise and so this last week we have did labs and then we did an MRI on Friday and because of some other things are beginning to show up and so so tomorrow they're going to do a lung biopsy there is a there is a the lungs has several masses in them and and and there's one of them that is extremely active and and it says it's doubled in size since they have seen me so that's in three weeks it's actually doubled and so they know what it is they know it's cancer but they need to find out what type of cancer that it is and so I just wanna I just want to share some things with you you said well brother on that's in the lungs and the doctor told me the other day he said your lungs are perfect he said this cancer that has came from somewhere else in your body has came and has master ties into your lungs he said your lungs are perfect he said it's it's it's actually invaded to the lungs and so they thanked God for perfect lungs and I believe that their squatter will have to leave I I've taken a bit of criticism just sharing some of these things some people say well you're speaking the devil's language well well let me just say this to you these doctors have a great care that I get better and I would like to know what I have and you can call it lyin vanities whatever you want to but that thing is trying to take my life and we believe that we have another report and God's greater than cancer [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] just to just to let you know our family will be involved with that tomorrow and and we apologize that we hope we hope we're not deer licking duties but just a lot of going on with our family here just now and so if you're not your hands not getting held or or you're not getting a special phone call if you can just give us a little space we sure would appreciate that amen I was able to see brother Joe in the hospital this week and he said in here and I hope he's doing better and to get that new pair of shoes so we just were just praying for brother Joe that God would be with him also Sharon shifflett that's been in the hospital we were able to see her and I just addressed with them and coming in the next a little bit I won't be able to go to hospitals and that's for obvious reasons other than for myself because of and you'll see me begin to work gloves in a few days and so it's because because they're wanting to treat me so and so I've you know I've had people tell me don't take the treatments or whatever you know but I I just have to tell you brother branham had great doctors and he told us to go to the doctors and take the medicine and and believe the Lord and and so we we're just we would appreciate your your prayers with us on this and and you you may not might know better how to pray now but that will take place the surgery we take place tomorrow I think it's between two three and a four-hour surgery I could be in the hospital tomorrow or the next day or whatever depending on how that goes and so Connie will Connie will somebody will get information out as we go shouldn't know too much as far as as far as how we're going to do until we begin to see oncologist that will begin to explain some things to us you know you I'm telling the world so you don't have to repeat it nobody's got the N word you know the end knowledge of what's going on you all have it now and so I I literally I literally get hundreds of texts a day now and I'm glad for all of them but I can't get to a mall and I can't get to all the phone calls and I'm getting to about 10 percent of the phone calls in and you see I have to live a life to so and so we we I appreciate everything so if you've tried to call or you've tried to text and hasn't haven't got a text back or hadn't got a call you just know I'm still thinking about you I read I read most of them anyway and listen to the listen to the to most of the voicemails and but we appreciate it's good to be loved good to have friends in the battle and know that you're not fighting it fighting the battle of loans so a man your our local body here and we appreciate you praying for us it and next weekend brother Matthew and brother William are supposed to speak the meetings here and so Williams on that you know that baby that baby watch right now and so a man if Williams not here that means that Matthew is going to get double duty he can handle that okay amen so god bless you and brother Andrew is getting ready to go to brother Bissell's brother Tom's winter camp and so we're certainly privileged and honored about that and what an honor that it is that he's getting ready to go to do that amen we appreciate him and all of that and hidden God good getting done good I asked brother Joe Greene this week and I think he's watching even right now I asked brother Joe Greene this week if he would go back and get the clip it's an audio clip it's not video an audio clip of when brother Bisco prayed and I received 100% deliverance you see I had lungs that were burned and being burned they they they had been scarred and so I was suffering with with scarred lungs and I had suffered since the accident in the oh seven and then in August the 22nd I had preached the week before at brother Bissell's and it just wore me slap out and I just really needed a healing touch it was in this meeting and we're going to make that available to you online that you can listen to it in this meeting brother Briscoe preaches on and I don't know if the title but he preaches on bringing order out of chaos and so brother Bissell praise of prayer and I'm going to share that with you if we can just now and he prays a prayer and in that prayer I stood up beside of a pillar and God it was like a great vacuum that came down over top of me and it was a like a push of air came down into my lungs and 100% healed my lungs and through this process of time in each stage of all of this and just to answer a couple of questions here people say well it's scar tissue or this or that it's not one bit of scar tissue there and here's what I want to say if God could heal him once and there not be one bit of scar tissue one bit of calcium deposit Sangha [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you hallelujah so I'd like to thank brother Jeremy you've been working diligently and we've had you in overtime if you could share that and after after that is shared for deliverance just hard [Music] you you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] certainly enjoyed last night service it's quite a move of the Spirit of the Lord even I think we left here last night about 10:30 and God we just continued to pour out and it was quite a quite quite a nice quite a nice thing a man a man I know many of you have to leave leave quickly and do different things in life but you know I I just tried to I tried to wait until God is completely done and so man and they think either way I just want to make sure I'm there when it happens a man we live in a very busy world and everybody is in such a hurry just such a hurry a man and so God just did some really nice things here last night late so we just thank the Lord if you will stand with me tonight I'd like to just speak to you for a little while I won't hold you long and I want to I want to speak to you for a bet I'd like for you to turn with me to Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 and here's what I want to say I commissioned Andrew last night show him no mercy so I'm not going to show him no mercy either amen amen I've I've said this before I don't want pity and I don't want you to feel sorry for me I want you to fight with me that's what I that's what I want to do I want to I want to just square up with every one of you I've been in some tough spots in life they told this body that it would never walk again they told this body it would never walk again they wanted to harvest the organs from this body they said that was brain dead so he's still God [Applause] I'd like to just speak for a bit on accepted the challenge I'm gonna have a challenge we accept when two great champions come to a certain spot one can make a lot of boast and he can stand and make most all day long but somebody accepts the challenge Jesus accepted the challenge David accepted the challenge you're learning just a little bit that brother branham accepted the challenge will you accept it we're gonna come quite a long ways were you accepted Jesus praise in Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 after this manner therefore pray he a Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen Luke chapter 9 and verse 28 Lewton 9 and 28 very important portion of Scripture and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took Peter and John and James and went up into the mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistening and behold there talked with him too men which were Moses and Elias I heard brother branham say he said isn't it interesting that that Peter James and John knew who they were yeah they had lived thousand two years before but here they're standing there and they knew who they were what a conference this was who appeared in glory now they've got something to say to Jesus and spank of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem quite a conference they're going to talk about Calvary they're going to talk about the preparation how are they going to do it take him back to the word take him back to the word but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and they they were await and they saw his glory and two men that stood with him and it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses of one for Elias not knowing what he said while he does spank there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him a man Matthew chapter 26 and verse 36 forgive me for having you standing I'll be I'll be standing quite a bit then cometh Jesus with them into a place called Gethsemane and and set the disciples since he here while I go and pray yonder and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then said he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death are you here and watch with me and he went a little further and he fell on his face and prayed notice what he prayed o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thought will and he cometh unto the disciples and finding them asleep and said unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour watching pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak and he went away again the second time and prayed saying O my father if this cup might not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done and it came and found him asleep for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words then coming to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now take your rest behold the hour is at hand the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners let us rise and let us be going behold it he is at hand that Duff betrayed me you may be seated this evening when David was walking off of the hill and he had accepted the challenge he had only just a little while previously just only moments before step before Saul and the men that were there and begin to talk to them about that God was with him and he began to explain to them it wasn't as Weil that he wanted to do this but God's with him and he began to testify sometimes we testify to even create an atmosphere of faith and here was a backslidden king that the anointing had left him here was a people that were if they lose the battle they will be enslaved to another nation their homes will be theirs their families won't be theirs the nation won't be theirs if they lose this battle it'll never be the same in this land and here is a champion of champions that is standing over there you and I have the luxury to stand on this side and see it as a great epic battle to which God won but if you were sitting in the trenches if it was your family at home and if in a few hours you were going to be one way another liberated or captive the banking accounts were no longer going to be yours the the the housing is no longer going to be yours the government that you are so enjoying is no longer going to be yours and here a boy not a great big muscular man that has been fought incredible battles but here a boy has showed up that has a history that he has been anointed by the prophet of God God has chosen him to the to be king now in his history he has been a songwriter and he has been under the anointings of worship and praise and he knew what the presence of God was on a couple of different occasions on a lion would come to try to destroy the sheep that was in the field and God would give him the anointing to destroy that life on another occasion a bear came to take those innocent sheep and the anointing of God came upon him and he slew that bear from one trial to another trial to another trial he learned that God is a champion God is a man of war now when he presents himself to the to the men there on the field and he hears this this man echo his thoughts out screaming blasphemous things down over the hill as he screaming he's streaming that them worship God is you to have a Living God and making all manner of fun of them send me one man that will come and fight me just send me one makes the negotiation you win will serve you we win you serve us the challenge was made it can make that challenge forever if nobody accepted and Goliath was in good shape until somebody was anointed for the challenge of the hour Laodicea can raise enrage and and woo and destroy religion of the world but God sent a message that accepted the challenge of the world st. Matty's going to live it somebody's going to overcome Laodicea David shared with with Saul that evening that God was with him Saul told him about his armor and he didn't want no part of that brother Brandon would equate that to some seminary teaches something that wasn't proved let me just say this to you this message is proved and I'd like to say here in stand as a representative to not standing in the battle that I'm standing in I'm standing in the battle in the land of a million doctors everybody's got an opinion everybody's got a thought everybody's got a word everybody's got a thought but there's as Roosevelt said you're the man in the middle you're the man in the arena it's between you and God are you with me now there can be a lot of sympathizers and a lot of opposes and a lot of critics but you're the man in the middle you're the man that's got to accept the challenge when David walked off of the hill all the hopes of that nation was now on a boy I want that to soak in all the hopes of that nation was on a boy you better know that God you better know that God only just a little bit before though David's own brothers tried to intimidate him and to tell him to go home so just because you're family of the preachers don't mean you're believers are you with me let me just shake you just a little bit just because you walked you pop you don't make you a believer there's no rapture ticket just because you said here I want to just share my burden with you and I shared it with my family today from this point forward I'm only looking at eternal things and my focus is on the promise petty nonsense I'm not interested in petty nonsense I'm not interested in are you with me now but my opinion don't matter my thoughts don't matter I'm only interested in the promise whether on did you watch the state of the union of they not interested they can rip speeches all they want to it only shows that this nation is not having a revival and there's bombs thats hanging waiting on it so don't put your trust in this flag don't put your trust in it's military our Chinese believers - not are housed in homes that can't go out into the street and one of our believers spit $300 of us money to be able to get enough food for two days they are proclaiming a promise that that plague will not come neither home most of them will lose everything they've got to survive but when it comes down to the end of it all if you've got God you've got everything these plagues are coming it's promised that they're coming they're promised to come will it stay in China no sir but you know as long as it's all the way over there it don't seem to bother over when we can hear of tragedy and other places you know it so you know you feel sorry for him until it gets to your house are you ask me that's just honest facts Adam fell and every every man woman boy and girl fell under him the earth fell lions that were pets are now predators birds that were once tame and docile are now predators and wild actually the the sky now becomes that rage against one another the seasons begin to struggle with one another here just in the last couple of days five tornadoes landed just above us here destroying the homes and destroying communities that wouldn't like that in the Garden of Eden sin came sin came because of evens fall it caused every baby that's born dead to be attributed to that sin every adulterous act that retained them rising of civilization and all kinds of education and scientific ability all goes back on the hands of Eve's for God could have wiped away the world of all mankind but Noah found grace in the eyes of God are you with me God sent his prophets and on the scene got depth lip to ear to a prophet now let me just let me just share this with you God his one of his first prophets was a man named Abraham who would become the father of his faith God promised him that I'm going to give you a son and that sons going to come by Sarah and the longer that he lived the more impossible it looked like that it would take place sometimes time becomes our worst enemy strength as it begins to deplete becomes our worst enemy because reasoning begins to get in and doubt begins to get in but Abraham continued to look at the promise and he believed God that God was more than able to raise him up and give him a son through Sarah he was 65 years old as a younger man when he begins to be hearing these things and 75 and and he begins to hear these things that God's going to give him a son and God begins to make covenants and promises with him he constantly looks at the promise but he couldn't produce it understand he couldn't produce it but God Himself would impute a portion of himself inside of Abraham God would come to Abraham sitting in a tent and then that tent he would set on the outside and look at Abraham in the eyes we would know and just kind of just just just putting some things together we would know that Abraham has spoke with this King because he recognized his voice he recognized his presence he recognized his promises and he knew that this was God and he knew that God knew his name and he knew his name change that he had changed him from April to Abraham he had changed Sarah from Sarah - Sarah put in an H putting a portion of his ownself in there Nance as Romans would say it was a tribute attend to him it was imputed unto him Abraham could not produce the promise but God himself in them could produce the promise just putting some things together so stay very with me just now Abraham we would come to find out that though he'd be a hundred years old and it looked totally impossible God specializes in impossibilities did you hear that God specializes in impossibilities and he took a hundred year old man and made him young again he took a 90 year old woman and made her such a beautiful woman until a king would water for a wife are you with me that's my god I'd like to quickly jump to Jesus prays and he teaches us how to pray there's God telling us how to communicate with him and how to have fellowship with him not to a priest not through your favorite preacher but you can talk lip to ear to God God hears your prayer and sometimes you pray and great faith like a mighty champion and then there's days that you pray help me sometimes you act like Superman sometimes you act like Clark Kent sometimes you're strong and you can speak a world into existence there's other days you're not even control of your own faculties but he's still God he's still God Jesus would get weary and lay in a boat and because could be so wore out and so tired from the meetings until he would lay there and a star would come and literally almost destroyed the whole atmosphere and literally Satan wanted to destroy the whole thing and they got all all uptight and in a situation but they needed to remember who was in the boat sometimes we need to remember we needed to wake Jesus [Applause] miracles we could talk about Zacchaeus sitting in a tree laughs in a tube Leopards we could talk about the woman at the well he had to answer for every situation he would walk to a pool that the angel would come down and literally thousands of people we'd be gathered at that pool waiting for the angel to trouble the water and Jesus with all of that power went to one man you know sometimes you go to a service and you think well you know nobody's getting anything what about you what about you well brother on nobody else seems to be getting into it what about you I'll be honest with you I'm here I'm here needing a touch from God tonight I could pull back in a pity Clark pity corner pull into a cave and say I'm just gonna set this all out but listen I'm missing a declaration every time the opportunity is I'm preaching and trying to take this body into the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and it's that Holy Ghost that'll heal this bike hallelujah hello I'd like to say this at this point I don't know how people do it without Jesus the difficult things that I have heard over the last three weeks I haven't shared all of it with you but they're difficult to call things that I've heard over the last three weeks it's difficult for a man and even in my spot I cannot imagine hearing those same things without Jesus I can't imagine not having the friends around the world that are praying and have a special prayer brother George Quinn just told me just a few minutes ago he said this week I walked and prayed all night long for you hallelujah do you think God's not going to hear that prayer hello now let me just say we're living in an hour not just for my healing not just for others healing but we're in an hour of expectation for a resurrection to happen this is our 4 rapture so we've got to have faith for more than just cancer to be destroyed our God is a cancer killer our God is bigger than every cancer devil in the world if you will remember in the cave when brother Branham met beings of the Lord it wasn't the angel that brought up cancer it was brother Branham that brought up cancer because it was the prevailing sickness of our day and the angel said not even cancer so to God cancer is nothing [Applause] now let me just say this to you in all of this in all of these thoughts here Jesus is pressing his way and he is the word looking at the word and the word says I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption so he can read sums 22 and Psalms 23 and Psalms 24 25 26 27 and she prophetically what the word says about him how much more can we look at 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 and revelations 10 1 2 7 2 8 all the way through to revelations 21 I see a new heaven and I see a new earth and realize we're part of the prophecy so God has provided for tomorrow he's not just provided for today he's provided for tomorrow [Applause] now just to give you an example two years before brother Branham told his audience about a boy in Finland God was getting it ready and then the day that it happened but the random actually walks away from that scene three times and looks back in the angel tells him to go look at it and then just before it happens he said now if this boy's not off of the ground in five minutes you called me a false prophet and that boy that his bones are sticking through his skin he prays over that boy and in just a few moments that boy wasn't just fully back together but he was standing totally well and there was such a faith that at the next meeting before brother branham ever got to the pulpit 12 rows of chairs in wheelchairs and clots were healed as he walked in come on Church it looked like all humanity was losing the race if Jesus didn't accomplish the plan if Jesus calls out to the Angels to deliver him we would be lost if Jesus would back up and and not go fully through the cross and through the beating we would not be able to be healed but being surrendered he allowed them to beat him like no other human being with the power oh brother on but I've seen people with a lot of power you've never seen one like Jesus Jesus had the power to call 10,000 angels to set him free but he had power did surrender his body under the cruelty of Rome to be beat like no other human being because you and I would need to be healed [Applause] [Music] you see we needed a redemption we needed more than just some good story we needed the life of God in the Old Testament they had the blood of bulls and goats but that didn't change the nature of the human being we needed God to come live on the inside of us many of us would make good religious people shed in a church but we need more than religion we need to be more than actors we need that God to live on the inside of us and purify our lives for the run but cancer there was a worse than cancer lived here at one time there was an old man that lived here one time that was taking me to hell he had all different kinds of last and all kind of desires and that man that King was taking me toward hell I'd say that every person in this building had that King living in the heart now let me just say write an offense as a dangerous spot to sit in church on Sunday and to be a complete different person on Tuesday it tells you the wrong king is sitting on your heart if you have to have two wardrobes to dress [Music] two different kind of makeup sinners to dress to different kind of music to listen to come on help me preach we can sing amazing grace here you go out and get in the car listen to some hunky punk can rien bones that you can't even understand or some Chinese nonsense or some disser that that's that's right out of the pit of hell it shows you're filthy it shows you that you're on your way to hell don't tell me about your depression when you're feeding it don't complain to me about being 400 pounds when you're feeding it uh-oh kind of dough nuts chocolates well I just can't get over my way quit feeding it I had children in my home you said I can't do nothing with my child you know little Johnny he's 12 years old he's got his own music cut it off tell him at that nonsense it's not in this house we don't watch that kind of stuff in this house get in here we don't listen to that kind of music in this car [Music] [Applause] now everything that can be shaken will be shaken so we've accepted the challenge to be an astronaut of this age and as we go along even preachers that are just kind of hanging around even for years that have protected themselves as some great leader or they have some wild doctrine or they're trying to pull people to themselves that'll be shook off this church its goal is project Jesus Christ the message of the hour if I die tomorrow Boris I want this message preached till the day of the rapture [Applause] well brother on I look down the road and they're doing this or they're doing matter they're watching these things or they're dressing that way don't matter I got my eyes on Jesus we're not message Baptists message Methodists we're not blenders with the world we have been called to come up ever [Applause] don't let the prophet of God's voice become a stranger to your home it has rapturing faith laid on the inside of it there is ZERO rapturing faith on NBC CBS ABC whatever zero that's just information to gather to get you through this temporal law but you feed on the body word of the son of man and it will do wonders for the character of your life to live in this dark evil age accept the challenge Jesus did not give up going toward Gaga this hill he did not let the critics and the scoffers to make fun of him he kept pressing he didn't have another peer now let me just drop something here Jesus didn't have another man on the earth with the same commission brother Branham didn't have another man on the earth with the same Commission he had some incredible men around him but they didn't have the Commission to carry the message of the hour we've never had another messenger vindicated like William Miriam pranam and I'll never be ashamed of that name he is our brother he's not God he made mistakes but God allowed him a channel to which we could see happen and the word may be revealed to where we could take a rap shot Jesus didn't pay any attention to his office he was bigger than them you have to do that as well sometimes you're going to have scoffers and have people make fun of you just stand your ground that's more than a gun law stand your ground Satan I don't have to put up with you saying that all had to put up with you I don't have to put up with you when time is a drug head on our bicycle was coming up my driveway he came by three-quarters up the wide driveway and we met him me and one of the boys here not gonna point him out one of the boys here met him with the machine with two machine guns he left had a flat tire and he stopped it at the air tank at the bottom at the garage and the brother and the man told him said better be careful with that air tank to blow your bike up and he sort of did and he said who are them guys at the end of the road he said well that one Aversa preacher but you better be careful with it he'll shoot you well I want the devil to know I'll shoot and I've warned it you come up my driveway there's a lot of warning signs I'm not politically correct and I notice Huck and Vijay are not either when it comes to the Word of God let us warn the devil this is our ground this is our promised land and every promises not every scripture every verse every lawn it's mine [Applause] the scripture says I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus the scripture says hear of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world 2nd Corinthians three and five oh not that we are sufficient of herself to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God Paul said it like this when God he had prayed that this thing would leave him thrust and God sent us back to him
