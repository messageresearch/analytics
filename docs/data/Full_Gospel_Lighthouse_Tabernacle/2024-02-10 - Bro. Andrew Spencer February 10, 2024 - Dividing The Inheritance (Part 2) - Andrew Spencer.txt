Break Every Chain Break Every Chain to break every chain oh Break Every Chain oh Break Every Chain father we realize Lord Lord let the presence of elhad eyes in this room the great Jehovah that was is still here today Father what a privilege it is to know father that this is not just a tradition of man lord it's not it's not created by by men's doings Lord Jesus but this is what you set up before the world began Lord this is what you had in your mind father Lord predestinated moments for an elect people father to be sitting here Lord in the presence of The Great I Am to be feasting upon Mana has been stored up for such a season as this father and Lord to thank that tonight right here in the presence of your children father that you'll begin to break bread of life and you begin to show yourself openly to them Lord that you're not just the god of yesterday but you're the god of today Father we need to see you father we need to see you high and lifted up just like Abraham had been in his condition for so many years father lord and there came a time when MDC came and sat at the tent with him and a miracle happened in his life we're sitting here father we're at the tent door father Lord the back has been turned father we recognize that you're here that same angel that same Jesus that walked to Abraham's door is here knocking at our our heart's door beckoning who shall open it father the latch ain't on the outside it's on the inside father so Lord we want to open our hearts Lord we want to open our hearts to anything father that you have for us father Lord there's nothing to great and there's nothing too small father that we would not receive Lord Jesus whatever it is from thy mind Lord we want to open oursel to it Lord for every person here sitting under the sound of our voice just now Lord I ask God that you would bring healing to their bodies that you would bring bring restoration to their soul father and you would begin to relieve the pressures of Life father Lord may we be persistent and perseverant here tonight Lord to press into the promises of God Lord no matter what the things of Life have been stacked up against us Lord may we press on Father Lord Against Humanity against emotions Lord against against our own will father we want to say not our will but thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven Lord I pray God that you'd come tonight and you'd minister to us father this service has been set up in such a way and now God we just want to be careful father that you'd have your Liberty here tonight you begin to minister to your people in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and verse three and Joshua chapter 1 verse three as well i' like to say we want to welcome all of our visitors here this evening and say God richly bless you it's an honor to be with you in the presence of the Lord is the greatest part of each and every one of our weeks to to be able to gather ourselves and assemble ourselves as we see the day approaching us and just want to make you aware that after for this service tonight we'll be having uh communion tonight be taking of the Lord's Supper so brother Ron will come after the preaching of the word and deliver the communion service this evening and so we're just looking unto the Lord and we recognize that it is our duty to fulfill these ordin ordinances and so we just want to reverence our heart and we know that the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians in chapter 11 that that the reason why there's many sick amongst you and and many sleep among you is because they don't discern the Lord's body so we want to be very careful to discern the Lord's body and we want to reverence everything that we do here we want to be very respectful about the house of the Lord but we want to enjoy his presence as well amen so you just exam examine yourself while the word is going forth and make sure your life is in line with those things and I believe that special Miracles can take place at the at Communion services and so so we're just looking unto the Lord tonight tonight Ephesians chap 1 and verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings let's say that together with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself now brother Brandon would say that that word is a very hard word that predestinate it because it scared a lot of denominationalism away because they didn't fully understand it but that's a that's a that's a bride word right there having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will if you didn't fully understand or didn't grasp the power of predestination and you didn't believe in it I'd hate to be you amen but I'm glad to be me and understand the power of predestination also Joshua chap 1 and verse three and before we before we read that I'd like to share with you this quote from the message adoption brother brandham said he said oh let's just stop one more minute here referring back to Ephesians here he said in Heavenly places now just not out anywhere but in Heavenly places not just out anywhere but in Heavenly places he said we are assembled in Heavenly it means that the p position of the believer that if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up or the church is prayed up and we're ready for the message and we've assembled ourselves together as Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected set together in Heavenly places now we are Heavenly heavenlies in our souls our spirit has brought us in the Heavenly atmosphere oh brother that there you are there you are a Heavenly atmosphere oh what could happen tonight what could happen tonight if we would be setting here in in a Heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus amen Joshua chapter 1 and verse three every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even under the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee perfectly in line brother brother Shannon be strong and of a good courage for under this people Shout thou divide an inheritance the land which I swear under their fathers to give them may God's blessings be upon the reading of the word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord again we'd like to take a thought this weekend and carry on our thought from last weekend on dividing dividing The Inheritance and we understand that by the preaching of the message in this last day Ministry that Jesus is our Joshua that Jesus is our Joshua so we recognize immediately that the God that was with Joshua is the god that is with us today so we understand that by the preaching or the anointing of the hour that we are living in that we are here that that with what the leadership that we are under is the leadership of our Lord Jesus Christ and just like you would type it with Joshua under his generation so you can type it in this generation that Jesus Christ just like Joshua was the power that was moving the children of Israel along their Journeys that that Jesus is the general that Jesus is the moving power that is in the Church of the Living God and you can go throughout all the Old Testament you can go throughout the first five books of of the Bible of the Torah there and you can see that every time that the children of God would move they would move by the leadership of the Holy Ghost they were led by the pillar of fire and as we as we referenced it last weekend in Exodus chapter 23 and 20 the Bible said behold I send an angel before the to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared to bring thee into the place which I have prepared I heard a song this week about about a man or a Christian song and he was singing he said I don't really care what what the destiny is as long as the journey is with you Lord Jesus but I want you to know as the Church of the Living God that there is a place there is a place for the Church of the Living God and it is that place that the angel of the Lord has prepared to you do you recognize as as the Church of the Living God that you have a destiny a destiny a place that is prepared for you to think that tonight that there is a place that the Lord Jesus Christ has already set out there's a place by him tonight to know that there's a place by him Moses would look and he would see him when he was walking by the Cliff of the rock notice that God would say unto him he said there's a place by me when Jesus is hanging on the cross and there was there was one on his right side and one is on his left side and one ridiculed him but the one didn't mock him but he said Lord remember me there's a place there's a place by our lord Jesus and he's wondering who is going to take that place but to think that tonight no matter where you go no matter what you try to hide from or no matter what enemy might come up against you there's a place that you're destined unto you and there's not one devil in hell that can rob you from your destiny come on somebody I know there was an old group back in the day when I was a teenager they called it Destiny's Child but they had it completely wrong I'm the Destiny's Child I'm the son of Destiny because my Lord Jesus Christ has picked out my path he's picked out my plan and I know exactly where I'm going well how do you know that brother Andrew because I know what Jesus said he said I came from God and I go to God so I know that as long as I am a part of him and he's a part of me that I came from the mind of God and I'll go back to the mind of God brother random said election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks on to Destiny he said don't forget that he said that election looks back here here it is he said I was a cooker he said I was born in sin I was shaped in iniquity and I come into the world speaking lies born amongst sinor Sinners and father and mother and all my family were Sinners I was a cooker he said but all of a sudden I became a weak grain he said how did it happen he said that was it he said election made it happen election made it happen you see you you brother Bandon would say it in 1964 in question and answers he said as long as you are here you are always going to have that sticky nature that cuck nature he said but the only way that that cuur could ever be a weak grain he said it I believe he said it like this he said that that wheat grain has to be transmitted on the inside of that cuur and he said the only way that it'll ever come out he said it's got to be buried and it's got to die in there he said that's the only way you can look like a cabur you can look like a cabur but if you've ever got if you ever got something transmitted to the part of your soul and you get buried in Jesus Christ it'll come to life so that sticky nature it'll always be grabbing against things I I pulled one of them little cucker burls off my dog this week she didn't like it too much she got the yelping and everything else but it remind me it reminded me about this old sticky nature that we got it clings on to things sometimes but remember that's not the real you the real you is what God deposited before the foundation of the world is that right now we realize that election has placed us where we are it wasn't anything that we did but it was his election and his grace that placed us where we are and you go to studying out the message and go looking out throughout the Bible you can find that over there that Moses took them as far as he could go is that right he took them as far as he could go in the land and you can study it out and you can think about you can think about scoffield would say it like this that it took them 13 months to get from Egypt all the way to cadesh Baria and it took them 38 years from cadesh Baria to enter into the promised land but they were simply only a couple weeks away from going in back there but to think that there there Moses could only take them so far he could only take them so far because it was not his ministry you know realize that there are capacities upon Ministries that they can only go so far they can only go so far and I I don't want to say this with disregard William brandom ran his race with everything that's within him but he can't run the race that you're running right now because he's not here he's in the grave but there's somebody that's going to pick up there's somebody that's going to pick up Moses's mes message Joshua and preach what Moses is preaching and take it right on in to the coming of the Lord so there was a capacity upon brother brenham's life it wasn't it wasn't that Moses wasn't good enough it wasn't that he wasn't good enough but as MOS his ministry had wed where it could only go to it was not his job to divide the inheritance but it was Joshua's commission to stand there and to divide that inheritance is that right that's just like brother random would say it like this he said Jesus's commission he said he brought them right up to the edge of it he took them right all the way up there to their possessions but he couldn't divide it to them he said but it was the Holy ghost's job to positionally place the church in its power to think about that that Jesus took us all the way he took his disciples they were with him all the way but the Holy Ghost came and set the church in order and when you go to get to reading Acts chapter 2 and you begin to read reading the book of Acts it's not the Acts of the Apostles it's the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles and to think that that is how Jesus Christ set up his church that way he set up his church that way but the Holy Ghost was the one that was placing them in their in their natural or in their spiritual land just like not just like Joshua was placing the children of Israel in their natural land the Holy Spirit Spirit has been placing the church positionally in the land in their position that they belong in in their inheritance and when you know that you're in your message and when you know that you're in your position everything can line up but if something is off if something is blocking the Avenue you simply got to get it out of the way if there's sin in your life you can never go no further there's a story I I read it a few weeks ago about about there was there was this water Mainline breaking in college housing in college housing and they they had they they searched it all over and couldn't find the source of the problem and they they went in there and had plumbers come in and they couldn't find the source of the issue so they went in there plumbers they had all kinds of these commercial plumbers come in and try to go in there and they finally found the source of the problem it was a toad that had got in there and had blocked the main line but they said the only only way it could have ever got in there was it came in in the state of a tadpole but when it grew up it begin to block the lines and you might be able to handle the little foxes you might be able to handle the little bitty things but if you don't get it out of your life it'll come in as a tadpole and it'll block the lines but thank God we got some professional plumbers down here we got some fivefold Ministry down here that don't mind loosening up the pipes and letting the Holy Ghost water flow freely so Joshua placed them in their natural land but at the Holy Spirit our Joshua is placing the church in its spiritual position we are now seated in Heavenly places now when Jesus would come and he would say there in John chapter 14 and verse 12 he said verily verily I say unto you that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall I do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that that the father might be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it I know there's a lot of people that like to thinker try to put that off for days gone by that he that believeth on me the works that I do so he do go also and Greater Works than he shall do and a lot of people try to put that on the prophet and said that was only for him but I happen to believe that I can read the Bible a little bit better than some of these intellectual so-called Giants because the Bible says right there he that believeth on me and I happen to believe that he wasn't just talking about one man but I happen to believe he was talking about you I believe that you can so position yourself as Sons and Daughters of God right here in the scripture that you can perfectly line yourself up yeah and you can watch the physical manifestation of the power of the Holy Ghost I thought you was talking about dividing inheritance that's exactly what I'm talking about these things are for you let me tell you what Joshua's job was to do was go out there and line out the borders and say this is exactly for you you can stay in these parameters little bride let me tell you that's what the message did it lined out the borders it lined out the borders because that's what we are under we're under a Joshua commission and that's what William Bram did when he go to studying out the Feast of the trumpet William brandham tried to go in there and he tried to preach the seven trumpets but remember that the angel the Lord stopped him and said it's not your job to preach them trumpets them trumpets are for Israel but he come through in the Feast of the trumpets and he started lying out the borders he started telling us that Ephesians parallels Joshua and he find out the borders for the Church of the Living God and I believe that it's if it if it's laying in the message then we've got every right brother Timothy to preach it with everything that's within us I believe it with everything that's within us that we ought to be able to preach what William Brandon preached and live this message to the fullness and its entirety and if we're going to do it it's got to be in sincerity and it's got to be in truth and when it's done that way it'll bring a power that'll squash Satan that's why Satan wants to keep you so filled up with carnality he wants to keep you so filled up with the things of the world that you can't be sincere but if he can if Jesus can get you under his control under sincerity and then watch the Power with character come well Glory power without character is satanic but character power with character is fit to rain that's why I'm not talking to a bunch of chickens I'm talking to Kingdom living people that's why William brandham could come and preach to you the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride it's because a character has matched on Earth what he is in heaven H I'm trying to be careful not let the preacher out too much cuz I know we got another service right after this but remember I'm I'm I'm just going to make some points and y'all going to have to use your own imaginations to let Revelation roll don't let your imagination roll but let Revelation roll and you're going to let you're going to have to let yourself take some take some roads that I would T typically take you on tonight but notice what he says in in the ephes or the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church age book he said remember this that Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts notice not in the false church not in a halfway church but the true church there's three kind of Believers in every church service real real unbelievers and makeb Believers and I tell you who I'm scared about it's to make Believers I ain't scared about them unbelievers and I definitely ain't scared about the real believers but it's in make Believers in Hypocrites that scare me but he notice what he says but Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts so let me say it like this I don't have I don't know any other way to say it like this if this church don't line up with what we read in the book of Acts then we need to go back to the drawing board because Christ in his true church church will be a continuation of the book of Acts he said but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit notice the Antichrist spirit will come into church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless that's one thing I don't want to be I don't want to be lukewarm I don't want to be formal and I don't want to be powerless he said but it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works that she will be an invincible Army so if the church gets a true revelation of who he is who Satan is in the framework of the church but catches a true revelation of who she is that she can do the same thing that Jesus did and greater I tell you what I'd do if I was a jebusite I'd do everything within my power to keep Joshua from preaching this come on somebody if I was a if I was an amot I'd do everything within my power to stop them from coming into my land ain't that right so what will Satan try to do he will try to tear down the power power of the word so he goes in there and try to put it off and delay it for some other day come on somebody so if I was if I was a jebusite I'd say now Joshua Don't You Preach that message Joshua don't teach them how to get the Holy Ghost Joshua don't teach them how to come in here and dispossess The Inheritance Joshua don't do [Music] it Hallelujah but he couldn't stop Joshua he couldn't stop him from going in there and preaching what the law had already said let me move on but you know man that's that's I want to let him out but I better hold on to him but Joshua Joshua signifies and means Jehovah savior that he shall save his people that's what Joshua is he is Jesus he shall save his people from their sins notice notice why would they ever got back there and never got to Waring and never got to worrying and fearing about things about where they were going to go and how they were going to get in there when you got a savior leading way come on now how why do you get so tore up about what's going on in Le osia why do you get so bombarded by what Fox news is saying and CNN is saying they ain't Our Savior but I got a savior that's leading me all the way I don't have to worry I don't have to fear I don't have to fret I don't care what the doctor says I got a savior that's leading me all the way Joshua's commission was to go in there and lay out the borders of the land it's exactly in line with the last day ministry under this anointing that here we are that the God that was is the god that is that's why I can have every right to stand here and say that what he did for sister Daryl ohania when she was back there and she was crippled up laid in that condition for 17 years Mar said she was laid up in there crippled up like a spider draw up in there he said but I was led by a vision to go by her way he said when I walked by her way he said the angel of the Lord T tap me on the shoulder said recognize that door he walked in there and said is there a woman in here and there she was got the reading that our Menan Bible brother brandom asked her said are you a Believer she said I'm a Believer brother random said I simply just prayed a prayer over top of her he said and all of a sudden he said people thought that a funeral was place he said because there was so much noise down there he said people thought that Mrs darl ohania had actually died he said it absolutely was a funeral he said the old one had died and there was a new one born brother vham saw her down there on the street several years later when he was down there at the butcher shop getting some meat down there she came up to him said brother random you remember them people came to me and told me that I was just excited and I let the nerves down down in my legs she said well if that's the case I'm still excited today well you can blame it on excitement or not but I still believe that I the one that's destined for the Rapture call it excitement call it emotion but I happen to believe I know what I was like but I know what it's like to be free I ain't just excited I got the god of Joshua on my side this is my [Applause] land well maybe you ain't crippled but maybe you're bound by some homosexual Spirit but by the power of the Holy Ghost one [Applause] word blessed be the name of the Lord what Joshua do he went out there and laid out the borders for a new generation cuz in the Bible tells us that them old Fighters bunch of naysayers and old Fighters back there they wouldn't go on to their full possession and I tell you right now God ain't going to let no old fighters of the message go in in any other way but by the new birth come on somebody stop fighting about how hot it is in here stop fighting about how cold it is in here stop fighting well the lights just wasn't R and this wasn't just right we got a Rapture to take stop fighting about this one took my seat and that one took my seat let's go on the higher things Joshua knew Joshua knew that there was a new generation that was coming up up Joshua didn't have to worry about his commission it was given to him brother Steven all he had to do was stand out there and get under the anointing of it you ever been into a place where you didn't feel like worshiping God and all of a sudden the anointing came and inspiration begin to strike your heart and all of a sudden you steep right into it Joshua had to Simply step into the inspiration of Jehovah because when Josh what started laying out the borders he went out there and brother brandom said he caught inspiration about what them Hebrew mothers had said when they were giving birth to those tribes and when she would scream out Ephraim it was placing him by the sea or this one over here so they caught the inspiration in their birth pains it was placing the church and the church has went through birth pains she's went through Wars but it's positionally place tonight and Joshua simply he begin to catch that inspiration and he would place this one here and he would place that one there what was it he was simply lining out the portion that was luded to every tribe out there in Palestine but their name had a meaning and it showed up where they were built to be at let me tell you something the reason why the men andite or the the reason why the Methodist Church couldn't go no further why because brother bandam said they wouldn't stand still long enough to wash their spotted garments and that's a problem that too many times people around the message they don't stand still long enough to get themselves good and washed off let me tell you something you can never walk into the presence of God smelling like a [Applause] hog forgive me I know what y'all know what hogwash is but sometimes you need to get the hogwash off of you so that you can walk into the presence of God you said well I'm so busy I'm busy about this I'm busy about that that's what the Methodist Church said when William brandham saw her in a vision said I've been so busy I can't clean up my garments what are you so busy with that you can't spend time in the presence of the Lord and refresh yourself and wash yourself under the anointing of the Lord oh glory be to God they were placed by their name Abram could never bring forth an Isaac under the name of the high father so God had to change his name he had to change his name brother Thomas to Abraham to Abraham and what did he do when he changed his name from Abraham he changed him from high father mother to the father of many nations it ain't just what's laying in the name but it's what is in the name because he didn't just put an H in there he put a part of himself on the inside of there that's why Satan doesn't want you get into this message because this message will change your name will you say well you don't know what you're talking about brother Ang I absolutely do know what I'm talking about I might be a preacher and you might think I'm crazy but I know exactly what I'm talking about he didn't just change Abraham's name he changed Sarah's name to match it he put himself on the inside of her that's why William bam would say it like this I'll no longer call you church because you're not a part of the church you're a part of the bridegroom your name matches a reflection of [Applause] Heaven that's if we're ever going to move into it if we're ever going to walk into there we got to come under this message we got to d oury s but I believe that too many times that Satan tries to come in and he tries to put spiritual amnes in the Church of the Living God and make them forget who they are make them forget who they are they get shocked so much by the world they can't remember who their true identity is but if they can ever set still long enough maybe they can just climb over a hill maybe they can just go around the train quarters maybe they just slip around and maybe catch sight of home one time you ain't going to just see an old man sitting out there on some cabin porch you're going to see Popa God out there and he's going to be looking for you and he's going to have his arms wide open don't you try to worry is he going to receive me he's already been looking for you he's been looking for you he's been looking for you but it's time you shake yourself Shake Yourself and come start taking a walk down through the message You Walk This Way Before why can't you walk it again praise the Lord I noce praise the Lord let me go on here brother Rand takes on in that day on Calvary he said I notice he said the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer but to cast out Devils by prayer not not not only just to heal the Sick by prayer but cast Devils out by prayer he said but to impart eternal life to Believers he said the Holy Ghost was coming and given to the hands of the church to impart life he said that's what Calvary meant you think that tonight that when Jesus is standing there and he and he delivers John 14 and12 that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also that he recognize that it wasn't just going to be in quantity and it wasn't going to be greater in quality but it was going to go beyond what even Jesus himself could do what is it he your ministry is going to go beyond Peter's Ministry Paul's Ministry was going to go beyond what Jesus's Ministry did in itself well that's pretty rough right there brother Andrew I'm bring I'm bringing right out the message tonight that notice that Greater Works than need shall he do because I go because I go now notice this that Jesus never could preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost had not been yet given but when Jesus came and he sacrificed his own life I'm quoting you the prophet how when Jesus came and he sacrificed his own life he said that's how the Greater Works is done that by the imparting of Life do you recognize that right now under the preaching of the word that there is powerful words that are taking place moments that maybe you don't even understand but this is the Greater Works the imparting of life that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the Greater Works it is the Greater Works don't you recognize tonight it ain't just got to be me it can be every one of you you can stand out there on the street and begin to impart life I ain't just talking about walking up some random preacher random stranger up there on the street and start saying I impart life to you I impart life to you I'll tell you you say well how How can any man do that brother brandom said a Son of God can do that a Son of God can do that and this is how you do it repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you say how in the world can a man do that that's how does it by the preaching of the word well I ain't no Preacher Brother Andrew but a prophet said that a Son of God can impart life did not Jesus said that whosoever sins you remit they remitted in heaven now the Catholic Church took that and it started saying well we've got the power we've got the power so we can roll your sins away but he Le the prophet came in and showed us what Jesus meant there that it was actually that it was perfectly in line with acts chap 2 and: 38 that that is the Greater Works you said well brother Andrew what are you talking about I'm talking about acts two I'm talking about acts two that when Peter got up there and he started preaching when he started preaching and the Holy Ghost begin to pour out up that day on the day of Pentecost there they come out there staggering and speaking in tongues they come out there on that day and then Peter started preaching a sermon he started preaching a sermon I believe that some of us preachers could take a take a real good sermon right here from Peter he preached the 15minute sermon a 15minute sermon and the Bible said in verse 41 2 and 41 that on that day that 3,000 Souls were added to the Church of the Living God what was what am I saying unto you I'm saying it's perfectly in line with acts 10 and44 that while Peter yet spake these words words the Holy Ghost fell on them now I want you to know I'm not Angel Gabriel tonight I'm not Angel Gabriel tonight and he ain't Angel Gabriel tonight but Angel Gabriel Angel Gabriel could not impart that word but it was a word from almighty God that deposited on the inside of Mary what was it that angel that picked up Phillip over there when he saw that there was a man over there reading the book of Isaiah took him over there the angel knew what the message was but it had to come through Humanity I'm going to clear something up real quick right here don't you understand why Satan is trying so hard to destroy the ministry don't you see why he's battling Tim puit and Ron Spencer and all these other brothers so hard it's because he recognizes that they've got more power than he's ever attained himself to that if they get the preaching under the inspiration of the word that imparting of Life can take [Applause] place it's a word that places you in your possession you recognize that all that inspiration LED them to the place that they were in you can go back and you can read Genesis chapter 49 and you can read the whole entire chapter and you can see that when when when Jacob is getting ready to come to the end of his life he's coming there to the end of his life and the Bible said in in the very last verse that Jacob pulled his feet up in the bed and he begin to give up the ghost but notice that he begin to line out the borders of where every one of them tribes and those and those prophets would be at in that land now brother bham said this he said I can perfectly take a map and I could line it over top of that scripture over in Genesis chapter 49 and he said I can tell you that all the way back there that Jacob prophesied where those children of Israel would be at in this day he said but they never got there until May the 7th of 1946 when an angel was up there meeting me and commissioning me to take this message to a gentile bride Hallelujah and to think that tonight the Church of the Living God is in place that the same angel [Music] that the same angel that put the children of Israel back in their Homeland for 5,000 years it's been hanging there 5,000 years it's been hanging there but one night one night does it matter what one night means does it matter if the preacher is a church how about it we'll just take an intermission real quick y'all do this on y it matters it matters it matters if the musicians are here it matters it matters if you're here predestination has led you to the moment that you're in don't you think it ain't some coincidence that on the same night that an angel was commissioning our Prophet that Israel was on her way to her Homeland blessed be the name of the Lord don't you think it's amazing don't you think it's amazing to think that tonight that the Church of the Living God for the first time in 2,000 years that the pillar of fire has made its return and it's over the Church of the Living God I can tell you right now it's here I can tell you right now it's here I ain't seen the brother Andrew I have in you you're full proof whether we see it or not you're full proof that the pillar of fire is here come on somebody you ain't got to see it with your eyes I'm looking at it I'm looking at the [Applause] possession there super natural being that's always with this message it's always with this message and he's placing a chch of the Living God right there an angel comes and he's with this message didn't just you seen those healing campaigns you go back and you watch them I'm I'm you forgive me but I'm taking you as a church I'm taking you on a journey you forgive me might I might be here a while but I'm taking you on a journey but I want you to go back I want you to watch deep car through the deep I want you to watch Chicago campaign I want you to watch I want you to watch the 20th century Prophet watch those things see see those things watch it young people you ain't watched it tell your mama tonight instead of a movie turn this on Hall you're commissioned stand there watch it William ROM s there and he's in between two worlds what is it that same angel that was standing there said now you feel a funny feeling here but don't you be scared that's the angel of the lord it's that same one that is here right now and he's making sure that seed gets to its right destination now surely if he can take an old man and make him a young man and bring forth an Isaac and then have four more children after after Sarah's done gone surely he can take care of you it's that same one that sitting at the tent door think that the same one now is this the patient is this a patient now you're not from here and he starts taking them down through a journey what is it he said you don't see it he said but standing between me and you is the Angel of the Lord he said you feel that feeling it's come all over you he said you're completely healed it's over now that same healing Angel is here he's here we've seen him in the building one time when brother Josh Bennett was preaching down there brother Tim puits meeting there in October on is there any sons brother Josh you can see it on tape when brother Ron and brother Wayne are sitting there on a stage this is complete inspiration but they're sitting there on a stage and brother Ron and brother Wayne both look over said there's an angel standing right there brother brother Ron said there's an angel here brother brother Wayne leans over said I know I see him and brother Josh didn't didn't know what was going on but he kept going over there and laying his hands on the post brother Wayne said that that angel was was standing there watching Josh preach he was watching Josh preach and Josh just just kept coming back over and over again and laying his hand on that post now that angel is here with that message I'm not giving over to imaginations or Illusions but I want you to know that same Angel is here I was preaching here on on New Year's Day only this only reason I'm telling you this is because brother Greg said it but brother Greg brother Greg sent me a note when I was in Belgium I about have myself a fit I was up there in that up up hotel room man about to got a heal Billy cutting shucking some corn right up here but he sent me this he said I don't know if you noce this or not he said but when you are preaching your message and brother brother Greg's got the clip he'll give it to you don't ask me for it he'll give it to you but he said while you preaching he said there was a there was a light that flashed over top of you he said and you started saying a shadow can't hurt you a shadow of a line can't hurt you a shadow of a sword can't hurt you he said and when you said that there was a light that flashed over top of you sister Gabrielle was sitting back there in the back and thinking did I really see that or not but when she heard that testimony it lined up now why I'm not trying to say anything to you but I'm simply trying to say this to you that that's Angel it's right here right now now if William brandham could take a map and lay it over top of them scriptures in Genesis 49 and it perfectly lines up if it perfectly lines up a 5,000 year old prophecy then how much more should the Church of the Living God if the true church of Mark 16 is the standard as is the pattern then we ought to be able to lay Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 3 Mark chapter 16 lay it over top of this church and perfectly be in line with the message of the hour Hallelujah that same Angel is here I feel him in the room I know he's here by his word but I feel him in the room I know he's here brother Brady brother Brady would stand behind this pull pit years year after year the Black Eagle he would stand here behind this pulpit and he would give his testimony he'd give his testimony about how that he'd went there in 1962 to the United States he went back in 1965 and you can hear you can hear in the message what is the attraction on the mountain when the real Tom Brady was called out in the message and he was sitting there he was sitting there and brother Brady brother Brady said when his eyes the prophet's eyes come over me he said I just ducked and he said he went over top of me he said but I could feel him looking over me I'm just following him I he said but like he said I begin to look he said all of a sudden his eyes lock with mine he said his eyes lock with mine and he said he said there he said I he said there's a colored man sitting back here he said said he's not from here he's from overseas and he's got a he's got a burden on his heart he's got a burden on his heart and he said it's for his wife it's for his wife he said you not from here he said you're all the way from Jamaica you're all the way from Jamaica he said he said and your wife's got problems with her feet she's she's got problems with her feet he said Mr Brady she'll be all right she'll be all right brother BR said I had not told anybody about that he said I wanted to see him but I hadn't told any of them brothers about the need that I had he said I had that letter right there on my heart he said I simply wrote a letter Hallelujah I simply wrote a letter back to my wife Gloria which was a real queen which was a real queen she he said I wrote her a letter he said I wrote her a letter he said she'd been in the bed for so many days and she couldn't get up out of that bed with that condition those swollen feet like that said something come over and said you know what I think I just walked down to the post office today he said many miles up the hills rough roads he said but she took a journey down to the post office he said when she got to the post office and she's standing there at the post office and she opens up the envelope and she reads it said all of a sudden said a cool feeling went over top of her body and the swelling in her feet went went completely off and her feet never bothered her one day of her life again now it happened it happened and the mail was on its way don't you give up on the Promises the male is on the way don't you give up the healing Angel has a position for you and it's not seated but it's standing Hallelujah Hal Hall I don't care what you have need of tonight this is completely completely fresh but I don't care what you have need of special Miracles were done in communion they right brother Clarence how many people can identify that special Miracles are done throughout communion I believe that we've rightly divided the word of the Lord and I believe that we've discerned the body of the Lord and I believe that you have the power to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I believe that with all my heart if I didn't believe that then I would take you out I would take you out and tell you that we ought not to believe this but I believe it with all my heart do you have the Holy Ghost I want to show a hands then you have every right to lay your hands on your brother and your sister and pronounce healing over their body special Miracles were done the prophet one time was holding holding communion and they come to him and he had all the he had all the little cups there in his hand had them setting there and they come to him and say brother brother brandom said we're we're out of wine there's no more wine brother brother random just simply asked the congregation to Bow their head now Jesus Took water and he turned to Wine but I want you to noce exactly in line where we are that when he's standing out there in Sportsman holla and he's asking for squirrels or the angel of the Lord ask him what are you hunting for he said he never said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I asked for this squirrel he he said these words let there be a squirrel here let there be a squirrel there what is it showing to the Church of the Living God that we're right in our inheritance as Adam that the same one that the same one that said let there be light that's a little bit out there for me brother angre that's a little bit out there let me tell you if you got the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost Jesus never stood up there when he was laying his hands on Legion and said in the name of Jesus Christ he didn't have to he was Jesus I know I I know you can take that and you can run every which way you want to with it but I want you to know youve got that much Jesus on the inside of you that William brandham said he simply asked them to Bow their head and we are standing up here there's about 15 of us went up there to Jeffersonville one time 2015 Randy is on his wheelchair little scooter thing riding riding around everybody remember that we all did anyway anyways riding around on that little scooter thing anyways but the brother that was there you forgive me it's the way my mind works brother Phillips anyways he's standing there he's telling us he said now brother brandom ask us to Bow our heads he said I bow my heads but I didn't close my eyes he said but I bow my head and he said I'm looking up and he said I simply hear Brother brandom start praying and he said all of a sudden he said them little glasses are full of wine amen that's a little bit out there for me he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also now if we're in our land if we're in our land then we ought to have every right is is there any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church and anoint them with oil and pray the prayer of faith over them and the sick shall be saved what is it it's the same atonement that was released at Calvary is the same one that saves you is the same one that heals you so let us stand so let us stand Lay Your Hands over on your brother Lay Your Hands over on your sister is is there any sick amongst you now I'm trying your faith tonight I'm trying your faith because Jesus said in John chapter 5 and 24 that he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me shall have everlasting life you have the power to pronounce healing over top of bodies you have the power to call Down Heaven if Elijah's servant could go up there and see the size of a man's hand how much more more as a son and daughter of God should you be able to go up before the Throne of God and say I see healing for this sister I see healing for my brother don't try to put it off for some other day and don't try to put it out of this room but you're right here in the house you're right here in the house you're right here in his presence father we come before you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before we

to come before you with sincerity and Truth father Lord we want to come before you father recognizing our position as the Church of the Living God we recognize Lord Jesus that it wasn't just for you and it wasn't just for Paul and it wasn't just for Peter and we're not Jesus and we're not Paul but you're still Jesus Lord I pray the Jesus on the inside of the Church of the Living God would rise up on the inside of her somebody would Ascend their faith would Ascend into the higher Heights and they would begin to call down manifestations of the Holy Ghost father I recognize Lord Jesus that there are those that are freshly back into the house of the Living God and they need an experience with you like never before but while hands are laid upon them I pray Lord Jesus if Peter's Shadow could walk over top of them and they would receive healing over their body Lord this is more than a man here tonight this is the same one that created in the very beginning and said let there be you're here in the building right now father our precious brother Ron has scans and all kinds of doctor's events that's coming up this week things things that are coming up father that'll predetermine his future in this natural realm but father we condemn the very powers of hell right now as the church of the Living God we unite ourselves under one Faith under one baptism under one spirit and we ask Lord that you would come and you would bring healing to the body father we lay our hands upon him and Lord we send these words father into the future Lord Jesus and we ask father that you condemn every Cil of cancer you'd break every Power of Hell father Lord Jesus you already condemned it 2,000 years ago but may the body of Ron Spencer match the miracle that's on its way father Lord Jesus Lord not just for brother Ron but for this church Lord Jesus Lord as we unite oursel together father we got one thing that's out there in front of us and it's the Rapture Lord Jesus Lord we want to unite oursel under this message oh God and ask God that you would come Lord and You' begin to clean out our lives oh God and we examine ourselves before we go to this sacred moment Lord we ask God that you'd

hearts Lord I pray father that you forgive our debts as we forgive those oh God that sinned against us Lord Jesus Lord give us thy kingdom oh God give us th power oh God lord I pray Lord Jesus for this church that they would come and Rise under the power of it like never before Lord may you do the miraculous right here oh God lord so many testimonies have came forth from two weeks ago we could prophesy we could stand here and begin to let prophetic words come off over our lips Lord Jesus of things that you've already done but lord it's no longer prophecy it's reality father we've seen these things we're watching it unfold now father I pray that you would allow Our Lives to match the message like never before in the name of Jesus Christ amen let the musicians come hallelujah hallelujah as

love you let just all sing it together as a testimony a desire unto him Lord [Music] I then I [Music] ever you're [Music] so Lord I let's mean it with all of our hearts now let's sing it one more time Lord [Music] I I [Music] ever your [Music] God bless you you can be seated just for a moment I'd like to say I'd like to thank all of our visitors for being here and I know this is probably not a custom that you're used to kind of what we're doing here just now but the but the Lord spoke to me this week to do it just like this and so I I want all of you to to partake with it if you would and amen all of our visitors he said well but I'm a visitor we're a family that's right amen if I can just catch your thoughts just for a moment communion is a very special time that's right amen thank you it was a special time in Jesus's Ministry [Music] hisory it would take place just before his crucifixion I'm sure there was no disciple that was aware of the coming events none amen none not even Judas amen was aware of the coming events you heard brother Andrew preach tonight I thought it was so special am Jesus would would tell the disciples now I want you to find a man with a picture of water and I want you to follow him and when you follow him he's going to go to a place and he's going to have a room amen and he'll give us that room and there we'll have her supper Last Supper because it's a moment to where that from this point Jesus will go to the garden and then he'll be arrested then he'll go on trial he'll never be quite in this assembly again quite like this in this natural order of his Humanity this is a place where a traitor is going to give him up he would be so disgusted until all the other disciples would say is it I right even John the Beloved would lay his head Lord is that I I don't want to betray you I don't want to betray you and finally Judas is manifested Jesus didn't condemn him amen he said what thou doest do [Music] quickly now this isn't the last communion he would tell us to do this as a ordinance of God all the way through the book of Acts and all the way to this day I think it's interesting that brother Brandon would come and his ministry was so orchestrated never take it for granted that he's going to preach incredible sermons in the last couple of years of his life after the seals cuz no longer is he he probing but he would tell us that you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man he would preach sermons like future home things that are to be the token the Masterpiece Mighty God unveiled but as he would come he would speak leadership amen and in leadership it would be some of the most powerful thoughts that there would be then he would speak communion you can't orchestrate that and then his lips would be sealed on this side but it didn't stop the message Satan Satan didn't realize when he left God would raise up an army amen of believers all over the world that were not ashamed of this Supernatural message amen and it was more than just for a healing and it's more than just to make us a church no matter where we're at we're not here to build kingdoms we're here to prepare for the coming of the Lord we're here to walk in this building to feel his presence and in a moment become a better person maybe you walk in the first service and go I don't know much about this and maybe even after you leave the service I don't know if I ever go back again and then something inside of you goes I got to go back I don't know why but I got to go back and I got to go back and God ignites a thirst in your life a thirst in your life and maybe only in one sentence God tells you I'm with you and you know that no man knows that but God knows that now you see in the Millennium when we're all sitting in new bodies we're going to the marriage supper and we'll have communion again this is sacred to me to look at you and I know that some of you're going through some of the greatest strangs of your life some of the great greatest difficult moments but in just if we could put it in God's times in just in a few hours we'll s in a new body and all of life's journey over and everything will be fixed I like that he'll fix us in a moment and in a twinkle of an eye so no matter what your problems are as we take communion my mother was healed of a massive tumor in her breast and she just laid her hand on her breast while she was taking communion and God just took care of that thing and it dissolved I know of multitudes of Miracles that took place all communion was served I'd like to read this word of prayer that Jesus prayed in John chapter 17 he lifted up his eyes toward heaven and said father the hour is come I thought of these I thought of this very intently when God directed Ed me to read this at communion service because brother Tim spoke just if we could say in God's time just a few minutes ago on the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son may also glorify thee as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as has given him and this is life eternal that they might know the only true God Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work that thou gavest me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self and with the glory which I have had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou has given them me and they have kept Thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou Hast given me are of thee for I have given them The Words which thou gavest me and theyed them and they have surely that I came out of from thee and they believe that thou did send me I love these next words I pray for them I want you to say it right now Jesus prayed for me I pray not for the world but for them which thou gave us Hast given me for they are thine and all are mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them I'm glad that you can see Jesus in one another if you can look past the humanity and the false and the failures you see this is not our job today even as we come to communion to judge one another that's way higher than our pay grade that's right that's way higher than our pay grade but we're a team we're a body I'll just have to be honest with you I don't want to see my worst enemy go to [Music] hell can you Echo that thought where there's never another chance to come back that's right that's right father forgive them even when Jesus is being crucified he said some of the most incredible words father forgive them they know not what they do they know not what they do that's right brother Ron why am I fighting so hard to be a real Christian [Music] brother Andrew preached to you tonight about our [Music] borders this message is our borders that's right I don't want to go outside of it and I want to give you

help us as Christians stand strong like you've never stood strong before we're just before the coming of the Lord this ain't no time to give up or play games amen amen amen 1 Corinthians chap 11 and verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed bet trade took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my

type of the body of Jesus Christ it has no yeast in it and and it's a type of no sin when God cleanses our lives and we're washed there's no sin recognized in our life can you imagine we have an accuser that has all kind of information but the blood of Jesus Christ amen said there's nothing can be held against them thank you Lord I ought to make us all shout right there yes this is wine it is

in love with him for the greatness from day to day today today and we come together with these things in mind realizing that we're taking his life not the literal life it's a type of the life of Jesus Christ and we do this as an ordinance to God and every one of us have sinned and come short of the glory of God none of us can point our fingers at one another and we can only look to the cross of Jesus Christ and and say father forgive me I'm not talking about bank robbers and killing somebody I'm talking about just our attitude sometimes our thoughts sound Lou louder in heaven than our words
