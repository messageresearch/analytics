[31:54] evening but we want him to have liberty
[31:56] and and just be able to just move as he
[31:58] sees fit and not just him the lord amen
[32:01] that's what we want we could have a huge
[32:03] gathering but if the lord don't come it
[32:05] means nothing amen so just be mindful of
[32:08] the meeting and
[32:10] parking and then if
[32:12] if you could just make sure you take any
[32:13] of the the bags and stuff with you that
[32:16] you would usually have at your seats
[32:18] because you may not have the seat that
[32:19] you usually have
[32:20] come this weekend so just be mindful of
[32:23] that and we're gonna
[32:24] try to fit as many people in here as we
[32:26] can because there's many people that's
[32:28] going to be driving a long way and we
[32:30] want to be able to feel welcome in the
[32:32] building
[32:33] amen so just try not to take up seats as
[32:36] much as you can and just squish together
[32:38] as we can
[32:40] and we might have to do the stand up
[32:42] move in sit down stand up move in sit
[32:45] down okay
[32:46] and uh i'm sure there's some people
[32:48] that'll be standing on their feet the
[32:50] whole time but the ministers will be too
[32:53] so so we can do that amen amen and if
[32:56] there's anything as far as that needs to
[32:58] be taken care of during the services if
[33:01] you would just let brother alden or one
[33:03] of the deacons know and uh that we can
[33:06] handle that situation
[33:07] there whatever it may be so
[33:10] god bless you you can be seated at this
[33:12] time well that's brother fred perry if

[50:27] god once said
[50:29] from brother timothy pruitt that just
[50:30] spoke with brother
[50:32] brother andrew
[50:35] and i'm having timothy for more than
[50:38] just a reason of having tim
[50:40] but timothy is a convention speaker on
[50:43] his own
[50:45] you know his daddy didn't call him and i
[50:47] couldn't call these boys but
[50:50] god called him
[50:52] timothy has a kind of ministry that it
[50:54] seems like it's awful quiet there for a
[50:56] little bit and then all of a sudden the
[50:58] building blows up
[51:00] that's why i like it so much
[51:03] you know he'll be on a wednesday night
[51:05] to be on on a thought
[51:07] and he'll be preaching along and then
[51:09] all of a sudden the building blows up
[51:11] and you go wow i didn't see it that way
[51:13] ever before
[51:14] amen and so we're looking forward to
[51:16] having him he'll be speaking on friday

[58:10] in jesus name we pray amen and amen amen
[58:15] amen amen if you'll turn with me in your
[58:17] bible this morning
[58:20] to luke chapter 12 and verse 27
[58:24] last night was a masterpiece
[58:27] i had i had some ministry call me and
[58:29] tell me after the service of what a
[58:31] masterpiece that was
[58:33] and uh and it was a masterpiece
[58:37] amen
[58:38] amen i want you to remember brother mike
[58:40] walls as they're going through some
[58:42] situations there with the sister that
[58:44] has
[58:45] that had a uh when she was i think she
[58:47] was having her baby she had a
[58:51] heart attack
[58:52] and then had a stroke
[58:54] and then
[58:55] she had been telling them her head had
[58:57] been hurting for months
[58:59] and they found out that she had a
[59:02] a pretty massive tumor there that
[59:04] they're dealing with and last night
[59:06] things turned really bad so
[59:08] so if you could remember brother mike
[59:10] the family the people god's able to do
[59:13] anything and so we just want to remember
[59:15] them in prayer today luke chapter 12 and
[59:18] verse 27
[59:20] jesus is speaking here
[59:22] consider the lilies
[59:24] how they grow
[59:27] they told not
[59:29] they spin not
[59:31] and yet i say unto you that solomon
[59:34] in all his glory
[59:38] was not arrayed
[59:40] like one of these
[59:43] jesus is saying my creation is greater
[59:46] than any man's work
[59:50] that's pretty powerful in there
[59:53] if then god so clothed the grass
[59:57] which is today in the field
[1:00:00] and tomorrow is cast into the ox oven
[1:00:04] how much more
[1:00:07] will he clothe you
[1:00:09] o ye
[1:00:10] of little faith
[1:00:12] and seek not you what ye shall eat or
[1:00:16] what you shall drink
[1:00:17] neither be you
[1:00:19] doubtful of mine
[1:00:21] for
[1:00:22] all these things do the nations of the
[1:00:26] world seek after
[1:00:28] and your father knoweth that ye have
[1:00:31] need
[1:00:32] of these things
[1:00:34] think about that the economies of the
[1:00:37] world
[1:00:39] are seeking after something much
[1:00:40] different than you are
[1:00:42] but your god knows how to feed you
[1:00:47] but rather seek ye the kingdom of god
[1:00:50] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:00:52] you
[1:00:53] fear not little flock
[1:00:55] for it is the father's good pleasure to
[1:00:58] give you
[1:00:59] the kingdom
[1:01:01] and then he then is this is how the
[1:01:03] early church started
[1:01:05] sell what you have and give alms
[1:01:08] provide yourselves bags
[1:01:10] which wax not old a treasure in the
[1:01:13] heavens that failth not
[1:01:16] where no thief approacheth neither moth
[1:01:20] corrupteth
[1:01:21] for where your treasure is
[1:01:24] there will your heart
[1:01:26] be also
[1:01:28] amen wow what a powerful scripture you
[1:01:30] can be seated
[1:01:34] isaiah writes it like this
[1:01:37] much on the same thing
[1:01:40] ho
[1:01:41] everyone that thirst come you to the
[1:01:43] waters and
[1:01:45] he that hath no money come he
[1:01:48] buy and eat
[1:01:49] yea come by wine milk without money
[1:01:54] without price
[1:01:57] wherefore do you spend money for that
[1:01:59] which is not bread
[1:02:01] and your labor for that which satisfieth
[1:02:04] not
[1:02:06] hearken diligently unto me and eat you
[1:02:10] that which is good and let your soul
[1:02:12] delight itself in fatness
[1:02:15] incline your ear and come unto me here
[1:02:18] and your soul shall live and i will make
[1:02:21] an everlasting covenant with you
[1:02:24] even the sure mercies of david
[1:02:27] behold i have given him a for a witness
[1:02:30] to the people of the leader of a
[1:02:32] commander
[1:02:33] of the people behold thou shalt call
[1:02:36] a nation and know us not
[1:02:39] and nations that knew not thee shall run
[1:02:43] unto thee because of the lord thy god
[1:02:46] and the holy one of israel he hath
[1:02:49] glorified thee
[1:02:52] seek ye
[1:02:53] the lord while he may be found
[1:02:56] call ye upon him
[1:02:58] while he is near
[1:03:00] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[1:03:03] righteous man his thoughts and let him
[1:03:05] return unto the lord and he will have
[1:03:08] mercy upon him and to our god for he
[1:03:11] will abundantly pardon i love these next
[1:03:14] scriptures for my thoughts are not your
[1:03:18] thoughts
[1:03:20] neither your ways
[1:03:23] my ways
[1:03:24] saith the lord
[1:03:26] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:03:28] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:03:32] ways
[1:03:33] and my thoughts
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:36] than your thoughts
[1:03:39] oh what a powerful for as the rain
[1:03:42] cometh down in the snow from heaven and
[1:03:44] return turneth not hither but water the
[1:03:47] earth and maketh it bring forth and bud
[1:03:50] that it might give seed to the sower and
[1:03:53] bread to the eater
[1:03:55] so shall my word
[1:03:57] be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[1:04:01] shall not return unto me void
[1:04:05] but it
[1:04:06] shall accomplish
[1:04:09] that which i please and it shall prosper
[1:04:13] in the thing whereunto
[1:04:16] i sent
[1:04:17] i want to read that last portion of
[1:04:19] scripture
[1:04:21] but it shall accomplish
[1:04:24] that which i please
[1:04:26] and it shall prosper in the thing which
[1:04:30] whereunto i sent
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:34] i'd like to speak to you i've been
[1:04:36] speaking to you on the
[1:04:38] orchestra and
[1:04:40] and sharing with you some things from
[1:04:43] beethoven from from how that god
[1:04:45] orchestrates his word places people at a
[1:04:48] certain place at a certain season at a
[1:04:51] certain time to play a certain
[1:04:53] instrument
[1:04:55] and we value our moments in time and we
[1:04:58] catch our moment
[1:04:59] and i'd like to speak to you on the
[1:05:01] value
[1:05:02] of this masterpiece
[1:05:08] so
[1:05:10] i i felt led to go and look at
[1:05:14] what the world
[1:05:18] considers
[1:05:20] the most priceless
[1:05:22] things of value
[1:05:24] that there are
[1:05:26] on the earth
[1:05:30] three of the top 15
[1:05:32] are in the the
[1:05:34] the pyramids
[1:05:36] that was on the scene when enoch was
[1:05:39] there
[1:05:40] what he not built
[1:05:43] michelangelo built two statues that have
[1:05:46] great value to them one of them is david
[1:05:49] it is considered the greatest most
[1:05:52] valuable sculpture that there is in the
[1:05:55] world
[1:05:56] and they actually built one of the most
[1:05:59] biggest buildings around it to protect
[1:06:02] it but it's called the most perfect
[1:06:05] statue
[1:06:06] of david that there was the other one we
[1:06:09] know much about is moses to which when
[1:06:12] he finished up with that
[1:06:14] it was so alive to him that he struck it
[1:06:18] and said for it to speak
[1:06:21] michelangelo would be one that would
[1:06:23] paint
[1:06:24] and he would paint many different
[1:06:26] paintings and one of them would be
[1:06:28] under house arrest would paint the
[1:06:31] sistine chapel
[1:06:33] others would be the
[1:06:35] the taj mahal
[1:06:37] and that's actually rated as number one
[1:06:39] the taj mahal it is a it's a crown
[1:06:42] palace
[1:06:43] on the earth
[1:06:45] it's an indian city to which it's the
[1:06:47] most celebrated romantic symbols of
[1:06:49] power huma of human emotion ever built
[1:06:53] it is beyond price of value that it
[1:06:56] could be
[1:06:58] the great wall of china
[1:07:01] it is a wall that
[1:07:03] it is a wall that not america would
[1:07:05] build i've actually
[1:07:06] saw this wall but it's a wall to which
[1:07:09] that that china would build and and it
[1:07:12] would build and run through its country
[1:07:15] to which that it would
[1:07:17] no way that you could value this
[1:07:19] structure
[1:07:21] the pyramids that would be there the
[1:07:23] jewels that would be there
[1:07:25] the heads that would be there
[1:07:28] all of this
[1:07:30] is man-made
[1:07:34] all of this is man-made you couldn't buy
[1:07:37] it no government could buy it no
[1:07:40] government can own it
[1:07:42] all of it it pales in comparison
[1:07:46] of our creator
[1:07:50] that speaks a son into existence
[1:07:54] a zodiac into existence
[1:07:57] down to a little lily on a gr on a
[1:08:00] ground in a pond
[1:08:04] from a deep seed inside of a pond
[1:08:06] underneath of the mud it begins to maybe
[1:08:10] put forth a stem 40 foot long but at the
[1:08:13] top of it it shows forth a tabernacle of
[1:08:16] praise unto god
[1:08:18] and god compares that greater than all
[1:08:22] of solomon's temple
[1:08:25] and if we can think about solomon's
[1:08:27] temple for just a moment artisans and
[1:08:30] skilled workers came from all over the
[1:08:33] world and brought some of the most
[1:08:35] priceless pieces of wood and of rock
[1:08:40] and of emerald and stone to be able to
[1:08:42] place inside of solomon's temple
[1:08:46] it was a time to where that goal was in
[1:08:49] abundance
[1:08:51] and it would be placed in this temple
[1:08:54] but jesus would stand
[1:08:58] the master of all masters would stand
[1:09:01] and say destroy this temple
[1:09:04] and he was not talking about solomon's
[1:09:06] temple
[1:09:07] but he was talking about his own body
[1:09:11] and in three days i'll raise it up again
[1:09:17] there's no way that we could put value
[1:09:21] on the blood of the lamb
[1:09:24] there's no way that we could put value
[1:09:27] on jesus christ
[1:09:33] our society wants to dirty his name
[1:09:37] wants to blaspheme his name
[1:09:40] wants to make fun of his name
[1:09:43] but let me just say this to you without
[1:09:45] jesus christ
[1:09:47] we're all lost
[1:09:51] if god hadn't come to earth
[1:09:54] and now listen even in the book of
[1:09:56] revelations in chapter 5 there is john
[1:09:59] standing
[1:10:01] sure as many symbols formed but john's
[1:10:03] standing and he sees that humanity's
[1:10:06] lost
[1:10:08] the book is in the hands of the father
[1:10:10] and we're all lost
[1:10:12] there's no man in heaven
[1:10:14] as great as have they all lived and
[1:10:17] there's no man in the earth
[1:10:19] that is worthy to take the book
[1:10:22] and john began to weak because we're all
[1:10:25] lost
[1:10:26] but there was a voice
[1:10:31] he stepped forth to take the book
[1:10:34] to redeem me and you
[1:10:37] he was greater than a prophet he was
[1:10:39] greater than a king
[1:10:41] he was greater than all humanity
[1:10:44] he is the king of kings he is the lord
[1:10:48] of lords he is the mighty god
[1:10:52] living in human flesh
[1:10:57] [Applause]
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:07] if you would ask me today
[1:11:10] who would you want in your house
[1:11:13] to come to your house
[1:11:15] as the greatest
[1:11:17] greatest
[1:11:18] guest of all time
[1:11:21] i don't have to ponder for three seconds
[1:11:27] i don't have to ponder for three seconds
[1:11:29] and wonder hollywood or kings or
[1:11:32] potentiates
[1:11:34] or great basketball stars or football
[1:11:36] stars my answer is immediately jesus
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:43] but i want to tell you it's more than a
[1:11:44] dream and it's more than a vision it's
[1:11:46] more than a thought it's more than a
[1:11:48] poem it's more than a song
[1:11:52] he's already there
[1:11:54] if you're a believer and the holy ghost
[1:11:57] is in your life
[1:11:58] the master of all masters
[1:12:03] that priceless one is in your life
[1:12:14] brother brown said oh
[1:12:17] the hour has come
[1:12:20] and and when god's great drama is set
[1:12:22] here before us
[1:12:24] the son of god
[1:12:26] that was in a cradle
[1:12:28] is in the heart now
[1:12:31] he is the deity of god
[1:12:34] he is god the creator
[1:12:36] all things he was in the world and the
[1:12:40] world was made by him
[1:12:44] and the world
[1:12:45] knew him not
[1:12:48] today that's what's the matter with the
[1:12:50] church the hope of glory the baptism of
[1:12:53] the holy ghost has come into people's
[1:12:56] heart and they don't even recognize what
[1:12:58] it is
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:00] they think it's a little church joiner
[1:13:02] or something like that but it's the god
[1:13:05] the creator of heaven
[1:13:08] living in you
[1:13:12] and giving you all the powers
[1:13:15] you're in the possession of anything
[1:13:17] that he had and so it is in you to
[1:13:21] abstain from evil to do good to shun
[1:13:24] evil to flee to righteousness to turn
[1:13:27] away from temptation
[1:13:30] oh malice
[1:13:31] hatred strife
[1:13:33] envy and so forth turn away from it
[1:13:37] for that'll take from that'll take him
[1:13:40] from your heart if you receive him
[1:13:43] embrace him
[1:13:45] love him
[1:13:47] hold him in your heart
[1:13:49] love him
[1:13:54] singing some powerful things to you
[1:13:58] and i can tell you the church together
[1:14:00] and that kind of a power has the power
[1:14:02] to bind heavens and heal sick
[1:14:05] open the eyes of the blood
[1:14:08] if that god lives in your heart it has
[1:14:10] the power
[1:14:11] to heal the sick
[1:14:14] to raise the dead
[1:14:16] to open the eyes of the blind the deaf
[1:14:19] ears and the dumb speak
[1:14:22] the cripples walk the blind to see
[1:14:25] it's recognizing the power of almighty
[1:14:28] god
[1:14:29] in your heart
[1:14:36] now
[1:14:38] every masterpiece has a signature that
[1:14:40] goes with it
[1:14:44] if it doesn't have a signature
[1:14:46] it can't be authenticated
[1:14:49] i know something about some of these
[1:14:50] things
[1:14:51] if it doesn't have a signature or maybe
[1:14:54] even a number on it
[1:14:57] it's just a
[1:14:58] a duplicate
[1:15:00] or a bonus a bogus copy
[1:15:04] or an imitation of the original
[1:15:08] that has
[1:15:09] no no value whatsoever
[1:15:12] why would why do we value
[1:15:15] going to church
[1:15:19] why don't we value going to church and
[1:15:21] signing your name on a book
[1:15:24] living the same life on monday
[1:15:30] the same life that we used to live
[1:15:33] the same life when you were a drunkard
[1:15:35] and you're still drinking and you're
[1:15:37] still whining and you're still chasing
[1:15:38] well are you with me now
[1:15:41] listen if there's not a change in your
[1:15:43] heart it has no value to it
[1:15:49] why would we accept a cheap invitation
[1:15:53] when the real is available
[1:16:01] now
[1:16:04] god's signature on a masterpiece
[1:16:07] of your life
[1:16:09] cannot be duplicated
[1:16:12] you're a one of a kind
[1:16:15] and then you're approved by his
[1:16:17] signature
[1:16:19] god has already signed the canvas of
[1:16:22] your life
[1:16:23] and declared you as a masterpiece
[1:16:27] he sees the finished work already in the
[1:16:30] light of jesus as he has done for you on
[1:16:34] the cross
[1:16:35] the signature
[1:16:37] is the paid price
[1:16:42] when you receive the holy ghost
[1:16:46] it is god's seal on you
[1:16:50] and there's nothing in the hell can take
[1:16:53] that seal away from
[1:17:00] you brother branham teaches us that the
[1:17:04] seal
[1:17:05] is god's sign of ownership
[1:17:12] the largest
[1:17:15] acreage owner in america is bill gates
[1:17:20] and his agenda right now
[1:17:23] is to take
[1:17:24] and not produce food
[1:17:28] there's a reason for it
[1:17:31] he is trying to bring down the
[1:17:33] population of the world he's one of
[1:17:36] those believers
[1:17:40] well that don't bother me none
[1:17:42] whatsoever you can own the all the land
[1:17:45] in america my god owns the whole earth
[1:18:02] and my god can do more in an acre than
[1:18:04] you can do in a 100 acre field
[1:18:08] [Applause]
[1:18:13] [Music]

[1:18:32] faithful to pay her tithes she don't get
[1:18:35] the benefit of being in church she don't

[1:18:39] faithful to pay her ties and let me just
[1:18:41] say yes to you god has blessed her home

[1:18:48] that old house was run down and it was
[1:18:50] dingy and it was dark and got
[1:18:56] god gave her a masterpiece of the house
[1:19:00] let me just say this message works
[1:19:03] [Applause]
[1:19:17] artists sign up
[1:19:19] the copy of their their work
[1:19:23] they assign it to which that
[1:19:26] it will become worth more
[1:19:30] sister anna when our storm began
[1:19:34] begin to look for a something that i had
[1:19:37] been looking for for
[1:19:39] for actually several years jesus walking
[1:19:42] through the storm
[1:19:44] i had not shared that
[1:19:47] there are
[1:19:48] they're kind of inexpensive pieces and i
[1:19:51] had not shared that i wanted such a
[1:19:53] thing but
[1:19:54] not told anybody but i did some looking
[1:20:00] and so
[1:20:02] and so anyway sister anna just came on
[1:20:05] her heart
[1:20:07] well you know to call this certain place
[1:20:11] of jesus
[1:20:13] walking on the storm
[1:20:15] it's actually by abraham hunter
[1:20:18] and she called the place i'm gonna tell
[1:20:19] it the best that my memory says so if
[1:20:22] it's just a little gibberish if you'll
[1:20:24] just give me a little leeway
[1:20:26] she called and of course they didn't
[1:20:28] have any
[1:20:29] they tried to find it they didn't have
[1:20:31] any they tried to find it finally she
[1:20:32] got a hold of a guy that worked in a
[1:20:34] warehouse
[1:20:37] and and they had two
[1:20:41] and
[1:20:42] and
[1:20:43] one day at christmas there
[1:20:45] the christmas season i just been given
[1:20:48] given the news that i had been given and
[1:20:50] here she walks up i hadn't been given
[1:20:52] the news yet
[1:20:54] and here her and brother jeff walk up to
[1:20:57] the house knock on the door and they
[1:20:59] said we've got a gift for you you don't
[1:21:01] know what it meant
[1:21:03] for me to get that print
[1:21:06] of jesus walking on the water
[1:21:09] they didn't know
[1:21:10] but i knew
[1:21:13] are you with me now
[1:21:16] something that is signed is of great
[1:21:18] value
[1:21:26] we didn't know
[1:21:28] what we was getting ready to go through
[1:21:36] i want to
[1:21:42] just take a few moments here
[1:21:45] but god puts trust in his seat
[1:21:50] if his seed is a signature edition
[1:21:53] and it's playing an integral part
[1:21:57] in god's orchestra
[1:22:01] and in that orchestra there's going to
[1:22:03] be a lot of storms
[1:22:06] in the life
[1:22:08] storms to which
[1:22:10] that particular
[1:22:12] voice has to have a certain sound
[1:22:17] god knows that he's got to send it
[1:22:19] through certain
[1:22:22] devastations
[1:22:24] to make it sound a certain way
[1:22:29] but remember the seed
[1:22:31] is an incorruptible seed
[1:22:34] it cannot even be destroyed by an atomic
[1:22:37] bomb
[1:22:41] are you with me it it's going to take a
[1:22:44] stronger wind than cancer
[1:22:47] it's going to take a stronger wind than
[1:22:50] relationship issues
[1:22:52] it's going to take a stronger wind than
[1:22:55] the parties of the united states of
[1:22:57] america
[1:23:01] or the struggles of your life the seed
[1:23:04] that god put on the inside of you before
[1:23:07] the foundation of the world it was a
[1:23:10] wedding band
[1:23:11] of unmerited grace that he slipped on
[1:23:15] your finger
[1:23:16] before the foundation of the world he
[1:23:20] would not leave it up to frail humanity
[1:23:29] it's not about whether you feel it or
[1:23:31] don't feel it
[1:23:33] it's not about whether you think i'm
[1:23:35] going to make it or don't think i'm
[1:23:36] going to make it he's got a covenant
[1:23:46] he's got a covenant
[1:23:48] and he didn't swear by man he swerved by
[1:23:52] himself
[1:23:53] the eternal one swore by the eternal one
[1:23:58] without beginning or without ending
[1:24:01] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[1:24:04] end the first and the last
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:09] it's not even up to your frail humanity
[1:24:12] it's up to god
[1:24:14] [Applause]
[1:24:34] i'll make a powerful statement here
[1:24:36] because our prophet did he said you're
[1:24:38] the literal spoken word seed of god
[1:24:53] what's your name melissa
[1:24:55] melissa
[1:25:14] sister alyssa went to ohio this week
[1:25:17] how many chur how many years have you
[1:25:19] said in church
[1:25:22] how old are you
[1:25:24] 22.
[1:25:26] 22.
[1:25:29] you believed this
[1:25:33] you never doubted it
[1:25:36] but you hadn't met him
[1:25:39] that correct
[1:25:42] but you went through a prayer line
[1:25:45] in ohio
[1:25:49] and after that
[1:25:52] it wasn't andrew
[1:25:54] and it wasn't the other ministry
[1:25:57] but there was a presence in that prayer
[1:25:59] line
[1:26:02] and it was him
[1:26:05] now i want to tell you something that
[1:26:07] him will never leave you
[1:26:15] you can't put a value
[1:26:17] on being in that meeting
[1:26:27] you can't put a value on that
[1:26:30] oh i was just in a meeting
[1:26:33] no no no
[1:26:34] that's generational
[1:26:38] that's something her father and her
[1:26:39] mother could not do for her
[1:26:43] keep you in the right atmosphere
[1:26:47] but when you meet him
[1:26:51] you meet the one that wrote the book
[1:26:54] i don't mean it to be just so simple
[1:26:56] but he wrote the book
[1:26:59] he wrote the book
[1:27:02] and when you meet the guy that writes
[1:27:03] the book
[1:27:06] the voice behind the voice with moses
[1:27:08] that wrote the book
[1:27:11] what do i write about adam i'll tell you
[1:27:13] just write just put it on your name on
[1:27:15] just just just keep writing i'm going to
[1:27:18] tell you how to write about moses i'm
[1:27:20] going to tell you how to write about all
[1:27:21] of these characters i'm going to tell
[1:27:23] you about abraham i'm the one that sat
[1:27:25] with abraham
[1:27:27] [Applause]
[1:27:29] are you with me
[1:27:31] this is my masterpiece
[1:27:34] this is god's book
[1:27:37] this is his orchestra there's been a lot
[1:27:40] of players
[1:27:43] but now you realize you're in the book
[1:28:04] how valuable brother doug
[1:28:06] was the service you set in
[1:28:09] when your life just went
[1:28:12] and it was premature
[1:28:17] and we came to your place where you were
[1:28:19] setting
[1:28:20] and you set lifeless
[1:28:23] and we just called you by name
[1:28:26] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:28] and you came back
[1:28:31] augusta county and rockingham
[1:28:34] all of the banking accounts combined
[1:28:38] couldn't put a value
[1:28:40] on you being in that service
[1:28:49] i will tell you this if you that's been
[1:28:51] around brother doug
[1:28:53] brother doug was one man
[1:28:55] before that service
[1:28:57] but when he came back
[1:29:00] he was a complete different man
[1:29:06] he was a good man
[1:29:09] but when god breathes life
[1:29:11] i'll tell you what it feels like ten
[1:29:13] thousand volts are right here
[1:29:17] when god breathes life
[1:29:24] it looked like a shanty
[1:29:26] on a river
[1:29:28] but god sent
[1:29:30] our prophet
[1:29:34] down to a little house
[1:29:37] probably couldn't afford the light meal
[1:29:40] but god sent a prophet because she
[1:29:43] prayed
[1:29:45] where's my elijah at
[1:29:48] i'd be like that pseudomike woman
[1:29:51] where's my
[1:29:52] elijah
[1:29:58] and he walked past her
[1:30:01] he said
[1:30:02] good morning amy
[1:30:06] and he's she said
[1:30:08] good morning parsley
[1:30:10] and he noticed the dew on her back
[1:30:13] she'd been there for a while
[1:30:18] brother branham says these words and
[1:30:20] this is where this fits
[1:30:22] brother brandon said i walked into her
[1:30:23] little house
[1:30:26] and i looked at the pictures of jesus on
[1:30:28] the wall
[1:30:30] and he said the presence in that house
[1:30:33] he said i've been in four castles
[1:30:36] those that want to contest brother
[1:30:38] branham
[1:30:39] about being and praying for king george
[1:30:42] brother brown was in four different
[1:30:44] castles
[1:30:46] and he said i felt more comfortable in
[1:30:48] her little house
[1:30:50] than on all them big castles
[1:30:56] hallelujah
[1:30:59] hallelujah and brother branham didn't
[1:31:01] say i am a i'm an evangelist do you know
[1:31:04] me no
[1:31:06] he said annie won't you pray
[1:31:09] her prayer
[1:31:11] created a storm and grounded a plane
[1:31:17] and he recognized that presence
[1:31:19] because he had been in it
[1:31:21] up on a mountainside
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:25] overcoming a complex in his own life
[1:31:29] and he spoke a storm out of existence
[1:31:32] and he knew that god spoke that storm
[1:31:35] through his lips and this woman used the
[1:31:39] same power that he spoke
[1:31:50] i want to tell you this
[1:31:51] this power that you heard about last
[1:31:54] night is in your lips
[1:31:56] it's in your heart
[1:31:58] it's in your life
[1:32:06] [Applause]
[1:32:13] you prayed you got under desperation
[1:32:16] that your son would be here
[1:32:18] on that certain day
[1:32:24] and when i called his name you didn't
[1:32:25] even know he was in the building but you
[1:32:28] prayed
[1:32:29] because the author
[1:32:32] of this bible
[1:32:34] the orchestrator of this bible
[1:32:36] understands redemption
[1:32:38] [Applause]
[1:32:40] and understands prodigal children
[1:32:42] and understands a covenant of seeds
[1:32:48] and so when he went to the jailhouse the
[1:32:50] other day we're not ashamed of that god
[1:32:53] knows how to go get his kids
[1:32:55] [Applause]
[1:32:57] when he went to the jailhouse the other
[1:32:59] day commissioned by the word of the lord
[1:33:02] to go deal with his heart
[1:33:11] do you understand eternal life
[1:33:14] at all
[1:33:20] if you gain this whole world
[1:33:24] and lose your soul
[1:33:33] jobs
[1:33:35] homes
[1:33:40] i'm riding the fence
[1:33:42] why are you rotting a fence
[1:33:44] you'll stay on that fence on rapture
[1:33:46] morning
[1:33:47] you may have to give your life to a
[1:33:49] tribulation period what
[1:33:53] what's here
[1:33:58] what's here worth staying for
[1:34:01] tell me a meal in harrisonburg we're
[1:34:03] staying here for
[1:34:07] tell me a house
[1:34:11] a house in this whole valley
[1:34:16] i don't care the biggest house
[1:34:19] even in charlottesville that's supposed
[1:34:22] to be the mecca of big houses you tell
[1:34:24] me the biggest house there
[1:34:26] that's not worth staying here for
[1:34:37] thank you
[1:34:48] brother brother branham explained
[1:34:50] something
[1:34:51] and he said what is value
[1:34:55] what is value
[1:35:02] he was an honest man
[1:35:05] and he looked at he looked at things
[1:35:06] kind of like
[1:35:08] well jesus would look at things
[1:35:14] because brother branham had been offered
[1:35:18] millions of dollars
[1:35:20] to preach in other circles
[1:35:24] and turn that down
[1:35:26] he knew what it was to be poor
[1:35:31] he knew what it was to take up an offer
[1:35:34] and there would just be a couple of
[1:35:36] pieces of change in the bottom of it and
[1:35:39] he wanted to go give it back
[1:35:47] he knew what that was like
[1:35:49] he knew what that little building at 8th
[1:35:51] and penn street
[1:35:53] here the greatest ministry of this day
[1:35:58] i'm not ashamed to say that
[1:36:00] what's in a small building
[1:36:03] smaller than this building
[1:36:05] we're concerned about our we're
[1:36:07] concerned about sometimes about the size
[1:36:10] of a crowd that will be here next week
[1:36:12] brother branham had those kind of crowds
[1:36:14] because it was brown of meetings
[1:36:16] people traveled 20 hours 36 hours to the
[1:36:20] meeting brother branham's in town and
[1:36:22] they started traveling wednesday to be
[1:36:24] there friday and brother branham was
[1:36:26] going to be speaking and and hey listen
[1:36:28] they got there in the morning knowing it
[1:36:29] was going to be a night service they
[1:36:31] stood outside they had sandwiches they
[1:36:33] stood outside and eat
[1:36:37] hey listen listen brother tim sent me a
[1:36:40] a picture
[1:36:42] a picture of him sitting on the platform
[1:36:46] and he's about 18 years old he's a young
[1:36:48] preacher he'd been in another meeting
[1:36:50] where preachers sat on the platform on
[1:36:52] this meeting they had seats up there he
[1:36:54] just walked up there thought that was a
[1:36:56] place for him to see not another
[1:36:58] preacher on the platform but him
[1:37:05] there was no seats out in the audience
[1:37:07] so my dad
[1:37:09] got doc to get us a seat in the
[1:37:13] baptistry
[1:37:15] so behind the curtain there i said about
[1:37:18] 11 year old boy
[1:37:20] and my buddy was sitting out on the
[1:37:22] pulpit
[1:37:24] as an 18 year old preacher who to thunk
[1:37:27] it
[1:37:35] i'm not ashamed to say it probably two
[1:37:37] of the most powerful preachers in the
[1:37:39] building
[1:37:42] we're sitting just feet apart
[1:37:50] are you with me now
[1:37:52] god knows how to arrange things
[1:38:01] well that was a bold statement brother
[1:38:03] ron you must think of yourself that's
[1:38:04] not what i think of myself it's what god
[1:38:07] thinks
[1:38:08] and i got a quote for you you're a
[1:38:10] special class of people
[1:38:15] it's not white black yellow whatever
[1:38:19] we're a special class of people we got
[1:38:22] an ear to hear we got a trained ear to
[1:38:25] hear the voice of god
[1:38:42] maybe i'm finished here
[1:38:44] seemed to be a bit wary this morning
[1:38:51] i went longer than i thought i would
[1:38:54] i've been real sick this morning took a
[1:38:56] took a pretty good fall but it didn't
[1:38:58] hit my head
[1:39:08] it was a woman that
[1:39:11] to most people
[1:39:12] had no value
[1:39:21] well you said something last night i
[1:39:23] thought was so profound
[1:39:25] from timothy we were re-quoting it
[1:39:27] how the devil tries to make our sisters
[1:39:30] think they're ugly
[1:39:36] tries to make you feel like you're ugly
[1:39:40] he wants to paint you and he wants to
[1:39:41] put all kind of stuff on you
[1:39:43] he wants to put all kind of deals on you
[1:39:46] when you're beautiful in god's sight
[1:39:51] who are we patterning after in any way
[1:39:55] you know who are we trying to impress
[1:39:57] if you can impress your husband and
[1:39:59] press your husband
[1:40:04] you're a man's
[1:40:06] should have been way
[1:40:10] way
[1:40:12] way better than that
[1:40:15] well brother ron i got humps and i got
[1:40:17] bumps and
[1:40:23] if he married you
[1:40:26] for that
[1:40:28] he had the wrong reason to start off
[1:40:30] with
[1:40:32] you marry a woman for her character
[1:40:35] that will reflect
[1:40:37] the character that's inside of you
[1:40:41] that's what god's looking for
[1:40:47] and there was a woman that
[1:40:49] was probably to the world
[1:40:52] extremely cheap
[1:40:55] but men would go to her
[1:40:58] because of their lustful desires
[1:41:02] and they would pour out upon her
[1:41:04] their lustful desires and she would
[1:41:06] receive their seed
[1:41:09] and then they would just throw money
[1:41:10] down
[1:41:11] to her
[1:41:13] and she was in chains of circumstances
[1:41:15] she couldn't raise herself from that
[1:41:16] level
[1:41:21] and there was no hope of ever raising
[1:41:23] herself
[1:41:24] and she was thinking as a if age
[1:41:26] progresses
[1:41:28] this is the way i'm always going to be
[1:41:35] this one would leave good money this one
[1:41:37] would leave a little bit of money
[1:41:39] that this one would be a nice looking
[1:41:41] man that one would be nasty
[1:41:45] sin has a horrible way
[1:41:47] of destroying people's lives
[1:41:51] sin has no value to it
[1:41:54] i'm going two ways here
[1:41:56] it has no value but destroys and kills
[1:41:59] and steals
[1:42:00] and destroys your brain cells and
[1:42:02] destroys your body
[1:42:09] you've heard of children young
[1:42:11] 16 18 year old girls being murdered
[1:42:15] because they went to a party
[1:42:17] and and they didn't come home i i say
[1:42:20] worse to parents
[1:42:24] where's the parents that says no
[1:42:28] no don't do that
[1:42:30] don't do there's going to be somebody
[1:42:32] there
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:48] she hears about jesus is out of place
[1:42:53] and the footworks flunkies don't even
[1:42:55] want to fool with him
[1:42:58] i'd like to been a flunky
[1:43:01] i'll be really honest with you
[1:43:04] i'd have been watching for if i knew
[1:43:05] that he was coming
[1:43:07] i'd have been watching for him coming
[1:43:09] over the hill
[1:43:11] he wouldn't have got by me
[1:43:14] but it had to be this way because god
[1:43:16] couldn't have me there
[1:43:18] he had me here
[1:43:21] knowing that's in my heart
[1:43:23] because every time this service if this
[1:43:25] service is this important and that
[1:43:27] service is that important and next week
[1:43:30] is that important
[1:43:32] how can we put value on it
[1:43:36] don't never let a service go by and go
[1:43:38] well that was a good service we went a
[1:43:40] little bit too long
[1:43:43] you can't put value on this service
[1:43:47] you cannot put a value in this service
[1:43:50] god is telling you how valuable you are
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:44:00] sarah he's telling you
[1:44:03] in this service how valuable
[1:44:08] worth more than the taj mahal
[1:44:21] faith
[1:44:22] if me and you were standing at the taj
[1:44:24] mahal this morning this morning and we
[1:44:26] were standing there you'd probably say
[1:44:27] something quirky
[1:44:33] but i'd look over at you and i'd say
[1:44:34] faith
[1:44:36] can you imagine in god's eyes
[1:44:38] you're worth more than all this right
[1:44:46] here would be so humbling
[1:44:50] you'd feel like dancing
[1:44:52] you feel like shouting
[1:44:56] that's how this little lady felt at the
[1:44:58] feet of jesus
[1:45:00] when he said thy sins
[1:45:03] though that many
[1:45:05] are forgiven
[1:45:13] and she entered into the book
[1:45:20] one day i'll shake her hand
[1:45:25] one day i'll shake her hand
[1:45:27] i don't know
[1:45:29] we don't really have a good name for her
[1:45:31] but she's the woman that washed jesus's
[1:45:33] feet
[1:45:35] and she got eternal life
[1:46:25] i don't know where i'll stand there
[1:46:31] what i'll be known for
[1:46:36] somewhere i'll be connected to a thing
[1:46:38] called cancer
[1:46:40] and it didn't defeat me
[1:46:44] i preached when it made me sick
[1:46:47] i preached when my body said no
[1:46:51] i preached
[1:46:53] when others thought i wasn't going to
[1:46:54] make it
[1:46:56] but i keep standing
[1:47:03] i just want to make it
[1:47:07] i just want to play my part i'm sorry
[1:47:10] i'm sorry let's stand
[1:47:21] good preachers will come thursday and
[1:47:23] friday or friday and saturday
