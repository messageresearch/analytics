Pressing on, pressing on. [music] Oh, pressing [singing] on, on and on and [music] on. I'm going to keep pressing on.

Is that your testimony this morning? &gt;&gt; No matter what Satan tries to tell me, &gt;&gt; I'm pressing on. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Thank you, musicians. God richly bless you. I just want to make announcement here. Sister Amy Battton had gotten some chairs from the fall fellowship. That was someone else's. I think some blue chairs, lawn chairs, they are in the church fellowship hall. If you have lost your chairs, and they're your blue and those are yours. You can go get those after service. And glad to have each and every one of our visitors here with us this morning. Glad to have brother John, sister Kimberly Weeks here with us. God bless you, Sister Debbie. And then all the other ones that usually try to leave when I I go to preach. Thank you, Sister Mary, for being here. I'm just giving her a hard time. Usually happens that usually when they're gone away and I preach, they're not here, you know. So, I'm glad to have uh Sister Mary, Brother Chris here with us. I love them definitely. And each and every one of you. I love each and every one of you. want to continue to praying for dad and Andrew there that God will bless them and strengthen them. I think their their parts of the services are done and went well. So we want to pray for for God just restore their bodies, strengthen them. Brother Andrew will be uh flying home uh tomorrow. So we want to pray for their safe travels there and then u dad will be spending a little time with brother David Mayor. much needed rest. And so we we appreciate brother David taking care of uh our pastor, our our brother and my dad there. So I want to pray for them that God would just strengthen them this morning. I'd like to uh go to 2 Corinthians 12 and 7. If you'd go there with me as you're turning there this morning, I'd like to take a uh a sermon title, Don't Mistake My Kindness for Weakness. &gt;&gt; Don't mistake my kindness for weakness. 2 Corinthians 12 and:e 7 says, "And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations, there was given unto me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me." And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness, and most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distress for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads at this moment. Just go to the word, Lord, in prayer. Our dear most heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for letting us be able to gather here this morning. Lord, be able to just uh join our little licks of fire, Lord, to just be a beacon of light to this dark age. Now God, I ask you that you'll just take these scriptures, lift them off the pages, Lord, and just go to our hearts this morning, God. Lord, we thank you for what you're doing, what you have done. Strengthen your people here this morning, Lord. Give us an ear to hear and a heart to receive. Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated this morning. I'd also like to read Luke 7 and verse 36. And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went to the Pharise unto the Pharisees house and sat down to meet. As I said, my title this morning is don't mistake my kindness for weakness. &gt;&gt; We live in a world that often mistakes kindness for weakness. Right. &gt;&gt; When Christians choose to walk away instead of fight back, &gt;&gt; people call you soft. &gt;&gt; When we forgive, they call us foolish. &gt;&gt; When you show mercy, they think it's because we're afraid. &gt;&gt; But the truth is, it takes more strength to stay gentle in harsh world &gt;&gt; than it does to strike back. &gt;&gt; So our kindness is not a sign of weakness. &gt;&gt; It's an evidence of power under control. That's right. &gt;&gt; For the Lord said, "My strength is made perfect in weakness." &gt;&gt; That means what looks like weakness to the world is actually where God's strength shows up. &gt;&gt; Paul looked weak, battling a thorn, struggling through pain, admitting limitation. But in truth, that weakness was where God's power rested the most. &gt;&gt; I'd like to turn back to 2 Corinthians 12:9-10. I'd like to go through that again. And it says, "And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Mo glad most gladly, therefore, I would rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distress for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. &gt;&gt; See, Paul faced a thorn in the flesh. And many times we ourselves face thorns in our flesh, &gt;&gt; our own bodies, our minds, maybe, maybe even people that would come against us. Paul would say Satan a messenger that would buffet him. But in Galatians, we also see that Paul maybe had issues with his eyesight. For he said that you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me if you would have. &gt;&gt; And then he said in another place, I wrote a large letter unto you. So we see here that Paul's infirmity, his thorn in the flesh, may have been his eyesight, &gt;&gt; but it didn't stop him. &gt;&gt; See, he asked three times of the Lord, Lord, won't you take this away from me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Please, Lord, won't you just maybe move it on out of the side? But see, God didn't say, "My power, my healing, my deliverance." He said, "My grace." &gt;&gt; My grace. &gt;&gt; Grace is not just an absence of struggle, but it's the presence of strength in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; He said is sufficient for thee. And we see sufficient means enough, &gt;&gt; complete, fully adequate. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's grace is fully adequate for every situation that you're going to go through. &gt;&gt; See, Paul learned that God's grace provides and will always be greater than any pain life allows. &gt;&gt; So we know we may not get what we want. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we get what we need. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's usually as it would be a paradox. My strength is made perfect in weakness. &gt;&gt; That's a paradox. How are you strong in weakness? &gt;&gt; But it's God's strength living through us. &gt;&gt; So Paul had asked thrice, Lord, won't you just take this away from me? &gt;&gt; God said, nope. My grace is sufficient for thee. So Paul's next response is most gladly. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glorify in my infirmities. &gt;&gt; So Paul shifted &gt;&gt; what he was asking for. Now it is &gt;&gt; he shifted it. &gt;&gt; Most gladly will I take these infirmities. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Infirmities, physical weaknesses, reproaches, maybe insults of Satan, criticism, slander. We all face those things. That's right. &gt;&gt; Necessities, seasons of need of lack or need of lack, persecutions, oppositions of doing right, distresses, inward pressures, anxieties, &gt;&gt; emotional strains. &gt;&gt; Through all those things, &gt;&gt; what did Paul say? For when I am weak, &gt;&gt; when I am weak, &gt;&gt; then I am strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you turn to your neighbor this morning and say, "For when I am weak, &gt;&gt; weak, &gt;&gt; then I am strong." &gt;&gt; Because God is on my side. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; See, being a Christian is not being a &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; See, the world wants panty waist preachers that want to comfort them and give them soft words and speak little things. [applause] You didn't come to hear no panty waist preacher this morning. &gt;&gt; I didn't come to comfort you. Don't mistake my kindness for weakness. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I tell that to the world, but I'm also telling that to Satan. And that's the same attitude I want you to have. &gt;&gt; World, you don't mistake my kindness for weakness. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Because they will use and abuse and they will take advantage of you. They will say, "Well, oh, you're a Christian. You shouldn't do that. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't strike back like that." &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you one thing. God didn't give us armor to hide behind. &gt;&gt; He did not give us armor to hide behind to just protect ourselves. He gave armor to you to fight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will be with thee. &gt;&gt; I will go before thee." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. So in this war of the flesh, he's going to be with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Good. &gt;&gt; But being a Christian is not being a &gt;&gt; It takes strength to be patient. &gt;&gt; It takes love to face hate. &gt;&gt; It takes standing firm in faith when the world pushes you to compromise. &gt;&gt; It takes courage to forgive, bravery to stand true, and endurance to keep running a race. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Carrying a cross is no easy task. It's the ultimate act of strength. &gt;&gt; Dad would tell me over and over again going through high school when when I was a little younger and I had a lot of people that like to pick on me. I really had a hard time with that. I was a much littleer guy then. People made fun of me for wearing glasses. People made fun of me for the way I acted. I wanted friends. &gt;&gt; I want it to be light. I think every single one of us can say that and say I want to be liked. &gt;&gt; But me doing that also showed them I was a kind person. So they would take and they would use that against me. So God, excuse me, dad had a statement for me. He said, "Tell you what, you take this Bible and you carry it with you to school. &gt;&gt; And you tell them sissies that want to pick on you, that think they're stronger than you, if you're such a man, &gt;&gt; you carry this." [applause] &gt;&gt; Cuz it takes a real man to carry the word of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; Takes some real sisters to carry the word of God. &gt;&gt; So if the world thinks there's such that &gt;&gt; Yeah. carry this. &gt;&gt; Carry this. &gt;&gt; It takes more to carry this than it does to make fun of people. &gt;&gt; But that's the way the world would want to do. They want to make fun of you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They want to take you for granted, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, I I'm sure a lot of you have family members that is not Christians, but because you are a Christian, they will come to you in time of their needs. True. &gt;&gt; In time of their needs, &gt;&gt; and they will want you to go out of your way. &gt;&gt; Because you're weak. You're a Christian. You're meek. I'm sorry. That's not who we are. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say, "In the backyard, us Brandoms, &gt;&gt; we we'd fight a little bit. We'd get in some tussles a little bit, but in the front yard, &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. We stood together. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; We stood together. &gt;&gt; So, sometimes you might see me and I'll take brother me and brother Alen. We'll agree to disagree on ways things maybe should be in the backyard. &gt;&gt; But in the front yard, &gt;&gt; if someone messes with any of you, &gt;&gt; if somebody comes &gt;&gt; to buffet any of you, &gt;&gt; we're standing in the front yard to meet them. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because God has given us the power, the authority. &gt;&gt; We have Mark 16 in action. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We're not sissies about taking the word of God and using it. &gt;&gt; So, Satan, don't mistake my kindness for weakness this morning. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; We have a business partner that he started going to a church in the valley. And I won't say what church it is, but he started going because his wife wanted him to go there. And while they were there, they the pastor come to him and, you know, they wanted to, you know, teach them how to be lambs and just lay themselves down and be real. &gt;&gt; And he come to us knowing dad real well. And he come to us and he said, "You know, this is what the pastor really wants." He said, "But I don't like it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Why am I teaching my child to be just a wee little lamb to let anyone run over them?" I was thinking, we'll come to a church where we teach real sons and daughters of God to be soldiers of the cross. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; See, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I want you to promise him the same way I've promised him. I want you to stand strong the say I same way I've told him I'm going to stand strong for him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He stood for each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Kindness for weakness. Quotes here. It says, "Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see." &gt;&gt; Mark Twain. Where I got my sermon from is don't mistake my kindness for weakness. I am kind to everyone. But when someone is unkind to me, weak is not what you are going to remember about me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Alap Al Capone. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, that's that was a gangster. You're quoting a gangster." Well, our prophet preached thinking man's filter, &gt;&gt; you know, got that off of a cigarette pack. &gt;&gt; So, I thought, why not? [applause] So, I'm going to repeat to you again. I am kind to everyone. A man that created soup kitchens in Chicago was kind to everyone. But when someone is unkind to me, weak is not what you're going to remember about me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We have brother Ruben back here. He just won the the strong man grip competition of the church. &gt;&gt; What was it? 190B grip. 197 &gt;&gt; 191 191 grip he gripped that thing. &gt;&gt; But you know in those same hands he's holding a baby this morning. &gt;&gt; In those same hands he'll rock Elliot to sleep. &gt;&gt; In those same hands he'll love Abigail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But with those same hands he'll protect his household. &gt;&gt; That's right. with those hanged hands, he'll go to work. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So don't mistake his kindness &gt;&gt; for weakness. &gt;&gt; He's a strong man. &gt;&gt; Strongest in the church. I would have loved to have seen Brother Meadows back in his heyday grab a hold of that thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan might have needed two two of those things cuz he'd have broke that that one. He was a strong man. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you mess with children of God, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; They're there to protect you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're go to battle for you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the same way with us. You mess with our family, our friends. &gt;&gt; Our church, &gt;&gt; oh, you'll have a fight on your hands. &gt;&gt; I've been called a yes man. That's farther than the truth than I've ever heard. I'm no yes man. So Luke 7 and36 and says and one of the Pharisees desired to him that he would eat with him and went to the Pharisees house and did sit down to meet. This word Pharisee as brother Brandon would say is an actor. &gt;&gt; An actor &gt;&gt; he was putting on so to say. So this morning, I'd like to dramatize a little bit of this story with you of Luke 7. So we see the Pharisee and he's having a great feast and he says, you know, we need some entertainment. We need somebody to just kind of make us feel good about ourselves. &gt;&gt; I've heard about this so-called preacher in the area, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'd like for him to kind of come to our house. we'll kind of see what he's all about. So, I can see the Pharisee Simon go to his courier and say, "Listen, I want you to find this man. I don't care what it takes. I need you to have him here at this banquet that I'm having." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, I can see the courier running days, whatever it may be, however long it might have taken in that age, running back and forth. And brother Brandham would say he was a type of a flunky because he was one of the lowest of the households. And so this this flunky, this courier was running back and forth trying to find, hey, have you heard of Jesus of Nazareth? Do you know where maybe he's at? Where can I find him at? I got to find him. Then he comes up on a crowd. And as brother William was speaking last night, maybe he was preaching his first doctrine. You must be born again. &gt;&gt; Preach it. and he come up on this crowd and he he met Philillip or maybe Luke or one of the disciples there and he says, "Listen, I need to get to your master. I need to give him a message." And I could see maybe one of them say, "You're not getting to this. This this is Jesus. You you're just not just coming up." He said, "Well, I have a message from the Pharisee. &gt;&gt; I have a message from Simon the Pharisee that I need to get to Jesus." So, I could just imagine when he got to Peter and what Peter might have told him. &gt;&gt; But then Jesus heard that he was invited. And you know the thing about Jesus, he always comes to where he's invited. &gt;&gt; I don't care where it's at. If you invite him, he will come. &gt;&gt; So this Pharisee had invited him to come to meet. So here's Jesus after preaching. He's made these long travels and he's come to Simon's house and he sits and he's waiting and there is Simon and all of them looking upon Jesus &gt;&gt; to make fun of Jesus &gt;&gt; to make light of Jesus. See, brother Brandon would say that this Pharisee might have thought that he had a trump card up his sleeve. That he might have would have said, you know, the days of miracles are passed. You know, all them people that may have died, they didn't really die. Those people that he resurrected, they didn't really resurrect. You know, that's just he he's a mental telepathy. He's just a fortune teller. don't believe any of those things, but we're going to bring him here and we're going to make a light of this Jesus and see what all the noise is about. And so, here's Jesus that has made his travels to come to Pharisees house to Simon's house to sit down and meet with him. And as he sits down, he's got dirty feet from the dust of that age of, you know, the roads ain't like they are today. the the same roads that the donkeys went down, the cattle went down, people went down &gt;&gt; wearing sandals and just walking and the way that they would have robes and the dust would fly up and and I mean, you're walking in the manure and it's not a pretty sight. &gt;&gt; It's not streets of gold, &gt;&gt; and your feet get filthy of all the things of the world, &gt;&gt; of all the things of life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but there's a little lady that heard maybe the commotion that that was going on around Simon's house. &gt;&gt; And there's the commotion and she's going, "Wonder what? What's going on?" And and she maybe hears, "It's Jesus. It's Jesus." And this little lady from all of the things that she's been through in life thinks, "I've got to get to Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I've got to get to him." &gt;&gt; And she hears that, "Well, they're making fun of him. They're not even washing his feet because before you would go into a house in that day, they had what they called footwash flunkies. &gt;&gt; A job that Jesus would step down and become a footwash flunky &gt;&gt; for even his disciples. One of the lowest of lowest of jobs. &gt;&gt; And there he sat and they would not even attend. I'm sure that Simon had gave specific orders. All the other guests wash their feet. Grant them with a kiss. Give them a robe as they would enter. &gt;&gt; But this man, don't touch him. &gt;&gt; Don't touch him. I am going to make a public spectacle of Jesus today. Simon, a Pharisee, one of the great religious leaders of this day, making fun of Jesus. That's &gt;&gt; right. And here is this little girl, this little lady that life has been not fair to her. &gt;&gt; Maybe she was put into this lifestyle because she had to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Used and abused of men around that city, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; One of the lowest of the lowest. And here she is. And she sees Jesus with dirty feet. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, you know what she does? She runs back to her home. Brother Brandham says is maybe she pulled out this sock that she had been saving money in for years and years. And she runs to this store where they would sell ointments, alabaster box of ointments, where would we keep precious perfumes and fragrance and here she comes into this this storekeeper and brother Brandon would say that he would like he would had had a bad mood because he couldn't pay his rent. What do you want? &gt;&gt; I want to buy the best of the best perfume. I want the very best you got. What are you doing in here? Someone's of your liking. You can't afford this. I could just see his face as she would pull out maybe that sock full of money. Where'd you get that money at? She'd say, "I want the very best you got." Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, who are you to buy something like this? Brother Brandham would say, "In perfect strength by perfect weakness." And we find out that those people who are the weakest and rejected by the outside world is God's heroes. &gt;&gt; That conqueror up on the front line takes those who feel themselves unworthy. Notice that it takes the weakest and rejected. And practically every hero God ever had on the front lines was a type of that person. &gt;&gt; A person that was rejected. A person that thought he was insignificant. She thought she was insignificant, unworthy to go wash Jesus's feet. &gt;&gt; A person that had no ability at all. Then that person just in good a shape so God can start using them. That's right. When they feel like they can't, they haven't got nothing, that's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them. You see, but when we are thinking that we're able to do it, then God can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves, &gt;&gt; but he takes the ones that think they're insignificant, the ones that think they can't do it. That's God's heroes. Here is this little hero in the Bible that's thinking, questioning in her mind, I am unworthy. He will know who I am. He will know what I've done. He will know where this money come from that I bought this alabaster box with. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, and maybe she turned to go out of the house, out of that store. She turned around and said, "No, no, I'm going to buy that and I'm going to take and put that on the Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; And there's Jesus sitting in the house. Not a kiss, not a robe, but they're over in the corner making fun of him. &gt;&gt; Simon making light of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Look at him. Look at Look at him. Just filthy. See, he thinks he's got power. We have the power. Look at this feast that I've put on. &gt;&gt; Look at my house that I have. He don't even have a house to live in. Look at him. Dirty feet. Why would anybody want to have relation of friendship with Jesus? &gt;&gt; That's right. And I can see this little lady as she's pressing through the crowd because wherever Jesus is, there's people. &gt;&gt; Wherever Jesus is, there's going to be a gathering. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She presses through, makes her way. No one could stop her from doing what she's about to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she goes and she takes and she's crying, weeping. Tears are flowing so much. She begins to wash Jesus's feet. &gt;&gt; Wash over and over again. She begins to kiss his feet over and over again. Washing the filth of the dirt, the dung, all of it off of Jesus's feet. all of it. Her hair is now starting to mat over as she's rubbing all this dirt. As she's taking all of this off of him, see her strength was in her kneeling and worshiping Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh my. There you go. &gt;&gt; See, it takes strength to pour out &gt;&gt; what you've been saving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's been saving a lot. &gt;&gt; That's right. She didn't know what she was saving all that money for, but now &gt;&gt; up to this point, now she knows. &gt;&gt; Out of all of the torment that I've been through, &gt;&gt; I have been saving all of this for this moment. &gt;&gt; Church, I I just want you to recognize what a moment that that was. &gt;&gt; What a moment in time for her &gt;&gt; that it took. poured out everything that she had within her. Everything she owned &gt;&gt; was in that alabaster box. &gt;&gt; But what she walked away with was greater than anything she'd ever been through in life. &gt;&gt; Any persecution that she'd ever went through, she would walk down the streets. People would maybe look at her and turn the other way, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Despising her because of what she had been, &gt;&gt; right? Now she sits at Jesus's feet, washing our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Paul would say, "When I am weak, then I am strong." &gt;&gt; And that's what this woman was living out. Her tears weren't a sign of defeat. They were evidence of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Her silence wasn't weakness. It was worship. That's right. &gt;&gt; She was worshiping &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, Jesus honors the heart, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not the reputation. &gt;&gt; See, and there's Simon over in the corner now, making light of both of them. Why is she here? &gt;&gt; Why is she washing his feet? &gt;&gt; Simon saw her sin. &gt;&gt; Jesus saw her worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Simon saw all of her humanity. &gt;&gt; Jesus saw forgiveness. &gt;&gt; And they're making light of what the situation is. &gt;&gt; But she didn't care now that she's at the one Savior's feet washing Jesus's feet. And as she would begin to break that alabaster box, &gt;&gt; that perfume over and begin to just wash his feet with now the perfume, the fragrance. See, once you break that, there's no putting it back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Once that sweet smelling savior comes into the room, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, &gt;&gt; you just can't get rid of it now. &gt;&gt; Now it has filled the room. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the people of the banquet are starting to realize &gt;&gt; what's going on. &gt;&gt; I would say that day Simon the Pharisee lost a few friends. &gt;&gt; If they were in their right mind, they lost he lost a few friends that day &gt;&gt; because that day they caught on to what he was trying to do. &gt;&gt; When you rejected your own flunkies to do the job they're meant to do. And now this lady of her reputation is sitting here washing his feet. &gt;&gt; I would say that day Simon's house become empty over the next few years. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And as he would go, he would begin to think in himself, if he knew who she was, &gt;&gt; there it is. Right? &gt;&gt; If Jesus really knew who she was, he would stop her from touching him. He would stop her from doing this. &gt;&gt; If he really knew who she was now, Simon is thinking this in the scriptures, you even know he's thinking this, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But he says, Jesus then says,"Simon, &gt;&gt; I have somewhat to say to thee." &gt;&gt; That's right. When Simon's thinking it, Jesus is knowing. &gt;&gt; Jesus knows your heart. &gt;&gt; Jesus knows Satan's heart. &gt;&gt; The struggles that he's putting against y'all. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The torments that he's putting upon you. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus knows. &gt;&gt; But he is not going to leave you in this estate. &gt;&gt; That's right. He is not going to just keep you here &gt;&gt; in this condition. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He didn't keep her in that condition. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The perfume has now filled the room. Now every ear is attuned to what Jesus is about to say to Simon. &gt;&gt; The master of the house &gt;&gt; is now the master of the house. Amen. &gt;&gt; He showed up. &gt;&gt; Simon, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. &gt;&gt; When I entered this door, you refused to wash my feet. &gt;&gt; Why I set, you refused to give me a kiss. &gt;&gt; You refused to give me a robe to enter the banqueting room. &gt;&gt; Right? But this lady since she has come into the house, she has not stopped to wash my feet. &gt;&gt; She has not stopped to give me kiss. She anointed my feet with perfume. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Then he says, Simon, there's there was a debtor, a creditor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Two people owed this creditor, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; 1500 and 150. And this creditor comes and he forgives both of them. &gt;&gt; Who do you think worshiped him the most? &gt;&gt; Who do you think &gt;&gt; thanked him the most? And Simon thought, got myself in a pickle. probably the one that he forgave the most. Lord, he he's beginning to get a little religious himself. &gt;&gt; Simon, you said right. You're right, Simon. You got something right today. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because this lady, though her sins were many, &gt;&gt; all &gt;&gt; are forgiven. [applause] &gt;&gt; Because [cheering] Jesus sitting there with kindness because he's invited. &gt;&gt; Simon wanted to make him look weak. &gt;&gt; But now, who's the stronger one? Who has the most power in the building? &gt;&gt; It's Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you think you're strong, you're weak. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When I think I'm weak, I'm strong. &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. &gt;&gt; But there's Jesus, the most powerful one of all. The one that hold the stars, the heavens in existence. &gt;&gt; The one that created every single one of us. now is forgiving her all of her sins. &gt;&gt; As she looks at that little lady, he gives her the best words that she ever has received. &gt;&gt; All thy sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Go in peace. &gt;&gt; Go in peace. Though it's a very delicate and beautiful word, peace, &gt;&gt; there's enough power in all of heaven &gt;&gt; to break every chain &gt;&gt; that ever held her bound &gt;&gt; there. He was creator of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Go in peace. Thy sins are forgiven you. That's what many of us have heard. &gt;&gt; Go in peace. &gt;&gt; Many of us have heard those words. All your sins are forgiven you. &gt;&gt; See, as brother William was preaching last night, you must be born again. &gt;&gt; And when you are born again, &gt;&gt; oh, &gt;&gt; I don't care what you've done. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; go in peace. Though the world might think you're weak for where you're standing at now, &gt;&gt; you're in a most powerful position. &gt;&gt; You have more power than the angels in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you can sing Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound &gt;&gt; that saved a wretch like me. &gt;&gt; Not even the angels can sing that song. That's right. &gt;&gt; One of these days when we all walk through those heavenly gates, &gt;&gt; step on those streets of gold and we're singing Amazing Grace. &gt;&gt; There's going to be church ages that has been there for years, years, and years. And they're going to say, "Who is that?" That's the bride of Christ. The children of Leota that made it through. Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the most wicked and tormenting ages of all. &gt;&gt; They made it through. &gt;&gt; How did they make it through through that? &gt;&gt; Because there was a power that was laying on the inside of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That not even Satan could come against. &gt;&gt; So when Satan comes to buffet you, you just remind him. &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother William said, there's a good game trail back and forth to where I've drawn him back to where I left it all. &gt;&gt; You remind him where your sins are &gt;&gt; in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; You can't bring them back up, Satan. [applause] &gt;&gt; You can't torment me with anymore, Satan. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Don't mistake his mercy for weakness. &gt;&gt; He was humble enough to wash their feet, but holy enough to forgive their sins. &gt;&gt; He was gentle enough to cradle a child, but powerful enough to calm the raging sea. &gt;&gt; He was silent before the accusers, but savior over the grave. He could bleed like a man, but yet he rose like a king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Meek, but never weak. &gt;&gt; Lowly, but never lacking. Slain, but never stopped. So don't mistake my kindness for weakness. I'm walking in power with the one who turned his pain into power and his cross into a crown. &gt;&gt; Don't mistake my kindness for weakness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say that this morning? Don't mistake my kindness for weakness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a strong people. &gt;&gt; You're a strong bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The thorn didn't stop Paul's message. It strengthens his message. &gt;&gt; The same grace that held him up is the same grace that's holding me right now. &gt;&gt; I may bleed, but I still believe. I may bend, but I won't break. I may walk with a limp, but I won't walk without power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because every scar is a story of my survival. &gt;&gt; Every tear is a testimony of my grace. Every weakness is an opportunity for God to show himself strong. &gt;&gt; So don't mistake my kindness for weakness. &gt;&gt; There's power in this pain, purpose in pressure, victory in this valley. The thorn didn't come to take me out. It came to give God glory. &gt;&gt; As long as his grace is sufficient, remember what that means? Fully adequate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His grace is fully adequate. &gt;&gt; I'm still standing. I'm still surviving. I'm still shouting. &gt;&gt; For when I am weak, [applause] &gt;&gt; then I am strong. &gt;&gt; Give him praise in the house of God this morning. [applause] Thank you Lord for when I am weak [applause] then I am strong. Thank you Lord. [applause] We worship you Lord. We pour our worship out upon you this morning. We give you glory Lord. We thank you Lord. Let the aroma just feel this presence. Feel it in the church this morning. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; worshiping you. I'm worshiping you.
