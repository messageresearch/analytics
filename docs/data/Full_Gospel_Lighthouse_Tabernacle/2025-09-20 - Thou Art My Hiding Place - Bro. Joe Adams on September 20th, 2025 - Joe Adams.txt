As we go to the prayer request this evening, I want to remember our pastor, brother Ron Spencer, that God would just continue to touch him, heal him, drive out that cancer, as well as sister Teresa Delaney. And then our sister Wanda Hinkle, that God would just touch both of them sisters there, as well as our brother Jeff Breeden. That God will heal him. I want to remember sister Francis Lamb.

Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believers we have here? [Music] &gt;&gt; How many believe the first scripture in the Bible? In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; If you believe that God can be here, you have to believe every vindicated word. He vindicated. He created a world. Let's create a place where he can come in this evening and worship with us. I want to worship him tonight. I thank him for healing. I thank him for deliverance of of sin here, but I thank him that he's gave us an eternal place in his heart. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Almighty God, we just look unto you, Lord, this evening. What a grand opportunity we have here to come together, my brothers and my sisters, Lord, to come into a place that's been set aside, Lord. Lord, we're setting outside of the world, Lord, where we're in a a place where you are welcome, Lord, and we're just bidding you come, Lord. come by our way, Lord, one more time. Lord, to speak to us in a way that only you can speak to us, Lord. Lord, we see your miracles around us, Lord. We we hear of the things that's going on around the world, but Lord, we know that you are an everpresent help in a time of need. And Lord, I'm asking you, Lord, to come by our way this evening, Lord. Lord, bless Brother Ron and continue to touch his body, a living testimony, Lord. But I know that his heart is distraught this evening, Lord, because his bosom buddy has has made the accasm of walking on to the the what you had prepared for him. And Lord, I'm praying, Lord, you would be there, Lord, and and be there with the family of God there in Vancouver, Lord. And Lord, they're missing a pastor and a and a bosom friend there. But Lord, you can send comfort to them, Lord, knowing that we only have days and moments until we see them again. Lord, I think about Brother Frasier and them getting together and saying, "Praise God, you're here this evening. Lord, I'm praying, Lord, you would just take and have your way. Lord, continue to touch Sister Wanda. Lord, continue to touch her body and and be there with with Randy, Lord, blessing him, Lord."

[Music] [Applause] [Music] Do you feel like something is wrong here? Like you don't belong here. It's not just you. Do you look at a night sky full of stars? Feeling aching in your heart. I feel it, too. We might be here for now, but don't forget where we're going. Going to trade this world for a better place. Going to wave goodbye to the hurt and the pain. We'll dance on trees of gold when we get where we're going. Going to see what our hearts have known forever. We were not made for here. We were made for heaven. Oh, [Applause] [Music] do you long to see your father's face? He'll wipe your tears away and hold you close. Oh, do you know that this won't be the end? Cuz there's so much more than this. We're almost home. We might be here for now and don't forget where we're going. Going to trade this world for a better place. Going to wave goodbye to the hurt and the pain. We'll dance on streets of gold when we get where we're going. But you see what our hearts have known for heaven. We were not made for here. We were made for heaven. Oh, and the ones we've lost along the way will run to me again. Oh, my heart can hardly wait for heaven. where death is finally lost and sing. Believers stand victory and bow before the king of kings in heaven. We might be here for now, but don't forget where we're going. Going to trade this world for a better place. Going to wave goodbye to the hurt and the pain. We'll dance on streams of gold when we get where we're going. Going to see what our hearts have known forever. We were not made for you. We were made for heaven. [Music] [Applause] Oh, we were made for heaven. Don't forget where we're going. Don't forget where we're going. We were made for heaven. [Music] [Applause] The fact is you're caught in a battle. and you'll feel like you're losing the war. And the fact is that it's raged on for so long that your steps have grown weary. and soul. Oh, but that's just the fact of the matter. The truth has not left you behind. When the facts have you bound up in sorrow, [Music] the truth says you're free one more time. And the truth is that you're not forsen. And the truth is you won't be denied. Well, the facts may may be stacked up against you right now. But the truth is that God is on your side. Now, in fact, there been times you have questioned, should you throw up your hands and just give in? And in fact, you have said there's just no reason to keep fighting when you'll never win. [Music] Oh, but that's not the end of this story. The truth says you shall overcome [Music] when the facts have you almost defeated. The truth is you've already won. For the truth is you're not forsaken. [Music] And the truth is you won't be denied. All the facts may may be stacked up against you right now, but the truth is the truth is yes. The truth is that God is on your side. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't you rejoice in the Lord this afternoon &gt;&gt; to know that the Lord is on your side? &gt;&gt; Glory be to Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil, "The Lord's on my side." And that's the truth of the matter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let the bride of Jesus Christ rejoice. Hallelujah. Let all heaven hear you. Say, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that God is on your side? The God of heaven. Hallelujah. The God of the universe. is on our side. &gt;&gt; Woo! &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; King Jesus is in the room. &gt;&gt; King Jesus is in the room. &gt;&gt; And that's what we came for tonight &gt;&gt; is to have a talk with the master. &gt;&gt; The king of the universe and he has showed up. His children are here to worship him. &gt;&gt; And my what a presence that is in this place. I just be honest, the spirit of God has been so near today. Hey, I just I want you to know that whatever you have need of, I believe that God is here to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think. I don't even think you have to wait till the end of the service tonight to get a touch from the master. I believe that the master is right here, right now, and he can touch every single one of your needs. Have you come expecting this weekend? Well, I believe God is going to do something for you that you can't even comprehend this weekend. &gt;&gt; I told Brother Joe, Full Gospel Lighthouse is on the cusp of a great breakthrough. And I believe that this weekend is set up from the very mind of Almighty God. [Applause] Hallelujah. As we get ready to invite the man of God this evening, we have great confidence in this man of God. He's been used mightily around the world. I've traveled with him and he's been a bosom friend to me. But his ministry speaks it louder than even words could say. We have the utmost confidence and the respect for the man of God. And when you begin to respect the gift of God, you can allow the Holy Spirit to begin to use him and to speak right to your needs. And that's what we're asking this weekend, that God would use the man of God to speak to us in a very specific way. So, as we get ready to invite our brother Joel, let's just sing that song. Do you see? That's not the song, but Amazing Grace shall always be my song of praise. For it was grace that bought my liberties. I do not know just why he came to love me so. [Music] He looked beyond all my hearts and he saw my need. I shall forever live my eyes to Calary. [Music] Oh, the cross where Jesus died. He died for you and he died for me. How marvelous the grace that I s beyond all my thoughts and he saw my knees. I shout forever. I shout for [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] The praise and our [Music] we are [Music] in song. [Music] Amen. Aren't you thankful &gt;&gt; that he looked beyond your faults? &gt;&gt; He looked beyond your failures. He looked beyond your weaknesses. He looked beyond your humanity and he saw your need &gt;&gt; and he knew you had a need of him, a need of healing, a need of deliverance, a need of the Holy Ghost. and he looked beyond all that and he's coming tonight to minister to your need to be a personal God for you tonight. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, what a great privilege we have before us tonight. Lord, we stand before the purchase of the blood, Lord. Lord, the bride of this last day, Father, and you would come in this hour, Father, through a vindicated message and begin to Lord, reveal yourself like no other time, no other age, God. And you would come, Lord God, not only to meet the needs of the people, but so encapsulate them with a message, Lord, to prepare them for a body change, a rapture, Lord. And Lord, prepare them for the future home. Lord, an invisible union has been taking place many years now. And Father, we just want to come tonight and put our shoulder to the wheel here at Full Gospel Lighthouse. Lord, not that we have anything special to say, but God, all that we can do is preach what Paul preached. All that we can do, Lord, is stand as William Brandham stood, Lord, and preach the same gospel, the same message, the same Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we invite you to come tonight, Lord, to minister to every heart. Father, you'd come and minister to every need tonight. You know those that are here, those that are streaming, God, I ask that you would be with the Tagert family, Lord, as they're assembled together, Lord, in that room there, all the siblings gathered, Brother Zach, just text me, Lord. And I just pray, God, that you would go forth in a voice that you'd resound and thunder forth, oh God, a a word of comfort and peace to that family and their needs, Father. Lord, we love you tonight. If we yield our vessels to you, our ears to hear, Lord, our lips to speak, and our hearts to receive. Now may you may Lord we ask that you would go forth now through the preaching of your word through power and demonstration the anointing of your spirit. We ask that you have your way tonight. It's a special night. Lord say why is it special? Because the king is here. The angel of the Lord accompanies the message. So Lord I'm going to do my part. I'm going to preach the message and I invite you to come. stand here Lord and begin to anoint each and every aspect of it tonight. For we ask it in Jesus name. Amen and amen. So we bring greetings to you tonight from our pastor, brother Tim, the saints there Evening Light Tabernacle, your sister church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's uh I'm certainly honored to have my family with me and Lauren and Weston drove up from Kentucky. So, we're glad to have them here with us this weekend. And my beautiful wife. If I can preach half as good as my family can sing, we're going to have good time tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a resounding yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we want to thank brother Andrew and Brother Ron and for having us here, Brother Matt. We love the Spencer family. We go back many, many, many years. When I was just a boy, just came to the message. I went to brother Ron and said, "I feel the Lord calling me to preach." And I think I may have been 24, 25 at the time, even younger than that possibly. And here we are today. So, uh, it's not our first time here, but we're here tonight. And we just want to get ourselves out of the way and allow the Lord to speak. How many of you got a need tonight? &gt;&gt; So, as I was preparing and and traveling up, the Lord laid this thought on my heart. Thou art my hiding place. And we can take this it can turn here and I'm just going to follow the leadership of the Lord, but I know how it's going to go the first part of the service. So, we're going to look here in Psalms 32 and verse one and we're going to read down through verse 7 and we'll kind of get into the meat of the message tonight. Certainly good to see each and every one of you. The church has grown since the last time I've been here. Mercy. Brother Ron said we're not going to have everybody tonight. I'm like, my goodness, man. Where's the other half, man? Every seat's almost full. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord. God adding to the ministry. The we find here in Psalms 32 and verse one, blessed is he whose transgressions is forgiven and whose sins is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputed not iniquity. &gt;&gt; In whose spirit there is no gal. When I kept silence, my bones waxed. Oh, through my roaring all day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me. And that word heavy there means affliction. &gt;&gt; So thy hand was heavy upon me and my moisture is turned into a drought of summer. I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Sah, for in this for in this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee, and in a time when thou mayest be found. Surely in the floods of great waters, they shall not come nigh unto him. And verse seven is where we bring in our thought from tonight. For thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. God bless you. You can have your seats tonight. Amen. Well, brother Mark said he drove two hours for this, so let's not disappoint. &gt;&gt; All right, Sister Christie, good to see you back in the back. How many ready to have church? &gt;&gt; All right. How ready for a move of God tonight? I believe that should be every time we come together, we should expect God to move. We should expect God to pour out himself. And we find here, I just want to kind of set the platform tonight. We find in verse four, David is a man that's well acquainted with afflictions. David is a man that was well acquainted with hard times and troubles. As we find in verse four, it says, "For day and night, thy hand was heavy upon me." Now, how many of you have felt the heavy hand of God throughout your life? There's been times God's hands been heavy upon you. Then there's been times God's hand been pulled back from you. And we find this during these time, you got to know who God is. But more importantly, you got to know who you are in God. You got to know your position in the body of Christ. And we find David knew what it meant to have difficulties. He knew what it meant to go hiding in fear of his life. David would cry out here, for thou art my hiding place. &gt;&gt; You know, he was well acquainted with hiding. Not that he was a coward, but he was a smart man. The Bible say he's a man after God's own heart. &gt;&gt; But even a man after God's own heart, he would hide himself back in fear of his life. And we find here we find David running or hiding from Saul's spear in 1st Samuel 18 and and 19. And we find him with Samuel at Naoth and Rama. We find them behind Jonathan's plan or at Naba at Nab with Aimc the priest or in Gath among the Philistines when he pretended to be mad. We find him in the cave of Adullum. We find him in the strongholds of Judah. We find him in the cave of Engeti. We find David again in the wilderness of Ze and with the Philistines at Ziglag and he fled to Jerusalem when Abselon was coming against him. So David was a man that was well acquainted with hiding &gt;&gt; and we would count this 10 to 11 times that he had major life events. &gt;&gt; And he remarks though in Psalms 32. Notice the strongholds of Judah in the cave of Engeti in the cave of Adullum was not his hiding place. &gt;&gt; The hiding place wasn't Ziglag or Jerusalem or the wilderness of Ze in Judah. So no matter where David found himself, he would acknowledge that thou art my hiding place. No matter where he found himself, whether he was in a cave, whether he was on the back side of the desert, whether he was running for his life, David didn't give the credit to the cave, he didn't give the credit to the wilderness. David gave the credit to Almighty God. No matter where he found himself, he said, "Thou, oh God, you are my hiding place." &gt;&gt; And church, he has to be your hiding place tonight. No matter where you find yourself, it may be cancer, it may be heart trouble, it may be diabetes, it may be a broken home, it may be a sour marriage, but wherever you find yourself, you have to find him that he is your hiding place. &gt;&gt; He has to be your hiding place. &gt;&gt; What is it, brother Joe, a hiding place? It's a covering. It's a shelter. It's a secret place. It's protection. I love how David would say, "Thou art my protection. &gt;&gt; Thou art my shelter. &gt;&gt; Thou art my secret place." Brother Mark, no matter what David faced, he had a consolation because he had a relationship with almighty God. &gt;&gt; Now, if David can form such a relationship without the Holy Spirit, what kind of relationship can we form this evening? &gt;&gt; What kind of people should we be this evening with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost with the token that's been applied in this hour? What kind of people can we be if David could find him as a hiding place in his times of trouble? What about the bride? What about you and I here in Elton, Virginia, in Grotto, Virginia, wherever you come from tonight? Can't he be our hiding place? &gt;&gt; But notice David doesn't go just there. He says, "Thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Otherwise, you shall guard me from dangers. &gt;&gt; You shall preserve me." Not that we're free from having trouble, but you won't your troubles won't swallow you up. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; I mean, hey, we all go through trouble. &gt;&gt; How many of you ever not had a trouble? Some of you raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Mercy. You may come and preach. We've all, whether you're young or old, you have faced some kind of trouble in your life. &gt;&gt; And you got to know that you know that you know when God remains silent that he's still God. &gt;&gt; That God is still on the scene. And the Bible would tell us in Psalms 34 that many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivered them out of them all. Notice this word afflictions here is malignant, cancerous, life-threatening, unpleasant, evil, giving pain, unhappiness, misery, displeasing. But the promise doesn't lie in just the afflictions. We have a promise as sons and daughters of God. But the Lord, &gt;&gt; the Lord will deliver him out of them all. No matter where you find yourself, whether it's with cancer, whether it's with sugar diabetes, no matter where it's at, the Lord shall deliver. Why? because he's the believer's hiding place, &gt;&gt; secret place, a sure place, a place of protection. &gt;&gt; See, we as Christians, we have good days. We have bad days. We're not immune from adversities and trials and hardships of this life. But our safety doesn't lie in our human intellect and our great abilities. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's some of you that are smarter than me and smarter than these brothers on the platform. And you know, if we was going by intellect, &gt;&gt; you'd be up here and we'd be out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, our safety doesn't rest in psychology. Our safety doesn't rest in man-made systems. It doesn't rest in man-made schemes and and traditions. But our safety, notice, church, our safety, our protection, it rest in the anointed word of God. So you can't find safety in a man. &gt;&gt; Look, we got great men of God that this message puts out that it produces, but your safety doesn't rest in that man. It doesn't rest in any individual. Your safety, your security, your protection. It rests solely in the anointed word of God. Right? &gt;&gt; But a God, he allows us to go through things. He allows these things to mold us. You know that God puts something inside of you that only trials will bring out. &gt;&gt; God puts things inside of you, &gt;&gt; to mold you, to shape you, that only afflictions and difficulties will begin to pull out. &gt;&gt; No, no, they're not pleasant. A lot of times if we're honest, we like, why me? &gt;&gt; What did I do to deserve this? All I want to do is serve God. And look at me now. &gt;&gt; Come on. We've all been there. &gt;&gt; But brother Bam says, "You got overcoming to do." He says, "Notice now. They that overcome shall inherit all things. They that overcome, see, he says, you have power to do it, but you got to be willing to lay it down." See, God could not push us through a little pipe, pull us out the other end, and then say, "Blessed is he that overcometh." &gt;&gt; See, you had nothing to overcome. He pushed you through. But you got to make your decisions for yourself. I've got to make my decisions for myself. And in doing that, we show our faith and our respects to God. So, we got overcoming to do. Whether you're going to let the trial overtake you, whether you're going to let the sickness overcome you, whether you're going to let the adversities that you go through swallow you up, you got to make your decision tonight &gt;&gt; that I'm going to stand for this truth. I'm going to stand for this message. I'm going to stand for this gospel. I got a hiding place in the word. And no matter what comes near me, &gt;&gt; I shall not be moved. Tonight, &gt;&gt; we have a promise. Brother man will tell us and I know he says now Satan could not take them. &gt;&gt; He could not drown Noah in in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished. &gt;&gt; Well, you're like, "Well, come on, brother Joe. That was thousands of years ago. He could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished." Oh, come on, brother Joe. You're telling us Bible stories. Notice he cannot kill Job. with boils and troubles until the purpose that God had had been finished. Neither could he, notice, neither could the lions eat Daniel until God's purpose had been finished. Neither could death in old age take Abraham until the purpose of God had been finished. &gt;&gt; And neither can it take you. &gt;&gt; And neither can it take you. You're looking at an example. &gt;&gt; You're looking at an example. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lion's dens, fiery furnace, backside of the desert, whatever it is. Put whatever ter any type you want to put there. A man stage four cancer five years. Satan cannot take him until God's purpose had been finished. &gt;&gt; Now, it doesn't mean that it's going to be cookies and cream and all that along the way. It's been rough. It's been a struggle. It's been, as we would say, a rocky road. But I'm here to tell you, he found a hiding place. He found a place of safety. He found a place to rest. No matter what he's going through, no matter what comes his way, know that he gets up here and he continues to preach the same word, the same anointed word of God to tell you, if I can do it, you can do it, too. &gt;&gt; Now, we don't put that on a man, but a man had found a hiding place in the word. So neither can it take you or take me until the purpose of God of our life is finished. &gt;&gt; Notice there's a there's a when you get past 50, you forget things. But it's coming to me. It just may take a minute. My goodness. There's a quote, not brother Brandon, but there's a quote that says, "Hard times create strong men &gt;&gt; and strong men create good times. And good times create weak men and weak men create hard times." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Let me just say that again. &gt;&gt; Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. &gt;&gt; Good times create weak men and weak men create hard times. So this suggests that hardships builds character &gt;&gt; and social strength. But notice we can apply this even in the Christian perspective. &gt;&gt; Hard times create strong Christians. Notice when you're going through a battle, you get on your knees a whole lot more often than when you're not on the battlefield. &gt;&gt; When you're sitting on the mountaintop and everything's cookies and cream, everything's going great, you have no trouble in the home, there's no sickness, the kids are doing good, the the wife is good, the marriage is good, the finances are good, you don't pray. But let me tell you, when the rug is poured out from underneath you and your sickness is in your body and you're facing cancer and your and the enemy's coming to try to destroy your family, that's when you hit your knees. That makes a strong Christian. That makes a strong believer. But I want you to know tonight, church, even in those times, you can find comfort and peace in the word of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, notice. So, why do troubles come? How many you've ever asked that question? &gt;&gt; Come on, show hands. It's okay. &gt;&gt; Good. We all have. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Work with me tonight. Why does God let troubles come? The age-old question. See, God harnesses trouble, &gt;&gt; put bits in his mouth, and makes it obey him. And those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; Troubles. &gt;&gt; When you're going through the trouble, you wake up in the morning, first thing you do is pray. &gt;&gt; Oh, but there's no trouble. First thing you do is make coffee. &gt;&gt; You make breakfast. You make the bed. I'll find time for God. Oh, but something about when you're going through troubles, God allows troubles to bring you into a closer fellowship. He said there had been no rainbow until the flood came. &gt;&gt; But notice after Noah went through the tribulation that he saw the covenant rainbow. &gt;&gt; And it's a lot of times, church, it's after the trial. It's after the affliction. Do we see the promise of God manifested in front of us? And he would tell us this. Oh, we ask for comfort and we ask for peace and God gives us the best that he could. He gives us trials and tribulations. &gt;&gt; I know ain't nobody tonight's going to ask for comfort. Nobody's asking for peace. Raise your hand. You want comfort and peace. &gt;&gt; Oh mercy. Get ready for trials and tribulations. &gt;&gt; Brother man say that's better than comfort and peace. Our comfort is just beyond the river. &gt;&gt; But we finding God's way here in 1952. He says, "When the children of Israel come out of the land of Egypt, they follow God's path." And it led up to the Red Sea strange that God will lead his path up that way because we think, "Hey, I'm a believer. I come out of the world, you know, this is going to be great. We're gonna follow God. I'm I'm a believer of this message by God. God sent a prophet. This is going to be a fairy land. &gt;&gt; Well, you stay around much longer, you're going to be in for a rude awakening. &gt;&gt; You want comfort, you want peace, get ready for the trial, get ready for the affliction. But let me tell you, just beyond the trial, just beyond the the battle, just beyond the affliction, there's a promised land for you. [Applause] And we find here when they came out of Egypt, they followed God's path. It led to a Red Sea. And strange that God's path will lead that way, but his path went right through that sea. &gt;&gt; I can't believe, Brother Mark, you mean we're following Moses's message. &gt;&gt; He must have got it wrong. He must have not heard from God. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. He must not be a vindicated prophet. He must have not got that from the Lord. That must have been his own intuition. &gt;&gt; If he was any kind of prophet, he wouldn't have led us this way. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; If he was any kind of messenger, how in the world dare you, Moses, to take us to the Red Sea? We got mountains on both sides and the army's behind us. What are we going to do? And many times we find ourselves in that situation. But God's path led right through the Red Sea. And let me tell you, in your life, God is going to lead you through trials. God will lead you through afflictions. God will lead you through hard times. But it's God's path nevertheless. &gt;&gt; God's got a purpose for it. They needed to go through that sea. &gt;&gt; So when it come time, all the shadows and Israel stood there before the sea. God's path led across the sea. So God looked down through the pillar of fire and the sea got scared and moved back and Israel went across on dry ground. See, God's path led through it. &gt;&gt; See, don't question where the path leads. Just follow. &gt;&gt; See, maybe your path tonight may be a wayward child. It may be a struggle in the home. Maybe it be a mom or a wife that's not serving the Lord. Maybe it's a spouse, a husband and a father not serving the Lord, but it's God's path. &gt;&gt; See, just keep trusting. &gt;&gt; Just keep following the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; See, God knows how to lead. &gt;&gt; See, he's proven, brother Rhonda, that not even cancer will stand before the believer's prayer. Well, if that's the case, then why is he not delivered? I'm going to tell you it is the case cuz he's still alive. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You say, "I want to see a miracle. I want to see the supernatural." Well, feast your eyes on a miracle. Feast your eyes on the supernatural. It's God's leading. Not just for Ron Spencer, not just for the Spencer family, but God is declaring to this devil, to this end time generation, that I'm going to have a people. I'm going to have a bride. I'm going to lead them through affliction. I'm going to lead them through some hard times, even cancer. But inside of me, they will find me as a hiding place, as a comfort, as a protection. in this hour, in this age, God is determined &gt;&gt; that nothing will destroy his bride. &gt;&gt; Though he went, notice now they went right up to the wilderness. They leave the Red Sea and they go right into the spring of Mar. Bitter waters. My goodness, &gt;&gt; man. Couldn't catch a break. Come on. Is that you, &gt;&gt; man? Some of us come through the Red Sea. Wow. The walls are all built up, man. We rejoicing, &gt;&gt; man. We dancing. We had meetings just a few weeks ago. My God was good. &gt;&gt; Soon as the meeting was over, you get on the other side. Walls, other waters came back in. God leads you straight to bitter waters. First thing you do is, "What did I do? &gt;&gt; Why me? If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck. &gt;&gt; Come on, Eeyore. &gt;&gt; That's some of we walk around with Eeyore complex. &gt;&gt; Only way God knows me is I'm moaning and groaning. &gt;&gt; But notice, he leads him right after the Red Sea &gt;&gt; and he takes them straight to Mara, bitter waters. Ain't it strange that God will lead his children through bitter waters? &gt;&gt; I'm sure, brother Ron, that this five years has not been sweet. My I'm sure you didn't wake up and say, "God, come on. Pour it on. Let it happen a little bit more. Come on. I want to throw up again. Come on. I give me another dose of that that that that uh chemo pill or that chemo medicine." No, you're not asking for that. It's been bitter. &gt;&gt; It's been bitter waters. But every time he stands behind the desk, &gt;&gt; it's a testimony of a hiding place. &gt;&gt; And no matter what the enemy is allowed to do, he is only limited because we serve a limitless God tonight. And Satan has boundaries. And let me tell you, he can only go so far. But I'm going to tell you tonight, you can run to the hiding place. And the hells of hell, they can't get you. The pursuers, they can't touch you. You can run to that place tonight. Why does he get up here and preach on Sunday? Cuz there's a hiding place. He's found it. It's a sweet place. It's a wonderful presence. Well, they come to bitter waters and my seems like God, why'd you lead me here? But on the road, brother tell them, notice the bitter waters were standing. He said the remedy for the bitter waters were standing just on the other side of the bank. Moses got over there and he cut down a tree and he threw the tree in the water and the waters became sweet. And see just on the other side of your bitter waters is a tree of life. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Instead of moaning, instead of complaining, instead of groaning, instead of backbiting, instead of fussing about this, well, if I was the pastor, &gt;&gt; well, thank God you're not. Well, if I was a pastor, I'd do this and I'd do that and I' That's why God didn't choose you. &gt;&gt; Well, if I was the assistant pastor, well, God didn't choose you for that role either. &gt;&gt; But notice what you need is to take the tree of life and put it in your bitter waters and let those bitter waters return sweet again. Well, you'll enjoy coming to the house of the Lord. You'll enjoy the presence of God. It won't be a struggle. It won't be a push. It won't be a hardship to come to the house of God. No. And you God can make those bitter waters sweet again &gt;&gt; till you can't wait till the doors open. &gt;&gt; Maybe tonight you're dealing with sickness. Maybe you've fallen on some hard times. Jesus is the tree of life. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is put Jesus. Put them in your boat tonight. Put them in those bitter waters. Let them turn sweet again. What a man would tell us. See, that's the way God leads his children. God's path, God's provided way. If the children of Israel would have tried to bypass and go around this way, they would have gotten into trouble. Notice they had to go to the Red Sea. If they tried to go around it, they'd have got in trouble. They had to come to bitter waters. If they would have tried to go around, they would have got in trouble. And we find today, church. Brother Bam said they had to follow the pillar of fire. They had to follow. And if they had to follow the pillar of fire, so do we have to follow the same pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; See, they had to follow a cloud of fire. Pillar of fire that led them. They followed that. And if the church tonight will only follow the pillar of fire, the Holy Spirit, you'll make Canaan as sure as anything. God has a way, a provided way. But we find men today, you know, they're following after a man. &gt;&gt; Oh, we have a headquarters now. I know we don't like to preach like this. They tell you when to listen to something. &gt;&gt; Come on. tell you how to listen to something. Somebody sent me a little picture today. It had a a little house and it it was in Spanish and it was a token. This is how you tell every tape home now has a little house with the token applied to it on the door. Let me tell you, we're not people that's done gone to relics and idol type things. No, our token is the Holy Ghost. Our token is still the blood. Our token, that's what we're going. That's what we're applying to the house today. That's what we're applying to the marriages today. We don't take some little trinket and put it on the door and say, "Bless God, we got the token." &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you wake to hell, firefalls, and the bomb start dropping. That little cookie house is going to burn up. &gt;&gt; But if you got the token on the inside, if you found yourself in that hiding place when that first bomb fall, baby, we're going up. We're going to pass that thing goodbye. Why? Because we found a refuge. We found a secret place. We found a protection. &gt;&gt; B says, "Sometimes we think our burdens, he goes, I might interject here. Sometimes we think our burdens are just so heavy sometimes that there's nothing like it in the world. &gt;&gt; Come on. Full gospel. Woo. Sometimes like, man, I need a friend to help me tote these things around. &gt;&gt; It's tough. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you these men. It looks all fabulous, doesn't it? Boy, standing behind the desk preaching. Everybody gets to look at them. Look at them. Ain't none of them saying, "Look at me." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; No, but what you don't see is the struggles. &gt;&gt; What you don't see is the personal attacks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you don't see is the affliction, &gt;&gt; but what you see is a hiding place. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it's hidden them. They don't preach their affliction. They don't preach their troubles. They don't preach the things that they go through. &gt;&gt; They stand here to present Christ &gt;&gt; and him crucified. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The other day, I'll just interject here and I come back to this quote. The other day, probably about a month ago, I had a dream. I had a snake come. I was sleeping, Brother Ron, and the snake bumped up beside me. Never saw the head. I just the body just bumped up beside me. And I was like, in my dream, I was like, you know, you ever in my same dream, it comes back the other direction, bumps me again. See, I was bumped twice in the last two years. I've been full-time ministry four years now. In the last two years, I've been bumped. I've been rubbed. I've been pushed. I've been tried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By things out there among our peers. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Things try to bump you and try to shake you. Satan will try to do those. Never saw the face. Never saw the head. Only just felt the body of it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; See, we feel sometimes our burdens. Man, you want to just throw down the towel and say, "Forget this. If this is all that the message can produce, I don't want to preach it anymore. &gt;&gt; Men of God struggling and fighting and bumping each other. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm tell you, &gt;&gt; when it's when you're not your own, when you've been bought with a price, as much as you try to walk away, as much as you try to quit, you can't quit. &gt;&gt; When you find that hiding place and he becomes a place of protection, you just look at it for what it is and keep your eyes on the goal. and keep pushing and keep pressing keep pressing to the mark of the high calling. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're going to we're we're being tried, &gt;&gt; but that's the that's that's the hour in which we're living in. &gt;&gt; You know, you're tried on a different level than what we're tried. But we find, brother Bam, nevertheless, is that we think our burdens are so heavy sometimes that nothing there's nothing like it in the world. Do you all know those things are good for you? Well, you got a wicked sense of humor. &gt;&gt; This ain't no fun. I didn't sign up for this. None of us did. &gt;&gt; See, they're all to mold you and to make you prophets and sages. They were molded on the backside of the desert in the hot blazing sun through tribulations and trials and persecutions. And these things that we have today, there's nothing happened to us that hasn't happened to other Christians before. other Christians has had to stand in their hour of darkness like this and even be fed to lines for their testimony, but they stood their test. &gt;&gt; And can I tell you somebody, God is going to have a bride in this hour and she will stand her test. Let me tell you, Satan, in the name of the Lord this evening, you don't have enough to keep this bride down. You don't have enough to stop her. We will take a rapture. We will take a body change. Why? Because we have entered into a hiding place. And it ain't the church. And it ain't some man. And it ain't some gift. It's the word of God. That's our secret place. &gt;&gt; So he knows how to mold you. He knows the kind of material that he's going to use. See, all of us are different. I had a brother asked me the other day. I was in Mexico. He said, "Does, does all the other brothers in your church preach like you?" I'm like, "No, I'm the only one." I was like, "What you mean?" I mean, like you all. Now, this is being interpreted through Spanish. Does all of them get like you just No, I'm probably the most out of all of them. &gt;&gt; But see, God put certain material in us, &gt;&gt; certain gifts in us. &gt;&gt; See, we ting a little bit different. &gt;&gt; I'm like a little Chihuahua. Let me tell you, I saw authenticated Chihuahua in Mexico last week. authenticated. About that tall, long, about that tall, running through a little road. All right, bro. Don't you bite that tire. You going to flip around. But you know, little Chihuahua, look, he's got everything in the world to prove. And God knows how to place little Chihuahua in the church. &gt;&gt; They keep it lively. They keep the amens coming. They keep the hallelujah rolling. A little to hallelujah. Glory. Get some emotion in the church. Get some excitement in the house of God. Expect the impossible. Expect the supernatural. Don't tell a little Chihuahua to shut up. He'll say amen a little bit longer and a little bit louder and he won't sit down and he'll keep pulling and he'll keep preaching and he'll keep shouting and he'll keep Oh hallelujah church but God puts things in us certain things. Now as much as I want to be like Mr. politician over here. We call brother Ron. He's the politician of the ministry. I mean, look, we went to lunch today. Brother Andrew, I almost did it. I almost put my suit on, man. I'm going I'm going to have lunch with the president. Ronald Dean, the man was in a three-piece suit at lunch. We went to his house. It wasn't like we went to town. But not everybody can be a Ronald Dean. Not everybody can be an Andrew or a Mark or a Matt or not everybody can be a Jo and not everybody can be you. But realize God placed something in you &gt;&gt; that your neighbor needs, that this church needs, that this ministry needs. God plays something in you. And only you can team. Only you can sound. Only you can write down with the same. Amen. Church. But God knows what it takes to mold you. &gt;&gt; And he puts things in us. See, he knows how to mold you. the material that he's going to use on the back side of the desert sometimes. When you feel like you ain't got a friend, when you feel like you're all alone, when you feel like maybe you didn't come from a a family of preachers, but you got to know when God called you. &gt;&gt; That you ain't called by a man, you're called by him. &gt;&gt; See, the battle so does God's mold. He says, "Now sometimes where God mows righteous men into sages and prophets is on the back side of a desert." It's not through the flowery bed of ease of the great supernatural services that they have and there's an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the supernatural falls and people are being healed and delivered and set free and slain in the spirit. It's not during those times. Oh, it's in that prayer closet when they've been bumping with the enemy. They've been rubbing shoulders and things are coming and they keep they keep the course. They stay steady. Notice he said that's where men are beat out. Men are beat out in in the word. He says when when they got all this kind of creed and stuff in them, let them come to the word and God beats it right out of them. Modes it right into this into the great symphony with his word. &gt;&gt; So God is a conductor. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a conductor and and brother would tell us and I'm going to kind of go down this line for a minute. He said he knows when the rhythm of it has to change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For 20some years I was doing my own thing. 20some years I didn't grow up in a Christian home. I didn't grow up in the me I didn't know anything about it. I was doing what I did. And but God knew when the music needed to change. God knew when the rhythm of my life needed to change. And God knows when the rhythm of your life needs to change. And so what does God do? God will pull the rug out from underneath you to get you in sync with the word. &gt;&gt; See, he knows. He He knows how it goes. I don't. But I look to here and he says it just keeps coming. See, God allows us to go through things in order for the rhythm of our lives. to get in sync with the word. So, there's times where we begin to think we can do it on our own. Some men get elevated. They get lifted up and they think, "Well, I'm a great somebody." And they now they have little satellite groups. But God knows how to change the symphony, the rhythm of the music, the rhythm of the word. And maybe we start seeing things different in the word, misplacing things. Then God knows how to change the rhythm to get you back in sync and say what only what a prophet says. &gt;&gt; So he knows how to do that. He says, "Now many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God deliverth him out of them all." See, God has moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of his word. &gt;&gt; Notice the rhythm of the promise of his word in each age and in the same rhythm making his word. That's how God moved down through history from all the way from Genesis to Revelation. He has moved through history with the word. That's right. With the rhythm of the power of the Holy Spirit, vindicating his word to the elect. &gt;&gt; And it's no different today. The rhythm. Your pastor preached a message many years ago. It'll never change. But the music, &gt;&gt; the ne the hurt or the affliction will never stop the music. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the rhythm, God knows the rhythm of it. He knows how it flows. He knows how to mold you. And see, the Hebrew children, they were forced into a fiery furnace. But see, God began to change the rhythm of the music because he was going to have three young boys that refused to bow. &gt;&gt; That's right. in Babylon without mom, without dad, without preacher, without pastor, without a prophet. &gt;&gt; Or they had a prophet and they erected a big old statue to him, but they refused to bow down to it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And we find, notice, then we find Daniel here. Daniel had purposed in his heart. When the law was levied against him, you go and pray, you're going to be thrown into a den of lions. Daniel didn't run to the next country. Daniel didn't run to the next house. He didn't run to the next church. He went home, opened the curtains, and began to pray like he's always done. &gt;&gt; See, because that's what was in Daniel. Daniel to purpose in his heart that he would not defile himself. And notice, after the test, did the angel of the Lord appear &gt;&gt; in his den of lions. &gt;&gt; After the test did the fourth man appear in the fiery furnace. Think about Abraham here. Lot chose the better land of Sodom. And Abraham's on the back side of the desert. Everybody's complaining, moaning, groaning. It's hot. Everything's dried up. And Abraham had to make a decision. I'm going to stay exactly where God told me to stay. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not church hopping. I'm not going looking for a better this and or better that. I'm going to stay exactly where the Lord planned me. I'm not going to keep looking. I'm going to stay right here. And what did what did Abraham find after the test that Abraham went through? Then Elohim showed up. Let me tell you, after the test, he met the He met God Almighty, church. It's after the test. &gt;&gt; So, let me just give you a word of encouragement tonight. Don't look at your trial. Look at the promise after the trial. &gt;&gt; See, we're not immune from trials. We're not immune from difficult seasons. And but David reminds us no matter where you find yourself that he's our hiding place. &gt;&gt; He's our high tower. He's our refuge. He's our rock in a weary land. But it's after the trial, after you overcome that the Lord draws nigh. Brother Ron, I was watching Brother Wayne preach Sunday morning of your meetings. It was a few days after the service was over and I was home by myself. the family was gone and I was listening and and I'd been like I said I've been bumped. I've been going through some things. Brother Andrew and I you we talked about some of these things that I've been going through back when we were together a few months ago and you know sometimes these things are not quickly you don't quickly get over them. But I was sitting there and I was listening to brother Wayne minister and begin to talk about the angel of the Lord and how would we begin to draw near and and I just begin to just I could feel the presence of the angel draw in and I can feel him just push out. Tears begin to well then he just kind of come and then kind of go. But at certain point during the preaching of the the message the angel Lord just drew near and I just lay put my hands up again to weep to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, it's after the trial. &gt;&gt; It's after How are you going to respond? &gt;&gt; How are you going to respond? Do you dig in, Chihuahua? Do you dig in or do you throw your hands up? &gt;&gt; See, you throw your hands up because the presence of the Lord drew near and I just wept like a baby in my living room. Just cried out to God, thanking God, Lord, thank you. And now it's over. Now it's over. Now we can move on. &gt;&gt; And see, it's after the test that he shows up. And you maybe you feel that warm presence. Maybe you feel him draw nigh. Even now you draw nigh to your situation. And maybe tears may try to well up or maybe it's a shout that wells up. But notice it was after the battle Melzdc appeared to Abraham. A lot of times, church, it's not during the battle. It's not during the test. It's not during the affliction. It's always after. &gt;&gt; But David says, "Thou art my hiding place." &gt;&gt; Can I go a little further tonight? &gt;&gt; Thou art my hiding place. This is an illusion to the cities of refuge. And Moses, God told Moses, "Moses, when you get over into the land of Canaan, I want you to erect these cities of refuge." And that if any man had done anything by mistake and he killed somebody, because in that day it was eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth and you know, thank God we don't live in that day. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; man. We'd pull our 357s out. Boom. Got you. Yeah. Come in my church. Do that again. No, this ain't the hood, people. Thank God we wasn't hoods in that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it was eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. And you know, but if if that person, they knew that they did it and they did it accidentally. If they could get to that city of refuge, if they could get to that hiding place and the doors shut behind them, they knew then that no matter how many pursuers was on their trail, they couldn't come inside there that the pursuer couldn't get to them. And what am I telling you tonight? Let me tell you, the same word applied to them is the same word that applies to us tonight. If you did it by mistake, you didn't want to do it and you ran to that house of refuge, that hiding place. Let me tell you, you're safe tonight. That devil can't get you. The hands of hell can't get you. Sickness can't get you. Let me Oh, come on, somebody. Safe don't have enough to get you. He can only look over. I said, "He can only pierce over, but he can't come in." I said, "Oh, glory to God. Tonight, you can only peek through the door, but you can't come in, devil. I'm in a house of refuge. I'm in a city. I'm in a dwelling place. I'm in a protection." They could not enter into that city. But notice, he said he had to know that he had a need of it. See, you got to know that you have a need of that city. &gt;&gt; If you lolly guy around, pursuer is going to get you. &gt;&gt; Or he says, you must want to stay there. No complaining. &gt;&gt; I'm sure as a pastor, you never hear that, do you? &gt;&gt; No complaining, pastors. &gt;&gt; No complaining. See, brother B tell us he says now he must want to stay there. No complaining. Walk around say oh why did I ever come in here? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why did I ever show up at full gospel lighthouse just Ron Spencer and Andrew Spencer and Matt Spencer. I ain't got no more preachers in the Spencers. &gt;&gt; That's how carnal we get sometimes. Oh, &gt;&gt; you know, I'm just saying what you're thinking. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, that's just the way people does today. They say they want to be free from the cares of the world. Then they get into it amongst the believers. They say, "Oh, I got to give up this and I got to give up that. I got to pay tithe. &gt;&gt; I got to take the makeup off. I got to quit cutting my hair. I got to quit wearing skinny jeans. &gt;&gt; Oh, he says, "But you got to know that you need to stay there. You can't come in that house of refuge and start complaining." He said, "They'll put you out &gt;&gt; and you have to shift again for yourself, but you got to know that you got a need and you want to be there." And brother says, "When I came," he said, "Oh, it's just like heaven to me. When I come to this message, when I come to the gospel, when I gave my heart to God, I'm sitting in heavenly places. Church, let me tell you, I've been serving the Lord for 25, 26 years, and I've never had a desire to go back into the world. I never had a desire to smoke another cigarette, to drink another beer, to go out into a bar, to live a truth to my wife. Why? I found a city. I found a hiding place. I found the word. I found the gospel. I found God and he can change your desires. [Music] &gt;&gt; Says, "My only complaint is I didn't come when I was younger." Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we have a kingdom church that can't be moved. He says each nation is shaken. Skies are trembling. All nature is crying out. The world itself is trembling because it could be blowed to bits. But we have a kingdom that cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; We have a city of refuge. We have a go where the sun will never go down. He said, "Let us come to that rock now." &gt;&gt; See, and inside that tower, I don't have no more desires, even a lookout. &gt;&gt; So, I didn't grow up in a Christian home. I didn't have somebody to model what it meant to be a Christian father, &gt;&gt; to be a husband. &gt;&gt; But when you get that Holy Ghost, Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll mold you. &gt;&gt; It shapes you, brother Chris. It changes you. See, you don't have those desires that you used to have. It was that well, what's the what's the assurance of the Holy Ghost? Speaking in tongues. No, that's not the assurance or the evidence of the Holy Ghost. But the evidence of the Holy Ghost is your life changed. Has your desires been changed? Are you still wanting to peek outside that seat and go run around do the same things you used to do? You don't have it. &gt;&gt; But if you come into that hiding place, &gt;&gt; where the things of the world are are sealed out and you're sealed in is you and God and you and God and there's a flowing from the presence of the almighty God. And he comes in and he visits you and you weep and you cry and you're in his presence. That's the assurance. Notice in this hiding place if you get sick there's healing &gt;&gt; maybe you get weary brother says cast your cares upon him &gt;&gt; because he cares for you see now think about Martha and Mary here their brother was four days dead skin worms begin to crawl through his body and no doubt he be to rotten and decay but when Martha came to him even now Lord Lord, &gt;&gt; whatever you ask God, &gt;&gt; whatever you ask God, I know he'll do it. &gt;&gt; Well, I know my brother will rise in the resurrection. He said, I am the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I am to life. Whatever you ask God. And church, sometimes it's time for you to start asking God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Put it all on the ministry. It's not all on the ministry. It's on what you have need of tonight. So, thou art my hiding place. We're going to kind of turn it here. I got about 30 minutes. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Notice David here in Psalms 32. He says, "Thou art my." So, he makes a personal claim on it. Thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to put it on somebody else. We want to put it on mom or dad or deacon or preacher and you know camp meetings and things of that nature. But David is crying out thou God, you're mine. &gt;&gt; You're mine. Let me tell you church, it's got to be personal. It's got to be a relationship, not an exercise. &gt;&gt; Got to have a relationship with him, not just an exercise. And we find here that the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 4:7 that we're we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellent of the power of God be of God and not of us. We're troubled on every side, yet we're not distressed. We're perplexed, but we're not in despair. We're persecuted, but we're not forsaken. We're cast down, but we're not destroyed. Notice though we're troubled, church, and we're troubled on every side. We have a protection. We're we're not distressed. Though we're perplexed and we don't know which way to go, we're still not in despair. Though we feel the persecutions of the enemy, Jesus says, "I've not forsaken you. I'll not abandon you." Even when we've been cast down and and and and destroyed by the enemy, he says we're not destroyed, church. Let me tell you, no matter what befalls us, Jesus is our shield. He is our buckler. He is our high tower. He is our strong tower. He is our hiding place. And we as a believer, we can sing songs of triumph no matter where we find oursel. If we're in a prison cell like Paul and Silas, we can begin to worship God and the prison cells can fall open. Why? Because we have the assurance tonight. &gt;&gt; We have the assurance that nothing can destroy us. Notice Paul and Silas didn't let their troubles dictate their worship. [Music] &gt;&gt; Their prison walls didn't hinder their praise. &gt;&gt; They wasn't overcome by sorrows, depression, and questioning why me? What did I do to deserve this? They didn't allow their circumstances to rob them of an opportunity &gt;&gt; for a good church service. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, in the midst of their trials, how many of you in a trial, in the midst of their trial, &gt;&gt; they begin to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what true worship is? &gt;&gt; It's a sacrifice. when you don't feel it, &gt;&gt; when you don't even want to be here, when you drug yourself, but when you got here, you make a sacrifice &gt;&gt; and you just start worshiping. Well, it may be routine. Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, but all of a sudden, &gt;&gt; all of a sudden, the rhythm of the music changes. &gt;&gt; The rhythm changes. The beat drops. Oo. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Like that song that was sung, don't forget where we're going. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't forget where we're going, man. Something begins to change the atmosphere &gt;&gt; where you was all crabby spirit walking in. Now you just start tapping that foot a little bit. &gt;&gt; That hand, you don't have to push it up. It just goes up. &gt;&gt; See what happens. Stuff then begins to change cuz the rhythm of the music begins to change because the Holy Ghost begins to move through the aisles, begins to move through the pews because God knows what you have need of. And he's coming to you tonight for your need. And the Bible says the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. He said he will shall preserve thy going in and thy going out. I'm here to tell you full gospel lighthouse. The devil has nothing against you tonight because you got a word that's already been spoke over you. God's going to bless your coming in. God's going to bless your going out. We are the head and not the tail. We are going up and not down. We are the prize. We are the elect lady. We are the predestinated sons and daughters of God. And we have found a refuge. &gt;&gt; Psalms 27. We're very familiar with this. I'm not going to hold you much longer. We're going to parachute out of here shortly. Psalms 27:1. The Lord. Oh, he's my gloom. &gt;&gt; No, the Bible says, "The Lord is my light. &gt;&gt; He's my illumination. He's my joy and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Don't let this be David's cry. Let it be your cry. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light. My illumination, my joy. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all need to tell your face. &gt;&gt; I got the joy, joy, joy down in my heart. Down in my heart. See, the Lord is my illumination, my joy, my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength, safety, protection, refuge, stronghold &gt;&gt; of my life. Whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat of my flesh. They stumbled &gt;&gt; and they fell. Though a hoe shall encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war shall rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. That's all you need tonight. &gt;&gt; One thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in habit that I may notice abide in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble, &gt;&gt; he didn't say in the good times. He didn't say when you're on a mountaintop. He said in a time of trouble. Let me take that's this day. That's this time. And we are sons and daughters of God. We are in a troubled condition. But in the time of trouble, he shall hide me. &gt;&gt; He shall protect me. He shall shield me. He shall put me in a secret place. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me, and he shall set me upon a rock. &gt;&gt; In a time of trouble, unpleasant, giving of pain, unhappiness, misery, he shall hide me. He shall cover me over. See, notice he's going to cover me over, brother Ron, in his pavilion. That's his chamber. Give reference to a bed chamber. &gt;&gt; Not the kitchen, &gt;&gt; not the living room, but that bed chamber &gt;&gt; where it's a relationship, intimacy, where he whispers secrets to his wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice now then he says in the secret of his tabernacle, his hiding place and he going to set me upon a rock &gt;&gt; a revelation. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon, we understand that he would take this passage and he would begin to preach the rapture message. And what was he showing to the believer? That if you get this revelation, &gt;&gt; you get the revelation of who you are. Let me tell you, young person, mom, dad, oh, blind, crazy, if you're here tonight, the greatest revelation that you can get is that you are a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to know the mysteries. That's the greatest one. I want to know the opening of the seals. I want to know all that. Those are great things. &gt;&gt; But you got to understand who you are. And in the time of trouble, in the time when things ain't going your way, you got to know that you got a revelation that I come from God. I'm going back to God. No matter what I face on this side, hell don't have enough. The devil don't have enough. I am going to make it because why? Because he's already saw me. I got a revelation. I've been planted on a rock. I go into a secret place, a pavilion, a tabernacle in the presence of Almighty God. And can't no devil, can't no cancer, can't no sickness keep me from my hiding place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. That's where we're going. A revelation. What is the new birth? It's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. Not that you join the church. Let me tell you, join Full Gospel Lighthouse. Join Evening of Light Tabernacle. Pick your choice. We got 35 of them around the message. There's a bunch of them. It It's not that. Notice the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. &gt;&gt; Not you join the church. &gt;&gt; Not that you shook hands. You done something different. You said a creed. You promise to live by a code of rules. But Christ, the Bible, he is the word that is revealed to you. No matter what anybody else says, what takes place, it's Christ, pastor, priest, whatever it might be, it's Christ in you. That is a revelation that the church is built upon. &gt;&gt; See, the true revelation of Jesus Christ, when you got that in your heart, nothing will keep you from a rapture &gt;&gt; because you are the rapture. See what a hiding place when fear comes, when depression comes, when anxieties comes, when guilt shows itself, when past mistakes and memories flare up, when war rises against you. One thing, I'm hidden in God through Christ. &gt;&gt; I found an abiding place, a hiding place. And brother Bram said, "Now the message calls the bride together." See, it's the message. That's what our hiding place is. And I'm going to turn a corner quickly and we're going to bring this to a close. But he says, "Notice the hiding place." He would tell us standing there married to the virtuous son of God. Never sinned in the first place. She was for ordained. She was trapped into it. And now when she heard the truth come forth, the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuous. No sin at all on her. Why? Therefore, the message calls the bride together. See the shout. And so God sent a message to call you out of the world, &gt;&gt; call you out of sin, call you out of unbelief, call you to a secret place, a hiding place to set you behind the protection of his word. And then Jehovah Gyra number three, he said they marched out, talking of Israel, they marched out of Egypt on the strength of the testimony and the prophet with the pillar of fire over them because he was sent. Notice now and God proved that he was with them. They marched out on the testimony of a prophet. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to go somewhere. But that same group that marched out, only two marched in. They marched out. Two million strong marched out under the testimony of God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But only two. &gt;&gt; Come on. Only two went in. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let me just preach this for a minute now. He says, "Now Moses called a nation out of a nation. The Holy Spirit is calling a bride out of a church. A church out of a church. Members from every denomination making up the bride." Here he said the bride coming out. That's the one, the bride rather. She's the one that's going to be in the rapture. That alone nothing but the bride, the elected one fornown of God from the beginning. The father's spiritual gene. And he's calling out an end time bride. He called you from dark denominationalism. He called some of you out of the Amish life, out of the Menite life, some of you out of the bars, some of you out of the prostitute life. He called you what? He didn't just call you out, but he called you out to take you somewhere. &gt;&gt; We called out on this hour. God's got a desire to take you. Oh, hallelujah, somebody. He's got a desire to take you to the land. &gt;&gt; He said the three stages of the journey. They left Egypt under justification. Believe in the word. They separated themselves from the Egyptians and come out. They crossed the Red Sea, killed the things that were behind them, which was sanctification through the blood that kills all all human desires of evil. The second stage of the journey. But the third stage was when they crossed into Jordan into the promised land where their inheritance laid. See, their inheritance never laid in Egypt. So don't be content, church, with just coming out. Well, I believe God sent a prophet. There's more to it than that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, I've been through the Red Sea. I'm living a sanctified life. There's more to this message than that. Come on. &gt;&gt; See the third stage, brother Ron. The there's a land promise to the end time believer. &gt;&gt; There is a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the end time believer. Brother talked here in paradise. He said it was about 3:00 in the morning, I suppose, and I I'd got up and I looked where and in front of me I was it was coming down to Jordan. And I looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine. And I was coming down to Jordan. It seemed like I could hear the song, I'm coming down to Jordan. Someone was singing it. And as I drew near near the river, I looked back and I seen which way had come. And I was twothird of the way to Jordan. When I looked across Jordan, I said, "Oh, praise God. Just on the other side is where all the promises lay. Every promise lays in the promised land." Notice the prophet of God. He come two pulls of the journey. &gt;&gt; He come through the first pull sign in the hand. He come through the second pool of discernment. But the third pull. &gt;&gt; The third pull was the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; The third pull was just speaking squirrels into existence. It was coming into the opening of the word which is the believer's hiding place. This word is our protection. God fortified us behind the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; But notice they come out on the testimony of a prophet. They come out with a message of a vindicated leader. In Deuteronomy 2 that says, "Then we turn, Moses talking. We took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me and we compass Mount Zir many days. And the Lord spake unto me saying, you have compassed this mountain long enough. Turn northward." Some of you full gospel, you got great ministry, you got great leaders. Some of you young people, you've been to great camps. For some of us, all we've done is gone around and around and around. God sent a prophet. I'm a message believer and that's all we know about it. God sent a prophet. I've repented. I'm justified. Let me tell you, there's more to this message. &gt;&gt; There's more than just God sending a prophet. There's more than just I'm a message believer. There's more than all that, church. There is a land. &gt;&gt; All the promises lay in the land. &gt;&gt; Can I go just a few more minutes? Amen. &gt;&gt; See, Israel, they came twothirds of the journey &gt;&gt; under a vindicated voice. &gt;&gt; And I hope this don't sound bad, but I'm trying to show you the parallel. And though they were following Moses's message, they never entered into the land of promise. &gt;&gt; And we find here in Deuteronomy 2 and verse 13, he says, "Now rise up, said I, and get you over to the brook of Zared." And we went over to the brook of Zered in a space in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we come to the brook of Zer was 38 years until all the generation of men of war were wasted out from among the host as the Lord swearing to him. So Kades they come to Aadesh Barnea and that word there means judgment seed of God. &gt;&gt; And Kades Barnea was three days journey. Brother Ron, they could look up and they could see the promised land, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't go in. &gt;&gt; They heard the stories of how it took two men to carry a cluster of grace back, but they couldn't partake of it. They've heard of the stories of how it was a land that flowed with milk and honey, but they never could set any claims in it. For 38 years, they were on the outskirts &gt;&gt; streaming. Woo! Look at full gospel lighthouse, man. They had a meeting on September and Labor Day. My the power of God flow. Some of them just streaming in, just looking in. &gt;&gt; And here they just, you know, they're just keeping us preaching the same old doctrines of repentance. God sent a prophet. We're believers. All you got to do is wear that eagle belt buckle. You're sure to get in. Put that little trinket on the door. The blood's been applied. You're sure to make it. Hopeless to tape on that certain certain time. You're sure to be a real bonafide believer. Let me tell you, that has nothing to do with this message. This message is Jesus Christ dwelling on the inside of a believer. That's your hiding place. That's your refuge. It ain't some relic. It ain't some trinket. It's God Almighty dwelling in lives of men and women, church. But 38 years they looked over. I wonder I wonder what it's like in that land. Man, we've seen all that emotion over there. Boy, they got excited, &gt;&gt; man. They spoke in tongues and they fell out and they were spoken tongues all night. kept waking up and going back to sleep speaking in tongues. Man, it's a good land, church. &gt;&gt; It's a land that flows with milk and honey. &gt;&gt; See, and brother M said, he wants to give us the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; more than we even want to receive it. &gt;&gt; He wants you to enter in to that third pull. He wants you to enter into that opening of the word where all the promises, healing, deliverance, supernatural, all that you have need of is in that land. But you got to make a decision. See, God's promise did not lie in the wilderness. He called you out to take you somewhere. God sent us a vindicated messenger and we have left on the testimony of William Brandham. He had a visitation from the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We've come out. But see, Moses couldn't take them in. But God had a Joshua there ready to take him in. And under the same message, Joshua preached the same message that Moses preached &gt;&gt; and entered into that land. &gt;&gt; And can I tell you, the same message that William Brand was preaching, we're preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same message that Paul preached, we're preaching. &gt;&gt; And that's where we're headed, church. We're going into the land. He says, "Now in my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. But I go to prepare you a place that if I go to prepare you a place, I will come again. I receive you unto myself that where I am, there you may be also. &gt;&gt; So we've not come as I begin to close, musicians can make your way back. We've not come to talk about the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, on certain certain page and certain certain book and a certain certain certain and a certain certain certain look, this ain't old McDonald had a farm. &gt;&gt; Come on. We have not come to talk about the messes. &gt;&gt; We have done that for years. &gt;&gt; We talked about it. Favorite quotes. Oh, this is my favorite quote. This is this, this is this favorite tape, favorite this, favorite that. We've talked about it. He says, "We've not come to talk about the message. We come together to get in the message." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and the message is Christ. That's right. &gt;&gt; So many times we mistake and and I'm sorry, but when I first came to this message, we mistake the message as William Brand. William Brandom's not the message. &gt;&gt; He was only the voice that the angel used. &gt;&gt; He was only the vessel. And I had a quote in here and and I I don't have time to try to find it, but here we find in the time of trouble, he's going to hide us, church. lay us back in that pavilion there in that secret place. And the believer is fortified behind the word. And we find it in Psalm or Isaiah 32. He said, "A man shall be a hiding place from the wind, a covert from the tempest, rivers of waters in a dry land, and a shadow as a great rock in a weary land." So he's prophesying, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Isaiah's prophesying there's going to be a king come. Not just a king, but the king of kings. And he's going to come. He's going to be the Messiah. He's going to reign in righteousness. And this man, the man Christ Jesus, he's going to be a hiding place from the wind, a covert from the tempest. He's going to endure all the full force of the storm that's that's that we've faced, church. And he's going to be a shelter. And people today, we got people that are prepping and they're they got bomb shelters and this shelter and that shelter. And the prophet of God said, "Look, they got bombs. They blow 150 ft deep. &gt;&gt; There's no shelter out there that you can run to. The only shelter that we have is the shelter of his wings today. And he said Jesus Christ is that shelter. He's that hiding place. Let me tell you, that's what I'm trying to point you to tonight. It ain't to a man. It ain't to a gift. It ain't to a church, but it's to Jesus Christ. He is the word made flesh in this hour. &gt;&gt; He is your hiding place. So no matter what you face, &gt;&gt; no matter what you go through, you're protected. &gt;&gt; You're protected. You're safe. And death can't even touch you inside of that hiding place. When we walk in the presence of God, notice the things of the world are hidden behind us. Brother Chris, when when the high priest will enter into the Holy of Holies, had a pomegranate and a bell tied to his foot. &gt;&gt; He had to be dressed right. &gt;&gt; He had to talk right and he had to be anointed right. &gt;&gt; And when he would go in, brother Ron, that palm of Granland bell would begin to sing, "Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. Holy, holy, holy until see that was the only way they knew that he was alive. &gt;&gt; And can I tell you when you walk in this house, when you walk into the presence of God, your life should be cried holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. That's the only way we as ministry, we know that you're alive. When your life is cried holy to God, no matter how you feel, it's holy to the Lord. No matter what you've been through, it's holy to the Lord. No matter the sickness, no matter the affliction, no matter the trial, your life is crying holy, holy to the Lord. See, he wasn't on the outskirts anymore. He come in and enter into the presence of shakina glory and the badger skin dropped behind him. And brother Ram said, "Now everything was silent. All the cares of the world are put on the outside. He found a hiding place. See, it's always been that way. Not the first court, not the second court, but the third court, the third stage of the journey, church. In there is where we have our protection. In there is where we find comfort and peace. [Music] As I begin to close here, 32 and verse 28, Psalms 32 and verse 28 says, "And I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go, and I will guide thee with my eye." [Music] &gt;&gt; What is the eye of the Lord? A prophet, a seer. I'm going to guide you with my prophet, with my prophetic eye. I'm going to send you a a man of God, and he's going to lead you, and he's going to he's going to open up the revelation of that sealed book. We're going to can maybe get into that tomorrow. He's going to open up the revelation that you can see this is who you are. This is where you come from. This is your protection. But he said God's guiding eye. and he would send a prophet and he would guide his people. That's why he sent Moses to guide them out of Egypt and to take them into the promised land. And he sent you a prophet to guide you out of your Egypt, to guide you out of that denomination, to guide you out of that life of sin and to bring you into the promised land of the opening of the word. Oh, hallelujah, church. That's where he's guiding us. That's our hiding place in this hour. God sent a seer. He sent a prophet. And brother Brandham taught us that a prophet is not only just a mouthpiece of God. He's God's channel, God's eye to the people. Because a prophet is a seer. He can see what we can't see. He can go up into heights that we can't climb into. And he expressed that a prophet functions as God's eyes on the earth to reveal his will and guide his people. God's eye is on his elect leading them to the land of promise. God's eye today is leading the elect, the predestinated bride to her hiding place. And he would say this in God's eye, God's eye reflects his will. And brother Mark, that word will there means purpose. God's eye reflects his purpose. Why a message? Why a prophet to call you out, but not just to let you wander? He's taken you somewhere. No matter where David found himself, thou art my hiding place. No matter where you find yourself tonight, church, Christ, the word is our refuge. The revealed word for this age is Jesus Christ. And just as Israel had blood on the doorpost of Egypt, believers today must have the spirit applied to their lives. That's the protection against judgment. Brother man would teach us, he understood that spiritually through revelation, that the strong tower is where the bride hides. We have no other refuge. Brother Ron, but this message, see the message movement is not our hiding place. The name William Miam Brandom, and please forgive me for saying this, but that's not our hiding place. The message is Christ and he is the word and the word is your hiding place. Good days or bad days, you found a secret place. An angel. You show me today where he stood. If you trust me, he's never backed off of that promise that he gave you five years ago. If you trust me, I'll use you like never before. Can I tell you church, they may have not entered into the land, but the promise remains. They may have failed to enter into their land and they went around the the mountain for 38 years, but the promise remains for you today. Some of these old fighters out there, all they can preach is God sent a prophet. But let me tell you, there's more for you today, church. There's more. God's guiding eye is leading us into the land, a land of safety, a land of rest. God is here tonight to not only heal you, not only deliver you, but he's here to give you the Holy Ghost. He's going to take some of you. You've been going around that depression. You've been going around with fear. You've been going around with anxiety. You've been coming in, going out, coming in, going out. But I'm here to tell you today, it's time to come inside of Christ. It's time to get the Holy Ghost. It's time for a move of the spirit. It's time to let the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost tonight. It's time to let go and let God fill this place. Would you say amen to that? Would you stand and say, "God, fill this place. God, come today. Lord, take me to that hiding place. Take me, Lord, into that hiding place." And if you're here today, you've never entered in. He's here for you. He's here for you. You got a need today, I serve a great God. I was preaching in Mexico last week and a pastor's wife come up on Friday night, brother Ron, and she said, "Brother Joe, as you was preaching, the Lord healed me in my seat." And that's through a language barrier. And if God can do that through a language barrier, what can God do for you tonight? What can God do for Full Gospel Lighthouse? Let don't leave out of here and let this just be another service. God has put a message on my heart. Thou art my hiding place. And some of you, you need to come tonight and find refuge and find protection and find safety and find the Holy Ghost. Some of you young people been battling. Do I have it? Do I have it? Do I have it? Is it for me? One day you're up, the next day you're down. One day you're up, the next day you're down. One day you got it, the next day you don't. It's a secure place. Today, tonight, you can know that you know that you know that you know. You don't have to go out of here to save. Brother said, "The angel of the Lord accompanies the message." I have preached to you the message. And I'm going to tell you, he's here. Said, "Brother Joe, do you see him?" No, I don't have to see him. He honors his word. And if I can get you to believe this evening, if I can get you to turn away from your doubts, turn away from your unbelief, turn away from everything you've been running to and run to him tonight. Let me tell you, church, the altar is open. You need healing for your body, the altar's open tonight. You need deliverance, you've been in a battle, the altar is open tonight. You need the Holy Ghost, he's here. Won't you come, Brother Andrew? the deep. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelu. [Music] The cloud by day is a sign that you are with me.
