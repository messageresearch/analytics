[1:02] Christians we we have trials we have
[1:05] things that we go through but every day
[1:08] is a good day
[1:10] every day is a good day because all
[1:15] things are working out just the way he
[1:19] intended it to work it may have been a
[1:22] speed bump that kind of hit us out of
[1:25] just maybe maybe we didn't see coming he
[1:29] did and the world can't say that
[1:32] everything is working out for their good
[1:34] but us as Christians can say all things
[1:37] work together for the good to them that
[1:40] love God all things no matter what comes
[1:45] no matter the mountains no matter the
[1:47] valleys all things I'd say sister Carol

[6:01] careful to serve you and give you all
[6:04] the glory and the honor in Jesus name
[6:07] Amen if you have your Bibles we'll turn
[6:11] with me to the book of Romans chapter
[6:13] one and Mark chapter eight verse 34
[6:18] Romans chapter one in verse 16 and Mark
[6:22] chapter 8 and verse 34 I'd like to speak
[6:25] to you tonight on the thought of never
[6:28] ashamed and we we spoke to you on a
[6:32] couple of weeks ago but without and told
[6:37] me that's how you preach the lights out
[6:38] right there when we pray we preach the
[6:42] power went out and I'll tell you what if
[6:44] if if the power goes out tonight while
[6:46] I'm preaching this service I just say
[6:47] that the devil just don't like me
[6:49] preaching this thought so
[6:53] I don't come too far to go back now so
[6:57] so we'd like to buy the help the Lord
[7:00] speak to you on this thought of never
[7:02] ashamed and as you're reading there in
[7:04] Romans chapter 1 and 16 you remember
[7:08] that Paul here is addressing the Roman
[7:10] Church there at the time and this is the
[7:14] same Paul that if you would read over in
[7:17] the book of Acts you will see this Paul
[7:19] as he is tormenting the church of the
[7:22] day he is known as a destroyer of the
[7:25] church one that once stood against the
[7:27] gospel of Jesus Christ and he took
[7:30] pleasure in seeing out his duties as a
[7:34] priest there as a as the religions of
[7:38] his sect there he took he took pleasure
[7:40] and in carrying out these duties but
[7:44] when he met the pillar of fire in Acts
[7:46] chapter 9 you will see a totally
[7:49] different man that God would change his
[7:52] name from Saul to Paul and then you'll
[7:56] see here in Romans chapter 1 in 16 that
[7:59] Paul says that I am not ashamed of the
[8:03] gospel of Christ for it is the power of
[8:05] God unto salvation to every one that
[8:08] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[8:11] the Greek here is a man as we've just
[8:14] read this a man where we look in one
[8:17] part of life where he is he is so
[8:20] against the church he's so against the
[8:23] everything that Jesus stands for but now
[8:25] he is embodying everything that Christ
[8:28] is and he says I am not ashamed of the
[8:32] gospel mark chapter 8 and verse 34 and
[8:36] when he had called the people unto
[8:39] himself unto him when with his disciples
[8:43] also he said unto them whosoever will
[8:46] come after me let him deny himself and
[8:49] take up his cross and follow me for
[8:51] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[8:55] it but whosoever shall lose his life for
[8:57] my sake and the Gospels the same shall
[9:01] save it for what shall it profit a man
[9:04] if he shall gain the whole world and
[9:07] lose his own soul or what shall a man
[9:09] give in exchange for his soul and
[9:12] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[9:14] me and of my words in this adulterous
[9:17] and sinful generation of whom of him
[9:20] also shall the Son of Man be ashamed
[9:23] when he cometh in the glory of his
[9:26] father with the Holy Angels may God
[9:29] bless His Word he may be seated in the
[9:31] presence of the Lord never ashamed
[9:42] there's a lot of things there's a lot of
[9:46] things in life that we could say about
[9:48] our own walk or our own things their own
[9:50] our own life that we could say that
[9:52] we're ashamed about but I could never
[9:55] identify myself as those that are
[9:57] ashamed of Christ
[9:58] I see the works of a Living God as he's
[10:03] worked out things in your life how that
[10:07] he would come by and change or change
[10:09] your walk and change your life
[10:11] completely transforming you by the power
[10:14] of his word I could never be ashamed of
[10:18] that but today we find that it's a very
[10:22] popular thing to say that that that we
[10:26] are or people say that they're oh
[10:29] they're not ashamed to say that they're
[10:30] a part of a certain denomination they're
[10:33] not ashamed they're not ashamed of that
[10:35] they're that it's more popular to say
[10:37] that they're part of a denomination more
[10:40] than they are a Christian you'll hear
[10:43] people say that if you ask them if
[10:45] they're a Christian they'll say that
[10:46] they're a part of this denomination I
[10:48] I've seen that I've seen a lady a while
[10:51] back at a restaurant and I seen she was
[10:53] wearing a skirt and I I did I did as the
[10:56] Prophet had done many times it said he
[10:59] walked up to him and he asked him if
[11:01] they were Christians and they'll say
[11:03] their denomination so I walked up to
[11:05] this sister and I said now I said I see
[11:07] you wearing skirts are you a believer
[11:08] she said well I go to the I go to the
[11:11] Church of Christ and that was her
[11:13] immediate response is that she was
[11:15] identified with the Church of Christ
[11:18] oh wow that's pretty amazing that the
[11:19] Church of Christ preaches holiness even
[11:21] now but but but here her first words was
[11:24] identifying herself with a denomination
[11:27] you see you'll find that it's very
[11:29] popular today that man wants to be
[11:32] identified with the fatherhood of a
[11:35] church more than being a follower of
[11:37] God's Word
[11:38] they they're ashamed to stand with
[11:41] Christ upon his word and so they take an
[11:45] easy road out of just proclaiming their
[11:49] denomination or their Creed instead of
[11:51] coming out and standing on Christ word
[11:54] in which we know that heaven and earth
[11:56] will pass away but this word will never
[11:59] pass away I recognize the night that
[12:02] this building that we're in if time
[12:03] should last that this building is going
[12:05] to pass away I recognize that this
[12:08] vessel that I'm living in is a life is
[12:11] but a vapor but I realized that this
[12:13] life can pass away but there's something
[12:16] packed on the inside of me that can
[12:18] never pass away it's eternal just as God
[12:21] is eternal and I never want to say that
[12:27] I've taken an easy road out by just
[12:29] attaching myself to a a man's thinking
[12:32] but attaching myself and becoming
[12:35] identified with the Word of God is our
[12:37] ambitions as Christians to seek him out
[12:41] to find what he says about me and you to
[12:43] find what he's doing in this hour and
[12:46] doing in this life that's what our key
[12:48] is as Christians is to find out what he
[12:51] said about you and I it's important as
[12:54] Christians to know who Jesus is it's
[12:57] important as Christians to know what
[12:59] Jesus done but what about you today
[13:01] what about in your walk what about in
[13:04] your life what are you doing
[13:08] are you living out this gospel now jesus
[13:13] said now if you are ashamed of me then
[13:15] I'll be ashamed of you why would he be
[13:18] ashamed of you because you're claiming
[13:20] to be his when you won't follow him what
[13:22] if I said this little boy he's my son he
[13:26] turned around and say who me be your son
[13:28] what do you think I am
[13:30] it would embarrass me it would embarrass
[13:33] me if regular alley and I would say
[13:36] that's my daughter and they turn around
[13:37] and they saw me be your daughter it
[13:40] would sure embarrass me if they would
[13:43] say those things maybe your daughter
[13:45] it would sure embarrass me but how
[13:48] embarrassing it is for Christ how that
[13:51] he would say that I'm ashamed of you
[13:53] when men say that they are Christians
[13:55] but do not follow one word of his
[13:58] teachings you see they want to be
[14:01] identified with something and still
[14:03] christianity is still the most popular
[14:05] Christian religion or the most popular
[14:08] religion in the world they say by
[14:10] statistics that Christianity in the
[14:13] world is over 33 percent of the world of
[14:15] religions and its field of the rest of
[14:18] mullah Muslim and and Islam and atheists
[14:21] and agnostics they fill up the rest of
[14:23] the part that they've they come up with
[14:25] but yet in that Christianity in that 33
[14:28] percent you can maybe find maybe one
[14:31] percent that is completely full of the
[14:35] Holy Ghost I hope that doesn't stand are
[14:38] you tonight but to be filled with the
[14:41] Holy Ghost the life of this word is what
[14:44] it's about now Jesus said in Luke
[14:49] chapter twelve and eight also I say unto
[14:52] you that whosoever shall confess me
[14:54] before men him shall the son of man
[14:57] confessed before the angels of God but
[15:00] he that denies me before men shall be
[15:02] denied before the angels of God and
[15:05] whosoever shall speak a word against the
[15:07] Son of man it shall be forgiven him but
[15:10] unto him that blasphemy that gets the
[15:12] Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven and
[15:15] when they bring unto the synagogues and
[15:18] under the magistrates and powers
[15:20] hey keno thora or how or what thing you
[15:23] shall answer but what ye shall say for
[15:26] the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that
[15:28] same hour what you ought to say now
[15:32] Webster gives us this the definition of
[15:35] ashamed as we read last time embarrassed
[15:38] or guilty because of one actions or
[15:41] characteristics or associations
[15:43] reluctant to do something through fear
[15:46] of embarrassment or humiliation and you
[15:49] find that often times that when men are
[15:52] reluctant to move forward in the
[15:54] Christian walk it's because that they
[15:57] are ashamed of where they are in their
[15:59] walk they're ashamed of where they are
[16:02] they're ashamed of the life that they're
[16:03] living or they're ashamed of the process
[16:06] that they'll have to go through to take
[16:08] that leap of faith and step out and walk
[16:10] and live for Jesus and to proclaim the
[16:13] name of Jesus they're ashamed of that
[16:15] leap of faith that they'll have to take
[16:18] they're ashamed of it but I want to tell
[16:21] you tonight that that if you make the
[16:23] first step if that's you tonight if you
[16:25] make the first step I promise you that
[16:27] Jesus will make the next maybe you're
[16:31] ashamed maybe you don't know what to say
[16:33] but the Bible said in that self same
[16:36] hour the Holy Ghost will give you that
[16:38] word to say is it alright if I just
[16:45] preach to you just a little bit tonight
[16:48] you know if you would look at anybody
[16:51] any man of God's life tonight if you
[16:53] look at it if you look at brother
[16:54] Branham look at mine look at Billy Ron
[16:56] or looking brother Homer if you would
[16:58] look at any man of God's life I'm sure
[17:00] that you will find that there are
[17:03] mistakes in that person's life you'll
[17:05] find out real quick that that men are
[17:07] men you can look down through my family
[17:09] history and even look through brother
[17:11] branham's life and you can find mistakes
[17:13] there that's the thing to me that what
[17:17] makes this message so real is that
[17:19] brother Branham was a man
[17:21] and he was not ashamed to tell that he
[17:25] was a man he was not pointing us to
[17:27] himself he was pointing us to Christ but
[17:30] you can look at brother Brennan's
[17:32] history look at his life you can look at
[17:34] his own humanity you'll see mistakes
[17:36] there you'll find failure saying you
[17:39] look at my life you or somebody else's
[17:41] life a man of God's life you may have
[17:43] found spots in that person's life where
[17:45] they may arrived or they may have
[17:46] cheated her or they may allowed or may
[17:48] have failed or maybe let somebody down
[17:50] you know there's actually people that
[17:53] have searched out about the ministry and
[17:56] tried to find things found out dirt on
[17:58] the ministry about myself brother on
[18:01] brother Donnie Regan brother Tim Pruett
[18:03] doing background checks trying to find
[18:06] faults in our own ministry or in our own
[18:09] lives trying to put a trying to put a
[18:12] pinpoint on us and say that we got
[18:14] faults well I'll be the first to tell
[18:16] you tonight you ain't got to look very
[18:18] far and you'll find faults in me you'll
[18:22] find where there was mistakes you'll
[18:24] find where I got angry you'll find more
[18:26] maybe I'll let my temper go there's
[18:28] probably some times in my life where I
[18:30] look more like Jesus cast and the money
[18:32] changers out the temple more than I look
[18:34] like Jesus dedicating babies but I'm not
[18:37] ashamed to tell you that I am a man I
[18:40] know I've let some of you down just now
[18:43] because I know that some of you think
[18:45] I'm a an angel or more than that but I
[18:47] want you to assure you tonight that I'm
[18:50] a man and you ain't gotta look very far
[18:53] in my past to find that I'm a man you
[18:56] can find faults and you can find
[18:58] mistakes but let me point you to
[19:00] somebody
[19:01] that ain't got one fault they got one
[19:04] blemish they got one mistake he never
[19:08] lied he never stole the only time he
[19:13] ever cheated is when he cheated death
[19:18] that's the kind of God that I can point
[19:20] you to tonight
[19:21] I know Kingdom builders want to point
[19:23] you to themself and try to boost up
[19:26] their self and build up their self
[19:29] I'm not trying to point you to myself or
[19:31] point you to a man but point you to
[19:33] Christ tonight I can be ashamed of
[19:37] myself sore there's a lot of things in
[19:40] my life that I'm ashamed of or I'm
[19:42] embarrassed stuff where am i reluctant
[19:44] to tell you about but there's not one
[19:46] thing that I'm ashamed to tell you about
[19:50] in Christ's life I can take you through
[19:54] the Scriptures and I can tell you about
[19:56] a God that saves I can take you through
[19:58] the Scriptures and tell you about a God
[20:01] that delivers I can take you through the
[20:03] Scriptures and tell you about a God that
[20:05] raises the dead I can take you through
[20:08] the scriptures and tell you about a God
[20:10] that still cares I'm not ashamed to
[20:13] testify that God still the same
[20:16] yesterday today and forever and it
[20:21] should not embarrass you or make you a
[20:23] saint to testify that God still God are
[20:30] you with me this evening and the message
[20:35] was saying the Prophet said I think of
[20:36] the prophets of old when they come with
[20:38] that message and it embarrass the kings
[20:40] that have made the people feel
[20:41] uncomfortable the priests even they
[20:44] would feel uncomfortable because they
[20:46] were supposed to be leaders religious
[20:48] man when the word came forth in that
[20:51] manner it exposed them and they felt
[20:54] embarrassed or ashamed you know that's
[20:57] what the word does when it comes it
[21:01] comes and it cuts our hearts he cuts our
[21:03] life you know I've I've never preached a
[21:07] sermon where God didn't come and touch
[21:10] me while I was preaching it where God
[21:12] didn't do something to cut something off
[21:14] of my life
[21:15] but I find that where I found where I
[21:18] needed what I was preaching and I'll say
[21:22] this for you if you'd be honest tonight
[21:24] that you'd say that in that that there
[21:27] has never been one service come by your
[21:29] way that the Word of God didn't cut you
[21:32] cut things off of your life
[21:40] we look over in the Bible and Luke
[21:43] chapter 7 you look there and you'll find
[21:46] of a description that we're very
[21:48] familiar with where Jesus is invited to
[21:52] say Simon the Pharisees house and you
[21:56] find in that scripture that there is a
[21:58] woman of ill-fame there that comes into
[22:02] the picture when she spotted Jesus
[22:05] setting over in the corner being the
[22:08] outcast in that party and this catches
[22:14] her attention you see in the Eastern
[22:21] countries when they would invite you to
[22:23] a party they would welcome you to that
[22:26] household they would welcome you in
[22:29] through the doors and there would be a
[22:31] foot wash lookie there that would wash
[22:34] all the manure and all the stink off of
[22:36] your feet by walking in those streets
[22:39] where the donkeys and the horses and the
[22:41] goats and everything was they would wash
[22:43] your feet and here
[22:46] when Jesus walks into the house of Simon
[22:49] they wash they do not wash his feet they
[22:53] do not give him any anointment oil they
[22:56] do not kiss him you see in eastern
[22:59] countries when they invite you to a
[23:00] party they would kiss you the owner
[23:02] would kiss you on the cheek and he would
[23:05] welcome you into his household you see
[23:08] the kiss was what welcomed you into that
[23:11] household and when the owner of the
[23:13] master kissed you you are welcomed to
[23:16] every spot of the household you are
[23:19] welcomed to the fridge you are welcomed
[23:21] to the ice box you are welcomed to
[23:23] everything in that household the kiss
[23:26] made you a full brother but here this
[23:31] woman of ill-fame sees Jesus sitting in
[23:34] a corner a woman that had a very scarred
[23:38] past a woman that had her life was in
[23:41] disarray a woman that we would say that
[23:44] she if we would ask her
[23:46] from this spot about her history I'd say
[23:50] that she probably a little bit
[23:52] embarrassed about her life by a little
[23:55] bit ashamed of where she'd been but
[23:59] don't ever condemn her you see before
[24:02] there was a fallen woman there was a
[24:04] fallen man that calls that woman to fall
[24:07] you see something for the man whom said
[24:10] he searched that woman's life health and
[24:13] he said I looked at it and he said here
[24:15] she was maybe some sweetheart her
[24:18] sweetheart had crushed her life and sent
[24:22] her on this path how many of you were
[24:27] maybe trodden down and broken and in a
[24:30] spot of despair when Christ came and met
[24:33] you there but he never left you where he
[24:36] failed you but he brought you up out of
[24:39] the miry clay
[24:40] I know sometimes as Christians you get
[24:46] the idea that you're clean and everybody
[24:49] else is dirty but let me tell you this
[24:51] if you walk around the world and you
[24:54] think you're something you're not ever
[24:56] going to win anybody to Christ you up
[25:02] down the road as hell they're not gonna
[25:04] make it
[25:05] I highly doubt you ever win one person
[25:08] to Jesus Christ but I pray as Christians
[25:12] that we would have the attitude what
[25:15] would Jesus do more than a bracelet more
[25:19] than a statement what would Jesus do
[25:27] anything my goodness what a shame for
[25:30] them to leave be living in that kind of
[25:32] condition if it wasn't for grace
[25:35] you'd be right there if it was not for
[25:39] grace I'd have been strung out on charms
[25:42] I'd have been laid out in some gutter
[25:43] somewhere if it was not for grace but
[25:47] grace came running by my way and I'm not
[25:52] ashamed to testify but tell anybody I
[25:55] come in contact with it was grace that
[25:57] put me
[25:58] in my place sure the church world would
[26:06] have never wanted a woman like this in
[26:07] the church but where was she welcome at
[26:11] that Jesus's feet a woman that had done
[26:15] all types of wrong things giving a body
[26:18] out to the men of that city but she
[26:24] recognized about our something in a man
[26:27] sitting in a corner that Simon missed
[26:30] you see Simon all he seen was a man
[26:34] where he could get miracles from Simon
[26:36] one of the miracles but he didn't want
[26:38] the word and that's where you find a lot
[26:42] of people today you even hear TV
[26:44] evangelists or televangelist however
[26:46] he's saying quoting brother Branham
[26:48] speaking brother band's name but all
[26:51] they'll tell you that he went off at the
[26:53] end I'd be ashamed to testify of all the
[26:58] supernatural and not testify of the word
[27:01] that came behind it that's not the word
[27:03] come to the Prophet they say he went off
[27:09] at the end that's when it got to me it
[27:12] was not it was not the first pole they
[27:16] got me it was not the second pole they
[27:18] got me but the opening of the word it
[27:22] was that opening of the word that caught
[27:25] my attention and I'm not ashamed to tell
[27:28] you tonight this was more than a man
[27:31] that caught my attention when the
[27:40] president would come to the city or any
[27:42] city you'd hang out you'd hang see out
[27:45] in the streets full of flies you throw
[27:47] flowers out in the street you'd sing the
[27:50] band down to the depot when he would get
[27:52] off the train and you do everything to
[27:54] make him feel welcome but Jesus can come
[27:57] to your city and into your home and you
[27:59] give him a place in the Attic a little
[28:03] prayer room on the outside out on the
[28:05] side or maybe down in the basement if
[28:08] your company's there you have nothing to
[28:10] do with
[28:10] you'll wait till after a while maybe
[28:13] maybe he set the house
[28:15] and you slip up in the attic and shut
[28:18] the door and say a few words to him and
[28:21] come back down
[28:22] ashamed of it that's the way Solomon was
[28:26] he was ashamed of him he was ashamed to
[28:30] kiss him he was ashamed to make him feel
[28:33] welcome
[28:33] I say folk gospel lighthouse never walk
[28:37] in them doors back there until you make
[28:39] him feel welcome this is not about you
[28:43] this is not about how pretty you can
[28:45] sing this is not about the song leader
[28:47] this is about Jesus and if he don't feel
[28:50] welcome here I'm not welcome here we're
[29:02] seeing that song consume me Lord
[29:05] consume me Lord with the fire of your
[29:07] spirit break me Lord if you have to
[29:10] break me Lord and use the broken pieces
[29:14] of my life I want to be used by you but
[29:16] I really wonder sometimes when you're
[29:18] singing that song is that really what
[29:21] you want is Christ to consume you you
[29:27] know when you're singing that song you
[29:29] could be singing your own testimony
[29:30] right there you could be singing the
[29:32] truth or you could be singing a lot I
[29:35] wonder sometimes do we want him to
[29:38] consume I thinking
[29:39] consume I extra-time consume our
[29:41] energies consume our walk consume my
[29:44] parenting consume my social life and
[29:48] consume our relationships if you
[29:51] answered yes I say you're a Christian if
[29:56] not come to the altar do you really want
[30:01] him in every door of your life I know I
[30:09] do
[30:11] but here this woman here this woman has
[30:15] a wrecked life a wrecked life I'm gonna
[30:22] call your name of you puts her name
[30:24] right there here this man antral had a
[30:29] wrecked life this woman had a wreck life
[30:32] the community knew her the community
[30:35] knew what she had done and the community
[30:39] looked down upon her career and looked
[30:43] down upon everything that she was but
[30:46] now she's in a spot in which the town
[30:50] people think that she's embarrassing
[30:52] herself even more she's down at Jesus's
[30:56] feet crying and weeping and washing his
[31:03] feet with her tears when the random said
[31:11] they would see God not her hair was
[31:14] soaked because she cried so many tears
[31:17] if you would have looked in her eyes her
[31:20] eyes were matted up with all the oil
[31:22] that she had done with all of her life
[31:25] all of her career she spent everything
[31:28] that she had on the most precious oil to
[31:32] pour it on Jesus
[31:33] her eyes were matted up the oil was all
[31:36] over her mouth and all over her face
[31:38] bowing down at his feet washing his feet
[31:45] kissing the manure off of Jesus's feet
[31:51] and the rest of the town was sick in my
[31:55] she's making herself a fool and
[31:58] embarrassing herself she has the lowest
[32:00] life in the city but now here she is
[32:03] even more embarrassing herself kissing
[32:07] the feet of this false prophet called
[32:09] Jesus but Jesus turned to Simon when he
[32:18] perceived their thoughts and said if he
[32:20] really was a prophet he would know what
[32:22] type of
[32:23] this was the scripture says that she
[32:27] came behind him and she was washing his
[32:31] feet and Jesus said Simon I have some
[32:35] what to say unto thee and he begins to
[32:39] give him a parable of which one would
[32:42] love the man that forgave the most which
[32:45] water he said the one that forgave that
[32:49] he that the ruler give forgave the most
[32:51] he said you've rightly judged he said
[32:54] this woman has much seen her alive but
[33:01] this woman is going to walk away here
[33:03] completely debt-free completely sin free
[33:18] nor the church world wouldn't want her
[33:21] in that church but she was welcome at
[33:23] Jesus's feet that's why Jesus said go
[33:28] out into the highways and the hedges and
[33:30] compel them to come Jesus is still
[33:34] calling this message of never being
[33:36] ashamed is about exactly what sister
[33:40] crystal and sister Angela did about
[33:42] testifying of the glass for Jesus Christ
[33:45] for it is the power under salvation and
[33:50] if we're too good to testify about Jesus
[33:53] about what he did for us I'd say we've
[33:58] got ourselves too high we think too much
[34:01] about ourselves I heard brother madam
[34:02] said this week he said when you really
[34:04] think you are something stick your
[34:06] finger in a bucket of water and pull it
[34:08] out and say that's me that's me right
[34:12] there nothing but when she came to Jesus
[34:22] I was looking at this scripture today
[34:27] going over these things she didn't have
[34:31] an inclination what Jesus would say to
[34:34] her at the end of this okay I can't
[34:37] I've taken place here she didn't know
[34:40] what was going to be safe but she did
[34:43] not do it because what she thought Jesus
[34:46] would do but what Jesus would say she
[34:50] seen him as worthy she's seen that Jesus
[34:55] needed to have the finest oil that there
[34:58] was she's seen that Jesus's feet needed
[35:01] to be washed she didn't know that Jesus
[35:06] would turn to her and say you've
[35:08] embarrassed yourself you've made
[35:11] yourself a mockery in front of this
[35:13] crowd but all of that sins which are
[35:16] much be forgiven me
[35:19] Oh hallelujah
[35:22] she didn't know that he would say that
[35:24] the end of this account but she did it
[35:27] anyhow it is my main purpose in life to
[35:32] serve Christ it is my main purpose in
[35:35] life to praise Christ I hope you don't
[35:37] mind me talking about myself here for a
[35:39] few moments but it's my main purpose in
[35:43] life to wake up and worship God to wake
[35:45] up and pray to God to wake up and read
[35:48] his holy word it's my main purpose in
[35:52] life to serve Him but to hear him say
[35:55] that I'll make your head and not the
[35:56] tail then I'll fill your baskets
[35:58] I'll feel your storehouses I bless your
[36:02] coming in now bless your going out I'll
[36:07] serve them no matter what but to hear
[36:09] him say I'm gonna take away all your sin
[36:11] to me it's just the cherry on top I did
[36:17] to serve him and I get the kingdom too I
[36:21] can hear him say I forgive you of all
[36:24] your sins I'm gonna take away all of
[36:26] your sicknesses all of your afflictions
[36:28] and all of your diseases and not only
[36:31] that I'm gonna rapture your earth and
[36:33] soul what a privilege it is to serve a
[36:41] king the world wants to tell me that I
[36:46] need to be ashamed of Jesus the world
[36:50] wants to tell me that I need to be
[36:52] ashamed of this gospel the world wants
[36:55] to tell people that they can't call
[36:56] themselves men of God and women of God
[36:59] and Christians in this world they don't
[37:01] want the name Jesus mentioned no more
[37:03] but they've come too late to try to stop
[37:06] me now
[37:09] I've been testifying of the marvelous
[37:12] grace of Jesus Christ for over 12 years
[37:16] now ever since he got ahold of my life
[37:19] and I have no intentions don't stop him
[37:22] now they can try to shut me down they
[37:28] can try to stop me
[37:30] but I'll never be ashamed of this gospel
[37:32] and everything it stands for turn with
[37:45] me to Isaiah chapter 54
[38:03] when you look in this scripture the
[38:06] scripture is speaking of a people who
[38:09] have been through captivity that's been
[38:12] through Wars been through bondage been
[38:16] through calamities they've been through
[38:18] trials this is a people that have
[38:22] watched their sons and their daughters
[38:23] their lives be destroyed this is a
[38:28] people that's outcasts this is a people
[38:31] that's outside their land there's a
[38:33] people that's a desolate people this is
[38:36] a people that's been kicked around like
[38:37] a rag doll Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 1
[38:51] sing-sing when you read those words you
[38:58] automatically think about singing for
[39:01] Jesus but what about when you hear
[39:04] somebody that you're very close to and
[39:08] you hear them singing what is it
[39:10] testifying to you they've got something
[39:13] to sing about they're happy they're full
[39:16] of joy but to me it's amazing to watch
[39:23] somebody that's going through a very
[39:26] dark moment and to see them singing when
[39:31] you're going through moments of despair
[39:33] and moments of trials I'm watching you
[39:37] Christ is watching you and to see you
[39:41] still sing it and to see you still
[39:45] praising God it shows me that there's
[39:50] joy in yourself
[39:54] he says scene Oh barren though that did
[40:00] it's not bear break forth into singing
[40:03] and cry loud you got something to sing
[40:07] about now I don't know what his plans
[40:12] are with this but he woke me up thirsty
[40:16] morning and he told me to tell you your
[40:22] joy is returning I don't know if he's
[40:30] got plans I don't know what his plans
[40:33] are to preach a message on that or just
[40:35] to say that to you tonight but he told
[40:37] me to tell you your choice returning
[40:39] your toys return
[40:47] sometimes sometimes it feels Latin all
[40:52] hope was gone and there's nothing left
[40:54] for you but he's got a word for you to
[40:57] tell you that your joy is returning your
[41:01] joys returning back to you you've gone
[41:03] through Laodicea and Laodicea and
[41:06] stripped you of all of your joy stripped
[41:08] you of all of your peace but the word of
[41:11] the Lord says your joy is returning
[41:15] David cried out in Psalms 51 create in
[41:19] me a clean heart and create a ray create
[41:22] a mere clean heart and renew in me a
[41:24] right spirit and restore to me the joy
[41:27] of my salvation I'll restore the joy of
[41:33] my salvation it was not saying that
[41:36] David was lost he had just lost the joy
[41:40] of his salvation that's what sin will do
[41:43] to you
[41:44] it will rob you of your joy it will rob
[41:46] you of your peace it will robbed you of
[41:48] praising God that's what sin will do and
[41:53] he cries out God restore unto me the joy
[41:58] of my salvation maybe you're going
[42:05] through that moment right now maybe
[42:06] you're going through a moment of
[42:08] darkness spare he never lost you
[42:12] salvation
[42:13] you just lost you toll but your joy is
[42:17] coming back your peace is coming back
[42:20] your family's coming back you got
[42:24] something to sing about for gospel right

[42:49] you're never seen before praise like you
[42:52] never praise before worship like you
[42:55] never worship before if God cared enough
[42:58] to wake me up early in the morning to
[43:01] tell me that your joy is returning
[43:03] I'd say God is as good as his word that
[43:07] your joy is on its Road don't wait for
[43:12] it it's returning open the door and let
[43:17] joy come on hear the joy of the Lord is

[57:38] and they're tense and they're driving
[57:39] down mistakes they're making ready for
[57:42] it when the world tells me that I need
[57:52] to be ashamed to this gospel that I
[57:53] preach I say I never could be ashamed of
[57:59] this gospel when the world tells me that
[58:03] I should no longer proclaim the name
[58:04] Jesus but I should no longer baptized in
[58:09] the name of Jesus
[58:15] when they tell me I need to be ashamed
[58:17] of this message that I preach how could
[58:21] i how could I ever be ashamed of this
[58:27] gospel how could I ever be ashamed of
[58:32] the God that went to a garden and cried
[58:36] and wept and battered it out in the
[58:40] garden said not my will but thy will be
[58:43] done
[58:43] how could I be ashamed of that when the
[58:47] world tells me I'm near be ashamed of
[58:49] that old rugged cross its despised by
[58:53] the world but how could I be ashamed but
[58:56] the God that carried that cross for me
[58:59] up gouge offers he'll tell me to hurts
[59:03] how could I rightfully being a say being
[59:07] a sinner saved by grace be ashamed of
[59:09] the God that saved my soul how could I
[59:14] be ashamed of this message when it is
[59:17] the power of salvation the power of
[59:20] deliverance the power of grace how can I
[59:25] be ashamed of this pillar fire the
[59:36] Muhammadans have a right to be ashamed
[59:38] in their religion because there's no
[59:40] resurrection there the Buddhists have
[59:43] every right to be ashamed of their
[59:45] religion because there's no resurrection
[59:47] there they agnostics to the atheists
[59:50] they've got every right to be ashamed of
[59:52] themselves for believing that there is
[59:53] no God but we as Christians should never
[59:57] be ashamed of this gospel for there is
[1:00:01] resurrection power in this message in
[1:00:04] this gospel it said my soul of law
[1:00:14] stand with me the semen
[1:00:35] I'd say
[1:00:39] I'd say that if you would ask my mom ask
[1:00:43] my dad I'd say that they would probably
[1:00:46] be pretty honest with you and tell you
[1:00:47] that there's some things that I did in
[1:00:49] my own past but they would say that
[1:00:54] they're ashamed about that I did or
[1:00:58] embarrassed that I did but TJ we did a
[1:01:04] couple things that were I'm pretty
[1:01:06] embarrassed about I'm embarrassed about
[1:01:08] saying I had to go diving in dumpster
[1:01:10] for chips one time but it's a type to me
[1:01:15] about a God that lifted me up out of the
[1:01:18] trash can of sin I'm embarrassed of
[1:01:23] certain things in my past but I'm not
[1:01:25] ashamed about the God this hand that was
[1:01:28] strong enough to pick me up
[1:01:34] how could I be ashamed how about a God
[1:01:38] that would tell you that Joey is
[1:01:41] returning I'd be ashamed if that was my
[1:01:47] word and tell you I don't know if Joey
[1:01:50] is coming but I tell you joy make up

[1:02:35] you cry but know that joy is coming more
[1:02:39] than weeping Joy's coming more than
