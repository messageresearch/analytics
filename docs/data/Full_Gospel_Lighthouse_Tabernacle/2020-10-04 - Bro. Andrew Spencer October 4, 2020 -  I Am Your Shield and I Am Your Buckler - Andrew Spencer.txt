all the honor in all the praise hallelujah [Music] hallelujah he is truly all of them [Music] he's worthy of it all he's a god that we know that can heal to the uttermost and as brother matthew said we want to be remembering brother john kelly a real faithful member here at full gospel lighthouse a senior deacon here at the church and he's been a faithful faithful servant of christ throughout the years so we want to be remembering him the doctors are saying that there's nothing else they can do for him and they plan to take him off the ventilator tomorrow monday morning so we know that this is a perfect chance for god to show up and show out and we know that if it's god's time to take brother john there's not a doctor on earth that can that can keep him here and if it's god's time to let him stay here there's there's no devil that can that can come with death and take him away so we know that this is a very troublesome time for the family the kelley family the bayleys everybody that is connected to the kelly family there we are certainly praying for every individual brother larry i've been in constant prayer for him and i know how hard this could be on him understanding the the value of fatherhood and so we just want to be remembering brother larry he's such a dear friend to myself and i love him with all of our hearts and i know that everyone here full gospel lighthouse extends that that love to brother larry sister joanne sister savannah the whole family sister even sister tammy sister linda we're just praying for them and knowing knowing that we serve a god now it's time for us to watch what god will do amen i'll let you have your seats this morning just to make a quick announcement to everyone here and to those on the internet we so thank you for being a part of these services the past couple weekends and and uh bearing with us during this time i know it's been difficult for for many of you as we all love to be in the house of god to worship lord the lord jesus christ in one accord and it's been difficult on us as your pastors to to to do these things because we whole lot rather preach to you as a congregation sitting here in body than to sit here and with empty pews that are that are that we look to see you fill in but this is how we have felt to go forward and to and to speak to you in this manner to keep you safe and i believe that i believe that if we have saved one from getting this sickness we've done our job and so we we know that we've been criticized for how we've handled things we know that we'll be criticized how we move forward but that's okay criticism comes with the job and so we we know that we're just doing what the lord is leading us to do and is what is best for you as as as we see to take care of you in this manner so we so we have dealt with this and prayed about it many times and so we've waited until until we've had no cases for the last couple weeks and so lord willing next saturday we will have an in-person service for half of our congregation and so we'd like to ask we'd like to ask all of those that that we had sitting on the fraser side on the left-hand side as you enter in all of those that are that were sitting on this side on the left hand side which would be my right hand side but your left hand side as you enter in to come on saturday night at seven o'clock and then we would like to invite those that were sitting on the right hand side as you enter to come on sunday morning at 11 o'clock and so we so we're asking for for half and half here and you'll you'll remember where you are i know that i know that you'll remember where you were sitting at before all this it's not been that long so just uh just come and so we we invite you to come but yet we're not pressuring you to come and if you feel um anxious or shook up about coming we we know we're not pressuring you to come but we want to open the house of the lord so that so that you can come and have the opportunity to worship the lord in the house of the lord where god ordained us to be at here on earth to worship him so we open that up to you those that were sitting on the fraser side uh and on the left-hand side as you enter if you could come on saturday night at seven and those that were sitting on the right-hand side at 11 on sunday you can wear your mask if you choose to do so throughout the whole service we will not well we will not demand you to do that not even the cdc room recommends that or or they demand that but we're just offering that to you you can keep your mask on the whole time if it makes you feel comfortable you do so in that manner and so we won't be just so you know what we're doing we won't be having special services or special singing uh while we're here in church that way we're not handing off the microphones and different things and and transferring so we'll just let the musicians and the song leaders to do the leading of songs and specials just for a certain time we don't i hope you don't get tired of our singing and if you do you'll just have to get used to it and uh it's the best we got right now and so uh so we just we just want to present these things to you but also you know know for shortly that i'm not pressuring you to come the health department i've been in contact with them thank you for whoever give them my name or number but i've been in contact with them and they've been happy with the way we've dealt and handled everything that we've that we've went through and so so now we're moving forward this is the place that i believe that sons and daughters of god long to be in and and so we we know that we haven't had any cases for the past 14 days so we're just we're attentively planning to open up service next saturday night and so if you choose if you're sitting on this side you you feel welcome to come we'll be here we're going to preach to you the word of the lord now we don't fear this thing uh but we're not stupid about it either we're we don't we don't fear it but we're very cautious and uh so we we just don't want to tempt the temp the enemy to come and say that we're too proud or we're too big to get this thing because i know what he'll do and so we just we're thankful that uh the people that have that have contracted this disease have either gotten better or or or god has moved on the scene for them but we don't want to spread this any further to you as the people and so as again no pressure to come but if you're going to go to walmart and go to everywhere else i think you can come to the house of the lord and again i'm not pressuring you to do anything don't don't say the brother andrews holding a knife to my neck saying i got to get to the house of the lord or i won't be saved i'm not doing those things but don't use covet as an excuse not to serve the lord i believe that as the prophet would say that every time the doors open that's where a christian they long to be in the house of the lord and i know you haven't been able to come because i haven't allowed you to be able to come but so so you've got you've got me to blame for the past couple weekends and if if you if if you've been there you know you can blame it on me yeah you know so now we're giving you a chance to get right back with god again if it's that's been your case she lost god for the last couple weeks we've given you a chance to find him again so so next week intentively if we if we decide to go anyway different we will let you know by the church text message system and facebook so just be in prayer for us that we get no new cases and we can come back and we hope not to do this very long um so so so everybody i know the big question is well i want the opportunity to be here when brother ron's speaking well we're going to give you that opportunity so brother ron and myself we will alternate to make sure everybody gets a fair chance so that they can hear their pastor i longed to hear him as well i offered him for so that he could take both services both weekends both nights but i thought he was going to kill me when i did so but so so we will we will make sure that you get the opportunity to hear from brother ron and so we just certainly love each and every one of you this morning hopefully you're happy healthy and and that you're ready to serve the lord with us this morning and uh thank you for letting me take the time to make those announcements to you i know that it's not the most uh opportune time to be able to say those things right before the preaching of the word but i've got your attention and so we've delivered the news to you so now you can be in prayer for us as we move forward into the services so so god bless you today let's let's stand and we'll sing let's sing that song let your word be born in the manger of my heart and we just love the lord today happy to serve the lord in spirit and in truth happy to be in his house no matter where you are in your car in your home make that the temple of the lord today the house of the lord where he can come and fill your house fill your home and fill it with the atmosphere of the lord it was a tiny simple stable all beaten and worn who hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty so i know if i'll give him control he'll be born in me let your words [Music] [Music] oh let it start live inside this house of clay and mold it every day [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] not much to behold unlike the place for his word to unfold but if i'll just heal this vessel and let him have his way from glorion to glory he'll change me day [Music] my heart [Music] inside this house [Music] [Applause] [Music] in [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this morning we'll turn over in the book of genesis chapter 15 and verse 1. amen genesis chapter 15 and verse 1 and we like to speak some things that are upon our heart this morning and i don't know exactly how long i'll be short or long but i just want to give the lord opportunity to speak this morning some things that he has spoken directly to myself and and i feel like they're directly to you as as god's people so we just want to take this scripture this morning genesis chapter 15 and verse 1 but before we read let's speak to the author of the word father we come to you this morning lord your servants lord we've come into the house of god lord we as your people that are sitting and listening by the way of the internet this morning have made their house a tabernacle where a sanctuary that you could come down and fill their living room feel where they're at lord jesus fill the kitchen fill the car lord and you could come and speak to them lip to ear lord and make yourself known to them like never before lord i pray today that as the word would go forth that you would be high and lifted up i pray that you would speak to us your children lord you see the things that that we have need of and body the things that we have need of in spirit lord and lord even lord even into the realms of our soul father we pray that you would reach into the uttermost with the holy spirit and begin to begin to knock on our hearts door and may we open up our heart lord and let jesus on in father lord we pray that you would be merciful to your children lord i our precious brother john kelly lord that's in a very dire situation lord we know that nothing's too hard for you lord jesus and we know god that that it takes as much faith to let him go into that realm as much faith as it does for you to raise him up lord to believe so father we stand here in faith this morning that you're going to work everything out according to your perfect will lord i pray that you would use my lips speak to your children today lord in the name of jesus christ we pray these things amen and amen genesis chapter 15 to verse 1 the bible says that after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord after these things the word of the lord came unto abram now if you if you're a very very scholared bible reader and read over these things you you'll realize that this is the very first time in the scriptures where we see that the word of the lord came and and many times we see how the word would come and we realized that jesus is the word that john 1 1 would tell us that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and and here we see as as abram is in a vision as as god brings him into that realm of vision and begins to speak to him in that vision and he says to him fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and before i go into our topic today i would like to just just make a few comments on on last weekend's service and and those that were here in the congregation could testify to these things that that that last week in service was one of the most powerful atmospheres that that we've ever set in as a people and personally myself i felt like from the very beginning that that god was god was doing some very special things now we know that when his children come together to worship him that that god is there because god inhabits the praises of his people but yet last weekend it was such a it was such an atmosphere that was already that was already there the people of god and the children of god and your prayers that went forth had set an atmosphere in this place where god felt very welcome to come and yet we were sitting here and the church was basically empty but yet it was full in a complete different sense of things and yet when when when we were going through those things brother brother alden and myself we've related these things we've went over these things and listened to that service over and over again this week just listening to key words and things that were spoken by the man of god and we realized that that that the man of god is a servant of the lord and and that god speaks through man and and as we were there we were just listening and it was it was like elohim himself was speaking lift to ear to his children and when when brother ron he when i was called up on stage and i want you to notice some of these statements that when i was pulled up on stage that that that that was more than brother ron that was standing there but that that to me was elohim ever so close and when i'm not trying to take anything or or necessarily to steal anything from brother ron's service but yet i believe that if if we are real servants of christ that we're inspired by the man of god we're inspired by the word of god and so from last week in service i want to speak to you on these things that i am your shield and i am your buckler but you remember that that now i want you to notice this and i don't want you to necessarily see me but i want you to see yourself in this but as i was pulled up on the stage as it were that the very first words that were spoken was abram i am thy shield and i am thy buckler now i'm sitting in this atmosphere last weekend and i'm sitting there and i just began to speak the things of god i began to speak to god saying lord would you reveal the secrets of my heart would you speak live to hear to me today and many times when i'm saying those things as a leader of this church i am asking for a word of the lord to come to myself so that i can speak it to you but notice as soon as i was pulled on stage he says i am thy shield and i am the buckler now that evening about six eight o'clock we got a phone call at our house house there that evening and and a sister that lives hundreds of miles away from here she calls up sister katie and she begins to tell her these things and she said she had just come to a spot of relaxation for the day and going through the day's events and she was just sitting down in in her in her place there and she had been reading some things and she said all of a sudden there began to be an amber of light come in the room and it began to whirl in the room and this this this lady is a very spiritual lady a voice that i trust and i've seen the things that she's spoken that become true and i i've watched those things so i i trust the voice but i want you to notice these things that that these things are are to us as his children and here the amber of light comes into the room and begins to whirl in that room and all of a sudden the lord begins to speak to her and tells her says next time you speak with katie spencer you say to her tell brother andrew that i am thy shield and i am thy buckley now you don't know what that done to me in that moment when i'm sitting there when i know what was spoken early that morning and then i watched when god speaks the same thing that night as i watch him say to us that i am thy shield and i am that buckler he wasn't necessarily just speaking to me yet i believe he was speaking to me but i believe with all of my heart is standing there saying god i want you to speak to me something a word to the church and he is saying to a people of god that's been called by his name that i am thy shield and i am thy buckler that i am your defense that i am your everything that i am your front and i am your back i've got you in the front i am your real reward i am everything to you that though you may have been through some stuff you went through covet and you did well i was just shield through that you went through cancer and i was a shield you went through turmoil and i was your shield you went through fear and i was a shield you went through a baby loss and i was healed you went through sickness and i was healed he is saying to a people of god that i am your protection and if you are behind me there is nothing that can get to you hallelujah but notice in the scripture that that the scripture in genesis chapter 15 that that the bible as it begins to open up it says after these things the word of the lord came now notice if you go back and read genesis chapter 14 you'll see what takes place there when you see the battle with the kings they are the four kings and and how that abram goes out and he he completely goes out in self-denial of himself and self-denial of his 318 male servants he puts his own neck on on the line for his for his own kin one that will in the future will separate himself he's separating himself and notice the self-denial of abram that notice the victory and you notice the blessing of melchizedek in genesis chapter 14 that after the battle with the kings that this is when the king shows up and abram begins to pay tithes and the levites begin to pray ties to their father abraham and he begins to speak to him and brother branham grabs this genesis chapter 15 on on the wings of a snow white dove and he reads this scripture and he's grabbing from down in verse 4 and 5 and six but he when he reads over genesis chapter one he says i am thy shield and i am the buckler he said he is jehovah nessie that he is your victory and here abram is setting in this prophetic realm of vision and we realize what that vision is we as a people of god understand the vision and under able under the age that we're living in we understand the visions of god like like people have never understood before but we realize that abram being a prophet he was able to look in that prophetic realm and begin to see that the word of the lord came to him in that hour and if he says something in that vision we know that those visions never fail we know that those visions never fail and here he is speaking to abram but he's not just speaking to abram he's speaking to his seed and he's saying to his seed that i am thy shield and i am thy buckler brother branham would say now the vision don't heal you the vision lets you know that the elohim that god almighty is very present and if you could realize that we were sitting in a vision last weekend and now we're sitting in a vision in this service today and he's saying to the people of god and if you could only realize what is happening in this service and then around the world that the people that will listen to this colleges that are listening to this there are mighty powerful people in hollywood that listen to this and they're saying that god is saying to a people that i am thy shield and i am thy buckler he's not just saying that that that that was just to abraham in the natural that was abraham in the spiritual and the bible said that if ye are christ then are you abraham's seed the vision lets you know that he's close you remember when brother brandon was sitting there and he was he was dealing with a case and he's trying to get a prayer line in order and everything they have to go through the cards and everything has to be just right because people just get out of order but there was there was a there was a there was a black lady that was there in the back and she began to bust through the ushers and break through the ushers and come down there and scream and brother branham heal my child heal my baby heal my child and brother branham has to conduct the order and get things back in line and he says now i can't i can't do nothing for you sister i believe that your baby can be healed but i i don't i can't say anything until he shows me and so they begin to get the prayer line back in order and all of a sudden brother madam said i began to see a road come out in front of me and he said i watched that vision as it came out and he said there was that little girl that had been paralyzed when that doctor was working on her and operating on her tonsils he said there was that little girl that had been paralyzed for two years from her shoulder down that little girl was walking down that road and she was bouncing and had a little baby doll in her heart and she was just patting that little baby as she was walking down through there and the servant of the lord turned to her and says honey your baby's gonna be well and she says when will it be he said right now she's well and the brother and brother branham said there wasn't enough devils in hell that satan couldn't send enough devils out of hell that could stop that vision because god had already said so and that little baby at that moment stood up and started screaming and praising the lord said mother i'm healed people started fainting around them why because the vision had spoke oh church of the living god the vision has spoke things about you that are there in eternity that are waiting for this temporal body to catch up with and you will walk right into that spot of eternity whoo there are things that are holding that are holding there just for the moment and when it comes to pass it will create such a catas music event that all hell will be shook down hallelujah hallelujah you look down in genesis chapter 15 when abram begins to speak to the lord notice he's still in the vision he's still in the vision and he begins to say to him you see that i go childless you see i don't have this child you see that i don't have an heir and he begins to speak to him the only air that i have is eliezer the pre the elies are of the the eldest the eldest servant is he my heir and god begins to speak to him and the word of the lord came to him and says this will not be your heir but out of your own loins out of your own loins will come forth as heat and then god takes him in the vision and he tells him he takes him out and he says you see the stars up there can you number them can you call them by their name do you know how many is up there and he begins to tell a man they ain't got a child god he's telling a man a vision that he knows down on earth that he ain't got a child that he could pass on his lineage to but he begins to tell him you look a pair of them stars that's going to be your seed what was he looking at church he was looking at you i believe that abram when he was looking at those stars was seeing me right down here in laodicea and he was realizing that god was saying to his children all the way down in laodicea that i am my shield and i am my buckler you're going to go through some stuff but i'm going to bring you out stronger oh hallelujah you see god was abram's portion and so is he the portion of every righteous soul i am your constant covering i am your protector and i am your great and exceeding great reward it was not a land it was not canaan that was the promise but it was salvation to come through that promised seed that his word would be abram's strength brother branham said he said if god is your shield how is the devil going to hit you hallelujah if god is your shield how how in the world is the devil ever going to hit you he is your great and exceeding great reward he's helped to the helpless he's hoped to the hopeless he's a friend to the friendless he's health to the sick he's strength to the weak he's power to the powerless he's life to the lifeless he's god if you serve him he's god if you don't when your barrel is empty he's your meal when your loved one's gone he's your comfort hallelujah when you're going through some stuff he's your everything i wonder this morning what's jesus been to you what's jesus been to you in your life has he been a friend has he been a doctor has he been a lawyer has he been a shield has he been a buckler has he been in defense for you i say it's jesus in the morning it's jesus in the evening it's jesus all day long hallelujah it's jesus whoo hallelujah this promise is unto you and to your children as many as the lord our god shall call that i am my shield hallelujah what we need today is a good old-fashioned sky blue sin killing religion sweeping this country in an old time saint paul's revival and the baptism of the holy ghost back in the church again that's the best defense better than any atom bomb was ever created you notice what was spoke to you and again i'm not trying to infringe on brother ron sermon but i am inspired if you weren't inspired by last weekend go back and listen until you get inspired but i heard somebody from another world say do you know who you are do you know who i am do you know that i've called you by your name who are you who are you are you a son of god are you a daughter of god that's the best defense that the world has ever known it's a church full of power a church full of authority a church that is called by his name that will not be stripped that will not be whipped a church that has all access and authority in the name of jesus christ and the word of god will whip satan anytime any place under any circumstance i want you to know i don't know how you feel at your home this morning but this church feels like it's ten thousand angels that are sitting here in this place the holy ghost is the best defense that the world has ever known of paul would say it like this i am crucified with christ hallelujah i am crucified with christ and the life that i now live not the life that i once knew sure i was a scholar sure i wasn't know it all sure i knew everything there was about god of the old testament but i didn't know anything about the god of the new testament but when i met that pillar of fire i knew that the god of the old testament was jesus christ of the new and i begin to realize that the life that i now live will put me will put me into a grave maybe the life that i now live i may go by the way of the grave but the life that i now live will get me out of the grave that the message that i preach in this day that there will be a people in the last day will believe what paul preached believe what peter preached the life that paul was now living hallelujah i can tell you about the life that i used to live and the life that i used to live gave me a whole lot more age than what i should have got there's a whole lot more aches and pains in my body because of the life that i used to live but if i could go to telling you about the life that i now live i tell you about how a god can take away your aches and pains i tell you about a god that'll heal your blind eyes i tell you about a god that can heal you to the uttermost i'll tell you about a god the life that i now live the life that i now live will put me in a body change the life that i now live will save the prodigals that i prayed for the life that i now live i am my shield and thy buckler call i am thy shield and thy buckler john when you're there when you're there on the isle of patmos and things ain't looking good i am my shield and i am thy buckler you see there's a lot of people that get the wrong idea or their own concept on god being your sealed they think that if god is your shield that you're not going to go through anything hallelujah if you go back to look at abram's life from genesis chapter 15 all the way to genesis chapter 22 there's some stuff that happens to abram are you with me there's some stuff that happens to abraham that that that god was not promising him everything in the materialistic realm everything's going to be okay i'm going to give you everything asked for but abram went through lies abram went through turmoil abram went through separation abram went through abraham went through old age sarah went through trials every month but he was not telling him that i am your shield and i'm going to keep you from everything but he is telling him that i am for you and that there's nothing going to happen to you unless i permit it we'll say well he's my shield today but yet my family member got coveted he still you're sealed he's still your buckler there's not one hair on your head that's falling off unless god knows where it's at brother branham would say i ain't lost one of them sister me she says pray tell me where they are he says where were they before the foundation of the world are you with me if you can see who you are it'll tell you where you're going hallelujah paul could say the life that i now live the life that i now live i can say i am a word person i can say i am a word being i am a spiritual gene of god that i came here to give light to the word paul could say the life that i now live i am packing the very image of god the life that i now live i am preaching to a people that believe what the bible is all about the life that i now live i don't believe that it should be just for paul to be able to say those things that paul would say the life that i now live or i pack the image of god that we are the images of christ i believe it's a people right now yeah you may be scared yes you may be going through turmoil yes you may be in fear yes you may be in all kinds of circumstances but do not forget who you are i am a word being i am a gene sheet of god in my body i am packing the very image of christ i came at this time to give light to the manifested word of this day and there won't be no devil that stops this bride satan has tried to stop church satan has tried to stop you praying satan has tried his very worst to keep you from believing in almighty god but god has allowed circumstance to bring you into a crisis of belief hallelujah notice in the rising of the sun he said he said no more could the botany life live back there at the beginning without the sun to bring it to life no more than today when sons of god is upon the earth it takes the s-o-n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world and on easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time catch me in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that because this son of god raised it would also raise a life every son that was foreordained to this great time the church ages had all the mechanics down they had everything in order they could tell you how to do this even pentecost come up to it and they were that close they had all the mechanics right but they didn't have the dynamics they didn't have the spark to get that cadillac on the road but there's a people on earth today that is completely in the car and ready to take off this thing's going to go faster than a rocket this thing's going to go faster than the neil armstrong ever went up there when we change our bodies it's going to be in a moment in a twinkling of an eye before you can ever blat your back your eyes brother gabriel we're out of here oh figure that one out science hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he is our defense he is our strength and paul would say when we would grab over in ephesians chapter 6 and 16 and we can look at the spiritual weaponry of a christian but verse 16 paul says above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked so we we see here that not only not maybe you will be able to quench the fire guards but he says wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked now now we all know what a shield is but a buckler a buckler is basically a double shield it's a round shield with a grip and history would say that a shield was held with one hand but a a a buckler was had a place where you would stick both arms or bow and arm through both loops and that buckler would would run from all the way up to your head or right here at your head all the way down and it would cover you and god is saying that i am thy shield and i am thy buckland now they would use in in warfare they would use that shield when they would run out of arrows and they'd run out of spears or whatever they would they would use it as a block when the enemy was shooting or throwing spears at them but also they would use that as a ram when they would when they would hit them and they would charge with them that they would go forth and they would knock the enemy and try to knock him down and keep moving forward so god is saying to you that i am i am your moving forward that not only not only does he have just one hand in it but he's got the arm of the lord revealed in there he's got power revealed in there he's got authority revealed in there and if you can keep moving forward as he moves forward not go back to pentecost not go back to methodist not go back to wesley but if you can keep moving forward you can stay right behind that shield i wonder what you got as your shield today i wonder what is really your defense today is it jesus christ or is it your is it your 401k is it your job is it your family is it your loved one god is going to try you like never before to find out what your shield is there's a lot of people there's a lot of people that are so upset and i it makes me wonder sometimes it makes me wonder they're so upset about the political realm right now there's so many things going on right now and if you can just keep in the back of your mind christians that politics is of the devil but i i wonder sometimes that if god would come the day before election day would they be looking for him some people would get so upset that they didn't get to cast their vote before they got gone for me i have already cast my vote many years ago before i even had a chance he chose me before the foundation of the world i could care less if i cast my vote whether i sent my ballot in i've already chose that i'm on the winning side if you're on the devil's side you're on the loose inside but if you're on jesus's side you're on the winning side you can put biden in there you can put pelosi in there you can put trump in there all you want to brother barnum said i don't even pray for america no more he said i just committed to god america is doomed but there's a people that have a shield of protection around her hallelujah but jesus is saying to you i am thy shield jesus becomes the shield now when they were in warfare they would that that buckler that buckler would be woven with maybe different types of leather or put together with wickery of different things of different materials but they had to anoint the front of that shield so that that when the enemy was throwing darts at them or throwing spears at them that that they would quickly just a sail off of there and plus it kept it it kept it fresh that anointing kept it fresh isaiah 21-5 tells us to anoint the shields but you don't have to worry about anointing jesus he's already anointed he is the christ he is the anointed one he's already anointed to take care of you and everything that you go through hallelujah now watch he said now satan's army brings diseases that's what satan is he's a destroyer satan the whole kingdom of satan is sickness death and sorrow and flusterations and worry all on satan god is life faith joy peace over here that's two great forces that's coming together right now they're battling they're battling right here in this building right now they battle day by day with you every force he said satan's following you alone that great big kingly priestly goliath and he's trying to scare the liver out of you he's right but god you're fortified a man with the gospel with the word of truth around your loin glory preacher that's what it is helmet of salvation the shield of faith and a sword waving it in your hand satan i'm coming to meet you you meet me in the name of science you meet me in the name of culture you meet me in the name of organization you meet me in the name of this that or the other but i meet you in the name of the lord god of israel i'm coming after you give away even death itself can't stand there chop a hole through it you see when david was there when he was when he was going up against goliath when he rose to the challenge saul tried to offer him his shield but david had not tested that it had not been proven by david before but he knew that if he would take the weapon that god had used with him before in times past that god would come behind it with an amen but notice david only had one spot that he could hit goliath in and that was one little spot in the forehead and brother burnham said that before david could ever let that rock loose that god went to god in that thing that god took it and he struck the goliath right in the forehead you see you've only got one place children where you can strike the enemy out and that's right in the forehead right with unbelief that's what he comes to you at is with unbelief and that's where you strike him at we are to cast down reasonings we are to cast down imaginations we're to cast down fear we're to cast down these things well i'm so worried about coving i'm not worried about coffin i'm not trying to be brash or bold here i'm only worried about one thing and that's the rapture if it comes if kovac comes my way and it's my time to go goodbye world i'm not worried about one thing because i laid all my worries on him a long time ago and i figured out a long time ago if i can lay my worries down hallelujah how's that song go i ain't gonna study war no more i'm gonna lay down my sword and shield and we'll study war no more i'm not bothered by it i'm not upset about it there's only one thing for the bride of jesus christ and that's the rapture hallelujah you look down in genesis chapter 15 you go through that chapter and i i think it's a powerful chapter you go through and i think you ought to be able to see yourself there but when god is speaking to abraham and he begins to tell him in verse 13 and 14 that thy shield that that i am the shield in that book and it goes down in 13 and 14 and he begins to tell them that your seed is going to sojourn in a strange land that they're going to be strangers in that land and he said that land i have condemned them i have condemned them in that land that they're going to be strangers there they're going to be down there for 400 years but i've already condemned them so before pharaoh ever knew that he was a thought god had already judged him and egypt with him and he had already chosen moses to be that deliverer so what god is telling abraham your children gonna go through some stuff your children will go through some trials they're gonna be strangers in a strange land but they're going to come out of that thing but if you watch what jesus says on the backside of verse 14 he said that when they come out they're coming out with great substance he's saying to them that you're going to go through some stuff you might go through covet you might go through carmel you might lose loved ones you might go through fear you might go through all things but i want to tell you this you coming out with more than what you had when you went in hallelujah when you come out you're coming out rapture ready you're coming out in exodus form you're coming out dressed you're coming out blessed you're coming out in victory why because i am my shield when they were getting beat jesus was still their shield when when pharaoh was staring down at them and calling them nothing but a bunch of my daubers he said i am thy buckler i am your anointing i am your protection but what about the beatings what about the beatings what about the scars what about all i've been through what about covet what about laodicea i am thy shield and i am my book don't you forget even though you may be down so down far down in the mud building a brick keep beating me all you want to next time you feel like you're doing both at the same time like you're taking a beating and you're building a brick you just turn your eyes around say beat me all you want to there's an exodus at hand beat me all you want to scar me all you want to but i'm reminded about a king that one day that rolled past a war i passed a warrior that had been in war and was laying there and was all scarred up he said where did you get those scars at he said i got him when i was in the fight for you keep beating me all you want to i'm getting ready to leave in a twinkling of an eye i'm making my investments in the bank up in the sky oh happy preparations i'm getting ready to leave oh hallelujah as soon as i left the service last weekend i turned on on going trying to do god a service without being in his will and brother brennam goes into prayer and he said just like elisha followed elijah we follow our we follow our jesus he said on one of these days he said just like elijah went up he said one of these days he's going to unhook the horses from the bushes and we've got to go up church i am my shield and i am my buckler i am getting ready to lift you off of this earth don't get your eyes on the things of earth look up look up look up hallelujah what about brother john yes let's consider brother john right now if he goes tomorrow morning you can rest assured church brother john's okay if tomorrow morning brother john is talking to us you can rest ashore brother john's okay what about brother homer you ain't got to worry about brother homer you can rest assure he's okay what about your loved one you can rest assured they're going to be okay because on resurrection morning they're going to come walking down that road and you're going to see them i don't care where it's at just come walking and i know that the rapture's right at hand and we're getting ready to leave don't you be worried church we're getting ready for takeoff hallelujah hallelujah who are you behind this morning who's in front of you this morning what's jesus been to you let's stand hallelujah hallelujah two scriptures before we close this morning psalms 1 psalms 18 and 2 and then psalms 18 and 30. the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliver my god my strength and whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower verse 30 as for god his way is perfect is that right sister his way is perfect when his ways aren't our ways remember his thoughts are higher than our thoughts don't get the wrong concept on this shield don't get the wrong concept look past what you see to pass what you don't see abraham had to look past his flesh he had to look past his failures but abraham on the other side abraham on the other side maybe i can do this hallelujah hallelujah abraham on the other side on this side abraham was troubled on this side abraham lied on this side abraham was a failure but on this side hallelujah on this side abraham was a father of faith on this side of the book abraham was the father of us all on this side we are called to be abraham's seed oh church don't look past don't look back here look past what you see into the things that you don't see his ways are higher than our ways hallelujah his blood is higher than church his bride is higher than government his bride is higher than in authority on earth look past what you see oh hallelujah just give up on everything around you give up on everything around you your ways will fail you but his way is perfect if everything around you seems to be falling apart i read a quote yesterday said talent will get you in the room but character will keep you in the room there's a lot of people now i'm gonna bridge some things right here there's a lot of people that had talent to come in the room they had talent enough to be close to abraham that was close enough to be where abraham was but they didn't have enough anointing to keep them in the room with abraham but when abraham went in that tent that night he knew everything that melchizedek had said about him was absolutely the truth i want to say this to you church of the living god everything that he said about you is nothing but the truth i believe we said some right words i believe we're right in the vision this morning if hattie wright could say the right word what about a people that's called by his name i have said the right words that this is the message of jesus christ this is the message of him goodbye world his ways are perfect his rapture is perfect shake off those heavy chains amen shake off those heavy chains he will break your chains but he will never break his promise the vision has spoke and it's time to walk into it i am thy shield and thy buckler this may not be for nobody else out there but it's for me it's for full gospel lighthouse if i ever felt to say something to you as a church he is saying i am thy shield and i you've am brought on a stage for such a time as this he's the author of the word he's wrote it all out he's wrote everything out the script is wrote out like shakespeare would write out his he would write out his scripts and say the things about certain characters about romeo and juliet the script was rolled out but shakespeare on the backside it was not concerned how the characters would play out their parts because he was the one that wrote it i want you to know that god is not worried about you playing out your part he's the one that wrote it you're walking in step to the music onward christian soldiers marching against the war hallelujah soon the lamb would take his pride to be ever at his side when he says these signs shall follow them that believe the sympathy screams out amen that the days of miracles are not past the sympathy streams out amen that this is the ministry of the son of man the sympathy screams out hallelujah amen amen amen amen oh don't you love him today oh hallelujah lord jesus hallelujah go to praise them where you are this morning go to lifting up holy hands under the lord his ways are perfect his ways are past finding out he's there in the hospital room with sister brewed through it today he's here
