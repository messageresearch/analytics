holding her her phone up last night and it was being sent to turkey and she was sitting right there and it was being translated at the same time so amen and so amen and it is my understanding that we

get some snow wednesday my wife is so happy she could have a shouting service right now i'm not but she's really happy and so happy wife happy life amen that works well doesn't it brother paul that's a it's a true statement amen something came to my heart this week and i whenever the lord kind of speaks something to your heart you you just you just say well i i was preparing for funeral service and i just just spoke a few minutes on it and i knew it was more than just for a funeral service so i'd like to speak to you this morning maybe for a short time with my energies i'd like to speak to you on he cares he cares if you will turn with me in your scriptures to hebrews chapter 2 and verse 1. i'd like to just set the scene just for a moment brother branham is going to walk to the pulpit and he's going to speak a sermon and i'd like for you to listen to it this week if you could if you could remember to do it you know in your daily activities he speaks a sermon on he cares do you care and he's going to take it at a different angle than even i'm going to take it this morning but he speaks a sermon to the layout of seen age christ has come in this age there's a new administration that is going on we've had reformers all down through the ages and now god has sent a prophet and brother branham will take the time to tell us that billy graham is on the scene he's not going to do it in this service but he's taking the time billy graham is on the scene six letters and he will he will spell out his name and and he'll take his time wanting people to get it if you can just get it sometimes we set it even in a service like today and we we let it just go through us and we think well it was sunday morning but did you get it did you get what the thought was the theme thought of it brother branham walks through the pulpit and for probably for many of those people that were there that morning they they thought well this is just another service brother branham is in his own simple way and they called him too simple but in his simple way he was telling them god cared enough about this generation to come himself i've said a whole lot in that mouthful god cared enough about this generation to come himself now i want to say it to you he cared enough about you where was you at stephen where were you at paul where were you at brother hill where were you at god cared about you not a president not some dictator somewhere another but god cared about you we could dismiss already now i want you to watch the scripture that he takes for a text and then we'll go to another scripture therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at first began to be spoken by the by the lord and confirmed unto us by them which heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and divers miracles and gift of the holy ghost according to his own will not your will thank you lord his will you can be seated i don't think david could have put it any better i think he describes every one of us if you're a christian and you've had some good days and you've had some difficult days i want you to just take this to heart this morning you've heard it before you've read it before but i want you to just take it to heart in psalms 139 and verse 1 oh lord thou has searcheth me and known me thou knowest my down setting mine up arising thou understandeth my thought afar off he understands things about us that we don't understand i think that scripture is so complex we'll never understand it thou compasseth my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways [Applause] now this is the god that watches over the universes and they say there's about 70 universes with 70 sons like the one we have and in the ball this little old ball that we are on most of us will not do much traveling but we we won't we won't go over this earth too much and god is so concerned about even where we're at hallelujah you're acquainted with all my ways for there is not a not a word in my tongue but lo thou knowest it all together and that makes me want to have a prayer meeting right there thou hast beset me behind him before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high and i cannot attain to it i just can't grasp everything that god thinks about me whether i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence if i send up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the other most parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i say surely darkness shall cover me even the night and the light about me yea the darkness hideth from me but the night shineth this day and the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made you talking about a statement a predestination he knowed exactly what the bell of your life would need to sound like and he had every individual to marry all the way down so he could get you hallelujah my substance 15 my substance was not hid from thee when i was made and secretly crawl curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in my book all the members were written which were incontinence were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious are thy thoughts unto me my god how great is the sum of them i'd like for us to read that verse together if we can how precious also are the thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them well brother ron that doesn't seem too too much if he ever thought of you he ever thought of you you're as eternal as god is eternal hallelujah god's not in the forgetting business his eyes on the sparrow and he's watching over you listen to the prophet as he begins to say it in just a couple of quotations he said he said maybe the devil has caught you out somewhere and give you a disease or some sickness or your backslid or something like that but remember he climbed the ramparts of glory and setting on high and his eye is on the sparrow and i know he's watching over me he is from everlasting to everlasting god he steps up and he watches you he sees where you're at he knows that we're having this meeting tonight he knows how concerned each one of us are about he he knows your interest in him he knows your interest in the kingdom he knows where your heart is so he watches over his word he said oh cast your cares on him he cares for you he cares for you now we know he said let's let's just ask for a few minutes if he cares for us all right he cared for a leopard when he was on earth there said a leopard did you ever see a leopard he said he said i've seen many hug them in my arms and them white white with leprosy looks like a seed wart turned inside out he said sitting there nobody would touch them down with the slime and the dirt and the filth of the street about as low as you can get and everybody was afraid to get around them he was an outcast a cast away from society of the city from the society of the church from the society of everything that there was in the city and nobody wanted to touch them if they'd done anything they'd pitch them a piece of bread or let them get out and get it out of the dirt they wouldn't get near them but jesus cared for them and he walked right down with him and sat down and i can see him lay his hands upon them i will that thou be clean oh he cared when nobody else would care he cared when nobody else will care for you he still cares now let me just say this to you and this is my phrase to you now let me just say i don't care where you're at and what your situation is and don't and you may feel like there's nobody that loves you in the entire world but he cares are you with me brother on why hasn't the resurrection happened to the rapture he still cares there's people that he still cares there's people that he refuses to let go through the tribulation period he still cares hallelujah maybe some of them are your loved ones he still cares when you give up and others give up he still cares when you was a reject from society he still cared for you what others wouldn't have nothing to do with you he cares for you in the busyness of a day and you feel that warm presence sweep through the room you realize that you're not alone anymore you realize there's another individual in the room that's got every problem that you've got in control and he's there to give you the strength he's not gonna move your mountain he's gonna give you strength to climb [Applause] he's not gonna take your storm away he's gonna take you by the hand and walk across the water with you hallelujah he said now my question for us tonight is do you care we live in a generation that don't care anymore we live in a very unthankful generation a very unholy generation a very hand-out generation [Music] with people that just plain don't care they don't care about them the society look around in america the riots that happened and burned down innocent people's homes destroyed innocent people's businesses that they spent their life building generations building and they just looted it and destroyed it humanity doesn't care anymore the drug world don't care anymore brother nathaniel they took me to the emergency room the other day and and our cancer doctor told us that all you did is you had a supernatural intervention and that was quite a statement from a doctor and i was having a heart attack and it was going on it was progressing and all of a sudden it just went it was just gone labs came back everything's good you can go home i'd like to went to eat but but nothing was open and so i was with the cancer doctors the other day and they asked me i said how was your experience well you know most of the time i'm very cordial i'm i don't try to complain but i said i said i'm kind of concerned i said i i'm i'm uh what am i looking for i'm a patient here with the cancer clinic i i have stage four and the head doctor was in my room 30 seconds in the ring he was in my head my room 30 seconds i said i'm concerned they don't care now now let's just think about this you're supposedly having a heart attack and the head doctor's only in your room 30 seconds and i looked at her and i said that's a failure you want me to fill out a survey paper i'm not gonna i'm not gonna fill it out i'm not gonna fill it out i don't want to see nobody lose their job but 30 seconds isn't enough time to say hello you know and we had a resident in three or four times but i brought my own personal doctor with me thank god for that thank god for people who do care i think about us as a body here and a body around the world and i hear about people passing for covet and things and how many prayers have came our way this week brother ray montgomery passed away and i knew him for many many many years and he was a horn player and he and his wife both were were musicians in their small church of about 15 people and here he passes away sister blue a pastor's wife she passed away and this morning i i said i sent letters in their direction to to strengthen them because i've received a lot of letters through the last year i've received a lot of letters and i keep every card i keep every one they're starting to mount up but they keep every card because i care about people i care about you i pray a lot behind the scenes i pray when you when you send a request in i pray like it's me going through it are you with me brother branham said you got to step into that man's position to know how he feels so you can have compassion to pray for him so the question is asked he cares for you do you care churches on every corner but do they care you know that's that's that'll be for that's above my pay grade but let me just say this to you i want to be a church that cares i want to be a people that cares [Applause] you've heard me say this before i grew up in a a from a little bitty boy diapered in the message large churches large assembly a lot of preachers coming through a lot of men having a lot of great things to say but even as a little boy i could see who was real and who wasn't [Music] and i wouldn't give you a nickel for for somebody that can quote the message all the way through and the bible all the way through and their tongue is like a silver sword and they're wearing a thousand dollar suit and they're they're all stuffed shirt better than anybody else i wouldn't give you a nickel for that [Applause] but i like a man of god when he walks out of the office you can feel the presence of god emulating through his life and he's humble with it and he would speak to the smallest child in the building [Music] [Applause] are you with me those two little boys right there are tithe payers right there there's two little guys right there but the jordans taught them right they're gonna grow up in this building and be real pillars here they're going to be real pillars in this church i'll never forget one time i was standing beside of jordan whiz at a picnic and he was standing beside of me and you guys was cooking hot dogs remember that we were cooking hot dogs josh she was sampling one and jordan was standing beside of me and heard the voice of the lord saying i'm going to bless him i'm going to bless him i didn't tell him i didn't tell him for maybe a year did i brother jordan i didn't tell him for maybe a year now you say well well ron how how is he going to bless him it's not up to me to ask even ask god but when i look at his children and they're growing up and and i see their tithe envelopes as i take that on sunday night or monday and i begin to go and i lay my hands on it and pray for it and i watch and they're in their own business and as even as little boys and i watch your children i watch your children as i watch them as i watch them growing up i care for them i care for them and i'm only a pastor as a pastor he said well brother ron it maybe it's just about you and your family you're missing the picture amen you're missing the whole picture let me just say this to you if in my little world i can be caring about the most things that i'll not touch very many times but i care about it can i tell you a story i don't want to get on too much storage to get brother gato and myself were getting on a train and there were two kids there were two kids and one of them is brother derek donaldson's grandson from new zealand and he had came to the meeting he heard i was speaking and his company had sent him locally to a training session and he had a weekend off so he came to the meeting and so he comes over the meeting he's backslidden and he comes to the meeting and i just spend a few moments with him because i know him and so in the meeting he gets a supernatural touch you know how that works and he gets a supernatural touch and here he is on the other side of the earth in a meeting in switzerland or in belgium and then there's a girl from arizona and she just felt impressed to go to this meeting and so she didn't take any friends and so she goes to this meeting and she's there and we all meet at the bus stop with brother guido and brother guido's there and here's these two kids and you can tell they hadn't spoke a word to each other not a work it was as though they had never met in their entire lives they've been in the same meeting together and i said have do you guys know each other's name no no no i've never met her and so so i just i just stand there in this hustling bustling uh train depot and i said this is this is this is so and so and this is so and so so they introduce one another and so we go and we we walk about a mile to get on the train and we're all following guido's head and so it's just i've never been in that kind of a situation how many people was in a tunnel in my life and i'm thinking dear god just let me keep up with guido and so we get to the train and we get to the place to where we've got to get on and you know we're carrying our luggage and everything and and he says can i sit with you brother ron i said no no i'm going to sit with guido you sit with her and she said well you know we don't know each other i said this is going to be the most important train ride you've ever made in your life you get the need to get to know each other on this train ride a few months later i get a i get a flyer in the mail we're getting married you guys know something about that business god cares god cares now in his great book he's been getting this one to marry this one and this one to mary this one and this one to mary this one and he's got to get this boy to belgium and get this girl from arizona to belgium and he's got to get them sitting at the same seats on a train for they to discover who they are well that's just coincidental you want another story there's a man in germany and he's walking down the street and he looks over at a girl and he's and he sees something about her she's on the opposite side of the street and he sees her and she has an atmosphere about her and he says i'm going i want to and he actually tells his friend i'm going to marry a girl like her i'm going to marry that girl and the guy says you've never seen her before you've never met her before we're we're leaving the country war is going on well she she winds up in canada in a little bitty town because they have to vacate what are the chances he winds up after the war years later in the same little bitty town and he's walking down the street and he looks across the street and there she is this time he's not going to miss the program and across the street he goes and he goes and he meets her and she's a christian girl and she asked him if he was a christian he don't know anything about god well come to the house and she read him the bible that was their date and she read to him about prophets and scriptures and read to him and when she would finish reading he'd go home but something kept making him go back to the house over and over and over again and finally she says would you like to go to a meeting with me and so they go to a meeting and william branham is a speaker and so he takes his friend with him and they said in the meeting and he said when brother branham said good evening friends good evening let's pray he said he looked over at his friend and said this is a man like i've been listening to in the scriptures he's a prophet now listen this man never been in a church he'd never been in a message meeting and yet something inside of him responded to the first sentences of brother branham speaking and he said this man's a prophet it don't take you six weeks 10 years it just takes a moment hallelujah you say what does that have to do with he cares he watched over that seed [Applause] he watched over that life [Music] i think about brother meadows back here 1966 i may not have all the figures right but he thought he was at the end of his life maybe suicide was just right in front of him and god was dealing with him he didn't realize he'd be one of the pillars of this church his family would be one of the largest of this church and be the inner workings of the community of this church he didn't know nothing about me but his grandson would become my my son-in-law god would not let him commit suicide he had a work for him to do hallelujah sometimes we think when we're starting to get old think well there's nothing left for me to do let me just say this to you your prayers shake the kingdom of hell [Applause] and you may not be able to move your legs but you can talk to god [Applause] brother branham said god don't forget you he said you in those convalescent homes in those nursing homes he hasn't forgot about you there's a land beyond the river oh thank god there's a land beyond the river i'm not going to get to my text but how much has he cared about us how much has he cared about us as a body knowing what we were getting ready to go through last year at this time when sister suzanne she comes to our house to bring some desserts she walks in and i've got a place on my side that's heating up and swelling periodically and getting real hot and i said sister suzanne what do you think about this she said you need to go to the doctor right you need to go to the doctor we go the doctor i go to my family physician wonderful man and so he said we need to check your prostate he walks back in the room and he said ron i'm afraid i'm going to send you down a real dark road he said i'm really sorry so what do you think it is he said i think it's cancer he said but i can't tell you that but i think it's cancer he said i i would dare say it's not just worry but where he thought it was it wasn't so we go to this is okay so we go to after christmas we went to pigeon forge if you don't believe believers go to pigeon forge you probably don't enjoy this church so we go to pigeon forge and so we go to dollywood me and my family we we just took a little time away and we we had just eat beans and greens and and that's to me as good as a steak although if you take me out this evening maybe i'll choose a steak it's okay it's i'm going home but but we walk up the hill and the nurse calls me and she said ron we have we found some things and said we've got some news for you i didn't know what i was getting ready to get into amen you see but before it all started we were getting ready to have our christmas dinner and we're going to have it that evening and and i'm in my office and i'm just busy about life and the lord speaks to me if you will trust me i will use you like never before now you remember when brother branham prayed for that little girl in finland and he said he said they were taking me through the basement of the church and said she's an orphan and she steps out and she kisses his pocket she's an orphan she steps out and kisses his pocket and it made a huge impression on brother branham huge and they're kind of pushing him on and he's looking back at her can i just blend a couple stories here just for you there's a 14 year old girl named ruth which would later become biscuit and she's just in a little shotgun of a church and they're they're pressing brother branham out of the building and huge crowd and they're pressing him out of the building and she stuck behind the door and they're pressing him out of the building and said he just rolled his hand back like this right here and he pronounced a blessing on a 14 year old ruth biscuit amen brother ryan's looking back at that little girl and he's thinking about her she's an orphan what will happen with her and she has a real need wasn't it interesting that god had made such a way that she would be in the prayer line that's right she'd kissed his pocket and now she's in a spot he can help her i tell you what when these thoughts were coming to me this last week i thought about what's such a great god he knowed lazarus had a need he knowed the woman at the well had a need nobody else is going to help him amen ron spencer is getting ready to go through a thing in his life let me just say he could have let me and took me home in my condition he could have took me home in march but he cared enough about me let me just say this to you the miracle could have happened all in a minute or two and it would have been over with i'm going to say something pretty boldly here the miracle could have happened he could have cleaned it out of my brain he could have cleaned it out of my lungs he could have cleaned it out of my organs he could have cleaned it out of my bloodstream he could have did it all in a few seconds but i would have never knew all the layers of cancer and what people go through and the deep prayers that need to be prayed and the emotional journey and the turmoil of devastation had not a faithful high priest walk me through this journey and be with me every moment of the day god don't get glory out of me being sick you know he's not he wishes above all things that prospered me in health but god's made me a promise he's made me a promise i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world how long will you live i don't know but i'll live long enough to watch that woman walk a baby down that aisle hallelujah i'm done i'm done i'm wore out but that's okay so brother on we want more well since i threw up all evening last or evening i'm pretty weak but he cares amen thank you lord what about your
