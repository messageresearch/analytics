[39:00] has been failed and Lord we get ready to
[39:04] take upon this thought that you've
[39:05] placed on our hearts Lord in our minds
[39:09] Lord and I pray that the Holy Spirit
[39:11] would just begin to kind of whip through
[39:13] this place and begin to minister To Us
[39:16] by the preaching of the word father
[39:18] we've had a a week full of events Lord
[39:22] we've had we've had a week where we've
[39:25] we've went through some things we've
[39:26] went through went through weddings we've
[39:28] went through just different parts of our
[39:31] life but Lord now we're here back and
[39:34] this is the greatest part of a
[39:35] Christian's life is to hear the
[39:37] preaching of the word it's not the man
[39:39] but it's the god that is behind the man
[39:42] the voice behind the voice and we pray
[39:44] that heaven would speak tonight Lord I
[39:47] pray that you would move aside both
[39:49] hearer and speaker here tonight and that
[39:51] heaven would Proclaim that you are still
[39:54] alive father we yield our vessels to you
[39:56] everything thing that is that will be
[39:58] done and said in this building here
[40:00] tonight we ask that you would have thine
[40:02] own way for the glory of God's sake we
[40:05] pray that you would Minister to those
[40:07] that are lost I pray that you would bind
[40:10] up the Brokenhearted Lord I know that
[40:13] there's many different situations that
[40:15] are here that many unspoken requests
[40:17] that you need to move on so father we
[40:20] invite you father Lord into this
[40:22] building just now to take complete
[40:24] control of every situation and every
[40:26] spirit
[40:27] that would hinder the children of God
[40:29] from moving into the promises so God we
[40:32] yield our vessels to you and ask father
[40:34] for the furtherance of thy kingdom that
[40:36] the preaching of the word would be sent
[40:38] to this place that is destined to and

[40:57] [Music]
[40:59] verse 13 and also down to uh uh also
[41:05] Hebrews 12:
[41:08] 22 just want to remind everyone uh
[41:11] tomorrow after service we'll be having a
[41:13] baptism here for our brother Dylan
[41:15] shifflet and and so we want to be
[41:17] remembering him because God gave us a
[41:19] promise that if you repent and be
[41:22] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:23] Christ for the remissions of your sins
[41:25] that you shall receive the gift of the
[41:26] Holy Ghost now now we know that that we
[41:29] are to do our part and then God will do
[41:32] his part and I believe with all of my
[41:34] heart that brother Dylan's on a is on on
[41:37] the right path and I'm I'm very proud of
[41:39] him some of the conversations that I've
[41:41] had with him I just be honest with you
[41:43] they're they're quite profound and I'm
[41:45] very I'm very um very moved at how the
[41:49] holy spirit is dealing so it but that
[41:51] that is this is an open invitation if
[41:54] anybody else would like to be baptized
[41:56] and you're here hearing this you just
[41:58] bring your clothes and towels and things
[41:59] with you tomorrow amen let's just go to
[42:02] the word here tonight 2 Corinthians
[42:04] chapter 3 in verse
[42:06] 13 and not as Moses which put a veil
[42:09] over his face that the children of
[42:10] Israel could not steadfastly look at
[42:13] look to the end of that which is
[42:15] abolished but their minds were blinded
[42:18] for until this day remaineth the same
[42:21] veil untaken in the reading of the Old
[42:24] Testament which veil was done away in
[42:27] Christ but even unto this day when Moses
[42:30] is read the veil is upon their heart
[42:33] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[42:36] Lord notice what he what Paul was
[42:38] talking about when the heart is turned
[42:40] to the Lord we know what the message of
[42:43] Malachi 4 is to do it's to turn the
[42:46] hearts when it shall turn to the Lord
[42:49] the veil shall be taken away now the
[42:52] Lord is that spirit and where the spirit
[42:54] of the Lord is there's liberty but we
[42:57] all with open face beholding as in a
[43:01] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[43:06] into the same image from glory to glory
[43:10] even as by the spirit of the Lord
[43:14] Hebrews 12 and verse
[43:22] 22 but you are come unto Mount Zion and
[43:27] under the city of the Living God the
[43:29] heavenly Jerusalem and into an
[43:30] innumerable company of angels to the
[43:33] general assembly and the Church of the
[43:34] firstborn which are written in heaven
[43:37] and to God the judge of all and to the
[43:38] spirits of just men made perfect and to
[43:41] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[43:44] and to the blood of the
[43:45] sprinkling and to the blood of
[43:47] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[43:50] than that of Abel see that you refuse
[43:53] not him that speaketh for if they escape
[43:55] not who refused him
[43:57] that spake on Earth much more shall not
[43:59] we escape if we turn away from him that
[44:02] speaketh from Heaven whose voice then
[44:04] shook the Earth but now he hath promised
[44:07] saying yet once more I shake not the
[44:09] Earth only but also heaven and this word
[44:12] yet once more signifying the removing of
[44:15] those things that are shaken as of
[44:18] things that are made that those things
[44:21] which cannot be shaken May remain
[44:24] wherefore re we receiving a kingom om
[44:28] Paul speaking to the bride of Christ we
[44:30] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[44:32] moved let us have Grace whereby we may
[44:35] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[44:37] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[44:41] fire also Hebrews chapter 6 verse 19
[44:44] we'll just we'll just throw it up on the
[44:46] screen for you which hope we have as an
[44:48] anchor of the soul but sure and
[44:52] steadfast which entereth into that
[44:55] within the Veil may God bless his word
[44:58] you may be seated tonight here in the
[44:59] presence of the Lord I'd like to speak
[45:01] to you by these by these text here
[45:04] tonight uh on a little thought on the
[45:06] veiled Glory the veiled glory and we
[45:09] realize that we are living in a very
[45:11] shaking time but we have received a
[45:14] kingdom that cannot be shaken and that
[45:16] kingdom is that of the Holy Ghost and we
[45:19] realize that that that which has been
[45:21] released here that we realize that it is
[45:23] the deity of almighty God that he is
[45:25] releasing to the body of Jesus Christ
[45:28] and it is not something that is that is
[45:30] a fairy tale it's not something that is
[45:32] fictional or or non-fictional it's not
[45:34] something that that you read about and
[45:36] it's not true it's something that is a
[45:38] living reality and we have seen we have
[45:41] seen God with our own eyes and we have
[45:43] seen what God is doing right here
[45:44] amongst us and it's not something that
[45:47] you have to sit back and wonder at but
[45:49] you realize that the message of the hour
[45:51] came to give you eyesight so that you
[45:53] could see by prophetic vision and pro by
[45:56] prophetic word that you can literally
[45:58] Pierce into the word of God that men
[46:00] have studied for years and years and
[46:02] thousands of years and they've not been
[46:03] able to understand it but because of the
[46:05] Optics that you have been given and the
[46:09] ability to be able to look at that
[46:11] you're able to glare or look into the
[46:13] word of God and see the very Glory of
[46:15] almighty God because when William
[46:16] brandom would come here he was a man
[46:19] that was not of Education he was not a
[46:21] man that was full of wisdom but he was a
[46:22] man that was led by the revelation of
[46:24] the Holy Spirit and brother Brandon
[46:26] would preach preach a preach a sermon
[46:28] before the seals and after the seals of
[46:30] God hiding himself in Simplicity and
[46:33] revealing himself in the same and I
[46:34] think it's amazing that that that
[46:36] brother Brandon would preach that before
[46:38] the seals and he would preach that after
[46:40] the seals and so many people had sat
[46:42] there and wondered and pondered about
[46:44] the Book of Revelations and there are
[46:45] men that theologians that don't even
[46:47] dare touch the word that that book of
[46:49] Revelation because they don't know what
[46:50] to do with it but here a prophet begin
[46:53] to preach and begin to bring out and
[46:55] reveal and make known those things that
[46:57] had been hidden down there for years
[46:59] after years and on the on the front of
[47:01] it and on the back of it he simply says
[47:03] he said God is revealing himself in
[47:06] Simplicity it's so simple that he could
[47:08] take a hillbilly KY and and he could
[47:10] bring forth the word of God and he would
[47:12] release it to a people that would have a
[47:15] understanding as a Son of God and not as
[47:17] a servant of God but they would have the
[47:20] eyesight as a Son of God and it has been
[47:22] said that that the best place in the
[47:24] world to hide something is right in
[47:26] front of
[47:27] it's right in plain view if you want to
[47:29] hide anything you just hide it right
[47:31] there and I think it's one of the
[47:32] greatest attributes about a Christian is
[47:34] that they have the ability to be able to
[47:36] look to be able to look at things as
[47:39] people that are walking by and they see
[47:41] things that the rest of the world see
[47:43] things on the surface but the body of
[47:45] Jesus Christ because of who she is and
[47:47] because of the Revelation that she's
[47:49] under that she can stand there and by
[47:51] the attributes of almighty God that she
[47:53] can see God displaying himself in every
[47:57] form that he would set there because God
[47:59] has given us an anointing in this hour
[48:01] because we realize that in this hour
[48:04] that there's Darkness there's nakedness
[48:06] there's cold and formal Church entity
[48:08] but God has anointed a people with an
[48:11] eyesight to an to an Isa to anoint their
[48:14] eyes so that they could see and God has
[48:16] released something to the body of Jesus
[48:19] Christ so that she would have an
[48:21] understanding that could thwart the
[48:23] enemy when she when the enemy would come
[48:25] up against her she is Anointed with an
[48:27] isaf that she can Pierce through the
[48:29] coldness of Le oosa that she can stand
[48:32] there in the face of all the all the
[48:34] things of Satan and she could stand
[48:36] there by the revealing of the word of
[48:37] God now brother Brandon when he would
[48:39] Pierce into the church ages book brother
[48:41] Brandon would lace it in there in the
[48:43] revelation of Jesus Christ on how
[48:46] important that Revelation is to the
[48:47] believer and he he would said now that
[48:50] Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse
[48:52] which means unveiling and he said this
[48:55] unveiling is perfectly described in the
[48:57] example of a sculptor unveiling his work
[49:00] of Statuary and exposing it to the
[49:02] onlooker he said it is an uncovering
[49:05] that a revelation is an
[49:08] uncovering revealing that which was
[49:11] previously hidden he said now the
[49:13] uncovering is not only the revelation of
[49:15] the person of Christ because many of
[49:18] people have been have the ability to be
[49:19] able to look back and see Jesus of 2,000
[49:22] years ago there's a lot of people that
[49:24] have have great knowledge of the word of
[49:26] what Paul said in those things but this
[49:29] Revelation is not just of Jesus of the
[49:31] person of Christ but it is the
[49:33] revelation of his Future Works in the
[49:36] uncoming seven Church ages and too many
[49:39] times people have the ability to they
[49:41] they have the ability to pierce in
[49:43] through the world uh as as brother
[49:46] brenon would say it like this he said he
[49:47] said man he said is he has they have the
[49:50] ability to get to the moon he said but
[49:52] they walk over a blade of grass and they
[49:54] miss God underneath where their feet you
[49:56] see there's a lot of people that can
[49:58] look past things they can look in the
[50:00] past and they can look in the future and
[50:02] see Jesus but where we want to see Jesus
[50:05] is Jesus right here and Jesus right
[50:08] now I want to find out where God is
[50:11] hiding himself at because I don't want
[50:13] to just look back to what Paul said and
[50:16] I don't want to just look back there and
[50:17] see what Moses saw I want to see what
[50:20] God wants me to see in the hour that
[50:22] we're living in and the veil is where
[50:25] God is hiding himself and and the
[50:27] prophet would say in the Hebrew series
[50:29] he said the veil he said and the veil
[50:32] was who Jesus because Jesus said it's
[50:35] not me that doeth the works but my
[50:37] father said my father that dwelleth in
[50:40] me the work he doeth The Works the
[50:42] father worketh and I worketh hither too
[50:45] here he is as the veiled one Walking In
[50:48] the Flesh God Emmanuel God With Us God
[50:51] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[50:53] himself here he is walking around
[50:57] here he is walking around now he came
[51:01] down and made a San a sanctification or
[51:03] a provision or a propitiation that
[51:06] through his death offered and paid the
[51:08] price of sin that he might come back and
[51:10] dwell in us that then then the faith
[51:13] that we have is a veiled Faith or a
[51:16] veiled
[51:17] person then the faith that we have is a
[51:21] veiled Faith or a veiled person
[51:23] therefore we don't look at the things
[51:24] that we see in this Veil this Veil right
[51:27] here we don't look at the things that we
[51:30] see in this Veil but we look at the
[51:32] things but the veil he said we don't
[51:34] look at the things that we see in this
[51:36] Veil he said the ve this veil has
[51:38] education and it does things and it
[51:40] speaks things he said it's a scientific
[51:42] thing he said but the spirit of the
[51:44] Living God that dwells in here cause
[51:47] those things which were not as though
[51:49] they were if God said so there is your
[51:52] veiling we are in that Veil we're in
[51:57] that Veil you know I know that the veil
[51:59] this Veil right here has a lot of
[52:01] disappointments this veil has sickness
[52:03] this veil has mistakes this veil has
[52:06] torment but this Veil also hides the
[52:09] power of almighty God you can look at
[52:11] William brandom and William Bram always
[52:13] hated being short he hated being less of
[52:16] a man than some people you remember when
[52:18] he would standing there and that that
[52:19] man that cowboy came in there and he
[52:21] sneezed so loud that it shook the whole
[52:23] room he said that's a real man right
[52:25] there William brandham as the as the as
[52:27] the man looked at things and wished he
[52:29] was taller wished he was this way but
[52:32] notice where did them squirrels come
[52:34] from how did them storms get spoke out
[52:37] of existence it was because there was a
[52:39] power that was behind the veil it was
[52:42] beholding the glory of almighty God that
[52:45] many can't see but behind that veil was
[52:49] the glory and the power Hallelujah
[52:58] how many get disappointed at their
[53:01] Veil how many get disappointed that you
[53:03] get sick and you constantly go back
[53:05] through it and you have you have the
[53:06] constant cycles that you got to break
[53:08] through and press through but in that
[53:10] Veil is there is a power that is going
[53:13] to break the Cycles in life in that Veil
[53:16] is the power that has has the ability to
[53:18] accept God's healing power over your
[53:20] life in that Veil
[53:22] Hallelujah in that Veil is where God is
[53:25] going to display his attributes of of
[53:27] miraculous healings and and
[53:29] determination and demonstration and the
[53:32] power of the Holy Ghost is right out of
[53:34] the veil that you're so disappointed
[53:38] in but I love what the scripture says in
[53:41] 1 John 2 and 20 but you have an unction
[53:44] that you have an anointing from the Holy
[53:46] One and you know all things that Jesus
[53:50] that Jesus would even say except you
[53:53] believe that I am he you will die in
[53:55] your sins so if you can't believe that I
[53:58] am he you are absolutely lost so he is
[54:01] saying he said I am a revelation if you
[54:04] can't understand that who I am is deity
[54:07] in flesh then you're lost you see
[54:10] because he had to be more than a man he
[54:13] had to be more than a prophet he had to
[54:15] be more than just the theologians he had
[54:17] to be God it took a revelation to be
[54:20] able to see that this was almighty God
[54:23] Elohim dwelling in flesh
[54:28] prophets were the flesh that God would
[54:31] dwell in and men would
[54:34] recognize men would recognize that that
[54:36] was more than just a ordinary man that
[54:38] was made out of the same elements that
[54:40] that human beings were made out of
[54:42] because they recognized that when a
[54:43] prophet was speaking that a man's words
[54:46] won't act like that when Elijah would
[54:48] prophesy and Isaiah would prophesy and
[54:51] and job would prophesy they recognize
[54:53] that that was more than just a man but
[54:55] that man words had the power behind it
[54:59] that of a prophet Messenger to be able
[55:01] to speak things because Moses could
[55:04] stand there and and and Daniel could
[55:06] stay stand there and they could preach
[55:08] and they could prophesy and they could
[55:10] pray and Supernatural events would take
[55:12] place it was a sign that God was veiling
[55:15] himself because man's words won't act
[55:17] that
[55:18] way but it was the mind of almighty God
[55:22] that Jesus was going to hide himself he
[55:25] was going to hide himself self in a veil
[55:27] of humanity that's where God wanted to
[55:29] dwell
[55:30] in he could have chose anything to
[55:33] preach the message he could have chos
[55:35] the Stars to preach the message but what
[55:37] he wanted was Humanity to preach the
[55:40] message and Satan has tried his very
[55:42] best ever since the Garden of Eden to
[55:45] stop that Veil notice what William
[55:47] Brandon would say when he coming down to
[55:49] the closing hours of 1965 he said it was
[55:52] a lust Veil that FL that fell over Adam
[55:55] and Eve eyes so they were looking
[55:57] through that eyes they were looking
[55:59] through that Veil but you have a
[56:01] different Veil you have a holy Veil that
[56:03] is over your eyes you can't see what the
[56:06] world sees you can't understand like the
[56:08] world understands but you have been
[56:10] given a holy Veil to look through and
[56:13] see the mind of Christ and ever since
[56:16] the Garden of Eden Satan has tried to
[56:18] stop this Veil he has tried to stop Adam
[56:21] he tried to stop Abraham he tried to
[56:23] stop Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and
[56:26] Moses and David and Daniel and he tried
[56:29] to stop the veil and many of times he
[56:31] did stop the veil but he could not stop
[56:33] the glory that was behind the veil David
[56:37] failed but the glory didn't fall Moses
[56:39] had a temper but the glory didn't fall
[56:42] Daniel had weaknesses job had failures
[56:46] but the glory that was in The
[56:49] Veil The Glory that was in the veil
[56:52] could not fail
[56:56] ah do you hear me Satan you can stop the
[56:59] veil but you'll never stop the glory
[57:02] come on somebody you can shut up tapes
[57:05] you can shut up microphones but you'll
[57:07] never stop the
[57:13] glory I feel like preaching
[57:17] tonight and when Jesus came he was God
[57:20] in
[57:21] flesh and they knew that that
[57:25] man that God was with him even
[57:28] Nicodemus was a high ranking official in
[57:31] the church he knew he came to him in
[57:33] night time he came to him in secrecy and
[57:36] he began to talk to him and said look
[57:38] Master we know that no man can do the
[57:41] works that you're doing except God be
[57:44] with him you see you see he knew that
[57:47] there was something special there was
[57:49] something more than what he saw and what
[57:51] he read about in David and what he read
[57:53] about over in the book of Moses he knew
[57:56] there was something special that the
[57:58] very word that had been written that
[58:01] Moses would say that God is going to
[58:03] raise up a prophet La unto me here he
[58:06] was standing in the flesh but he
[58:08] couldn't understand how that power got
[58:10] on the inside of him even Jesus after he
[58:13] raises Lazarus from the grave he's
[58:16] standing there he's standing there in
[58:18] John chapter 12 and they're having a
[58:20] banquet and a feast and Lazarus is
[58:22] standing there and brother bandman said
[58:24] it in one way he said they came to that
[58:26] banquet not to see Jesus but they came
[58:29] there to see the witness they came there
[58:31] to see the witness of the power of Jesus
[58:34] Christ come on somebody you didn't show
[58:37] up here to see William brandham you
[58:39] showed up to see the power of William
[58:41] brandom's
[58:47] message come on somebody I don't need to
[58:49] see had Sons I don't need to see them
[58:52] Three Squirrels I don't see Nei I don't
[58:54] need to see a storm spoke out of
[58:56] Colorado I don't need to see that but
[58:58] what I need to see is the glory hidden
[59:01] in my
[59:05] vessel Hallelujah you could stop us you
[59:08] could stop and try to stop us with all
[59:10] of your might but you'll never stop the
[59:12] glory you could put Lazarus in the grave
[59:15] but the glory got him out of
[59:18] it
[59:21] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[59:23] Lord you can try to put it some some in
[59:25] some cre or some denomination and try to
[59:28] put us in a box that we're just another
[59:30] church but you can't have the
[59:35] glory what is it it's his glory veiled
[59:40] in your
[59:45] flesh and the Bible said and there were
[59:48] certain
[59:50] Greeks they came and said we would see
[59:55] Jesus where would I point him to today
[59:57] brother Doug I wouldn't Point him to
[59:59] some nail scarred hands I wouldn't Point
[1:00:02] him to some Cross I'd Point him to you I
[1:00:05] want to see Jesus I want to see his
[1:00:08] power and I love what what Jesus begin
[1:00:11] to teach them he said except a corn of
[1:00:13] wheat would fall into the ground and die
[1:00:16] it abideth alone but if it die bringeth
[1:00:18] forth he was telling them I am who
[1:00:21] you're looking for but they couldn't
[1:00:24] understand that that was him they were
[1:00:28] looking at him they saw him but they
[1:00:31] couldn't see God I love what the Bible
[1:00:34] said in John 12:37 but though he had
[1:00:37] done so many miracles before them yet
[1:00:40] they believed not on him that the saying
[1:00:43] of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled
[1:00:45] which he spake Lord who ha believed our
[1:00:48] report and to whom of the Lord and to
[1:00:51] whom hath the Lord that the arm of the
[1:00:52] Lord had been revealed therefore they
[1:00:56] could not
[1:00:57] believe because Isaiah said again he
[1:01:01] hath blinded their eyes and hardened
[1:01:03] their heart so they could not see with
[1:01:06] their eyes nor understand with their
[1:01:08] heart and be converted and I said heal
[1:01:10] them these things said Isaias when he
[1:01:13] saw his glory now how did Isaiah say
[1:01:19] them things and they were happening
[1:01:21] right there in John chapter 12 some 900
[1:01:23] years later he was looking at the glory
[1:01:27] that neither fadeth away or goeth
[1:01:32] away every they were looking at him how
[1:01:35] are you doing these Miracles then they
[1:01:38] could not see God brother Chester they
[1:01:40] just saw a man they wondered how he got
[1:01:43] that power whence does a man have this
[1:01:45] kind of a power whence who who who has
[1:01:48] the ability to stop the Suns and stop
[1:01:51] the storms and and speak to the winds
[1:01:53] and they obey him how did he get this
[1:01:55] power
[1:01:56] they looked on it and said how did that
[1:01:58] power get on the inside of that vessel
[1:02:01] that's what Legion was looking at that's
[1:02:04] what Legion was looking at he seen a
[1:02:06] veil but there was something that was
[1:02:09] ordained on the inside of that man that
[1:02:12] had a name of Legion at that time he was
[1:02:14] ordained not to see the veil but to see
[1:02:17] God in a
[1:02:24] man Hallelujah
[1:02:28] they were predestinated to be
[1:02:31] blinded because a prophet saw it but you
[1:02:35] are predestinated to see
[1:02:39] it I'd have myself a shout right
[1:02:43] there I can't unsee this I can't unsee
[1:02:46] the mercies of God I can't unsee his
[1:02:49] power still the same I can't unse that
[1:02:51] he I can't unsee that God still gives
[1:02:53] the Holy Ghost I can't unsee that God
[1:02:56] still delivers from alcoholism and
[1:02:59] delivers from drugs and delivers from
[1:03:01] bondage I can't unse it because I'm
[1:03:03] predestinated to see it because there
[1:03:06] has been an invisible Union that has
[1:03:08] transpired in this generation and we're
[1:03:11] Justified as if we never done it in the
[1:03:13] first place I can't go back to water
[1:03:16] down God dogmas and Creeds and
[1:03:19] denominations I've been Justified I
[1:03:22] never did it in the first place come on
[1:03:24] somebody you was never in God's mind a
[1:03:28] Catholic or a presbyterian or a
[1:03:30] Methodist or a Baptist you was always a
[1:03:33] son of almighty
[1:03:36] God and God has veiled himself in that
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:49] Tabernacle he said God was failed in the
[1:03:52] form of a man and he hid himself from
[1:03:55] the
[1:03:57] view I love this he hid himself from
[1:04:00] their view they could only see a man but
[1:04:04] those predestinated to sing God now
[1:04:06] notice what he says here he said one saw
[1:04:08] a man and the other saw God he said it
[1:04:12] was God veiled in the human being making
[1:04:15] both of them
[1:04:19] right making both of them right but your
[1:04:23] faith in that what you do not not see
[1:04:26] you believe it
[1:04:29] anyhow they seen the same Veil Peter saw
[1:04:32] the same Veil The in Greek saw but Peter
[1:04:35] saw something more than the church World
[1:04:38] saw when this message came by my way I
[1:04:42] saw something different than the heads
[1:04:44] of the theologians saw I saw Jesus
[1:04:49] Christ I didn't see some man I didn't
[1:04:52] see some Creed I didn't see some idea I
[1:04:55] saw Jes
[1:04:59] Jesus he was in that
[1:05:02] flesh and that flesh was his
[1:05:05] Veil and the veil was
[1:05:08] rent that
[1:05:10] God might be made
[1:05:17] manifest the Roman
[1:05:19] power was trying to stop the
[1:05:23] veil but they could not stop the clo
[1:05:29] come on Church you look what Catholicism
[1:05:31] is doing today they are trying to stop
[1:05:34] the veil they're not just trying to work
[1:05:36] they're not just trying to work over
[1:05:38] there in Rome they are working through
[1:05:40] the umbilical cord of baptism and it's
[1:05:44] trying to stop the
[1:05:47] glory come on somebody Roman it don't
[1:05:49] you be scared of Communism don't you be
[1:05:52] scared of socialism don't you be scared
[1:05:54] of that you watch Roman ISM watch's that
[1:05:57] power trying to creep in there and give
[1:05:59] you a tradition instead of the word of
[1:06:01] God hallelujah but you are predestinated
[1:06:05] not to take the Seal of the mark of a
[1:06:06] beast but to take the
[1:06:08] Seal of the Holy
[1:06:14] Ghost it's like Solomon when he's
[1:06:16] standing
[1:06:18] there and he's hiding the very Glory of
[1:06:21] almighty
[1:06:23] God and news starts traveling
[1:06:26] that there's a man up there that God is
[1:06:29] anointing and
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:31] using the veil was Solomon but the power
[1:06:35] was from God he had the knowledge and
[1:06:37] the wisdom to be able to decipher and
[1:06:39] tell and discern things he had the
[1:06:42] ability but that wasn't his ability that
[1:06:45] was God's ability in the veil of
[1:06:48] humanity and everybody that ever has a
[1:06:50] god-given gift it is not the man it was
[1:06:54] not William brandham come on somebody
[1:06:56] it's not Donnie Reagan it's not Tim Bru
[1:07:00] it's not Ron Spencer it's the glory
[1:07:02] Behind the Veil come on somebody I don't
[1:07:05] care who you are and what your name is
[1:07:08] if you're a son and daughter of God and
[1:07:10] you have the same Holy Ghost the same
[1:07:13] power you can be a little bitty old
[1:07:15] mother standing up there in a balcony
[1:07:17] and pray for a baby and God work his
[1:07:20] Works he is veiling
[1:07:23] himself Hallelujah
[1:07:28] what did she
[1:07:30] see what did this woman
[1:07:33] see I love what brother random said she
[1:07:35] was a heathen but she was ordained to
[1:07:38] see
[1:07:39] it brother brandom said it like this he
[1:07:41] said she was a heathen but she was
[1:07:43] ordained to life she hearded it others
[1:07:46] might have heard it and paid no
[1:07:47] attention to it oh nonsense is a bunch
[1:07:49] of holy rollers but she believed
[1:07:52] it there was something on the inside of
[1:07:55] her that said that sounds awful
[1:08:01] good oh Hallelujah maybe you turned on a
[1:08:04] tape and you heard good evening friends
[1:08:06] and he said oh that sounds awful
[1:08:09] good come on somebody he is veiling
[1:08:12] himself he veiled himself in Malachi 4
[1:08:15] but where is that voice taking us in
[1:08:17] this
[1:08:19] day how'd you get here how'd you find
[1:08:23] your position how'd you get in this case
[1:08:25] how did you get here why do you believe
[1:08:27] like you believe how do you stand Toe to
[1:08:29] Toe to Satan after war after attack
[1:08:32] after after all these things stand there
[1:08:34] it's because you are hungry to see the
[1:08:37] almighty God revealed in your flesh
[1:08:40] because if you could have gave up you'd
[1:08:42] already gave up but because God put
[1:08:45] something on the inside of you he
[1:08:47] ordained you to
[1:08:50] life you don't even know how it got
[1:08:52] there but that power got there Brother
[1:08:54] David it was God's for knowledge that
[1:08:57] put that on the inside of you he saw you
[1:09:00] when you was at your worst but he's also
[1:09:02] saw you at your
[1:09:05] [Applause]
[1:09:13] best the Bible says in First Kings
[1:09:17] chapter 19 and verse
[1:09:19] 9 and he came thither into a cave and
[1:09:23] lodged there be behold the word of the
[1:09:26] Lord came to him and he said unto him
[1:09:28] what doest thou he Elijah and he said I
[1:09:30] have been very jealous for the Lord God
[1:09:32] of hosts for the Lord of Israel ha
[1:09:34] forsaken thy Covenant and thrown down
[1:09:36] thine altars and slain the prophets with
[1:09:39] a sword and I even I only am left and
[1:09:42] they seek my life to take it away and he
[1:09:45] said go forth and stand upon the
[1:09:48] mountain before the Lord and behold the
[1:09:51] Lord passed by in a great strong wind
[1:09:53] and rent the mountains and breaking es
[1:09:55] the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord
[1:09:58] was not in the wind and after the wind
[1:10:00] and earthquake but the Lord was not in
[1:10:02] the earthquake and after the earthquake
[1:10:04] a fire but the Lord was not in the fire
[1:10:07] and after the fire a still Small Voice
[1:10:10] notice and it was so that when Elijah
[1:10:13] heard it what did he hear what did he
[1:10:16] hear he heard a voice that he wrapped
[1:10:19] his face in the mountain in the manle
[1:10:21] and went out and stood in the entering
[1:10:22] of the cave and behold there came a
[1:10:24] voice unto him and said said what doest
[1:10:26] thou here Elijah if you want to go down
[1:10:28] there and read the rest of that you're
[1:10:29] going to you're going to find where I'm
[1:10:30] getting ready to take you but I don't
[1:10:31] want to read no further but this quote
[1:10:34] that I'm getting ready to to to bring to
[1:10:36] your attention it's a quote that was
[1:10:39] from a collection of brother brandom's
[1:10:40] handwritten sermon
[1:10:42] notes which is on display in in William
[1:10:45] Brandon's Memorial Library there in
[1:10:47] Tucson Arizona and he titled this set of
[1:10:50] notes the glory of the Lord but brother
[1:10:54] brandham went on to be with the Lord
[1:10:56] before he could preach this message and
[1:10:59] I've got I've got the I've got a picture
[1:11:01] and the brother said it wouldn't it
[1:11:02] wouldn't show up there so if you want
[1:11:04] that picture I'll give it to you uh it
[1:11:07] was in one of them if you want to it was
[1:11:10] uh George Smith and them and uh sister
[1:11:12] Rebecca Smith they they put it out in
[1:11:13] them only believe only believe magazines
[1:11:15] you you remember some of you some of you
[1:11:17] remember them books notice here's what
[1:11:19] brother Ram had written down he said
[1:11:21] notice him Elijah in the cave he said
[1:11:25] the Oneness
[1:11:27] storm he said Billy Graham with Earth
[1:11:30] shaking campaigns he said R Robert the
[1:11:34] Pentecostal Russian wind notice go back
[1:11:37] to First Kings 19 he said notice the
[1:11:40] winds came by there and it did not
[1:11:43] attract his attention are you with me
[1:11:46] the Earth shaking campaigns came by the
[1:11:50] way and it never moved the prophets they
[1:11:53] were only effects of his p passing by he
[1:11:56] said but what attracted the Prophet
[1:11:59] Elijah come on somebody I want to know
[1:12:02] what attracted the Prophet Elijah he's
[1:12:06] in his prophetic office he is a
[1:12:08] prophetic voice to that generation he is
[1:12:11] a Ministry that God is going to use over
[1:12:14] five times throughout every single one
[1:12:16] of his
[1:12:18] ages but what attracted the Prophet
[1:12:23] Elijah how'd you get here
[1:12:25] it was the glory of his voice word he
[1:12:29] was revealing his glory plans he said
[1:12:33] the prophet waited on his office if Lord
[1:12:36] gives me if the Lord gives me
[1:12:37] opportunity I want to preach on this set
[1:12:39] of notes for a little
[1:12:41] bit he was revealing his glory plans he
[1:12:44] said the prophet waited on his office
[1:12:47] not as a type he said notice notice as a
[1:12:50] type not long then to the rapture
[1:12:55] he was only near in the wind the
[1:12:58] earthquake the fire Etc but the man of
[1:13:01] God waited for the manifested
[1:13:04] reality notice how he goes on the
[1:13:07] Vindicated word abiding Glory notice
[1:13:12] when the abiding Glory comes it's not
[1:13:14] long until the Rapture
[1:13:17] then Elijah was up there and he thought
[1:13:20] he was the only one he thought he was
[1:13:23] the only one that was going to go in but
[1:13:25] God be to reveal his glory pans to him
[1:13:28] and show him he wasn't the only one up
[1:13:31] there what did he do he said there's
[1:13:33] 7,000 more down there just like Elijah
[1:13:36] they believe the same message they
[1:13:38] worship the same God they have not bowed
[1:13:41] down to ba and the gods of leosia but
[1:13:44] there is a people that is
[1:13:46] predestinated they are going to believe
[1:13:48] you they are going to follow you there's
[1:13:51] a man down there that you're going to
[1:13:53] anoint and you're going to throw your
[1:13:54] man on over on
[1:13:56] him he's going to have a double portion
[1:13:59] ask for a double p double portion he's
[1:14:02] going to carry on your message and
[1:14:04] you're going to transfer your anointing
[1:14:07] over unto
[1:14:10] him come on somebody what did God give
[1:14:13] to us not Elijah's Spirit he gave us his
[1:14:18] Spirit come on somebody we are way past
[1:14:21] the days of Elijah's Manel and Elisha's
[1:14:24] Manel but what has been given to the
[1:14:26] Church of the Living God is the manle of
[1:14:29] the Holy
[1:14:31] Ghost What attracted Elijah to it it was
[1:14:34] the glory it was the voice the glory of
[1:14:37] his
[1:14:38] voice what brought you here but in the
[1:14:41] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:14:44] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:14:47] of God shall be
[1:14:49] finished and I heard a voice saying unto
[1:14:52] me go and take the book I out of the
[1:14:55] hand of the voice I take that book out
[1:14:58] of the hand of the
[1:15:02] Angel he veiled his
[1:15:05] glory in his
[1:15:08] voice his voice caught the attention of
[1:15:11] the
[1:15:13] elect his voice he veiled his glory in
[1:15:16] the voice of the seventh
[1:15:22] angel but now he's revealing his glory
[1:15:24] plan
[1:15:27] now he's revealing his glory
[1:15:30] plans it wasn't just William bram's
[1:15:33] message it's your message it wasn't just
[1:15:36] a oneman
[1:15:38] message come on somebody but now it's a
[1:15:41] Min member bride is that right what is
[1:15:44] it now his glory plans are a bride's
[1:15:47] body veiled with his
[1:15:51] glory the same Glory that was in Elijah
[1:15:54] was in Elisha and the same power and the
[1:15:58] same spirit that was in Jesus is the
[1:16:00] same power and the same spirit that is
[1:16:02] now given unto you by
[1:16:04] measure by the Holy Ghost you remember
[1:16:08] when God God was up there on the
[1:16:10] mountain with
[1:16:13] Moses and he's revealing him the very
[1:16:16] secrets of his heart and he's he's up
[1:16:18] there he's up there and he's getting
[1:16:20] plans from almighty God how to build the
[1:16:22] Tabernacle and he's laying out his
[1:16:24] Commandments he's lining out all of his
[1:16:26] judgments he's lining out all of his
[1:16:27] Commandments and the word of the Lord
[1:16:30] spoke unto them that that if an animal
[1:16:32] or a man even touch the mountain where
[1:16:34] the glory of God was you had to thrust
[1:16:36] that animal through so that you cannot
[1:16:39] touch the anointed of the Lord the glory
[1:16:41] of the Lord can only be handled by the
[1:16:44] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit knows
[1:16:47] where to drop his glory off that that's
[1:16:50] why he has seen you not going down in
[1:16:52] feet but going in
[1:16:57] Rapture I love what the prophet said he
[1:17:00] said if that was glorious he said but
[1:17:03] what about this Glory he said if that
[1:17:05] was veiled by a natural Veil he said and
[1:17:09] here we are veiled by a spiritual Veil
[1:17:11] Veil he said don't try to look at the
[1:17:13] natural he said but break into the
[1:17:16] spirit and see where you're at and what
[1:17:19] hour that we're living in I realize what
[1:17:23] hour that we're living in right now
[1:17:25] because I realize that we're on Saturday
[1:17:27] night and your Veil is wore
[1:17:31] out I understand that I understand
[1:17:34] you've had a hard week I understand that
[1:17:36] you've you've had many ups and downs and
[1:17:38] have a lot of mental battles you've
[1:17:39] you've had physical battles as well but
[1:17:42] do you realize that a prophet would say
[1:17:45] that it's it's it's your Veil it's a
[1:17:48] spiritual Veil and I love what the
[1:17:50] prophet says he said this Veil it's
[1:17:54] hiding God from you he said that's the
[1:17:56] thing that's keeping you from enjoying
[1:17:59] it all do you realize that your Veil
[1:18:03] right now your flesh is keeping you from
[1:18:06] enjoying your
[1:18:08] Victory your Veil right now is keeping
[1:18:11] you from enjoying the glory of the Lord
[1:18:14] you literally have the ability by the
[1:18:17] Holy Spirit dwelling on the inside of
[1:18:19] you to make your Veil obey your F oey
[1:18:23] obey your spirit
[1:18:26] this Veil I'm giving you Prophet words
[1:18:29] it's hiding God from you it's that thing
[1:18:32] that's keeping you from enjoying it all
[1:18:34] y you say well I I shout and I jump up
[1:18:36] and down he said every word he believed
[1:18:39] every word but one he said it's the full
[1:18:42] word of God the promise of this hour
[1:18:44] made
[1:18:45] manifest so if this Veil is keeping me
[1:18:49] from enjoying it all and God is greater
[1:18:53] than my flesh
[1:18:55] how much more can the Holy Spirit make
[1:18:58] my veil obey his
[1:19:02] word what makes you amen the word what
[1:19:05] makes you stand up to the preaching of
[1:19:07] the word what makes you obey it it's the
[1:19:10] V it's the glory within the
[1:19:13] veil Moses was a man like you and I he
[1:19:17] was a prophet but he was more than a
[1:19:20] prophet he was a prophet messenger that
[1:19:23] God was going to use his lips to speak
[1:19:27] mouth to
[1:19:29] mouth God would speak mouth to mouth to
[1:19:31] Moses and then God would speak through
[1:19:34] the lips of Moses right to the church
[1:19:38] notice what it says in Exodus 4:15 and
[1:19:41] thou shalt speak unto him and put words
[1:19:44] in his mouth and I will be thy mouth and
[1:19:47] be with his mouth and will teach you
[1:19:50] what you shall do and he talking about
[1:19:53] Aaron shall be thy
[1:19:55] spokesman because Moses had come up with
[1:19:58] all of these excuses of why he couldn't
[1:20:01] do
[1:20:02] it brother Barham said that Moses was
[1:20:05] cured right
[1:20:10] there I don't see it brother Andrew
[1:20:13] because Moses was a man that was full of
[1:20:15] wisdom and knowledge down there in Egypt
[1:20:17] he had the abilities he had the mindset
[1:20:19] of it all but when he got up before the
[1:20:21] pillar of fire he had every excuse in
[1:20:23] the world brother brandham said he was
[1:20:25] cured right there he said and he shall
[1:20:28] be thy spokesman under the people and he
[1:20:30] shall be even he shall be to thee
[1:20:32] instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to
[1:20:34] him instead of God so Aaron was going to
[1:20:37] be Moses's prophet and Moses was going
[1:20:40] to become a word become a God by the
[1:20:42] word of God being placed in his mouth
[1:20:46] notice when he come down off of that
[1:20:48] mountain the people seen something that
[1:20:51] happened that God had veiled himself in
[1:20:54] his prophet so that they couldn't even
[1:20:56] look on him because the glory of the
[1:20:58] Lord was so great on
[1:21:01] Moses that Moses had to Avil himself
[1:21:06] because of the glory that was that was
[1:21:09] extr extruding from his life that God
[1:21:11] veiled himself in his Prophet to speak
[1:21:14] his words to them Moses was that Living
[1:21:17] Word to the people veiled by the pillar
[1:21:21] of
[1:21:22] fire I what do you get that brother
[1:21:25] answer brother randam said he was veiled
[1:21:28] by the pillar of fire in Moses he said
[1:21:31] which was later to be veiled in behind
[1:21:34] Badger
[1:21:39] skins if I'm want to hide something and
[1:21:42] hide it in plain
[1:21:47] view so if I literally want to hide the
[1:21:49] greatest gift of all
[1:21:52] humankind I'll hide it in sister
[1:21:58] Devon now who's going to imagine it's
[1:22:00] going to be in
[1:22:05] there let's get real who's going to
[1:22:08] imagine it's going to get on the inside
[1:22:09] of
[1:22:12] Dylan how how how how can he get in that
[1:22:15] guy by the name of Jordan Martin how how
[1:22:17] can he get in there now surely if God is
[1:22:21] speaking to Moses up there on that
[1:22:23] mountain and he's already had a word
[1:22:25] with him and told him you're going to
[1:22:26] come back to this mountain and you're
[1:22:27] going to worship me and now he's here
[1:22:30] and he comes down there said now you
[1:22:32] build me this Tabernacle and I'm going
[1:22:34] to live in that Tabernacle I'm going to
[1:22:36] dwell in that Tabernacle and on the top
[1:22:38] of that Tabernacle it's going to be the
[1:22:41] worst and the most ugliest
[1:22:44] animals that's going to hide who God all
[1:22:50] Mighty how could that power get on the
[1:22:54] ins side of an animal like
[1:22:59] you come on some have you ever studied
[1:23:02] out of Bater they're the meanest animals
[1:23:06] they will fight to the death they are
[1:23:09] they they're they're their rank in their
[1:23:12] flesh they're nasty
[1:23:15] creatures but this is going to be the
[1:23:18] skin that God wants to hide himself
[1:23:22] behind and some of you was low down some
[1:23:25] of you was murderers some of you was
[1:23:30] idolatrous but God was going to hide
[1:23:34] himself behind the greatest
[1:23:38] Veil they missed it they missed it in
[1:23:41] Jesus they missed it in William Branham
[1:23:44] and I dare say they missed it in you
[1:23:50] [Applause]
[1:23:58] how'd that power get in there how'd that
[1:24:00] power get on the inside of that boot
[1:24:02] liger son that would have been a
[1:24:03] murderer would have been a murder if God
[1:24:06] didn't stop that rifle he would have
[1:24:08] been a murderer he meant to kill them
[1:24:10] boys but God was not going to let the
[1:24:13] veil stop the
[1:24:15] glory come on somebody you was in drugs
[1:24:19] you was in alcohol but God was not going
[1:24:21] to let your Veil stop the glory
[1:24:25] so God changed the skins and put himself
[1:24:30] on the inside of
[1:24:31] [Applause]
[1:24:33] you there's his glory
[1:24:36] [Applause]

[1:28:01] Bible and there's couple pages that are
[1:28:03] sticking there together remember the
[1:28:05] priest had come to brother Brandon and
[1:28:07] hands him his Bible and he tells the
[1:28:09] prophet said Be steady God is fixing a
[1:28:12] move and out of there brother brandom
