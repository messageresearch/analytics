TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] a man did you believe what you just saw a mint certainly good to be in the house of the Lord in it a man you enjoy last night I sure enjoyed it I've been feeding on it today and and looking forward to this afternoon service when I pray for the kids as they're coming home they're not too far away now and so but they're already tuned in and watching and so I just got a clip of them rejoicing with you as you were singing so we just we want to thank the Lord for that want to want you to remember by the Windell Martin's church they had dedications services this weekend and brand-spankin'-new church but the temperate speaking there this morning and a huge storm that's tornado alley in Oklahoma and a huge storm came through there and flooded that brand new building so a man you can imagine their disappointment today and it happened just before church time and so they were able to move the church you know you're not going to stop God so and so this will be it just a little bit of a deal to where they'll have to clean up the church and get everything back in order but they're our brothers and sisters and so we want to remember them that as they're going through that I prayed for him this morning brother Tim called me and asked me to go to prayer for it and so we prayed today as a family and so I would like for you to continue to remember them in prayer the Windell Martin is by the Shawn Martin's brother and they're just a wonderful family he's a wonderful singer and preacher and so we just we want to pray for them as a body of believers amen didn't God good to us never said we wouldn't have trouble but he said he'd be with us through the truth so I'm really thankful for that because sometimes I think man you know you would think after a while you beat yourself up do I not have faith or am i doing the wrong thing and you just realize that everybody around you is got trouble everybody's got trouble because we're born of man and few days and full of trouble but our promises that gotta be with us and so we just thank the Lord for that tonight god bless you you'll turn with me in your scriptures tonight in st. John chapter 18 in verse 36 I want to read one scripture I want to continue with the same thought last as we had last night commissioned to speak a man a couple services like this the devil realizes I got a real problem on my hand these people get what they're hearing if they get what they're hearing I got a problem amen and Jesus is standing in a dimension and explaining how powerful he was John 18 verse 36 and jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world I want to identify myself as that tonight my kingdom is not of this world you see I carry a citizenship of the United States of America and a passport and all of my identification and it says my address the United States of America but my kingdom is not from here if my kingdom were of this world then Ron Spencer would be here to fight did you get it then my servants would fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from him I want you to just notice he looked at the word to see what the word said about himself and he believed it sums 16 and verse 9 therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices my flesh also shall rest in hope for thou will not suffer will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption Jesus new I don't need to buy tomb I'm not gonna be there long 2nd corinthians 4 and verse 17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding ly eternal weight of glory 2nd corinthians 4 and verse 8 we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed let's pray Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts tonight Lord as I read this word and just think about what's laying right in front of us I get so excited Lord Jesus I just ask you that you would bless your people Lord as they hear this word tonight to be with our young people as they're driving home father this evening Lord and I ask you that you'd be by the window Martin's church and the people that have gathered for that meeting there in Oklahoma brother temperate our buddy that's that's preached the meeting this morning and Lord I just ask you that you would be with them father Lord we just pray that you would just meet our needs this afternoon and touch our hearts we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen and amen you can be seated amen brother Brent says when a man becomes a Christian God gives him a checkbook it's an unlimited account that goes with this checkbook it's already signed by Jesus Christ but you have to fill it out brother bad make a couple of statements and he says and she knows what he wants done with the word comes down and he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army now this wasn't to the denominational system that didn't know what they were in or out or up and down or they didn't know what scripture to take power out of it or what what spar what parts inspired but this is the bride to Jesus Christ this is the power that's been given to the bride of Jesus Christ and I believe I'm one of them and I believe that I'm one of them are you with me now we believe that he's King and Ben we're part of him were queen are you with me he conquered and we received Oh hallelujah now that the random said this he says God's given given every sick person in here divine healing every one of you Jesus was wounded for our transgressions and with His stripes we were healed it's yours but you'll have to fight for every inch that you possess everywhere the soles of your feet travel God told Joshua I've given it you footprints means possessions he said let's go in footprints means it's possession let's take every inch of ground that's God given us if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promise is unto you under your children to them that's afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call footprints this possession let's go get it it's ours Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever less possess it it's God's promise don't look at the circumstances don't look how hard it is possess the land we'll have a meeting like this morning we were having a meeting there and the Holy Ghost was falling into place and people were screaming and shouting and praising the Lord and then someone came up and said pray for me brother branham and I laid hands on them and I prayed for him and I said go and believe are you with me there was power there to set him free and he kind of walked away with a miracle but God challenges us to believe here's what it is it's easy to feel the power of God to see when you believe it he said but when it comes to a showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess that you have this is a powerful statement I want you to get it and when it comes to a showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess that you have I want you to understand tonight Satan he don't Bluff easy he knows whether you got it or not little Ouya the thing of it is brother we gotta get it we gotta take it it's ours but you have to fight for every inch of the ground Joshua fought for every inch of the ground from one of them once end of the country to the other but he had a promise that God said I give it to you he said whether there's Giants whether there's atheists whether there's infidels whether there's coal former churches what difference does it make God give us a promise let's take it it's ours it belongs to us it's our possession let's go get it it belongs to us don't be afraid don't stay back and say well I believe the days of miracles is past and oh I don't know I don't know what I don't do that then he says he said that don't look like a child of Abraham no matter how far along the promise seemed to hold out well it went for 25 years but instead of Abraham getting weak he got stronger Oh hallelujah the raptures on time the resurrection is own time when Lazarus was in a tomb let me just say when Jesus showed up he was on time but instead of Abraham didn't weaker he got stronger all the time for he knowed it it'd be a greater miracle all the time and will be prayed for one night and the next morning we got a bad stomach or maybe we'll say maybe I never got my healing have to go through the prayer line again you call yourself a son of Abraham or a child of Abraham he said God made a promise God gave the promise and you believe it I don't care what takes place it's yours for fight the devil on every ounce of ground that he stands on walk over and take it take the sword of the word God's promises is true nothing can stop it they're God's promises he give us the promise that he that that that that just like he did for the children of Israel the Pentecostal church has come - okay - marnya are we able can we do it Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever can we walk up there and take a hold of God's promise and say it's the truth I claim it I own it God gave it to me remember Jesus conquered sickness he conquered temptation when the enemy spit in his face and smote his jaw and he turned to the other side when they jerked the beer from his face and spit on him he never replied back he conquered the gate of temptation we read this to you last night I wanted to keep this in your mind over these next couple of weeks and these signs shall follow them that believe I am a believer that's where I benefi I am a believer whether I'm having a good day or a bad day that Metin matter all the fluff of life doesn't matter oh brother on but I'm having a bad week I'm still a believer I'm having a bad day I'm still a believer God knew I'd have a bad day but he's got to have somebody in this day that knew the circles God knew the circumstances was coming on and he still got believers hallelujah Paul wrote almost the New Testament from a dungeon not a plush comfortable suite to where that he'd have all the luxuries or a personal or personal attendant to take him and bring him coffee and candies every time that he got a little bit hungry from a dungeon he would write some of the most powerful words that's given to humanity today if God be for us who can be against us are you with me maybe to the outside I you were looking at the mortal play and the mortal situation it doesn't matter what the mortal clay said we've got a promise of God hallelujah brother Jonathan maybe you can adjust that up a couple degrees if you would he says Paul said this and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling let me just let me just let you know this fear is mentioned 600 times in the scripture it's not a myth it's not an illusion your human body is going to understand fear but God gave you a word greater than fear Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah notice I just read it these signs shall follow them that believe in my name so that gives us authority in my name shall they cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues and they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick I want you to understand it doesn't say preachers prophets believe us mamas when your babies get sick and it's got a fever brown you have authority in the name of Jesus Christ you're at work and you're a situation to where you can't call your neighbour you got a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of your infirmity take your pen and write the check speak to the situation react to the moment that's made you and bill tune to respond to the challenge of the hour Alleluia the scripture first Kirk John chapter 3 and verse 2 beloved now are we the sons of God hallelujah now are we the sons of God not some day or some wishing day now are we the sons of God claim your promise first John chapter 4 and verse 4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world are you with me now you're built for the challenge God knew what you would need to overcome in this day so we had win in his free planning he knew what kind of artillery that you would have to have and you see God doesn't evolve because he never has a new thought every 10 years he doesn't have to update his program he's not like your computer in a few days you got to download a new iOS system for your iPhone God never has had to change his word ever he's God he's infinite never had a new thought and so when he was giving you a weapon that you can overcome in your day it's not time sensitive and it don't run out like your milk or your eggs does God's Word work for Abraham it worked for Noah it worked for Paul it worked for brother branham it'll work for you [Applause] got predestinated this moment I want you to think for just a moment you are a fresh round draft choice in God's mind are you with me men spend millions and millions of dollars into the billions of dollars trying to find a Kentucky Derby winner and they're only looking for potential looking for that right one that's got it all are you with me and even in having the right size horse and the right you can't measure a heart in all of the millions of dollars you can't measure a heart you can't measure desire you can't measure that when God deposited what he deposited only inside of you he's not in the if program he's not in the if he knows what he deposited down on the inside of you you're the spoken word of the original seed you are Christ the mystery of this day you are the fulfillment of things that are to be you remember me telling you this story for years I was in Alaska preaching a meeting and they asked me to come down and after the meeting was over asked me if I'd like to go fishing I've never been a fisherman really I'm not I'm not not because I don't like it it just the opportunity hasn't been there a whole lot for me we don't live around great big lakes we got rivers and that kind of thing but just never been I loved hunting but and never but the the knack for fishin I like to fish for men now I really like it and I found myself in uh in the Alaskan it's a it's a it's a Kenai River and a Russian River I know kind of come together and I'm standing with a with the brother named Don babblers and he was a short man like myself and he was standing on her he was standing in the water with me and we had to have waiters on they had to be out in the river the river was swift and all of you know how how I enjoy water anyway and so this Swift River and it's just crazy cold coming off those glaciers and and we're fishing for those those salmon as they pass by and I'm standing there and I'm standing beside of a man and he's fishing and there's a god just over his shoulder and and this guy's telling him where to fish and he was throwing his lure and we're lying doll you know we're just all of us are lined up and down you just as far as your eye can see was people in the river and this guy was telling him where to throw his fish throw his hook he was throwing in the same hole I was and after a little while I asked him I said what are you playing that guy and he said well it's a $5,000 trip I said really you're throwing in the same hole that I'm throwing in he said what did you pay I said ten dollars as it would turn out we caught the same thing neither one of us caught anything brother Don baptists was standing on this side and he you know he got kind of a little bit bored with fishing do you know him and he said brother run he said I was fishing here one day and I was talking to a fisherman and he said to this God and he said he said he told me a story that you might find interesting and he said there was an eagle that was flying over top of this and he said now Eagles are fast birds but they have predators too and said this Hawk was picking on this eagle in because he could he can fly more direct and and he just flied out and he was at this eagle and he would back on him and he and he was just pestered him and pestered him and pester Eamon and and so after a while he said he said he hid this eagle in the back of the head and that eagle started terminal tumbling and tumbling and tumbling like this right here and he's he tumbled and he said I thought I was gonna watch that Eagle perish and he said just before he hit the water he said I saw his head shake itself and he said his wings and when he came to himself he tore that Hulk to pieces [Applause] I want you to understand your eagle and you might get knocked out once in a while but when you come to yourself and you realize who you are and the devil might challenge you hold on over and over again but when you come to yourself and you realize who you are how do I love you I think sometimes we just need to let go and let God have his way I think sometimes we need to get beyond ourselves and our our realm of thinking and this is who I am God built you to be an overcomer of this day every one of us have a mountain in our life every one of us do your neighbor cannot speak to your Mountain like you can we can pray for one another and uplift one another but you got to speak to your Mountain you remember that little grain of sound that we talked about last night you may not see your mouth to move immediately but when you speak to it a grain of sand rolls over are you with me now we should ask ourselves what is in our hands I think sometimes we don't realize what really is in our hands we had the most powerful message has ever been delivered to humankind we are the final voice to the final age we are an invincible army we are bone of his bone life of his life power of his power where everything that got thought that we would be and what he deposited on the inside of us but because of our human shell that is around us that ever constantly reminds of your humanity why don't you remind him that God put something eternal on the inside of me and doled this outward man perish the inward man is renewed day by day [Applause] we sing songs when we come here to church there's a reason we do that there's a reason God ordained that to be because singing songs is a live testimony of God's work we sing the song when the redeemed are gathering in and we sing it with enthusiasm because we believe I'm one of those redeemed and we're headed for a gathering I wonder if we'd stop and listen to how we sing sometimes last night I told you about you have to be inspired to read God's inspired word for it to come to life I wonder if we would listen to our singing well I am thinking of a rapture in that blessed oh yes oh yes ah I'm not talking about how good you can sing how bad you could say I'm talking about whether it's coming from your heart do you really believe it we get a couple hundred of you in here do you start singing from your heart and it's beyond entertainment beyond beyond your humanity beyond your back weak in your bad day and you come in your start releasing the power of the spoken word till your lips and we begin to sing and we begin to dance and the Spirit of God you see when Jesus said peace be still a very powerful storm had a rose and the author and the finisher of our faith spoke to that story and in a few seconds that C was like glass and the ones that were around him said never a man speak like I pray that the people that work with you that that live in your world that they can see you speak to your storms I'm regardless of the things that's going on you take God's Word and sometimes you may not be able to quote it but you go back and you go to God's Word in you you put on the query of God's Word and you say I want to find out what it says about that because in my feeble words I don't know what to say but when I take God's words and I speak to my situation you got a question about where women go to what God says about it some people go to forty-two different people to get the answer that they're looking for I have no faith in that kind of a deal I go to what God says I go to what God said and the gut that said peace be still and in just seconds that sea became glass I'll take that when he told the sick be healed he didn't pray a 42 minute prayer oh brother on I would love to walked in brother branham's prayer line have you stopped to listen to that sometime have you have you stopped to listen to that brother ramble sometimes tell a story about the woman at the well and she recognized who was there or he'll he'll talk about the raising of Lazarus and then are you the patient and then if the Lord would show me to get your faith - and he'll tell me if you're just if you know if you believe me to be God's prophet what was he doing it wasn't brother branham's faith he was trying to get their faith you know their standing standing something between you can feel it now their son their standing something between you and I that's him don't be nervous that's him I'm not sure he'll or he's your healer what he was asked him that to do even from that service I just read to you this one this morning we had a tremendous service we shouted we danced and a person came to be prayed for and I told him go and believe go and believe well well brother on brother branham could have spoke them to be healed many people they were but for the most of them they were challenged to go and believe brother Branham said when he was standing there speaking those squirrels how many squirrels do you want I want three and he said God challenged me to believe and I accepted his challenge if God said these things about us let's accept the challenge when Jesus walked to the tomb and he called for his friend to come forth from the tomb he didn't pray if it be your will he called for Lazarus by name and brother Dan said being the voice of the resurrection had he not called him by name there would have been a general resurrection jesus said some powerful words and for lasses these were incredibly powerful Lazarus come forth and so from another dimension he began to testify I hear his voice now and I gotta go roll the stone away by now Lord he stinketh the roll the stone away sometimes he challenges us to use our faith brother Benham didn't walk over our Jesus didn't walk over and help them move the stone he challenged them because them moving the stone showed their faith hallelujah sometimes you're going to have to roll the stone brethren I want the preacher to do it the preacher can only preach the word and challenge you to believe but you've gotta roll some stones [Applause] jesus said I and my father a one you see that's what got him crucified when he told them that I am the word the I am the I am the I am is in me I am the human body to which God has chose to feel all of his fullness the prophets were God in portion Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead bodily when this message becomes more than a message by association but you're the Word made flesh more than books and tapes and pictures on the wall I am a believer [Applause] [Music] jesus said I have power to lay my life down and power to take it up again he was quoting what the word said are you with me he was quoting what the word said we can say I'm as good as wrap shirt because that's what the word said about me I will get a resurrection because that's what the word said about me regardless of how I feel I'm healed are you with me tonight hallelujah I don't chicken Deuteronomy chapter 31 in verse 6 notice the positiveness of this scripture be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the LORD thy God he it is that death go with thee brother on but that was - Joshua Willett that's the way you can read it but he's an I am God he's an ever-present God when he laid out a prescription that's the way it is I want you to read this with me tonight and I want you to say this is for me be strong and of a good courage fear not not be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he it is that death go with me he will not fail thee nor forsake thee I preached this at brother Tim Bruce our brother Kelley's so maybe this will be good I didn't preach this sermon there had I been giving this sermon there I'd have preached this sermon in there but it got I got this this week so you're getting it this week but brother Branham says it was like a man that had that three-cornered stick of course he talked about that denominational Trinitarian spirit said he would grab the woman by the nape of the neck and he would beat him and he would beat that woman and if she would get up he beat that woman back down again he'd beat that woman back down again and he he began to think if I could only help and all the sudden he began to believe who he was and he said his faith muscles begin to grow and the bigger he got the smaller that man got and he took he said I thought that woman was my mother but that was with my daddy and he said then I realized it was a church but too many times we had battered woman or battered men or battered life syndrome and we went through the the torments of life and we're constantly living life at regrets we've all had bad things happen to us we've all had horrible things happen to us but putting those things behind put it behind forget I said this day I'll say this now life's too short to live in torment if you live a hundred years old and live and live in torment I would rather live by myself than live in torment don't get mad at me life is too short to live and total them and don't go give us a license go and get remarried but life's too short don't let the devil beat you around all the time I want to home this filled with peace I want to tell them that's filled with courage it's kind of home I got a home that's filled with courage and faith and and response to the Word of God it's my sanctuary on the earth where I live in a tent or I live in a castle God's welcome at my house and it's for me in my house we will serve the Lord [Applause] Satan will put a trap for you if you're not careful but I want to ask you how long will you live with that trap I've been a Christian a long time now I've been a preacher a long time I want to understand many I've seen many with habits and weaknesses in their life but the day that you fall out of love with that weakness and you start hating that sin that's actually destroying you cuffs in will destroy it's got a payday and that seeing pace top dollar in Virginia where we've got wine farms all over Virginia but now things are changing to where there's going to be cannabis farms marijuana farms legalized marijuana farms all over Virginia it's not coming it's here are you anything can't make money on Caterpie don't cheat but you can make it on marijuana cuz sin still pays top dollar and insanity reigns in the world but it does not have to reign in your life if Jesus is the king of your life you can speak to that weakness and say I'm not put up with you now mo you're a man's were better a little while ago but I'll take the ones that you squeaked out just now there was a time that Cinderella in the story had to live in the act there was a time that she wore raggedy clothes there was a time there was a time that she that she supposedly mocked and made that and they made fun of her but that time come to an end to where that she was the princess wife help me preach there was a time that you look like you are aliens from the Commonwealth of God and you look like you were insane and you look like you was on your way to a devil's hell but that seed came to life on the inside of you and you recognize I'm one of the Alma and the proud of Jesus Christ [Applause] I'm not The Devil's whipping post [Applause] hallelujah Moses prayed and the greatest soldiers in the world became fish food Daniel prayed and the lands that were in the den that we're going to eat him stood and could not consume him but those same lines ate the men that accused him Elijah prayed and became the greatest athlete in the world and ran faster 40 miles than the best horses of Israel brother random said that prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God the scripture said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper but you have to recognize what has came against you is nothing but a trick I won't be long now you hang with me who has the most power before God and you've heard me quote this a hundred times but I want to I want you to I want you to get it who has the most power before God an angel that's a servant they're his servants what are you you're a son and daughter who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side and then he answers the question the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than an archangel that stood by his side without sin because he's a son asan has more authority then a servant does now I want I want to bring this to you for angels brother branham said stopped the world war for stop the world war every time I see 11:11 on a clock I'm reminded that God stopped the war 11:11 exactly right on time they didn't even understand what stops it or there would be no flesh God had a promise in the book it had to come to pass you and I hadn't been born yet most of us and listen God couldn't let that war go any further so he sent four angels and they stopped the law the United States didn't stop it Germany didn't stop it Europe didn't stop it four angel stopped the law three men were headed to a to a to a fiery furnace and they heated it up seven times hotter to which even the guards that stood by the door were consumed with it wormwood said let me go down I'll change it I destroyed the whole earth with water let me go I changed I white babbling off the face of the earth Gabriel said let me go I'll change the whole situation God said I've been watching all night long I'm not gonna let you go I'm gonna go myself brother Brennan said he called a clown and a zig zag lightning and he went into the fire that's where he will meet you [Music] [Applause] Amram and Jochebed knew that the deliverance was at hand and then there knowing that deliverance as his hand some God just kept putting it in their heart it's time for deliverance we've been here 400 years it's time for deliverance God met Abraham in the form of Melchizedek and he told us and we would be here this belief of tongue and it's time for deliverance brother Branham said in teaching on Moses that Amram would go into his little addict and there he was met by an angel and he was met by an angel you ever find that in the book you ever found it I've been a Bible study here all my life but a prophet that knew that Eve had blonde hair well brother Arne was just making up a story really that knew that that knew that Barton has climbed itself up in a truth that nobody with me not bartimaeus help me here Zacchaeus climbed his shelf up a tree knew that it did and watch how he got in the tree well brother on brother man was watching making up a story let me just say this year was he when he told the woman that she got off of the bus because of her nurten her nervous condition that had been all these years he said I see you as a little girl and you got off of the bus and a dog chased you down the road God knows how to rewind 40 years to tell you what's going on here today and then fast-forward that tomorrow you're going to be well the God that can rewind 40 years that can go back to the Garden of Eden I'd say Eve was blond-headed the baby was borned and they were killing thousands of babies killing a generation trying to get rid of that baby and brother branham said God just simply pull one over on them and allowed them to train Moses and educate Moses and take care of Moses stupid devil the devil can't touch a hair of your head until God gives him permission [Applause] they were given instructions to take this baby and put it into a crocodile-infested now they built a certain type of a bulrush and put tar on it place the baby down inside of it let me say this to you it was better protected there than in their arms and brother Brennan said God call for Gabriel and ten thousand angels to line up and down the that--now river and he gave Gabriel specific instructions just stand on the on that bull rush on that down that basket and every time a crocodile come up he said put your foot on that crocodiles nose and he said whenever he get into the world pools which you're going to get in some whirlpools in life you see that he did side of it you're better protected - not hilarious I say this to you we are not alone last couple of weeks they've been having a gathering of area 51 trying to explain UFOs you had a prophet stood about that tall explain what those UFOs were that they were investigating angels have got don't worry about do they have their body out yonder somewhere another come on church Lou it seemed spooky to me whether you know it or not there's thousands of angels that are standing this building to watch over top of you you are not alone I don't have the time to tell you how much power that's given to them and they carry out their orders they've been carrying them out since the eternities and they will continue to carry those orders out but you were a son you were a daughter and you've got more power with God than those angels the angel that was riding on the bull rush to which nobody could see but he was there the angel that's
