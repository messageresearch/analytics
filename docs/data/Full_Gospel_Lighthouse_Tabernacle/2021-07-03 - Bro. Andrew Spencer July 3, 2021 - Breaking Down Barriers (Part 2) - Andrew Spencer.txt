our life all the odds that were against us and stacked up higher than we could ever get over well you came and you you broke those things down father and we might come running completely to you into the arms of mercy we have ran father that anointing we feel at this pulpit and even those in the back lord we we know that that anointing is the supreme power of god and it's come to control this service and to speak lift to ear to your children to sustain them and give them a word in due season and i would ask father that every need that is amongst us lord i pray that your power your anointing lord would strike that need and curse the enemy out of their life father i know that there's needs that are very heavy very heavy amongst us very burdensome father but we've come here tonight with the burden of the word of the lord to carry these things father and i believe that the spirit of the lord is anointed me to preach this gospel lord i pray that you would set the captive free lord i pray that you would turn their ashes into beauty father and may they take off the garment of heaviness and put on the garment of praise i pray father for the pruitt family just now we pray

of god father i pray that you would send a word by their way you confirmed that you would come down from your glory to minister to this need father i pray that you would show up you sent your word and you healed them one more time lord when you take this service may be edification to the body of jesus christ in the name of jesus and the bride says amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of romans book of romans chapter 12 and verse 1 and then also ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10. and i would like to continue on our thought from last weekend on breaking down barriers we've seen jesus really close in our walks of life we have seen him and handled him and felt him and we've seen him amongst our own families amongst our church family right here how he has come in and he's broke down some things he's broke down barriers and we just want to allow him to come in this evening and speak to our hearts and the sermon that i'll preach here i want to be very strategic in laying out the scriptures and if you have your bibles and your notes to kind of stay with or write down and i'll try not to go too fast to and depending on how how you pull will make me come out of my lane maybe but but this sermon is not indicated for one person particularly but it's to all and it's to christians of five months old to 30 years old and it's covering all all things i think the scriptures are very uh very clear that that even though we have walked with christ for some time i believe that there are still things in our christian life that we have to let go of and we have to learn to walk of jesus i i don't i don't mean i don't mean to point any fingers or anything like that but i i got noticed today from heaven that it's open season on devils yeah and i'm on a hunt yeah romans chapter 12 and verse one i i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10. the bible says here that that we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that ye being in times past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of petition between us may god bless his word you may be seated this evening in the presence of the lord i believe that that we were born into this world that we live in for a purpose and i believe that god has so fitly designed each and every one of us for his purpose as david would say in the psalm book of one psalm 139 that i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made and marvelous are thy works that my soul might know right well and i believe that our purpose is is something that cannot be thwarted and it cannot be stopped but i don't believe that our purpose isn't set and designed to be someone in society or some goal that is set in front of us as children or as parents to be something or to make something out of our lives but i believe just like jesus was speaking with john when he come down to the jordan river and it come his time and he walked down to the water to be baptized and he had a conversation with john and john had a conversation with him and he made these remarks john did say and he said i said i have need to be baptized of thee but jesus made these words said these words suffered to be so for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and i believe that it is our purpose to fulfill all righteousness and to fulfill all the promises of god that are laying there in front of us and i believe that there are there are there are promises that are strategically placed and and the light of the word is shined upon at a certain season to break the barriers off of our life and i believe that there are blessings in front of us that are to be attained strictly for the victory of the lord i believe that goodness and mercy will follow us all the days of our lives and we will dwell in the house of the lord forever and i believe that that there is a purpose of god that that the enemy is trying to trying to stamp out and trying to stop out our influence or stomp out our fire or stamp out our our experience but be we notice that satan he knows that he cannot stop the plan of god but he has always tried to he's always tried to set up his own kingdom in the north side and he's always tried his very best and he took a third of the angels but that didn't surprise god that didn't that didn't shake god off of his plan god had a plan and the bible is very clear to us that god has a plan for our future i i want to say that there is no sickness there is no there is nothing that can hinder a child of god that is going to meet the promises of god when they know that they are in the plan but satan will stand there and try to hinder the move of god he'll try to hinder the children of god by doing that by making them sick or making them afflicted or oppressed and make them feel abandoned make them feel like they're on an island all by themselves or make them feel like they're they're confused or frustrated or unwanted you see he cannot and he knows that he cannot stop the plan of god so he brings in barriers and he builds up walls made out of lies that are weaker than the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken that starved to death because his tactics and warfare that he comes against us with will never whip the word of god so he comes against us with lies lies and threatenings and satan knows that he ain't nothing but a little little kitty cat but he he tries to present himself as a roaring lion the bible says as a roaring lion walking about seeking whom he may devour and he sounds out his threatenings against the children of god to cause fear and to make them back away from the word and believe a lie and down their soul because they believe and not the truth that's his purpose is to turn us away from the promises of god but we have our promise we have our purpose we have our agenda satan is trying his very best to stuff his agenda down our throat but we have our agenda to step back down in his throat and say we will not take what you push on us we will not take what you throw at us we will hold up the shield of faith and it will quench the fiery darks of the enemy that he sins of unbelief and tactics of warfare but our god is a consuming fire hallelujah now a barrier as we know and went over a few things last week in a barrier is a fence or an uh or another obstacle that is there to prevent movement or access a barrier is a fortification offense to stop an enemy and satan is the enemy of god a barrier is a wall for a defense a a barrier is a fortress it's an obstruction of anything which confines or which hinders the approach or the attack and satan has done his very best and he is the very best at sending out smoke screens and setting up illusions and trying to find the children of god trying to say that this is the way that they're going to be this is the way your future is going to come out but i heard a prophet say when he was dealing with that amoeba attack when he when he when he had got talked into doing something and he disobeyed god there he was in his room and he was wondering about his future wondering if he'd always deal with these things wondering if he'd always handle that in the back of his mind and there the angel of the lord stepped into the room and took up papers that he had sitting beside his bed and he took those crumpled up pieces of paper and he stretched them all the way up to glory and the angel of the lord said your future is clear and satan can try to confine you by his lies by his tactics but there is a word of promise that's come by the children of god's way that your future is clear your future is not down to hell your future is a rapture your future is a body change your future is it to be in heaven with god almighty your future is not destruction your future is victory your future is not sickness your future is healing your future is not to be defeated but to be undefeated your future is not to be conquered but to be unconquered your future is in the hands of god and what god is holding no man can pluck out look up or pour or care about hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah and the prophet would say to us don't you fear to go anywhere or to do anything for the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you always hallelujah now we know what satan's weapon is against us when brother branham would preach the the greatest battle ever fought one of the greatest sermons i believe that that the prophet would speak if you haven't listened to it in a long time i believe you ought to revisit it but he said now he said what is satan's weapon against you it's to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarmed you he said let's listen real close quite quiet now he said listen if he can if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is ever equivalent if he can get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has you disarmed he said oh brother never i hope we we never leave that he said look he's disarmed you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon and he said when you lay that down that finishes your fight and you're done but he said hold that weapon brother said hold that weapon your prophet said don't lay it down he said we see his unbelief we see his unbelief what does he do he sends in he sends in reasoning he sends in sickness he sends in superstitions he sends in demonic powers but there is not enough power in all of hell that can ever defeat the purpose of god because god will bring it to pass he will bring his children to maturity there's no premature grave that you are going to because there ain't no grave going to hold the body of jesus christ down god has commissioned that we will be there on resurrection morning we're not going by the way of the grave we're going by the way of the rapture jacob can send out all he wants to against us but to say the psalm said in psalms 124 if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel say it if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us then had they swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over us whole them proud proud waters had gone over us whole but blessed be the lord who hath not given us over to the prey to due to that to not given us uh given us as a prey to their teeth sorry i had my had my tongue wrapped around my eye tooth i couldn't see what i was saying he said but blessed be the lord who have not given us as a prey to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the phallus the snare is broken and we are escaped our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth hallelujah that is our help when sickness comes that is our help when cancer comes that is our help when brain bleeds come that is our help the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and they are safe hallelujah oh give the lord a hand clap a praise our help is in the name of the lord he didn't give you over to be prayed to a wannabe line he didn't give you over to a reprobate mind he didn't give you up when satan wanted you and brother branham said in a future home he said actually god took you away from satan when he was referring to the woman at the well he said satan wanted her but god took her away from him he didn't give you over the cursings he gave you blessings he didn't give you sickness god gave you healings he didn't give you problems he gave you promises he didn't make you defeated he made you undefeated god is the author of life and he is not the author of confusion you were not born to be defeated you were born and designed by the author of life you are fearfully and wonderfully made and satan cannot touch you or harm you unless he gets permission from my father god is a god that builds kingdoms god is a god that builds life and creates life he's the one that built you and made you the way that you are and your purpose is not finished yet slap your neighbor don't slap him in the face slap him on the shoulder say your purpose ain't finished yet he made us the way that we are but he does not make us make the choices he did not push us through a pipe and say blessed is he that overcometh he didn't he didn't get you in that mess you got yourself in that mess he didn't drag you down in that alley you drug yourself down in their alley but he is a faithful god to get us out of that alley he's a faithful god to snatch us out of the out of the snare of the fowler you might be caged up you might feel locked up but i want to tell you god's got the key god's got the key to get you out if you'll just follow him out of that sin follow him out of that sickness he's making a way the lord the word of the lord is a lamp unto my feet and i light him to my path follow him he's taking you out of the prison houses he's taking you out of the bondage of sin hey i know an angel that came by the way other disciples that have been locked up there for preaching this word this same message they got locked up in there but the lord that the word said in acts chapter 5 and 19 that the angel of the lord came at the night season and he opened up the door and he said follow me and when he went out there and took him into a place he said go stand and declare this word of life unto all of them in the temple when he brings you out he's not just setting you free so that you can fall back in sin he's bringing you out to break the barriers off of sin to break the chains off the off of the things of life oh hallelujah hallelujah and satan is trying to stop this move he's trying to put up barriers to stop god and he's trying to bring in squatters on your promises and so that was for a day gone by but this word of the lord says this is our land this is our holy ghost these are our children those are our protocols those are that's our pastor that's a pastor's wife that's the bride of jesus christ satan you ain't got no legal authority on the promises of god so you can't even stay close to it you might as well back away from it there's a law here that says you are condemned and there's a future that is said about you that you are going to torment but i am going to a place there ain't no torment there ain't no sickness there ain't no pain there ain't no ms there ain't no cancer there ain't no depression there ain't no dogma that's gonna hold me there ain't no there ain't nothing gonna hold me there ain't no grave gonna stop me that can't handle me oh don't you wanna go where i'm going oh bless the lord on my soul and forgive not all of his benefits bless his holy name so what shall we say to these things if god before us who can be against us you can name off your demons you can name off the skeletons in your closet but if god be for me [Applause] you can name out your dna your dna your genealogical tree of things that you have been built up complexes stigmas of things that are passed down through your cycles of life but there is the blood hallelujah there's things you pick up throughout your dna or throughout your environment that you pick up that you can't just you can't just get rid of on your own you watch you you see people and you can even watch when somebody's adopted into a family and they can be treated like a child and the father can love him like a child and a child can love him like a father but yet there are things that you know could not be passed down because the dna is not there but yet because of the environment that he's in he's influenced by that environment and he picks up little things that's why i i believe that that if the atmosphere is right you'll pick up some things you'll pick up that these promises are not for days gone by you'll pick up that that malachi 4 ain't just got william branham in there but it's got you in there are you with me you'll pick up that over in revelations 10 that it wasn't just a mighty angel and it wasn't just brother branham there the seventh angel but you'll pick out to say hey there's somebody there's somebody that's got to prophesy and speak these things again hallelujah you'll pick up these things that greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world oh you might be in the environment and you watch some people they get in the atmosphere or get under the environment and man they can quote some scriptures man they can sure walk the walk it looks like and talk the talk but yet they can go out and get tempted and fall away because it's not something that's locked up in the dna it's just environment there's things that are passed down cycles and barriers that are built up through humanity that that that there is only a blood that can conquer are you with me and that's why paul would say he would sit there and he said i will beseech you brethren that you present your bodies a living sacrifice that you would be transformed by the renewing of your mind now look i want you to look at this you can change your hairstyle you can change your dress you can change your speech but it does not change your heart are you with me you you you can change you can change your makeup you can change the way you sing you can change the way you come to church but if you do not have a changed mind you will never break down any barriers just because you change something on the outside but if there is a change in your mind you can stand there like paul said that i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities no things to come nor anything coming or going shall be able to separate me from the love of god i'd say that you can walk through sickness you can walk through temptation you can walk through pain if you've got a changed mind and a changed heart but it's got to be a breaking you see why he is so good at redemption and restoration is because the people that come to him are broken [Music] there are things laying there that you cannot personally overcome amen but there's a god that's here that can pick you up out of the mirror clay and set your foot on a rock to stay you remember you know that you say well i i can overcome i can overcome let me tell you you you look over in the scriptures and i'm not preaching to you anything that's outside the scriptures that is laying right there in the book of genesis about cycles and barriers when you look over there at abraham and he goes down there and brother branham tells us in the opening of the seven seals that god changed them after the meeting of melchizedek he changed abraham and sarah but watch what abraham did he walked down there to gorier and he told sarah sarah now look if anybody asks you who you are you just tell them that i that you're my sister now notice what he did and forgive me but let me tell you when god does something he does something good he here and people think that this was some 90 year old woman they ain't no 90 year old woman so fine that a king will look lust after but here god comes in by by the way of melchizedek and changes their body that she's not walking down there as some stupid shoulder 90 year old woman and i'm not i'm not disregarding somebody but let me tell you at 90 years old i highly doubt anybody's going to be lusting after me [Music] i hear you i hear you but you notice now look here's the cycle it's going forward he's done told this thing and if it had not been for the lord coming in there and he told him he told the king in the night season he said restore the man his wife but look here it is you can flip past some few chapters here and look over in genesis chapter 26 when isaac goes down there with rebecca and he sets up his tent outside of gorier and he said and said and he did the same exact thing in the same exact place rebecca if anybody asked you you tell them that you're my sister the bible said that she was fair to look upon but because there was no blood that could take away their sin it only covered sin you see that cycle or that barrier could not be broken you can go down to david king david that little weakness that he had in his life it's passed down to his sons you remember when david's out there had a problem when there was a there was a warrior or a captain there was a captain's wife that was sitting over there taking a bath and he and he brought her unto himself you can watch his son ammon and how he takes his sister and he commits an act with her then you can look at david at david you could see that david had a problem he had a real problem at the death of david they brought a virgin unto him and put him in the bed with david and david he did not even move and they said hey the king is dead they knew that if he didn't resurrect for that there was something going on he didn't break a barrier he was just about to die but you can watch that david the bible said that david had 500 women in his life you can look at solomon it didn't get broke solomon is known for having over a thousand a thousand women in his life because a cycle could not be broken but paul said nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate me from the love of god if you look at that word in the greek high thing it is it is hoopsma it is a high thing or an elevated thing that is an elevated structure that is a barrier a rampart or a bulwark and you can see when paul goes over in second corinthians and he told us in verse five to cast down imaginations and every barrier that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god into captivity and every thought to the obedience of christ you see that's what the enemy loves to do is to bring in barriers to keep us away from the promises to rob us build up cycles in our life we'll never overcome that this is about breaking those things now you i want you to know the only way you're going to overcome is by the word of the lord amen and by the blood of the lamb and the prophet said that you can take god at his word and you can shake every devil away from you and you can run free shake it off shake it off and step up you remember when jerry cloud told that story about that about that mule falling down in that hole down there he he told about that he said that farmer he lost he looked all over for that mule and he looked all over his land but he couldn't find him but he went over there and he looked in his well and he found that that mule had been falling down in there he saw oh man he said i'll never get him out of there i never get him out of there he sits away he said well i'll just bury him i'll just bury him down there so he started throwing dirt over on him and that every time every time that dirt would hit that mule he would just shake it off he'd shake it off and finally there got enough dirt underneath of him he started stepping up and he said well that farmer said hey i'm not burying that thing that thing's getting higher so he realized what was going on so we got a party that came over and he started throwing dirt and every time that mule he would throw dirt down on him he would shake it off and he would step up and every time the word comes by your way and the enemy is coming by to throw up dirt in your life but i want to tell you to shake it off and step up step up to where the promises of god will bring you out of the pit the bible said that he has enlarged my feet that i may not fall oh hallelujah there's a god that is on your side [Applause] mother branham said and letting off the pressure he said he said i got to nail it down or satan's going to rob it from you he said from this great display of the presence of the holy ghost here tonight he said beyond the shadow of doubt the bible evidence what god said would take place now notice i believe this is going to happen right here for you tonight he said there's a mighty russian wind trying to get into the audience and to fill every soul with the presence of god don't let satan take it away from you hold on to it till you pass the barriers of unbelief hold on to it there's a rushing mighty wind that's trying to get on the inside of your soul and satan can come to your mind and tell you different things that you're done in your past but speak like the prophet spoke and say house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ let there be a rattling and a shaking and come out of the cage that the enemy puts you in he is standing here in the form of the holy spirit to tell you that he's a mighty cop crap he has broke through every every every barrier now notice in the mighty god unveiled he said he's broken every denominational veil every sound barrier that sound that says all that's fanaticism he broke right through that thing the sound that said come out of there said all them them people are crazy he broke right through that veil yes he did oh you can't do it you're nothing but a bunch of fanatics he broke right through that there's no such thing as divine healing he broke right through that my for his word said he would and you can't conquer the word of god and there he stands yet tonight the mighty conqueror since he broke every methodist and baptist and presbyterian in every kind of a veil he still stands amongst his people tonight unconquered by traditions let people say what they want want to do what they want to do anything they want to god comes breaking right through that sound barrier and remember they tell me when a plane breaks that sound barrier there's no limit to it speed he said i'm telling you within when you break that traditional barrier that jesus is way back and he isn't now when you find that he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no limit to what god could do right here in this convention and show this world what they need not a world's fair but a world revival that'll be filled and baptized with the presence of the living god in morphy invading himself in human flesh hallelujah he said broken every barrier every veil every veil nothing can hide his presence he said when people get hungry in their heart there's a veil ready to be broke you can just depend on that oh hallelujah if you'll get good and hungry god will break the barrier off of your life you know that jesus said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled if you hunger for this message you're blessed if you hunger for a move of god you're blessed [Music] the bible said in psalms 103 and 5 who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle psalms 84 and 1 how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts my so longest yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh cry out for the living god so if you'll get hungry something will break it's unlimited what will happen in this place if you get hungry i didn't know what i was saying last weekend when i told you to tell your neighbor when you walk back in the back door get ready god's gonna do something but if you get hungry enough for a move of god you'll have a move of god if you get hungry enough for an outpouring of the holy ghost you'll have an outpouring of the holy ghost if you get hungry for your children to have a good old-fashioned pentecostal experience you can get hungry and you can watch your children eat on the son of man you can watch them get a real deliverance you can watch them how the enemy came in and he ate off the joy off their life as they take a worm as a palmer as a caterpillar and he ate the joy of the lord off of your life he took the goodness the meekness the gentleness the self-control right off of your tree but there's a word of the lord that said that i will restore saith the lord anything that the enemy has robbed from you stole from you taken from you beaten off of you you are a people that have been restored [Applause] and the bible said in the book of job chapter 26 2 and 26 that you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that had dealt wonderly with you and my people shall never be ashamed there are things that keep eating at your keep eating at your praise eating at your experience and the enemy keeps sending in diseases he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing he's trying to eat away any bit of faith that you got all right you eat away your experience he'll eat away that the first love that you had for him that's what the ephesian church eggs did they lost their first love and anytime you lose your first love for him you have lost everything and here that thing keeps eating at you that's what a disease does it comes in maybe through a brew cell or through a demon of different ways and he comes in and he eats all the good cells out he starts attacking and he starts eating and here we have a scriptural form for this the things that have been eaten off throughout the ages that the scripture has told us that not only will they eat the things off of you but i'm going to restore those things but here he says that that you're not going to be in famine but you're going to eat in plenty let me tell you i i i sure have enjoyed being in this message because there's one thing that we know how to do in this message that's we know how to eat on the true living word of god and we do know how to eat on the outside too [Applause] but sometimes sometimes you you eat and finally get to a spot say hey that's right i have done ate enough banana pudding that i can't stuff no more down there i tell you this trace is good but i i just can't handle no more but the word of the lord is saying you're gonna eat in plenty and you're gonna be satisfied and that satisfaction will bring you to a praise a praise of my name because i have dealt wondrously with you i have not left you down there in captivity but i've brought you out to eat you're a blessed people you're not eating some pentecostal chicken feed you're eating i'm the carcass of the son of man oh blessed are you when jesus goes he's standing there in matthew chapter 12 and he starts pulling things out of history i i enjoy that when jesus starts starts telling to us about lifting him out of history and he starts talking to us about a woman that was a pagan that was a heathen that had traveled hundreds of miles on camelback just to hear the wisdom of solomon to see if what she was hearing would be true and jesus said that the queen of the south will rise up she'll rise up and in judgment to condemn this generation for she came from the uttermost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and here jesus says and a greater than solomon is here and brother brown said that this generation will be condemned when they wouldn't walk across the street just to hear the word of god i'm going to say something strong right here but this community is damned because they would not walk across the street and hear home appraiser or heal ronald spencer because that was not homophrasia a greater than solomon is here hallelujah it ain't ron's picture it ain't william bournemont it ain't temporary it's a greater that's solomon and greater than all the prophets is here she didn't have no air conditioning she was riding on a camel that was spitting she was riding on a dusty road but she was hungering after the true word of god [Applause] she brought all these gifts all these things and her actions towards the gift of god bestowed upon her a heaven salvation you see if you go to hungary some of you are sitting here because faith cometh by hearing you heard god was doing something amongst you you heard you heard i don't know what's wrong with him people down there but they sure are excited ah they them preachers get up and they're they just keep preaching like like like the god of the bible is is here today and they keep talking like like he's coming after people that believe him and i don't know i don't know exactly i don't understand everything but i i i believe that the bible says something about that and you're setting here because faith cometh by hearing who put that on the inside of you to come it's the deep calling to the deep now notice listen to this he said no he said i i should have shared it with so you can see it but it's a little bit a little bit lengthy not too long i trust you won't go to sleep during this if you do i'll come tap you on the shoulder but there it is somehow or another that that when the heart goes to hungering after god he said troubles don't look like anything he said you got your mindset no matter what anybody calls you they can call you whatever they want to they can say whatever they want to they can try to put something put every stumbling block in your way but if you're thirsting for god you're going to find it somewhere he said and nothing's going to stop you the husband ain't going to stop you your wife isn't going to stop you your church isn't going to stop you your pastor isn't going to stop you there's nothing can keep a saint away from his word of god his or from his his god if he really wants to see it he said no she never even thought of that he said and you don't think of it either what the what what this one is going to say and what mother's going to say and dad's going to say or or the husband's going to say when you come to find jesus christ to be a rally reality and you hear that he's alive and there is nothing going to stop you when that hunger that seed that's been predestinated before the foundation of the world when that light strikes that it's come to life that quick and this little woman was a type of a seed yet being an alien and a heathen she hungered so much that even the priest down there was not going to stop her from getting to the wisdom of solomon and when you start letting the word of god reign supreme in your life there's gonna be some barriers broke there's gonna be some things well you say well that person got it and i was standing real close and i didn't get it come on you have the same testimony that the man at the pool of bethesda said in john chapter 5 when he when jesus started talking to him he said he said he started talking he said he said whenever i go when the angel comes he said somebody jumps down in front of me and i miss my opportunity you have the same opportunity tonight as this one has or that one has that person got the holy ghost and you can too that woman with the blood issue touched him and you can took georgie carter believed in god and you came too hattie wright believed in god and she said that's nothing but the truth and you can too something is getting ready to shake off of your life if you get past it that plane if he ever gets past it a lot of times you you take off and you get to you're flying in your christian experience and you you take off and you start getting there and you come back down have to make an emergency landing i was getting up there in the clouds and i i i couldn't i couldn't see where i was going i started feeling shakes all over and i i felt something run down my neck and i ain't never felt like anything like it and i just backed off of it that plane when it gets to flying there's a pilot sitting up there he's flying that plane and he's going through the clouds he's going through the storms and he's and he's going up through air he don't just decide to quit because he can't see where he's going he don't just decide that well i'm grabbing my parachute i'll let everybody else grab a hold of their seat maybe we'll land in the ocean he doesn't just stop flying the plane because he can't see and neither should you stop flying in your pristine spirits in your experience and fly on past it flower past that same thing flying past mama did it daddy did it and break past it you ain't got to stop flying because you don't see the preacher standing out in front of you or your mama's standing out in front of you or some other christian standing out in front of you you might have to stand alone but god is going to have a testimony that there's a people that broke past the barriers and when you get past the barriers there's some unlimitations that will shake off of you and you will fly at a speed that only an eagle can fly at come on there's dna barriers there's unbelief barriers there's personal barriers and there are people that are like they're like onions they make you cry they got a lot of layers to them and they sit in church they sat in church for years and they make a pastor cry they sat there and they man they're good they put up a guard they put up a guard a defense mechanism that the word ain't gonna ain't gonna take this off of me that i i'm gonna throw up this guard and i i i know it's right but i'm enjoying out there and they they just got layers and layers and layers and layers that's why god gave you a pastor not an evangelist [Applause] [Music] because a pastor is willing to stand right there in the pulpit and not give up on you and to stand there and work through the layers and tell you there's a holy ghost that'll cut through it you make him cry but the holy ghost is there to make a way through it and he'll get to the center of the problem and the pastor will stay right there hallelujah he'll stay right there until you get it he ain't going to leave you down there and lay out a seal living down there in that sin living down there in that situation but he's going to tell you there's a grace for you there's a blood for you it's a time that you start moving the barriers of unbelief and you start moving mountains you might have to roll it one grain at a time but you speak to that mountain who out there who breaks the rubble thou mountain that has come before us thou shall become a plague it's not thy might it's not by power but by my spirit saith the lord it's not the pastor it's not the evangelist it's the word that does the cute as long as there's breath in your lungs god don't have the mindset to give up mother andrew i have struggled i have struggled i have fought i have pushed i have cried i have spent hours in my closet crying out to god lord i need you lord take this thing away from me lord lord if you don't do it i uh you're gonna find a bag of bones here brother andrew i have struggled i have prayed for this disease to leave me i have prayed i have fasted i've asked i've done can i give you a quote he said if you can get beyond that sound barrier if you can get beyond that sin barrier of unbelief allah doesn't mean me could i be healed could i be saved could i be filled with the holy spirit he said get beyond that he said and just keep struggling and struggling and struggling until you break through and the holy ghost comes upon you i have prayed about this thing i have asked about this thing i know i'm saved i know i'm filled with the holy ghost but yet i still fight this thing in the night seasons just keep struggling just keep fighting don't you ever give up don't you ever give in you stay right there and you struggle and when you get past that thing you're gonna fly at an unlimited speed and you're gonna be able to look back at somebody else and say the grace of god got me past my barrier he'll get you past that barrier hallelujah he's more than enough and jesus stood there and asked him said who do men say that i the son of man have he said i have gift hallelujah i give you the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth if you look up that word loose it means to break and whatsoever you break on earth i oh hallelujah mamas and daddies my little girls little boys i say unto you that whatsoever you break on earth shall be broken heaven hallelujah i'm going to destroy that thing i'm going to melt the chains off of their life i'm going to destroy i'm going to dissolve i'm going to break up i'm going to break down i'm going to lose any person that's what he said to you sometimes we look at things and we see it on the surface it's more than a scripture this is life he said i will loose you i will loose any person that's tied up or fastened up when they when they brought over in mark chapter 7 they brought him verse 32 and they bring him unto him one that was death and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him notice and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers in his ears and he spit and touched his tongue and he looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him empathy that is be opened and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain what did he do he loosed the thing that was holding him this broke every barrier when jesus it's a good thing jesus took him away from the multitude to do this because some people look at the way jesus does things and or unorthodox amen amen why would god do it that way why and there's where a lot of people get caught up in limiting god god has come to you in some of the most unprecedented ways but he's coming and he takes him out there in the street and he sticks his finger in his ear and the pharisee said man i ain't found that in the book of moses now i'm going to go back to the tour and i'm gonna study that thing you got a devil on you he spits on the ground and then he takes his tongue and he says episode be open oh hallelujah hey something getting ready to be opened there's a barrier getting beaten getting ready to be broke off and he's going to speak over you when there was a woman that had had an infirmity for 18 years and she'd been bowed up and bowed over where she couldn't even move but the bible said that jesus called to her and says come here she ain't moved for 18 years but when jesus goes to call he says woman thou art loosed and he is saying over your womb be open and produce life he is saying i'm loosing your tongue to speak the true word of god and jesus said in mark 11 22 and 23 have faith in god if you speak to this mountain and cast it to go out into the sea ask and it shall be given unto you he is loosing your tongue to speak the promises of god jesus was on his road and he's coming he's coming he's coming he's coming he's coming he might have to walk on water to get to you but he's coming he might get a headache and sit by the way and sit there and just wait on a casket to pass him but he's coming he might take your lunch box but he's going to feed 5 000 with it because he's coming he might break every sin barrier every reason and barrier but it's coming [Applause] i was listening to a tape early this morning i woke up i woke up to this plane in my room brother branham was speaking in perfect faith and he was talking about the woman with a blood issue he said that when those other scene that virtue was released to her because of how she did it it gave others faith to do the same thing [Music] i've had i've had a lot of emails and a lot of text over what's happening here if if it it would blow your mind how many texts or emails i get every week i want just just because i can just what's happened with these three the spencer family right up here malachi gabriel and charity said i i want i want that same thing amen they're hungry for it they're hungry for it you know what my reply is to him you can have it [Music] he will meet you in the most unprecedented ways if you'll come the same way that they came brother burnham said that god is obligated if your faith is the same as that person's faith he's got to meet you on that same grounds and if you come through the blood cell if you come and struggle you can have it you can have it you can have this whole benefit pentecostal experience you can have an old-fashioned pentecostal speaking in tongues baptism of the holy ghost it's not just for 16 years old it's not just for those that are 20 and 25 it's for us whoever whosoever will come i said let them come the angels in the water let them come hello hallelujah let them come make room for them let them come let them come let them come make room for them let them come there's 50 miles of that road room up here let them come go out into the highways and the hatreds and compel them come come the master's table set and he's ready come here [Applause] you're not a child of hell you're a child of god you're not a child of the devil you're a child of god whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god that barrier's got to be broke on the internet and in this place there is no hold on a child of god sin can't hold you sickness can't stay on you demons can't handle you you are loosed by the blood barriers have been broken you are of god little children and overcame him because greater is he that is in you and he that is in the world the blood has loosed us the blood has set us free be opened [Applause] you can only produce what you are you can't make this up you can't make you you can't you i can't even hype you up enough brother matthew can't sing you happy enough to make this work the preacher can't preach hard enough to make you work this way and live this way you are what you are you plant corn you get corn you plant sons of god you get sons of god that's what we're in the business of doing it's not my duty to tell you what you are it's my duty to preach the gospel and to cast the net there might be some scorpions come in there might be some there might be some lizards coming in other the snakes and different things but there's going to come some real rainbow trout out of this catch and he says let down thy net for a drought which means a catch of a lifetime now is the time to take god at his word and led down your neck i'm not just preaching to you something pentecostal i'm preaching to you something that's laying right there in the bible ask and you shall receive i don't have the strength to do it ah i'll be glad to put my shoulder on the stone with you and help you but i personally don't have the strength to do it all these ministers up here don't have the strength to do it it's not who i am but it's who i represent and if something supernatural would take place from this pulpit all the way in the back room it would tell you that there's something there you remember when brother banham is dealing with that that cross-eyed child in bombay and he's dealing with that child there and he's speaking to him and he's speaking through an interpreter and he's talking to him and he says now he said he said i can't heal him he said i can't heal him he said but he said if i could raise his faith up so that he could receive his healing or recognize it would raise his faith up that god would heal him he said i'm not the healer but god is and he he starts he starts talking and he says he said this young child he said he was a he's a real thin man and his family was real thin he said it was kind of strange for that tribe and he said all those tribes they were in that warfare and fences in between them and he said he said that was real strange he said but he said this this child he come from a family of christians and they were sitting back here on this side and he said he said there are real christians and he said if you'd walk into their house and walk in and look on the right-hand side of the room there he said you'd see the picture of christ and when that happened that boy's eyes come uncrossed and it caused quite uh an occurring going on there and people could see that we're real close that that boy's eyes had turned and went straight and and there was a doctor down there that that was having a tussle with brother bosworth and he started touching with him and he said i said i got to talk to brother branham i had to talk to him and he said well you can't talk to him he's under the anointing right now he said he can't talk to him and brother brad i'm seeing what was going on he said doctor he said what's going on he said how did you know i was a doctor he said well he said he said what what's what's the cause what's going on he said what did you do to him he said you did you touch him or do something to him he said i'm standing 10 feet from him he said i didn't touch him i didn't touch him he said did you hypnotize him he said shame on you he said shame on you you being a doctor he said if you believe in hypnotism that much why don't you stop practicing medicine and start practicing hypnotism if there's that much power in it why don't you start practicing he said he said what happened he said now he said now you you see that i'm standing here and the boy standing there he said if if if if you he said if you believe god heals he said you would have to recognize that there was something beyond here and there that there was god standing between us that did that work you see and if you would realize tonight that that it's not something right here but there's something between us and i want you to know it's not me it's not the preacher it's not my voice it's not my actions but it's the word of god that comes and heals there's something that is standing between me and you and that word is saying that i will break the barriers of humanity of unbelief of stigmas of complexes of sickness of different things off of your life there's something in between you and i that is breaking the things off of our lives you got a right to it you got a right to these things because god because god also uses barriers satan brings in barriers of unbelief of sickness and all these things and i'm going to be just a second god uses barriers too amen the bible said that that job was a hedge man amen that was more than a bush that was surrounding him there was spears and there was a sword of the lord that was surrounding joel and that ought to testify to you that there's a barrier that's around you you can look over in jeremiah and you can see that god sets boundaries about the sea and the bible said that he set sands upon the ocean to hold it into its place you see i want you to know that there is a boundary about the children of god that satan cannot get past and that satan cannot get through and david said in psalms 16 and 5 the lord is the pers portion of my inheritance of my cup thou maintaineth my lot the lines are falling under me in a pleasant place yea i have a goodly heritage i will bless the lord who have given me counsel my reigns also instruct me in the night seasons i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand and i shall not be moved god has set a boundary about you that satan can do all he wants to with his tactics he can't break through that barrier that god has put around you you remember it's a bumper of the blood of jesus christ hallelujah when you would have been condemned by some other man the bumper of the blood was there when i would have gave up on you when your family would have gave up on you the bumper of the blood of jesus says i they are mine hallelujah will not be moved ah why don't you stand up and say i have a goodly heritage hallelujah god has set boundaries about the sea surely he can set boundaries about me hallelujah let the musicians come hallelujah fear has to leave when god raises the standard satan has done his very best to break the cycle of blessing when when god was having a conversation with abraham and he had this at these words he said i'll bless them that bless you and i'll curse them that curse you you see if you do something for a blessed person you'll be blessed you you ever watched that there are seasons in your life or cycles in your life of blessings that there it just seems like anything you touch it just turns to gold and then there's seasons of their seasons of life that seem like man anything i touch falls apart amen you see there's cycles we keep a calendar as spencer's and dad was a great teacher in that and that it's amazing that if you we watch what happens every year things that you don't even know about or think about but because there are cycles you watch people will do the same things you go to certain places on the same day you eat a burger at the same place on the same day as last year there's cycles that are there this is more than a burger right here but there are cycles there there's cycles of blessings that's coming forth from the throne of god and satan is wanting to come in there and break break that barrier or that cycle of blessings you can watch and you can watch somebody man they're man they're soaring they're soaring and all of a sudden boom god comes in with a uh the enemy comes in with just a tactic and he tries to break it down and you watch the counting has changed and it seems like it takes them forever to get back on the mountain you see satan has come in to break the cycles of blessings you watch it in business you watch it in humanity but god has circled you with his love and his power and his spirit with goodness and mercy that no matter where you go he's got a hedge about you he's got a hedge about you and you're wondering what can i can i get through this can i can overcome this can i break through that cycle cycles of cursings just keep coming by it keeps circling my life and it seems like it's never going to happen it's never going to happen it's never going to happen let the word of god speak and break that thing because whatever you touch is blessed he said i have blessed you going in and coming out you're gonna walk out of here blessed but the enemy's going to try to come in and produce curses but there's a god there's a god that says down from my glory i'm coming for you i'm coming for you i'm coming for you amen there's going to be mountains be rolled away and stones taken apart taken out of the way amen because god's going to use young people god's going to use elderlies to sit right here and break the barriers by speaking thus saith the lord amen let's bow our heads this evening father god we we approach you just now lord knowing that there are things that are laying laying in front of us that that only you could get through the lord you you showed up lord for a woman with a blood issue your shoulder for a woman had a whale [Music] she would walk away as to come see a man lord jesus said she would turn the whole entire city to come lord i pray that you would come i pray that that you would speak over the situations of life and we would see miracles happening prodigals return and the spirit of the living god minister to the children lord i believe that if we'll send out our bread upon the water i believe that it will return unto us butter i believe god that you're restoring unto us the things that have that have seemed to be stripped away from our life lord i pray as we give ourselves over completely to you father that now what is come we take our heart break us past our own human abilities or for that's one thing that we've got to master is the thought of human ability lord may we surrender our all to you lord may you come in and break the chains of circumstance off of our lives lord let us see you in resurrection power breaking through the seals of death over our life may the one that stood up on that day saying i am he that liveth and was dead and i am alive forevermore now you stand up for your children in jesus christ's name amen nobody like you lord [Music] nobody like you lord [Music] oh [Music] nobody you get the glory lord [Music]
