thank you guys for being with us this weekend amen amen and i'm sorry i drawed a blank on you last night but but we you're his mother that's right amen well that's not the first time i've drawn a blank in my life and so amen we certainly love you with all of our hearts and we just are so privileged to be here this morning what a wonderful service we had last night we actually had two services last night brother brother william spoke an incredible message last night and i just thought that was just solid i like things it's just solid just nail it and we so enjoyed that then we went back into the office and my brother and his family came through and they thought they were coming through to say goodbye and was actually coming through to say hello and jesus came into the room and there was just some incredible things that just just happened can't explain it just just know you kind of know it was kind of one of those nights and so amen and so we just we just are so privileged to be a part of those things would like for you to remember us in prayer today as we prepare to to speak the funeral for brother holmes campbell and he was a pastor here in the local area and he was a friend and and so his church we just pray that god would just be with them and uh i don't know exactly how many that's there uh at that at that assembly but we became friends through the years and i always treated him with the utmost respect and loved him just like i do you and and some of you came from his church and many years ago sister joyce you remember those days and i don't know how many years you was with them but but uh we want to do our best for him today and i asked the lord to help him i feel extremely honored to to be asked to to speak his funeral and so brother andrew and myself will speak that this afternoon it'll be a gravesite and at three o'clock so if you would remember us in prayer that god would just be with us also a friend of ours brother randall gisendaner he'd been a friend for decades and so he passed he had cancer uh many of you remember him he came to our a lot of our our labor day services and uh he was a man about 210 pounds the last time that i saw him and he passed away weighing about 110 to 125 and so cancer is a bad boy and uh and so we just we just pray that god would just be with his family as a wonderful family his wife and she's just shattered by it all and then her daughter and a son-in-law and you might recognize his son-in-law he's the one that is one of the song leaders at brother donnie reagan's that he shaves his head like brother shannon so well you're letting a little hair grow god bless your heart amen well listen it's a fad going on here amen so but we want to pray for them that god would just be with them in a special way amen i got word this week that the church in china is doing well uh there's there's there's a bunch of churches there but the one that i spoke in is about got about 200 people and they no longer have a church it's been done away with by the government and all of that's gone and so if you think you have problems i just want to just drop this to you without saying too much they just kind of send signals where they're going to be gathering at at next sunday service and they don't even know and the pastor will feel led to go this place or to this place or to this place and and assembling 200 people in an apartment in an apartment that's what they're doing and they believe this message with everything that is within them amen and amen and so one of the pastors is brother caleb and he i think they have i don't know exactly how many that they have in their assembly but their assembly is still going strong and they're doing the very same thing and he gets out of prison in november and so please pray for him that god would just be with them amen without saying too much he went into prison in the summer and so that was the took summer clothes and they've had their coldest winter in china in literally decades and he don't have any clothes other than those clothes and so he prayed that he could get a job of ironing clothes so he could get warm and they gave him that job amen and so amen and so he's he's just he sent word this week that that to tell me hello he's still hanging on so if you think you've had a bad day or it was difficult to get to church today you didn't have to look around to see if somebody was tailing you or watching you and when you got into the church service you don't have to worry that that if they catch me here i'm going to go to hard prison so thank god for america amen amen amen god bless you this has been on my heart this this last couple of weeks and so here i am i get to deliver this satan may fight but we're still standing amen if you will turn with me to romans chapter 4 and then we'll go to psalms 24. and i've just got a few scriptures for you this morning then we'll go right into the word i'd like to take a part of the series of champion but today i'd like to i would like to take a portion of it and speak on persistence we are still standing romans 4 and verse 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all seed not only which is of the law but to that which is also faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb i want you to notice these next words he staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god hallelujah and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform you may be seated this this morning in psalms 24 and verse 7 lift up your heads all you gates and all you lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in i'm glad to be a part of that who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads o you gates and even lift them up ye everlasting doors the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory say law brother branham will use the scripture and this day the is fulfilled which was a prophetic message it was it was a god of prophecy and then it became a god of history so when the event comes up into the event it's prophecy the event happens and then it becomes history the scripture says in isaiah chapter 61 and verse 1 the spirit of the lord is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound and to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god and to comfort all that mourn now that was a prophecy from isaiah that jesus would fulfill and then brother branham would come along and preach a sermon going this day this scripture is fulfilled now i i want to remind you that you and i have lived in a very special day and we're living in very special times to where we're watching the end of the gentile dispensation and being the bride of jesus christ our eyes are very alert to the happenings that are going on around us sodom and gomorrah does not affect us we were built to live in this day the world that is falling apart does not affect us we have an anchor we have an anchor we have a word that has gripped our hearts and we know who we are and we know where we stand and we're not going back we're not going back we're standing on a solid rock and we have an assurance today i want to read you a scripture that has been in prophetic form and now is being fulfilled before our eyes but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as your others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with them for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep i just want to say this to you even in these coveted conditions many have asked me when will we all get to be back together again and be able to come to both services on the weekend i'm praying very shortly right but we're not we're not alone even now even in the unseen realm and i'm not talking about the internet there is a gathering that is happening there's a gathering that's taking place because the season on the earth is just before the rapture so there's a gathering taking place in another realm and they're getting ready to take a half a step this way and we're going to take a half a step that way this scripture is going to be history hallelujah that which has been prophecy for 2 000 years is about to happen and i want to just anchor this this morning and there's nothing the devil can do to stop it now brother branham says he says now good morning this comes from shalom means peace darkness is gathering what is it gathering for to show the light isaiah 60 and verse 1 and he quotes it rise and shine for the light has come to you that's the reason i say shalom the light has come to you god's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who god notices and he pins it down those who god before the foundation of the world called out and ordained to that let me just say he hand picked you to live in this age are you with me now he picked you to live in this stage the rest of them will never see it they'll never know nothing about it the bible said so and jesus said no man will come to me except my father my father draws him first and all the father has given me will come this is now your scripture to him that overcometh 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches a lot of people hear but they don't hear a lot of people see but they don't see jesus would say blessed are your eyes for you see your ears for you here luke 9 and verse 52 and jesus said unto him no man you heard this last week no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god one place in the scripture jesus calls one woman's name in a sodom and gomorrah age and he's also leaking it to our day remember lot's wife as the fire was falling she looked back are you with me hold on to that thought first john chapter 3 and verse 1 behold what manner of the love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not quite a statement the world knoweth us not your neighbors your friends even your loved ones some of them really don't know you you know brother branham was around a lot of people and they really didn't know who he was they really didn't know as i spoke to one young man last night i said i'm more than your uncle i'm more than your uncle to you i'm more than your friend amen are you with me so the world knows us not because they knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now brother brahma drops these next couple of quotes and i just want to give them for you he said what if god would have told john the revelator now it's going to be 2 000 years before my coming and john would have came back and told the church well i guess you may as well eat and drink and be merry cause there's going to be many generations and jesus ain't going to come for 2000 years the church would have got loose there would have been no on the mark on the mark there would have been no waiting and after all it's your anticipations if you fall asleep in that watch that you wake with them you wake with them same anticipations because it ain't going to hinder one thing you're going to be right there on time anyway you see what i mean now watch these next words when saint martin awakes in the resurrection and saint paul and the rest of them it'll be just as fresh as they went right in the battle battling away because they went right down under the same anticipations looking for his coming and there will come a scream will come and the whole church you talking about a church service hallelujah they spent their life for christ they gave it their whole energies they were champions of their age hallelujah they overcome in some very dark times but on resurrection morning they'll skip from that realm to our realm hallelujah and they'll experience a resurrection hallelujah we'll experience that resurrection with them the change of our bodies um i could preach a long time right there now watch this god's purpose can never be defeated i want you to settle that right now god's got a plan god's got a blueprint god's got this all put together he knows where you are where you're setting the situation you're going through and he's got a plan he knows how to get you here sister kirsten he knows how to put you in a certain place and he knows this is not the end of it and god's purpose can never be defeated now watch this there is nothing out of out of that can defeat it so how happy we ought to be today rested upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the living god there is neither things present or things that can come there's no sickness there's no sorrow no death no pearls there nor nothing can separate us from the living god well brother ron that's a beautiful quote that scripture that has been written for almost 2 000 years and millions of our family has lived through some horrible conditions and some horrible sicknesses and been simming some horrible prisons and died in some very wicked ways but it kept them and nothing can defeat the purpose of god what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart he says purposed in his heart to bring to pass there's no demon there's no power there's nothing that can ever separate god's immutable eternal plan it must be as he has god has said psalms 27 very familiar all of these things are familiar the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing that i have desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about and therefore i will occur in the tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord i will oh lord when i cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me and when thou said seeketh my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek hide not my face far from me put my put not my servant away in anger for thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and mother forsake me i'm reading these scriptures with real depth and meaning now when my father and mother forsake me then the lord will take me up teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of my enemies deliver me not over into the will of mine enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord i've been a message believer since i was a child i was raised in the message as a little boy i stood at brother branham's casket and i remember i remember all the people being there that's the only time i ever saw brother branham in the flesh and it was at his funeral my father was a believer i think he came to the message in in somewhere of the year i was born about 60 or 61. i'm 59 so you don't have to get your mind there so i grew up in the message fourth grade i stood up on a desk and i said in 1977 the world's going to come to an end that's what was being taught that's what i believed los angeles is going to have an earthquake it's going to fall beneath the ocean men looked at brother branham's visions and had different thoughts about them different things we're men we're human beings we we look from our human perspective but brother branham taught us that god is his own interpreter now understand when it comes to god he's not a big hurry you see there's predestinated seed why the delay predestinated seed he's not going to lose one of us so the conditions of the world has get it got to get exactly right and there can be prophecies as we just read to you of isaiah 61 we could have read isaiah 9 and they would go for hundreds of years and there would be a lot of conjectures in a lot of different ways too but one day it come to pass but it didn't happen like they thought it would they didn't think it would come through a teenage girl that didn't attend their church and wasn't a part of the priestly line but she was the girl that god predestinated to carry the body the baby of jesus christ and she fulfilled the vision and the world hated her they make a god out of her today but the world hated her at that time they would have stoned her had it not been for joseph the protection of god you have a hallelujah hey man they're going to they're going to get a slide up for me okay how many seen this this week i'd like for you to leave that slide up for a little while if you don't mind i apologize if it does something crazy on the internet but can they see that on the internet as well yes okay okay can everybody see that okay right now at least you know what it is that's purple by the way and just for good measure the one that made the dress made the outfit said it was royal purple i've heard a lot of nonsense this week about it being blue well you might want to get a new tv monitor some men are just liars is all they are i'm not a politician and i don't care i was asked just a few couple months ago if i would be an advisor to one of our local politicians in richmond but i'm too busy i was honored to be asked but i'm too busy for that they offered me politics many years ago but i was too busy for it then i'm too busy for it now and even when it comes to the message i'm not a politician either so i'd like to just is everybody comfortable i'd like to just rehearse a few things here with this picture in mind sites will progress in such a way until they will make a car that will not have to be guided by a steering wheel and the cars will continue to be shaped like an egg until the consummation the end time i see the american family going down the road in a broad way riding in a car backs turned around towards the wheel should be and they look like they're playing checkers or carts and and we we've got it on television popular science mechanics rather all have it we got the cars controlled by remote control by radar and they won't even have to have any steering wheel in it just set your dial like that like you dial your phone have you caught that like you dial your phone and your car takes you right onto it do you remember what the phone was like in 1933 you know for those that want to be a critic of brother branham do you remember what the phone was like in 1933 every person in your area was on your landline and you waited till they got off of the phone to where you could make your call and it was it was it had a deal that you held to your ear and you spoke in a in a horn and you dialed it and you stood there with it and there's children in here that's got computer phones that supersedes that model by a million miles but brother branham saw not just the car car's here oh we're waiting on that car cars are here cars are here i can go out there i can't drive no more but that suburban you just put it on the road and you just you just let it and it'll drive for you you don't want me driving but it'll drive for you you can punch in on the map like we're getting ready to do in about an hour and say show us the funeral home and it'll guide you right to the funeral home oh brother ron but one day that'll be fulfilled already he said he predicted this 30 years before it happened he said it brings us to the election of president kennedy you remember he said they give women the right to vote and they'd vote in a boy president and just as it was with elijah and ahab we had elijah and a jezebel a kennedy a catholic man are you with me and he turned our nation our morals fell apart and i'm not getting into your politics you you can put whatever sign you want to in the yard that's that that's up to you that's when you and god and this car coming on the scene bringing five things out of seven he said that has happened exactly he talked of hitler he talked to mussolini he talked to the world wars and it happened exactly find another man on the scene that did one millionth of what brother branham did if brother branham what what in malachi 4 5 and 6 and revelations 10 7 then you better find you an elijah if he didn't fit this ministry didn't fit and besides that once he left here is a people that are the manifested word for the day and i want to report to you we're still standing [Music] he said now i predicted and have said i saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in a in real highly purple like purple i got a parenthesis down there she was a great ruler of the united states perhaps the catholic church a a woman or some woman i don't know it'll be cat it'll be the catholic church i don't know i can't say only thing i've seen is i seen the woman that was all purple represented the catholic church and that's why he would say it like that well you say well brother ron you have an active catholic president now are you with me now you have seven catholic supreme court judges whether you want to believe it or not we're a catholic nation it was predicted you can see it with your eyes it's not up for argument are you with me i respect her i respect him it's not up for argument this is what our prophets he said i won't have time this in this meeting to tell you 1933 this is a woman's nation it's the number 13. it appears in the 13th chapter of revelations 13 stars 13 stripes 13 everything's a 13. everything's a woman and remember thus saith the lord there will be a woman rule over the before the end time she'll either be president vice president it'll be the catholic church as a woman i've i've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus saith the lord write it down find out you young people see if it happens i want to say this to you this day this day this scripture is fulfilled he said see if it happens write it down and find out your young people see if it happens and if it isn't i'm a false prophet let me just say this week fulfilled now let me let me just just tell you quickly and i'm not going to i'm not going to i'm going to give you a couple things every man is put into position to fulfill the plan of god every president comes in and he fulfills a plan of god donald trump moved the embassy to jerusalem it was a part of the covenant of the scriptures that it had to be done the world hated him for doing it and he was driven to do it and he did it and he fulfilled the scriptures now this man has already fulfilled many scriptures he has released at the stroke of a pen sodom and gomorrah are you with me i don't care if i get in trouble now but he has released the homosexual transgender community with the stroke of a pen and with the stroke of this of another pen just like that one he turned this nation against israel and told them to go back to the 1967 boundaries and give up the land this nation's got to turn against israel and if you're waiting for another president to turn against it it's already done it it's only been there just a couple days he has stood with the pope several times i find it interesting that three of the most powerful women in politics had the same color on now it represents the the suffrage movement with women getting the right to vote women had been fighting women have been fighting for the right to vote since the civil war but we had a prophet that came in this day and said they'll get the right to vote and i don't believe that women's a second-rate citizen as a matter of fact i applaud you with all my heart i treat you as a queen you know some people want to go away and say we treat women bad well let me just say i got a queen back there and i've never treated her bad a day in my life and i got her mother that rides in the car a lot of times with me and i've never treated her bad and i got a daughter and i never treat her bad and i wouldn't treat you bad you remember brother branham never warned us you know everybody wants to fight socialism that's causing all the riots in our nation or communism but it's catholicism that you got to be careful with that man of peace that'll settle it all down you see even in this world we picked a choice that looked like a more peaceful solution now we see all of these things happening and we realize that we're in a lukewarm age where everything's accepted it's a lazy age we we we want everything painful we we honestly do we want everything paid for we want we want we want the government to teach our children we want the government to pay our college bills we we want the government to take care of us and we turn our back on god are you with me you see it was in the stages to where that different different thoughts begin to come up and it was a man that that was a president that looked a whole lot like me warned us that these things were coming and as a matter of fact he spoke the man in the arena and he went around the world speaking the man in the arena and he said there's a spirit rising in the age and he said socialism and then he then he went toward the catholicism and bash them that was teddy roosevelt in case you didn't get that and i can't remember for the life of me right now whether he was a republican or democrat but it don't matter but we live in a lukewarm age where there's no commitment marriage in divorce is about like eating candy you don't like this one you just get another one you don't like this one you just get another one but brother brown said you stay as you are and teach your children to never do that thing again we had a message to come along and clear up the way we dress the way we conduct because we're not citizens of this world we're citizens of another world and brother branham will spend in future home for example brother branham will spend 45 minutes complimenting the people for their conduct in the city and in the restaurants and in the motels and and on the street compliment them for their good conduct why did this take so long because our life is an example of this message this message lives look at our families just look at our families look what god's done for our church our churches around the world china that we just listen they haven't had the message long but they're willing to give their life for this message and they're passionate and they're energetic the message didn't come in chinese it came in english and sisters and brothers grabbed a hold of that and said they had to translate it and then translated the bible so that they could be a portion of the bride of jesus christ they were driven with persistence i'm going to say something it may hurt feelings but so what i don't give you a quarter for for an experience that'll only get you to church once in a while listen this message is what i think about when i get up in the morning and when i go to bed at night church is more than just saturday evening and sunday morning to me it's a living reality in my life there's nothing in this world worth going back for hello brother ron well i sometimes forget what this message is done for you're here you're here to keep you here is a great big deal i can't keep you here brother andrew can't keep you here brother homer couldn't keep you here brother joel can't keep you in church as a matter of fact we can't even put the desire inside of your heart but can you remember what you was before you got the message josh jones was a biker in a gang with a really bad reputation here's brother denny that was a professional wrestler that was on his way into higher realms when the word came and found him many of you you know when we come to our ancestry.com we want to know if we're akin to princess diana or george washington or some famous person most of us in our families had harlots drunks derelicts but they were carrying your seed your natural seed they were carrying your seed and god watched over them though they were a derelict drunk harlot prostitute whatever he watched over them because they were carrying you we have been told that the rapture is in this message we heard last night it's the resurrection we've experienced a resurrection we've already experienced the resurrection we're going to experience it in an even greater way but the token applied to our home when rahab applied the token to her home it protected her when the world fell apart i don't know but i if i could grab your thoughts just for a moment what it would have been like as the walls fall apart and the city falls apart and you just knew you was a believer and that scarlet cord that was hanging out your window was giving you protection it was everything and her responsibility was to get her family into the house now young people let me just say some things to you and i want to i want to be a brief as i can but let me just say it is in your natural genes to rebel it's in your natural genes to rebel and to turn away from parents it's just built into the natural genetic of of humans to rebel but you can overcome that you can overcome that you can be the first one at the car saying we got to get to church you can be the one that says hey we haven't prayed we haven't read our bible we haven't did our devotions today let's get that done because life is busy and and and satan is used as a tool of being busy and 24 hours can go so quickly until you neglect the thing that's going to change your body this is good y'all good stuff sister joyce rahab watched the walls fall i linked that to an experience that i had as i was they bored holes in my head put a rack on my head and i was suffering like i'd never suffered before and i was going to lay in basically an mri tube and they were going to gamma ray my brain for over three hours and i prayed that my grandchildren and my children would never have to go through anything like i was going through but at the point of it all is well here's what i want to drive there was people around the world praying for me and calling my name that i would have strength to go through it but i was the man in the arena for the day whether you know it or not it's not just ron spencer but whether you know it or not you're being prayed for around the world and we're praying for them around the world and some of them are going through difficult situations sometimes people think well cope it's such a difficult situation and it is more people have died to covet than just died in world wars and it's bad but there's worse coming there's a whole lot worse coming because covid is only a cold with a death string in it and there's two more rounds of covet coming are you scared no i i don't fear it i i don't fear the cancer why should i fear it god's greater than the cancer he's greater than the covenant can i have your attention just a few more moments abraham met melchizedek and he said literally just feet apart and looked into his eyes there was negotiations about sodom and gomorrah being destroyed god spoke to his prophet because he's got to send a warning before he sends judgment so brother branham's ministry whether it was in spindale or whether it was in jeffersonville or in finland was a warning handwriting is up on the wall the world is falling apart listen 50 years ago 60 years ago we're way down the road now due to god's long suffering and the delay but we are watching prophecy take place around us so let me just say this is no time to go to sleep and i'm driving this sermon persistence last week we spoke on the mind of a champion but now you got to be perseverant you got to be persistent you got to know where you stand it's not a time to dilly dally wish he were she well i'm just upset because of my feelings get past your human feelings get past your human unbelief grab a hold to the anchor of the word of god and hold on to it like never before what was it like for abraham to watch the smoke rise from sodom hey millions of people just perished and the smoke rises and abraham knew it was coming and the angels went and to lot's home showed him grace but look what a spiritual condition that lot was in he offered his daughters to those men but abraham knew that the god that he had set at the tent with in a few days would change his body so when he was watching the smoke rise he knew the next part was the change of his body because in that body he could not produce the challenge of the hour but in the body that melchizedek had promised him and sarah they could produce a child i can't go in a rapture in this body so if i stay waiting on the word and hanging on to it this word will more than just heal cancer it'll change my body hallelujah it'll change my voice 42-inch horns and i believe it but the man that stood in the green checkered shirt stood in this in this pulpit behind this desk and told us i was there and the horns were exactly 42 inches and on the way back down off of the mountain that silver-tipped grizzly bear when the man said i can see for miles and it's not there are you doubting division sometimes i just think about people that want to walk away are you doubting the vision this ain't a time to doubt it do you know that just real quickly people that fall away from the message will say that's blue or have all kind of well that that don't shake me i don't shake me whatsoever when moses stood there with a rod in his hand and he threw it down and it produced snakes the egyptians did the same thing but god snake ate theirs and he picked it back up and it was a rod again and then fleas came and flies came and frogs came and the water became blood and they just tried to explain it away [Applause] and jesus came and he produced miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle and they just tried to explain it away uh and the message has came and they just tried to explain it away but i want to say this day is this scripture fulfilled this day we're living in this moment this is our hour this is our promise [Music] hold on to the word like never before hallelujah and let me finish with these words you're welcome to stand we're still standing i know i cannot convey my feelings right now i just cannot convey it i've had a lot of trials i've had a lot of tests i've had a lot of friends walk away i seen god doing books book of acts things in my life it happened even last night here in this building things you can't explain not just lives touched lives changed brother gene this is more than just a break for you but he came to change your life to give you a fresh drink i'd say it's good choice but nathaniel he'll not destroy you there's a blessing coming amen hallelujah can i say this to you i don't think we'll be assembling this way much longer amen look up your redemption is near look up your redemption is near look in the mirror one morning you look in there and you'll be young again it's in the promise hallelujah oh god if i could just explain what i feel i don't think there's words that can say it and put it just right but lord it's you that's kept us not just the tingle up and down our spine or something that makes us shout or jump we enjoy all of those things but something that anchors our soul when the world is falling apart whether it's rahab watching the walls fall or noah watching the water come up on the boat what it must have been like for them when they felt the boat cut and begin to float [Music] lord jesus what a day that will be when we come to this church and we're all young and we just know it's happening because we're in the vision it's not a caribou or a silver tip grizzly bear that just showed us what god can do a squirrel but we've watched the transformation from coming from a drug addict alcoholic to become an anchored son and daughter of god there's just nothing in the world that'll shake us maybe there's one this morning that just say brother ron i just need a baptism of the holy ghost his life to anchor me like never before to settle every question in my mind that it just be settled more than a picture in a church or a quote that's being written a lord anchor in my soul like never before lord god remember my loved ones my children children's children when it looks like it's totally impossible god you're a god that's faithful lord and i ask you that you'd minister minister all across this audience just now we applaud a token we took you at your word we don't want to lose a one lord jesus maybe there are those that's turned their back on you lord may you deal with their hearts even today turn them around in the name of jesus christ turned them from where they were father many years ago i remember praying a prayer such as that over a young lady her husband had left and been gone for years and god turned that man around that day he came home to be her husband later the pastor of that church but you're the same god that is here this morning father you're a god of the impossibilities in the name of jesus christ anchor our soul put a persistence in us like never before not natural persistence but anchor our soul with a heavenly realm father touch our hearts even now in jesus christ's name i pray jesus name hallelujah just lift your hand to him now just worship him let it be an intimate moment with him just now there is a land i'm home [Music] they're waiting on that show there is a land [Music] brother terry's waiting on me [Music] and it's not [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] slow [Applause] [Music] i have seen [Music] found no place [Music] here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's sing it as a church today [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is [Music] [Applause] [Music] and they'll slow down [Applause] [Music] just not myself hearing anymore i'm longing for that open door that leads [Music] [Applause] oh to i'll try these sweeping eyes i'll lift my head towards [Music] this world goodbye i'm going to [Music] that i'm [Music] i've got loved ones they're waiting on that show and it's not a million miles away
