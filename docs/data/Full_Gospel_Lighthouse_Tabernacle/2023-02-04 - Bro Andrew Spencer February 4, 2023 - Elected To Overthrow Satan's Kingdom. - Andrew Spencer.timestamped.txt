[44:32] father we come before you Lord Jesus
[44:35] and Lord we have our our cups turned

[44:41] we sincerely desire father that you'd
[44:44] fill us Lord Jesus
[44:46] Lord fill us with your spirit Lord
[44:49] Fearless with your nature and your
[44:52] desire
[44:53] the Lord may we empty ourselves out
[44:55] father
[44:56] Lord that we wouldn't be full of
[44:58] ourselves we wouldn't be full of the
[45:00] world but we'll be full of you father
[45:03] Lord I really feel Lord Jesus that we
[45:06] are at the coming of the Lord father and
[45:09] we don't want anything here to hinder us
[45:11] father
[45:12] Lord to to escape the judgments that are
[45:15] to come and Lord we sincerely desire
[45:18] father that you would wash us that we'd
[45:22] be wider than snow father and Lord I as
[45:25] I heard the prophets say today Lord if
[45:27] if I'm not a Believer make me a Believer
[45:29] if there's any here that isn't a
[45:32] Believer to not make them a Believer
[45:34] father Lord I feel Lord if our Prophet
[45:37] could stand there seeing all the actions
[45:40] and seeing the demonstrations of the
[45:42] Holy Spirit you could stand there in the
[45:44] closing hours of his ministry and said
[45:45] Lord if I'm not a Believer make me a
[45:47] Believer I pray father that you'd come
[45:50] Lord and may you take our unbelief
[45:52] father and cast it aside and build our
[45:54] faith up in you father we recognize Lord
[45:57] tonight that there is a gathering of
[45:59] people father but these people have not
[46:02] gathered Lord Jesus Lord to take up an
[46:04] empty Pew father but Lord they have
[46:06] gathered Lord to hear from you father
[46:08] Lord we are a very special people Lord
[46:12] that we get very we're very aware that
[46:15] you're here father because we brought
[46:17] you here and your word said that we're
[46:19] two or three are gathered in my name
[46:21] there you'll be in the midst of them and
[46:24] father we recognize that we are in the
[46:26] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost father and
[46:28] in this atmosphere Supernatural events
[46:31] begin to transpire and take place father
[46:33] and Lord I would ask Lord I know that
[46:36] there's sometimes Lord Jesus that that
[46:38] an atmosphere doesn't transfer over
[46:41] throughout the streaming but father I
[46:44] know there's great power in an
[46:46] atmosphere but I pray those on the other
[46:48] side of this stream father we've got
[46:50] family that are setting here that that
[46:52] that are sick tonight Lord and can't be
[46:55] here but I pray father that that you
[46:57] would compensate father and you would
[46:59] begin to translate Lord the same
[47:01] atmosphere that's in this room through
[47:03] that stream father I think it's a very
[47:06] very amazing that we that are accustomed
[47:10] to the moving of the Holy Spirit we
[47:12] recognize what is happening father even
[47:15] though we may be thousands of miles away
[47:17] we recognize that it's your doing father
[47:20] and we want to be careful father tonight
[47:22] Lord to give you due Lord what is your
[47:25] glory and your honor father now Lord I
[47:28] ask God that you would move us all aside
[47:30] Lord we're all very needy people father
[47:32] Lord I know that we're in a season of
[47:35] time father that we recognize that the
[47:37] bodies can become weakened under
[47:39] conditions of sickness but I pray that
[47:42] the Healer would rise in this place with
[47:44] healing in his wings and you would root
[47:46] over this congregation and over your
[47:49] children tonight Lord that they could
[47:51] experience the healing touch of the
[47:52] master Lord as you'd walk with the pews
[47:55] tonight and move through this this place
[47:57] I pray God that you would just begin to
[48:00] liberate people in their Spirit father
[48:02] may they begin to let go of of the
[48:04] circumstances of life and may they
[48:06] recognize
[48:08] that the Holy One of Israel is in the
[48:11] midst of the Church of the Living God
[48:13] father we commit this service unto you
[48:15] tonight I pray you'd bless us as we get
[48:18] out of the way tonight and we completely
[48:19] yield ourselves over to the power of the
[48:22] Holy Spirit just now in the name of the
[48:25] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you have
[48:29] your Bibles this evening we'd like to
[48:31] look over in the book of Exodus
[48:33] the book of Exodus chapter 23 and verse
[48:37] 20.
[48:38] and down to Ephesians the book of
[48:41] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3 there
[48:44] read a few scriptures
[48:47] from both places there tonight
[48:57] and Exodus chapter 23
[49:01] verse 20 if you have not read these
[49:04] scriptures
[49:06] they're very lovely
[49:08] they're very lovely and I
[49:11] I believe that it's something that we we
[49:13] should be very aware of that the angel
[49:15] of the Lord goes before us in all things
[49:18] amen I believe that the Lord knows how
[49:21] to trouble the waters before before we
[49:23] ever get into getting to this place he's
[49:26] already begin to stir and begin to
[49:28] change change situations before you ever
[49:31] got here to get you into a condition to
[49:34] be able to receive what he is getting
[49:36] ready to disperse I think it's amazing
[49:39] how the Lord can deal with his children
[49:41] on both ends and he can align the
[49:44] service just for you and I I think it's
[49:46] amazing that the Lord can custom fit a
[49:49] service for one individual but he can
[49:51] take one service and begin to deal with
[49:53] people's hearts all over this building
[49:55] and everyone will sit here and think my
[49:57] goodness he was talking directly to me I
[50:00] love it when the Lord begins to he just
[50:02] custom fits a service just for us and so
[50:05] let's just read these scriptures tonight
[50:07] Exodus chapter 23 and verse 20. behold I
[50:11] sent an angel before thee to keep thee
[50:14] in the way and to bring thee into the
[50:17] place which I have prepared beware of
[50:20] him and obey his voice provoke him not
[50:23] for he will not Harden your
[50:25] transgressions for my name is in him but
[50:29] if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and
[50:31] do all that I speak then I will be an
[50:33] enemy unto thine enemies and an
[50:35] adversary under thine adversaries for my
[50:38] angels shall go before thee and bring
[50:40] thee in unto the amorites the Hittites
[50:43] the parisites the Canaanites the hivites
[50:45] and the jebusites and I will cut them
[50:48] off and thou shall not bow down to their
[50:50] gods nor serve them nor do after their
[50:54] works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow
[50:57] them and quite break down their images
[50:59] and you shall serve the Lord your God
[51:03] let's say that together and you shall
[51:05] serve the Lord your God
[51:07] and he shall bless thy bread and thy
[51:09] water and I will take away I will take
[51:12] sickness away from the midst of thee
[51:14] there shall nothing cast their young nor
[51:16] be Barren in thy land the number of thy
[51:20] days I will fulfill I will send my fear
[51:23] before thee and will destroy all the
[51:26] people to whom Thou shalt come and I
[51:28] will make an end I will make all thine
[51:31] enemies turn their backs unto thee and I
[51:35] will send Hornets before thee which
[51:37] shall drive out the heaven the Canaanite
[51:39] and the hitchhot from before thee
[51:42] Ephesians chapter 1. in verse 3.
[51:46] it's lovely when the Lord
[51:49] will fight your battles for you and you
[51:51] don't have to fight them but you can
[51:54] rest in Secure knowing that the Lord is
[51:56] fighting your battles
[51:58] by these scripture readings we recognize
[52:00] that Israel can only be blessed when she
[52:03] is in her land
[52:06] it's the only way that Israel can ever
[52:08] be blessed is when she is in her land
[52:10] and when she is in her land she is in
[52:12] the portion that the Lord has divided
[52:14] unto her now notice that Ephesians
[52:17] Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua
[52:20] notice that this is our inheritance it
[52:23] is the inheritance of the believer
[52:26] Ephesians if you haven't went through it
[52:28] the last lately I would admonish you
[52:30] especially your young people to go
[52:32] through the book of Ephesians and the
[52:34] Book of Philippians it'll do you great
[52:35] well it'll do you really it'll it'll
[52:38] strengthen your your Christian walk but
[52:40] notice Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3
[52:42] blessed be the God and father of our
[52:45] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[52:48] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[52:51] places in Christ according as he hath
[52:55] chosen Us in him let's say that together
[52:57] he hath chosen Us in him before the
[53:01] foundation of the world that we should
[53:03] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[53:06] love having predestinated us unto the
[53:09] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[53:13] himself according to the good pleasure
[53:16] of his will may God bless his word he
[53:19] may be seated in the presence of the
[53:20] Lord and by the help of the Lord I'd
[53:22] like to speak to you tonight on a
[53:24] thought on elected to overthrow Satan's
[53:27] kingdom elected to overthrow Satan's
[53:31] kingdom and Webster describes that word
[53:33] overthrow it it means it has the meaning
[53:36] to turn upside down or to throw down to
[53:40] ruin or to demolish to defeat to conquer
[53:44] to Vanquish as to overthrow an army or
[53:49] an enemy to ruin to demolish to defeat
[53:52] or to conquer and to Vanquish and to
[53:55] think that tonight that God would use
[53:57] the elect of God to overthrow the enemy
[54:00] and and we recognize that it is a
[54:03] paradox that God would take human beings
[54:05] that have mortalities surrounding them
[54:08] and they would take an immortality or an
[54:11] immortal word and they would overcome
[54:13] the Enemy by that word of demonstration
[54:17] or that word of power that is allotted
[54:19] to them in their generation and the
[54:22] reason why the church or the children of
[54:24] Israel was moving into the promised land
[54:26] was because there was a promise that was
[54:29] foretold that they were going to go into
[54:31] that land and they had all kinds of
[54:33] enemies that were already there but this
[54:36] was their land and they had to go in
[54:38] there and they had to go in and possess
[54:41] that land and there's a lot of things
[54:43] that the enemy would like to squat on
[54:45] and say that that he has ownership of
[54:48] but brother Brandon would tell us in the
[54:50] restoration of the broad tree that Satan
[54:52] is a squatter and we are to kick him off
[54:55] of our land it's the same way with our
[54:57] healing without with anything that the
[55:00] Lord has for us all of the blessings of
[55:02] the Lord there is an enemy that would
[55:04] like to keep you off of your rightful
[55:07] property but you have the ability by the
[55:09] word of God to go in there and to
[55:12] overthrow the kingdom of Satan now
[55:15] notice the Bible says in Proverbs 12 and
[55:17] 7 that the wicked are overthrown and are
[55:20] not but the house of the righteous shall
[55:23] stand so notice that the wicked are
[55:25] overthrown and there is nothing left of
[55:28] them again Proverbs 14 11 that the house
[55:31] of the wicked shall be overthrown but
[55:34] the Tabernacle of the upper right is
[55:36] Chef Roars now I personally enjoy
[55:39] watching a good fight and personally
[55:41] enjoy watching when God begins to
[55:43] overthrow Satan's plans and all of his
[55:46] devices and all of his techniques that
[55:49] he has built against us as a children of
[55:51] God I personally enjoy it then when God
[55:54] goes in there and all of the things that
[55:56] Satan has devised against us to be evil
[56:00] that God turns those things into into
[56:03] good for our good because we are the
[56:05] cause called according to his purpose
[56:08] and I think it's amazing when you can go
[56:10] back and you can it's easy for us to go
[56:13] back and look throughout the Old
[56:14] Testament and we can see that there was
[56:16] a promise for the children of God for
[56:18] them to go in there and to possess their
[56:20] inheritance but it's amazing when when
[56:22] the when job didn't have a Bible and job
[56:25] didn't have a letter that was set before
[56:26] him but job had a faith that was
[56:29] resilient against all of the Skeptics
[56:31] that were saying that he was a carnal
[56:33] believer or he was a secret sinner but
[56:36] there if job had a faith in almighty God
[56:39] that God was his inheritance and job
[56:43] overthrew the doubt of the Enemy by his
[56:46] faith in almighty God and you know that
[56:48] God and Satan had a conversation about
[56:51] job that job that God had a conversation
[56:54] with him about job and job was job was
[56:57] being talked about by almighty God and
[57:00] the arch enemy of God and he was having
[57:02] a conversation that this man this man
[57:04] job he was he was such a man and the
[57:07] Bible would declare to us in Job chapter
[57:10] 1 that this man was perfect and to think
[57:12] that God had looked upon job's life
[57:14] before he ever had a conversation with
[57:17] Satan he had looked upon job's life and
[57:20] there God looked upon his life and he
[57:22] had a conversation about this man I'd
[57:25] say that we could have this kind of
[57:26] conversation maybe about yourself here
[57:29] tonight or or any believer that's filled
[57:31] with the Holy Ghost that God has had a
[57:33] conversation with Satan they're a real
[57:35] believer they can go through the thick
[57:37] and they can go through the sin and I
[57:39] will be there with them because I am
[57:41] their God and they are my children and
[57:44] God had a conversation about job he said
[57:46] no matter what you do to him he'll not
[57:49] curse me he'll not turn his back against
[57:51] me because job had something on the
[57:54] inside of him that a vision had broke
[57:56] over his life that he could recognize
[57:59] that the god of the atmosphere was a God
[58:02] over every situation in his life and
[58:05] I'll tell you if you begin to catch that
[58:06] Vision tonight that God is here in this
[58:09] place right now he's working in your
[58:11] midst he's working over your situation
[58:15] but we recognize that the Bible was not
[58:17] written to show us only what God has
[58:19] done in the past but the Bible was
[58:21] written to show us who God is and what
[58:24] he wants to do in every generation and
[58:26] in every Walk of Life and everywhere on
[58:29] the Earth but we recognize that God is
[58:31] wanting to display his attributes he's
[58:34] wanting to display his power now we
[58:37] recognize that brother random I'm just
[58:38] going to lay some things down real real
[58:40] heavily at first here tonight and then
[58:42] we'll jump over and begin to preach to
[58:44] you but you're very aware of these
[58:46] things and I'm getting ready to bring to
[58:47] you but if you could just amen and agree
[58:50] with it it will just establish a
[58:52] foundation real quick that brother
[58:54] Brandon would tell us in the greatest
[58:56] battle ever fought he said now the great
[58:58] he said the first battle that was ever
[59:00] fought began in heaven when Michael and
[59:02] his angels fought against Lucifer and
[59:04] his angels He said it first started the
[59:07] first battle was in heaven so sin did
[59:09] not originate here on Earth it
[59:10] originated in heaven he said and then it
[59:13] was thrown down from heaven cast out of
[59:16] Heaven to the Earth and fell on human
[59:19] beings then the battle from Angels
[59:21] become human battles and Satan come to
[59:24] destroy God's creation what God had
[59:26] created to be for himself he had Satan
[59:30] come to destroy this that was his
[59:33] purpose that was to destroy it then the
[59:36] battle began here on Earth and began in
[59:38] us and has been raging ever since so
[59:42] Angelic battles Angelic battles became
[59:44] human battles and you can look that
[59:47] there God was not surprised by all of
[59:50] the doings of Satan or Lucifer they are
[59:53] in heaven and notice that God and the
[59:55] angels in heaven were victorious
[59:58] so it is a sound to you tonight that if
[1:00:02] those Angelic battles have become human
[1:00:04] battles it is assigned to us as a Church
[1:00:06] of the Living God that we are going to
[1:00:09] be victorious
[1:00:11] now we know that that Satan needs Satan
[1:00:14] needs a vehicle Satan needs somebody
[1:00:17] that he can work through he is a spirit
[1:00:19] he's real and he's he's just as real as
[1:00:22] you sitting here tonight but he needs a
[1:00:24] body that he can work through you see
[1:00:27] God is a spirit and God has got to have
[1:00:30] a body that he can work through is that
[1:00:32] right and so Satan needed a vehicle so
[1:00:36] that he could work through and you
[1:00:37] notice his technique as soon as he's
[1:00:40] kicked out of heaven that he immediately
[1:00:42] goes down to the Garden of Eden and he
[1:00:44] begins to cast out and reasonings over
[1:00:47] onto the daughter of almighty God and
[1:00:49] where did he begin to battle her at was
[1:00:51] in the human mind because that is where
[1:00:54] decisions are made at but the Bible
[1:00:57] tells us and Paul was very clear on this
[1:00:59] that though we walk in the flesh we
[1:01:02] don't war after the flesh for the
[1:01:04] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:01:06] but they are Mighty and strong in
[1:01:09] pulling down the strongholds of of Satan
[1:01:12] but notice what he said he said that we
[1:01:15] are to bring every thought subject to
[1:01:18] The Obedience of almighty God now if you
[1:01:21] begin to just take a few minutes and
[1:01:23] begin to think just for a moment that if
[1:01:25] you would take every thought that has
[1:01:27] passed through your mind if you would
[1:01:29] bring it under the Obedience of Christ
[1:01:31] I'd say that you'd have a different
[1:01:33] outlook on all things in your life I'd
[1:01:36] say that if you brought every thought
[1:01:37] every single thought that's passed
[1:01:39] through your mind under the mind of
[1:01:41] almighty God and subject to the word of
[1:01:44] God you'll look at things differently
[1:01:47] I'd say that if you bring his sickness
[1:01:49] under the thought and Under The
[1:01:51] Obedience of God you look at sickness a
[1:01:54] little bit different you look at
[1:01:55] depression a little bit different you
[1:01:57] look at the battle that you're facing
[1:01:59] just a little bit different if you'd
[1:02:01] bring it under captivity Under The
[1:02:04] Obedience of almighty God
[1:02:07] notice now notice that the brother
[1:02:09] random when brother random preaches the
[1:02:12] greatest battle ever fought and and if
[1:02:14] you listen to it very carefully that
[1:02:17] brother random begins to speak to a
[1:02:18] little girl that is in that building and
[1:02:21] she's there and she's very sick you can
[1:02:23] go and listen to her and I believe
[1:02:24] brother Byron refers to this little girl
[1:02:26] in that meeting 11 times you can go and
[1:02:29] look it up but she's there in that
[1:02:31] meeting she's very sick and brother
[1:02:33] Brandon would tell us brother Brandon
[1:02:34] would tell us had said that if she
[1:02:36] doesn't get well that she that the
[1:02:38] doctors have gave up hope that that the
[1:02:40] sickness is going to be too bad and
[1:02:42] she's she'll be gone before long but
[1:02:44] brother random identifies or he
[1:02:46] addresses this little girl and the
[1:02:48] sickness that she has all throughout the
[1:02:51] building all throughout that sermon and
[1:02:53] he's and he's what he's doing he's
[1:02:55] trying to draw that little girl to the
[1:02:57] faith that she can accept that the
[1:03:00] battle is already over
[1:03:03] now I know that I know that all of us
[1:03:05] were very aware we're very aware that
[1:03:08] all needs are important but there's not
[1:03:11] ever been one child that I've ever
[1:03:13] prayed for that I can ever forget them
[1:03:16] because a child does something to you
[1:03:18] that that maybe somebody else doesn't do
[1:03:21] to you a child I can remember every
[1:03:23] child I pray for
[1:03:25] I can remember every need that I prayed
[1:03:27] for because they do something to your
[1:03:29] heart
[1:03:30] they do something to your heart and here
[1:03:32] here's the prophet and he's and he's
[1:03:34] driving these things now notice he said
[1:03:36] you've got to meet your enemy in the
[1:03:38] mind he said you've got to make your
[1:03:40] choice he said it meets you he said I
[1:03:42] want this little girl here that's very
[1:03:44] sick to be sure to listen now to this
[1:03:47] really closely he said decisions are
[1:03:50] made in the mind the head he said there
[1:03:52] is where Satan meets you at and the
[1:03:55] decisions are because that God made a
[1:03:58] man that way you see brother Branham was
[1:04:01] describing to her that she was going to
[1:04:03] have to make a decision that she was
[1:04:05] going to accept Christ as her healer now
[1:04:08] we recognize that the Bible has told us
[1:04:11] that for this purpose was the son of God
[1:04:14] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:04:17] devil so the very manifestation of the
[1:04:21] Son of God was to ruin the very plans of
[1:04:24] Satan
[1:04:26] foreign
[1:04:27] I know that I know that you feel like
[1:04:30] sometimes that you are going through
[1:04:32] your worst of battles and it looks like
[1:04:34] Satan's got he's got the greatest plan
[1:04:37] stacked up against your family and it
[1:04:39] looks like there's no end to the plans
[1:04:42] of Satan but I want you to know that God
[1:04:45] was manifested to ruin
[1:04:49] ruin the plans of Satan
[1:04:52] God was brought here to destroy every
[1:04:55] depression devil every anxiety devil
[1:04:58] every Cancer devil God was brought here
[1:05:01] and manifested to destroy the very
[1:05:04] workings of Satan
[1:05:08] all right
[1:05:12] now you go you go and watch that little
[1:05:14] girl throughout that service brother
[1:05:16] Brandon goes and he has a prayer line he
[1:05:18] goes he has a prayer line and he prays
[1:05:20] for her at the pulpit he goes down there
[1:05:22] and he prays over that little girl and
[1:05:25] he starts having a prayer line and
[1:05:27] brother Branham brother random comes
[1:05:29] back and he starts praying for all
[1:05:30] everybody else then all of a sudden
[1:05:32] brother by them turns to that little
[1:05:34] girl he said it's gone you're going to
[1:05:36] go home and be well and it'll be
[1:05:38] different now what did she recognize is
[1:05:42] that she accepted that the battle was
[1:05:44] the Lord's
[1:05:47] you don't understand brother random said
[1:05:49] that she was the sickest person in the
[1:05:51] building I want you to know it doesn't
[1:05:54] matter if you're the sickest case in
[1:05:56] this building it doesn't matter where
[1:05:58] you are listening on the internet if
[1:06:00] you're the sickest person
[1:06:03] it's going to be different now go and
[1:06:06] accept your healing
[1:06:11] Hallelujah
[1:06:13] Hallelujah recognize no matter what it
[1:06:16] is
[1:06:17] that sickness is a spirit
[1:06:20] you say Amen to that that sickness is a
[1:06:23] spirit that cancer is a spirit anxiety
[1:06:27] is a spirit oppression is a spirit
[1:06:30] headaches are a spirit Bruce cells Bruce
[1:06:34] sells is where Satan gets in and he
[1:06:36] attaches himself to
[1:06:38] but what is it that first it's a devil
[1:06:42] first to the devil and then he comes in
[1:06:44] and he attaches himself to a little
[1:06:46] sickness in a body and you say well my
[1:06:49] my grandpappy deal with this my grandma
[1:06:52] dealt with this and it's just passed
[1:06:54] throughout my genealogy that I'll have
[1:06:57] to deal with those things I'm sure that
[1:06:59] there are things that are laying there
[1:07:00] in your DNA that no doubt that Satan
[1:07:03] comes in and he attaches himself to but
[1:07:06] you've got to recognize that the devil
[1:07:08] is real and you've got to overcome him
[1:07:10] and William Branham had said and how can
[1:07:13] I overcome he said to overcome the devil
[1:07:15] is to recognize him in every one of his
[1:07:18] tricks and Satan will come in and trick
[1:07:22] you into talking the language of Satan
[1:07:24] saying I'll never get no better I've
[1:07:27] never overcome this battle I'm never
[1:07:29] I'll never get healthy again that's
[1:07:32] exactly the language that Satan is
[1:07:34] wanting you to talk
[1:07:35] [Music]
[1:07:38] another man I'm with brother random
[1:07:40] would take some messages in there in his
[1:07:42] early Ministry or demonology
[1:07:45] I think it's amazing that a prophet
[1:07:46] would come down and he would
[1:07:49] he would break down what these demons
[1:07:52] are and what they look like he said many
[1:07:54] times he said I'll I'll see those demons
[1:07:56] in that spirit world he said many of
[1:07:59] them will look like him he said they'll
[1:08:00] come out and he said they look like
[1:08:02] great big 50-pound spiders coming out
[1:08:04] you remember Nellie Saunders that when
[1:08:06] he cast The Devil out of her that big
[1:08:08] bat flying that big bat flew out it
[1:08:11] looked like it was a devil flying out of
[1:08:13] there it scared away and Fletcher half
[1:08:15] to death
[1:08:16] but you remember he would tell us in
[1:08:18] demonology he said now you watch your
[1:08:20] children you watch your children he said
[1:08:22] this epileptic demon he said it seems to
[1:08:25] get away from me sometimes he would
[1:08:27] stand there at the pulpit and he said
[1:08:29] I'll now take every Spirit under my
[1:08:31] control for in the name of almighty God
[1:08:34] and he said now you watch your children
[1:08:36] he said you want your children he said
[1:08:38] because it's epileptic demon can get
[1:08:40] away from me sometimes now what was it
[1:08:42] it was a slick devil now notice he said
[1:08:45] it looked and it come out in the form of
[1:08:47] a tortoise it was it was hard to move it
[1:08:51] was hard to move he said but you watched
[1:08:53] that oppression devil he said it comes
[1:08:55] out in the spirit world he said that
[1:08:57] oppression Devil is a great big cloud
[1:08:59] that hangs over people and he said when
[1:09:01] it's cast out it makes a funny sound
[1:09:05] and not exactly how oppression hits you
[1:09:08] he comes and clouds up your mind and
[1:09:12] makes you doubt what God has said he
[1:09:15] brings you depression and clouds up your
[1:09:18] mind to think that you'll never be good
[1:09:19] enough
[1:09:21] but I can prove to you by the Bible
[1:09:23] there's never been one case of
[1:09:25] Oppression there's never been one case
[1:09:27] of cancer that can stand up to the power
[1:09:30] of almighty God
[1:09:34] oh
[1:09:37] he tell us a cancer he said cancer was
[1:09:40] crab like he said it had it had legs he
[1:09:43] said he would reach out and he would
[1:09:45] grab he said but the chief of them
[1:09:47] Devils the chief of them devils
[1:09:50] was unbelief
[1:09:53] the chief of them Devils was unbelief
[1:09:57] now notice here's a prophet looking into
[1:10:00] the world the world that you face and
[1:10:02] you don't run you don't recognize that
[1:10:04] you're running into these demons all day
[1:10:06] long you're running into them and you
[1:10:08] think where in the world did that
[1:10:10] thought come from
[1:10:12] but the chief of them Devils is unbelief
[1:10:16] but we recognize that Spirits don't die
[1:10:18] you recognize that brother Brandon told
[1:10:21] us that those spirits that were up there
[1:10:23] in Legion were still here today
[1:10:26] he said those demons cried that they
[1:10:29] would take leave and go into that herd
[1:10:31] of swine over there on that hill and he
[1:10:32] said those same demons are here now you
[1:10:36] see God takes his man but he never takes
[1:10:38] his spirit and Satan comes and he comes
[1:10:41] into you he comes into a being comes
[1:10:44] into sickness and God's commission to
[1:10:47] the Church of the Living God is to cast
[1:10:49] Satan out
[1:10:51] and Satan has got to have a body to work
[1:10:54] through that's why we tell you as
[1:10:56] children to keep your children Sovereign
[1:10:58] keep them private keep them reverent
[1:11:00] sitting there because you never know the
[1:11:02] enemy might get loose in a service and
[1:11:05] you'll go after somebody that's being
[1:11:07] misreferent in the service
[1:11:11] I'm not trying to scare you but I'm
[1:11:12] trying to teach you Bible Doctrine here
[1:11:15] but notice that notice that even that
[1:11:18] Jezebel Hill it wasn't something that
[1:11:20] you just read about over in the book of
[1:11:22] Kings but it was a spirit that got on
[1:11:24] the King's wife
[1:11:26] that got on her that it was still passed
[1:11:29] down throughout all of history and it
[1:11:31] was found over in the Book of
[1:11:32] Revelations in the fire and church age
[1:11:34] that the spirit of Jezebel was working
[1:11:37] in her daughters
[1:11:39] what is it Spirits don't die
[1:11:42] they can take on any form
[1:11:46] brother random said you look at that
[1:11:47] sarcoma cancer he said he said a spirit
[1:11:50] can take on any form he said it he said
[1:11:53] that sarcoma cancer he said it Stacks
[1:11:56] itself on top of each other like a
[1:11:58] pancake and it layers itself back and
[1:12:01] forth he said that Spirit can take on
[1:12:03] any form
[1:12:04] foreign
[1:12:06] would say I was looking for this I was
[1:12:08] looking for this thought today and
[1:12:10] brother random said he said many times
[1:12:12] he said those demons will follow me back
[1:12:14] home he said they followed me back
[1:12:16] through my room and he said I felt them
[1:12:18] rubbing their flesh rubbing their bells
[1:12:21] and things and he said they'll Haunt at
[1:12:23] me half the night
[1:12:26] you think about that old scaly devil
[1:12:28] rubbing his dirty old Paws all over the
[1:12:32] prophet and the prophet recognized it
[1:12:34] that it was a blood that was protecting
[1:12:36] him
[1:12:38] are you with me you see there is a blood
[1:12:41] that is here tonight I'm just trying to
[1:12:44] make you aware that there is a spirit
[1:12:46] world but there the prophet recognized
[1:12:49] those demons was rubbing up against him
[1:12:52] taunting at him tormenting him trying to
[1:12:55] get to him make him disbelieve the word
[1:12:59] but there was a blood that stopped every
[1:13:02] devil from making its Force powerful
[1:13:05] over the man of God
[1:13:07] you think my goodness where are we
[1:13:10] living at we're living exactly in the
[1:13:12] days of Prophecy that when Daniel when
[1:13:15] Daniel would tell us over in the Book of
[1:13:16] Daniel chapter 12 that we recognize that
[1:13:19] the Book of Daniel is to the Jews as the
[1:13:21] Book of Revelation is to us as a Church
[1:13:24] of the Living God that there in Daniel
[1:13:26] chapter 12 that the Bible said that
[1:13:28] Michael shall stand up and there shall
[1:13:31] be a time of trouble like never that has
[1:13:33] seen before but you notice when you look
[1:13:36] over in Revelations chapter 10 that it
[1:13:39] is a conjunction at the beginning of it
[1:13:41] and I saw another Mighty angel coming
[1:13:44] down out of Heaven what is it is it
[1:13:47] conjunction of Revelations 9 to
[1:13:49] Revelations 10 that there was a smoke
[1:13:52] that was exuding out of that bottleless
[1:13:55] pit but in the time of trouble when
[1:13:58] there's cancer on a rampage when there
[1:14:00] when it looks like cancer is going to
[1:14:02] destroy the works of the Living God will
[1:14:05] destroy our bodies
[1:14:07] that is when the mighty Angel Christ the
[1:14:10] anointing of almighty God stands up in
[1:14:12] this generation but you look over in the
[1:14:15] Book of Daniel he said seal up those
[1:14:17] sayings but you look in this generation
[1:14:19] there's a people that is a prophesying
[1:14:22] again and they're taking the open book
[1:14:24] into the hands and they're taking thus
[1:14:26] saith the Lord
[1:14:28] let me tell you the Bride of Jesus
[1:14:30] Christ is the most powerful people
[1:14:32] there's not a demon of Oppression that's
[1:14:35] not a demon of sickness there's not a
[1:14:37] demon of you're never going to get it
[1:14:39] that can stand in the way of this open
[1:14:41] Word
[1:14:44] now Satan can come in and he can
[1:14:46] impersonate and he can attach himself to
[1:14:48] Ministries and make it look like the
[1:14:50] real thing but there is one thing that
[1:14:52] Satan cannot impersonate and it is this
[1:14:55] third poor
[1:15:01] well I'm going to scare Satan off of my
[1:15:03] motivation I'd say it ain't gonna work
[1:15:05] I'm gonna spear Satan off with my John
[1:15:09] Hagee quotes where I'm going to scare
[1:15:10] him off with my TD Jakes quotes I'm
[1:15:13] going to scare him off with my
[1:15:14] affirmations that I found on the
[1:15:16] internet it'll never work but you take
[1:15:19] this third pool Ministry and you put it
[1:15:21] in effect in your life and it'll destroy
[1:15:23] every death there ain't one devil that
[1:15:26] can stand in front of the third pole it
[1:15:28] is the opening of the word
[1:15:31] foreign
[1:15:35] notice the Bible said in Deuteronomy 7
[1:15:37] and 6 and this is going to be one of
[1:15:39] them continuation services so y'all just
[1:15:42] buckle up and help me preach but the
[1:15:43] Bible said that thou art as holy people
[1:15:46] unto the Lord by God Deuteronomy 7 and 6
[1:15:48] the Lord thy God had chosen thee to be a
[1:15:51] special people unto himself above all
[1:15:54] the people that are upon the face of the
[1:15:56] Earth so we recognize that we are
[1:15:58] prophetic class of people that have been
[1:16:01] given a prophetic insight to be able to
[1:16:03] see that the word of the Lord is open
[1:16:06] unto us
[1:16:08] another random would tell us that we
[1:16:10] have representation by predestination
[1:16:14] you ever been into a spot that only
[1:16:17] certain people could go into
[1:16:21] maybe you've been invited into the
[1:16:23] president of the office or the president
[1:16:26] of the company you've been given special
[1:16:29] operational uh privileges to be able to
[1:16:32] go into a certain room and William
[1:16:34] Branham told us that the Lord was going
[1:16:37] to meet us in this Upper Room he's going
[1:16:39] to meet us in this room here under this
[1:16:42] tent Ministry of the opening of the word
[1:16:45] they are the spirit of the Living God
[1:16:47] has given this bride special access
[1:16:51] you're wonder where the tent Ministry
[1:16:53] has had it's right here it's this 10
[1:16:56] Ministry that God is wanting to work
[1:16:58] through
[1:17:00] now you know that if there's somebody
[1:17:02] that's in that room that ain't supposed
[1:17:04] to be there the law can kick them out of
[1:17:07] that room
[1:17:09] preach with me tonight if you ain't got
[1:17:11] access if you ain't got the wedding
[1:17:13] garment on you've got no reason to be in
[1:17:16] this room but if you've got the wedding
[1:17:18] garment on which is the baptism of the
[1:17:20] Holy Ghost you've got every right out of
[1:17:22] its third pool

[1:17:26] baptized by the Holy Ghost you've got
[1:17:29] every right to be in this message of
[1:17:31] Malachi 4. you've got every right to
[1:17:34] call cancer undefeated for
[1:17:37] you've got every right don't overthrow
[1:17:40] every devil that you come up against
[1:17:42] you've got every right
[1:17:44] [Applause]
[1:17:47] Hallelujah
[1:17:48] Hallelujah I know where I am I know what
[1:17:52] I'm talking about I've got every right
[1:17:55] I'm standing in the opening of the word
[1:17:59] Satan himself can't close the book
[1:18:07] I don't need your access code God
[1:18:10] already gave it to me I don't need your
[1:18:13] badge God already gave me his badge this
[1:18:16] Badge of authority will cast Satan out
[1:18:18] of his kingdom
[1:18:29] this is the worst of Ages the darkest of
[1:18:32] Ages
[1:18:38] worst of all ages but you've been given
[1:18:40] special privileges to walk out of here
[1:18:43] and overcomer
[1:18:45] to walk out of here with a Victor's
[1:18:47] Crown on it it doesn't mean that you're
[1:18:49] not going to go through some stuff but
[1:18:51] you're going to get on a chariot and
[1:18:53] you're going to ride on this Chariot and
[1:18:56] because you've been granted access to
[1:18:58] caliber to get on the chief on the

[1:19:05] them scars out I got them fighting for
[1:19:07] you King Jesus
[1:19:10] and because you fought for me I'll let
[1:19:13] you ride with me throughout the victory
[1:19:21] you don't know where I'm living at but
[1:19:23] I'm trying to tell you that you are
[1:19:25] getting ready to ride on a chariot
[1:19:27] you don't recognize that you've been
[1:19:30] battling all hail all week long
[1:19:33] but the Holy Ghost is here to ride you
[1:19:36] straight to Victory
[1:19:42] I've been chosen to do this I've been
[1:19:45] elected to do this there ain't nobody
[1:19:47] that can kick me out of my my spot
[1:19:51] you can kick Trump out of his spot you
[1:19:54] can kick Joe Biden out of his spot but
[1:19:56] you'll never kick me out of my spot
[1:19:58] politicians will come and go but the
[1:20:00] King of Kings will live on and on and on
[1:20:03] and when there is no more politicians
[1:20:06] and when there is no more devil I will
[1:20:09] still be in Victory
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:27] foreign
[1:20:30] right here the word's been restored to
[1:20:33] you we under under we under we
[1:20:36] understand that there is a restored body
[1:20:38] that is a word born bride body that has
[1:20:42] accepted that the messenger like John
[1:20:45] stood up there when John stood up there
[1:20:47] and he said Behold the Lamb of God has
[1:20:50] come the first 400 did his job the
[1:20:54] second Forerunner done his job he's
[1:20:56] gathered the elect the elect have
[1:20:58] gathered around the word of this Howard
[1:21:01] and it has produced a word born bride
[1:21:04] that will look on and will lead us right
[1:21:07] to the coming of the Lord
[1:21:14] brother random comes and he preaches to
[1:21:16] us he takes on Easter subject after
[1:21:19] listening to brother Neville preach on
[1:21:21] Easter morning he said I went home and I
[1:21:23] wrote down a few notes
[1:21:24] and he comes back and preaches the
[1:21:27] restoration of the broad tree he comes
[1:21:29] down and breaks down all those common
[1:21:31] that I don't know if I said that right
[1:21:33] canker worm pump a worm you know what
[1:21:34] I'm saying this
[1:21:36] I'm glad y'all understand what I'm
[1:21:37] saying when I don't know what I'm saying
[1:21:40] I mean it breaks down
[1:21:47] breaks down right out of the Church of
[1:21:48] the Living God but he comes back and he
[1:21:51] preaches a restoration of the broad tree
[1:21:53] and he tells us that the fruit is at the
[1:21:55] top of the tree where does the fruit
[1:21:57] show up first at summertime where the
[1:22:00] Sun hits it first
[1:22:02] where is the evening lights shining in
[1:22:05] this day
[1:22:07] it's on this Pride body and you are
[1:22:10] producing exactly what God said to you
[1:22:12] and produce
[1:22:17] you got every right he said there's a
[1:22:20] law and you have a right to enforce the
[1:22:22] claims if the enemies come in and he
[1:22:24] stole your children you've got a right
[1:22:26] to take the token and enforce the claim
[1:22:28] if he's come in and taken your health
[1:22:30] away you've got every right to come in
[1:22:32] and enforce Acclaim so you got to fight
[1:22:35] for what you believe in
[1:22:36] they gotta fight for what you love
[1:22:39] it's like a day we're fighting like we
[1:22:41] never had before for the move of God and
[1:22:44] for the power of this message to be
[1:22:46] preached in its fullness you got to
[1:22:48] fight for it
[1:22:50] but notice the language of joab in first
[1:22:53] Chronicles 19 and 10. he said now when
[1:22:56] Joanne saw that the battle was set
[1:22:57] against him before him behind he chose
[1:22:59] out all the choice of Israel and put
[1:23:02] them in a ray against Assyrians and the
[1:23:05] rest of the people he delivered under
[1:23:06] the hand of Abisha his brother and they
[1:23:09] set themselves an array against the
[1:23:10] children of Ammon and he said if the
[1:23:14] sins be too strong for me then thou
[1:23:16] shall help me but if the children of
[1:23:18] them are be too strong for thee then I
[1:23:20] will help you be of good cheater and let
[1:23:23] us behave ourselves valiantly for our
[1:23:26] people and for the cities of our God and
[1:23:29] let the Lord do that which is good in
[1:23:31] his sights so notice that God isn't want
[1:23:34] some hot big plant that he's got to pet
[1:23:36] around he's wanting somebody that's
[1:23:38] persevered somebody that oppressed the
[1:23:40] battle like that little woman with the
[1:23:42] blood issue that had fought every battle
[1:23:44] had paid everything she gave up all that
[1:23:47] she had
[1:23:48] just to get well she had this issue in
[1:23:51] her life she was at the end of her witch
[1:23:53] but she heard about a man
[1:23:56] and she was persevering and she she went
[1:23:59] against her own thoughts
[1:24:01] she went against her own ideas she went
[1:24:04] against all the adversaries that told
[1:24:07] her that she'd never get well and she
[1:24:09] persevered through the crowd
[1:24:18] jealousy is a real devil
[1:24:21] foreign
[1:24:25] it's a spirit of jealousy that'll get on
[1:24:27] the person to make them feel like they
[1:24:30] need to get their healing first over
[1:24:31] this one but the spirit of Christ
[1:24:34] the spirit of Christ will put you in the
[1:24:36] first line
[1:24:42] with this woman
[1:24:44] through all her pain
[1:24:46] through all her agony
[1:24:48] through all our tears
[1:24:51] knowing what she's been through
[1:24:54] knowing what everybody else knows about
[1:24:57] her
[1:24:59] it don't take long
[1:25:01] it seems like good news is the hardest
[1:25:03] to spread
[1:25:04] but bad news spreads 10 times faster
[1:25:08] there's a woman with a blood issue in
[1:25:10] our midst
[1:25:12] and you know the customs of the law
[1:25:14] but this woman persevered through all
[1:25:17] the crowd
[1:25:18] and she touched him
[1:25:20] she touched him and when she touched him
[1:25:23] the Bible said that she was immediately
[1:25:25] made whole and brother made him said
[1:25:27] that that's what we need today is we
[1:25:30] need to press through every scale of
[1:25:33] unbelief and lock our swords with the
[1:25:35] devil and let him know that Jesus Christ
[1:25:38] is still the same yesterday today and
[1:25:42] forever
[1:25:45] now he said now you got to press through
[1:25:47] every scale of unbelief and that's the
[1:25:50] greatest devil that we face in this age
[1:25:52] unbelief
[1:25:56] I think it's amazing that God
[1:25:58] there's one thing that I enjoy doing I
[1:26:01] don't get to do nearing much of it as I
[1:26:02] like to do but I enjoy fishing
[1:26:06] I'm surprised some of you sisters don't
[1:26:07] do more fishing if you message Believers
[1:26:10] because brother Baron said time stopped
[1:26:12] when he was fishing
[1:26:14] you don't have to worry about that
[1:26:15] beauty cream when you're out there
[1:26:17] fishing time stand still honey
[1:26:21] maybe that's how I'll get Katie to be
[1:26:22] able to let me buy a boat
[1:26:26] just kidding but you know when I go
[1:26:29] fishing I sure enjoy fishing but I enjoy
[1:26:32] The Spoils of fish and I enjoy eating
[1:26:34] that fish
[1:26:37] I don't get a whole lot of it but there
[1:26:39] ain't nothing like that Louisiana Fried
[1:26:40] Fish them boys down there and it seems
[1:26:43] like they can cook a fried fish better
[1:26:44] than anybody ever in my life if you
[1:26:46] ain't never had fried fish go to lose
[1:26:48] him one time let them boys fly and fire
[1:26:50] fry you up some fish but I tell you when
[1:26:53] you're fishing you don't stop at the
[1:26:55] scales you go on pasture scales and you
[1:26:58] get down to the meat of it because
[1:26:59] that's what you really want to eat at
[1:27:01] but God built these fish in such a way
[1:27:04] with the scales on top of them when you
[1:27:06] take a stripe at Bass you take a
[1:27:08] striping bass it's got all those scales
[1:27:10] man they're beautiful but they're more
[1:27:12] there than just for coloring but they're
[1:27:13] built there for a protection
[1:27:16] they're built there for a protection and
[1:27:18] though each of those scales can handle
[1:27:20] they can handle so much protection that
[1:27:23] they can that is protecting them from
[1:27:25] predators it's protecting them from if
[1:27:28] they would rub against the star a sharp
[1:27:30] Rock he won't go into them it won't hurt
[1:27:32] them God has built them in such a way
[1:27:34] that each of those scales can handle the
[1:27:38] force of three Newtons falling on them
[1:27:40] that's not Fig Newtons but that's a
[1:27:42] Newton in science world that'll tell you
[1:27:44] that a newton is it's the force of an
[1:27:46] apple falling off of a tree and each of
[1:27:49] those scales have the ability to be able
[1:27:52] to handle the force of three apples
[1:27:54] falling off a tree and hitting them and
[1:27:56] still protect them
[1:27:57] God's built them in such a way
[1:28:00] but brother bandham told us that we've
[1:28:03] got to press through every scale of
[1:28:05] unbelief
[1:28:06] that Satan has has built up this
[1:28:09] unbelief so strong against the Church of
[1:28:12] the Living God but he's given a power
[1:28:15] you can look about all the hundreds of
[1:28:17] scales that are upon that stripe of mass
[1:28:20] and you can think about the ability that
[1:28:22] God has given them to be able to handle
[1:28:24] and protect themselves from the from the
[1:28:26] attack of the Predators but God has
[1:28:29] given you something to press through
[1:28:31] every scale of the devil and every
[1:28:34] unbelief tactic that he's put against
[1:28:36] the church notice notice what brother
[1:28:39] Brown told us he said he said now we're
[1:28:41] we're living way too low we're living
[1:28:43] way beyond our way below our god-given
[1:28:46] privileges
[1:28:47] he said there's no reason why we should
[1:28:50] live below our god-given privileges
[1:28:53] he said when every Redemptive promise or
[1:28:55] every redempt a blessing that Jesus
[1:28:57] Christ died for is our personal property
[1:29:00] you watch
[1:29:02] you watch the language of brother
[1:29:06] you watch the language just go look up
[1:29:07] more than a match you watch the language
[1:29:09] of it but he gets on the other side he
[1:29:12] gets on the other side of the seals and
[1:29:13] he says you're more than a match for the
[1:29:16] enemy
[1:29:18] now notice before the seals he's telling
[1:29:20] you that that cry that Satan hear
[1:29:22] nothing you're not a match for the enemy
[1:29:24] but Christ is but he gets on the other
[1:29:26] side of the seals and he tells you that
[1:29:29] you're more than a match
[1:29:30] what is it you are robed in the flesh or
[1:29:34] in the righteousness of almighty God
[1:29:37] you see that's what God's spirit
[1:29:39] principle is is to lay the word in your
[1:29:42] spirit so that you get so knitted
[1:29:44] together knitted together that if we'd
[1:29:47] come here and get so knitted together in
[1:29:49] the power of unity there wouldn't be one
[1:29:52] sick person amongst us in five minutes
[1:29:54] time
[1:29:58] you notice mother bam deals with a
[1:30:01] Nickelodeon Spirit throughout his
[1:30:03] ministry that he comes in that that
[1:30:06] Nickelodeon spirit is to overthrow
[1:30:09] it's to overthrow the laity that's what
[1:30:11] the Nickelodeon spirit is to divide and
[1:30:13] to conquer he said that Nickelodeon
[1:30:15] Spirit he said it's an overthrow or to
[1:30:17] conquer the laity what they were trying
[1:30:19] to do he said here here he was trying to
[1:30:23] take the church with that Nickelodeon
[1:30:25] Spirit was trying to take the church to
[1:30:28] do here and trying to take the church
[1:30:29] where God had Pastors in the spirit of
[1:30:31] God moving the gifts in the Church of
[1:30:34] the Living God he's he said they they
[1:30:36] were had a Doctrine and they started out
[1:30:38] they were going to have some priests and
[1:30:39] Bishops and popes and so forth that God
[1:30:42] said he hated he hates it yet today he
[1:30:45] hates that nicolaitan in spirit but
[1:30:48] notice he said all right he said it
[1:30:49] means to overthrow or to conquer or to
[1:30:53] take place of the liberty of the laity
[1:30:56] he said in other words
[1:30:58] it should take all the sacredness
[1:31:01] of the power from the church
[1:31:03] and put it over on the priest
[1:31:07] you think about that Nickelodeon spirit
[1:31:09] that still works
[1:31:12] well I don't have to pray I'll just let
[1:31:14] the priest do it I'll let the pastor do
[1:31:16] it
[1:31:17] well you watch that spirit's very real
[1:31:20] but you are to overthrow every one of
[1:31:23] these demons
[1:31:29] even when you feel at your weakest
[1:31:31] you are to overthrow
[1:31:36] what is it it's the message that woke
[1:31:38] you up to the fact that you are a
[1:31:40] daughter and a son of God what was it in
[1:31:44] Matthew chapter 25 that when there was a
[1:31:47] Midnight Cry that woke up to sleep in
[1:31:49] virgin what was it it was the voice it
[1:31:53] was the voice and brother random told us
[1:31:55] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:31:57] that God's got a threefold purpose first
[1:31:59] and second but the second one was to
[1:32:02] have the preeminence in his broad body
[1:32:04] notice he wants how he wants to live
[1:32:07] voices in this generation what was it it
[1:32:10] was the voice of Resurrection that wake
[1:32:13] you up to the fact that you are a
[1:32:16] daughter of God
[1:32:19] oh
[1:32:21] the need of this hour is oil
[1:32:26] the need of this hour is oil it's the
[1:32:28] Holy Ghost
[1:32:29] that's the need of the hour notice what
[1:32:32] Satan tried to stop it's the wine and
[1:32:35] the oil he tries to stop the stimulation
[1:32:38] he tries to stop everything the move of
[1:32:41] God and the Holy Ghost moving over the
[1:32:43] church
[1:32:46] but notice what the Book of Revelation
[1:32:48] says hurt not the wine and the oil now
[1:32:53] notice there's one thing that Satan can
[1:32:55] do he can come in and he can try to
[1:32:58] steal to kill and destroy but God is
[1:33:01] here to give you life and life more
[1:33:03] abundantly
[1:33:05] foreign
[1:33:08] some thoughts and I'm building some
[1:33:10] things but here here in this hour that
[1:33:13] God is tabernacling himself in a bright
[1:33:16] body
[1:33:17] that she's she's bone of his bone she's
[1:33:20] life of his life she's power of his
[1:33:22] power what is it she is the word kind
[1:33:26] and the word has got to produce exactly
[1:33:29] what it is
[1:33:33] so you've got to produce exactly
[1:33:36] what he is he said if I had the spirit
[1:33:39] of Dillinger in me you'd expect me to
[1:33:42] carry guns and shoot up the town he said
[1:33:44] if I had the spirit of Beethoven you
[1:33:46] would expect me to pray music and design
[1:33:48] all of these musical things he said but
[1:33:51] if I say I've got the spirit of Christ
[1:33:53] you would expect me to do the works of
[1:33:56] Christ I'm bringing this down really
[1:33:58] quick here but notice notice when he
[1:34:01] comes there that there is there is a
[1:34:03] time when he looks over in Romans
[1:34:05] chapter 9 and verse 11 that he said he
[1:34:08] so I've hated but Jacob I have loved he
[1:34:11] chose them before they was ever born
[1:34:13] upon the face of the Earth
[1:34:17] before they could ever make one action
[1:34:19] even though Jacob was going to be a
[1:34:20] shyster he was going to be a mama's boy
[1:34:22] but God had already chose Jacob because
[1:34:26] Jacob had recompense towards the
[1:34:29] birthrights
[1:34:32] he had recompensed the words of
[1:34:34] Birthright
[1:34:36] he loved the birthright he saw didn't
[1:34:39] care one thing about it
[1:34:41] but because Jacob was elected he cared
[1:34:44] for the birthright
[1:34:46] when he was a mama's boy he cared for
[1:34:48] the birthright when he was a no good
[1:34:50] shyster he cared for the birthright
[1:34:55] notice
[1:34:59] you've been elected
[1:35:02] to take the birthright you've been
[1:35:04] elected to walk in and make sure that
[1:35:06] your vessel is full of oil you've been
[1:35:09] elected to walk in and grab everything
[1:35:11] that is destined for you in this
[1:35:12] generation it ain't about what you do it
[1:35:16] this this choice is not your choice this
[1:35:19] is his choice he chose you before you
[1:35:22] could ever make your first wrong choice
[1:35:24] or make your first right choice he chose
[1:35:27] you
[1:35:28] when you looked unlovable he chose you
[1:35:34] Satan can battle you over your mind
[1:35:37] battles and all the things that Satan
[1:35:40] puts in your mind and makes you feel
[1:35:42] like you're not going to be good enough
[1:35:44] but God chose you
[1:35:49] well why don't everybody else understand
[1:35:51] it why don't everybody else grab it God
[1:35:53] chose you
[1:35:58] that little girl back here I chose her
[1:36:01] when she didn't want nothing to do with
[1:36:03] me I chose her
[1:36:05] and when we walked down through when we
[1:36:08] walked down there in Rutherford to North
[1:36:09] Carolina I was expecting her
[1:36:11] to come through them back doors
[1:36:13] I wasn't expecting nobody else to walk
[1:36:16] through them doors but her
[1:36:18] because I chose her
[1:36:20] now God ain't expecting get mad all you
[1:36:24] want to but God ain't expecting any of
[1:36:26] these any of these others to walk
[1:36:28] through the door when they haven't been
[1:36:30] put on the wedding bed
[1:36:33] but the token has been placed upon this
[1:36:36] bride she didn't do it herself you
[1:36:39] didn't make yourself a bride you didn't
[1:36:41] make yourself follow this message God
[1:36:43] put something on the inside of you and
[1:36:46] the rest of the world can't understand
[1:36:48] why you're walking this way and why
[1:36:50] you're talking this way it's something
[1:36:54] you had recompense towards the
[1:36:57] birthright
[1:36:58] and because you were Birthright you
[1:37:00] accepted it
[1:37:01] [Applause]
[1:37:06] you got a few more minutes for me notice
[1:37:09] when brother Brandon was laying there
[1:37:11] and he's facing that demon he's laying
[1:37:13] there in his bed and he and he heard he
[1:37:16] heard that little devil over in the
[1:37:17] corner just hissing at him he said he
[1:37:20] looked like alley-oop just to draw to
[1:37:21] your attention he said he looked like
[1:37:23] alley-oop he said I spoke to him and
[1:37:25] said Satan you're an offense to me get
[1:37:28] out of here in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:37:30] and he said all of a sudden he said the
[1:37:32] sweetest voice spoke to me
[1:37:35] he said never fear to go anywhere nor
[1:37:37] fail to go anywhere or anywhere anything
[1:37:40] or anywhere because a never failing
[1:37:42] presence of almighty God is with you
[1:37:44] wherever you go
[1:37:47] little Brad don't you fear to go
[1:37:49] anywhere the presence of the Living God
[1:37:52] has went before you and you are here
[1:37:56] Satan get out of here
[1:37:59] get out of my mind get out of my home
[1:38:01] get out of my family
[1:38:04] don't you fear to stand up to the devil
[1:38:06] the never failing presence of almighty
[1:38:09] God it's with you wherever you go
[1:38:12] get out of here
[1:38:14] get out of my mind get out my family get
[1:38:17] out of my home
[1:38:19] get out of my prayer life get out of my
[1:38:21] dance get out of my shout get out of my
[1:38:24] way devil you're an offense to me
[1:38:26] [Applause]
[1:38:38] brother Brandon my brother my sister
[1:38:41] going brother Brandon's hair and he has
[1:38:43] that vision of that black mama coming at
[1:38:46] him
[1:38:46] it's okay if I just keep dropping these
[1:38:49] things as they come has that black
[1:38:50] mamba's coming at him he's coming at him
[1:38:53] there was a voice that said watch out
[1:38:55] there's a great danger in this land you
[1:38:58] know what that black mama is I ain't
[1:38:59] going through the whole story he said
[1:39:01] but it's sudden death when it strikes
[1:39:03] you and he said there's great danger in
[1:39:05] the land today and he said he was going
[1:39:06] after my friend he said but God he said
[1:39:10] that voice spoke to me that voice spoke
[1:39:13] to me and said you've been given the
[1:39:14] power to bind him in the worst or any
[1:39:18] other so you've been given power to bind
[1:39:21] the strongest devil and the weakness to
[1:39:24] death and he said all of a sudden he
[1:39:26] said something seemed to have lifted me
[1:39:28] up and he said it charged me all over he
[1:39:32] said it charged me all over he said then
[1:39:34] all of a sudden he was coming at me and
[1:39:36] he said in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:39:39] bind you he said now you've been given
[1:39:42] power to bind him and to lose him that's
[1:39:44] exactly what Jesus said in Matthew
[1:39:47] chapter 16 that whatsoever you bind on
[1:39:49] Earth I'll bind in heaven and whatsoever
[1:39:52] you loose on Earth how loose in heaven
[1:39:55] we have the ability to loose the devil
[1:39:59] by sinning and you have the ability to
[1:40:02] bind the Devil by accepting what God has
[1:40:05] said about you
[1:40:08] he said well I didn't mean to do that
[1:40:10] you may elused the devil in your life
[1:40:12] but you've been given power to bind the
[1:40:14] devil it seems like hell's all against
[1:40:16] your family you've been given power to
[1:40:18] bind him he seems like hell is all
[1:40:20] against your business from thriving but
[1:40:23] you've been given power to bind the
[1:40:25] devil
[1:40:28] Jesus said the works that I do shall you
[1:40:31] do also and Greater Works than these
[1:40:33] shall you do because I go unto my father
[1:40:34] and that my father might be glorified
[1:40:37] and if you ask anything of my name I
[1:40:40] will do it
[1:40:43] Satan wants to overthrow your faith
[1:40:49] he wants to stop these little girls
[1:40:52] from getting the Holy Ghost
[1:40:54] he wants to stop every child here he
[1:40:57] wants to stop every family from becoming
[1:41:00] a message family

[1:41:24] question and answers and he's dealing
[1:41:26] with children being being routed in
[1:41:28] these things he said now notice he said
[1:41:31] I had to come to a spot in my Ministry
[1:41:33] he said Rebecca I believe it was Rebecca
[1:41:35] had got so bad as a little child he said
[1:41:38] we couldn't even eat supper the way the
[1:41:40] way that we wanted to he said Mita would
[1:41:43] take turns Eden and then I would go in
[1:41:45] and take turns and we'd go outside the
[1:41:47] restaurant and we'd go eat it's the
[1:41:49] devil trying he said it was a devil
[1:41:51] trying to get at my Ministry

[1:41:57] because you're the head of the home and
[1:41:59] you might be spiritually fortified by
[1:42:01] the word of God he'll start working on
[1:42:03] your family and he'll start working on
[1:42:05] your children and he'll start working
[1:42:06] his way in trying to stop your ministry

[1:42:29] time
[1:42:33] but brother Brandon told us in 1961 in
[1:42:36] the Easter seal
[1:42:37] he said they tried to put Christ in a
[1:42:39] tomb he said they tried to keep him in
[1:42:42] there he said but God ruined their
[1:42:44] theology he said they tried to go in
[1:42:47] there he said they're trying to put him
[1:42:48] in a Methodist tomb or a presbyterian
[1:42:51] tomb or a Nazarene tomb he said but God
[1:42:53] had ruined their theology do you
[1:42:56] recognize what Christ did on Easter
[1:42:58] morning he overthrew all of their
[1:43:00] theology now don't get mad at me I'm
[1:43:03] just telling you what a word Prophet
[1:43:05] said that he ruined their Theology and
[1:43:08] you can try to shut down the Acts 2
[1:43:10] movement but we will ruin your theology
[1:43:12] you can try to shut down this message
[1:43:15] but we will ruin your theology you can
[1:43:18] try to shut down every Power but we will
[1:43:20] ruin your theology

[1:51:37] he said he invaded us with fashion he
[1:51:40] invaded us he said he broke down
[1:51:41] politics and he said he'd come all the
[1:51:44] way in and he broke the back of mother
[1:51:48] he invaded you see you see if he can
[1:51:51] break down your home

[1:52:16] very aware that I'm dealing with
