Key of F [music] was a tiny simple stable all [music] beaten and worn hardly a place [music] for a king to be born. He didn't choose some [singing and music] place special to reveal his majesty.

[singing] Oh, live inside this house [music] of clay and mold [singing] it every day. Oh, let [music] your word be born in the manger of [music] my heart.

But Lord, she saw fit, Lord Jesus, to lay everything aside and break that little alabaster box and to pour out her praise upon you, Father. Today, that's what we want to do is to come to a place, Lord Jesus, where you would be honored with our praise. Lord Jesus, WHERE YOU WOULD LOOK out and say, "Her sins are great, but they're all forgiven. FATHER, WE LOVE YOU so much. Your name is higher than our sin. Your name is greater than every president, every pope, AND EVERY PRIME MINISTER. YOUR NAME IS THE NAME, oh God, that we will worship forever and ever. And we love you, Lord Jesus.

Lord, may your word go down into our alleyways, Lord, in the places that need to be mended, Lord. And the places that need to be fixed. May your word come and bring about a mighty deliverance and a blessing, Lord. [music] May we truly be more like you, Father, when we leave than when we came in. Lord, the prophet tells us, Lord, that when we come to the house of God, we either leave better or worse than when [music] we came in. Lord, there's no middle ground. We It's impossible to leave the same [music] because your word will have an effect. And Lord, as the word goes out like a seed, Lord, may you just give us a heart to receive. May even as we worship you, Lord, may you help us to till the ground of our heart, Lord, and to break up the things of the past week and and any [music] complexes that we may have, may we break it all up that your Holy Spirit by the power of the spoken word can come into good ground [music] because, Father, we don't want to be forgetful hearers, Lord.

Oh, when the saints [music] marching in the s [music] for a while. always I have to say it's it's such a joy to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's uh I'm not pinning any on me. I wasn't going to say anything. I'm not pinning anything when I say this. in a four hours sometimes you get challenged and you're like really and I'm like then I can't imagine not being here. It's God's house. There's nothing like where you know I get my little room upstairs and try to learn a song and he comes in there occasionally uh all the time when I invite him. I learned that but it's nothing like this. It's nothing like this. Forgive me these things. I have a source [music] of strength. [music] I have a source of strength when I am weak. It [music] leads me through when life is claiming [music] me. Oh, I have a source of power [music] from above. I'm covered over [singing] by a shield of love [music and singing] and I claim the blood. Lord, you shed on [music] [singing] Calvary. Those precious [music] blood stains, they were made there just for me. [music] For all my sins, all my sickness and my [music] pain. When I need healing, Lord, I claim those [music] precious blood stains I do not know. Oh, how others make it through [singing] never go to Calvary [music] as I do. For there's a healing and [music] a cleansing that stream still flows. And only [singing] Lord your redeemed [music] can know. And I claim the blood. Lord, you [music] shed on Calvary. Those precious [music] blood stains, they were [singing] made there just for me. Were all my sins, all [music] my sickness, and my pain. When I need healing, Lord, I claim those precious [music] blood stains. I do not know Lord how others they could make it through [music] that never [singing] go to Calvary as I do for there's a healing and a cleansing that stream still flows [music] with peace that be his redeemed [music] candle, Lord. And I claim that blood, Lord, you shed on Calvary. [music] Those precious blood [singing] stains, they [music] were made there just for me. for [singing] all my sins, all my [music] sickness and my pain. When I need healing, [music] Lord, I cling those precious blood stains [music] for all my sins, all my sickness, all my pain. Lord, when I need healing, [singing and music] I claim those precious blood. [applause] It's a [music] blessing when I see the dark clouds parting. [music] When the rain is gone and [singing] sun is breaking through. [music] I anticipate when [music] life will just be normal. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; just to close my weery eyes [singing] and rest in you. [music] My heart can rest so easy when there's blue skies. [music and singing] When the wind is gone [music] and rain [singing] is not in sight. How [music and singing] I long to hang my sword above the mantle, [music] away from [singing] harm and distant from the fight. But I wouldn't [music and singing] know your peace without the hard times [music] or [singing] be thankful for relief without the pain. I wouldn't love [music] the [singing] light if it were not for darkness [music] or appreciate the sun without the rain. How [music] could I [singing] understand forgiveness without failure? Or feel the [music and singing] warmth of love without the bitter cold? [music] How could I hold your [singing] healing hands without affliction [music] and be blessed to see your [music] mercies all unfold? Sure, [music] it's a blessing to be safe, secure, and warm. But Lord, [singing] I want to [music] thank you for the storm. Imagine [music] [singing] as Peter sat in prison, he may have paced [singing] the floors with chains around his feet. And [music] in his mind, the devil taunted [singing] as he whispers, "The battle's [music] lost, and this is your defeat." [music] But then his mind went back to that night in the tempest. When the master [music and singing] spoke and winds and seas obey and he remembered [music] that storm calming all around him. [music] He could rest in that dark [singing] prison unafraid and say peace without the hard times or be [singing] thankful for [music] relief without the pain. I [music] wouldn't love the [singing] light if it were not for darkness or appreciate the [singing] sun without the rain. How could I understand forgiveness [music] without failure? [singing] Or feel the [music] warmth of love without the bitter cold? How could I hold your healing hands without affliction [music] and be blessed to see [singing] your mercies all unfold? Sure, [music] it's a blessing to be safe, secure, [singing] and warm. [music] Oh, but Lord, I want to thank you for the storm. [music] If my [singing] life were free of trials, Lord, I lose my view [music] of you. Their sweet trophies [singing] that remind me [music] of all you do. Sure, it's a blessing to be safe, [music] secure, and warm. Oh, but Lord, I want [singing] to thank [music] you for the storm. I'm still [music] safe, secure, and warm. Oh, but Lord, [singing] I want to thank you for the storm. [music] Let's stand this morning. what it's like to be in the presence [music] of the Lord and not [music and singing] know what time it is. Cuz time [music] stood still and [music] bodies [singing] were healed and families [music and singing] restored because [music] we stayed [singing] be in [music] the presence of the Lord. No one had to say [music] a word. Couldn't even make [music] a sound. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But I'd give up [singing] everything for [music] this treasure I found. I never wanted to. [music] So I say stay. I [music] don't want you to go [singing] [music] cuz my heart is burning [music] in your [singing] presence, Lord. [singing and music] Oh, please [music] stay. I don't [music] want you to go [music] cuz my heart is [singing] burning [music] [singing] in your presence, Lord. [music] [singing] And I want more. [music] [music] Oh, I want more.

And you love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's certainly good to us, isn't he? I'm certainly thankful to have a good day. Yesterday was a really rough day. I'm thankful to have a good day today. And so, Amen. I count these good days as good days. And so, Amen. If you'll turn with me to Psalms chapter 91 and verse one, and then we'll go to Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10. You guys that's been here a while, you realize that's one of my favorite scriptures that we're getting ready to read because it's a covenant with God. [clears throat] He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress, my God. In him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the the snare of the fowler and the from the noisome pestilence, and he shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust. His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid, for the terror by night, and the arrow that flyth by day, nor the pestilence that walketh in the darkness, nor the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall foul at thy side, and 10,000 at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation. Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, and put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and against powers, and against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against the spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand. Stand therefore having your loins gird about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness. May God bless the reading of his word. You can be seated today. Brother Brandman said, "All powers in heaven and earth is given into my hand. Go and I'll go with you. Whatsoever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven." That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you loose on earth, I'll loose in heaven. Oh, if the great holy church only realized its power to do these things. It's not just words. &gt;&gt; It's not just words. It's action. &gt;&gt; Brother Brams, let me just share this quote with you. You're here for a purpose. You're here to destroy the works of the devil. Because you have a part of that to do. Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil. Then your purpose as his offsprings, his sons and daughters, must have the same ambition. I'm going to destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; Let's quote that together. I'm going to destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God instructed brother Brandham and and as is one of the most powerful quotes that he gives talking about that we're an invincible army. And brother Brandham talks about this bride of Jesus Christ that she's an invincible army. Then another place he says she knows what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is our day. That's right. &gt;&gt; We didn't come in Luther's day or in Wesley's day or or another day. &gt;&gt; This is your day. &gt;&gt; You showed up at the right time. &gt;&gt; You're anointed to overcome this day. &gt;&gt; Ephesians or Revelations chapter 3 says to us that to him that overcomemeth, &gt;&gt; I'm not here to survive. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to get by. &gt;&gt; I'm not here just to be a church member. &gt;&gt; I want to be identified as an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Overcoming means that you're going to wrestle. You're going to have to fight. &gt;&gt; But there's no quit in the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's nowhere that we surrender and get off and take the exit ramp. We're going to overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is our moment. &gt;&gt; This is our moment. &gt;&gt; We read of Noah and Abraham and Moses and we read of all the ladies of the Bible and they lived in their day. They overcame in their day. They had struggles in their day. But this is your day. &gt;&gt; You can mark it on your your refrigerator. This is my day. That's right. &gt;&gt; I was sick here. I was born. I was pre-planned to live in this day. And here I am. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody else is going to do it for you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, I just bring it to this just to get a thought so you'll know where I'm at. We're coming toward the end of December. At the end of December, we have ate like hogs. We have bellied up to table after table and we've ate ham, chicken, turkey, oysters, mashed potatoes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going to get you ready to eat here. Sweet potatoes with all the fixings on them, rolls that big, and your pants don't fit no more. your dress is just a little bit tighter than it was uh six weeks ago. And you begin to make a promise. Come January, I'm going on a diet. I'm going to exercise. I'm going to make a commitment. I'm going to dedicate myself. Two weeks into January, gone. &gt;&gt; How you know that, Brother Ron? Well, you see all these exercise places that and the month that their membership goes up is January. &gt;&gt; The month that their membership goes down is &gt;&gt; January. If you're going to be committed, you got to be committed. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm with you. I'm with you. Now, I want you to understand if this is our day and this is our moment and we're in the vision. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; AND NOBODY ELSE CAN DO IT FOR US. &gt;&gt; This is a personal rapture universal around the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to overcome for us. &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to step in. We'll pray for each other. We are a team. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to set at the marriage supper a table that's unbelievably long. &gt;&gt; I have a chair. &gt;&gt; I have a chair. &gt;&gt; I have a name plate on my chair. That's where I'm GOING TO SIT. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY PLACE. &gt;&gt; I can't take your place. &gt;&gt; We hear the prophets say, "Billy Graham can't TAKE YOUR PLACE. I can't take your place. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Nobody can take your place. &gt;&gt; God didn't leave you alone to do that, but he armed you for battle in this day. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; This the the scripture says Jesus and Jesus answering and said unto them, this is real simple. Have faith in God as believers. That's where we start. Mark 11 and verse 22. For verily I say unto you, that whatsoever whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in HIS HEART, BUT SHALL BELIEVE THAT THOSE things which he saith shall come to pass. He shall have whatsoever he saith. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Speak it, believe it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Therefore, I say unto you that whatsoever you desire when you pray, believe that ye receive them, &gt;&gt; and you shall have them. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, LORD. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU STAND PRAYING, FORGIVE. &gt;&gt; And if you have ought against any, that your father also, that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. &gt;&gt; They did me wrong, brother Ron. Forgive them. &gt;&gt; Forgive them and move on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't carry the burden. How How hard is that to do, FATHER? HELP ME TO FORGIVE THEM &gt;&gt; that have reviled AGAINST ME. HELP ME TO FORGIVE them that have TALKED AGAINST ME. HELP ME TO FORGIVE THEM AND I LAY IT AT YOUR FEET. &gt;&gt; Don't pick it up and carry it anymore. Are you with me now? You're not strong enough to carry all those burdens. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you forgive not, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses. &gt;&gt; Simply put, this ain't great deep thought here. If you don't forgive others, &gt;&gt; God won't forgive you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And whether you're looking in the mirror or not, you are not perfect. &gt;&gt; So, we need Are you with me? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; nothing. He said, notice it is something that you possess. Faith is it is something that you possess. Faith is not imagination. &gt;&gt; If you really have it, it's as real as any other thing could be. You ever heard about those guys that uh went to sell the king special robes? And they were con artist. They came to the king and they be to talk to him. The kind of clothes that we make, you've got to be such a have a special insight and you got to have a you've got to have a revelation of how great these clothes are. And so, you know, they begin to pull them out and show them to the king. Well, they were invisible. And the king didn't want to feel like he was ignorant or to feel like that uh, you know, he didn't have special insight. So, he began to try him on. [laughter] And so, THESE GUYS SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? If you really want to see how great your kingdom is, tell them that they've got special insight. And if they and they've got a great revelation of how great you are as a king, &gt;&gt; you ought to have a parade and wear your special clothes. Well, you know, everybody was ooing and aing after speech and and he's going down through there and everybody was, you know, talking about how great it was. little girl standing about this tall and she said, "Mommy, why is the king in his underwear?" YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES RELIGION, YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT. &gt;&gt; THIS ain't real, &gt;&gt; but this is. &gt;&gt; Don't give ME A BUNCH OF JUNK. I WANT THAT WHICH WILL CLOTHE ME, [applause] &gt;&gt; that will live on Monday morning like it lives on Sunday. &gt;&gt; And when I speak it, it will believe it and it's real. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says talks about contest. He said a contest is a test of strength. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have a enemy that is a is quite an enemy that's not like a paper tiger but he roars as a lion. Fear is real. It's mentioned 600 times in the Bible. He comes to to kill, to steal, and destroy. And if he does all that, there's no need in negotiating with him. &gt;&gt; He's not the kind of an enemy that you negotiate with and and go to Geneva, Switzerland, and and and sign some papers for him to back off. &gt;&gt; It's kind of like Russia. Yesterday they were they were talking peace and last night they had the worst attack that you could have. &gt;&gt; That's kind of like the enemy. If you rub the cat the right way, it'll be settled for a little while. But remember that boole booger will bite you &gt;&gt; and it'll scratch you. [applause] &gt;&gt; And the enemy wants TO KILL TO STEAL and destroy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN, YOUR FAMILY IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to when YOU LOOK OVER AT YOUR CHILDREN, THEY'RE WORTH FIGHTING FOR. &gt;&gt; YOUR WIFE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. &gt;&gt; Your husband as well, sisters, you can go ahead and say amen right there. &gt;&gt; I I found it interesting yesterday and and brother Andrew's sermon, which was incredible. Brother Brandon will come and and he says I he comes to the pullpit five different times and he says I want to give God a fair trial. Five different times, brother Brandham preaches a trial. And so he starts out in Mark chapter 16, the sign shall follow them that believe. and he wants to give God a trial, a fair trial that he's proving his word. God is is not like a a fickle man. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; God will always back his word. &gt;&gt; If he says anything, he'll back it up. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAYS A COUPLE DIFFERENT things and I'll just bring it to you. the doubt of this age. They don't believe he's real. &gt;&gt; Listen, there's a lot of belief in the world that Jesus never came. &gt;&gt; Think about that. They don't really realize that he's real. They they don't even want to want to believe is real or they want a Jesus of their own imagination. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? WHAT PART OF THE SCRIPTURES are inspired? Come on. &gt;&gt; What part is man? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, we know a lot of people doubt Brother Brandham and they want to contest Brother Brandham and all different kinds of things, but you know, they waited 50 years to contest him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Listen, whether you want to realize, his body's probably already back to dust now. &gt;&gt; But the message went forth &gt;&gt; and it did what it said it would do. It gathered a bride all over the world in every nation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Well, let me let me just stop here just for a moment. Uh uh those that want to contest, Brother Brandham, did a light show up at your birth? &gt;&gt; Did a dove fly in the window at your birth? Come on. &gt;&gt; Is does your name have seven letters all through it? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Let me go to another one. Is there seven mountains &gt;&gt; that spell out your name? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Can you stand backwards on a pull pit and call people out over and over again and maybe tell ONE PERSON 22 DIFFERENT THINGS? &gt;&gt; And be totally accurate. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE DISCREDITING a prophet, remember you're pointing a finger, but there's four pointing back to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you're putting him under a microscope, are you with me now? &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE SAME MICROSCOPE WILL COME BACK ON YOU. SO, so let's just let's just go. &gt;&gt; So, WE'LL GIVE MR. UNBELIEVER. HOW MANY ever has to fight with him? &gt;&gt; We'll give Mr. Skeptic. He's going to come. And Mr. Impatient. All of us has had to fight these boogers. &gt;&gt; I don't know if in the Webster or not. might mean something different than the word will always stand the test. &gt;&gt; The word will always stand to test. Your feelings won't. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Your Timex watch won't. &gt;&gt; When God MAKES A PROMISE, HE'S NOT necessarily saying when. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not saying when. When you pray, IT MAY TAKE 25 years for it to come to pass. &gt;&gt; But you just got to believe it to. &gt;&gt; And you got to watch IT TAKE PLACE CUZ YOU CAN'T PRODUCE IT IN THE first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes we get impatient. &gt;&gt; We get impatient. So, here comes Mr. Barhop into the church. He's got all the world hanging on him. Or Mrs. Prissy Pants &gt;&gt; and she's got all the world hanging on her AND WE GET IMPATIENT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; You know, we get impatient for her to look like Christ or him to act LIKE CHRIST. BUT YOU JUST LET THE WORD do the test. &gt;&gt; You just let it wash and wash &gt;&gt; and wash. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; One of the last conversations that my mother and I had, literally the second to the last conversation that we had, they had had a a Mr. Legalist preach for them. Boy, it upset her because that Mr. Legalist was talking about her her grandsons. And you know, her grandsons wasn't saved. They were born raised in church. And Mr. Legalist was just burning hides. My mom's temperature was going woo. [snorts] And so it was my job now to talk to my mom. [laughter] Are you with me? You feel me now? You feel me now, don't you? I got a probably wouldn't be a proper word to say hot mom, [laughter] but brother Ray, her temperature was balling, baby. She was upset. And so I told her, I I I just said I literally said, "God, help me." I wanted to put it in a way that she would understand it. And she was going on, man. She if she could have had the spoken word, that guy would have been toast. Hey, listen. She She'd listened to sermons since she was a kid. And now listen, this one's upsetting her. It would be the last sermon my mom listened to. Think about that. I've I've really gave that a lot of thought. cuz she would have a heart attack on Friday and that was a Wednesday night. And I said, "Mom," I said, "What some people don't realize is the principle of fishing." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You can't clean a fish &gt;&gt; until you catch it. Did you get it? Tell your neighbor you can't clean a fish. &gt;&gt; How many fish stories have we heard? He that big. &gt;&gt; Woo. He was big. How many deer stories? It's deer season now. How many deer stories that we hear there's called ground shrinkage? [laughter] He was like that. He had horns that tall, BUT WHEN I WALKED UP TO HIM, he was &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You had him hanging on the wall, maybe turned right or left, and then you walked up to him and said, "Well, I believe I'll give a skull mount. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It's not invisible. It's not manufactured. It's not based on your feelings. But the word of God is infallible. &gt;&gt; And it washes us over time. God don't send you through a pipe. &gt;&gt; Right. He doesn't mechanize and sending you through a pipe and then you're an overcomer. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T FORCE NOTHING on you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you want your kids to be perfect. It's in my notes. YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO be perfect. &gt;&gt; WELL, SWEETHEART, YOU WASN'T PERFECT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You wasn't perfect. Are you with me now? So, THEY'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THE SAME process that you went through. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? They got to grow. &gt;&gt; They think like a 10 a 10 year old. &gt;&gt; And you're lucky enough to live to 40. And listen, there you are. YOU'RE YOU'RE JUDGING THEM. Brother Ron, I don't know if I'll ever grasp everything about the message. &gt;&gt; You know, that's not what it's about. &gt;&gt; It's about do you believe &gt;&gt; it's not whether you understand it or not and be able to be able to to talk about the seals and the trumpets and the thunders and &gt;&gt; are you with me? Are you with me? And to be able to talk about all you have to do is believe. &gt;&gt; It's good to have the knowledge of all those things, but do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Oh, brother Ron, I know everything about it. Okay. Write a book on [snorts] understanding women. believe I'll open my drink on that one. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say anymore. I want to give you a couple examples here. Noah was a farmer, &gt;&gt; not an engineer. Right? &gt;&gt; He definitely was not a boat builder, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He was a farmer. &gt;&gt; But God positioned him on the earth at the right time &gt;&gt; at the right place &gt;&gt; and gave him a revelation that I'M GOING TO DESTROY THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; I'm going to destroy the earth and I'm going to do it with water. &gt;&gt; It's going to rain, &gt;&gt; right? I'm going to flood the earth and EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT in the ark is going to perish. &gt;&gt; God didn't give that to a half a million people. &gt;&gt; One man &gt;&gt; and he be to preach that AND HE PREACHED IT WITH ALL OF HIS HEART CUZ REMEMBER HE REALIZES THAT IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE ARK YOU DIE. THAT'S WHY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS SO IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; IT IS SO IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF THE MESSAGE, THERE'S no rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; There is redemption, BUT THERE'S NO RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; There's no escaping the things that are coming on the earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The tribulation is coming on the earth. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, I can make it through the tribulation. Brother Brandham explains a tribulation period alongside the Holocaust, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he said, "The Holocaust will be like a Sunday afternoon picnic." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Folks, let me just say this to you. This world's not worth staying here for. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Be sincere. Be dedicated. be committed. [snorts] &gt;&gt; They begin to ask Noah questions. Where's the rain coming from? Where's it coming from? It's never rained. &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU A PROPHET? Are you the only holy man on the earth? Are you the only man that can speak to God? But Noah knew. &gt;&gt; Noah knew. &gt;&gt; You can hear the passion in brother Brandham's voice in a particular one sermon. Souls now in prison. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can hear that after this service is coming to an end. He thought that was going to be the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. another sermon called sers, what is the time? &gt;&gt; And he's asking the people, where are we at? &gt;&gt; What junction are we in? &gt;&gt; You can hear the prophet's voice. &gt;&gt; Noah be to build an ark in the ark. begin to build the ark to where that it's going to take more than a couple days. Here's where time comes in. Here's where Mr. impatient and Mr. Skeptic and Mr. Unbeliever will begin to fight Noah. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And in the fighting of Noah, you know, it ain't rained all this time. You've been preaching this message 120 years, right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's been dead almost 60. Whenever a skeptic tells you that, ask him about the vision in 1933 and cars going down the road without a driver. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He never thought, hey, listen, listen. I I I knew what brother Ram said, but now to watch a car come down the road with no driver, &gt;&gt; we saw one the other day and woo, I don't know if I want to ride in it. &gt;&gt; But we're here. &gt;&gt; We're here. &gt;&gt; We have arrived. Friend of mine told me told me the other day was in a certain city. Called for an Uber driver and the Uber car showed up. No driver. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're here. &gt;&gt; You don't have to argue about the vision. It's happened. &gt;&gt; We have a United States Pope. &gt;&gt; He's uniting the world together. &gt;&gt; He's doing THINGS THAT NO OTHER POPE HAS DONE. &gt;&gt; SO, let's just come back just for A MOMENT. IF HE'S TAKING HIS PLACE, &gt;&gt; I MUST TAKE MY PLACE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO TAKE MY PLACE. &gt;&gt; NOW, Romans chapter 8 and VERSE 31, WHAT SHALL WE THEN SAY TO THESE THINGS? IF GOD BE FOR US, &gt;&gt; let's stand STRONG NOW. IF GOD BE FOR US, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, in the message we we say, Brother Brandham, but God's speaking through the voice. &gt;&gt; HE CALLS US THE FINAL VOICE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; To the final age. &gt;&gt; SAME VOICE CALLS US AN invincible army. Then I want to ask you now, who gathered us together? &gt;&gt; Who then gathered us together? One of our favorite preachers is brother Tim Puit &gt;&gt; from H Louisiana. The fellow that preached for us last week and did a phenomenal job, Brother Kelly from Saskatoon, Canada. &gt;&gt; Amen. which some of you would have to go and look on the look on the maps to find that spot. &gt;&gt; Without this message, &gt;&gt; we would have never met. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE saying five hours, four hours, two hours. Who gathered us? &gt;&gt; Who did this? We didn't we DIDN'T GO TO SOME APP SOMEWHERE or another and say we want a certain group of people and &gt;&gt; GOD [screaming] BROUGHT US TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; GOD DID THIS. [applause] Are you with me? How important is our time? Well, let me just say this to you. We are only mortal once. &gt;&gt; Whether you live to be 90 years old, 20 years old, or 10 years old, it's time. It evaporates. It's like the vapor over top of the off over top of a teapot. It's there just for a few moments and it's gone. Are you with me? Important people that have done important things, they'll be known maybe for hundreds of years. But when we're talking about eternity, &gt;&gt; when we sat down, as the prophet told us said, we'll sit down in that rose garden 500 years. &gt;&gt; Now, for our minds to comprehend that, we sat down in a rose garden 500 years. That's Christopher Columbus stuff. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR 500 YEARS. Eternity is beyond our fathoming of our thoughts. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on now. When we come to our our life cycle and to overcome failure is not an option. &gt;&gt; It's not an option. Quitting is not an option. &gt;&gt; Have a seat of God inside of you. You can't quit. You can't give up. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The prophet called this a golden age. Yet, it's an age unfit to live in. &gt;&gt; If you looked at the news this morning, it will depress you. Right. &gt;&gt; But at the same time, you were getting ready for church and you were so excited. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS GOD GOING TO SPEAK TO US TODAY? &gt;&gt; SO, it's such AN AGE THAT IT'S UNFIT TO LIVE IN. YET, GOD BUILT YOU &gt;&gt; to live in two worlds at the same time. &gt;&gt; You live in a heavenly realm and a Sodom Gomorrah realm. And really, whoever's suppressing it don't affect you no way. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE GET THEIR SELF SO upset and so POLITICALLY TORE ALL TO PIECES OVER WHO'S the president. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you when it affects you. when they raise your taxes. [snorts] And I'll tell you another time it'll affect you. When they send you money, &gt;&gt; we've overpaid you. &gt;&gt; It's a human government. &gt;&gt; They don't have the answers, &gt;&gt; but right here does. [applause] Well, brother Ron, I trust in my job. Your job might go away overnight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people trust in their houses and their houses are everything and a tornado in three seconds. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yesterday, Sister Connie was baking whatever cookies, asparagus. That stuff's worth being burned up. Every brother in this building ought TO BE SAYING, "AMEN, BROTHER ROY." And all of a sudden, our stove was on fire. I'm talking about flames, baby. I go in and grab mitts and we get it out. I see the asparagus. Life can change in a few seconds. &gt;&gt; A heart attack can change. &gt;&gt; A stroke can change you. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE STRONG AND HEALTHY AT THIS VERY MOMENT, but that heart is only JUST BEATING ONE TICK at a time. HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO ETERNITY? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm strong. Brother Ron, let let A BLOOD CLOT GO THROUGH YOUR HEART and go to your brain. &gt;&gt; Left side, right side, mechanical functions all of a sudden's gone. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sister Terry, your mom was in the in the rehab center for nine years, I believe. I may be. I believe it was about nine years. Listen, she was standing here. Brother Billy Andrews is preaching. Brother Roger, Brother Rogers being prayed for. Sister Sister Hoover is being prayed for. Listen, Brother Roger had a heart attack that night. Sister Hoover would have a stroke in a few days. She laid in a in a home for eight, nine years, having to be taken care of. So, while you're healthy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Come on. LET ME STRESS THIS POINT. WHILE YOU'RE FUNCTIONABLE, &gt;&gt; do something. &gt;&gt; SERVE THE PURPOSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S IMPORTANT? ETERNAL LIFE is important. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I said this several years ago and it means more to me than today. Even today, courage is not having the strength to go on. It is going on when you don't have the strength. &gt;&gt; The scripture is very important to us. Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals into fire and bringeth forth an instrument for his work. I have created the waster to destroy. And then the next scripture says, no weapon &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee shall prosper, &gt;&gt; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in the JUDGMENT THOU SHALT CONDEMN. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Just give you a few notes here. God's words are eternal. &gt;&gt; Men's words are temporary. &gt;&gt; Say it with me. God's words is eternal. Men's words are temporary. &gt;&gt; His thoughts to give us weapons for our war warfare IS ETERNAL. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? WHEN GOD GAVE US THE THE the weapons that we needed to fight, whether it was in Noah's day or Abraham's day, brother Brandham's day, in our day, it's the same. It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere, &gt;&gt; any place, and at any time. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of GOD WILL DEFEAT SATAN ANYWHERE, &gt;&gt; any place, &gt;&gt; at any time. &gt;&gt; We are commissioned. &gt;&gt; We are commissioned as ambassadors on the earth &gt;&gt; to defeat the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your authority is in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no authority any greater. There is no there is no name that's any greater. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you shall bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. Whatsoever you shall loose on earth, I'll loose it in heaven. Brother Ron, I just feel so weak. The prophet says, "When the weakest of Christians go on their knees, the kingdom of hell shake." That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Let me give you some recommendations. Stop complaining. &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and say, "Stop complaining." &gt;&gt; If you just told your wife that, have prayer. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Have enough sense to know when to say that. &gt;&gt; Refuse to give the enemy voice. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Refuse to give the enemy voice. &gt;&gt; Refuse. He tells you God don't love you, then don't repeat it. &gt;&gt; He tells you nobody loves you in church, don't repeat it. &gt;&gt; Don't give him voice &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S LYING TO start off with &gt;&gt; and you being a child of God, then you repeat a lie. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You're giving the devil credit. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? THINK VICTORY. &gt;&gt; WALK VICTORY. &gt;&gt; TALK [screaming] VICTORY. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Never give up. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you don't know what I'm going through. Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I don't need to get started there. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you a news bulletin for you. God answers prayer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, God answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now, Brother Ron? I'm just so blue and so so defeated all the time. I I I fight Maybe this is for somebody poor soul out on the internet. I just fight depression all the time. Well, I Here's what I want you to do. A little homework for you. go back and remember the things that you talk about. &gt;&gt; And if you're constantly given a negative confession, &gt;&gt; if you're constantly given a negative confession, that's building the atmosphere that you live in. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR CONFESSION IS WHAT BRINGS FAITH. Speak things as though they are not and then walk into them. &gt;&gt; YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT SUCCESSFUL. START SPEAKING IT. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? YOU HATE YOUR JOB? START TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU'RE THANKFUL THAT GOD GAVE YOU A job that you can still work. [applause] &gt;&gt; GOD PUT BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS. HE GAVE ENERGY to your muscles THAT YOU CAN STILL GO ON. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; How big is our God? We talked about this a couple months ago. How big is our God? &gt;&gt; How really big is our God? How big? He created the universe. As a matter of fact, science has not even discovered everything that's out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God simply said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; I don't know how anybody can believe that there's not a God. &gt;&gt; When all you've got to do is look up. &gt;&gt; And the first Bible's in the heavens. &gt;&gt; You can't get away from this Bible cuz it's in the heavens, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then it's in a pyramid. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now it's in your hands. &gt;&gt; Heard Andrew quoting last night and then brother brother Gabe put it on his on his morning devotion about restoration. Will God forgive me of my sins? Will he restore me? This this this is in front of me now. No sin is too deep. No heart is too far away. &gt;&gt; God's love reaches further &gt;&gt; than we can ever &gt;&gt; imagine. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Gabriel named his little boy Uriah. Brother Random said that's the first man that he would like to shake hands with when he got to heaven. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yet Uriah was murdered by David. &gt;&gt; He was murdered because David committed a sin. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The same man that wrote Psalms. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The same man that was a phenomenal fighter for God. &gt;&gt; Brother B said, "I I want to I want to shake Uriah's hand when I get there." Not David's hand. Not Solomon's hands, Uriah's hands. You named You named your boy Uriah based on that. Think about that. Uriah was not a Jewish person. &gt;&gt; He was a Gentile. &gt;&gt; No sin is too deep, &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But I don't have a chance. You're still breathing. You're still breathing. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brother Ron? But but I'm too far away. Huh? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; God knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; God's bigger than your fears. &gt;&gt; He's greater THAN ALL YOUR STRUGGLES. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE'S STRONGER THAN EVERY ENEMY &gt;&gt; THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT. &gt;&gt; So confess &gt;&gt; if all of THAT BE TRUE, CONFESS VICTORY. &gt;&gt; WALK VICTORY. THINK VICTORY. &gt;&gt; Brother Rhonda, where you getting this? Third pull. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Third pull. This is part of it. It comes out of perfect faith. BE DETERMINED. DON'T BE DEFEATED BECAUSE YOU CAN'T be defeated. You're children of God. GOD PROMISED THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT is given to every believer. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? [clears throat] I want to give you one quote that's really powerful. &gt;&gt; The devil has no answer for the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Say it to your neighbor. The devil has no answer for the blood of Jesus Christ. So every accusation that would come against you, every fall into a pit that would come against you, &gt;&gt; the devil does not have an answer for the blood. &gt;&gt; Because when your sins hit the blood, the blood annihilates them. &gt;&gt; I love what you said last night. as if &gt;&gt; it takes you back to the condition, the condition of innocence. &gt;&gt; We can go ahead and stop and preach and just dance for a while right there. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Well, brother Ron, let let's just talk about your armor just for just a few minutes. Let's just talk about even your identification right now. You are justified. &gt;&gt; You can shout. It's as though you never did it &gt;&gt; in the first place. &gt;&gt; Let it go. &gt;&gt; Stop digging up bones. &gt;&gt; Let it [screaming] go. Let it go. &gt;&gt; And listen, IF YOU'RE JUSTIFIED, LET ME JUST SAY, LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBORS AS they're justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. Quit picking up rocks. &gt;&gt; QUIT PICKING UP ROCKS. GOD FORGAVE YOU OF YOUR SINS. HE FORGAVE THEM OF THEIR SINS. [applause] &gt;&gt; It comes TO THE NEXT POINT. YOU ARE FORGIVEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. What can wash away my sins? &gt;&gt; NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS. WHAT CAN make me whole again? Many of our homes have a protection system over it. That's as good as long as the electricity works. Are you with me? Or the battery works. But you're covered by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And it's eternal. &gt;&gt; You're accepted. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I just want to feel accepted. You already are. &gt;&gt; Many times you beg for things and you already got it. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I would like to be rich. Well, you already are. &gt;&gt; It's not the money that's in your billfold, right? &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, my wife's got my bill fold. Where you going with that, baby? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Boy, that was good timing, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; I had a bad day yesterday. I may have a bad evening. God has declared you righteous. &gt;&gt; God, not a fickle man. God has declared you righteous. HOW, BROTHER RON? HE gave you his. &gt;&gt; Taking the scriptures, YOU ARE BEYOND CONDEMNATION. &gt;&gt; Romans 8, there is therefore now NO CONDEMNATION. SO, YOU'RE BEYOND IT. &gt;&gt; Then quit BEATING YOURSELF UP. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; GIVE THE LORD a good hand right there. [applause] I found a quote the other day that says, "Righteousness does not grow old and it does not move around or flex with your moods." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's quite powerful, isn't it? It stands forever &gt;&gt; even in heaven. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love it? &gt;&gt; Now, now this this garment that we wear, helmet, breastplate, all that we wear, it's not a ceremonial affair. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? This is not a ten can outfit that you are going to see in a museum, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is God's word put on you. The scripture says, "Take on you." &gt;&gt; Put it on. &gt;&gt; Wear it. &gt;&gt; AND DON'T JUST WEAR IT, FIGHT WITH IT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING WITH YOUR EMOTIONS. YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH THE WORD OF GOD. YOU'RE TAKING GOD'S word &gt;&gt; and USING IT AGAINST THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; This is not a Hallmark card. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or a Hallmark movie. &gt;&gt; This is God's word. &gt;&gt; And it says you can overcome. &gt;&gt; Now, the helmet is part of the armor that that keeps your identity safe. You are in God's army and you're standing secure because of what Christ has already done for you. And the word of God is unstoppable no matter how Satan attacks you. And it can never take the place of God's word. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us TO BE STRONG IN the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE POWER OF HIS MIGHT. &gt;&gt; You that fight diseases, you just came through it. You had some really bad days. And there were some days, Sister Wanda, that you felt like you couldn't put one foot in front of the other. [snorts] So, you're not trusting in your might. You know, somebody that's never been sick don't understand that. They just don't understand that. But there are days that I beg the left foot to move out onto the floor. And then I follow it with the right foot and I lay there with my head across the bed and saying, "How am I going to get the strength to get out of the bed?" But you know what I do? Fight. &gt;&gt; I'm not here this morning preaching to you because I I feel like it. &gt;&gt; I'm here because God gave me the job. &gt;&gt; And it's NOT BASED ON MY FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; God will provide strength for me. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Let's let's just preach right here for a minute. [applause] GOD'S ARMOR IS designed by God himself. &gt;&gt; It is tempered by God. IT IS GIVEN GOD'S own strength. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And you hear brother Brandham talk about that little police guy down there said he doesn't have the power to stop a bicycle. Right. &gt;&gt; But that badge HAS THE AUTHORITY OF ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT of that city behind him. &gt;&gt; He can blow his whistle and put his arm out AND BIG OLD TRUCKS HAVE TO STOP. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND HE REMINDS US THAT WHEN WE QUOTE THE WORD, ALL of heaven &gt;&gt; ALL OF HEAVEN IS BEHIND US. Why don't you just say boo devil right now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Now we have authority in the name of Jesus Christ. The little lady that just went to the back, she's my wife. She took on my name. She signs all my checks. All if I signed a check, the bank would kick it back. And say somebody fraud signed your check because in 1983 she got authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Those two became one. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; If you would ask me, brother, how much money do you have in bank? And I'm not rich. How much money do you have in the bank? I have no clue, but I'm not worried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let me just say, as a Christian, I can't fathom how much power is in the word of God. &gt;&gt; But let me just say, I don't worry about it because he's behind me. &gt;&gt; But when I come to a need, &gt;&gt; how many's ever been in need? YOU SIGN THE CHECK and send it through the bank of heaven, &gt;&gt; it will not bounce. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you just a few more. Are we still okay? &gt;&gt; When you stand in the moment that you're standing in, there's going to be times that you stand when others fall apart. &gt;&gt; I I just want to tell you some re realistic things right here. While you're standing in the word of God, there's going to be friends around you fall apart. Get that get that clear in your mind. Especially young people, get it clear in your mind. Not everybody's elect. Not everybody's predestinated. There are going to be some of your friends that will fall apart. We hear people say, "Well, they're better off now than living here in this life. That ain't necessarily true. &gt;&gt; That ain't necessarily true. If you're a Christian, that's that's right. Are you with me? But if you've lived a halfway life and you lived a sinner, you have just stepped into a really bad spot. &gt;&gt; Angels didn't walk in the door to take you home. &gt;&gt; Another realm walked in the door. &gt;&gt; I do not want that happening &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. and definitely not mine. &gt;&gt; There's something about your sight that Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes, for they see." So if God gives you sight to see and to understand, there are others that are blinded &gt;&gt; and you point people to the scriptures and they still can't see it. It's in black and white and they still can't understand it. &gt;&gt; You point it to Malachi 45 and 6 and you believe IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; REVELATIONS 10 AND 7. YOU BELIEVE that with all your heart and yet FRIENDS THAT YOU POINT towards &gt;&gt; cannot see it to save their life. Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. YOU CAN SEE IT. AND YET MULTITUDES WILL LOOK AT it &gt;&gt; and believe a trinity baptism. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Blessed are yours, &gt;&gt; for they see. &gt;&gt; Blessed are your ears, for they hear." &gt;&gt; What are you doing right there, Brother Ryan? I want you to understand there's a lot of people that can't stand where you stand. But that should not shake you. &gt;&gt; All of us has got business friends. All of us has got buddies at work. All of us has got different family members that you would love to see come in. you'd love to see come in. &gt;&gt; You can't make them see it. &gt;&gt; It takes a revelation of the word of God that drops into your heart and you go, "That's a truth." That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have to stop. But it's kind of like a man was handed a handing him a book and he was asked to read this book of the message and he read it and he brought the book back and he said, "That man called me a buzzard. &gt;&gt; That man called me a buzzard." And the man said looked at him and said, 'You know the funny thing? I read the same book and he called me an eagle. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And if you call me an eagle, that's what I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was born to fly. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something about an eagle that when he gets in trouble, he is built on &gt;&gt; with his claws. And he can crush the enemy with them claws. It's phenomenal how much power he's got in them claws. He's got certain amount of power in his [clears throat] legs, but where his safety is is in his wings. Amen. &gt;&gt; His safety is in his wings. And so when he comes into a storm, what does he do? He's built to go up. &gt;&gt; Now, a hawk, IF HE ATTEMPTS to do that, he'll blow apart cuz he's not built to do it. But an eagle &gt;&gt; is built for rapture. &gt;&gt; And in this rapture, we're going to leave, saints. This earth can't hold us down. SO HE SETS HIS WINGS &gt;&gt; AND IT CAN FLY ABOVE THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN, &gt;&gt; but he has the eyesight to see miles away. &gt;&gt; And he can see things that other birds can't see. Amen. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; We sung a song just a few moments ago about stay. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to go. When you feel the presence of God come in your car, get real quiet and just begin to worship. When he comes in your home, say, "Father, fill me with your presence. I don't care how long you've been a Christian. All of us need more." &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I wish I was like that guy. I wish I was like that lady. Let me just say this to you. They need they need this as much as you need it. &gt;&gt; They need it as much as you need it. &gt;&gt; Could we just stand now? We put on the helmet. We put on the breastplate. We pick up our sword. All of the armor that we have is for the front of us. There's nothing for the back. So, it's not for quitting &gt;&gt; and it's not for giving up. &gt;&gt; It's for fighting your enemy. &gt;&gt; Your enemy, whether it be cancer or whether it be unbelief and Mr. Skeptic and Mr. Impatient. All of us have to fight the symptoms of life. Amen. Every one of us have to fight. God bless you this morning. Don't you love the Lord with all your heart? Give the Lord a great big hand this morning. [applause] Come live in me. Oh [singing] my life [music] take over.
