after you've given you can be seated bless you all i think it's uh wonderful to be here this song that i'm going to sing uh i uh i very much like and the verses of scripture that uh that it kind of was inspired from are babylon the greatest fallen has fallen and become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird i believe that kind of you know speaks very clearly of this time but we hear you know the the scripture calling out to us in verse 4 saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and receive not of her plagues and uh you know the the chorus of this the song you know tells us not only the revelation of being called out but also to go into to live upon a higher mountain where we can live with christ if you want to sing it with me feel free babylon teaching me her pleasure-driven ways have some fun forget about tomorrow live today her music and her fashion her hollywood and passion stimulates the flesh just like wine and all the while she pulls us all away from everything divine but i have heard a voice calling me out of babylon to a higher place there's a mountain i can live and i have made my choice jesus [Music] babylon will never never [Music] the mystery reaches further to the souls [Music] she stands against revival the truth the bible finding hungry hearts with chains of fears [Music] god has made so clean but i have heard a voice [Music] there's a mountain i can live upon i have made my choice jesus [Music] on me [Music] i have heard a voice [Music] [Applause] [Music] i had made my choice jesus my joy in liberty [Music] i have made my choice jesus [Music] on me [Music] will never never [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] even though my spirit's low and it seems i can't hardly go but still i see victory [Music] many times i'm walking by faith and i can't see what lies before me but still i see victory [Music] and i just gotta tell you satan you can't cross the bloodline because i'm covered [Music] [Applause] you may stare and you may fight but you're gonna lose [Music] sometimes get hot and it seems [Music] if i were you i'd turn around [Music] you are bound to lose [Applause] [Music] because i'm covered [Music] [Applause] [Music] remember [Music] sometimes our battles get hot and it seems we're fighting a lot [Music] [Music] and if

don't we amen so if you just ask the lord to touch our bodies and minister to us amen i want you to pray for us this week as we go to louisiana and i just i just feel very moved to be able to go and very honored again to be able to be there and so many wonderful things have happened there last night when you watched titus and isaac sing i couldn't help but think bless it lord how sad did everything he could to block that seed from coming [Music] car wrecks [Music] bodies being mourned in a certain way [Music] satan did everything you could to stop it [Music] but you can't stop the seed [Music] i thought about this audience satan has done everything that he could to stop it but just take a look around [Music] the manifested bride of jesus christ living in this day satan you can't stop it [Music] amen and amen amen this week the kushners welcomed their baby it was impossible for them to have a child but god is rich in mercy amen in the same moment that that i saw the vision of of isaac brother aaron oglesby received his call to preach the gospel he'll be here in june and what a preacher he is what an absolute wonderful preacher that he is and so amen and amen this morning i want to take a thought this morning on awakening the warrior awakening the warrior turn to your neighbor and say let's have church i i just want to just lay a couple of thoughts here just for a moment we must expect to be victorious we must expect to be victorious we must expect faith to arise ex because you get what you expect if you think negative negative things happen if you have a feel sorry for me thoughts i want you to know satan will make sure that you've got enough to feel sorry about but we are an invincible army that has been built from the eternities [Music] now we're built not just to look good but to crush the enemy so we're not feeling sorry for the devil are you with me we're not giving him no days off if we're built for the job we might as well do it now remember who we are we are the queen of heaven we are the redeemed we're the blood we're bought by the blood of the lamb we are his wife and we have the same spirit and the same power hallelujah amen in history it tells us this is palm sunday that our king came riding riding into this kingdom once again time is intercepting prophecy where the bride is riding into her fulfillment amen this prophecy is becoming history and we're living it amen revelations chapter 3 and verse 21. revelations 3 and verse 21 we greet each and every one of you amen amen this is talking about you i just go right straight to you this morning to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and set down with my father in his throne i want us to read that together today to him that overcometh will i grant to set with me in my throne even as i also overcame and have set down with my father in his throne let's pray maybe you have a need on your heart just today you'd like to just raise your hand before the lord amen god knows he hears he understands heavenly father we love you today we thank you dear god to be standing in this house of worship precious saints that are loved god with all of their heart we come here to draw strength from you not from the personality of a man but from jesus christ himself and lord may you be lifted up in this this service father touch our bodies lord i i need your touch this morning i pray that you would give me strength lord i just asked you that you would just just settle my body to where that i can preach the word i ask you that you would anoint us in a special way we pray every hand that has went up every action of just even coming and overcoming the many obstacles god you're here to meet our needs today in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen you can be seated amen god bless you amen who of us here has not asked at times about the afflictions and the difficulties does god care about me the psalmist david says refuge failed me no man carried cared for for for my soul martha became over-concerned with her own workability days that she had and she even asked jesus lord do you care i am preaching to human beings how many faithful loving mothers that sit here become overwhelmed by the burdens of of babies with fevers sicknesses and earaches and tooth teeth coming in and they come to the point of exhaustion and they ask do you care you care being human beings that are sitting before us today we struggle with our dna we struggle with our thoughts we struggle with our negative thinkings we struggle with our own paranoia we struggle with our own indifferences and jealousies and gossips i know we're in church but you struggle with it satan will get divide you because he's a divider when we're supposed to be a body he tries to divide us he tries to pull us apart he gets little indifferences and little words and and he just kind of gets little feelings well that person looked at me a certain way yeah i'm preaching the right group i can see it right now but god knew in your first nature you couldn't overcome the enemy when jesus turns around to nicodemus he told him he said you must be born again now nicodemus understood scriptures he sat with great counsels he sat with great men but nicodemus knew that there had to be more i pray this morning that there's something on the inside of you that says i gotta have more of god i've got to have more of his word i need a refilling of the holy spirit in my life i challenge you to go beyond our flesh brother branham would remind us of the plane that would go beyond the brake the sound the sound barrier and he said it would get up to a certain level and almost shake apart and they would back off and it would get up to a certain level and it would almost shake apart felt like the plane was going to fly apart and they would back off but one day they broke through that thing i pray to god that we can break through the barrier of every sin every human feeling and break through it george washington was persistent at valley forge all the odds were against him the enemy had crossed was across the river but after all night in prayer the american soldiers with no shoes on their feet about one-third of them had shoes they crossed the river at valley forge through the ice three musket bullets went through george washington's coat and he had it becau but he had an answer from god and there was no need of him backing down nothing could stop him he crossed it because he was persistent he had heard from god and that's the way that we've got to be if god said so that settles it reminds you of the scriptures no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall arise in the judgment thou shalt condemn philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good working i think sometimes we just go across that scripture and go well that's that's a nice scripture understand who began that good work it wasn't your favorite preacher that began the good work this is not a club this is not a club where you just quit when you get tired of it this is not a social order of the knights of columbus or the masons or the odd fellas we're the elected born-again bride of jesus christ we have been sent here to have victory in our lives the scripture says in 4 in philippians 4 and verse 13 i can do all things i want you to say that with me i can do all things through christ which strengthens me well thank god for the 10 that showed up i want you to read it with me again i can do all things say it again until you believe it it doesn't say your preacher it does not say your favorite thing it's for you this is god's word for you sure you got job situations sure you got difficulties in your lives sure there's family problems that come up sure there's financial matters that you've got to struggle through but the scripture does not have a time date stamp on it i can't do all things beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice ends as much as ye are partakers of christ's suffering that which his glory shall be revealed in you be glad also with exceeding joy ephesians chapter 6 written from a prison finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might pass this along to your children and to your children's children we're not a weak bunch of wimps [Applause] hallelujah we're not a weak bunch of wimps be strong in the lord in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places jude chapter 1 and verse 24 now unto him that is able to keep you from fallen so the thought comes to your mind how long can i hang on where's the exit ramp here god is able to keep you from falling [Music] say it with me my god is able to keep me from falling the scripture says in isaiah 40 and verse 31 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount upon wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint read it with me but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount upon wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not think [Music] psalms 91 and verse 5 thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the error that flieth by day nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that wastes it that noon day a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come now thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come now thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways listen this is either good poetry or it's god's word [Applause] hallelujah yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me i stand here preaching before you today with cells of my body trying to destroy this flesh fear does not encompass me a lot of people get a toe ache and they're ready to quit the battle somebody didn't shake my hand somebody didn't smile somebody's upset with me grow up grow up david this ain't drama class 101 where your whole life is just drama chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter we're warriors this ain't where we decide we're going to go so far and all of a sudden we we quit [Music] we're wires here if i've taught you anything as a body of believers it's when you're in the midst of a battle you don't run you don't bellyache about how bad it is you fight and you don't fight with your flesh you fight with the word of god because that's the only thing that will defeat the devil you don't fight with your emotions you don't fight with your ability of strength you fight with the word of god because your mouth has the power of life and death in it and if you utter the words of god's word satan has felt the sting of that sword over and over again i want to read that scripture again yea though i walk through the valley of shadow of death i will fear no evil thou art with me thy rod and thy staff that comfort me sister connie's been with me brother matthew's been with me and heard the doctors ask how much longer do you want to fight how much longer you want to keep taking this chemo i'm not quitting i didn't come to this battle to quit and neither did i come to this battle to wine as a matter of fact i don't even need you pitying me or feeling sorry for me because god had confidence in me before this battle ever came so our confidence is not in the flesh our confidence is in god now i'm not just saying that about myself there's brothers and sisters that fight an incredible battle now i want to say to you today you may be laying in the bed and feel like the death is swirling around you just take the word of god just take the word of god there's angels that are standing there you fight through the darkness [Applause] year of god little children and i've overcame them are you with me now because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world any of you that's ever taken physics knows that greater means that the greater is greater than the lesser so satan is in the lesser kingdom and that means that our god is greater than every devil that's in hell [Music] [Applause] finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might i know i just read it but i noticed that you didn't get it finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of hysmoth hebrews 12 and verse 1 wherefore see and we're also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every pity party every indifferent feeling every ugliness of our humanity bridle our tongue bridle our mind you ever been around anybody that everybody's got something against them i worked with a man for about 12 years and he was eat up with paranoia we was at a large meeting one day and and he was sitting beside him he was about 60 years old at that point we were sitting in the the nitroglycerin section office and he said see there said he's looking at me superintendent is looking at me this whole meeting's about me and i'm gonna tell i told him what i'm going to tell you get over yourself [Music] get over yourself you're not that important the world i want to give you some shock value the world does not revolve around you it don't revolve around you get up get over yourself and become a productive citizen in the kingdom of god help somebody else get enough victory about you that you can have a victory and a testimony to another person it's good eh this is why the devil making me so sick this morning if i counted right i up chucked eight times before i walked to this pulpit i don't know probably hardly any other person that would have walked and even sat through the service but god put something on the inside of me that said i'm sorry devil i'm not giving them to you now for the phobias i don't have nothing at any of you you can't give cancer away i've tried to give it away over and over again the scripture mark chapter 16 this is jesus's some of his last words that's going to be disciples that are going to shake the the devil's kingdom and you have been built in laodicea with the greatest message this has ever been to shake satan's kingdom go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and then baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover [Applause] we are asked to put on the whole armor because we are at war your greatest enemy is not your wife it's not your husband it's not your principal or your teacher at school it is not your mom and dad mark twain said my father said at 16 years old i thought my father was the stupidest man in the world when i turned 23 i found out my daddy was the smartest man in the world [Music] amen your greatest enemy it's the one that you call the half battleground is in your mind because positive and negative thoughts converge and it's whichever words that you let slip out negative atmosphere atmosphere of fear atmosphere of doubt atmosphere that everybody's against me well i'm the only one in my my school that wears a dress hallelujah good god didn't have to put a thousand people around you to prop you up he had confidence in the seed that he put on the inside of you that you might be the only one in your family or in your work or in your school that he could have lived this word you're just looking at it wrong because on the other side of this veil they would have wished they'd have been [Applause] so who is the strongest well brother ron i don't have a tattoo i love mary but you married martha how'd that work out for you [Applause] i promise you i didn't know the quicker that you understand the battle that you've been sent here to war the quicker you'll get your lunchbox packed and you'll pull your sword and say we're ready [Applause] a lot of people want to shatter box the devil as long as they don't get hit whoo mike tyson forgive me here but mike tyson said everybody came into the ring with a plan but it once i hit him in the mouth the plan left [Applause] there's a lot of people sitting pews a lot a preacher stands in pulpits and as long as they haven't been in a battle everybody's got hallelujahs going on but you just stand toe-to-toe with the devil one time and fight him and feel his cold breath he's been at war a long time he is no paper tiger he would destroy you if he could i personally remind him over and over again you have proved devil in my own life you don't have enough [Music] a lot of people's only been in a good hugging match not a fight if you're ever in a fight with the devil you know it's warriors for the newcomers that are here welcome to war this ain't about how you vote i'm not trying to make you better citizens of the united states of america or of iran or iraq or of ireland or of russia because this world's not our home [Music] and we're from another kingdom we've just got to act like we're from another kingdom we gotta fight like we're from another kingdom [Applause] caesar was going to have somebody to ride in his carriage you've heard it a lot of times the great officers got their self ready polished their plumes they got all of their feathers just right and he went through and he saw a man there that had a lot of scars on him he said where'd you get your scars i got them fighting for you i want to take that just for a moment just remind you a lot of them soldiers they never put a sword against again another person you know a lot of times people that you look at and go wow they're a real soldier they ain't really been in a fight yet but when you see somebody with scars and they're still standing ain't that right brother fred when you see somebody with scars and they're still standing and they've been in a fight that's the guy that i want to pray for me it's not the god that says now i lay me down to sleep i pray to lord my soul to keep if i should die before i wake i pray to lord my soul to take it's that one that says thank you god that i made it through this day within my own self i didn't have the strength to get through it but you helped me god rest my body and when i put my feet on the floor tomorrow give me the strength to block the devil right in the eye [Applause] let's just think about this no weapon that has formed against me hurt feelings hurt feelings hurt attitudes bruised and battered i sent you a text this week i want that to be said about me that i you can't tell who's enemy and who's not folks let me just say this to you on this side of the veil i don't care who sits down beside of me i want to try to make that person a better person if they're the biggest devil in hell i want to get them converted well brother ron i can't stand that person because you need more love of god in your heart [Applause] if there's somebody you can't stand to be around why don't you do the opposite why don't you walk right up to them shake their hand and tell them you just don't know how much i love you if i tell you that later at the at the thing you just don't know how much you don't know what they said sticks and stones are brick but your words gonna never hurt me i resigned to myself a long time ago i'm better than losers this is my personal notes this visit's all right i resigned myself a long time ago i'm better than losers i'm better than quitters i'm better than backsliders sometimes we get an idea that backsliding is quitting church going to get a good drink i've been serving the lord really hard where was you last week well i've been serving the lord really hard i just decide to take the weekend off and get drunk backsliding is not that backsliding can be qualified as sitting in these pews and putting up a shell around yourself and folding your arms i'm not looking for your arms and saying well i hope that you guys catch up with me if your life only on fire for god you're backsliding if your prayer life if you're not breaking through your backsliding if you're not reading your bible and praying every day you'll backslide are you with me now we must remain focused focus with no fear refuse to be afraid satan stacks the odds against you you don't have to tell him how big he is he'll tell you how big he is it isn't david that's going out there and measuring the life measuring his his staff counting his brothers [Music] golots already told them how big he is you don't have to worry about your trial coming along and the mountains are so big can i just say this to you you will never find your eagle wings safely resting in your nest can i say it to you you will never find your eagle wings resting safely in your nest it's when you get dropped off of a cliff by mama and she shakes you off and you go you either find your wings or you find the bottom [Music] [Applause] [Music] mommy dropped me that's exactly what she did flap your wings [Applause] sometimes brother david we just need to look over in there say move over i got to flap my wings here a little bit [Music] i watched some of your last notches flapping your wings you've been through hell all week and you came into church to get your payday and you get started flapping your wings a little bit and you get a little air under your wings how before long you go to the people that are watching it's more than emotion those
