[42:46] moment
[42:47] in that time good to be in the house of
[42:50] the Lord isn't it good to see you
[42:52] had a wonderful trip to Louisiana Andrew
[42:54] did well too he wasn't gonna
[42:59] our prayer line went to after 12 o'clock
[43:02] the other night and many many
[43:04] deliverances
[43:06] God gave us strength to be able to
[43:08] preach
[43:09] and then stand in the prayer line and
[43:12] and then I was prayed for last and
[43:14] that's all I knew and so that's the
[43:17] first time that's ever happened to me
[43:18] and uh and mine just passed right out
[43:22] while you're being prayed for and so
[43:25] and just we had a wonderful time and so
[43:27] God did amazing things and hey you guys
[43:30] had great Services here too and so we
[43:33] thank the Lord for that
[43:36] the Bride is a many membered bride
[43:38] around the world
[43:42] when you hear Brother Branham talk about
[43:43] the vision of the Bride
[43:46] out of every nation
[43:48] shall come waving her flag
[44:01] it's just not America
[44:05] it's all over the world
[44:09] many years ago I met Brother David
[44:13] I was to preach a convention there
[44:17] Brother David picked me up and we had
[44:18] met on a couple of other occasions and
[44:22] maybe 2008
[44:24] at the witness convention
[44:26] at brother bisco's
[44:28] then at Switzerland
[44:31] and I was invited to come to Belgium
[44:35] with Judo
[44:38] and
[44:41] Brother David picked me up and
[44:44] he showed me around the city a bit
[44:48] and we didn't know each other well
[44:52] he probably knew me but a lot better
[44:53] than I knew him
[44:55] [Music]
[44:57] we sat down at a table and
[45:01] as we're sitting across from one another
[45:03] the Lord whispered in my ear
[45:06] this is one of my generals
[45:10] and I've come to greatly appreciate this
[45:13] General
[45:16] he's a pastor in Belgium
[45:19] he's done a phenomenal job there
[45:22] his his dad
[45:24] brother Hank
[45:26] is a great man whom I deeply love
[45:29] along with his family
[45:32] and we're just honored to have Brother
[45:34] David here
[45:38] he'll preach in his second language
[45:39] English
[45:41] I think he speaks in about four or five
[45:43] different languages
[45:44] I speak in one
[45:47] and I don't do a really great job of
[45:49] that
[45:53] but if you come under expectation to
[45:55] hear from God
[45:58] will take his General from Belgium
[46:03] and he'll talk to you
[46:05] [Music]
[46:07] and if you pay close close attention
[46:10] there will be some sentences come your
[46:12] way
[46:14] and you will know
[46:16] that man don't know me
[46:19] but the voice behind The Voice
[46:23] knows me very well
[46:26] Brother David has a wonderful family a
[46:28] wife and four children
[46:30] he talked to them today and I got to
[46:32] talk to him by face face time
[46:36] and I noticed in his eyes
[46:39] he got that distant look
[46:43] so as he comes toward the end of the
[46:45] service we're
[46:46] we're praying the helicopter don't land
[46:48] here
[46:50] and take him home so he's got a couple
[46:52] more days here and so Brother David
[46:56] we love you with all of our hearts
[46:59] and the god that's in you we're very
[47:02] familiar with
[47:03] and we're honored deeply honored to have
[47:07] you here with us tonight give him a
[47:09] great big hands
[47:42] so it's good to be in the house of the
[47:44] Lord tonight amen
[47:46] I hope you were glad to come here
[47:49] and if not if not let's go home glad
[47:52] amen may the Lord change our hearts amen
[47:55] so I bring you greetings from our
[47:57] country Belgium for those who don't know
[48:02] I won't give you geography lessons but
[48:05] it's a little tiny country stuck between
[48:08] Holland Germany and France and a bit of
[48:11] Luxembourg and on the other side the
[48:15] west side we have the North Sea so where
[48:18] we had our meeting since 96 youth our
[48:22] youth camp winter camp so the Lord
[48:25] willing will have that in January
[48:27] and for those who don't know me I've
[48:30] been a co-pester for about 10 years in
[48:33] the church
[48:35] and I've been pastors since 2017 and the
[48:41] Lord has been faithful and he still is
[48:44] amen so it's my joy and pleasure to
[48:47] bring you greetings from our church in
[48:50] Nazareth Belgium
[48:53] so if if you think can anything good
[48:56] come from Nazareth
[49:00] let me give you a Bible answer
[49:03] come and see amen
[49:09] and God bless you
[49:14] so we're thankful my
[49:17] maybe you can bring up the picture
[49:19] tonight and I just wanted to show this
[49:22] picture
[49:24] that bald-headed guy in the back so the
[49:28] second from the right is my grandfather
[49:30] Armand van heese
[49:33] and he came here in 71
[49:35] he uh preached in the Church of Ruther
[49:38] Folger if I'm not mistaking
[49:40] and on this trip I also met brother
[49:43] Fulcher so it's quite amazing and then
[49:47] here in the with the brown jacket that's
[49:50] uh brother Ron and brother Mark's father
[49:53] brother Charlie
[49:55] so they met together
[49:57] and also brother Fulcher is on the
[49:59] picture and then the brother here to the
[50:02] right is brother Wilfried he's still
[50:04] alive in Belgium he still loves this
[50:07] message with all of his heart
[50:09] I regularly go to visit him and he he
[50:13] remembers still the trip here to the U.S
[50:15] I spoke I showed him the same picture
[50:18] isn't that amazing this was 71
[50:21] and here we are maybe 52 years later
[50:25] and the grandson of this Mighty Man
[50:29] is allowed to to make Tiny Steps in
[50:32] those big footsteps
[50:33] and it's it's just amazing how the Lord
[50:36] does things so we we are very very
[50:39] thankful maybe you have a close-up from
[50:41] my grandfather so that's my grandfather
[50:44] I was very close with him
[50:46] uh was often at the house and there was
[50:50] a mighty man of God he he founded our
[50:53] church and again I won't give you a
[50:56] lesson in the seven Church ages tonight
[50:58] but he uh broke away from
[51:02] the Lord called him as a young man in
[51:04] the Army and he went to Bible school he
[51:07] was a Baptist and went into the Full
[51:09] Gospel and brother Perry green brought
[51:11] the message to our country and
[51:15] there's some powerful things that
[51:16] happened he couldn't understand English
[51:18] so he got the reel to real tapes from
[51:21] Brother Branham and one day two
[51:23] ministers came and prayed with him and
[51:26] they
[51:26] just put the tape on and he could
[51:29] understand every word in English
[51:32] that's the God we serve
[51:34] amen and so he broke down in his office
[51:37] while listening to the prophet for the
[51:39] first time and he was crying and weeping
[51:42] rejoicing and said this is what I've
[51:44] been looking for all of my life
[51:47] and so we are a living testimony that
[51:51] the message is more than quotes and
[51:53] books
[51:54] but it's it's a real life it's the Life
[51:57] of Christ so we we come to testify
[51:59] tonight and
[52:01] and so there's many people praying for
[52:03] this service and we are thankful to be
[52:06] here
[52:07] it's hard to tell how but a few months
[52:10] ago
[52:11] the Lord just spoke to my heart that
[52:13] would I would be standing here
[52:15] so he knows everything and I know he the
[52:19] Lord doesn't make mistakes
[52:21] so uh we had wonderful meetings at
[52:24] Easter at brother Berry coffees and a
[52:27] wonderful man of God and he really
[52:30] treated us like a king and sister Becky
[52:33] and also so we are so thankful to be
[52:35] here especially at the Easter season
[52:38] where we had the meetings and the Lord
[52:40] did really powerful things also there
[52:43] minister to the personal needs and he's
[52:46] the same here tonight amen
[52:49] I want to share before we go into the
[52:52] word
[52:53] this is quite personal but I told it to
[52:57] brother Ron yesterday evening for the
[52:59] first time
[53:00] a dream I had
[53:03] in 21 and and this was the night from
[53:06] the 26th to the 27th of January 21.
[53:11] about brother Ron
[53:13] and
[53:15] as you know we we've met several times
[53:18] and the Lord has really used your pastor
[53:21] to bless us personally
[53:23] and I remember specifically in
[53:26] Switzerland I went to the The Altar and
[53:29] uh
[53:31] you know brother run under the anointing
[53:33] just mentioned a whole lot of things
[53:36] that
[53:37] nobody could know about he didn't know
[53:40] about but the Lord knew
[53:42] so uh all kinds of spirits that were
[53:45] against the ministry and I was so
[53:48] encouraged by that that it was
[53:50] identified so clearly and that the Lord
[53:52] would be our help and he has proven to
[53:55] be so
[53:57] so I had this dream and
[54:01] in this dream we uh there was like a
[54:04] little shed where brother Ron had had
[54:06] spent the night
[54:08] and so I just came to greet him and in
[54:12] this dream he had he put on his cap like
[54:14] you have in America very often a cap and
[54:18] he kind of made a joke like my cap is
[54:21] still fitting me after the operation
[54:22] from the brain tumor and
[54:27] the next the dream changes to I saw like
[54:31] a big shopping mall and
[54:34] with a lot of stores on both sides and
[54:37] several levels where you could look and
[54:39] it looked like we had ended a meeting
[54:42] and we we were a whole group of
[54:44] ministers all the ministers you know and
[54:46] several
[54:47] and we work on this it was like a huge
[54:50] bridge in the middle of this this
[54:52] gallery or the storage with several
[54:54] levels and there was a big roof and and
[54:58] great big pillars coming down to the
[55:02] ground but we were walking like on a
[55:04] higher elevated bridge that went through
[55:07] the building
[55:09] and so
[55:13] we looked down downstairs to where the
[55:16] one pillar went down and there I saw a
[55:19] brother run standing by that pillar and
[55:22] he was standing there alone waiting and
[55:24] and there was something that came over
[55:26] me
[55:28] and I spoke to the preachers in in that
[55:31] dream that it's not just up to brother
[55:34] run alone to believe for his healing but
[55:37] that we have to start doing the same to
[55:40] believe with him
[55:41] and and it ended with this we are in
[55:44] this together
[55:45] and so I I believe
[55:49] I dream a lot generally but when I woke
[55:51] up there was such a presence of the holy
[55:54] spirit in the room
[55:55] and I've never told this anyone until
[55:59] yesterday evening so I wanted to share
[56:02] that and just let you know that that
[56:05] little church in Belgium has been
[56:07] praying for your pastor
[56:09] people have been praying and fasting
[56:11] also and we believe that everything all
[56:14] things are possible
[56:16] Hallelujah
[56:17] so we just like to encourage you with
[56:19] that and well let's stand for the
[56:22] reading of the word and
[56:25] I want to thank brother Ron for
[56:28] allowing me to speak tonight or should I
[56:31] say
[56:32] brother Andrew this is usually your
[56:34] night so
[56:37] thank you very much for making the way
[56:39] and allowing us to speak brother and so
[56:42] enjoy your ministry and
[56:44] you're anointed singing
[56:46] lots of people back home follow your
[56:49] meetings and it's a great blessing
[56:51] and I just had it on my heart to
[56:54] come back as a little
[56:57] Act of Thanksgiving just to lift up the
[57:01] the hands of brother on lift up his arm
[57:04] and brother Andrew we are really proud
[57:06] of you in the midst of all the all of
[57:07] this and the brothers the church and and
[57:11] let me say God is proud of you all amen
[57:15] so let's go to the scripture and we want
[57:17] to read habakkuk I don't know I hope you
[57:21] don't mind my Flemish accent
[57:25] and the
[57:27] but we'll do our best to make ourselves
[57:32] understandable to you habakkuk chapter 2
[57:37] and then we also go to
[57:39] revelation
[57:41] chapter 5
[57:48] while you're turning there I want to
[57:51] thank everyone the Spencer family
[57:53] especially for the good care and and
[57:57] we are just treated like kings and
[58:01] I'm so thankful for that may the Lord
[58:03] give them back a hundredfold
[58:06] so
[58:10] habakkuk chapter 2 verse 1.
[58:14] I will stand upon my watch and set me
[58:17] upon the tower
[58:19] and will watch to see what he will say
[58:22] unto me
[58:23] and what I shall answer when I am
[58:26] reproved
[58:27] and the Lord answered me and said write
[58:30] the vision and make it plain upon tables
[58:33] that he may run that readeth hit
[58:37] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[58:39] time
[58:40] but at the end it shall speak
[58:43] and not lie
[58:45] though it Terry wait for it
[58:50] because it will surely come it will not
[58:53] Tarry
[58:55] or many can say Amen to that Hallelujah
[58:58] let's go to Revelation 5 verse 5. and 6.
[59:05] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[59:08] not behold the line of the tribe of
[59:12] Judah
[59:13] the root of David hath prevailed
[59:17] to open the book and to lose the Seven
[59:20] Seals thereof
[59:21] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[59:24] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[59:27] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[59:30] had been slain having seven horns and
[59:33] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[59:36] of God sent forth into all the Earth
[59:41] may God adds the blessing to the reading
[59:44] of his word let's just pray together and
[59:46] if you have a need tonight you can slip
[59:48] up your hand to the Lord and he knows
[59:51] what you
[59:52] have need of many hands
[59:56] dear heavenly father I have my hand
[59:58] lifted up also and
[1:00:01] father I
[1:00:02] humbly ask you that you will
[1:00:05] come tonight and help us Minister Lord
[1:00:07] Jesus anoint our lips to speak anoint
[1:00:11] the heroes to hear and father we all
[1:00:15] have needs we are a needy people Lord
[1:00:17] you know what has been below every hand
[1:00:20] Lord
[1:00:21] and father I don't know what this church
[1:00:24] needs I don't know what the needs are
[1:00:26] but you know and I pray you will Direct
[1:00:30] the father this service towards the
[1:00:32] needs of the people Lord
[1:00:34] father I I have prepared something
[1:00:38] but I'm willing to let go now Lord Jesus
[1:00:40] and follow your leading and not just me
[1:00:43] but all of us Lord we want to be led by
[1:00:46] your Holy Spirit
[1:00:47] father we rebuke every spirit that may
[1:00:52] stand against your Holy Spirit in the
[1:00:54] mighty name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:56] father we pray that your Holy Spirit may
[1:00:59] have Fuller preeminence tonight
[1:01:01] Lord when we go back home May our hearts
[1:01:04] be burning
[1:01:05] father may we say this wasn't our hearts
[1:01:08] burning when he talked to us along the
[1:01:10] way
[1:01:11] we humbly ask this Lord and we thank you
[1:01:14] Lord for brother Ron and we thank you
[1:01:16] that his healing is a completed work of
[1:01:19] Calvary Lord
[1:01:21] father we pray that you will continue to
[1:01:23] bless him and strengthen him Lord The
[1:01:26] church here and the office bearers we
[1:01:29] ask this and pray this in the name of
[1:01:30] Jesus Amen you may be seated God bless
[1:01:34] you
[1:01:35] hmm
[1:01:42] I would like to speak tonight as a title
[1:01:45] The Long awaited answer
[1:01:49] Hallelujah
[1:01:50] the long-awaited answer
[1:01:54] I don't know how it is with you but
[1:01:58] I think it's typical for a human nature
[1:02:01] that we have a hard time to wait
[1:02:03] generally speaking
[1:02:05] I don't know if there's anyone here who
[1:02:07] loves the waiting rooms at the dentist
[1:02:10] or the doctor
[1:02:11] I don't think so
[1:02:13] with the old magazines that hundreds of
[1:02:16] peoples have touched already
[1:02:18] and
[1:02:20] people complaining about this and that
[1:02:23] I believe our church is not a waiting
[1:02:25] room so to say but it's a birth room
[1:02:28] Hallelujah but there is a part of
[1:02:31] Christianity where God teaches us to
[1:02:34] wait
[1:02:35] Hallelujah and I believe if we are
[1:02:37] faithful in the waiting process at some
[1:02:40] time our name will be called
[1:02:43] and we'll have an appointment with Jesus
[1:02:45] Christ
[1:02:47] isn't that a relief when you've been
[1:02:49] sitting there for 45 minutes and
[1:02:52] suddenly you hear your name called
[1:02:54] Hallelujah isn't it wonderful when you
[1:02:56] hear your name called
[1:02:59] and saying it's my turn tonight
[1:03:01] so right from the start I want to
[1:03:03] encourage you tonight
[1:03:06] that Lord call my name
[1:03:09] whatever you need is Lord call my name
[1:03:12] Hallelujah he's the same God that said
[1:03:15] Mary and her eyes were open and she
[1:03:18] thought it was the gardener but when he
[1:03:20] called her by her name
[1:03:22] Hallelujah she knew it was Jesus
[1:03:27] Hallelujah I believe God sent us a
[1:03:30] message and and I believe
[1:03:34] you know the disciples returned to Jesus
[1:03:37] and they said they rejoiced and they
[1:03:39] said well demons are subject to us
[1:03:42] and Jesus said Rejoice not that demons
[1:03:45] are subject but that your names are
[1:03:48] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:03:51] Hallelujah so we believe that God's
[1:03:54] commissioned the church to cast out
[1:03:56] demons and and we can be happy about it
[1:04:01] you know those who have ever been bound
[1:04:03] we should be happy you know
[1:04:05] I know what it was like to be bound and
[1:04:08] now I am free
[1:04:09] but the greatest joy is to know that
[1:04:12] your name is written in heaven
[1:04:15] Hallelujah
[1:04:16] Hallelujah
[1:04:18] look that's what the song says I have a
[1:04:20] name written in glory and it's mine
[1:04:24] oh Lord help us
[1:04:26] Hallelujah
[1:04:39] that's I want to read this in Revelation
[1:04:43] 10 7.
[1:04:45] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:04:47] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:04:50] sound
[1:04:51] the mystery singular of God should be
[1:04:55] finished
[1:04:57] as he had declared to his servants the
[1:05:00] prophet
[1:05:08] so many times we see this when it's
[1:05:10] singular the seed singular of Abraham
[1:05:15] the mystery of singular of God it is
[1:05:19] referring to Christ
[1:05:21] the prophet comes after the opening of
[1:05:24] the seals and he says Christ is the
[1:05:27] mystery singular of God revealed
[1:05:30] Hallelujah and we know Christ is the
[1:05:33] seed the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:05:37] Hallelujah Christ is the one that would
[1:05:40] crush the Serpent's head
[1:05:43] Hallelujah
[1:05:46] and we know I I we know you've been well
[1:05:50] taught so we don't have to go into the
[1:05:52] depth of the doctrine of it but we know
[1:05:55] that Revelation 10 7 the the seventh
[1:05:59] angel that is brother Branham he's a
[1:06:01] forerunner just like John the Baptist
[1:06:03] was for his first coming now this
[1:06:07] seventh angel is a forerunner of his
[1:06:09] second coming for the Rapture Hallelujah
[1:06:12] and he is introducing Revelations 10 1
[1:06:16] the mighty Angel which is Christ
[1:06:19] Hallelujah
[1:06:21] but we know the prophet is has come and
[1:06:25] he's gone now and we are now living
[1:06:27] under this dispensation where the
[1:06:31] transition went from Elijah Elijah
[1:06:34] Ministry to Elisha
[1:06:36] which is brother Branham in type in our
[1:06:39] day and the bride is Elisha is a type of
[1:06:43] the Bride of you and I amen
[1:06:45] so we now we come into picture
[1:06:49] Hallelujah you and I come into picture
[1:06:52] and and remember that before Elijah went
[1:06:57] away was raptured in a fiery chariot
[1:07:00] that he said whatever you ask it shall
[1:07:03] be given unto you
[1:07:06] Hallelujah Jesus said the same thing if
[1:07:10] you shall say to this mountain be
[1:07:11] removed and cast into the sea and shall
[1:07:15] not doubt in your heart but believe that
[1:07:17] those things which he said shall come to
[1:07:20] pass he shall have whatever he saith
[1:07:27] Hallelujah
[1:07:29] how many believe that's what we possess
[1:07:31] tonight
[1:07:32] by God's grace Hallelujah and so we see
[1:07:35] Elisha now the last words Elijah
[1:07:39] expresses this if you see me when I go
[1:07:42] you shall have what you asked for
[1:07:45] so in other words if you see me as being
[1:07:49] gone
[1:07:51] Hallelujah so if you understand now that
[1:07:55] the ministry of Elijah is over
[1:07:58] he has played his part so it's a
[1:08:01] revelation to see brother Branham has
[1:08:04] played his part now it's our part to
[1:08:06] play
[1:08:07] then you will have your request
[1:08:10] Hallelujah
[1:08:12] then you can ask what you will if you
[1:08:15] understand it's not well when brother
[1:08:17] Branham was here and all those things
[1:08:19] but when we quote what he said
[1:08:22] Hallelujah let's be careful that we
[1:08:25] don't make him a god of History
[1:08:28] oh what if brother Branham would be here
[1:08:30] let me tell you the god of Elijah is
[1:08:33] here tonight
[1:08:35] Hallelujah
[1:08:38] oh what if my grandfather could be here
[1:08:40] with all the Miracles and the signs let
[1:08:43] me tell you the god of my grandfather is
[1:08:46] here tonight
[1:08:47] Hallelujah
[1:08:51] the god of brother Homer is here tonight
[1:08:55] Hallelujah and and as we said the other
[1:08:57] day if they could be here present in
[1:09:00] this meeting they would be so proud of
[1:09:03] you
[1:09:04] they would be rejoicing and happy and
[1:09:07] say press on this is what we fought for
[1:09:10] Hallelujah this is what we struggled for
[1:09:14] this is what we prayed for
[1:09:18] Hallelujah
[1:09:20] but they died in faith
[1:09:24] having not attained the promises and and
[1:09:27] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:09:31] so they need us and we need them
[1:09:35] aren't we thankful there is a cloud of
[1:09:38] witnesses tonight
[1:09:41] I see brother Guido watching over the
[1:09:43] banisters of Heaven I see my grandfather
[1:09:46] as a Young Man
[1:09:47] Hallelujah I see your former Pastor
[1:09:50] brother Homer I see brother Charlie
[1:09:53] Hallelujah cheering Us in another
[1:09:55] dimension
[1:09:57] every time a soul gets saved they are
[1:10:00] rejoicing with the angels
[1:10:03] let me take of my armor here
[1:10:07] thank you brother
[1:10:09] I hope that's okay in this church
[1:10:13] Hallelujah
[1:10:17] you know what
[1:10:19] when we'll get to heaven
[1:10:21] there will be a lineup like both lines
[1:10:24] like a hedge of Honor
[1:10:27] and all the people of the seven Church
[1:10:29] ages will stand there
[1:10:32] and in a salute and they will start to
[1:10:34] be clapping
[1:10:35] for you and I
[1:10:37] how did the young people ever
[1:10:40] overcome in such an age
[1:10:42] how did parents overcome in such an age
[1:10:47] where the devil has turned everything
[1:10:49] upside down Satan's Eden you know Satan
[1:10:53] is the same back home as here he's in
[1:10:56] politics are rotten to the Core
[1:10:59] call it communism call it whatever you
[1:11:02] want to call it democracy is rotten to
[1:11:04] the Core
[1:11:06] there's only one hope for the church and
[1:11:10] that's Christ
[1:11:11] coming back for his church
[1:11:14] Hallelujah
[1:11:16] and I believe the end time message meets
[1:11:20] the end time conditions
[1:11:24] I couldn't take my grandfather's place
[1:11:27] to stand up against the Catholicism
[1:11:30] to stand up as a as a beacon of light in
[1:11:34] the middle in the midst of a Catholic
[1:11:36] country and stand as a Pioneer and stand
[1:11:40] as a Baptist Minister first and then
[1:11:42] come receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:44] Spirit and people made fun of him
[1:11:48] and then he would come into the message
[1:11:50] and start preaching the serpent seed and
[1:11:53] and health the church would just leave
[1:11:56] you know what I couldn't take his place
[1:12:00] yeah
[1:12:02] but he couldn't take mine
[1:12:05] God had a time and a season for everyone
[1:12:10] Hallelujah God has a time for a brother
[1:12:12] on for brother Andrew for brother Homer
[1:12:14] and he does things perfectly
[1:12:19] but you know
[1:12:21] God has given us the authority of his
[1:12:24] word and we are not just preaching about
[1:12:26] well gods and the prophet but we are
[1:12:29] preaching from an open book
[1:12:31] Hallelujah
[1:12:33] Hallelujah
[1:12:35] the answer is in there
[1:12:37] Hallelujah Christ is the mystery of God
[1:12:40] revealed he is the answer you say I'm
[1:12:43] I'm praying for an answer
[1:12:46] and and let me tell you he doesn't only
[1:12:48] have the answer
[1:12:50] he is the answer
[1:12:52] so as long as we have Jesus we have the
[1:12:56] answer
[1:12:57] how many believe that he is present here
[1:12:59] tonight
[1:13:01] he said I will never leave you nor
[1:13:03] forsake you
[1:13:04] Hallelujah
[1:13:09] I was born and raised in the message
[1:13:12] but let me tell you it never became
[1:13:14] common to me
[1:13:16] it all it always kept becoming more
[1:13:19] special to me and I trust that the same
[1:13:22] that's the same for you
[1:13:24] you might have questions about the
[1:13:26] message
[1:13:27] let me tell you it was always Satan's
[1:13:30] business to put a question mark behind
[1:13:32] the word of God
[1:13:34] he said when Jesus was on the earth he
[1:13:36] said if thou be the Son of God turn
[1:13:39] these stones into bread
[1:13:41] if thou be the Son of God jump from this
[1:13:44] Pinnacle of the Temple
[1:13:47] and he misquoted the scripture he does
[1:13:50] the same thing today
[1:13:52] but I want to tell you tonight that
[1:13:55] Jesus conquered all three Temptations
[1:13:59] not with his authority not with his
[1:14:03] power he could have killed Satan on the
[1:14:06] spot
[1:14:07] but he used his own word
[1:14:10] he said it is written
[1:14:13] and the prophet explains this you know
[1:14:15] why so that the weakest believer amongst
[1:14:18] us
[1:14:19] can use his word
[1:14:23] and defeat Satan
[1:14:27] Hallelujah any time
[1:14:30] any place
[1:14:32] under any conditions
[1:14:34] what a promise we have in this word
[1:14:42] but the hardest thing is we know God is
[1:14:45] real we know God answers prayer the
[1:14:47] hardest thing is to wait on the Lord
[1:14:51] he says here in the message perseverance
[1:14:53] the first thing you have to do if you're
[1:14:55] going to find Christ you got to know
[1:14:58] that you've got a need of him
[1:15:02] when you think that you just don't need
[1:15:04] him you'll never find him
[1:15:06] because you won't search him diligently
[1:15:09] that you notice what the scripture said
[1:15:11] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[1:15:15] shall be opened and and he goes on and
[1:15:18] it'll be opened and not just say I went
[1:15:21] out Lord here I am you want me that's
[1:15:23] not it he that seeketh he that knocketh
[1:15:27] he says it's a continuation
[1:15:30] so it doesn't happen always right on the
[1:15:33] spot
[1:15:34] if you are praying for the holy spirit
[1:15:36] let me tell you he said the same message
[1:15:40] to the disciples he said go to the city
[1:15:43] of Jerusalem and tarry there
[1:15:46] wait there
[1:15:48] it's one of the hardest things to do
[1:15:49] they sit in a room nothing going on
[1:15:53] so to say but they they were fulfilling
[1:15:55] promise
[1:15:57] he didn't tell them it's going to take
[1:15:59] 10 days and the 10th day it's going to
[1:16:01] happen he just said wait
[1:16:04] so God has a program for every one of
[1:16:07] you
[1:16:09] he has a specific set time for your
[1:16:13] healing
[1:16:14] for your miracle
[1:16:16] for your new birth
[1:16:19] Hallelujah but he says here like the
[1:16:22] unjust judge and the widow she
[1:16:25] constantly knocked on his door she was
[1:16:27] persistent
[1:16:29] if he turned her away
[1:16:31] tomorrow she was on his hands again
[1:16:34] that's the way you want to get to God be
[1:16:37] on his hands every morning every night
[1:16:40] every day all the time constantly just
[1:16:44] keep seeking asking knocking
[1:16:48] he says just don't knock a little while
[1:16:50] and get tired and go away just keep
[1:16:53] standing there
[1:16:55] Lord I'm here
[1:16:57] and I'm not going to leave
[1:17:00] I'm on your hands now I'm going to stay
[1:17:03] right here you're getting tired
[1:17:06] listening I'm having a great time
[1:17:08] knocking
[1:17:11] you know why because I know you are
[1:17:14] coming
[1:17:15] hallelujah hallelujah he's coming
[1:17:18] brother sister he's coming
[1:17:24] so we see that he
[1:17:27] he answered actually
[1:17:29] Jesus answered with a Bible answer he
[1:17:32] answered with a scriptural answer
[1:17:35] and and
[1:17:37] we are so thankful that in this day
[1:17:41] they asked the question about who is
[1:17:44] John the Baptist and they they asked all
[1:17:47] kinds of questions are you the Christ
[1:17:49] that you come are you alive and he said
[1:17:52] I am the voice of one crying in the
[1:17:54] wilderness so he went back to the
[1:17:57] scripture what it said about himself so
[1:18:00] we should do the same
[1:18:02] Hallelujah so we know brother Branham is
[1:18:05] the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and Luke 17
[1:18:08] 30 and Revelation 10 7 which we just
[1:18:12] read let me tell you you and I are the
[1:18:15] Fulfillment of Revelation
[1:18:18] 10 verse 8 to 11.
[1:18:21] what is what is the story go to the
[1:18:24] angel
[1:18:25] so it means even as after brother
[1:18:27] Branham is it's gone and he's played his
[1:18:30] part the angel is still there
[1:18:34] the angel is still with this message
[1:18:37] the angel is still in your midst
[1:18:39] Hallelujah
[1:18:43] so we should start to be to be standing
[1:18:46] on the scripture and say this is my part
[1:18:48] and he says go and take the book out of
[1:18:52] the right hand of that angel
[1:18:55] so we should take the word of God it is
[1:18:57] written and he said eat the book take it
[1:19:01] up
[1:19:01] Hallelujah and and that's why the
[1:19:04] prophet even after the opening of the
[1:19:06] seals he says don't try to be peculiar
[1:19:09] just continue to read your Bible and
[1:19:12] pray because we need to read the Bible
[1:19:15] first and then we understand the
[1:19:17] promises of God
[1:19:22] so take the book eat it and it will be
[1:19:25] sweet in your mouth but bitter in your
[1:19:27] belly and let me tell you the bitter
[1:19:30] part is the waiting part
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:35] it's easy to say by Stripes I'm Healed
[1:19:38] but when you still got the same symptoms
[1:19:40] it becomes bitter part
[1:19:43] but you know whether it be bitter or
[1:19:46] sweet it's gonna happen anyway because
[1:19:49] God said so
[1:19:52] by his stripes you are healed if you are
[1:19:55] sick tonight let me tell you Psalm 103 I
[1:20:00] am the god that healeth all thy diseases
[1:20:05] Hallelujah mental disease is physical
[1:20:08] diseases depression
[1:20:11] nervous Spirits we say in the name of
[1:20:14] Jesus be healed
[1:20:17] because the Bible says so Cancer all is
[1:20:21] included
[1:20:22] name it
[1:20:24] heart problems high blood pressure it's
[1:20:27] conquered in the name of Jesus
[1:20:31] but you know Satan comes around and now
[1:20:33] no doubt even tonight while I'm speaking
[1:20:36] he's saying who are you
[1:20:38] they said the same things about Jesus
[1:20:41] who give you the authority
[1:20:43] by which authority do you do these
[1:20:45] things
[1:20:47] it's quite interesting
[1:20:49] because we're waiting for an answer and
[1:20:51] and the devil will always put a question
[1:20:53] mark behind the word of God
[1:20:56] and you know Jesus never answered well I
[1:20:59] am the Son of God he always answered it
[1:21:01] is written
[1:21:04] I don't know about you we know we are a
[1:21:06] son of God
[1:21:07] we know you are a daughter of God we
[1:21:10] know where we stand
[1:21:12] Hallelujah the bride knows what he once
[1:21:15] done with the word
[1:21:16] Hallelujah nobody needs to explain us we
[1:21:19] have received a message
[1:21:22] Hallelujah we have no Pope to go through
[1:21:25] and ask well should we do this or that
[1:21:27] there's a message
[1:21:29] hallelujah it's all in there
[1:21:31] the answer is there Hallelujah
[1:21:38] but he has the same question
[1:21:41] if you are the Son of God even when he
[1:21:43] was hanging on the cross the thief on
[1:21:46] the left said if you are the Son of God
[1:21:48] you know the the Pharisees cried out if
[1:21:51] you are the Son of God come off the
[1:21:53] cross
[1:21:55] he could have done it
[1:21:58] actually he could have just nodded his
[1:22:00] head a little bit there were thousands
[1:22:03] of angels behind the bushes
[1:22:05] and he could just command one angel
[1:22:08] to get him off the cross but he didn't
[1:22:11] because he had a plan
[1:22:13] for you and I he had to conquer every
[1:22:16] enemy
[1:22:17] he had to conquer the sin question
[1:22:21] Hallelujah
[1:22:26] and when they asked him
[1:22:29] when they asked him by what Authority do
[1:22:31] you do these things he asked another
[1:22:33] question he said the baptism of John was
[1:22:35] it from heaven or from man
[1:22:39] and they couldn't answer it
[1:22:41] because both of the answers would get
[1:22:43] them stuck
[1:22:44] I like it when God asks questions
[1:22:47] he uses the technique of Satan against
[1:22:49] himself
[1:22:51] Hallelujah he takes a depressive spirit
[1:22:54] and makes the the enemy depressive
[1:22:57] Hallelujah
[1:22:58] [Applause]
[1:23:02] he takes that that the spirit of
[1:23:05] nervousness and he makes the devil
[1:23:07] nervous with it
[1:23:09] you know David when he conquered Goliath
[1:23:11] he took his own sword it wasn't David's
[1:23:15] sword
[1:23:16] I I challenge you tonight to challenge
[1:23:19] the devil and say I stand upon the word
[1:23:21] of God it's been conquered for me
[1:23:25] not by might not by power but by my
[1:23:28] spirit saith alone
[1:23:31] take all this Armory off me all this
[1:23:33] heavy stuff let me serve the Lord the
[1:23:36] way he created me
[1:23:39] let me worship him the way I want to
[1:23:41] worship Him
[1:23:45] Hallelujah
[1:23:46] but he always put that question mark and
[1:23:48] so Jesus said well if you can't answer
[1:23:51] it I'm not going to answer your question
[1:23:55] so listen closely we are not here to
[1:23:58] answer all the devil's foolish questions
[1:24:04] let's bring it down to one thing we are
[1:24:06] just to answer one question of the devil
[1:24:08] and the prophet calls it the sin
[1:24:11] question right
[1:24:13] and let me tell you Jesus has the answer
[1:24:16] Jesus is the answer
[1:24:19] I love what pulse has entitled 3 verse 9
[1:24:23] it says avoid foolish questions
[1:24:28] that's something for for pastors I
[1:24:30] believe
[1:24:40] that's something for all those critical
[1:24:42] websites you find against the prophet
[1:24:48] Hallelujah
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:57] don't spend your time even on it
[1:25:01] I tried to a few times and the Lord said
[1:25:03] this is not your food
[1:25:09] Hallelujah he go you know John went to
[1:25:12] the Angel and the only thing that the
[1:25:15] bride has to eat is this word of God
[1:25:18] you know on the internet people are so
[1:25:20] easily swayed you don't even know who is
[1:25:23] behind it you don't even know what what
[1:25:26] their purpose is you don't even know if
[1:25:29] they are Vindicated
[1:25:30] and then they're surely not leading you
[1:25:33] to Christ
[1:25:34] and listen closely
[1:25:36] the devil is the same in Europe as here
[1:25:39] Hallelujah
[1:25:41] but let me tell you the Lord Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:25:45] forever
[1:25:46] he's the same everywhere
[1:25:55] no matter what the enemy does
[1:25:58] I like this he says avoid foolish
[1:26:01] questions
[1:26:02] genealogies contentions strives about
[1:26:06] the law for they are unprofitable
[1:26:10] in vain
[1:26:14] listen you can't feed the bride manna
[1:26:16] from yesterday
[1:26:19] Hallelujah
[1:26:21] we need Manna From the presence of God
[1:26:24] in the Shekinah Glory Hallelujah we say
[1:26:28] Lord we need fresh manna from your
[1:26:30] presence even tonight
[1:26:32] you know my you might say it's still
[1:26:34] Mana but the Lord makes it fresh tonight
[1:26:37] Hallelujah
[1:26:40] but you know it's Satan's strategy to
[1:26:42] put a question mark and a lot of
[1:26:45] question marks who Do You Think You Are
[1:26:48] by what Authority do you do think this
[1:26:53] and and it's a strategy to keep his keep
[1:26:56] us busy with his foolish questions
[1:26:59] and and and finally he's he's just
[1:27:02] distracting us from reading the word
[1:27:05] from reading the Bible for from going
[1:27:08] into the promises taking them for us
[1:27:13] and you know what about that thing
[1:27:15] those people who are against the prophet
[1:27:17] it's typical the thing you find those
[1:27:20] critical websites and maybe somebody is
[1:27:22] struggling with it let me tell you I
[1:27:24] love you we love you
[1:27:27] but there's a there is a strong demonic
[1:27:30] power behind it it's a hatred against
[1:27:33] God not just brother Branham God
[1:27:37] let me tell you a little bit the first
[1:27:39] stage is oh we just want the Bible not
[1:27:41] brother Branham it's just a lie a few
[1:27:44] months after that give it a few months
[1:27:46] time and the whole Bible is Torn to
[1:27:48] Pieces because it's the same thing
[1:27:52] if if you are against the message he
[1:27:54] preached what Paul preached
[1:27:56] you you are against what Paul preached
[1:28:03] amen
[1:28:08] but Satan has succeeded to make so many
[1:28:12] people major on minors
[1:28:16] and the major thing is that we receive
[1:28:19] salvation for our souls
[1:28:22] and the prophet even says Divine Healing
[1:28:24] is not even a major but it's a promise
[1:28:27] of God
[1:28:28] but the major thing is that our souls
[1:28:30] are saved
[1:28:32] Hallelujah that we are born again that
[1:28:35] we know that our names are written in
[1:28:37] heaven
[1:28:39] but Satan binds so many people by his
[1:28:42] question marks and people who once were
[1:28:46] free now begin to lose thoughts of
[1:28:48] freedom
[1:28:49] and they lose their joy of the Salvation
[1:28:52] they lose their faith they once had but
[1:28:55] let me tell you there's always a way
[1:28:57] back
[1:28:58] amen
[1:29:01] Hallelujah and you know I've never seen
[1:29:04] anyone listen closely I've never seen
[1:29:07] anyone turn his back on this message and
[1:29:10] become a better Christian
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:17] [Applause]
[1:29:27] in fact that is quite the opposite
[1:29:31] they get wild in the things of the world
[1:29:34] most of I'm not saying everyone and
[1:29:36] listen I'm not judging tonight the Lord
[1:29:40] knows my heart I'm praying for many of
[1:29:42] those people
[1:29:43] because listen we shouldn't be lifted up
[1:29:45] in our hearts we are children of Abraham
[1:29:48] Abraham still kept praying for lot and
[1:29:51] his family he was still fighting and God
[1:29:55] help us to have the heart of Abraham Our
[1:29:57] Father
[1:29:58] let us not be lifted up and pride in the
[1:30:01] message and say we got it all and
[1:30:03] but let me tell you some people cross
[1:30:05] the line there is a line we can cross
[1:30:14] James says it like this James 1 14 he
[1:30:18] said but every man is tempted when he is
[1:30:20] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[1:30:23] and when lust had conceived it bringeth
[1:30:26] forth sin and sin when it is finished
[1:30:29] bringeth forth death
[1:30:32] so we know the Bible tells us that the
[1:30:36] enemy cometh but to kill steal and
[1:30:39] destroy so his agenda is death
[1:30:43] is it he's the The Pale Horse Rider and
[1:30:47] it's the ultimate anointing of death is
[1:30:51] in this age where we live
[1:30:54] he even wants to keep human beings from
[1:30:57] reproducing
[1:30:59] he mixes his genders up and everything
[1:31:01] his agenda is to stop and kill the human
[1:31:05] race
[1:31:08] but Jesus said I have come that they
[1:31:10] might have life and life more abundantly
[1:31:15] but now James Compares it with a natural
[1:31:18] conception this so it's he says it's the
[1:31:21] own lust so it's the carnal nature and
[1:31:25] and when it's had conceived it bringeth
[1:31:27] forth sin and the result of sin is death
[1:31:31] so that's his agenda he starts with a
[1:31:35] simple question mark but his strategy is
[1:31:39] to kill you
[1:31:40] his strategy is to kill your marriage
[1:31:43] his strategy is to to disperse your
[1:31:46] children
[1:31:48] but I'm so thankful
[1:31:50] Hallelujah
[1:31:52] there is a promise in the Bible in the
[1:31:54] last days I will pour out my spirit on
[1:31:57] All Flesh
[1:31:59] it doesn't matter which country which
[1:32:01] culture which color of skin which family
[1:32:04] which character
[1:32:07] Hallelujah and he says your sons and
[1:32:09] daughters will prophesy
[1:32:11] and I will pour out my spirit on my
[1:32:14] servants and my handmaids and I like
[1:32:16] this part even those that are far off
[1:32:22] I challenge you in this church I don't
[1:32:25] know I challenge you to think about the
[1:32:27] most impossible case
[1:32:30] people that you think it's hopeless let
[1:32:33] me tell you the promise of the holy
[1:32:35] spirit is for them
[1:32:37] for those that are far off
[1:32:39] Hallelujah
[1:32:48] he says he read the message
[1:32:50] he cares he says whether you strike a
[1:32:53] prayer line whatever it is that isn't it
[1:32:56] do you care
[1:32:58] cast your cares upon Him He careth for
[1:33:00] you be sincere about it you care enough
[1:33:04] to be sincere for he was he has proven
[1:33:07] by a Vindicated word that he cares he
[1:33:11] promised to send it he's done it he's
[1:33:13] promised and the word here it is he
[1:33:16] cares now what about you
[1:33:18] so can you see the spirit of God
[1:33:21] challenging challenging us just like
[1:33:24] John we know John is a type of the Bride
[1:33:26] he has to step forward now we have to
[1:33:29] make a move
[1:33:31] he says it's uh it's you ought to care
[1:33:34] next he cared enough to conquer every
[1:33:38] enemy for you
[1:33:42] that all you have to do is be sincere
[1:33:45] and believe it
[1:33:48] he conquered death
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:53] death ain't nothing for me to conquer
[1:33:56] it's already conquered
[1:33:59] sickness ain't for me to conquer it
[1:34:01] ain't for Christ to conquer it's already
[1:34:04] conquered
[1:34:05] I just have to care enough to believe us
[1:34:08] I say Lord tonight creating us a care
[1:34:13] are you afraid of what somebody else has
[1:34:15] told you
[1:34:16] are you afraid of the doctor's diagnosis
[1:34:19] are you afraid of what the church might
[1:34:21] say to you are you afraid to stand there
[1:34:24] Toe to Toe with the Devil
[1:34:27] say I have confessed my sins I've laid
[1:34:30] aside everything I believed every word
[1:34:33] Here I Am Lord
[1:34:35] created me a care
[1:34:41] how many remember that vision of brother
[1:34:43] Branham at the end of his life in the
[1:34:46] message on the wings of a snow white
[1:34:48] dove
[1:34:49] where that squirrel hit that big Cactus
[1:34:52] and it and it was totally killed in that
[1:34:55] Vision a black squirrel and it
[1:34:57] represented the sickness in his stomach
[1:34:59] that he was struggling for such a long
[1:35:02] time
[1:35:04] and the word he received is your enemy
[1:35:06] is dead
[1:35:09] and that of the end of the service he
[1:35:11] starts singing that song on the wings of
[1:35:14] a snow white dove
[1:35:17] let me tell you tonight your enemy is
[1:35:20] dead
[1:35:22] or you might say I just heard him speak
[1:35:24] and Whisper let me tell you Christ
[1:35:26] conquered him at the cross
[1:35:29] he said it is finished and he has done
[1:35:32] everything he's done away with the sin
[1:35:34] problem the sin question he conquered it
[1:35:37] at Calvary
[1:35:39] he uses another example here in Jehovah
[1:35:42] Jireh part two he says if a great dragon
[1:35:45] or an animal like a lion has a spaw
[1:35:48] hooked in my side that was a tumor or a
[1:35:53] cancer trying to kill me as he says
[1:35:56] there's no need of just trying just to
[1:35:58] cut his foot off or Divine Healing
[1:36:01] if you just knock them in the head it
[1:36:04] kills the whole thing
[1:36:06] I love this tonight
[1:36:09] and when Jesus died for sins he died for
[1:36:13] every attribute that sin ever produced
[1:36:18] so when sin was finished it was all
[1:36:21] finished the complete Plan of Redemption
[1:36:24] if you just knock him in the head with a
[1:36:28] sin question kill sin you kill every
[1:36:32] attribute of it
[1:36:35] that's that's powerful stuff tonight
[1:36:38] Hallelujah
[1:36:40] what is sin unbelief so when you kill
[1:36:42] all unbelieve why you know that God's
[1:36:46] words right he's the same yesterday
[1:36:49] today and forever so all the promises
[1:36:52] are yours
[1:36:54] walk through the land
[1:36:56] it's all yours it belongs to you
[1:37:00] just enjoy it it's yours God gave it to
[1:37:04] you the grace of God gave it to you
[1:37:07] it's all yours
[1:37:09] when the sin questions over
[1:37:12] he says you've received the Holy Ghost
[1:37:14] and everything you have need of in this
[1:37:18] life journey is right here in the Bible
[1:37:21] for you everything you have need of
[1:37:25] Hallelujah the Bible says it and God
[1:37:28] brings with the tribulation with the
[1:37:30] Temptation he brings the way out
[1:37:33] Hallelujah just before you even had the
[1:37:36] problem God already had the solution
[1:37:41] hallelujah it's no longer struggling the
[1:37:43] solution was before the problem
[1:37:46] Hallelujah the lamb was slain before the
[1:37:49] foundation of the world
[1:37:50] before sin ever came he was the lamb
[1:37:54] slain
[1:37:55] and he conquered death
[1:37:58] so it's not up to us to be struggling
[1:38:00] and wandering and putting question marks
[1:38:03] and all these things we know we have a
[1:38:06] defeated enemy tonight
[1:38:09] Hallelujah
[1:38:13] if we can just
[1:38:15] solve the sin question Hallelujah
[1:38:20] in Christ answer that question for us
[1:38:26] remember that Vision in the message
[1:38:28] Paradox of that great mamba snake
[1:38:33] and and brother random sees a brother of
[1:38:36] his that is jumping away and and people
[1:38:38] there's a kind of there's a fear that
[1:38:41] grips the church and and and because of
[1:38:44] that Mamba and and he could sense it in
[1:38:46] a vision and there's so many dangerous
[1:38:49] things these days so here's these things
[1:38:51] and he says and we know he explains this
[1:38:55] mamba snake represents death
[1:38:59] it's instant death when it hits you you
[1:39:01] we know it's it's the first snake and
[1:39:04] it's so aggressive that it often just
[1:39:06] hits the victims just right in the face
[1:39:11] and so he he knows that that it's death
[1:39:15] representing death which is is the real
[1:39:18] Sin question it's the result of sin and
[1:39:21] and it's it's the scheme it's the plan
[1:39:23] of Satan
[1:39:25] and and here is brother brennaman and
[1:39:27] the vision the voice says whatever you
[1:39:29] bind you've been given power to bind him
[1:39:33] and to unbind him so it's not the Lord
[1:39:37] saying well I'm cursing the enemy but he
[1:39:40] wants you and I to speak that word and
[1:39:43] he has given the church the authority to
[1:39:46] do so
[1:39:47] he said in my name you shall cast out
[1:39:50] demons in my name you shall lay hands on
[1:39:53] the sick and they shall recover
[1:39:59] but that same voice said you've also
[1:40:02] been given to unbind him
[1:40:05] you you might start confessing faith and
[1:40:08] you bind that enemy in your life but as
[1:40:12] soon as you start a negative confession
[1:40:14] you revive the enemy you revive that
[1:40:18] sickness or that problem and you're not
[1:40:20] alive
[1:40:21] amen that's that's what I understand
[1:40:23] maybe it's it's very simple but really
[1:40:26] that's how simple it is but we struggle
[1:40:29] with it
[1:40:32] because he puts his question mark well
[1:40:34] I've been anointed I've been brother on
[1:40:37] prayed for me and anointed me with all
[1:40:39] the brothers prayed for me and I thought
[1:40:42] I had my healing but a few days later
[1:40:46] the the enemy comes and listen you
[1:40:49] expect him to put question marks
[1:40:53] when you're filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:40:54] I always tell people just enjoy the time
[1:40:58] it's like a parachute in the air just
[1:41:01] enjoy the time but be careful before you
[1:41:04] know you'll land on your feet and the
[1:41:07] battle starts
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:13] so it doesn't it's not the end station
[1:41:15] it only starts there the baptism of the
[1:41:18] Holy Spirit
[1:41:21] you know every enemy will stand against
[1:41:23] you and and it the prophet makes a
[1:41:27] astounding statement he he says on the
[1:41:29] day of Pentecost he said there were
[1:41:32] three thousand Souls saved you know the
[1:41:34] quote and the devil didn't even come out
[1:41:37] of his bed
[1:41:40] but when they came at the gate beautiful
[1:41:42] and one man was supernaturally healed
[1:41:45] every demon in hell was against the
[1:41:48] church if you start to believe a god
[1:41:50] that is the same yesterday today and
[1:41:52] forever let me tell you every arrow of
[1:41:56] the enemy will be pointed against you
[1:42:00] he will anoint people to criticize you
[1:42:03] he will speak directly in your mind
[1:42:06] don't think like ministers have to
[1:42:08] struggle with this in the Pulpit also
[1:42:12] who Do You Think You Are
[1:42:15] let me tell you tonight it is written
[1:42:18] Hallelujah they overcame him by the
[1:42:20] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:42:23] their testimony that's you and I tonight
[1:42:28] Hallelujah
[1:42:30] and then we know when he came out of the
[1:42:33] vision he he asked the Lord to be more
[1:42:35] sincere and I believe that's what we all
[1:42:37] should be praying for
[1:42:40] I've prayed that prayer so many times I
[1:42:42] prayed it this afternoon I lifted up my
[1:42:45] hands said Lord make me more sincere
[1:42:50] and I think that's the prayer we should
[1:42:52] all pray all the time
[1:42:54] Paul speaks these things and and he says
[1:42:56] let's not come again with an unleavened
[1:42:58] bread of of malice and and strive but
[1:43:03] let's come with the unleavened bread of
[1:43:05] sincerity and Truth
[1:43:08] you know the angel was always scriptural
[1:43:10] he referred to that text when he came
[1:43:12] out of the vision
[1:43:17] let me read you what the prophet says
[1:43:19] here in the resume of the ages
[1:43:22] he says this age started after the turn
[1:43:25] of the 20th century
[1:43:28] as it was to the to be the age in which
[1:43:30] the true church would return to being
[1:43:32] the bride she was at Pentecost we know
[1:43:35] that there must of necessity be a return
[1:43:38] of dynamic power
[1:43:41] amen you believe that tonight
[1:43:43] he said the Believers sensed in their
[1:43:45] spirits and sense this in their spirits
[1:43:48] and begin crying for God for a new
[1:43:50] outpouring such as was in the first
[1:43:53] century
[1:43:54] and he says here this statement what
[1:43:56] seemed to be the answer
[1:44:00] so we're speaking about
[1:44:02] that tonight
[1:44:06] the long-awaited answer
[1:44:08] what seemed to be the answer came as
[1:44:10] many began to speak in tongues and
[1:44:13] manifest the gifts of the Spirit it was
[1:44:16] then believed it was indeed the long
[1:44:18] awaited restoration it was not
[1:44:22] for the latter rain can only come after
[1:44:25] the former rain which is a spring or
[1:44:28] teaching rain
[1:44:30] the letter Reign then is the Harvest
[1:44:32] rain and later on he says it is Faith
[1:44:34] for the rapture
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:39] how many believe that the Lord promised
[1:44:41] in so many Bible texts that those two
[1:44:43] will fall together in the last time
[1:44:46] and it's a very difficult balance for
[1:44:49] every church for every Ministry
[1:44:52] to keep that balance with between
[1:44:54] teaching and preaching between teaching
[1:44:57] the Bible and preaching a supernatural
[1:45:00] God
[1:45:01] Hallelujah and the prophet says the the
[1:45:04] bride you have the fundamentalist on one
[1:45:07] side and the Fanatics on the other side
[1:45:09] and he says the bride walks in the
[1:45:11] middle and she draws from both sides
[1:45:16] but let me tell you I don't know about
[1:45:18] you at least for me it's a very
[1:45:20] difficult balance
[1:45:24] but we shouldn't be afraid
[1:45:27] the holy spirit is here to guide us
[1:45:31] Hallelujah
[1:45:33] he says here I'm talking about in Christ
[1:45:35] it's a mystery I'm talking about the
[1:45:37] headship of Christ not as being
[1:45:40] personally identified by the original
[1:45:42] headship we have the answer to the
[1:45:46] devil's question Hallelujah
[1:45:49] he repeats us we have the answer to the
[1:45:52] devil's question
[1:45:54] he Christ is risen and he paid a prize
[1:45:58] raising up the head of the body the
[1:46:01] devil cannot stand it
[1:46:03] right that's the reason this
[1:46:04] eucharenical kingdoms are setting up
[1:46:06] that's the reason they're all coming
[1:46:09] into what they're doing now he says the
[1:46:11] devil that's the reason he's howling the
[1:46:15] way he is
[1:46:18] so don't be worried when you hear
[1:46:20] howling on the internet
[1:46:23] don't be worried when you hear maybe
[1:46:25] howling on the job or whatever
[1:46:28] man that's right did you know Paul said
[1:46:31] this expression in the way that's called
[1:46:33] heresy I worship the god of my fathers
[1:46:38] there is a name tag to it when you start
[1:46:40] to believe a supernatural God
[1:46:45] but you know what
[1:46:46] we are not ashamed of the Gospel of
[1:46:48] Jesus Christ
[1:46:50] amen we are not ashamed of the Holy
[1:46:53] Spirit
[1:46:55] we are not ashamed of the promises of
[1:46:57] God
[1:46:59] he says again we have the devils
[1:47:01] answer
[1:47:04] it's not me that liveth but Christ the
[1:47:06] word living in me it's not my idea it's
[1:47:09] his power it's not my idea it's his word
[1:47:12] he promised that here it is
[1:47:15] he said it would be here and here it is
[1:47:20] listen it's not something to come it is
[1:47:22] here that's what the prophet says
[1:47:24] Christ is risen and has paid the price
[1:47:28] for our Redemption
[1:47:31] we have Satan's answer God has
[1:47:35] Vindicated himself God proves himself to
[1:47:39] his promise in this day the headship is
[1:47:42] here
[1:47:44] Christ the Risen Lord is here in the
[1:47:46] same power of his resurrection that he
[1:47:49] ever was
[1:47:51] manifesting himself
[1:47:54] there's the devil's and
[1:48:09] you know when Jesus met the enemy there
[1:48:11] in the desert as we said
[1:48:15] he conquered and the prophet takes first
[1:48:18] John 2 verse 16. he says all that is in
[1:48:21] the world is the lust of the eye the
[1:48:24] lust of the Flesh of the Flesh and the
[1:48:26] pride of life you can actually this is
[1:48:29] the root of all sin
[1:48:31] and and the Prophet The Prophet comes
[1:48:34] and he takes takes the three Temptations
[1:48:36] in the wilderness and first John 2 and
[1:48:40] he overlaps them and he says it's the
[1:48:42] same thing Christ has conquered the
[1:48:44] three things for you
[1:48:46] is that wonderful and so he didn't
[1:48:49] defeat Satan on with his power with his
[1:48:52] authority but on the word of God and I
[1:48:55] like this expression somewhere the
[1:48:57] prophet says he hit like a 10 000 volt
[1:49:01] cable
[1:49:02] and then another place he says that kind
[1:49:05] of singed his feathers
[1:49:08] but let me tell you tonight you are
[1:49:11] conductors of the Holy Spirit
[1:49:14] and I'm praying tonight we can say Lord
[1:49:16] connect me to that ten thousand fold
[1:49:19] line
[1:49:21] whenever the enemy comes connect me to
[1:49:23] that ten thousand fold line
[1:49:25] God commissioned you to sing to the
[1:49:28] enemy's feathers
[1:49:30] Hallelujah that's powerful
[1:49:37] Hallelujah
[1:49:38] you see the thief on the left he kept on
[1:49:41] he was anointed to ask that question
[1:49:44] mark if you are the Son of God but the
[1:49:46] thief on the right he said I this I I
[1:49:49] receive what I deserve but this man has
[1:49:52] done nothing
[1:49:55] and he said Lord remember me
[1:49:58] isn't that wonderful
[1:50:01] and he said today thou shall be in
[1:50:03] Paradise With Me
[1:50:05] what an answer
[1:50:07] here is a thief and a rubber he done
[1:50:10] everything his whole life he didn't
[1:50:12] deserve to go to heaven to Paradise
[1:50:15] and one simple answer
[1:50:18] we were that Thief
[1:50:21] Hallelujah
[1:50:23] if there's somebody in sin if you are
[1:50:25] that one let me tell you it doesn't take
[1:50:27] hours of theology it doesn't take weeks
[1:50:30] months of study just a few minutes in
[1:50:33] his presence
[1:50:34] and if you will just recognize this man
[1:50:37] hasn't done nothing I am the one who
[1:50:39] deserves to die
[1:50:41] Remember Me Lord tonight
[1:50:47] Hallelujah he will speak that
[1:50:50] long-awaited answer
[1:50:54] he says again here in my angels shall go
[1:50:58] before thee and when you can hit Satan
[1:51:00] with a scripture he's just as powerless
[1:51:03] as he can be
[1:51:05] Hallelujah
[1:51:07] so we see the question mark of Satan is
[1:51:09] really this it's unbelief in God's word
[1:51:12] he he brings doubt he brings frustration
[1:51:16] he brings question marks
[1:51:19] and and I know if we go to the Bible we
[1:51:23] see here we are in a week after the
[1:51:25] resurrection and think about cleopas and
[1:51:28] his friend going to Emmaus and the Bible
[1:51:31] said they were reasoning they were
[1:51:33] talking to each other communing they
[1:51:36] were asking the questions but they had
[1:51:38] no answer
[1:51:41] and this is powerful while they are
[1:51:44] asking the question Jesus joined himself
[1:51:47] with them
[1:51:48] Hallelujah so here they are in their
[1:51:51] Earthly thinking and they and and the
[1:51:54] Lord asked them why is you why are you
[1:51:56] so sad where is your countenance set as
[1:51:58] if we didn't know
[1:52:00] but I love it when he asks questions
[1:52:06] but he wants to make them think
[1:52:09] there's no reason to be said
[1:52:12] Jesus had just died and rose again
[1:52:15] there's an empty grave
[1:52:18] but they didn't catch it and the Bible
[1:52:20] says their eyes will hold and they
[1:52:22] couldn't see him
[1:52:25] and here he goes back to Psalm 22 and
[1:52:28] Jeremiah 12 and all the text the prophet
[1:52:31] describes it so beautifully and he he
[1:52:35] didn't say show a miracle and whatever
[1:52:37] but he went back to what the scripture
[1:52:40] said about himself didn't the prophet
[1:52:42] say this would happen didn't Isaiah said
[1:52:45] this would happen
[1:52:48] and I fear so many times that we in our
[1:52:51] lives that we we we start to lose our
[1:52:55] faith because we try to answer the
[1:52:58] questions of the devil and we we wonder
[1:53:00] why is this happening we we never
[1:53:02] expected this to happen
[1:53:04] and we've forgotten all along Jesus was
[1:53:07] walking with us
[1:53:09] and it was just being patient and
[1:53:11] preaching to you service after service
[1:53:13] and using another Ministry and and here
[1:53:17] comes another Ministry ether and he's
[1:53:19] trying to catch your attention
[1:53:24] but let me tell you somewhere in the
[1:53:27] middle of a CERN
[1:53:28] suddenly you recognized by the breaking
[1:53:31] of the bread
[1:53:32] it's Jesus it's always been Jesus
[1:53:36] he's always been there
[1:53:38] in my deepest moment
[1:53:41] even when I doubted when I didn't
[1:53:42] deserve the answer he was there with me
[1:53:46] you know cleopas and he could have gone
[1:53:48] elsewhere but he'll so loved them
[1:53:51] that and he took his time
[1:53:55] Hallelujah
[1:53:57] and and you know it's exact parallel
[1:53:59] with
[1:54:00] laodicea he says specifically about this
[1:54:03] age
[1:54:04] I stand at the door and I knock
[1:54:06] if anyone will hear my voice and open
[1:54:11] the door
[1:54:12] I will sup with him and he with me
[1:54:15] so that's exactly what happened there
[1:54:16] with cleopas and his friend
[1:54:21] foreign
[1:54:24] to brother run yesterday evening a
[1:54:27] testimony and I won't go into the
[1:54:29] details but I was at the one of the
[1:54:32] deepest crisis in my life
[1:54:36] in the ministry I was so hurt and
[1:54:39] disappointed and
[1:54:42] broken under the criticism and all the
[1:54:44] things that went on
[1:54:46] and let me tell you we were in the midst
[1:54:48] of a conversation with the pastor and
[1:54:51] the Deacons
[1:54:52] and some were in the middle of that
[1:54:54] conversation
[1:54:57] brother Biscoe had preached on the
[1:54:58] convention in the morning on cleopas and
[1:55:00] the title was he went with them
[1:55:03] and we refer to that sermon
[1:55:07] and
[1:55:10] going back to the world we were asking
[1:55:12] questions about the future of our church
[1:55:14] and what's going to happen though
[1:55:17] and all these things just like cleopas
[1:55:19] and his friends
[1:55:21] and at some point I just lifted up my
[1:55:23] hand my finger like this and I said he's
[1:55:25] still with us
[1:55:27] and God is my witness as soon as I said
[1:55:30] that the ceiling of the room broke open
[1:55:34] with the power of God
[1:55:37] and we fell on our faces
[1:55:40] the five of us we started worshiping God
[1:55:44] we wept before God and all we could say
[1:55:47] when we stood up as brother I love you
[1:55:49] brother I love you
[1:55:51] and when I stood up
[1:55:53] all the pain all the hurt all the
[1:55:56] negative thoughts had left me
[1:56:00] see it doesn't take a long time just a
[1:56:02] few minutes in his presence
[1:56:08] do you realize he's here tonight
[1:56:12] and I pray for our eyes are Holden may
[1:56:15] the Lord open our eyes
[1:56:18] at the breaking of the bread
[1:56:23] I'm saying Ruth like Ruth and Boaz in
[1:56:26] the Bible
[1:56:27] where are you are you still deciding
[1:56:34] Elijah said this to the people of
[1:56:37] his day he said why do you hold between
[1:56:39] two opinions
[1:56:42] he says let the god that answers by fire
[1:56:45] be God
[1:56:50] I'm saying tonight let the god that
[1:56:52] answer with fire
[1:56:54] be God
[1:56:57] you might have your altar
[1:57:00] you might have all the pieces of wood
[1:57:03] you might even have your sacrifice
[1:57:05] but it's all in vain
[1:57:08] if there's no fire to consume it
[1:57:16] I say Lord consume My Sacrifice tonight
[1:57:21] give us an answer from heaven
[1:57:25] saying Ruth are you still deciding
[1:57:29] we know all the stages Ruth deciding
[1:57:31] Roots Ruth serving Ruth resting and
[1:57:35] finally Ruth rewarded wherever you are
[1:57:38] in this stage
[1:57:40] I'm saying to you advance go on
[1:57:44] like like the Lord said to Job sitting
[1:57:47] on the ash Heap
[1:57:49] and one day the Lord said stand up and
[1:57:52] girth thyself as a man I want to speak
[1:57:55] to you
[1:57:56] answer me where were you when I lay the
[1:58:00] foundations of the world
[1:58:01] when the sons of God shouted for Joys
[1:58:04] and the Stars shouted for
[1:58:07] gladness
[1:58:10] if you only realize the Lord wants to
[1:58:12] bring Ruth through all the stages to the
[1:58:15] point where it's no more laboring no
[1:58:19] more gleaning no more me trying to
[1:58:21] overcome sin no more coming back
[1:58:25] receiving forgiveness falling back into
[1:58:28] sin but God wants to bring you to a
[1:58:30] place where he's your husband
[1:58:33] it all belongs to you you don't have to
[1:58:36] take the crumbles from the table anymore
[1:58:38] but he you can sit at the table
[1:58:41] Hallelujah he's inviting you to sit at
[1:58:44] the table tonight
[1:58:45] he wants to talk with you for a little
[1:58:47] while he wants to break the bread of
[1:58:50] life and say I've been with you always
[1:58:53] I've been there in The Darkest Hour
[1:58:58] David said if I make my bed in hell Thou
[1:59:01] Art there
[1:59:06] laughs
[1:59:09] he's always been faithful
[1:59:13] I said Lord forgive me I've doubted you
[1:59:16] so many times
[1:59:19] I've listened so many times to the enemy
[1:59:24] renew the joy of our Salvation tonight
[1:59:28] create the right spirit in US
[1:59:34] where were you job
[1:59:36] when I laid the foundation
[1:59:40] you see here where the apostles in the
[1:59:43] upper room and
[1:59:44] one moment they were all Renegades
[1:59:47] fugitives running from their own Shadows
[1:59:51] and the next stage it just bumped the
[1:59:53] doors open and started to sing and shout
[1:59:56] and praise God
[1:59:58] Hallelujah and the people in the street
[1:59:59] could hear them praise God in their
[2:00:01] language
[2:00:03] Hallelujah let me tell you Peter and
[2:00:06] John they knew who they were
[2:00:09] they knew what we had what they had
[2:00:11] Hallelujah that's exactly what they said
[2:00:13] Silver and Gold Have I known but such as
[2:00:16] I have I give unto you
[2:00:19] we have something to give tonight
[2:00:22] you know you can apply that same
[2:00:24] salvation to your loved ones
[2:00:26] Hallelujah and here is the prophet and
[2:00:28] he says the Greater Works is imparting
[2:00:32] eternal life
[2:00:33] Hallelujah he wants to use you to bring
[2:00:36] someone to Christ he wants to use you
[2:00:39] for your children to get saved and
[2:00:41] filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:00:46] you know what a few weeks ago I knelt in
[2:00:50] every room of my children at the bed
[2:00:53] and I'm praying and believing for them
[2:00:56] I'm I know he will do it brother sister
[2:00:59] because it's a promise for your sons and
[2:01:02] your daughters
[2:01:03] you you you might say he's way back he's
[2:01:07] is drinking he's in the sins of the
[2:01:09] world let me tell you it's a promise for
[2:01:12] your sons and daughters
[2:01:13] for them that are far off we have a
[2:01:16] little niece that is endured and living
[2:01:19] together with a man and it's the most
[2:01:21] impossible situation but let me tell you
[2:01:24] we keep on claiming the blood of Jesus
[2:01:27] Christ
[2:01:29] I'm not ashamed to stand in front of my
[2:01:32] church
[2:01:33] and say I believe for her
[2:01:36] We Believe for the bexleyden brothers
[2:01:39] and sisters
[2:01:45] Hallelujah
[2:01:48] there's a beautiful expression that the
[2:01:49] prophet uses many times and he says
[2:01:51] don't worry it'll be there
[2:01:55] so simple but so real don't worry
[2:01:58] brother it'll be there
[2:02:01] the long-awaited answer it'll be there
[2:02:05] he hasn't forgotten you brother sister
[2:02:09] he knows every tear you cried
[2:02:12] he has heard every prayer listen Daniel
[2:02:17] the Lord the angel that came to him he
[2:02:20] was fighting a battle to come through
[2:02:22] but he said these words from the first
[2:02:25] day that you set your heart to believe
[2:02:28] even before he prayed all of his prayers
[2:02:31] from the first day I was sent from the
[2:02:34] presence of God
[2:02:38] mentioned angels and demons are fighting
[2:02:41] each other
[2:02:44] let me tell you your answer is on the
[2:02:47] way
[2:02:48] it might take a little waiting and let
[2:02:51] me tell you God knows exactly the second
[2:02:54] and the minute you will receive it
[2:03:00] you know when Satan tempted job it said
[2:03:03] he came back from running to and fro
[2:03:06] over the Earth
[2:03:07] but our Lord doesn't have to run to and
[2:03:09] fro
[2:03:10] Hallelujah
[2:03:12] it's amazing but he he can be
[2:03:15] omnipresent he can be everywhere at the
[2:03:18] same time he can be in Belgium and here
[2:03:21] in Elkton at the same time and he is
[2:03:24] it's not he can be he is he is ever
[2:03:27] present water from The Rock he is the
[2:03:29] omnipotent all power he is the
[2:03:32] omniscient he knows all things
[2:03:35] imagine the the the the intelligence of
[2:03:38] our God he can hear all those millions
[2:03:42] of prayers
[2:03:44] and he solves every one of them he hears
[2:03:47] every one of them no tear falls to the
[2:03:50] ground no hair of your head falls to the
[2:03:53] ground without him knowing there's no
[2:03:55] sparrow that falls to the ground without
[2:03:57] him knowing
[2:03:59] but he says you are so much more
[2:04:01] precious than a sparrow
[2:04:04] there's not even a gnat that can blink
[2:04:06] his eye without him knowing
[2:04:11] so when we pray to God for healing for
[2:04:14] the holy spirit is it is not that we are
[2:04:17] in are informing the Lord
[2:04:20] we don't have to he has no need for
[2:04:22] information he just wants us to believe
[2:04:26] amen
[2:04:28] so we don't have to give a whole
[2:04:30] description of all the details he knows
[2:04:32] already but he says ask pray knock and
[2:04:36] it shall be given to you it shall be
[2:04:38] open to you
[2:04:43] isn't that wonderful
[2:04:46] the answer is on the way
[2:04:52] and Satan said over and over again
[2:04:55] if you take away the Hedge the
[2:04:57] protection if you allow them to get sick
[2:05:01] you know Satan cannot touch your life
[2:05:03] the least hair without asking permission
[2:05:06] to the Lord
[2:05:08] and when the Lord says okay you can go
[2:05:10] he knows already you will make it
[2:05:14] he has so much trust and confidence in
[2:05:17] you that he says go ahead
[2:05:19] and Satan with his false prophecy said
[2:05:22] well
[2:05:23] if you take away the Hedge he will curse
[2:05:25] you to your face
[2:05:28] and job did exactly the opposite
[2:05:31] he worshiped the Lord and he did not sin
[2:05:34] in one of his words even to his wife he
[2:05:37] didn't say you are a foolish woman he
[2:05:40] said you speak like a foolish woman
[2:05:43] isn't that a testimony
[2:05:48] so God had to come down
[2:05:58] this is one of my favorites
[2:06:02] I'm trying to find here
[2:06:13] I'm gonna say it by heart but you can
[2:06:15] look it up by and in the message
[2:06:19] he says it it took a long time for the
[2:06:22] Hebrew children
[2:06:25] I I hope I quote it right
[2:06:31] here in the message I've heard but now I
[2:06:33] see
[2:06:34] he said we find in those hours of real
[2:06:37] stress how many people has gone through
[2:06:40] those things hours of real stress
[2:06:42] amen
[2:06:44] many times
[2:06:46] he says that's usually when the spirit
[2:06:48] of God Moves In
[2:06:51] isn't that powerful
[2:06:53] you think it's so negative I'm under
[2:06:55] pressure he says that's usually
[2:06:58] when the spirit of God Moves In
[2:07:01] he said he let the Hebrew children walk
[2:07:03] right into the fiery furnace before he
[2:07:07] ever moved a hand
[2:07:11] listen to what he says here
[2:07:14] but when he moves
[2:07:16] he moves
[2:07:18] when he moves he moves
[2:07:22] he brings in the helicopters the jet
[2:07:24] planes he brings he brings us Angels he
[2:07:27] brings the power of the Holy Spirit
[2:07:29] Hallelujah he brings the blood to
[2:07:31] forgive your sin when he moves he moves
[2:07:33] he's a supernatural God
[2:07:37] so I encourage you tonight even if the
[2:07:40] vision parries Hallelujah if you have to
[2:07:42] wait it will not tarry it will come
[2:07:45] and let me say your light has come
[2:07:48] Hallelujah it has come he has conquered
[2:07:51] every enemy
[2:07:53] Hallelujah he has conquered death and
[2:07:56] that snake is not only death but
[2:07:58] everything below it cancer depression
[2:08:01] nervousness Hallelujah worldlyism
[2:08:05] Hallelujah
[2:08:06] cigarettes in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:08:10] they have to go he conquered it for you
[2:08:12] but I tried Brother David Ruth you're
[2:08:15] still gleaning
[2:08:16] you have to come to the place where you
[2:08:18] are resting in the promises of God
[2:08:21] and he will reward you
[2:08:23] Hallelujah
[2:08:30] let me tell you the answer is not just
[2:08:32] on the way
[2:08:34] he was with you all the time
[2:08:36] as the song says he was there
[2:08:39] all the time
[2:08:43] Jesus cried at the cross it is finished
[2:08:47] and you can see the same
[2:08:49] statement in the Book of Revelation it
[2:08:52] is done
[2:08:53] it is done
[2:08:55] everything God needed to do is done
[2:09:00] all we can do is say Lord yes I believe
[2:09:02] I believe it's for me I believe the holy
[2:09:06] spirit is for me
[2:09:08] so let me tell you there's no more
[2:09:10] excuses
[2:09:11] there's no more excuses there's no more
[2:09:13] ignorance we have received the message
[2:09:16] Satan's plans have been exposed
[2:09:21] and Paul says it like this we are not
[2:09:23] ignorant of Satan's devices God has sent
[2:09:27] us and and we know Revelation exposes
[2:09:30] Satan it exposes that Antichrist spirit
[2:09:34] that comes within the framework of the
[2:09:37] church and by God's power we can
[2:09:41] withstand discern and withstand that
[2:09:43] spirit
[2:09:44] and and I always say to the church let's
[2:09:46] start in our own lives to discern it we
[2:09:49] are so quick to point fingers say Lord
[2:09:51] maybe I'm under the wrong spirit
[2:09:54] maybe I think negative amen
[2:10:01] so we are not sent to answer
[2:10:04] the devil's questions but the question
[2:10:06] the sin question and let me tell you the
[2:10:10] answer has come God has opened a book he
[2:10:14] has loosened the seals and the prophet
[2:10:17] says it like this he tore the seals of
[2:10:19] of himself
[2:10:22] and he calls the Bible a new book you
[2:10:25] might say it's the same words but let me
[2:10:27] tell you too the bride of Christ it is
[2:10:30] our marriage certificate
[2:10:34] Boaz is your husband it says we are
[2:10:37] married no longer gleaning no longer me
[2:10:40] trying to overcome alcohol no longer me
[2:10:44] trying to overcome lust the Holy Spirit
[2:10:46] has already conquered it for you it only
[2:10:50] has to become a reality to you I cannot
[2:10:53] overcome my own flesh I need Christ
[2:10:57] Hallelujah I need to cross
[2:11:00] I need the blood of a perfect lamb to
[2:11:02] wash my sins away
[2:11:04] I'm not pointing to myself I'm pointing
[2:11:07] to the Lamb of God he is perfect
[2:11:13] Hallelujah
[2:11:15] let me find a place
[2:11:18] to finish this off tonight
[2:11:22] God bless you you're drawing so
[2:11:24] wonderfully may the Lord bless you
[2:11:29] this is one of my favorite
[2:11:31] stories or
[2:11:33] events that the prophet said you
[2:11:35] remember the story when a car salesman
[2:11:38] uh wanted to find
[2:11:41] whether he had the holy ghost or not
[2:11:44] and he grabs in his pocket and he finds
[2:11:47] a little note and here is a sinner A
[2:11:50] ranked Sinner and he finds a note and it
[2:11:52] says where will you spend eternity
[2:11:56] and it so strikes him and and the
[2:11:58] prophet tells the whole story he goes to
[2:12:00] all the the big preachers all the big
[2:12:03] names and Billy Graham and Oral Roberts
[2:12:06] and and he shouted and he jumped and he
[2:12:09] did all those things and he and he comes
[2:12:12] to the prophet and he says but I still
[2:12:15] I'm still looking for it
[2:12:20] and here is the prophet and he said
[2:12:22] and he takes that man and he sits down
[2:12:24] and he says
[2:12:26] you don't need even need a prophet to
[2:12:28] straighten you out you just need the
[2:12:30] word of God
[2:12:33] and he said what Mr Graham told you is
[2:12:35] the truth the Nazarene what they told
[2:12:38] you is the truth the Pentecostal is the
[2:12:40] truth and yet he says it's not the truth
[2:12:44] he says to shout to raise up your hands
[2:12:47] to speak with tongues is not receiving
[2:12:50] Christ
[2:12:52] amen but we do believe in those things
[2:12:55] they are gifts
[2:12:56] they are Gifts of Jesus Christ but it is
[2:12:59] not receive in Christ
[2:13:01] amen so he's explaining this man and he
[2:13:05] says receiving Christ is receiving the
[2:13:08] person
[2:13:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:13:13] and then he says these other things take
[2:13:15] place after that he said you could do
[2:13:18] all those things and still didn't have
[2:13:21] Christ yet and he says well brother
[2:13:23] Branham where can I find him he said I
[2:13:27] want to ask you something let's go back
[2:13:29] to your story and he walked up he said
[2:13:31] well what you what do you mean
[2:13:33] well you said that day when you come in
[2:13:36] picked up that piece of paper something
[2:13:39] struck you and you said oh I want to see
[2:13:42] God is he said from up to that time you
[2:13:47] were going this way down the road and
[2:13:49] you turned this way what did it what
[2:13:52] changed your opinion what come into your
[2:13:55] heart
[2:13:56] that made you one time not care for God
[2:13:59] and something come in to make you go to
[2:14:02] loving God
[2:14:05] what done it he said well I don't know
[2:14:08] he's still blind to the answer
[2:14:12] Hallelujah
[2:14:17] he said before there could be a creation
[2:14:20] there had to be a Creator to create that
[2:14:23] creation
[2:14:24] God came into your heart right there
[2:14:29] when you looked at that piece of paper
[2:14:33] he said you mean I've had it all along
[2:14:37] I said certainly brother
[2:14:39] and he jumped out of there and began to
[2:14:42] scream and cry that's the time to scream
[2:14:45] and cry
[2:14:47] laughs
[2:14:50] that was settled what is it he said do
[2:14:52] you want to pray for me brother Bradham
[2:14:54] he said what's the use of praying for
[2:14:56] you you don't need any prayer the truth
[2:14:59] has set you free
[2:15:01] Hallelujah so it's the correct answer
[2:15:05] it's the right answer that liberated
[2:15:07] this man imagine someone receiving the
[2:15:12] New Birth the Holy Spirit by reading a
[2:15:15] note
[2:15:17] that's a whole different dimension isn't
[2:15:19] it how simple God can be
[2:15:23] maybe there's someone that's doubting
[2:15:25] tonight but you have that experience
[2:15:29] Hallelujah
[2:15:31] you might say well I never shouted or
[2:15:33] spoken tongues and those things let me
[2:15:35] tell you
[2:15:36] you know you was there when it happened
[2:15:41] Hallelujah
[2:15:42] you ought to know you were there and God
[2:15:44] was there something changed your life
[2:15:47] you might and you know the devil will
[2:15:49] try to compare and say well your friend
[2:15:52] received it this way and another one
[2:15:54] received it this way let me tell you
[2:15:56] there's no testimonies there's no two
[2:15:59] testimonies alike
[2:16:00] God Is So loves his children that he
[2:16:04] gives each one of you a specific
[2:16:07] individual testimony and experience and
[2:16:11] the Bible says they overcame him by the
[2:16:14] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[2:16:17] own testimony there's no two testimonies
[2:16:21] alike
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:26] I know what I'm speaking of
[2:16:31] you know so many people have the Holy
[2:16:33] Spirit
[2:16:34] but the Satan puts a question mark
[2:16:39] let me tell you the correct answer even
[2:16:42] tonight when while we are preaching
[2:16:44] finishing
[2:16:46] the the right answer is in this room
[2:16:50] the truth has set you free
[2:16:54] you don't even need prayer he said
[2:16:56] isn't that powerful the truth has
[2:16:59] already set you free
[2:17:02] I am so thankful
[2:17:06] that that is a certain sound there's no
[2:17:09] doubt in it
[2:17:10] God is going to have a bride
[2:17:13] without spot or wrinkle
[2:17:16] God is going to have not just survivors
[2:17:18] but Overcomers
[2:17:20] and he says I'm going to give you a
[2:17:22] white stone with your new name written
[2:17:24] on it and nobody knows it but yourself
[2:17:28] nobody you have don't have to go to
[2:17:31] anybody else for the confirmation you
[2:17:33] and God
[2:17:36] say God I need an answer I need an
[2:17:38] assurance tonight
[2:17:40] the Lord bless you
[2:17:42] it was such a wonderful audience God
[2:17:44] bless you
[2:17:46] as the musicians come let's stand
[2:17:55] the answer is here tonight
[2:18:13] you know what
[2:18:23] so many times the devil wants to tempt
[2:18:25] us to explain explain this explain that
[2:18:28] but the our Prophet told us that
[2:18:31] there is still a supernatural element
[2:18:33] despite the revelation
[2:18:36] there's still a part that we can never
[2:18:38] explain
[2:18:41] amen
[2:18:42] so let's let's allow God to do the
[2:18:45] Supernatural part
[2:18:47] Hallelujah
[2:18:49] let's just bow our heads for a moment
[2:18:51] before we change the order of the
[2:18:53] service maybe there's someone tonight

[2:19:07] you
[2:19:09] maybe you said these words you're not
[2:19:11] good enough
