[0:36] [Music]
[1:11] walking down the street Billy said to me
[1:12] he said
[1:14] Dan how does God ever know who they all
[1:18] are I said all right son look right
[1:20] straight up towards the skies I said see
[1:23] those two little stars up there almost
[1:26] together yeah I said if one of them
[1:28] science tells us one of them star to the
[1:30] Earth at a million miles an hour had
[1:31] takeen millions of years to get here
[1:34] that's how far it is away and yet those
[1:36] two stars are closer to each other than
[1:39] we are to the star or we're probably
[1:41] closer to the star and they are to
[1:43] us he said how does God ever do it I
[1:47] said he's
[1:50] infinite we just heard a lecture from
[1:53] Einstein this galaxy in the
[1:56] constellation and he said if a a person
[2:00] could leave the Earth one of his great
[2:02] speeches last ones if a person could
[2:04] leave the Earth at the speed of light
[2:07] that's um
[2:10] 8 186,000 miles per second 186,000 miles
[2:16] per second and would travel
[2:19] 150 million light years he would arrive
[2:25] there and then it take him 150 million
[2:29] likes years to come back that would be
[2:31] so many billions of years you could run
[2:34] a Roy NES around the earth and not break
[2:36] it down and talking about years you know
[2:39] how long youve been gone from the earth
[2:41] 50 years in our time we're in such a Hur
[2:46] what if a little ant started from Tucson
[2:49] to come up here to Bakerfield how far
[2:53] you think he would get in 40 years
[2:56] probably a half a mile see it means so
[2:58] much to him to us it meant 12 hours
[3:01] driving to a jet plane just a few
[3:04] seconds to God
[3:07] nothing Jesus died yesterday afternoon
[3:10] he was crucified Paul died
[3:13] yesterday 1,000 years is is a day with
[3:17] God as it was not even that but if you
[3:19] want to count the time so those Apostles
[3:22] and things died
[3:24] yesterday we're hurrying we ain't got a
[3:26] little bit of time to stay here then you
[3:29] think when you look at eternity Einstein
[3:32] the great philosopher said or the great
[3:34] scientist said
[3:37] that there's only one sensible way to
[3:40] explain the origin of this Earth that
[3:43] was found in Hebrews the 11th chapter in
[3:45] the third Birth by faith we understand
[3:48] God framed the world out of things he
[3:51] spoke it into existence how does it
[3:54] stand in the sky never gets out of its
[3:58] orbit how that every thing in heaven in
[4:00] that constellation if one of those stars
[4:03] that move I know you go out at night say
[4:04] I've seen a star shooting all you've
[4:05] seen a weather light star don't move if
[4:08] that star would move we'd move with it
[4:11] everything in heaven is so much in
[4:12] harmony it holds one another together
[4:15] what if mankind could be that way to
[4:17] hold the church together that we could
[4:19] all be in harmony with the
[4:23] word only one way let God be his own
[4:26] interpreter and we will be God's his
[4:29] interpreter of that that

[45:44] certainly enjoyed the singing and uh
[45:47] just feels like the presence of the Lord
[45:49] is in this place what a meeting last
[45:52] night I I I so enjoyed that I just I I
[45:56] was up during the night and I was just
[45:58] thinking on those thoughts you know
[46:01] brother brandham says he said when Moses
[46:03] he said God he said Moses was just Moses
[46:06] he said but when God came it was God
[46:08] speaking through
[46:09] Moses and we're just men but when God
[46:13] comes and he speaks to us and uses us as
[46:15] an instrument and we just so uh he would
[46:19] say this he said may God give me a
[46:21] temporary resurrection and borrow my
[46:24] body amen I Pro maybe some of you
[46:28] watched last night I would hope it most
[46:30] of you did but I we announced that on
[46:33] November the 11th of this last week of
[46:36] uh we had we had took the coin with us
[46:38] that brother Kelly brought and uh we
[46:41] announced this this week that uh
[46:44] yesterday uh we don't have any of the
[46:47] final final results yet from the doctors
[46:50] and and so but we've we've got a few of
[46:53] those but Dr gon is my is my main
[46:57] oncologist doctor and she's a she's
[47:00] Catholic by belief and she's just a
[47:02] wonderful doctor she's a wonderful
[47:04] doctor and so anyway she she just
[47:09] said she said just just just wonderful
[47:14] results are
[47:15] happening and so we got the results of
[47:19] the of the lungs and she read them to us
[47:22] and she said now i' she said we're still
[47:25] waiting on radi ol ologist to read them
[47:28] and then give us give us and we'll
[47:30] interpret it and um and so kind of give
[47:34] us what we mean but when we first
[47:37] started this we we found out that we had
[47:41] brother Nathaniel could probably explain
[47:43] it better than we had we had nodules in
[47:46] our lungs and they were cancerous
[47:48] nodules it was it was a maatic melanoma
[47:52] which is a bleeder which which which
[47:55] moves through the body very quick
[47:56] quickly and basically they gave us a
[47:59] death sentence and uh because when it
[48:03] went to the to the
[48:05] brain and so on Wednesday we went to get
[48:09] our scans and our our scans came back on
[48:14] our
[48:15] lungs and I found this interesting that
[48:18] I got this scan on aena butt's birthday
[48:28] and if you remember Elena buts had had
[48:31] cancer all in her lungs and it was
[48:33] completely
[48:36] black and uh and I got a scan back on my
[48:42] lungs that said that those tumors were
[48:52] resolved Hallelujah
[48:59] Hallelujah now I don't know what all
[49:00] that means and and I've got to continue
[49:03] to to because we've got brain tumors
[49:06] that we're dealing with and and and then
[49:08] they're look they're looking but you
[49:11] know I I just know this that God don't
[49:13] start a work that he don't
[49:15] [Applause]
[49:20] finish I like it don't you he don't
[49:24] start a work he don't finish
[49:27] I want to say it again he don't start at
[49:30] work but he don't
[49:33] finish now I was in the shower this
[49:36] morning when I was thinking about this
[49:38] and I'm I'm sorry I wasn't in a
[49:40] three-piece
[49:43] suit and I got to thinking about that
[49:46] you know Elena she sang for her birthday
[49:48] on on Wednesday
[49:51] night and uh and if we could just go
[49:54] back for a few moments that uh a
[49:57] Elena was having tremendous issues with
[50:01] this
[50:01] cancer and she was sitting in service
[50:04] and she she had had the the whatever you
[50:08] call it on her head and and she was just
[50:10] sitting back in the mezzanine where she
[50:13] could not where she could not uh you
[50:16] know she wouldn't be with other people
[50:18] or maybe get any germs and those are
[50:20] some of the things that I've been
[50:21] recommended to do as well
[50:24] but she was sitting by back there and
[50:27] brother Tim PR had preached and then he
[50:29] started singing leaning on the
[50:32] Everlasting
[50:33] Arms and you know sometimes we think
[50:36] that we're just in another service
[50:39] on and maybe even people here last night
[50:42] thought well we're just in another
[50:44] service and the pillar of fire was
[50:50] visible listen it can't get better than
[50:53] that
[50:56] yeah oh I'm waiting for this to happen
[50:59] or that let me just say it's
[51:11] happening and she's sitting back there
[51:13] and leaning on the Everlasting Arms is
[51:16] is and something struck
[51:19] her and when it struck her even in that
[51:24] condition no doctor standing there
[51:25] saying you're going to get well but the
[51:28] word was saying she was going to get
[51:30] well and she took God at his
[51:33] word and she ran around that
[51:37] building and ran and ran and ran I'll
[51:42] tell you today she's cancer
[51:49] free
[51:51] Hallelujah you remember brother Tim PR's
[51:55] dream the Les of
[51:58] 12 you know no man can can do this but
[52:02] every 12 weeks I have went for
[52:05] test and if you remember the buzzards
[52:07] were
[52:08] fed to the
[52:11] pigs and it would happen at the at the
[52:13] 12 cycles and here we are again at
[52:16] another 12 cycle that devil must be
[52:19] shaking in
[52:22] hell because he came in for a death blow
[52:25] to one of God
[52:27] seat and I want to say this like Aaron
[52:30] Oglesby says he didn't have
[52:48] enough brother Andrew sent me a note
[52:50] this week
[52:52] and on Wednesday and he said today is
[52:55] the day
[52:57] I love you with all my heart this past
[52:59] year look what God has said to
[53:03] us these are the titles of the sermons
[53:06] that you've
[53:07] heard he's got
[53:11] this December the
[53:13] 22nd if you'll trust me I'll use you
[53:17] like never
[53:19] before brother Roy shrewbury calls and
[53:25] says brother Ron you're getting ready to
[53:27] go into a place that no man's ever came
[53:30] out of like
[53:32] Daniel but remember Daniel's last words
[53:35] oh King I'll see you in the
[53:40] morning we might as well just have a we
[53:42] might as well have
[53:52] church I preached a sermon laying it all
[53:54] on the line
[54:02] I sent Andrew a note on 410
[54:05] 20 I was just in
[54:08] prayer and waiting and this is what I
[54:11] heard his voice respond to me I did not
[54:15] ask you to
[54:17] do what you did not have the
[54:20] capacity to do hallu
[54:27] I might just dismiss after all
[54:32] this the man in the arena how many
[54:35] remember that
[54:37] sermon it's the man who smells the
[54:39] breath of the
[54:40] enemy and his size and his
[54:44] strength it is not those that are
[54:46] sitting in the
[54:47] crowd they may be for you they may be
[54:50] praying with you but they're not feeling
[54:52] his hot
[54:53] breath they don't know the daytoday war
[54:56] war that is going on but they're with
[54:59] you they're they're in the battle with
[55:04] you statements were it is the battle
[55:08] that God designed for the
[55:14] moment another sermon was we must answer
[55:18] the bell for the challenge of the
[55:23] hour the sermon that inspired us to go
[55:25] to Louis
[55:27] Iana I must get to
[55:30] Jesus how many remember that sermon are
[55:33] you awake look over at your neighbor say
[55:35] are you
[55:37] awake the angel of the Lord spoke to me
[55:39] said look past what you see and think
[55:42] past what you
[55:44] think another sermon is as God is your
[55:47] partner you better have big
[55:53] plans another sermon was who is Jesus
[55:57] and I spoke that if you remember I think
[55:59] it was three times who is
[56:02] Jesus a very prophetic sermon that began
[56:05] to be SP spoken last
[56:07] summer and God dealt with me to speak of
[56:10] David when Satan took or or when the
[56:14] when the enemy came and took everything
[56:16] that he
[56:17] had and God spoke to him even his own
[56:20] men and audience wanted to kill him and
[56:25] God spoke to me to take a sermon called
[56:28] take it
[56:32] back if you haven't if you can't
[56:34] remember that sermon I would encourage
[56:37] you to go back and listen to that sermon
[56:40] and then think on the last year of what
[56:43] has
[56:46] happened another sermon was called the
[56:49] music is more important than the
[56:52] struggle
[56:57] another sermon was the Gates of Hell
[57:00] will not
[57:03] Prevail another sermon was called true
[57:08] repentance another sermon was called
[57:10] ring the
[57:12] bell and in that
[57:15] sermon we we came to a point to where
[57:18] that we're going to have a bell
[57:21] ringing and to make sure brother Joe
[57:23] Green ordered me a a fight but
[57:31] and I believe in just a matter of a
[57:32] short time I'm going to bring that
[57:44] Bell I preached a few weeks ago on who
[57:47] is Ron
[57:54] Spencer who are
[57:56] you that's
[58:00] right because we've got more Authority
[58:03] than an angel in
[58:05] heaven and we sometimes forget who we
[58:10] are just only a couple of weeks ago I
[58:12] preached a sermon called God is bigger
[58:17] than your
[58:21] problems I just read you off a list and
[58:24] Andrew felt inspired to to to give that
[58:27] and he was speaking back in the back
[58:29] room and when I heard it I thought that
[58:31] needs to be in the front of the
[58:37] sermon these sermons were not
[58:40] delivered by a man in perfect
[58:48] health these sermons were
[58:52] delivered by the anointing of God
[58:56] regardless of a stage four
[59:00] cancer don't bring me your excuse of why
[59:04] you can't serve
[59:06] [Applause]
[59:14] God
[59:17] hallelujah I am
[59:20] determined I'm determined
[59:37] Hallelujah brother Ron aren't you afraid
[59:39] of what could come you're fighting all
[59:41] of these other things let me just say if
[59:43] he's got me here he'll get me
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:52] there as you can tell I didn't come to
[59:54] play this morning so here we are
[59:57] are now so many times we are in an age
[1:00:00] to where that we've heard the prophet
[1:00:02] say that there's going to come a time to
[1:00:05] where there's going to be missing limbs
[1:00:07] in the third pole we are in the third
[1:00:12] pole we are in the bride's
[1:00:15] Revival we're not looking for those
[1:00:17] things in the
[1:00:21] future in this process he has restored
[1:00:25] organs
[1:00:27] not just Ron Spencer but what about
[1:00:30] Karen Esther
[1:00:34] puit are you with me now brother Tim
[1:00:38] said her hairs growing back and said
[1:00:40] some of the places where she had ball
[1:00:42] spots in those spots the hair is coming
[1:00:45] back just full
[1:00:56] and and literally the day the day the
[1:00:58] the hours before surgery they told
[1:01:01] brother Tim that she would probably be a
[1:01:02] vegetable the rest of the life should we
[1:01:04] even do the
[1:01:06] surgery she's not a vegetable she's not
[1:01:10] in a rest home she's not in a rehab
[1:01:13] she'll be in church in a few
[1:01:22] moments when we when we saw
[1:01:28] help me with a
[1:01:29] name
[1:01:32] uh bring free Tims no hair
[1:01:37] alapa when
[1:01:40] Mariah forgive me I'm having those
[1:01:43] moments I actually spoke to the doctor
[1:01:45] about it and he said ah just get
[1:01:48] help so I went and got
[1:01:53] help when Mariah lost all of her
[1:01:57] hair are you with me and they say
[1:01:59] there's no cure for
[1:02:01] it are you with me brother Tim prayed
[1:02:04] for
[1:02:04] her he felt led to pray for her and I
[1:02:07] don't remember the month just now I'm
[1:02:10] struggling with a little bit of those
[1:02:11] but let me to say this to you she came
[1:02:14] through spring camp no hair with three
[1:02:18] bobby
[1:02:20] pins and God restored her hair
[1:02:33] let me just say it if you if you if you
[1:02:36] can't see God moving
[1:02:39] now if that don't cause you to be
[1:02:41] desperate before God and lay aside every
[1:02:44] weight and the sin which does so easily
[1:02:46] beset
[1:02:47] us hallelujah that's the kind of God
[1:02:51] that can bring open the
[1:02:54] graves 2,000 years not just graves in a
[1:02:57] ground but the sea has to give forth of
[1:03:01] the resurrection power of Jesus Christ
[1:03:06] the dead and the Sea will come
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:12] forth
[1:03:14] Hallelujah not just
[1:03:16] that this is a miracle that is in the
[1:03:19] process of going on but I want to tell
[1:03:21] you another one I'm getting ready to get
[1:03:24] a new body
[1:03:30] I'm not just talking about cancer free
[1:03:34] I'm talking about grave free I'm talking
[1:03:37] about Glasses
[1:03:38] free I'm talking about pain free it'll
[1:03:42] be a body like unto his own glorious
[1:03:45] body
[1:04:06] you can stand and let's go to the
[1:04:09] scripture so with all of that in
[1:04:12] mind I want to preach on this morning
[1:04:15] can't stop
[1:04:18] this you can't stop this yes
[1:04:22] sir why don't you just tell the devil
[1:04:25] Can't Stop stop
[1:04:38] this Matthew chapter 6 and verse
[1:04:43] 9
[1:04:48] hallelujah
[1:04:52] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:04] Hallelujah and after this
[1:05:07] manner therefore pray
[1:05:10] ye Our Father which art in
[1:05:13] heaven Hallowed be thy
[1:05:16] name thy kingdom
[1:05:19] come thy will be done in earth as it is
[1:05:21] in
[1:05:23] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[1:05:26] bread and forgive us our debts as we
[1:05:29] forgive our
[1:05:30] debtors lead us not into temptation but
[1:05:33] Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the
[1:05:36] kingdom and the power and the glory
[1:05:39] forever second Peter chapter 1 and verse
[1:05:47] 10 if you don't have it in your Bible
[1:05:50] there just look up there on the screen
[1:05:52] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:05:54] diligence to make your calling an
[1:05:57] election
[1:05:59] sure for if we do these things you shall
[1:06:03] never
[1:06:04] fail for such an entrance shall be
[1:06:07] ministered unto you abundantly unto the
[1:06:10] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:06:12] Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not
[1:06:16] be negligent to put a you always in
[1:06:20] remembrance of these things though you
[1:06:23] know them and be established in the
[1:06:25] present
[1:06:27] truth yay I think it meet as long as I
[1:06:30] am in this Tabernacle to stir up by
[1:06:34] putting you in
[1:06:36] remembrance knowing that shortly I must
[1:06:39] put off this tab this my Tabernacle even
[1:06:43] as the Lord Jesus Christ has showed me
[1:06:46] moreover I will endeavor that ye may be
[1:06:50] able after my deceased to have these
[1:06:54] things always
[1:06:56] in
[1:06:58] remembrance for we have not
[1:07:01] followed cunningly devis
[1:07:06] fables when we made known unto you the
[1:07:09] power and the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:12] Christ but were eyewitnesses of his
[1:07:15] majesty for we receive from God the
[1:07:18] Father honoring Glory when there was
[1:07:21] such a voice to to him the ex excellent
[1:07:25] Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I
[1:07:28] am well pleased and this voice which
[1:07:32] came from heaven we
[1:07:34] hurt when we were with him in the Holy
[1:07:39] Mountain we have also a more sure word
[1:07:42] of Prophecy wherein do you do well that
[1:07:45] you take Eed as a light that shineth in
[1:07:48] a dark place until the day Dawn and the
[1:07:51] day star arise in your heart knowing
[1:07:55] this first that no Prophecy of the
[1:07:58] scripture is of any private
[1:08:01] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:08:04] in Old Time by the will of man but holy
[1:08:07] men of God spake as they were moved by
[1:08:11] the Holy
[1:08:12] Ghost you may be
[1:08:23] seated this is the theme of the sermon
[1:08:28] today he is on his
[1:08:33] way that's right he is on his
[1:08:38] way and Satan knows that there is
[1:08:42] nothing that he can do to stop
[1:08:44] [Applause]
[1:08:49] him I want that just to settle
[1:08:52] in he is on his way
[1:08:56] and Satan knows that there is
[1:08:59] nothing he can do to stop
[1:09:02] him Revelations chapter 21 And1 and I
[1:09:06] saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the
[1:09:07] first Heaven and the first Earth were
[1:09:09] passed away and there was no more sea
[1:09:12] and I John saw the holy city the New
[1:09:14] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:09:17] Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her
[1:09:20] husband I want you to understand this is
[1:09:22] not Hollywood wood or this is not Disney
[1:09:25] World
[1:09:29] just as much as God said in the
[1:09:33] beginning in Genesis chapter
[1:09:36] 1 and God spoke the word and he believed
[1:09:40] his own word and it came into existence
[1:09:43] this is the same God that says I saw a
[1:09:47] new Heaven and I saw a new
[1:09:50] Earth it is not at if it's going to
[1:09:52] happen
[1:09:59] are you with me it's already laid down
[1:10:01] in the plans of
[1:10:03] God he's already made the provisions for
[1:10:06] it to
[1:10:11] happen and there was no more
[1:10:13] sea and I John saw the holy city the New
[1:10:16] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:10:18] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:10:20] her husband and I heard a great voice
[1:10:23] out of Heaven saying behold the tabern
[1:10:25] tacle of God is with men and he will
[1:10:28] dwell with them and they shall be his
[1:10:30] people he's talking about me here now
[1:10:33] and God himself shall be with them and
[1:10:35] be their
[1:10:37] God and God shall wipe away all the
[1:10:39] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[1:10:41] no more death neither sorrow nor cry
[1:10:45] neither shall there be any more pain for
[1:10:47] the former things are passed away and he
[1:10:50] that sat upon the throne said behold I
[1:10:53] make all things new
[1:10:56] and he said unto me right for these
[1:10:58] things are true and faithful and he said
[1:11:00] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[1:11:03] the beginning and the end and I will
[1:11:04] give unto you that is a thirst the
[1:11:06] Fountain of of Life
[1:11:09] freely he that
[1:11:15] overcometh he that overcometh shall
[1:11:18] inherit all
[1:11:21] things and I will be his God and he
[1:11:24] shall be my
[1:11:28] son but the fearful and the unbelieving
[1:11:33] and the Abominable and murderers and
[1:11:37] whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolaters
[1:11:41] and all liars shall have their part in
[1:11:44] the Lake of
[1:11:46] Fire which burneth with a fire and
[1:11:49] brimstone which is a second
[1:11:52] death God not only laid out the ru rules
[1:11:55] for the Overcomer but he laid out the
[1:11:57] rules for The
[1:12:00] Sinner and just as much as there's going
[1:12:03] to be a real
[1:12:06] heaven there's going to be a real
[1:12:09] hell and you've got an opportunity right
[1:12:12] now to avoid the second
[1:12:17] part come on Church take
[1:12:20] courage I say to those your loved ones

[1:12:45] prescription he gave you the inoculation

[1:16:02] believe that the Bible is inspired and
[1:16:04] it's written by the Holy Spirit and it
[1:16:07] is the infallible word of
[1:16:11] God I'm not interested in what people

[1:16:18] Bible I'm not interested in what people
[1:16:20] say is mistakes in the

[1:17:58] Rapture there's going to be a
[1:18:01] resurrection there's going to be a body

[1:18:10] his disciples and he said let not your
[1:18:12] heart be troubled you believe in God

[1:18:17] are many mansions and if it were not so
[1:18:19] I would have told you I go to prepare a
[1:18:22] place for you Ryan Spencer

[1:18:35] Hallelujah I believe that the Bible is
[1:18:38] inspired I believe it's written by the
[1:18:40] Holy Spirit it is the infallible word of
[1:18:44] God and God is under obligation to his
[1:18:47] word to the believer that will accept
[1:18:50] his word and any word is a seed and if
[1:18:53] you'll accept it in your heart
[1:18:55] by faith and believe it and confess it
[1:18:59] God will bring it to
[1:19:10] pass brother BR says we live in a day of
[1:19:14] uncertainty it's an uncertain time I
[1:19:17] want to ask you something I try to teach
[1:19:20] just just for a moment to refer to this
[1:19:23] to these context
[1:19:25] here in the scriptures I'd like to ask
[1:19:28] you anything that is
[1:19:31] uncertain cannot be
[1:19:38] trusted and if it's uncertain you can't
[1:19:41] trust
[1:19:42] it Paul said here if the trumpet gives
[1:19:46] an uncertain sound how shall we prepare
[1:19:50] ourselves for battle
[1:19:55] now
[1:19:57] uncertainty there never was a time that
[1:20:00] things was so
[1:20:02] uncertain as
[1:20:04] today if he could say this in 1962 what
[1:20:08] about
[1:20:09] today and anything that's
[1:20:12] uncertain can not be
[1:20:20] trusted
[1:20:22] uncertainty how many times we get up in
[1:20:25] the mornings and we look at the
[1:20:30] weather and we know that they only hit
[1:20:32] it about 177% of the
[1:20:39] time maybe a baseball
[1:20:42] player because there's a lot of numbers
[1:20:44] in
[1:20:46] baseball
[1:20:49] nobody would keep a baseball player on
[1:20:52] their on their roster you're right
[1:20:55] that was only hitting 177% of the
[1:20:59] time he wouldn't last very
[1:21:04] long tens of thousands over the past few
[1:21:08] months have went and listened to
[1:21:11] presidential
[1:21:14] candidates who they will later fact
[1:21:17] check and in some places 80% of what
[1:21:21] they
[1:21:22] said only weeks before they were
[1:21:24] contrary to what they said
[1:21:27] today so people know that they're going
[1:21:30] to hear a
[1:21:37] lie churches set full of
[1:21:42] people around the world on every
[1:21:45] corner knowing that the preachers ruled
[1:21:48] by a deacon board or a trustee
[1:21:51] board or by a seminary teaching
[1:21:55] and knowing the word of God said if you
[1:21:57] take away or you add to it your name
[1:22:00] will be taken out of the Book of Life
[1:22:02] what a responsibility we got as a
[1:22:04] ministers we have a mandate that this
[1:22:08] word be
[1:22:16] true yet their houses of worship set
[1:22:19] full of prostitutes Bob ter
[1:22:22] Jezebel we see shequ sitting all over
[1:22:26] their
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:32] building and they can sit in a church on
[1:22:34] Sunday morning and on Sunday night there
[1:22:37] at another place Monday Tuesday
[1:22:39] Wednesday Thursday Friday
[1:22:48] but brother Ron that's pretty tough I'm
[1:22:50] not running for president
[1:22:55] I'm not interested in your political
[1:23:00] agenda you didn't hire me you can't fire
[1:23:06] me I'm not worried about your
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:15] money thank God we don't have a bunch of
[1:23:18] artificial plant sitting all over this
[1:23:20] building who cringe at every word that
[1:23:23] is said across this pull pit and want to
[1:23:26] talk to me in the office afterward and
[1:23:28] give me a a beating because that it
[1:23:30] didn't go just the way that they wanted
[1:23:32] to do first of
[1:23:35] all this church ain't run like that if
[1:23:39] you got an opinion keep it to yourself
[1:23:42] [Applause]
[1:24:16] but I tell you do I will tell you this
[1:24:18] is not a halfway
[1:24:21] house this not a transition unit
[1:24:26] this is a transformation
[1:24:29] house where you can come here and be a
[1:24:31] prostitute and get saved and never go
[1:24:34] back to that life again a
[1:24:38] drunk a filthy religious believer are
[1:24:41] you with me full of Creeds and dogmas
[1:24:44] and the blood of Jesus Christ can wash
[1:24:47] every Sin from your life every ounce of
[1:24:50] unbelief from you and prepare you for
[1:24:53] the
[1:24:56] Rapture we're not interested in building
[1:24:58] mega church
[1:25:02] here that's not my
[1:25:05] interest my interest is to get you from
[1:25:07] this realm to that real and when we're
[1:25:10] sitting at the marriage table of the
[1:25:12] marriage supper of the lamb and I look

[1:25:35] it because that's going to happen just
[1:25:38] as sure as I'm standing here in this
[1:25:39] Pulpit that realm is more real than this
[1:25:49] realm we're looking for the day of
[1:25:51] complete restoration
[1:25:54] we have been watching over the
[1:25:56] last 11 10 11 months a body that be
[1:26:01] taken to the Realms of the hands of
[1:26:04] death and then we've watched that
[1:26:06] progressively begin to get stronger and
[1:26:09] stronger and stronger and stronger and
[1:26:13] stronger and one day we'll ring a
[1:26:22] bell is that not what is happen happen

[1:26:29] Tangled in all kinds of webs of sin but
[1:26:32] they came heing through years and years
[1:26:35] and coming to church and experience
[1:26:37] after experience and word upon word and

[1:27:04] feelings but look back in your life from
[1:27:07] where you came from to where you are now
[1:27:10] and if God can bring you from where you
[1:27:12] came from to where you are now he can
[1:27:15] take where you are now and take you to
[1:27:17] the end of the road

[1:30:06] of death hell and the
[1:30:08] grave and all of those prophets and all
[1:30:10] of the Believers throughout the Old
[1:30:12] Testament that had waited on the Messiah

[1:31:58] something a certain
[1:32:01] way he's got to Forever stay with him or
[1:32:05] he made a
[1:32:09] mistake BR says I can do anything said
[1:32:11] this right here in
[1:32:13] Harrisonburg I I make a
[1:32:17] mistake I'm fine
[1:32:21] out but God is infinite
[1:32:26] let me just say this to you people quit
[1:32:29] church because they see a mistake and
[1:32:31] somebody's sitting on a
[1:32:34] Pew that is a petty
[1:32:40] excuse the scripture said judge not lest
[1:32:43] you be
[1:32:46] judged and let me do let me just bear in
[1:32:49] mind the microscope that you are using
[1:32:51] on brother brandom or using on me or
[1:32:53] using on on Homer or using on Tim PR or
[1:32:55] Donnie Reagan or Ed Bisal or any of the
[1:32:58] Ministers of the message or Joe Green
[1:32:59] whoever you
[1:33:01] are the microscope you're using on those
[1:33:05] men are you mad brother Ron oh
[1:33:10] yeah how dare the devil pick on my
[1:33:18] buddies that's why God brought me from
[1:33:20] Stonewall Jack Jackson territory
[1:33:24] cuz right here there's a lot of
[1:33:27] fight and this church is known to be
[1:33:29] able to fight we don't fight each other
[1:33:32] we fight the
[1:33:36] devil come on your amens ought to be
[1:33:38] stronger than
[1:33:45] that the microscope that you use on
[1:33:48] those men remember that with that
[1:33:51] judgment it'll turn around and be used
[1:33:54] on
[1:33:57] you oh but brother Ron I don't profess
[1:33:59] to be anything that just means you're
[1:34:01] twofold more child of
[1:34:11] Hell well I might as well pull my coat
[1:34:15] off I'm not g to be much longer but I
[1:34:18] don't got hot
[1:34:35] sometimes God brings things to a
[1:34:41] showdown brings it to a
[1:34:43] showdown where he stands toet to Toe
[1:34:47] with
[1:34:49] goath stands with shamgar
[1:34:53] even with Elijah with his miracles and a
[1:34:56] double portion being promised to
[1:34:58] Elisha it was God that told him he'd get
[1:35:01] a double portion but Elisha's bones had
[1:35:05] been laying in the ground and his body
[1:35:10] and the senu was laying there in a cave
[1:35:13] and there was still one Miracle left to
[1:35:16] be
[1:35:17] done I I imagine there was a lot of
[1:35:20] critics there that said you
[1:35:22] know that prophet said that he would
[1:35:24] have a double portion and and his God
[1:35:27] wasn't big
[1:35:32] enough but to only give him
[1:35:34] seven or 15 or what however you want to
[1:35:37] say it only give him this amount and he
[1:35:41] still lacks one he's not done
[1:35:45] yet because God had gave that body a
[1:35:50] promise
[1:35:53] I'm going there with you he's give your
[1:35:56] body a
[1:36:01] [Applause]
[1:36:06] promise brother Ron have you forgot
[1:36:09] we've had covid deaths in this church
[1:36:11] have you forgot that the last breath
[1:36:13] that they breathed they was not 89 years
[1:36:16] old anymore but they turned into an
[1:36:19] 18year old
[1:36:20] body I'm not standing here having the

[1:51:59] why there's nobody around me and a hand
[1:52:03] was on my
[1:52:05] shoulder I thought what is
[1:52:08] this someone's hand laying on my
[1:52:12] shoulder and I turned to the child and I
[1:52:15] happened to notice that foot little foot
[1:52:18] legs all broke up his little foot
[1:52:21] running through
[1:52:23] through his big old ribed black socks
[1:52:28] that look

[1:52:34] that was the mayor of the
[1:52:38] city

[1:53:06] about 30
[1:53:07] minutes they was waiting for his mother

[1:53:23] back and little dark brown hair and
[1:53:26] little little panty waist his feet
[1:53:29] through his socks and I looked around

[1:53:55] afternoon to explain to you what a what
[1:53:57] a feeling is that that
[1:54:00] is I want you to just notice two
[1:54:07] years but I wish that I had the
[1:54:10] strength this afternoon to explain to
[1:54:13] you what a feeling that it
[1:54:16] is and I don't mean to I don't mean to
[1:54:20] to jump into things here but you just
[1:54:22] don't know after a

[1:54:38] ear you'll not live to seek

[1:54:45] leave my wife and the nightmares that I
[1:54:48] went through for
[1:54:50] months and listen by the supernatural
[1:54:53] Touch Of God them nightmares just
[1:54:56] vanished and they just
[1:55:04] left let me just break in here just for
[1:55:07] a moment share a very personal testimony
[1:55:09] with you when they went to do a biopsy
[1:55:12] on my lungs they did a biopsy under my
[1:55:15] arm but they went to do a biopsy under
[1:55:16] my lungs that's where they take a needle
[1:55:20] and they go through your back or through
[1:55:22] through your rib cage and they go in and
[1:55:25] they go go into your lungs and Pierce
[1:55:28] through your lungs and then go in and
[1:55:30] take a
[1:55:31] piece of that cancer
[1:55:34] out and I'm saying this for the
[1:55:41] critic
[1:55:43] listen just Friday I went through a test
[1:55:48] that was a very difficult test
[1:55:52] and the lady treated me pretty
[1:55:55] cruy and I thought to myself if people
[1:55:57] only knew what this body has had to go
[1:56:00] through
[1:56:06] right you see a man standing here in a
[1:56:08] pull pit that gets tired and weary
[1:56:11] and you're watching a
[1:56:20] miracle I watch people come come in put
[1:56:22] their arms like this put your yourself
[1:56:25] down in the seat well we're going to be
[1:56:27] here about 2 hours and 10
[1:56:29] minutes you better take advantage of
[1:56:31] this two hours and 10
[1:56:36] minutes you better hang on to every drop
[1:56:39] of this that you can
[1:56:49] get they took me in they took me in
[1:56:51] those clothes putting in those clothes I
[1:56:54] was going to have this biopsy on my
[1:56:57] lungs they put me in in the clothes for
[1:57:00] it they have a special special gowns for
[1:57:03] that that has openings in
[1:57:06] it
[1:57:08] and and when they rolled me into the
[1:57:11] room there was about I would say between
[1:57:15] between 20 and 30 because they had some
[1:57:17] people that were going to watch
[1:57:20] it students that was going to to watch
[1:57:23] it and it was a quite a it was a room
[1:57:26] connected with other rooms and different
[1:57:29] things and there was one man he was a
[1:57:31] very gentle man he was a Christian man
[1:57:34] and he said I understand you're a you're
[1:57:36] a pastor and I said I
[1:57:44] am two nurses took
[1:57:47] me and prayed with me women
[1:57:54] and they told me they said we're going
[1:57:55] to have to turn you quite a bit turn you
[1:57:57] over and over and over to find the right
[1:58:04] spot and so they just kept turning and
[1:58:06] they would bring the needle down and
[1:58:08] they get ready to go in and they go no
[1:58:10] no no no that's not it it's not what we
[1:58:12] want and they just spent they spent
[1:58:14] quite a bit of time doing
[1:58:21] that it was very
[1:58:23] painful I just have to say it was very
[1:58:26] painful it's an experience I hope I
[1:58:29] don't have to experience this week or
[1:58:32] ever

[1:58:39] honest

[1:58:47] Restless because they turned me so much
[1:58:52] and the man came around the head of the
[1:58:54] machine it's just a huge
[1:58:56] machine I can't remember exactly what
[1:58:59] the name of that is but he kind of just
[1:59:02] kind of poked his head in where my head
[1:59:04] was and he said Mr
[1:59:09] Spencer he said I know what you're
[1:59:11] thinking we can't find the
[1:59:13] tumors he said I know what you're
[1:59:16] thinking they're
[1:59:17] gone he said I I know what you're
[1:59:21] thinking he said but Mr Spencer your
[1:59:24] lungs are so full of those
[1:59:26] tumors we're trying to find the right
[1:59:30] one and he said we're wanting to get
[1:59:32] near to the one that's near to your to
[1:59:39] your
[1:59:42] throat and near the heart he said that's
[1:59:45] that's the one that we're wanting to get
