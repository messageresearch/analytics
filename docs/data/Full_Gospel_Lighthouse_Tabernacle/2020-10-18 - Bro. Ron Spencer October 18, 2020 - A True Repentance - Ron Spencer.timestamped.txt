[46:54] the lord just kept has kept pulling me
[46:56] back in this direction
[46:58] so i i just feel like that the enemy is
[47:01] in some real trouble this morning
[47:04] amen there was a man
[47:07] of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler
[47:10] of the jews
[47:11] the same came to jesus by night and said
[47:14] unto him rabbi
[47:16] we know that thou art a teacher come
[47:19] from god
[47:21] for no man can do these miracles that
[47:23] thou doest
[47:25] except god be with him and that's an
[47:28] incredible scripture right there that's
[47:31] an
[47:31] incredible scripture and jesus
[47:34] answered and said unto him
[47:38] verily verily i say unto you except a
[47:41] man be
[47:42] born again now think about these things
[47:45] now
[47:47] he cannot see the kingdom
[47:51] of god this is jesus's first teachings
[47:56] nicodemus saith unto him how can a man
[47:59] be born
[48:01] be born when he is old and can he
[48:05] enter the second time into his mother's
[48:07] womb and be born
[48:09] and jesus answered verily verily i say
[48:12] unto thee
[48:13] except a man be born of water and of
[48:16] spirit
[48:17] he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
[48:20] that which which is born of flesh is
[48:22] flesh that which is born of the spirit
[48:24] is spirit
[48:26] marvel not that i say unto thee ye must
[48:29] be born again
[48:31] the wind bloweth where it listeth then
[48:33] thou
[48:34] hearest the sound thereof but canest
[48:37] thou
[48:38] not not tell whence it cometh or whether
[48:40] it goeth
[48:42] so is it that is born of the spirit of
[48:45] the spirit nicodemus answered and said
[48:48] unto him
[48:49] how can these things be and jesus
[48:52] answered and said unto him
[48:53] art thou a master of israel and know us
[48:56] not these things
[48:57] verily verbally i say unto you we speak
[49:00] that which we
[49:02] do know and testify that which we have
[49:05] seen
[49:06] and ye receive not our witness if i have
[49:10] told you
[49:11] earthly things and ye believe not
[49:15] how shall ye believe if i tell you
[49:18] heavenly things
[49:20] phenomenal and no man hath ascended up
[49:24] into heaven but he that
[49:26] that came down from heaven even the son
[49:28] of man which is in heaven
[49:30] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[49:33] the wilderness even so the son of man
[49:36] be lifted up and whosoever believeth in
[49:40] him should not perish but have
[49:41] everlasting life
[49:43] and this is on billboard's cars
[49:45] everywhere in the world
[49:46] for god so loved the world that he gave
[49:49] his only begotten son that whosoever
[49:51] believeth in him
[49:53] should not perish but have everlasting
[49:56] life
[49:56] don't stop there for god sent not his
[49:59] son
[50:00] into the world to condemn the world but
[50:03] that the world through him
[50:06] might be saved and he that believeth on
[50:10] him
[50:11] is not condemned but he that believeth
[50:14] not is condemned
[50:16] already when the word is presented to
[50:19] you
[50:19] your response to the word tells you
[50:21] where you are
[50:24] because he hath not believed in the name
[50:27] of the only begotten son of god
[50:29] and this is the condemnation that light
[50:32] has come into the world
[50:34] and men love darkness rather than
[50:37] light because their deeds were evil
[50:41] you may be seated this morning god bless
[50:43] the reading of his word so good to see
[50:52] you
[50:56] you've heard this story many times
[50:59] here's some time ago
[51:01] they had the religions of the world to
[51:03] meet
[51:06] he said i was reading in the book the
[51:08] other day of this lady macabee from
[51:11] oklahoma here that's arrested
[51:14] out here that might have been in in
[51:16] tulsa or one of these places she was
[51:18] running through the streets
[51:20] driving stage coaches and smoking a
[51:22] cigar
[51:23] that kind of tells you where she was at
[51:25] in in that time period of life
[51:28] breaking the speed limits with a stage
[51:30] coach
[51:35] i'd say this is a moody story and all
[51:38] the religions and different religions
[51:41] raised up and told they're part of the
[51:43] religion how great it was
[51:45] and the muhammad priest told
[51:48] how great his religion was and and the
[51:50] buddha told how great his religion was
[51:53] a certain little minister i i can't call
[51:56] his name now brother bran would say
[51:58] was representing the religion of america
[52:01] christian religion
[52:03] and when he got his name his time to the
[52:05] platform
[52:06] he told the story of of this great foul
[52:10] woman and how low that she was still
[52:13] until they couldn't didn't even want to
[52:15] get around her
[52:16] even to get close enough to tar and
[52:18] feather her
[52:19] she was so immoral she was
[52:23] degraded and there was nothing that
[52:25] could could help her
[52:27] and then he said gentlemen
[52:30] religions of this world
[52:34] can your religions produce anything that
[52:39] would
[52:39] cleanse the hands of this
[52:42] vile person
[52:46] everybody just sit real still right on
[52:49] the end of their streets
[52:50] no one said nothing then he jumped up in
[52:54] the air and screamed and kicked his
[52:56] heels together
[52:57] he said the blood of jesus christ won't
[53:00] only cleanse her hands
[53:02] but it'll cleanse her heart and make her
[53:04] pure
[53:06] as a lily the blood of jesus christ
[53:10] takes away sin and cleanses us from
[53:13] all of our iniquity
[53:16] and makes us new creatures in christ
[53:19] jesus
[53:20] nothing else would do it i want to
[53:24] report to you
[53:25] this blood cleansed my life
[53:28] and i'm a living testimony to it
[53:36] i found this the other day and i just i
[53:38] just really liked it
[53:44] says from time to time i have
[53:48] i've had people pour out their hearts to
[53:50] me because their sins
[53:53] had been discovered and they were in
[53:56] serious trouble
[53:58] they wept bitterly because they had
[54:01] devastated their marriage
[54:04] and ruined their reputation
[54:07] but later would tell you that they were
[54:10] back in the same situation
[54:14] they had not learned from their original
[54:16] experience
[54:18] and seemed determined
[54:21] to bring even more chaos into their life
[54:23] you ever met some of these kind of
[54:25] people
[54:27] you're welcome to say amen what
[54:30] was the problem the problem was the
[54:34] lack of repentance
[54:39] their tears were tears of self-pity
[54:44] not tears of repentance
[54:48] true repentance is turning from sin
[54:52] a conscious deliberate decision to leave
[54:55] sin
[54:56] behind and a conscious turning to god
[54:59] with a commitment to follow follow
[55:02] his will repentance
[55:06] is only one part of our response to
[55:09] christ
[55:10] even repentance is strength from god
[55:17] even repentance is strength from god
[55:21] but it's an essential part for without
[55:24] it
[55:25] we cannot claim christ as our lord
[55:28] the bible said godly sorrows brings
[55:32] repentance and that leads to salvation
[55:35] and leaves no regrets
[55:40] now here's where i want to just drop
[55:42] this just for a moment
[55:44] and i thought this is what caught my
[55:45] attention are you
[55:47] living in regret or repentance
[55:55] are you living in regret
[55:58] or repentance to turn
[56:02] away from our sins is not is just not
[56:04] enough
[56:06] we must also now turn toward god
[56:10] only he can create a new heart within us
[56:13] and give us strength
[56:14] to live differently brother brahman says
[56:18] and from that time he said all these
[56:20] things are
[56:21] there's a time when when something
[56:23] happens
[56:25] maybe all of your their vows and the
[56:27] league of nations and
[56:29] maybe had good intentions but they all
[56:32] have to come to an end
[56:34] all become crumbling beneath the feet of
[56:37] men
[56:38] with all the good intentions we have
[56:41] but all must come to an end there is a
[56:44] time
[56:45] that where a man can come to something
[56:48] that's eternal
[56:50] that when a man it's a time for a man to
[56:53] meet
[56:53] god and that's when something happens
[56:58] eternal we do our mistakes
[57:01] we make our vows on new year's night
[57:04] only to break them the next day
[57:09] we turn new pages we assign new vows
[57:12] we go to a priest we make confessions
[57:17] we sign pledges we we come to the altar
[57:21] and turn
[57:21] new pages but all were in vain
[57:27] all of that was in vain for the next
[57:31] time
[57:32] someone somebody crosses our path or
[57:35] something
[57:35] that old temper will fly right back up
[57:39] every time that we get into trouble or
[57:41] something
[57:42] it'll just happen again but there is a
[57:46] place
[57:47] help me preach there
[57:50] is a place when a man can come to the
[57:53] time
[57:54] that it will change forever
[57:56] [Music]
[57:58] we we he that will come to me i will in
[58:01] no wise cast him out
[58:03] said jesus a man can come to god
[58:06] and his whole eternal destination has
[58:10] changed
[58:12] a man can meet god and he will never
[58:15] be the same anymore let me just say this
[58:18] to you if you truly meet jesus
[58:25] not a theory not sitting in a church pew
[58:28] but if you truly meet jesus
[58:31] you will never be the same
[58:37] hallelujah well brother ron i i met
[58:41] i met a value of a of a historical story
[58:44] i'm not talking about that
[58:47] anybody can read can get that they can
[58:50] make a mental
[58:51] intellectual birth and and
[58:54] and hang on to that but if you ever meet
[58:57] jesus himself
[58:59] of this day your life will be
[59:02] changed
[59:06] are you with me now you can't be
[59:09] meet god and ever be the same person
[59:12] that you was
[59:14] if you turn away from him you'll be
[59:16] worse than you
[59:17] ever was if you receive him you've got
[59:21] eternal life
[59:22] and he will raise you up at the last
[59:25] days
[59:28] i believe that with all my heart he said
[59:31] when you see the real true principles of
[59:33] the gospel
[59:34] of the lord jesus christ when you see
[59:37] our foundation is sure and solid
[59:40] all the devils out of hell can't upset
[59:43] that foundation
[59:49] hallelujah when you get solid there's
[59:52] nothing the devil can do to shake you
[59:56] i believe there's a place you can come
[59:58] in jesus christ
[59:59] to where it is a saddle fixed situation
[1:00:03] for a
[1:00:03] character
[1:00:07] are you with me now now let me just say
[1:00:11] this to you
[1:00:13] you and i have been here for decades
[1:00:17] we've been christians for decades
[1:00:23] what was the difference between your
[1:00:25] experience
[1:00:26] and the person that may have set the
[1:00:28] pubic side of you
[1:00:30] walking to the same altar and yet
[1:00:33] they're like a yo-yo
[1:00:37] they're back and forward they don't know
[1:00:38] where they're in church or out of church
[1:00:43] they can't seem to break the cycle or
[1:00:46] the chains of their
[1:00:47] original dna
[1:00:50] they're constantly going backwards and
[1:00:53] forwards and
[1:00:54] and constantly got excuses i'm going to
[1:00:56] preach to you today
[1:00:58] it's going to be a real bad day for the
[1:01:00] devil
[1:01:02] but if you truly repent
[1:01:04] [Applause]
[1:01:06] and you truly receive a sanctification
[1:01:09] and a true baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:12] there's no
[1:01:13] going back
[1:01:24] you know you don't have to convince
[1:01:25] yourself do i go to church
[1:01:28] it's just what you do i didn't get up
[1:01:30] this morning sister tara and go now
[1:01:32] breathe ron breathe now breathe now
[1:01:34] breathe but there was a time in my life
[1:01:38] when i was coming off a ventilator
[1:01:40] machine
[1:01:40] after after about three to four weeks
[1:01:43] and there was a nurse in my ear she said
[1:01:46] fight to live fight to live fight to
[1:01:49] live and she was screaming
[1:01:51] you've got to fight to live
[1:01:54] and she was screaming my ear run
[1:01:58] fight to live
[1:02:01] i think that's what ought to be some of
[1:02:03] our altar experiences
[1:02:06] fight to die out to this world fight to
[1:02:09] die out to this world
[1:02:11] satan you don't have dominion over me no
[1:02:13] more
[1:02:14] i'm not gonna be your slave
[1:02:22] hallelujah now watch as he said when a
[1:02:26] man
[1:02:27] a prisoner maybe was under the
[1:02:31] taskmaster of
[1:02:32] of the time of the jubilee and he worked
[1:02:35] under that taskmaster
[1:02:37] and then when that final year come of
[1:02:39] the jubilee then when the priest sounded
[1:02:41] the trumpet
[1:02:42] no matter what he was doing if he was in
[1:02:45] the field hoeing
[1:02:47] and the jubilee sounded then he could
[1:02:50] drop that hope
[1:02:52] and say to the slave driver you
[1:02:55] have no more jurisdiction over me
[1:03:00] i'm going home to my wife and babies
[1:03:05] now if they could say that under the old
[1:03:07] testament under that
[1:03:08] law jesus was our jubilee
[1:03:15] i don't care what your history was this
[1:03:17] morning
[1:03:19] so many people want to give you a
[1:03:21] history lesson over their lives
[1:03:23] i don't need it jesus washed it
[1:03:26] completely away
[1:03:30] it has no more dominion over
[1:03:33] you anymore
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:39] or to be shouting at this church this
[1:03:41] morning
[1:03:42] it's not what i was it's what i am now
[1:03:47] i'm not that man no longer i'm not under
[1:03:50] that dominion
[1:03:51] i'm not married to that husband no
[1:03:53] longer
[1:03:54] first nature you have no control
[1:03:57] over top of my life
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:01] i am married to christ
[1:04:12] am i too loud
[1:04:16] brother branham says he says now you
[1:04:19] become a new person
[1:04:24] not just the old one patched up
[1:04:29] owen patched up by joining a church
[1:04:32] trying to turn over a new page new page
[1:04:36] but you become a brand new unit
[1:04:40] what happened to that guy
[1:04:44] he was this way last week
[1:04:47] and he went to church this week
[1:04:51] give him some time
[1:04:54] just give him some time give him six
[1:04:56] months
[1:04:58] give him a year just let some trials
[1:05:00] come
[1:05:02] and you watch them year by year just get
[1:05:04] stronger and stronger and stronger
[1:05:06] because you realize it wasn't a man that
[1:05:08] was holding on
[1:05:10] it wasn't the personality of a preacher
[1:05:13] but it was jesus himself
[1:05:24] now let's just think of this as a
[1:05:26] marriage
[1:05:28] now i'm i'm getting them some skating on
[1:05:31] some
[1:05:32] difficult territory here just for a
[1:05:33] minute
[1:05:35] but let's just think of marrying jesus
[1:05:42] now we're together we've got a love
[1:05:44] relationship
[1:05:48] it would be wrong for you
[1:05:51] if you're his wife to constantly bring
[1:05:55] up your first husband
[1:06:01] well this is how much fun that i had in
[1:06:03] the in the first with the first husband
[1:06:06] listen your first husband was your own
[1:06:09] nature
[1:06:12] and your choices under your first
[1:06:15] husband
[1:06:15] only took you further from god
[1:06:22] are you with me there were egyptians
[1:06:24] that wanted
[1:06:25] there were there were israelites that
[1:06:28] wanted to go back to
[1:06:29] egypt and they constantly said we had it
[1:06:33] better
[1:06:33] under those taskmasters you noticed they
[1:06:37] didn't go in the new world
[1:06:40] they didn't go in the promised land i've
[1:06:43] got my eyes
[1:06:43] focused on the rapture
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:06:49] listen i don't want to just produce a
[1:06:51] church entity
[1:06:54] [Applause]
[1:06:55] we're not here to produce baptist though
[1:06:57] they're good people
[1:06:58] presbyterian though they're good people
[1:07:01] we're not here to produce another
[1:07:02] denomination
[1:07:04] this is not a halfway house for sinners
[1:07:08] this is a transformation center where
[1:07:10] you come
[1:07:11] as a sin up
[1:07:19] but you don't come and stay a sinner
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:24] and listen you have a right this morning
[1:07:28] to revoke the jurisdiction of satan
[1:07:31] over your life and maybe you've sat here
[1:07:36] for years
[1:07:37] and satan has hounded you and haunted
[1:07:40] you
[1:07:42] with your past tell him that this
[1:07:46] power of this blood has revoked
[1:07:49] all of that and he washed away
[1:07:52] every sin
[1:08:02] true repentance is to turn away from it
[1:08:08] true repentance is to say it's over
[1:08:18] you know in the old testament
[1:08:22] men of incredible faith
[1:08:25] of incredible power of incredible
[1:08:28] position
[1:08:32] desired to live in a body
[1:08:35] that match what god's word would say
[1:08:41] they desired
[1:08:44] not just to go and offer a sacrifice
[1:08:48] but they would no longer fight lust
[1:08:56] imagine it was difficult for moses to
[1:08:58] write about
[1:09:00] being a murderer
[1:09:03] abraham to write about
[1:09:08] being a liar
[1:09:12] and then his son isaac to repeat the
[1:09:14] process again
[1:09:16] you see sometimes if you're not careful
[1:09:18] you'll repeat your father's
[1:09:20] and your mother's
[1:09:23] sin
[1:09:27] brother ron why does this need to be
[1:09:29] preached in the message church
[1:09:30] if we're not careful we'll produce a
[1:09:32] bunch of rotten eggs
[1:09:38] and you're patting rotten eggs all the
[1:09:40] time
[1:09:41] trying to get them in rapturing
[1:09:42] condition
[1:09:44] and let me let me just let me just give
[1:09:46] you a little clue here
[1:09:48] you'll never make a go to sheep
[1:09:56] though there's use for goats you'll
[1:09:59] never make him
[1:10:00] a sheep and the difference between
[1:10:04] sheep and goat is sheep will
[1:10:07] automatically
[1:10:09] produce wool
[1:10:15] they eat it gets this time of year
[1:10:19] and their hair just grows
[1:10:25] many years ago when sister stephanie
[1:10:29] and your sister she here
[1:10:32] there she is they came in there was a
[1:10:35] few others that came in and forgive me
[1:10:37] i'm
[1:10:38] trying to find so about six of you came
[1:10:40] in
[1:10:41] about the same time
[1:10:44] cheerleaders they were coming right out
[1:10:46] of high school
[1:10:49] didn't have a clue about the message
[1:10:54] and i'm talking about from every every
[1:10:57] different walk
[1:11:00] and i'm their pastor and i'm watching
[1:11:01] them come in
[1:11:03] i refuse to preach dress code for six
[1:11:06] months
[1:11:10] i refuse to preach
[1:11:15] i refused to preach on those things
[1:11:19] for about six months because i wanted to
[1:11:22] watch
[1:11:23] god change them
[1:11:26] because so many times ministers feel
[1:11:29] like i'm the one to
[1:11:30] change in them and we've got very
[1:11:34] little to do with it
[1:11:38] are you with me you don't have to beat
[1:11:40] life into someone
[1:11:42] just create an atmosphere
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:46] an atmosphere of real repentance
[1:11:54] brother donnie you could probably count
[1:11:56] on your life
[1:11:57] how many times you tried to make a run
[1:12:00] you tried to
[1:12:01] serve the lord and you would just kind
[1:12:03] of be
[1:12:04] bob but there was a time
[1:12:09] there was a time to where it just
[1:12:12] changed and it was over
[1:12:16] and there was no going back
[1:12:19] and it had consequences
[1:12:22] it had consequences because let me just
[1:12:25] say sometimes
[1:12:26] when you serve god your friends don't
[1:12:28] want no part of it
[1:12:32] can we all say that
[1:12:35] are you with me sometimes our highways
[1:12:38] change
[1:12:48] gabriel i'd like for you to stand just
[1:12:50] now
[1:12:51] i know you're getting ready to leave in
[1:12:52] a minute to go work

[1:13:53] and gabriel he and i you know we've
[1:13:56] always been buddies but

[1:14:02] gabriel was just sitting there and i
[1:14:04] knew something was up
[1:14:06] i was watching for it and i actually
[1:14:09] just said a prayer
[1:14:10] lord let the room empty out to where i
[1:14:13] can deal with him
[1:14:15] and about 15 minutes the room emptied

[1:15:03] in a moment he came and gets changed
[1:15:06] you couldn't change yourself but he
[1:15:08] changed you

[1:15:13] last night gabriel was working
[1:15:16] and he pulled over a boy you never know
[1:15:19] who you're pulling over
[1:15:20] he pulled over a man i'm just gonna if i
[1:15:23] don't do well you just tell me
[1:15:26] and i and he pulls over the boy and god
[1:15:29] just arranged it to where he he looks at
[1:15:32] this stop as a complete different stop
[1:15:35] and he does things that he's never done
[1:15:37] before and instead of walking on this
[1:15:40] side he walks on that side
[1:15:43] he has his identification he's a felon
[1:15:45] the girl's a felon
[1:15:48] and when they come back up he comes back
[1:15:51] up
[1:15:53] the man has a gun under his leg and he's
[1:15:56] getting ready to use it on gabriel
[1:15:59] and gabriel stops it i'll tell you who
[1:16:01] stopped that
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:17] the difference between life and death
[1:16:22] say well brother ron i i don't get much
[1:16:24] out of serving the lord
[1:16:25] how many months had been since the brain
[1:16:27] surgery four months
[1:16:32] six six six months glory to god
[1:16:36] glory to god they found out i had a
[1:16:38] brain
[1:16:42] and he can say god spared my life this
[1:16:45] morning
[1:16:46] that's right this church could be under
[1:16:48] the gloom of another death
[1:16:51] at the hands of an enemy but god spared
[1:16:55] his life
[1:16:57] god bless you brother
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:10] here's where i want to go with that and
[1:17:11] i wasn't going to do it while i'm
[1:17:12] standing here
[1:17:14] he was a different guy six months ago
[1:17:19] he was an egotistical
[1:17:23] it was all about him
[1:17:29] life was free as a breeze and he was
[1:17:31] moving from this station of life to that
[1:17:33] station of
[1:17:34] life and he could find no foundation
[1:17:38] but in a 15-minute window
[1:17:45] in a 15-minute window
[1:17:49] it changed
[1:17:59] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:06] what's burning your heart this morning
[1:18:10] i'm afraid too many people have said in
[1:18:12] church

[1:18:16] talking about in all the places that
[1:18:17] i've preached in my life
[1:18:19] and that's been a few
[1:18:23] and people are just going like like the
[1:18:26] mount horeb
[1:18:27] they're just going in the same cycle
[1:18:29] over and over and over again
[1:18:32] two years that go good and then they're
[1:18:33] out of church for two years and then
[1:18:35] they go good and
[1:18:36] then they're out of church for two years
[1:18:38] i tell you
[1:18:40] sin still got control
[1:18:43] but it don't have to stay that way

[1:19:20] scriptures
[1:19:23] i read scriptures
[1:19:27] i read scriptures like this
[1:19:32] and even as they did not like to
[1:19:36] to retain god in their knowledge god
[1:19:39] gave them over to reprobate mine
[1:19:43] to do those things that's which are not
[1:19:46] convenient
[1:19:47] being filled with all unrighteousness
[1:19:49] and fornication and wickedness and
[1:19:51] covenants and
[1:19:53] maliciousness full of envy and murder
[1:19:56] and debate and receipt
[1:19:58] and deceit and malignity
[1:20:01] and whispers whisperers backbiters
[1:20:04] haters of god despiteful
[1:20:06] proud boasters inventors of evil things
[1:20:09] disobedient to parents and without
[1:20:12] understanding covenant breakers and
[1:20:14] without natural affection
[1:20:16] impossible you meet people like this
[1:20:18] every day
[1:20:19] [Applause]
[1:20:22] unmerciful who
[1:20:26] knowing the judgment of god that they
[1:20:29] which commit
[1:20:29] such things or are worthy of death
[1:20:33] not only to do the same but have
[1:20:35] pleasure in them that do it
[1:20:39] and we live in a laodicean age where do
[1:20:43] whatever you want to do
[1:20:45] lawless society where would we be
[1:20:48] without police officers
[1:21:02] let me get political here just for a
[1:21:04] minute

[1:21:16] anything
[1:21:20] are you with me listen if we get rid of
[1:21:24] police officers
[1:21:25] i'm going to have to put guards down
[1:21:27] here at this gate

[1:21:34] but because we got four or five police
[1:21:36] officers that are not skinny winnie
[1:21:39] the silly jellyfish backbone men
[1:21:42] penny waste
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:55] come on church but we have a society
[1:21:58] that wants to get rid of
[1:22:00] everything in authority yes it made me
[1:22:03] mad when they turned when they tore
[1:22:05] teddy roosevelt
[1:22:06] down this week
[1:22:12] yes five foot five mad from them
[1:22:15] from here to there
[1:22:19] but let me just say this you they are
[1:22:20] tying more than teddy roosevelt down
[1:22:26] they tore him down this down in
[1:22:29] washington a long time ago
[1:22:32] when it's no longer welcome
[1:22:37] we live in a nation that refuses to
[1:22:40] repent
[1:22:41] [Applause]
[1:22:42] but there will be a rapture there will
[1:22:46] be a people that will make a rapture
[1:22:50] that know what true repentance is all
[1:22:53] about
[1:22:56] we're no longer what we used to be
[1:23:01] that is over
[1:23:05] i've told you the story before
[1:23:08] of a friend of mine that came to my
[1:23:10] place to
[1:23:12] to spend some time with me
[1:23:15] and he wanted to tell me about talk to
[1:23:18] me about the old times
[1:23:22] he was a good friend as a as a boy
[1:23:26] he was good friend got me in a lot of
[1:23:29] trouble but he was a good friend
[1:23:34] i probably got him in a lot of trouble
[1:23:37] probably that way better more than it
[1:23:38] was the other way but
[1:23:42] my boys were about 18 to 20.
[1:23:46] and they were sitting there and they
[1:23:47] were listening to a conversation
[1:23:49] and i had prepped them i said eddie
[1:23:52] don't know me as a
[1:23:53] as a christian he has missed the last 25
[1:23:58] years of my life
[1:23:59] and he don't know this ron
[1:24:04] he don't know this guy he knows somebody
[1:24:08] else
[1:24:10] can i use that to preach just for a
[1:24:12] couple minutes
[1:24:14] and when he came in and he sat down and
[1:24:16] we began to rehearse a few things and
[1:24:18] then immediately he went down 10-10
[1:24:20] alley i just let him go
[1:24:24] and he just went and he went and he went
[1:24:26] and he could see that you know his
[1:24:28] energies was wearing out because
[1:24:30] i wasn't reciprocating a whole lot
[1:24:35] and then you know i figured he had
[1:24:37] driven about three hours to see me and
[1:24:39] he needed to get his three hours worth
[1:24:44] and i told him i said eddie i i want to
[1:24:47] tell you something
[1:24:50] the man you're talking about don't live
[1:24:52] here
[1:24:57] now i look like that guy but i'm not
[1:25:00] that guy
[1:25:04] i'm i'm not him anymore this looks like
[1:25:08] the address to the old home
[1:25:12] and that guy that you're talking about
[1:25:14] he died
[1:25:17] he died he died in 1983.
[1:25:21] now he died and we had a funeral for him
[1:25:26] we buried him in watery baptism
[1:25:29] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:25:32] i raised to walk a newness of love
[1:25:36] i didn't have to have alcoholics
[1:25:38] anonymous
[1:25:39] i didn't have to have a rehab center i
[1:25:42] didn't have to go to some psychologist
[1:25:44] someone another
[1:25:45] i met jesus
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:48] and when jesus came into my life all of
[1:25:51] the habits died off
[1:25:53] because light and darkness can't dwell
[1:25:55] together
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:25:57] are you with me now let me just say this
[1:25:59] you heaven is not going to be a
[1:26:02] home full of drunkards dopatics
[1:26:05] prostitutes odometers
[1:26:06] fornicators
[1:26:08] [Music]
[1:26:11] are you with me if i get there and
[1:26:14] that's where
[1:26:14] where all of those kind of people are i
[1:26:17] will have realized i went to the wrong
[1:26:20] place
[1:26:30] i want you to think about this
[1:26:37] it is told that china
[1:26:40] is the one that created or had something
[1:26:43] to do of covering up
[1:26:44] this covet
[1:26:49] and i as a pastor of a church that has
[1:26:51] lost
[1:26:52] incredible pillars to it i'm mad at it
[1:26:58] i'm mad at this disease i don't like it
[1:27:02] none none
[1:27:05] had it fought with it didn't like it
[1:27:10] i think it's a cruel devil from hell
[1:27:14] absolutely do but that thing is under
[1:27:17] our
[1:27:18] feet
[1:27:22] i didn't fear it to start off with it i
[1:27:24] don't fear it now
[1:27:29] so not only is sin under our feet
[1:27:34] but every sickness is under our feet
[1:27:39] they may be watching today
[1:27:43] i'm sure they are but when i visited
[1:27:45] sister meadows yesterday in the
[1:27:47] in the home and i looked in those eyes
[1:27:51] and i could see those eyes just
[1:27:53] just as crystal clear as they could be
[1:27:55] it looked like you could have looked for
[1:27:57] a million miles
[1:28:01] i'll tell you what i didn't walk out of
[1:28:03] that room
[1:28:04] all down-hearted because of the
[1:28:06] situation
[1:28:08] i walked out of that room and around
[1:28:10] that house and i
[1:28:11] and these were my words brother meadows
[1:28:13] satan
[1:28:14] you're a loser
[1:28:26] we don't know how long it'll be but god
[1:28:28] will give her a body that will match the
[1:28:30] look in those eyes
[1:28:33] she'll be young again she'll be shouting
[1:28:36] on the heels of glory
[1:28:39] come on church no matter how sick that
[1:28:42] you get
[1:28:43] no matter how much sorrow no matter how
[1:28:45] much slavery that you've been through
[1:28:48] god's provided a blood that'll take care
[1:28:51] of that situation
[1:28:56] hallelujah when brother ron i say you
[1:28:59] don't have to wait till tomorrow
[1:29:01] right now stake your claim
[1:29:05] i could preach for another half an hour
[1:29:07] 45 minutes or another hour
[1:29:09] but i want to tell you get it today
[1:29:13] you're fighting this and that in your
[1:29:16] life stake your claim
[1:29:18] and look at it and say it's over
[1:29:25] and i want to read the scripture and i
[1:29:26] want you to hang on to it there is
[1:29:28] therefore now
[1:29:30] no condemnation
[1:29:34] hallelujah quit beating yourself for
[1:29:37] your past
[1:29:42] but i made a mistake one time when god
[1:29:45] looks at you through the blood of jesus
[1:29:47] christ
[1:29:48] he don't see it
[1:29:57] now i've come to this point and i'm
[1:29:59] going to drop this before
[1:30:02] i want to give you some advice as a
[1:30:04] bribe believers
[1:30:06] you don't need to know everybody's
[1:30:08] history
[1:30:14] are you with me we have when we're all
[1:30:17] together we have probably 200 maybe more
[1:30:19] than that
[1:30:22] none of you could say that brother ron
[1:30:24] wanted to know everything about me
[1:30:27] when i came here i look at
[1:30:31] pastoring like jesus looks at it
[1:30:38] what you did back there is under the
[1:30:41] blood
[1:30:44] leave it there don't dig it
[1:30:48] up
[1:30:51] leave it there press towards the mark of
[1:30:54] the high calling
[1:30:57] and if it's still bothering you
[1:31:00] repent to death
[1:31:03] repent today and say god i'm sorry
[1:31:07] that i've been carrying this mess on my
[1:31:10] back
[1:31:11] i'm putting it out i'm done with it
[1:31:19] well brother on where did jesus pastor
[1:31:21] well
[1:31:23] he picked a man that was naked on a boat
[1:31:25] cussing
[1:31:28] and said follow me satan would have
[1:31:32] never picked him
[1:31:36] and he picked a woman that was washing
[1:31:37] his feet and everybody in the room said
[1:31:40] if he knew who she was
[1:31:45] but she found the fountain of purity
[1:31:48] and she worshipped she found god and she
[1:31:51] truly repented
[1:31:55] and she was never that woman anymore if
[1:31:58] you'll notice peter was not that man
[1:32:00] anymore
[1:32:01] that woman was not that woman anymore
[1:32:04] the woman at the well
[1:32:05] said come see a man and she would have
[1:32:09] probably not been welcoming any of those
[1:32:11] synagogues
[1:32:12] but jesus being pastor and knowing what
[1:32:15] a predestinated seed was
[1:32:18] he wasn't looking at her past he was
[1:32:20] looking at her future
[1:32:23] i'm not looking at your past i'm looking
[1:32:27] at your future
[1:32:28] [Applause]
[1:32:36] you mind if we finish this next week
[1:32:39] let's stand to our feet
[1:32:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:46] ain't it good to us
[1:32:51] hallelujah ain't it good to us
[1:32:56] cancer you may trying to make me sick
[1:32:57] standing in this pool that i won't tell
[1:32:59] you you're not gonna win
[1:33:01] you're not gonna win
[1:33:10] i walked around my house this morning
[1:33:16] and i just prayed and i called the devil
[1:33:18] by name
[1:33:20] you know generally i don't pray and ask
[1:33:21] the devil to listen
[1:33:26] but this morning i've been sick all
[1:33:28] night
[1:33:30] i knew this sermon needed to be preached
[1:33:33] and i just i just started praying i said
[1:33:35] no
[1:33:36] satan i don't know where you are you're
[1:33:38] not like god
[1:33:40] you're not omniscient you're not
[1:33:41] omnipresent you're not everywhere
[1:33:44] you got to imps every place that you can
[1:33:46] have them and
[1:33:47] you're limited in your power but but i
[1:33:50] want you to listen
[1:33:52] if you keep having this cancer devil
[1:33:54] hang on with me
[1:33:55] and he's got to preach with me
[1:33:59] and he's got to sing with me and he's
[1:34:01] got to go to church if you're not
[1:34:02] careful
[1:34:03] i'll take him to church so long until
[1:34:05] eventually
[1:34:06] he'll either be evicted or he'll become
[1:34:09] a member of the church
[1:34:22] so i think today is a good day
[1:34:25] for him to leave
[1:34:39] sister autumn how long do you generally
[1:34:41] give for eviction notices
[1:34:46] days well we're gonna go before covet
[1:34:49] we're gonna go back to calvary
[1:34:53] let's give him an eviction notice
[1:34:57] my my struggle might be cancer what's
[1:34:59] your struggle
[1:35:02] why don't you just sign an eviction
[1:35:03] notice this morning saying
[1:35:06] you're leaving
[1:35:19] can i tell you one more story
[1:35:28] had two guys that were imposter
[1:35:30] preachers
[1:35:34] and they had came and they had they got
[1:35:36] a room upstairs for a labor day meeting
[1:35:40] and so i went up and asked him i said
[1:35:41] what's your agenda they said well we're
[1:35:43] just going to stay here a couple months
[1:35:44] and that's it
[1:35:45] no he said well we're expecting you to
[1:35:49] take care of us
[1:35:50] i said no
[1:35:54] and i said you need to get packed and
[1:35:56] ready to go
[1:35:58] you know they didn't pay much attention
[1:35:59] to me come here matthew
[1:36:05] and so when i
[1:36:09] couldn't get what i needed to get
[1:36:10] through to him
[1:36:12] i sent him come on
[1:36:16] they came down those steps up there with
[1:36:19] their
[1:36:20] suitcases in their hands
[1:36:24] i give them an eviction warning
[1:36:28] he gave them the eviction
[1:36:33] satan i want you to know
[1:36:38] we're giving you the eviction
[1:36:58] hallelujah and we're going to take
[1:37:01] all of that nonsense and throw it in the
[1:37:04] dumpster
[1:37:07] we don't need it no more
[1:37:13] how are you going to end this brother
[1:37:16] bartimaeus
[1:37:18] was one time known as a blind man
[1:37:22] but after jesus came and walked by his
[1:37:25] way
[1:37:27] he didn't need a cni lamb anymore
[1:37:30] and he didn't need nobody to lead him to
[1:37:32] the wall
[1:37:35] as a matter of fact he didn't even need
[1:37:37] glasses
[1:37:40] now this might interest you a little bit
[1:37:44] you have watched me over the last few
[1:37:45] months change classes
[1:37:48] watch me do it are you wasting your
[1:37:50] money brother ron
[1:37:52] yeah probably
[1:37:57] but you see it was told to restore all
[1:38:00] things
[1:38:01] and so the doctor told me that your eyes
[1:38:03] are getting better
[1:38:06] and i had bought new glasses and it was
[1:38:09] seemed like a little strong and so about
[1:38:12] two weeks ago i went back in some old
[1:38:15] prescriptions that i had
[1:38:19] and because my eyes are being healed i
[1:38:21] don't need them strong glasses
[1:38:30] hallelujah
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:38] i so love you with all my heart
[1:38:41] i so love you i can't wait till the
[1:38:43] rapture
[1:38:45] and we can all be together amen
[1:38:48] oh what a time oh what a time to be
[1:38:53] connie woke me up this morning and i was
[1:38:55] dreaming about resurrection and
[1:38:58] brother homer was with me and john
[1:39:00] frazier was with me and
[1:39:02] others were with me and we were
[1:39:04] overlooking some green
[1:39:05] pastures and we were overlooking and we
[1:39:08] were just
[1:39:09] we were just so rejoicing in it and all
[1:39:11] of us as the church was there

[1:39:34] he good to us
[1:39:36] i so love him i so love him
[1:39:41] now let's just say this to you just
[1:39:44] before we drop it just now
[1:39:47] you don't need a preacher to get this
[1:39:48] fixed that's right
[1:39:53] and because things are the way that they
[1:39:55] are and our boundaries here in virginia
[1:39:57] are the way that they are
[1:39:59] you don't need to come to this altar to
[1:40:01] get it fixed
[1:40:05] i'll tell you how to fix it you have a
[1:40:07] conversation with jesus
[1:40:11] and here's where a lot of things we do
[1:40:14] sometimes we have birth issues that we
[1:40:16] deal with for 20 years
[1:40:18] that should have been taken care of when
[1:40:21] we were young christians
[1:40:24] if you've got a situation in your life
[1:40:28] jesus already knows
[1:40:32] amen you've got a weakness in your life
[1:40:36] and you know you can't overcome it with
[1:40:39] your humanity

[1:40:45] humanity

[1:40:50] on my own
[1:40:51] and i'm going to expose some things that
[1:40:54] you already know
[1:40:55] i need help with
[1:40:59] and allow the god with his sanctifying
[1:41:02] power
[1:41:03] to go down in there and get the roots of
[1:41:05] that thing out
[1:41:09] and die to that thing and let god
[1:41:12] cleanse you
[1:41:14] and then let him fill you with the holy
[1:41:16] ghost his own
[1:41:18] life and then you thank him for it
[1:41:24] it isn't that hard is it it didn't it
[1:41:27] all right
[1:41:28] oh but it's so hard brethren really it
[1:41:30] can happen in moments
[1:41:34] moments seconds
[1:41:37] you can become a brand new person
[1:41:40] and never never be the same
[1:41:44] but it'll take amazing grace i'll sing a
[1:41:47] course of that this morning
