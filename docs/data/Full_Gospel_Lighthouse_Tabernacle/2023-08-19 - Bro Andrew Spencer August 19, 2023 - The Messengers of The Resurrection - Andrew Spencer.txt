and Dad as they have an unspoken request Love In Christ brother Jonathan and sister Autumn there when I continue to lift up her brother brother Donnie Nicholson in prayer that God would just continue to touch him our sister Erica Parker then our pastor that God would just continue to restore his body and strengthen him also our sister Betty Morris as she's dealing with that stage four kidney disease I want to remember our brother Bill Hinkle as he is at home also our sister Linda craiger just pray for her I want to lift up our sister Pearl Berry as she had suffered a stroke and now she is home with hospice so I want to pray for our sister Pearl Berry that God would just touch her body and be with her I mean it would have an unspoken request you'd like to lift up to the Lord this evening amen know God sees each and every one of those requests I'm going to ask our pastor brother Ron would just come and pray over these needs this evening if you would [Music] forward scans went really good this week so we've got a good heart and all of that's working well it became of the reason they do that is the chemo is really hard on the heart and so we we got good scans and then we had a brain scans this week and the doctor's really happy about that we still have two tumors there but it's not spreading and he just he actually just told the other doctor that was in the room with him and said we're family here he said this this is my favorite patient so God's give us good doctors and and we care for them and amen we just know that God's a he's a Healer Amen to give you an idea of why that is so incredible if they would start to spread in 30 days I would have about three weeks to live and so when you get a stable you know when we get a stable report you're really happy to get that stable reporting amen I got a call from sister Sue today sister Sue she she didn't want nobody to know she's kind of secret like secretive like a lot of you here she didn't want nobody to know that she had had hip replacement on Monday she was wanting to leave the hospital that evening but she wasn't able to walk until today because of extreme pain and I don't know you're suffering with sciatica they actually burned that nerve this week and so it's a she has a real need that God would touch her and she wasn't able to sit up until today and they're wanting her to go to rehab and you know for her I'm sure that that's about like me going to the dentist and she wants to go home she wants to go back to work uh she's a pusher that's not that's not her style but when she called me today and said I want you to pray and I want you to take this before the church I said sister to Sue I will do that for you and and so I believe that God hears and answers prayer and she's been faithful to God for all these years and you know we don't see some of these things happening some of the doctors don't see it happening they just expect it to be just a common surgery but sometimes they touch things that shouldn't be touched and so I know a God that's a nerve healer I know that God and and he's a God that hears and answers prayer amen maybe you're standing beside your wife or or a sister and a sister brother to brother maybe just take them by the hand threefold cord is more powerful than a single chord we stand here together and every one of these needs are important I hear my name called here every weekend I don't want to thank you for praying it makes a difference when it's your name when it's your need and I'm thankful that we have a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmity aren't you thankful for that tonight Heavenly Father we bow our heads before you now what a great God that you are the god that said let there be and there was the god that stepped into flesh and spoke to Abraham the God that was born inside of a Virgin Mary Lord and through that vessel of humanity you would touch leopards and even to the point till you will allow yourself to be beaten and bruised with a cat of nine tails you did that that we could be healed [Music] you were wounded for our transgressions and Brews for our iniquities you took the chastisement of peace upon us and by your stripes we can be healed now father we thank you that you're an intercessor that hears and answers our prayers our position as a Son of God and daughter of God never forget my father standing over my bedside when I was paralyzed and as he prayed he said father I am a son of God Lord so that's the way we come to you today we're Sons and Daughters of God and we have positioned in this kingdom here Lord this is not our home but Lord this is where we're at for now Lord I ask you Lord as we appropriate faith for every one of these needs from Brother Bill Hinkle Lord we ask you to touch him in this stage of life Lord every need that was brought up before you brother Donnie fight in this situation that he's been fighting the other needs father sister Sue now Lord the doctors didn't intend to hurt her worse but they they with their hands they're human beings but father you're a great God you can make all things new Lord Jesus I asked you that you would touch her today Lord come by and heal that sciatica nerve father Lord to where that it will just numb to where that she can walk and she can get up and down now God we just believe that we're just we're just believers and we're Believers to the point till we just have faith and faith is that we expect you to do what you said you do now father as brother Andrew speaks tonight he's been away

amen God bless you tonight it's it's good to be back in the house of the Lord with you and and we just we're counted the privilege to be back home and it was it was good to be able to go and to be a blessing where we were where we were sent but there's nothing like coming home and we bring we bring Good Tidings and and we bring good news that the Lord still Reigns throughout all the Earth and we just seen we've seen so many mighty things take place and both there and at brother biscal's brother Tom's camp and just seeing the spirit of the Lord begin to operate and move and you just you just knew you were in a very special spot and and uh it's it's one of my favorite places to go because it's it's my birthing grounds and and then just to see how the Lord got in that meeting speaking that meeting with Brother David Mayer and my we just had a wonderful time in the Lord and Supernatural things happened and then last week we came back home and was able to go to uh true word Tabernacles Ohio Youth Camp there and took about I think it was about 20 25 of us that was that was there at that meeting and and the Lord just did some miraculous things and we've seen we've seen the Angel of the Lord operate and began to move and it was just a special time in the Lord and to see your people get blessed and and you know it just means a whole lot to you and I just shared this one instance and it probably never get told or if I don't but we had something kind of well we had a bunch of Supernatural happen but but there was you know if you're standing on one side and you see you know something's going to happen you you just you're just ready for it and you're waiting for it and the Lord had showed me that sister Carly was going to get a blessing in that meeting and brother Adam and sister Carly went with us and I couldn't have made that meeting without brother adamy he took care of me drove me was he was a great Deacon so you got great deacons here and and I just knew that the Lord was going to do something very special for sister Carly just just give me a little something there and you know and and there was a very powerful moment before sister Carly was able to get into the prayer line there on Saturday night and kind of wiped all of my energy out and it was actually brother Ben Erickson's daughter and uh she just got a refill another Holy Ghost over and over again and it just completely wiped all my energy out and brother the brothers pulled me back and and uh she hadn't she kind of went on there and Carly had done went on and she was praying as well Lord I really like to have brother Andrew there you know you you just it means something to you for her side or or for your side when your pastor can pray for you and so and so she was praying those things that could she could see that I wasn't going to be able to make it back in the line and when they when they told it me off and carried me out like a baby I cried on brother Adam and told him I'm sorry and I really wanted to be there for Carly and uh you know means a lot to you but she came back with the reports like Adam said he was he was praying he was I heard him praying I heard him praying and I was nowhere in the vicinity of where she was but God made us a part of something that we couldn't even be a part of in our own self but she heard me praying and I wasn't even there so God God is a supernatural God and you say well how are you going to explain that I don't have to I serve a god that I don't have to explain but I believe him with every fiber of my being whether I'm in the building or not I know that God's got a benefit for his children and he is going to make sure that it comes to pass so that shows that we're serving a very Supernatural God even tonight I was I'll be honest I ain't talked to brother Matthew about the song service but I just back here Lord I'd really like to have sister Gabrielle sing that song I'm cleansed tonight you know God does all things perfectly and and I'd like to share this this more this portion it's real special to me my daughter Reagan received the baptism of the Holy Ghost last week at Ohio [Applause] [Music] that's what you pray for that's what you pray for as a parent [Music] I don't really care what else comes in life that's everything to me it's everything and so we just we just know that we're serving a living God and and uh we just we just want to go to him tonight and know that he's he's been doing great things we heard wonderful things of the past two weekends and I'm sure proud of our pastor seeing what all he stood through the past couple weeks and then brother Matthew and brother William and I just thought that that our brothers did a phenomenal job in the presence of the Lord and I just can't do anything thank you if you have your Bibles this evening would like to like to look over in the New Testament Matthew chapter 28. Matthew chapter 28 and verse 5. chapter 28 and verse 5 and I'd just like to take a little thought here tonight the Lord's been dealing with us on on The Messengers of the Resurrection messengers of the Resurrection amen amen before we before we read tonight maybe we'll just just speak to the author of the word Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord realizing where we're standing at lord it's a very special spot Lord and we we brought greetings back from the lands that we were in Father we've seen you move and and just begin to pour out your spirit but father tonight we're in a very special spot here and Lord we realize that you are so Supernatural and you are redeeming Humanity by humanity and father you're wanting to work through the preaching of your word here tonight Lord we as men might have might have been a part of these things we might have set up and known and understood that there's a time that we're going to meet but Lord I believe that we're standing in ordained moments Lord Jesus where you could come and you could touch your vessels of of humanity of Mercy father that you could pour out your spirit father maybe maybe knowledge of maybe knowledge of a scripture father maybe just something Lord Jesus and I pray God tonight that the Living God would would just come amongst us father to begin to express his godhead deity through the body of Jesus Christ father Lord I pray God that there would be Supernatural things here tonight Lord we've we we know that you're very well able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think father and I know God that you you have us in your mind father so I would invite you now to come and take the pulpit Lord Jesus and begin to minister to your children father upon the knee needs that they have upon their lives I pray that you would answer their questions and may you go into their future father and secure it by the word of the Lord so father we ask God to you and meet the needs tonight and you'd be both speaker and hearer in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen Matthew chapter 28 and verse 5 and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for He Is Risen as he said come see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him lo I have told you and they departed quickly from the Sepulcher with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word and I I love this verse that we've just read here in verse chapter eight it's it's it's such a beautiful verse and it and it contains the description of the mingled passions of of fear and joy and I know that we're living in an hour where we're dealing with a spirit of fear and but and there we're living in an hour where Joy is being taken away from from God's children but I think it's a very powerful scripture that we've read here tonight that we recognize that there is a mingled passion that is amongst these disciples because they're fearful in one sense because their lord is not there they're fearful because they're talking to an Angelic being but yet there's great joy that is that is that is pushing on the inside of them because they recognize that he's not there and they've just heard an Angelic message that has told them him that he is alive and I'm going to he's going to meet you there so so you see you see that but you watch the expression of their faith that was shown by the running here they ran to tell his disciples that he was alive they ran that's the expression of their faith was to spread the message and as they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying all hell and they came and held him by the feet and worshiped him then said Jesus unto them Be not Afraid go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee and there shall they see me may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as we said we'd like to speak to you on this thought of Messengers messengers of the Resurrection said in the message go tell he said oh there has been great messages he said but Easter capped them all great messages Easter was all of it when the dead was made preparation when that Last Enemy we'd seen sickness healed in the Old Testament we'd seen Miracles performed in the Old Testament and there were Visions come in the Old Testament but every man went right to the Grave wondering would he ever rise again but on Easter morning on Easter morning when the disciples got the greatest message that any man could ever get what did they get go tell my disciples that I am risen from the dead and death had been conquered they had got the greatest message that ever could get got is that the man that had once that had once told that he had power over death Hell In The Grave had now been proven that he was the mighty conqueror now the Bible says here in Hebrews chapter 2 if you want to turn there with us tonight verse 1 it said therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we've heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast in every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which at first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and also with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will and we realize what a messenger is it is one that bears a message or it Bears an air and it is somebody that bears a a verbal communication or it Bears a written communication a messenger is known as a Harbinger or is known as a forerunner or somebody that foreshows something and the Bible tells in Proverbs Chapter 13 and 17 that a wicked messenger falleth into Mischief but a faithful Ambassador is health so a wicked messenger falls into Mischief but a faithful Ambassador is hell so in other words in other words a trustworthy and a wise messenger releases healing wherever he goes and ain't it wonderful to know that tonight that wherever we go we don't have to be bearers of bad news but we can be bearers of good news that we can bring healing with our words we can bring healing with our spirit we can bring healing because we are not messengers of messengers of death we are messengers of life and I think it's a wonderful thing tonight to know that we don't have to go around with a with a spirit of complexities of life not trying to figure out which way to go or which way which way is up or which ways down but we know in whom we hath believed and we recognize that there is healing in the words of Jesus Christ now now anybody can carry news if they're right anybody can carry news but the value in the messenger is the message that he carries you know good and well that you've had thoughts about you've had thoughts about your mailman when he dropped off bills that you couldn't pay you had thoughts about him and you see there but he also carries good things in that mail as well he'll he'll bring you checks or he'll bring you good news he'll bring you birthday card say maybe your grandma put some money in there he is the man that drops off he both drops off good news and he drops off bad news and you've heard the mat you've heard the you've heard the statement don't shoot the messenger you see he's not the one to get mad at he's simply the one that brought the message that came from a higher source or from a Depot's or a or a post where he is supposed to send it out to and you know good and well that there are certain people that are here that that are that are here that would rather have maybe a different delivery company that would or a different Pastor or a different preacher that would come and drop off the mail at their house but because there are some sometimes they're maybe maybe natural companies of UPS or FedEx that that are known for a reputation that they've had missed deliveries in their past reputations but you see you can't you can't blame it on you can't blame it on the man it's just what it's just what is laying there and brother Brandon was very clear on those thoughts in question and answers on the seals he would tell us he said that the church is living off of its past reputations he said but not the bride he said the Methodist and the Baptists and all of them they're living off of their past reputations but not the bride he said they're living under that line time back there he said but the bride is not living under that time you see anybody can carry the message anybody can anybody can pack it or anybody can say that they're a message believer but there's got to be somebody that really believes what the message is now you know good and well that brother Byron would tell you brother Brandon would tell you now if a man shows up to your house and he's got a box of rattlesnakes there he said now are you going to sign for that or not it's up to you so if if the Devil comes to you and he offers you sickness what are you going to do for it are you going to sign for it absolutely not because you are not going to sign for something that you know is going to bite you but immediately how Satan comes in he doesn't show you that it's a box of rattlesnakes he simply shows you something with a depressed word upon it or he shows you something that is of a different angle so that you don't capture what it is but if you sign for them boxer rattlesnakes it's on you is that right if you sign up for it if you simply sit there and and you understand that you understand what you're grabbing a hold of if you understand that you're grabbing a hold of a box of rattlesnakes it's on you if you accept it so if Satan tries to put on you fear or anxiety and and all of these complexes are fear and all of these things that are laying there if you sign up for that and say Satan I want that it's now upon you because now you have taken it as your personal possession is that right you're taking it and you're saying that's exactly what I want but I believe that we're living in an hour where we don't have to settle for what the devil is trying to offer us we don't have to settle for fear we don't have to settle for anxiety we don't have to settle for the things that the world has to offer us because we realize that we are not a people that are living under jurisdiction of Satan but we are under a different Kingdom now you know good and well that God never respected Israel on on what they had been but he only respected them on what they was at that moment that's why brother Brandon would tell us that you've got to have your own experience he said now you can't God does not have any grandchildren because you cannot go in on your papa or your mama's experience but you have to have your own experience is that right you have to have your own experience let's say it together I have to have my own experience amen why don't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise Hallelujah I've got to study in this thought out and I was looking over some things this week and I got I got to reading I got to reading about a mailman that was that was a part of of World War II and what his job was what he what his job was to do was to was to pack the News That's because he's a mailman but he said he began to tell the story about about how important his job was he said my job was not the job to go out there and to fight like the rest of them he said but my job was just as important as the rest of that he said it could have been that he said it was dangerous at times he said but he said it was a job he said it was a job that was all so good because he recognized that his job they told him said now look when we hire you for this position said you got to be the first one off the ship and you got to be the last one on because you got to be the one that gets the mail to where it's destined to go to and what I'm trying to say to you tonight is there is a destiny that is for you there is a destiny for this message and this man this man said he said now he said he said my job was important he said because I was packing the good news I was packing the good news from home and he he would describe it that it changed when he would bring in when he would bring in the mail from overseas or from the Homeland he said it changed the whole morale of the entire company of the harmony of the army that was there he said Bill he said I would watch me and they would take that envelope they would smell it because they would smell the community of Homeland they would look in there and they would see that familiar handwriting and you could watch how that the scripture or or excuse me or how the word or how the word that was sitting that was in that message it had brought and changed the morale it changed everything about them because what did it do it took them to a place from where they hadn't been for so long when they were there on that foreign land and they were fighting over there but a moment in time just reading a little bitty letter from home it changed the entire morale of the fight that they were in and you know good and well what it's like for you when you get in the midst of a battle and all of a sudden and you you remember that you've got some mail that maybe you ain't opened up in a while and you begin to open it up and you begin to look over there and it changes your home morale because you remember even though I am in a battle even though I am in laodicea even though I am in a condition even though I am in this chaos of life but there is a letter that I can open and if I could ever encourage you tonight to open up the message to open up the scriptures and look over there in Psalms 103 that he has not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as high as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy towards them that fear him as far as the East is from the West so far has he removed our transgressions from us ain't it wonderful to know that no matter how far you get and no matter what battle you get yourself into that there's some mail that you can open up when a witchcraft Spirit comes against you when the enemy comes in against you like a flood you can lift up the scriptures look into the mailbag and say it's got my name on it it's got my name on it ain't just for this one it ain't just for Paul it ain't just for David it's for me that's why David would say in Psalms 18 I will love the Lord my strength the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in him will I trust my buckler the Horn of my salvation my high tower I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies the Sorrows of floods and of ungodly men made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell Compass me about the snares of death prevented me but in my distress I opened up this letter him out of stress in my distress when I was in Warfare when I was in trouble when I was in sin when I was in sickness Hallelujah I open up the mail I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even unto his ears ain't it wonderful to know that even though you get in the midst of the Valley of the shadow of death that there is a letter that is there for you that God's anointed you that his rod and his staff is for you let me what am I trying to tell you if you can just grab a hold of the mail it'll change your morale you know good and well if you got the right mental attitude it'll bring the word of God to pass is that right and that's what brother random said about Hattie Wright she had the right attitude she wasn't sitting out there why why didn't God choose me to speak the squirrels into existence why I wasn't there and I hunting that party but she simply was sitting there with the right attitude just like the woman that was a tyronesian woman that had sent there and said Lord my daughter is grievally vexed with the devil she said how can I Jesus said how can I turn around and give God's bread God's children bed over to you dogs she said yeah it's true Lord what did she do she had the right attitude she had the right attitude about it and what did he do he said oh your faith has made you whole if you can get the right attitude about it even though you might be in the valley even though you might be in pain you might had a bad diagnosis you might have had a bad weekend for you with your boss you might have had a bad argument with your wife [Music] well let me open up some more mail Lamentations 3 and 22 says it's of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new Every Morning the Great Is Thy Faithfulness the Lord is my portion my daughter didn't please me this week but the Lord is my portion my husband didn't please me this week the Lord is my portion come on somebody had a flat tire the Lord is my portion what kind of mail are you picking up and reading God is the kind of God that's got a male delivery right for you that'll make sure that you get yourself up pick yourself up and say the Lord here's my portion come on William Bradham lift up your head you ain't got you ain't got a university like Tommy Osborne you ain't got something like you ain't got something like these other brothers or God but remember there was a voice that came by William random's Way I am your portion you don't need what the Lord what the world's got you don't need that kind of Joy all you need the Lord is my portion his mercies are new Every Morning his compassions Fail Me Not if he's my portion I don't care what Obama says what Biden says what Trump says what Putin says what the Pope says the Lord is my portion [Applause] you see well I'm so depressed when's the last time you picked up God's mail come on somebody just go to the mailbox open it up and find out he's a God that's rich in Mercy he's a God That Forgives he said God that heals he's a God that delivers he's a God that sets free well you say I'm in bondage brother Andrew open up the Bible and find out he's a God that loses you from bondage what did this male do it took these men from a miserable spot to a place of hope what if I just told you that these scriptures are powerful enough to change your spiritual altitude you see what you have received in this generation is not a message of disgrace but it is a message of Grace but you see the one that is entrusted to run with a message it shows the Faith from the one who gave the message if he chose you to run with this message he's got something on the inside of you that you know that'll unlock the gate when you get there because you're not a people that have forgot his sayings you're not a people that has run this race and forgot the key you are a people and God if God has chosen you is shows that God trusts you to carry out the message I don't need men's Applause I don't need somebody else to Pat me on my back I don't need I I think it's wonderful to have a companion or have a friend there with you but when you're all alone if God is the one that chose me it didn't matter where John the Baptist when he knew that he was getting ready to get his head cut off because he preached the message God had entrusted him to deliver the mail and the Bible had said amongst women there was nobody that was greater than John but Jesus said that he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he but God had chose John for a specific purpose whoa no notice where did God meet this Forerunner at he met him in the water at the Jordan River notice where the lamb came and met the prophet in this hour the word met the prophet in 1933 in the waters on the Ohio River and said as John the Baptist 4run my first coming so will your message William Branham forerun the second coming of Christ now you know that that happened not just one time but it happened over and over and over again that were meeting after meeting where men would raise up and say as John the Baptist was sent so is William Branham sent one time there was in a cathedral in San Antonio where where William Branham was preaching brother Bynum said that there was a little boy back there a little fella back there God will take anybody and use him to speak he said there's a little fella back there he said he got to speaking in tongues he said that at such a rapid speed he said it was like a machine gun going off and he said all of a sudden he said there was another fellow that rose up right there and said thus saith the Lord that man that's walking to the platform is going forward with a Ministry that is ordained of almighty God as John the Baptist was sent as a first Forerunner of the coming of Christ so this man packs a message that will cause the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ now what am I saying to you I'm saying to you you've already got a message the mail's already been delivered so what are you looking for I'm looking for the second coming this message has this message has interrupted all of Heather Hale's plans this message has upset Satan this message has discharged Satan and told him he's nothing but a bluff foreign of Jesus Christ my grandmother Clara Spencer before she ever knew anything about a Last Day message the Lord had shown her the Lord deal has dealt with a Spencer family through visions and the Lord showed my great-grandmother Clara Spencer William Branham was the man that was going to fulfill Malachi 4. he showed her this before she ever heard the name of William Branham but when my papa Charlie Spencer grabbed the message he grabbed a hold of them only Believe Books you remember of the in the first message he got was the way of a true Prophet you go to studying that out you'll find that brother Branham identifies that as the as the trail of the Prophet that's what he calls it the trail of the Prophet now notice this woman my great-grandmother was on that trail before God had ever seen before she ever seen William Branham and when my papa Charlie had brought a trail of the Prophet had brought it to her and he said I believe this is the message of the hour when she opened up the book there was a picture of William Branham said that's Elijah but for 20 years before it ever seen there was a woman that was on the trail what am I saying to you that you are a people that are on the trail of a prophet what am I saying to you I'm saying it'll lead you right to the second coming of almighty God you don't have to create a new wheel the message is already came you ain't got to have a new thought all you got to do is pack the message brother that's all you got to do young people you ain't got to work yourself up you ain't got to get emotional and say oh I gotta dance like this one I gotta shout like that one just peek pick up the message and run with it and when you pick up the message I guarantee you it'll make you emotional pick it up one time well I don't know about all that emotion and all that dance and all that shout pick up the message one time just pick it up one time let me tell you I was one way but when I got on this Trail I was one way but when I got on this Trail don't Rick try to recreate the wheel pack the message brother that's why William Burnham say just say what the tape say [Applause] because if you start taking away from it what are you doing you're robbing the authority of the word that is there that's why Jesus would say in the in Genesis in the middle of the book and in Revelations he that adds or takes away his part will be taken away from him out of the book of eternal life what is it if you take away from the message if you try to add to the message you are robbing the authority you're robbing the authority of the word all you've got to do Lord I believe it explain it to me all brother Andrew I won't work that way because if you can explain it somebody can explain it away from you but if you believe it against hell and high waters you can stand there against cancer you can stand there against sugar diabetes you can stand there against gout you can stand there against depression you can stand there against criticism and you're going to make it what am I saying to you simply stay with a message run this message that's why William Brandon I love this my brother Brandon is standing there in Tallahassee Florida he said now I want you to repeat this prayer you pray it I'll repeat it you pray it I'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat Satan young people I'm gonna make this real easy for you you take what them tapes say and the pillar of fire will back up with them say I want you to know that I've been serving God I've been serving God for a long time and he ain't never failed me I took what this Prophet has said I took this King James version and every single devil I've ever come up against in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ has got to bow to the name of Jesus Christ I'm telling you that if you can simply set under the message of the hour set under it get under the anointing of the word it'll give you overcoming power now notice he said I'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat Satan right to your lips well you can't fail then can you how can you fail when you got a Vindicated Prophet giving you the overcoming words I'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat Satan right to your lips and then you believe that your confession now you that sick repeat this with me almighty God creators of Heaven and Earth author of everlasting life Giver of all good gifts I your servant confess my sins I believe that through the merits of thy son Jesus that I am forgiven of my sins I am sick and body I need your help Give Me Faith just now to believe your word and to believe these things which I have seen tonight that reproduces your life again as it was yesterday and so it is today now Lord upon this confession I accept my healing and I believe from This Night hits forth that I will be well and I commit myself to you in the name of Jesus Christ how many sick here tonight wow that's amazing I'm praise God let's close the books Let's close let's close the doors laughs I'll tell you what what we need to do is go to RMH and over UVA and get all them bring them right in here it's amazing I don't know if y'all seen that all you streamers out there but everybody in here man I heard a pile A pile of prayer requests before but man they're healed will somebody give a shout out Hallelujah all right let's try this again how many sick all right sick all right I'm gonna show you how easy this is I'm gonna show you how easy this is he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities are you with me the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by his stripes I am healed I'll just transfer the words to your lips that it takes to defeat Satan what are you saying I'm simply saying say What God Says and God will back up what he's saying you don't have to take man's ideas you don't have to take this one or that one you take the authoritative word of almighty God take what God said about ties and God will back it up take what God says about healing and God will back it up take what God says about giving the Holy Ghost and God will back it up you take the word you're a messenger so what I'm saying to you is that what you're carrying is not a dead letter it's a Living Word notice what brother random does here in the Hebrew series he said now we we ought to give the more Earnest heed lest at any time we let them slip for if the word spoken by angels will steadfast he said you hear it he said if the word spoken by angels He said an angel is a messenger the word angel means messenger and just got he said now notice what he does he goes back to Hebrews chapter 1 and said God who in sun-dried times and in diverse manners spoke to the fathers by the prophets he said that was God's Messengers that was God's Messengers and they was God's Messengers and they were God's angels a messenger is an angel an angel or an angel is a messenger so where are we living at we are living in the hour of restoration you know where you're living at it's Joel chapter 2 perfectly positioning the body of Jesus Christ that the canker worm the Palmer worm and the same worm that ate down all the power of the Church of the Living God has now returned to the church so now we're living in the hour of the restoration of the prophecy that is in the Church of the Living God and I know with that it scares Satan really bad when there's prophecy that comes forth from the Church of the Living God you watch immediately if there's a tongue in their interpretation then it becomes prophecy that's when Satan gets real scared right there because it's now it's not just something that we're looking back for or we're looking back but now we have come into the hour of restoration now don't let that scare you don't let that scare you because the Bible tells us that the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy so when you see prophecy coming you are watching the testimony of Jesus Christ I know exactly what I'm talking about a couple weeks ago while I was up here in Canada Cloverdale Bible way I was just breaching away and all of a sudden out of my mouth said come out of these words said today you're going to see a miracle or God's not God now you know what I did here in humanity I wanted to throw my hands over my mouth say what did I just say but I wasn't the one that said that it was the spirit of Prophecy that was working in the body of Jesus Christ these are things that have been returned to the Church of the Living God now don't let that scare you don't let it and it did you can feel it all of a sudden the whole building began to tense up but what did do we watch God back up his word miracle after Miracle after Miracle after Miracle took place so what is it it's the testimony faith of Jesus Christ when you see prophecy coming back to the Church of the Living God who said well I don't know about all this but a new testament Prophet is a preacher so you could take brother William put him behind this Pulpit you can take brother Matthew put him behind this Pulpit what is it a new testament Prophet is a breacher and when you're standing there these brothers take the word of the Living God for this hour put it on their lips transfer it to you it's prophecy what is Satan so scared about is that we as a Church of the Living God go up there and take our gifts off of the shelf and put them to action what I'm not talking to you that you're messengers of death your messengers of the Resurrection everything that my father has for you if it's too high get a ladder climb up there and get your joy back climb a burn get your dance back or to have mercy I wish I had the tongue of Ten Thousand Angels I'd preach to you I'd sing to you and I'd shout to you but Jesus said that you would receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me what is it you are a living messenger of the Resurrection he said you are a messenger this morning you a messenger of good news or bad news oh isn't it beautiful to know that we're ambassadors that we are angels and messengers of the resurrection and we are God's Messengers to a sinful world that Christ lives in our hearts he lives in our Spirits he lives and he brings us from this low-debot's life of sin and exalts us up and gives us a Hallelujah in our soul and makes us new creatures we are messengers angels of the Covenant our glory be to God I don't know I don't know what it's doing to you up there back to everybody I know what it's doing to me in a couple weeks I'm going to preach to you a subject on a reason to rejoice and if you have heard me real loud and clear you've got a reason to Rejoice you are not a messenger of death you're a messenger of the Resurrection I say it like old buddy Robinson Lord give me a backbone like a solo and the courage to step up and be a witness well the world don't want to receive it who cares preach the message well Satan's against me who cares give the good news you're a messenger deliver the mail you can have the same mixed passions fear and joy all at the same time you can have it all together but the word of the Living God was steadfast in Moses the word of the Living God was steadfast in Elijah the word of the Living God was steadfast in Jesus and it'll be steadfast in the Church of the Living God and if you are anointed by the holy ghost that you are God's messenger brother random said if you can receive it you can have it a pardon is not a pardon unless you receive it as a pardon and this message is not your message unless you receive it as your message but if you receive it if you can receive it you can have it what did that woman do that was dealing with that blood issue she had something in her mind that she could receive her healing from that man she didn't need to grab a hold of his leg she didn't need to grab a hold of his head all she had to do was touch a friends of His Garment I don't know where you are I don't know what are you living at I don't know the trouble that you're in but if you can receive it you can have it well the Lord ain't showed up in my mailbox check the mailbox again he ain't showed up for me I've been praying I've been asking I've been living check the mailbox check the mailbox what am I

of the Lord is my strength [Applause] come on somebody I've got every wall woed up against me why don't you shout one time Rahab [Music] [Applause] Rahab was a part of Israel before she ever got out and there was said there was a pile of them that was shouting on the outside but there was one on the inside she had got the message the token was applied she fully obeyed oh you may not see him yet but they shouting on the inside [Applause] oh that's why Jesus said grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption and a seal works on both the inside and the outside when you get good and sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost everything about you sealed you Hallelujah the world's sealed out and Jesus is sealed in and if you got Jesus on the inside he'll work on the outside depression can't hold you same thing hold you pain can't hold you the problems can't hold you I'm talking about everyday living where the whole world where you know you're saved and the world knows you're saved I'm talking about a seal that'll last I'm talking about a seal that Satan can't break I'm talking about a seal the cancer came from I'm talking about a seal that depression and anxiety and every devil in hell you can line it up against a church that's got a seal and it never breaks that seal well what are you saying brother Andrew I got your mail and if you can only receive it you can have it I ain't done yet but can I give you some headlines Satan has lost there's your mail [Applause] you want some more mail Satan has always lost and he'll always lost there's your headline God is on the throne there's your headline God still saves God still loves you God still got healing God's still got resurrection power there's your headline [Applause] well I had news come by my way but I'm here tonight I'm a messenger of the resurrection and I'm telling you that God still got the holy ghost that God's still got to dance that God still got joy that God still gives a holy ghost by the baptism of speaking in tongues oh come on if I was you I'd open up my package and I'd say hey it's mine it ain't rattlesnakes in there let me tell you what the mail says [Applause] still got you on his mind [Laughter] oh he's still got you on his mind now I know you really don't want me to read this one I don't know sometimes you look at the package and you look at the box and you look at it and you're like you know what it's probably just another one of them credit card statements but you remember that woman she living up there she was all poor she was all poor nobody take care of her and they sent the Salvation up her arm after Salvation Army up there and said ain't somebody ain't you got somebody that loves you ain't got somebody that cares for you she's just barely making it by she said well I got a son that lives in a different country and he sends me the most beautiful pictures well can you let me see them pictures and she started opening up her Bible there's a beautiful one start opening up her Bible and what does she have in there she had money orders she didn't even know what she had and maybe you don't understand the package that I'm trying to tell you that you got or the mail that I'm telling you that you got it's a message of resurrection and the message that I got for you tonight is that Satan his power has been stripped that he will prove Satan under your feet and shortly and I'll say this like Wayne Lawson said if Satan ain't under your feet he is out of his position it's time that you put Satan back in his position I got a headline for you devil God still got me on his mind the Rapture still for me the body changes for me Satan all your legal rights have been Stripped Away from you what am I saying to you I am your messenger of Resurrection tonight come on out of it come out of your problem come out of your sin come out of your situation let the blue Hallelujah let the blood do the work well you're not my favorite preacher I don't care what the male looks like open it up God may come to you in a way that you didn't expect him to come to you Peter but he's gonna walk on your water and make a highway out of a Waterway [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah why don't you open up your package or not well I don't know why don't you open up your mail if God be following me who can be against me [Applause] I know where I'm standing at I know what I'm talking about it's for you it's for you what was the whole Bible coming for to express what God had in his entire mind the whole Bible all of these money orders all of these love letters have been there and it's only an expression of what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world that he would have the preeminence in a body and you might have skepticism come you might have criticism come because you're trying to grab a hold of it by faith and say Lord I believe you Lord I accept you and skepticism may come but Noah didn't care about the criticism he didn't care about the skepticism he simply took what God Said in his word and he had faith in what he said and what was Noah doing he was expressing his faith by taking God at his word what was Abraham doing up there when he met Abraham where he met Elohim a prayer and he told him that he was going to bring for the son and when it looked like everything Against All Odds Abraham still believed in hope when there was no hope to be given except 75 years old he still believed that God was a god they would give him a baby at 90 years old he still believed that God was the kind of God that he would give him a baby and in 95 he still believed he still Remembered at 98 he still Remembered at 99 he still remembered but when he turned 100 years old when it come time for the Turning of the century and the message of el shadiyah had showed up what was it Abraham was simply expressing the faith that he had and he was making ready for the baby the whole time well brother Andrew what are you talking about I don't really want a baby but you really want a miracle don't you you got to make ready before it before you see the expression of it and your faith is simply you are expressing your works or expressing your faith you have it I've asked for my mom a long time brother Andrew you can have it I've asked for my healing for quite a long time you can have it I've asked for my daughter for a long time you can have it I've asked for these I've asked for these seizures to go go away you're going to have asked for cancer to stop riddening my family you can have it I've asked for troubles to stop hindering me in my worship you can have I've asked for a complete deliverance you're gonna have I've asked I've asked I've asked I've asked I've asked you have it you can have it you can have it but God didn't put something on you on the inside of you that was a halfway kind of a belief God put something on the inside that was a genuine seed cover up what you got with what the world's trying to hold for you you can't cover it up with some kind of lover out there you can't try to cover it up with sin out there because what God has deposited on the inside of you even though you may hate everything that is laying there in the in the mailbox if it's laying there one of these days You're Gonna open it you you gonna find yourself in a spot and you think I'm never gonna open that I'm never going to open the Bible I'm never going to open a message I'm never gonna believe that I'm never going to look at that Pillar of Fire no more I'm never gonna do that and one of these days You're Gonna Come to yourself you're going to open up the mail and see that it was your name on it all that time amen God didn't put something on you on the inside of you he didn't put something on the inside of you to make you a half-hearted believer he put something on the inside of you as though that you would be fully committed so that you'd be driven you see if you take a half-hearted man that's got no Zeal got no Ambitions got no goals in life you get that man he ain't happy because he can't finish anything and you let that man marry a half-hearted woman ain't got no Zeal ain't got no ambition got no goals got no cares about life lets everything go you let them two hook up and bring forth children they will produce exactly what they are half-hearted children half-hearted people ain't got no ambition ain't got no Zeal ain't got no commitment and what are you doing you are you are producing you are producing what you are so stop sitting around and beating your children for being who they are they're just expressing what they have seen in you well don't shoot the messenger but if you can flip the page and take a man that's full-hearted that's fully committed hook him up with a woman that's fully committed got zealed got ambition hook them up together let them bring forth children they'll bring forth children because they're watching the influence of what they are seeing well blame it on my father it's just who he is what are you doing brother Andrew I'm telling you that you got something on the inside of you that the world ain't got
