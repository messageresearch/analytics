Bauer heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful to come and gather here again once this morning and just so thankful for your anointing that came last night and just fell all across this building and I it's hard for me to believe that anyone that was within the walls of this building could not fill your presence Lord and as brother Andrew came and he just he just preached the anointing and the inspiration that you gave him and I just ask that you would do that once again this morning as our pastor comes and he would just preach the anointing that that falls this morning and even if it takes him off his notes I just ask that you would just anoint the service like never before there's many needs as each and every one of the prayer requests have been read off this morning and Lord Jesus as I would listen to The Prophet just the other day as he would speak he would he would speak about how if we would if we would look back on Noah's day we might as well send our children to just go do architecture do something in the world today but we believe in a god of today and I would and go to say that if we would look back and worship a God and that was back in the 60s Lord we could go and send our children to do the same thing but we believe the god of of today and brother Branham came and he just he showed us the example and showed us that the word is here to live and you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord I just ask that you would just come and you would comfort those that are there with sister Pearl Barry's family as she would go on before the curtain and Lord Jesus we're going to see her again one day and each and every one of our loved ones that have went on before us you've just picked wildflowers and soon one of these days we'll see them come back in their new bodies and we'll transform ourselves Lord Jesus we know what's so close the darkness is all around but Lord Jesus I just ask that you would just light our candle once more this morning and light our candle that we could just shine brighter than ever in this darkness of world that we could just walk out and it doesn't it doesn't take much to walk out in the streets today and see the darkness that's Among Us Lord Jesus I just ask that you'll allow us all to be a living example of you even when even when there's hate all around us allow us to be the one that stands out and shows love to those that may not have love shown to them before for they may be the very last one that may come home Lord Jesus we just thank you for all that you're doing for us we thank you for about what you're going to do this morning through this prayer line and through the service we just thank you for all that you are doing in Jesus name we pray amen amen at this time we'll receive this morning's offering you give us God's blessed you and then as they're preparing to take up the offer we'll have brother Stephen short if you prepare to come sing for us if it would then brother Gabriel Sister Sarah says to Whitney they'll prepare also just a couple announcements after uh for our Labor Day Services we want to remember the times of the services is Friday at 7 Saturday at 6 and Sunday at 11. so won't you just turn and tell your neighbors 7 6 11. and then on Sunday there will be a meal to follow afterwards at Spotswood High School once again like we did last year and then also if we could have our youth and anyone able to park over the hill during the labor day services that would be greatly appreciated saving as much space up top as we can and then also if he wasn't not here last night we had a tremendous service amen so I would suggest you go back and listen to that over and over again but also before the service brother Alden had a little bit of a speech for conduct and church order there so if he wasn't here I suggest maybe go back and listening to that once again and see how to conduct yourself not just in Labor Day services but every service amen God bless you

morning so amen she was drunk and she made gravy and biscuits so I know she was drunk God bless you Katie we love you with all of our hearts and amen we have announced that we're going to have a prayer line at the end of the service and so I want you to just pray about your need as we we do that we generally do this about once a year just before our Labor Day meeting maybe we'll have a prayer line during the labor day meeting but I want to do this for the home folks that are here our visitors that are here and we pray we lay aside time to prepare for this and we just try to get our minds in that channel and so we just thank you for being here wow what services are we getting ready to have I'd like to thank all of the ones that helped with our our cleanup day and our help day it was just amazing I thought what a day it's going to be when we're in that new land and we're all working together and I just thank you for being a part of that and each and every one that came and and brother Alden he did Brother Bill's job he got all the Watermelons together and we ate watermelons and had it running down our arms and our faces and we sure enjoyed that and so we just love you Noah just what kept us going I I need a job I want a job I want to point me to a job point me to a job I didn't know what else to do I just told him I said go see sister Connie she's been doing that 40 years for me [Applause] I turned to brother Kenny and I said in 40 years she hasn't run out of jobs she won't run out of a job for him and so amen so we certainly thank you love you with all of our hearts and I'd like to thank you for all the behind the scenes work that is going on to prepare for the meeting thank you thank you so much and thank you for the people that will park you and put you in your places and then those that will try to get you seated and try to try to accommodate everybody that is here and so uh amen amen amen so we're just so thankful for that sister Peril Berry we were able to see her just before her homegoing the day before she left and and of course many of you know that she was she had had a stroke and she was out of it hadn't been able to speak for quite a while I hadn't actually even looked at anybody in any way we walked into the house the other day with sister Loretta and her eyes came open popped open I was able to talk to her and I said Jesus is getting ready to walk into this room and going to take you home now don't you be afraid he's coming you've lived the life preparing for it Loretta her daughter we had led her to the Lord sometime back and she said I want to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I told sister Pearl I said sister Pearl your daughter wants to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and tears started running down her face and so we're just so thankful for that our hearts are sad because she's went home but our hearts are joyful we wouldn't dare want to bring her back into this world she's she's a young lady now she doesn't she doesn't have to worry about sickness or anything like that they will have the visitation tonight at six o'clock so if the service is over you're welcome to go and so it it will be at Johnson's funeral home at Bridgewater and then tomorrow the service will be at two o'clock at the same place Johnson's funeral home at Bridgewater brother Andrew and myself will be taking care of that service and so if you would remember us in prayer amen I would like to thank you for all the birthday wishes we made it we made it and made another birthday and so we're just thankful for that so thankful thank you for all the cards and the well wishes and everything and you just don't know what that meant for me to turn 62. because I looked very much like a president that lived and I very much loved him because of a lot of things that he did creating national parks and things and actually your Social Security that you get he was one of the creators of that and he wasn't able to Institute it and so his name was Theodore Roosevelt Teddy we call him and that's where your teddy bears come from but but anyway he lived to be 61 and you can imagine how many times the devil whispered in my ear through my 61 period but I made it so we're just thankful for that amen so we'd like to thank you and maybe we can find 63 in our in our future if the Lord don't come back and and take us home and so amen thank you for all your prayers through this this lengthy process and you know he said if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before and so I don't know particularly how long this trial will be but he's in control of it and so you know I just put it all in his hands amen maybe we just like to have a need before God and say Lord I'd like for you to touch me today Heavenly Father we love you today the songs have been sung the prayers have been prayed our hearts are gathered around your word we've not come to see a man but we've come to see Jesus that's what we've gathered here for Lord as we prepare to go into this meeting today and after last night Lord I'm so thankful for what you did here Lord we ask you that you would touch brother Andrew today and strengthen him Lord touch our bodies as the things that we're fighting even today we ask you that you would touch us Lord every hand that is went up across this place we ask you to send your word to their Pew where they're sitting Lord sister Erica Reagan that is in such a or parker that is in such a fight we ask you to touch her today Lord and we we just pray for the ones that are home brother Roger and sister and the many others that would love to be sitting here Lord would you just send your word and heal them in a special way the many that watch us by the way of Internet we pray that even wherever they watch this I Pray whether it's in a car whether it's in their home whether it's on their job whatever it is Lord I pray that the Holy Spirit would come in a special way Lord Brother George Quinn that is watching this afternoon he and his family we pray that you would touch them Lord and Lord we just ask you that you'd come by we surrender ourselves to you now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen amen like to let you know that brother Timothy Pruitt will be speaking on Friday night brother Tim Pruitt will be speaking on Saturday evening and then brother Donnie Reagan will be speaking on Sunday morning so we're looking forward to that then then we have brother George Quinn that's going to come for us and you hear that brother George this is your home this is your home so we're looking to have him brother George Quinn he'll be here in October looking forward to having him if you would turn with me to Mark chapter 16 and verse 15. I'd like to speak to you today and I'll try my best to be as brief as I can but I want to drive the point on the creative cell from his bloodline amen Mark chapter 16 and verse 15. now this is his these are some of his closing words to his most Inner Circle and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues and they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you may be seated and we say Amen I'd like for you to read this portion of scripture with me Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 1. and we will read right down through verse 5. and I want you to read it with me if you will who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was on him and with his stripes we are healed can we read that last verse again but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed if you'll notice there's no time stamp date there of expiration that was not Isaiah's words that was the spoken word of God Isaiah was a prophet which is a Seer he was the mouthpiece of God he would write it down under direct inspiration of God so this is God's word to you and I wounded for our transgressions 800 years before he would take those stripes at pilate's judgment Hall bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed I want you to think about it not only as Believers we believe it but Satan he can read as well he should have known it was coming but he couldn't stop it I want you to just think about those things how powerful that they are this brother of casteth out all fear and when fear is gone faith is perfect I love that don't you when fear is gone faith is perfect and he swore by himself he said now listen I'm going to say something look faith is unconscious he said I've learned that through the years of travel around the world and meeting people of all different kind of walks by faith but faith is unconscious you got faith that you don't even know about Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and the Gale was knocking the boat from one side to the other and he was standing in the face of demons he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and as quiet as he could be he was simply unconscious of fear whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so I love that don't you and you're here today to fulfill it as well just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or to the left hand just walk and just keep moving on if something comes into church walk with God if sickness strikes for you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God and just keep walking with God Enoch walk one day one day walk like that and you know what he's done he walked all the way home with God he got so far up the road he didn't come back anymore I love that don't you walk with God the doctor tells you that you're going to die walk with God the doctor says you can't get well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he looked and he took an oath and by that Covenant he'd give it to you that he confirm it just walk with God I think that's so powerful now notice he gives us some just down home advice you're going to have to go through your ups and downs you're going to go through some Briar patches you're going to go over some sharp rocks over some Bluffs down on the hillside up on the mountains over Waters but walk with God you're going to have to go through all of that but just keep walking with God that's the song says there's so many Hills to climb he said upper you've heard that old song but how little it'll seem when you get to the end of the way this world is kind of what you would call silly stuff Hallelujah another man said brother and sisters he said we have an abstract title deed we have an abstract title deed tonight to Salvation and to Divine Healing and the devil has no rights trust God and the Holy Ghost to put him out he said I feel religious tonight somehow I really do he said notice God has promised it and God's obligated to take care of it and this blood cell where he formed moved into the womb and covered himself over with his own creative blood cell he said brought forth the son Christ Jesus the blood cell was broken at Calvary and the blood round down over his body in order that he could bring back into himself Fellowship well who does he want to have fellowship with uh I like that don't you his blood did not come from any mortal man but it came from the creative power of Jehovah God his father he was divine he proved that when he broke the seals of death and Rose up the third day he proved it I like it when God decides to prove his own words Tyler good to see you today now we're not saved by Blood of a Jew or the blood of a gentile we're saved by the blood of God and we say Amen he was God and it was nothing else he wasn't a Jew and he was an egyptah God's creative blood in him we become if he was a Jew or a gentile we're all lost he was God In the Flesh I don't worship a Jew I worship God I worship Jesus Christ I don't worship some fiction or some kind of a historical something I worship Jesus Christ the presence of Jesus Christ right now which is his word that's manifested in this age I like Hebron how he brings it up 2 000 years now his manifested word in this age that's what we're worshiping we're not worshiping the prophet that God veiled in that's not what we're worshiping we're worshiping Jesus Christ the message was not the message of William Branham it was the message of the Lamb now Jesus was the fullness of God's word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and in him dwelled the fullness of God God lived in Jesus Christ God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not a Jew nor a gentile but God there's he stood making himself how fitting and God's own blood had to shed upon the ground from the innocent blood of Abel on down to the innocent blood to redeem us he didn't take his own life he didn't even hold his own life he said father if it's possible let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done now I just I'm just sharing a few quotes with you and no doubt as I read Isaiah 53. and we just told you that when the word is spoken Satan's always close but isn't it amazing that he can't stop God's word from being fulfilled now he's on his way for a resurrection and a body change for rapture this message has been telling us that you are going to get a physical body change now we can look back to Abraham and Sarah and we can remind the devil there was nothing you could do to stop that we can remind him that when Jesus came to hell and he had the keys and he told him he said give me the keys so Satan knows today he's just the bluff he don't have the keys to his own house he don't have arrows for his own bow and throughout the seals as they're being revealed day by day he can't stop the seals from being revealed and we know once the seals are revealed there's a bride's Revival that's going to be released on the Earth and it's going to have results to it because when the prophet dies the message isn't going to die it's going to spread through all the world and people of the character of the word is going to be produced you are the living physical attributes of God you're the ones that was in the Lamb's Book before the foundation World God took a picture of you at your best are you with me now and then you were manifested in flesh through your mother and father but that wasn't your origin I love my mom and dad but that wasn't my origin the real me came from the Lamb's Book so that means that you are the spoken word seed of God that means that you are the mystery of Jesus Christ in Bride form that means that you are people of the open book we're not a church we're not just a gathering of people we are the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I want you to give the Lord a hand right there brother Jason once we catch that Revelation there's nothing that the devil can do to stop us once we catch that that Revelation that we realize that we are as Eternal as Jesus Christ is eternal I'm trying to behave here at the first but I want you to realize once you catch that you are the spoken seed of God that that the devil can only go so far with you he can make you sick he can make you Afflicted he can get in your spirit and contaminate you get you nervous get you your temper riled up he can only he can go through your Affliction through your affections he can go through your emotions but he can't not get to that seed of God [Applause] he cannot get there now watch this now Satan watches this message go forth and this message has exposed him so now you become a threat to his kingdom now I'm going to say that again so you catch this Satan watches this message going forth as long as it's just in book and take form it doesn't bother him whatsoever but once it comes in flesh Silver and Gold Have I None are you catching this Upper Room didn't bother the devil whatsoever but Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk once this message becomes action once it becomes action and it's living on the earth you become a threat can we say that you are Satan's worst nightmare oh turn to your neighbor I want this to come from your lips I am Satan's worst nightmare how many has ever had a nightmare you got a nightmare it's okay it's okay because of the chemo and a lot of the drugs that I'm on and the seizure medicines it produces nightmares I am absolutely thrilled to wake up I am thrilled to wake up whether it's five o'clock six o'clock whatever time it is I actually slept over this morning I'm happy and so so when I wake up I am so happy so happy that that wasn't reality I am so thrilled Satan can't wake up from this nightmare Glory now you're a threat to the kingdom so we realize that as he watched brother Branham speak just as he watched Jesus speak and he contested Jesus he contested brother Branham he contested us as ministers the fivefold of this message you know there's something that he can identify the voice that was in Jesus he watched that voice say Let There Be I want you to catch that and the voice in Jesus said I have power to lay my life down and power to take it up again I and my father are one though your sins be many you are forgiven who would be the most thankful Simon the one with sins many so I want you to just notice and I want to drive this in a moment in a moment by the spoken word from God she went from a harlot a defile woman a womb that had many seeds in a moment those desires left her and sin dissipated and she was not that same woman anymore that voice behind The Voice no doubt Satan watched Three Squirrels be spoken into existence no doubt he watched the storm literally turn and go back he watched as Hattie Wright said that's absolutely the truth brother Branham now I want you to just notice just for a moment she had said in his church all those years and now she's going to take the voice behind the voice and let that boy speak through her and she's going to operate the third pull she could have had millions of dollars she could have had her sister healed but she asked for the Eternal part she went past first pull second pull she she asked for something that was eternal and she asked for her two boys now listen she bypassed sexual desire and ask for something that was Supernatural her two boys she spoke eternal life to her two boys and there was nothing Satan could do to stop it Billy Andrews stood on this platform many years ago danced all over the place and he said if he said if there's not but two boys in heaven I know who's two boys that that will be Hallelujah now remember when Moses was standing there and it was crying to God brother random is using this sermon for an example to the Bride of Jesus Christ what are you crying to me for speak why are you crying why are you looking at the temporary situation speak you got to go over there speak and go over Stretch Your Rod out across the sea it had never happened ever before and he stood there and stretched his Rod across the sea and what happened an impossible situation became possible they did not walk across in mud two million people begin to take steps the water wind came and separated the water [Music] it was a voice that was behind The Voice it did not make Moses God but there was God living on the inside [Applause] your flesh you're a flash that you fight your flesh and your spirit that contends with you but there's a God on the inside of you that controls your flesh and controls your emotions so don't look at your temporary situation don't let it give you the moly groups you do not have to be prisoner in your own body now notice God is in his word and I've already read to you that he's obligated to back his word up and he'll prove it now Satan is always standing near trying to defeat the plan of God he's always real close trying to defeat the plan of God but notice this message makes such bold statements it's beyond human understanding I've been working on this message for a little while so you can tell it this message is the creative word of God it is the manifested word because it has produced a manifested people now the vision of that boy in Finland was two years in the making so if we can say that many of our lives many I tried to preach this is Sister Connie from one sofa to the other sofa but let me just say a lot of these events have been decades in the making they're decades in the making and here's a boy lay on the ground crushed by a car somebody has driven that car somebody's made a a decision to drive down the road at a certain time here's a boy and now he's laying on the ground but God's got a provision way before they've ever heard and maybe never heard of William Branham but God's got a vision that this boy is going to come off of the ground and be totally healed now I want you to just think about this is what I want you to get not just back on his feet but 100 percent healed he hasn't heard the seals he hasn't heard the way of a true prophet he definitely hasn't heard that anointed once at the end time but God is going to take a creative word notice what he says if he's not off of the ground in five minutes you call me a false prophet come on people that want to fight the message today where was you at where was you at people that want to fight it in our day in our area listen you can't stop this church for those that left it didn't stop this church I'm gonna say something very distinctful here and I mean it too sometimes God has to throw the seed in the air and sin went through it to get the trash out of it brother wrong bear you calling those people trash brother Branham called the world fodder fodder people that are actually giving you trouble situations on your job situation let me just say don't get yourself too carried away Don't Let It Blow weeks and months away they are fodder their fighter Fighter for the burning I want that to settle because they turned down the creative word of God now this message is the is the Breath of God it's the Breath of God now I want you to just think about the power of statements and I just want to I want to get you I want to catch your attention the power of a statement and just to kind of get you to a point to where that I'm just going to bring in a carnal realm first there was a man that stood at Gettysburg and he spoke for two hours two hours before Abraham Lincoln spoke two hours 99.9 percent of us don't know his name and don't even know what he spoke but the man after him was Abraham Lincoln a tall man over six foot tall very Slender the war had created much stress in his life now Abraham's looking like an older man but he's a Statesman there's a sermon that has come from Spurgeon to actually actually stir his heart it's time to end this thing and actually from that sermon he called the nation to pray he actually called the nation to pray that this war would end how profound that was we actually live in actually the Bread Basket of that war families against families Terror against each other brothers fighting Brothers Listen families turmoiling but let me just say prayer changes things and he stood and gave the Gettysburg Address which is known as one of the greatest addresses that there's ever been spoken I could care less where you're a Republican or where you're Democrat but let me just say this to you this man was the man for the moment and from that moment our nation began to heal there would be a lot of other skirmishes there will be a lot of other Wars that take place but from that moment he spoke it and released words that would bring healing to our nation when this message was spoken by our Prophet it was telling us that the bride is on the scene and God is announcing in the astronomic heaven he's showing that the infant bride is on the Earth and if we were in our infancy when the prophet we must be in our maturity as we stand here today this message has brought results notice in just a statement I have power to lay my life down and power to take it up again did he prove it give me the keys to death Hell In The Grave did he prove it father forgive them my kingdom is not of this world go thy way and sin no more in a moment from those words those people were never the same ever again brother on that happen when Jesus was here but what about when God speaks to your life and you walk into this building and you have vowed many times I'm going to make a change I'm going to make a change but when God supernaturally touches your life Mary when he supernaturally touches your life and that seed is born on the inside of you under the right atmosphere under the right atmosphere you're forever changed you may live in the same house you may live and look like the same guy but there's a new King on your heart no man did that no Jew did that no Gentile did that no preacher did that God did that [Applause] Mary believe the angel what he spoke to her she was going to get water and she met Gabriel she walked to that place of Virgin she walked away pregnant be it unto me according to Thy Word from that moment from that testimony she was hate can I drive it from the moment she walked she was in the scriptures Behold a virgin shall conceive D she never got a sermon that you're the girl but when the angel met her and told you told her what his salutation was to be that God was going to produce on the inside of her the creative blood cell of God I want you to think how profound this is From This Moment every sin since Adam was put on notice it's over it's over can you imagine the blood of bulls and goats that blood could produce Rivers but it can only cover sin but this Blood this spoken word blood this just a small amount of sales that was inside of her womb couldn't revoke the jurisdiction of Satan forever never beat yourself over the back for what the sins that you did before because once this blood takes a Colt in your life you're not the same person anymore this creative blood you walk to an altar and you're filthy of sin you're sitting in your car you're on your couch and you invite Jesus into your heart and you feel a supernatural touch whether you feel him or whether you don't it's not about your feelings it's not about your an even your your emotions Mary felt nothing she didn't that she didn't shout she'd felt nothing she just said be it unto me according to Thy Word and it was nothing Satan could do from that point Satan knew he saw the angel listen people around didn't see the angel but he did and Satan could link the scripture up but now he couldn't stop it I'm preaching to you now I want you to get this you'll walk down that aisle in a little bit walk down Sick walk down unsaved walk down backslidden but in the right moment in the right moment Rebecca you were pleading for the Holy Ghost but this morning you can say it I got it [Applause] two weeks ago Aaliyah was praying at the altar with hundreds of others and the Lord told me to go to her and I went to her and I went to her again and I went to her again on the fourth time he spoke to me and said you you wait there and the door is going to come open and I began to pray and I began to watch when God sends you he's on business and that thing got broken in her life that thing got broken in her life and she walked to that altar one way and she walked away different and on Saturday night she got the Holy Ghost because flesh had been conquered you got to die out to yourself God's not going to live in a contaminated vessel You Gotta Die out to yourself first of all you got to doubt to yourself and that old slave masters Gotta Die that first husband's got to die you got to be Sanctified and then God will fill you with the Holy Ghost that's what his word is and then he seals you into the day of redemption and you say well brother Ron I can't hold on you're forgot the purpose it's not you holding on it's God holding on to you brother Branham would stand there before people and he said you have cancer and I'm just going to take care of a demon right here well brother Ron you pray for people then they go to heal what about your faith listen the gift lays in the body and many times it's not for this one it's for you brother random suffered with diseases all the way to the end of his life he suffered every seven years but how many people came back to life how many cancers got delivered how many tuberculosis how many as simple as athlete's feet how many people got healed and delivered and set free take that handkerchief off of your head sister she was standing in a phone booth take that handkerchief off of your head go out there and lay it on your husband's stomach and God will heal him from that stomach disease brother Brandon was thousands of miles away it don't make one bit of difference you may be listening to this service and be thousands of miles away you take God at his work and in a few moments you'll be totally healed now this blood cell that we're talking about is without sin this blood cell can heal every disease this blood cell can forgive every sin of your life it can reverse the curse of sin that is hanging over top of you and you this doctor that we're seeing today you don't have to sit in his waiting room for days and hours at a time in a moment sickness spiritual attacks attacks from a demonic Realm you know it must baffle Satan one moment ate up with cancer and the next moment a hundred percent well do you believe it do you believe it now think about this one moment ate up with cancer and the next moment healed one moment full of sin and the next moment a saint of God one moment 90 years old and here in the word nothing is impossible and in moments a woman so beautiful until the king wants her can I can I get your attention you're the people you're the Lamb's wife not just a service but you're the Lamb's wife that is destined for a change now can I just can I just have a few moments here America is destined for war with Russia they're destined you could put Federalists as a president Independence in his precedent you could put Biden back in in president you'd be an idiot but you could put Donald Trump back in president and I'll repeat that verse that I just said to you my trust is not in Donald Trump it's not in Joe Biden my trust is not in none of these guys it's not in any of them this nation is cursed because a prophet stood here and said it was cursed this nation is headed for war this nation is headed for war there's nothing you and I can do to stop it a man named Putin has been destined to do what he's going to do the pope is destined to do what he's going to do but we are destined we are destined we're destined we are destined we're destined to get a body change they're destined the words the spoken word that you are receiving through a prophet through preachers you're listening to the voice that is behind the voice it's not talking to your flesh because your flesh will be tired at times it'll be weary you'll get up and have a bad morning and you'll walk in brother on how do you know that I was laying in a condition to where I was non-responsive I had been burned I was been a coma I was non-responsive it was like the light went out and my last thought before being non-responsive I thought this must be what it's like to die no doctor on the Earth would give me a chance but there was a man walked into this pulpit and he preached two sermons called God's Hall of Fame and he preached another sermon called God will have a testimony and for over 15 years I've stood in this pulpit and proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ because there was a spoken word cell how many of you were in this church when brother Tim Pruitt preached that sermon God will have a testimony you heard it he'll be speaking here next Saturday night and I want you to just think about this I'm not just having these men because they're my friends we're at in a moment in time you walk into this service expecting the supernatural catch of God I'm going to say something I'm going to take it a little bit deep here for you you just catch your breath but these are the best of the best of the best of of all of time [Music] I want you I don't want you to say oh it's brother Tim or oh that's brother Donnie don't you get into that carnal Realm you see past their flesh you see past Andrew you see past brother Ron you see past Timothy Pruitt you see past him through it you see past Donnie Reagan I want you with that seed on the inside of you to hear the voice of God foreign we're dealing with more than covet we're dealing more than just an earache or a toothache or or a cancer listen we're talking about a body change I want you to be in condition in the moment [Applause] you watch these sermons come to pass in your life [Applause] some of you will lose a hundred pounds just like that some of you get hair back just like that don't get mad at me I'm telling you what your body's going to do your wrinkles are going to go away your back is going to straighten up I'm talking about the creative cell of God creative cell of God that is spoken to your GNC on the inside of you it's going to respond Hallelujah this is much greater than a caribou this is much greater than a silver tip grizzly bear this is much greater than a storm [Applause] the body of Homer Frazier is laying in a tomb founder of this church that God spoke to to build this place he's not laying in that to him that's a body he's standing in a well body but he longs to come back to this realm everything he preached he can't wait his father his mother his family stands in that realm and I'm only just picking them out just now my father my mother not gonna be it's not going to be caskets rolling out and getting open not gonna be Angels digging their bodies out of the ground they're not there that's a house they lived in God's Gonna raise them they're going to step a half step this way we're going to take us half a step that way [Applause] by the creative blood cell of God how powerful are these services brother duck can tell you how powerful they are one moment he was dead and one moment he was alive probably one of the strongest families in this church is The Meadows Family but that man was on his way to commit suicide and the creative blood of God stopped him and here he sets 90. two 91. think about that and in a moment Young [Applause] brother random is standing I want you to think about this power of a statement little fish I give your life back to you brother Ron I didn't see it it don't matter brother bam killed two squirrels and the other squirrel he couldn't find the devil wrestled with him all night long even to the place that he went back and he couldn't find it thinking it would be in a certain spot and he wretched into a hole can you imagine what it felt like when the tail he felt the tail of that squirrel and the devil had wrestled with him all night because of the spoken word of God he'd spoke it where it would be and he shot it and it ran into a hole and the devil devil wrestle with him I'm coming to an end he wrestled with him all night thinking it's not going to be but he knew what that creative power was one two three and now he can't find that third one and the devil's wrestling with him he's wrestling with him he's testified now the devil's wrestling with him now even others are questioning things but when he got a hold of it can you imagine the devil you have the table in your shop that they ate those squirrels on brother Chris won't you stand it's a trophy it's a trophy no eternal life in it but it's a trophy you can lay your hands on it talk to the same God that lived on the inside of William Brown I pray for this business I pray for my family I'm talking to you now you have a divine right by the cell of God that transformed your life you have a divine right of God to call upon that abstract titled deep that blood cell of God come on that blood cell of God that lives on the inside of you God can't turn himself down [Applause] well brother Ron when's the Rapture going to don't let that devil wrestle in your ears there's still some seed of God that's got to come in we cannot leave them here we can't leave them here it has been spoken I'll not leave one I'll not leave one you have prayed for your loved ones the Rapture can't happen it will be divinely orchestrated it's on its way [Applause] as a matter of fact the Rapture is already in progress It's happening in you [Applause] [Music] Oh Glory Oh Glory I want to just say this bit unto me [Applause] cancer listen to me according to Thy Word but brother on the MRI shows are still there the MRI says

that seed is not your not up to your flesh Rebecca you're standing right behind him you wanted it you wanted it you wanted it it happened last night there will be many more feelings and if you didn't feel anything it doesn't matter you didn't shout you didn't dance you didn't speak in tongues that ain't that don't matter but that seed comes to life there'll be feelings to where you do shout feel as to where you do speak in tongues feelings when you feel his presence the blessings will come down the main thing is when you approach the king he accepted your life can I say it [Applause] sitting up to a preacher yeah I should not put a man listen up to the fickleness of a human being God has broken it so shall it be and I want to make a declaration Satan you can't stop it [Applause] every vertebrae in my back was broken everyone I fell 40 feet and landed on concrete everyone the sciatic nerves were shattered they said I'd never walk again my father walked into my room and I'm gonna

at our table and we just start chatting and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord came and he began to talk about the impossible job he began to talk about the things that he was trying to get and I felt the presence of God drop I said let's claim it right now listen I didn't care if the president of the United States of America was sitting there we had a higher authority than that and we began to pray and the spirit of the Lord went around that table and all of us was crying and we began to claim that job I want to say it in that moment he went from claiming it to getting it [Music] now
