[1:12:28] stimulates us amen it's what gives us
[1:12:31] hope this morning amen without the word
[1:12:35] of God where we wouldn't know where
[1:12:36] we're at we wouldn't know what what kind
[1:12:38] of condition we're in but thank God

[1:13:14] the Bible amen that has anything in it
[1:13:17] that can help us oh it might help us in
[1:13:20] our desk and our our task and our daily
[1:13:22] jobs and our daily uh routines and all
[1:13:25] of that but it cannot give us e eternal
[1:13:28] life amen but this word that we're
[1:13:31] speaking about this morning that we want
[1:13:33] to hear that Faith might be built in our
[1:13:36] hearts it is a living manifesting word
[1:13:40] amen and it's the true preaching of the
[1:13:42] Gospel of Jesus Christ amen now I want
[1:13:46] you to realize this morning it's the
[1:13:48] quickened word is where God's people are
[1:13:51] called to this morning do you realize
[1:13:53] amen that you know there there's
[1:13:55] churches across the land today and
[1:13:57] around the world Amen that they preach
[1:14:00] as brother Josh Bennett preached
[1:14:01] yesterday at the tent meeting amen
[1:14:03] they're preaching traditions and dogmas
[1:14:05] of men but I'm so glad this morning amen
[1:14:09] that I'm not bound up in a bunch of
[1:14:11] traditions amen I'm so glad that God
[1:14:14] didn't give us a bunch of traditions to
[1:14:16] make it in amen thank God he give us a
[1:14:19] living word amen that can transform our
[1:14:23] lives this morning and and make a new
[1:14:26] creation out of us amen now I want you
[1:14:29] to
[1:14:30] realize God has done a wonderful thing
[1:14:34] in that he brings his word in
[1:14:36] Seasons amen a and we realize that a
[1:14:39] true man of God that's called in a
[1:14:42] certain season or a certain time amen
[1:14:45] he'll only preach the word that's given
[1:14:48] in that season and For That season now
[1:14:51] there's a lot of preachers out there but
[1:14:53] again they're preaching traditions and
[1:14:55] dogmas and and rituals and formalities
[1:14:58] amen but brother do we we have a message
[1:15:01] today amen that is a living reality of
[1:15:05] Jesus Christ in this hour amen and I
[1:15:09] believe this morning you have ministers
[1:15:11] here amen that that's the kind of God
[1:15:13] they preach about that's the kind of
[1:15:15] word that they live before you this
[1:15:17] morning amen now the prophet of God
[1:15:20] would tell us in the message God's
[1:15:22] provided way of healing he said now we
[1:15:24] can preach the word we can explain the
[1:15:27] word but you have to receive the word
[1:15:32] amen oh Hallelujah he says that's what
[1:15:34] sets it a fire brother when you receive
[1:15:38] it the Revelation something slips out of
[1:15:41] the Unseen World y under it comes
[1:15:43] rolling down through a mystical Channel
[1:15:46] somewhere into your soul amen that says
[1:15:49] now I see
[1:15:51] it amen your eyes brighten your lips
[1:15:55] that hung down they straighten up and
[1:15:57] smile every muscle in your body seems to
[1:16:00] Rejoice something's going to happen amen
[1:16:04] you don't need to be in a prayer line
[1:16:06] then you've got it amen and I believe
[1:16:08] this morning that's what we need in this
[1:16:10] hour amen it's some more divine
[1:16:15] revelation how do you get it by the
[1:16:18] hearing of the word because that builds
[1:16:21] faith in your heart for God to come down
[1:16:23] and speak to you this morning morning
[1:16:25] amen and give you what you need now what
[1:16:28] we want to realize is that there is an
[1:16:32] inspiration in the Revelation for this
[1:16:35] day and that inspiration in that
[1:16:38] Revelation is what brings stimulation in
[1:16:41] our hearts amen and causes us this
[1:16:44] morning to react to the word of God and
[1:16:47] not reject it but react to it amen
[1:16:51] receiving into our hearts and allowing
[1:16:53] that word to tr transform us into the
[1:16:57] very image of Jesus Christ this morning
[1:17:00] amen now Daniel 12 and verse 9 it tells
[1:17:04] us as God uh began to show Daniel things
[1:17:07] and visions and so forth amen and Daniel
[1:17:10] was trying to understand it and figure
[1:17:12] it out amen but the the the spirit of
[1:17:15] God said to him seal it up amen because
[1:17:19] this is not available or not for this
[1:17:22] time it's for the time of the end
[1:17:26] amen now I want you to realize this
[1:17:27] morning how many believes we're living
[1:17:29] in the end time we're not in the
[1:17:32] beginning of the church ages we're not
[1:17:34] in the beginning amen of time we are in
[1:17:36] the fullness of
[1:17:39] time well praise the lord we are at the
[1:17:43] ending of the Gentile
[1:17:46] dispensation amen we're at a time where
[1:17:49] just any day now the Lord Jesus is going
[1:17:51] to come and receive us unto himself amen
[1:17:55] he went away but he but he promised if I
[1:17:58] go away I'll come again and receive you
[1:18:01] unto myself that where I am there you
[1:18:05] may be also amen and I'm looking for
[1:18:07] that promise to be fulfilled just any
[1:18:10] day now amen because the scripture tells
[1:18:13] us in Revelation 10:7 but in the days of
[1:18:16] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:18:19] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:18:22] should be finished as he hath declared
[1:18:24] to his servants the prophets now Daniel
[1:18:27] received uh uh some inspiration he
[1:18:29] received some Revelation he received in
[1:18:32] in symbol form amen he couldn't
[1:18:34] understand it amen or couldn't detail
[1:18:37] what it was but God said save that seal
[1:18:40] it in a book because it's for the time
[1:18:43] of the end but I want you to understand
[1:18:45] if God sealed it for a certain specific
[1:18:48] time then let me assure you God is going
[1:18:50] to reveal it in the set time that it's
[1:18:53] designed for and I believe this morning
[1:18:56] that's what God has done in Our
[1:18:58] Generation by sending a word Prophet
[1:19:02] this
[1:19:02] morning amen not just another uh uh you
[1:19:06] know Prophet from the fivefold ministry

[1:19:29] I S
[1:19:31] unto you how many yous do we have here
[1:19:34] this morning amen so the word that God
[1:19:37] sent through that Malachi 4 Ministry it
[1:19:40] was for me this morning amen and the
[1:19:44] things that were preached through that
[1:19:45] Ministry it was for
[1:19:48] me now you all can put your name in
[1:19:51] there if you want to but I am declaring
[1:19:54] to you this morning that message that
[1:19:56] God has sent in this day it was sent
[1:19:59] directly to me this morning brother
[1:20:01] Shannon amen and by the grace of God
[1:20:04] Amen when I heard that amen I know it's
[1:20:08] real because it was quick to my heart

[1:20:13] my dad was in the meetings he said in
[1:20:15] about 21 or so different Services where
[1:20:18] brother Brandon preached amen and heard
[1:20:20] the voice of God speak through him amen
[1:20:23] but I'm not following this message
[1:20:25] because my daddy did I'm not following
[1:20:27] it because I heard it all my life I'm
[1:20:30] following it because it has been a
[1:20:32] divine revelation to me brother Andrew
[1:20:35] and this message is going to change my
[1:20:38] body amen because this message is
[1:20:41] nothing less than Jesus Christ the same
[1:20:45] yesterday today and
[1:20:47] forever amen it's not a dead message
[1:20:50] this morning it's a Living Word of God
[1:20:54] Amen that's going to transform us and
[1:20:57] translate us into another
[1:21:00] dimension
[1:21:04] amen now the scripture tells us in
[1:21:08] Psalms
[1:21:10] 102 when the Lord shall build up Zion he
[1:21:13] shall appear in
[1:21:16] glory now we realize this morning amen
[1:21:20] that this church that God is building
[1:21:22] amen he's not going to build it to get
[1:21:26] the church's Glory but he's going to
[1:21:28] build it to give himself Glory because
[1:21:32] he said in his word I will not share my
[1:21:35] glory with any man amen so he's not
[1:21:38] doing it to give any preacher Glory he's
[1:21:41] not doing it to give any ministry glory
[1:21:43] this morning he is building a church for
[1:21:46] his name sake this morning amen and and
[1:21:49] he's living in that church that that
[1:21:52] church might display amen a living God
[1:21:56] this
[1:21:57] morning amen now we realize down Through
[1:22:00] the Ages the Dark Ages it seemed like
[1:22:03] the church had died out it seemed like
[1:22:05] there was nothing there it seemed like
[1:22:07] it was just going to fade away amen but
[1:22:09] then we see a Revival Amen on the zeusa
[1:22:12] street the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:14] amen and then we see the prophet of God
[1:22:16] come on the scene and begin to declare
[1:22:19] thus sayeth the Lord and begin to uhh
[1:22:22] catch the revelation of the word of God
[1:22:24] as God began to open it to him and allow
[1:22:28] him to see amen and catch that
[1:22:30] Revelation let me tell you this morning
[1:22:32] amen when I sit and listened to the
[1:22:34] prophet of God and hear and preach on
[1:22:36] the seals of the church ages hear and
[1:22:38] preach on Amen zakus the businessman
[1:22:41] hearing preaching on Amen the the the
[1:22:44] faith cometh by hearing amen and you
[1:22:47] hear those things and recognize today
[1:22:49] amen that those messages they're not
[1:22:52] sent to the denominational world
[1:22:55] they're not sent to the churchianity
[1:22:57] group this morning they are sent to the
[1:22:59] Bride of Jesus Christ amen and I I I I
[1:23:03] hear the prophet say I believe God has
[1:23:06] allowed me to to to deliver a message
[1:23:09] that will dress the bride Amen in the
[1:23:12] wedding Garment of the word amen not a
[1:23:15] not a garment of silk and fashion of
[1:23:18] this world but a wedding Garment of the
[1:23:20] word this
[1:23:22] morning amen and not only that but
[1:23:25] through that Ministry through that
[1:23:27] visitation God has United the bride and
[1:23:31] Christ this morning amen and we have
[1:23:34] become one with
[1:23:36] him now if I preach anything contrary to
[1:23:38] what your pastors do amen you talk to
[1:23:41] them afterwards and listen to what they
[1:23:43] tell you I don't believe I will
[1:23:47] though now the scripture said Brother
[1:23:50] David that in John 12: 24 verily verily
[1:23:54] I say unto you except the corner wheat
[1:23:56] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[1:24:00] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[1:24:03] much fruit now I want you to realize
[1:24:05] down Through the Ages it seemed like it
[1:24:07] was dead seemed like it was dried up
[1:24:09] didn't seem like God was doing anything
[1:24:12] amen but I want you to understand also
[1:24:14] this morning amen that at the right
[1:24:17] season amen at the right time amen that
[1:24:21] word began to germinate it began to come
[1:24:24] back to life amen why because the life
[1:24:28] was in the seed and the seed is the word
[1:24:32] of God this morning amen and when that
[1:24:34] seed comes forth what's he going to do
[1:24:37] it is going to produce fruit this
[1:24:41] morning well brother Joe where's that
[1:24:45] fruit I'm looking at it this morning you
[1:24:49] are what this message is
[1:24:53] producing you are why God sent this
[1:24:56] message amen now uh that one grain of
[1:25:00] corn I know some of you in here are
[1:25:02] farmers and plant a little Garden or a
[1:25:04] big Garden I don't know which but
[1:25:06] anyways whenever you plant that and you
[1:25:08] row you plant one or two kernels of corn
[1:25:11] one or two kernels of corn one or two
[1:25:12] kernels of corn amen but when that grows
[1:25:15] and produces an ear of corn how many
[1:25:19] kernels are on the three or four five
[1:25:21] years that's on that one stock coming
[1:25:23] from those one or two to seeds this
[1:25:25] morning and I want you to realize what
[1:25:27] looked like was nothing what looked like
[1:25:29] was just lost amen thank God this
[1:25:32] morning it has produced a bride amen
[1:25:35] Universal around the world this morning
[1:25:38] that is standing for the true word of
[1:25:40] God and she will not accept Creed she
[1:25:43] will not accept Dogma she will not
[1:25:45] accept traditions of men because why she
[1:25:48] is a word seed bride this
[1:25:51] morning amen
[1:25:55] now we realize God deals with Israel as
[1:25:59] a nation and he has dealt with her and
[1:26:01] give her an opportunity amen and she
[1:26:04] turned him down she refused to accept
[1:26:07] him she said away with him crucify him
[1:26:11] amen let his blood be upon us and upon
[1:26:13] our children and let me tell you they're
[1:26:15] still battling that today amen but thank
[1:26:18] God Amen God because she rejected the
[1:26:23] word of God because she turned him down
[1:26:26] God said I will have a bride amen and he
[1:26:30] turned to the Gentiles amen and because
[1:26:33] he turned to the Gentiles that's why you
[1:26:36] and I can sit here this morning and
[1:26:38] rejoice in the word of God realizing
[1:26:42] amen just like Ruth and Naomi amen when
[1:26:45] they they their husbands died and they
[1:26:47] went back as poppers as Beggars amen
[1:26:50] basically having nothing but thank God
[1:26:53] this morning amen men when she began to
[1:26:55] glean in the field of Boaz amen after a
[1:26:58] little while he recognized her amen as
[1:27:01] that wi woman that came back with Naomi
[1:27:04] and he understood amen she's not here
[1:27:07] amen just for no purpose but God has a
[1:27:10] plan this morning and I want you to
[1:27:12] realize you may be the off scaring of
[1:27:14] the world they may not think much of you
[1:27:16] but I want you to understand God thought
[1:27:19] so much of you this morning that he
[1:27:21] forsook his own people because they
[1:27:23] reject Reed him and he came and he found
[1:27:26] you this morning
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:35] Hallelujah they turned him down amen
[1:27:39] they they rejected him brother Joel amen
[1:27:42] but there's something in the true bride
[1:27:44] of Jesus Christ that was for ordained
[1:27:47] and predestinated amen to be a part of
[1:27:49] the bride of Christ in this hour she
[1:27:52] cannot turn him down
[1:27:54] because she is bone of his bone flesh of
[1:27:57] his flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of
[1:27:59] his life amen and she is one with him
[1:28:03] and she had that representation before
[1:28:06] the foundation of the
[1:28:11] world
[1:28:14] oh they saw Israel saw the manifestation
[1:28:19] of the Son of
[1:28:22] God right they saw the son of man stand
[1:28:28] there reveal the secrets of the hearts
[1:28:31] they saw the son of man the Lord Jesus
[1:28:35] they saw him heal the sick raise the
[1:28:37] Dead cast out Devils they saw him do all
[1:28:40] those Mighty Works among them but yet
[1:28:43] there was nothing in them to believe
[1:28:47] it they rejected it they turned them
[1:28:51] down but then the scripture tells us in
[1:28:54] Luke
[1:28:55] 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day
[1:28:59] when the son of man is revealed now that
[1:29:02] was the son of God he called himself the
[1:29:04] son of man amen and then they turned him
[1:29:07] down but then God has a revealing of the
[1:29:11] son of man in the last Gentile
[1:29:14] dispensation Amen in the last agees
[1:29:17] morning amen and because there's
[1:29:19] something inside of the Bride this
[1:29:22] morning amen something in side of the
[1:29:24] people that make up the bride amen they
[1:29:27] will accept that and they will receive
[1:29:30] that this morning because they recognize
[1:29:33] it not a little Kentucky hillbilly about
[1:29:35] 135 LBS or so amen that's not who it was
[1:29:39] it was God Almighty amen the son of man
[1:29:43] himself amen revealing himself through a
[1:29:46] son of
[1:29:48] man is this all right amen but they they
[1:29:54] they had something in them to recognize
[1:29:58] that as I said my dad was in 20-some
[1:30:02] meetings or services that the prophet
[1:30:05] preached and the first service that he
[1:30:08] was in he never hurt brother Bram
[1:30:11] Minister never seen him in all of his
[1:30:13] years he he he heard Allan and Co and
[1:30:16] Roberts and osbor and all the great
[1:30:18] names up and down the East Coast
[1:30:20] listening to all of them he said but
[1:30:22] when I said
[1:30:24] in the auditorium and brother bam came
[1:30:27] through the door before he said evening
[1:30:31] friends dad said I found myself just
[1:30:34] Weeping at the presence of God that came
[1:30:38] with him listen that wasn't William
[1:30:41] brandham that was the god that walked
[1:30:44] with him and stood by his side around
[1:30:47] the world Amen and and dad said when I
[1:30:49] got my composure I looked around and
[1:30:52] everybody around me was in the same
[1:30:53] condition I amen and from that time amen
[1:30:57] 1956 dad began to follow the ministry
[1:31:01] and the teachings of the prophet of God
[1:31:03] because he recognized there's more than
[1:31:05] just a a a denominational evangelist
[1:31:09] amen there is something behind that
[1:31:11] Ministry amen that declared Jesus Christ
[1:31:15] the same yesterday today and forever not
[1:31:18] just by words but by actions this
[1:31:21] morning by the life of Jesus Christ
[1:31:23] Christ being manifested through that
[1:31:26] gift through that Ministry this morning
[1:31:28] and I believe amen not only did it work
[1:31:31] through that man and through that
[1:31:33] Ministry but it's working through the
[1:31:36] bride of Christ in this hour because
[1:31:38] listen this morning we're not preaching
[1:31:41] another
[1:31:43] message we're not led by another spirit
[1:31:47] amen we have the same Holy Spirit when
[1:31:50] brother Bron was taken off the scene
[1:31:52] many of the preachers that dad was
[1:31:54] associated with called him brother green
[1:31:56] what we going to do the prophet's gone
[1:31:59] uh we we have no leader and and not that
[1:32:01] he was a bishop or a leader or anything
[1:32:03] in that regard amen but he had thus
[1:32:05] sayith the Lord amen what are we going
[1:32:08] to do brother green the prophet's no
[1:32:09] longer with us he's dead amen the dad
[1:32:12] said we got the Holy Ghost we've got the
[1:32:15] message that he brought we got the word
[1:32:17] of God Amen and so listen this morning

[1:32:35] men are don't follow them follow the
[1:32:38] Christ that lives inside of them this
[1:32:41] morning because the Christ will not lead
[1:32:44] you astray the Christ will lead you to a
[1:32:47] body change this morning the Christ will
[1:32:49] translate you into another world this
[1:32:52] morning

[1:32:57] it they can preach the word and build up
[1:33:00] your faith this morning but they can't
[1:33:02] change your
[1:33:04] body amen but the god that they preach
[1:33:06] to you about that God can do it this
[1:33:10] morning let me give you a little secret
[1:33:12] that God will do it if you believe the
[1:33:16] promises of the word of God and accept
[1:33:18] them into your heart this morning
[1:33:24] job would pray chapter 14: 13 oh that
[1:33:29] thou wouldest hide me in the grave that
[1:33:32] thou wouldest keep me secret until thy
[1:33:35] wrath be passed that thou wouldest

[1:34:30] said why don't you curse God and
[1:34:35] die listen this morning the devil don't
[1:34:38] care who he Lo
[1:34:40] uses he'll use the love of your life to
[1:34:43] get you all out of
[1:34:45] sorts if they let him but that's why we
[1:34:48] all got to keep our mind stayed on him
[1:34:52] so that we don't yield oursel to the
[1:34:55] devil this morning amen but job
[1:34:57] recognized amen he saw all the flowers
[1:35:00] and and the trees and all amen go
[1:35:02] through their cycle of Life they raise
[1:35:04] up then they die out go back to the dust
[1:35:07] of the earth amen and job realized amen
[1:35:09] I you know what happens to a man amen
[1:35:12] and when he dies does he just disappear
[1:35:15] and never uh to return again but then
[1:35:18] job called a
[1:35:20] revelation amen if a man die shall he
[1:35:22] live again amen and job called a amen
[1:35:25] even though the skin worms destroy my
[1:35:28] flesh yet in my flesh shall I see God
[1:35:31] job was looking ahead to a time of
[1:35:34] Resurrection amen when Jesus Christ
[1:35:36] arose and led captivity captive and
[1:35:39] brought amen the souls that were that
[1:35:41] were in in in
[1:35:44] in lost the word amen in in the place
[1:35:47] that the the dead went to at that time
[1:35:50] amen he and he led them out of there
[1:35:53] right he St snatched the keys of death
[1:35:57] hell and the grave from Satan and set
[1:35:59] them free amen they were seen in the
[1:36:01] streets of Jerusalem amen for many days
[1:36:04] there as as the time for his Ascension
[1:36:07] came amen and as brother bam talked
[1:36:09] about Abraham and Sarah walking through
[1:36:12] the old city looking and seeing what was
[1:36:14] there and how it had changed and all
[1:36:16] those things amen then somebody
[1:36:18] recognized that looks like what I've
[1:36:19] heard Abraham looks like let me tell you
[1:36:21] this morning I'm looking some for my dad
[1:36:24] to come and sit down at the table with
[1:36:26] me I'm looking for brother Dan to come
[1:36:28] I'm looking for brother Homer you to
[1:36:30] call me and tell me brother Homer I saw
[1:36:31] him this morning amen why because I
[1:36:34] believe there is coming another
[1:36:36] Resurrection amen where the dead in
[1:36:38] Christ shall rise amen and then after
[1:36:41] that we shall all be chained in a moment
[1:36:44] in a twinkling of an eye caught up
[1:36:46] together to meet the Lord in the
[1:36:52] air oh
[1:36:56] that set time that job was looking for
[1:37:00] it came he was resurrected and he was
[1:37:03] received up to to the Lord there as the
[1:37:05] the scripture talks about but I want you
[1:37:08] to understand this morning we have a set
[1:37:10] time that we're going to be changed the
[1:37:13] dead are going to rise amen but there's
[1:37:15] also a set time for the word for this
[1:37:19] dispensation amen and I want you to
[1:37:21] realize this morning this is the time of
[1:37:24] the favor of God God is looking for men
[1:37:28] who will yield themselves and let God
[1:37:31] preach through
[1:37:35] them you know
[1:37:40] sometimes sometimes you
[1:37:42] have well it's like our camp meeting we
[1:37:45] have in August which by the way your
[1:37:47] your pastor has committed to preach part
[1:37:50] of that meeting along with brother Josh
[1:37:52] Bennett this year so hope you can make
[1:37:55] it
[1:37:58] amen but anyways when it comes to camp
[1:38:01] meeting you know everybody's wanting to
[1:38:03] know who's going to preach tonight Who's
[1:38:04] going to preach this service in the
[1:38:05] mornings when the missionaries speak
[1:38:07] who's going to preach this morning and
[1:38:09] my response is the Holy
[1:38:13] Ghost now what vessel he uses amen he
[1:38:17] maybe he hadn't told me at that time and
[1:38:19] I'm just waiting for the direction amen
[1:38:22] but but what we want today is Holy Ghost
[1:38:25] L men that can get themselves out of the
[1:38:28] way and let the Holy Ghost do the
[1:38:32] preaching many times you hear the
[1:38:34] brother say the preacher's here this
[1:38:36] morning and he ain't talking about the
[1:38:38] man standing here he's talking about him
[1:38:41] amen now God looking for those men that
[1:38:44] will step aside and let God use their
[1:38:48] voices let God use their their tongues
[1:38:50] this morning now we got to realize what
[1:38:52] God is is doing in our day and what he's
[1:38:56] doing in the word amen he's giving an
[1:39:00] impact and an effect Upon Our Lives now
[1:39:07] I I've been here enough over the
[1:39:10] years and I've I've watched your
[1:39:13] services I appreciate them so very much
[1:39:17] but I I I've seen the
[1:39:20] growth thank you and I've seen you
[1:39:22] people come coming in new people moving
[1:39:25] in amen and and and what what is
[1:39:29] attracting you to come here it's not the
[1:39:34] man welcome brother I feel like I'm a
[1:39:37] part of the family
[1:39:40] here it's not the
[1:39:45] man it's the god that works through the
[1:39:50] man and it's the word that God pre
[1:39:53] preaches through the man that's what is
[1:39:56] drawing you the power of a resurrected
[1:40:00] Christ the life of Jesus Christ that is
[1:40:04] manifested through the preaching of the
[1:40:06] word and through the life that is lived
[1:40:09] this
[1:40:10] morning so we got to recognize what God
[1:40:12] is doing so that it may have an impact
[1:40:16] and an effect Upon Our Lives if we don't
[1:40:20] recognize it you know I use the
[1:40:22] illustration sometimes
[1:40:24] I pull out a certain piece of money and
[1:40:27] I I I say I'm going to give it
[1:40:30] away I'm not going to do that this
[1:40:31] morning so don't get
[1:40:35] excited I don't say who I'm going to
[1:40:38] give it to I'm going to give it
[1:40:41] away I'm just waiting on somebody to
[1:40:44] catch the
[1:40:46] Revelation so if it's a $20 bill whoever
[1:40:50] catches the Revelation that I'm going to
[1:40:51] give it away comes and gets it and if
[1:40:55] you know the rest of the church don't
[1:40:57] catch the Revelation they're still
[1:40:58] sitting in their seats but the one that
[1:41:00] caught the Revelation comes and gets it
[1:41:03] you understand what I'm
[1:41:05] saying that's the way it is with the
[1:41:08] things of God this morning you've got to
[1:41:10] catch the Revelation that God has made a
[1:41:13] way and that God has sent a message for
[1:41:17] you this morning amen and that that
[1:41:20] message will bring you to a trans
[1:41:26] ation
[1:41:27] now do you realize this morning that the
[1:41:31] Saints of old desired to hear what you
[1:41:36] hear they longed just like Daniel he
[1:41:38] wanted to know what what was given to
[1:41:40] him in that in that symbol form he
[1:41:43] wanted to understand it he wanted to
[1:41:44] catch that Revelation but God said seal
[1:41:47] it up because it's for the time of the
[1:41:50] end maybe he he caught some glimpse of
[1:41:52] it and understand understanding of it
[1:41:54] but God said it's not time for that it's
[1:41:56] it's for a later season amen now when
[1:42:00] when Jesus came and
[1:42:02] he preached his little sermonette if you
[1:42:05] will Amen in Luke 4 the spirit of the
[1:42:08] Lord is upon me Amen to preach the
[1:42:12] gospel and so forth amen what Jesus did
[1:42:16] he being the word brother Randy he
[1:42:18] recognized himself in the word
[1:42:23] yes yes sir and he declared himself in
[1:42:28] the word to the people amen now they
[1:42:31] didn't catch
[1:42:35] it but he
[1:42:38] knew he knew his position in the word of
[1:42:41] God and I believe this morning that's
[1:42:43] what God is trying to get us to is to
[1:42:47] understand our position that's why I ask
[1:42:50] you how many yous do we have in here
[1:42:53] because when you recognize that that God
[1:42:55] sent a prophet just to
[1:43:00] you you know how much I believe God sent
[1:43:03] a prophet to me so much that if I was
[1:43:06] the only one that needed to hear what he
[1:43:08] had to say God would send him for
[1:43:12] me oh brother Joe that that's putting a
[1:43:15] lot of emphasis on you no it's not it's
[1:43:17] putting a lot of emphasis on
[1:43:19] God keeping his seed and protecting his
[1:43:22] seed and bringing them what they need
[1:43:26] for the hour in which they living in now
[1:43:29] listen he's he's he said here the spirit
[1:43:31] of the Lord is upon me to preach the
[1:43:34] word of God to set at Liberty the
[1:43:36] captive and so forth amen and and I want
[1:43:39] you to realize until that time amen it
[1:43:43] took a sounding of a trumpet to declare
[1:43:47] Liberty the children of Israel under the
[1:43:50] law of of Moses amen the Old levitical
[1:43:53] Law amen when they had their their Year
[1:43:57] of Jubilee and the trumpet sounded it
[1:44:00] didn't matter what they were doing amen
[1:44:02] if they were hoing the corn or or
[1:44:04] thrashing the wheed or plucking The
[1:44:06] Grapes off the vine or the olives
[1:44:08] whatever it was amen when they heard
[1:44:11] that amen they recognized there is a
[1:44:17] liberty I've been serving this man I've
[1:44:20] sold him my uh my property and
[1:44:23] bound myself to serve him for all this
[1:44:26] time but now whether it was one day or
[1:44:28] 49 years 364 days amen they were
[1:44:33] bound under that rule amen under that
[1:44:37] bondage and they couldn't go free but
[1:44:40] when that trumpet sounded let me tell
[1:44:42] you it didn't matter brother William
[1:44:44] amen what they were doing they
[1:44:46] recognized the sound of Liberty amen and
[1:44:50] when they heard that trumpet blowing
[1:44:52] listen they threw their hole down they
[1:44:54] threw the rake down they throw their
[1:44:55] their seats down or whatever tool they
[1:44:58] were using and said I'm free I'm free
[1:45:01] thank God I'm free and they went back to
[1:45:04] their possession back to their
[1:45:07] inheritance amen but oh let me tell you
[1:45:09] Jesus said amen that I've come to set at
[1:45:12] Liberty them that are bound amen and
[1:45:15] until that time it was it was the old
[1:45:17] levitical trumpet sounding amen but I
[1:45:20] want you to realize now the gospel of
[1:45:23] Jesus Christ is the trumpet that we need
[1:45:25] to hear today amen because that is what
[1:45:29] set you free from your sins that is what
[1:45:31] called you out of sin bondage this
[1:45:33] morning that is what has given you
[1:45:35] Liberty amen and I want you to realize
[1:45:38] today what's the difference between you
[1:45:40] and all the rest of the 8 billion people
[1:45:43] plus up on the face of the Earth that
[1:45:45] don't even acknowledge
[1:45:48] God you know what the difference is you
[1:45:52] have accepted your
[1:45:58] Liberty you have accepted what God has
[1:46:02] given you this morning amen and when you
[1:46:04] heard the sound of Liberty what did you
[1:46:07] do thank God I'm free I'm free I'm free
[1:46:10] amen thank God the Liberty wherewith
[1:46:13] Christ hath made you free this morning
[1:46:16] and by that freedom thank God you're no
[1:46:19] longer bound to denominational ideas
[1:46:21] you're no longer bound to to the
[1:46:23] traditions of men thank God you are free
[1:46:26] and you walk in the liberty of the word
[1:46:28] of God this
[1:46:33] morning and I got good news for you John
[1:46:36] 8:36 said if the sun therefore shall
[1:46:40] make you free you shall be free
[1:46:46] indeed
[1:46:50] amen couple years ago I'd been
[1:46:53] over in South Carolina to the hospital
[1:46:55] there to visit a brother that had some
[1:46:56] surgery and I was coming
[1:46:59] back and I was just thinking about the
[1:47:01] brother and the situation praying for
[1:47:03] him as I was coming down the road there
[1:47:05] and all of a sudden on the side of the
[1:47:08] road said uh said a brother
[1:47:14] Gabriel some of you'll catch it some of
[1:47:16] you
[1:47:17] won't but brother Ronnie when I come
[1:47:20] down there right now down a little Hill
[1:47:22] and I was just thinking on other things
[1:47:24] had my mind somewhere besides driving
[1:47:27] down the road amen and and as I went by
[1:47:30] him I realized
[1:47:35] uhoh and I saw him pull out and I said
[1:47:38] here he
[1:47:39] comes so I pulled over let him come up
[1:47:43] behind me and so forth and you know he
[1:47:46] of course he checked my record checked
[1:47:48] my plates and all of that and come up
[1:47:50] said uh are you in a hurry
[1:47:53] where you been what you've been doing so
[1:47:55] forth and and you know how they do and
[1:47:58] uh so I I told him I said well I I just
[1:48:01] had my mind elsewhere and so forth so so
[1:48:04] I didn't just wasn't really watching
[1:48:06] amen and so he went back to the car and
[1:48:10] look my license up I guess or whatever
[1:48:12] they do and and then he come back and
[1:48:14] said well Mr Green said uh said you've
[1:48:17] got a pretty exemplary record for your
[1:48:19] driving said I'm just going to give you
[1:48:21] a warning and encourage you to slow down
[1:48:23] this morning I said Thank God I'm
[1:48:30] free thank God I'm free this
[1:48:34] morning now I I shared that with you
[1:48:36] this morning to to help you to
[1:48:40] realize when
[1:48:42] Jesus died on the
[1:48:44] cross when he was hanging there and and
[1:48:48] and I I know y'all probably heard this
[1:48:50] more than likely you have amen he he he
[1:48:53] began to declare and speak the famous
[1:48:56] last words my God my God why hast Thou
[1:49:00] forsaken me and then on and on and and
[1:49:02] his final words were it is
[1:49:07] finished now not only did he pay the
[1:49:10] price but he expunged the
[1:49:14] record amen I I'm I'm no longer guilty
[1:49:18] as brother randam talked about he said
[1:49:20] you know you say you want to forgive me
[1:49:22] for something that you heard that I did
[1:49:24] and I tell you I didn't do it I got
[1:49:26] witnesses that I didn't do it amen and
[1:49:29] so forth and you can't forgive me for
[1:49:31] something that I didn't
[1:49:34] do I want you to realize this morning I
[1:49:37] was a sinner I was lost I was undone
[1:49:41] without God but he forgave me this
[1:49:44] morning and when he cried out it is
[1:49:47] finished on the cross that is a
[1:49:49] declaration the debt is paid the job is
[1:49:53] done Redemption is paid for amen and and
[1:49:57] and when when when he declared that I
[1:50:00] recognized the Liberty that he has given
[1:50:03] me he has set me free from sin this
[1:50:06] morning and sin no longer has hold on me
[1:50:09] this
[1:50:11] morning amen now we realize this morning
[1:50:14] as the trumpet of Liberty sounded only
[1:50:18] the
[1:50:20] sons could go free
[1:50:24] oh sir that's back in the Old Testament
[1:50:27] it was only those in the
[1:50:31] generations of
[1:50:34] Abraham Isaac and Jacob that were
[1:50:37] rightful hirs to The
[1:50:41] Inheritance right now there were

[1:50:50] day you you pull so I'll preach fast
[1:50:52] fasor there were some servants that had
[1:50:56] their ears bored through with an
[1:51:01] awe and when they did that there was no
[1:51:05] liberty for them there was no Freedom
[1:51:09] awaiting them on the Year of Jubilee
[1:51:12] there was no way that they could go free
[1:51:15] because they have been bored through
[1:51:17] with an all and they were lifetime
[1:51:21] servants to the Master but thank God
[1:51:24] brother Jordan amen I didn't stoop that
[1:51:28] far to get my ear bored through with an

[2:04:12] Deliverance amen and Liberty and by
[2:04:16] hearing this message of Deliverance and
[2:04:18] Liberty it gives us the reality and the
[2:04:21] Revel ation amen that we are as much a
[2:04:25] part of God as God is
[2:04:28] himself and I want you to look up here
[2:04:30] at me everybody

[2:04:45] before the foundation of the world Amen
[2:04:49] listen it's not a message of I'm saved
[2:04:52] today and lost tomorrow but I am
[2:04:55] eternally
[2:04:58] saved if the spirit of God lives inside
[2:05:02] of me and what is God God is Zoe God's
[2:05:06] life
[2:05:10] eternal and if Eternal God lives inside
[2:05:13] of me that means that I am Eternal now
[2:05:17] this flesh it's going to have to die
[2:05:22] sister
[2:05:23] da brother brother Dan talked to Sister
[2:05:26] DA they were good buddies and and
[2:05:29] brother Dan you were pretty pretty well

[2:05:51] her said well sister sister glattus said
[2:05:54] it'll be like a quick death be a sharp
[2:05:58] pain and it'll be over with because why
[2:06:02] flesh cannot inherit eternal life and
[2:06:05] listen it's not this body that's going
[2:06:08] to or or that is eternal but it's the
[2:06:11] man on the inside that's the Eternal
[2:06:14] part this morning amen and by the grace
[2:06:17] of God looking if they ever call and
[2:06:21] tell you brother Joe has

[2:06:38] die because I have eternal life living
[2:06:40] and abiding in me oh my listen now the
[2:06:45] Masters bored the the all through their
[2:06:48] ears but I want you to understand the

[2:07:51] Liberty

[2:07:57] this dark leosa behind and Rising into
