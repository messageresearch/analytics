[44:32] amen aren't you glad at that this
[44:34] morning that we shall see him as he
[44:37] truly is
[44:38] you might think that this is odd text
[44:40] born in a mess
[44:42] raised in a mess coming out of a mess
[44:43] and you might say brother Matthew well
[44:45] you're the son of a pastor the grandson
[44:48] of a Preacher
[44:50] but yet
[44:52] I needed Jesus amen
[44:55] you know I I hung up my angel wings in
[44:57] the back that's what Cassie thinks at
[44:59] least
[45:00] no not really I needed Jesus just like
[45:03] each and every one of us for we were
[45:05] born in sin as he would say I come into
[45:08] this world speaking lies you say well
[45:10] I've never spoke a lot in my life well
[45:11] when you cried out in the middle of the
[45:14] night as a child
[45:16] and your mother come running well there
[45:18] was you didn't need a diaper change she
[45:20] had just fed you you didn't need a burp
[45:22] and she would lay you back down and
[45:24] she'd go and and then you'd cry again
[45:27] well a little bit of lying going on
[45:30] there was a little bit of an attention
[45:31] there
[45:32] you understand what I'm saying your
[45:34] mothers know and so
[45:36] so we was all
[45:38] with sin we come into this world in a
[45:41] sinly fashion
[45:42] you know there was a there was a purpose
[45:45] and a place of how we would have been in
[45:47] the Garden of Eden we would have just
[45:48] been spoken into existence but after
[45:50] that was broken we had to come in
[45:53] through another way but God seen us even
[45:54] then
[45:55] and so this morning I would like to take
[45:58] and if you want to go back for a
[45:59] background you can listen to
[46:01] birth pains and then adoption so I'll be
[46:04] drawing from those this morning and
[46:07] brother branham's messages so just uh
[46:10] if you would like to listen to those I
[46:12] think that would be good that's where
[46:13] I'm drawing from this morning
[46:15] and we got brother William back here
[46:17] with sister Gabrielle at home and she's
[46:19] going through some birth painting right
[46:22] now
[46:22] there's something on the inside of her
[46:25] that's working that says I'm about to
[46:27] come out of here
[46:28] and I was probably the number one
[46:30] praying for him this week
[46:33] at the beginning of the week I was
[46:35] saying Lord just let him come
[46:37] and by yesterday about six o'clock I
[46:40] said Lord just let him stay
[46:46] amen sorry about that sister Gabriella
[46:49] so I was praying in two different ways
[46:50] there for your birth pains
[46:52] amen so she's starting to feel the
[46:54] effect and there's something on the
[46:56] inside there and that baby is starting
[46:59] to feel that pressure and and it's
[47:01] starting to say that's a little
[47:02] uncomfortable in here it's beginning to
[47:05] to press and there's things getting
[47:06] tighter there's some squeezing going on
[47:08] in there but that's the way that this
[47:11] world is even right now
[47:13] it's groaning there's things moving when
[47:16] we're sitting here and we're going hey
[47:18] this just don't feel right there's
[47:20] something that's calling me to get out
[47:22] of here as dad would speak that Sermon
[47:24] Just the other week that said you cannot
[47:27] stay here
[47:28] we cannot stay in that warm just Comfort
[47:31] condition as the children of Israel they
[47:34] would be fed with Manna day in and day
[47:36] out but they was going through some
[47:38] birth pains at that time there was some
[47:40] Heavenly manner that was given to them
[47:42] but once they reached that Promised Land
[47:44] oh there they had come out of that stage
[47:47] of that just
[47:49] wonderful nourishment
[47:51] but there was some corn that had to be
[47:53] fed to him there was some real manner
[47:55] that had to come forth and so with this
[47:57] child as he's about to come forth he's
[47:59] going to go through a stage
[48:01] amen and I was a little concerned that
[48:03] brother William might even be speaking
[48:05] what I was speaking on just because what
[48:06] they was going through but hey the Lord
[48:08] laid this on my heart
[48:11] amen
[48:12] and so we want to look at brother
[48:14] Branham tells a story about the farmer
[48:16] how he went up to the mountains and
[48:18] grabbed an eagle egg
[48:20] and he took that eagle egg and he took
[48:23] it to was born
[48:24] and he had laying hens there in his barn
[48:26] and and he laid that eagles egg
[48:28] underneath of a hen well it was the
[48:33] right kind of place for it but it wasn't
[48:36] the real mother
[48:38] but that eagle came forth and and that
[48:40] chicken that would be in the barnyard
[48:42] and and it would cluck around and it
[48:44] would eat worms and and that eagle would
[48:46] look over at and like what in the world
[48:49] are y'all doing and they would just
[48:50] cluck and they would find a worm and
[48:52] they would be all so happy
[48:54] also happy we found just this Worm but
[48:57] that eagle he had something on the
[48:58] inside of him they said this this is not
[49:02] satisfying this is not to me this is not
[49:05] what I'm Desiring in in me
[49:08] and the other chickens they thought well
[49:11] you're just an odd duck you're just an
[49:13] odd Eagle you know but
[49:17] he knew something that was laying there
[49:19] on the inside of him he didn't know
[49:21] exactly you didn't know exactly what was
[49:23] laying on the inside of you but you knew
[49:25] there was something that was laying
[49:27] there that you desired in your heart
[49:29] that said
[49:30] this just isn't for me this just isn't
[49:33] what I want amen
[49:36] and so one day that that mother Eagle
[49:38] that had been searching searching all
[49:41] over the Lord that had been searching
[49:42] all over for you
[49:44] that cry went out over top of that eagle
[49:47] and she said oh that's my son down there
[49:50] see he was born in a mess oh what a mess
[49:53] it was and that old a farm yard down in
[49:55] there just mud and worms and it's just a
[49:58] mess but he heard a cry and he said that
[50:03] that is what I've been looking for I
[50:06] wasn't meant to stay here I was meant to
[50:08] fly there and all he stretched out those
[50:11] wings and he flew forth and he knew that
[50:13] from that moment on that's not where I
[50:16] meant to be and there was no going back
[50:18] once he received that message that voice
[50:21] that said son come out of her amen
[50:24] aren't you glad that you heard that one
[50:26] day that you said I'm not a chicken in
[50:28] this old Barnyard anymore I've received
[50:31] a word from the Lord and that cry that
[50:33] said come out of her
[50:35] amen aren't you glad of that this
[50:37] morning oh gods are so good to us that
[50:40] we can hear his cry
[50:42] amen that seed that was laying down on
[50:44] the inside of us amen we're about to go
[50:47] through a wintering time we're in Fall
[50:49] now the Harvest times the reaping of it
[50:51] but we're about to go through a
[50:53] wintering time to where that there are
[50:55] seeds that's going to be laying on the
[50:56] inside there's going to be acorns that
[50:58] has been dropping all over the fourth
[51:00] floor well there's going to be leaves
[51:02] that will cover them and those acorns in
[51:05] the right atmosphere at the right place
[51:07] they will begin to come forth and you
[51:10] might not
[51:11] see it down beneath there and just like
[51:13] that Pond Lily that seed that's down in
[51:15] that pond that that seed is down there
[51:18] but at the right atmosphere and the
[51:20] right Sun even in whatever mess that it
[51:23] is
[51:24] it will start to grow
[51:26] it'll start to come forth
[51:28] it'll start to bloom down underneath
[51:30] there
[51:31] amen
[51:33] all of us all of us we were born in this
[51:35] sin
[51:36] but we were shaping an iniquity
[51:39] amen
[51:40] so we begin to just say hey this is
[51:43] something here I there's something
[51:44] brooding on the inside of me there's
[51:46] something that's starting to Bud forth
[51:48] and coming out
[51:50] and many times even fires will come
[51:52] across the forest floor but that is a
[51:54] type of way that the Lord will just burn
[51:56] out that oldness that will burn out
[51:58] those things and their seeds and
[52:00] beautiful flowers that would come forth
[52:02] and trees and things that would come
[52:04] forth and Bud and give us life
[52:08] for we don't want to stay in this whole
[52:10] world
[52:10] amen we wanted to we want to be forth
[52:13] and be blooming in his holiness
[52:16] brother Brandon would say it like this
[52:18] in first John and 5 and 7 said I believe
[52:21] it is
[52:22] he said if I'm not mistaken is there
[52:24] there are three that bear record in
[52:26] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[52:29] Ghost these three are one
[52:32] there there are three that bear record
[52:35] in the earth and that's the water the
[52:37] blood and the spirit and they agree in
[52:39] one now notice the first three are one
[52:42] and the second three are Earthly it's a
[52:46] type whatever is in the earth much type
[52:48] the spiritual amen
[52:51] but you have to have the water without
[52:53] the blood you can't have the water
[52:56] without the blood
[52:57] and the blood without the spirit I Think
[53:00] Through the Ages has proven this to be
[53:03] true the water the blood and the spirit
[53:06] justification sanctification and baptism
[53:09] of the Holy Ghost that's where many get
[53:11] held up they want to go through
[53:13] justification as brother William was
[53:15] saying last night if we was just in
[53:16] Wesley's day in that just time and but
[53:19] you don't just stay in justification
[53:21] you move on to sanctification and many
[53:24] people would go on to sanctification but
[53:26] they would not want the moving of the
[53:28] Holy Ghost they would not want the
[53:30] baptism of the Holy Spirit upon their
[53:31] lives because they were scared of what
[53:34] it would do for them as brother Brandon
[53:36] would say you would scare the move upon
[53:37] the heart of the people and they'd want
[53:39] to give out a shout but no I don't want
[53:41] to do that amen but that's what is
[53:44] calling for if you can't just have one
[53:45] without the other if you end with one
[53:48] you have a stillbirth but that's the
[53:51] what the church world is wanting to
[53:53] produce is stillborn children amen they
[53:56] they don't want this just crying and
[53:59] weeping out and willing and a moving of
[54:01] the sins they want the blood without the
[54:03] sacrifice
[54:05] amen as brother Brad as brother William
[54:07] was speaking last night about bringing
[54:09] forth those sacrifices he paid that
[54:11] price for us he shed that blood for us
[54:14] the accepted blood that we can just take
[54:16] our sins and blot out but those people
[54:19] they those churches they do not want
[54:21] that
[54:22] and many people will come up and have a
[54:24] dry confession say oh well I've got it
[54:26] no you don't really have it until you've
[54:29] been born out until you've been birthed
[54:30] out until that fire has come across you
[54:32] you can go into justification you can
[54:35] stay in sanctification but you can't
[54:37] just stay there you have to move on to
[54:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:41] I enjoyed last weekend we had 35 members
[54:44] that was baptized here
[54:46] and uh one of the last times that we had
[54:49] a moving of the Holy Ghost like that
[54:51] where many was baptized I was involved
[54:54] in that brother Jason Smith was involved
[54:57] in there and I think it was 15 brother
[54:59] Jeffrey actually started it that night
[55:01] and he was one of the first ones to be
[55:03] baptized
[55:04] and and you see that and that was a move
[55:07] at that time upon the hearts of the
[55:09] people here
[55:10] and that's what you can build a church
[55:12] upon right there
[55:13] and we just had 35 last weekend and all
[55:17] you just think oh what can we build upon
[55:19] a church now
[55:20] amen we didn't just stay here and just
[55:23] be like well that was good enough we
[55:24] thank the Lord for that no we continued
[55:26] to move on Amen we continue to seek the
[55:28] Lord and we will seek the Lord until he
[55:31] come for us amen
[55:33] amen as dad was speaking to that sermon
[55:36] that you can't stay here
[55:38] amen the world is groaning even even
[55:42] Biden announced that Armageddon is upon
[55:44] the Verge well even the president can
[55:47] see that the people in this world can
[55:49] see that that there is a groaning that's
[55:51] coming forth it's about to be birthed
[55:54] amen aren't you glad of that that this
[55:56] whole world is about to be birthed
[55:58] hey but we can't stay here
[56:01] you can't stay in this mess you've got
[56:03] to get into the word of the Lord you've
[56:05] got to be baptized in the name of the
[56:07] Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of
[56:09] your sins just like many of us have
[56:11] already done amen and a natural birth is
[56:15] a mess it is a mess you know granddaddy
[56:18] would say there's a lot of you that come
[56:19] into the world as a mess but I came in
[56:22] in a three-piece suit
[56:23] amen
[56:25] brother brother you remember him saying
[56:27] that all the time he he'd say you know
[56:29] there's many people that come in but I
[56:30] come in in a three-piece suit
[56:32] well he enjoyed saying that but that's
[56:34] not the truth
[56:36] amen he had to be born just the same way
[56:39] each and every one of us had to be
[56:41] and it was a mess there's the water that
[56:44] would break the blood that come forth
[56:47] but there's something on the inside that
[56:49] when the baby is born you don't want to
[56:51] just see it you want to hear that baby
[56:55] amen when that baby would cry out after
[56:57] it's being birthed sent through that
[56:59] chamber you want to hear that cry and
[57:02] and they would stake and spank that baby
[57:04] and maybe it's just saying they were
[57:06] spanking it and you might think well
[57:08] that's awful but hey hey that's bringing
[57:10] forth a life right there let's bring
[57:12] them forth for crying you want that cry
[57:14] you want that cry to come out it was in
[57:17] a mess hey but when that cry come forth
[57:19] oh that was music to the years amen
[57:24] amen we thank the Lord for that but many
[57:27] people in nowadays
[57:29] they reject the birthright
[57:31] I want to take you through Jacob
[57:34] as as he wanted to accept and Esau
[57:37] despised the birthright
[57:40] but Jacob was a mess oh he he was a he
[57:44] was a mess
[57:46] and he would be a lot like us before we
[57:48] met Jesus we was a mess a lot of things
[57:51] that we did we ain't proud of we was a
[57:54] mess amen but Jacob he wanted that
[57:58] Birthright and his brother Esau as he
[58:00] would come forth from the fields and he
[58:01] would hunger and he would say oh give me
[58:04] some of that porridge that that you
[58:05] would have and Jacob would say no you
[58:08] sell me that Birthright send me the
[58:10] birthright and so there's many people in
[58:13] this age that would sell out the
[58:14] birthright for a pot of porridge
[58:16] something that was fancy something
[58:18] that's nice
[58:19] they have no respect they despise the
[58:22] birthright
[58:23] but Jacob he would take and he would
[58:25] want that Birthright he would want that
[58:28] blessing
[58:29] oh he was deceiver and what a mess that
[58:31] he was in and we look and when we go man
[58:33] how in the world
[58:35] down Through the Ages and you look and
[58:37] there was Jacob
[58:39] and he was in a a mess
[58:41] he he continued to make messes out of
[58:44] messes he would deceive his father he
[58:47] would put goat's clothing around his
[58:49] arms just to deceive his father he he
[58:51] would have the venison that would just
[58:53] be like Esau would make it just so he
[58:56] could receive that blessing and you
[58:58] would think how would God bless him
[59:00] through a deception well see it was a
[59:03] longing on the inside of him that God
[59:05] knew said I'm going to bless him that's
[59:09] the one I love
[59:10] Jacob have a love Esau have a hated he
[59:13] would even say amen for he chose you and
[59:16] we're going to get in that a little bit
[59:17] later I don't want to go too much but he
[59:19] was in a mess
[59:22] but he decided I'm coming out of that
[59:24] mess and he met the Lord one night and
[59:27] he said he grabbed a hold of you he said
[59:29] I will not let you go until you bless me
[59:31] I won't let you go until you bless me
[59:35] let's read upon another mess and
[59:38] and another guy that was raised in a
[59:40] mess
[59:42] I said now that's Moses now Moses was
[59:45] raised up and all the Theology of Egypt
[59:49] could afford to give him and he was
[59:52] smart until he could teach the masters
[59:53] of Egypt some wisdom and he knew that he
[59:57] was born a Hebrew and he knew that he
[1:00:00] was born a deliverer but look what a
[1:00:02] mess he made out of it he tried within
[1:00:06] himself before he had an experience
[1:00:10] do you see what I'm saying he tried
[1:00:12] within what he thought was right to be
[1:00:16] the deliverer but he was making a mess
[1:00:19] out of it I mean he was raised in
[1:00:23] Egypt there what a wonderful place it
[1:00:25] would have been just to be able to learn
[1:00:27] the things that he would he was learning
[1:00:29] as the world would say
[1:00:31] but he was in a mess
[1:00:34] he created even more of a mess
[1:00:37] amen he had all the schooling he had all
[1:00:39] the knowledge that he was a deliverer
[1:00:41] but you see he had never had any
[1:00:45] experience yet but oh brother when God
[1:00:48] met him there in the burning bush
[1:00:51] he knew what he was after then he know
[1:00:54] that who he had believed and he could
[1:00:57] endure the rest of the 80 years seeing
[1:01:00] who was the invisible one
[1:01:02] see he met him in that mess he had an
[1:01:05] experience with him that brought him out
[1:01:08] of that mess within his own self he was
[1:01:11] making even a more of a mess he was a
[1:01:13] murderer in his own self because he was
[1:01:16] trying to be a deliverer without the
[1:01:18] help of God Amen and many times when we
[1:01:22] were born in a mess we're and you can
[1:01:24] take this as any age this is not just a
[1:01:27] for the children this is for every
[1:01:29] single person here in this building and
[1:01:31] that's listening by the way of the
[1:01:32] internet but you can take this and apply
[1:01:35] this for your situation right now you
[1:01:37] might have been born in a situation of
[1:01:39] life you might have been raised up and
[1:01:42] many times the devil will present a way
[1:01:45] out that you would say I'm getting out
[1:01:48] of this mess but instead you actually
[1:01:50] create even a more of a mess
[1:01:53] you you might say well I'm going to move
[1:01:55] out of this state of poverty and marry
[1:01:57] this this young man that has everything
[1:01:59] but that's not just what you want
[1:02:03] you want the guiding of the Lord to say
[1:02:05] hey this is where you need to be at and
[1:02:08] so many times you see a young lady that
[1:02:11] might be in in a mess in her and you
[1:02:13] might see a young man that say Hey that
[1:02:15] that might be the perfect match in our
[1:02:17] own Humanity but that might not be God's
[1:02:19] Will and in the mess that we're in we'll
[1:02:22] go I'm going to move into that because
[1:02:24] he can provide for me better well that's
[1:02:27] not what the Lord would want and you
[1:02:29] create even more of a mess
[1:02:32] and be you would marry someone you would
[1:02:35] might even have children by someone and
[1:02:37] you're creating even a more and more and
[1:02:39] more of a mess and then you're in the
[1:02:42] same state that you was before
[1:02:45] and and so many times we see this in our
[1:02:47] lives that the devil will present
[1:02:50] something that would look so close it's
[1:02:53] so right that you go well I'm going to
[1:02:55] do that and you don't do it without the
[1:02:57] guiding of the Lord
[1:02:58] and you just step into it but seek the
[1:03:01] Lord while he may yet be found
[1:03:04] amen Moses was led by the pillar of Fire
[1:03:07] after he had the experience
[1:03:10] seek him receive an experience don't
[1:03:13] just have a dry confession be led by the
[1:03:16] Holy Spirit be led by that Pillar of
[1:03:18] Fire amen
[1:03:20] seek Him amen have an experience because
[1:03:24] an experience will get you out of this
[1:03:25] old chaos
[1:03:27] he was a one-man Invasion after he had
[1:03:29] an experience when he came down there in
[1:03:32] the Egyptians halls and he threw forth
[1:03:35] that the stick
[1:03:37] amen they thought that hey we can do the
[1:03:39] exact same thing
[1:03:41] but at this point he was no longer in a
[1:03:44] mess
[1:03:45] he had an experience
[1:03:47] amen
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:51] excuse me
[1:04:02] amen and we even see brother Branham
[1:04:06] he would uh he would tell us about the
[1:04:08] story of the young boy that he had seen
[1:04:11] a vision he was at his mother's home
[1:04:13] and he had seen a vision of this young
[1:04:15] boy
[1:04:16] that that was sick and laying in the bed
[1:04:19] and he seen certain things and
[1:04:22] and he come down and his mother asked
[1:04:24] him sit and said what's wrong or
[1:04:25] whatever and he said I've seen a vision
[1:04:28] and there was a knock at the door and it
[1:04:30] was I believe his name was brother uh
[1:04:33] Emil
[1:04:34] and uh
[1:04:35] I knocked at the door right
[1:04:37] and he said my child is sick would you
[1:04:39] come
[1:04:40] and so on the way he picked up brother
[1:04:41] Snelling and they would be traveling out
[1:04:44] through there and brother Branham asked
[1:04:46] him he said no no is this your house is
[1:04:49] this such and such is and he would
[1:04:50] describe it exactly how it was as your
[1:04:53] baby like this is it and he would
[1:04:55] describe each and everything
[1:04:57] and the brother said yes have you been
[1:05:00] there have you been there because he was
[1:05:02] he was a Seer and so he's seen that but
[1:05:05] he's seen that baby hope but there were
[1:05:07] some things that had to be in place at
[1:05:10] the time and so he told this brother
[1:05:12] your brother your baby's going to be
[1:05:13] made well so they get to the house and
[1:05:16] and they gather around and the fathers
[1:05:18] you know he's there and and they began
[1:05:20] and they pray but everything wasn't in
[1:05:22] the right order it wasn't in the right
[1:05:25] place
[1:05:26] and so the baby he would describe it he
[1:05:29] said that baby didn't only get better it
[1:05:32] actually got worse
[1:05:33] and they it thought it was about to die
[1:05:36] and the mother and the the father would
[1:05:38] work with it and and so it carried on
[1:05:40] through the night and and the next day
[1:05:43] as brother Branham and them were are
[1:05:45] still there and he was he was saying
[1:05:48] I've I've messed it up I I've messed
[1:05:51] this I've missed something here because
[1:05:54] something wasn't in the right place I
[1:05:55] seen it now this wasn't here but once
[1:05:58] this is here this is how it needs he
[1:06:01] said I I know I've seen it
[1:06:03] but this baby was it was about to die
[1:06:06] and he was thinking oh Lord don't let
[1:06:08] this be upon me don't don't let this
[1:06:10] because of what are the mess I have made
[1:06:12] and so as they're sitting there the this
[1:06:15] older lady would come forth and brother
[1:06:18] brantham well she's got to be in the
[1:06:20] house
[1:06:21] and he hadn't seen her there the first
[1:06:23] time so
[1:06:24] she comes into the house and and brother
[1:06:27] Snelling was about to leave for work I
[1:06:28] believe it is and he said I knew brother
[1:06:31] Snelling needed to be in the house as
[1:06:32] well and I seen that dual full chair
[1:06:35] chair I seen the glasses and the hat and
[1:06:37] he said I seen that everything had to be
[1:06:39] in a certain order he said so I was
[1:06:41] sitting in that chair I do a full chair
[1:06:43] he said and I thought she's got to be
[1:06:45] sitting in that chair
[1:06:47] he said so I I get up and I just and I'm
[1:06:51] just thinking I'm praying and I'm going
[1:06:53] it needs to be happening exactly this
[1:06:55] way but see he could not tell them you
[1:06:58] go sit here you go do this you go do
[1:07:01] that it would have made even more of a
[1:07:03] mess
[1:07:04] and and many times in our own life
[1:07:07] we're told something where we think
[1:07:09] something's supposed to be a certain way
[1:07:10] and in our mind we're going this is how
[1:07:13] it should happen Okay so I I need to do
[1:07:15] this I need to be there at this time let
[1:07:18] God have control of the situation
[1:07:21] amen don't don't just rush into a thing
[1:07:23] and you create a mess out of it even in
[1:07:26] your own self let God have control of
[1:07:28] the situation you be guided by God and
[1:07:32] so brother Brandon would step to the
[1:07:33] side there and he would just begin to
[1:07:35] pray and
[1:07:36] and they were just so saddened at this
[1:07:39] time because the baby was still sick and
[1:07:41] coughing
[1:07:43] and he looked over and he said brother
[1:07:45] Emma
[1:07:47] do you still have faith in me he said oh
[1:07:49] brother Branham I love you I love you
[1:07:52] and he just took the baby and he prayed
[1:07:54] well everything was then in its right
[1:07:57] order
[1:07:58] every place everything was exactly the
[1:08:01] way it should have been
[1:08:03] it was a perfect picture the mess was
[1:08:06] cleaned up
[1:08:07] amen the Lord had moved in a certain way
[1:08:10] to move each and every person each and
[1:08:12] every place as they should have been
[1:08:15] and that he grabbed a hold of that baby
[1:08:16] and and as he prayed for that baby
[1:08:19] oh Lord forgive me where I messed up
[1:08:23] and that's the way we should be many
[1:08:25] times that we we might have created a
[1:08:27] mess and you go oh Lord just forgive me
[1:08:30] for where I messed up forgive me for how
[1:08:33] I acted in this certain way I thought
[1:08:35] this was but it wasn't the way I should
[1:08:37] have acted this wasn't what I should
[1:08:39] have done
[1:08:40] anybody
[1:08:42] and that baby began to scream and cry
[1:08:44] out and say daddy daddy daddy
[1:08:46] amen I said at that point the vision had
[1:08:48] been completed
[1:08:49] amen excuse me not completed but it had
[1:08:53] come to the point that brother Brandon
[1:08:54] had seen it there and it was then
[1:08:57] completed on the next day when he had
[1:08:59] went down and he told the Church of what
[1:09:00] had happened and he said and when I go
[1:09:02] back that baby will come and he said I'm
[1:09:05] Healed I'm Healed aren't you glad of
[1:09:07] that that that out of a mess we can come
[1:09:11] forth and God will put us in our exact
[1:09:14] position
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:16] I'm glad that the Lord will do that for
[1:09:18] me
[1:09:19] and work away when there seems no other
[1:09:21] way
[1:09:23] aren't you glad of that this morning
[1:09:25] amen
[1:09:27] and so at
[1:09:29] as we're raised in a mess
[1:09:32] talking about that
[1:09:34] we do certain things
[1:09:37] amen
[1:09:38] like I was saying you you think it needs
[1:09:41] to be one way but the Lord needs to
[1:09:43] guide you
[1:09:45] and so the best way is to come out of
[1:09:48] the mess by using his word
[1:09:51] aren't you glad that you can be found in
[1:09:53] his word this morning
[1:09:56] and brother Brandon would say it like
[1:09:58] this how to get to Christ it's not by
[1:10:01] joining a church no by putting your name
[1:10:03] in a book known by being baptized or in
[1:10:06] immersing no
[1:10:09] how we get to into Christ is by one Holy
[1:10:12] Spirit we are all baptized into the
[1:10:15] promise the body and partakers of all
[1:10:19] belongs into the land that is how you
[1:10:22] get into Christ amen is be baptized
[1:10:26] into the promise into the body and be
[1:10:28] partakers of it
[1:10:31] and being placed perfectly in his body
[1:10:34] amen hearing a cry come out of her my
[1:10:37] people
[1:10:38] they may once you hear that voice of
[1:10:41] that eagle that said hey
[1:10:43] hey now that's it I'm coming out of
[1:10:45] there I'm coming out of that barnyard
[1:10:49] amen many times we we have a feeling in
[1:10:52] this whole world that hey we don't
[1:10:54] belong there's something on the inside
[1:10:57] that says I don't belong here as I was
[1:11:01] describing that eagle I don't feel at
[1:11:03] home here
[1:11:05] amen but the secret things belong to the
[1:11:08] Lord our God for those things which are
[1:11:10] revealed belonging to us and to our
[1:11:13] children forever and we may do all is in
[1:11:17] the world words of this law
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:21] and in Ephesians 1 and 3 and it said say
[1:11:24] it like this blessed be to God and the
[1:11:27] father of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:30] of whom have blessed us with all
[1:11:33] spiritual blessing in heavenly
[1:11:35] places in Christ
[1:11:37] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:11:40] before the foundation of the world that
[1:11:44] we shall be holy and Without Blame
[1:11:46] before him in love having predestinated
[1:11:50] us unto the adoption of the children by
[1:11:53] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:11:57] good pleasure of his will
[1:11:59] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:12:02] wherein he hath made us accept it in
[1:12:06] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[1:12:09] through his blood forgiveness of sins
[1:12:12] according to the riches of his grace
[1:12:16] amen aren't you glad that you've been
[1:12:18] baptized underneath the blood of the
[1:12:20] Lamb
[1:12:20] forgiveness for all of our sins
[1:12:23] now we can see he says having in verse 5
[1:12:26] again says having predestinated us unto
[1:12:29] the adoption by the children of Jesus
[1:12:31] Christ to himself
[1:12:34] see many people they want to place
[1:12:36] themselves in a certain way they think
[1:12:38] that this is what it should be if I
[1:12:41] could just increase my financial status
[1:12:43] if I could just increase this that's not
[1:12:45] that that won't bring you out a mess and
[1:12:47] many people become rich and they get in
[1:12:50] worse of a mess
[1:12:53] amen
[1:12:54] but see God knew you from the foundation
[1:12:57] of the world he knew that you would be
[1:12:59] perfectly placed in him
[1:13:01] amen and brother Brandon would describe
[1:13:03] it in adoption it said those mothers as
[1:13:06] they would have in those children they
[1:13:07] would cry out Ephraim and they would
[1:13:09] place them in the word they would place
[1:13:10] them in their position
[1:13:12] and aren't you glad that you've been
[1:13:14] placed as you've been in this this place
[1:13:18] in time and God has placed you here but
[1:13:21] see now Joshua will come along and the
[1:13:23] Lord had blessed them and he knew where
[1:13:26] they needed to be placed perfectly in
[1:13:28] each of those places
[1:13:30] and so we would be placed perfectly into
[1:13:33] the word amen
[1:13:35] you see God knew us God knew us at the
[1:13:38] foundation
[1:13:40] and I want to read a quote here it says
[1:13:43] and how great is hazardous set some
[1:13:46] Churches through the labor pains
[1:13:49] oh
[1:13:50] get tremendous sometimes when the church
[1:13:53] is groaning under the persecution of
[1:13:55] outside world Believing on the Lord
[1:13:57] Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:00] is just as real to us as it was in
[1:14:03] Pentecost how they grown Under The Cry
[1:14:05] of labor pains
[1:14:07] but when they were born
[1:14:09] they were
[1:14:10] positionally Born Into the kingdom of
[1:14:12] God then the Holy Ghost has set the
[1:14:15] church
[1:14:16] some Apostles some prophets some
[1:14:18] teachers some pastors some evangelist
[1:14:21] then he has given us into their
[1:14:24] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[1:14:27] tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[1:14:30] healing and all kinds of Miracles aren't
[1:14:33] you glad he's given the church those
[1:14:35] things
[1:14:36] amen and it didn't say ignorance in any
[1:14:39] of those things I thank the Lord for
[1:14:41] that aren't you amen I'm glad he gave us
[1:14:44] wisdom I'm glad he placed us perfectly
[1:14:47] in our positions here and you might and
[1:14:50] he goes on to say he says where the
[1:14:53] church is now this is my purpose of
[1:14:56] doing this the church is always trying
[1:14:59] to take someone else's Corner the church
[1:15:02] is trying to put people in a place or
[1:15:05] trying to take someone's else's position
[1:15:07] but don't do that you can never raise
[1:15:10] corn in ephraim's corner if you're in
[1:15:12] Manassas
[1:15:13] you've got to take your your your place
[1:15:17] in Christ positionally taking it amen oh
[1:15:21] it gets deep and Rich when you get in
[1:15:23] here and how God puts one in the church
[1:15:26] that will speak in tongues and another
[1:15:28] and how we've been taught times
[1:15:32] that we all have to speak in tongues
[1:15:34] well that's wrong
[1:15:36] amen
[1:15:38] we all got to do it no we don't
[1:15:42] there you don't have to do just one
[1:15:44] thing amen aren't you glad that the Lord
[1:15:46] placed you in the exact position
[1:15:49] in where you need to be amen and maybe
[1:15:52] this is for somebody this morning maybe
[1:15:53] you've been dealing and struggling that
[1:15:56] well I've heard tongues in the church
[1:15:58] maybe I have to speak in tongues no no
[1:16:02] that that is given to certain people in
[1:16:04] the church interpretations given to
[1:16:06] certain people in the church and the
[1:16:09] best place to be out of the mess is by
[1:16:11] finding your exact position that you
[1:16:14] need to be in and that the Lord can deal
[1:16:16] with you in that position amen aren't
[1:16:19] you I'm glad that I don't have to speak
[1:16:21] in tongues and do all that but it's

[1:16:56] don't have to do their position in the
[1:16:58] church
[1:16:59] amen
[1:17:01] let me you take our brother Roy back
[1:17:04] here he found his position in the church
[1:17:06] that every time somebody walks into

[1:17:11] handshake he don't have to say much to
[1:17:13] him just greeting those he's been placed
[1:17:15] perfectly in his position and he has

[1:17:50] William was even speaking on this last
[1:17:52] night
[1:17:53] and he read the first part of the quote
[1:17:56] and this morning I'm going to read the
[1:18:00] second part of this quote I just thought
[1:18:02] it was so perfect I thought well he's
[1:18:03] going to read the whole quote there for
[1:18:04] me
[1:18:05] but I want to read the the second part
[1:18:07] of this quote he says
[1:18:09] he says well well there was nothing to
[1:18:11] save nothing to heal but his attributes
[1:18:14] purposed it
[1:18:16] so then before the foundation of the
[1:18:18] world he knew he knowed that the great
[1:18:21] display in here of him and he would be a
[1:18:25] savior that he would come and be made
[1:18:27] flesh and dwelt amongst us and he know
[1:18:29] that he by his stripes we'd be healed he
[1:18:33] knew that he knew all of that from the
[1:18:35] foundation of the world he slayed the
[1:18:38] lamb in the book in his book before the
[1:18:41] foundation of the world and wrote your
[1:18:43] name in the book before the foundation
[1:18:45] of the world oh listen to this election
[1:18:48] looks back to foreknowledge and
[1:18:50] predestination looks to Destiny don't
[1:18:53] forget that that election looks back
[1:18:56] here here it is I was a cockleberry Amen
[1:19:00] brother Branham was describing himself I
[1:19:02] was a cocoa bird see I was born in sin I
[1:19:06] was shaping iniquity from the world
[1:19:07] speaking lies born amongst Sinners
[1:19:09] father and mother and all of my whole
[1:19:12] family sinners
[1:19:14] I was a kookaburra but all of a sudden I
[1:19:17] became a wheat grain amen and how did it
[1:19:21] happen
[1:19:22] oh
[1:19:23] what is that the election of God a
[1:19:26] cocklebur that has now become a grain of
[1:19:28] wheat now I know I'm a grain of wheat
[1:19:31] because I'm saved
[1:19:33] how do I do it look back and see
[1:19:37] he predestinated it long ago before the
[1:19:40] by foreknowledge he seen that I would
[1:19:44] love him now get this see
[1:19:47] by foreknowledge he seen that I would
[1:19:50] love him and so he made a perpetuation
[1:19:53] through his own son that through him I
[1:19:57] might become
[1:19:59] a kookaburr to a grain of wheat
[1:20:03] did you get that
[1:20:05] that he's seen that you would be
[1:20:08] accepting him that you would accept him
[1:20:11] amen so he elected you
[1:20:15] amen aren't you glad of that see see he
[1:20:18] knew us he foreseen Us in his
[1:20:21] foreknowledge
[1:20:22] so then he elected us besid because he
[1:20:24] said brother Shannon's going to accept
[1:20:26] me
[1:20:27] so bro if you if 15 years ago if you'd
[1:20:30] looked at brother Shannon sitting here
