[15:38] there we would like to thank each and
[15:40] every one of you for coming on this
[15:41] glorious day it's an incredible event
[15:44] and all of our
[15:46] Lives we're just thankful that we can be
[15:48] a part of it and God is so great to us I
[15:53] would first of all like to congratulate
[15:55] you brother Chester and you sister
[15:58] Hannah for coming to this
[16:01] day I would especially like to
[16:03] congratulate your
[16:17] father this is a great
[16:20] day we so love each and every one of you
[16:22] and thank you for being
[16:24] here it's a time when families gather
[16:27] together it's it's an important event we
[16:30] come to we thank you for taking your
[16:33] time to be here today to witness what
[16:37] God is doing in
[16:40] lives
[16:43] today sometimes we look at things how
[16:45] can two become
[16:47] one but today you're going to
[16:49] witness two individuals becoming
[16:54] one and then in their
[16:56] life 3 4 5 6 7
[17:01] nothing the scripture says and tells us
[17:04] that God is the author of
[17:07] love the Bible teaches us that God is
[17:11] love and love comes from
[17:14] God from the very beginning the Bible is
[17:17] a love
[17:18] story that we read of God's love for his
[17:22] people and he displayed it all
[17:25] throughout the scriptures we heard it
[17:27] this morning
[17:29] about elesar going to get Isaac
[17:32] upright God has displayed that I cannot
[17:36] even hardly imagine under the great
[17:39] canopy of the Garden of
[17:42] Eden God is
[17:44] so so built Eden to wear that it was a
[17:47] perfect
[17:49] paradise and then of all the
[17:52] animals the
[17:54] greatest he would create an image of
[17:56] himself
[17:59] but in himself he saw himself
[18:02] lonely so God created a helpmate for him
[18:07] today brother Chester that's what he's
[18:09] done for
[18:10] you life is a struggle it's difficult
[18:14] it's difficult at its best so he's
[18:17] brought a helper for
[18:19] you there will be responsibilities will
[18:22] come along that now you become her head
[18:25] now you that's not for you to demand
[18:28] that's for you to earn leadership true
[18:31] Christian leadership so today when we
[18:35] say God is love we want the love of God
[18:38] for our
[18:40] marriage sister
[18:42] Hannah you've longed for this
[18:45] day you've had dreams about
[18:48] it images of it but today you're going
[18:52] to step on the
[18:54] stage and it's going to
[18:56] happen but God has trained you through
[18:59] life to be a real
[19:01] Christian and now from this step you be
[19:04] a Christian lady to be a homemaker at
[19:08] home maybe to work a
[19:10] bit but to take care of brother Chester
[19:14] and you be good to
[19:16] him you be good to him and you be good
[19:20] to her pick up your clothes
[19:29] so today God has led us to life's
[19:34] companion we can't hardly understand how
[19:36] he does
[19:37] it for years we're looking and looking
[19:40] and then all of a sudden a spark takes
[19:42] place and and now here we are we pinch
[19:46] ourself and now here we are so today he
[19:50] has led us to life's
[19:53] companion and I thank God that he
[19:56] properly answers our
[19:59] prayer
[20:01] today Chester Theodore
[20:05] Bennett will you have this woman to be
[20:07] your wife to live together in the Holy
[20:11] Covenant of
[20:12] marriage will you love her comfort her
[20:16] honor her and keep her in sickness and
[20:19] in health forsaking all others and be
[20:22] faithful to her as long of the both of
[20:25] you shall live if so will you answer I
[20:28] will
[20:29] I
[20:31] will sister
[20:33] Hannah will you have this man to be your
[20:37] husband to live together in the Holy
[20:41] Covenant of marriage will you love
[20:44] him comfort him honor and keep him and
[20:48] in sickness and in health forsaking all
[20:52] others and be faithful to him as long as
[20:54] the both of you shall live if so answer
[20:57] I will
[21:00] who has given this woman to be married
[21:02] to this
[21:04] man go get
[21:21] her let's all pray Heavenly Father we
[21:25] come before you just now in this moment
[21:28] Lord you you see this husband and wife
[21:31] as they're getting ready to join
[21:33] together in holy matrimony father this
[21:36] wedding looks a lot like many others
[21:38] that take place in the world but the
[21:40] major difference in this wedding and
[21:42] others is your presence father and Lord
[21:45] we're asking that your presence Lord as
[21:47] these vows are being exchanged it's not
[21:50] in front of men and just these Witnesses
[21:52] but it's in front of almighty God and I
[21:55] pray father that you'd hear these vows
[21:57] father and I pray that you'd seal them
[21:59] with love we pray blessings upon brother
[22:02] Chester and sister Hannah in the coming
[22:04] days and may you just come amongst us
[22:06] today and bless us in Jesus name
[22:20] amen marriage is a gift of
[22:24] God it is given to
[22:26] comfort our life
[22:29] and magnify its
[22:34] Joys marriage is a clasping of hands and
[22:37] the blending of hearts and the union of
[22:40] two lives becoming
[22:43] one brother Chester sister Hannah your
[22:47] marriage must stand not by the authority
[22:49] of the
[22:50] state nor by the Seal of your wedding
[22:53] certificate but rather it must stand by
[22:56] the strength of Your Love
[22:59] it must stand by your Devotion to one
[23:02] another in good
[23:04] times and in bad
[23:08] times finally it must stand in the very
[23:12] Mind Of
[23:14] God marriage is the greatest
[23:16] relationship that humans can enter
[23:20] into in order for a marriage to reach
[23:23] its full
[23:25] potential you must allow God to take it
[23:28] the prim role in your
[23:30] relationship he knows your thoughts he
[23:33] knows your needs he understands your
[23:37] hearts even your love to one
[23:40] another it in fact God created the love
[23:45] that you are experiencing right
[23:48] now we can easily say that God knows
[23:54] everything better than even you know
[24:00] if you include him in everything that
[24:03] you do you will become keenly aware that
[24:07] he's very near all the time Keep Your
[24:12] Home sensitive to the Holy Spirit Keep
[24:15] Your Home full of love Keep Your Home
[24:18] full of
[24:20] joy and when the negative enemy comes
[24:23] show him the
[24:25] door the greatest place that you will
[24:28] ever find real help is on your knees in
[24:32] prayer clasping hands and praying it's
[24:36] not just in the mornings and at
[24:39] night but the enemy would like to come
[24:41] and divide he comes to kill to steal and
[24:46] to
[24:47] destroy and it's just like your
[24:49] relationship with God the enemy would
[24:51] like to cause you to become
[24:54] backslidden cold and
[24:56] indifferent but you have a prayer
[24:58] meeting with God and it'll renew you
[25:01] like never before and the fire will burn
[25:04] the enemy will also try to do that to
[25:06] your marriage and little things will
[25:09] come on it's life but remember you step
[25:14] from eternity into time and through time
[25:18] you'll spend with each other and one of
[25:21] these days you'll step back into
[25:23] eternity
[25:25] again brother Chester sister Hannah I
[25:28] enjoy seeing you holding your hands now
[25:32] but I can't wait till I maybe walking
[25:35] down the streets of gold
[25:40] and and I look across the
[25:43] street and I was a part of this
[25:46] day and I'll see you there on that day
[25:50] and the same love you feel here you'll
[25:53] feel

[26:06] us sorry I got you're not nervous I just

[34:17] the word of God tells
[34:21] us that
[34:24] love is like
[34:26] this if I I would speak with tongues of
[34:29] men and
[34:31] angels but have not love I am only a
[34:34] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol if
[34:38] I have the gift of Prophecy and cannot
[34:40] fathom all the Mysteries and the
[34:42] knowledge and if I have faith that can
[34:44] move mountains but have not love I am
[34:47] nothing and if I
[34:50] possess all to give to the poor and
[34:52] surrender my body to the flames and I
[34:55] have not love I
[34:59] nothing love is
[35:01] patient love is kind it does not envy
[35:05] and it does not boast it is not proud it
[35:09] is not rude it is not
[35:12] self-seeking it is not easily angered it
[35:16] keeps no record of
[35:18] wrongs love does not Delight itself in
[35:21] evil but rejoices in
[35:23] truth brother Chester it always protects
[35:27] and it always
[35:29] trust and in all three of these faith
[35:33] hope and love but the greatest of this
