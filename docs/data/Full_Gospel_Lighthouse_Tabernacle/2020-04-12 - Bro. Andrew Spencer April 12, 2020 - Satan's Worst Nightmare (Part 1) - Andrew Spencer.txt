ago and is alive and well today there is life and I'm so thankful that he's an omnipresent God that God still on the throne and there's a blood that is for us there's a blood that is greater than all of our sin and I'm so thankful to be serving the resurrection in the life what a mighty God that we serve what an awesome God mighty to be praised there's a lot of things that have been canceled today Easter Easter egg hunts may be canceled on a on a major level bunny rabbits and chicken sales may be down for the people family dinners are being served in a different manner Church Easter suppers are being shut down but there's one thing you cannot stop and that's Easter because Easter is not a day Easter is a person that is our Lord Jesus Christ what a God that we're serving a mighty God who will never fail us or nor forsake us you know because of this because of this virus that we're facing as the people there has been meeting shut down and there would have been a a a lot of young people that have would have gone from our own local church here that have been that Louisiana camp if it was not for this virus that is coming and I know that there's young people that feel like they have been robbed up and feel like that Satan has won but I want to assure each and every one of you that Satan has not won but Jesus Christ is packing out the victory for every one of you you may feel like you can't have an experience like you would at camp but you can have that same type of experience because you don't have to be a church to get the Holy Ghost I'm proof of that I got the Holy Ghost on the street so you don't have to be in church it's the best place in the world to be but you don't have to be in church to have an experience with the Lord you can be right where you're sitting there in your home and the baptism of the Holy Ghost can come flooding into your soul and so rapture you and anoint you and quicken you he's that kind of a God he's alive today Saints he's alive in every way possible he's not dead you can't keep him in a grave and this bride is rising out of scriptures this bride is a powerful bride that is standing on the safe the Lord I like to sing a song to you today

just thinking about last night as we were gathered as a faith we watched in 2016 and brother Tim's camp their past what is preaching what I am a witness father your kids are killer the greater the cancer you're greater than any sickness you're greater than any normal father and I'm asking Lord Jesus on this Easter home not free that you show up and I pray that you show forth your power or

and failed in other things that they see God your crater that pillar fire that's ever so near do the work because you are the great I am your change not father bless us this day give glory and honor and praise to you Jesus you have your Bibles this morning turn with me over to to Matthew chapter 27 Matthew chapter 27 and verse 62 and then we'll follow right on down to Matthew chapter 28 you're turning and looking through the scriptures and flipping through your Bible there you'll find that at this moment that we're getting ready to break into that that Jesus has done dobbed they've placed him in a tomb and we're catching a conversation that has taken place between the Pharisees and the chief priests and Pilate just to give you a background to set the set the tone of this morning service that these things have already transpired the disciples Peter has cursed he's denied the disciples are saddened but Jesus was still Jesus Matthew chapter 27 and verse 62 now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and the Pharisees came together unto Pilate saying sir notice we remember that the deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first now notice their their thought process in this they know they they call this man a deceiver they call this man and his followers deceivers and yet they're still worried yet Jesus is dead but yet there's still a worry on the inside of them that something could take place say and it's still him away and saying to the people that he has risen from the dead so that the last heir shall be worse than the first so they're trying to do some some quality control here and control the pandemic as it were because you see they thought that they had stopped them but there notice there are some things that are going through their mind that there are still some some waves that are out there that are that are coming and they're doing their best to stop them and notice verse 65 Pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch Matthew chapter 28 and verse 1 in the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead man and the angel answered and said unto the woman fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for He is risen as he said come see the place where the Lord lay may God bless the reading of the word he may be seated this morning he is not here for he has risen come and see the place where the Lord lay out of me this is the greatest day there is throughout the whole entire year Easter is a powerful day for most of the times on this day there are there are there are CEO Christians that are actually going to church Christmas and Easter only Christians but this day is more than just a day it's more than just a mark on the calendar but this day haunts Hale in a major way for this day this day our Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead you know to me it's an amazing thing when we as human beings begin to we begin to drift off into sleep that that when we go then we go to nighttime as we go and we prepare ourselves to go into into sleep and we prepare ourselves that our body can go and completely be resting completely but yet our mind can still our mind can still be racing and constantly moving it seems and yet you'll be sitting there and you'll be completely still as it were but yet your your mind is racing and you'll start dreaming all kinds of different things and there's some people that dream about there's other people that never have a dream or maybe only dream once in a while and the Prophet would tell us about dreams that that there's people that dreaming are some people that don't dream it and he was able to as a man he was able because his subconscious and his conscious were so cold that's so close that he could look as it were and he would be like a dream like you have you and I would have a dream and it would look and he would be able to see that as it is transpiring now you and I do not have that perfect recall because we're not a prophet but here this prophet he was able to see those visions because of his subconscious and conscious were so close and he would tell us that he would tell us that there are people that that dream of people that don't dream and he said there's some people's that their subconscious is way back here so they never dream and there's some people that dream all the time and you can you can have those dreams and they become so real if you've ever had a dream they become so real that they will actually cause a disturbance in your mood and disturbance in your spirit and the disturbance in your in your day-to-day activity and the Prophet would tell us now sometimes we will have dreams that that we know then we feel like they're from the Lord but brother Branham would tell us that dreams aren't accurate and he would tell us that you need an interpreter to be able to tell you what those dreams are but also notice that that God has used dreams in many ways to communicate his will to men we looked through the Bible we can look through Genesis and we can see how that how that Joseph was a man that was a dreamer and he was able to interpret dreams and even when when when Jesus was born that that Joseph was being warned by a dream because Herod was going about and he was going to slay to slay the children and so God warned him by dream so God works through dreams there even pilots wife she had she was she had a dream and right before right before Jesus came into pilot's judgment Hall she had a dream and she went and proclaimed this testimony that then she said I suffered many things because of this man and she said have nothing to do with him now you see what this dream was to pilots wife it was a string of grace to pilot to warn him to have nothing to do with this man Jesus but because of his position and because of where he was and his hardened heart that he would do the things that he'd done now you can have a dream at some times IIIi am personally a dreamer my dad sees visions but I'm a dreamer but there's sometimes I dream dreams that I've know they're not from God but sometimes I do have dreams that I know they're from God and the reason I can tell the difference is because the atmosphere that comes with the drink but also I an realize as a human being that Satan can anoint your dreams that Satan can come in and he can cause you because you are in a spot of peace and it's when you are off your guard as it were and you're laying there and you're sleeping and you begin to dream something that there's no way possible that you would dream up you dream up something that you were sitting down and at a dinner table eating carrots with a purple rabbit there's no way that you would dream up something like that but yet the enemy will come and make you and make you dream things that you would never hear there's things there's people that dream up murders and dream up all types of things and you would never dream something like that as a believer but because you are in that that state of sleep that Satan can come in through your reasoning it can come in through your affection and he can come in through through the access and he can work in that path of memory as it and and he would work through there and he can trouble you in your dreams now he's working and he'll cause disturbances because you've had a dream he'll cause fear and you cause anxiety and I was reading an article and I I'm going over these things and I'm very prepared to preach these things on Easter whether here or whether I was at camp so I'm delivering this to you this morning but I was reading an article and I found it amazing that old Fox News that they had an article about people that were having a these coronavirus nightmares because of the fear that is involved with this virus that people are actually getting so shook up that it messes up their spirit it messes up their day-to-day activity it messes up everything that they're going about they're depressed they're distraught they're they're tore up they don't know what to do and these dreams have become so affected that they're having nightmares and it's not just in the thing about these nightmares are saying is that sometimes a nightmare we'll just be once in a while but people are having reoccurring nightmares because of this virus and you see that's how Satan does he anoints in your dreams when you can't even get to you I've had to deal with believers on this that they're having nightmares and that having dreams and fear and anxiety because of this virus that is going on but you see this night these nightmares they will drive you into having a reoccurring nightmare I remember as a young child as I remember I remember vividly that I would have this reoccurring nightmare night after night and I would dream that I was in church and there I was going down to the altar and there was this great big bowling ball and it came and it knocked me down before I could get to the altar and I continuously I would have that as a child and have it as a young adult but on that day when I met Jesus Christ that nightmare was destroyed you see because you see Satan was trying to stop me from getting to Jesus but Jesus was on his way you see a nightmare also a nightmare is also it is called a bad dream it is an unpleasant dream that can that can cause strong and emotional response from the mind typically because of fear or despair or anxiety and great sadness comes along with nightmares and there's a difference between nightmares and bad dreams specifically people when they're dreaming they remain asleep during bad dreams but whereas with a nightmare they're awakened they're awakened from it and they after a nightmare that person cannot go back to sleep they're awakened out of a star and out of that state and in distress and they're unable to go back to sleep to return to sleep for a short period of time now notice in your sleep there's five different cycles of other the sleep pattern and then a normally a person that dreams is dreaming within the first 90 minutes of their sleep but yet you'll have a dream that only lasts milliseconds but it feels like it's lasted the whole night long you're sitting there you're dealing with those dreams and it's only less than milliseconds and it's happening whether in the first 90 minutes of your sleep or the last 90 minutes of your sleep and what the what scientists say is that they call this sleep REM sleep it's rapid eye movement where your eyes are constantly moving and during that REM sleep your brain is almost as active as when you were awake and in this phase of sleep when you go into this phase of sleep actually you will start breathing at a total faster pace become fast and an irregular and that's when nightmares become so vivid and they're so vivid that they can be recalled years later maybe you haven't had that dream maybe you had a drink 20 years ago but you can still recall that dream because of the effect that it had he remembers a child that you would have a nightmare and you would have to go to your parents and have to speak with them and the parent would console you and say everything's gonna be all right it was just a dream now there's also things of nightmares but there's also a thing that is called night terrors and I individuals mostly a child deals with night terrors and they deal with these things at a very early state of life and it's in it's a very it's a very traumatizing thing for a parent because your child looks awake but yet they're shaking they're they're screaming they're tired they're disturbed and you can't do nothing to console them but they'll just fall back to sleep but it takes it takes hours sometimes of dealing with these things dealing with these things of my little girl Ally she'll still wake up sometimes and have a night terror and it's and it's bothersome to you and they don't actually call something in your own spirit you didn't have the dream or you weren't going through the night terror but yet as a parent you could feel for them and you want it to break them out of it now you see the thing about dealing with a nightmare is that when you're actually in that dream you know you know sometimes that you're dreaming and you think now if I can ever get myself shook enough and wake up I'll break myself out of this nightmare and you're and you'll be able to you'll be able to collect yourself and bring yourself back to a spot but to wake up and your nightmares are a reality oh what a horrible thing so today by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you on this Easter morning on Satan's worst nightmare you see Satan is God's archenemy he's the opponent to God and I could imagine this as 2000 years ago is as Satan as he's watching all of these things transpiring he's watching Jesus as he's being betrayed by one of his closest friends Judas as all of these things are happening there's these things are transpiring and Satan is getting ready for bed on Thursday night two thousand years ago and it goes and he and he goes and he lays down and all of a sudden there's a scream running out through hell and all of a sudden that demons come a-runnin down to the master and they say master what's taking place his home I could he could imagine as Satan himself as there trembling and he's shaking and he's dealing with this thing is that I just had the awfulest nightmare what was it master well I dream that this man Jesus that then he went to the cross but yet I was defeated and he was victorious you can imagine this I can't see a demon being a car a counselor but you can imagine as the demons of Hell go to their masters hello it was just a dream Satan don't let that bother you you see you I've been the master of defeat and you have won the victory and defeat all throughout eternity as it were through the time and the space of time this man is just another man don't worry about it he's just another man so Satan drifts back off to sleep and on Friday morning Jesus goes the pilots judgement Hall they have a trial and Pilate scourges him he takes the cat of nine tails and Satan said now I see it was just a dream it was just a dream that night and he start beating Jesus and it's ripping the skin off of him and Satan starts to smirk a little bit and say no I was just a little bit disturbed in my sleep Jesus goes and he and they put him on a cross and they nail him to the cross and he starts smiling said yes it was just a dream they put Jesus in a tomb and he says oh it was just a dream they put Jesus they wrapped him in the clear in the fine linen and Satan says oh it was just a dream but this man Jesus was more than just a man you see he had said when he was walking with his disciples and he told them he said you destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again and everybody thought what he's just a man he's just another deceiver just another false prophet but what they did not realize is that he looked like a man when he was crying he looked like a man when he was being beat he looked like a man when they took the cat-o'-nine-tails and beat him he looked like a man when he was hanging on a cross he looked like a man when they put him in the tomb they looked like a man when they're after were fine linen but they did not realize that this was more than just an ordinary man this man was God himself embodied in human flesh hallelujah brother and said I can notice how everything and the soldiers are there and laughing and making fun now see you see it's daylight nothing's happened yet and they was going on see he was just a deceiver he's just a man like a lot of these deceivers that has rose up in the last days and other days and been done things but and made these claims but then all of it or wants can imagine all the little birds and the Robins quit singing and the birds stopped singing and the poet said his voice is so sweet to leave in the birds Huss their singing something was fixing to take place I can see the great morning star hanging yonder in its socket who had hung there since the beginning of time begin to move I can see it it take her circle and marry them watching it what's it doing it's an angel and it's looking around for the grave where they had laid him you see the scripture was ready to be fulfilled they were worried how they were going to move it but the scripture was ready to be fulfilled brother sister whenever a scripture of God is ready to be fulfilled don't you worry it'll be right there I can see that star take its journey moving around and I can see the Romans standing there and a hundred of them strong with their swords drawed saying now we'll see what takes place and all of a sudden this great fireball come flying from heaven stood by the grave and it turned out to be the mighty angel of God who stood there the soldiers faded and dropped like dead men on the ground with just the breasts of his hand he moved it back the stone that was laid and broke the Roman seal what does a Roman seal mean to him no more than a seal of the United States would mean or anything else you see or a seal of some church or anything else God has to live he has to come out he can't live among the dead so he moves back the stone when it rolled back in here he stood there and now who's taken over the soldiers grabbing the shields and things and running as hard as they could go down through there through the guard and down over the hill and the clanking of their material and the iron that was on them and their shields and things and there he stood alone and the Bible said in Matthew 28 and 4 that the keepers became his dead man you seek God when God comes he brings comfort to his servants when he told him to fear not but he brings terror to his enemies you see the resurrection of Christ is sub of the terror to to to the service of sin but is a subject of consolation to the sons of God hallelujah and for fear the keepers did shake and tremble these were not just ordinary men these men were Roman soldiers that were courageous they were veterans in the army but when they had seen terrible sights they had seen murders they had seen all types of calamity by an being on the battlefield they had to be men of courage but when this angel came and rolled away the stone these courageous men became trembling and shaking in fear and raining off recover they could not dream up that this man this man was more than just a man you could say that Hales worst nightmare was taking place that the royal seed was rising on that day four thousand years of death four thousand years of men dying and claim the sting of death would claim the victory but on Easter morning he proved that he was more than a man he proved that he was he was he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the dynamics in the word hallelujah if you've ever watched a good fight and you can watch that underdog as he is in that fight and there's always a turning point in a fight you can watch at it they can be blow after blow blow after blow but there is a turning point in every contest no matter what style of sport it is there's always a turning point and when they were putting the crown on Jesus head it looked like they were winning when they put the nails in his hand it looked like they were winning but on Easter morning all of the turning points all of that wrath of God was turned upon them and turned upon hail because I have power to lay my life down and power to race again he turned and proved what he said he is Easter Easter is not a day Easter is my Jesus come on somebody you can shut down the church you can shut down politics you can shut down the world but you can't shut down God you can shut down you can shut down the religions of the world but you won't shut down God and you are a part of him he cannot stop you hallelujah you may think I'm off my rocker a little bit this morning but demon powers go to sleep demon powers go to bed if you don't believe me I'll read you a quote for it prophet said I don't sleep very much at night always in prayer or nighttime is when all the demon powers shut down they shut down towards the morning when they're not roaming that's the time that the Holy Spirit moves in and talks to me go early if you want to pray rise up early he said I think I think a minister up they come to the platform not loaded down with a lot of care but out of the freshness of the presence of the Lord get out early of a morning after all the demons have gone to bed and that's the night rallies are about over and then it settles down and quiets and he smelled that sweet aroma in the sweetness and I can believe if a minister would just stay before God until he come into the pulpit he'd come as sweet smelling savior anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring the message of God to the hungry hearted people were awaiting so you see he'll has to go to sleep he'll would like to tell you that it's always there tormenting you but he'll has to go to sleep there's only one God and as I'm not pressing he's not leaving his phone he's not shook up but he's there watching over you are you with me the angels of God are encamped about them when you're sleeping I when you're awake he's still there who but you can imagine the hail the moment that that no news started spreading but the SOE n was up you could imagine the panic inhale as everything was transpiring the hell the nightmares that they had had the night when they were sleeping was transpired hell was running around running under panic Satan said I am he got the keys to my old hats he was running around he didn't know what to do and they thought now this is just a nightmare I can do something if it's only one man but for 40 days Hale had the same reoccurring nightmare he is still alive he'll say well maybe somebody won't tell it maybe nobody to tell that he's alive maybe nobody to tell that he raised from the dead we can handle this we can do quality control and handle these things if it's just one man but on the day of Pentecost come on somebody was more than just one man it was not another Jesus it was the same Jesus that rose up from the grave and it went from one man to 120 then it spread from 120 to 5,000 hell was all shook up whoo everything that they had vividly seen in their nightmares was coming to pass in front of them you see the enemy knew the enemy knew that what the Pharisees of the day was not going to move them theology will not move a demon he'll stay right there in this place because he knows that education will never lead you to a birth and that is why Satan is constantly trying to drive drive his intellectual conceptions down your throat and make you take an intellectual gospel but you see it as long as you're receiving education as long as this message is nothing but just pictures and books and things on a wall if all that is to you the demons of Hell will stay right there in their place but when the demons of Hell go to watching the manifestations of the Holy Ghost being manifested hell gets all hot and bothered they get all stirred up because they have seen this same Jesus do those works as he's doing right now he was doing the same works mm years ago on the shores of Galilee he'll get stirred up when you start serving God and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost drops down into your life he realizes that it's not just Easter in one man it's Easter in the body it's Easter in the people hallelujah brother Branham said in acts of the Holy Spirit he said brother you just let something on the phenomenal side start and watch how every rogue counted Hill would go to hollering at him craving blood true he says I tell you Peter preached the sermon on the day of Pentecost and 3,000 souls were saved and the devil never even moved out of his bed you can imagine it hail starts taking a nap and Peter Peter comes out and he starts preaching to him and you could imagine as old diablos himself he's laying there and he just rolls over and he says oh that's just Peter preaching and he rose and he stays right there he didn't bother him one bit he didn't bother hell one bit you see because there's a lot of people that preach there's a lot of people that say that that he's the same yesterday today and forever but there is a people that can prove there's a people that can prove that he is what he is and he is the same yesterday today and forever there's a lot of people that got up today and they're having their stream and they're having their virtual church service just like we're having but there is a people that are shutting on the inside of their homes when there's more than a man sitting there there's an omnipotent God the all-powerful one that's greater than any sickness greater than any disease great than any temptation greater than any fear there's a God setting on the inside of you this message it's not just another message it's not just another preacher this message is Jesus Christ completely restored back to the church hallelujah the devil never even moved out of his bed he said oh we'll just let them alone but notice it he passed through the gate called beautiful the next day and He healed a man crippled from his mother womb and all hell turned loose on him that's right and they throwed him into jail and kept him there overnight put him in the prison the inner sail there because the phenomenal the devil said I can't let this thing get started now the dead now divine healing if they do they'll really knock my props out from under me that's right cuz I might fool them around with a little theology once in a while but I sure can't fool that real thing when it comes and that people see it done he said I'll just stop this before that other group gets on the scene and he never stopped it then and they can't stop it now that's right God's gospel will move on and on and on and when there is no more heavens and when there is no more earth the word that word will still remain the same for heaven on earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away there is a real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that brings the same results that they had on a day of Pentecost you can't fool life you can't fool the real thing hallelujah Satan had a nightmare 2,000 years ago and he's still having the same nightmare the genuine bride has kept hell out of its bed hell has messed up you see it looked like he had one but Hale lost brother on I feel I feel like it I feel like that Mouse this morning where's that cat at where's that old devil that's coming torment at the bride of Jesus Christ where's that cat out I've gotten to the stimulation of the revelation of this word hallelujah hell's messed up hey ain't gonna stop us he keeps having nightmares after nightmares night terrors after night tears and he keeps waking up to the same reality that he's gonna lose and we're gonna win again and again he loses again and again he's defeated if you don't mind I'd like to tell you a little bit about your title Jesus his name is not Emanuel but he fulfilled that that God is with us it was just a title son is not his name father's not his name Holy Spirit's not his name at the title your name is mrs. Jesus Christ but I'd like to talk to you about your title today that you are Satan's worst nightmare you see in revelation of Jesus Christ so then you see why Satan is so against the book of revelations anything that's revealed spiritual revelation Satan is against us that's why he's against the ministry today because what is it the revealing of Christ let the church go over with its great denominations and organizations and little flowery messages so forth then going Satan will bother that they don't have no troubles everybody Pat's him on the back and when there comes a time that God through the Holy Ghost reveals Christ back into the church with the power and demonstrations of healing the sick and making the signs that he said he would follow the believers come to pass then Satan turns over in his bed he does something about it until that time Satan don't care how much you church join he don't care how much but when Christ reveals to you that he is the son of God and the works that he did you do also not other works but the same works you see the reason Satan hates revelation is because it upsets all of his plans hallelujah he don't like it he don't like it when you come to church but he's not bothered when you just come to church and sat there but when all of a sudden the Holy Ghost starts revealing himself to you that's when Hale starts moving out of its bed you see because he built his charts upon revelation and Jesus said the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it you see and Jesus speaking there in Revelations 3 he said I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it what is that open door it is the revelation of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ what did he say to the first church back there in his age he said I am he that was which is and shall come I am the first and I am the last I am the Almighty he said it three different times made his self deity to the first church here before he went into the last church he said I have set before you an open door and if you want to see the revelation here it is where he would build his church and the only way that he could take his church is back to the revelation of what he is that I am the resurrection and life and there is a people on earth that is working in his name that's breathing in his name that's preaching in his name and people that are fulfilling the same works that have the same life you say you have a chip on your shoulder this morning brother Andrew yes I absolutely do I absolutely have a chip on my soldier on my shoulder because I want you to realize you need to acknowledge you need there and you need to acknowledge that there is an enemy that is expecting you to be defeated and there's an enemy that it's just Darris him enough to come and knock that block off my shoulder and knock it off your shoulder I want you to know that there is a people on earth that Hale is afraid of Satan is afraid of this ministry because it's not just another Jesus this is the same Jesus the same power same work same Holy Ghost same life same oneness and Satan hates it when a man knows where he's standing that you see when Jesus was standing there in Matthew chapter 4 on on Mount temptation and Satan came and spoke to him and said it is written it is written and he ran he spoke to him you see Jesus knew where he was standing at now Satan knew the scripture better than anybody else he could quote it he could quote it from cover to cover you see he's had a long time on the job and he's been watching every move and wherever the Word of God is Satan is near are you with me you see because he's trying to block the move of the Holy Spirit but you see Jesus knew that he was a predestinated creation of God before the foundation of the world he knew who he was he knew where he was standing yet Satan could quote the word to him all he wanted to but he was quoting from a spot of knowledge quoting from a spot of wisdom but jesus knew the word by experience he knew what it said about him and he was not afraid to fulfill his portion Satan knew it by knowledge but jesus knew it by revelation and that's the reason the Word of God would work through him it's because he knew what he was the reason why the Word of God will work through a body is because the body knows who she is the reason why you have miracles is because you know who you are the reason why you have faith is because it has been revealed to you the reason why you ever see the baptism of the Holy Ghost is because you know who you are you've seen your name hallelujah you've seen your name there Satan wants to slip amnesia over all the people make them forget who they are especially in moments of crisis that they get fearful and get shell shock as it were and make you forget your birth make you forget your identity make you forget your plans make you forget the things that are set out before you just like the disciples as they were on the road to Emmaus and hear Jesus come walking and they did not recognize they were souls they were so saddened and the sheep were so scattered that in the moment of crisis they were talking about that this is the one that they thought would be the Messiah but they were so caught up in their fear and so caught up in the crisis that they had forgotten what he had said that I will go before you into Galilee but when they realized who he was and realized who they were they didn't just lollygag they ran back and told everybody hallelujah the church is here this is not a continuation of just another church but this is a continuation of the book of Acts hallelujah hallelujah he hates this message he hates this word because it exposes him it exposes who he is he fights this revealing he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation not the true Church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works that she will be an invincible army you are Satan's worst nightmare now I don't understand how everything works downhill never been there before no plan on going because my god already made a deposit for me I don't have to beat myself up over my sin because Jesus took my sin there I don't understand how everything works down in hell I can imagine if there is how it is here in this earth that Satan keeps having this reoccurring dream so Satan has to go see a psychiatrist maybe he lays out on one hand funny-looking captious lays back here puts his head hands behind his head and the psychiatrist says what's going on tell me the things that you're troubled by well I keep every time I go to bed I keep having these these awful explicit things just become out in front of me and they they war with my mind and I can't get a good night's sleep for nothing I get so tore up well hold on just a minute let me pull out these flashcards and when I pull out this flashcard tell me what you see okay this might help me get some sleep you think it will sure I'm good I bet I've done this for a long time now when I pull this when I pull this a little card out you tell me what you see Satan what do you see Oh take it away I see defeat all right what's this one Oh take it away it's the feet it's the same thing that I'm sitting night after night where here let me pull this one out what's this one that's the same Jesus that defeated me he's still coming to me in my night time well there's nothing else I can do for you then I have never worked a case like this before hey can't you give me some kind of pill settle my nerves just a little bit I get so shaky I can't hardly get a good night's sleep it seems like just when I'm gonna get myself a good nap during the day that somebody begins to pray and I start seeing the same one that I thought I had there on the cross I see him show up and all of a sudden my demons they come running back to him and said hey I thought we had powder I thought that we could whip that person but out about the middle of the day I was warring with them and I was telling them that they were going to be to feed it and they did the funniest thing they got on their knees and I don't know what happened every bit of my weapons and my tactics were stole from me psychologist can't you help me with this I'm afraid not it believes seems like it's too big a problem for me to fix little bra don't you understand that what you are torments Hell in its own sleep hallelujah what you are what you represent it's Satan's worst nightmare this skin don't scare him these eyes don't scare him this red hair don't scare him and may scare some people but it don't scare hell but the God that's packed on the inside of my soul is Satan's worst nightmare and Satan can't stop it there's a mini member body that's doing the same works she's doing the greater works because now it's not going just in one person but it's in a body it's working in China they may have our brothers shut up in prison but it's working in China they may have start churches all around the world but she still doing the greater works let me get my note cards Hale every time they go to the psychiatrist they see the same thing they see your picture my Jeffrey you you sure are looking good and I know your wife is sure happy with the way you look today but you know that just your smile it just brings it it brings a settling to her and just the way you look at her it just she said oh that's my man but you know that your picture is down on the walls of the post office inhale and I could see it that this man is wanted in the post office of Hale but the Jeffries pictures there what's he wanted for walnut for defeating Satan's army I'd say brother orange pictures there what Ford for the Phaeton Satan time after time blow after blow we're still coming out back in the victory we're on the walls of Hell hallelujah they can't get us they can't stop us they can't rob us alleluia alleluia Romans 8 and 11 this is why this is why you made it on the wall but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you hello you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh he should die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body he shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the Spirit bears witness itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God whoo that will knock hell out you need me to break out your cards again hallelujah his spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God we're the offspring of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together hallelujah hallelujah you see when they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the disciples that quicken them to a new life they had the mechanics but the mechanics would not bring them overcome in life you can set in Church who can have Everage where every to play every picture of the Prophet you can have the clouds you can have everything in order you can have the dates in order you can tell me all about it but if all you have is the mechanics you don't have enough for the rapture you're not Satan's worst nightmare setting in a mechanical spot but all of a sudden when there comes a quickening power on top of the mechanics and the mechanics and the dynamics start working together you become so filled with that quickening power that you have the same power that they had and you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you can lay hands on a dead man in Oh raise up you can lay hands you can lay hands on the sick and bearing wounds start bringing forth for life you can lay hands on the sick and cancer is defeated you can lay hands on the sick and diabetes is defeated you can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what's doing this the father is working through you now every once in a while I do have to sing that little children's song that he's still working on me and he takes that little hammer and he takes a chisel of the word and he starts knocking off pieces of Andrew Spencer every time maybe a little something that's said wrong or maybe something done wrong he starts working on me making me do what I ought to be it took in just a week to make kamut installers son in the earth Jupiter logs but he's still working and though there are frogs Jeffery as handsome as you are your wife they're still frozen I don't know why you're my point today but you are but there's flaws there and you know but there's something on the inside of you that's past all them Falls that shakes hell up I'll be honest I really enjoy when Hale gets all hot and bothered it's just I enjoy it I enjoy I enjoy when the flames get it going on him and I just like to fan it I like to give him testimonies you know you said he was going to feed us yes thank you is going to our maker but he come out 2,000 years ago hallelujah he defeated you I love reminding him of I love reminded him I love reminding him that he's that our God's greater than brain bleeds I like reminding God I like reminding Satan that our God is greater than cancer I like reminded him Iraq to reminding him when he said that he was going to rob us of our pastor with a fire but what he didn't realize there was a fourth man in the fire and there's plenty of room there's plenty of room for the fourth in this father hello the Prophet said I believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known and the Prophet said that you are delegates of his kingdom you are a person that has been authorized to act as a representative of the kingdom of heaven and he's still the same yesterday today and forever and the manifestation of the Spirit is catching a bride away hallelujah let that faith revelation fall in your heart that this is the hour hallelujah you ain't gonna wait for it you ain't got wait for it to come this is the hour this is the time can't you see this is the same or hallelujah that walked on the shores of Galilee that's working in you in bride form same power same church same anointing same thing same word I'm a psychic with Messiah power with Messiah sign she has the Kings soul and that there is victory in the opening of the word this third poll it will make storms move it'll make nature to be created it'll make tumors leave it'll make nodules beat us off it'll bring resurrection power to a little fishie it'll bring resurrection power to a man by the name of Doug Hill it'll bring salvation the lost sons and this third poll cannot be impersonated Satan can do everything he can mimic the first two polls but he cannot impersonate the opening of the word Satan you lose hallelujah your nightmares are reality hell we still come out back in a victory every time Hale thought just because your head was down that it had won the victory it seen you with its head in your head down but you raised her head and you said hey man prophet said in there will be a time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his Godhead deity through his church that the preeminence in this church oh my the anointed man now they anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by accepting what Eve turned that accept him what Eve turned now a little child when they're little fraid of the dark it's silly but what they do is they'll pull the covers up over their eyes thinking they can't be seen I can imagine hails pull hails pulling up the covers over its eyes just now stop if I don't see it it ain't real if I don't see that a happening every time he opens his eyes brother Geoffrey he still sees you hallelujah I want to be the type of Christian that when he arose out of its bed it sees me I want to be the type of Christian that Hale gets so upset when I roll out of my bed and I say thank your Lord for another day you've given me another day to make Satan have a nightmare again hallelujah hello in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power he's starting to pull the covers up a little bit more to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living God ladies the powered overcome all temptation in the possession of the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the holy ghost in the Church of Jesus Christ what so ever you desire ask in my name and it shall be given unto you Hales done got the blanket so pulled up so now so far so now and it's hanging off the end of their feet you can see Hales feet right now they're so scared because there's a people you may not be here physically but you're there in your home and you're receiving this word of this hour and you're possessing the gate of the enemy he said his seed shall possess the gate of the enemy no matter what the gate is if it's sitting this temptation sin whatever the gate is its conquered and the seed of Abraham possess it it belongs to you now which son belongs to me I care hell I care how much you horn it back if it's mine I've got every right to do with it what I want to so if if I possess the gate of temptation and the prey they possess the gate of sin and sickness you think you think I'm gonna let he'll come back and take it and torment me in the nighttime absolutely not I possess it I'm gonna do with it what I won't - I'm gonna Bowl it up in the blood of Jesus Christ I'm gonna say Satan you have no legal authority you take your hands off of God's property it's my possession you see the bride of Jesus Christ has been empowered and God has proven his word because Paul said that I can do all things through through Christ which strengthens me the Prophet said in Zechariah 4 and 6 then the answer inspecting to me saying this is the word of the Lord Zuber oh not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts the Prophet told me that year of God little children and if overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world jesus said that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you brother out it what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them there's a Church of the Living God that is Satan's worst nightmare that's laying hold on these promises and saying Satan we're coming for your kingdom we're putting you on notice your kingdoms coming down we take what our Lord and Savior said we believe it we receive it and we act upon it for he said in John 14 and 12 that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall I do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask him my name sister Brenda ask it in his name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I'm afraid it covers he's then pulled the sheets up he's gonna have to go back and make his bed after this sermon if you ask anything in my name I will do it Oh hallelujah it not only defeat Satan back then it defeats him right now because he sees what's living on the inside of you you see what fears him is because he has dealt with you before he's dealt with the God that's living on the inside of your soul before and this God that's living on the inside of you said that if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I love this quote is one of my it's one of my favorites prophet said in wisdom versus faith he said Church of the Living God here and on tape do you know where you stand do you know that you are called of God that the Holy Ghost reigns in your heart and every word of God is real to you oh brother how is how is Satan going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from go how is he going to stop them signs from following why you could throw him in jail hey if you could I don't care what you do if they're done they tried it they rotted in jails they was fed the lines they were sold asunder they were certain to pieces you can't kill him right a church that's predestinated those who he foreknew like he did Jesus he has called those who is called is justified and those who is justified is also glorified and predestinated and now in these last days with every seed sown and everything in its order this grown of our sin God got out of order and it ain't got the bride out order the world everything in order the world's in its order the time saved up the churches in its order the seed even lights the sign of love like he said as it was in the days of Sodom an angel of God the Holy Spirit coming down moving performing the signs that he did then Malachi Ford promised that he would sin in the last days what he promised and we see all of that right there and he starts singing that song hey man hey man a man a man do you love him he says sure sure right here in the last days a predestinated Church knows where they're standing Satan hates a person that knows where they're at sure I predestinated Church that knows where they're standing sewed with the seed the Holy Spirit in the church Satan be careful now I have to I have to say that's one of my favorites right there when the prophet of God has just told the realms of Hell that there's a church that knows where they're standing and he says Satan be careful why because he's flesh of his flesh she's bone of his bone she's life of his life power of his power she is him there's a broad that is rising out of Scripture she spotless she's blameless she's holy she's as if she never done it in the first place she's higher than any Congress higher than any power on earth greater than death greater than sickness and she is declaring that the head has come and what the head is done the body will do also the reason why Satan hates this word is because it's because this word places you in your position it tells you who you are and where you came from that you always were a son you have every right to claim your position behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and any but over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you we have the power to conquer every disease every affliction every spirit there is no limit to God's power death thought it won't the disciples were saddened and they thought that death had won the sky completely shut down the Sun turned its back the earth began to quake and the Stars stopped shining when the Son of God was crucified the veil was rent from top to bottom the disciples were shook up Mary the mother of James Mary Magdalene the one that they had thought was the Messiah had just died and it looked like death had won on Saturday it still looked like death had won but the Prophet said that there was a rumor that there was a rumour that he was the resurrection and the life he said all day Saturday everybody's still in despair and it looked like method 1 the flowers didn't seem as pretty the Sun as it begin to come back out didn't it seemed to have the same brilliance as it did before but death had not won because early on Sunday morning he rose to prove that death had lost its sting when the Prophet would stand there when he would stand there when the boy had Finland had been in that car wreck the Prophet said when he realized that this was the boy that he'd seen in a vision he said you can line up every demon spirit you could line up every devil in hell he said but there was nothing gonna stop that vision and he said death you can't hold him any loca and death had to kick his leave and that boy's life had to come back to him and that little boy rose up because Jesus was proven that he was the resurrection and the life and you can line up every devil inhaler this morning and there was nothing that their Heil had it had all of its tactics out it had all of its weapons of warfare out but there was nothing that would stop it they tried to stop Jesus they tried to put a stone on and they tried to stop him but they couldn't hold him there because a dead man a dead man Balilla belongs in a grave but a living man belongs on the outside you can't keep Jesus locked up in denominational creeps in traditions of men you can't keep it locked up later you can line up every devil and it ain't one of them gonna be able to stop this bride it ain't one of them gonna be able to stop golf for performing this word you see it's a true sign that you can't stop this you can't stop the move of God you can knock us you can beat us you can thrill us you can even try to kill us but will rise again sister Julia and will rise up and say Satan you loose Satan has tried to cover us sin is tried to stop us sickness has tried to slow us defeat has tried to grab victory fear has tried to paralyze us pain has tried to hurt us cancers tried to kill us denominations tried to drown us he'll try to find fault with us the key word is they tried they tried and they lose they lose every time what you're looking at is 16 elements but on the inside of these 16 elements is it God has the power in all heaven and on earth and he said that I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you I got imagine it as hell gets ready to go go to bed tonight and I think you know we stopped most of her from having Church I kind of feel like it done their job there's a lot of people that feel like they've been robbed at a Easter camp and Hale feels like it's done its job but what Hale don't realize is that this God is packing out the victory they can do its very worst but Jesus still wins he can try to stop this bride all he wants to Satan take your hands off you lose again he rose to proof that he was the resurrection in the life that he is Easter hallelujah as the musicians come brother Matthew would tell us is him being a police officer he would tell us things that when they work crashes and if it's if a car is on fire her tankers on fire that they would use the rule of thumb they've had cars on fire that tankers on fire they'd use a rule of thumb I got to question him I said what is this rule of thumb he said well he said you back up as far as you can and he said you hold up your thumb and he said if you can still see this blaze around the edges of your thumb back up so how I want you to use the rule of thumb you bet back on up because the blades just keep getting bigger you can try all you want to you can try to stop this fire the Holy Ghost but this is a fire that will not hurt us but it will hurt you it will destroy you it will rob you it
