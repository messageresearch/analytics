[0:02] hey man is that your confession to the
[0:04] Lord you give yourself away amen glory
[0:07] to God it's good to be the house of the
[0:09] Lord once again to see each and every
[0:11] one of you you know we've only I've only
[0:13] missed a couple of weekends but I feel
[0:15] like it's been even longer than that and
[0:17] the sister Bella's still at home so
[0:19] appreciate all the prayers for her she's
[0:21] doing really good she's just still kind
[0:23] of recovering and the baby's doing well
[0:25] and thank you all so much for the
[0:26] prayers and we just can't express just
[0:30] everything y'all done what it means to
[0:31] us all the way from you know from from
[0:34] the baby shower to troll the gifts the
[0:37] prayer the food and keeping the children
[0:38] and and everything like that I'm back
[0:40] and forth we just love y'all each so
[0:42] much and we appreciate y'all you know
[0:45] the brother branham said that the nicest
[0:46] thing you can say the most beautiful
[0:47] words is God bless you because he said
[0:50] if God will bless me he said what else
[0:53] more do I need so from the bottom of our
[0:55] hearts we say god bless you I could go
[0:58] on and on about what that means to us
[1:00] but god bless you and may he restore a
[1:03] hundredfold to you for everything that
[1:04] you've done we appreciate y'all we
[1:06] appreciate our church family you know I
[1:09] told about all the boys here you know I
[1:11] said you know I'm not man enough to be a
[1:13] mom
[1:16] I'm not and I'll admit it being a being
[1:19] a mother is hard work
[1:21] and it's not just a birth it's the
[1:24] reason but you know God has the special
[1:26] blessings from others you know as you
[1:29] raise your children and you know and
[1:31] everything like that you you you pastor
[1:33] them brother Ram teaches us and you
[1:35] raise them in the admonition of God and
[1:36] when they grow up you know they'll live
[1:39] for God even if they're straight you
[1:41] know I came from a big family and I
[1:43] remember as a child I'd be out playing
[1:45] and my mom would call us in
[1:47] she'd call us in and she'd pray you know
[1:51] sometimes there's a child when you tell
[1:52] him about the Lord it may not seem like
[1:54] it sinks into him too much they're
[1:56] playing and you try and tell them or
[1:58] they'll ask you a question and and you
[1:59] try and say something about the Lord may
[2:01] seem like it all don't sink in maybe
[2:04] they'll just say something but you know
[2:05] you're sowing seed you're sowing seed
[2:08] and that young tender young tender life
[2:11] and every child comes into this world as
[2:13] a blank slate and it's our job as
[2:16] parents to show that word above anything
[2:18] so that word because as the Bible says
[2:21] when they get older it won't depart from
[2:23] Amen so we're not gonna keep you
[2:25] standing by god bless Sean we love y'all
[2:27] with all of our hearts and preciate
[2:28] y'all and appreciate the opportunity to
[2:30] speak if you will turn with me to 2nd
[2:33] Corinthians chapter 3 Thank You
[2:36] musicians thank you brother Matt for the
[2:39] wonderful song service second
[2:42] Corinthians chapter three so lengthy
[2:48] reads so I'll try and read rather
[2:49] quickly the Bible says do we again do we
[2:54] begin again to commend ourselves or need
[2:56] we as some other epistles of
[2:58] commendation to you or letters of
[3:00] commendation from you ye are our epistle
[3:03] written in our hearts known and read of
[3:06] all men for as much as you're manifestly
[3:09] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[3:11] ministered by US written not with ink
[3:13] but with the spirit of the Living God
[3:15] not in tables of stone but in fleshy
[3:18] tables of the heart and such trust have
[3:21] we through Christ to God word not that
[3:24] we are sufficient of ourselves to think
[3:26] anything is of ourselves but our
[3:27] sufficiency
[3:28] is of God who also hath made us able
[3:31] ministers of the New Testament not of
[3:34] the letter but of the spirit for the
[3:35] letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[3:38] life but if the ministration of death
[3:40] written and engraven in stones was
[3:42] glorious so that the children of Israel
[3:45] cannot steadfastly behold the face of
[3:47] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[3:49] which glory was to be done away how
[3:51] shall not the administration of the
[3:53] spirit be rather glorious for if the
[3:56] ministration of condemnation be glory
[3:57] much more death administration of
[4:00] righteousness exceed in glory for even
[4:03] that which was made glorious had no
[4:05] glory in this respect by reason of the
[4:08] glory that Excel ahthe for if that which
[4:10] is done away was glorious much more that
[4:12] which remaineth is glorious seeing then
[4:15] that we have such hope we use such great
[4:18] plainness of speech and not as Moses
[4:20] which put a veil over his face at the
[4:23] children of Israel could not stedfastly
[4:24] look to the end of that which is
[4:26] abolished but their minds were blinded
[4:28] for unto this day remain at the same
[4:31] fell untaken away in the reading of the
[4:32] Old Testament which veil is done away in
[4:35] Christ but even unto this day when Moses
[4:39] is read the veil is upon their heart
[4:41] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[4:43] Lord the veil shall be taken away now
[4:47] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[4:49] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[4:52] but we all with open face beholding as
[4:56] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[4:58] changed into the same image from glory
[5:02] to glory even as by the Spirit of the
[5:05] Lord amen let's bow our heads and our
[5:06] hearts to Congress as Heavenly Father
[5:09] Lord we're so thankful the Lord and
[5:10] honored for this opportunity to come in
[5:12] your presence and Lord Jesus as we come
[5:14] father we've come to make you the center
[5:16] of this service we've come to exalt you
[5:18] we've come Lord to look into your word
[5:20] Lord and see where we fall short Lord
[5:22] and where we can draw closer to you I
[5:24] pray that you minister to each and every
[5:25] heart lord I pray that you minister
[5:27] healing to those that need healing may
[5:29] you minister salvation to those that
[5:31] need salvation may administer
[5:32] deliverance to those who need
[5:34] deliverance or need in a way that only
[5:36] your Holy Spirit can we loving we commit
[5:39] ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name
[5:40] Amen amen
[5:42] she may be seated in the presence of the
[5:43] Lord amen
[5:45] you know les last weekend as I said we
[5:47] weren't able to be here but we certainly
[5:48] enjoy streaming the services and I know
[5:50] that y'all had a wonderful time here
[5:51] with brother Tim and you know Sunday he
[5:56] I believe he preached on atmospheres and
[5:57] how important it was to come and set the
[5:59] right atmosphere and and he might have
[6:02] brought an atmosphere of a two-hour
[6:03] sermon so if it's a little lengthy I
[6:06] pray that you just forgive me but we'll
[6:08] just trust the leading of the Lord y'all
[6:10] pray for me
[6:11] amen I want to start with the title this
[6:14] this evening is mama that's me that's
[6:19] the title title of the sermon with the
[6:21] help of the Lord now I want to begin
[6:22] with a quote because you know God's Word
[6:26] is a mirror like we just read in the
[6:28] text so if we want to see what God wants
[6:32] of us we got to look into his word and
[6:34] when we're christ-like and we look into
[6:37] the word it should reflect back the
[6:38] character of Christ brother Aaron says a
[6:41] little boy one time down here in
[6:44] Kentucky raised up in the mountains he
[6:46] had never been around where there was a
[6:48] lookingglass
[6:49] they had a little piece tacked up on a
[6:52] tree but he had never seen himself he
[6:54] come here to Louisville it was told and
[6:56] stayed with his mother's sister and she
[6:58] lived in one of the nice homes an
[7:00] old-fashioned home that went into one of
[7:03] the bedrooms had a door that had a
[7:04] mirror all up it the way all the way up
[7:08] and down the door and a few brothers
[7:10] don't have a few single brothers don't
[7:12] have that any I was homey I wait y'all
[7:13] get married it's coming and when the
[7:17] little fella started running all through
[7:19] the house
[7:19] he stopped little Johnny saw little
[7:23] Johnny C and he scratched his head and
[7:26] little Johnny in the mirror scratched
[7:28] his head he laughed a little and Johnny
[7:30] in the mirror laughed he jumped up and
[7:32] down and little Johnny jumped up and
[7:34] down in the mirror see he walked up real
[7:36] close he thought it was a little boy he
[7:38] could play with and so he walked up
[7:39] directly he picked on the glass he
[7:43] turned around and his parents were
[7:44] watching him he said mama that's me
[7:49] he said mama that's me so I want us to
[7:53] note here that this was a full-length
[7:55] mirror the mirror was on the door and
[7:58] the door is Christ
[8:01] now you say brother William you're
[8:03] reading too much into that quote that's
[8:05] a little too much let me read a part of
[8:08] another quote where the Prophet said I
[8:09] have to preach one of the most powerful
[8:11] sermons he's ever preached Christ is the
[8:13] mystery of God revealed he's preached he
[8:15] preached that sermon and forgave it he
[8:17] took the whole Bible as his text and at
[8:19] the end they're singing and they're
[8:20] praising the Lord he says so I just
[8:21] wondered today I'm sorry he goes down
[8:25] and he says not knowing of course being
[8:28] spiritual you watch spiritual things not
[8:33] knowing this God knows it but if you
[8:34] turn and look at the clock it's on the
[8:37] dot two o'clock the end of the second
[8:39] poll the third poll is at hand and the
[8:43] prophet of God took that sign right off
[8:44] a clock and he said see if your
[8:46] spiritual you watch spiritual things so
[8:50] that this mirror that it sounds like it
[8:53] was even really random himself because
[8:55] when he gives his life story says how
[8:56] his daddy used to shave off of just a
[8:58] piece of a mirror so when his dad would
[9:01] shave you could only see a part of
[9:03] yourself and as we've come through the
[9:05] his string coming down through the
[9:06] church ages of the bride there was a
[9:08] town where they only had a part of the
[9:10] word and they could only see a part of
[9:12] their reflection but there comes a time
[9:15] where that mirror is now a full-length
[9:17] mirror and the Bride of Christ can look
[9:19] at her reflection in the mirror of God's
[9:22] Word and make sure she's dressed right
[9:24] to make sure she talks right to make
[9:27] sure she lives right to make sure she's
[9:29] ready for the rapture this is God's
[9:31] full-length mirror and it's on the door
[9:33] Jesus Christ because you know when
[9:36] Luther Luther was one of the messengers
[9:39] he was in the right hand of God but do
[9:41] you know that Luther drank beer do you
[9:45] know that Luther was not too fond of
[9:47] Jews they didn't understand that God had
[9:50] a blinded juice to make a way for you
[9:52] but they only understood in part because
[9:54] the book was still sealed
[9:56] but God has allotted us this day a
[10:00] full-length mirror
[10:02] when Wesley come along the mirrors a
[10:04] little bigger they can see a little more
[10:05] all Luther could see was the just shall
[10:06] live by faith
[10:08] but as as the bride progressed she's
[10:12] able to see more and now we're able to
[10:14] see in fullness now the Bible is not
[10:19] just the book the Bible is not just a
[10:22] book of do's and dont's the Bible do you
[10:26] know the secret the Bible is actually a
[10:28] family album the Bible is a family album
[10:32] that you can go back and find your
[10:35] picture now now to understand spiritual
[10:39] things a lot of times God teaches as the
[10:41] Prophet says that God teaches us
[10:42] spiritual things by natural occurrences
[10:45] because we're human and that's how we
[10:46] understand things that's how we see God
[10:48] in creation that's how we see God in
[10:50] many ways is through natural things so
[10:53] if you'll bear with me I'll get a little
[10:55] bit in the natural to bring about a
[10:56] spiritual application I come from a big
[11:01] family a family of 13 children and I'm
[11:05] number 12 yes now let me just say this
[11:10] I'm not trying to catch up to them I'm
[11:13] not trying to catch up to them I'm pie
[11:17] praise the Lord
[11:19] but I appreciate a big family it's
[11:22] wonderful but you know as a bore LaVon I
[11:26] can go get the family album and I can
[11:30] look right through that family album
[11:33] even before I was born
[11:35] now I wasn't born till 1983 but yet I
[11:38] could look my parents used to be
[11:39] Romanian so I could look into the family
[11:41] album and see that was before I was born
[11:43] but I'm denta fide with them when they
[11:46] were in another country way across the
[11:48] sea I turned a few more pages oh this is
[11:52] when they went to Italy for three months
[11:54] waiting to be clear to come in America
[11:56] okay this is 1979 this is when they
[11:58] landed see the family album is beginning
[12:02] to to develop I'm able to look well that
[12:05] there comes a time when I've got to find
[12:06] my own picture in there if I'm in the
[12:08] family I've got to find my own picture
[12:10] in there so there comes a time whenever
[12:13] oh there's a picture my mom she was
[12:14] pregnant with me
[12:15] there's a picture of me in the hospital
[12:16] there's a picture of me when they
[12:18] brought home there's a picture of me as
[12:20] I was walking and you're able to
[12:22] identify yourself within the family
[12:24] album and this is God's family album and
[12:28] you're able to look back and say that is
[12:30] when brother Adam and sister evil put it
[12:33] to flesh this is where brother Adam and
[12:37] sister Eve disobeyed and they were taken
[12:40] out of the garden it was before you were
[12:42] born but you're identified in that
[12:44] you're identified in that this is when
[12:47] my brother Noah built an ark this is
[12:51] when they rejected his message this is
[12:55] when my brother Joseph was rejected of
[12:59] his brother and he was cast into a pit
[13:00] this is when my brother Joseph was
[13:02] exalted to the right hand of Pharaoh
[13:04] this is where my brother Moses called
[13:06] for plagues and delivered Egypt and your
[13:08] going on down this is where sister my
[13:10] sister Miriam danced when her enemy was
[13:13] dead on the seashore this is where it
[13:15] was this is the family album I wasn't
[13:17] born yet but I can see it in the
[13:19] scripture and I can identify with it
[13:21] because I'm of the same family and I can
[13:26] say mama that's me Miriam danced over
[13:31] her enemies and we danced over our dead
[13:33] enemies mama that's me we look in God's
[13:35] mirror and we see the same thing we see
[13:38] brother Abraham oh he was an important
[13:41] brother we see what God did for him we
[13:45] see sister Sarah sister Rahab we see
[13:48] brother David we see how he slew Goliath
[13:52] we see when our daddy became flesh
[13:56] that's the most beautiful part of the
[13:58] scripture we see when our daddy became
[14:01] flesh and we seen how they rejected him
[14:02] we've seen how he's crucified and as you
[14:05] go through the family album and he
[14:07] flipped through it you see it getting
[14:08] closer to when you were born you see it
[14:10] getting closer to the age that you were
[14:11] born now the way we know that that the
[14:18] way I know that I am in my natural
[14:20] family is I can identify myself in the
[14:23] family album and I bear the natural
[14:25] characteristics of my parents and my
[14:27] siblings
[14:29] so we as the children of God should be
[14:33] looking into the family Alba and you've
[14:34] got to find your picture in there it's
[14:36] not enough to find Jesus's picture it's
[14:39] not even enough to find brother
[14:40] branham's picture there in there because
[14:42] why they're in the family but you have
[14:45] got to find your own individual picture
[14:48] in here that is equivalent to finding
[14:51] your name in the book and when you find
[14:54] your name in this book when you find
[14:57] your picture in God's family album
[15:00] no devil in Hell can ever take it out no
[15:03] Dylan Hill could ever talk to you that
[15:04] you're not a child a son or a daughter
[15:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ because why you
[15:09] found your picture you'd say saying I'm
[15:12] right here I'm right here and you can't
[15:17] do nothing about it you're in God's
[15:20] family album you're in God's album now
[15:24] if you can't find yourself and give the
[15:28] family album that means you have
[15:29] spiritual amnesia when you cannot when
[15:33] you flip through your family album God's
[15:34] family album and you can't identify
[15:36] yourself that means you have spiritual
[15:38] amnesia
[15:39] just like when someone gets amnesia and
[15:42] they don't recognize who their parents
[15:43] are anymore they don't recognize what
[15:45] family they belong to because they have
[15:47] a condition called amnesia in this
[15:51] generation brother branham diagnosed the
[15:54] entire generation with spiritual amnesia
[15:56] and that's why God sent a prophet to be
[15:59] able to get the scales off of our eyes
[16:01] that we actually are a part of God and
[16:05] that brother Alden you can be no more
[16:07] destroy than God can that's a part of
[16:10] God that is being an attribute of God
[16:12] when the prodigal son left in the New
[16:14] Testament the Bible says that he came to
[16:16] himself he was out in the world he was
[16:19] eaten with the pigs but bRILINTA he one
[16:21] day he came to himself he said wait a
[16:24] minute I'm over here and I would love to
[16:26] eat with the pigs Arion and my servants
[16:28] in my father's house is he and much
[16:30] better than them i'ma go and submit
[16:32] myself and see if they'll at least take
[16:35] me as a servant he came to himself and
[16:39] that's what every child of God has got
[16:40] to do
[16:41] are out in the world they're out in the
[16:43] Pigpen of the world they're out in sin
[16:44] and they think that that's life but one
[16:47] day you come to yourself you come to
[16:50] yourself and you realize this ain't my
[16:51] food I'm not supposed to be a chicken
[16:54] I'm not supposed to eat them eat out of
[16:55] the manure pile of the world I was an
[16:57] eagle and I was born to fly what is that
[17:01] your skills fall off your eyes brother
[17:04] branham hath to realize one day that he
[17:07] was not the son of Charles and Ella
[17:09] Branham he had to realize that he was
[17:12] come from another parent and that's the
[17:15] same revelation that we must each and
[17:17] every one of us get now I want to talk
[17:20] about a type versus the anti-type
[17:22] brother Graham said he was a typology
[17:26] every child of God is a type all just
[17:28] because that is where you find your
[17:29] pictures and the types and shadows that
[17:31] is how brother Brian was able to preach
[17:33] now a type the people in the Bible that
[17:37] you read do you realize that they type
[17:39] you do you realize that you are actually
[17:42] the anti-type of the types of the Bible
[17:45] do you realize brother on that you that
[17:48] brother David typed you do you realize
[17:52] brother Andy that Shamgar typed you you
[17:56] don't type them they type you you're not
[17:59] pointing to them they're pointing to you
[18:03] that's the difference
[18:05] so the anti-type is a person or thing
[18:09] that is foreshadowed or represented by a
[18:12] type or symbol especially a character or
[18:15] event in the New Testament prefigured in
[18:18] the Old Testament brother Branham said
[18:22] if there's an anti-type there's got to
[18:23] be a type for that anti type to come
[18:25] from and everything I say that is true
[18:28] has a type it has a type you have a
[18:30] shadow on the Bible said the old things
[18:32] was a shadow of new things to come
[18:36] you don't type Rebecca Rebecca types you
[18:43] they were living out their lives in the
[18:45] natural speaking of who was to come the
[18:47] prophets in the Old Testament type Jesus
[18:49] Christ Jesus Christ didn't come to type
[18:51] them they were pointing to him so if the
[18:56] bride is part of the bridegroom if God
[18:59] is in the Bible this so is the bride so
[19:01] is you don't ever let say and tell you
[19:03] that it's only that the Bible is only
[19:06] you can only find God and the prophets
[19:08] in there where was Eve the Eve was in
[19:13] the side of Adam so if Eve is a part of
[19:18] Adam then where Adam is Eve is you have
[19:22] just as much right you are going you are
[19:23] co-equal with Jesus Christ co-equal now
[19:29] this message that we have isn't just a
[19:32] Reformation this message that we have
[19:35] isn't just an ideology to be a better
[19:37] person to be a good neighbor
[19:39] this message is Jesus Christ himself the
[19:42] Bible says that the Lord Himself
[19:45] descended from heaven with a shout this
[19:48] message is not just a Reformation this
[19:50] message is not just restoration of gifts
[19:52] this message is him it is him that is
[19:57] why the rapture didn't happen through
[19:58] the church ages it couldn't it's the
[20:01] full grain is the seed the very seed
[20:04] that went into the ground is now ripened
[20:06] on the end because that is where do you
[20:09] find the seed in the fruit if you have
[20:13] no idea what a peach seed looks like
[20:15] bite into a peach and eat it all the way
[20:17] to the seed and that's where you have it
[20:19] that is why the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[20:22] is duplicated in this endtime exactly as
[20:25] he had it because we're we're back in
[20:27] seed form it's harvest time you don't
[20:29] harvest you don't harvest a shuck you
[20:31] don't harvest at the tassel you don't
[20:32] harvest the stem you harvest the wheat
[20:35] so if we're in a harvest time there's
[20:37] got to be some wheat in maturity staying
[20:39] in the presence of the Sun getting
[20:41] humbled getting all the greenness and in
[20:43] maturity baked out so we are tight by
[20:49] Bible characters they were the shadow
[20:52] Jesus was reality and so is the bride
[20:56] now when Jesus came remember he came as
[20:59] anti-titan and Jesus had to find where
[21:03] it was written of himself brothers and
[21:07] sisters that that is so powerful it can
[21:10] never be it can never be overstated
[21:13] to be able to stand so pat on the word
[21:16] that you know exactly what's written of
[21:19] you and you know exactly where you
[21:22] belong Satan can't move you Satan
[21:25] couldn't move Jesus Christ from what at
[21:27] the position he held in hebrews 10:7
[21:29] then said i he's quote Paul is quoting
[21:32] David there lo I come in the volume of
[21:35] the book it is written of me to do thy
[21:38] will O God now listen to this quote the
[21:41] Easter still brother M says now as a
[21:43] promised Messiah he quickened every word
[21:46] that was prophesied that he would do
[21:48] heal the sick and how he was born of a
[21:50] virgin all that made it is true he was a
[21:53] word manifested here on earth but he
[21:57] could not do this just as a man it taken
[22:02] the Spirit of God dwelling in him to
[22:05] quicken these promises to him so Jesus
[22:10] was a man he was a god man but as a man
[22:13] he would open up the scrolls and he'd
[22:15] read the word but it took the Spirit of
[22:18] God to say this is you this is you Jesus
[22:23] read the Saint the Book of Jonah just
[22:25] like you read it but when joke when
[22:28] Jesus read Jonah he said Papa that's me
[22:32] and he could proclaim destroy this
[22:36] temple but in three days I'll raise it
[22:38] up
[22:38] why because Jonah because the life of
[22:43] Jonah and what David wrote sinners saved
[22:47] by God's grace Jesus based he was God
[22:51] think about this he based such a
[22:53] statement upon what a man wrote he said
[22:58] destroy this temple and in three days
[23:00] I'll raise it up God didn't come down
[23:02] from heaven as necessarily speak to him
[23:04] in a vision he read it in the word
[23:06] that's where he read it he interpreted
[23:09] the word for his own day and hour and
[23:12] he's able to say as it were mama that's
[23:15] me that's how he was able to do that
[23:19] brother Ram says as a man he couldn't it
[23:21] took the spirit of God in him to quicken
[23:24] him to that word now he goes on to say I
[23:29] hope that we get this real clear now
[23:31] Jesus being a man himself but it took
[23:33] the spirit in him the spirit it's not me
[23:36] that doeth the works it's my father that
[23:39] dwelleth in me he's the one that does
[23:41] the works he Jesus himself was the word
[23:43] further down he said so then that was
[23:47] God's promise all the way from the
[23:49] Garden of Eden that Jesus would be here
[23:50] he was that man born of a virgin but it
[23:53] taken the Spirit of God to quicken that
[23:57] word to him so if it took the Spirit of
[24:00] God to quicken that word to him it takes
[24:02] the Spirit of God to quicken the word to
[24:04] us because we're a part of him and then
[24:09] it gives you faith to stand in the face
[24:11] of Satan himself right upon this word
[24:13] and say it is written we're gonna get to
[24:16] in a minute but jesus said this that is
[24:18] written is yet to be accomplished to me
[24:21] when he was at the Passover this that is
[24:24] written Jesus knew what was written what
[24:28] was fulfilled what is being fulfilled
[24:30] and what will be fulfilled
[24:32] do you realize Bride of Christ you're
[24:34] the only church on the earth that can do
[24:35] that
[24:36] to this capacity to be able to look back
[24:38] all the way the Garden of Eden before
[24:40] the Garden of Eden before God was God
[24:44] before God was God you were there no
[24:51] other church could go back before God
[24:53] was God yeah you go so far back in the
[24:57] mind of God before even angels born
[24:59] before even Satan was born you were
[25:00] there you were there because you have
[25:06] the same capacity that he does you had
[25:08] no matter how young or old or what your
[25:10] background is a child with the Holy
[25:12] Ghost can open this word and you have
[25:14] the same authority that Jesus Christ had
[25:17] you have the same you can apply in the
[25:19] same way it's not your prophecy to be
[25:21] born of a virgin but it's your prophecy
[25:24] to change
[25:25] it's your prophecy to be healed
[25:27] it's your prophecy to defeat the Satan
[25:30] and overcome later I'll see ya that
[25:32] prophecy is given to you you've got to
[25:34] recognize that you've already been seen
[25:36] as an overcomer it taken the Spirit of
[25:41] God to quicken that word to Jesus let's
[25:45] think of Jonah for a while
[25:46] Jonah had to be in the belly of that
[25:49] fish
[25:50] for three days and three nights now I
[25:54] would imagine humanly speaking that
[25:56] Jonah learned his lesson really quick he
[26:00] learned his lesson really quick but he
[26:02] had to stay in that if you'll forgive me
[26:05] thinking belly for three days and three
[26:08] nights now some of you I know some of
[26:14] you brothers hunt and when you're
[26:16] dressing a deer and you accidentally
[26:17] Nick that stomach it'll make his hunk on
[26:22] three-forty smell like a bouquet of
[26:24] roses let me tell you he was yet he was
[26:27] in that program said that God provided
[26:29] an oxygen tent for him and yet he had to
[26:33] stay there for three days and three
[26:35] nights because he was living out a
[26:38] prophecy he was naturally living it out
[26:41] and we're gonna go through examples in
[26:44] the Bible where people were naturally
[26:45] living hard circumstances for your
[26:48] benefit they were living it out it
[26:51] seemed everyday Ellie's or was just
[26:53] going to get a wife for Isaac but yet it
[26:57] spoke of prophecy it spoke of a volume
[27:00] and spoke of a mass of people called out
[27:03] in the end time represented about one
[27:06] mayor geniune so Jonah had to be in the
[27:11] belly of that whale for three days and
[27:12] three nights to represent him being in
[27:14] the heart of the earth for three days
[27:15] and three nights he couldn't come out
[27:17] any sooner and do you know that Jesus
[27:19] himself could not have arisen he was God
[27:21] he could not have risen any any quicker
[27:24] than within three days brother Graham
[27:26] said he was barred by the scripture
[27:28] brother Matthew
[27:28] there was literally
[27:30] to their that Jesus couldn't cross their
[27:34] scripture there that God cannot cross
[27:36] God is held accountable to his own word
[27:39] think about that that's the kind of God
[27:41] we serve that when he says something he
[27:43] holds his own self accountable to that
[27:47] that's the God that we were that's the
[27:49] God we serve for that would not suffer
[27:52] my soul to be in hell
[27:53] that will not leave my soul in Hell
[27:55] neither without suffer thine Holy One to
[27:56] see corruption jesus answered and said
[27:59] unto them destroy this temple and in
[28:02] three days I will raise it up so as I
[28:06] said the prophets the Saints the
[28:07] patriarchs of the Old Testament had to
[28:09] go through very unpleasant things to
[28:11] type you you're enjoying the spiritual
[28:15] benefit of their hardship in the natural
[28:18] when they were starving when they were
[28:19] being sawed asunder and now you're
[28:22] enjoying a reaping the benefits we're
[28:25] enjoying a reaping the benefits of what
[28:26] this caught this message costs brother
[28:28] branham the time it caught it costs away
[28:30] from his family the time that it costs
[28:33] him the agony the things he had to deal
[28:34] with it came at a heavy price the
[28:39] Gentile widow woman was starving with
[28:40] her son in the Old Testament there but
[28:43] yet she was calling and producing my god
[28:45] to entertain Elijah but yet whenever her
[28:48] whenever she looked at her son and she'd
[28:50] see him starving it it looked like a
[28:51] wonderful thing there was a drought no
[28:55] rain or Dew of three years and yet God
[29:00] sent her a prophet and she sustained him
[29:02] and as she and now she and her house
[29:06] heavy in many days and we've got
[29:08] spiritual food in due season her husband
[29:12] died her son was starving it wasn't fun
[29:15] but that was the age that she lived that
[29:18] out in the natural so you can benefit in
[29:21] the spiritual Absalom he had to rise
[29:24] against David why because he was
[29:26] foreshadowing something a David had to
[29:29] be rejected he had to go up that same
[29:32] Hill brother on and crying as he was a
[29:33] rejected game because he was
[29:36] foreshadowing the son of David
[29:42] so brother branham came as Malachi 4:5
[29:45] he had to be identified in the scripture
[29:47] in Moses and Elijah and Joshua but you
[29:50] know brother Aaron was the anti-type
[29:52] Joshua would go in here to conquer
[29:54] natural land but we're conquering
[29:57] greater spiritual land so where you find
[30:03] the bridegroom you're gonna find the
[30:04] bride you can't separate God from his
[30:07] word you can't separate the bride from
[30:09] the word you can't separate the bride
[30:11] from him from Jesus Christ
[30:12] oh no injustice 221 and the Lord God
[30:16] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[30:18] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[30:21] and closed up his flesh instead thereof
[30:24] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[30:26] from man made a woman and brought her
[30:28] unto the man and Adam said this is now
[30:31] bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
[30:33] she shall be called woman because she
[30:37] was taken out of man she's called bride
[30:41] because she's taken from the bridegroom
[30:44] she is him in st. power same Authority
[30:51] same work same faith same love she's him
[30:53] she's Jesus Christ on the earth do you
[30:55] realize that tonight the bride of Jesus
[30:57] Christ is Jesus Christ on earth in
[31:00] bright form now listen he says and as he
[31:07] being the groom the bride has come forth
[31:08] because it's a part of him and it can
[31:11] only be manifested of the fulfilling of
[31:13] all the revelations any others has spoke
[31:16] of the bride it can only be made
[31:18] manifest if it does something different
[31:21] from the groom it isn't the bride
[31:23] because she's flesh of his flesh bone of
[31:25] his bone life of his life power of his
[31:28] power
[31:28] she is him as man and woman are one and
[31:32] the woman taken from his side she has
[31:35] taken a spirit the feminist spirit from
[31:37] him the flesh from his side made both
[31:40] mechanics and dynamics the wife remember
[31:47] when Jesus was on earth he was able to
[31:50] say search the Scriptures
[31:53] for in them he spoke to the world to the
[31:56] religious world of his day he said
[31:58] search the scriptures in these
[32:02] scriptures you think you have eternal
[32:03] life but in fact they are they that
[32:07] testify of me that's what he said
[32:10] but do you know the bride has the same
[32:12] testimony search the scriptures these
[32:16] denominations they think they have
[32:17] eternal life and these scriptures are
[32:19] testifying of who we are that we're here
[32:24] Lord Ram's said that the bride is a
[32:26] manifestation of this our brother Steven
[32:29] the fact that we're here we're a
[32:33] manifestation of God's Word
[32:38] and he said also this day this scripture
[32:41] is fulfilled in your ears now as I said
[32:45] people can find Jesus in the Bible and
[32:48] people can flip right to where brother
[32:50] Branham is but can we flip to where we
[32:53] are remember this is God's album can we
[32:56] look in here and God's mirror and say
[32:58] mama this is me where it scratches his
[33:03] head we scratch ours we look into God's
[33:08] Word and we see our reflection and we're
[33:10] changed from glory to glory on the road
[33:13] to emmaus brother M says watch here the
[33:16] word itself remember Jesus was
[33:18] resurrected and I want us to understand
[33:21] that this that this message is the exact
[33:23] duplication is an exact type of the
[33:27] resurrection of Jesus Christ remember
[33:30] brother and says in the days of Luther
[33:31] is just a rumor and the days of Wesley a
[33:34] little more but then now he's proved it
[33:35] and he's walking along and he begins to
[33:40] open his preach and all about himself
[33:42] and as he's walking to Cleopas and his
[33:45] friend on the road to Emmaus they're all
[33:46] bummed out because they thought that
[33:48] Jesus was gonna do this and Jesus should
[33:49] restore the Kingdom of Israel and he
[33:51] should have done this but he's crucified
[33:52] what are we gonna do Peter said I'm
[33:54] going fishing I don't know what's going
[33:56] on this ain't working out like we
[33:57] thought and they're on the way to Emmaus
[33:59] and Jesus steps out and Jesus begins to
[34:02] he said why are you so sad and he begins
[34:05] to tell them
[34:07] and Jesus said you know he began to tell
[34:09] him are you are you a stranger here
[34:10] don't you know what's happened and she
[34:11] said what's happened and then Jesus
[34:14] begins to to tell him and Britain the
[34:18] Bible says that beginning at the
[34:19] prophets when Moses he expounded all
[34:21] scripture concerning himself that's what
[34:26] it was all about all the scripture is he
[34:29] did exactly brother Andrew what the
[34:31] scripture said he do the disciples were
[34:33] bummed and he was crucified and laid him
[34:35] in a tomb and he came along and he told
[34:37] them this is exactly what the word said
[34:39] what happened to me so whenever he got
[34:41] him shut in he did something that was
[34:44] very very familiar to them the way he
[34:47] broke that bread the disciples realized
[34:50] that's him the way the prophet of God
[34:55] preached this sermon the way he
[34:59] discerned the thoughts of Sarah's hearts
[35:00] the way he did things the bride realizes
[35:04] that's him
[35:05] that's not a man that's Jesus Christ
[35:08] using the vessel of a man and how do how
[35:12] do we recognize Jesus Christ brother
[35:14] Nathanael in this message the way he
[35:17] broke bread rather Davey the way he
[35:19] breaks the bread of eternal life is how
[35:21] we recognize him that's him that's Jesus
[35:23] Christ the same yesterday today and
[35:24] forever brother Aaron says watch here
[35:28] the word itself quoting the word of
[35:32] himself the word itself quoting the word
[35:36] of himself now I'm gonna just pause
[35:41] there let that sink in Jesus Christ was
[35:43] the word and he was able to get the word
[35:45] and he was the Word made flesh and he's
[35:47] able to to quote the word the word was
[35:50] quoting the word about himself the bride
[35:54] is supposed to do the same thing when
[35:59] the church world hasn't heard don't
[36:01] believe in miracles and don't believe in
[36:03] the things of God and they always look
[36:04] to Jesus on the cross we have him alive
[36:07] in our midst
[36:09] walking in our midst breaking the bread
[36:12] just as he always did but we've got to
[36:14] recognize it we've got to as the word
[36:17] made flesh we're quoting the word the
[36:21] word quoting the word concerning herself
[36:25] just as he did because she is him same
[36:29] power same authority but you've got to
[36:33] have the Holy Ghost to do this not to
[36:37] tell them that he was that but just let
[36:38] the word speak for itself what was it
[36:42] that Jesus said the works speak if you
[36:45] don't believe me believe the works they
[36:48] speak for it for who I am but just let
[36:52] the word speak for itself when they then
[36:54] they know who he was the letter of the
[36:56] word quoting the the word in flesh
[36:58] program says the word in flesh quoting
[37:02] the word of the letter being fully
[37:05] identified in himself do you realize the
[37:11] wonderful blessing it is to be able to
[37:13] flip to in God's family album and find
[37:16] your picture that confirms that you're a
[37:19] child of God you don't need flesh and
[37:21] blood to confirm your child of God God
[37:23] confirms your child of God he's the one
[37:27] if I've got his approval that's all I
[37:28] need if you have his approval that's all
[37:30] you need God's approval do you know
[37:36] whenever the angel of the Lord met
[37:37] brother Branham in the cave that night
[37:39] and brother Graham began to make excuses
[37:41] as Moses be given remember Moses made
[37:45] excuses about how bad he stammered and
[37:46] about the people aren't gonna listen to
[37:48] him brother branham and that same spirit
[37:50] made the same excuses and the angel of
[37:53] the Lord took brother Branham where to
[37:56] the scriptures he said as Moses was
[37:59] given to science you'll be given to
[38:01] science and that in that video 20th
[38:04] century prophet brother Aaron says that
[38:06] he not only gave him about Moses he told
[38:08] him about Nathaniel and Philip he told
[38:10] him about the woman at the well and if
[38:12] you notice he's always using them
[38:13] examples on tape because he it's not his
[38:17] message
[38:18] he's given that message out and he's
[38:21] doing exactly what the angel told him to
[38:23] do so the angel of the Lord took God's
[38:26] prophet William and Branham to the word
[38:30] and show him this is where you fit in as
[38:33] Moses they did this to Moses as Moses
[38:36] had two signs you're gonna have two
[38:38] signs as Moses called the people out in
[38:40] the first Exodus you're gonna call the
[38:41] people out in the third axis it was
[38:44] God's God showing brother branham his
[38:47] picture in the Bible now in Genesis 5:24
[38:52] the Bible says that in anak walked with
[38:55] God and he was not for God took him now
[39:04] as we go through these scriptures I want
[39:05] you to say to yourself or out loud
[39:07] however mama that's me Enoch was the
[39:14] seventh from Adam we're in the seventh
[39:17] church age from the second Adam and God
[39:20] translated Enoch being the seventh from
[39:22] Adam and he's going to translate us
[39:24] being in the seventh age from Adam see
[39:28] and he can say mama that's me I'm the
[39:31] seventh from the second Adam you see
[39:35] yourself in God's album Enochs
[39:39] revelation so please God you know
[39:42] brother Aaron say there were three
[39:43] Bibles one was in the stars one is in
[39:47] the pyramid and one is here Enoch in
[39:50] mystery form built the pyramid and he
[39:52] wrote God's second Bible and it's so
[39:55] pleased god of his complete revelation
[39:57] that God raptured him and I mentioned
[40:00] earlier that the bride on earth now has
[40:03] got something that no other age has ever
[40:04] had that she can see from before God was
[40:06] God all the way to will never would
[40:08] gather back again in the Garden of Eden
[40:10] and it's gonna so please God that God is
[40:15] going to change you in the Adams brother
[40:18] Shannon
[40:18] it so pleases god of your revelation it
[40:22] so pleases god of how you walk to this
[40:25] word and your love toward the word and
[40:27] your attitude for the word that god will
[40:28] literally change you in the atoms and
[40:31] how do you know because you've already
[40:33] been typed you're the anti-type Enoch
[40:37] was raptured as one individual the bride
[40:39] will be will be raptured as a
[40:40] multi-member body from around the world
[40:45] mama that's me when milk hesitant
[40:49] compared to Abraham and remember brother
[40:52] Branham was so clear and direct he'd
[40:53] preach about milk hesita keep preaching
[40:55] about Abraham and then he turned around
[40:57] just like this and he'd say I'm gonna
[40:59] turn my back to the audience and do the
[41:00] exact same thing and people still miss
[41:02] it
[41:02] you talk about spiritual amnesia people
[41:05] still miss it how many times have you
[41:07] have you heard him say on tape he talked
[41:09] about the hams and God changing the name
[41:11] and he said now Graham means father
[41:14] nations and he's got six letters but
[41:16] Abraham has got seven letters and he'd
[41:19] leave you hanging just like that he
[41:21] wasn't say bran ham has seven letters
[41:24] too that was for you to catch and he say
[41:27] six is the number of man but seven is
[41:29] God's number and Abraham God gave him
[41:32] literally gave him part of his name mama
[41:38] that's me coming out of an exodus
[41:42] applying the token mama that's me we're
[41:46] in Goshen the world is under judgment
[41:48] under place mama that's me we've got the
[41:52] token apply we've got the lamb killed
[41:53] we're eating we've got we've got or
[41:55] we've got our shoes on ready to go staff
[41:59] in the hand nothing lead nothing to hold
[42:00] us here mama that's me
[42:04] we received God's message and we've got
[42:07] that scarlet scarlet thread that Rahab
[42:09] lay right on the edge of the wall she's
[42:11] on the edge of the city wall and that
[42:12] was a token now she experienced that so
[42:18] God's prophet can come preach the token
[42:20] to you that that scarlet thread you
[42:23] don't we don't paint over our houses red
[42:25] we don't leave we don't leave red ropes
[42:27] out of our windows but we are to apply
[42:30] the token on our homes in
[42:32] our lives because that was a type and
[42:35] you're the anti-type ruth coming back in
[42:39] harvest time mama that's me that's me
[42:44] right there let's go to 2nd Kings 8th
[42:49] I'll show you a picture
[42:54] so if Satan ever comes against you wants
[42:56] to see a picture don't believe that
[42:59] you're in God's album you can show them
[43:01] the second Kings 8 then spake and I want
[43:05] you to catch as we read I wanted you I
[43:07] want you to catch keywords here because
[43:10] every word every jot every tittle on the
[43:12] word is for a reason then speculation to
[43:14] the woman whose son he had restored to
[43:16] life saying arise and go through a nine
[43:19] household in sojourn thou Kent
[43:24] wheresoever that can sojourn for the
[43:25] Lord had called for a famine and it
[43:27] shall also come upon the land for seven
[43:30] years for seven years there's not going
[43:33] to be any food in seven years and seven
[43:35] church ages is not gonna be quite the
[43:38] spiritual food in the due season and the
[43:42] woman arose and did after the saying of
[43:44] the man of God and she went with her
[43:46] household and sojourn in the land of the
[43:49] Philistines seven years now listen to
[43:51] these words and it came to pass at the
[43:53] seven years end that the woman returned
[43:58] out of the land of the Philistines and
[44:00] she went forth to cry unto the King for
[44:03] her house and for her land and the king
[44:07] talked with Gaza and the servant of the
[44:08] man of God saying tell me I pray thee
[44:10] all the great things that Elisha had
[44:12] done and it came to pass as he was
[44:14] telling the King how he had restored a
[44:15] dead body to life that behold a woman
[44:17] whose son he had restored to life cried
[44:20] to the King for her house for her land
[44:22] that was her inheritance that she came
[44:24] to the king for and Gaza said my lord o
[44:28] king this is the woman this is her son
[44:30] whom Elisha restored to life and when
[44:33] the King asked the woman she told them
[44:35] so the king appointed unto her a certain
[44:41] officer
[44:42] saying restore all that was hers and all
[44:49] the fruits of the field since the day
[44:52] that she left the land even until now
[44:56] now is that your picture did God did you
[45:02] did a bride as a hold leave the land of
[45:05] the father's to sojourn and at the end
[45:08] of them seven years God appointed a
[45:09] certain officer called William Branham
[45:11] to restore all that the woman lost and
[45:14] bring us right back to the place right
[45:17] back to Pentecost right back not to
[45:20] Isuzu story Pentecost back to the land
[45:22] of the fathers Pentecost mama that's me
[45:28] that's me that's my picture
[45:31] she might have struggled up in that land
[45:33] she might have struggled in the land of
[45:34] the Philistines she might have struggled
[45:36] in I have food to eat but now you're
[45:40] reaping the spiritual benefit because
[45:42] you're the anti-type of her hardship you
[45:45] are the anti-type of her type in the
[45:47] bible the king appointed his prophet and
[45:53] he ordered him to restore everything
[45:55] back to the church all the power she
[45:57] lost all the false you remember that
[45:59] because remember whenever they came out
[46:02] in the Reformation they were still
[46:03] baptizing in titles they were still
[46:07] baptizing and Father Son and Holy Ghost
[46:09] so everything wasn't quite restored but
[46:11] God was in that process of a restoration
[46:13] but here we are full circle back to a
[46:16] full restoration that is why you had the
[46:19] hope of a translation that is why you
[46:21] have the hope of a rapture that is why
[46:24] we have the hope of the Resurrection to
[46:26] happen now let's go to another picture
[46:31] in God's album God's album is beautiful
[46:33] in there let's go to Joshua 18 beautiful
[46:37] album it's wonderful seeing your picture
[46:40] in the album ain't it it makes you feel
[46:43] good not emotionally it just anchors
[46:49] something in your soul it enters
[46:51] something in your soul because you know
[46:54] you're able to take the things that the
[46:56] Prophet said right back to the Bible and
[46:59] see yourself and you're able all it does
[47:02] is prove the message it's all it does
[47:06] when people don't bring their
[47:08] understanding of the message back to the
[47:10] Bible they end up in some crazy doctor
[47:12] nonsense when people don't take don't
[47:14] all they want is the Bible they don't
[47:15] care about the prophets message they end
[47:17] up and all kinds of crazy nonsense you
[47:20] bring the two together and your eyes are
[47:22] right your vision is right that's when
[47:26] you that's catching the vision that's
[47:29] kitchen the vision okay
[47:30] in Joshua 18 verse 1 let's and the whole
[47:33] congregation of the children of Israel
[47:35] assembled together at Shiloh and set up
[47:38] the tabernacle of the congregation there
[47:39] and the land was subdued before them and
[47:42] there remained among the children of
[47:44] Israel seven tribes which had not yet
[47:47] received their inheritance and Joshua
[47:50] said it to the children of Israel how
[47:52] long were you slack to go to possess the
[47:54] land which the Lord God of your father's
[47:56] have given you give out from among you
[47:58] three men for each tribe and I will send
[48:01] them and they shall rise and go through
[48:02] the land and describe it according to
[48:04] the inheritance of them and they shall
[48:06] come again to me and they shall divide
[48:08] it into seven parts anything sounded
[48:13] familiar yet Judah shall abide and their
[48:17] coasts on the south and the house of
[48:18] Joseph shall abide and their coasts on
[48:20] the north and they shall therefore
[48:22] describe the land into seven parts was
[48:29] not this book sealed with seven seals
[48:33] described seven parts but the Levites
[48:38] have no part among you for the
[48:40] priesthood of the Lord is their
[48:41] inheritance and GAD and Reuben and half
[48:43] the tribe of Manasseh have received
[48:45] their inheritance beyond Jordan on the
[48:46] east which Moses the servant of the Lord
[48:49] gave them and the men arose and went
[48:51] away and Joshua charged them and that
[48:53] went to describe the land saying go walk
[48:55] through the land and describe it and
[48:57] come again to me that I may hear cast
[48:59] lots for you before the Lord in Shiloh
[49:02] and the men went and passed through the
[49:04] land and described it by cities into
[49:06] seven parts
[49:08] in a book and came again - Joshua - the
[49:12] hostess Shiloh and Joshua cast lots for
[49:15] them and Shiloh before the Lord and
[49:16] there Joshua divided the land unto the
[49:20] children of Israel according to their
[49:22] divisions mama that's me that's me and
[49:30] they you read that chapter further on
[49:32] and you see that Joshua actually sat in
[49:34] the door the door is Christ and he gave
[49:38] out the inheritance because that land
[49:40] was yet to be taken mama that's me now
[49:49] when you look at the history of Israel
[49:51] we understand that Israel types the
[49:53] church is that right you look at the
[49:55] history of Israel and you're able to see
[49:57] the spiritual application that we're now
[49:59] living in and we understand that when
[50:01] Israel was carried off into bacteria
[50:04] into captivity they were into captivity
[50:06] for 70 years and this is very vital to
[50:10] understand because it types the seven
[50:12] Church ages so whenever you're reading
[50:15] the word and you see that Israel was in
[50:18] captivity for seven decades that is a
[50:20] type of the seven church ages then after
[50:22] that God sends Ezra and Nehemiah to
[50:26] rebuild a city and to set things in
[50:28] order and that's what God has done in
[50:31] this day now I want to read a quote that
[50:33] brother Branham read or said in the
[50:35] message of desperations and he's reading
[50:38] at a jeremiah the 29th chapter in the
[50:40] 10th verse and he says and we're now
[50:43] going to read from jeremiah the 29th
[50:45] chapter in the 10th verse for thus saith
[50:47] the lord that after seventy years be
[50:50] accomplished at babylon i will visit you
[50:53] and perform a good word unto you towards
[50:55] you in causing you to turn to this place
[50:58] do you notice that all three examples
[50:59] that we reading is all about restoration
[51:01] is all about coming back is all about
[51:03] getting your inheritance for I know the
[51:07] thoughts that I think of you isn't that
[51:09] sweet brother Ram says saith the Lord
[51:12] though thoughts of peace and not of evil
[51:15] to give you an accepted end then shall
[51:18] you call upon me and he shall go and
[51:20] pray unto me and I will hearken unto you
[51:22] and ye shall seek me and find me when ye
[51:24] shall search for me with all your heart
[51:26] and I will be found of you saith the
[51:28] Lord and I will turn away your captivity
[51:30] and I will gather you from nations and
[51:32] from all the places where I have drove
[51:33] you saith the Lord and will bring you
[51:36] again unto the place that I caused you
[51:39] to be carried away captive brother em
[51:43] says back to Pentecost he clarifies and
[51:47] he says I put that in myself it doesn't
[51:49] say that that's what I was meaning to
[51:53] the church because see Saints the the
[51:56] Bible is a love letter it's a love
[51:58] letter and here you have brother Branham
[52:01] teaching us how to read God's love
[52:02] letter brother Branham what was in
[52:06] desperations and he said see he means
[52:09] back to Pentecost it's a restoration
[52:12] back that's why this this message is not
[52:15] you know I don't know why I keep feeling
[52:17] pressed to say this but this message is
[52:19] not just another move of God it's just
[52:21] another move of God and after a certain
[52:23] amount of time another move of God is
[52:24] gonna come and we're gonna walk in that
[52:25] this is it this is harvest this is the
[52:29] seed after this is to the father it's to
[52:32] the garner it's harvest time remember
[52:37] though that remember the bundling is
[52:39] bundling time and we see the church's
[52:41] bundling themselves for the World
[52:43] Council of Churches so Ezra and Nehemiah
[52:50] are also all about restoration now I
[52:53] want to reach you Scofield's notes here
[52:55] because I remember I believe it was when
[52:56] brother team was here for the Labor Day
[52:58] meetings he made the point that when
[53:00] people left in the first exit is only a
[53:02] small percentage left many of them
[53:04] stayed that is a biblical principle
[53:08] that's a biblical principle listen to
[53:10] what Scofield says he says he's talking
[53:12] about the restoration he said but the
[53:13] mass of the nation and most of the
[53:16] princes remained by preference in
[53:20] Babylon and Babylonia and Assyria where
[53:24] they were prospering the post captivity
[53:26] books deal with the feeble remnant which
[53:29] alone had a heart for God
[53:32] the bride is just a remnant most people
[53:36] are happy in the world they're happy
[53:39] they're in their denominations they were
[53:41] happy to stay behind whenever they work
[53:43] there were that successful things going
[53:45] on whenever this prophet came from the
[53:47] desert and with a long beard and an
[53:49] awfully cracked skin and says that we're
[53:51] supposed to go in the desert I'm doing
[53:55] great right here I've never been so
[53:57] prosperous why should I follow a crazy
[53:59] prophet who who whose claims he met a
[54:01] pillar of fire
[54:03] he claims he met an angel and I'm
[54:06] supposed to follow him I'm doing so good
[54:08] right here now remember not only did a
[54:14] small percentage actually leave Egypt
[54:16] but the book of Acts tells us that in
[54:18] their hearts they already turned back
[54:19] they wanted to go back they were on
[54:21] their journey but they wanted to go back
[54:23] so if this if that was the anti tight
[54:26] why are we so surprised when people
[54:27] leave the message why are we so
[54:30] surprised when people turn their backs
[54:31] on the message when they've already been
[54:33] foreshadowed doing that you can see that
[54:38] you can see their picture too but it's
[54:41] not the same like yours it's not in the
[54:42] family album it's not in that section so
[54:47] listen to this in Ezra chapter 2 verse
[54:49] 61 they're coming back and when they're
[54:52] coming back they've got they've been in
[54:53] Babylon for 70 years and they've got to
[54:55] look up genealogies they've got to get
[54:57] things figured out who belongs to who
[54:58] and the children of the priests the
[55:01] children of Hawaii the children of cause
[55:03] the children of Mazzarelli which took a
[55:06] wife of the daughters of bazarov the
[55:08] giddy eight and was called after their
[55:12] name these sought their register among
[55:17] those that were reckoned by gian ology
[55:19] but were not found therefore were they
[55:24] as polluted put from the priesthood they
[55:28] took on the wives name what do people do
[55:32] today join a church I'm Pentecostal I'm
[55:36] Methodist I'm Baptist they take home
[55:39] blasphemous names
[55:42] and if they don't come out they're gonna
[55:44] find themselves with the mark of the
[55:46] beast and which means they can't find
[55:49] their genealogy in here because they
[55:51] took her name instead of his name we
[55:54] take his name
[55:56] everything we do word or deed in the
[55:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[56:01] baptized in his name we bury in his name
[56:03] we're healed in his name were saved in
[56:05] his name we live in his name
[56:07] you sisters raise your children in his
[56:09] name you brothers work out there among
[56:12] the world in his name you stand as a
[56:14] lighthouse a city set on a hill which
[56:18] cannot be hid you got to be married and
[56:23] sold out to this word and absolutely
[56:24] nothing else no matter what it costs
[56:28] cousin Nehemiah says in those days also
[56:31] I saw Jews which had married the wives
[56:32] of a shot of Ammon and of Moab and their
[56:35] children spake half in the speech of a
[56:38] shot and could not speak in the Jews
[56:42] language but according to the language
[56:45] of each people so they the way they
[56:48] talked was not the Jewish language which
[56:53] means they were raised by serpents II
[56:56] nations we there's only one language the
[56:59] bride has and that's this right here
[57:02] that's the only language we know we
[57:05] don't know about joining churches we
[57:06] don't know about the denominator we
[57:07] don't speak their language
[57:08] we don't speak let's all get together in
[57:11] the way that they do because you
[57:13] remember they take jesus's prayer that
[57:14] they that with that they may all be one
[57:16] and they try and put that in an
[57:18] ecumenical slant we don't speak the
[57:21] language of let's all go join with wrong
[57:23] let's all go join with another Church we
[57:26] don't speak that language because we
[57:28] know how to talk we know God's language
[57:31] we know what what what thus saith the
[57:33] Lord is we know we know how to say the
[57:36] right thing to die the church world does
[57:39] not know how to say the right thing to
[57:41] God the church world don't know nothing
[57:44] about it and it's just God's grace to us
[57:50] it's God it's God's grace to us that
[57:53] when you get on your knees and you pray
[57:54] that you don't end it
[57:55] in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[57:56] that is God's grace to you it is God's
[57:59] grace to you that you're even here it is
[58:02] God's grace to you that you even have an
[58:04] inclination to the word it's God's grace
[58:07] to you that you even have a desire to be
[58:09] here and we should never take honor this
[58:12] is said all the time of these brothers
[58:13] but these services we should never take
[58:16] a single service for granted because any
[58:20] service can be the last for us as an
[58:23] individual or for us as a body of
[58:26] believers and the rapture can come I'm
[58:29] sorry I don't believe in sprinkling I'm
[58:35] sorry all right thank you so all three
[58:40] examples was like a vision all three
[58:43] examples is about restoration now the
[58:48] Word of God thank you brother Matthew I
[58:50] know it the Word of God is like a vision
[58:55] and before a vision can take place
[58:59] everything has got to be put in order
[59:01] remember brother I'm describing a vision
[59:03] the hats got to be here the old lady's
[59:05] got to be there that's how the Word of
[59:07] God is someone said to me not long ago
[59:13] said brother Branham I would give
[59:15] anything if I could see a vision I put
[59:18] my arm around on a real brother I said
[59:20] my beloved brother every time you open
[59:22] the Bible you see a vision every time
[59:26] because let me bring something to your
[59:27] attention do you realize that every
[59:31] vision every dream and every revelation
[59:35] has got to come back to this every bit
[59:39] people in the denominational world have
[59:42] gifts and they'll have all kinds of you
[59:45] remember other than talk on tape about
[59:46] some man had a crazy dream about how he
[59:48] left his wife to go marry this one and
[59:50] he just thought that scar but it didn't
[59:51] line up with this you bring everything
[59:54] back to this you bring your life you
[59:57] bring your vision you bring any dream
[59:59] you bring any idea something pops in
[1:00:00] your head is that the Lord speaking to
[1:00:02] me well let me see you open God's vision
[1:00:04] and you see you see am I supposed to
[1:00:07] marry this person open
[1:00:09] or to see open the word and see and if
[1:00:13] the word tells you not to do it don't do
[1:00:15] it don't do it God's not gonna override
[1:00:18] your free moral agency but don't do it
[1:00:20] then you'll pay for it
[1:00:22] so everything must be in place God is a
[1:00:25] God of order
[1:00:26] he's got the Abraham class in this order
[1:00:29] it's got lot in his order sodomites are
[1:00:32] there in their order and we can't be
[1:00:36] changed until the resurrection see God
[1:00:39] has an order we see the resurrected ones
[1:00:43] first and then we're changed now I want
[1:00:49] to switch gears here just a little bit
[1:00:54] I'll put this up here I'll switch gears
[1:00:57] here a little bit and I want to go
[1:00:58] through some very familiar stories but
[1:01:00] that brother Ram tells and that's
[1:01:01] another thing
[1:01:02] just like parables in the word whether
[1:01:05] Josh it's for a reason God doesn't just
[1:01:10] put stories in here
[1:01:11] every story that brother entails on tape
[1:01:15] is almost like a prophecy or almost like
[1:01:18] a type remember about that really really
[1:01:20] poor woman who couldn't even afford
[1:01:22] nothing and and the government came to
[1:01:24] try and help her out and her son was
[1:01:26] somewhere in India and and they asked
[1:01:28] her they're trying to kind of figure out
[1:01:29] exactly how much help she needed and
[1:01:31] things and and he's just telling the
[1:01:32] story and and he talks about how well
[1:01:35] you know I don't have any money but my
[1:01:37] son you know I don't want to bother him
[1:01:38] for money but he sends me some of the
[1:01:39] most beautiful pictures and and they
[1:01:42] said well can we see him where are they
[1:01:44] and she said oh they're in my Bible
[1:01:46] they're in my Bible she was rich and
[1:01:50] didn't even know it she was rich and
[1:01:54] didn't even know it so I want to speak a
[1:01:58] minute or read a minute about the woman
[1:01:59] in Memphis because there's power with
[1:02:03] associating yourself and stepping into
[1:02:06] the scripture because the Scriptures not
[1:02:09] do's and don't it's a blueprint if you
[1:02:11] do what they did in the same faith
[1:02:14] you're going to get the same result so
[1:02:18] we're all familiar with the story
[1:02:19] brother Branham was going through and
[1:02:20] his plane got got grounded
[1:02:23] thing and he's going along humming a
[1:02:24] song and he sees a black lady there with
[1:02:27] that shirt tied around her head
[1:02:29] and he's walking by and she said good
[1:02:32] morning parson I said how'd he do Annie
[1:02:35] it caught me parson I looked around said
[1:02:37] do you know me she said yes sir I said
[1:02:39] do you know my name she said no sir I
[1:02:41] said how did you know I was a parson
[1:02:44] she said parson did you ever hear about
[1:02:47] the Shunammite woman now you see how
[1:02:50] she's identifying herself with the
[1:02:52] Shunammite woman
[1:02:53] so she's identifying herself with a
[1:02:55] Shunammite woman thus unite woman had an
[1:02:57] elisha well she's like the Shunammite
[1:02:59] woman and she needs an elisha see she's
[1:03:02] stepping into the scripture with such
[1:03:05] faith that God is now about to give her
[1:03:08] the desire of her heart she said parson
[1:03:12] did you ever hear about the shemite
[1:03:13] woman that had a baby the Lord promised
[1:03:15] her the baby and the baby died and I
[1:03:16] said yes she said I was a woman that way
[1:03:20] see how she's sympathizing she's getting
[1:03:22] to the scripture she's getting into that
[1:03:24] Channel and I promised the Lord that I
[1:03:26] raise my baby for him and she said the
[1:03:29] Lord give a husband and I a lovely boy
[1:03:31] so he went off and we know the story
[1:03:34] there and he said and I got down on my
[1:03:35] knees and I sit and I and said I prayed
[1:03:38] and said I prayed Oh loud set eyes a
[1:03:41] woman like the shunammite where is your
[1:03:45] Elijah and just begin to pray and said I
[1:03:50] prayed and prayed and said this morning
[1:03:52] just before daylight said the Lord said
[1:03:54] stand at this gate now parents God has
[1:04:00] given children our blessing from the
[1:04:01] Lord so God has given you children so it
[1:04:05] doesn't matter where sin has taken them
[1:04:07] it doesn't matter where they are in life
[1:04:09] God gave them to you you're like the
[1:04:12] shin oh my and they may be dying in sin
[1:04:14] apparently they may be going through
[1:04:16] something but you do like do like her
[1:04:18] says eyes like that shunammite woman I
[1:04:20] was like that shooting my woman God you
[1:04:23] gave me that child and I'm not gonna
[1:04:25] lose it I'm not gonna let Satan kill it
[1:04:28] I'm not gonna let say and take it to an
[1:04:30] early grave I'm not gonna let
[1:04:31] and take it to hell because she because
[1:04:34] God gave her that boy God gave you your
[1:04:39] child and he could have given you anyone
[1:04:42] else but he gave you someone specific
[1:04:44] and you keep holding that token and he
[1:04:46] stepped it to the scripture and you
[1:04:48] stand between in that bridge you stand
[1:04:50] into that place for your loved one and
[1:04:53] what was the testimony of the boy mama
[1:04:56] is getting light mama it's getting light
[1:04:59] in here so the secret of getting in the
[1:05:04] scripture is getting the mind of Christ
[1:05:06] that's the secret
[1:05:08] you get into the mind of Christ because
[1:05:10] the mind of Christ don't come here that
[1:05:11] this is where this is the greatest
[1:05:13] battle ever fought is right here the
[1:05:15] mind of Christ comes right from the
[1:05:16] heart so that is why you hear you hear
[1:05:20] these brothers make statements you know
[1:05:21] you you hear but all it takes is that
[1:05:23] once you hear the voice behind the voice
[1:05:25] well why is it that sometimes ministers
[1:05:28] will quote the same thing over no yeah
[1:05:30] I've heard that the Satan will tell you
[1:05:31] oh I've heard that scripture for I can
[1:05:33] say it I know it yep yep I said it yeah
[1:05:36] yeah we've heard it so many times but if
[1:05:39] we ever let it drop from here to here in
[1:05:43] the heart that's where faith goes into
[1:05:46] action
[1:05:46] here's mental faith but we need real
[1:05:50] godly Bible faith you know that's how
[1:05:54] sister had it right got what she wanted
[1:05:56] it wasn't with her own mind
[1:05:58] brother I'm sitting there building the
[1:05:59] church she pledged $50 or so and brother
[1:06:03] never would only take 20 brother and
[1:06:04] said he had $20 in his pocket to go give
[1:06:07] back to her and he said something said
[1:06:08] to him that Jesus seen that Widow
[1:06:10] casting two mites and two pennies in the
[1:06:13] Treasury and he didn't stop her so what
[1:06:15] do you do you have sister Hattie right
[1:06:16] being right in the middle of Scripture
[1:06:18] and not even realizing it she's in the
[1:06:21] inspiration of the word a widowed woman
[1:06:23] with nothing as poor as dirt
[1:06:27] but God let just like he let that with a
[1:06:31] woman cast all her living right into the
[1:06:33] Treasury the same thing for sister Haley
[1:06:36] right God allowed her to give that $20
[1:06:39] and look what she's looking look at the
[1:06:40] investment you talk about an investment
[1:06:42] and fasting in the kingdom of God you we
[1:06:45] were to give everything we've got to
[1:06:47] this word we're to give everything we
[1:06:49] have you know when a woman one day came
[1:06:53] and anointed Jesus he anointed his feet
[1:06:58] and the disciples began to murmur and
[1:07:02] things and Jesus said let her alone
[1:07:04] why trouble ye her she hath wrought a
[1:07:08] good work on me for ye have the poor
[1:07:10] with you always and whensoever you may
[1:07:12] do to them good but she had not but me
[1:07:15] not have always she had done what she
[1:07:18] could she has come aforehand to anoint
[1:07:20] my body to the bearing verily I say unto
[1:07:24] you wheresoever this gospel shall be
[1:07:27] preached throughout the whole world this
[1:07:29] also that she had done shall be spoken
[1:07:31] for a memorial of her the same can be
[1:07:34] said about sister Hattie right how many
[1:07:35] pulpits is she mentioned in every single
[1:07:37] service around the world what she did as
[1:07:40] inspiration is now preached as a
[1:07:42] memorial to her because she stepped into
[1:07:45] the scripture do you know that Adam was
[1:07:48] a God of the earth an amatuer God
[1:07:51] brother Branham teaches us and God gave
[1:07:53] him because he had the mind of Christ
[1:07:55] God gave him the authority to name the
[1:07:57] animals it gave him the authority to
[1:07:59] tell this mountain to be moved that he
[1:08:01] gave him the authority till this tree
[1:08:03] and the wind to stop and things like
[1:08:04] that
[1:08:05] and then God said amen to it
[1:08:08] God said amen whenever Adam said this is
[1:08:13] a lion Gus said amen when he said feed
[1:08:16] her with a beak you're an eagle God said
[1:08:19] amen
[1:08:20] God said amen to what Adam said when
[1:08:23] Joshua got in that same channel he said
[1:08:25] son stand still moon you stand here God
[1:08:29] said Amen I say you say how do I know
[1:08:32] God said Amen because it comes to pass
[1:08:34] and God is honor to bring your word to
[1:08:37] pass when you get into that channel not
[1:08:40] your own carnal thinking and we all have
[1:08:41] our own carnal thinking but it takes to
[1:08:44] get into that channel in the inspiration
[1:08:45] of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:46] and be able to have your version of that
[1:08:49] ain't nothing but the truth and receive
[1:08:50] what you need but it takes the
[1:08:52] inspiration of the Holy Ghost to do so
[1:08:54] not your own idea
[1:08:57] so you have Jesus the second Adam he
[1:08:59] comes and he says comes up to a fig tree
[1:09:01] and says no man eat of you and God said
[1:09:04] amen Jesus stood on the Braille of a
[1:09:06] boat and he said peace be still
[1:09:08] God said amen jesus said thy sins be
[1:09:12] forgiven thee and God said amen jesus
[1:09:16] said it is finished
[1:09:18] and God said amen brother branham one
[1:09:23] day was walking across a field and he
[1:09:26] was confronted by that bull and he said
[1:09:27] you go that divine love it wasn't him he
[1:09:29] was looking for his gun
[1:09:30] remember his carnal mind was looking for
[1:09:32] his gun like ours wood or a tree or
[1:09:34] something but all of a sudden something
[1:09:36] came and took over and he said bull I'm
[1:09:38] sorry to serve you you go and lay down
[1:09:40] and what did God say Amen God said Amen
[1:09:45] when then wasps came to attack him and
[1:09:48] he that same divine love now why did God
[1:09:52] allow these examples to be done to the
[1:09:54] Prophet to show that you can walk in the
[1:09:56] same channel it wasn't just for brother
[1:09:57] Branham it wasn't just for Jesus the
[1:10:00] works that I do shall you do also we're
[1:10:03] thrilled to read these stories we're
[1:10:05] thrilled we believe them with all of our
[1:10:06] hearts but it's for you it's for you
[1:10:08] it's for you it's for me to walk in this
[1:10:11] channel now don't in your own carnal
[1:10:14] mind go and slap a wasp nest because
[1:10:16] you're gonna that's not gonna work you
[1:10:19] wait you're the wrong channel that's
[1:10:20] right you wait until God puts you in
[1:10:22] that channel when brother Branham was in
[1:10:27] the mountains of Colorado and he told
[1:10:29] the storm to go back God said amen
[1:10:33] whenever his sister Mita had that tumor
[1:10:36] and he by the inspiration of the Holy
[1:10:39] Ghost because remember he was praying he
[1:10:41] was getting with the doctors and what
[1:10:42] should we do can we put it off we really
[1:10:44] trust in Lord for her healing and Lord
[1:10:46] will be not have enough faith he was a
[1:10:47] human and he had struggled Lord of all
[1:10:50] the miracles he's seen of all the prayer
[1:10:51] lines he still said Lord do we just not
[1:10:53] have enough faith well why is this tumor
[1:10:55] not leaving and one day the inspiration
[1:10:57] of the Holy Ghost came and said before
[1:10:59] the doctors hand touches her side it's
[1:11:02] going to be gone and God said
[1:11:06] man God said Amen now this is I'm about
[1:11:12] to read something then things that you
[1:11:14] hear all the time but let it strike
[1:11:17] verily I say unto you whatsoever you
[1:11:19] shall bind on earth shall be bound in
[1:11:21] heaven whatsoever he shall loose on
[1:11:23] earth shall be loosed in heaven again I
[1:11:25] say unto you that if two of you shall
[1:11:27] agree on earth as touching anything that
[1:11:30] they shall ask it shall be done for them
[1:11:32] of my father which is in heaven
[1:11:35] are in all things he later says
[1:11:38] whatsoever you ask in prayer believing
[1:11:39] ye shall receive
[1:11:41] now I want to ask y'all an honest
[1:11:42] question and please don't raise your
[1:11:44] hand unless you mean it you take
[1:11:49] whatever desire that you have on your
[1:11:51] heart and put on your right now whether
[1:11:54] it's healing salvation the Holy Ghost a
[1:11:58] loved one okay now that's y'all's
[1:12:01] question if brother Branham was here and
[1:12:04] he he was getting ready after this
[1:12:05] service to have a prayer line how many
[1:12:07] would have complete confidence that when
[1:12:10] you go through that prophets prayer line
[1:12:11] that you get the desires of your heart
[1:12:14] okay
[1:12:16] amen yes we believe it because we
[1:12:19] believe him and we believe his ministry
[1:12:21] now I want to take that another knotch
[1:12:23] if Jesus Christ himself was here in his
[1:12:26] earthly ministry and we were in
[1:12:28] Palestine and we were you know we were
[1:12:30] in synagogue and we were telling you and
[1:12:31] say he was off somewhere and we were
[1:12:33] gonna tell him we were believers and
[1:12:34] because we would be and we were - and
[1:12:37] Weavin and I told you he's gonna be
[1:12:39] coming back here in a few weeks and
[1:12:41] we're again we're gonna ask him to come
[1:12:42] and he's gonna pray for all of you how
[1:12:45] many of you would have enough faith to
[1:12:46] believe that when Jesus laid his hands
[1:12:48] on you and prayed for you you to get
[1:12:51] what you wanted okay now hold it right
[1:12:56] there because I've set you up for this
[1:12:58] quote because if you can if we can get
[1:13:02] ahold of this quote that I'm about to
[1:13:03] read to you I promise you there won't a
[1:13:06] sick person leave that building they
[1:13:08] won't a single lost person leave that
[1:13:10] building there won't a single person
[1:13:12] without only ghost leave that building
[1:13:13] this building I mean if we can just get
[1:13:17] a hold of this quote I'm about to read
[1:13:18] to you
[1:13:19] brother branham said then if ye abide in
[1:13:22] me and my words abide in you then you
[1:13:27] have God the word in you and you believe
[1:13:31] the word just as you believe God because
[1:13:35] it is God and it's inseparable then if
[1:13:40] you have God's Word in you you have
[1:13:43] God's life in you now I'm gonna go slow
[1:13:46] and kind of emphasize I want us to get
[1:13:48] this if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:13:51] you have everything if you have the Holy
[1:13:54] Ghost there's no there's no stopping you
[1:13:56] have to constantly grow but if you have
[1:13:58] the Holy Ghost you've got him you've got
[1:14:00] the word you've got the very life of
[1:14:02] Jesus Christ and he promised that if
[1:14:06] that spirit that raised Christ Jesus
[1:14:08] from the dead dwell in you it'll also
[1:14:10] quicken your mortal body whether it be
[1:14:12] in the ground or walk around the earth
[1:14:14] it will quicken you so if you've got the
[1:14:17] word in you you've got God's life in you
[1:14:19] and he says you have God in you and
[1:14:21] whatever God's Word speaks forth out of
[1:14:24] you it'll have to come to pass just like
[1:14:29] it was spoke from God Jesus said
[1:14:34] whatsoever you ask the Father in my name
[1:14:37] that will I do program ask the question
[1:14:41] do you ever realize what that means do
[1:14:45] you realize if we go before God in the
[1:14:52] name of Jesus it's just the same as
[1:14:56] Jesus himself praying now we are second
[1:15:01] ago most of us raised our hands when we
[1:15:03] talked when we asked about brother
[1:15:04] Branham when we asked about Jesus now
[1:15:07] what about you but it's got to sink from
[1:15:12] here to here it's got to sink from here
[1:15:14] to here for me it's got to think from
[1:15:16] here to here to you before it can change
[1:15:19] our lives but if it does it will change
[1:15:24] you forever it will change your
[1:15:26] circumstance forever
[1:15:27] it will change the circumstance of your
[1:15:29] family forever you'll never be the same
[1:15:31] because
[1:15:32] when you pray with the Holy Ghost it's
[1:15:34] not you praying anymore
[1:15:36] it's him praying out of you that is
[1:15:41] powerful he says it isn't me praying
[1:15:46] anymore if I come in his name and he
[1:15:48] recognizes his name and Jesus said
[1:15:51] whatever you ask the Father in my name
[1:15:53] that I do and then I go to the father in
[1:15:56] Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore
[1:15:58] it's Jesus it's his spirit praying
[1:16:01] through me and people can't understand
[1:16:05] how whenever you try to explain to him
[1:16:06] about the Godhead how Jesus could pray
[1:16:08] to himself well how does the Holy Ghost
[1:16:10] filled believer pray to God when he's
[1:16:11] got God on the inside the Holy Ghost in
[1:16:17] you is God himself
[1:16:19] and that's the part see Satan can get in
[1:16:22] your flesh Satan can get in your spirit
[1:16:26] and make you Moody and make you just not
[1:16:27] so pleasant to be around
[1:16:28] but Satan can't touch your soul and that
[1:16:31] makes him so mad and that makes me so
[1:16:33] glad because remember let me just say
[1:16:37] this remember the first pull when
[1:16:40] brother branham's ministry he contacted
[1:16:41] the flesh he took the hand of the people
[1:16:43] and then bombs would appear in his hand
[1:16:47] and was able to discern the second poll
[1:16:51] contacted people's spirit like the woman
[1:16:54] at the well he said if I can only catch
[1:16:56] your spirit he talked to people but do
[1:16:59] you know that people were to get healed
[1:17:00] by that sign of the hand and he did get
[1:17:03] healed by people by him discerning but
[1:17:06] the third pull is only for the soul and
[1:17:10] Satan can't touch that he can't touch
[1:17:14] that once once that third pull catches
[1:17:16] the fish because remember the fishing
[1:17:18] and the little fish go away but once you
[1:17:21] get hooked and you've got that word
[1:17:25] living in you Satan can't touch your
[1:17:27] soul the third pole is only for the
[1:17:30] bride the first and second Pole is just
[1:17:32] to bring healing to catch the bride's
[1:17:33] attention was to catch the fish's
[1:17:35] attention that's the difference he said
[1:17:43] now if he
[1:17:45] we as Christians we become too clogged
[1:17:47] up we just can't understand well we
[1:17:50] think the doctor said I can't get well
[1:17:51] as long as you think that then you're
[1:17:53] not thinking God's thoughts you can't do
[1:17:57] it if you say well I'm going to die the
[1:17:59] doctor said I was going to die all
[1:18:01] regards to the doctor that's the best of
[1:18:03] his knowledge and he said and if he said
[1:18:07] you're gonna die humanly speaking I
[1:18:08] believe the same thing but by the word I
[1:18:10] can't believe it
[1:18:12] so where's your vision that's right
[1:18:17] because he promised me that whatever I
[1:18:20] asked the Father in his name would be
[1:18:22] granted now if God could just clear that
[1:18:25] little channel out and run that energy
[1:18:27] out to that place then something is
[1:18:29] going to happen we need real faith we
[1:18:37] need God's faith and we need it as
[1:18:40] brother Tim was mentioning last Sunday
[1:18:41] about atmosphere have such an atmosphere
[1:18:43] that anything could happen do you know
[1:18:48] that's something I remember when we
[1:18:49] first came and visited sister Gabriella
[1:18:51] and I back in 2017 we came and visited
[1:18:54] there was such an atmosphere that
[1:18:56] literally anything could happen that's
[1:18:59] the way we have to believe God for every
[1:19:01] service that it's not as this often said
[1:19:04] that it's not just another service
[1:19:05] literally anything can happen in any
[1:19:08] service even right now that quote that I
[1:19:12] read to you can become real to you and
[1:19:14] you pray and you say God I want this
[1:19:16] that or the other and it be from your
[1:19:18] heart and you walk out a different
[1:19:20] person
[1:19:20] you walk out completely healed because
[1:19:23] it's not you it's your faith in the
[1:19:26] heart from the heart but it's not a head
[1:19:31] faith that's what's giving us a lot of
[1:19:34] problems as people get intellectual
[1:19:35] conceptions of this message and they
[1:19:37] don't meet him they don't meet the
[1:19:39] author they don't meet the father of
[1:19:40] this album they don't see it it's not
[1:19:44] learning upon learning all right oh
[1:19:46] forget everything he knew to learn
[1:19:48] Christ
[1:19:52] romans 8:11 but if the spirit of him
[1:19:54] went my favorite verses that raised up
[1:19:56] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:20:00] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:20:01] quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit
[1:20:03] that dwelleth in you mama that's me
[1:20:07] that's your there's so many pictures
[1:20:09] time we'll just not this could this you
[1:20:12] could go after example after example and
[1:20:14] every single service these brothers show
[1:20:15] you your picture but do you recognize it
[1:20:19] do you know a lot of times it's hard for
[1:20:22] a person to human element to discern God
[1:20:24] from man it's always been that way that
[1:20:26] is the problem with humanity that is why
[1:20:29] they wouldn't believe the prophets
[1:20:31] that's why they didn't wouldn't believe
[1:20:32] Jesus because they can't discern the man
[1:20:34] from God and it's important we as
[1:20:37] believers do that with one another that
[1:20:40] you can discern when God is speaking
[1:20:42] because that's why people can't receive
[1:20:44] something and you have that especially
[1:20:47] among among churches where there's a lot
[1:20:49] of a lot of family and things and and
[1:20:50] maybe they may come against the pastor
[1:20:52] and I don't know I have no idea why I'm
[1:20:54] even here is but I'm just saying it
[1:20:55] because they cannot discern that that's
[1:20:58] not this brother
[1:21:00] I might had coffee with him an hour ago
[1:21:02] and we had some good laughs and we
[1:21:04] talked about natural things but now it's
[1:21:06] God speaking to me
[1:21:07] so receive it because if you still see
[1:21:10] these brothers here for who they are on
[1:21:13] the natural you're not going to get
[1:21:14] nothing from God because that's just
[1:21:16] brother Matthew preaching again that's
[1:21:18] just brother Andrew brother on but when
[1:21:20] you realize that it's God speaking
[1:21:21] directly to you and they have no idea
[1:21:23] why they're saying it what they're
[1:21:24] saying you grab it because that's God
[1:21:27] that's God and you grabbing it and
[1:21:28] that's God in them speaking it and what
[1:21:31] what did brother RAM say that went to
[1:21:33] with to omnipotence meet the miraculous
[1:21:36] takes place so the omnipotent in you is
[1:21:39] supposed to discern the omnipotence of
[1:21:41] the word coming forth and together the
[1:21:44] miraculous happens that's how it works
[1:21:46] it's not a flesh and blood affair glory
[1:21:50] to God is not a flesh and blood affair
[1:21:53] it's God in you the hope of glory going
[1:21:57] from glory to glory you see you realize
[1:21:59] that you're not the son or daughter of
[1:22:02] your pair
[1:22:03] it's God allowed you to be expressed in
[1:22:06] this earth by your natural parents for
[1:22:08] different reasons
[1:22:09] and there's things you can't explain
[1:22:11] about your life and and maybe you wish
[1:22:12] things were different and all this and
[1:22:14] that but you know this this is your
[1:22:17] father he is your father when Paul said
[1:22:23] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[1:22:24] all sleep we shall be changed you read
[1:22:29] that you say mama
[1:22:30] that's me you see her so that that's my
[1:22:33] picture I'm gonna be changed I'm gonna
[1:22:36] be changed I don't know about the fellow
[1:22:38] next to me I don't know about the gal
[1:22:40] next to me but I'm gonna be changed
[1:22:42] because I see my picture in here you
[1:22:46] know when John seen his name when John
[1:22:48] seen John the Revelator seen his name he
[1:22:51] got so excited all of heaven and earth
[1:22:53] and everything under it and over it and
[1:22:55] every which way heard him saying
[1:22:57] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:22:59] be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[1:23:01] and unto the lamb for ever and ever
[1:23:05] john seen his name of the book and he
[1:23:08] realized he was and i'm closing and he
[1:23:10] realized that he was in God's plan of
[1:23:12] redemption when you find your place in
[1:23:16] the book just as Jesus did Jesus came he
[1:23:20] was born of a virgin and he was God from
[1:23:22] his first breath to his last he was God
[1:23:25] but do you know brother branham said as
[1:23:28] I read to you the quote that as a man
[1:23:30] he's still needed the word quicken to
[1:23:32] him not by another man but by God if you
[1:23:37] got something out of this service it's
[1:23:38] not because of me is because of him
[1:23:40] if you get anything out of these
[1:23:42] brothers preaching it's not because of
[1:23:43] them it's because of him you see the
[1:23:45] different separate the natural we're not
[1:23:48] we're not this isn't a natural gathering
[1:23:50] this isn't this isn't this is between
[1:23:53] life and death this is eternal life
[1:23:56] we're doing business with God that's
[1:23:58] that's why we've gathered here so
[1:24:01] whenever you see your picture in the
[1:24:03] book then you know you're in God's plan
[1:24:06] of redemption you know that God placed
[1:24:10] your picture in this word before the
[1:24:13] foundation of the world you say it
[1:24:14] wasn't written yet it was already
[1:24:16] finished in the mount of
[1:24:18] Jesus was slain was the lamb slain
[1:24:20] before the foundation of the world he
[1:24:23] was he was our it was already finished
[1:24:25] so far there's no greater there's no
[1:24:29] greater joy there's no greater privilege
[1:24:30] than no one that you are God's child
[1:24:33] there's no greater privilege they're
[1:24:36] being able to look into the Bible and
[1:24:37] find in your picture think about this
[1:24:42] it's your picture it's some of them are
[1:24:47] group pictures and you can find yourself
[1:24:49] in that group picture I'm not gonna know
[1:24:53] the bride and the spirit said come you
[1:24:56] find yourself it's sent to our feet you
[1:25:00] find yourself in God's Word in
[1:25:03] revelations 10 and 11 and he said unto
[1:25:07] me after eating the book thou must
[1:25:09] prophesy again before many people before
[1:25:12] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:25:14] kings mama that's me you say how do i
[1:25:22] how do i prophesy speak the word speak
[1:25:28] the word and your prophesy that's God's
[1:25:33] word one last quote in brother Hammond
[1:25:36] walk cross speak he said oh how this
[1:25:39] Tabernacle this morning how we people of
[1:25:42] this our brother Nevel as we see the
[1:25:44] gray hair striking the great striking
[1:25:47] are here in our shoulders stooping when
[1:25:50] we see the world weaving and rocking as
[1:25:51] it is and how we can look around and see
[1:25:54] the promise is drawing nigh I think many
[1:25:57] times if someone could just bounce into
[1:25:59] it all at once would understand it
[1:26:01] rather and come into it at once it
[1:26:03] almost sends you into eternity it's such
[1:26:06] a rapturing thing and never note it and
[1:26:10] just Oh break through the things that we
[1:26:11] have seen and know and understand and
[1:26:13] all bounce up all bounce in at one time
[1:26:16] the man or the woman the boy the girl
[1:26:17] would probably just lift up their hands
[1:26:19] and say let's go Lord Jesus you see oh
[1:26:22] how the hour is so close and I wonder I
[1:26:26] want to even admonish young middle aged
[1:26:30] you know you're never too young young
[1:26:34] people for revelation you're never too
[1:26:37] young for God to deal with you you never
[1:26:40] get too old for God to deal with you and
[1:26:42] give you revelation and show you
[1:26:43] pictures we're always seeing when every
[1:26:45] time you read the word like brother I'm
[1:26:46] said it's a vision and we open up this
[1:26:48] word and we say mama that's me and as I
[1:26:53] said Jesus was able to just off a
[1:26:55] prophet off a story of Jonah was able to
[1:26:58] stake his entire will be able to stand
[1:27:01] up and make a statement like that that
[1:27:03] you destroy this temple and in three
[1:27:04] days I'll raise it up and as I said if
[1:27:08] you can't find your place if you can't
[1:27:10] find your picture in this word ask God
[1:27:14] to deliver you from spiritual amnesia
[1:27:18] because if you're a predestinated child
[1:27:21] of God you're in there if you're a
[1:27:24] predestinate child of God you are in
[1:27:26] there but you've just forgotten you
[1:27:30] can't see it because Satan has blinded
[1:27:31] your eyes let's bow our heads dear
[1:27:36] gracious Heavenly Father how we thank
[1:27:39] you Lord Jesus for this opportunity Lord
[1:27:41] and these moments we have in your
[1:27:42] presence father and to realize father
[1:27:45] that Lord your word is not just the
[1:27:47] words of a man but more we can hang our
[1:27:49] soul upon every word father the Lord how
[1:27:52] thankful we are to you Lord that we can
[1:27:54] look and look at there's so many
[1:27:56] examples that you've given us that those
[1:27:58] that have gone on before that had
[1:28:00] testimonies that they please you we look
[1:28:02] at Enoch and how he just went for a
[1:28:04] stroll one day it was just another walk
[1:28:06] it was just it just seemed like another
[1:28:08] day but Lord that day was so special
[1:28:11] that she translated him
[1:28:13] you took them and father we we have our
[1:28:16] daily routines we have our natural
[1:28:18] tendencies we have our natural ways the
[1:28:22] father one of these mornings father
[1:28:24] we're gonna wake up and have our
[1:28:26] devotions just like any other morning
[1:28:28] we're gonna get up maybe eat breakfast
[1:28:30] like any other morning but Lord one of
[1:28:31] these days you're gonna take this one of
[1:28:35] these days we're gonna hear knocks on
[1:28:37] the door we're gonna open and they're
[1:28:39] gonna be the resurrected Saints father
[1:28:41] Lord mama or daddy that's us we believe
[1:28:47] your word father and we just pray O God
[1:28:50] that made may that quote follow the Lord
[1:28:52] that it's not just a quote of a man it
[1:28:55] was the words of a vindicated prophet to
[1:28:57] understand it to realize that when we
[1:28:59] pray under the anointing and under in
[1:29:02] the channel of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:03] you literally say Amen to our prayer
[1:29:06] help us Lord to get to just put aside
[1:29:09] carnality help us Lord to just be in
[1:29:12] such a channel of the spirit father help
[1:29:14] us nor this world draws our attention
[1:29:17] there's so many voices that are Poland
[1:29:20] there's so many things that are vying
[1:29:22] for our attention but father may we give
[1:29:24] you our undivided attention we're living
[1:29:26] in such a late hour Lord we're living in
[1:29:29] such a late hour when the rapture can
[1:29:31] come at any time and your word said he
[1:29:33] that filthy will be filthy still and he
[1:29:35] that's holy will be holy still
[1:29:37] and Lord in a service like this someone
[1:29:42] that's filthy can become holy someone
[1:29:46] that's unclean like a leper can cry
[1:29:49] unclean unclean and as same Lord Jesus
[1:29:53] is here tonight to cleanse of leprosy to
[1:29:57] cleanse of sin to refill of the Spirit
[1:30:02] to give more revelation and
[1:30:04] understanding father that's why you gave
[1:30:06] this word I pray O God that you deal
[1:30:10] with our hearts help us lay aside
[1:30:12] selfishness help us to lay aside the
[1:30:15] things of the world help us O God to lay
[1:30:17] aside carnality help us to lay aside
[1:30:20] self and Lord Jesus may you have the
[1:30:23] preeminence within us may you have the
[1:30:27] preeminence in our lives may you have
[1:30:29] the preeminence in our families may you
[1:30:33] have the preeminence in our decisions
[1:30:35] we're faced with so many decisions every
[1:30:38] day but have we consulted Josh have we
[1:30:41] asked you what should we do with this
[1:30:44] Knorr your ear is always open to us
[1:30:47] you're like such a loving father who
[1:30:51] gathers his family in the house like you

[1:31:15] only comfort we have fun
[1:31:17] I pray may we give it the preeminence
[1:31:20] that it deserves your prophet asks in

[1:31:29] word in our midst use you give us so
[1:31:34] many gifts he performed so many signs
[1:31:36] and wonders you've indicated your word
[1:31:38] constantly over and over and over again

[1:31:43] to your word your this generation is so
[1:31:46] known to the vindication of your word
[1:31:48] but father we love it

[1:37:46] didn't seek God just kind of take us
[1:37:50] through the DNA a bit what did you see
[1:37:55] brother on my mind's eye it goes back to
[1:38:00] Switzerland when I held one of the first
[1:38:03] Romanian books that was translated it
[1:38:09] was a book that it's just real rough
[1:38:13] paper put together a real real simple
[1:38:19] stitching
[1:38:23] they can see somebody risked her life
[1:38:27] somebody heard a message and they said
[1:38:30] people in our language needs to get it -
[1:38:37] that book had been in a rabbit cage they
[1:38:42] held it and they were translated to put
[1:38:44] it in under and put it into there and
[1:38:50] hot it because if they got arrested it
[1:38:54] was life in prison
[1:38:57] this message was worth it
[1:39:01] this message was worth it what you saw
[1:39:07] tonight you heard a man say that his
[1:39:09] father left Romania incredible pressure
[1:39:12] I went to Italy to come to this nation I
[1:39:18] know we get all upset about immigration
[1:39:21] and all of that but we were immigrants
[1:39:24] we were elements
[1:39:26] and the immigration is not done yet
[1:39:29] because we're going home
