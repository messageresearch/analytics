that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose amen all things all things for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be firstborn among many Brethren moreover who he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glor GL ified what shall we then say of these things if God be for us who can be against us let's just read that one more time what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who could be against us amen you can be seated this time just leave that open to that note as we continue on and 32 and it said and he spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we not with him also freely give all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ now this is where I want to kind of build on tonight shall tribulation distress persecution or famine nakedness Prevail Peril or sword it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted sheep for the slaughter nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded no I like this says I am persuaded this is where you got to get to that I am persuaded the neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen don't you just love that this evening for all things work together every single one of them so this evening I would like to speak on a subject it says oh I have heard your cries and I just want to kind of tell you a little bit of where I draw this thought um the other week I was going down the road and just Li listening to Lamentations and as I would listen to that and about the destruction of Jerusalem and how Jeremiah would write about her I thought of my own self of the year that we've had pasted and some of the things that I've had happen in my life my family and there's been a lot of tribulation a lot of things that's went on that's felt like it's broken us it hurts but an audible Voice come into the vehicle come on and forgive me if I get a little emotional but it said oh I have heard your cries let me tell you what that's right when that presence came to me when that spoke to me no it didn't say I'm going to take care of every single thing but he said oh I have heard your cries and forgive me I feel a little bit like the Prophet Jeremiah a little bit of a weeping prophet this evening because it means a lot to me that he heard me he heard my cries in the middle of the night he heard me in my Despair and things so to lay a foundation on many things of Lamentations uh the author of lamentation is Jeremiah and as uh scoffield would say Lamentations is composed of five elegies lamenta the destruction of Jerusalem the undoubtedly work of Jeremiah in the literary of the chapters 1- 4 are alphabetic somewhat in the order of Psalms 119 thus in chapters 1 and two a new letter in the Hebrew alphabet begins each of the 22 verses in chapter 3 there are 66 verses arranged in 22 groups of three verses each group three verses use the successive letter of the alphabet each verse is in group beginning with that one letter and the fifth chapter although not alphabetically contains 22 verses in a plth meter which is second half of each verse beginning shorter than the first it conveys a somber effect of a DE a domino help me out dominu window effect which in a musical form a diminuendo effect is a gradual decrease from loudness and so as we look in Lamentations here it is as a poem as a song of Lamentations five chapters 22 verses of chapters one two chap CH 3 Jeremiah begins and it almost as he gets carried away in each of what he is saying in chapter 3 and WR 66 vers chapter 4 he then comes back to 22 verses again as same as chapter 5 and as it is said in the dominu window is as it gradually goes from louder to softer and I just think how how beautiful it is that Jeremiah would write this Lamentations of death destruction of Jerusalem of what God had had because Babylon had taken over but it's because and we'll see in chapter two God got angry God is slow to anger but when he gets angry he gets angry and so it continues as though Jerusalem Lady of Zion Oh Daughter of Zion Lady of Jerusalem and as Jeremiah would write these things about Jerusalem in all of the destruction in all of it and he would say and he would write as it is as Jerusalem is speaking out it says oh oh Lord in verse 20 of chapter two of chapter 1 it says oh lord for I am in distress my bows are in my bows are troubled Mine Heart is turned within me for I have grievously rebelled see she had rebelled from what God had told her they had put other gods before thee and God had turned and so death and destruction is what he has written here in chapter two as he's writing about the Lord's anger and I'm just going to paraphrase some of these just to kind of save some time in verse 7 the Lord hath cast off his alar altar he hath aborn her her s Sanctuary he hath given up the hand of the enemies the walls of her places the Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the dister daughter of Zion her gates are sunken unto the ground he hath destroyed and broken her bar many times in our lives we feel some of these pains though and it's almost as even like as job had said though God slay me yet I will trust him and in all of this Brokenness in all of the the suffering that Jerusalem is going through that God has put upon her in in verse three chapter 3 excuse me Jeremiah he continues with Jerusalem in her despair but in the center of it now I love this he says this I recall to mind therefore have I hope it is the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions they fail not sir oh come on now his compassions they fail not about this time in my heart and I'm reading this and I'm hearing that voice oh I have heard thy cries oh I have felt Broken Oh I have felt lost oh I have felt forgotten but oh I have heard your cries and I can say now like Jeremiah was writing it it is the Lord's Mercy that we are not compassed because his compassions they fail not they are new every morning morning great is thy faithfulness Hall oh how beautiful this is in the center of the destruction Jeremiah writes in these poems in the center of Despair the song Jeremiah gives hope he knows all is not Fallen the Lord is my portion saith my soul yeah therefore I will hope in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him aren't you glad that in the middle of your despair that you can look back and you say Jeremiah could write it in the middle of destruction oh great is thy faithfulness oh Lord great is thy faithfulness morning by morning new mercies I see Great Is Thy Faithfulness in Psalms 18 and6 and it says in my distress I could hold upon the Lord I cried upon I Cried unto God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even unto his ears see David found himself in the midst of the deepest distress and danger and called upon God David right and he had found him as a help in chapter 34 of Psalms it says my eyes of the Lord the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to every to their cry aren't you glad of that that his ear ear are open that's right many times when we call upon the Lord I just can think that he turns over and he says oh did you hear what they asked for did you hear what he said in the middle of it all they're still calling upon me in the middle of their despair oh I hear them I have heard your cries and I want to come to you tonight and tell you not just for me but it's saying unto you I have I have heard your cries I have heard every single one of your cries in the middle of the nights for your babies for your lost loved ones for your sicknesses when things look so despair look to this and say he has heard my cries oh he has turned his ear and said oh did you hear what they said did you hear what they asked for see he's not scared of what you ask for he wants you to ask him so ask him ask him for big things don't be scared to ask him ask him in Psalms 139 and4 it says therefore is not the word in my tongue but y oh Lord thou knowest all together thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid up on my hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it whether shall I go from thy Spirit whether shall I flee from thy presence see you can't flee from it if I sin unto Heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even even there shall thy hand lead me no matter where you go he's there no matter what you do he's there just turn to him he's there for you if you make you bit in Hell he's there you can lift up your eyes and call upon him in in the matter of the darkest of the depths you can call upon the Lord and he hears you brother Brandon would say it remembering the Lord and he said you know oh brother Bosworth used to have the sense of humor and said the baby that cries the loudest gets the most attention so that's kind of the whole lot you know so I think it pays us to cry a little bit once in a while don't you think so see even in the middle of Lamentations even in the middle of the crying God heard Jeremiah even in the middle of at all it pays to cry a little bit it's okay to cry a little bit sometimes you you would think oh well you got to be strong you got to be oh I don't want to show any emotion I I'm a man I had a little bit of a a tear session myself last night I'm a man I try to hold everything in that I can We're Men We hold it amen it's very tough but I have to say there is times and last night was one of them I had to have myself a good cry not only for what I've been through but also for what he's given me that's right he's done more for me than I've ever done for [Applause] him I can't give him praise enough [Applause] right I can't give him praise enough oh he's been so good to me oh he's so good so I Cried unto the Lord and he heard me he helped me though God slay me yet I'll trust him and job would say it like this he said but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold thank you Lord let me tell you it hurts come on it hurts but you're the winners every single one of you are the winners because at the end of it we shall come forth as gold you know this is the part of the sermon where I I say my testimony I can't explain it I would love to be able to give it to brother Gabriel but there's some parts of my testimony that it can't be told but when I get to thinking about what my god did for me when I get to thinking about where he pulled me from my testimony I can shout about it I can praise about it I can look at Brother Devon sister Dylan many others I can praise with them but when I get to thinking about my testimony about what my god did for me excuse me I get a little excited I get a little emotional about my testimony and maybe you should too get a little excited see I don't know where a lot of you come from but I know where a lot of you is going because we can get excited about our testimony not that we want a test and a trial but we can get excited about at the end of it oh my God is with me he's never forsaken me he has never failed me oh he's new Every Morning aren't you glad of that brother Brandon would preach about it about getting pressurized in the countdown if you could pull that up for me I believe I sent that to you sister Julia getting pressurized and so one of these mornings God's achievements of his astronauts is climbing into Jesus Christ been born there by the Holy Ghost filled with his power one of these mornings the whole universe will be screaming and Welling nashing of teeth when they see they've missed it when the Great Angel Power by the Holy Ghost Fire begins to spread her wings the astronauts will take off into the sky and that's us to go to meet her bridegroom when the bride takes off in that astronaut power of God Almighty who sent Jesus Christ to the Earth in the form the Holy Ghost has brought the church through these achievements until now she is getting resurrected power in her to fly

we'll just go right to the word this evening just certainly want to wish you all a Happy New Year amen let's turn to if you would to Mark chapter 5 it's a bit of a lengthy read but we'll try and go a little quick here so you could take your seats Mark 5 will'll begin with the first verse amen do you love the Lord tonight amen amen my timer brother brother Andrew was giving me the fits there trying to get it situated so I'm going to try and watch the time but if I go too long you you you come get me out of here okay uh let's begin reading and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gatherin and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unlean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him know not with chains because that he had often because he had been often bound with feathers and chains and the chains had been plucked as by him and the FEDS broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones but when he saw Jesus AAR off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with it Jesus thou son of the most high God iure theee by God that thou torment me not and he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is Legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send him away out of the country now there was nigh into the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the Devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and forth with Jesus gave them leave and the CLE Spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep Place into the sea they were about 2000 and were choked in the sea and they that fed and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done and I love this part and they came to Jesus and see him that was possessed with a devil and had the legion sitting en clothed in his right mind and they were afraid and they that saw it told them how it befell of him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine and they begin to pray him to depart out of their coast and when he was com to the ship he that was possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with them how be it Jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them that how great things the Lord hath done for them the and hath had compassion on thee and he departed and be to publish and to capis how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did Marvel amen God bless you as you're seated with the help of the Lord i' like to just title this over the next few minutes the Apostle of gatera brother brandham said brother BR preached a sermon called the maniac of gadera now we're taught that Apostle me means one that is sent now Paul and James both Justified Abraham but Paul Justified Abraham by what God seen and James Justified him by what man seen by his works so here I'd like to take a look at the life of Legion that when man looked at Legion they seen a maniac but when God looked at Legion he seen the potential of an apostle when man sees a Shepherd boy God sees a king when man saw a murdering Pharisee God seen the the the the messenger of the first church age when man sees you and your Humanity God sees a Perfect Bride so to get the background of the story Jesus is tired from all the meetings they're pulling on him you've got the pull brother Matthew could you get me a bottle of water please thank you you have the pool of the people where the people wanted Want Jesus to do one thing but Jesus said he only does that which the father shows him so it was a constant struggle in his humanity and it drained his energy to have to make sure that he always does what God wanted him to do and he was Healing The Sick he was thank you he was casting out Devils he began to preach great deep Revelations about the kingdom of heaven and he'd say a swer went out to seow and all this really be to wear on his body but after a while Jesus must have looked up and said let us now pass to the other side let us now go to the other side because there was one man on the other side that was crying out and his cries had awoken the master Jesus was having a Revival there and he was getting tired and he went and he said let's go to the other side and they got in a boat and they were headed to the other side and Satan knew something was going on and he he brought about a storm he got he's the prince of the power of the air and he got into the storm and he tried to sink that boat we just sung about it and the boat was filling up and Jesus was so tired and so worn out he was asleep in the boat but brother Randall the cries of the disciples went and said care not that we perish right in one spot brother R said Jesus wasn't really sleeping he he was tired but maybe at that moment he was laying awake waiting for them to come and get him waiting for them to realize that they needed more than their than their Boatman expertise to handle the situation and he put that foot on the bril and he said peace be still because an elected seed of God was crying out to him brother Braham said one day way down in the land of gadia No Doubt associable God-fearing citizen once lived and he got out with the wrong crowd maybe just married and had to two or three little kides and he got mixed up in the wrong group and that's where many a young man and a young woman loses out getting mixed up in the wrong group young people watch your friends watch your friends because Legion was maybe raised in a Christian home but he didn't watch his friends and they begin to take him down a wrong path and it started with one devil and ended up as a legion to took him away from his family took him away from his friends but Jesus had need to go by Galeria he had need to go by gadera just as he just as he had needs to go by Samaria it was the same cry he said so one night they taken him out and give him a little drink go play a little game do this or gamble it won't hurt the first devil entered him on he went home and had to tell his wife a lie the second devil entered into him on and on till he was possessed with a legion and he got Beyond any help and the poor fellow was drove out into the tombs but the cry had awoken the master Jesus will leave an entire crowd just for you do you know that Jesus Will orchestrate an entire church service just for you if he has to do you know that he would send his Prophet into a city for one person amen do you know that in the book of Acts Philip was having a wonderful Mighty Revival brother said the demons were screaming out people were being healed and God took him from that Revival and brought him down to one black Ethiopian unic there by his Chariot God left thousands of people having a wonderful time for one person he sure did because look whenever because this Ethiopian needed some some light on the scripture he was reading the book OFA Isaiah and didn't know if he was talking about Isaiah or who who was Isaiah talking about he as he asked Philip that and Philip opened up the scriptures to him and then that man became an apostle of Ethiopia he was able to go back because he was a man of great rank he was of great Authority the scripture says under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians who had charge of all of her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for worship God left God had Philip leave that entire meeting for one but in the darkness of gadera he had an elected Son of God crying out from under the Legion of demons that was covering him right you think about this he said seeing this brother speaking he says seeing this poor old fellow Legion out there maybe once in a while he'd come to himself he'd just look and say what am I doing here think about that amen here you have a man that has backslid on God right and every now and then he'd get just enough of a breath of fresh air to say what am I doing here look these chains all around them and things like that my body all cut up then the devil would throw him in a spell and here he would go maybe he'd come to himself again and think I've got a wife and children and let let me just preach here for a little bit I don't care how backslid you are I don't care how cold you've got on God I don't care if you got a beer bottle in your hand right now when you come to yourself cry out when you have that moment of sanity and you have that moment of recollection and say my God how far have I have I backslid I never would have guessed I'd be in this sin cry out to them cry out to him because your cries will awaken the master if you still have a if you still have a call of God on your on your life and you still have a thirst for God he's not done with you yet no matter how bad you back live when you have that sober moment and I just don't mean when it comes to alcohol but when you have that sober moment when you come to yourself and you say what am I doing at that moment you cry out Hallelujah you cry out and then you get to God you cry out and then you go to your church you ask for help but you got to cry out don't let the condemnation of the enemy and your guilt keep you chained down cry out to him regardless of your condition now when Jesus came Legion cried out and Jesus came but then even when Jesus came to the shore brother R said that Legion he said them Devils would have never come if Legion hadn't pushed his way out there to meet him he got Jesus to the shore but Legion then had to make his way to the master and I have this here in my notes brother Andrew Georgie Carter he heard her cry and he sent a prophet from out Miles and Miles Away didn't even know where was on a map amen but he knew one of God's Lambs were in trouble Jesus heading to Jerusalem with his mind was fixed on Calvary and blind Bemus blind heard all the screaming and all the commotion and he asked who is that and finally a kind woman said that that's that's the Messiah and blind bmus sees his moment out of his Darkness he cried thou son of David have mercy on me and the Bible specifically says that Jesus Stood Still right he was going this way his mind was toward Calvary he knew what the father wanted him to do but over all the screams over all the mockings over all the criticism one little man sitting down even right C Li out to him and Jesus stopped in his tracks now Legion is delivered but his community is not happy for him his neighbors aren't pleased because they lost an investment of hogs that's sad you have a man that's out of his mind that's naked and and wants to kill you if he can get his hands on you and all he's delivered and you're worried about your Hogs right come but that's the way it was and they wanted Jesus to leave we don't want you here so Legion runs up and he says Master let me follow you now in our way of thinking we' have thought he would have been a good trade for Judas is a care it wouldn't we he would have been a good tradeoff but Judas had a job too and God had a job for Legion so he told him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord did done for thee and have compassion on thee and he departed and begin to publish and DEC capulus how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did Marvel I'm sure his testimony rang out a lot like the woman at the well whenever he had needs to go by Samaria and he began to discern her life and she runs and says come see a man that's told me everything I've ever done and when he went through all throughout all Decap he said come see a man let me tell you about a man come on because see legion's testimony had way more weight in decapolis than it would have anywhere else because they knew who he once was now Decap was a region it wasn't just a city it was a region of about 10 cities like we would say the shannona valley and then you've got cities within that you've got Harrisonburg and and Waynesboro and and the big city of Gros and all them places you've got little places within that area and he went throughout let's just say throughout the entire shanida Valley up and down now legion's testimony begin with his family and that's where your testimony becomes come on when you become a different husband when you become a different Dad when you become a different man when you become a different mom and a wife that is where your testimony begins because it's your family are the ones that really know you and when they see a change they know it's real when your spouse comes home a different person you're going to be the first one to know it brother Ram dramatizes a little bit and I'm trying to hurry he says could you imagine Legion coming back down to his own home and finding where he used to live the little wife had to sell the place and he wondered where she was at so he searched from place to place finally somebody said she lives down in the alley and when he goes down there in a little tin Shack When the Children see him coming they run to hide from their own dad the wife grabbed her up her little Shaw and put on her and started out the gate and he said never mind mind honey never mind children come here to Daddy I want to take you on my arms I want to put my arms around you sweetheart your little dresses tore off oh she said what happened he said Jesus came along that's what made the difference oh wife babies come here it was the darkest time the Devils were tormenting me then Jesus came along one time brother Brandon went and he had a little breakfast there with a bunch of preachers and Billy Graham was the head speaker and Billy Graham took his Bible like this and he said this is God's blueprint and he said I go into a city and he said I have 30,000 converts I come back to this city in a year and I can't find 30 he said Paul would have one convert in the city and he'd go back the next year and he'd have 30 or so forth from that one and he said what's the matter and Billy Graham blamed the ministers for not following up the leads and the prophet just sat there and there was a prophet of the age and he kept humble he wanted to say something so bad but that was Billy Graham's breakfast he was a gentleman but to his own audience and to the bride he said he he respected brother Billy Graham for his stand on the word but he said oh how I wish I could have asked him who what what ministers went and chased down the Converse that Paul had he said what was it he said Paul took them further into the word where they themselves became sent and then they went and told others and then they went and told others because it was a reality of life and it wasn't just come shake my hand you're born again you're born again you're born again it was a reality without reality what do we have religion Glory with reality you have everything you have everything praise the Lord Jesus Legion had reality come on he had reality in his life he was able to go tell others you talk about a a house firing a windy day you couldn't put Legion out neither can you put this bride out neither can you put the ministry out the true five-fold Ministry you can't put her out it was him now we took our text in Mark chapter 5 and after Legion was delivered and crowds wanted him to leave because the power the kind of power and authority that Jesus had was too strong for them so Jesus heard the Cry of one man buried underneath 2,000 Devils he gave him a true conversion an elected seed of God and left and he told that man you can't follow me that's not your place to be one of the 12 dis deciples he said but you go publish it right you go be an apostle right less than a year later in the very next chapter or two chapters over Jesus returns to the area and 4,000 people come to meet him four thou he ends up feeding 4,000 people in that area let's read it Mark 7 verse 31 and again departing from the coast of Tyree and sidon he came unto the Sea of Galilee through the midst of the coast of decapus and they bring him unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand on him and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers in his ears and he spit and touched his tongue and looking up to heaven he sighed and said unto them ephr and that is be open and straight way his ears were open and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain and he charged them that he should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it Hallelujah God knows how people are this a secret don't you tell nobody but God uses it this time for his glory and in Mark chapter 8 you can just jot it down but in Mark chapter 8 is where he feeds the 4,000 with seven Loaves and Fishes we don't know what 2025 will hold but there's a couple things you can be confident in one is it'll get darker for the world new president coming in office New political change doesn't matter it'll get worse for the world but for the bride it's a totally different story it's going to get better for you there's going to be more light on the word you're going to get more faith you're going to be healed you're going to be delivered and one of these mornings you're going to be [Applause] gone may this be the year for the coming of the Lord may we be Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ if Legion in less than a year could tear up the country like he did what about us what about the life that we live and how that preaches to people now in closing let me say this sometimes storms CL come and they'll change your plans do you know that whenever Jesus told them he said you go on ahead you go to Betha y'all go on ahead and I'll meet you there and they were going there remember they didn't have Jesus in the boat he went in the mountain to pray and Satan gets in that storm again and Jesus begins walking on the water and he comes in the boat and he calms the storm again again do you realize in the scripture they actually never went to Betha the storm blew them somewhere else the storm blew them to jerus if I'm pronouncing that right but God didm him Miracles there too and this story brother Ron reminds me of even you you were doing what God told you to do he called you to preach his message but a storm came up one you didn't ask for but yet God used the storm to use you like never before and people in that City that they ended up the storm ended up blowing them in were healed delivered and God still had the glory god still made it over there to Beta but you see how the storm blew him my course Jesus wasn't concerned when they got to the shores of jeser say boys y'all's navigation is terrible come on the Bible says that the people knew him and they ran to him God has some business to do let's stand to our feet amen thank you Lord I'm also reminded in closing of a quote that brother Bram said about he said many of you are here and I'm paraphrasing but he said many of you are here because of a decision you made five years ago and he talks about the power of a decision today and where you'll be five years from now brother Ron you read that quote I've never forgotten it because it's a powerful quote think of how many of us are here because of a decision you've made within 5 years maybe longer so the the importance of a decision is very very important it's a decision is powerful and if you're on the fence with God as as the expression goes if you if you do feel like you're getting cold and you do feel like Satan is trying is trying his best to get you from that redh hot condition because remember that's Le a DEA is lukewarm amen then may this be a year of rededication reconsecration to where God can make you an apostle of your home where whatever your influence is it doesn't have to be you know whatever influence God has given you in your home your mother with children or on the job or co-workers take that and be an apostle unto the Lord Jesus God bless you tonight amen thank you Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord Brother William was speaking this song just kept reeling in my mind and I think I've only ever sang it once so we'll see if I can sing it again KC think about I I've always loved the story of Legion just how powerful it is you know and I always always thought what was amazing to me is that that Legion even in his bound condition he could say thou most high God it's the same language that Abraham uses when he's talking to MDC now what was on the inside of him amen can you see as I look back

that means my expectation is high have your Bibles turn to Joshua chapter 1 actually Romans chapter 4 first and then Joshua chapter 1 just a little thought the Lord put on my heart by the help of the Lord we'll just tie this all together tonight just believe God's got something for us amen amen Romans 4 and verse 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised you may have your seats you know I want to catch one word there and my title tonight is take another step take another step you know we've walked into a new year amen amen has he not heard our cries brother Matthew and he's been been with us there every step of the way but now God is saying you are my bride you are the one that I have called by my name you are the one it's time we stop crying and let's start moving forward in Jesus Christ I'm not saying that we don't cry out to God but we identify who we are and it's time we step in what God said we were amen we ain't got to back down any longer saints of God we are the Bride of Jesus Christ he's identified us does that mean we don't have problems no that doesn't mean we don't have problems but we've got a God that's walking with us the Bible says steps so that's not one step amen we don't believe in a one-step program well I made it to church that's good enough what brother William was talking about a new birth why don't you walk all the way to a new birth you made a been to the altar you may have had a life change but that's not good enough you got to be cleansed you got to be filled and you got to be walking where God can speak through you take another step tonight I don't know where you're at but this is your service to take a step let's move into this new year a different person let's go to Joshua I want to catch this scripture you it's been a little while since I preached that anointing is real let me tell you and I love it I love it say of God Joshua chapter one brother brenon would take a Bible and he'd pick a Bible up all the time and this is where he would go amen pull that up for me shaking my goodness you love the Lord amen Joshua chapter one verse one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the the Lord spake un to Joshua the son of n Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore rise go over this Jordan you know many people have stayed with brother Brandon being the prophet and they've never walked on to the Holy Ghost themselves they identify that there is a message they identify that there was Malachi 4 but they never take the steps thems and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that now they are a living breathing Jesus Christ Living and walking the same steps that he did the works that I do ye shall do also saints of God that is where we should be walking and if we're not walking it's not because the word isn't true it's because we need to die out more to self that the word of God may be made flesh in this end time amen verse he said listen he says go thou and all he says arise therefore arise saints of God it's not time to be downtrodden brother the matter I barely made it through we're not a people of barely making it through we're a people that have already made it in the mind of Jesus Christ in God's mind we're already there so while we're here let's walk as he would walk let's walk he didn't walk to Calvary complaining well Glory sorry if you're that complainer I just stepped all over your toes quit complaining it's time to go you're a winner you're saved you're Sanctified you're filled with the Holy Ghost then take another step God can use you Hallelujah let me read all down all down in verse nine then we'll go back I he says arise over this Jordan thou and all thy people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel listen to the scripture every place no remember brother Brandon would pick up a Bible and they'd say open it and he would open it to these scriptures I do need that water he'd open it to those scriptures over and over and over and over and over again then I say there's something there for the bride cuz if it was there for the messenger it was there for the bride let us recognize every place the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said into Moses and from the Wilderness and leant even unto the Great River river of fres all the land of the Hittites and the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of our life as I was with Moses so will I be with you I will not fail thee nor forsake thee listen to the word of God be strong and of good courage for under th people shalt thou divide for inheritance of land which I swear to their fathers to give them only be strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which to Moses thy servant commanded thee if the Bible says we can do it all then I got some people here tonight that say Lord that scripture is spoken to me Lord I don't want to be lacking in any bit come on somebody be honest with yourself Lord the scripture said that I can do it all then Lord I want to be able I want to see you do it Through Me Lord let me get out of your way amen let's get out of the way Lord let us get out of God's way he can do more things through you than you could ever imagine but you got your idea on what God can and can't do well why don't you quit limiting God come on we're walking into a new year I don't know about you I'm not walking down I'm walking up come on somebody I'm walking up out of here that I'm expecting more next year than I had

look at me it ain't been easy but I heard a voice and the voice of God begin to speak to me and the same way that Father Abraham walked is the same way that I'm walking and it's the same way every born again son of daughter of God they may not know what tomorrow holds but they know who holds tomorrow and if God told me that his hand is not too short his strength is not not diminished at all he's still the same yesterday today forever did Abraham know every step of the way no he did not but he listened to the voice of God I don't have time to do this but I wanted to put a blindfold on somebody and I'm getting to talk to them they don't have the sense of their own sight they can't see what's going on come on somebody sometimes we can't see any can't see into the spiritual world of what's going on but there's one that knows exactly what's going on and he just wants somebody to listen to The Voice Titus stand up I want to do it anyway close your eyes now promise me don't open

take one step up all right take another step up sometimes when get gets a little hard you'll hear his voice but you'll also feel him how many Love is feeling the Lord Jesus but it doesn't happen all the time go back to your seat buddy take another step tonight I don't know what he's telling you he dealt with my heart about this so I believe God works on both sides come on somebody he works on both sides before I even got here God's already talking to you to take another step it might be walk away from this come on you might have to walk away from this friend well Glory I know that's not nice preaching but it's the truth anyway it's time to go little bride take another step tonight maybe you've been to the water and been baptized and God's dealing with you to get Sanctified maybe you never been to the water and been baptized you come to an altar but why don't you take the step of baptism I guarantee you we can fill it tonight if we need to it won't take long might be a water cold gray but that's all right maybe you've never made that step but what is that voice that's speaking not here right here to your heart who is that calling your name why don't you follow that step who is it that's telling you these aren't good I know I'm an evangelist leave me alone who is it that's telling you quit it it's hurting you it's hurting Hur your testimony yeah get quiet that's all right it's the truth anyway my voice is just matching with his voice that's already speaking with you so the mouth of two witnesses why don't you walk right into your [Applause] deliverance there praise the Lord maybe you say brother matter I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost come on well the Holy Ghost Giver is here tonight and it is not Matthew mcclard it is not Ron Spencer it is not Andrew censer it is not Matthew it is not William Boron it is Jesus Christ and he's here with you and he said he never leave you nor forsake you he's the same God that called you he's the same God that heard when you cried he's the same God delivered you from Legion he's the same God but he's saying to you tonight take another step and Joshua as you go on down that step is already yours here we go that step is already yours it's already your possession if I told you there's $1,000 right right here and the first person that got it could keep it he's like I got all kinds of things I can buy or save bye but all you had to do was take a step and go get it then if I could tell you everything that you have need of is in the building that all you got to do is believe and they take a step of faith and watch God do a miracle right there in your Pew he doesn't have to be at the end of the service right now you can receive it woo Glory down to the church ages Jesus has been walking how do you know that brother Matt Revelations chapter 2 verse one it says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things sayth he that hold the Seven Stars of his right hand who walketh let give a little something here eth on the end of that means he continually walkth that's why if you sinth it's not bad it's not good because you sin but let me tell you he's walking he's walking with you he was walking with him in Ephesus he walked with them when they Mar themselves he walk with them he walk with them and he's walking with you tonight he just needs a walking partner how about you raise your hand up and say Lord I'll walk with you I'll take another step I'll give you my all Lord Jesus [Music] take another step three times it said in these scriptures right here be strong and very courageous why would it say that cuz it's going to be hard cuz you got to walk against am this old boy and this old boy wants what this old boy wants but there's a God that said be strong and very courageous that means don't let your faith go down when things get hard don't let your faith go down when things get to the point that you don't see a way out just hold on God said he'd make a way out and he's done it time and time and time again I think of the Hebrew children you think it was hard they had the word of Daniel Do Not Bow Lord aren't you thankful for the word of a prophet but it's not just the word of a prophet it's the that we have marching orders to it's what we step to Matthew talked about those trials he's been through in the whole time maybe unconsciously he didn't know God was right there with him and he stepped into the car and let you know I'm right there with him so it doesn't matter what you walk through whether you walk through back pain or whether you walk through this you're going to walk on to Glory buddy [Applause] I know some of you going through some hard things but Walk On The Best Is Yet To Come one Glimpse will be worth it all just to see him Hebrew children could you imagine the last step I mean come on I got two new fireplaces I'm a good Pyro that's fun still a little boy can't help it but I tell you what sometimes that dude gets hot that's what it's supposed to do that's good just not good for your hands but I could not imagine a whole furnace seven times hotter than they ever got it I'm on you know what church age we're in but there was a people that would not bow I'm not bowing to the image of William brandom come on somebody I'm not bwing to that image that's not the image I see when I see this message I see Christ I see Jesus that's who I'm B to and if he said don't bow I Will Not Bow let's don't compromise on this message let's stick right to it what did he say there in verse seven pull verse seven back up huh hey there's Josh verse 7 aren't you glad it's verse 7 amen I'm sorry those things mean something to me only be thou strong and very courageous th thou mayest mayest observe to do according to all the [Music] law which Moses my servant commanded has there not been another prophet in this day and end times SS of God that's brought forth the word of God and it's not for us to fight with that's right but it's to walk in all I'm gonna take five more minutes come on here comes the closing I don't know what it is but here we go it's cuz he's in control he's in control say so God stay with this message I don't care what anybody says you stay right with this message and don't just quote it from your mouth let your life bring action behind it and you watch God come and meet you in every trial and every fire and every problem he'll be right there with you all right two more points I'm going to close why does it have to be so hard sometimes with Matt all right nobody's asked that question question we're going Pop Quiz you again come on now why does it have to be so hard cuz you're not leaving here with your bank account you're not leaving here with your cards you're not leaving here with your problems come on but you're leaving here with character and character is a victory that sometimes you got to walk when you don't think you can walk that's right it's funny how William would close with Peter and Jesus walking on the water because God will ask you sometimes to walk in places that according to your carnal mind it looks absolutely impossible but you know what he's telling you right now come come come amen take another step Hallelujah will you trust me show me you'll trust me step out of the boat step into places you never thought you could step before step into the third pole come on somebody all he needs is a voice that'll yield thems and walk right into the third pole being made manifest in your home it won't be a public show but when the bride has need of it she'll speak that's right and there's a king brother Andrew's been preaching about it there's a king's Ministry that'll step right into a bride's Ministry and the manifestation of Jesus Christ let me read this quote as we close man I got to catch one more thing before I close it said as you walk make sure you keep the word in your mouth I'm Healed I'm saved I am filled with the Holy Ghost I'm an overcomer I love that song I'm an overcomer I've been bought with a price I am the one he went to die for I Am Redeemed Malachi 4 was sent for me SS of God there is power in your word so when you don't think you can walk begin to confess the word of God he said by my by my stripes ye are healed amen by my stripes you are healed The Works that I do ye shall do also Father I need you and you'll walk right into the manifestation of the word of God you love him some people some people can't walk unless they know the end of it amen listen I'm glad I'm not that person cuz I never been here I'd have been back in Indiana for three years figuring how I was all going to work some people are just all right let's go believe that's what the bride is cuz they're lambs and they're willing to follow brother BR would encounter somebody like that and he had a lantern in his hand he had a lantern in his hand brother B began to ask him he said where's your home it was dark out two miles that way imagine walking with a lantern for two two miles I like cars I don't know about you but he couldn't see very far the another where the landing would go but when he took another step he got a little more understanding of where he was at you may not understand where you're at but if you take another step God will show you more and more and more that you don't have to figure out the end from beginning you know if I've got the light and I'm walking in the light then I'll fellowship with the light and the Lord will take me on read this right here he says and you were fil and you you're here to fulfill it to just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk listen there's going to be criticism there's going to be fear I'm not here to preach some flowery bed of e there's going to be those things but a prophet told us walk unconscious of it that means don't let it bother you walk unconscious of the world unto the world walk as you'd Walk In Christ walk with him not paying attention the right hand left hand keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah if sickness strikes with you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God Enoch one day walked like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen walk with God doctor says you're going to die walk with God he's not sitting there right now but let me tell you that man is a living testimony he's been walking with God and has God forsaken him no he's beat everyone the doctors are amazed they don't know what to do with it but I know what to do I sing praises unto my king cuz I love him and he said if you trust me he'll use you I can never have that's what he's doing he's walking in it he's walking in his Miracle why don't you do the same just so clap for him you do the same through your problem through your arle Keep On Walking let me finish just S stand your feet he says doctor says you can't well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world he took on Oath by the Covenant that he gave you and he confirm it just walk with God you'll have ups and downs don't worry you got to go through Bri patches over sharp rocks over blust down
