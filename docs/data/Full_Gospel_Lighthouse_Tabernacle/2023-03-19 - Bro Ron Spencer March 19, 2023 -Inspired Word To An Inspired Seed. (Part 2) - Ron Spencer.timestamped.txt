[45:57] thank the Lord for what he's doing
[45:59] and God is so good to us
[46:02] I I want to I want to just share a
[46:06] couple things with you this morning we
[46:08] spoke to you on an inspired word to an
[46:10] inspired seed last night
[46:12] we have brother Kelly Hildebrandt coming
[46:15] for us next weekend and brother Tim
[46:17] Pruitt
[46:18] and a few years ago three years ago
[46:21] brother Kelly was coming in November
[46:25] December right in that time frame and it
[46:28] was before that we we had cancer or
[46:31] knowledge of cancer
[46:32] and uh
[46:35] and so his brother arrived on time
[46:38] he actually was just spot on time
[46:41] Kelly was three days
[46:43] trying to get here
[46:45] and so and so it looked like he couldn't
[46:48] come he couldn't arrive and
[46:50] and so we actually even had to go get
[46:53] him in Washington
[46:55] the luggage was lost
[46:58] and I and I just spoke to you on on that
[47:00] Saturday evening and during the week
[47:03] that week the Lord spoke to me and give
[47:06] me a sermon called don't worry
[47:09] don't worry
[47:11] and so I said whatever whatever brother
[47:14] Kelly has to say to us
[47:17] tomorrow tomorrow evening we'll just
[47:20] change the service and have it instead
[47:21] of the morning we'll have it in the
[47:22] evening and whatever brother Kelly has
[47:25] to say to us Satan's trying to stop
[47:29] and so when brother Kelly arrived and we
[47:32] picked him up and we took him and they
[47:34] had had a long night and he went home
[47:36] and he slept an hour or so and and then
[47:39] we came to service and brother Kelly
[47:41] stood in the Pulpit after I had spoke on
[47:44] on Saturday night on don't worry
[47:48] and brother Kelly presented me with a
[47:50] coin and it was the it's a commemoration
[47:54] of Normandy D-Day
[47:56] of June 6th of 1944.
[48:01] in World War II and it had a pebble of
[48:04] sand on it and the Canadians had made it
[48:08] and I had saw it and I really liked it
[48:12] I had no idea that he would bring me one
[48:17] and he presented it to me on that
[48:19] evening
[48:20] none of us knew what we were getting
[48:22] ready to face
[48:24] we will accept nothing less
[48:28] than full victory
[48:34] last year when brother Kelly came
[48:37] he presented me with this statue
[48:40] and as a statue of David
[48:44] with his foot on Goliath's head
[48:48] and that's where we believe that we've
[48:50] got
[48:51] our foot on Cancer's head
[48:54] [Applause]
[49:06] Hallelujah
[49:09] God knows doesn't he
[49:11] yeah I want to share a few things with
[49:13] you this morning personally from my
[49:15] heart
[49:16] and we want to remember Sister Linda in
[49:19] prayer as we get this from her request
[49:21] that God would just intervene in a lot
[49:24] of things there and and help her there
[49:27] in a special way
[49:28] amen if you'll stand to your feet and
[49:30] and then I'll just share us some things
[49:32] that's on my heart this morning

[49:39] love the singing this morning thank you
[49:41] for those songs
[49:43] amen Isaiah 53 and verse 5.
[49:47] Andrew is speaking right now and we want
[49:50] to remember him in prayer
[49:52] and I want to speak again on inspired
[49:55] word to an inspired seed
[50:04] but he was wounded for our
[50:07] transgressions
[50:11] he was bruised
[50:14] for our iniquities
[50:17] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[50:20] him
[50:21] and with his stripes we are healed
[50:25] I'd like for us all to read that
[50:27] together
[50:28] but he was wounded for our
[50:31] transgressions
[50:33] he was bruised for our iniquities
[50:37] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[50:41] him
[50:42] and with his stripes we are healed
[50:46] he may be seated
[50:51] in first John chapter 4 and verse 4.
[50:56] year of God little children and have
[50:59] overcome
[51:01] them because greater is he that is in
[51:04] you
[51:05] then he that is in the world
[51:09] second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 5
[51:12] says
[51:13] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[51:17] to think anything of ourselves but our
[51:21] sufficiency
[51:23] is of God
[51:26] in second Corinthians chapter 12 and
[51:28] verse 19. and he said unto me my grace
[51:32] is sufficient for thee for my strength
[51:35] is made perfect in weakness
[51:38] most gladly therefore will I rather
[51:40] glory in mine infirmities that the power
[51:44] of Christ May rest upon me
[51:48] Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29.
[51:51] he giveth power to the faint
[51:54] and to them that have no might he
[51:57] increases strength
[51:59] even the use shall faint and be weary
[52:03] and the young shall utterly fall
[52:07] verse 40 verse 31
[52:10] but they that wait upon the Lord
[52:16] shall renew their strength
[52:19] they shall Mount upon wings
[52:22] as an eagle they shall run and not be
[52:26] weary they shall walk and not faint
[52:29] could you read that verse with me but
[52:32] they that wait upon the Lord
[52:35] shall renew their strength they shall
[52:39] Mount upon wings as an eagle they shall
[52:42] run and not be weary they shall walk
[52:47] and not thanked
[52:50] behold in Isaiah chapter 54 and verse
[52:54] 16. behold I have created the Smith that
[52:57] bloweth the coals in the fire and that
[53:00] bringeth forth an instrument for his
[53:02] work I have created the waste to destroy
[53:07] read this next verse with me
[53:10] no weapon that is formed against thee
[53:13] shall prosper and every tongue shall
[53:16] rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[53:20] condemn this is the heritage of the
[53:24] Servants of the Lord and the
[53:27] righteousness is of them
[53:29] saith the Lord
[53:31] Revelations chapter 12 and verse 10. and
[53:35] I heard a loud voice in of Heaven in
[53:38] saying in heaven now is come salvation
[53:42] and strength and the kingdom of her God
[53:45] and the power of His Christ for the
[53:48] accuser of our Brethren is cast down
[53:54] which accused them before our God
[53:58] day and not read these next words with
[54:02] me and they overcame by the blood of the
[54:07] lamb and the word of their testimony and
[54:11] they love not their lives
[54:17] foreign
[54:19] the book that we have just read from
[54:22] is not a book of theory
[54:26] it's not a book of IFS
[54:29] this is God's word
[54:31] it is the inspired word of the Lord
[54:36] it is not a time-dated word
[54:40] it is for eternity
[54:44] the promises that are in there every one
[54:47] of them are true and they're still
[54:50] effective today
[54:51] we realize that there's some scriptures
[54:54] that are there that are historical that
[54:57] were there when David was there battles
[54:59] that they had to fight and God was an I
[55:02] am God for them then
[55:06] but I want you to just notice he's not
[55:08] just a historical God but he's a god of
[55:11] the living
[55:13] he's an I am God today
[55:16] in Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. if
[55:20] you could just flip that up for me real
[55:21] quick
[55:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[55:27] and forever
[55:30] could you read that with me Jesus Christ
[55:33] the same yesterday
[55:37] and forever
[55:41] if he ever healed 2 000 years ago
[55:46] and he ever healed a thousand years ago
[55:49] he's the same God for us today brother
[55:52] Jolly he's our God
[55:57] he's more than just somebody else's God
[56:00] God wants to be a personal God to you
[56:03] now God wants you to take it into your
[56:07] heart
[56:07] and more than just think it but he wants
[56:10] you to speak it across your lips the
[56:13] most Supernatural part about you as a
[56:16] human being is your tongue and your lips
[56:20] because you speak positive or you speak
[56:24] negative
[56:27] you have the power in your lips to
[56:31] create your atmosphere around you
[56:34] we come to church we've left home maybe
[56:38] you've had troubles at home maybe you
[56:39] had a flat tire on the way to church
[56:41] maybe you had difficulties maybe maybe
[56:44] you've had trouble with your job
[56:46] and we come into church and we pray and
[56:49] get ourselves ready for the service of
[56:51] the Lord the the man of God comes and he
[56:54] begins to sing and music is played music
[56:58] begins to calm down spirits
[57:02] there's an important part of music
[57:05] David would go and play before Saul
[57:07] because Saul was troubled in his Spirit
[57:11] he was backslidden and those demons
[57:14] would take a hold of him and David be an
[57:17] anointed of God
[57:19] would come and play and as he would play
[57:23] those demons would loose
[57:27] they would loose themselves off of Saul
[57:30] and he would fill an atmosphere
[57:33] an atmosphere of the Holy presence of
[57:36] God and would feel that it would release
[57:39] him
[57:41] that's what happens to us when we come
[57:43] to church
[57:44] the music begins to play Maybe It's
[57:47] Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what
[57:51] a foretaste of Glory Divine I'm an heir
[57:55] of salvation
[57:57] I'm purchased of God
[58:00] the man of God begins to sing whether
[58:03] you know this or not songs were inspired
[58:06] of the Lord the writer begins to write
[58:09] under that inspiration songs of Victory
[58:13] songs of Joy songs of healing songs of
[58:18] praise unto God
[58:21] and as you sing those songs before the
[58:24] Lord and you begin to worship
[58:27] we don't come here to be entertained
[58:30] there's no stars among us we come here
[58:33] to Worship the Lord
[58:36] he is worthy of our worship and is you
[58:39] not just the son as you begin to sing
[58:45] it will change your atmosphere where
[58:47] you're sitting it'll change your
[58:50] attitude
[58:52] and you sing it and you sing it not just
[58:55] to mumble but you sing it loud enough to
[58:58] wear that from your vocal cords
[59:03] and you hear it in your ears you're
[59:06] singing victory you're singing Praise
[59:14] maybe it comes time for the preaching of
[59:17] the word men of God become inspired with
[59:20] a certain scripture with a certain thing
[59:22] and they begin to they begin to preach
[59:24] the word then that word goes into your
[59:27] ears and there's something on the inside
[59:29] of you said that's real
[59:32] that's for me it was like God was in my
[59:35] kitchen it was like God's in my car
[59:37] God's a personal God he's a discerner of
[59:41] the thoughts and the intents of the
[59:42] heart
[59:44] and before long it begins to Echo in
[59:47] your heart and then you begin to respond
[59:53] and you say well brother Ron response is
[59:55] really not important
[59:58] well did you marry a mannequin
[1:00:04] you set her over in the corner and you
[1:00:07] say honey I love you
[1:00:09] she's always got the same look
[1:00:15] she always smells the same
[1:00:19] she never moves come on
[1:00:22] come on brother God's not looking for a
[1:00:25] mannequin for a wife
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:32] The Book of Psalms is full of songs
[1:00:36] are you with me God's looking for your
[1:00:40] response to the work
[1:00:42] and then it arms you for the battles
[1:00:44] that you will face next week and the
[1:00:47] week after and then it gives you
[1:00:49] strength for the battles that you have
[1:00:51] been through
[1:00:53] let me just give you a little little
[1:00:55] help here the battles that you have been
[1:00:58] through in your past are only
[1:01:01] preparation for the one that you're
[1:01:03] getting ready to go through
[1:01:06] [Applause]
[1:01:08] it was training grounds to get you ready
[1:01:10] for the battle in front of you
[1:01:13] the battle will never be over until we
[1:01:17] go to the other side
[1:01:20] but when the battle is over we shall
[1:01:24] wear a crown wear a crown wear a crown
[1:01:27] when my battle is over we will wear a
[1:01:32] crown
[1:01:33] [Applause]
[1:01:37] all right
[1:01:40] I want to share this this morning
[1:01:45] because it's an active word
[1:01:48] and we'll just share a few testimonies
[1:01:50] that all right
[1:01:52] I was in prayer this morning
[1:01:55] and as I was in prayer
[1:01:58] the Lord spoke to me
[1:02:02] and he spoke to me about a little girl
[1:02:04] here in the building

[1:02:10] Zoe is a has a problem with her voice to
[1:02:14] speak
[1:02:17] she's been going to specialists
[1:02:21] and the Lord spoke to me and said I sent
[1:02:23] her through this
[1:02:25] to develop her singing voice
[1:02:30] so she would have a certain sound
[1:02:33] [Applause]
[1:02:45] brother Ron I don't know much about that
[1:02:48] God spoke to me on a Sunday morning
[1:02:52] and I came to the service
[1:02:55] and I told
[1:02:58] brother William that God's going to
[1:03:00] visit us at his house today

[1:03:06] Wesley couldn't walk
[1:03:09] at that time
[1:03:10] and he's way past walking
[1:03:13] and you've seen the video
[1:03:16] God showed me the vision that I would
[1:03:19] pick him up and I even said Lord he
[1:03:21] won't let me pick him up
[1:03:26] and I saw myself walking up and down the
[1:03:28] aisle

[1:07:06] the world

[1:08:03] but of all the weak
[1:08:05] he wants to be here in service and play
[1:08:07] music
[1:08:10] it's paying to which doctors can't
[1:08:12] hardly help him
[1:08:15] but he endures the pain to be able to
[1:08:17] send him these Services I want to say
[1:08:19] this to you in the Eternal Realm
[1:08:22] that pain will mean nothing
[1:08:35] brother Donnie was offered a lot of
[1:08:37] contracts to sing music all over
[1:08:40] in a popular realm he will get paid much
[1:08:43] more sitting here

[1:09:02] to take care of that

[1:13:15] and we were sitting as a family together
[1:13:16] and behind us
[1:13:19] set brother Denny and sister Sean and
[1:13:21] Mary
[1:13:28] is that how it was brother Denny
[1:13:32] and I turned around to her and I said I

[1:13:43] Amen brother Zach it's okay if you want
[1:13:46] to stand
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:14:05] I was sitting in Edmonton
[1:14:14] and just give you a little background
[1:14:16] where this part came from
[1:14:19] the other morning I was in prayer
[1:14:22] and I was deeply burdened
[1:14:25] about going this year in July
[1:14:31] I was deeply burdened I'll be honest
[1:14:33] with you I was just phenomenally
[1:14:34] burdened
[1:14:44] I said Lord would you just let me know
[1:14:48] if I'm going to have the strength
[1:14:50] to be able to go to Edmonton and preach
[1:14:52] those meetings
[1:14:59] and almost immediately I got a text from
[1:15:02] Brother Ed hammermeister and he said
[1:15:05] brother Ron I want you to come and
[1:15:06] preach the meetings
[1:15:09] so I believe I'm going to have the
[1:15:11] strength to go
[1:15:13] [Applause]
[1:15:22] I was sitting
[1:15:24] in Edmonton at a hotel
[1:15:29] a set into the deaf studying
[1:15:31] and he looked up and saw a vision
[1:15:36] I saw a vision of Matthew sitting on the
[1:15:38] side of the road in the gravels
[1:15:40] holding his knee
[1:15:43] and I saw a motorcycle going around in
[1:15:45] circles
[1:15:47] I always hated them things
[1:15:50] it's okay brother Ernie it's just part
[1:15:52] of my deal I hated him because I really
[1:15:54] wanted to ride him back
[1:16:00] I called him and I said Matt are you
[1:16:02] okay and he said yeah Daddy
[1:16:04] I'm okay
[1:16:06] I said hey I
[1:16:10] how was the wreck on the motorcycle
[1:16:12] he said Daddy nobody knows that but
[1:16:15] Cassie
[1:16:16] and the guy that came to get the
[1:16:18] motorcycle
[1:16:20] nobody knows it
[1:16:23] he said we haven't told a soul
[1:16:27] well there's a higher power
[1:16:34] God rich in Mercy was watching over him
[1:16:36] as that bike's going around in a circle
[1:16:40] that could have been a whole lot
[1:16:41] different
[1:16:46] well you're talking about people here
[1:16:48] well can you can I give you a couple
[1:16:49] more
[1:16:53] we were in Germany and brother Tim
[1:16:55] Pruitt's wife was going through some
[1:16:58] real cycles of life and she was about a
[1:17:01] loser mind
[1:17:03] and in the middle of the service while
[1:17:06] I'm preaching
[1:17:09] I called her out and she stood in the
[1:17:12] middle of the aisle
[1:17:13] and I prayed for her
[1:17:16] and God totally 100 percent healed her
[1:17:21] of that issue in her life brother Tim
[1:17:25] said I left the room with one wife and I
[1:17:28] went back home with another wave
[1:17:38] she had a brain bleed
[1:17:40] and after the brain bleed she was so
[1:17:43] depressed because she couldn't see
[1:17:45] like she used to see and she was so
[1:17:48] having so much trouble
[1:17:51] the year before they had a little boy
[1:17:54] named Drew
[1:17:56] and Drew
[1:18:00] come into a very powerful moment now
[1:18:04] Drew
[1:18:07] couldn't walk
[1:18:10] and Bethany
[1:18:12] was bringing a blanket through the
[1:18:14] prayer line
[1:18:16] for Lydia's Baby that had been born with
[1:18:19] jaundice
[1:18:22] I had just before told Timothy that was
[1:18:26] standing beside of me
[1:18:29] I saw a vision of Drew walking
[1:18:33] and so I when Bethany comes through I
[1:18:37] said Bethany where's where's Drew at she
[1:18:39] said he's he's in the he's in the bed
[1:18:42] he's asleep
[1:18:44] I said Bethany
[1:18:46] we asked her what the blanket was for
[1:18:48] and it was for the baby with jaundice
[1:18:50] and just to give you an idea God healed
[1:18:53] that baby immediately from the jaundice
[1:18:56] I said go get Drew we need to pray for
[1:18:59] him I sell a vision of him walking
[1:19:04] listen these are generational miracles
[1:19:11] are you with me we're talking about an
[1:19:12] inspired word to an inspired seed I'm
[1:19:15] going somewhere now
[1:19:18] and when sister
[1:19:20] uh Karen was sitting in the room and
[1:19:24] Drew was at her feet and God came
[1:19:27] through and touched her not only touched
[1:19:30] her but Drew
[1:19:32] begin to run
[1:19:35] all over that house
[1:19:38] we're talking about a God that's not a 2
[1:19:41] 000 years ago God
[1:19:47] This Is Our God
[1:19:49] [Applause]
[1:19:55] the next year
[1:19:58] I was preaching the meeting there
[1:20:01] and I asked where Drew was
[1:20:04] I think he was in bed again I don't
[1:20:07] think he's in bed this morning but
[1:20:10] they went and got him he was in his
[1:20:12] pajamas little red pajamas
[1:20:15] and I said Drew we're going to have a
[1:20:17] prayer line after a while in this
[1:20:19] meeting
[1:20:21] and I said you know
[1:20:24] I said we're going to walk because
[1:20:26] you're a miracle
[1:20:28] I'm standing before maybe maybe six
[1:20:31] seven hundred people and I said we're
[1:20:33] going to walk across this platform
[1:20:36] and there's people in a little while
[1:20:37] maybe an hour from now are going to walk
[1:20:40] in those steps and they're going to get
[1:20:42] miracles
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:46] they're going to get miracles did you
[1:20:48] hear me they're going to get Miracles I
[1:20:51] don't want to know what your need is
[1:20:54] but this service is your service
[1:20:58] because God changed me yesterday where I
[1:21:01] was going to go this morning so God's
[1:21:03] got plans
[1:21:06] and when God has plans
[1:21:08] he's going to do phenomenal things
[1:21:16] can I give you just a couple of Miracles
[1:21:18] that took place in that meeting
[1:21:21] in that meeting
[1:21:26] in that meeting Mariah
[1:21:29] who had Al capisia
[1:21:34] and she had brought three bobby pins
[1:21:37] with her her hair was gone
[1:21:40] she walked across that stage and said I
[1:21:43] want to be able to use these bobby pins
[1:21:47] God restored her glory
[1:21:51] she got married last year I believe it
[1:21:53] was with a full head of hair
[1:22:06] Jessica
[1:22:09] brother Wendell's wife that preached to
[1:22:12] us just a little while ago brother
[1:22:14] Wendell who preached sister Jessica came
[1:22:17] across there she had a very Wayward Son
[1:22:21] and in the moment that she God kept
[1:22:24] speaking to me you stay on this stage
[1:22:26] until Jessica comes
[1:22:29] and when she stepped in front of me I
[1:22:31] said God's going to give you your son
[1:22:33] back
[1:22:35] that son now serves the Lord
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:51] we left the stage
[1:22:53] we got to the cabin
[1:22:56] and the Lord spoke to Aaron and said
[1:22:58] you'll never be the same from this day
[1:23:00] forward
[1:23:02] brother Aaron Oglesby is not an average
[1:23:04] preacher
[1:23:06] he could be a convention preacher
[1:23:08] anywhere
[1:23:09] he'd be here in June and he'll be here
[1:23:12] in September that's how much I think of
[1:23:15] him
[1:23:23] in that moment I saw the vision of a
[1:23:26] little boy walking across the yard
[1:23:29] with a Disney World Mickey Mouse on his
[1:23:34] shirt with his finger up like that and I
[1:23:37] said Andrew we're going to have a boy
[1:23:39] and he said not me Daddy
[1:23:44] and the little fella that just stood up
[1:23:46] back there
[1:23:47] listen this is more than imagination
[1:23:52] in the same prayer line that we prayed
[1:23:54] for we prayed for them the very next
[1:23:58] people in the prayer line
[1:24:02] was Jonathan
[1:24:05] or you guys at are you hiding
[1:24:09] she went out no she didn't right there
[1:24:11] she is
[1:24:14] and the next words was the same Angel
[1:24:17] that's visiting their home is visiting
[1:24:19] your home
[1:24:21] Adonai would you stand on would you
[1:24:23] stand on a seat
[1:24:26] she's my number one fan
[1:24:29] I like the boat
[1:24:32] Hallelujah
[1:24:33] now you can't put these things together
[1:24:38] sister Autumn and sister Whitney
[1:24:41] showed up at the same o b g y n
[1:24:48] don't ask me what all that means
[1:24:53] but I know it's not LGBT y'all whatever
[1:25:04] because they were in the same prayer
[1:25:07] line and the same God went to both
[1:25:09] houses
[1:25:10] and what was impossible for them and
[1:25:12] what was impossible for them now have
[1:25:15] living babies
[1:25:17] now you may doubt The Finnish boy coming
[1:25:20] back to life and you may doubt the cloud
[1:25:27] but I want to tell you our God's a
[1:25:29] living tonight
[1:25:31] he's a living God
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:53] Satan gets in our ears and he whispers
[1:25:55] to us it's not going to happen it's
[1:25:57] impossible it's impossible it's not
[1:25:59] going to happen
[1:26:01] in Sarasota Florida
[1:26:04] I was staying with brother Tim Pruitt in
[1:26:07] a Airbnb I was staying in a
[1:26:11] there with Timothy Pruitt Jason Jackson
[1:26:14] brothers all Brothers
[1:26:17] Timothy Pruitt and myself was all in the
[1:26:20] same house well you're talking about a
[1:26:21] barrel of fun
[1:26:24] but God gave me a vision
[1:26:27] that I was getting ready this is all the
[1:26:29] month before that I got diagnosed with
[1:26:31] cancer that I was getting ready to go
[1:26:33] through the worst
[1:26:47] the worst Valley of my life and
[1:26:49] destruction
[1:26:50] but at the bottom of that Valley there
[1:26:53] was a girl there
[1:26:55] and she looked like she was in horrible
[1:26:57] condition
[1:26:59] and I asked her are you ready to go home
[1:27:05] that girl is sitting right there named
[1:27:11] whether a lot of you run understand it
[1:27:13] or not that vision
[1:27:16] three years later we prayed with her at
[1:27:19] this altar the other day
[1:27:22] don't tell me God's not rich in Mercy
[1:27:30] I could stand here for hours and tell
[1:27:32] you Miracle after Miracle laughter
[1:27:34] Miracle laughter miracle
[1:27:39] but I'm not just interested in the
[1:27:41] Miracles that has happened
[1:27:44] I'm not just interested in the Miracles
[1:27:47] that has happened
[1:27:49] listen we need more than just getting
[1:27:52] healed of cancer
[1:27:54] because God already healed me at Calvary
[1:27:57] 2000 years ago
[1:27:59] and he told me
[1:28:02] he told me if you'll trust me I'll use
[1:28:05] you like never before and he has
[1:28:21] within minutes
[1:28:24] of him telling me that I saw the vision
[1:28:28] of you walking down this this aisle with
[1:28:31] a baby in your hands I'm not talking
[1:28:33] about that baby either
[1:28:38] I'd like for you goddess to take a
[1:28:40] stroll this morning
[1:28:42] holding hands
[1:28:44] because it's laying right in your future
[1:28:50] we took a picture the other day with the
[1:28:53] before now we're going to exercise it I
[1:28:56] want the whole world to watch you two
[1:28:57] walk around this area
[1:29:00] thank you
[1:30:02] to be seated
[1:30:10] sisters you know when I preached your
[1:30:11] mother's funeral
[1:30:14] and I stood in the room with you as a
[1:30:16] family
[1:30:17] and I stepped out and walked in front of
[1:30:19] you guys
[1:30:21] when I turned and looked back at you
[1:30:22] just before we walked into the sanctuary
[1:30:24] God spoke to me and said she's coming
[1:30:27] home
[1:30:31] and now you're here
[1:30:35] David
[1:30:36] good to be home
[1:31:04] they told you we didn't believe the
[1:31:05] message
[1:31:11] we didn't believe it
[1:31:15] brother Chris and Sister Mary
[1:31:20] you can say today
[1:31:22] they were wrong
[1:31:24] come on they were wrong
[1:31:28] welcome home
[1:31:37] I wouldn't do this without instructions
[1:31:40] from the Lord
[1:31:43] I absolutely would not
[1:31:46] do this
[1:31:57] I don't want to point you out but hunter
[1:32:01] I don't want to point you out
[1:32:03] God brought you here
[1:32:06] God brought you here
[1:32:09] and God has great plans
[1:32:14] when I was studying yesterday
[1:32:19] as I was as I was studying
[1:32:24] he called your name
[1:32:27] and it's like he said it's like as a
[1:32:31] lawyer
[1:32:32] Hunter has to take the loss
[1:32:36] it goes back in all the books
[1:32:41] and those things that have been
[1:32:44] judged on
[1:32:46] he can now use them as the case
[1:32:49] for the case that you're trying
[1:32:53] brother Branham said
[1:32:55] when the first time you preached a
[1:32:57] sermon he said he walked out and he said
[1:32:59] to people laughed and the people cried
[1:33:01] and they were emotional
[1:33:04] but his Pastor took him back in the
[1:33:06] office and said that's the worst I've
[1:33:08] ever heard
[1:33:11] he said you got the people laughing you
[1:33:13] got them crying
[1:33:15] but you didn't take the word
[1:33:19] and the word is what
[1:33:21] is what we've got to have
[1:33:26] Hunter is a lawyer you just can't work
[1:33:28] on the emotions of the people
[1:33:31] you got to take loss
[1:33:34] and as he spoke to me those things
[1:33:36] yesterday I thought I thought about it
[1:33:39] how that we stand in this Pulpit with
[1:33:41] the message
[1:33:42] and with this Bible
[1:33:45] and it's not just words
[1:33:48] it's not just words brother duck
[1:33:51] but it's power it's life
[1:33:57] the scripture said these signs shall
[1:34:00] follow them that believe
[1:34:03] in my name
[1:34:07] in my name
[1:34:09] lay hands on the sick
[1:34:11] and they shall recover
[1:34:16] in my name you'll cast out devils
[1:34:21] are you with me this message was sent to
[1:34:24] us to open the book
[1:34:27] and to reveal the seals and reveal the
[1:34:29] Thunders and reveal the word of God that
[1:34:33] was hidden for for thousands of years
[1:34:37] and it was given to us
[1:34:40] that we could defeat the Devil anywhere
[1:34:45] anytime under any condition
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:50] and it goes across your lips and I want
[1:34:54] to ask you then what are we have to be
[1:34:57] afraid about
[1:35:00] amen
[1:35:04] I exercised and I shared with you faith
[1:35:10] can you imagine how many times through
[1:35:12] the
[1:35:13] through time that the devil whispered in
[1:35:16] my ear three years
[1:35:19] they're not having a baby
[1:35:23] they're not having a baby the vision
[1:35:24] said you must have missed it
[1:35:29] but I can look in the word and it says
[1:35:31] that Abraham believed God
[1:35:35] and 25 years later
[1:35:41] this isn't an opinion here
[1:35:43] [Applause]
[1:35:44] 25 years later God turned Abraham and
[1:35:48] Sarah and actually told Sarah is there
[1:35:52] anything too impossible for God
[1:35:56] brother on you guys believe
[1:36:00] sister Connie goes and puts flowers on
[1:36:02] brother Homer's grave
[1:36:04] one day that grave is going to be like
[1:36:07] the Tomb of Jesus
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:15] one day it's going to be an empty casket
[1:36:18] laying down inside of there
[1:36:22] when you go to your loved one's grave
[1:36:24] they may be in there now but there's
[1:36:26] going to come a moment in the moment in
[1:36:29] the twinkling of an eye this word's
[1:36:32] going to come into effect and their
[1:36:34] mortal is going to take on immortality
[1:36:37] and we're going to be changed
[1:36:43] how do you know that he said it I
[1:36:47] believe it that settles it
[1:36:53] thank you
[1:36:59] I don't say that just because it's an
[1:37:01] opinion I say it because it's fact

[1:40:02] feel like one
[1:40:05] moments

[1:40:11] I still decided man yesterday the other
[1:40:13] few weeks ago

[1:40:18] that takes care of patients as they come
[1:40:20] in wheelchairs and takes them to where
[1:40:22] they need to go we were standing and
[1:40:24] waiting in our line for our number to be
[1:40:26] called to be checked in
[1:40:28] he was standing beside of me and he said
[1:40:31] you know they talk a lot about you here
[1:40:37] they really
[1:40:39] he said you're the talk of this place
[1:40:42] you don't look like you've got cancer
[1:40:49] I was reading my chart this week and I
[1:40:52] thought about what he said

[1:40:57] chart says I have lung cancer my chart
[1:40:58] says that my my kidneys
[1:41:02] are abnormal my chart says there are
[1:41:05] spots on my organs
[1:41:07] I have sugar diabetes
[1:41:11] my chart says a lot of things
[1:41:15] but whose report do we believe
[1:41:29] there's people say I got a toe anchor I
[1:41:31] got this acre that ache let me just say
[1:41:35] God has put an example in front of you
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:39] whatever your excuse is
[1:41:43] bring it to church
[1:41:47] and if I wasn't a good enough example
[1:41:49] for you there's a fella sitting here
[1:41:51] with his leg cut off
[1:41:54] and said in a wheelchair and he took
[1:41:56] pain medicine on it way up the
[1:41:59] so he could get through the service and
[1:42:01] listen some to You Preach to you testify
[1:42:06] to you encouraged you let me just say
[1:42:09] you got no excuse
[1:42:32] thank you

[1:42:38] get over you wowzy wowzy woo it's all
[1:42:41] about me listen it's more than about you
[1:42:45] it's all about God
[1:42:48] you put God first in everything in your
[1:42:51] life God will help you through cancer
[1:42:54] he'll help you through your Valley he'll
[1:42:57] make your womb fertile
[1:42:59] [Applause]
[1:43:08] he giveth power to the faint
[1:43:12] and to them that have no might he
[1:43:14] increases strength
[1:43:17] second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 10
[1:43:19] therefore I take pleasure in infirmities
[1:43:22] this is God's word this is the Apostle
[1:43:25] Paul who writes all of this in a dungeon
[1:43:30] not in an office
[1:43:32] not at an iPad
[1:43:36] not after he had eat a steak dinner
[1:43:41] at the bottom of a about a 14 foot hole
[1:43:47] and they would take him out and soldiers
[1:43:49] would walk him around
[1:43:52] and while he was right while he was
[1:43:54] being walked around and chains he got
[1:43:57] inspired to about a sermon
[1:43:59] put on the whole armor of God
[1:44:03] no doubt as he looked up at the guy that
[1:44:05] was walking him around in all that armor
[1:44:07] he didn't go
[1:44:09] what a horrible thing if I hadn't
[1:44:11] preached this this message I wouldn't be
[1:44:14] in this dungeon so he sent a word for 2
[1:44:18] 000 years a word to real Believers put
[1:44:21] on the whole armor of God
[1:44:26] therefore I take pleasure
[1:44:29] in infirmities in reproaches in
[1:44:32] Necessities in persecutions in
[1:44:35] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[1:44:38] am weak
[1:44:42] then I am strong
[1:44:45] let's read that last portion for when I
[1:44:48] am weak then I am strong say it to your
[1:44:52] neighbor right there where you're at
[1:45:06] for God hath not given us the spirit of
[1:45:09] fear
[1:45:14] but a power
[1:45:17] hand of love
[1:45:19] and of a sound mind
[1:45:23] you do not know this my brother Homer
[1:45:25] would quote that almost every every day
[1:45:28] in the office back here because he felt
[1:45:31] like his mind was slipping away and he
[1:45:33] would just say this for God hath not
[1:45:35] given us a spirit of fear but of power
[1:45:38] and of love and of a sound mind
[1:45:42] listen quoting the scripture
[1:45:46] will bring you power
[1:45:49] it's an inspired word to an inspired
[1:45:52] seed you as a believer
[1:45:55] quoting the scripture destroys the devil
[1:46:01] you will not destroy him with your good
[1:46:03] looks you will not destroy him with your
[1:46:05] education you will destroy the Devil by
[1:46:08] taking God's word which is a sword and
[1:46:11] destroying him
[1:46:16] Psalms 18 and verse 1 I love I will love
[1:46:20] thee O Lord my strength the Lord is my
[1:46:23] rock and my Fortress my deliver my God
[1:46:25] my strength in whom I will trust my
[1:46:27] Buckler and the Horn of my salvation and
[1:46:30] my high power
[1:46:32] Romans 1 and verse 20 for the invisible
[1:46:35] things of him from the creation of the
[1:46:37] world are clearly seen being understood
[1:46:39] by the things that are made even his
[1:46:42] eternal God and godhead so that they are
[1:46:46] without excuse
[1:46:50] listen people that are sent to Hell have
[1:46:53] walked across the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:46:56] God gave every man and woman the
[1:46:59] opportunity to serve him every man and
[1:47:02] woman
[1:47:05] every man and woman it God don't send
[1:47:07] you to hell you sing yourself to hell
[1:47:10] it's your choice
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:18] a man in Louisiana
[1:47:22] Shreveport
[1:47:27] raised his hand
[1:47:29] and said there is no God
[1:47:32] in that moment lightning struck him
[1:47:37] when they were having his casket
[1:47:39] placed into the ground lightning hit the
[1:47:43] casket
[1:47:45] and throwed the man out of the casket
[1:47:48] you don't play with God
[1:47:52] you don't play with God
[1:47:57] now maybe
[1:47:59] let me just address the critic
[1:48:03] it's for a moment I'm I'm just I'm
[1:48:04] almost done
[1:48:09] people said Noah is crazy
[1:48:12] well just wait

[1:48:23] just wait
[1:48:29] just wait
[1:48:32] no doubt now I'm getting into two weeks
[1:48:34] from now sermon what's Jesus doing being
[1:48:38] beat like he is he's healing me

[1:48:50] no other man had ever been beat he's
[1:48:53] healing me
[1:48:54] it's not what you see it's what God's
[1:48:57] got a plan for
[1:48:59] why is he allowed to be able to put
[1:49:01] thorns on his head
[1:49:04] and being screamed that even even even
[1:49:08] to have barabba set free
[1:49:11] why do you allow himself to be on
[1:49:13] Calvary
[1:49:15] I'm the reason
[1:49:16] if there's anybody to be mad that Jesus
[1:49:19] is on a cross I'm the reason
[1:49:22] he would have come and did it all
[1:49:26] if you was the only one on the earth he
[1:49:29] would have come and redeemed you he
[1:49:31] would have come and saved you he would
[1:49:32] have come and healed you

[1:54:39] Still Waters he restoreth my soul and he
[1:54:42] leadeth me in the past of righteousness
[1:54:44] for his name's sake and yea though I

[1:55:44] it has glue on the top
[1:55:46] and you can write them
[1:55:49] and it will stick
[1:55:51] not long but it will stick
[1:55:57] brother Brian said I saw a vision
[1:56:00] and he said write it down on the fly
[1:56:02] leaf of your Bible
[1:56:04] about a little boy in Finland
[1:56:08] two years later
[1:56:12] I told you the story last night
[1:56:15] and in case you don't know this brother
[1:56:16] Andrew Glover told the exact stories
[1:56:18] that I told last night
[1:56:23] you can go listen to it he told the same
[1:56:25] series of stories almost in the same
[1:56:28] order

[1:57:18] and so we figured out that he could come
[1:57:20] next week so he's coming well the reason
[1:57:23] he couldn't come is because your son and
[1:57:26] daughter-in-law

[1:58:58] and said get the people to write a list
[1:59:02] of their needs and put it on the Flyleaf

[2:00:16] expectation
[2:00:20] because we've told you things that
[2:00:22] that God spoke to us was going to happen

[2:00:27] we've did it over and over again you see
[2:00:29] there's people on that internet that's
