[0:00] Oh
[0:08] for
[0:11] [Music]
[0:20] [Music]
[0:22] blessed be the name of the Lord you say
[0:25] that your desire and then you can be
[0:27] seated for a moment Amen we just want to
[0:30] take the time to say what a privilege it
[0:34] is to be here amen to be part of these
[0:38] services for myself and my wife amen we
[0:42] certainly love the Spencer family and
[0:45] all they have meant to us down through
[0:48] the years and I think as time goes on we
[0:51] need to hold to those even tighter amen
[0:55] and I just thank the Lord for for
[0:58] brother Ron and his ministry and how
[1:01] it's helped me in many ways both seen
[1:04] and unseen and I have leaned on on his
[1:08] advice I know I know he has a big sense
[1:11] of humor and there's a lot of he's been
[1:13] called names he's been called a clown
[1:15] and everything else and he probably is
[1:16] but but he's just been a real friend to
[1:21] me and while I'm a clown too so I can
[1:24] say that clowns know each other right
[1:25] does that all right and so I just
[1:28] appreciate him and his family we love
[1:30] his extended family amen and and we love
[1:33] his church you're a wonderful group to
[1:35] preach to you make it amen half the work
[1:38] is sometimes that people have to move
[1:40] into the same channel in order for the
[1:42] word to go for so you're blessed here
[1:44] you're blessed with the minister you
[1:46] have you're blessed
[1:47] amen to be a part of this family and we
[1:50] just appreciate the privilege of being
[1:52] able to be here and I want to thank
[1:54] brother Ron for everything you've done
[1:55] for us brother we sure love you too amen
[1:58] and God is good to us amen and all that
[2:02] he's done and all that he says is doing
[2:05] and we know that He loves us and how do
[2:09] we know that he loves us the Prophet
[2:12] said because he said so that's all you
[2:15] need to know he said he loved you he's
[2:18] not taking it back he can't change his
[2:20] word he's the same yesterday today and
[2:22] forever
[2:23] he don't try to refigure out creation he
[2:25] already done it
[2:26] he already fought it and all it is is
[2:28] coming to fulfillment and we're a part
[2:30] that and we're so thankful to be a part
[2:33] of that now brother Matt told me that
[2:35] this was an eight-hour microphone or
[2:38] battery
[2:38] he said when it runs out just I have to
[2:40] turn the lights off so I whatever that
[2:42] meant we just try to figure it out but
[2:45] you know I had read this I had read this
[2:47] statement or this little story and I
[2:50] just wanted to say it to you before we
[2:52] get into the word and the scripture says
[2:55] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[2:58] I had read a story and of course it's
[3:01] just a story but to bring the point out
[3:02] it talked about a man that lived in a
[3:06] certain state - very shabby and poor
[3:10] rundown state in it and the house that
[3:13] he lived in was shabby and rundown the
[3:15] town he lived in was a depressed town
[3:17] and the place was in a strong economic
[3:21] depression overrun with poverty and
[3:24] needs and things weren't looking good
[3:26] but one day he was rummaging around in a
[3:30] pile of items that had been discarded
[3:31] from from the local flea market and
[3:34] things have been tossed aside nobody
[3:36] wanted any of them something caught his
[3:38] eye and what caught his eye was a vase
[3:41] that was there and and it was unbroken
[3:44] he could see he had been abused but it
[3:47] and suffered but it was unbroken and
[3:49] unmarked and it was beautiful it was and
[3:52] it was a beautiful constructed vase and
[3:55] so all the trashy surroundings made the
[3:58] contrast of that beauty stand out even
[3:59] more so he took it home and he placed it
[4:01] on the mantel that was in his home and
[4:04] he would sit in his dingy living room
[4:06] and he would look at that vase and and
[4:08] just stare at it and day after day he
[4:10] would he would just look upon this rare
[4:13] and beautiful thing that he'd brought
[4:15] into his home but one day is as he was
[4:18] looking at this vase he realized how
[4:22] cluttered his mantel was with other
[4:24] things and how stained the wall was with
[4:27] poverty so he cleaned the junk off the
[4:30] man own he put a fresh coat of paint
[4:32] upon the wall and just by doing that it
[4:35] caused the vase to stand out even more
[4:38] an even greater beauty than what it had
[4:41] been before because now the inn
[4:44] our wall took on the look of a beautiful
[4:46] painting and so it just brought him joy
[4:49] to see it one day as he entered into
[4:51] that living room he noticed how worn the
[4:53] carpet was and how tattered the
[4:55] furnishings were so he pulled the carpet
[4:57] out and he uncovered a beautiful
[4:58] hardwood floor and he he cleaned that he
[5:01] recovered the furnishings and he
[5:02] transformed the look of the entire room
[5:04] and that that being made him to begin to
[5:07] renovate his entire house once finished
[5:10] he he was delighted in how beautiful his
[5:14] house looked but it started somewhere it
[5:17] started when he brought this beautiful
[5:18] thing into his home and then he noticed
[5:22] the beauty of his house showed him how
[5:23] overrun his yard was and how cluttered
[5:25] up the yard was with weeds and junk and
[5:27] the fence was broken down and the
[5:29] outside of his home looked weathered and
[5:30] wasted so he set about making repairs
[5:34] and cleaning up the yard and soon his
[5:37] home became the talk of the neighborhood
[5:39] for it brought a sense of hope to those
[5:41] that lived around him
[5:42] before long the other homeowners begin
[5:44] to do the same thing they begin to clean
[5:47] up their homes and pretty soon the
[5:49] entire neighborhood was transformed and
[5:51] became the talk of the town and the town
[5:54] itself began to change clean the trash
[5:56] off the streets repaired the broken
[5:58] windows repainted faded homes
[6:00] refurbished Bennis businesses and
[6:03] rekindled dreams and soon the town
[6:05] became the garden spot of the whole
[6:07] entire state meanwhile the man said in
[6:10] his home and looked upon that rare and
[6:14] beautiful vase because his whole life
[6:18] had been transformed by the beauty of it
[6:20] I believe sometimes we don't realize the
[6:24] beauty and power of the message at God
[6:26] has brought to us that when we bring it
[6:30] into our homes it shouldn't leave our
[6:32] homes in the cluttered and trashy state
[6:34] with stained walls and broken-down
[6:36] furniture but amen the very the very
[6:40] beauty of the pearl of great price is a
[6:44] such transforming power that when you
[6:46] take it within yourself you can never
[6:49] remain the same again
[6:51] this message is not interested in just
[6:54] giving you an intellectual dialogue but
[6:57] this message is - about transforming you
[7:00] amen from one life to another life but
[7:03] it's not just about transforming you but
[7:06] want to transform you it begins to
[7:08] transform what's around you such as the
[7:11] power of this message that we have
[7:13] coming say man how many appreciate this
[7:17] message I do we thank God for what has
[7:21] come our way hallelujah and it just
[7:24] didn't come our way God sent it to us
[7:27] blessed be the name of the Lord Alleluia
[7:31] and if God sent us his message he sent
[7:35] us his message cause he has a work to do
[7:38] we have something to do and I just want
[7:41] to read this quote as we begin to start
[7:43] he said remember if God has a work for
[7:45] you to do all the demons out of torment
[7:48] cannot stop you you ever feel like
[7:53] you're gonna be stopped you ever feel
[7:55] like oh you just become discouraged and
[7:57] pull back well tell you there's not one
[8:00] devil in hell that can stop this bride
[8:03] from fulfilling the purpose God has
[8:06] placed her here for he said they can't
[8:09] startle you anyway God has got a purpose
[8:12] for the Holy Ghost Church and all the
[8:15] devil's of Hell will never be able to
[8:19] take it away God has got a purpose for
[8:22] and it'll never be destroyed until God
[8:25] lets it fulfill the purpose he's
[8:27] ordained it to do and it will I'm so
[8:31] thankful amen
[8:34] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[8:37] word can never pass away let's stand
[8:40] together amen I'll bless you this
[8:44] evening we appreciate amen this
[8:47] opportunity once again and we're looking
[8:48] for the Lord a man to move in a special
[8:50] way aren't you amen
[8:53] let's turn to the book of John the 10th
[8:55] chapter just going to read you two
[8:58] verses and I'll have you turn back to
[8:59] the book of Nehemiah chapter
[9:01] to
[9:20] jesus said in verse nine I am the door
[9:24] By Me If any man enter in he shall be
[9:29] saved and shall go in and out and find
[9:34] pasture there's only one door and that's
[9:41] Jesus Christ the thief cometh not but
[9:44] for to steal to kill and to destroy I am
[9:49] come that they might have life and that
[9:53] they might have it more abundantly why
[9:57] does he come so that we might have life
[10:00] and have it more abundantly
[10:04] praise the name of the Lord Nehemiah
[10:06] chapter 2 verse 9 is Nehemiah is coming
[10:11] across the rivers to the governors and
[10:13] he gives him the Kings letters it says I
[10:15] came to the governor's beyond the river
[10:17] and gave them the Kings letters now the
[10:20] King had sent captains of the army and
[10:23] horsemen with me and when sanballat the
[10:26] horror night and Tobiah the servant the
[10:27] ammonite heard of it it grieved them
[10:30] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[10:33] seek the welfare of the children of
[10:35] Israel you can be seated may the Lord
[10:37] bless the reading of his word
[10:39] I want to title this tonight is last
[10:42] night we spoke upon two men that you
[10:45] don't want in your congregation and we
[10:48] had a spoke about what these spirits
[10:52] would try to do in any church and that
[10:55] would be to block it and to hinder it
[10:58] and to try to cast doubt into weaken the
[11:00] church you know this is all Satan can do
[11:03] is he's a destroyer so what does he try
[11:06] to destroy he tries to destroy faith he
[11:09] tries to destroy hope he tries to
[11:12] destroy attention he tries to destroy
[11:15] health he's a destroyer amen and we and
[11:18] we can never amen look at him and
[11:23] underestimate our adversary but we know
[11:25] Amen with the Word of God it is totally
[11:28] exposed his moves so that the only
[11:30] way we can be deceived by him as if we
[11:33] choose to be deceived by him amen and so
[11:36] now I want to title this and from this
[11:41] tenth verse and I'll title this tonight
[11:43] a man has come to seek the welfare of
[11:49] the people
[11:51] a man has come to seek the welfare of
[11:56] his people how many believe that man is
[11:59] here tonight now as we speaking on these
[12:04] men Tobiah and sim ballot and thus
[12:08] Arabian by the name of GCM there is a
[12:11] number of things that we will pull out
[12:13] of of of what they tried to do to
[12:16] Nehemiah and the purpose that he had and
[12:19] being there and I and as I identified
[12:21] these things I identified three things
[12:23] that they were coming against the
[12:27] leadership with and number one was they
[12:29] mocked the calling that they were under
[12:32] and that's what the enemy will do to you
[12:35] is he will try to establish doubt in you
[12:38] of the purpose of you being there if he
[12:41] can get you to doubt your calling if he
[12:43] can get you to doubt amen
[12:45] the message that God has called you with
[12:48] because let's be honest
[12:49] amen we've been called under the message
[12:52] of the our brother BAM said he never
[12:54] called my name he never said Danny
[12:55] steamin but when the word was broken
[12:58] this generation it was the Eagle word
[13:00] calling to the Eagle children can you
[13:03] say man and it was God calling you
[13:05] listen I didn't hear my name but I heard
[13:07] the message amen and that message had a
[13:10] resonance it resonated down in my soul I
[13:13] may not have understood everything I
[13:15] heard but I knew Amen that what I heard
[13:17] was doing something to me amen and so
[13:21] what the enemy was coming in to do he
[13:22] was trying to say well you're here but
[13:24] you're not here for the reason you think
[13:26] you're here I mean the purpose that you
[13:29] haven't been here it's not going to work
[13:31] it's too devastated this there's too
[13:33] much rubble where you going to start so
[13:37] he began to try to get into to down is
[13:40] calling and if he can muddy up that in
[13:42] your life you will not
[13:44] have faith in the Word of God everything
[13:46] he's trying to do is to cause you to
[13:48] doubt the word that you hold the
[13:52] scripture says to make your calling and
[13:54] election sure that's your purpose you
[13:58] have to have that established so that
[14:00] the enemy cannot move you off your
[14:02] course you must know that the voice of
[14:06] God that you've heard the voice that has
[14:08] called us out of darkness into the
[14:11] glorious line of the gospel that voice
[14:14] Amen is the voice of God that we call
[14:18] the message of the hour let me tell you
[14:19] the voice of God is more than the voice
[14:22] of William Branham is that right I mean
[14:27] that's what he said amen he said he said
[14:30] it gets my better judgment I wanted to
[14:32] be a trapper he said it wasn't me that
[14:34] was there on that River he said I was
[14:36] just standing by when he come near
[14:38] that's the man that come was the Lord
[14:41] Jesus Christ amen and it was his voice
[14:43] it was God using the voice of man that
[14:47] to speak through him to our hearts I
[14:50] mean he said that voice came through
[14:53] Malachi 4 and you recognize the voice of
[14:57] God for your day no doubt man you've
[15:00] heard this quoted many times but it's
[15:02] something special to me in the message
[15:04] looking to the unseen as he's speaking
[15:06] there at the end and in and he's coming
[15:09] into the he's already had him up at the
[15:12] altar for prayer to give their life to
[15:15] God but now it's coming to the healing
[15:16] of the sick and all of a sudden as he's
[15:18] as he's asking them to come and so forth
[15:21] and then his voice changes and he begins
[15:23] to say is he pulsating to you then he
[15:26] says I'm the Lord that raised up Christ
[15:28] from the grave
[15:29] I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost I'm
[15:32] the one that gives the promise brother
[15:34] Branham has nothing to do in this he has
[15:37] surrendered his life to me I'm using his
[15:39] spirit I'm talking through his lips
[15:42] that's me I'm the Lord
[15:46] come on church you know not everybody
[15:48] would have caught that as they stood
[15:50] there but there are some that we're
[15:52] hearing it and they knew that the
[15:54] ministry was outside than regular norm
[15:57] and there is something different that
[15:59] was happening there let me tell you I
[16:01] mean that same one that used brother
[16:04] Branham at that moment in history
[16:06] to speak the word and the scripture
[16:08] would be fulfilled that man has never
[16:10] left the building and you say man
[16:14] brother Branham might have left the
[16:16] building but that man has never left the
[16:19] building
[16:21] hallelujah
[16:22] I hope it's all right for me to just say
[16:25] this a little bit as you mentioned my
[16:27] dad and and then just come upon my heart
[16:29] just to read this quote to you and once
[16:31] you understand we have a calling Satan
[16:34] is here tonight to make us doubt that
[16:36] calling so he can make you because if he
[16:39] can cast doubt upon what you believe
[16:41] amen you won't use it to fight the enemy
[16:44] is that right and then the prophet of
[16:46] God said in greatest battle ever fought
[16:48] he said if he can make you think that
[16:50] your weapon is equivalent hey man let me
[16:54] tell you the weapon we hold is more than
[16:57] equivalent it's more than an equivalent
[17:01] to cancer it's more than equivalent to
[17:05] crippled conditions it's more than
[17:07] equivalent to the sin question come on
[17:10] it's more equivalent than any powers of
[17:13] darkness that are even trying to come in
[17:15] this room tonight
[17:16] Amen this weapon we have Amen the spirit
[17:19] of the word of God is sharper Amen
[17:22] Daan's
[17:22] than any two-edged swords Amen and Satan
[17:27] were trying to cast doubt upon that
[17:29] calling I tell you but he can't take
[17:32] away from you what God placed inside of
[17:34] you but the random was asked the
[17:37] question in 1964 there's just a little
[17:41] bit of my testimony but he was asked a
[17:43] question by my grandmother in 1964 and
[17:46] you can find it in the in the series of
[17:48] question and answers that I have two
[17:49] daughters married to men and
[17:50] denominations they believe this message
[17:54] they've taken a stand for it and have
[17:56] received opposition what shall we do
[18:00] brother man just made a short statement
[18:03] in reply to this question immediately he
[18:06] says hold your stand absolutely show
[18:12] your colors that's it don't give in to
[18:15] them listen listen he said hold your
[18:18] stand show your colors absolutely don't
[18:22] give in to them you know somebody can be
[18:24] in a lifetime of misery gone through
[18:27] great pressure and here's a prophet just
[18:29] standing there answering this question
[18:31] just given a few words hold your stand
[18:33] show your colors absolutely he said now
[18:37] I don't say don't go among them and
[18:38] fellowship or something but as long as
[18:40] you can fellowship but when they come to
[18:43] changing the diet a dove can't eat with
[18:48] a buzzard so he's telling he says he's
[18:50] telling my mother basically you can go
[18:53] among them but don't let them change
[18:55] your diet don't let them change what
[19:01] you're feeding up on and hold your stand
[19:05] now it's easy to say it from the pulpit
[19:08] hold your stand but I mean you've got to
[19:09] go home and live with it you've got to
[19:12] get there under the presser and it
[19:14] becomes so hard
[19:15] amen you're not sure if it seems like
[19:17] your reason as being tore apart and
[19:19] you're like I don't know how I don't
[19:21] think I have the strength to stand oh
[19:23] don't tell me you haven't had those
[19:25] things come at you and if you haven't
[19:27] you will I want to drop in a verse Amen
[19:32] that that Daniel wrote down talking
[19:34] about the restoration alone you
[19:36] understand this is the same atmosphere
[19:38] when he said that the wall would be
[19:41] built in trouble as times and that word
[19:46] trouble is one of a mental and spiritual
[19:48] anguish that'd be such a great anguish
[19:50] in such a troubled time of troubled
[19:53] minds amen but a word from God let me
[19:57] tell you one word from God
[19:59] Amen is enough to change the system that
[20:03] changed the whole life pattern that
[20:05] changed the whole situation in a
[20:07] moment's time that's why we cannot take
[20:09] a service like this in East any weekend
[20:12] for granted amen because Satan to try to
[20:16] try the desire out of your life a mean
[20:18] that you will even come and fellowship
[20:20] Amen but the word says Amen even so much
[20:23] the more as we see the Day approaching
[20:25] why don't let the devil change your diet
[20:30] [Applause]
[20:38] hey you know the devil's come to me Matt
[20:41] and many times and doubted my experience
[20:43] with God I won't tell you why the devil
[20:46] doubts your experience you want me tell
[20:47] you why the devil doubts your experience
[20:49] how many's ever had their experience
[20:50] doubted my rescue I'm really curious why
[20:53] you're not raising your hand oh let me
[20:57] ask you another friend says the devil
[20:58] ever talk to you I don't know I mean
[21:00] mm-hmm my wife does and that's not what
[21:02] I asked
[21:05] it's not the devil or his sister amen
[21:09] amen you know some people that mister
[21:13] become so so relaxed that they don't
[21:16] even pay attention to the things going
[21:18] around them but the enemy coming your
[21:20] doubt your experience until you know you
[21:22] don't have an experience you know but
[21:25] there's anchors that God has placed in
[21:26] your life a meaning that you look back
[21:29] and you see all that the devil was
[21:31] trying to do they're trying to drive us
[21:33] away from this message of the hour
[21:34] that's why he's questioned it the way he
[21:37] is because he knows this life-changing
[21:39] experience let me tell you this message
[21:42] is not an organization it's not a place
[21:45] that prints books Amen this message is
[21:47] the promise of God that he promised in
[21:50] this hire I will restore my word amen
[21:53] Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelations 10 7
[21:58] God said I will restore saith the Lord
[22:04] this isn't the mind of man this is the
[22:07] mind of God it may not mean much to you
[22:13] but this is part of my testimony this
[22:15] very quote here is a prophet a prophet
[22:17] of God answering my grandmother my
[22:21] mother was under opposition from my dad
[22:23] and I could remember she would take me
[22:26] to house meetings as a child and my dad
[22:29] would take me to his church and I would
[22:31] hear my daddy tell me don't believe what
[22:33] your mother believes but you know even
[22:37] before I was born there was a word from
[22:40] a prophet hold your stand
[22:45] what was it
[22:47] Satan was trying to get him to doubt
[22:49] their calling my mother told me one time
[22:55] she said the the pressure got so severe
[22:58] cuz my dad would kick her out of the
[22:59] home throw her her clothes out of the
[23:01] home tell her to get back to her parents
[23:03] and all of these things and he was
[23:05] trying to crush what God was doing in
[23:08] her life
[23:09] hey man and she would go back home and
[23:12] and and and she told me said sometimes I
[23:14] just have to talk to my grandmother
[23:16] excuse me her mother my grandmother and
[23:18] say mom are you sure are you sure this
[23:23] message is the truth you know your mind
[23:25] might say what was she doubting the
[23:27] message let me tell you you can get
[23:28] under so much pressure the enemy comes
[23:30] down upon you enemy against even as
[23:33] brother branham got under pressure and
[23:34] begin to open his mouth say then I'll no
[23:35] longer serve God maybe we can get under
[23:37] so much pressure that our mind begins to
[23:40] doubt do I have what's real is this
[23:43] really the truth is this message really
[23:45] the truth or is it just another charge
[23:47] is it just another man and my
[23:49] grandmother would say you know where
[23:50] could we go what else is the truth that
[23:52] has to be you might think that's nothing
[23:58] you know well that's just people having
[24:00] a conversation but when it means your
[24:02] family when it means your children we
[24:04] didn't mean same you may lose them for
[24:06] the rest of your life you're deadly
[24:08] sincere when you come into that moment
[24:12] my family's all from the north they're
[24:15] from Ohio I was born in Florida there's
[24:16] a reason I was born in Florida I was
[24:18] born there because my dad was trying to
[24:20] get my mother out of the message so I'm
[24:24] a Floridian by the predestinated mercy
[24:26] of God and it's nothing that's there's
[24:28] nothing political you do everything in
[24:35] his power to take this out of my mother
[24:40] and but brother Bantam said hold fast
[24:45] it might have just been a simple answer
[24:47] as a man to see maybe his attention
[24:49] wasn't fully on the question
[24:51] hold fast show your colors I can
[24:55] remember how my dad treated my mother
[24:57] and that day came after 10 years of this
[25:01] persecution that day came when she
[25:03] wanted to go to her brother's baptism
[25:05] and and asked my daddy said can I go to
[25:07] my brother's baptism he said if you go
[25:09] when I get back he said I'm gone and the
[25:11] kids are going with me I'm finished with
[25:13] it so he threatened her with losing her
[25:16] entire family my mother made the choice
[25:19] in that moment
[25:20] I'm gonna go anyhow you know she came
[25:24] and she came willing that her family
[25:26] wasn't gonna stop her from going on with
[25:27] God even if it was children of her own
[25:30] womb she was going to make a choice to
[25:32] stand with Jesus I want to tell you when
[25:34] a man comes to seek your welfare he's
[25:36] not going to stand by with folded arms
[25:38] and watch you crash and burn him in but
[25:41] he will put you through a test to see do
[25:43] you really believe amen Abraham if you
[25:45] really believe me go take Isaac up on
[25:47] that mountain and sacrifice him a man he
[25:50] knew what they meant abraham believed
[25:52] but he wanted abraham to see what he
[25:53] believed he wanted abraham to know that
[25:57] our God is Jehovah Jireh he's not just a
[26:02] message we heard about he's a God Amen
[26:05] that provides in the moments blessed be
[26:11] the name of the Lord you want to try to
[26:13] tell me this message isn't the truth you
[26:16] want to come along and question all say
[26:18] no brother Adam he was a false prophet
[26:19] his mess untrue Wow all I can tell you
[26:21] is what I was called under and all I can
[26:25] tell you what it is produced in my
[26:26] family and all I can tell you
[26:29] Amen when my dad made that debt that
[26:31] altar made him with my mother my mother
[26:33] said I want to go anyhow there was
[26:34] another man stepped in the room right at
[26:36] that moment and that was that unseen
[26:38] presence Amen and my mother came in by
[26:41] making that stand hold fast and show
[26:43] your colors
[26:44] it brought God upon the scene and my
[26:47] daddy turned around and said I'll take
[26:49] you and was
[26:50] baptized a week later let me tell you
[26:55] tonight there's a man that has come to
[26:58] seek your welfare he is here to
[27:01] accomplish the word that he has promised
[27:04] in your life hey man brother John he
[27:09] knows your life he knows your life and I
[27:14] am come that you might have life and you
[27:17] might have him more abundantly
[27:24] let me tell you brother Ron amen my
[27:27] daddy thought he can break our family up
[27:29] and God said amen you've already lost
[27:32] this battle
[27:33] not only will I change your life you're
[27:35] gonna preach this message for me you
[27:42] don't think I didn't have an effect on
[27:44] me and you want to come and tell me this
[27:47] message is just men's ideas who was it
[27:51] that came down who was it that came down
[27:54] and backed up the word of a prophet
[27:57] hold fast show your colors don't go
[28:00] change your diet you see that Satan
[28:02] questioning your calling God said make
[28:07] it sure know who called you
[28:11] oh let me tell you I wasn't called by
[28:15] brother Ron I wasn't called by any other
[28:18] man though God could use the agency of
[28:21] man to preach the gospel and the
[28:23] foolishness of preaching to send the
[28:26] world out but God amen before the
[28:29] foundation of the world place something
[28:31] inside of me that would only respond
[28:34] back to a certain sound hey I said in
[28:39] many of mennonite service and it never
[28:41] did one thing for me then and it doesn't
[28:43] do anything for me now but I'll tell you
[28:46] what under the sound aiming of the
[28:48] original diet it
[28:50] shopping for me
[28:56] you might say brother Danny I'm in need
[28:59] of restoration tonight well let me just
[29:01] tell you something get back to the
[29:03] original diet sure
[29:18] Satan's alive let me just let me just
[29:22] put a little word in your mouth
[29:23] hey man you may be beat down at the
[29:25] lowest level right now learn to say this
[29:27] Satan you're a liar you know I read my
[29:31] Bible and you're pointing at your ear
[29:33] brother Danny might know but you know we
[29:34] do things weird in Florida I read my
[29:36] Bible and I heard what Abraham did when
[29:40] he met Melchizedek will Melchizedek said
[29:43] blessed be the god possessor of heaven
[29:45] and earth amen Abraham turned right
[29:47] around and addressed the king of Sodom
[29:48] and talked exactly like Melchizedek did
[29:51] you know why the message came to you so
[29:54] God gave you a word that would defeat
[29:56] the devil any place anywhere any
[30:00] condition God can restore what you
[30:07] cannot what you call impossible God
[30:14] already knows the way
[30:17] you may have come to a dead end but it's
[30:20] just another Red Sea blessed be the name
[30:27] of the Lord so we see these men these
[30:43] brothers we don't want in our church
[30:44] mock they're calling again we see him in
[30:46] Chapter four they mocked their work
[30:50] first they mock their calling but then
[30:52] they didn't pay attention to him then as
[30:53] they saw them work they mock what they
[30:56] did and said it's week even a fox goes
[31:00] up and here knocked that wall down what
[31:04] they gonna do revive these stones in the
[31:05] day let me tell you there was something
[31:08] supernatural about Nehemiah building
[31:10] this wall it laid there for generations
[31:13] beaten down broken burned but in 52 days
[31:22] whether that in my life is such a mess
[31:24] I've tried it it don't work here yeah
[31:26] but you didn't bring the right man in
[31:30] you tried to do it but when the man who
[31:32] has come to seek your welfare comes in
[31:34] amen in 52 days time the entire wall was
[31:38] built back again that was a supernatural
[31:41] occurrence but God was using man to
[31:44] bring the restoration into vision oh
[31:54] they mocked their building they mocked
[31:56] their work called the Jews feeble oh you
[32:01] hear brother Rob preaches he just tries
[32:03] to work him up and they talk about the
[32:05] gift of God and they hit me you know
[32:06] what's what's that we're way past that
[32:11] yeah the problem of it is you haven't
[32:13] lived in that home you haven't walked in
[32:16] those shoes you don't know the
[32:19] circumstance behind that person's life
[32:21] you might just call this church a shout
[32:24] in church and call me a fighting dog I
[32:26] have right to be offended
[32:29] first I can be offended at my mother she
[32:31] was going to give me up I can be
[32:32] offended at Ron because he called me a
[32:34] fighting dog what in the world am I
[32:35] doing here I'll tell you what I'm doing
[32:37] here for Amy because it taught me a
[32:39] lesson that if you give your heart to
[32:40] God and you give yourself wholly to him
[32:43] you brought all of heaven behind you to
[32:45] back you up you're not just fighting
[32:48] this by yourself now trying to figure
[32:51] out is this right can I survive no but a
[32:53] man has come in a man that is your your
[32:56] welfare is his work can I say it again
[33:03] your welfare is his work
[33:07] blessed be that's why God asked men like
[33:14] brother Ron and he's got preachers like
[33:16] brother Andrew brother Matthew and
[33:18] brother Amen William and all those that
[33:20] are caught because God will use
[33:22] something that looks feeble we could
[33:29] destroy that work just a little fox go
[33:31] up and knock the wall down but if God
[33:32] built it a gates of Hell will not
[33:37] prevail so if God if Satan can't cause
[33:46] you to doubt your purpose here cause you
[33:49] to doubt your work in other words you're
[33:53] not a very good Christian you know this
[33:57] not only affected their work when he
[33:59] began to say that how weak it was the
[34:01] Bible says they it weakened their
[34:03] families in chapter 3 deals with the
[34:08] manner in which Israel would rebuild
[34:11] their walls and it would be the wall by
[34:16] their house the wall that was to be
[34:21] built was the wall by their house the
[34:27] wall would be revealed be rebuilt family
[34:31] by family and remember the message that
[34:37] Nehemiah has hid in his heart the burden
[34:41] of God is
[34:41] one of restoration he saw the mess Bible
[34:47] says in chapter 2 that he went out by
[34:49] night and no man saw him do it
[34:50] and he went and he saw how broken down
[34:55] it was and he never came back and
[34:56] preached the message on why I'm going to
[34:58] go back to the Babylon because his
[35:00] message is too hard he never looked at
[35:08] all the rubble of broken lives and said
[35:10] this is too hard but he went back and
[35:14] spoke to Israel and said the hand of God
[35:17] is upon me to do this work you see what
[35:22] God had to do was to get him to look
[35:23] away from the rubble first and to look
[35:27] at the purpose of God so they could deal
[35:29] with the rubble because if the hand of
[35:32] God comes upon you your turn and look at
[35:35] the ruin with inspiration instead of
[35:38] discouragement the reason some of you
[35:42] aren't getting anywhere in your life is
[35:44] because you're trying to operate under
[35:45] the Word of God through discouragement
[35:47] it'll never work remember you get up
[35:53] every morning say I can do all things
[35:55] through Christ who strengtheneth me and
[36:03] when Satan came in to doubt their
[36:07] purpose how didn't Nehemiah fight it you
[36:17] see Satan's fighting me tonight that's
[36:23] all he can try to do but what did
[36:26] Nehemiah do he turned their words of
[36:30] these doubters into prayers like arrows
[36:36] amen and again Nehemiah knows that Satan
[36:40] is trying to weaken the people through
[36:41] doubt or through the work of God so he
[36:43] told the people that were ever he blew
[36:46] the tree
[36:47] but this was the place of focus wherever
[36:51] the word is being preached at that
[36:53] moment it is the place of importance
[36:58] whether it be over by this family or by
[37:01] that family over there or that family in
[37:03] the back of the family in the front
[37:04] wherever the trumpets being blown don't
[37:06] get turned off by the sound of the
[37:08] trumpet that's where we're supposed to
[37:11] rally in fight don't sit there and say
[37:14] the preachers preaching on me again
[37:16] no the trumpet is blowing by your law
[37:18] because the enemy is there it might make
[37:26] some people uncomfortable when the
[37:28] trumpets blown by the wall but if you
[37:31] realize that this is the threat of the
[37:33] enemy that's causing the trumpet to be
[37:35] blown whether it's the subject of
[37:37] holiness where there's doctrinal issues
[37:43] whether its family issues whether it's
[37:47] marital issues whether it's personal
[37:50] issues you must realize the trumpet is
[37:53] blowing for your good don't get offended
[37:57] by the blowing of the trumpet this is
[37:59] restoration you only look at rebuke but
[38:02] this is a restoration so Nehemiah I
[38:09] encourage the people to be more vigilant
[38:11] on the walls notice now how he has them
[38:14] work he made sure that when they went to
[38:16] work they carried a weapon one hand
[38:18] worked and the other held a weapon
[38:23] daniel said the wall would be built in
[38:25] trouble as times 52 days under extreme
[38:29] pressure they built the wall trouble
[38:30] astons that word troubles me angry Sh
[38:33] pressure if you go study that word it
[38:36] means that pushed into a tight place
[38:40] Paul called it perilous times because
[38:44] it's average the time of restoration so
[38:49] amen so he made them work with a weapon
[38:53] in their hand and I want to tell you
[38:57] this that's our answer for the
[39:00] pressure of this day if you can't work
[39:02] and hold your weapon you better review
[39:07] your consecration to God
[39:13] here's another tactic there's three
[39:15] tactics cause they Madonna's calling
[39:18] calls him to doubt his purpose and then
[39:20] the other tactic was he tried to
[39:22] undermine his position by sending out an
[39:26] open letter and making false accusations
[39:28] against him amen and then by trying to
[39:32] tell him that there's a threat upon your
[39:34] life and let me tell you there wasn't
[39:36] only true prophets prophesied in that
[39:39] hour but the Bible tells us in Malachi
[39:41] there was false prophets also
[39:42] prophesying
[39:44] that's the age we live in it's a mix of
[39:46] voices so you understand when the
[39:48] restoration was coming I mean there was
[39:50] true voices like amen like Ezra had with
[39:53] Haggai and Zechariah like Nehemiah had
[39:56] with Malachi but there was also false
[39:58] voices and they're all prophesying
[40:00] they're all preaching they're all saying
[40:02] things and in the people of Judah and
[40:04] Israel they're being pulled both ways
[40:05] what are we going to do and the reason
[40:07] was it of it was because God was coming
[40:09] to restore and he wasn't just building a
[40:12] wall he was purging the people and
[40:13] putting him in the rightful positions so
[40:16] they could come back to true worship God
[40:23] doesn't want you just to jump and shout
[40:25] and hide a house full of rubble he wants
[40:34] you to jump and shout that when you land
[40:36] back down you're not going to land upon
[40:37] a brick or something that's laying in
[40:39] your way and break your foot that's why
[40:44] so many people are up and down they
[40:45] still got rubble so they try to draw you
[40:50] away from your purpose and that's what
[40:52] they did with me and mine
[40:53] come meet us come they kept trying to
[40:55] get him into a meeting oh it's real
[40:56] important you come have a meeting but he
[40:59] had come with the letters from the king
[41:00] he wasn't there to meet with them he was
[41:03] there to meet with the people that God
[41:04] wanted to restore
[41:09] tried to draw him away just like Satan
[41:13] tries to draw you away and they tried to
[41:15] elevate their importance to him and to
[41:18] engage him with the problem at hand that
[41:21] they themselves are stirring up and
[41:23] occupy your time let me just say this I
[41:27] trust this is all right don't get beyond
[41:30] my voice here all right if for some
[41:37] reason what you are doing is now more
[41:41] important to you than the message you've
[41:45] been listened you've been listening to
[41:47] the wrong voice and you've been draw it
[41:50] out where were they trying to draw a man
[41:53] trying to draw me am I out - the Bible
[41:55] says the plains of Oh No maybe that's
[41:58] where a lot of people get in trouble oh
[41:59] no out there no no that was just a
[42:02] southern take on it what is happening to
[42:06] Israel when they begin to listen to
[42:08] those voices they weaken their hands
[42:12] that's not referring to your literal
[42:14] strength that's referring to your
[42:17] conviction we live in trouble as times
[42:25] what the Bible tells us in spite of all
[42:28] of that
[42:29] 52 days the wall is built you know why a
[42:34] man had come to seek the welfare of his
[42:41] people brother Branham said in in in the
[42:45] message God of his evil age what would
[42:47] God call a people out of this evil age
[42:49] for what would he call them out for his
[42:52] name for he said the reason is is to try
[42:56] her the purpose of the evil age is to
[43:01] try her when she has been tried and been
[43:06] proven and proved to Satan you say God
[43:10] will use me to prove a point to Satan
[43:16] he will do that he said like it was at
[43:19] the beginning so shall it be at the end
[43:22] and he goes on to say we find this evil
[43:25] Aegis to prove to Satan that this woman
[43:27] is not like Eve she's not that type of
[43:30] woman should be tried by the word and as
[43:33] Adam's bride believed every bit of the
[43:35] word but confused on one promise he's
[43:37] the same yesterday today and forever
[43:39] today see she failed under that
[43:41] temptation of the enemy face-to-face and
[43:44] now the people that's called for his
[43:46] name of course is his bride and she
[43:49] comes in contact again by the same thing
[43:52] not just denominational truth but every
[43:57] word so God is not just trying you to
[44:01] say yeah I came out of the Baptists are
[44:03] no longer Baptists I've been tried and
[44:04] proven no every word he's trying her by
[44:07] to see that she'll be faithful to stand
[44:10] there and this work is completed I had
[44:15] had a woman come to my church one time
[44:19] and she was reading the tracts that I
[44:23] had in the back and one of them was on
[44:26] the original sin and she was reading it
[44:30] and she got so angry and she jumped up
[44:32] and ran out of her Church and
[44:34] disappeared off the grounds where the
[44:36] ron's been there but the Matthews been
[44:38] there you know we're out in the country
[44:40] so we didn't know where she disappeared
[44:43] to so we had the Deacons going up and
[44:46] down the road trying to find her and I
[44:47] couldn't find her and I hadn't seen
[44:48] there was a lane across the highway it
[44:51] it said no trespassing I said a
[44:53] she's up there and so I went up the lane
[44:56] there's a house up there and she's
[44:57] sitting on the porch of the house and
[44:58] she is steaming mad not steaming mad
[45:00] steaming mad and she's up there and and
[45:05] and I come up to her said I said ma'am
[45:07] first I start calling her sister he's
[45:09] trying to beat your sister why don't we
[45:10] come you know this is private property
[45:11] we're not supposed to be here let's go
[45:13] back let's talk about whatever has made
[45:14] you some man and she goes you know
[45:16] somebody's got to do something about
[45:17] your church and what you believe I said
[45:19] well sister let's go talk about don't
[45:20] call me sister I said well ma'am let's
[45:22] go let's talk about but this we're not
[45:24] supposed to be here
[45:25] she was all right so we come back inside
[45:27] of the church inside of it and she said

[45:36] show them their blindness they're in a
[45:40] court set him free

[45:50] message like you did I said in fact he
[45:54] said if William branham's in heaven I
[45:57] don't want to go now not to me that's a
[46:00] stupid statement I don't care if every
[46:04] lineage of the Pope is in heaven I want
[46:05] to be there amen because something
[46:09] happened to him amen and so many but he
[46:11] didn't have that revelation as a
[46:12] Mennonite I reckon but he said if
[46:14] William Brennan was in heaven I don't
[46:16] want to be there and I told this one I
[46:17] said that's what he said she goes bless
[46:19] his heart I said you see that church
[46:23] right there and she goes yes and that my
[46:25] dad built that so I got hope for you
[46:28] that even in your anger a mean that God
[46:31] can be merciful I said let's go talk

[46:36] problem was she had hair up to here she

[47:15] told me at brother Ron's thank you so we
[47:23] sat down and we begin to talk well she
[47:25] didn't want to discuss the Bible she
[47:27] wanted to talk out of men's books that
[47:29] have written about the Bible she started
[47:33] off with all kinds of words that you
[47:35] know only a few sets of people
[47:37] understand I you know I understood him
[47:40] halfway you know what I mean they did
[47:43] too trying to throw you with their
[47:46] intellectualism
[47:48] and I said man that word that you're
[47:50] saying I didn't find that one in the
[47:52] Bible and so amen so she she kept
[47:58] quoting all these books and I just kept
[48:00] quoting the scripture that's all I did
[48:02] quote scripture watch her reaction she
[48:05] kept quoting these books I said that's
[48:07] not in the Bible and I quote the Bible
[48:08] she quote another thing I said that's
[48:10] not in the Bible when I quote the Bible
[48:11] she got angry again couldn't help it I
[48:14] made her mad she jumped out of her seat
[48:16] and she said I know where you're getting
[48:18] that I said where am I getting that she
[48:23] goes you're getting that from william
[48:24] branham I said ma'am
[48:26] you didn't want me to call your sister
[48:28] so I call you ma'am I said you've just
[48:30] paid in the greatest compliment I said
[48:35] because from the time we began to talk
[48:37] you quoted other men's books I've done
[48:39] nothing but quote the scripture to you I
[48:42] want you to know brother and sister but
[48:44] we were caught under we were caught
[48:46] under the message of the hour
[48:49] you got a word birth you got a word
[48:51] calling you got a word purpose
[48:54] [Applause]
[48:57] yeah
[48:58] [Applause]
[49:04] hallelujah I wasn't caught under some
[49:08] man's college I was called up what is
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:19] better just slow down and be teacher Lee
[49:25] I've never done this before
[49:32] all the sisters are jealous I'm a tease
[49:38] well I'm a preaching like this I want to
[49:40] just say this when they came back for
[49:44] restoration God never brought the best
[49:47] people he bought was best for him he
[49:53] didn't bring the most qualified he
[49:56] brought those that were elected and
[49:58] those that were elected came out as
[50:01] weary captives no song no energy no
[50:07] conviction they just they were just
[50:09] happy to to come back to a place that
[50:11] was ruined and to live in it and they
[50:15] settled for a ruined desert a place that
[50:20] had a glorious past but I want you to
[50:22] know our God isn't just about the past
[50:25] [Applause]
[50:27] when he said a man has come he didn't
[50:30] say a man did come he said a man has
[50:32] come amen to seek the welfare of the
[50:38] captives of the desolate misty works
[50:44] whatever is in it give the recipe to my
[50:46] wife it's a group that's used to
[50:53] captivity some of you might be sitting
[50:55] here tonight use to your situation used
[51:00] to what you're setting in and your life
[51:05] becomes adjusted to the condition
[51:11] but that is never the purpose of God to
[51:15] adjust lives to what has been destroyed
[51:24] when God comes he said I'm gonna do
[51:27] something in this restoration that is
[51:30] going to be glorious before the whole
[51:32] world and the world may not recognize
[51:33] what it is but it's going to be there
[51:35] because my expression is Jerusalem
[51:37] remember brother Branham said in the
[51:39] church age book and he talked about in
[51:41] and in I believe it right at the end of
[51:43] the resume of the ages or the layout
[51:45] have seen one of those he says he talks
[51:47] about the heavenly Jerusalem he said
[51:49] every facet of her beauty tells a story
[51:53] of Amazing Grace that means that these
[51:59] were living stones that the enemy had
[52:02] said one time what are these feeble Jews
[52:04] going to revive these stones again that
[52:09] means stones had a testimony to tell
[52:12] they had a work to do in your life when
[52:16] it's out of place you may just feel like
[52:18] I'm just rolling along with no purpose
[52:20] in life I come to church I have a desire
[52:22] I want to be right but you just don't
[52:24] have no energy a mentor to be able to
[52:26] perform what God has called you to do
[52:29] that's what this message is to come to
[52:33] set your life in order to come to
[52:40] restore what you lost hope for there is
[52:48] not a person in this building that the
[52:51] Holy Spirit has looked at and shook its
[52:53] head and said it's too hard you might
[52:56] have shook your head many a night and
[52:58] said it's too hard but the Holy Spirit
[53:00] never hovered over that home and looked
[53:02] at you and said I can't do that neither
[53:05] did he go into a dark place and says
[53:07] it's too dark neither did he go into the
[53:10] most impure place and say I can't fix it
[53:14] but the call of restoration is as
[53:17] brother venom said and restoration or
[53:19] riot tree no matter how low no matter
[53:21] how impure no matter what the condition
[53:24] is amen the call of the Holy Spirit is
[53:26] to give it back that's what we're here
[53:29] tonight to say is that Satan if the Holy
[53:32] Spirit says give it back
[53:34] Satan can not stop what the Holy Spirit
[53:36] is giving then what is my job to do
[53:42] under that inspiration my job is to
[53:44] raise my hand and say yes Lord I agree
[53:48] with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[53:53] [Applause]
[54:00] you might be somebody that's weary in
[54:03] captivity and doesn't have a mind to
[54:05] build you might be somebody who's easily
[54:08] overcome by perceived threats one of the
[54:11] greatest pressure of this age is nerves
[54:13] I know what it's like I know what it's
[54:18] like to have your nerves come to a
[54:19] situation where it feels like it's going
[54:22] to break I thank the Lord for for
[54:24] somebody like my wife who could stand
[54:27] there in between me and situations and I
[54:30] think the Lord for ministries that was
[54:31] sensitive to the Holy Spirit to call me
[54:33] up and tell me what the Holy Spirit told
[54:35] them because I know what it's like to be
[54:39] embarrassed and to be there with your
[54:41] nerves at a breaking point and you don't
[54:42] want to face the people and any effort
[54:44] you put out you feel like you're going
[54:46] to to to bring up and everything else
[54:49] and no strength and a fear that anything
[54:52] I do I'm just gonna break down God is
[54:55] still God
[54:57] he's got to work for you to do even
[54:59] through your weakness here come and make
[55:01] that weakness glorify the word of God
[55:06] he's all right there just a brief time
[55:09] in in not in 2016 and I was under attack
[55:12] by a spirit and I didn't know what it
[55:14] was and I was embarrassed Here I am as a
[55:16] preacher prep pastor in the church and
[55:18] I'm supposed to be the strong one and I
[55:19] was the weak one I was embarrassed and
[55:24] it was a stretch of two weeks I'd come
[55:26] off a lot of meetings and been overseas
[55:28] and my body was tired and was dealing
[55:30] with situations at home church for some
[55:32] reason home churches have problems I
[55:35] know this isn't a home church I'm it's a
[55:37] visiting Church I'm visiting it when
[55:41] brother Rahm preaches it's a home church
[55:47] something would come in my room every
[55:50] morning around four o'clock in the
[55:53] morning and it wasn't a good spirit it
[55:56] was an evil spirit and it would try to
[55:59] it would stand there it was so real to
[56:02] me that I would try to see it and my
[56:04] nerves was at a breaking point my wife
[56:07] had this ask somebody she knew not even
[56:09] a believer now this will blow your mind
[56:11] if you got one it's a Catholic woman she
[56:18] was acquainted with never been never
[56:20] been to Florida or where we live never
[56:22] been in her church obviously we don't do
[56:24] Hail Marys there have mass when she
[56:29] rotors and if you believe in prayer pray
[56:30] for my husband he's gone through some
[56:32] things and that woman wrote back and she
[56:35] described our church described where
[56:37] people sat in the church and then told
[56:41] how I've said in here probably your
[56:43] husband's problem is he's got some
[56:45] witches in the church he's got more than
[56:49] one that's all I need
[56:52] witches you know we fight a real enemy
[57:02] got enemies here tonight and I told my
[57:07] wife I told her then I said well she's a
[57:09] Catholic and she's gonna say things like
[57:12] that I know know what the scripture says
[57:13] that the sin of rebellion is as
[57:16] witchcraft we were going through things
[57:19] in our church and weed went away for a
[57:20] few days as resting as it was coming
[57:23] home brother Ron called me he said I can
[57:25] tell you right where I was at on my more
[57:28] as I was mowing he said the Holy Spirit
[57:31] told me says call Danny and tell him
[57:34] he's been attacked by a spirit of
[57:35] witchcraft so I had a Catholic tell me I
[57:39] had witches I had a message friend and
[57:43] minister tell me I was attacked by my
[57:46] spirit of witchcraft you know I'll tell
[57:50] you in that moment all my embarrassment
[57:52] left and all my fear left because I knew
[57:57] then when I was being attacked by I
[58:00] wasn't healed but the fear was gone I
[58:03] can't describe it to you because you
[58:07] have to be in it to understand it but I
[58:10] was in it and the Lord through that
[58:13] unveiling exposing that spirit so you
[58:16] have to bring him to light when he
[58:17] exposed that spirit it gave me the mind
[58:20] of God to understand what I was facing
[58:22] and then to know when God was telling me
[58:24] how to deal with it and what he told me
[58:27] to deal with it said don't do anything
[58:28] and I did nothing for a couple months
[58:30] with him when he told me I want you to
[58:32] preach this and I preached it on my
[58:34] birthday which is Christmas and yes I
[58:36] was born on Christmas not Jesus thank
[58:39] you for all the clapping not the
[58:49] decorations
[58:52] because I know they're not for me so I
[58:55] preached it on my birthday and I
[58:58] preached what the Lord had laid on my
[58:59] heart and it drove the spirit out of the
[59:03] church so the Lord had given me the
[59:07] wisdom by using brothers like brother
[59:10] Ron I appreciate you brother Ron and and
[59:13] it gave me that needed strength I wasn't
[59:15] healed but I was delivered of that fear
[59:19] and about eight months later I'm in
[59:26] overseas in Romania or the William right
[59:29] close to where your family comes from at
[59:32] a youth camp and it got really hot it
[59:35] was a about a hundred and two everyday
[59:37] and the meeting was is an outdoor format
[59:40] it had a roof over but the back was open
[59:42] so it was always really hot and where we
[59:44] slept we we only had a fan just moved
[59:47] the hot air around so you could sleep
[59:48] but not rest and so your body starts
[59:50] getting really tired and and I felt that
[59:53] thing come back I preached Thursday
[59:54] night Friday morning Friday night
[59:57] Saturday morning and Saturday night I
[59:59] was going to continue on the same
[1:00:00] thought and between services that fear
[1:00:03] came back and I felt it come back and I
[1:00:07] felt like I was going to preach the
[1:00:09] second part of that morning service all
[1:00:11] inspiration left me all I had was fear
[1:00:14] and I'm literally walking to the pulpit
[1:00:18] praying to the Lord you have to help me
[1:00:21] I said I don't feel no inspiration I
[1:00:25] feel that fear coming back and I can't
[1:00:28] operate under that you have to help me I
[1:00:31] got up and preached I preached the
[1:00:34] subject that I was I was intending to
[1:00:37] preach on and the Lord got in it and he
[1:00:40] helped the people and they responded I
[1:00:41] didn't feel anything in myself but I was
[1:00:44] able to preach it but then at the end of
[1:00:47] the service
[1:00:48] there was a minister sitting on the
[1:00:50] front row he came up and he spoke to the
[1:00:52] other ministers and he told them
[1:00:54] something I'm the only one that knew
[1:00:56] what I prayed and he told him he said
[1:00:59] the entire time I preached there was a
[1:01:02] man that stood behind me and
[1:01:03] my arms while I preached I'm the only
[1:01:06] one that knew what I prayed for now
[1:01:08] you're gonna say well brother Danny
[1:01:09] we're way beyond the supernatural that
[1:01:11] don't mean anything to me I know it
[1:01:13] might not mean anything to you but I
[1:01:15] know what I prayed and I know the moment
[1:01:18] that I got healed because it was in that
[1:01:22] moment that God healed me you know why
[1:01:24] hey man he said I am come that you might
[1:01:27] have life and that you might have it
[1:01:29] more abundantly
[1:01:31] amen your fear will not stop the healing
[1:01:33] Amen but you got to look to him and
[1:01:36] understand that if you were in the
[1:01:38] middle of that fear look to that man for
[1:01:40] help
[1:01:41] he said I'm a present help in the time
[1:01:44] of trouble I'm not a guy that just got
[1:01:47] you in I'm a guy that'll get you out
[1:01:53] that should be the name
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:02:08] so I think the Lord and I used to be a
[1:02:12] person that was a little shy about
[1:02:13] testifying about those things but I
[1:02:15] understand if I testified about it it
[1:02:17] would also talk to somebody else I was
[1:02:19] in the exact same position and they
[1:02:21] would begin to realize if God did it for
[1:02:22] that boy he'll do it for me and I want
[1:02:25] you to know he's the same yesterday
[1:02:27] today and forever here do it for any
[1:02:31] condition if it was me hey let me tell
[1:02:41] you something if God will hold my arms
[1:02:43] up here hold your arms up if God will
[1:02:46] stand behind me he'll stand behind you
[1:02:49] but he wants you to know are you gonna
[1:02:51] continue on even when the devil says you
[1:02:54] can't do it I'm gonna keep on recipe I
[1:03:00] praise the Lord
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:07] God wants to know will you say though
[1:03:10] God slays me yet I'll trust him amen
[1:03:14] what can separate me from the love of
[1:03:16] Christ if you have a nervous condition
[1:03:24] tonight if it was me I would raise my
[1:03:27] hand and say God if you healed that man
[1:03:30] you'll heal me there's a man here to
[1:03:38] seek your welfare what is the Holy Ghost
[1:03:50] for brother Ram said the Holy Ghost is
[1:03:54] here to bring a person of Jesus Christ
[1:03:56] to you
[1:04:00] Nehemiah might have felt you excuse me
[1:04:03] as I drink tea only then keeping my
[1:04:07] voice alive him and Nehemiah might have
[1:04:10] thought he was just another person in
[1:04:12] his time of history deciding to build
[1:04:14] walls but God was saying it's a pattern
[1:04:16] and it's a type aiming that the god of
[1:04:19] history is going to build up the walls
[1:04:21] again of many desolations of many
[1:04:23] generations your family's past might not
[1:04:26] have been able to stop it but God says
[1:04:28] in you I will stop it and I was so
[1:04:31] restoration in your life that what they
[1:04:35] couldn't overcome you overcome
[1:04:38] [Applause]
[1:04:41] that's what Nehemiah's talking about let
[1:04:53] me tell you if Abraham could learn to
[1:04:57] copy Melchizedek I came to you have a
[1:05:03] right to quote what the king of heaven
[1:05:06] says I have a right to tell the devil he
[1:05:14] said that I would be where he is it was
[1:05:21] a prayer of Jesus you've never stopped
[1:05:24] it before god knows what you're craving
[1:05:33] for rather random ascending things that
[1:05:35] are to be so there's something in you
[1:05:36] that that body needs there that craving
[1:05:39] is in you you're sitting here tonight
[1:05:40] craving God will bring a man across a
[1:05:42] platform to give you exactly what you
[1:05:43] have need of that's why God has pastors
[1:05:46] evangelists fivefold ministry Amen
[1:05:48] because there's a craving in you amen
[1:05:50] for that other side and it needs what
[1:05:52] you're craving for I say it again
[1:06:01] there's a man come seek your welfare be
[1:06:05] yours your brother Danny I got a lot of
[1:06:09] ruins around my life aren't you glad
[1:06:10] somebody's not ashamed to look at the
[1:06:12] ruins and said let's pick it up his
[1:06:18] understand the brother man said if we
[1:06:20] could only realize he's appearing to us
[1:06:21] in these meetings for one purpose to
[1:06:23] release our desires that we have in him
[1:06:26] to us I'll ask you a question do you
[1:06:28] have a desire in him he's here tonight
[1:06:31] to release it to you but we got to
[1:06:37] recognize his presence
[1:06:41] and I had some crackers now it's a good
[1:06:50] idea I want to start my church on a
[1:06:51] whole other thing
[1:06:52] the house a fellowship end of tea so
[1:07:06] it's important to understand that this
[1:07:07] restoration was accomplished by prophets
[1:07:11] prophets come and smoke it
[1:07:13] and God said I'll fulfill it amen
[1:07:18] I just want to say this because I want
[1:07:22] you to turn with me in your Bibles to
[1:07:23] Nehemiah 3 this is important to
[1:07:27] understand we won't hold you much longer
[1:07:31] but Nehemiah chapter 3 is the only
[1:07:33] chapter in the entire Bible that gives
[1:07:36] us the entire circumference of Jerusalem
[1:07:39] and shows all the position of the gates
[1:07:41] and it's a very important chapter to -
[1:07:48] you know rather on and find out we get a
[1:07:51] certain age our words start changing I
[1:07:54] was gonna say it's a very important
[1:07:56] chapter to the astronomers and it sure
[1:07:58] isn't
[1:07:59] but the arkla archaeologist is right
[1:08:02] there's a difference some are in the
[1:08:07] dirt in the sky they be offended um so
[1:08:14] and so they say that this chapter is the
[1:08:17] only one where they can get the clearest
[1:08:19] picture of what Jerusalem would look
[1:08:22] like but I want to focus and I have been
[1:08:25] gone with my church through this and I
[1:08:27] just want to focus on on the first three
[1:08:30] gates but only really the first gate
[1:08:32] because God is saying something very
[1:08:34] important you know a city without walls
[1:08:38] and without gates is a city anything can
[1:08:41] take a city that can be taken but the
[1:08:44] purpose of gates is for coming out and
[1:08:47] going in it's an entrance that is made
[1:08:50] jesus said I am the
[1:08:52] it's an interest that has made that what
[1:08:55] may look like a wall will have a door in
[1:08:58] it and then not only that it's a place
[1:09:03] of judgment where they would use to
[1:09:06] judge a situation I want you to read
[1:09:10] this first verse of chapter 3 in Elias
[1:09:13] ship the high priest rose it says then
[1:09:15] he rose up with his brethren what why
[1:09:18] did it say then because a message had
[1:09:20] went forth had just went forth about the
[1:09:24] inspiration of God to restore and they
[1:09:26] heard the double announcement to them
[1:09:29] that God is restoring and to the enemy
[1:09:31] that they had no right no portion or
[1:09:33] Memorial in Jerusalem you see when God
[1:09:36] brings a message also addresses his
[1:09:38] enemy and it says then they rose up with
[1:09:43] his brethren the priests and they built
[1:09:45] the sheep gate they sanctified it they
[1:09:47] set the doors of it even in the Tower of
[1:09:49] maiya they say to fight it unto the
[1:09:51] tower of Hannah kneel now it's going to
[1:09:54] say about this gate this is the only
[1:09:56] gate that they sank to fight the rest of
[1:09:59] the wall when it was finished they they
[1:10:01] dedicated it but this one they built and
[1:10:05] then they sanctified it and next to him
[1:10:08] built the minute Jericho and next to
[1:10:11] them built a deck or the son of Emery
[1:10:13] but the fish gate did the sons of Hass
[1:10:15] and I build who also laid the beams
[1:10:17] arrived and set up the doors or the
[1:10:19] locks there Evan the bars or if I want
[1:10:21] to read that last part again because
[1:10:22] it's important it says they set up the
[1:10:24] doors the locks and the bars and nexon
[1:10:27] to them repaired Maremma the son of eret
[1:10:29] other son of cause and next to them

[1:10:46] repaired but their nobles putting out
[1:10:49] there next to the work of the Lord we
[1:10:50] find out these Nobles are in every
[1:10:51] church they come but they don't work
[1:10:56] you come to the revival but when the
[1:10:58] load is polling they're not there and
[1:11:01] God thought it was something that I need
[1:11:04] to write this down that in the middle of
[1:11:05] this work there would be a people that
[1:11:07] said I'm not going to help that while
[1:11:10] I'm restoring there's a people sitting
[1:11:12] there with her arms folded said that's
[1:11:14] not me does that put them in there
[1:11:20] moreover the old gate repaired Johanna
[1:11:23] the son of passeth and Michelle on the
[1:11:25] son of Masada they laid the beam thereof
[1:11:27] here again set the bars and the locks

[1:11:50] Hananiah the Sun of the apothecaries and
[1:11:53] they fortify Jerusalem unto the broad
[1:11:54] wall okay that's what I wanted to read
[1:11:56] to you significance of this to me as I
[1:12:00] read this number one is that first gate
[1:12:03] is the Sheep gate it doesn't have a lock
[1:12:07] on it because this is the first gate
[1:12:12] that God wanted established in Jerusalem
[1:12:16] was the Sheep gate and the Sheep gate is
[1:12:19] where the sacrificial lambs were brought
[1:12:21] to come through to go to the temple on
[1:12:24] the way for the sacrifice and God is
[1:12:28] standing there and says this gate has no
[1:12:31] bars no lock no man has a right to put a
[1:12:38] lock on the door of the sacrifice yeah I
[1:12:46] want you to know that door is open
[1:12:48] tonight and not only as the significance
[1:12:51] it didn't have no lock on it but it also
[1:12:54] said that the men of Jericho helped
[1:12:56] build it what was Jericho Jericho was
[1:13:00] the cursed City
[1:13:01] Joshua Kirsten said any man built it let
[1:13:03] him be curse and let their firstborn
[1:13:05] died in the building
[1:13:07] and God said I can take those out of the
[1:13:10] curse city and help him show what a
[1:13:12] restoration of a sheep gate is I want
[1:13:16] you to tell I want you to know something
[1:13:17] that's where the Lambs come through it's
[1:13:19] not your work it's his work and the
[1:13:22] first thing he wants you to know about
[1:13:24] all of this building and all of these
[1:13:27] gates is I'm not gonna ask you to do one
[1:13:30] thing until you recognize this
[1:13:34] God will never ask you to work until you
[1:13:39] realize who he is what good is it to try
[1:13:46] to restore something if I don't know
[1:13:49] what the purpose of him is if I don't
[1:13:52] see who he is and what he's done and the
[1:13:56] door that he walks through hey if God
[1:14:06] would not put a lock on his door then
[1:14:11] Who am I to say it's over Who am I to
[1:14:15] say he's not in his kinsmen work anymore
[1:14:22] come on
[1:14:26] that God would say not only is I have I
[1:14:29] restored that door I want you to look at
[1:14:31] the man I had helped it the men of the
[1:14:33] lowest city the men of the cursed city
[1:14:35] that if God could give them
[1:14:37] encouragement you understand what living
[1:14:41] in a cursed City would put over you put
[1:14:44] a question mark in your life am I cursed
[1:14:50] God said I want you to work right beside
[1:14:52] the high priest help us to have lease at
[1:14:57] gate let the people see and in these
[1:15:01] restored lives that sacrifice is still
[1:15:04] real and that's what God could take
[1:15:08] people in this room that their lives
[1:15:11] have been cursed and ruined and God
[1:15:17] that's out bring you out of the lowest
[1:15:19] condition and your lives will help
[1:15:23] establish that that gate has no lock on
[1:15:26] it if my life can say there's no lock on
[1:15:30] the door your life can say there's no
[1:15:33] lock on the door he's still the same
[1:15:35] yesterday today and forever hey I was
[1:15:41] not saved as a message believer I was
[1:15:45] saved as a sinner
[1:15:47] there's nobody born in a pure condition
[1:15:50] you came from the lowest of low but God
[1:15:53] said let your life slide right slide
[1:15:55] right into place
[1:15:59] what a beautiful gate God said I'm not
[1:16:04] gonna ask you to build a fish gate
[1:16:06] fishers of men without building a man
[1:16:09] establishing that the sacrifice still
[1:16:12] come through hey you know hundreds of
[1:16:16] years later Jesus Christ walked through
[1:16:19] that gate
[1:16:21] came up to the Pool of Bethesda five
[1:16:24] porches on it it was like a hospital
[1:16:26] people were laying everywhere and you
[1:16:31] know the water is only troubled at
[1:16:33] certain seasons by an angel the gate too
[1:16:37] many of them was locked and they're all
[1:16:40] watching the water and there was a man
[1:16:43] somewhere in that crowd who'd been in
[1:16:47] that condition for 38 years some of you
[1:16:51] have gave up hope but you've not been in
[1:16:55] your condition that long here's a man

[1:17:14] there was a man that day walked into
[1:17:19] that pool walked to the Pool of Bethesda
[1:17:22] and while everybody's got their eyes
[1:17:24] fixed on the water there's this man
[1:17:28] seeking the welfare winding his way
[1:17:33] through all the affirmed the afflicted
[1:17:36] the sick lying in his way and he's going
[1:17:41] to go to a man who's never been able to
[1:17:43] pick up his bed and walk he's never been
[1:17:47] able to accept that moment you know why
[1:17:52] brother John for 38 years he had his
[1:17:55] eyes on the other men trying to get help
[1:17:58] from them and he told Jesus I've been no
[1:18:01] man has put me in the water and I
[1:18:03] haven't been able to get in but there's
[1:18:05] a man who's come to seek his welfare and
[1:18:08] it wasn't just Jesus Christ Jesus said I
[1:18:11] only do that which my father shows me it
[1:18:14] showed the father from heaven had sent
[1:18:17] Jesus Christ to that man you know what
[1:18:21] Jesus asked him Jesus never said you

[1:22:40] first that gates wide open there's not a
[1:22:45] lock on it I want you to know that God

[1:22:55] and it parted I'm the same God that came
[1:22:59] in a pillar of fire Amen - Moses I'm the
[1:23:01] same God a mean that came to Paul on the
[1:23:04] road in Damascus
[1:23:05] I'm the same God that spoke through the
[1:23:07] lips of Jesus Christ I'm the same God
[1:23:10] that had his picture taken over William
[1:23:12] Branham in 1950 and that same God is

[1:23:33] it's not according to the word your
[1:23:41] healing is not according to the word but
[1:23:45] you know what I found out about the man
[1:23:47] who built the sheep gate Jesus Christ he
[1:23:51] deliberately does it on those days
[1:23:53] because he wasn't running from the
[1:23:55] confrontation of these critics he was
[1:23:58] running at these critics because these
[1:24:00] critics had laid over these people a me
[1:24:02] with their doctrines and their
[1:24:04] conditions and their criticisms for
[1:24:06] years and then people could not stand up
[1:24:08] and be free but he ran it's those
[1:24:10] critics because they were his people
[1:24:13] that's my man down there with that that
[1:24:17] lame condition could it be December the
[1:24:22] 15th at 8:20 in the evening that God
[1:24:25] said now is the time to pick up your bed
[1:24:29] and walk is that I can't do it this is
[1:24:33] the great thing about the building of
[1:24:34] this wall did you read that last verse
[1:24:36] that I read with you and I'm closing the
[1:24:41] Bible says that the Goldsmith's and the
[1:24:46] sons of the apothecaries helped in the
[1:24:49] building of the wall now the last time I
[1:24:51] looked brother William the Goldsmith's
[1:24:55] did not work with huge stones that would
[1:24:59] be slid into the wall he worked with
[1:25:02] little gems he had them real thick
[1:25:06] glasses little things but men were
[1:25:12] really willing to move outside of their
[1:25:16] own abilities and get into the spirit of
[1:25:18] restoration God said I'll use a
[1:25:21] goldsmith to roll a big stone and I'll
[1:25:24] use pill rollers apothecaries sons to
[1:25:27] come up and do something they're not
[1:25:28] used to doing I'm gonna use you as part
[1:25:31] of this restoration
[1:25:32] I can't do it i'ma go Smith get in there
[1:25:35] and pick that stone up I've equipped you
[1:25:38] to build the wall hey I'll tell you the
[1:25:45] inspiration of that man that inspiration
[1:25:55] of that man that inspired Nehemiah is
[1:25:57] still here tonight the same one that

[1:26:02] same one telling you tonight pick up
[1:26:04] your bed and walk

[1:26:08] somebody outside of your comfort zone
[1:26:10] but get in the will of God and watch him
[1:26:12] do it you know a goldsmith and the sons
[1:26:21] of apothecaries could have a lot of
[1:26:23] excuses but God said this message I
[1:26:27] don't need one of your abilities I just
[1:26:30] need your body brother Danny I'm so
[1:26:35] smart I'll put things together and I'll
[1:26:37] get things right God said I don't need
[1:26:39] you as a goldsmith I need you as a wall
[1:26:41] builder the man could have said but man
[1:26:45] my business is rolling I got good eye
[1:26:47] getting good money I don't have time to
[1:26:49] build a wall
[1:26:50] but it showed that men were willing to
[1:26:52] leave their business and get in the
[1:26:53] business of God you put God first watch
[1:26:59] the wall built there's a man here
[1:27:05] tonight I can turn on the light if

[1:27:10] hand and say god amen I'm accepting that

[1:28:10] condition and said oh god you have to
[1:28:14] raise my children in this
[1:28:15] why don't you destroy it all he looked
[1:28:19] at a woman with blue hair sitting at a
[1:28:21] table with two men drinking beer he
[1:28:23] looked at a cop with his arm around a
[1:28:25] underaged girl gambling he looked at all
[1:28:27] the sin in that place and asked God to
[1:28:29] destroy it all brother branham didn't
[1:28:31] know that his own thoughts was a lock
[1:28:35] across the door of the Seabee aid and
[1:28:38] the angel says get behind the door and
[1:28:42] something God had to pull a prophet
[1:28:44] behind the door in order to show him an
[1:28:45] open door he pulled him behind the door
[1:28:48] and he got back there and he said I saw
[1:28:50] the world Amen in the blood of Jesus
[1:28:52] Christ going around it and he said and I
[1:28:56] saw my sins going up and hitting that
[1:28:58] blood said every time it hit the blood
[1:29:00] he said I'd see Jesus Christ standing
[1:29:02] there he jerked every time it hit him
[1:29:04] and he said Oh God and he said Lord is
[1:29:08] that my sins he says that's your sins
[1:29:10] said God forgive me said he reached over
[1:29:12] in his side took that bloody hand and he
[1:29:15] rode across the book pardon and he threw
[1:29:17] it behind him and then he said the angel
[1:29:21] turned and looked at that woman with
[1:29:24] blue hair you know the angel turned and
[1:29:31] looked
[1:29:32] why did he turn and look he wanted
[1:29:34] brother Brennan to look he said I
[1:29:37] forgave you but you condemned her what
[1:29:42] was he showing him the sheep gate has no
[1:29:46] lock on it you condemned her but it's
[1:29:50] still open he said I went back to that
[1:29:57] woman let me tell you what a vindicated
[1:29:59] prophet did Malachi Ford then he went
[1:30:01] back to that woman and asked if he could
[1:30:02] sit with her and she mistook her his
[1:30:04] intention and he she said I've already
[1:30:05] got come he said I don't mean it that
[1:30:07] way
[1:30:07] he said I want to talk to you about your
[1:30:09] life and he told her about what had just
[1:30:11] happened to him
[1:30:11] he said I was standing there condemning
[1:30:14] you and then God showed me my own sense
[1:30:15] and a prophet of God asked this blond
[1:30:19] had this blue headed alcoholic woman to
[1:30:23] forgive him that's how open the Sheep
[1:30:27] gate is forgive me I was condemned and
[1:30:35] you know what that prophet asking for
[1:30:37] that forgiveness opened up the doors of
[1:30:39] her life and she told him how it
[1:30:42] happened and right there he led her back
[1:30:45] to Christ I'll tell you tonight the
[1:30:48] Sheep gate is open and there's a man
[1:30:54] calling I've come to seek your welfare

[1:31:04] heads but some musicians would come

[2:24:40] realize what a great man brother Jackie
[2:24:42] was until we was in the jungles and we
[2:24:45] were stepping over snakes and he said
[2:24:50] the little children came out said that
[2:24:53] hello brother Jackie he was a celebrity
[2:24:56] in that neighborhood and they wouldn't
[2:24:59] even believe us

[2:25:06] Jackie Bibby news he probably has more
[2:25:08] miles on his odometer than any preacher

[2:25:25] is going to be the one that brings him
[2:25:27] and he's brother Danny's friend you see
[2:25:30] there's a problem is getting around or
[2:25:31] around the world that is coming together
[2:25:35] yeah and there's people in Romania
[2:25:38] that's that's really real important for
[2:25:43] the week important on where they come
[2:25:47] from in Romania the city that they come
[2:25:52] from brother Danny has been preaching in
[2:25:55] that city for years and he moved here
[2:26:02] from Mobile Alabama to be a part of us
[2:26:04] and we bring God that's been missionary
[2:26:07] in the place where your daddy came from
[2:26:10] for years this thing that changed me you

[2:26:52] entering this is season of it yes many
[2:26:56] of you will get together it will be a

[2:27:09] interchanging with one another talking
[2:27:12] to friends and neighbors and loved ones
[2:27:16] not parade through this season that it
[2:27:20] would be more than a historical story
[2:27:23] but Jesus would be at your house you see
[2:27:31] brother Ray said it before and I want to
[2:27:33] finish with this at my house it was a
[2:27:37] cabin some of you haven't been there but
[2:27:40] it was a cabin and then I built a
[2:27:45] kitchen on it and I built a bedroom on
[2:27:48] it and an office on and I was studying
[2:27:53] in my office and then walk out into the
[2:27:55] cold and then go into my room
[2:27:57] and I would leave that presence and I
[2:28:00] would go into my house and it would just
[2:28:03] seem like I was leaving a meeting and
[2:28:05] then walking out and trying to go back
[2:28:06] into it and I wanted to build a house to
[2:28:10] where that his presence would be all
[2:28:11] over that house now I don't care what
[2:28:15] size your house is I want it to be that
[2:28:18] in your life
