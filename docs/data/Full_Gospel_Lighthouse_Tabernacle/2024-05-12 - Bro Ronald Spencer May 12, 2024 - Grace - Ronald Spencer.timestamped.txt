[42:06] thankful I just so thankful so
[42:10] thankful amen we would be so happy if
[42:14] you had a $100,000 credit card bill and
[42:17] you knew there was no way ever in your
[42:20] life time to pay for
[42:24] it and someone came along
[42:28] and paid it all
[42:31] off you talking
[42:33] about
[42:36] happy you're talking about a relief off
[42:38] of your shoulders you would be so
[42:42] happy but in our great Christian walk
[42:45] that's kind of what
[42:47] happens but we don't want to go back and
[42:49] put a more debt on that credit card no
[42:53] more that's right we don't make Grace a
[42:56] disc Grace amen God bless you today I've
[43:00] read this to you a few times and I want
[43:02] to read it again today because it means
[43:04] a lot to this service I've given God a
[43:08] million reasons not to love
[43:12] me and none of them changed his
[43:21] mind
[43:23] Hallelujah Grace is the unmar favor of
[43:28] God you don't pay for
[43:30] it it's it's not necessarily a gift you
[43:34] don't beg for it it's something that God
[43:37] gives
[43:40] you it's a free gift it's
[43:44] undeserved of his love and favor of God
[43:48] towards a man as a
[43:50] sinner it is
[43:52] especially exhibited in God's great
[43:55] redemption's plan
[43:57] through Jesus
[43:59] Christ and it is the only by the free
[44:02] grace of God that we can embrace the
[44:04] offer of mercy and the appropriate to
[44:08] ourselves that the blessings of
[44:10] graciously purchased by his redeeming
[44:14] blood the grace of
[44:16] God it's so
[44:19] spontaneous it's so
[44:21] unmerited and it's something that only a
[44:26] sinner
[44:27] can really understand angels will never
[44:32] be able to understand the grace of God
[44:35] if you would turn with me to Hebrews
[44:37] Chap 11:5 and then Proverbs chapter
[44:45] 3 amen by faith Enoch was
[44:50] translated that he should not see
[44:54] death and was not found because because
[44:57] God had translated
[44:59] him for before his
[45:02] translation he had this
[45:05] testimony that he pleased
[45:09] God but without faith it is impossible
[45:12] to please him for he that cometh to God
[45:15] must believe that he is and that he and
[45:19] that he is a rewarder of them that
[45:23] diligently seek him I read that to you
[45:27] because you're the same people that are
[45:29] preparing for
[45:31] Rapture and you will not be found that's
[45:37] right you've been testifying that it's
[45:41] coming and people have just been going
[45:43] ignoring the the signs and and all of a
[45:46] sudden
[45:47] boom that's
[45:50] right we're not going to leave any love
[45:52] letters or left behind letters or
[45:54] anything like that we're going to leave
[45:58] amen are you with me
[46:01] now in Proverbs 3 and verse 3 let not
[46:06] mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them
[46:09] about thy neck write them up the tablet
[46:12] the table of thine heart and so shal
[46:15] thou find favor and good understanding
[46:18] in the sight of God in man trust in the
[46:21] Lord and with all thine heart and lean
[46:24] not to thy under standing you may be
[46:28] seated today Romans chapter 3 and verse
[46:32] 23 and I want us all to read this
[46:34] together today so good to see
[46:38] you Romans 3 and verse
[46:41] 23 is everybody ready is it up on there
[46:44] all right we go for all have sinned and
[46:49] come short of the glory of
[46:52] God so that leaves nobody
[46:55] out amen
[46:59] that leaves absolutely nobody
[47:02] out prophets priests Kings there's only
[47:05] one that came to the Earth that had no
[47:10] sin only
[47:12] one so every one of us today every one
[47:17] of us whether you was raised in a
[47:19] Christian home or a drunkard's home
[47:21] every one of us needed the blood of
[47:25] Jesus Christ
[47:27] let's read it again for all have sinned
[47:30] and come short of the glory of
[47:35] God now every one of us are in a
[47:41] battle every one of us as we get closer
[47:43] to the Rapture we're all in a
[47:48] battle there's no pity me here every one
[47:51] of us are in a
[47:53] battle I I got this this week and on
[47:56] June the 22nd of
[47:59] 1982
[48:02] 1982 Joe Biden was a senator from
[48:05] Delaware and
[48:07] confronted then prime minister monum
[48:12] bean and he had a long history with
[48:14] Israel all the way back to the beginning
[48:17] and during the Senate Foreign Relations
[48:20] Committee
[48:21] testimony threatening to cut off Aid to
[48:25] Israel I mean knows what happened this
[48:28] week monan Megan replied don't threaten
[48:34] us with cutting off your Aid it will not
[48:39] work I am not a Jew with trembling knees
[48:43] I'm a proud Jew with
[48:46] 3700 years of civilized history nobody
[48:51] came to our Aid when we were dying in
[48:53] gas Chambers and in ovens nobody came to
[48:57] our Aid when we were striving to create
[49:00] our country we paid for it we fought for
[49:04] it we died for it we will stand for our
[49:07] principles we will defend them and when
[49:11] necessary we will die for them again
[49:14] with or without your
[49:18] Aid that should be a history lesson for
[49:21] all of us today so I want to add to that
[49:24] today and I'm not into your politics so
[49:27] don't you throw your darts at me
[49:33] right I am not a bride with trembling
[49:38] [Applause]
[49:47] knees if Israel as our counterpart I am
[49:51] not a bride with trembling knees and
[49:53] rubbing hands together with worry I
[49:56] stand with my banner held high and my
[49:58] sword is pulled and there is devil's
[50:01] blood all over my
[50:02] sword we are warriors and we will not
[50:06] run and we will not hide we shall
[50:12] overcome Victory shall be
[50:18] mine Hallelujah don't you love the Lord
[50:21] that's a good way to start isn't it now
[50:24] brother brandom says in the kinsman
[50:25] redeemer he said now Sons and Daughters
[50:28] who ha who has the most
[50:30] powerful who has the most power before
[50:34] God an
[50:35] angel an angel as his servant now
[50:39] they're his servants what are you his
[50:42] sons and daughters who has the more
[50:45] power in
[50:47] heaven a sinner that's been saved by
[50:50] grace or an archangel that's standing
[50:53] there by his right side
[50:56] he said the
[51:00] sinner The Sinner that's been saved by
[51:03] grace has more Authority in heaven than
[51:06] the Archangel that stood by his side
[51:08] without sin because he's a son and a son
[51:12] has more Authority than a
[51:15] servant of course I like that don't you
[51:20] brother Doug good to see you in the
[51:21] house of the Lord back there give the
[51:23] Lord a good hand for brother Doug
[51:31] for those that don't know brother Doug
[51:33] had a he fell broke his hip they did a a
[51:35] replacement there and he's been in rehab
[51:38] now he's in
[51:40] theab amen so good to have him here in
[51:43] the house of the
[51:44] Lord in Zechariah 4 and verse 6 then
[51:49] answered and then he answered and spake
[51:51] unto me saying this is the word of the
[51:54] Lord and desable saying it's not by
[51:57] might nor by power but by my spirit
[51:59] saith the Lord of hosts who out thou oh
[52:03] oh great Heaven before zerubabel Thou
[52:06] shalt become a
[52:08] plain and he shall bring forth The
[52:12] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[52:15] Grace Grace unto
[52:20] it I just want to read some of the
[52:22] definition of the scripture that you
[52:24] have just been read who are art thou oh
[52:27] great mountains before zerubabel Thou
[52:30] shalt become a
[52:32] plain and how difficulty it's
[52:34] represented it it's such a great
[52:37] Mountain this mountain is
[52:40] impossible it's
[52:43] immovable it's a heap of
[52:45] rubbish like a great Mountain which is
[52:49] that must be got a away or a work that
[52:52] cannot go on the enemies of the Jews are
[52:55] proud and and hard work cannot go on he
[52:59] said the the the enemies of the Jews are
[53:01] proud and hard as they as great
[53:03] mountains but when God has a work to do
[53:07] I love this the mountains that stand in
[53:10] the
[53:11] way will dwindle into mole
[53:18] Hills the mountains that stand in your
[53:24] way will dwindle
[53:30] like mole Hills I love that don't
[53:35] you that huge mountain will become a
[53:42] plane not by what you did not by your
[53:46] might but we scream Grace
[53:50] Grace second cor Corinthians 12 and
[53:54] verse 9 and he said said unto me my
[53:57] grace is
[54:00] sufficient for thee for my grace my
[54:03] strength is made perfect in weakness
[54:06] most gladly therefore will I rather
[54:08] glory in my infirmities that the power
[54:10] of Christ May rest upon me therefore I
[54:13] take pleasure in infirmities and in
[54:15] reproaches and in necessities and
[54:18] persecutions in distresses or for
[54:20] Christ's sake for when I am weak then I
[54:25] am strong
[54:27] if we can just say it
[54:28] tonight our king is not on a cross no
[54:34] more that part has already been paid for
[54:38] he is not in a tomb no
[54:40] more let me just say and hell has been
[54:44] conquered every demon has been
[54:47] conquered and our King stands as our
[54:50] Mighty
[54:53] Champion are you with me now we declare
[54:57] Worthy is our
[55:01] lamb Jesus would
[55:03] pray thy kingdom come thy will be done
[55:06] in earth as it is in heaven give us this
[55:09] day our daily bread as we forgive our
[55:11] debts and as we forgive our
[55:14] debtors I love these words and lead us
[55:17] not into temptation but Deliver Us from
[55:20] Evil for thine is the kingdom the power
[55:24] and the glory forever
[55:27] amen every one of us stand here today
[55:30] with flaws in our
[55:32] lives you know as you first meet
[55:34] somebody you think well this man is
[55:36] perfect or this woman is perfect and the
[55:38] longer you're around
[55:43] them or the longer you're married to
[55:46] them or the longer that you work with
[55:51] them you find out that they got a
[55:55] flaw but I want you to know the flaw
[55:59] will either destroy you or it will drive
[56:06] you I choose for it not to destroy
[56:11] me are you with me now brother B said
[56:14] the grace is what God did for me and
[56:19] works is what I do for
[56:21] God Amen they'll make a Doctrine out of
[56:24] it they will think that works is what
[56:26] wins your merits if it is it is in a
[56:30] free grift Grace is what God did for you
[56:35] and by grace are you
[56:40] saved and our works is what you do in
[56:43] appreciation for the grace that he
[56:45] showed for you if you love him and you
[56:49] like to do the works of love you do that
[56:52] because you love him
[56:57] now remember when Jesus was standing
[57:00] there with a woman that was committed
[57:02] caught in adultery the law would would
[57:07] make her a
[57:08] prisoner and the prison house would not
[57:11] set her free and according to the law
[57:15] this woman had to
[57:19] die and they brought her to Jesus what
[57:21] an interesting thing they brought her to
[57:25] Jesus and they had a law to put her to
[57:27] death but now they're going to tempt him
[57:30] what is Jesus going to do with this
[57:32] adulterous woman and Jesus simply
[57:36] said as he was writing on the
[57:40] ground he that is without
[57:49] sin for all have sinned and come short
[57:52] of the glory of God brother Ron I have
[57:54] you to know that I have not sin in my
[57:56] life the thoughts that you thought this
[58:01] morning the attitudes that you exhibited
[58:05] this
[58:06] week come on somebody just go ahead and
[58:08] preach with me here for a little
[58:17] while and maybe they didn't make it from
[58:19] here thank God that they didn't go out
[58:21] of
[58:22] here but you know that you know that you
[58:25] know you
[58:27] and without God and His Saving Grace
[58:29] you're in a mess of
[58:32] trouble and so these men knew that he
[58:35] could read their hearts and read their
[58:36] lives and call their sin out but then
[58:40] they would be a public
[58:42] shame he that is without sin cast the
[58:45] first
[58:47] [Music]
[58:48] stone you talking about a rock dropping
[58:54] party a rock dropping party wouldn't you
[58:58] like to go to a rock dropping
[59:03] party men that had came to church today
[59:06] ready to destroy this woman now the word
[59:09] has quickened and now it's come to their
[59:12] part and he that is without sin go ahead
[59:15] and throw your stone
[59:30] you hear people blast this one and blast
[59:32] that one they need this
[59:33] part they need to re Jesus to come into
[59:36] their lives none of us has got a
[59:43] right whether you can throw a stone at
[59:45] 90 mph or 100 miles an hour or at 15
[59:49] miles an hour right I don't know how far
[59:52] it is from where you stand
[59:55] but come
[59:58] on and they turned and walked
[1:00:03] away and Jesus looks up at her brother
[1:00:06] Doug what an incredible statement Jesus
[1:00:09] looks up at her and he says
[1:00:15] woman where's thine
[1:00:21] accusers Lord I have
[1:00:23] none I love these next words neither do
[1:00:27] I accuse
[1:00:30] [Applause]
[1:00:37] you go and sin no
[1:00:43] more Hallelujah aren't you aren't you
[1:00:46] appreciative of that today what it is
[1:00:49] when a Parton comes your way and you
[1:00:52] accept the pardon and you realize
[1:00:56] I'm not guilty of that no
[1:00:59] more but you did it this house did
[1:01:04] it you look like the same house but
[1:01:08] there's a new King on the inside of your
[1:01:11] heart because Jesus said I am the way
[1:01:15] the
[1:01:17] truth and the
[1:01:23] life many of us have made choices that
[1:01:25] we we have regretted over and over and
[1:01:28] over again choices take us
[1:01:31] somewhere choices take us somewhere make
[1:01:35] sure as you're making choices in your
[1:01:37] life let me just say this to you many of
[1:01:40] us have SED Bad
[1:01:45] Seed remember we're all in the same team
[1:01:48] now many of us have SED Bad
[1:01:52] Seed seed come up you can't cancel the
[1:01:55] Harvest
[1:01:57] seed come
[1:02:01] up but what you must do is plant more
[1:02:06] good
[1:02:07] seed than ever was SED bad
[1:02:11] seed and the good seed will cancel out
[1:02:17] the it'll choke it
[1:02:21] out
[1:02:23] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:27] remember you reap what you
[1:02:28] sow remember this your sins will find
[1:02:31] you
[1:02:34] out Abraham was justified by faith we
[1:02:37] could just talk about this for just a
[1:02:39] little while we're in we're in we're all
[1:02:43] of us in the same family Abraham was
[1:02:46] justified by faith that's quite a
[1:02:49] statement Abraham was a man that was
[1:02:52] known as a liar
[1:02:57] to save his own skin he
[1:03:01] lied without God's grace he's in trouble
[1:03:04] and he's the father of us
[1:03:06] all Moses could have been known as the
[1:03:09] great
[1:03:12] murderer cuz he murdered an Egyptian and
[1:03:15] left him and even after 40 years he
[1:03:17] comes back and the people remember him
[1:03:20] did you come back to kill us
[1:03:23] too Paul that writes 14 books of the
[1:03:27] Bible was a murderer he was guilty of
[1:03:31] murdering we don't know exactly how many
[1:03:34] but he was guilty in his
[1:03:37] Zeal right in his Zeal to get rid of
[1:03:41] this Jesus
[1:03:44] movement he was guilty of Taking Lives
[1:03:49] one being Steven that would hon him the
[1:03:52] rest of the days of his life because he
[1:03:54] held his coat as Steven the Deacon stood
[1:03:57] there and preached all the way back from
[1:03:59] the beginning to this same Jesus and
[1:04:02] then at his death he said I saw him
[1:04:05] standing at the right hand of
[1:04:07] God so we could say Paul is not worthy
[1:04:13] today he was a
[1:04:15] murderer are you with me
[1:04:18] now because Paul would write it like
[1:04:20] this 1 Corinthians 15 for I am the least
[1:04:23] of the Apostles
[1:04:26] that am not me to be called an apostle
[1:04:29] because I persecuted the
[1:04:33] church but by the grace of
[1:04:37] God but by the grace of God I am what I
[1:04:43] am all of us had a lot of chapters in
[1:04:46] our life that we are so ashamed of but
[1:04:49] by the grace of
[1:04:52] God but by the amazing grace of God
[1:04:57] oh we ought to shout but by the amazing
[1:05:00] grace of God he rewrote my
[1:05:04] life and I am what I
[1:05:07] [Applause]
[1:05:22] am brother brandom
[1:05:26] had it not been for the grace of God
[1:05:28] would have killed five
[1:05:34] boys is making fun of
[1:05:37] him and he'd had
[1:05:40] enough he had a family heritage of some
[1:05:43] mean mean
[1:05:45] Brams brother Ron but brother brandham
[1:05:48] wasn't mean it are you serious with me
[1:05:51] come
[1:05:52] on he had a gun and he was a shot and
[1:05:56] would get upset if the second bullet
[1:05:59] didn't go through the same hole that's
[1:06:02] right he would get upset if he shot a
[1:06:06] squirrel and didn't shoot it in the
[1:06:08] eye right when he's shooting at these
[1:06:13] boys and the gun would not go
[1:06:17] off and they're running for their
[1:06:20] life had it not been for the grace of
[1:06:24] God
[1:06:28] William Brandon would have spent his
[1:06:30] whole life in
[1:06:33] prison but God rich in
[1:06:39] Mercy stop that boy from killing those
[1:06:43] five
[1:06:44] men he stopped him because he had a lot
[1:06:47] of chapters in the
[1:06:50] book he stopped him he would have never
[1:06:53] exhibited the prophet of God Malachi 4:5
[1:06:56] and6 never saw the mighty Angel never
[1:06:59] preach the seals never preach the church
[1:07:01] agents never delivered the
[1:07:03] message because Satan had him in a
[1:07:07] trap and Satan was trying to destroy his
[1:07:10] life because Satan watched that
[1:07:12] Whirlwind come down over that
[1:07:17] that but that was William brandom how
[1:07:19] much has God stopped things in your life
[1:07:26] he stopped it he stopped
[1:07:29] it because your book would have been a
[1:07:32] lot of different than it is

[1:07:39] mercy God rich in
[1:07:42] Mercy stop the choice stop the decision
[1:07:46] stop the relationship

[1:08:24] potential

[1:08:28] decision spent the rest of their life in
[1:08:32] prison

[1:08:38] bad
[1:08:40] night with a wrong kind of
[1:08:47] friends good people up till one

[1:09:15] message kindergarten
[1:09:17] yet your choices were taking you the
[1:09:20] wrong
[1:09:21] way and God started closing the doors on
[1:09:24] your life cuz he had a
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:27] [Applause]
[1:09:35] brother Roger you were writing the book

[1:09:40] way and definitely an

[1:10:50] Mercy brother BR said that's what the
[1:10:52] way it is today we guilty

[1:11:03] living we're not worthy to come to
[1:11:06] Christ we're not worthy to ask anything
[1:11:09] but God I'm trying to behave but God
[1:11:13] never looks at your
[1:11:19] unworthiness God never looks at your
[1:11:23] unworthiness

[1:13:06] dragging it
[1:13:14] out that's free wasn't on the notes but
[1:13:17] it's free for
[1:13:23] you he looked at our land
[1:13:26] and if he can't find no fault in Christ
[1:13:30] then you're
[1:13:34] free in the New Testament no matter
[1:13:36] what's wrong with you don't look at
[1:13:41] yourself look at your
[1:13:48] lamb we can't find any
[1:13:51] fault in
[1:13:53] him this scripture says in Ephesians
[1:13:56] chapter 2 and you ha he quickened who
[1:13:59] were dead in trespasses and sins wherein
[1:14:03] in times past you walked according to
[1:14:04] the course of this world according to
[1:14:07] the prince of the power of the air the
[1:14:09] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:14:10] of Disobedience among whom that we all
[1:14:13] had our conversations in time pass and
[1:14:15] lust in our flesh fulfillment the
[1:14:17] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[1:14:19] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:14:21] even as
[1:14:23] others but God who is rich in
[1:14:28] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:14:31] loved us even we were dead in sins hath
[1:14:34] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:14:37] Grace ye are
[1:14:40] saved and hath raised us up together and
[1:14:43] made us to sit in Heavenly places in
[1:14:45] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[1:14:48] that he might show the exceeding Riches
[1:14:50] of Grace and kindness toward through
[1:14:54] Christ Jesus
[1:14:55] for by Grace ye are saved through faith
[1:14:58] and not of
[1:15:02] yourselves want you to go ahead and read
[1:15:04] the last part of
[1:15:09] it it is the gift of
[1:15:14] God now he says now if you got eternal
[1:15:19] life
[1:15:21] tonight and if we have eternal life
[1:15:25] than we always
[1:15:27] were
[1:15:30] right brother Ron but what about the
[1:15:32] good old days well my good old days were
[1:15:35] days I can't remember because I was in
[1:15:37] his
[1:15:39] mind
[1:15:41] amen but if you're talking about the Old
[1:15:44] King that was in this heart I'm not that
[1:15:47] guy no
[1:15:48] more I'm not even guilty of what that
[1:15:51] guy did
[1:16:02] if we have eternal
[1:16:05] life then we always were because there
[1:16:08] is only one form of eternal life we
[1:16:11] always were and the reason we were is
[1:16:15] because we were part of God and God is
[1:16:17] the only thing that's
[1:16:20] Eternal skip I want to skip a chap a a a
[1:16:24] thing there I need he said now we are
[1:16:26] part of
[1:16:27] God we always was you don't remember it
[1:16:32] because you were only an attribute in
[1:16:34] God but you were in his thinking you
[1:16:36] your very name if if it ever was on the
[1:16:40] book of life it was put there before the
[1:16:43] foundation of the
[1:16:47] world brother Ron we've heard that a
[1:16:49] million times well I'm not necessarily
[1:16:51] just reading it to
[1:16:53] you I'm reading that to the accuser that
[1:16:56] accuses you every
[1:17:01] day now young people I just want to say
[1:17:03] this to you the devil that is your
[1:17:05] accuser of the Brethren will talk you
[1:17:07] into doing something
[1:17:11] wrong and then we'll call the
[1:17:15] law and then he will he'll talk you into
[1:17:18] going the wrong side of wrong kind of
[1:17:21] websites and then start making you feel
[1:17:24] like you're nothing but
[1:17:28] mud but once God forgives you of that
[1:17:31] you don't never go back to it
[1:17:33] again and then when the enemy reminds
[1:17:36] you of what you used to do you remind
[1:17:44] him you're talking to the wrong guy
[1:17:49] [Applause]
[1:18:02] sometimes I just need to take a deep
[1:18:04] breath it's hard for me to imagine or
[1:18:08] especially self-righteous people to
[1:18:13] imagine that that
[1:18:16] Jesus's
[1:18:22] congregation now the guy that's going to
[1:18:24] be the lead spokesman of the church
[1:18:26] where does he go get
[1:18:29] him I can imagine the accuser of the
[1:18:31] Brethren going hm and they think he's
[1:18:34] the Messiah and he's picking the lead
[1:18:37] speaker of Acts 2 and he's
[1:18:41] naked and he's on a
[1:18:43] boat and he's cursing
[1:18:48] amen this he's going to be a habitual
[1:18:50] offender
[1:18:53] here until he gets the Holy Ghost in
[1:18:56] Acts
[1:18:59] 2 even the chosen series
[1:19:02] says his temper I have a lot of trouble
[1:19:09] with I'm sure Jesus had a lot of trouble
[1:19:11] with Peter's
[1:19:20] temper I'm GNA leave
[1:19:23] it what what about the sisters in his
[1:19:26] church
[1:19:28] well Mary Magdalene had Seven Devils in
[1:19:32] her that's right and she was listen
[1:19:35] living basically as an exile in her own
[1:19:38] community and nobody wanted nothing to
[1:19:40] do with her but she's going to be one of
[1:19:43] the leading
[1:19:48] ladies you talking about
[1:19:50] Grace you talking about people want to
[1:19:53] throw a stone amen okay okay you got one
[1:19:57] example let's go to another
[1:19:59] one he sends the disciples
[1:20:01] away and he goes to a well all of you
[1:20:05] are on the same page right now This
[1:20:08] Woman's been married five times living
[1:20:10] with another man she's not qualified in
[1:20:13] any church
[1:20:17] amen and Jesus goes and sits down in the
[1:20:20] well talks to her listen he has never
[1:20:24] told no no other human being I'm the
[1:20:28] Messiah but he's going to tell a woman
[1:20:31] that's that's now living with another
[1:20:33] man five times been married
[1:20:36] before but she needs to meet
[1:20:40] him because he'll fix her
[1:20:52] problem listen you can go to a thous
[1:20:54] churches you can put your name on a
[1:20:56] thousand books but until you meet Jesus
[1:21:00] and I talk about meeting Jesus meeting
[1:21:03] Jesus meeting Jesus more than a book
[1:21:07] more than a picture more than a sermon
[1:21:10] more than a song but when you meet him
[1:21:14] you'll never be the same ever again
[1:21:33] and she preaches back to him a woman in
[1:21:36] this condition preaches back to
[1:21:39] him but in a few minutes he reveals the
[1:21:42] secrets of her
[1:21:49] heart you know the light just comes on
[1:21:52] the light just comes on
[1:21:54] and now she wants to go into the City
[1:21:57] and tell
[1:21:59] everybody about this
[1:22:08] Jesus J Jesus handpicks one of these
[1:22:13] ladies to be the witness of Resurrection
[1:22:17] right he doesn't pick one of those high
[1:22:22] class preachers
[1:22:26] he doesn't pick Thomas he doesn't pick
[1:22:29] Peter he doesn't pick Nathaniel he
[1:22:32] doesn't pick none of them but he picks a
[1:22:35] woman that's got a
[1:22:37] history on he picks a woman with a
[1:22:43] history and he needs her and he tells
[1:22:45] her to come anoint the
[1:22:48] body cuz he know I'm not going to be
[1:22:51] there but I need her there
[1:22:55] and when she finds the grave there's
[1:22:57] nobody laying there she immediately
[1:22:59] begins to think somebody stole the body
[1:23:02] away somebody's done something with him
[1:23:05] but he needs her there he needs her her
[1:23:08] eyes to look in there and see he's not
[1:23:10] there she has to hear the angels
[1:23:14] say did not he tell you these things
[1:23:16] when he was in Galilee amen and brother
[1:23:19] brandham said he said angels are Among
[1:23:21] Us in church and we don't realize
[1:23:23] they're there
[1:23:25] they didn't know the Angels was there he
[1:23:26] was telling them prophecy now it's
[1:23:29] fulfilled why seek ye the living amongst
[1:23:32] the dead he's not
[1:23:34] dead but he needed you here let me just
[1:23:37] say he needs you
[1:23:40] here turn on turn to your neighbor say
[1:23:42] he needs you
[1:23:45] here cuz you're Witnesses of the rapture
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:24:01] I think this is
[1:24:02] phenomenal and I'm just going to jump
[1:24:04] I'm just going to boom boom boom through
[1:24:07] this when she recognized rabona Mary
[1:24:12] rabona that's him said touch me
[1:24:15] not because his body has to go to before
[1:24:18] God and he's carried that blood before
[1:24:21] God don't touch me now but I must have
[1:24:25] sin listen it don't take God a long time
[1:24:28] to do anything amen and literally in the
[1:24:31] next scriptures or so he's telling
[1:24:33] Thomas F
[1:24:36] me listen it's already paid for the
[1:24:39] blood is already there feel
[1:24:43] me I am your high
[1:24:46] priest I have paid for it the blood's on
[1:24:49] the throne the Grace has been paid for
[1:24:54] just a few moments ago she couldn't
[1:24:56] touch me but now you can put your hands
[1:24:59] on the
[1:25:00] word now
[1:25:02] you with your
[1:25:06] history now you got a right
[1:25:37] can I tell you one more
[1:25:43] story there was a king David we know all
[1:25:46] about
[1:25:47] Goliath wasn't that great last
[1:25:50] night pH I don't know how much better it
[1:25:53] can get amen I just say Lord change my
[1:25:56] body just change my body I can't hardly
[1:25:59] take it I I feel like kind of like
[1:26:01] thatting the way right
[1:26:05] now my chest feels like it's going to
[1:26:07] explode but I got a feeling it's him not
[1:26:10] the not the
[1:26:14] enemy
[1:26:17] David he had
[1:26:19] actually fought 18 Wars at this time
[1:26:25] I can imagine how big his castle was his
[1:26:27] headquarters the White
[1:26:30] House I can
[1:26:33] imagine how beautiful it was all the
[1:26:36] marble and all the gold and he was
[1:26:39] representing the King
[1:26:42] Jesus I can just imagine how many
[1:26:46] servants took care of
[1:26:50] him I can imagine the
[1:26:53] feast that happened on their mother's
[1:26:57] day I can imagine his
[1:27:00] table being phenomenally
[1:27:03] long great people would come in and sit
[1:27:07] at his table because he's a king and
[1:27:10] he's conquered he's the greatest King in
[1:27:12] the
[1:27:13] earth amen you talking about greatest
[1:27:16] King he's the greatest King cuz he has
[1:27:19] to represent Jesus
[1:27:24] and he's the greatest King that will
[1:27:26] ever
[1:27:32] be you see David had succeeded
[1:27:37] Saul Saul could have had all of this but
[1:27:42] jealousy backslidden spirit amen had
[1:27:46] took their away the scripture actually
[1:27:48] says that God rent The Kingdom from him
[1:27:54] let me just drop something to you don't
[1:27:56] you get yourself all worked up on
[1:27:59] politics it's of the
[1:28:04] devil are you with me it's of the devil
[1:28:07] and let me just say God causes men to
[1:28:10] rise and
[1:28:12] fall we think we're voting people
[1:28:16] in yeah it's fixed and I'm not talking
[1:28:19] about voting machines God's got men yeah
[1:28:24] that's going to rise like a pharaoh like
[1:28:27] a Putin like a
[1:28:31] pope that's going to rise to do his
[1:28:35] purpose there are only Pawns in the
[1:28:37] kingdom of God have no Eternal value but
[1:28:40] they're going to fulfill the promises of
[1:28:44] God Saul rose
[1:28:47] up because they wanted a
[1:28:50] king he rose up and God had to rent the
[1:28:54] kingdom away from him now David has a
[1:28:58] let me just say this to you if you could
[1:29:00] look back at the maps and I'm sure you
[1:29:02] have Andrew look back at the map of
[1:29:05] Israel it was huge in comparison to what
[1:29:07] Israel is
[1:29:09] today so you can imagine his Reign and
[1:29:12] how much power that he had how much
[1:29:15] force that he had the fear of
[1:29:19] David David got to thinking about when
[1:29:22] he was young there was a man in his life
[1:29:25] that was more than just a mentor but he
[1:29:28] was a friend they would call themselves
[1:29:30] Blood Brothers and his name was
[1:29:35] Jonathan and he would have phenomenal
[1:29:39] respect for
[1:29:41] Jonathan and on this day after 18 Wars
[1:29:44] has taken place he gets to thinking
[1:29:46] about I
[1:29:48] wonder I wonder if there's anybody of
[1:29:51] Saul's
[1:29:52] household that has still
[1:29:59] alive because as your tradition would be
[1:30:01] when one went out they would slay the
[1:30:05] entire family there would be none left
[1:30:10] amen are you with me that's what God
[1:30:12] wants to do with the demons that have
[1:30:14] fought you in their life he's not going
[1:30:15] to just chase them down and leave two or
[1:30:18] three he's one to get rid of them
[1:30:21] all my God is a warrior God
[1:30:33] I think you're going to like this
[1:30:34] brother
[1:30:36] Denny and he sent out word is there
[1:30:40] anybody that is still in Saul and
[1:30:44] Jonathan's
[1:30:47] family somebody remembered that there
[1:30:50] was a
[1:30:50] nurse that was taking care of a baby
[1:30:53] called
[1:30:56] feef can you imagine going to school and
[1:30:59] having to spell
[1:31:03] that and they jumped out the
[1:31:05] window and that boy become a
[1:31:08] for the rest of the days of his
[1:31:11] life he would have children he would
[1:31:14] have
[1:31:19] servants but he live in Exile
[1:31:24] in a place called loab
[1:31:26] bar I got a feeling that every person in
[1:31:29] this
[1:31:30] building has lived in loab
[1:31:38] bar it was as close as you could be to
[1:31:40] living off the
[1:31:42] grid to where that David and his men
[1:31:46] wouldn't find you
[1:31:49] amen he was living crippled he was
[1:31:52] living in shame his family has been
[1:31:54] destroyed his his his grandfather his
[1:31:58] father has
[1:32:01] shamefully disgrace the kingdom of
[1:32:06] God and when David's people begin to
[1:32:10] come back and said there's one
[1:32:13] left where is he
[1:32:15] at loar where's
[1:32:21] that will you take the best taxy that
[1:32:24] we've got and go get
[1:32:29] him take the best chariots that we've
