[53:09] to me and so you know when I went that
[53:14] year and the Lord had laid on my heart
[53:16] that God was going to call brother
[53:18] Michael to preach brother Michael was
[53:22] very satisfied working in the
[53:25] office and and uh he never thought he
[53:28] would ever preach the
[53:31] gospel and
[53:33] uh in the prayer line I dealt with
[53:36] brother Michael and he screamed no no
[53:42] no and the next day he he wanted to have
[53:45] some time with me and and he told me he

[57:47] doing it is marvelous in our
[57:51] eyes this is the day which the Lord hath
[57:55] made we will rejoice and be glad in it
[58:00] in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse
[58:06] 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall
[58:09] not all sleep but we shall be changed in
[58:14] a moment and in the twinkle of an eye at
[58:18] the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[58:21] sound and the dead shall be raised
[58:24] Incorruptible and we shall be changed I
[58:28] love this verse for this corruptible

[58:34] must put on
[58:38] immortality amen God bless you may the
[58:41] Lord bless the reading of his word this
[58:51] morning I think every one of us have a
[58:53] Divine appointment with the Lord amen
[58:57] and you just know there are certain
[58:59] times maybe one or a couple of times in
[59:02] your life that you just know that you
[59:05] know that you
[59:08] know this is a very special place to be
[59:11] at
[59:15] am brother Alden I didn't ask you
[59:17] permission
[59:19] but I want to I want to use a statement
[59:21] that you've told me many
[59:24] times brother alden's been around me
[59:26] quite a bit and and we enjoy some time
[59:30] together and we've enjoyed some time
[59:32] away and vacations together we've
[59:34] enjoyed work together we've enjoyed
[59:37] hunting
[59:39] together and he said I just want to be
[59:41] around
[59:42] you just in case something Supernatural
[59:48] happens Lord this week I was I was I was
[59:52] just going through some YouTube and I
[59:54] was looking for sermons that that we all
[59:57] enjoy and and this week maybe it's been
[1:00:00] there for a long time but I caught some
[1:00:04] some moments of brother branham's some
[1:00:06] home videos of of brother brandham and
[1:00:10] maybe you can find him they're easy
[1:00:11] toine but anyway there was a five minute
[1:00:14] clip there was a I think 11 minute clip
[1:00:17] that was there and then there was some
[1:00:19] more clips and and I watched it and itel
[1:00:22] I just felt led to watch it over and
[1:00:24] over and over again I don't know how
[1:00:26] many times I watched it but sister
[1:00:29] Connie went on to bed and I was just
[1:00:31] watching that over and over and over
[1:00:33] again and and so I as I was watching it
[1:00:37] I I kind of begin to question myself why
[1:00:40] am I watching this over and over and
[1:00:43] over again and then the Lord dealt with
[1:00:46] me
[1:00:48] amen and I begin to think about the
[1:00:52] people that was in the movie that was
[1:00:55] there that was with brother brandom and
[1:00:58] his little slender tie and and you know
[1:01:01] it he was had his cowboy hat at times
[1:01:03] and and he was just enjoying maybe the
[1:01:06] wedding for for for his family and uh
[1:01:11] and I I was just watching it and then it
[1:01:14] just came to me these people don't
[1:01:17] realize what is really going
[1:01:21] on they don't realize the presence that
[1:01:24] they're really in
[1:01:26] am the moment that they're
[1:01:29] there and I begin to think about it and
[1:01:31] this led me on the on the morning at
[1:01:33] 4:00 I begin to go in my mind and the
[1:01:37] spirit of the Lord begin to deal with me
[1:01:40] of of St John chapter
[1:01:43] 4 when Jesus would go to the
[1:01:46] well and he would go by the way of sikar
[1:01:50] he would go there and and you would
[1:01:52] think you would think for just a little
[1:01:54] while in Samar
[1:01:56] ARA why would you go to Samaria a lot of
[1:02:00] very difficult people there people that
[1:02:03] really don't believe will not believe
[1:02:05] anything and the disciples will even
[1:02:08] kind of Wonder within theirself and
[1:02:11] Jesus sends them away and it would send
[1:02:14] them away to go buy vils of meat or or
[1:02:18] or whatever for the food and he'll send
[1:02:21] them away because they won't understand
[1:02:24] and he will go and set on a well and he
[1:02:27] would sit here for quite a while and
[1:02:30] finally there would come a woman in the
[1:02:33] evening time or the heat of the day and
[1:02:36] she would come and he would begin to
[1:02:38] have a conversation with her and he
[1:02:41] would say I I'd like a drink and she'd
[1:02:44] begin to rebuff him for a little bit
[1:02:47] then she would tell him of her religious
[1:02:49] nature and she would begin to tell him
[1:02:52] you're a prophet or these kinds of
[1:02:54] things and begin to re buff him and but
[1:02:58] he knew who she was but she didn't know
[1:03:02] who he
[1:03:04] was now here's uh something that I want
[1:03:08] to get to you this morning just for a
[1:03:10] quick second Jesus never told any of
[1:03:13] those priests who he
[1:03:17] was he never told any of the rulers of
[1:03:21] the city who he was but he would talk to
[1:03:26] predestinated seed that was caught in a
[1:03:29] very immoral situation one to which
[1:03:33] Satan had tried to destroy her and tried
[1:03:37] to put a lot of sin on her life to which
[1:03:41] that you would think that she's
[1:03:43] disqualified from ever sitting in
[1:03:46] church but God looked past all of the
[1:03:52] wickedness he looked past all of her
[1:03:56] flesh and all of her
[1:04:00] excuses and saw a predestinated seed
[1:04:03] that was inside of
[1:04:07] there and he would begin to speak to her
[1:04:11] how important was this meeting that's
[1:04:14] what I want to ask how important was
[1:04:17] this
[1:04:19] meeting listen when Jesus finishes with
[1:04:23] her and begins to talk about her her
[1:04:25] five husbands I thought the program
[1:04:28] chosen did an incredible job of catching
[1:04:32] that I I thought they did an incredible
[1:04:35] job of catching that and then she would
[1:04:38] realize the moment that's
[1:04:41] him he would tell her that he was the
[1:04:44] Messiah but in a moment in a very sacred
[1:04:49] moment
[1:04:51] she realized who he was and in that
[1:04:56] moment listen everything in her life was
[1:05:04] changed now I I want you to
[1:05:08] understand the prophet of this
[1:05:11] day would stand before Untold amount of
[1:05:16] congregations not just Jeffersonville
[1:05:19] but he would stand around the world and
[1:05:22] it would go back and capture this story
[1:05:26] yes because knowing that the Messiah has
[1:05:30] come in this day for the Bride of Jesus
[1:05:34] Christ and he was going to use more than
[1:05:37] the prophet's body or his
[1:05:41] voice but he was going to stand in those
[1:05:44] audiences from small audiences to
[1:05:47] literally tens of thousands of audience
[1:05:51] and display that Messiah gift again
[1:05:56] and he was going to be standing before
[1:05:58] audiences that would have different
[1:06:01] backgrounds Hindu he was going to stand
[1:06:04] before people that had all kinds of
[1:06:06] false gods even Methodist and Baptist
[1:06:10] and Full Gospel people that would come
[1:06:12] to those audiences and they would sit
[1:06:15] there let me just say this to you but a
[1:06:21] handful and I want you to catch this a
[1:06:24] handful
[1:06:25] caught what was going on in the
[1:06:31] service many of us have had this
[1:06:35] experience sitting in a service maybe
[1:06:38] unsaved having a friend that set him
[1:06:41] beside of you in the same condition and
[1:06:44] while you're sitting in the service
[1:06:47] something all of a sudden grabbed
[1:06:50] you and you went that's God that's real
[1:06:56] that's what I've been looking for all my
[1:07:01] life that's what I've been looking for
[1:07:03] and your friend go I didn't get
[1:07:06] anything their life what they walked out
[1:07:09] their life just went on was just stayed
[1:07:12] the same but
[1:07:14] you because of that predestinated seed
[1:07:18] was sitting in the
[1:07:20] moment you had lived your life for maybe
[1:07:23] a couple of decades or maybe 40 50 years
[1:07:26] but all of a sudden you had a Divine
[1:07:32] appointment thank you Lord are you with
[1:07:35] me I'm going to tell you just a couple
[1:07:37] of
[1:07:41] stories brother Jonah 's
[1:07:45] father his his father had had there was
[1:07:50] a war in Germany we all know about that
[1:07:54] but he saw a girl on the other side of
[1:07:57] the
[1:07:58] street and he he saw her just saw her
[1:08:02] and he said that's the kind of girl that
[1:08:05] I want to have as a
[1:08:08] wife years literally years later I think
[1:08:12] somewhere around 10 years later he's in
[1:08:17] Canada and he's looking across the
[1:08:19] street and he sees that same
[1:08:24] girl take the chances of
[1:08:26] that and some way or another I don't
[1:08:29] want to go into the story but he wanted
[1:08:32] to meet her and he wanted to have some
[1:08:33] time with her and she said well come to
[1:08:37] my house for Bible study he didn't know
[1:08:40] anything about Bible and so she would
[1:08:43] read to him the Bible cuz he had never
[1:08:46] read it and she would read to him about
[1:08:49] prophets and she would read to me about
[1:08:52] Moses and Noah and and all the prophets
[1:08:56] of the Old Testament so she invites him
[1:08:59] to a meeting where William brandham is
[1:09:02] going to be the
[1:09:06] speaker and he goes to the meeting he
[1:09:09] invites a
[1:09:11] friend he invites a friend to be with
[1:09:14] him in the meeting and so he goes to the
[1:09:17] meeting listen and he goes to the
[1:09:20] meeting and he sits there and he said
[1:09:22] here's brother brandham one time
[1:09:27] once it's all he ever heard him one time
[1:09:31] and he tells his friend that man is a
[1:09:37] prophet he spends the rest of his life
[1:09:40] as a gives his heart to God spends the
[1:09:44] rest of his life as a preacher of the
[1:09:47] message of the
[1:09:50] hour he didn't miss his
[1:09:53] moment he didn't miss his moment that
[1:09:57] Divine appointment hit his life and his
[1:10:00] family is Believers and they have a
[1:10:02] church in Colona I believe it
[1:10:06] is but he caught the
[1:10:11] moment another Minister tells that they
[1:10:14] were in brother bram's
[1:10:17] meeting said they were sitting
[1:10:19] there and brother brandom is praying for
[1:10:22] a man that had a brain tumor
[1:10:25] and is's praying for the man and said
[1:10:29] every person here bow your
[1:10:31] head and here sets a young man that's
[1:10:35] going to be a preacher in the
[1:10:37] message and he's got a friend just
[1:10:40] brought
[1:10:41] him and brother Brandon prays for that
[1:10:44] man that has a brain tumor go your way
[1:10:47] and be
[1:10:48] well goes off of the side so later after
[1:10:52] there they leave the meeting
[1:10:55] he
[1:10:56] said when they prayed for that man with
[1:10:59] the brain tumor he said did you bow your
[1:11:01] head he said no I didn't bow my head I
[1:11:05] didn't think nothing of this business
[1:11:08] now listen I want you to think about the
[1:11:10] important part here six months later his
[1:11:14] friend dies of a brain tumor
[1:11:19] on how important was that was that
[1:11:23] service
[1:11:25] how important was that
[1:11:30] irreverence are you with me we've had a
[1:11:32] lot of people
[1:11:33] here listen this this Hillside wouldn't
[1:11:37] hold the
[1:11:39] people that have sit in our
[1:11:41] services and for many they just didn't
[1:11:44] get anything or they just walked
[1:11:47] away but something held
[1:11:51] you something held you
[1:11:55] many of you got families and and they
[1:11:58] just you know they didn't they don't see
[1:12:00] anything important about what's
[1:12:02] here but something held
[1:12:06] you something grabbed a hold of your
[1:12:09] life and it wasn't you it was
[1:12:19] God are you with
[1:12:22] me now
[1:12:26] you know a lot of people say they know
[1:12:28] him but they don't know
[1:12:31] him there's a lot of people sit in
[1:12:34] church and they know about
[1:12:37] him but they don't know
[1:12:40] him are you with me I want you to
[1:12:43] understand there's a major
[1:12:46] difference there's a phenomenal
[1:12:48] difference about knowing
[1:12:51] him and really knowing him amen
[1:12:56] are you with me now to know him in one
[1:12:59] one way is
[1:13:01] good but to really know
[1:13:06] him I watch people that get a
[1:13:11] Justified state of their being and
[1:13:14] they'll begin to walk in a Justified
[1:13:20] state but after a little bit you can
[1:13:22] tell that they're just in a Justified
[1:13:25] State and they really know need a a
[1:13:28] deeper
[1:13:29] walk listen I think that is one of the
[1:13:32] things that we must
[1:13:34] get don't stall right amen keep
[1:13:39] going keep asking for more of God go to
[1:13:44] the depths of God I want all that he has
[1:13:47] for
[1:13:51] us when I was thinking on these things I
[1:13:54] I have I Haven even shared this with
[1:13:56] brother Timothy but I was I was I I saw
[1:13:59] a vision a brother Timothy sitting in a
[1:14:03] in a room and somebody was there and and
[1:14:06] they were sitting there and they were
[1:14:07] just talking and they were supposed to
[1:14:10] be a believer and they were just talking
[1:14:12] and and brother Timothy's got a certain
[1:14:14] way about him and he's just the most he
[1:14:17] can relax you and and uh I just love him
[1:14:22] amen and after a little while he just
[1:14:24] said
[1:14:25] you're a Believer but there's something
[1:14:28] really missing in your
[1:14:30] life you need more of the Lord Jesus I'm
[1:14:35] afraid that's too much the case in too
[1:14:38] many
[1:14:38] people are you with me I'm not here to
[1:14:41] throw a rock at you listen if you need
[1:14:43] more of him there's more of him to be
[1:14:47] had and I'd say every one of us here
[1:14:50] want more of the Lord
[1:14:53] Jesus all of us that should be our
[1:14:56] desire this morning I need more of
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:14] him after the death bual and
[1:15:17] resurrection of the
[1:15:19] Lord the disciples were no doubt
[1:15:23] disillusioned amen
[1:15:28] The Treasure of the church has committed
[1:15:32] suicide the
[1:15:35] leader has been hung on a tree and
[1:15:38] they've made all a manner of fun of
[1:15:42] him and not only have they made all
[1:15:44] manner of fun of them they beat him and
[1:15:47] he allowed himself to be beat like no
[1:15:51] other human
[1:15:52] being and they put thorn on his head
[1:15:56] Thorns to which causes Strokes over and
[1:16:00] over
[1:16:02] again and these people that did it was
[1:16:06] mocking and making all kind of fun and
[1:16:10] he allowed
[1:16:12] it to
[1:16:14] happen and then towards the end when
[1:16:16] there was still
[1:16:19] life still life living inside of
[1:16:23] him he turned to a a
[1:16:28] Thief one's making fun and the other one
[1:16:33] is is rebuking the other
[1:16:36] thief and he says remember
[1:16:40] me remember
[1:16:42] me you're talking about a Divine
[1:16:46] moment he had never been in church he
[1:16:49] had never heard this man preach he had
[1:16:52] never saw the blind sea he had never
[1:16:55] seen the lame walk but there was
[1:16:58] something about his
[1:17:01] presence listen he realized I'm worthy
[1:17:05] to be on this cross I'm worthy to die
[1:17:09] like
[1:17:12] this remember me when you come into your
[1:17:19] kingdom and Jesus says this day
[1:17:26] amen folks let me just say this to you
[1:17:29] what words to
[1:17:31] say this
[1:17:34] day this
[1:17:38] day you'll be with me in
[1:17:41] Paradise this day listen it doesn't
[1:17:45] matter what this clock
[1:17:47] says it doesn't matter what this clock
[1:17:50] says this thief in moments
[1:17:56] in moments steps into eternal
[1:18:08] life the disciples see all of
[1:18:11] this and then they watch him forgive
[1:18:17] those forgive
[1:18:21] those who are crucifying spitting on
[1:18:27] him forgive those listen that's not in
[1:18:31] humanity to
[1:18:35] do Humanity holds grudges
[1:18:39] amen Humanity holds very difficult
[1:18:44] things but our King of
[1:18:47] Kings our Lord Our cancering reme
[1:18:52] Redeemer come on forgive those amen cuz
[1:18:57] he's looking past them looking at
[1:19:01] you it's more than a song when I was on
[1:19:05] the cross when he was on the cross I was
[1:19:08] on his
[1:19:13] mind now the
[1:19:17] disciples are
[1:19:20] perplexed listen cuz a lot of times in
[1:19:23] this life you know brother Bram talks
[1:19:25] about you know as a builder the wall can
[1:19:29] go straight and all of a sudden it takes
[1:19:31] a corner there's a lot of people can go
[1:19:34] straight but all of a sudden God just
[1:19:35] changes the
[1:19:37] agenda and there's a lot of people
[1:19:39] that'll walk along with you as long as
[1:19:41] it's straight but when you turn a
[1:19:44] corner amen when you turn a corner all
[1:19:48] of a
[1:19:49] sudden they'll keep going
[1:19:52] straight you know sometimes we think
[1:19:54] well you know but they're my friends in
[1:19:58] the scriptures they walked away
[1:20:01] too so people are going to walk away
[1:20:04] from
[1:20:05] us if you look back at the decades that
[1:20:08] we've been here and the decades that we
[1:20:11] walk with God there's a lot of people
[1:20:13] that set beside of
[1:20:15] us that just only holds you to tell you
[1:20:19] of the eternal life
[1:20:26] hope am I Landing this okay Andrew am I
[1:20:29] Landing
[1:20:31] this
[1:20:34] now I want to say this there's sometimes
[1:20:37] that there is an ultimate important
[1:20:40] thing to be at the right place at at the
[1:20:43] right time amen can I say can I say that
[1:20:46] right it's very important to be at the
[1:20:50] right
[1:20:52] place at the right time
[1:20:55] yeah brother Ron I've got a thousand
[1:20:58] other things to do I
[1:21:00] understand I
[1:21:03] understand but Jesus told them to go to
[1:21:05] the upper
[1:21:06] room and there was 500 no doubt plus 500
[1:21:12] people
[1:21:14] there brother Doug this has one of been
[1:21:17] one of the greatest mysteries of my mind
[1:21:20] what would be more
[1:21:22] important you look looking at the
[1:21:25] resurrected
[1:21:27] Lord you've watched him you've watched
[1:21:30] him hang on the tree you have heard
[1:21:34] you've heard about the women going to
[1:21:36] the
[1:21:38] tomb you've heard about them going to
[1:21:41] put spices on his body and the tomb is
[1:21:46] empty you've heard about him showing up
[1:21:49] with Peter and the other disciples and
[1:21:52] Thomas doubting and he allowed Thomas to
[1:21:55] put his hand in his side so it settles
[1:21:59] the
[1:22:00] question now Jesus is giving his final
[1:22:04] sermon on on Earth in that
[1:22:09] body
[1:22:23] come now let me to say this to you let
[1:22:25] me let me go here cuz I don't think I've
[1:22:27] landed

[1:23:50] into another realm and there he stands
[1:23:55] thank listen brother brandom gave us a
[1:23:56] very
[1:23:58] physical description of what the angel

[1:24:21] service and you get the glimpse of
[1:24:23] seeing the angels of the Lord you get
[1:24:26] that

[1:24:33] realm now you can hold on that for 10
[1:24:36] years 20 years and it would be a special
[1:24:39] time but let me just say greater than

[1:24:47] the pull pit that take thus sayith the
[1:24:52] Lord sir and it deals with your
[1:24:56] heart and all of a sudden God begins to

[1:29:56] amen for one of his
[1:30:03] houses sure he's going to fulfill the
[1:30:06] scripture somewhere and brother

[1:30:09] to fulfill
[1:30:13] it are you with

[1:30:27] to
[1:30:29] be they're on the road to a
[1:30:32] mess they're
[1:30:35] discouraged and a
[1:30:37] stranger catches up with
[1:30:41] them and he walks with
[1:30:44] them and he begin to ask them why are
[1:30:48] you so discouraged have you not
[1:30:51] heard and they begin to disc describe
[1:30:55] the story of Jesus and to describe the
[1:30:58] crucifixion they're going
[1:31:01] home where should they have been they
[1:31:04] should have been with the other
[1:31:05] disciples they should have been at the
[1:31:08] tomb brother B said they should have
[1:31:11] been at the
[1:31:13] tomb all of those disciples should have
[1:31:16] been at the
[1:31:17] tomb but remember when Jesus is here he
[1:31:21] told those girls to come come to his
[1:31:31] tomb to anoint his body knowing he was
[1:31:35] going to be
[1:31:39] gone I could shout a while right
[1:31:42] here I could shout a little while right
[1:31:44] here well brother Ron but does God
[1:31:47] foresee
[1:31:48] things well he went to a
[1:31:51] house that the girl was
[1:31:55] dad knowing he's going to have dinner
[1:31:58] with
[1:32:03] her he went to a tomb that he had walked
[1:32:07] away from for
[1:32:09] days knowing this afternoon I'm going to
[1:32:13] have dinner with
[1:32:15] Lazarus listen John chapter 12 I'm going
[1:32:19] to have dinner with
[1:32:22] Lazarus but the Christ Christian people
[1:32:24] miss the
[1:32:26] point they come on to kill
[1:32:35] Lazarus how many people fight the
[1:32:37] message they missed the
[1:32:46] point brother Ron what's been your
[1:32:48] question to them all through the
[1:32:50] years why are you there amen come
[1:32:55] on why are you where you are questioning
[1:32:59] the
[1:33:00] message that's right why are you

[1:33:15] message I hope I hope I'm
[1:33:18] M so he begins to join himself to these
[1:33:21] guys
[1:33:24] now he's going to walk six
[1:33:26] hours with those those
[1:33:31] disciples and here's my point they're
[1:33:34] not even going to realize who's walking
[1:33:37] with
[1:33:39] them did you just catch that last
[1:33:42] statement there's a lot of times he's
[1:33:44] walking with you and you don't even
[1:33:47] realize
[1:33:54] he's been walking with me for five
[1:34:00] years he been walking with me for five
[1:34:02] years I would hate to think that I've
[1:34:04] had to face cancer by
[1:34:08] myself this listen folks this is not a
[1:34:11] common
[1:34:13] coal are you with me listen they can
[1:34:16] take they can take the x-rays and the
[1:34:18] MRIs and the cancers there they can take
[1:34:21] it of my lungs and the Cancer's
[1:34:25] there the chemo is not driving it away
[1:34:29] they're even talking about moving me to
[1:34:31] a different kind of chemo I'll tell you
[1:34:34] I don't have I don't I'm not don't
[1:34:36] having confidence I love my doctors and
[1:34:39] I appreciate the message but who's
[1:34:41] walking with
[1:34:43] me is the most important thing
[1:34:58] for all those on the internet and those
[1:35:00] here that's been going through some real
[1:35:02] trials I want you to understand you may

[1:35:58] in a couple places he talks about the
[1:36:01] garden and when Adam and Eve was driven
[1:36:04] from the garden and one night he's
[1:36:06] preaching about how that they drove out
[1:36:08] of the garden and then just a couple of
[1:36:10] services later he said the other night I

[1:36:42] limb here and he said they were briefed
[1:36:44] on all the late happenings of the
[1:36:46] crucifixion and the story of the grave
[1:36:48] and the tomb and the women had seen him
[1:36:51] and another one that had seen him and so
[1:36:53] forth they briefed him on that and and
[1:36:56] they he goes right on with the word and
[1:36:58] and he
[1:36:59] quotes himself through the
[1:37:02] word and he says now look in
[1:37:07] Zachariah and he must have quoted
[1:37:10] Zechariah 11 and 12 for he was sold with
[1:37:13] 30 pieces of
[1:37:15] silver was not the
[1:37:17] Messiah supposed to be sold for 30
[1:37:21] pieces of silver
[1:37:24] in Psalms 41 and verse
[1:37:27] 9 listen brother brandham said he quoted
[1:37:30] the word about
[1:37:33] himself and in Psalms
[1:37:36] 41-9 he was betrayed by his
[1:37:39] friends in Zechariah 13 and verse 7
[1:37:43] forsaken by his
[1:37:45] disciples in Psalms 35 And1 Accused by
[1:37:49] false
[1:37:52] Witnesses I could go on and on but he
[1:37:55] spent six
[1:37:58] hours taking the
[1:38:01] scriptures and talking about that he
[1:38:06] fulfilled these
[1:38:11] scriptures I mean was here when brother

[1:38:16] car and remember what they were talking
[1:38:20] about does this ministry

[1:38:27] [Music]
[1:38:29] Elijah and he said about the time that
[1:38:32] they said those things the angel came
[1:38:34] into the
[1:38:36] car listen I've heard him tell it so
[1:38:39] many multiple times and the angel came
[1:38:43] into the car and he said it pressed my
[1:38:46] face against the
[1:38:51] window took my breath
[1:38:54] and I looked toward brother Bram out of
[1:38:56] the corner of my eye and said he was Ash
[1:38:59] and white and his beard was sticking
[1:39:04] straight
[1:39:07] out said that angel was setting
[1:39:11] forward looking back in the
[1:39:19] car what was the conversation they were
[1:39:22] having
[1:39:24] does this ministry
[1:39:30] fulfill I was on a boat with brother
[1:39:33] bisco and I said I've heard you tell it
[1:39:36] one time that there was another boy in
[1:39:39] the
[1:39:39] car right and I've never heard you tell
[1:39:43] it but one time and you just just bumped
[1:39:47] it and said there was another boy in the
[1:39:49] car and he said brother Ron he didn't
[1:39:52] see it
[1:39:56] how far is the distance between the back
[1:40:00] seat and the front
[1:40:02] seat an angel's in the car brother
[1:40:05] brandom's countenance has changed
[1:40:08] brother bisc is pressed against the
[1:40:12] window and listen not only did they see
[1:40:15] an angel but only moments
[1:40:19] later Amen brother brother brandom is
[1:40:22] telling brother bis whenever he comes
[1:40:25] something good always
[1:40:28] happens and they've killed a monster
[1:40:30] animal and it drops in a perfect
[1:40:34] place right I wonder sometimes how many
[1:40:40] people sitting in the same

[1:40:48] many people let me go further how many
[1:40:51] people will sit in these same seat

[1:40:59] resurrection and miss a body
[1:41:03] change listen let's pinch our
[1:41:06] conscience brother R said get desperate

[1:41:11] God I'm not here to play a game with
[1:41:14] you I'm not here to pre preach another

[1:42:25] somebody told me the other day he said
[1:42:27] that ain't the same
[1:42:30] Jimmy that's just not the same Jimmy
[1:42:33] you're
[1:42:34] right I'm not the same
[1:42:36] Ron I pray that you're not the same
[1:42:42] person that's a that's a what's one of
[1:42:45] the greatest compliments that we can get
[1:42:46] brother
[1:42:47] Jimmy we're not the same person
[1:42:55] these these guys walk six hours I'm not
[1:43:00] going to be much longer because I'm
[1:43:01] getting weak walk six
[1:43:05] hours with
[1:43:07] Jesus and they come to a
[1:43:10] spot to where their home
[1:43:15] was and Jesus made as though he was
[1:43:18] going to go
[1:43:20] on and they constrained him
[1:43:24] come
[1:43:25] in come
[1:43:27] in they constrained him to come by he
[1:43:31] knew we was going to their house
[1:43:33] anyway but he was waiting on their
[1:43:38] response he was waiting on their
[1:43:41] response God's waiting on our response
[1:43:46] [Applause]
[1:43:58] it's more than just walking in and
[1:44:00] sitting down in a
[1:44:02] Pew I never want this church to be just
[1:44:05] another intellectual dead church I want
[1:44:09] this church to be a house of prayer and
[1:44:13] a house of worship and a place where we
[1:44:16] con strain
[1:44:18] him where we wash his feet where we
[1:44:22] worship Him
[1:44:30] and he comes
[1:44:35] in and he comes in
[1:44:38] and and the bread comes to the
[1:44:44] table now it was a
[1:44:47] custom that the head of the house broke
[1:44:52] the bread
[1:44:56] the father breaks the
[1:45:04] bread can you imagine that moment that
[1:45:07] Jesus Walks steps across and he takes
[1:45:11] the bread and he begins to break
[1:45:15] it now brother brandham said he did it
[1:45:18] like he had did it
[1:45:20] before but not only did he do it like he
[1:45:23] did
[1:45:24] before but he took his place as the
[1:45:33] head and brother Brandon preaches he
[1:45:36] preaches multiple sermons and he said
[1:45:40] and
[1:45:41] then their eyes were
[1:45:45] opened and then their eyes were open
[1:45:48] notice the scripture as it comes down it
[1:45:50] said did not our hearts burn with within
[1:45:54] us as he spake to us along the
[1:45:58] way but they missed it for six hours and
[1:46:02] in a
[1:46:04] moment oh God help us in a moment when
[1:46:09] he breaks the bread
[1:46:14] Glory the story was never the same from
[1:46:18] that point
[1:46:20] on what an intellectual sermon after 6
[1:46:23] hours but in a
[1:46:27] moment with a Divine
[1:46:30] appointment they
[1:46:32] realize that's
[1:46:38] him that's
[1:46:47] him I said in a service
[1:46:58] I was a young
[1:47:01] convert a young
[1:47:04] convert I'm going to be who's 22 here 22
[1:47:09] 23 somewhere in that
[1:47:12] range
[1:47:17] Anna you're wearing it well
[1:47:24] and we go to a place and my dad says I
[1:47:26] want you to hear a preacher preach his
[1:47:30] name's Ed
[1:47:31] bisco I want you to hear a preacher
[1:47:34] preach and he said you heard him in
[1:47:36] 1978 but I want you to hear him again so
[1:47:40] we drive about four
[1:47:42] hours on Sunday
[1:47:47] morning and we walk into this nice
[1:47:50] church and sister Connie was a kid
[1:47:56] and she walks into the and they go the
[1:47:59] young people go to Sunday
[1:48:02] school and they all of a sudden Connie's
[1:48:05] gone to Sunday

[1:48:14] gone they put my mom and dad in a
[1:48:16] different
[1:48:18] spot and I'm setting about where you
[1:48:21] are brother Bisal comes out and steps up
[1:48:24] on the
[1:48:27] stage and I'm sitting there there's a
[1:48:29] lot of things in my mind I've been a
[1:48:33] convert two
[1:48:35] months two
[1:48:38] months and I'm sitting there and in my
[1:48:42] carnal flesh I'm I'm aggravated cuz they
[1:48:45] took my wife to Sunday
[1:48:50] school and I'm sitting there my father
[1:48:53] and mother they've took them to a
[1:48:54] different place of the building and they
[1:48:56] put me
[1:48:58] here and and I begin to think in my mind
[1:49:03] what I'm preaching to you right now God
[1:49:05] has orchestrated this whole
[1:49:09] day and God has put me on the second
[1:49:16] row and upfront close to where I can get
[1:49:22] what the preacher is
[1:49:23] preaching I'm telling you from my
[1:49:26] heart and a youngl looking Ed bu bisco
[1:49:30] steps out on the
[1:49:32] stage and he's just bouncing you know
[1:49:36] I'm expecting an older
[1:49:38] preacher kind of slow in he speaking I'm
[1:49:42] expecting an older man to
[1:49:45] preach and he begins to preach there's
[1:49:48] probably 400 people in the
[1:49:50] building and it is
[1:49:53] as though he's preaching to
[1:50:00] me amen I relayed this to him several
[1:50:06] times and you know what his statement
[1:50:08] was to him to
[1:50:11] me it was a Divine appointment for you
[1:50:15] brother
[1:50:20] Ron and he preached
[1:50:25] on the
[1:50:26] seals the breach between the church ages
[1:50:30] and the
[1:50:31] seals and it was preaching in a
[1:50:34] church that was missing the
[1:50:39] message but I
[1:50:42] didn't hallu I don't care how many
[1:50:45] hundred is said in the meeting don't
[1:50:49] miss I told you that story for a real
[1:50:52] reason said don't

[1:51:09] branham's
[1:51:11] meeting and he was telling the woman at
[1:51:13] the well now I'm finished he was telling
[1:51:16] the woman at the well musicians can come
[1:51:19] he's telling the woman at the well
[1:51:24] and all of a sudden he begins to call
[1:51:26] your
[1:51:29] name Chris
[1:51:32] Morris you're from Harrisonburg Virginia
[1:51:36] now you know that but now you are
[1:51:39] realizing God knows that you've never
[1:51:43] seen that man before in your life and he
[1:51:46] tells you about 14 different
[1:51:50] things about yourself that he knows
[1:51:55] exactly about you and he tells your zip
[1:52:00] code and he tells you your
[1:52:03] address and he tells you about your
[1:52:06] children and your
[1:52:08] wife brother Ron but you're just making
[1:52:11] that up listen we had brother Tom Brady
[1:52:14] here how many remember brother Tom
[1:52:19] Brady and brother Tom Brady told it over
[1:52:22] and over
[1:52:24] again his mind has slipped now he can
[1:52:26] never do that again but he stood here in
[1:52:29] this pull
[1:52:30] pit and he told us about what is the
[1:52:33] attraction on the mountain and his wife
[1:52:35] has written him a letter and it's about
[1:52:38] her
[1:52:39] feet he hadn't told that to
[1:52:42] nobody and he's sitting there and
[1:52:45] brother Brown calls him out Mr
[1:52:50] Brady from
[1:52:56] me listen if brother Brandon misses one
[1:53:01] time you wouldn't believe
[1:53:04] it listen this was more than a
[1:53:07] gift listen don't discredit it's just a
[1:53:11] gift this was God to this
[1:53:14] generation and if the world misses it so
[1:53:17] what we didn't miss it
