special yday my what a service that we had last night oh don't you thank the Lord that the silence is over we've seen Christ revealed in hi in Simplicity revealed right here amongst us and it's over today it's my greatest honor to introduce my precious friend brother Tom Ray and many of you know my story many of you don't but if it had not been for this man the very dynamics of this church would be completely different my marriage would be completely different this church everything about it would be completely different for the last 18 years now because a [Music] man because a man was l the Lord to say the right things in the right moment even on the streets in one of the busiest towns God came looking for me when I may have not have been looking for him he used a man by the name of Thomas Ray to come and speak directly to my heart now God could because we recognize that we are predestinated seeds God could have used any way to get a hold of us but he chose he could have got the trees to preach the gospel to me he could have got the winds but he chose who he redeemed a Son of God to come and speak the right words his ministry is well known around the world but it's really well known right here in Full Gospel Lighthouse and I just want to say what a blessing it is to have the man of God that has led me to the Lord to be here at our home church we were so blessed last year by brother Michael and brother Tom's Ministry we are so blessed again this year and if it's okay with you we'd like to continue the path that we're [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] on you think about the patriarch brother bisc that had a vision about a camp brother Ron's testimony of coming out of the fire brother Joel and myself being birth into the kingdom of God on the same day you can't make these things up you so what what's the major connection let me say the Eternal is what is the connection this is more than friends this is more than love this is this is a Holy Connection that God set up and it is our greatest honor to introduce brother Tom today we want him to have his complete Liberty here this morning and to preach the word of God that God has laid upon his heart let's have the key of fsis ke I'm sorry I sing praises to your name oh god oh praises to your name oh Lord for your name is great and great to be prais and I sing praises to your name oh Lord oh praises to your name oh Lord for your name is great and great to be praised let's sing it one more time as brother Tom come this morning I sing praises and I sing praises [Music] PR could we just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly [Music] Father many of us could call you my Father Who Art in Heaven so Lord we have come to this time to gather around this glorious word to feed off your table Lord and that you might speak deeply to the hearts of your children we don't want to be gathered in vain but we've come to the house of God to lift up that lovely one that Holy one that righteous one so bless your children Lord open the word to us Lord give us eyes s to see and ears to hear what the spirit would say father we love your presence it means so much to us Lord bless your people I pray are your pastor brother Ron Brother Andrew the officers musicians God may this be a a very special time in your presence Lord we love you pray thy will be done in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you nice to see you all sunshiny faces all the glow presence of God well I thank you brother Andrew and brother Ron for this opportunity amen uh I feel very special not the fact that I'm special but I have special friends and sister Connie and sister Nancy you mean a lot to us might not get as much recognition am but you are you are jewels in the crown of our Lord Jesus Christ and we love you for it love you love the family of God love this church love what God is doing and we had a tremendous message last night I just wanted to say ditto I said the story back home years ago and Sam and I my oldest son and I have the privilege to have my my darling wife my three lovely boys and their darling wives with Meen Sam and I were well you know as they get a little older he try to teach them how to pray and and uh you know Sam his darling and KN kneeling beside Daddy and uh you know I said honey this you just followed daddy dear Jesus dear Jesus we love you Lord we love you Lord and all of a sudden I go you're the Mighty God you're the one that spreads from eternity to Eternity and Joann's standing at the door she says when is he going to be quiet and actually I went on for about 2 or 3 minutes and Sam said same that's the way so I say same you know as you get older you get younger right so I I'm I'm thrilled to see men of God of that caliber amen and you know the Rock chair looks pretty good right about now but we're thankful to the Lord and what he's done in our lives uh everybody has a different kind of ministry and and I have I have cherished the friendship and Ministry of brother Ron and now seeing brother Andrew it just it blesses my soul it's helped my family it saved my sons it's done everything to me my father-in-law brother Ron you've meant the world to us and and you know we can say these things but I want you to feel my heart come on I don't want you hear my words I want you to hear my heart and a prophet was without honor in his own country but we cherish your pastor we cherish their Ministry you say well that's what just brother so and so no it's not on no it's not and they've done so much for me I had the ability to say the other day to brother Ron David and Jonathan were very special I'm not David but I know I might be a Jonathan brother Ron you're my David and I love you for that thank you for making us feel so at home these oh yeah last few years and what are we nothing but sons of God saved by grace it's all by grace and you know brother Michael he preached he I used to say did I used to move like that I mean he covered the platform and then I saw a gate opening here and I thought he was going to cover the uh the sanctuary but but it was lovely amen I I told brother Ron years ago I'm getting older and slower for these and uh I love his people and if we can deposit just something that's all I'm not a speaker but I love the Lord and I love this message and what people don't understand it's one and the same that's what they do don't get they go to an extreme this way and they go to an extreme that way but I love what God shows us God himself veiled in a Prophet comeing this generation to find me to find me and so this morning uh just a little thought would you mind taking your Bibles and thank you again for making us feel so at home but I'd like to turn to John 14 very familiar scripture of course you won't hear anything new but you'll if the Lord would help us maybe as my brother Michael was saying last night if we can just get that pipeline of Revelation down into our hearts changes everything and how many of us can testify you came to a service one day and all of a sudden the preacher goes a different way and it seems like you're in nowhere's Ville and the Holy Spirit comes to your vill and touches you and you go how did that happen because he loves you and he loves you so much he came personally to you in this gener generation it you know we we say well God sent a prophet and yes indeed he did but it was God in a prophet and I had the privilege and ability to be able to be with our dear pastor bisc and you know God in flesh in in a prophet sat it beside him and in a log somewhere and and and that's that becomes almost a story because we've heard it but I want you to understand that that same God came to me right we we we look at it in a historical form but that same God came to you right and is here this morning right to move you right into another channel that you have not experienced and all I can say I feel the pull and I hear the call and I want to come up higher higher in Christ and I'm a type of preacher that watches you so if you fall asleep I know you I know if you're responding or not and and it doesn't matter whether you're in the corner or way over here I watching you boys last night my goodness I wish I was that young in this presence I didn't get Sav till I was 21 but I always wanted God from a young boy and to think these boys have the privilege to hear what they hear and experience the atmosphere that they do parents God bless you for raising children such as this amen and may God bless your homes yes you want me to keep you standing all day I can do that too I would will be as brother bisc always used to say hey well I'm standing you might as well stand with me well we'll get you seated Psalm uh Psalms John's Chapter 14 verse one like I said I want you to feel my heart this morning let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me that in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you verse 13 and whatsoever you shall ask now let's let's forget about this Bible being written 2,000 years ago because that word is Christ and that Christ is alive right so now he's speaking to us from his word himself now I'm looking at you and you might have a need this morning we can get lost in the crowd and feel so alone but I want them to come down to your Pew I want him to speak to you as one brother said the other day if you can get a hold of two mocking kids in another room and the presence of God come down and say to a lovely sister whatsoever you desire ask anything yes sir we've seen it manifested in our day and so let me say he can manifest it this morning amen and I don't care where you are right now this is the word of God to your soul whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I who's reading your Bible with me whatsoever you ask in my name that I might do what did he say whatsoever you ask in my name in this manifested word of your hour is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and if you ask anything now don't put it to the preachers I'm putting it down into your lap right now I don't care if you're a mother a single brother I don't care if you're a single sister I don't care if you're married or whatever the case may be whether you're a grandparent whether you're old or whether you're young my Bible says whosoever ask anything in my name you shall have it but the Bible says in this scripture I will do and my God does not lie so I don't care where you are right now and I don't care what need you have right now why don't you just bow your head and say Lord this is my need you said you'll do it if I ask you want to raise your hand you want to lift up both hands Lord do it this morning heavenly father as we've read your word I pray God you'll take it inscribe it move them Lord into the promises of God for their yay and amen to them that believe whether it be myself here at the pulpit in need and body brother precious brother Ron I know you're a miracle working God and I know your wonders are to be performed and so father would you touch each one as we look into your word this morning we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats God bless you I'm sorry brother Andrew got me going got me going I've been and my family have been made so welcome we don't want to leave you but but we have a church where's brother Michael and brother Tom and their wives and children oh they're way up in Virginia well they want to of course bring their greetings to you or we have a precious body there that amen and we they love you very much I get it all the time I get walking through the church and the lobby and then I go through the back and I go to the Pastor study and and the brothers will stop me and said oh we heard brother Ron Brother Andrew I said oh brother what am I going to say and so then afterwards they said do you know what whatever they preach you preached I go my goodness that gives me a little bit of encouragement I said we're in the channel the body's in the channel H amen she's not a disjointed body the word is the same whether it be in British Columbia Canada in Virginia Florida it doesn't matter this message is alive Hallelujah the word is unfolding we're becoming the word right well she receives a word she becomes the word now we're a little bit older in in you know I I I got a terrible habit don't I mind sorry brother Ron I'm old fashion they said they books I got it taped and raped you can't tape an iPad you can't do it just won't work but I got this taped and underline and you know when you read it I said why did I put blue it should have been green CU I got a different coded in different things but you know as you go in life the word opens up and so then what you thought was really real at that time is really real now and started now I start to say okay the son of man's been revealed but now it's back into the church so don't look to 1965 I want you to look to this morning that this Jesus this son of man is in [Applause] [Music] you we can talk about brother Bram a son of man but it was a son of man revealing the son of man and the son of man is in you and now a the son of man himself is living in your flesh amen what's on the inside of your skin I'm going to get right down to you listen we can we can dance on bubbles we can shout hallelujah with the best of them and that's nothing wrong I love it I love it you got no emotion you're dead these people that want no emotion you know why they're dead and then we can swing on the other side and be all emotion but no word right but I'll take word in Emotion any day amen I'll take where the word of God's Alive and I can have people stand up in your seat say that's nothing but the truth preacher nothing but the truth and you watch God come in your life you don't fall asleep you get up you say that's the word as he heard last night this is not a silent gospel this gospel is suering forth and where is the final voice where's the final voice to the final age we say that we got the final voice to the final age and a lot of you got it right here but I want to get it right here this morning I want it to move from 11 Ines here to here say just a second that word is living in me then what he did I'll do amen there it is amen that's what the word said you should lay hands on the sick and they is that the truth ask anything in my name and you shall that's right so you tell me why we got a problem we got no problem God's in control of everything we worry about that we build Bridges as we heard and finally get there and there is no Bridge God's already closed the Gap amen amen I see what you did I haven't even got my notes out don't you love church man I go pie all these Church churches coming up here said man I've never seen so many churches or more I mean in churches that's I see graveyards in every one of them they go there they die they go there they die well hey guess what we're going up amen this is a Rapture message and nobody's going anywhere without me come on bud that's right amen yes amen well let's turn to Genesis 1 we might as well start there Michael covered Genesis the Revelation he left me one scripture and Genesis 111 isn't it Grand you know there's a clock up there so I'll take my clock off so at least I know that the emergency won't come and get me every time I start preaching you dying SOS problem of it is I'm living do you need me [Applause] no yeah did you dial SOS this morning Lord save my soul you know you think about it I mean I I we come from Vancouver Canada and and brother Ron says to me he says you know you'll see a couple of hospitals as you're driving down this way your tiny hospitals are bigger than our big hospitals but all they're intended to do is to help people and that's a good thing right but we come to church that King Jesus will help us am amen so if they do it for the natural man surely the Lord who is the great physician now is here the sympathizing Jesus then that Jesus is present now amen first Samuel I said first Samuel first uh Genesis 1 first chapter in the beginning in the beginning what does it say in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth I was on the airplane one day and there was a businessman and I got bumped up the business class and I'm sitting here and say oh this is how they live I go this is nice linen and all that sort of stuff and I was reading my Bible and he says I can't understand that Bible I said what's wrong with [Applause] you it's a love story what I said it's a the Bible it's God in print well I don't understand God I said I do well how do you do I said God sent a prophet to open the Bible to us well he says I got a problem with Genesis 1:1 I said I don't hallelu he says well you know how does that all work the bi you know science says the Earth is here for for billions of years I says you're not reading your Bible right come on that's right I I said let me help you read Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth period did it say billions billions it's period it's whatever length of time he wanted oh he says I never s that way before I said stick with me that's right it's totally right so God in the beginning created the Heaven and the Earth that's omnipotence that God is Elohim Almighty amen so now when we say God you say well brother Tom we use the the term God and God lives in me well then who's living in you on the god that created the heavens and the Earth is living in you so what's your problem I told you I'm going to get down to your address because I I actually believe this we all go through some horrific things we all go through horrific things but if you understand that God's living in your life then he's in control of everything that I go through so then everything that I go through means it's for my good amen that's right so everything I go you say that's bad who says it's bad come on you know we all we always want to class things as bad and you find out at the end of the at the end of the road as the doors started to open up that was God

figured out the plays they should have done this you should have done that well you you get on the field all you would be is a grease spot but we always look at things after the fact let's get in the

it because he came he wasn't looking to 2,000 years ago he was looking at the one that was coming right to the pulpit then Jesus came can I say to you this morning then Jesus came uhhuh he's the same what was he with a prophet has he left is he with us then Jesus came then Jesus is here okay Jesus is here The Works that I do shall you do also and the greater than this shall you do for I go to my father so you can do the Greater Works what is Greater Works he said watch the council tighten up what's that third pole then the spoken word you say well brother what you've seen in part what you've seen in part have we seen the spoken word we abs absolutely have don't get quiet on me you know I can say it happened in my life I've spoke the word of God I've claimed my boys I know that they're here I've claimed their children and I know they're here you say does God have favorites I have a granddaughter she comes every day into my house whenever she walks in she says grandfather cuz they know if they say grandfather they get a double inheritance she's a smart one she's a smart one [Laughter] grandfather and I love her dearly God loves us all the same amen he loves us all the same and so if he''s done something for a brother across the aisle he'll do it for you that's right he did it for the brother across the aisle for you yeah well how come he did it for him well because he did it for him so you could get what he got amen God's Got No favorites it doesn't matter what happens in this church it's for everybody it's for everybody all right we're just laying a little Foundation okay this is just this is my opening comments all right he says now the works that I do shall you do also I don't want it to be a quote I want it to be here that's right that's where I want it to go right down in your heart right now you said you Sav brother Tom's children you've change you've changed his life do you know what I was and I don't even want to tell you what I was but if God could do it for me that's right he can do it for you but this the thing that I I always go back to I was a fouryear old boy wanting God and had nowhere to go a little boy of four years old my mom and dad were having a little cocktail party at at a Christmas Eve and or I'm sorry boxing day you don't have boxing day but it's the day after Christmas in Canada we call it Boxing Day really doesn't take too much of intelligence you get a lot of boxes so they give you a day to get rid of the boxes whatever so they're over at the house and they're having their little thing together and they our our boys have heard it often but but this is real to me this morning a four years de old boy and I got a fire engine I'm sorry a dump truck I wanted a fire engine a dump truck a dump truck fire engine dad what are you thinking so they're all over and they're all saying and my sister got a nurses thing with you know the stethoscope and a little thing and a little cape and a little hat and she's going to be a nurse and of course Tommy what do you want to be you want to be a policeman of course were a fireman I said I never got my fire truck but I love that little old dumb truck and so they said well what do you want to be when you grow up I don't we don't have you know our TVs in the Dark Ages had fuzz you know those that know what I'm talking about raise your hand then we know how old you are you know you put it on there bunch of black and white do thoughts and you try to see a figure then the antenna you got to go up on the roof stay up there right and so you know I don't so I haven't seen an evangelist I don't go to church my mom and dad don't go to church I don't have nothing but they said what do you want to be when you grow up Tom what do you want to be I said I want to be a preacher they go what ruined their party but when you're Prophet says that you've got a seed in you that came from almighty God and in the beginning he laid out that seed on the earth and knew you would be living in this generation and knew you would come to a harvest time and what he is you are [Applause] Hallelujah and so when I saw the word in flesh I didn't understand the word my friend gets saved I didn't understand what he's talking about you need to be G born again what's born again I didn't know what born again was all I knew that he was a party Monger like I was a party monger and God got a hold of him and he went to church and I admired the god in him I said that's the God that I want and guess what God did to me he saved me he saved me and gave me the desire of my heart right since a little boy and God had a way of putting me through the the channel to get me to the place where the word of God would become alive and this morning God has no favorites I might have realized that at four years old and had to go through a journey maybe you have to go through a different Journey but nevertheless there's a gene in you that God is going to get a hold of and bring to full manifestation according to the word of the Lord amen listen to what he says now he says anyone knows you can't do the Greater Works than he did it's quantity quantity now listen cuz he was there in one person God was represented in one person now he's represented the fullness of God he says in desperation dwells within the church you're the representation of his word the universal church so it's more than this shall you do for I go to the father yet a little while and the world won't see me no more the world Cosmos means the world order the world will see me no more yet ye who's ye that's where we're got to get to who's ye who's ye a greater than this shall Ye Ye Ye well I I'm not a deacon who cares come on I'm not a preacher's wife who cares come on come on sisters Brethren we're getting down to your address now because it doesn't say trust these wives or trustees deacons now they have a place in the body we get that but now we're talking about the universal body called The Bride of Jesus Christ and if you're one of them you are one of the ye resist your own thought remember this Revelation Jesus Christ series remember this Christ in his true church is not will be is a continuation of the book of Acts okay shall I start that over over again Christ in the true church now who's the true church oh who's the true church I'm the church amen did you go to church or did you bring church with you that's right on that's right okay I'll preach to the baptismal tank huh so who's the true church I got one I got two I used to be as I told you before I'm an Auctioneer old auctioneer I got three do I see four come on huh come on I want 100% who's the church I'm the church and the true church is a continuation of the book of Axe Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have Glory this is better this is better than the baseball game isn't it yes sir come on yeah you know the trouble with a baseball game is always a loser that's right that's the problem with a football game and a basketball game there's always a loser but let me tell you you've already won you've already won a prophet saw you in another dimension and he says I saw you there saw me there saw you there I thought Michael was going to take my last quote he says oh you've already made it right now let okay you the ones that stood you sit and the ones that didn't stand stand thank you I feel like I'm a conductor huh why don't we all stand huh I'm the church I'm already there I'm the continuation a prophet was talking about Hallelujah wh what are you thinking brother Tom I don't know but I was with Peter that day yes sir that's right it never was spoken before Silver and Gold Have I None where did that inspiration come from come on sometimes you got to get some real inspiration uh-huh I claim it I believe it honey honey they're coming come on you could be driving down the highway you could be changing your tire you could be washing the dishes I don't care what you do you confess it you resist the devil [Applause] amen we're getting warmed up now I'm getting I'm I'm getting all that chalk on the hands right now I'm ready to pitch a few balls hey and I don't want you to strike out I want you to hit a home [Applause] run curve ball that's what some preachers give you know they hold their Knuckles a certain way their arms as long as the pitch no wonder they strike them out huh but we got coordination we got the mind of God and when that word comes across our plate we just say amen and I heard the church say [Applause] Amen all these fancy things that they try to throw at us no no sir he says that's right we it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word and you have seen it in full force huh there is a prophet prophesying and telling you it come to a time where that book of Acts Church would come on display and they will discredit your life when you're living pure holy Sanctified they'll call good bad and bad good this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your ear true church that's what she is that's what she stands for she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army now are we ready to roll up our sleeves she will be an invincible Army so then when the Creditor come comes to take away your land show him your account was paid long ago you have the abstract title deed and Satan you can't come on my property that's right so now we're going to use quotes that will be familiar with you but we'll put it in your lap because the devil's going to come as soon as you go through that door some sisters I'm going to shake your hand and you're going to get now tell me who's ever done that before so I'm not looking at anybody or if brother Ron didn't shake my hand today he must be angry at me come on look how big your church is he shook everybody's hand he been wore out is that right I mean my you know people it's funny thing I had this sister f me out she says brother Tom I saides she said this is Sister St so I said yes she says I just want to ask you to forgive me I said why she says you didn't shake my hand the other day I said what I didn't even see you she said that was the problem other people got in my way I said sister I'm sorry for your inconvenience I said you didn't have the phone you're forgiven and you know devil plays with people's minds but we're resistors resist it nobody's got anything against you as a matter of fact everybody here loves you amen she'll be an invisible Army if they get a real revelation of the spirit within the framework of the church getting a real revelation of the spirit that works within the church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit so now we're going to name it that which causes dissension is Antichrist but she's an invincible Army okay so now because she's Invincible Satan stands powerless give me that old time religion give me that old and just give me that Rel and it will make you love your it will make you love your sister will make you love your pastor and it's good enough for [Music] [Applause] me so are we all have we got the devil out of here yet let me check this section we got the devil out okay I'm looking on come have you got the devil out yep they got it out brother Ron I love that response I'm just checking you out now you got the devil out of here come on come on we can have church now we can have church now we're freeorn we're liberated Hallelujah we've resisted him and we sent him on his way Glory now put a smile on your face that helps me all right so we did it Devil's on here he's sitting on of steps out there and when you go out there you say get off my steps and when he comes and sits on your car get off my car we're resistors we're resisting to Satan every time Satan throws anything on you rebuke it Satan's Army brings diseases God's Army are Commission right to cast them out do we believe that church we absolutely believe it I don't care where he hides you cannot hide from the Holy Ghost period period that's right he says cast it out that's the very technique that God used Satan used the army of Destruction to believe disbelieve God's word and to set him up a better Kingdom than Michael but God cast him out now we're going back to First Genesis 1 then God cast them out at that day you will know that I am in the Father the father's in me I in you you and you in me brother Ram said that's this day all that God was he poured into Christ right everybody still with me now we just boot the devil out don't get quiet on me now this is where you should be rejoicing all that God was in Genesis 1 amen came in John 114 was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so all that God was he poured into Christ all that he poured into Christ he poured into the church now listen to me somehow Satan gets in there and says well then if God's in all the church he's a little diminished there because there's so many in the church well let me let me just take you back to Deuteronomy when Moses and Jethro said you take too much on you Moses call out 70 men and that the spirit of God but re on them but the scripture goes on to say and it did not diminish what was on Moses so all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into you so let me ask you a question where is [Applause] God what can God do the [Music] impossible I loved in perfect faith brother R said I'm trying to to raise your faith a little higher I'm trying to raise a little higher you want discernment but I'll tell you this why don't you just walk by me and I'll lay hands on you and in the name of Jesus Christ you're healed in the name of Jesus Christ you're healed he said will you believe they said yes we will brother brandom so I got it on the tape brother Joe and it said 168 of them walked by walked by walked by and every every one of them went back to their seat and when they went back to their seat brother Brandon finished the message and said well are you all healed yeah and they all stood to their feet and raised their hands said we're all healed brother brandham why they took God at his word you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you shall pick up by serent a serpent and Sh not hurt thee right Paul proved it so the word is true the word is is magnificent I wish I had the English language to describe how powerful and how great he is so God's method is then cast him out cast out those little thoughts that come by your way just cast them out why entertain them why build the nest why let the bird build the nest get just get rid of them okay just get rid of them cast down reasoning cast down superstitions cast down worry cast down diseases cast down sin amen you're above it you're resurrected in Christ that's how he put it he said you're just resurrected in Christ it's all it's all done so brother Ron's going to come back to church brother Andrew's going to come back to church and it's going to be a totally Victorious church because it's all done their phone won't ringl he should have been saying that Hallelujah but I'll take it Hallelujah phone won't ring oh Rong brother Rong brother Andrew you'd only know if this only happened to me what are you talking about Where's God so I I I want I want to get it if the Holy Spirit would help me into your life right so it's in action right it's not just in mental concept it's in Living Word a lot of people put Living Word brother Bisal said to me they got Living Word on their church he said they're not Living Word that's what I did brother Ron that's exactly what I did what are you telling us I didn't say anything I just laughed and smiled like he said you don't have to say anything amen if you're living the word your life will God will back it up and vindicate it I love this quote and forgive me for laying down the Long Foundation give way Satan what's the matter soldiers don't you think we can conquer he's already conquered and we are more than Victors in Jesus Christ and every devil is cast out everything else is gone amen our lord said his disciples have faith in God for if you say ye say to this mountain be moved be moved it shall move Satan you know the scriptures on this I have taught this people now think about it how many hundreds of hours of messages have you heard now I'm not talking about background noise right I'm talking about you sitting in your chair and listening to the tapes and a prophet pouring out his heart and he's saying Satan you know the scriptures on that I've taught this people that God is in them why don't you start flexing some muscles around here come come on yeah that's it you know we're not pressing dumbbells come on and that's exactly what they are I said yep your name correctly and I'm not picking you [Laughter] up they call him dumbell so we're not picking up dumbbells we're picking up the word of God we're picking up the word of God he said Satan you know the scripture on it I've taught the people this that God is in them and then if God is in them they can speak to that disease and say be away from me amen be away from me oh but look at you you got sick brother Ram got sick right I mean are we immune to sickness no but we're not immune by resisting on we can resist the devil he hasn't caught the Revelation yet but he's got to flee that's right hold on for dear life he's still got to flee he might have his fingernails still stuck in there but he's got to let go because the word of God said so so now let me ask I won't look I won't look and you don't even have to look raise your hand I've taught the people this I've taught Tau the people this God's in them I've taught the people this and you've heard me preach now for almost for 55 minutes you poor people but for 55 minutes you've heard about God being in you and resisting the devil but will you forget it when you leave here tonight today come come and this is where we want to go this is where we want to go oh we got a great service and The Inspired preacher was inspired and the and the brothers were rejoicing and and I I even said amen but what did brother Ron preach last week uh I'm sorry I said this at home so don't worry we have a deacon back there he knows and we have a minister here so I can't lie not that I want to I thought I'd clarify that one but but it's true we get inspired and and we get under the inspiration of one another and we get get so enthused and what did Michael mean or what did he say or what did Brother Andrew say what did Tom brother Tom preach about you resist him because God's in you can you do me one favor because you know they say you talk to an audience that they'll they'll they'll remember 35 to 40% but if they reiterate it back it goes up to about 60% if I had a chalkboard I'd throw it there you retain it 80% amen can I can I ask you to do one thing for me just say one word for me resist resist what did Brother Pro brother Tom preach on what there you go you might not remember any quote but now here's one you can remember God's in me God's in me God's in me and Satan you're a liar that's right the truth can't be found in you God's word is true Okay you Okay uh let me give you an example brother Andrew you've preached at our church we've had prayer lines and people have gotten healed why did they get healed it was not brother Andrew who was it our precious pastor and friend brother Ron has prayed for my children and my pastor brother bisc pray for our church and God has moved in Supernatural ways was that brother Ron or God in him God brother Joe god brother William god brother Matthew God mark this has got to be God so when you walk out of here today who's walking out of here you say oh that's not deep enough oh that's deep enough he said you didn't get it in everything that's deep enough come on you walk out of here in Victory that's deep enough you say he didn't break the word like you're supposed to break the word this is deep enough hallelujah hallelujah if these young men could catch a revelation that they're born again f with the Holy Ghost then God's walking in their flesh we had a School a high school of 800 and three little girls walked into that school turned it upside down long hair long dresses and we're a bunch of EX hippies walking around thinking we're cool but when God walked in we saw God uhhuh and here I am standing here because God walked into our school right yep when you start catching a revelation of who you are in Christ Jesus that you are indeed a temple of what a temple of the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost God I'll just keep on going around until you actually start believing it if you start believing it change this church will change the body of Christ will change when she realizes who she is then we'll be gone God bless you you can have your seats God bless you this is what we're preaching for we're preaching to get out of a job uhuh there's a whole row for us over there that's right and we're going to watch you that never rejoiced oh yeah that's right that's right you never open your mouth never smiled or said amen and we're going to go remember them amen look at them they're Fanatics over here well I don't want to be different I'll have a new body but I'll have the same character uh-huh uhhuh amen I want to be like him I've been invited to have my character molded to his divine nature that's been my invitation that's your invitation we still got some time you notice I didn't say 5 minutes I learned my lesson I kept on saying I'll give give me five minutes and the kids are gone Daddy's lying again or he's he's stretching the truth can I say so in the beginning I'm going to get you to in the beginning again we just got on God didn't we okay come on resistors come on we're going to resist him we're going to let him know that that God that was in Genesis 1 is in me I'm not just coming to a church of brother Ron and brother Andrew Pastor I'm coming and letting the devil know I am the Church of God though all men forsake me come on come on I am the Church of God yes sir Genesis 1 let's read it again let's read it again Genesis 1:1 let's read it out loud and clear in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth right perfect that's perfect all right so now listen to what brother Ram says can I can I quote a prophet of course they can I'm I know I can't I'm just asking a factious question in my commission now I'm just your brother but by the grace of God when the angel of the Lord moves down then I am the voice of God to you maybe it offended you by saying that forgive me I felt that might have been resented so let me say it again you might be offended at a little man from Cloverdale Bible Way came down to your little church and trying to tell you who you are in Christ Jesus you might be offended but I'll say it again I'll say it again when God comes down I am the voice of God to you well you see that was brother brandham where is The Voice she is the final voice to the final age that might offend you so I'll say it again if I've offended you by saying that forgive me I felt that that might have been resented I am the God's voice to you I say that again that time was under inspiration you see I felt about it the first time but I repeated it again and you might you might feel bad what we preach over the pulpit then why is he repeating it because maybe you felt bad and he wanted you to get it again unusual thinking man's filter I've seen the light I've turned around and there stood seven golden Candlestick standing up there on top of the mountain with a rainbow that was coming up through the pipes and feeding out immediately after that the Lord Jesus appeared to us and right then I heard the voice say Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament amen there it is after a while it's revealed through those seven golden candlesticks through those Messengers God was revealing Jesus of the old or Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new all that God was he poured into Christ so God Elohim the one who stood but in front of Abraham's tent is the same one that's standing right before your tent right there now what are you going to do you can sit there and look at me and play dumb or you can say hey I got to kill a fatted calf I got to give my sacrifice a praise come on he sacrific had to kill a cal huh he sacrificed to have God speak to him amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen yes God rich in Mercy comes by our tent but this God so Jehovah the oldest Jesus of the new we've caught that Mighty Revelation that's come for me and you as a songwriter said but Jehovah of the old is the I am is that true it's true Jehovah Elohim I am who shall I say sent me I am sent me sent you I am what a name I am what did Jesus say oh we'll get there I am he said I am the bread of life he can only say what he is he said I am the bread of life I am the light of the world I am the door to this Sheepfold I am the Good Shepherd come on the I am is Jesus Christ is that right Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new it's a mighty Revelation that's come for me and you he's not a trinity are you listening now so now Jesus said in John 635 if you want to write it down I'm the bread of life John 8 12 says I am the light of the world John 10 and 7 said I am the door John 10 uh 11 said I am the Good Shepherd John 11:25 said I am the resurrection and the life John 14:16 said I am the way the truth and the life John 15 says I am the True Vine so get picture who is God in the Old Testament who is God in the New Testament is the I am I am the one that spoke to Moses before Abraham was i h now we're getting the picture so we're just say well Jesus living in me what are you talking about the I am is living in you the I am that created world oh I got this problem just go like this for me next time you got a problem and somebody will say what on Earth are you doing Casey Cassie what are you doing that's it what are you doing the god that made worlds is living in me that's deep we'll get deeper I like Michaels let's skip on the surface a little bit then we'll start drilling man he drilled I got one scripture left Genesis 1:1 so that's why majoring on Genesis 1:1 right now God bless you honey before Abraham was I am a greater than Jonah is here I am a greater than Solomon is here I am I greater than Daniel is here I am I greater than Abraham's here I am I greater than Isaac is here I am I greater than Mori is here a greater than Isaiah is here I get a habac how about let's get habac a greater than habac is here a greater than Malachi is here my sounding sweet isn't it brother Ron sounding sweet starting to realize who we are my problem in the face of I am how could we worry about our problem this is a I am do it again I love it he I love it I'm going to use that when I get home I've never done that before my wife said where did you get that so now we understand that he's the I am bread of life I am the light of the world I am the door I am the shepherd I I am the resurrection I am the truth and the life I am the True Vine so now I've I'm leading you up to a test the test is this how many Redemptive names does brother Braham use for brother for Jesus seven seven so we know it's Jehovah Gyra we know it's Jehovah Nissi tisu Raa shepher shama we know all that but do we know this quote brother brah says you can't divide them up if you got Victory you've got his presence if you got righteousness you got king theophany king of righteousness King theophany King Jesus king of kings you got them all you can't divide God up if you've got one you got them all oh man is a serpent stomping Time come on come on we can sup that devil on the ground he's my provider he is my healer he is my shepherd He is my victory he is my presence oh God can't divide God up I don't want to divide God up if you've got one of those you got them [Applause] all on Hallelujah go do your little bible study you go follow Jehovah Gyra all the way into Ezekiel Jehovah sh Shalom or I'm sorry not Shalom shama the Lord God is present so if you've got the provider you've got Victory you've got his righteousness you've got everything that God is come on devil we're resistors you said it now let

never alone you say I don't have any friends you got Jesus you and Jesus is a majority that's right you know these people that say I got no friends you got Jesus he'll walk with you he'll talk with

Michael will no he won't he didn't even throw a tomato at me should I clarify that we went to Noah we saw Noah it was tremendous we did no Noah for our our kids at our count and I was Noah oh what are so funny about that I'm a preacher righteousness okay okay so now I'm standing in the door telling them to come on in so we had our children we had you know foam apples cut out foam bananas cabbage tomatoes and I I I I got preaching Repent Jesus is the door get in the door and that was the key for them to throw tomatoes at me and so one of the children said to Michael or Michael said to them throw throw your banana throw your cabbage they said we're not throwing it then they said he's your dad you throw [Laughter] it he didn't throw it either that's respect how did I get there isn't the Lord lovely amen I mean you know we go to church people say oh you go to church how many times you go to church how long are your church service was how long that preacher came from Canada and he's already preached almost an hour and a half 45 minutes my goodness what is he thinking oh oh are you ready for this one we ready cuz now I'm going to give you a scripture let's turn to Romans chapter 8 we'll get off the first page first we got the foundation now we're on the first page we got 12 pages I say I say it back home and everybody goes in a cold sweat so Romans chap 8 verse 28 please oh yeah this should cause all issues gone and we know that some things come on and we know all things come on you said that you're a Son of God you said you got God in you you said you're a resistor see I told you I said y amen so now we got to believe all the Bible right so we got to believe now Romans 8:28 we know that all things work together for the good that them who are the called according to his all right so everything that happens to us is for God's purpose so where's your criticism now all right all right ah that see that Devil's at the door criticisms of the devil the accuser of the Brethren right mhm well come this didn't happen oh you didn't read uh Romans 8:28 according to his purpose okay according to his purpose verse 2 uh 29 for we know for for whom he did for know every Everybody read that well help me read it then for whom he what to be what to what that we what pretty we all went to school good so now moreover next one moreover you are who's predestinated here okay moreover whom you did predestinate then he also and whom he he and whom he them he ah okay let's take a look at that the called chosen marked out in love the Greek means you've been chosen in God marked out in love because that's what God is love so God chose you in love so you say well nobody likes me he loves you so who cares about everybody else right we're not at school anymore booh huh I don't have skunk running shoes oh oh you don't even know what skunk running shoes are do you you said do you had skunk running shoes yeah I did you know what skun CR shoes were cheap running shoes with three white stripes on every side I think it at a how do you call it down here adus okay they they they got on the bandwagon right and if you don't have the cool shoes you're not chosen in our group huh you're not in our group and my my mom says well those are cheap running shoes these basket Masters that are five bucks are better than that that are 25 bucks on but I want to be in the crowd so I want skunk running shoes and you pout for two weeks and finally you get skunk running shoes and find out that you hated him huh so you want to be in the crowd go ahead I'll say in God's crowd he ha called you mark you in love all right so those he loved he justified what does that mean what does that mean on come on you've listened to tapes right somebody shout it out first I heard over here okay that's the preacher we'll leave them over here what does it justified mean so what are you worried about so then whatever sin you did do Matthew and every sin you will do Matthew and every sin you might do Matthew is Justified you didn't do it in the first place it doesn't give you a license to sin then you make the word of God a disgrace but what what the word of God's telling us we're Justified you didn't do it in the first place that you are them he also say a little louder for me I'm deaf thank you I heard that he you he glorified is that right what shall we say then to these things me I just want to stomp that devil a little bit harder what shall we say then to these things called Justified [Applause] glorified if God be for us who can be against us glory be to Jesus let the Hallelujah is raw glory on I wish I had a voice 10 times this you said well you're talking too loud already come on I'd like to let everybody know in Elton come on I'm called you know what that means god called me and if God called me Satan you can't have me he never changes his mind about his word did you get that did God call you then he can't lose lose you it's impossible that would make God a liar and God cannot lie he's not a man that he would lie so then he called me he justified me and now he glorified me is that what is that what the Bible says here all right okay you can sit down you can relax we'll get you on your feet again don't you worry we're not done we'll get done I'm sorry for being so long just please forgive me me you might not have me back next year but listen so now you've been forn right those he did for no this should end the question you should be in Victory yeah every time you come to church after these scriptures and I I'm I'm not being factious now I'm I'm actually being very honest with you the for knowledge of God refers in the Greek that it is a legal binding commitment right it's legal and it's not in the court of man right it's in the court of God you can say to the devil this is a legal binding contract chosen of God marked as his own before the creation of the world so he's known you a long time you said well I don't like this about me that's why he's working on you yeah because he's got in mind what you're to be and you're to be the word made flesh today that's right so the man of God the men of God that will Minister the word of God will preach the word so that you become the word all right so it's a legal binding contract a legal binding contract therefore before the church can have a Rapture they need to get into rapturing faith that will Quicken their bodies and be taken away and I believe the church is on the road tonight I'm looking at it I'm looking at it he was prophesying it and you can say here I am here I am I'm the forn of God before God was God that's right M we're going way back we're starting to drill now before God was God you were in the mind of he knew you'd be sitting there in that chair looking at me right now with a frown or with a smile ah they're all smiles God fornew you he's not going to lose you what does he say say in John not one of you can be plucked from my hand and just so that you could get it he says it twice just think now closing just think resistors come on are you resisting the devil this morning I'm resisting sleep I'm resisting everything I'm I'm resisting the growl
