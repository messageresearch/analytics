[52:00] Homer Frazier who came from what seemed
[52:03] was an impossible situation as a
[52:06] bootlegger son and was running from the
[52:08] presence of the Lord one day he heard
[52:10] the voice of the Lord and the Lord got a
[52:12] hold of him in such a way that our Lord
[52:14] Jesus Christ took a boy and made him
[52:16] into a general and made him into a
[52:18] prince of preachers and and just uh just
[52:21] a great man our grandfather here and we
[52:23] just appreciate him we're we're here
[52:25] because God brought him out of a
[52:27] Pentecostal church and gave him a vision
[52:30] to have a lighthouse here in Elkton
[52:32] Virginia and under the leadership of
[52:34] brother Homer Frazier and now our pastor
[52:37] brother Ronald Spencer for 20 these past
[52:39] 23 years 50 years have come and gone so
[52:42] quickly it seems and and like a
[52:44] lighthouse this church has seen and
[52:46] weathered many storms but in all of that
[52:49] it has brought shelter and it's brought
[52:51] safe passage to many a Wandering souls
[52:53] to our Lord Jesus Christ and in these 50
[52:57] years this church has been a lighthouse
[53:00] for the message shining its light on the
[53:02] Wonder working power of almighty God a
[53:05] lighthouse to prove that God is still a
[53:07] Healer a lighthouse to prove that he
[53:10] still opens the blind eyes that the dead
[53:12] can come back to life a lighthouse to
[53:14] prove that there's liberty in this
[53:16] message a lighthouse that is not ashamed
[53:19] of the outpourings of the Holy Ghost and
[53:21] the moving of the spirit of the Living
[53:23] God this Lighthouse is here to prove
[53:25] that prodigals can and have come back
[53:28] and made the return back home
[53:31] Hallelujah
[53:34] Hallelujah
[53:37] Hallelujah
[53:39] this lighthouse
[53:41] this Lighthouse is here to prove that
[53:43] stroke victims can be made well this
[53:46] Lighthouse is here to prove that
[53:47] paralytics can walk again this
[53:49] Lighthouse is here to show that burnt
[53:52] patients can walk through the fire and
[53:54] come out on the other side without any
[53:56] smoke on them this Lighthouse is here to
[53:58] prove that cancer-ridden patients that
[54:00] were condemned to die can be made whole
[54:03] in the presence of the light
[54:06] this lighthouse
[54:08] this Lighthouse is here as a sign that
[54:12] Jesus is and still will remain to be the
[54:15] mighty conqueror
[54:17] and we are a lighthouse
[54:19] Still Standing 50 years later stronger

[1:03:02] this is our time our Jubilee
[1:03:05] amen I believe that I believe it is the
[1:03:09] hard time it's the bride's time
[1:03:11] amen Isaiah 61 and verse 1 says the
[1:03:14] spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:03:16] because the Lord has anointed me to
[1:03:19] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has
[1:03:22] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted
[1:03:24] to Proclaim Liberty to the captives the
[1:03:27] open of the prison to them that are
[1:03:29] bound to proclaim the acceptable year we
[1:03:32] know that's the Jubilee year the Year of
[1:03:34] Jubilee of the Lord and the day of
[1:03:36] Vengeance of our God to comfort all that
[1:03:40] mourn to appoint unto them that mourn
[1:03:42] and Zion to give unto them Beauty for
[1:03:45] Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the
[1:03:49] Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[1:03:51] heaviness that they might be called
[1:03:53] Trees of Righteousness the planting of
[1:03:56] the Lord that he might be glorified
[1:04:00] amen God bless you can be seated
[1:04:06] a man to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:04:10] the Lord you know Bill Branham would
[1:04:13] take this scripture and he would break
[1:04:15] it up into and begin to speak about it
[1:04:18] he said Jesus came and he took the
[1:04:20] scripture and read it to forewarn the
[1:04:23] people of the coming year of Jubilee He
[1:04:27] went into the synagogue at Capernaum and
[1:04:29] sat down and took the scripture and
[1:04:32] turned it over to Isaiah 61 and 1. and
[1:04:34] he read this the spirit of the Lord is
[1:04:37] upon me for he anointed me to preach the
[1:04:39] acceptable year of the Lord to set the
[1:04:42] captives at Liberty to give sight to the
[1:04:44] Blind and when he got through Reading he
[1:04:46] sat down and handed the scripture back
[1:04:48] to the priests and he said this day the
[1:04:51] scripture is fulfilled in your ears and
[1:04:53] eyes you see he was given forth the
[1:04:56] warning of the coming forth of the great
[1:04:59] gusher of Pentecost to set at Liberty
[1:05:02] everyone that was slaves to sin and were
[1:05:05] bound as said now at the going forth of
[1:05:07] that Jubilee it was sounded throughout
[1:05:09] all the land a trumpet was the sound and
[1:05:12] every slave that had been bought or
[1:05:14] become poor and could not take care of
[1:05:16] their debts and and fell beneath the
[1:05:18] load and his master and the master for
[1:05:21] his dead had bought him and had placed
[1:05:23] him in the field as a slave he had to
[1:05:25] serve him for he was too poor to redeem
[1:05:28] himself but God said remember one time
[1:05:31] you were slaves yourself and down in
[1:05:33] Egypt and I freed you therefore the
[1:05:35] sound of the trumpet every slave no
[1:05:38] matter how long he's been a slave or how
[1:05:40] short a time he is at Liberty to return
[1:05:43] to his family to return to his people to
[1:05:46] be free of every debt for it is the time
[1:05:48] of Jubilee even you wasn't to plant any
[1:05:51] corn and that the field was not we're
[1:05:54] not to be planning you would and you
[1:05:56] would not trim your Vineyard anything
[1:05:57] the poor the land was to eat of it a
[1:05:59] very beautiful type of the Millennium he
[1:06:01] says but every slave when he heard the
[1:06:03] trumpet sound he threw down his hoe no
[1:06:06] matter what he was doing what he was
[1:06:08] working with and he would say these
[1:06:10] words I am a free man I couldn't redeem
[1:06:14] myself but God through his grace has
[1:06:16] declared this a Year of Jubilee
[1:06:19] therefore I believe God and I don't have
[1:06:21] to work anymore the laws of the Lamb
[1:06:24] land had now claimed him free he said
[1:06:27] what a beautiful type of the day we were
[1:06:29] poor we were aliens we had nothing we
[1:06:31] could do if we kept ever Sabbath we ever
[1:06:34] knew Moon we quit eating meat if we had

[1:06:38] religious sacrifices we were still under
[1:06:40] a load we were sold in sin our parents
[1:06:43] sold us out to sin in the Garden of Eden
[1:06:46] and we're Laden on the bonds of sin as a
[1:06:48] slave to the devil because wherever one
[1:06:50] of us was born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:06:53] came into this world speaking lies there
[1:06:56] was nothing we could do to help
[1:06:58] ourselves because our all whole makeup
[1:07:00] our whole nature and everything we are
[1:07:03] is sin he said but when the juvenile any
[1:07:06] time come we were free and the trumpet

[1:20:25] like Church of Christ preachers saying
[1:20:27] that we're not in the season of Miracles
[1:20:29] no more what you're saying is you're not
[1:20:31] in the season of God no more

[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:38] listen we're not having Joy because
[1:21:40] times are good we're having Joy because
[1:21:42] this word is true
[1:21:45] what his word said that's all that
[1:21:48] matters is there a brother Timothy I
[1:21:50] need a preacher to tell me something I
[1:21:52] need something like that to happen let
[1:21:53] me tell you what you need to do is hear
[1:21:55] the word of God the word said
[1:21:58] I don't have to I'm not going to be
[1:22:00] healed because somebody told me I'm
[1:22:02] Healed because the word said
[1:22:05] I can have joy because the word said I
[1:22:08] can have peace I can have happiness I
[1:22:11] can have it all because the word said I
[1:22:13] could
[1:22:21] well in the days of Miracles has passed
[1:22:24] oh you say Well when the days of
[1:22:26] Miracles past the day of God has passed
[1:22:28] for God is miracles
[1:22:30] quote the days of Miracles will never be
[1:22:34] passed
[1:22:38] and never was and never will be
[1:22:44] see my God told Moses you go and I'll
[1:22:48] send an angel before you to keep in the
[1:22:50] way and to bring you into the place
[1:22:52] which I have prepared
[1:22:54] and don't notice how he tells them
[1:22:55] what's going to happen I'm going to send
[1:22:58] an angel and he's coming I'm going to
[1:23:00] lead you and he's going to lead you to
[1:23:02] the place I have prepared in other words
[1:23:04] when God leads somebody he's got a place
[1:23:06] in mind already for their destination
[1:23:09] and all the little stuff in between does
[1:23:12] not matter to God
[1:23:13] is not concerned about a Red Sea because
[1:23:16] he'll open it and make a way through it
[1:23:18] he is not concerned about bitter Waters
[1:23:20] because he got a tree it'll go down in
[1:23:22] it and make it sweet he's not concerned
[1:23:25] about no water no food because he's got
[1:23:27] he's Jehovah jira he's more than enough
[1:23:31] he's not concerned about the Wilderness
[1:23:33] he's not concerned about none of that
[1:23:39] it's like I was telling her church the
[1:23:41] other day they said the scripture says
[1:23:42] the word of God is a light unto my path
[1:23:45] now we think in terms of Q beams
[1:23:49] right big spotlights
[1:23:52] see a long ways down there
[1:23:56] um there ain't no problems in between
[1:23:58] here and there
[1:24:00] but David David said that you know what
[1:24:02] they had they had these little vessels
[1:24:04] it was a little Cruise of all and had a
[1:24:06] little Wick and it had just a little
[1:24:08] lamp on the end of it they would light
[1:24:10] and you know what to do it light up just
[1:24:12] enough to show their next step
[1:24:16] and the next step and the next step see
[1:24:20] God's intention is to get you to victory
[1:24:23] but you may not see all those pitfalls
[1:24:26] or things that's in the way don't worry
[1:24:28] God's going to make a way through it
[1:24:30] God's going to make a way through that
[1:24:32] sickness God's going to make a way
[1:24:34] through that trial just let the word
[1:24:37] lead you and guide you all the way
[1:24:47] we love the spotlights
[1:24:52] that ain't the way God works because God
[1:24:54] wants you to have faith in what he says
[1:24:56] he told Moses I'm going to take you to a
[1:24:59] prepared place
[1:25:00] and the angel we know is Angel of
[1:25:02] Covenant which was Christ Jesus he said
[1:25:04] the people many of them did not believe
[1:25:06] it so those who did not believe perished
[1:25:09] those who did believe went into the
[1:25:11] promised land and Men Who reject reject
[1:25:14] light went into total darkness and he
[1:25:17] said I believe today those who reject
[1:25:19] the Holy Spirit In The Light Of God the
[1:25:22] days of Miracles and so forth will go
[1:25:25] back into total darkness
[1:25:28] do you see how Pharaoh's heart what
[1:25:30] happened it got dark why because he
[1:25:33] rejected God
[1:25:38] amen and he said listen brother and
[1:25:40] sister the name of our Lord please get
[1:25:42] me right now what I'm trying to say to
[1:25:44] you that God who came out and led the
[1:25:47] Church of God out of Egypt the bondative
[1:25:50] the bondage into Freedom has come again
[1:25:53] in the same manner
[1:25:55] to lead his church spiritual out of the
[1:25:58] bondage of sin first by the Holy Spirit
[1:26:01] sickness next
[1:26:03] and the third step is to go into Glory
[1:26:08] so he has a place prepared for us
[1:26:13] and there's an angel who's guiding this
[1:26:15] church
[1:26:19] Hallelujah
[1:26:22] God called in Exodus of separation from
[1:26:25] where they were at the present time and
[1:26:27] God is making ready to fulfill his
[1:26:28] Divine promised word that he gave to
[1:26:30] Abraham Isaac and Jacob here years
[1:26:33] hundreds of years had passed but yet God
[1:26:36] never forgets his promise

[1:28:38] when she don't feel like it
[1:28:42] she can praise him when the devil tells
[1:28:44] her not to

[1:30:09] I've seen what cancer has done I've seen
[1:30:12] what that only Slew Foot devil has done
[1:30:15] to my people but this is their moment
[1:30:17] [Applause]
[1:30:19] there's an anointing there's a power
[1:30:22] there's a Grace of almighty God that'll
[1:30:25] go to you right now you say brother
[1:30:27] Timothy I don't even know what I believe
[1:30:29] I'm gonna tell you right now there's a
[1:30:30] liberty for you

[1:30:57] Hallelujah now we'll be with you
[1:31:00] wherever you go don't be afraid I'm
[1:31:04] coming down to deliver
[1:31:09] come on
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:12] I'm sure the spiritual mind catches that
[1:31:14] he says
[1:31:16] I'm coming down to the liver
[1:31:20] he says you know he said how can how we
[1:31:23] can rest and have faith and can catch a
[1:31:25] hold there God is going to do it he
[1:31:27] promised it no matter what circumstances
[1:31:29] is or what anybody says God is going to
[1:31:31] do it
[1:31:33] doesn't matter what a doctor says God is
[1:31:35] going to do it
[1:31:38] because we're not dependent on just the
[1:31:41] tree of knowledge and Good and Evil
[1:31:44] there's a tree of life to step onto
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:51] he said I I said you know he said he
[1:31:54] said A man does it so simple he says or
[1:31:57] he said God does it so simple it goes
[1:31:58] over the understanding of the cultured
[1:32:01] mind who try to reason about how can it
[1:32:04] be
[1:32:05] I don't mean to say what a man that a
[1:32:08] man now with a good strong mind find
[1:32:09] education that that man won't understand
[1:32:11] it that's all right wonderful as long as
[1:32:14] he don't use that man that mind to
[1:32:16] reason it
[1:32:18] but that culture that he's got to
[1:32:21] believe God he said let it be converted
[1:32:23] unto the Simplicity of listening to what
[1:32:26] God Said and believe what he said he
[1:32:29] said then his culture will help him then
[1:32:31] notice he said when a man tries to
[1:32:33] reason it can't be done then that drives
[1:32:36] him away from God constantly all the
[1:32:37] time listen to what his own
[1:32:39] understanding if you don't understand
[1:32:42] and the Bible says a certain thing just
[1:32:44] punctuate it with an amen
[1:32:49] just let it go like that amen
[1:32:53] I don't know what it means amen I don't
[1:32:57] know how to put it all together but amen
[1:33:06] but in the first Exodus why they were
[1:33:08] down in Egypt why why would God's people
[1:33:10] be out of that land
[1:33:12] after all God promised it right where
[1:33:14] the beginning was with Isaac Abraham
[1:33:16] Isaac and Jacob Palestine God gave him
[1:33:19] the land This Is It
[1:33:20] said this is it oh then why were the
[1:33:24] people not be in the place that God
[1:33:26] provided them he said that's the
[1:33:28] question of today also God give us
[1:33:31] Pentecost
[1:33:32] God give us the book of Acts he'd give
[1:33:36] us the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide
[1:33:38] us he'd give us a land so why would you
[1:33:41] be out of it
[1:33:43] he said why is the church out of it why
[1:33:46] isn't the great church today living
[1:33:48] again like the book of Acts bringing
[1:33:51] forth the same thing
[1:33:54] what is the book of Acts the acts of the
[1:33:56] Holy Ghost
[1:34:01] they went down into Egypt all because
[1:34:04] the jealousy of a brother
[1:34:08] he said that's the reason Israel was in
[1:34:10] Egypt was because jealousy of a brother
[1:34:12] remember God promised us was only as
[1:34:15] long as they stayed in that land but we
[1:34:17] know the story he says they had taken
[1:34:19] from his brothers they taken from from
[1:34:21] Joseph because he was spiritual he was a
[1:34:24] great man homeless of the bunch the
[1:34:26] least of the bunch and they hated him
[1:34:27] without a cause they should not have
[1:34:30] hated him they should have respected him
[1:34:35] because why did they hate him because he
[1:34:38] was brother not exactly that they hated
[1:34:40] him because God dealt with them more
[1:34:42] than he did the rest of them
[1:34:48] he gave them a spiritual understanding
[1:34:51] he can interpret dreams perfectly he
[1:34:54] could foretell things that would come to
[1:34:55] pass perfectly just exactly the way that
[1:34:58] he didn't pull no punches he saw dreams
[1:35:00] of those cheese being but bound before
[1:35:02] his sheep and his brother got angry and
[1:35:05] said I guess then you little Holy Roller
[1:35:07] and in other words we'll have to bow
[1:35:09] down before you someday
[1:35:12] well yeah matter of fact you will
[1:35:18] it's what happened it wasn't Joseph's
[1:35:21] attitude but that's what happened
[1:35:22] he said but that's the way it happened
[1:35:24] how were these great big giants ever
[1:35:27] bowing before that little insignificant
[1:35:29] fellow standing there but they didn't
[1:35:31] sure and pleaded for mercy
[1:35:38] we find out about doing this Joseph was
[1:35:40] taken from among the Brethren and set
[1:35:42] out to himself we know the story went
[1:35:45] had went down to Egypt he said the story
[1:35:47] of this jealous brother is certainly a
[1:35:48] great comparison with the spiritual side
[1:35:51] of it today we are all aware of that
[1:35:53] that old dirty filthy jealousy they see
[1:35:57] the same Bible the nature of the same
[1:35:59] God that wrote the Bible vindicating
[1:36:01] himself and turned that down without a
[1:36:03] reason he said pure well not pure it's
[1:36:07] dirty jealousy Watching God heal the
[1:36:09] sick raise the Dead the same God that
[1:36:12] lived in the days of the Apostles is the
[1:36:14] same gospel that they wrote and for the
[1:36:16] spiritual journey is the same God that
[1:36:18] does the same thing today now there's
[1:36:20] nothing but jealousy and it's excommuted
[1:36:22] and said we'll not have it among our
[1:36:25] people
[1:36:27] they taught the Brethren that they'd
[1:36:29] never have used for a man like that why
[1:36:31] why don't we just get rid of her that's
[1:36:33] the same thing that's happening today
[1:36:35] because our churches have become
[1:36:38] intellectual
[1:36:39] and the best dressed crowds and the
[1:36:42] biggest organization and the smartest
[1:36:44] ministers that we have no use of the
[1:36:47] holy spirit in the way that it was back
[1:36:49] there
[1:36:51] foreign
[1:36:55] they are full in other words actions
[1:36:58] speak louder than words they're
[1:37:00] seminaries their brain their being
[1:37:02] they're coming together and discussing
[1:37:04] this thing or more able with their own
[1:37:07] intellectual Minds to set a church in
[1:37:09] order better than what the Holy Spirit
[1:37:11] can do it they don't need it no longer
[1:37:14] it's something we don't need today it's
[1:37:16] days of that has passed we don't need
[1:37:19] the Holy Ghost to heal the Holy Spirit
[1:37:20] to heal the sick we got doctors we don't
[1:37:23] need the Holy Spirit to speak with
[1:37:24] tongues we're all intelligent people and
[1:37:27] when you do you take right from your
[1:37:29] framework the lifeline
[1:37:36] come on somebody
[1:37:40] Jesus said them Jews in his day have you
[1:37:43] not read the stone that was rejected as
[1:37:45] the Chief Cornerstone and the building
[1:37:48] is setting upon you see what I mean sure
[1:37:50] you can catch it the reason of it is now
[1:37:52] is because they thought they never have
[1:37:54] need of it we don't need speakers with
[1:37:56] tongues we don't need interpreters of
[1:37:58] tongues we no longer need an Old
[1:38:00] Testament Prophet we no longer need the
[1:38:02] ministry
[1:38:08] but we don't need none of that by the
[1:38:11] Holy Spirit we have adopted a man-made
[1:38:13] system to take the place of the Holy
[1:38:16] Spirit therefore there is a but
[1:38:18] therefore there is a people that's
[1:38:20] elected it has their names on the lamb
[1:38:23] Book of Life they can't go for that
[1:38:29] they can't go for that they are
[1:38:31] spiritually minded therefore they will
[1:38:34] never go for that they can't stand it no
[1:38:37] matter how much their mothers and
[1:38:38] fathers lived in organizational Church
[1:38:45] he said but the church feels they don't
[1:38:47] need the Holy Spirit
[1:38:51] the church will tell you that and man
[1:38:54] will stand up and give you this is a
[1:38:55] quote man will stand up and give you
[1:38:57] such an intellectual talk can almost
[1:38:59] make you believe it
[1:39:02] he said now let's stop there a minute
[1:39:04] didn't Jesus say the two would be so
[1:39:06] close together it would deceive the very
[1:39:08] elected if possible
[1:39:13] the congregation says amen
[1:39:16] the intellectual talks would be so
[1:39:18] smooth it would deceive people it's
[1:39:21] gospel it's men who can handle the word
[1:39:23] in such a way that he could almost make
[1:39:25] any intellectual person if you're
[1:39:27] trusting in your intellects that they
[1:39:29] would condemn the Holy Spirit and take
[1:39:31] the way of man we see that
[1:39:37] now that's the same thing they thought
[1:39:39] about Joseph they got rid of him but all
[1:39:42] down in Egypt how we can think how I
[1:39:44] could spend hours you could stay here
[1:39:46] for three years and never leave that
[1:39:47] subject day and night and still that
[1:39:50] that burns your 45 minutes of don't you
[1:39:54] and still be finding the great Colonels
[1:39:56] of the Holy Spirit the spiritual mind
[1:39:58] can look down in Egypt and see that
[1:40:00] persecution rise can see Joseph taken
[1:40:03] out of the way and so it could rise and
[1:40:05] then see God wills and the wheels
[1:40:07] everything moving exactly right see
[1:40:10] potiphar reject Joseph see Joseph in
[1:40:12] prison and his beard growing out and
[1:40:14] excommunicated but all of a sudden
[1:40:18] God Moves In
[1:40:21] Hallelujah ah we can see the wheel in
[1:40:25] the middle of the wheel moving God's
[1:40:27] great plan moving everything up to this
[1:40:29] Exodus right here
[1:40:33] right here oh brother Timothy I'm down
[1:40:36] to my last thread of Hope but all of a
[1:40:40] sudden God Moves In

[1:40:56] are we going to make it through any of
[1:40:58] this time and take a body change all of

[1:41:09] okay
[1:41:13] I like it when he moves in
[1:41:17] changes the whole scene
[1:41:22] go through the scriptures immediately
[1:41:24] and suddenly
[1:41:26] scripture is full of them
[1:41:29] immediately the leper was healed
[1:41:31] immediately they received their sight
[1:41:34] and suddenly there was a sound from
[1:41:35] heaven
[1:41:39] all of a sudden God moved in
[1:41:43] that changes the whole equation
[1:41:47] our brother job been spent some time on
[1:41:49] that maybe some of you saw an impossible
[1:41:51] math listen with math can sometimes be
[1:41:53] impossible well what changes the whole
[1:41:55] equation of life is when all of a sudden
[1:41:59] God Moves In
[1:42:02] change it for the three Uber children
[1:42:04] they were heading right down to their
[1:42:06] death and they took their last step into
[1:42:09] the fire but all of a sudden
[1:42:14] amen that's the way God moves sometimes
[1:42:17] he waited but brother Brown would bring
[1:42:19] it out time go listen to it in the
[1:42:20] darkest moments that's when Jesus comes
[1:42:23] by

[1:42:42] amen I can blow through your life and
[1:42:45] change everything in just a moment
[1:42:54] Hallelujah
[1:42:57] Romans 8 11 said to the spirit of him
[1:42:59] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:43:01] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:43:03] dead shall also Quicken your mortal body
[1:43:07] by his spirit that dwelleth in you Jesus
[1:43:10] had the word of his resurrection he
[1:43:12] spoke and he said if you destroy this
[1:43:14] temple in three days I'll raise it up
[1:43:16] again
[1:43:17] but if it had not been no Dynamics had
[1:43:19] not been no spark to make that word live
[1:43:22] it has still been dead in a tomb
[1:43:25] amen but I'ma tell you this word is not
[1:43:27] a dead word it's a Living Word it's a
[1:43:30] breathing word it changes people
[1:43:34] it changes people this word heals it
[1:43:38] delivers
[1:43:41] you say you got scripture for that I
[1:43:42] sure do Psalms 107 19 then they Cried
[1:43:46] unto the Lord in their trouble and they
[1:43:48] saved them out of their distresses he
[1:43:51] sent his word and healed them
[1:43:54] and deliver them from their destruction
[1:43:57] all that men would praise the Lord for
[1:44:00] his goodness and for his wonderful works
[1:44:02] of the Children of Men
[1:44:06] the word has movement in it it has
[1:44:09] breath in it it has life in it and when
[1:44:12] it's anointed by the spirit of the
[1:44:14] Living God
[1:44:15] if it's not anointed by the spirit then
[1:44:17] his dead letter
[1:44:19] he's got scripture for that sure do
[1:44:21] second Corinthians 3 and verse 2 said
[1:44:23] your Epistles written are hard known and
[1:44:26] read of all men for as much as you have
[1:44:28] manifestedly declared to be the Epistles
[1:44:30] of Christ ministered by US Written not
[1:44:32] of ink but the spirit of the Living God
[1:44:33] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[1:44:36] tables of the heart
[1:44:38] that's where he wanted to write it is in
[1:44:40] your heart
[1:44:41] amen and such trust have we through
[1:44:44] Christ to God we're not that we're
[1:44:45] sufficient of ourselves to think
[1:44:47] anything of ourselves but our
[1:44:48] sufficiency is of God who also has made
[1:44:51] us able Ministers of the New Testament
[1:44:54] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[1:44:57] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[1:44:59] life
[1:45:04] Hallelujah but Lord let's keep on
[1:45:07] reading but if the administration of
[1:45:08] death ridden and Engraving in Stones was
[1:45:11] glorious so that the children of Israel
[1:45:13] should not could not steadfastly behold
[1:45:15] the face of Moses for the glory of his
[1:45:18] countless which Glory has been was to be
[1:45:20] done away with how shall not the
[1:45:22] ministration of the spirit be rather
[1:45:25] glorious
[1:45:29] come on now if he was glorious in the
[1:45:32] Old Testament how much more glorious is
[1:45:34] he now
[1:45:38] because his word is not written on
[1:45:40] tables of stone it's written in living
[1:45:43] hearts
[1:45:49] hallelujah amen well that's why he would
[1:45:52] say to those who wanted to keep the
[1:45:54] noise down and wanted to keep the noise
[1:45:55] down he said if I tell them to hold
[1:45:58] their peace The Rock's gonna cry out
[1:46:02] he already ridden a rock and The Rock
[1:46:04] didn't have no breath but he said if I
[1:46:07] tell these Living Stones if I tell these
[1:46:09] ones who have breath in their life who
[1:46:12] can hear the word of God to hold their
[1:46:15] peace then these rocks are going to cry
[1:46:17] out
[1:46:20] I'm here to tell you they ain't a rock
[1:46:23] gonna take my place
[1:46:28] I have heard the word of the God I have
[1:46:30] hired the ministration of the spirit and
[1:46:33] his life
[1:46:35] I said it's life
[1:46:38] it has spread it has power
[1:46:43] when this ministration of the spirit
[1:46:45] Goes Forth it heals the sick
[1:46:48] it races a dead it says the captive free
[1:46:53] it is even more glorious
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:56] [Applause]
[1:47:09] ain't no table of stone gonna take my
[1:47:10] place
[1:47:14] ah it's done been written here
[1:47:18] you are free

[1:47:31] free you're delivered it's over with the
[1:47:35] devil lost his power he don't have no
[1:47:38] power this is what is riding on your
[1:47:40] heart
[1:47:46] Hallelujah I remember when it was
[1:47:49] written on a little lady's heart about
[1:47:51] 90 pounds she was ate up with cancer but
[1:47:54] it got written on her hearts
[1:47:57] and said you are healed and around and

[1:48:16] blood-bought Southern Living God
[1:48:18] I never belong to the devil he might
[1:48:21] have had me down in the pawn shop but
[1:48:23] there was a blood that paid the price
[1:48:27] and I am free
[1:48:36] I said I'm free
[1:48:41] whatever you need to do is look at that
[1:48:43] devil who's been a Taskmaster of your
[1:48:46] life and he's beat you over the head
[1:48:48] with Gloom you need to throw that hair

[1:49:32] Grave you can walk out too
[1:49:36] oh if he walked over sickness I can walk
[1:49:40] over it too if he walked over depression
[1:49:43] I can walk over it too
[1:49:47] Hallelujah if he walked over hell I can
[1:49:50] walk over it too
[1:49:53] he's under my feet

[1:50:57] hallelujah what a mighty God we serve
[1:51:03] the word alone is a dead letter but if
[1:51:05] there's a light a spark it'll make it
[1:51:08] live
[1:51:09] and the same spirit that raised that
[1:51:12] dead body up from the grave is now again
[1:51:14] dwelling in human bodies
[1:51:18] and if it took that dead body and raised
[1:51:21] it up and walked out of a crave it'll
[1:51:23] take he who is dead and sins and
[1:51:26] iniquity and he'll walk out of that gray
[1:51:31] I'm here to tell you this evening amen
[1:51:34] the spirit of Resurrection in life is
[1:51:36] Among Us
[1:51:39] the same one that walked to the Grave
[1:51:41] called Lazarus when he laid there it's
[1:51:44] the same one here tonight and he has the
[1:51:46] same power
[1:51:49] thank you
[1:51:50] here's why I don't know of anybody
[1:51:52] laying in that kind of grave maybe not
[1:51:53] right here in this building but there's
[1:51:55] Graves of sin there's Graves of unbelief
[1:51:57] there's Graves of doubt
[1:52:00] there's Graves of sickness there's
[1:52:02] Graves of of the depression and
[1:52:05] anxieties and fears there's all kinds of
[1:52:07] griefs
[1:52:09] but there's a voice of Resurrection
[1:52:13] and it says to you tonight come forth
[1:52:19] come forth
[1:52:21] come forth
[1:52:24] come forth pride of Jesus Christ
[1:52:29] walk out of it
[1:52:32] and some of you tonight need to walk out
[1:52:34] of your Dow walk out of your fear walk
[1:52:37] out of your unbelief
[1:52:44] you might come walking out like this
[1:52:49] and Jesus didn't leave Lazarus like that
[1:52:54] he said loose him and let him go
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:59] so you know what it is he loosed his
[1:53:01] feet so he could dance
[1:53:04] he loosed his hands so he could clap and
[1:53:08] he loosed his mouth so he could speak
[1:53:15] I'll say it tonight woman they want
[1:53:17] loose
[1:53:21] Hallelujah those grave codes can't hold
[1:53:24] you that pass can't hold you the devil
[1:53:28] that's kind of held over your life it's
[1:53:30] over with
[1:53:36] there is a power in this building
[1:53:39] that'll defeat every sin it'll defeat
[1:53:42] every disease every trick and every trap
[1:53:45] of the devil
[1:53:47] [Applause]
[1:53:57] you know brother Brandon would say he
[1:54:00] said we but we have put too much stress
[1:54:02] on the mechanics and nothing on the
[1:54:04] Dynamics
[1:54:05] we need the dynamic power of God the
[1:54:08] resurrected power of Jesus Christ upon
[1:54:10] the church to manifest and to bring to
[1:54:13] pass that this is gasoline
[1:54:20] you can have a gas can but it can be
[1:54:23] full of water
[1:54:25] but what determines whether it's gas or
[1:54:27] whether it's water is a spark
[1:54:30] [Music]
[1:54:32] amen you let a spark go through and
[1:54:34] it'll blow up
[1:54:37] that's what we need in our churches is
[1:54:39] the spark of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:57] he said that's Sonic come up and the
[1:55:00] dirt will lay there and that sun and say
[1:55:02] man that sun is so hot
[1:55:06] this sermon is so long
[1:55:09] I'm so bored
[1:55:12] can't wait to go watch my sport removal
[1:55:17] but that sees this
[1:55:21] this is what I'm looking for
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:28] this is my time to come to life this is
[1:55:32] my moment to rise up out of this old
[1:55:35] dirty place
[1:55:38] hahaha
[1:55:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:55:45] hallelujah
[1:55:46] hallelujah I got to read near the other
[1:55:49] day about those giant sequoias largest
[1:55:51] trees on Earth they can grow for more
[1:55:53] than 3 000 years
[1:55:56] but without fire they cannot produce
[1:55:59] reproduce
[1:56:01] amen the great Sequoias are really born
[1:56:03] in the fire the fire gives them three
[1:56:06] things first it punches a hole in that
[1:56:09] Forest
[1:56:10] where light can shine through greater
[1:56:12] than it's ever shown
[1:56:18] I see why they don't want to let the
[1:56:20] fire loose because they don't want holes
[1:56:22] punched through their dogmas and through
[1:56:24] their Creeds that's kept people bound
[1:56:26] [Applause]
[1:56:31] but I say turn the fire loose
[1:56:41] the second thing that adult that fire
[1:56:43] does it heats up the seeds so the cones
[1:56:47] that are in those mature trees it Heats
[1:56:50] them up enough that they can drop down
[1:56:52] the seeds to the ground
[1:56:55] hello you old trees you need fire too
[1:56:58] [Music]
[1:57:02] amen for the final thing is done it
[1:57:07] clears away all the leaves or all the
[1:57:10] dead matter that's laying on the ground
[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:14] so when that seed Falls it has some rich
[1:57:18] soul to fall into
[1:57:21] [Applause]
[1:57:24] Hallelujah I was up and bath there with
[1:57:27] my wife or brother Jerry Fury and his
[1:57:29] wife and we were on a lake and we're
[1:57:30] going on this tour and on one side was
[1:57:33] this old burn over and on this other
[1:57:34] side was the most beautiful Grove of
[1:57:36] trees you ever seen and there was this
[1:57:38] guy that was on that boat he said hey
[1:57:40] let me ask y'all a question he said hi
[1:57:41] which one of y'all knows where the life
[1:57:44] is where the animals are where where
[1:57:45] life and birds and Things Are
[1:57:48] and I was just sitting back and watching
[1:57:50] and listening because I know what
[1:57:52] brother Branham said
[1:57:54] and so others oh man it's got to be over
[1:57:56] there with that beautiful Forest is it's
[1:57:58] so pretty that over there's nothing but
[1:57:59] a bunch of burn over look it's just ugly
[1:58:01] he said no matter of fact he said every
[1:58:04] bit of life is right over there
[1:58:09] he said to me you know why those trees
[1:58:11] are still standing he said because at
[1:58:13] the end of that is Bap he said so men
[1:58:16] have regulated fires to such a place
[1:58:18] that they have now made it to where we
[1:58:20] try not to let a fire get out because
[1:58:22] it's going to burn down the town
[1:58:25] and he said but if what needs to happen
[1:58:27] to that Force to bring life again there
[1:58:29] needs to be a fire get out
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:32] he said but man it regulated and men
[1:58:35] have made it to such a place they've
[1:58:37] actually taken the life out well I'm
[1:58:39] gonna tell you what he was preaching to
[1:58:40] me
[1:58:43] I thought God how many men have stood
[1:58:46] behind pulpits and regulated the fire of
[1:58:49] God
[1:58:51] don't want her to get out I'm afraid of
[1:58:54] wildfire I'm afraid of this that and the
[1:58:55] other and they regulate the fire of God
[1:59:03] amen I've seen men that have stood
[1:59:05] behind pulpits and try to preach balance
[1:59:08] and balance the spirit of God right out
[1:59:10] of the church
[1:59:14] hey man I can tell you a scripture that
[1:59:17] says quench not the spirit
[1:59:21] in other words don't be a spiritual fire
[1:59:25] extinguisher
[1:59:28] every time you see a little fire you
[1:59:31] want to throw your old wet blanket up
[1:59:32] I'm telling you one thing this fire is
[1:59:34] about to get so big
[1:59:37] it's about to get no great there ain't
[1:59:40] enough Winds of hell they could
[1:59:43] all it's gonna do is make it get hotter
[1:59:46] make it get greater make it get taller
[1:59:49] make it get bigger
[1:59:54] Oh Glory to God in the highest I say let
[1:59:58] the seed of God rejoice in the spirit of
[2:00:01] God Let the Fire Fall
[2:00:11] I said Let the Fire Fall
[2:00:16] your wet blanket up and throw it in the
[2:00:19] trash and let God move in the hearts
[2:00:22] [Applause]
[2:00:27] Hallelujah as we bring this down he said
[2:00:30] mechanics don't run the church it's the
[2:00:32] Dynamics that run it
[2:00:34] the holy ghost that gets into the word
[2:00:36] it's not a seminary that teaches you
[2:00:38] Theology and Greek interpretation but
[2:00:40] it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost that
[2:00:42] sets in a fire and brings the word to
[2:00:44] pass and will make it live exactly what
[2:00:46] the promised word is for this hour not
[2:00:49] mechanics the Dynamics
[2:00:52] it takes mechanics and it takes Dynamics
[2:00:55] it takes the word and it takes the
[2:00:57] spirit they are the one
[2:01:00] that gives life
[2:01:04] he said we've studied the mechanics
[2:01:07] until it's all mechanical
[2:01:11] Mercy
[2:01:13] let me go on down right here if we get
[2:01:15] down this
[2:01:17] what about the fire brother Timothy the
[2:01:19] Dynamics of this church will be a
[2:01:23] refilling of the holy spirit that is
[2:01:25] worked in small measure
[2:01:29] while The Headstone is coming down to
[2:01:31] unite with the body but when the head
[2:01:33] and the body unites together the full
[2:01:36] power of the Holy Ghost will raise her
[2:01:39] up exactly like that the dead in Christ
[2:01:42] for hundreds and thousands of years will
[2:01:45] rise and the beauty of his Holiness and
[2:01:48] take the flight to the skies
[2:01:51] the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost amen so
[2:01:56] don't look for Less look for more
[2:02:00] let's not look for Less healings let's
[2:02:03] look for more let's not look for Less

[2:02:17] reached for the Lord let's look for more
[2:02:19] to be restored
[2:02:21] let's look for sugar diabetes to be
[2:02:24] delivered
[2:02:26] it's her to be defeated every Spirit to
[2:02:29] go under our feet As We rise and rise
[2:02:33] and rise in the power of almighty God

[2:02:45] brother Branham talked about those old
[2:02:47] trees and that burn over remember that
[2:02:54] I was in that place really Doug Baker
[2:02:56] sitting on the side of Mount Lemmon in
[2:02:58] the daylight
[2:02:59] and that wind began to blow up through
[2:03:01] the burn of Mount Baker Mountain limit
[2:03:03] had a bad burn over
[2:03:05] just a year or so maybe that year there
[2:03:08] was a bunch of Stags so you know
[2:03:09] triggled tree trunks hanging there that
[2:03:12] wind come up that Valley up that
[2:03:13] mountain
[2:03:16] make the hair stand up on your head I
[2:03:18] couldn't imagine what it would be like
[2:03:19] in the Moonlight
[2:03:23] I always said I ain't scared of the dark
[2:03:25] I'm scared of things in the dark
[2:03:33] Mercy here I was in the broad open
[2:03:36] daylight my hair was standing straight
[2:03:37] up on my head
[2:03:41] brother Randall said that was a spooky
[2:03:42] place
