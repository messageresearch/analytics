abundantly God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we your children pray in the Name of Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of Galatians chapter 3 and verse 24 verse 29 and then also down to First Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 about nine there about nine books apart there in the New Testament man Galatians chapter 3 and verse 24 and I'd like to just stay in that same vein of thought as we were uh last weekend and the weekend before that but if I would title this tonight I I'd like to title it a people for a purpose a people for a purpose the the ible says here wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school Master for you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there's neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus I love the scriptures because we realize how we become one that by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter what what what genealogy Reign that you came from that we are all one in Christ Jesus and you be Christ and if you be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise and all so down to 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 and the Bible says here but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy I love the scriptures now I I've I've sent this to the the upstairs here tonight and I'd like to just maybe just cast your view here to the original diaglot what the what the Bible it spells out for us here in 1 Peter 2:9 but the original diaglot says but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for a purpose that you may be May declare the Perfections of him who called you from Darkness into his wonderful light we're not here to declare how perfect we are but we are here to declare the Perfections of him who called us from Darkness into his wonderful light who once were not a people but now are God's people you wouldn't even considered in the picture under the under the Jud judicial law you wasn't even in the picture but you are now God's people who had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy may God bless his word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord as we stated it we'd like to just speak to you from this thought a people for a purpose a people for a purpose and I believe that the word of God that the word of God I believe it with all that is within me I believe that it is unchanging in all of its ways that it is infinite it is it is infallible it is the almighty God in written form but I believe that that what we have in this generation is is more than just a written word but I believe that the spirit of God is here to manifest what is laying there laying there in the scripture because the scripture teaches us that the letter kth but the but the the the letter kth but the spirit gives life and we realize that that that what we are being being led by is none other than the influence of the Holy Ghost that is leading that is leading his children by by the spirit of almighty God and I think it's a powerful thing to recognize that God has led us here led us here under under this powerful message you begin to think about when brother Brandon would talk about that little bitty boy that was following his child he was following his child and and and or the child was following the father excuse me and he was following following the father there and he he was just staggering back and forth in the snow and he was going back and forth and and and the the the daddy looked back and he said son what are you doing he said well I'm just he said I'm following you Daddy I'm stepping in your footsteps you see and the daddy was was a drunk and he was walking down the street and he realized that what he was doing was influencing was influencing himself he he was influencing that little child and we realize that the father has has influenced us by the preaching of the word by the restored word that we realize that in this generation that there is a a body of Believers that have come under Harmony under the same mind that was in almighty God I I just want to just stop right here for a minute and I I was kind of I was kind of waiting for them but they just comed in and I I would like to wish our sister Sevilla a very happy birthday today God richly bless you God richly bless you brother Melvin brother Melvin called me before church and he he told me that he told me that she uh today was her birthday and they wanted to celebrate by coming to church and I I tell you what I cried for about an hour and a half in my study and I that's a great way to celebrate your birthday so you you make sure you see my my wife down there after after church if you don't mind if youve never met her that's the best part of my life right there and uh so but let me just let me just move on brother brandham said brother brandham said in in the absolute he said he had a purpose in Saving me he said there was millions in sin when I come to him but he saved me he had a purpose in doing so I think it's powerful when you begin to recognize that God had a purpose in Saving you again and and I know my redeemer lives he said he said and God did not have to just make a tree just to make a tree just to just to be a tree he made a tree free for a purpose you see and God did not make you and I just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose therefore there is a purpose of all of us being here you're not here just to be n made to just you're not here just to be another human being but you are here because that God made you for some purpose and I think it's when when young people when when men and all men of all ages when they begin to find what their purpose of God is in their life I I think it's it's one of the most grandest thing when you watch somebody that has staggered around in nonsense of life trying to find their way and trying to find their way through life but when they find their purpose they they get stabled out when men when the men bounce back and forth between callings and and Zeal and between what they're thinking and what God is thinking you it's it's powerful when somebody finds a very purpose of God and I I would like to just pose you a couple questions just for a minute what gets you up in the morning what gets you motivated in the morning like literally I'm not just talking about just because not just just gets you up but I'm talking about what makes you get up what is on the backside of your story that makes you makes you motivated to find the very mind of God and find the and to fulfill the purpose and the promises of God and if you can find that if you'll ever find what motivates you to get up and to fulfill God's promises I promise you that you'll be successful in spite of anything that the devil can put on you what motivates you to become a better Christian what motivates you to read your Bible what motivates you to to fulfill God's promise brother mandam said give me a Christian give me a housewife give me a preacher give me a custodian give me anybody that will put God first in everything and I'll show you somebody that'll be successful in spite of all that the devil puts upon them it doesn't matter what he puts on you but as long as you're seeking God first if you're seeking his mind if you're seeking his will if you're seeking his mindset I'll say this I can never be the same Andrew Spencer when the message came by my way when the message came by my way I can never go back to being the old Andrew Spencer I can never go back to those things I I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord I remember the day it happened I remember where I was standing at on the streets of Victoria and I can go back and I can point you to the moment that I was there and I can point you to the T that I changed brother Tom Ray he he he he he was there he led me to the Lord right there on the streets of Victoria he took me back to Cloverdale and he gave me he gave me a iPod and he downloaded all the message and anything that was anything that was included in the message he he put it on that iPod and I I listened to that iPod I listen to it over and over and over again until I broke it I I cut my teeth on this message I I cut my teeth on the church ages book I I listen to this message over and over and over and over again I can never be the same Andrew Spencer when the message came by my way it changed everything that I was he had a purpose in Saving me he had a purpose in Saving you and he had something Hallelujah I went out to dinner last night with our brother Don Milsap and his mom s sister Milsap here and they I was I tell you what they did me a real good blessing they brought me they brought me some Georgia peaches and they told me I could share them with some people so I gave I gave some to my wife and and uh I tell you they B they bless me real good they blessed me real good but I I was talking to her about when she come to the message she been in she's been in O in the message close to over 50 years now and to think about that some of our some of our generation is here that we've been living in under the offices of the message of the hour for over over the better part of all of our life that we've been sitting here I think what a wonderful way to spend your life Liv in the message believe in the message no matter what came up no matter what came down no matter what trials came you stood for the message I tell you church this message moves me this message moves me because I realize that there is a people on the Earth today that is literally fulfilling the prophecy of what William brandham saw it moves me to press on it moves me to preach some message it moves me not to give up it moves me to go forward I tell you when you see a people it moves me to realize that there is a people on earth that is literally matching the prophecy of what William brandham saw it's a powerful thing that what you when you look in the message and you see what the bride is going to be what she's going to look like what how she's going to handle oursel and then see it come into reality you are a people for a purpose and God did not send you here just to listen to tapes he did not just send you here just to read scriptures he sent you here for a purpose because you are going to be bone of his bone life of his life nature of his very nature and somebody is going to step into the reality of what a prophet saw Hallelujah M said in this moury or in the pram in church age he said in the last days the true bride Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church of super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this wrong seat you see you think about the hour that we are living in in the lay odyssean Church age that this is the hour that Jesus has been locked out of the church it's the only age it's the only age that is standing on the outside of the church what did the denominations do they locked out the revelation of who Jesus Christ was they locked him out on the outside but Christ was trying to get entrance into his church and there was a people that rejected him but there is a people that have accepted him when the world didn't want him when the religions didn't want him but there was a people there was a bride there was an anointed people it was once the anointed man but now it's the anointed people anointed by what by accepting what Eve turned down Hallelujah and God is Not unjust in his ways he put every one of us here on free moral agency he gave us a choice he gave adam a choice there's not one of us that has the ability to tell God how to run his business because God has never had a new thought he's never been surprised but all along God has been waiting he's been waiting to be savior because he he's been waiting because there was attributes in him to be a savior so he condescended so that he could be touched he humbled himself in order to be praised he humbled himself to be worshiped because he desired to be handled he desired to be loved he desired to be adored and the great Eternal one be to express himself out came him through the logos and down throughout time he created himself a family what was it deity was being expressed and when Jesus stood here it was deity being expressed in humanity it was a Son of God manifested In the Flesh what was it it was a person for a purpose because deity was expressing he looked like all other humans he dressed like all other humans he got tired like all other humans Hallelujah he felt pain like all other humans he had Agony like all other humans he loved like all other humans but on the inside of him was more than a man on side of him was more than a prophet on the inside of him laid God Almighty tabernacled For The First Time in Forever he was the only one that could say that I am the father are one prophets looked apart there was prophetic people that was that looked theart but there was only one man let me transition this to humanity you look like other human beings you dress like other human beings and if we could be real honest here I believe that if you would get down get real honest with yourself that you would admit it that there was something always that was leading you I'd say if we'd be real honest ever since we was a child there was something leading us there was something that was calling us and maybe we tried to Tamp it down with this or that or the other I believe but if we would admit it but it was the important part of the picture it was the very Soul the Jean seat of God that was on the inside of you from before the foundation of the world God saw you and I believe that if we'll be real honest that the there was something leading you all the days of your life when everybody else wanted to do their own thing when everybody else couldn't follow the word he was leading you all the time but the important part is he knew he knew when you didn't know when you didn't look like a bride he knew when you tried to walk away he knew you couldn't when you tried to give up he wouldn't let you what was it the important part of you that is a part of almighty God hallelujah what is it he is he saw you and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he unveiled himself he created angels to be almighty God to be God he had to be worshiped because God means an object of worship so he created angels in order to be God and thousands of years he's been unfolding this expressing the attributes of who he is of Je Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Nishi Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Rah here he is and he's been calling and wooing to a people that were built for a purpose and you see what the word does the word of God always separates what is the word done in this generation is because God is calling out a Lamb's Book people the word of God has been separating the Lamb's Book people and the Book of Life people you see before you could ever have a choice Grace was given to you before the foundation of the world it's the only way that you could be a part of God is that you were with him at the beginning it was not that God saw your choice because Jean because God's genes are Eternal it was not that you made the right choice when you went down to the altar but God made the right choice before there was an Adam before there was a molecule God chose you you are as Eternal as God is eternal let me put it in a picture like this the Garden of Eden was not Eden without Adam it was not Eden with that Adam let me say this that we're not leaving one hoof behind because the Millennium will not be the Millennium and the and the throne and where we're going to the city will not be a full City unless you're there as a jean seed of God so let me say this you're a people for a purpose and I am I am driven to get everyone that I can I am driven to preach this message until every breath in my lungs is gone until I'm sick and blue in the face I will sit here and I will preach this message because I believe that God still has Jimmy props out there that God still has Gabriel Spencer out there that God still has Randy hles out [Applause] there Adam didn't choose God and your choice didn't choose God God brooded over you God broed over Adam you see you're not saved by the blood of a gentile you are not saved by the blood of a Jew you are saved by the blood of almighty God when God begin to go there in the very beginning when you begin to read the Genesis the gene chapter when you begin to see when God would begin to brood over the Earth and cause seeds that he had that he had planted there that every seed would bring forth yielding after its kind and the spirit of God begin to move out across the waters and brought up marine life and animal life and begin to move up until he he created one into his very own image what was it what was it he had made something that looked so much like him that he begin to rest that he begin to rest that this is finally what I've been looking for but man made a choice and man fail and ever since that time God has been brooding over this Earth so he raised up an Enoch he raised up an Elijah he raised up a Moses Prophet after prophet he was trying to restore that image and finally upon Earth came the genuine image of God himself which was God the logos made flesh and dwelt amongst us he said now that same logos has a part has got a bride that logos has a part has got a bride and the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation he said which the prophets was carriers to that seed and the church denominations has been carriers to that seed he said now notice quickly he said the Chuck hugs and holds onto the seed and then it leaves her then it leaves her he says in Harvest time he said the carriers changed he said they denominated the blades of tassled the shook he said but that wheat can't change he said it's got to be a Ministry just exactly on the word like he was on the word you see let me say it like this the Lutheran changed they had the Holy Ghost in part the westle had the Holy Ghost in part but 20 years afterwards every move they begin to denominate and change Lutheran change Wesleyan Chang the isus of Pentecostals changed but this is another hour this is the weed age when others would change when others are changing this bride is not changing why because it's not a part of itself it's a part of God what was the Alpha bride it's now the Omega bride she is a bone of his bone Hallelujah the Church of the Living God this bride is in preview Again by a restored word of the hour what Paul preached William Bron preached where they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ William brandom said I did too where they preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too he said everything they taught I did too well I'm happy to be identified with an I did to kind of message that this message that Paul preached is the same message let me tell you something if the message that Paul was preaching was enough to get him into the third heaven there's a message of the hour that'll take you past just the third heaven it'll put you in a Rapture what makes you able to understand this the Jean seed of God you're a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see Jesus made the written word become a living reality because he had the habits of Jehovah because you watch Jehovah of the Old Testament walk out there in the scene of the Israelites and he walked out there and he breathed across the waters and the waters opened up and he watched Jehovah in flesh walk out there on the waters and said peace be still what was it it was the habits of Jehovah on the inside of Jesus what was it it was Jehovah of the old that stood back there that stood back there and he and he be to brother random said it like this that he rained down a few DW drops and therefore he brought forth bread so his people could eat it but it was Jehovah in the flesh that stood there and took two l two little fishes and five five five fishes and two loaves of bread and fed 5,000 what was it it was a habit of Jehovah and anybody anybody knows that a child carries the name of the father that they have the authority of the Father and Jesus said I come in my father's name if you come in your father's name there is power and authority when you are sent by the Father Like Jesus said my peace I give unto you and my peace I live may peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you now the Bible said in Romans 8:14 how many love the word for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage against fear but you have receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we might be also glorified together I love what brother Bram said here he said he said Christ couldn't help being what he was he was the son of God he said that's it he said you see what I mean he said see if you were intended you see the word of God you believe it why there's something new he says why he said have you ever heard of a strain in a family he said one a a son will kind of impersonate his father or mother or the grandfather grandmother The Strain that strain in that family you heard of it haven't you he said well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way that you did you're subject to the fall but being that you're predestinated you hear the word being that you're predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back to where you were predestinated that's a mouthful being that you're predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back to where you were predestinated he said I never saw it that way before he said it brings you right he said what makes you believe the word and turn down these other things he said there's something in you what made you turn down alcohol what made you turn down religion and accept Christ there's something in you come on somebody there's plenty of people that have religious spirits on them but you don't want just to be religious you want to have life come on somebody there's over 44,000 denominations now when the prophet was here there was 900 denominations 44,000 what made you turn them down come on somebody how many churches did you pass coming to church tonight what made you drive past them to come here there was something on the inside of you that made You Believe come on somebody when the message looks wrong to everybody else it's perfect to you because you and the word have become one [Applause] Romans 8:29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of the son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified then he also glorified he called you for a purpose you can't help being who you are come on somebody you can't help being Who You Are you might get a little excited when the preaching of the word comes your by your way but you can't help being who you are come on somebody if you feel a shout coming on go ahead and Shout but if all you feel is to clap your hands you can't help being who you are but Express the image that God saw what I love what I love about brother bis's Ministry is that he it was not just another Ministry brother Chester but he saw he captured the event of the Lord's coming in Bride form it captured this Messiah sign what you what you what you are enjoying and what you are rejoicing about is the event of the Lord coming what was it what was it it wasn't just a man it wasn't just a one one man message it was but now it has turned to a body move and now you are enjoying the inent the event of a restored word you can't help being who you are let me say this to you the Hawks can eat what they want to the buzzards can eat what they want to the chickens can eat what they want to but for me in my house we have got to have fresh man come on somebody I don't think myself any better than anybody else but I am called higher than Pentecostalism I am called higher than Methodist I am called higher than Luther this is eag age so we've got to eat an eagle food why we're a people for a purpose so if God's give us Eagle eyesight then we've got to have eagle's wings to fly to the realm of faith that he's destined us to be you see God knew what was on the inside of you it's just like brother brandom said when he said he said I climb in mountains he said I get all the way up there brother Chris he said I get all the way up there and he said I see the pygmy he said I see the pygmy Spruce he said them goats that live up that high he said they they eat on that piggy Spruce he said then you come on down he said then you got the pine tree then you got the quake and ASP he said if you keep coming down you got brush he said then you got grass he said then you got weeds he said all of them had a cell of life on the inside of him he said but it takes the intelligence of God to put them in the right place it takes the intelligence of God to put them in the right place let me say this to you you didn't get yourself here you didn't make yourself believe this but the intelligence of God has put you in an environment so that you could believe like a last day type of people that believe that believe that you're going in a Rapture that believe that all things are possible don't blame me it's the intelligence that put me in this environment let me tell you you could put me on the inside of a Pentecostal Church down here and I wouldn't last a second you could put me in a Lutheran Church and I wouldn't last a second you could put me in a Methodist Church and I wouldn't last a second because the Holy Ghost on the inside of the elect of God will make them run for truth I say un you come to the water the water's fine come on somebody you're built for this environment you're built for this atmosphere come on in the water's fine it's time that you un loosen the button and jump in the water and start drinking on this Pentecostal fresh experience and give almighty God a fresh drink don't let people make you think that you're Pentecostal you're Pentecostal in Your Heart by experience not by emotion you're Pentecostals just like Peter was don't blame me it's the environment that William Brandon built for me don't try to take me out of my astronut age don't try to take me out of my rocket fool don't try to take me out of my rocket ship I was built for a rapture Hallelujah and I got a purpose to leave here one of these days somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise You Can't fake it you can't fake it because God knows and Satan knows you're not going to Bluff the devil come on somebody you're not going to Bluff the devil he knows but when he sees the purchased product of the blood of Jesus Christ there it makes itan back off it's just like the woman at the whale she looked like she was supposed to live in an environment looked like she was supposed to live in an environment as a prostitute the rest of her life but somebody came by their way came by her way what did he do he watered that seed that was on the inside of her before she ever committed Her First Act of adultery what was it brother man said if it wouldn't have been for re representation by predestination he said it would have never took hold he said but because it was there he said there was something that took a hold of her I don't have to call your name but something took a hold of your life when the rest of the world tried to offer you everything else it never took hold but when Christ came and offered you this water this living water come on somebody it took a hold in your life he said now in Pentecost or Full Gospel people he said around the world he said I find them with great faith and he said and the reason they have faith is because they just stepped up a little bit further he said they've been born of the spirit of God which is the supernatural they have been born of the spirit of God which is the supernatural he said and many people tell me said well brother Brandon as you get older you look like your dad I love listening to this life he said well he's my dad he said that's the reason I look like him I love it when you all come you come tell me I I look like my grand day Homer had somebody tell me after this week God bless you if I look as good as him Grandma when he got 80 years old I feel like I'll be doing all right and if I can sing and dance like he did when he was 75 and 80 years old I feel like I'd be don't all right then I got people tell well when I hear you preach you sound exactly like your daddy if I wouldn't have been looking I'd have thought that was your daddy preaching you had to be looking cuz if you'd have looked you just saw the difference the reason why people say that is because there's a strain there there's something that identifies me with my grandfather and my my father there's things about them that I carry in my own natural genealogy he said well now the same thing he said many things that we have he said that we have by favor we favor our family he said by Family strain like that each other he said and then in the family strain of God he said if we become born of the spirit of God we take on the nature of God which then we are the sons of God and he said that's where I find them Full Gospel people aren't you glad to be Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle he said that's where I find that the Full Gospel people has become Sons and Daughters of God they believe the supernatural I'm happy to be identified that I believe the supernatural he said now the other has never stepped up there he said them others have never stepped up there so they can't believe the supernatural he said there's nothing in there to believe with that strain on the inside of you makes you believe the supernatural he puts something on the inside of you to believe with now you look out there Saul Saul could have never went down there and defeated Goliath he didn't have he didn't believe that he could he did not believe and neither did the rest of the Israelites believe but there was a little bitty old boy that made his way into the camp one day and O goath shouted out his shout way too long on the 40th Day it was his last time to said send me out of man you see the difference between Saul and David was David had something on the inside of him to believe with and he recognized that that was just some old man coming up there and pouring some kind of oil on top of me but he recognized that he anointed me for a purpose he anointed me to kill Goliath he anointed me to kill the kings of the amorites he anointed me to sit on the throne he had something on the inside of him sister dores to believe the supernatural brother Rand starts talking about how big Goliath was had the head of a washed up eyes like a boulder fingers 14 Ines long you better believe in the Supernatural but David believed so much in almighty God that the god that delivered him from the hands of the bear that the god that delivered him from the hands of the lon was almighty God the supernatural God that could deliver him from the B of this goath there brother man I love this and I'm I'm I'm coming to a close cuz I told you I told you last weekend that a farmer a farmer on knows his hay he knows his cattle and knows how much hay to roll out it's kind of like old farmer old farmer went to church one day and nobody else showed up except for the farmer it was him and the pastor sitting there and he said well Pastor I'm here you might as well preach to me so he sat down there on front row and the pastor preached he preached and he preached and he preached and he preached he preached he preached himself an hour and a half two hour sermon there Pastor went back to the back shook his hand he said well what you think about that he said well Pastor he said I he said that was real good he said he said I'm a farmer and he said when I take my hay out in the field and he said when only one cow comes out he said I only give him just half of the bail God bless our [Applause] farmers and brother brandham goes into believe in God he said and we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are HS according to the promise there you are he said and that brings not in our bodies we are Gentiles in our bodies we are sinners in our bodies but in our souls being born again with the same spirit that was upon faithful Abraham he said that strain down in there makes us want to trust God he said but the body gets scared he said oh if we're the children of Abraham let's be as Father Abraham was you see that strain on the inside of you makes you want to trust God when your body gets nervous when your body has bruises and it has all kinds of conditions on it your body gets scared and your mind starts playing tricks with you what is it how amazing that it is that as soon as you get some kind of illness that that LE osia has put a phobia on people well God bless I must be losing my memory I must I must be going down with it must be cancer I had that pain back what is it about what is it we are Gentiles in our bodies but in our souls but in our souls we are born again he said and that strain on the inside of us makes us trust God come on somebody how many times have you had a headache how many times have you had all kinds of conditions and the body got scared but there's something on the inside of you the all Jean SE of God raises up and said believe for healing believe for a miracle believe for a body change like a little Georgie Carter she had heard she had heard about God sent a prophet she'd heard about what this one done heard about this one how this one got healed but she had been raised in a church that had been taught not to believe in the Supernatural they raised her up that way so she heard about a prophet she heard about it she heard about healing that it was for her generation and her mama got all tore up because Georgie said God if you'll heal me I'll get up out of this bed and I'll go get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and it got her mama so worked up that she took on the py and slept she slept by the bed she hardly ever slept at night hardly slept during the day and she got so worked up and she called William brandham a con man an impostor said Lord you see you see this this impostor that's come in here and worked up my daughter mother man said she laid down he said she laid down at the kitchen table laid her head over there he said she laid her head down there and she saw a vision and she looked up and she saw as one coming out one coming out and she said it was Jesus Christ she said and about that same time the car door slammed and out stepped William brandom what she didn't realize is that William Brandon was being Jesus Christ to her but the vision made her realize that he was not an impostor he was not a con man you see if God if God is on your side he will make all things work for his good according to them that are called and Georgie had something something on the inside of her there was a strain that came from God that there would be a Ministry what would attach this miracle all the way through its entire Ministry of Malachi 4 and Men of this day have picked it up and ran with it that there she was a gentile in her body she was a sinner in her soul in her body but in her soul she believed the supernatural when she was taught wrong when she was raised wrong Lord the man William Brandon matched the image because when he walked in there and called Georgy called her out of that bed she got up out of there she didn't lay in her condition no more what was the very first thing she started doing she ran out there in the grass and started praising God got on the piano and started worshiping God what was it this little lamb that was back there in mil toown that was crying for help Georgie Carter Matt what that lamb was and when people taught wrong and when people believed wrong God knew where his lamb was and he came to the thicket of miltown and raised up Georgie Carter don't talk to me about your hurts don't talk to me about what men's done to you there's a God that's calling you out of the thicket he's Jehovah Gyra he'll provide himself a lamb [Applause] I'm going to read this and we're going to close and the angel of gone he said he's in a discernment line he said you're awful nervous aren't you lady he said that's a devil that makes you that way he said he said is really he said you think there's many things wrong he said but nervousness is what the main thing is is that makes you feel like everything's wrong he said like a like like a Black Bolt comes from from you like a cloud or something he said something waves like a breath moving he said you get scared many times in evening times he said but when the sun's sinking low you get real weary don't you is that right many times you you think you're going to lose your mind but you're not many times you think you're going to lose your mind but you're not many times you think you're going to give up but you're not many times you think you're not going to overcome you're going to fall but you're not going to fall many times you think you're going to lose your mind but you're not you'll last you'll last you'll last fear not you're going to be all right do you believe me as his servant now I'm reading this to you from a prophet but do you believe me as his servant you going to be all right you going to be all right now right now listen if this is right you've often prayed and one of the place where you could you could think you could set your foot to start from isn't that right this is your footstep you've often wanted to set your foot to start from is that right all right this is your footstep go now and be healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ have been made well and have faith in God you was not made to be nervous you was not made to be weary you was not here to be tormented by the devil but you was made here for a purpose what did the pillar fire show up in this generation for it was identifying that what William Brandon was preaching that Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of the new the pillar of fire showing up was showing us that William Brandon was teaching was thus saith the Lord that was not just William brandom's Pillar of Fire that's my Pillar of Fire it was not just this generation's Pillar of Fire it's my pillar fire I stood there in the halls of Washington and I thought how powerful that it was that our government spends billions and billions and billions of dollars to protect the picture of the pillar of Fire hanging up there in Washington DC spend all your tax money they're PR hallelujah it's hanging there as judgment to this generation that God sent a prophet it's a sign to us that you're a people for a purpose come on somebody but they can lock it away in its tube they can send it back there and say this is how you got to come get it but that Pillar of Fire is not locked up in DC it's locked up on the inside of a body believing Church of the Living God that was raised to be serpent bruisers devil destroyers giant Killers ordained by almighty God Blood Washed Blood Bought and were born for the Rapture somebody give God praise I'm a people for a purpose I believe when nobody else believes I will press on when nobody goes through I am I am that I am the I am lives in me so tell that devil I was born for a purpose and you can't have my purpose I was born to live this message and you can't take my message I was born for this so devil get out of my way hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah you've been through some circumstances but your circumstances are a part of your calling so just raise your head up little bride you will prevail God bless you let the musicians come and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony Jay you going to make it brother Don you going to make it brother Isaiah you're going to make it look at your neighbors you going to make it I'm a people for a purpose and God sent a message just for me if there's one going in a Rapture brother Timothy you're looking at that one you're looking at him if there's one going to Mir get a miracle you're looking at that one you better believe it like that you better believe you're the one that God's coming for if God saving one in Virginia I'm that one how many believers do we have in the house of God where
