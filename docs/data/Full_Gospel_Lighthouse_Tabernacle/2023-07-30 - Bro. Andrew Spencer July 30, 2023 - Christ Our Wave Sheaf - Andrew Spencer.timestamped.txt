[40:59] I would like to look over in The Book of
[41:01] Leviticus
[41:03] chapter 23 and verse 9.
[41:07] then to mark 16.
[41:09] and then to Revelations chapter one but
[41:12] we're first going to turn to a Leviticus
[41:15] chapter 23.
[41:17] and verse 9.
[41:32] hallelujah it's a good day to serve the
[41:34] Lord isn't it
[41:40] man
[41:43] all right Leviticus chapter 23 and verse
[41:47] 9 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[41:49] Speak unto the children of Israel and
[41:52] saying to them
[41:53] when you become into the land which I
[41:56] give unto you
[41:58] and shall reap the Harvest thereof then
[42:01] you shall bring a Sheaf of the
[42:03] firstfruits of your Harvest
[42:05] unto the priest
[42:07] and he shall wave the Sheaf before the
[42:10] Lord to be accepted for you on the moral
[42:13] after the Sabbath the priest shall wave
[42:17] it also Mark chapter 16. and verse 1.
[42:27] and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[42:30] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[42:33] and Salome
[42:35] had brought sweet spices and they that
[42:38] they might come and anoint him and very
[42:42] early in the morning the first day of
[42:44] the week they came under the Sepulcher
[42:47] at the rising of the Sun
[42:49] and they said amongst themselves who
[42:52] shall roll away roll us away the Stone
[42:54] from the door of the Sepulcher and when
[42:56] they had looked they saw
[42:58] that the stone was rolled away for it
[43:00] was very great and entering into the
[43:03] Sepulcher they saw a young man sitting
[43:05] on the right side clothed in a long
[43:08] white garment and they were frightened
[43:11] and he said unto them be not a
[43:13] frightened you seek Jesus of Nazareth
[43:16] which was crucified he is risen and he
[43:19] is not here behold the place where they
[43:23] laid him also Revelations chapter 1
[43:27] and verse 17.
[43:35] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[43:39] dead
[43:40] and he laid his right hand upon me
[43:42] saying unto me fear not for I am the
[43:45] first and the last I am he that liveth
[43:48] and was dead and behold I Am Alive
[43:51] forevermore amen and have the keys of
[43:55] hell and of death let's pray this
[43:57] morning Heavenly Father we come before
[43:59] you this morning Lord we lay our hands
[44:02] upon Thy word recognizing that we have
[44:04] read of the written word Lord but we
[44:07] recognize that this morning that we're
[44:09] your children that have gathered around
[44:11] the Living Word father and Lord we're
[44:13] asking father for a special time in the
[44:15] Lord today that there would be a great
[44:17] outpouring of your spirit here Lord that
[44:20] you would just do exceedingly abundantly
[44:22] above all that we could ask or think
[44:24] father I pray God that you would touch
[44:27] our hearts Lord and as we've come out
[44:29] here and fill this great Bank of Faith
[44:31] Lord that's pulsating in the room Lord
[44:33] we recognize that that is a sign that
[44:36] your children are ready to be fed this
[44:38] morning so father we we thank you for
[44:40] for allowing us to set an atmosphere of
[44:43] this style father where you can come and
[44:45] begin to inhabit the Praises of your
[44:47] people where your blessings can come
[44:49] upon your children and begin to minister
[44:51] to them in a supernatural way father we
[44:54] commit our life into your hands I pray
[44:56] God you help us get out of the way and
[44:58] do a good job for you today in Jesus
[45:00] name amen amen God bless you today you
[45:03] may be seated
[45:08] amen amen this morning we'd like to
[45:12] speak to you just for uh for a few
[45:14] moments on on Christ Christ our our wave
[45:18] Chief Christ Our wave Chief and we've
[45:21] read here in Leviticus chapter 23 as
[45:24] we'll just read this again just to get a
[45:26] context this morning in verse 10 he said
[45:28] when you become into the land which I
[45:31] give unto you and shall reap the Harvest
[45:34] thereof then ye shall bring a Sheaf of
[45:37] the firstfruits of your Harvest under
[45:40] the priest and he shall wave the Sheep
[45:42] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[45:45] on the morrow after the Sabbath the
[45:47] priest shall wave it excuse me
[46:11] everybody good this morning
[46:15] Hallelujah
[46:17] everybody good
[46:18] ready to have church this morning
[46:21] all right let's have church we recognize
[46:24] as we said we'd like to just speak to
[46:26] you on this thought it's something
[46:27] that's been laboring on our heart for
[46:30] some time and I've had dreams about it
[46:32] I've seen things about this service and
[46:34] it's been on my mind for quite some time
[46:37] but the Lord allowed us a spot to be
[46:39] able to speak it today so we'd like to
[46:41] speak this Christ Our wave Chief and
[46:44] we've seen here by the by the scripture
[46:46] reading that we've taken this morning
[46:48] that we recognized that there is no God
[46:51] like our God and that there is there is
[46:54] something very special that we are a
[46:56] part of in this generation to recognize
[46:58] that we're not just another group or
[47:00] another another selection or another
[47:02] building or another Association or an
[47:05] organization but we are part of
[47:07] something very special that only God
[47:09] himself could ordain and make manifest
[47:11] in the hour that we're living in we
[47:14] recognize that we're not watching a
[47:15] Jesus of 2000 years ago but we're
[47:18] watching Jesus of today live in an act
[47:21] and we recognize that that if God wants
[47:24] to come down and do specific things like
[47:26] he's doing we recognize that God's got
[47:29] intentions he doesn't just move to say
[47:31] that he moves he doesn't he has a
[47:33] purpose behind when he moves he doesn't
[47:34] just create to say that he did it he
[47:37] does it because he's got a purpose
[47:38] behind it and the reason why that we we
[47:41] teach the message here is because it
[47:44] aligns with the Bible and the age that
[47:46] we're living in that's why we preach the
[47:49] message of the hour here because we
[47:51] recognize that God has done something in
[47:54] this generation that he that he hasn't
[47:56] done for over 2 000 years it's God
[47:58] bringing in his elect and he's pulled
[48:01] off all the all the restraints he's
[48:03] pulled off all of the mechanical devices
[48:05] he's pulled off every little ISM and
[48:07] every Schism that has raised itself
[48:09] against the word of God God has done
[48:12] something very special in gathering of
[48:14] people that could come under the unity
[48:16] of the word of God and get under the
[48:18] same inspiration as the one that wrote
[48:20] the war word and we see that it's still
[48:23] Jesus of today as it was two thousand
[48:26] years ago and I I think it's an amazing
[48:28] thing that we can look out and we can
[48:30] see Jesus in our brothers and our
[48:32] sisters I think it's amazing thing
[48:33] because there was never anybody like
[48:36] Jesus David was a great man Moses was a
[48:39] great man Daniel was a great man Abraham
[48:42] was a great man but there was never that
[48:44] anybody that lived the kind of life like
[48:46] our lord Jesus lived like he did two
[48:48] thousand years ago they were they were
[48:50] gallantly and they were great prophets
[48:52] and even Jesus would say that there was
[48:54] no Prophet like John the Baptist he was
[48:57] the greatest of all the prophets but
[48:59] Jesus would say but he is more than a
[49:02] prophet because he was he was anointed
[49:04] to be a prophet of the age but he was a
[49:06] forerunner of the message that was
[49:08] coming and we recognize that Jesus would
[49:11] say but he that is least in the kingdom
[49:13] of God is greater than John so you
[49:15] recognize that your position is Christ
[49:17] in Christ is a very powerful thing but
[49:20] Jesus wasn't just a prophet Jesus wasn't
[49:23] just a good man that went about Healing
[49:25] The Sick and doing Miracles and Powers
[49:28] but there was something different about
[49:30] this man he he lived up to what he
[49:32] preached he didn't have to worry about
[49:33] falling to sin he didn't have no sin
[49:36] upon his life he didn't have no mistakes
[49:38] upon his life he he come from he come
[49:40] from a family what the natural eye
[49:42] looked at he come from a family that
[49:44] looked like it was an illegitimate child
[49:46] but he was neither Jew nor Gentile he
[49:49] was almighty God you see if he was Jew
[49:52] and or he was Gentile then you and I are
[49:55] in a bad shape this morning but because
[49:57] he was more than a man because he was
[50:00] more than a prophet we recognize that we
[50:03] are serving a God that had the idea to
[50:06] take upon himself
[50:08] to take upon himself to become a part of
[50:11] who we are to understand like us to have
[50:14] Humanity to have flesh to have headaches
[50:17] to be sick to have things up in his body
[50:19] to be tired to be worn out he took upon
[50:22] himself the robe of humanity to
[50:24] understand like humanity and Satan so
[50:27] hates the very word of God that he's
[50:29] tried to destroy the seed word which is
[50:32] Christ he's tried to destroy the very
[50:34] manifestation of the seed word he tried
[50:37] to stop it in David he tried to stop it
[50:39] in Moses but he couldn't stop it because
[50:42] Christ was going to come he come down
[50:44] through a lineage of mistakes of of the
[50:47] five ladies of Grace but Christ was
[50:49] going to get there but Satan knew that
[50:51] there was a seed line that was coming
[50:53] because it was prophesied all the way
[50:55] back in the Book of Genesis that his
[50:58] seed would bruise the head of the
[51:01] serpent so there Satan was looking for
[51:03] that seed line he was watching for it to
[51:06] come and Satan is trying to destroy the
[51:09] very power of the word and the effect of
[51:11] the word because the word is a seed and
[51:13] if he can get to that seed he can
[51:15] destroy it if he can get to it before it
[51:17] gets into the ground he can destroy the
[51:19] purpose but today he cannot destroy he
[51:23] cannot destroy God's word he can maybe
[51:25] missed it or throw it off of timing of
[51:28] things but he cannot stop the very word
[51:30] of God and to recognize today that you
[51:33] have on the inside of you The Germ seed
[51:36] of life he was the seed word but what
[51:39] was deposited in the elect of God is the
[51:42] same life
[51:43] you have the spirit with measure he had
[51:46] the spirit without measure but to
[51:48] recognize that the same chemicals that
[51:50] was in Jesus's body is in your body but
[51:54] we recognize that power how powerful
[51:56] Jesus was that when when Jesus came and
[51:59] he resurrected his friend by the name of
[52:01] Lazarus that would come and allow him to
[52:03] live in his home for a certain time that
[52:05] after he resurrected him that there went
[52:08] out there went out a a council from the
[52:11] Pharisees that they took the council
[52:13] that they were going to try to destroy
[52:16] Jesus and and kill Jesus but you see
[52:18] what they were doing they were lacking
[52:20] the revelation of who Jesus was you see
[52:23] if they'd recognize their day in their
[52:25] message they would have understood who
[52:27] Jesus was but they were living under the
[52:29] light or the glare of the law but they
[52:32] didn't recognize that a new dispensation
[52:34] was at hand but you see the message that
[52:36] they were preaching it had an expiration
[52:38] date on it because the Lamb of God which
[52:41] John saw when he was standing there
[52:43] baptizing on the Jordan Banks he said
[52:45] Behold the Lamb of God has come and what
[52:49] did this this Forerunner do in this age
[52:52] he said Behold the Lamb of God
[52:55] what was it it's it's an hour there the
[52:58] hour that they were living in was in an
[53:01] expiration date and though churches and
[53:03] the World Council of churches has an
[53:05] expiration date but this message does
[53:08] not have an expiration date upon it
[53:10] come on somebody the message that the
[53:13] Pharisees was preaching it was no longer
[53:15] effect when Jesus came and he took upon
[53:18] him the force of the law he was Grace
[53:21] into a generation where they couldn't
[53:22] live the law but he was the law
[53:25] Hallelujah he proved that it could be
[53:27] lived
[53:29] Hallelujah let's Preach Today he proved
[53:32] the message could be left he proved that
[53:34] he was the one that Moses saw at back
[53:37] there in a burning bush he proved what
[53:39] Ezekiel was when he saw him back
[53:41] clearing the wheel in the middle of the
[53:43] wheel he proved what Daniel saw
[53:45] Hallelujah a stone that was cut out of a
[53:48] mountain
[53:49] Hallelujah he proved that he could live
[53:51] the message but they said when they
[53:53] tried to kill Jesus that they prevailed
[53:56] and their effects had no no power to
[53:58] them at all you see the more Jesus
[54:00] preached the more people came the more
[54:03] he preached more faith grew the more he
[54:06] preached more miracles happen the more
[54:08] he preached the more they were afforded
[54:11] Hallelujah you see you try to stop fire
[54:14] with gasoline you're only going to make
[54:16] it burn a little bit hotter and you try
[54:18] to stop this message you try to stop my
[54:21] Jesus what are you doing you're simply
[54:23] waving the fans and we met a went
[54:26] through some tough times we may have
[54:27] been through some trials but it's only
[54:29] made us grow stronger
[54:33] come on somebody they could throw Daniel
[54:35] in a lion's den but it didn't stop it
[54:37] they could throw David in a valley but
[54:39] it Goliath couldn't kill him they could
[54:41] put the three Hebrew children in a fire
[54:43] but it didn't stop them they can put us
[54:45] through all the laodicea every trial
[54:48] that rises up against us we're going to
[54:50] press our way and Crest every wave
[54:55] oh it's Jesus on the inside he's working
[55:00] on the outside he's making a difference
[55:03] in my life
[55:07] come on somebody they couldn't stop the
[55:10] people from Believing on him they tried
[55:12] with all their ideas but they still
[55:14] believed
[55:16] they hung him on a cross
[55:18] they put him in a grave they killed him
[55:21] until all the skies and the Suns and the
[55:23] moons refused to shine they hung him
[55:26] they put him in a grave but they didn't
[55:28] stop the effects of the message
[55:31] they've created websites they've created
[55:33] all kinds of things to stop it but there
[55:36] is a new era at hand the unbelief will
[55:39] not hold us back critics will not hold
[55:41] us back Skeptics will not hold us back
[55:44] depression will not hold us back
[55:50] ah I'm gunning for the devil today
[55:53] telling you there's nothing that is that
[55:56] is formed against you it's going to
[55:57] prosper there's a new era at hand where
[56:00] the Church of the Living God and we
[56:02] won't back up we won't get off of our
[56:04] promises we believe Jesus is Jesus
[56:07] well I don't know if I can believe a god
[56:10] like it let me tell you the god that I'm
[56:12] serving is the only God that there ever
[56:15] will be when all your Gods die Jesus
[56:17] will still be Jesus
[56:20] take your religion take your formalism
[56:22] take your intellect take your ideas but
[56:25] Jesus will still be king
[56:27] [Applause]
[56:29] Hallelujah now the Bible says in Hebrews
[56:32] 7 and 23 that they truly were many
[56:35] priests because they were not suffered
[56:38] to continue by reason of death but this
[56:40] man because he it because he continueth
[56:43] forever hath an unchangeable priesthood
[56:46] you see he was made after the order of
[56:49] Melchizedek which has the power of an
[56:51] endless life those Jewish priests were
[56:53] they were all imperfect they were all
[56:56] sinful men you remember when they would
[56:58] go in and they would offer a sacrifice
[57:00] before the Church of Israel the children
[57:03] of Israel that they first had to make a
[57:06] sacrifice for her themselves before they
[57:08] can offer a sacrifice for anybody else
[57:10] so these men were imperfect they could
[57:13] give no peace this sacrifice that they
[57:15] were offering could give no peace to the
[57:17] man's conscience there was need of
[57:19] something greater and something better
[57:21] and you go to reading the book of
[57:23] Hebrews you'll find that Paul's text and
[57:26] his thoughts that were transpired to us
[57:28] that is bringing to to us that the the
[57:31] law the law was was weak in this that it
[57:34] could not be making you made make you
[57:36] clean and make you manifest but what we
[57:39] needed was something greater and
[57:41] something better that's why Jesus came
[57:43] he didn't come to do away with the law
[57:45] he came to magnify the law
[57:48] you see these men couldn't live the
[57:50] message these men they they were doing
[57:52] their job under the levitically
[57:54] levitical priesthood and Jesus would say
[57:57] to them when he was giving out the
[57:59] levitical law in the book of Elizabeth
[58:00] he says there he says there he said all
[58:04] the Levites are mine they were in the
[58:07] correct order but yet there was no power
[58:10] to make them live what they were
[58:12] preaching but in our Lord Jesus Christ
[58:16] they offered Millions upon millions of
[58:19] lambs but they never had the power to
[58:22] wash away the sins but when my Jesus
[58:24] died
[58:26] one time once and for all I don't have
[58:28] to go up there and beat myself hang
[58:31] Jesus back on the cross one time once
[58:34] and for all
[58:36] [Music]
[58:37] elujah
[58:39] it's the absolute perfection
[58:41] what he did was complete and his office
[58:43] never needs to change notice what it
[58:46] says in verse 25 wherefore he is able
[58:49] also to save to the uttermost that means
[58:52] when you think he's done saving he keeps
[58:54] on saving
[58:56] when you think he's reached his limits
[58:58] he's just getting to where he's starting
[59:01] he's able to save to the uttermost that
[59:03] come unto God by him seeing he ever
[59:05] liveth to make intercession for them for
[59:08] such a high priest became us who is Holy
[59:10] harmless undefiled separated from
[59:13] Sinners and made higher than the heavens
[59:15] don't you recognize how how big our God
[59:18] is
[59:20] Hallelujah but we recognize that he was
[59:24] the first one to come to maturity you
[59:28] see what the scriptures have said when
[59:30] you become into the land which I give
[59:32] you it was their possession but God was
[59:35] the one that was giving it unto them
[59:37] what does the land represent it doesn't
[59:40] represent the Millennium but the land
[59:42] Ray it represents our holy ghost that
[59:46] when I bring you to the position that
[59:48] you are destined to be in when I bring
[59:50] you to the place that your mothers when
[59:52] they were when they were in agony and
[59:54] they were in travail when they were
[59:56] birthing you and they claimed your name
[59:58] spoke your name they were setting your
[1:00:00] destiny for your location where you
[1:00:03] would live in the promised land and when
[1:00:06] you come into the place that I've
[1:00:08] destined you to live in Hallelujah there
[1:00:11] you shall offer unto me the way sheath
[1:00:15] oh Lord have mercy now that wave sheath
[1:00:18] it consisted of an Omer a barley and
[1:00:21] what it was let me just illustrate this
[1:00:23] just for you for a moment it was an Omer
[1:00:26] a barley that was still on the stalk
[1:00:28] that the that the person that had sown
[1:00:31] the seed into the ground he sold it out
[1:00:34] there believing that it would come up
[1:00:36] again because he knew that there was
[1:00:38] power in that seat that he was going to
[1:00:40] deposit so he takes the seed he places
[1:00:43] it in the ground and when it comes up
[1:00:45] the first one that came to maturity he
[1:00:48] took it before the high priest and the
[1:00:51] high priest would come out upon not just
[1:00:55] any day but on Sunday he would come up
[1:00:58] and he would wave it before the Lord so
[1:01:02] that it would be accepted that this was
[1:01:04] the first fruits
[1:01:06] what was it it was a sign unto them that
[1:01:10] they believed that there was more that
[1:01:11] was coming so so hear the high priest
[1:01:14] the man or the worshiper brings his
[1:01:17] offering to the high priest he brings it
[1:01:19] to the high priest the high priest takes
[1:01:21] him before the Lord and he begins to
[1:01:23] wave the offering before the Lord but so
[1:01:29] you see an offering is not an offering
[1:01:31] unless it's accepted by the Lord you see
[1:01:34] you cannot offer anything unto the Lord
[1:01:36] you cannot really Worship the Lord
[1:01:39] unless it's a sacrifice
[1:01:41] come on somebody you know what it's like
[1:01:43] to worship when you don't feel like
[1:01:45] worshiping that's a sacrifice to worship
[1:01:48] and here this this brother it's the
[1:01:52] first thing he ain't ate yet
[1:01:54] but he's coming to a spot where he
[1:01:56] recognizes that he takes his tithes
[1:01:59] before the Lord and the high priest
[1:02:01] begins to wave it before the Lord
[1:02:05] he waves it before the Lord so what is
[1:02:08] it it's a sign that there's more coming
[1:02:10] so you see the first fruit was accepted
[1:02:14] on Sunday you see it wasn't on Saturday
[1:02:17] but it was on Sunday that it was way
[1:02:20] before the Lord the sheath which was
[1:02:22] first of your seed that you planted when
[1:02:25] it comes up it ripened you cut it down
[1:02:26] the sheath and you took it before the
[1:02:28] priest
[1:02:30] he said but no he said this ain't Sunday
[1:02:33] no more he said it's not the Roman word
[1:02:36] Sunday he said but it's s-o-n-day it's
[1:02:40] Sunday again the prophet had the
[1:02:42] authority to say that where you're
[1:02:44] living in is Sunday
[1:02:46] it's the son of man living in this hour
[1:02:49] what did it say in Luke 17 and 30 that
[1:02:52] at the revealing of the son of man shall
[1:02:54] these things be when you look out upon
[1:02:57] the world and you see Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:02:59] living at its Heights it's a sign that
[1:03:02] the son of man should be here
[1:03:04] hallelujah hallelujah you see what it
[1:03:07] was it was a Sunday he was the first he
[1:03:10] was the first one that come to maturity
[1:03:12] and Jesus said except a corn of wheat be
[1:03:16] planted in the ground or Fallen to the
[1:03:18] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[1:03:20] it die it bringeth forth much more fruit
[1:03:24] you see this one seed that was planted
[1:03:27] that was planted in the ground that that
[1:03:30] worshiper knew what he was doing he was
[1:03:32] going out there under the inspiration of
[1:03:35] Moses taking his seat out there and
[1:03:38] sowing it in the ground what was he
[1:03:40] operating under he was operating under a
[1:03:42] prophet's Ministry and he took under his
[1:03:45] prophet's Ministry and he brought his
[1:03:47] worship under a prophet's Ministry he
[1:03:50] was doing everything according to what
[1:03:53] the scripture said and when the first
[1:03:55] wave Chief was waived it was a sign that
[1:03:59] there was more coming do you recognize
[1:04:01] when Jesus was hung up on a cross he was
[1:04:04] a sign for us
[1:04:06] but it was not a sign for our death it
[1:04:08] was a sign for our life
[1:04:11] Hallelujah
[1:04:13] come on somebody let's Preach Today
[1:04:16] to be waived over the congregation and
[1:04:19] when he was waived on the day of
[1:04:21] Pentecost what was he doing he was
[1:04:23] waving goodbye to the rest of the world
[1:04:25] and he was ascending upon high in the
[1:04:28] presence of the people you see what this
[1:04:30] sign was is that Jacob and Joseph told
[1:04:33] those Israelites don't you bury my bones
[1:04:35] down here
[1:04:37] because they knew that the first fruits
[1:04:39] was not going to come from Egypt they
[1:04:40] knew there was no Resurrection there but
[1:04:43] it was coming to them in Palestine he
[1:04:45] would tell them don't you leave my bones
[1:04:46] down here the wave offering isn't going
[1:04:48] to be offered here the sign isn't here
[1:04:51] the signs up there in Palestine
[1:04:54] you see that seed has got to have a
[1:04:56] certain environment it's got to have a
[1:04:58] certain environment it's got to have an
[1:04:59] atmosphere and I recognize that you
[1:05:02] can't be exact you can't produce your
[1:05:04] potentials unless you got the right
[1:05:06] atmosphere
[1:05:07] come on somebody you are the Bride of
[1:05:10] Jesus Christ and you take you stick your
[1:05:13] seed over in some watered-down gospel
[1:05:15] it'll never produce who you are but you
[1:05:17] get it in the right atmosphere
[1:05:20] you get it in the right atmosphere or
[1:05:21] the right environment that seed will
[1:05:23] come to life in you what did Jesus say
[1:05:25] when he was teaching us about the power
[1:05:27] of the seed in Luke chapter 8 he told us
[1:05:30] that some of them fell on Stony ground
[1:05:32] and they sprung up but because when the
[1:05:36] sun rose it burned them out because they
[1:05:38] lack moisture and the reason why some
[1:05:41] people are living where they're living
[1:05:43] is because they're lacking moisture and
[1:05:45] William branham's head and wisdom verse
[1:05:47] his face he said this the atmosphere has
[1:05:49] got to be right and it can't be
[1:05:51] intellect it can't be knowledge but it's
[1:05:54] got to be a spirit word a spirit born
[1:05:57] Spirit-filled son and daughter of God
[1:06:00] if you want to produce a bride you got
[1:06:02] to get an atmosphere of the Bride
[1:06:06] you can have all the potentials but
[1:06:08] something's got to draw it out of you if
[1:06:11] you're going to believe in miracles
[1:06:12] somebody's got to preach it right
[1:06:14] if you're going to believe in healing
[1:06:15] somebody's got to teach it right if
[1:06:17] you're going to believe for a Rapture
[1:06:19] somebody's got to teach it right if you
[1:06:21] believe you can overcome somebody's got
[1:06:22] to teach you to your right you might
[1:06:24] have been sitting there in that
[1:06:25] atmosphere of living where you were
[1:06:27] living at all the time of your life and
[1:06:29] never recognize how powerful you were
[1:06:31] but you were not a chicken to be going
[1:06:33] do you begin with you were born to fly a
[1:06:36] little bit higher
[1:06:38] let me drop this to you you have been
[1:06:40] released to soar to another level that's
[1:06:43] why John would say in Revelation chapter
[1:06:45] 4 come up a little bit higher you've
[1:06:47] been released you're no longer bound
[1:06:50] what did William Brandon say when he
[1:06:52] went a pair to that zoo and he's seen
[1:06:53] that eagle up there in that cage what
[1:06:55] did he see he said oh how I would have
[1:06:57] gave everything that I had just to
[1:06:59] release it he said but the worst thing
[1:07:01] about that he said more worse than
[1:07:03] seeing an eagle that's caged up when it
[1:07:05] was born to fly he's a son and daughter
[1:07:06] of God that's born to live as a son and
[1:07:08] daughter of God but Satan's got them all
[1:07:11] so ensnared under the power of sin that
[1:07:14] they don't live to the potential that
[1:07:15] they're supposed to live in
[1:07:17] but there is a Christ that is here to
[1:07:20] set you free that's where you can say oh
[1:07:23] brother Joel o House of Hell give way
[1:07:27] Satan you're an offense to me go away in
[1:07:30] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:32] there's something laying on the inside
[1:07:33] of you that's got to be released you
[1:07:35] remember that story about that duck that
[1:07:37] duck that was up there in that chicken
[1:07:38] peeing all those years
[1:07:41] is a his so-called mama told him he was
[1:07:43] a chicken but something just didn't feel
[1:07:45] right about it
[1:07:47] denominations told you that you never
[1:07:49] live out there this is what you were
[1:07:51] built to live in but there's something
[1:07:53] different about you your day was
[1:07:55] something on the inside of you that it
[1:07:56] just couldn't satisfy
[1:08:00] but that duck one day because he was
[1:08:02] duck he didn't care about the water he
[1:08:04] didn't care about the rain he was born
[1:08:06] for the rain the rest of the chickens
[1:08:09] was in the hand was in the pen but that
[1:08:11] duck was out there just going around the
[1:08:13] pen but one day his mama messed up
[1:08:16] she took him around the side of the
[1:08:18] house or the side of that little chicken
[1:08:19] coop and when he got the smell of water
[1:08:22] she wasn't going to stop him no more and
[1:08:24] when I got a sight of this message
[1:08:27] what no devil in hell gonna stop me from
[1:08:29] getting to where I needed to be I don't
[1:08:31] smell the waters Brothers
[1:08:34] I didn't smelt the waters and I didn't
[1:08:37] see any work on your life so I believe
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:41] if I can preach this message then you
[1:08:43] can have it
[1:08:45] you might be sitting there and you might
[1:08:47] be ensnared in sin but old duck it's
[1:08:49] time to head for the waters
[1:08:52] come on somebody the waters are here the
[1:08:55] waters are right
[1:08:59] oh
[1:09:01] God's gonna give my praise
[1:09:04] God's gonna give my praise devil get out
[1:09:08] of my way cause God's gonna get my
[1:09:11] praise
[1:09:12] I don't care how long you've been
[1:09:14] ensnared you might be in heaven have
[1:09:16] thoughts or you are chicken but you
[1:09:18] always felt different look different you
[1:09:20] are an eagle to be going with
[1:09:23] it's time to fly where you were destined
[1:09:25] to fly there may be been that tried to
[1:09:27] keep you in the atmosphere of wisdom but
[1:09:30] you are born for the Revelation there
[1:09:32] might be men that try to keep you in
[1:09:33] intellect but you are born for
[1:09:35] revelation
[1:09:36] there might be men to keep you bound
[1:09:38] down but you are born for the rapture
[1:09:42] what is it is assigned to us that's who
[1:09:45] you are when there's something that's
[1:09:47] drawing you when you begin to watch so
[1:09:49] drawing power of the Holy Ghost work
[1:09:52] upon a person's life you're witnessing
[1:09:54] that Christ is at work
[1:09:58] you was in some spots and he couldn't
[1:10:00] get out of them like Ruth was in a spot
[1:10:02] she was a moabitus was in a was in a
[1:10:04] nation that was cursed by God but she
[1:10:06] had a purpose that she was going to
[1:10:08] fulfill
[1:10:10] she had a place that God had chosen her
[1:10:12] fur that there there's a place of God
[1:10:15] swelling that she was going to be but
[1:10:17] you remember about Ruth her first
[1:10:19] husband was dead
[1:10:20] her first husband was dead and you
[1:10:23] remember that's the key of invisible
[1:10:24] Union that your first husband or your
[1:10:27] first Union has got to be dead you see
[1:10:29] the only reason why you're in the
[1:10:31] picture little bride and that you're
[1:10:33] able to represent Heaven is because you
[1:10:35] separated from your first Union the only
[1:10:39] reason that you are part of God's plan
[1:10:41] is because you disannode your first
[1:10:44] Union
[1:10:46] that first husband held you down that
[1:10:48] first husband makes you sin that first
[1:10:50] husband made you paint up your face that
[1:10:52] first husband made you act any way you
[1:10:54] wanted to act but when you separate it
[1:10:57] yourself from your first husband
[1:11:00] now look the first husband's got to be
[1:11:02] dead
[1:11:04] I'm preaching you the message your first
[1:11:06] husband's got to be dead and when he's
[1:11:08] dead then you can come under the liberty
[1:11:11] of the marriage of the lamb and when
[1:11:14] your first Fusion First Union has been
[1:11:16] broken
[1:11:17] sin has broke off of your life hail has
[1:11:20] been broke off of your life anxiety's
[1:11:22] been broke off of your life
[1:11:24] so brother Andrew how you preaching like
[1:11:26] that it's because I understand
[1:11:30] I know what it's like to be trapped I
[1:11:32] know what it's like to be ensnared but I
[1:11:34] know what it's like to be free I'm not
[1:11:36] like Johnny Crow waiting on somebody to
[1:11:39] tell me that I'm free I know that I'm
[1:11:41] free
[1:11:42] and you might be sitting there in your
[1:11:44] condition think you're still ensnared by
[1:11:46] sin but I'm telling you to fly
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:54] notice what he says here he said well
[1:11:56] you separated from your first Union by
[1:11:58] spiritual death now you are born again
[1:12:00] or remarried again to a new spiritual
[1:12:03] union of not your natural life for the
[1:12:05] things of the world but of eternal life
[1:12:07] that germ that was in you at the
[1:12:10] beginning found you now your own book is
[1:12:12] gone with your old union now your name
[1:12:15] now your name and your older in your has
[1:12:18] been transferred now you say do you mean
[1:12:20] to tell me that my old book God had put
[1:12:23] it in the sea of God's forgetfulness and
[1:12:26] you stand perfectly before God
[1:12:30] God loses none of his
[1:12:34] and Ruth those who may have been down
[1:12:36] there may have been worshiping the
[1:12:38] moabitus gods and worshiping and all
[1:12:41] kinds of things but when Ruth comes into
[1:12:43] the picture she comes into the picture
[1:12:45] into Bethlehem at the beginning of the
[1:12:48] barley Harvest I think it's powerful
[1:12:50] where you're living at you're not just
[1:12:52] entering into the scene at any uncertain
[1:12:54] time but you're here little bride at
[1:12:57] Harvest Time
[1:12:58] your inner here in Bethlehem and
[1:13:01] Bethlehem is a very powerful place
[1:13:02] there's all kinds of spots in the
[1:13:04] scriptures that we could go to it was
[1:13:06] David's Home Place he was it's Bethlehem
[1:13:09] it's known as the house of God's breath
[1:13:12] it is Beth lahim it is the house of
[1:13:17] God's bread it was this place where
[1:13:19] Jacob were sitting there and he seen a
[1:13:21] vision of the latter coming down and
[1:13:23] Angels ascending and descending upon
[1:13:25] that ladder and then Jacob returned and
[1:13:27] they begin to Worship the Lord right
[1:13:29] there at Bethlehem he built an altar
[1:13:31] there it was known in the scripture that
[1:13:34] Bethlehem was the smallest of all the
[1:13:37] nations of Judah
[1:13:39] of all the thousands she was the least
[1:13:42] amongst them but the scriptures had
[1:13:44] declared that there would be a ruler
[1:13:46] that would rise out of Bethlehem if you
[1:13:49] want to be a ruler you've got to go to
[1:13:51] Bethlehem
[1:13:53] I'm going to listen a while a little
[1:13:54] Bethlehem you'll see where William
[1:13:56] random comes and he preaches to us why
[1:13:58] it had to be Bethlehem there couldn't
[1:14:00] have been no other spot that Jesus could
[1:14:02] be born in because he said I am the
[1:14:05] bread of life and if you're going to
[1:14:08] have God's Bread Basket you got to go to
[1:14:10] Bethlehem if you're going to get filled
[1:14:12] with the Holy Ghost you got to go to
[1:14:14] Bethlehem
[1:14:16] foreign
[1:14:17] notice when when Ruth comes in to the
[1:14:20] scene
[1:14:22] Boaz is in the midst of harvest
[1:14:27] it's getting ready to be Pentecost
[1:14:30] and the Chiefs are getting ready to be
[1:14:31] waived and you notice that salmon is the
[1:14:35] one that sets up and founds Bethlehem
[1:14:38] he marries
[1:14:40] a harlot
[1:14:42] that's going to produce a Boathouse
[1:14:45] but you see God's Got A Plan he's got a
[1:14:48] plan that's bigger than your Humanity
[1:14:50] he's got a plan that's bigger than your
[1:14:52] DNA he's got an idea about you that
[1:14:56] maybe you don't fully understand but
[1:14:58] because you are in God's mind there is
[1:15:00] nothing that the devil can do that can
[1:15:03] stop you or get you out of God's mind
[1:15:05] you remember Jesus said that no man can
[1:15:08] pluck them from my hand salmon set this
[1:15:11] up and here Boaz is coming on the scene
[1:15:15] Bethlehem is known as the one of the
[1:15:18] greatest spots even today as the
[1:15:21] greatest grazing spots for livestock
[1:15:24] to this day it's known for the greatest
[1:15:27] spots for watering Watering your camel
[1:15:29] said it's got the sweetest Waters so you
[1:15:32] can go and get fed there and you can go
[1:15:34] and get the sweetest Waters there you
[1:15:36] remember when David is up there and he's
[1:15:38] looking out across the hills and he said
[1:15:40] oh I long for the Waters of Bethlehem so
[1:15:44] he set out a decree these men took the
[1:15:46] king's desire what was it the Father the
[1:15:49] the the Philistines had garest in
[1:15:52] themselves around Bethlehem they were
[1:15:55] trying to guard the sweetest Waters what
[1:15:58] is the devil trying to do today he's
[1:16:00] trying to guard the sweetest Waters and
[1:16:03] the greatest Bread Basket that there
[1:16:06] ever has been what is the devil trying
[1:16:08] to do he's trying to keep you from
[1:16:10] Bethlehem
[1:16:13] what is it
[1:16:15] what is his League of councils trying to
[1:16:17] do they're trying to keep you Garrison
[1:16:18] off from the water that's laying there
[1:16:21] in Bethlehem but Naomi when she watches
[1:16:24] Ruth come into her position she comes to
[1:16:26] the land where she where Naomi it's her
[1:16:28] home place she's born to be here her
[1:16:31] she's destined to be in this position
[1:16:33] and Ruth goes out there her first
[1:16:36] husband is dead she goes out there in
[1:16:38] the field what does Boaz tell her you
[1:16:41] stay right here in this field don't you
[1:16:43] get off on some idea don't you get off
[1:16:45] on some other religion you stay right
[1:16:47] here in this ceiling you stay in this
[1:16:49] message don't you get off my thoughts
[1:16:51] don't you get off what I preach don't
[1:16:53] you get because I got something that's
[1:16:55] going to take care of you
[1:16:56] Naomi when she watch row when she watch
[1:17:00] Ruth come back from the first day and
[1:17:03] she'd seen what Ruth had got she'd
[1:17:05] garnered five days worth of barley
[1:17:08] she said who is the man that took
[1:17:11] knowledge of you
[1:17:13] what did Boaz do he told him to drop
[1:17:16] handfuls on purpose for her what is it
[1:17:19] the ministry of Boaz today he is telling
[1:17:22] her drop the message
[1:17:25] preach the message give her what she
[1:17:27] needs come on somebody you're not going
[1:17:30] to be known as Ruth for more about it
[1:17:32] it's going to time for a change
[1:17:35] oh hallelujah what was it she recognized
[1:17:39] and she said blessed is he these men
[1:17:42] were under direction of Boaz because he
[1:17:45] recognized that there was some great
[1:17:47] power that was coming Naomi knew
[1:17:50] that there was somebody that had been
[1:17:52] their redeemer
[1:17:56] somebody was going to step in
[1:17:59] and take the place
[1:18:01] there was somebody closer
[1:18:05] Satan had some rights on you
[1:18:08] Bobo ass stood up
[1:18:11] your families your family showed you out
[1:18:14] to sin but Boaz stood up for you
[1:18:17] you're failing all kinds of things but
[1:18:20] Boaz stood up for you Naomi looked up
[1:18:23] there and recognized that that was her
[1:18:25] near to Kin her goel had stood up for
[1:18:27] Ruth said you just wait here you just
[1:18:30] wait right here let him do the work you
[1:18:33] can rest about this Ruth you ain't got
[1:18:35] to get hot and bothered about it boy ass
[1:18:37] is going to do what he said he's going
[1:18:38] to do stop trying to work your way into
[1:18:40] salvation our Boaz has already done the
[1:18:43] work he kicked his shoe off and threw
[1:18:45] off the Robes of of his righteousness
[1:18:47] and proved himself that he was a worthy
[1:18:50] one
[1:18:53] I feel Ten Thousand Angels surrounding
[1:18:55] us this morning there is a God that
[1:18:58] thought that you was worthy enough that
[1:19:00] he could come and take upon him the
[1:19:02] Robes of humanity to be made like you
[1:19:05] and job looked out there and he seen
[1:19:07] your Redeemer and he said I know that my
[1:19:11] redeemer lives
[1:19:13] what did he do he looked out there and
[1:19:14] saw the I am the same one the I am that
[1:19:18] was seen over there in Revelations
[1:19:19] chapter one that I am he that was dead
[1:19:22] but I Am Alive forevermore
[1:19:25] what did he do he conquered the Trinity
[1:19:27] of Satan he conquered hell he conquered
[1:19:30] death he conquered the grave when you
[1:19:32] feel like you ain't a conqueror he's
[1:19:34] more than a conqueror when you feel like
[1:19:36] giving up he did not give up
[1:19:41] what did he do he conquered death and
[1:19:44] when Annika told you a few weekends ago
[1:19:45] everything below death once it's
[1:19:48] conquered everything else below it is
[1:19:50] powerless
[1:19:51] you kick death out everything below it's
[1:19:54] powerless
[1:19:56] what am I saying to you
[1:19:58] there was somebody that was waived
[1:20:01] before you
[1:20:02] you see that word is the only reality
[1:20:06] that word will raise a dead body that's
[1:20:11] what Romans 8 and 11 tells us therefore
[1:20:13] this quickening power if it being you
[1:20:17] in a quick in your motor bodies you see
[1:20:20] what Christ was he was the first fruits
[1:20:22] of them that slept
[1:20:25] but what happened there what happened
[1:20:27] there what he was waived over the people
[1:20:30] but this was really the first fruits of
[1:20:33] them that slept everybody that went by
[1:20:36] the way of the Grave they never seen him
[1:20:37] no more but when Jesus came
[1:20:41] he was the first fruits of them that
[1:20:43] slept he was waived over the promise
[1:20:45] seed and promised and that they had
[1:20:47] promised of life upon it
[1:20:50] you see now
[1:20:52] when the wave Chief was offered
[1:20:54] when the wave Chief was offered
[1:20:57] it was a sign
[1:20:59] there's more coming
[1:21:05] don't you see who you are you're a
[1:21:08] representative of Heaven
[1:21:09] you can imagine as a farmer is working
[1:21:12] over his field
[1:21:13] he sees the anticipation of the first
[1:21:16] fruits coming to fruition he's looking
[1:21:18] out there he's waiting for the certain
[1:21:19] time it's got to be offered on Sunday
[1:21:22] and he's looking for the right time and
[1:21:24] he sees it can you imagine the
[1:21:26] anticipation of the farmer as he's
[1:21:28] looking out there and he sees his seed
[1:21:30] the original seed that he planted in the
[1:21:32] ground as he sees it goes into the
[1:21:34] ground and it comes and it brings forth
[1:21:36] can you imagine the anticipation what
[1:21:38] was that first fruit it was a sign it
[1:21:41] was a proof that there was more coming
[1:21:43] and when God raised up on Easter morning
[1:21:46] it was a sign that there was more coming
[1:21:49] there was going to be men that would
[1:21:51] raise and Conquer death there would be
[1:21:53] men that would raise and Conquer The
[1:21:55] Devil there would be men that would
[1:21:56] raise and overcome the powers of Satan
[1:21:59] there would be men that would raise and
[1:22:01] overcome the hell that would come
[1:22:03] against them it was a sign Hallelujah if
[1:22:06] I Rise they'll rise with it oh lift up
[1:22:10] your heads oh your Gates and be you
[1:22:12] lifted up your Everlasting doors and the
[1:22:14] king of glory shall come in
[1:22:16] who is the king of glory the lord strong
[1:22:19] and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle
[1:22:21] lift up your heads all your gifts and
[1:22:24] lift him up Everlasting doors and the
[1:22:27] king of glory shall come in who is this
[1:22:29] king of glory the lord of hosts he is
[1:22:32] the king of glory Salah
[1:22:35] what was it it was a sign
[1:22:39] if I R Us if Jesus rose you can rise
[1:22:46] goodbye world
[1:22:48] I stand no longer with you
[1:22:51] what gives me satisfaction in my soul is
[1:22:54] knowing that there is no grave that can
[1:22:57] take me down there is no sin that can
[1:22:59] take me down because it's a sign when
[1:23:01] Jesus rose up what did Easter prove that
[1:23:04] it was both mechanics and Dynamics
[1:23:07] that's what Easter proved is that you
[1:23:09] are a son and daughter of almighty God
[1:23:11] what happened in this generation the son
[1:23:14] of man was waived over the people again
[1:23:17] that the word had come into full
[1:23:19] majority again
[1:23:21] this was a sign of the full majority of
[1:23:24] the one that had came to maturity first
[1:23:26] William Branham was not a wave Chief
[1:23:29] Christ is our wave seats but William
[1:23:31] Brandon was the first one to experience
[1:23:33] the power of our Lord Jesus Christ with
[1:23:37] all the restraints removed off of him
[1:23:40] just go ask catty Wright how powerful
[1:23:42] this wave Chief is
[1:23:44] come on somebody just go ask those
[1:23:46] German Witch Doctors when they tried to
[1:23:48] call up a storm and tried to stop the
[1:23:50] meetings when William Bynum stood up
[1:23:52] there and cursed those storms
[1:23:55] go ask Georgie Carter how powerful our
[1:23:57] Lord is
[1:23:59] come on somebody just go ask the blind
[1:24:01] girl down there in Memphis Tennessee
[1:24:03] with cataracts around her eyes see
[1:24:06] what's got a hold of God's
[1:24:07] representative
[1:24:09] she wasn't going to let him go and if
[1:24:11] you can capture what's happening the
[1:24:13] wave Chief is being waived over the
[1:24:15] people what happened up there on the day
[1:24:17] of Pentecost it was alrighty a mighty
[1:24:20] Russian wave and win that went across
[1:24:22] the people and 120 busted out shouting
[1:24:26] speaking in tongues
[1:24:29] laughs
[1:24:30] hello you ain't gotta worry about doing
[1:24:32] anything wrong when the wave sheets been
[1:24:34] waved over you
[1:24:37] foreign
[1:24:39] I'll do something wrong the Holy Ghost
[1:24:41] shall never make you do anything wrong
[1:24:43] I'm afraid if I get that kind of
[1:24:45] religion brother Andrew it'll make me
[1:24:47] shout the Lord don't make you do
[1:24:48] anything wrong I'm afraid if I get that
[1:24:50] kind of religion it'll make me dance
[1:24:52] it'll make me speak in tongues it'll
[1:24:54] make me cry boohoo mess up my makeup if
[1:24:57] that's your case you need to get it
[1:24:58] washed off anyway this religion won't do
[1:25:01] your own
[1:25:02] thank you
[1:25:13] I know what this circle is and I know
[1:25:15] what it does
[1:25:17] what is it
[1:25:19] it can cast out tumors
[1:25:22] it can raise little dead fishies
[1:25:25] it can speak it can speak over opossum
[1:25:29] foreign
[1:25:31] what happens when the wave of Faith
[1:25:33] begins to move in this place all of a
[1:25:35] sudden your faith begins to recognize
[1:25:37] that there's somebody bigger than the
[1:25:38] preacher in her room and you begin to
[1:25:40] feel the pulsation of the holy ghost
[1:25:41] moving across the congregation what are
[1:25:43] you witnessing you're witnessing a bank
[1:25:45] of Faith being built up you watch like a
[1:25:48] service like this it begins to it begins
[1:25:50] to transpire and it begins to move into
[1:25:52] an elevation and it starts out right
[1:25:54] here and then all of a sudden the Holy
[1:25:55] Ghost gets into it and takes it a higher
[1:25:57] octave what is it it's a bank of faith
[1:25:59] in the people that's realizing that they
[1:26:02] are the people of the open book what
[1:26:05] does it do it elevates your faith to
[1:26:07] believe that all things are possible
[1:26:12] I was down to Tennessee here a couple a
[1:26:15] couple months ago when I I had the
[1:26:17] privilege go in and pray for sister
[1:26:18] Erica Parker and as soon as we got in
[1:26:21] the house
[1:26:22] you could feel
[1:26:23] the bank of Faith immediately
[1:26:26] as you got in there
[1:26:30] we had a few of us with us that were
[1:26:31] standing there and all of them witnessed
[1:26:33] the same power in the room what is it it
[1:26:35] was amazing to watch I was mesmerized by
[1:26:38] here's a lady in her condition
[1:26:41] heat up with cancer so-called that the
[1:26:43] doctor says that she there's she is
[1:26:45] incurable but her faith was so strong
[1:26:49] when I thought I was going there to
[1:26:51] encourage her she encouraged me you
[1:26:54] could walk into it it was a wall of
[1:26:56] faith that we bounced into let me tell
[1:26:59] you when you can have that kind of faith
[1:27:01] in you on your dying bed and you eat up
[1:27:03] with cancer let me tell you ever
[1:27:05] Endeavor in hell would never stop the
[1:27:07] faith of a son and living God if in the
[1:27:09] Church of the Living God when that faith
[1:27:11] is there hell don't know what to do with
[1:27:13] somebody
[1:27:15] when the message has been waived over
[1:27:17] you
[1:27:19] it produces miracles
[1:27:21] Hallelujah that's why we've got full
[1:27:24] opportunity to preach that Jesus is
[1:27:26] still Jesus he still does Miracles he
[1:27:29] still gives a holy ghost he's still a
[1:27:31] Divine healer he's still a Waymaker he's
[1:27:34] still a promise keeper the message
[1:27:37] has been waived over the Church of the
[1:27:40] Living God what is it it's the revealing
[1:27:42] of the son of man
[1:27:44] [Applause]
[1:27:48] I'm not looking at little William
[1:27:50] branham's I'm looking at Messiahs that
[1:27:53] believe that they're Jesus Christ in
[1:27:55] human body form again
[1:27:58] let the lepers come let cancers come let
[1:28:02] demons come there is no power that can
[1:28:05] stand before our living God
[1:28:15] what is it the message of Malachi 4 has
[1:28:18] been waived over generation
[1:28:21] it's a sign you're going into rapture
[1:28:29] we had a forerunner told us that we were
[1:28:31] greater than a grave
[1:28:33] we had a forerunner that told us that we
[1:28:34] was greater than sin
[1:28:39] I'm not preaching above you today Emma
[1:28:44] you remember
[1:28:45] you remember out in him old western days
[1:28:49] it used to be an old scout to go out
[1:28:51] he'd go out before before the rest of
[1:28:54] the wagons and he'd go out there and
[1:28:55] he'd what was he doing he was looking
[1:28:57] for the trails to the easiest trails to
[1:28:59] go down what was he known and he was
[1:29:01] known as a forerunner that Scout was
[1:29:03] going out there and when the Wagon Train
[1:29:05] was perishing out there in the
[1:29:07] wilderness in the hot desert and they're
[1:29:08] going through the Prairies they were
[1:29:10] looking for water so they had a scout
[1:29:11] out there and that Scout would ride past
[1:29:14] the Indians he'd ride past all kinds of
[1:29:16] all kinds of things that that would
[1:29:18] maybe try to slow down the Wagon train
[1:29:20] but that Scout was a forerunner and he
[1:29:23] would come up across a mountain and the
[1:29:25] mountain would be up there and the
[1:29:27] mountain he'd get on top that mountain
[1:29:28] and he looked down there and he'd see
[1:29:30] that there was water over there even
[1:29:31] though that Wagon Train was back there
[1:29:33] and they were perishing and they were
[1:29:35] without hope but there was a scout that
[1:29:37] went out before him and said hey and he
[1:29:39] went back and he told the boss of the
[1:29:41] Wagon Train said look here there's water
[1:29:43] over there get your wagons together
[1:29:47] I'm here this morning to tell you to get
[1:29:49] your wagons together there's water out
[1:29:52] there there is a fountain open in the
[1:29:54] House of David
[1:29:57] ever Endeavor in hell is going to try to
[1:30:00] stop you from getting to the water but
[1:30:02] the angels in it
[1:30:05] thank you
[1:30:07] every Devil's trying to guard it but
[1:30:10] there is a fountain
[1:30:12] well I keep going back to The Well of
[1:30:14] Grace full of power and full of Truth
[1:30:17] what are we doing we're getting to the
[1:30:20] water
[1:30:23] Hallelujah your brother random said that
[1:30:25] that Old Devil he's sitting up there in
[1:30:27] a machine gun and trying to trying to
[1:30:29] stop the people from getting to the ward
[1:30:31] getting to the Forerunner
[1:30:34] but there was somebody that went before
[1:30:35] him they done ran up the hill and went
[1:30:38] to the Machine Gun Nest and there's a
[1:30:40] devil repairs got his gun trained on you
[1:30:42] but Jesus is already up there he's going
[1:30:44] to stop the machine gun tactics from
[1:30:46] destroying your life
[1:30:49] Hallelujah
[1:30:51] hallelujah what happened on the day of
[1:30:54] Pentecost it was waived over them
[1:30:59] I know you
[1:31:01] I know you might think this is hard to
[1:31:03] believe
[1:31:07] it's a pretty decent sized room here
[1:31:10] but when they got up there in that Upper
[1:31:12] Room
[1:31:14] they were up there thanking God and
[1:31:17] praising God before the blessing ever
[1:31:19] came
[1:31:20] they were up there waiting on it because
[1:31:23] Jesus said you're going to be a witness
[1:31:24] under my under me and unto myself and he
[1:31:28] told them to go up there to Judea and
[1:31:30] wait until you're endured with power and
[1:31:32] they were up there
[1:31:35] I don't know how exactly how big it is
[1:31:36] but they had 120 people in that little
[1:31:39] upper room they climbed up them stairs
[1:31:41] and they had a little candle sitting on
[1:31:43] the windowsill and they were up there
[1:31:44] praising God and blessing God and
[1:31:46] singing hymns and praising the Lord and
[1:31:49] when there when the whole is so when the
[1:31:51] Holy sound of the Holy Ghost began to
[1:31:53] roll through there brother Branham said
[1:31:55] there wasn't enough room in there for
[1:31:56] them so they jumped out in the windows
[1:31:58] come down the house they get a dance and
[1:32:00] shout all over the tongues in tongues
[1:32:02] and begin to dance and shout and people
[1:32:04] begin to hear them in their tongues what
[1:32:06] was it it was that the Holy Ghost had
[1:32:09] been waived over them they were up there
[1:32:10] waiting for it but I want to tell you
[1:32:12] Full Gospel Lighthouse you don't have to
[1:32:14] wait for the Holy Ghost don't wait for
[1:32:16] it they were waiting for the blessing
[1:32:18] but you don't have to wait for it when
[1:32:20] he released it on the day of Pentecost
[1:32:24] I hear people say well I gotta wait 10
[1:32:26] days for it you ain't got to wait 10
[1:32:28] days for it this is the refreshing of
[1:32:30] the Lord for Isaiah said in Isaiah 28 11
[1:32:33] that this is the refreshing of the Lord
[1:32:36] that with a stammering tongue well I
[1:32:38] speak unto my people this is the
[1:32:40] refreshing of it
[1:32:43] oh where are we living at where are we
[1:32:46] living at you don't have to wait for the
[1:32:48] Holy Ghost
[1:32:50] I've been talking to a brother that's
[1:32:52] been seeking a baptism my Holy Ghost I
[1:32:54] want to tell you you ain't got to wait
[1:32:55] for a One Day More you ain't got to ask
[1:32:57] for it you ain't got to beg for it you
[1:32:59] ain't got to plead for it God's more
[1:33:01] willing to give it to you than you're
[1:33:02] willing to receive it all I say is just
[1:33:05] get in the water
[1:33:07] I'll say Jesus has come here this
[1:33:09] morning looking for you
[1:33:12] what's happening this morning the
[1:33:14] message is waving over the people
[1:33:20] come on now
[1:33:22] come on get with me real quick
[1:33:25] they were all there
[1:33:28] double-minded had their own ideas
[1:33:31] they was going to go about their
[1:33:33] business and if they didn't get it today
[1:33:35] they was going to leave no they were
[1:33:36] there in one mind
[1:33:39] they were in the right atmosphere there
[1:33:41] was moisture there
[1:33:42] they knew how to praise God they've been
[1:33:45] with the seed word before they were not
[1:33:47] worshiping a dead God they were
[1:33:49] worshiping a God that they had already
[1:33:50] seen that could produce miracles
[1:33:54] don't you wait on it
[1:34:08] oh wait on it
[1:34:09] your blessings in the room your
[1:34:12] blessings in the room
[1:34:14] your Holy Ghost is in the room
[1:34:17] when he can take a little girl
[1:34:21] and change your life
[1:34:31] remember when William Branham was there
[1:34:32] just excuse me
[1:34:35] but we and Brandon Walks Into he walks
[1:34:37] into a
[1:34:39] a psychiatric ward
[1:34:41] and he's waiting on that
[1:34:44] he's trying to figure out where to start
[1:34:46] at and the room's full of all kinds of
[1:34:48] people that are mentally insane and
[1:34:50] lost their minds and remember he goes to
[1:34:53] a little girl
[1:34:55] he goes to a little girl and
[1:34:57] so where do I start at she said start
[1:34:59] with me
[1:35:02] start with me start right here with me
[1:35:04] he said well you're not a patient are
[1:35:05] you
[1:35:06] and that girl had been in church all her
[1:35:09] days but she got out with the wrong
[1:35:11] crowd hung out with the wrong boy took
[1:35:13] her down a dark Road and got doing this
[1:35:14] and went to this church meeting went to
[1:35:16] alcohol and all of this she lost her
[1:35:18] mind
[1:35:21] you know the story but William Brandon
[1:35:24] prays for her she prays she said I'm
[1:35:26] going to be different now I'm going to
[1:35:27] turn a new Leaf he said no you've done
[1:35:28] that before
[1:35:32] but this and you know the story but
[1:35:34] since you got back down again and she
[1:35:36] got
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:38] but this is what I want you to catch is
[1:35:41] the power of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:43] he said when God got done with her he
[1:35:46] took her back to the days of her
[1:35:48] innocency
[1:35:50] justifies you as if you've never done it
[1:35:52] in the first place the blood of Jesus
[1:35:55] Christ can take you back before you ever
[1:35:58] did wrong before you ever told your
[1:36:00] first lie
[1:36:05] I know I know that every devil in hell
[1:36:07] is trying to stop this but there's going
[1:36:09] to be an outboarding of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:11] there's going to be an auction when
[1:36:13] somebody receives what God is wanting to
[1:36:16] give out what he was was the first one
[1:36:18] to come to maturity but it's a sign
[1:36:23] it's a sign you can have the Holy Ghost
[1:36:25] it's a sign you can have your healing
[1:36:27] it's a sign you can be delivered it's a
[1:36:30] sign this morning
[1:36:31] don't stay there no longer rise up out
[1:36:34] of your sin rise up the way she's been
[1:36:37] waived over you the Dynamics are here
[1:36:39] you can put two cars on the same
[1:36:41] assembly line but one of them's got the
[1:36:43] same power as the other ones die but it
[1:36:46] ain't got no spark it'll never get off
[1:36:48] the track but if you ever get the Holy
[1:36:50] Ghost if you ever get a party if you
[1:36:53] ever get a spark of the Holy Ghost upon
[1:36:55] that engine it'll run down the road at
[1:36:57] the octane power that it's built for
[1:37:01] this ain't Homer Fraser's church this
[1:37:04] ain't Ron Spencer's church this is Holy
[1:37:06] Ghost Church
[1:37:09] this ain't our idea this ain't our fault
[1:37:12] this ain't Luther's day this ain't
[1:37:14] Wesley's day this ain't the restoration
[1:37:16] of the gifts this is the bright age
[1:37:19] where the son of man's been waved over
[1:37:21] that the message has come to full
[1:37:23] maturity
[1:37:25] it's message time it's bright time it's
[1:37:29] Holy Ghost Town it's receiving time
[1:37:33] I tell you what it is it's changing time
[1:37:35] the time is at hand it's time to leave
[1:37:38] this whole world
[1:37:39] it's time there's been churches churches
[1:37:42] Brides brides where there's got to come
[1:37:44] one that's both mechanics and Dynamics
[1:37:47] and she's here this is your hour this is
[1:37:50] your time this is your moment
[1:37:54] oh Ezekiel can these bones live again oh
[1:37:57] thou knowest

[2:01:25] my brother to a brother sister to a

[2:01:41] needs
[2:01:46] they mean business with God
[2:01:53] oh God

[2:02:09] Lord we're asking Lord that you do the
[2:02:11] supernatural right here
[2:02:13] Lord we recognize
[2:02:16] what made the difference upon the Water
[2:02:19] is that it was moving differently than
[2:02:22] it ever should
[2:02:24] father you have the power of taking
[2:02:26] people and moving them in ways that they
[2:02:29] never should making them operate in
[2:02:31] faith like they never thought that they
[2:02:34] could
[2:02:35] I pray that the supernatural
[2:02:39] would be expressed through my brothers
[2:02:41] and sisters right here
[2:02:44] Lord you said if we'd lay our hands upon
[2:02:47] the sick they shall recover it's a
[2:02:51] covenant unto us Lord
[2:02:53] that if we believe
[2:02:56] that not even cancer could stand before
[2:02:59] our prayer father hence in the name of
[2:03:03] Jesus Christ that we stand here under
[2:03:05] our commission and we believe father
[2:03:08] that you are the god of Abraham Isaac
[2:03:11] Jacob through all the prophets you're
[2:03:14] our God and Lord as we lay our hands
[2:03:17] upon this certain need and upon that
[2:03:18] need let the Holy Ghost pass through
[2:03:22] this room just now
[2:03:25] Lord if you could pass through her an
[2:03:28] unrouty crowd into a crowd that was cold
[2:03:31] up there in in Waterloo Iowa people that
[2:03:34] were rejecting you and people that
[2:03:36] wouldn't move up under under the
[2:03:38] inspiration of the Holy Ghost says sit
[2:03:40] there in their sin they set their cold
[2:03:41] and William Branham tried with
[2:03:43] everything that he could to get them
[2:03:45] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:47] and William Branham said God and loosen
[2:03:50] up this crowd
[2:03:51] then all of a sudden there came a rush
