[57:36] would appreciate it
[57:38] before we read this evening
[57:41] brother branham would say in the
[57:42] ephesian church age
[57:44] he said the he that hath an ear let him
[57:46] hear what the spirit saith under the
[57:48] churches
[57:49] said how tragic it is that the first age
[57:51] did not listen to the spirit
[57:53] instead it listened to man
[57:55] but thank god in the last age there will
[57:58] be a group rise up the true bride of the
[58:00] last day
[58:02] and she will listen to the spirit
[58:04] in that day of gross
[58:06] darkness
[58:08] we are here
[58:10] in the day of gross darkness the light
[58:13] will return by the pure word
[58:16] and we will return
[58:19] and we will return to the power of
[58:22] pentecost to welcome back
[58:25] the lord jesus christ
[58:27] matthew chapter 21
[58:29] and verse 1
[58:33] and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem
[58:36] and were come to bethpage under the
[58:38] mount of olives then sent jesus to
[58:40] disciples saying unto them
[58:42] go into the village over against you
[58:45] and straightway you shall find an ass
[58:47] tied and a coat with her loose them and
[58:50] bring them unto me
[58:52] and if any man say odd unto you you
[58:54] shall say the lord
[58:56] hath need of them and straightway he
[58:58] will send them
[59:00] all this was done that it might be
[59:02] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[59:04] prophet saying
[59:05] tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy
[59:08] king cometh unto thee meek and sitting
[59:10] upon an ass and a quote the fall of an
[59:13] ass if you want to find that scripture
[59:15] you can go back in the book of zechariah
[59:17] chapter 9 to verse 9 and see that this
[59:19] is the prophecy
[59:21] now made manifest
[59:23] and the disciples went and did as jesus
[59:26] commanded them
[59:28] and brought the ass and the colt and put
[59:30] on them their clothes and they set him
[59:32] thereon
[59:33] and a very great multitude spread their
[59:35] garments in the way others cut down
[59:37] branches from the trees and straw them
[59:39] in the way
[59:40] and the multitudes that went before and
[59:43] that followed cried saying hosanna to
[59:46] the son of david blessed is he that
[59:48] cometh in the name of the lord hosanna
[59:51] in the highest
[59:52] and when he was come into jerusalem all
[59:55] the city was moved saying
[59:57] who
[59:59] is this
[1:00:01] you imagine the talk that day who is
[1:00:04] this
[1:00:05] who is this
[1:00:06] john chapter 4
[1:00:08] and verse 23 and 24.
[1:00:19] say amen when you have it this evening
[1:00:23] i'll wait on you this evening
[1:00:29] but the hour cometh
[1:00:32] and now is
[1:00:35] and now is
[1:00:37] when the true worshipers shall worship
[1:00:39] the father in spirit
[1:00:41] and in truth
[1:00:43] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:00:45] him
[1:00:46] god is a spirit
[1:00:48] and they that worship him must worship
[1:00:50] him
[1:00:51] in spirit
[1:00:53] and
[1:00:54] in truth may god bless his word you may
[1:00:56] be seated in the presence of the lord
[1:00:59] i'd like to speak to you this evening on
[1:01:01] blessed is he
[1:01:03] that believes
[1:01:05] this is him
[1:01:06] blessed is he that
[1:01:08] believes this
[1:01:11] is him
[1:01:12] truly we realize that this evening that
[1:01:14] we are living in the the last days we
[1:01:17] truly we truly are aware that we are
[1:01:19] standing in one of the greatest days but
[1:01:22] yet it's one of the darkest days it's
[1:01:23] one of the most chaotic days that man
[1:01:26] has ever had to live in there's so much
[1:01:28] turmoil on the street there's so much
[1:01:30] turmoil in the mind there's never been a
[1:01:32] day like this day when men are more
[1:01:35] insane than they have ever been in all
[1:01:37] the days of their life and truly we are
[1:01:39] seeing that which was laying there in
[1:01:41] malachi 4 actually become manifest
[1:01:44] before our eyes that that before the
[1:01:46] coming of the lord in that great and
[1:01:48] dreadful day and truly we are living in
[1:01:51] what we would say a dreadful day for the
[1:01:53] politicians we are living in a very
[1:01:54] dreadful day for health workers and and
[1:01:57] all types of men but it's a very great
[1:01:59] day for you and i to be realizing that
[1:02:02] we are living in the hour that this is
[1:02:04] when the son of man is dispersing
[1:02:06] himself and releasing the very mind of
[1:02:09] god to his children in this hour and to
[1:02:12] say that the son of man is still amongst
[1:02:14] us i could say that we have been blessed
[1:02:17] is that right we have been blessed now
[1:02:20] now this is not the hour of the
[1:02:22] unbeliever it's not the hour of the
[1:02:24] skeptic though we have those there are
[1:02:27] this is not the hour of critics this is
[1:02:29] not the hour yeah we have we have we
[1:02:31] have men that criticize or skeptic or or
[1:02:35] disbelieve but this is not the hour of
[1:02:37] the unbeliever but this is the hour of
[1:02:40] the believer and you and i are living in
[1:02:42] the greatest day that's ever been upon
[1:02:45] the face of the earth brother branham
[1:02:46] would say that if i could have chose any
[1:02:47] day to come and live in i would have
[1:02:50] chose this day because it is the
[1:02:52] greatest day it's the coming of the lord
[1:02:55] it is the hour of the believer so i
[1:02:57] could say it to you like this that this
[1:03:00] is the hour of the blessed that do
[1:03:02] believe and here we are watching it
[1:03:05] seeing the very manifested signs of god
[1:03:08] that that this is the same messiah sign
[1:03:11] that came 2000 years ago that is working
[1:03:14] right in the midst of the church of the
[1:03:17] living god and here we are when when all
[1:03:19] the loose sins that had been loosed
[1:03:21] throughout the generations down through
[1:03:23] the dark ages and down through the man
[1:03:25] age here we are where we're watching the
[1:03:27] ministry of malachi 4 come and tie up
[1:03:30] those loose sins and that which was been
[1:03:33] prophecy is now made a reality and here
[1:03:36] we are feasting on the very son of man
[1:03:39] that's not the mind of man it wasn't
[1:03:41] william branham it wasn't the seventh
[1:03:43] angel it was the angel of the lord we're
[1:03:46] living in the greatest day in the
[1:03:48] greatest hour where we're watching we've
[1:03:51] never seen a worship like this before
[1:03:53] we've never seen a praise like this
[1:03:55] before we've never seen preaching of the
[1:03:57] world like this before sure we've had
[1:03:59] great preaching all the way throughout
[1:04:00] our history as message believers but
[1:04:03] you've never seen an outpouring of the
[1:04:05] holy ghost like you're watching in this
[1:04:07] hour what you seen last week ken was
[1:04:10] just a foretaste of that which is to
[1:04:12] come and if just like david would say if
[1:04:15] you don't like that watch this there is
[1:04:18] more to come and i'll say this that god
[1:04:20] is only going to get greater god is only
[1:04:23] going to get he is only going to get
[1:04:25] greater in our midst he's only going to
[1:04:27] prove himself stronger in our midst god
[1:04:29] is not changing but he is dispersing
[1:04:32] himself and displaying himself like
[1:04:35] never before in the midst of the church
[1:04:38] of the living god now i'm preaching to
[1:04:41] you this thought on blessed is he that
[1:04:43] believes that this is him over an event
[1:04:47] that happened and there's there's not
[1:04:49] but a handful of people that that even
[1:04:51] know about this i haven't shared this
[1:04:53] myself maybe brother timothy may have
[1:04:55] shared some of these things but while we
[1:04:57] were there in ohio i haven't even i
[1:04:59] didn't even mention it to many of the
[1:05:01] people there in ohio just kind of kept
[1:05:03] it to ourselves and they might be
[1:05:05] listening and hearing those things but
[1:05:08] but brother timothy had came in and i
[1:05:10] i'd hauled my i'd hauled my camper up
[1:05:12] there to the the meeting the youth
[1:05:14] meeting up there in ohio and brother
[1:05:16] timothy had came over to my to my camper
[1:05:19] and was sitting there and we were just
[1:05:20] having some coffee and fellowship and
[1:05:22] and the girls had had went over to
[1:05:24] brother aidan horst place there and
[1:05:27] seen his greenhouse and his farm and
[1:05:29] different things and they just had a
[1:05:31] they just had a lovely time there i
[1:05:32] won't tell everything but they just had
[1:05:34] an absolute lovely time but me and
[1:05:37] brother timothy were sitting there in my
[1:05:39] camper and we were just fellowshipping
[1:05:41] and we were talking about the
[1:05:42] supernatural and talking about things
[1:05:44] that had happened and we got to talking
[1:05:46] about when the event that we've spoke
[1:05:48] about much which is very very special to
[1:05:51] you and i as here at full gospel
[1:05:53] lighthouse about the event of the ipad
[1:05:55] that took place and we brother ron
[1:05:57] referred to that even last weekend but
[1:05:59] we were just fellowshipping on that upon
[1:06:01] that event that took place how
[1:06:03] supernatural and we were just saying to
[1:06:06] to us that was one of the greatest or
[1:06:08] the most supernatural things that we
[1:06:10] have seen in in quite some time we were
[1:06:12] just we were just fellowshipping on this
[1:06:14] thought and just talking about those
[1:06:16] things and i had been listening i've
[1:06:18] been listening to the attraction on the
[1:06:20] mountain early that morning about 6 6 30
[1:06:22] in the morning and i was listening to
[1:06:24] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:06:25] and and we've all very aware of that of
[1:06:28] that message that that's where brother
[1:06:30] tom brady was called out where he had
[1:06:32] that that little letter down there in
[1:06:34] his pocket about his wife and i was i
[1:06:36] was listening to those things and while
[1:06:38] me and brother timothy this is about
[1:06:39] some around 11 11 30 and i i'd cut that
[1:06:42] thing off and that that camper that i
[1:06:45] have has a bluetooth system that runs
[1:06:47] throughout the whole thing
[1:06:48] and all of a sudden that thing while
[1:06:50] we're fellowshipping on this thought
[1:06:52] that bluetooth cuts on and it has a
[1:06:55] message on it it says what moves you
[1:06:58] and there brother branham starts
[1:07:00] speaking and he looks at me he said is
[1:07:02] this happening again
[1:07:06] is this happening again and brother
[1:07:07] branham is reading over in matthew
[1:07:09] chapter 21 blessed is he that cometh in
[1:07:13] the name of the lord
[1:07:15] now now i'm not making anything out of
[1:07:18] that but i'm just saying what the facts
[1:07:19] are i believe that this is him
[1:07:22] i believe with all of my heart that
[1:07:24] we're not living in a day gone by but
[1:07:26] this is the hour where we are watching
[1:07:28] the same one that came in the ministry
[1:07:31] of malachi 4 is here working through a
[1:07:34] many member bride and she is living out
[1:07:36] the prophet's prophecy i happen to
[1:07:39] believe that you are them i happen to
[1:07:42] believe that this is the people that are
[1:07:44] blessed beyond mesh if you are sitting
[1:07:47] here under this message you can say that
[1:07:50] i am blessed the denominations ain't got
[1:07:52] a clue what you're shouting about the
[1:07:55] church world don't got a clue what
[1:07:56] you're shouting about but blessed is he
[1:07:59] that believes that this is him that has
[1:08:02] come in the name of the lord
[1:08:06] oh i could say this to you with a
[1:08:08] shortly that this event has changed our
[1:08:12] life
[1:08:15] but jesus would grab in his very first
[1:08:17] sermon that he would take over on the
[1:08:19] sermon on the mountain and he would say
[1:08:21] in matthew chapter five and three
[1:08:22] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:08:25] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:08:30] blessed are they that mourn for they
[1:08:32] shall be comforted blessed are the meek

[1:09:00] children of god blessed are they which
[1:09:02] are persecuted for righteousness sake

[1:09:40] look at your neighbor say i'm blessed
[1:09:42] brother brandon would say in the message
[1:09:44] of redemption by power he said you're
[1:09:46] always pointing at how wicked the world
[1:09:49] is getting he said but you fail to see
[1:09:51] how powerful that the church is getting
[1:09:54] all along he said she's standing alone
[1:09:56] she's standing on her feet you see she
[1:09:59] might be a small little flock but god is
[1:10:01] with her and if one thing that we can
[1:10:04] say with us shortly this evening we have
[1:10:06] seen the same angel operating in our
[1:10:09] midst and what an opportunity as the
[1:10:12] church of the living god to rise to our
[1:10:14] feet and to say and prove by the baptism
[1:10:17] of the holy ghost that this is him and
[1:10:20] you are the ones that will shake this
[1:10:23] world and turn her upside down what an
[1:10:26] opportunity as the
[1:10:28] body of jesus christ to be operating in
[1:10:32] a realm that only you can operate in
[1:10:34] brother but i'm going to say that the
[1:10:36] opportunity that you have been given
[1:10:38] paul would have loved to see enoch would
[1:10:40] have loved to see elijah would have
[1:10:43] loved to see all the prophets would have
[1:10:45] loved to sing but you're not running
[1:10:47] without a message tonight you're running
[1:10:49] with a king's message you've got
[1:10:51] something to say you've got something to
[1:10:54] shout about this is the lord's story
[1:10:57] this is the king that is in our midst
[1:11:02] hallelujah
[1:11:03] elijah would i love these opportunities
[1:11:06] but this is the hour of the manifested
[1:11:09] sons of god
[1:11:11] when everything that adam lost and eve
[1:11:13] lost throughout the fall but manifested
[1:11:16] sun to her eyes and began to possess
[1:11:19] that which they lost
[1:11:22] adam lost his peace
[1:11:24] adam lost humanity's peace but
[1:11:26] manifested sons walk in there and take
[1:11:29] back everything that was stole from them
[1:11:31] i'm not just talking about your family
[1:11:33] history right here i'm not just talking
[1:11:36] about your dna that there's something
[1:11:38] laying there but i'm talking about as
[1:11:40] sons of god you go in there and you get
[1:11:43] it for your brother you get it for your
[1:11:45] sister you get it for your church family
[1:11:48] you're a son of the most high god and
[1:11:51] satan cannot do nothing with you
[1:11:58] or if the same spirit that raised up
[1:12:01] christ from the dead dwell in you it
[1:12:04] will quicken your mortal bodies
[1:12:07] so i want to say this to you you did not
[1:12:10] become seed by the rebirth you were see
[1:12:13] therefore you could be reborn the reason
[1:12:16] why you're led by the spirit is because
[1:12:18] you always was a son you may not look
[1:12:21] like a shark you may have not acted like
[1:12:24] a son you may have not even shouted or
[1:12:26] danced like a heart but always you were
[1:12:29] a son of god
[1:12:32] that's why satan's been on your case all
[1:12:35] of your life it's because there's
[1:12:37] something laying on the inside of you
[1:12:39] that sacred can't do nothing with he's
[1:12:42] always lusted after power but it is
[1:12:45] christ hidden behind the veil of
[1:12:48] humanity divinity
[1:12:50] has come down and transformed himself
[1:12:53] once again
[1:12:57] oh blessed is he that believes
[1:13:00] this is him
[1:13:03] [Applause]
[1:13:11] paul would say in romans 8
[1:13:14] and 19 that the earnest
[1:13:17] expectation of the creature waiteth
[1:13:21] waiteth
[1:13:23] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:13:26] for the creature was made subject to
[1:13:28] vanity
[1:13:30] not
[1:13:30] willingly
[1:13:32] but by reason of him who hath subjected
[1:13:36] the same in hope
[1:13:38] because the creature itself also shall
[1:13:40] be delivered
[1:13:41] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:13:43] glorious liberty
[1:13:45] of the children
[1:13:47] of god
[1:13:51] you think about this
[1:13:54] this what you're experiencing
[1:13:57] i i know
[1:13:58] i know
[1:13:59] that we have rejoiced we have there has
[1:14:02] we have went back and watched last week
[1:14:04] in service
[1:14:06] did you go back and watch it
[1:14:09] that's a liberty of the children of god
[1:14:13] and the bible said that where
[1:14:15] the spirit of the lord is
[1:14:18] there's a liberty
[1:14:20] now now now we don't just use that for a
[1:14:22] dancing quote
[1:14:24] we don't just use that for you to feel
[1:14:26] like you have a right to shout but there
[1:14:29] is a real liberty
[1:14:31] in the spirit of god
[1:14:34] now now to know that you have been in
[1:14:36] prison
[1:14:37] and to know that you have been set free
[1:14:39] of not just yourself but everything that
[1:14:42] was stacked up against you everything
[1:14:44] that was laying there and your mother
[1:14:46] and your father and your grandfather
[1:14:48] being a bootlegger and a moonshiner
[1:14:50] everything that was laying there
[1:14:52] you are now free
[1:14:54] and whom the son has set free
[1:14:58] whom the son is set free is free indeed
[1:15:02] i want to say this to you you have the
[1:15:04] liberty as the children of god to walk
[1:15:07] out of every gate and slam it back in
[1:15:10] the devil's face because you never were
[1:15:13] [Applause]
[1:15:15] you never were his prisoner you may have
[1:15:18] looked like a prisoner you may have had
[1:15:20] chains on like a prisoner
[1:15:22] but you were never his prisoner god has
[1:15:25] had you in his hands the whole time you
[1:15:28] may have took you a long time to come to
[1:15:30] this glorious liberty that only belongs
[1:15:33] to the children of god
[1:15:37] i'm not a slave
[1:15:39] i'm not a master to sin i am not under
[1:15:42] that test master i have heard the
[1:15:44] jubilee that i never did belong down
[1:15:47] there with that hoe i never did belong
[1:15:49] working down there in that field i have
[1:15:52] a right to go back
[1:15:56] i heard a sound
[1:15:59] of a russian mighty wind
[1:16:05] verse 22 for we know
[1:16:07] that the whole creation groaneth and
[1:16:10] travaileth in pain
[1:16:12] together until now
[1:16:14] we've all understood and heard this
[1:16:16] scripture for years that we know that
[1:16:18] all of creation grown
[1:16:20] and travaileth in pain until now that we
[1:16:23] had realized that the whole
[1:16:24] manifestation that the whole world is
[1:16:27] groaning but let me bring it down just a
[1:16:29] little bit closer for you i want to say
[1:16:31] this to you that your world your world
[1:16:34] is waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:16:37] power that's in you
[1:16:39] your job is waiting on you your children
[1:16:42] is waiting on you your family is waiting
[1:16:45] on you because the bible said that we
[1:16:47] have this treasure
[1:16:50] i have this treasure in earth and
[1:16:53] vessels that it is the excellency of the
[1:16:56] power of god maybe of god and not of
[1:16:59] ourselves
[1:17:00] this treasure that we have in this earth
[1:17:03] and vessel is of him
[1:17:05] so what you are seeing is a real sun
[1:17:08] worship
[1:17:10] you're watching real worship you're
[1:17:12] watching not a man worship but you are
[1:17:14] watching a real
[1:17:16] holy ghost worship this is not something
[1:17:19] that we proud you to do
[1:17:23] as brother howard and brother josh been
[1:17:24] back here with a pride and stick prayer
[1:17:26] telling you that you need to stand up in
[1:17:28] the preaching of the word

[1:17:40] the leadership of full gospel lighthouse
[1:17:42] pushed you
[1:17:44] into worshiping the way you're
[1:17:46] worshiping then what can it be none
[1:17:48] other than the word bringing you to your
[1:17:51] attention as a son this is not a fake
[1:17:54] worship this is not a put on but this is
[1:17:58] a hard worship and hard worship will
[1:18:01] push you past what you see
[1:18:03] heart worship will make you look past
[1:18:05] what you sense real worship will take
[1:18:08] you to a god level
[1:18:12] for jesus would even say that he that
[1:18:15] hungereth or he that thirst let him come
[1:18:17] unto me and drink
[1:18:19] for he
[1:18:21] that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:18:24] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:18:27] rivers of living water

[1:19:49] are never his you and he's trying to
[1:19:51] tell you that you're not strong enough
[1:19:53] not worthy enough not good enough you
[1:19:55] see the reason why he's fighting against
[1:19:57] you is the power that lays in you he
[1:20:00] can't contain it
[1:20:05] all the hell's cages all the hell's
[1:20:08] traps can't contain you
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:11] [Applause]
[1:20:13] every every idea that he's got every
[1:20:16] scheme that is god every tactic that is
[1:20:18] god can't hold the power that's in you
[1:20:21] you say well i don't feel like very much
[1:20:23] let me say if you get a hold of satan
[1:20:26] satan has messed up

[1:20:32] goliath had his last day your depression
[1:20:35] will have its last day your anxiety will
[1:20:38] have the last day god is looking for
[1:20:40] david to get a hold of him take a stone
[1:20:42] of the revelation and he has said i have
[1:20:45] begun to give you the land you go in
[1:20:48] there and you possess the land i have
[1:20:50] begun to give you this message you go in
[1:20:52] there and take that message i have went
[1:20:54] in there and gave you the holy ghost you
[1:20:56] go in there and get the holy ghost i
[1:20:58] didn't give you your healing go in there
[1:21:00] and get it go in there possess it it's
[1:21:03] in you
[1:21:04] out of your belly shall flow
[1:21:07] rivers of living water
[1:21:12] [Applause]
[1:21:16] oh just smile at the devil you got him
[1:21:19] in a corner
[1:21:21] it's our job
[1:21:23] to offer up
[1:21:24] a sacrifice of praise
[1:21:27] you are royal priesthood the bible said
[1:21:30] that he hath made you kings
[1:21:34] and priests
[1:21:35] and as a royal priest we are to offer up
[1:21:39] a sacrifice of praise and when you go
[1:21:43] back and you begin to study over in the
[1:21:45] book of exodus and the book of leviticus
[1:21:47] you'll find back there that moses is
[1:21:49] setting up the priesthood over in the
[1:21:52] book of leviticus and he's setting up
[1:21:54] the anointing you know that we've been
[1:21:55] through it as he has to walk right and
[1:21:57] everything's got to be in its order but
[1:21:59] when when before the priesthood can go
[1:22:02] out and offer the blood upon the altar
[1:22:06] for the peace offering he has got to be
[1:22:08] dressed right everything's got to be in
[1:22:10] order but the priest's blood that that
[1:22:13] moses would go and he would take the
[1:22:16] blood and he would place it upon the
[1:22:19] high priest he would go and he would
[1:22:21] place it on the high priest of all of
[1:22:23] his right extremities he would place it
[1:22:25] on his ear he would place it on his hand
[1:22:28] and he would place it on his foot it was
[1:22:30] all a sign that the priest was ready and
[1:22:34] in a spot to go before jehovah in a sign
[1:22:39] of peace
[1:22:40] that he would walk out there so let me
[1:22:42] say this to you when the priest would
[1:22:45] hear he would hear for the blood when he
[1:22:47] would work with his hands in the duties
[1:22:49] of the priesthood he would work through
[1:22:51] the blood and every time that he would
[1:22:54] take a footstep he would walk through
[1:22:56] the blood the reason why you hear this
[1:22:58] message in its purity and in its
[1:23:01] trueness is because you've got the blood
[1:23:04] [Applause]
[1:23:05] the blood every time you make a footstep
[1:23:08] and the reason why it's not just you and
[1:23:11] it's something else you're walking with
[1:23:13] the blood
[1:23:16] oh it's the dripping blood brother man
[1:23:19] would look up there and he said what is
[1:23:21] that sound what is that thump thump
[1:23:23] thump doing up that road he said i look
[1:23:26] up there and i see those blood drops
[1:23:28] coming down calvary's hill it's a trail
[1:23:31] to the
[1:23:32] cross oh
[1:23:35] glory be to god
[1:23:38] so when you hear the preaching of the
[1:23:40] word you're hearing through the blood
[1:23:44] the reason why there's people that
[1:23:46] cannot worship and cannot worship under
[1:23:48] the message of malachi 4 is they are
[1:23:51] under a bloodless religion
[1:23:55] [Applause]
[1:23:58] they're trying to handle they're trying
[1:24:01] to handle the bible and they're trying
[1:24:03] to handle this message without the blood
[1:24:05] on them
[1:24:07] they have tried to make mercy over and
[1:24:10] say there is no mercy but as long as he
[1:24:13] is still on the throne there is still
[1:24:16] mercy where mercy is given
[1:24:23] you remember
[1:24:24] back here in that war
[1:24:26] when that pigeon was sent out with a
[1:24:27] message
[1:24:29] you remember
[1:24:30] that they they would attach the message
[1:24:32] to that pigeon to that dove and it would
[1:24:35] fly out and that dove would fly out with
[1:24:37] the message that was attached to his
[1:24:39] foot and when the enemy would see that
[1:24:41] pigeon or that dove flying over they
[1:24:43] would try to shoot it because their
[1:24:45] allies or their or the or their enemy
[1:24:48] that they were facing was asking for
[1:24:50] reinforcements they were trying to give
[1:24:52] out the battle cry of how things were
[1:24:54] going down there and so they tried to
[1:24:56] shoot that pigeon they tried everything
[1:24:59] they clipped his wing and they and they
[1:25:01] hit his foot and when the message got
[1:25:06] when the message got to its destination
[1:25:09] the message had the blood on it let me
[1:25:12] say this to you the dove of the holy
[1:25:15] spirit has been flying through this
[1:25:17] place trying to get to you he's trying
[1:25:20] to tell you that the message has got the
[1:25:22] blood on it all you got to do is receive
[1:25:25] it
[1:25:30] so let me say this to you you that are
[1:25:32] in trouble reinforcements are on their
[1:25:34] way
[1:25:40] your king is coming
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:43] so paul would say
[1:25:46] so faith cometh by hearing
[1:25:49] and hearing by the word of god
[1:25:52] the reason why you hear it like you hear
[1:25:54] it
[1:25:55] there's a blood been placed on you
[1:25:58] the token life of the lord jesus christ
[1:26:00] has been placed upon you and brother
[1:26:03] branham would say that perfect faith has
[1:26:04] manifested and identified itself in you
[1:26:08] as a substance and when it's there then
[1:26:10] nothing is going to shake you from it
[1:26:13] nothing can shake you from it when it's
[1:26:15] laying there you might go through some
[1:26:17] time and you might go through some
[1:26:18] crisis but nothing can shake you from it
[1:26:21] because
[1:26:22] it is a perfect faith that has been
[1:26:26] manifested to the body
[1:26:28] it's identified itself and is laying
[1:26:30] there in you
[1:26:32] and you remember when jesus when jesus
[1:26:34] was up there and brother branham would
[1:26:36] grab from i believe matthew chapter 11
[1:26:39] and he would go up there and he would
[1:26:41] preach on the forgotten beatitude
[1:26:44] and he goes over there and you'll hear
[1:26:45] brother branham talk about john's ego
[1:26:47] eye getting filmed over and he there he
[1:26:50] had a few days before that he had
[1:26:52] witnessed that this was the lamb of god
[1:26:55] but when john got up there in prison and
[1:26:58] he was up there
[1:26:59] he began to speak to his disciples
[1:27:02] through the prison walls he be sent to
[1:27:04] hear about the works of christ and jesus
[1:27:08] or john told them go
[1:27:10] and talk to him and say art thou he that
[1:27:13] cometh or do we look for another that's
[1:27:16] why brother branham would say that his
[1:27:18] eagle eye got filmed over
[1:27:22] but watch
[1:27:23] as the eagle eye begins to open back up
[1:27:26] what did jesus come what did he do when
[1:27:29] they came there those disciples had been
[1:27:31] taught what the messiah would do they'd
[1:27:33] been taught what the messiah would look
[1:27:35] like they've been taught how he would
[1:27:37] handle himself
[1:27:38] but notice what jesus did he didn't go
[1:27:41] there brother random said he didn't go
[1:27:43] there and he didn't offer unto john said
[1:27:45] go back here and offer him this book on
[1:27:48] happiness how to be happy down in jail
[1:27:51] he didn't offer him a book on patience
[1:27:53] on how to be patient down in jail he
[1:27:55] said but go back and you show john and
[1:27:58] tell john all of these things that
[1:28:01] you're seeing the blind have seen the
[1:28:03] death hath heard the dead are raised
[1:28:05] back to life the lepers are walked the
[1:28:08] lepers are cleansed
[1:28:10] watch it's a healing service that's
[1:28:12] going on and brother branham said that
[1:28:15] those disciples stayed up there with
[1:28:17] jesus all evening long
[1:28:21] you've been up there all evening long
[1:28:25] and you've been watching the same signs
[1:28:28] go tell john
[1:28:30] what did he do
[1:28:31] what did he do he told him you go back
[1:28:33] and you tell john
[1:28:34] that i'm right on schedule
[1:28:38] you go back and you tell john
[1:28:40] everything's right on schedule don't you
[1:28:41] be scared i'm right in line you're right
[1:28:44] in line don't you be afraid don't pay
[1:28:46] attention to nothing else i'm right on
[1:28:48] schedule and then jesus comes down and
[1:28:51] he says this forgotten beatitude
[1:28:55] he said blessed is he that is not
[1:28:58] offended in me
[1:29:01] brother branham would say in the
[1:29:02] forgotten beatitude he said in otherwise
[1:29:04] he said blessed is he that believeth in
[1:29:08] me
[1:29:09] and today we are living in an hour when
[1:29:12] men are more offended at jesus than any
[1:29:15] other name they don't want him in the
[1:29:17] schools they don't want him in our
[1:29:18] governments or in the governments they
[1:29:20] don't want him in the halls of congress
[1:29:22] they don't want him there we're living
[1:29:24] in a society when men are ashamed of
[1:29:27] jesus they're ashamed of his works
[1:29:29] they're ashamed to call on his name
[1:29:31] they're ashamed of his power they're
[1:29:33] ashamed to stand for this truth they're
[1:29:35] ashamed to say that they're identified
[1:29:37] with a message of malachi 4.
[1:29:40] i am not ashamed to stand with this
[1:29:42] message but this is not the hour of the
[1:29:45] ashamed but this is the hour of the
[1:29:48] unashamed
[1:29:51] because in the bible it said in the book
[1:29:53] of joel that that i will restore unto
[1:29:55] you all the years that the locusts and
[1:29:57] the calm the the palmer worm and the
[1:29:59] caterpillar and other than the cake worm
[1:30:01] i will restore to you all of those years
[1:30:04] and you shall eat in plenty and my
[1:30:07] people shall never be ashamed and paul
[1:30:11] would say in romans 1 and 16 that i am
[1:30:14] not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:30:16] christ for it is the power of salvation
[1:30:20] to him that believeth
[1:30:24] you are blessed
[1:30:26] to be able to believe
[1:30:30] this is him
[1:30:32] this is him go show john
[1:30:34] go tell john
[1:30:37] what's been your job
[1:30:39] eat this book
[1:30:41] feed on this book
[1:30:42] prophesy again
[1:30:44] go show john
[1:30:48] go show john he says
[1:30:54] in 1800s
[1:30:56] under the man age there was a
[1:30:58] there was a man by the name of george
[1:31:00] muller
[1:31:03] george muller
[1:31:04] you hear me okay
[1:31:06] george miller it was a great evangelist
[1:31:08] from in the realms of germany and over
[1:31:11] in bristol england and it was over there
[1:31:14] he was a great evangelist under the
[1:31:15] anointing of the man aged 1800s and ran
[1:31:18] a great and great successful successful
[1:31:20] orphanage and many times when when
[1:31:22] george muller you can go back and read
[1:31:24] the history on the church you can go
[1:31:25] back there and you'll find george muller
[1:31:27] in there and george miller was a man of
[1:31:29] great faith he there was many times when
[1:31:31] he was running that orphanage that they
[1:31:33] had zero amount of food and throughout
[1:31:35] the whole orphanage and how many how
[1:31:38] many kids would be in that orphanage he
[1:31:40] would tell he would tell the maids and
[1:31:41] tell the helpers there said go ahead and
[1:31:43] set the plates and everybody sit down go
[1:31:46] ahead and sit down
[1:31:47] and i believe that god will provide some
[1:31:50] food for all of these children well the
[1:31:52] time they come and sit down about the
[1:31:54] time to eat there somebody come knocking
[1:31:57] on the door they just had a great
[1:31:58] harvest out in their garden and said i
[1:32:00] felt led to come down here and to feed
[1:32:03] your children to give these things you
[1:32:05] see
[1:32:06] george mueller knew how to pray
[1:32:09] but one time george mueller was on his
[1:32:11] way over from bristol and he was on his
[1:32:14] way over bristol england not bristol
[1:32:16] tennessee or bristol virginia but he was
[1:32:18] on his way over to quebec canada and
[1:32:20] there he was at the bridge at the harbor
[1:32:23] about to take a ship and they had been
[1:32:26] sitting on the bridge for 24 hours and
[1:32:28] there george miller went to the captain
[1:32:31] he said captain i have to be in quebec
[1:32:33] by saturday i have an engagement that i
[1:32:36] am to speak at and i i have never missed
[1:32:39] one engagement and the captain said mr
[1:32:41] mueller i i don't know anything about
[1:32:44] you but i want you to know there's no
[1:32:46] way that i can get out of this harbor he
[1:32:48] said he said by looking at the density
[1:32:50] of this fog he said we'll not get out of
[1:32:53] here and you'll miss it he said mister
[1:32:56] he said mister he said i have never
[1:32:59] missed one time in 75 57 years i have
[1:33:02] never missed one engagement if you can't
[1:33:05] get me there god will bring some other
[1:33:07] way to get me there
[1:33:09] he said how about me and you go down
[1:33:11] into the chart room and why don't me and
[1:33:13] you just begin to pray real quick and
[1:33:16] there this captain thought man this
[1:33:17] dude's a lunatic he just broke out of
[1:33:19] the asylum ain't never seen anything
[1:33:21] like that and george miller gets down
[1:33:23] there and they get down there in a chart
[1:33:25] room and they start having a
[1:33:26] conversation he said look mr mueller
[1:33:30] the density of the fog is too much he
[1:33:32] said look your eyes trained on it that
[1:33:34] way but my eye is trained to look at the
[1:33:37] living god and not at the circumstances
[1:33:40] that i am faced to look upon
[1:33:42] he said and he began to get down and
[1:33:44] history said that george muller got down
[1:33:47] and he began to pray one of the most
[1:33:48] simple prayers and when he got back up
[1:33:51] the captain began to get down on his
[1:33:53] knee and george muller grabbed him said
[1:33:55] don't do that
[1:33:56] he said one thing you don't believe that
[1:33:59] god will answer secondly i believe that
[1:34:01] god already has he said captain if
[1:34:04] you'll go out there and throw open the
[1:34:06] door you'll see that the fog is gone and
[1:34:08] george muir made it to quebec on that
[1:34:11] saturday and it didn't break an
[1:34:13] engagement because he knew how to pray
[1:34:16] he knew how to call on god now here if
[1:34:19] men could operate in that kind of realm
[1:34:22] in a man age what about in this eagle
[1:34:24] age when we are flying above higher than
[1:34:27] any other man has ever flew before what

[1:46:04] he's trying to stop the very move of god
[1:46:10] don't listen set still
[1:46:12] and brother branham's own sister dolores
[1:46:15] would say bill
[1:46:17] while you was a preaching i got so
[1:46:20] excited she said i could have jumped up
[1:46:23] and shouted and run through a wall she
[1:46:25] said but but then when those people got
[1:46:28] to shouting like they did all of a
[1:46:31] sudden i felt like i was a little old
[1:46:33] nothing brother brangham said that was
[1:46:35] your time to stand up and praise the
[1:46:37] lord right there no matter what the
[1:46:40] enemy's whispered in your ear it's your
[1:46:42] time to shout no matter he said that was
[1:46:45] a time to stand up
[1:46:49] that was a time to rise up
[1:46:54] you see you are you are a spiritual
[1:46:57] priesthood
[1:46:58] offering up a sacrifice of praise
[1:47:05] we've been waiting for your time to
[1:47:07] shout you've been waiting for your hour
[1:47:09] you've been waiting let me say this to
[1:47:11] you
[1:47:12] you have had an ample opportunity
[1:47:15] you've been given opportunity after
[1:47:17] opportunity don't you be offended when
[1:47:19] somebody goes to shouting
[1:47:24] if you walked in their shoes for one
[1:47:26] moment you would know why they're
[1:47:28] shouting
[1:47:30] you would understand why they praise the
[1:47:33] way they do
[1:47:47] i'm not trying to promote anything here
[1:47:49] but i'm just
[1:47:54] i've been
[1:47:56] i've been
[1:47:57] i've been very
[1:48:01] be very sincere before you people
[1:48:04] i've been very sincere before you people
[1:48:06] to set
[1:48:08] my life to the third pool
[1:48:11] to the ministry of malachi for to
[1:48:13] studying this message
[1:48:15] i've been studying this message only 10
[1:48:19] 12 years now 12 13 years now
[1:48:22] but i have spent my time studying this
[1:48:24] message
[1:48:27] we've just caught
[1:48:29] i believe as a as a duty as a duty
[1:48:32] as as a servant of god it is my duty to
[1:48:34] get the message to the people
[1:48:39] and every weekend
[1:48:41] we get more and more now this may not be
[1:48:44] this is for you
[1:48:46] this is for you what what happens on the
[1:48:48] other side of that stream that's for
[1:48:50] them but this is for you
[1:48:54] you've heard me you've heard me talking
[1:48:56] about this you've heard me saying that
[1:48:58] that we're bumping into angels
[1:49:01] we're bumping into angels
[1:49:02] and reason why i'm saying that is
[1:49:05] because it's a quote that brother
[1:49:06] branham said that when you die
[1:49:09] he said if you die he said you're able
[1:49:10] to be aware you're in another world
[1:49:12] you're able to sense you're able to see
[1:49:14] he said but here you don't understand
[1:49:15] you can't understand everything he said
[1:49:17] you don't understand the why the way you
[1:49:19] do the way you do he said what it is
[1:49:21] you're bumping into those things all
[1:49:23] along he said there in that other
[1:49:25] dimension you can see why you're doing
[1:49:27] those things but in this dimension you
[1:49:28] can't see why you're doing those things
[1:49:30] i've been saying you heard me say it
[1:49:32] saturday night you heard me say you've
[1:49:33] heard me say it throughout this ministry
[1:49:35] we're bumping into angels that story
[1:49:37] brother branham would say that the
[1:49:39] reason why that he said you feel a
[1:49:41] strong a strange feeling come over top
[1:49:44] of you and say i could just shout i
[1:49:46] could just cry he said what is it you're
[1:49:48] bumping into the angel of the lord
[1:49:51] what was happening last weekend is you
[1:49:54] were bumping into angels and there with
[1:49:57] my own eyes i want you to go back and i
[1:49:59] want you i want you to go and listen and
[1:50:01] watch
[1:50:02] about my minute my marker minute 55
[1:50:06] i don't want you in my marker this is
[1:50:07] how my mind works forgive me but minute
[1:50:10] 55 on sunday morning all of the stops
[1:50:13] begin to get pulled out
[1:50:15] and all of a sudden the angel lord moved
[1:50:20] the angel lord began to move now this is
[1:50:22] what i want you to know what happened to
[1:50:23] me on saturday night i can't explain it
[1:50:26] but i was in another world and i was
[1:50:28] given those songs to sing and katie was
[1:50:30] writing them down as fast as i was
[1:50:31] spitting them out
[1:50:33] she was writing them down and i thought
[1:50:35] now
[1:50:37] what in the world i told him said
[1:50:39] tell dad he'll know what to do he'll
[1:50:41] know what to do just have a party
[1:50:43] just have a party have a holy ghost
[1:50:44] party
[1:50:47] well there i was i i was thinking
[1:50:49] brother matthew didn't matthew didn't
[1:50:51] sing that song you forgive me but i want
[1:50:52] you to understand
[1:50:54] i want you to understand some things
[1:50:56] and brother matthew didn't come down i
[1:50:58] believe it was number five
[1:51:00] for grace
[1:51:02] and brother matthew didn't sing that
[1:51:04] song you don't know like i know and i
[1:51:06] thought man
[1:51:07] because i i take ministry very serious
[1:51:10] and i take singing very seriously
[1:51:13] and i i'm very i'm very sincere in in
[1:51:15] worship because i i know it's it's the
[1:51:18] time right before the preaching of the
[1:51:19] word everything's in order and i i
[1:51:21] honestly would have never done this
[1:51:23] unless
[1:51:25] there would have been something said
[1:51:28] because i i want i want the atmosphere
[1:51:30] just right and you understand what i'm
[1:51:32] saying
[1:51:33] but all of a sudden i i began to sing
[1:51:35] that song you don't know like i know
[1:51:36] when you were you were reason the reason
[1:51:38] why you you you saw what happened the
[1:51:41] reason why you were rejoicing you
[1:51:43] watched your pastor that was supposed to
[1:51:45] be dead
[1:51:47] had a death warrant on him
[1:51:49] cancer said it would kill him brain
[1:51:51] brain cancer said it would kill him
[1:51:52] tumor said it would kill him and you
[1:51:54] watched your pastor ain't nobody ain't
[1:51:56] nobody i'm gonna say anybody ain't
[1:51:59] nobody can sing that song you don't know
[1:52:01] like i know like brother ron spencer
[1:52:04] and when you saw your leader dancing on
[1:52:07] the head of goliath it caused a shout
[1:52:10] throughout all of israel i'm not
[1:52:12] building up something i'm telling you
[1:52:15] you were bumping in
[1:52:17] to angels
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:24] we've got the head of this goliath
[1:52:27] and it's a time to chase down his
[1:52:29] brothers
[1:52:31] every one of his foes everyone and every
[1:52:34] enemy that has robbed something from you
[1:52:37] i'm telling you
[1:52:38] we've got his head on the sword cancer
[1:52:42] you are finished
[1:52:49] you don't know like i know
[1:52:53] what he's done for me
[1:53:00] and all of a sudden they begin to
[1:53:03] i believe it's all my heart
[1:53:06] because i know there was an angel
[1:53:08] circling there was an angel circling and
[1:53:11] all of a sudden it just looked like
[1:53:12] normal worship but all of a sudden there
[1:53:14] was a people that began to bump into
[1:53:16] some angels you seen some real miriam
[1:53:19] dances that were going forth and if you
[1:53:21] go back i can show you the clip if you
[1:53:23] need it but you can go back brother
[1:53:25] gabriel sister sarah brought this to my
[1:53:26] attention
[1:53:27] when my wife sister katie i wouldn't
[1:53:29] normally do this but because i have been
[1:53:31] preaching this quote that you're bumping
[1:53:33] into angels this is why i'm preaching
[1:53:35] this to you but you watch you watch my
[1:53:38] wife come down that aisle and dance
[1:53:40] backwards and all of a sudden she gets
[1:53:42] up here and it looks like she runs into
[1:53:44] a wall

[1:54:24] that believes
[1:54:27] this
[1:54:28] is him
