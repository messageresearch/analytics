listened again this morning and if you would like to listen to that I'm sure somebody here has a link that you can go back and listen to those Services they've been powerful and and we we just thank the Lord for what he's doing and God is so good to us I I want to I want to just share a couple things with you this morning we spoke to you on an inspired word to an inspired seed last night we have brother Kelly Hildebrandt coming for us next weekend and brother Tim Pruitt and a few years ago three years ago brother Kelly was coming in November December right in that time frame and it was before that we we had cancer or knowledge of cancer and uh and so his brother arrived on time he actually was just spot on time Kelly was three days trying to get here and so and so it looked like he couldn't come he couldn't arrive and and so we actually even had to go get him in Washington the luggage was lost and I and I just spoke to you on on that Saturday evening and during the week that week the Lord spoke to me and give me a sermon called don't worry don't worry and so I said whatever whatever brother Kelly has to say to us tomorrow tomorrow evening we'll just change the service and have it instead of the morning we'll have it in the evening and whatever brother Kelly has to say to us Satan's trying to stop and so when brother Kelly arrived and we picked him up and we took him and they had had a long night and he went home and he slept an hour or so and and then we came to service and brother Kelly stood in the Pulpit after I had spoke on on Saturday night on don't worry and brother Kelly presented me with a coin and it was the it's a commemoration of Normandy D-Day of June 6th of 1944. in World War II and it had a pebble of sand on it and the Canadians had made it and I had saw it and I really liked it I had no idea that he would bring me one and he presented it to me on that evening none of us knew what we were getting ready to face we will accept nothing less than full victory last year when brother Kelly came he presented me with this statue and as a statue of David with his foot on Goliath's head and that's where we believe that we've got our foot on Cancer's head [Applause] Hallelujah God knows doesn't he yeah I want to share a few things with you this morning personally from my heart and we want to remember Sister Linda in prayer as we get this from her request that God would just intervene in a lot of things there and and help her there in a special way amen if you'll stand to your feet and and then I'll just share us some things that's on my heart this morning Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 5. I just love the singing this morning thank you for those songs amen Isaiah 53 and verse 5. Andrew is speaking right now and we want to remember him in prayer and I want to speak again on inspired word to an inspired seed but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed I'd like for us all to read that together but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed he may be seated in first John chapter 4 and verse 4. year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you then he that is in the world second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 5 says not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God in second Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 19. and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29. he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the use shall faint and be weary and the young shall utterly fall verse 40 verse 31 but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount upon wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint could you read that verse with me but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount upon wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not thanked behold in Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 16. behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work I have created the waste to destroy read this next verse with me no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of them saith the Lord Revelations chapter 12 and verse 10. and I heard a loud voice in of Heaven in saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of her God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and not read these next words with me and they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and they love not their lives foreign the book that we have just read from is not a book of theory it's not a book of IFS this is God's word it is the inspired word of the Lord it is not a time-dated word it is for eternity the promises that are in there every one of them are true and they're still effective today we realize that there's some scriptures that are there that are historical that were there when David was there battles that they had to fight and God was an I am God for them then but I want you to just notice he's not just a historical God but he's a god of the living he's an I am God today in Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. if you could just flip that up for me real quick Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever could you read that with me Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever if he ever healed 2 000 years ago and he ever healed a thousand years ago he's the same God for us today brother Jolly he's our God he's more than just somebody else's God God wants to be a personal God to you now God wants you to take it into your heart and more than just think it but he wants you to speak it across your lips the most Supernatural part about you as a human being is your tongue and your lips because you speak positive or you speak negative you have the power in your lips to create your atmosphere around you we come to church we've left home maybe you've had troubles at home maybe you had a flat tire on the way to church maybe you had difficulties maybe maybe you've had trouble with your job and we come into church and we pray and get ourselves ready for the service of the Lord the the man of God comes and he begins to sing and music is played music begins to calm down spirits there's an important part of music David would go and play before Saul because Saul was troubled in his Spirit he was backslidden and those demons would take a hold of him and David be an anointed of God would come and play and as he would play those demons would loose they would loose themselves off of Saul and he would fill an atmosphere an atmosphere of the Holy presence of God and would feel that it would release him that's what happens to us when we come to church the music begins to play Maybe It's Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of Glory Divine I'm an heir of salvation I'm purchased of God the man of God begins to sing whether you know this or not songs were inspired of the Lord the writer begins to write under that inspiration songs of Victory songs of Joy songs of healing songs of praise unto God and as you sing those songs before the Lord and you begin to worship we don't come here to be entertained there's no stars among us we come here to Worship the Lord he is worthy of our worship and is you not just the son as you begin to sing it will change your atmosphere where you're sitting it'll change your attitude and you sing it and you sing it not just to mumble but you sing it loud enough to wear that from your vocal cords and you hear it in your ears you're singing victory you're singing Praise maybe it comes time for the preaching of the word men of God become inspired with a certain scripture with a certain thing and they begin to they begin to preach the word then that word goes into your ears and there's something on the inside of you said that's real that's for me it was like God was in my kitchen it was like God's in my car God's a personal God he's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and before long it begins to Echo in your heart and then you begin to respond and you say well brother Ron response is really not important well did you marry a mannequin you set her over in the corner and you say honey I love you she's always got the same look she always smells the same she never moves come on come on brother God's not looking for a mannequin for a wife [Applause] The Book of Psalms is full of songs are you with me God's looking for your response to the work and then it arms you for the battles that you will face next week and the week after and then it gives you strength for the battles that you have been through let me just give you a little little help here the battles that you have been through in your past are only preparation for the one that you're getting ready to go through [Applause] it was training grounds to get you ready for the battle in front of you the battle will never be over until we go to the other side but when the battle is over we shall wear a crown wear a crown wear a crown when my battle is over we will wear a crown [Applause] all right I want to share this this morning because it's an active word and we'll just share a few testimonies that all right I was in prayer this morning and as I was in prayer the Lord spoke to me and he spoke to me about a little girl here in the building her name is Zoe Zoe is a has a problem with her voice to speak she's been going to specialists and the Lord spoke to me and said I sent her through this to develop her singing voice so she would have a certain sound [Applause] brother Ron I don't know much about that God spoke to me on a Sunday morning and I came to the service and I told brother William that God's going to visit us at his house today and I saw a vision that morning if Wesley couldn't walk at that time and he's way past walking and you've seen the video God showed me the vision that I would pick him up and I even said Lord he won't let me pick him up and I saw myself walking up and down the aisle and today Wesley's busier what you don't understand God knows what we got to go through to get us what we're going to go to remind us he's a living God today Wesley wants to stand on the chair right there where you're at he amends he talks to me in church wave at everybody Wesley you're like the Martin boys [Applause] brother Marcus was on a plane with me over 20 years ago and I looked for him for 20 years and told the story about brother Marcus what you heard him saying was a miracle brother Marcus was on the plane his life was devastated but God rich in Mercy and a few months ago we were sitting in the we were sitting he lives in North Carolina drives three and a half four hours to come to our services thank you for that and and sister Phyllis is his sister if you haven't got all that put together but anyway brother Marcus and as a lovely wife and children and so we we we were on the airplane together when we were sitting in the fellowship and I had told the story of meeting Marcus meet in a man on the plane and he told me about how he was raised in the message and he had got away and I told that over and over and over in a lot of places and a lot of conventions I was sitting in the fellowship hall and the Lord spoke in my ear the man that was on the plane is sitting beside of you and I spoke to him and I said we met one another before and he said no I don't think we have I said we met on a plane and I began to tell him the story and he said yes we yes we it was a phenomenal moment for me for now what was history is now reality what a miracle his wife is going to come amen well brother Ron just just to give you some help here brother Marcus brother Stephen would you stand I walked down one night and I shook your hand and your wife wasn't here and I told you Tara's coming won't you stand [Applause] well since we're on the road I told you he would make it through the war and he would come home and he brought me a flag home and you're here and he was the one that had the vision that that this message that we preach here and these Services should be alive to the world and Jeremy had the vision to have computers upstairs and and and these cameras all over the building to where that if you're sick and people all over the world send us notes listen I get notes before I get out of service of how great the sermon was it's not me it's God but you had the vision that they could see it God bless you brother Jeremy God preserved brother Donny's life brother Donnie has fought cancer I asked him last night he's fought cancer for about five years today he sets an almost horrendous pain he's not able to hardly do anything but of all the weak he wants to be here in service and play music it's paying to which doctors can't hardly help him but he endures the pain to be able to send him these Services I want to say this to you in the Eternal Realm that pain will mean nothing brother Donnie was offered a lot of contracts to sing music all over in a popular realm he will get paid much more sitting here [Applause] I don't believe I'd worry about that car wreck God knows he's here he knows how to take care of that we have children here they can stand Isaac Zoe she's already waved at me Isaac if you'll stand on the seat there dude you look good for those that don't know that's exactly what I look like when I was a baby boy like that exactly you can take my picture and look at as a child that's exactly what I look like as a little boy now I didn't look much like Zoe but they those were impossible children both was not able to come because of conditions of of her body and then a wreck to which it would destroy Davey but God rich in Mercy brother Tim Pruitt Stood Beside of your bed and said God's got work for you to do and he sits here as a pillar in this church brother Brian you shouldn't be doing that my church I'm the pastor here Reagan and Ally I'm not going to ask you to stand on the seats but where are you guys at they'll stand couldn't have children and the Lord spoke to me in Louisiana of what was wrong and I told sister Katie and brother Andrew God will touch your womb and I said the next time that I feel the angel of the Lord here in the services I'll call you down she was upstairs and we called her down and we pray for her six weeks later we got some really good news Reagan was on the way now brother Tim Pruitt thinks that they need to have another child and call it Pruitt sister Connie sits here and she was eat up with sarcoidosis and one of the examinations I was standing beside her and they let

one night after church is this okay we went to eat at Sea Rose after church and we were sitting as a family together and behind us set brother Denny and sister Sean and Mary is that how it was brother Denny and I turned around to her and I said I saw a vision Zach's on his way Amen brother Zach it's okay if you want to stand [Applause] I was sitting in Edmonton and just give you a little background where this part came from the other morning I was in prayer and I was deeply burdened about going this year in July I was deeply burdened I'll be honest with you I was just phenomenally burdened I said Lord would you just let me know if I'm going to have the strength to be able to go to Edmonton and preach those meetings and almost immediately I got a text from Brother Ed hammermeister and he said brother Ron I want you to come and preach the meetings so I believe I'm going to have the strength to go [Applause] I was sitting in Edmonton at a hotel a set into the deaf studying and he looked up and saw a vision I saw a vision of Matthew sitting on the side of the road in the gravels holding his knee and I saw a motorcycle going around in circles I always hated them things it's okay brother Ernie it's just part of my deal I hated him because I really wanted to ride him back I called him and I said Matt are you okay and he said yeah Daddy I'm okay I said hey I how was the wreck on the motorcycle he said Daddy nobody knows that but Cassie and the guy that came to get the motorcycle nobody knows it he said we haven't told a soul well there's a higher power God rich in Mercy was watching over him as that bike's going around in a circle that could have been a whole lot different well you're talking about people here well can you can I give you a couple more we were in Germany and brother Tim Pruitt's wife was going through some real cycles of life and she was about a loser mind and in the middle of the service while I'm preaching I called her out and she stood in the middle of the aisle and I prayed for her and God totally 100 percent healed her of that issue in her life brother Tim said I left the room with one wife and I went back home with another wave she had a brain bleed and after the brain bleed she was so depressed because she couldn't see like she used to see and she was so having so much trouble the year before they had a little boy named Drew and Drew come into a very powerful moment now Drew couldn't walk and Bethany was bringing a blanket through the prayer line for Lydia's Baby that had been born with jaundice I had just before told Timothy that was standing beside of me I saw a vision of Drew walking and so I when Bethany comes through I said Bethany where's where's Drew at she said he's he's in the he's in the bed he's asleep I said Bethany we asked her what the blanket was for and it was for the baby with jaundice and just to give you an idea God healed that baby immediately from the jaundice I said go get Drew we need to pray

was sitting in the room and Drew was at her feet and God came through and touched her not only touched her but Drew begin to run all over that house we're talking about a God that's not a 2 000 years ago God This Is Our God [Applause] the next year I was preaching the meeting there and I asked where Drew was I think he was in bed again I don't think he's in bed this morning but they went and got him he was in his pajamas little red pajamas and I said Drew we're going to have a prayer line after a while in this meeting and I said you know I said we're going to walk because you're a miracle I'm standing before maybe maybe six seven hundred people and I said we're going to walk across this platform and there's people in a little while maybe an hour from now are going to walk in those steps and they're going to get miracles [Applause] they're going to get miracles did you hear me they're going to get Miracles I don't want to know what your need is but this service is your service because God changed me yesterday where I was going to go this morning so God's got plans and when God has plans he's going to do phenomenal things can I give you just a couple of Miracles that took place in that meeting in that meeting in that meeting Mariah who had Al capisia and she had brought three bobby pins with her her hair was gone she walked across that stage and said I want to be able to use these bobby pins God restored her glory she got married last year I believe it was with a full head of hair Jessica brother Wendell's wife that preached to us just a little while ago brother Wendell who preached sister Jessica came across there she had a very Wayward Son and in the moment that she God kept speaking to me you stay on this stage until Jessica comes and when she stepped in front of me I said God's going to give you your son back that son now serves the Lord [Applause] we left the stage we got to the cabin and the Lord spoke to Aaron and said you'll never be the same from this day forward brother Aaron Oglesby is not an average preacher he could be a convention preacher anywhere he'd be here in June and he'll be here in September that's how much I think of him in that moment I saw the vision of a little boy walking across the yard with a Disney World Mickey Mouse on his shirt with his finger up like that and I said Andrew we're going to have a boy and he said not me Daddy and the little fella that just stood up back there listen this is more than imagination in the same prayer line that we prayed for we prayed for them the very next people in the prayer line was Jonathan or you guys at are you hiding she went out no she didn't right there she is and the next words was the same Angel that's visiting their home is visiting your home Adonai would you stand

them now have living babies now you may doubt The Finnish boy coming back to life and you may doubt the cloud but I want to tell you our God's a living tonight he's a living God [Applause] Satan gets in our ears and he whispers to us it's not going to happen it's impossible it's impossible it's not going to happen in Sarasota Florida I was staying with brother Tim Pruitt in a Airbnb I was staying in a there with Timothy Pruitt Jason Jackson brothers all Brothers Timothy Pruitt and myself was all in the same house well you're talking about a barrel of fun but God gave me a vision that I was getting ready this is all the month before that I got diagnosed with cancer that I was getting ready to go through the worst the worst Valley of my life and destruction but at the bottom of that Valley there was a girl there and she looked like she was in horrible condition and I asked her are you ready to go home that girl is sitting right there named whether a lot of you run understand it or not that vision three years later we prayed with her at this altar the other day don't tell me God's not rich in Mercy I could stand here for hours and tell you Miracle after Miracle laughter Miracle laughter miracle but I'm not just interested in the Miracles that has happened I'm not just interested in the Miracles that has happened listen we need more than just getting healed of cancer because God already healed me at Calvary 2000 years ago and he told me he told me if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before and he has within minutes of him telling me that I saw the vision of you walking down this this aisle with a baby in your hands I'm not talking about that baby either I'd like for you goddess to take a stroll this morning holding hands because it's laying right in your future we took a picture the other day with the before now we're going to exercise it I want the whole world to watch you two walk around this area thank you to be seated sisters you know when I preached your mother's funeral and I stood in the room with you as a family and I stepped out and walked in front of you guys when I turned and looked back at you just before we walked into the sanctuary God spoke to me and said she's coming home and now you're here David good to be home they told you we didn't believe the message we didn't believe it brother Chris and Sister Mary you can say today they were wrong come on they were wrong welcome home I wouldn't do this without instructions from the Lord I absolutely would not do this I don't want to point you out but hunter I don't want to point you out God brought you here God brought you here and God has great plans when I was studying yesterday as I was as I was studying he called your name and it's like he said it's like as a lawyer Hunter has to take the loss it goes back in all the books and those things that have been judged on he can now use them as the case for the case that you're trying brother Branham said when the first time you preached a sermon he said he walked out and he said to people laughed and the people cried and they were emotional but his Pastor took him back in the office and said that's the worst I've ever heard he said you got the people laughing you got them crying but you didn't take the word and the word is what is what we've got to have Hunter is a lawyer you just can't work on the emotions of the people you got to take loss and as he spoke to me those things yesterday I thought I thought about it how that we stand in this Pulpit with the message and with this Bible and it's not just words it's not just words brother duck but it's power it's life the scripture said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name in my name lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name you'll cast out devils are you with me this message was sent to us to open the book and to reveal the seals and reveal the Thunders and reveal the word of God that was hidden for for thousands of years and it was given to us that we could defeat the Devil anywhere anytime under any condition [Music] and it goes across your lips and I want to ask you then what are we have to be afraid about amen I exercised and I shared with you faith can you imagine how many times through the through time that the devil whispered in my ear three years they're not having a baby they're not having a baby the vision said you must have missed it but I can look in the word and it says that Abraham believed God and 25 years later this isn't an opinion here [Applause] 25 years later God turned Abraham and Sarah and actually told Sarah is there anything too impossible for God brother on you guys believe sister Connie goes and puts flowers on brother Homer's grave one day that grave is going to be like the Tomb of Jesus [Music] one day it's going to be an empty casket laying down inside of there when you go to your loved one's grave they may be in there now but there's going to come a moment in the moment in the twinkling of an eye this word's going to come into effect and their mortal is going to take on immortality and we're going to be changed how do you know that he said it I believe it that settles it thank you I don't say that just because it's an opinion I say it because it's fact and it's a fact that these bodies are going to be changed and I'm not going to have gray hair no longer I'm not going to have glasses no longer I'm not going to have cancer no longer three and my little buddy is going to have his wife again and his feet that has been debilitated since he was a child he's going to be able to run like a deer don't you underestimate my God there's nothing impossible for him to do [Applause] Terry Klein there was a day that you was an orphaned child but you're not that child no longer you got a family all across this building that loves you with all their hearts you may have scars that you've lived with in your life but God give you a family [Applause] I read this to you before we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets and we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender we will fight for our families we will fight for our children we will fight for our healing we will fight for our deliverance we will fight for joy we will fight for peace we will fight for the Holy Ghost we will fight until our bodies are changed and we are sitting at the marriage supper of the Lamb I'm going to share with you just a few more scriptures Philippians 4 verse 13. I can do all things could you read it with me I can do all things through Christ strengthens me people tell me that I don't look like a cancer patient I'll be really honest with you I don't feel like one moments moments I still decided man yesterday the other few weeks ago he's been there he's a he's a fellow that takes care of patients as they come in wheelchairs and takes them to where they need to go we were standing and waiting in our line for our number to be called to be checked in he was standing beside of me and he said you know they talk a lot about you here they really he said you're the talk of this place you don't look like you've got cancer I was reading my chart this week and I thought about what he said my chart says I have brain cancer my chart says I have lung cancer my chart says that my my kidneys are abnormal my chart says there are spots on my organs I have sugar diabetes my chart says a lot of things but whose report do we believe there's people say I got a toe anchor I got this acre that ache let me just say God has put an example in front of you [Applause] whatever your excuse is bring it to church and if I wasn't a good enough example for you there's a fella sitting here with his leg cut off and said in a wheelchair and he took pain medicine on it way up the so he could get through the service and listen some to You Preach to you testify to you encouraged you let me just say you got no excuse thank you get over your pity party get over you wowzy wowzy woo it's all about me listen it's more than about you it's all about God you put God first in everything in your life God will help you through cancer he'll help you through your Valley he'll make your womb fertile [Applause] he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 10 therefore I take pleasure in infirmities this is God's word this is the Apostle Paul who writes all of this in a dungeon not in an office not at an iPad not after he had eat a steak dinner at the bottom of a about a 14 foot hole and they would take him out and soldiers would walk him around and while he was right while he was being walked around and chains he got inspired to about a sermon put on the whole armor of God no doubt as he looked up at the guy that was walking him around in all that armor he didn't go what a horrible thing if I hadn't preached this this message I wouldn't be in this dungeon so he sent a word for 2 000 years a word to real Believers put on the whole armor of God therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong let's read that last portion for when I am weak then I am strong say it to your neighbor right there where you're at for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but a power hand of love and of a sound mind you do not know this my brother Homer would quote that almost every every day in the office back here because he felt like his mind was slipping away and he would just say this for God hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind listen quoting the scripture will bring you power it's an inspired word to an inspired seed you as a believer quoting the scripture destroys the devil you will not destroy him with your good looks you will not destroy him with your education you will destroy the Devil by taking God's word which is a sword and destroying him Psalms 18 and verse 1 I love I will love thee O Lord my strength the Lord is my rock and my Fortress my deliver my God my strength in whom I will trust my Buckler and the Horn of my salvation and my high power Romans 1 and verse 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal God and godhead so that they are without excuse listen people that are sent to Hell have walked across the blood of Jesus Christ God gave every man and woman the opportunity to serve him every man and woman every man and woman it God don't send you to hell you sing yourself to hell it's your choice [Music] a man in Louisiana Shreveport raised his hand and said there is no God in that moment lightning struck him when they were having his casket placed into the ground lightning hit the casket and throwed the man out of the casket you don't play with God you don't play with God now maybe let me just address the critic it's for a moment I'm I'm just I'm almost done people said Noah is crazy well just wait there's no rain up there just wait he's preached that same thing 120 years just wait just wait no doubt now I'm getting into two weeks from now sermon what's Jesus doing being beat like he is he's healing me why did Jesus the son of God the Messiah why did he allow himself to be beat like no other man had ever been beat he's healing me it's not what you see it's what God's got a plan for why is he allowed to be able to put thorns on his head and being screamed that even even even to have barabba set free why do you allow himself to be on Calvary I'm the reason if there's anybody to be mad that Jesus is on a cross I'm the reason he would have come and did it all if you was the only one on the earth he would have come and redeemed you he would have come and saved you he would have come and healed you but my trials are so great you're not looking at the picture correctly now if I can just if I can just wind this up brother Ron we don't believe it's about
