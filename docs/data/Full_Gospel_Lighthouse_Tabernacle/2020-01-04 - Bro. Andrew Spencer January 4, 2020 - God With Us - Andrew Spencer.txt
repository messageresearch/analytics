I trust [Music] Oh [Music] freedom is Oh freedom and I receive [Music] freedom is he Oh freedom is Oh [Music] [Applause] Damas Oh [Music] when I leave [Music] I reach my head and if my ass wear my hair comes from [Music] Oh sickness can't stay any longer your perfect love is nasty Alfie [Music] the god power and then is your way that my life is a rich pie Oh change my my haircuts wrong [Music] [Music] what a God that we're serving to see hey man I wanted to say that I appreciate your prayers for us this past weekend as we were there in North Carolina brother Joe greens we certainly felt your and your prayers I know that's it's honestly that's what I'm counting on is is that I've got a people back home that's praying for me fighting with me you may think that your prayer is unheard but I want you to know that it's your prayers that that are that are effective and people are able to have breakthroughs and God is able to minister we know that God follows His Word and ministers and so the Lord did marvelous things and he is mighty to be praised brother Joe and the church and the families there they send that greetings back to you and just I just want to wish you there a happy New Year to you and here we are in 2020 and who would have thought 20 years ago when everybody was worried about y2k and storing up water and everything else that the whole world is gonna fall apart and we'd be standing here 20 years later nobody anticipated it but God did God knew that we'd be here and I knew that we'd still have young people that that needed to get the Holy Ghost God knew that we'd be here and God's with us he's not left us here alone to fight this battle and and I think it's amazing that our pastor my dad closed out 2019 preaching on courage and I say this to you that it's gonna take more courage in 2020 than it did in 2019 because we know that the Bible tells us that hell hath enlarged itself and opened her mouth without measuring and so we know that that we have an enemy that's going after us but I want to speak these words and say them to you that we will not be defeated and we will not be deterred we will give no quarter and we will not show any mercy to the devil we won't show any mercy to sickness to doubt or to fear nor to sin but we're going to run into 20/20 just like we ran into 2019 we're going on with an anticipation that we're going to win we've got one goal and that Surat sir and I've got good news for you there's not one devil that's going to stop us from that rapture so I run into 20/20 with that in our mind hey man so we're gonna do what the Bible tells us over in the book of Hebrews chapter 2 therefore we're gonna give more earnest heed to the things which we've heard lest at any time we would let them slip we're not going to neglect this great salvation that's been delivered to us but we're going to receive it we're gonna walk right into that body change we're gonna walk right into that promise walk right into that vision that was seen of you and I they're worshiping God you know as as you that have been here for many years and and have been a part of our own ministry and you know that every year at the beginning of the year I always give a theme for the year last year my theme was of recognizing him and I believe that we recognize Christ amongst us this year I want my my theme for the year to start out and this will be my theme for the whole year that God is with us and we will see miracles God is with us and we will see miracles that's my theme as we go into 2020 and I want to say to you as a church I'm going to tell you and I want you to believe like you've never believed I want you to pray like you've never prayed I want you to ask God big things because he's a big God I want you to accept the things that God has said to you that these promises are unto you that they are yay and amen I want you to receive them just like he said we're going to see God with us in 2020 and we are going to see miracles but if we're going to see those things you're gonna have to believe like never before we're gonna have to take courage but be of good cheer I have overcome the world little children and you shall overcome also amen so we commit our ways unto the Lord and we trust in the Lord and he shall bring it to pass hey man God will not fail us he is with us hey man if you have your Bibles this evening we'll go right into the word here at Matthew chapter 1 and verse 20 and then down to John chapter 1 and verse 14 I like to I like to speak to you these things they've been kind of overwhelming my life here in the last last little bit here and I just kind of overwhelmed with this thought and kind of just a very staggering thought in that I spoke a little bit on the on these lines that brother Jose and and I would like to take this theme and maybe I will not title every service God with us for 2020 but that will be my theme you will hear me preach from this thought throughout the whole year you see I've been preaching the same thought I've been preaching from the same message that I started preaching ten years ago on influence that was my very first message and I was I was going back through my notes today and next month 10 years 10 years ago I've been preaching 10 years and that just kind of seemed to went real fast but you know I've been feeding off of that that sermon ever since then one sermon just rolls right into the next one you know and I'm still influenced I'm still influenced by the mighty angel amen so I want to I want to preach to you this evening and on God with us and that thought right there is enough to close our Bibles and leave and go home tonight because just that fault right now that he said that he never leaves you and that he never forsake you and he said that where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them where more than two or three here tonight so when they God is here so a man let's just read this this portion of Scripture here Matthew chapter 1 2 verse 20 but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and a dream saying Joseph thou thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us John chapter 1 and verse 14 a man as you're turning there I just like to make mention to you that next weekend or next Saturday night we will be doing as we did the last few years we will be taking a portion of the service make it a little special service for you for the coming end of the year and brother William brother Matthew myself and brother Ron will be speaking about 15 minutes each and just giving giving some things and committing what we're committing unto the Lord we're all taking about 15 minutes but you know brother on has he's got its seniority and he can take as much time as he wants to so so us three us three boys will go first and well let's will let senior Papa come in behind us and and and just go ahead and just show us how it's done so a man John chapter 1 and verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory that's a beautiful thought right there we beheld his glory the glory as the of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth amen let's just bow our hearts this evening unto the Lord heavenly father we so thank you Lord Jesus for this privilege that we might bow our heads to the dust of the earth from which we came and Lord we sense your nearness even now father Lord Jesus every time we read over your holy script Lord we realize that we are reading you and in letter form my father we're asking tonight that that the word would come off the pages and that you would speak to us Lord Jesus Lord minister to our hearts and we pray that you would reach out your hands upon this congregation and that you have blessed them in a special way lord I pray that you would bring them a light Lord Jesus may you quicken the word to the hearts just now whatever they have a need of Lord they hold in their heart and I pray that you administer to them in a special way and we'll be careful to serve you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen may God bless you may be seated this evening a man amen as I said would like to speak to you on on God with us God with us hey man you ain't got to get up and leave yet brother Doug hey man I'm thankful to have my mom my buddy and brother Gabriel back here with us and his friends so we so welcome you here in the Lord and their family to us all and just like everyone here where we're a great big family and the family of God man but as we begin to reflect upon this thought here but we as believers no matter how long we've been Christians no no matter if we've had in our experience maybe last week or maybe 50 or 20 years ago whatever whatever the timeslot might be for you but that thought that God is with us it's such a staggering and overwhelming an amazing thought in its own that God is that God is with us and we realize as Christians and any person here we realize that we're absolutely nothing without him and that he is the one that controls you and I tonight and I want you to know that I realize tonight that I'm helpless and hopeless as can be unless he comes but I was I was given a commandment in the word that he told us to preach this message and and Paul said as much as is as much as in me is now I am ready to preach this gospel unto you and so I realized tonight that God that God is not going to use trees to speak to us though he could he could have used wood to speak to us he could have used flowers to speak to us but God chose man to speak to us and he is the one that is in control of you and I and we realize today that we're completely hopeless and helpless without him and he's the one that controls us we speak about the things that happen in 2019 and we talk about the miracles that took place and we could reflect upon those things and talk about those things of how great and staggering the things of the miracles that we have seen amongst us but we realize that that was none other than God that was none other than than Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we promise that these signs shall follow them that believe and we realize that these promises are to us as believers and and if we believe we realize that if we have reverence under the word and if we respect this word that those things will operate amongst us and that's why I believe that we as a church we have seen so many mighty things amongst us we have seen miracles we have seen we have seen produções comeback we have seen young people's lives completely turned around we have seen them be baptized a fresh for the holy ghost we have seen lives completely transformed we seen livers completely put in place we seen sail on top of sail built upon in the Church of the Living God and we see a mighty God that has amongst us these things are not some far-off they're not just in conventions but these things are every single weekend unto us and we're not just waiting on convention time but I believe that right now that God is here I believe that God can speak to us and God can minister to us in such a way that we would have to say that that was Jesus here and you remember that here that prophet had a little prophet would stand Merritt he would he would roll his shoulders back and he would say now you know I can't do anything unless he comes and he would stand there and talk to you and and he would speak to the patient that would stand in front of him and he would he would speak those sayings and he would say and he said now I'm trying to catch her spirit you've heard those things and and in there there he is he's trying to catch that spirit and trying to speak now he's not contacting their soul but he's speaking to their spirit trying to find their spirit here he is any any he says now you know I can't do anything without him coming but eat all of a sudden he says now he's here now now takes fear I take control of every unsound spirit every evil spirit here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of the Lord and watch those demons completely defeated we realize that that was not a man but that was God you see no man can produce these things that we're seeing no man can produce the things that we're watching amongst us this is God that is with us now in Christ the mystery of God revealed he said know God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there was there wasn't even a moon a star and Adam milah cure anything but he was God but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object to worship here he is Elohim himself but here nothing had been created there so we realized that the very first thing that he created was angels that he might be worshiped we realized that tonight but he wasn't exactly God at that time because God is an object of worship and there was nothing the worship him so he created angels so here in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love and in him was to be a father in him was to be a son and in him was to be a savior in him was to be healer and all of these great attributes that we see already expressed these things were in God's mind to think about that that God is with us now it's one thing for you and I to say that somebody is with us but to say that God is with us you know what you know sometimes when you're walking down a dark alley your sisters you're walking down a dark alley it makes you feel good to know that you got your husband right there with you it makes you feel good that you can slip your arm around him now right up underneath of his elbow and you can hold on tight to him it it makes you feel good to know that he's with you but to realize that that God is with you and at any moment at any time in life that you can slip your arm underneath of his great arm of power and that he can take you through Laodicea and realize that you're not alone here in this battle but God is with you God sees you in your prayers God sees you in your circumstance but it's such an amazing fault that that God is with us to me I I'm moved by this thought I can't hardly sleep because of this law I can't hardly I can't hardly pray without crying just thinking about this song I can hardly I can't hardly speak to somebody without these things are cooing out of my soul because this is an amazing God that is with us we're talking about the God of Abraham and Isaac can take up this God is with us the God that robbed the world off of his fingertips that bod is in us that God is with us he didn't leave us here alone to think that the Supreme Being Jehovah the eternal and infinite spirit the creator and the sovereign one of the universe is with you and I the God that is a spirit that must be worshipped in spirit and in truth that God is with you and I the God that is declared to be light and love and the invisible one the god that is declared to be the unsearchable incorruptible eternal and immortal God that God's with you and I tonight the god that is declared to be omnipotent I'm missing the all-knowing God the God that has declared to be the omnipresent God it may feel like Satan has got you surrounded it may feel like the demons of Hell have got you surrounded but those demons are not omnipresent are you with me though that Satan himself is not omnipresent there's only one being that is omnipresent and that's God and God is with you young people when you walk through the halls that God is with you when you go down the hospital rooms brother Nathanael that God is with you when you go to college come on somebody the demons of hell try to whisper in your ear and say that they're there watching your every move but they're not there that's a lie straight from the pits of hell but you can rest assure that God Almighty is there when you wake up he's there when you're sleeping he's there when you're dreaming he's there when you're worshiping he's always there hello yeah he is declared to be the immutable the only wise God the glorious and most have a perfect God the one that is declared to be the holy and just and true upright God the is one the good God a great God a gracious God a faithful God a merciful God the God that is declared to be long-suffering he's jealous and compassionate that God is a consuming fire that God there is none beside him there's none before him there's none like him there's nothing good but he hallelujah he feels all heaven time space and eternity and that God should be worshiped in spirit and in truth to realize today that that God is with you and I I don't care what you came packing in this service tonight but you can walk out right now and realize that all of heaven is behind you whoo God's with me hallelujah to realize that you're not alone in this battle that he is here walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and he held the Stars in his hand they were not here just wandering around on their own like a wandering star but they were in his hands they were in his control and if he had our messengers in his hand how much more as he got you and I on his hand in his control in his power you woke up and you thought yous gonna make out your own plans today God's got this [Applause] hallelujah the Bible said in Genesis Lord that in the beginning God created heaven and earth and the earth was without form it was a bunch of chaos and boy kind of like your life and darkness was upon the face of the deep kind of like your life but all of a sudden the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light so God here in the beginning the eternal he wasn't even God God's an object of worship we've already established that so he wasn't even that he was ill of him he was the eternal one I will be don't mind me talking about God it's my theme for 2020 God with us hallelujah he was they loved him the eternal one but in him was thoughts that he wanted to become material and what did he do that he spoke a word and the word was materialized and that's the whole picture from Genesis all the way over to Revelation it's nothing wrong its Elohim materializing himself so that he can be touched the self existing one materializing himself so that he can be felt you see I'm not talking about a God of history I'm not talking about a God that was I'm talking about a God that is I'm not talking about a god that's dead I'm talking about a God that's living I'm talking to you about a God that will not and cannot change a god that don't back up and God that does not know the word retreat a god that will fight your battles 2020 maybe staring you down but I want you to rest assure that the God of heaven is with you don't shake your neighbors hand they might be sick to look at them and tell them God's with me if you're sick don't shake my head Alleluia salute thy brethren as Paul said but the Bible said in first a first Timothy three and 16 that without without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh think about that God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into glory God the self existing one robing himself in humanity who the great Jehovah God that was there in the very beginning he came down and he was made tangible by living in the body of his son son declaring and reconciling the world to himself does not the Bible say to you and I that we have a faithful high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he knows what you're going through you can look over in the early history of the church and find that Jesus was there sitting by the roadside and that Jesus was groaning with a headache Wow because he had to go through pain migraines like you and I he had to come to earth and be manifested in flesh so that he could feel like you and I could feel are you with me this evening you see because you in the beginning you were in God but God could not fellowship with you there in spirit form we do not believe in preexisting of souls but you were in God as an attribute and you see you were a seed you can find that in God's power to transform that you are a word you are a seed and then now you are manifested so that Christ can work that God can fellowship with you he cannot fellowship with you as the great I am in heaven but God countenance ended and came and native himself of no reputation and he humbled himself into the cross and he took upon in the form of man who this God was there hanging on the cross 2,000 years ago to save you from the sins that you hadn't even committed at 2,000 years ago but this is an eternal atonement that was taking place 2,000 years ago you may not have been manifested here 2,000 years ago but the blood of Jesus Christ has never lost its power it will never lose its power it reaches to the highest it's all the way into the lowest of valleys this blood has the power to wipe away all of your sins you may be the lowest of lows you may have been abused in life you may have been talked about in life you may have been beaten in life maybe not had the right amount of her the right structure as a family but this God is with you you may not have had the right kind of father figure but I want you to know you've always had a heavenly father and he's watched over your seed all the way back from Adam he's been looking for you and you're here whoo hallelujah think about that God wanted to become flesh so that he could feel like you so he could understand like you this great God dropped down from a supernatural being downed into something tangible a God that we could see a God that we could touch a God that we could handle he has anointed me to preach the gospel unto you this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears this God Elohim was made manifest I'm not talking about a God at 2,000 years ago I'm talking about God right now you see a lot of times people get their eyes on the god of Calvary and they miss the God all right now you see where if we're gonna look for God brother William where we're going to look for Matt we're not gonna look for him robed in a robe of 2000 years ago not wearing sandals like they would've wore 2,000 years ago but God in human flesh right now God worshiping and fellowshipping in flesh right now I know this is going to catch you off guard but you know that the Bible says that you are gods that God dwelleth in you and that you are the temple of the Holy Ghost that God the God that created those flowers I thought that created the wood that is built here that God is living in human flesh today yeah you're not going to hear this down at the Catholic Church and you're probably not going to hear it down at the Methodist Church where the Baptist hurts but I want to say to you I want to say it here and I want to say it all over cross the airwaves of the internet there is a people on earth right now that is packing the very image of the son of man on the inside of him we are Ward beings we are sons and daughters of God we are the children of the light and there is power there's a power packed on the inside of your soul God has been waiting on this moment he saved this past you last and you are here to manifest the Son of Man the great I am the god of miracles the God of Abraham the god of jacob the god of isaac there's god's my god he's with me in me and will fulfill every scripture that was ordained for me to fulfill the bible said i was forwarding to be here that saddl sit let the heathen rage let the critics rise we are ordained for the moment God brother Dimmie is with us settle down y'all settle down everybody says we're emotional put your seatbelts on y'all better be careful they'll call us Pentecostals thank you for doing that that's the greatest compliment that you could have give us I never was in the Pentecostal church but I have myself a good old Pentecostal experience I got the same baptism of the Holy Ghost said Peter got that the mother Mary got the same God that met Paul on the road to Damascus I met him hallelujah I'm not talking about a God in the picture I'm talking about a God in flesh I had shipping in Rome I hate seaplane in Jeffersonville our headship is not some Pope I hate shippers not some man I had ship plane even a prophet Elena it ain't even an office rocket or a hireling prophet come on Church of the Living God our head ship is in glory I came from God I'm going back to God if Jesus said I came from God and the God we will return what are you and I today God can't leave you here he's gonna change your body [Applause] calm yourself I'm not talking about a god some voice far off I'm talking about a God right now some people want to say that was only said in the 60s but I want to take you all the way back to deity of Jesus Christ 1948 he said deities not in heaven but deities in you come on somebody and if all of the seals have been released off the back of the book what about right now we're in our focus we are heaven we are seated in heavenly places we're blessed to be sitting here in all heavenly blessings he ordained me to this spot whoo he's here and he's declaring himself but he's Hebrews 13 and eight the same yesterday today and forever and to think that that God is with us God of creation God that would speak the moon into existence God that would speak the Sun into existence the garden that would watch it roll off the end of his fingertips as it were and let it roll out there a hundred million years and stop it in its place what a drama but a reality that God is with us now this God had been lost throughout the throughout the years as it were he was not lost but the through the preaching of creeds and dogmas here this great God was smothered up by wet blankets that did not want the Holy Ghost moving in the church and here yet we see that even now we see us as critics rising and then the spirit of unity as it were has tried to rise up and bring all the truck the the World Council of Churches together you see God has never said in one place that we would be united as a church but we will be united in him and to think that that God is with us that that back there before he ever spoke that word it was a fault that he would create these things it was a thought and then it became a word and when that word was released those sayings that he had in his mind came into existence and to think that maybe maybe we put it to you like so that the children would understand it that God thought of a tree and God said let there be a tree and there appeared a tree who to think tonight that that Bob was to live on sound the inside of a little bitty boy by the name of Waylon we're a little bitty girl by the name of Al he heard a little bitty boy by the name of no ii think that that bob was syllable me inside of you young kids i want you to hear me loud and clear you ain't gotta wait to your teenager to get it you can get it right now you ain't gonna be a certain age but i believe that you can have the baptism of the holy ghost at 4 or 5 years old i believe that if you repent of your sins and a baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost then a certain age or a certain stipulation and they don't even matter how old your if you're 95 years old I believe that the Holy Ghost is for you and wants to be packed on the inside of your soul watch that God as he speaks those things into existence but here we are and the church says in Laodicea and we're watching that same Lord of creation work right amongst you Allah we're watching him as he said let there be light and the Bible said in Zechariah 14 and 7 that in the evening time it shall be light you see when God said let there be light he said let there be light it was once a word but once the light was there it was no longer ordered it was a reality and that which was spoken over thousands of years ago that in the evening time it should be light you and I are watching those things as it comes to pass and the Cubs of prophecy a rolling ride on time you an hour in the moment of prophecy don't miss these things but God the God of reality the god of the I am the God of the prophets is right here and there is all types of things of churches and and creeds and critics that are that are trying to cast more darkness you know that that they're the children of the night love darkness and you find that when somebody begins to speak when they begin to speak Eve will the Lord Jesus Christ you find what is only inside of their soul and that they love darkness and you see what they try to do is cast more darkness but I have found in life if you've got the little list of flashlights no matter how weak to the light is no matter how much the battery is on the inside if there's a light darkness has to leave and you may be a small Christian here today but I want you to know that there's more than an energizer bunny sitting here tonight to give you more power there's a Holy Ghost here that will set your soul flying and give you the light of the day the same Sun that rose in the East is the same one that's Ross that's setting in the West this is the evening time hallelujah no matter how dark it gets out there I want you to hear me no matter how dark it gets no matter how much they want to cast shadows no matter how dark it gets in Egypt are you delivering children yes we'll still headlight here go over in the book of Revelation Revelation chapter 1 and there we see John on the Isle of happiness and here in the revelation of Jesus Christ we are given a glimpse of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ here in Revelations 1 and 8 he says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end say the Lord which is which was and which is to come the Almighty you see in other words he said I'll be supreme in the first and I'll be supreme in the last you see if he was supreme in the first stage he has to be supreme in the last stage if he was supreme Paul he has to be supreme in the profit of this day are you with me Jesus was there standing with his disciples he was saying to them in Matthew chapter 16 that whom the men say that I the Son of Man am and they said that some say that there are larger and some say that thou art John the Baptist but Jesus don't really care what the rest of the world says he wants to know what you've got to say he wants to know what you got to say sister Jada he was understand he wants you he wants to know what you say here that he is Simon Peter answered and said that how art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus turned to him and said blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed this under thee but my father which is in heaven and he said upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it it shows to you and I that the gates of Hell will be against it but they will not prevail they will not overcome and Satan hates revelation but you and I love it there's power in Revelation and here we look that this is the revelation of who Guardians that's where he builds his church upon not upon himself but upon the revelation of who he is are you with me not upon Peter though his man his name may be stone but that is not where God built his church upon but he built it upon the foundation of the revelation of Jesus Christ and you can find that over in Revelation chapter three and eight and brother Branham would say that it's the lap over he said it's that step up from the next step and he said there in the lap o Reese and I can show it to you by the scripture that he said there in the closing out of the Philadelphia interchange and the lap over to the Laodicean Church age that Jesus said that I have set before you an open door and no man can shut it no man can shut it what is that open door is the revelation of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ What did he say to the First Church back there he said I am he that was which is and shall come I am the first and the last I am the Almighty he said it three different times he made himself deity to this first Church here before he went into the last church he said I've set before you an open door and if you want to see the revelation here it is where he would build his church and the only way that he could take his church his back to the revelation of what he is and what was the first thing that he reveals himself areas ask but the God of heaven that God is with you not a triune God but one God I know I'm gonna make halo upset but that's okay that's my job not a triune God but one God one God and he reveals himself that way in the first revelation and he speaks it four times in the first chapter so that there would be no mistake and the first thing that you've got to know is that Jesus is not a prophet Jesus is not a Junior God he is not a secondarily God He is God for the Bible said in Deuteronomy 6 and 4 here Orissa the Lord your God is one Lord Zechariah 14 and I and the Lord shall be king over all the earth in that day there shall be one Lord and his name one and Paul declared these things over in the book of Ephesians chapter four and verse four that there's one body one spirit even as he recalled in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who's above all through all and in you all that God is with you the God is not one like your finger if you see if you make God one like your finger you Jesus being his own daddy but he was God manifested in the flesh and John would say that the concept of God was expressed in Jesus that God is with you that God who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or pillar five that struck fear in the hearts of men this God whose hearts characteristics were made known only by revelation of words through the prophets now became Immanuel God with us declaring himself that word declare is taken from the Greek root which we often interpret as exegesis which means to thoroughly explain and make clear I know some of you want me to slow down but I only have one gear so stay with me that is what the living Lord Jesus did he brought God to you and I for he was God he revealed God to us with such perfect clarity who now we're getting somewhere we get into a spot that if you realize the principle revelation of the whole entire Bible was Jesus that Jesus is God that he is the supreme deity of Almighty God that Jesus is not a second God or a lesser God he's not the second person in the Trinity but he is God for the Bible said in Colossians 2 and 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily Jesus is the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld him as the only begotten of the Father that great I am that made himself known when he came down a mountain when Moses went up there to get the Ten Commandments from Almighty God and only Moses was allowed to go up on that mountain through sanctification and the Bible said that if any animal would touch that melton it had to be thrust through with a dart that God was unfolding himself to you and I so that he can be felt so that he could be touched that we might touch him whoa what's he doing he's trying he is claiming his Road trying to get into you and I trying to get in the man but will you let this God live on the inside of you come on somebody now I'm getting down with a rubber meets the road will you let this go the god of heavens live on the inside of you you see if you don't let him live there you will not overcome to overcome is to keep life in you and the Bible said that in Isaiah 54 and 5 that the maker is on husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and I Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called is he the god over your earth the god over this earth right here is he your God this was not another god this was not another angel this was not a lesser God this was God in flesh and Jesus said in John 5 and 43 that I am Tom in my father's name and you have received me not but to them not receive me come on somebody why did any son when he comes he comes in his father's name's there right and with Jesus and when the first time that Jesus is being spoke from the Angels tongues and here when he's speaking with Joseph over in the book of Matthew chapter 1 and he said that thou shalt call his name in Jesus and he shall save his people from his sense this is the name of the Father that God what's the live only inside of you that man child was not Jewish neither was he Gentile he was God manifested in the flesh the only one that could redeem you and I his blood saves us his blood heals us his blood washes us it's his blood that we stand upon - any promise that he made God promised to do it he came in his father's name and that is where God placed his name is in his son that's the only place that you can worship Him the only place that God will ever meet you it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is God's chosen place of worship you can look over in the Old Testament and God said that thou shalt not worship me in all these other gates but only in the gate that I choose to put my name where did he choose to put his name but only in his son Jesus Christ we worship in that name we praise in that name we preach in that name and there is power in that name hello somebody the God that created the moons and the stars and the Sun that God that created the rod that Moses would hold the God that created the rocks the stones that David would pick up and we would kill his your life that God wants to live on the inside of you that God's with you that God's with you and God is telling you that he is Emmanuel which is being interpreted God with us and I want to declare to you right now

past there is power in the name of Jesus but only in the name of Jesus Christ can these things be done it is not done in the name of the Pope nor in the name of the church but only in the name of Jesus Christ matter of fact he did not manifest himself as God the Savior in God el sharia he did not manifest himself as God the Savior in Jehovah Jireh nor jehova shamma the Lord is there but only in the name of Jehovah savior Joshua Jesus Christ they declare to you that he is your Savior I have just told you the most powerful name that has ever been spoken by the man of humanity this name has the power over cancer this name has the power over Crohn's disease this name has the power over tumors this name has the power over diabetes this name has the power of a sin this name not in any other name but the name of Jesus where the Bible said in acts 4:12 neither is there salvation in any other name given unto us but by the name of Jesus Christ Bible said in Isaiah 45 and 22 look unto me and be saved all the ends of the earth for I am God and there is none else that's why Satan is battling us like never before because there's the people on earth that is called by that name there are people on earth that's redeemed by that name there are people on earth that set free by that name there are people on earth that belief they believe if they pray in that name that they will watch strongholds come down they believe that if they speak in that name that they will watch mountains fall there's a people on earth right now that believe that these things are possible to them that

before if God can wrote tumors off a sister meter how much more will they do it right now and God could speak squirrels into existence what about watching sons kind of running back home I'm not preaching to you some far-off God is with us [Applause] stop discrediting yourself and stop deterring those things that are for you write the vision make it plain write the vision and make it plain that he that readeth may run with it that's your Bible the vision has been made plain for you and I brother William and what we're doing we're running with a message we're not running without a message we're running with a message we have the cane sword in hand [Applause] Oh hallelujah the greatest weapon that's given unto you is the power of prayer I don't want you to say I don't want you to think anything about this but I just want you to believe it but I want to say this to you that you're right on it on the other side of the mountain and all you got to do is climb to get up stop looking at all your circumstances stop looking at the mountain start looking to the God that created the mountain there is power in prayer and when you are praying you're not talking to a weak God you're not talking to a God that don't know what he's doing but I want you to know that you're talking to a God that ain't never lost the bat you're talking to a God that is a Lord of Hosts you're talking to a god that has won every single battle that's ever been you will not find one time in the scripture where God lost the battle to Satan but you will find over and over and over again when Satan lost the battle and that is exactly what he's going to do right now am i speaking to believers or what don't you be bashful don't you be apprehensive rise up and talk to the God of heaven [Applause] he's here he's here I'm not preaching to you something I don't know I'm preaching to something I'm preaching to you something that's living I'm preaching to you something that I know works I'm preaching you something that I have experienced first landed he's still here he's still declaring himself God he was a lamb slain for before the foundation of the world for lost sinners and his blood still saves and his power still heals that God's here that God is with us and that God's for us the Bible said in Psalms 86 and eighth among the gods there is none like unto thee O Lord neither are there any works like unto thee like unto thy works all nations whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee O Lord and shalt glorify thy name for thou are great and do us wondrous things thou art God alone teach me thy way O Lord and I will walk in that truth unite my heart to fear thy name I will praise thee O Lord my God with all my heart I will glorify thy name forevermore you know if we're gonna worship God we ought to worship God with an attitude I'm not talking about everywhere I got an attitude I'm better than you but I'm talking about worshiping with an attitude that the demons of hell that are holding you bound you start worshiping with that attitude that when you go to place it the great I am the strongholds of hail gain hold you no longer star wars happen with an attitude of a conquer as a as a warrior that you are going to take your Giants down God is with us and we will see miracles hallelujah you start to realize that that God's with us that that God of heaven will protect you that the God of heaven will fight your battles he will deliver us he will heal us he will save us he will change us he will wash us and one of these mornings he's gonna rapture you and I I'm not talking about a God I'm not talking about Christ in the manger but I'm talking about Christ in you the hope of glory you ain't got nothing to be scared of of going into the future David wasn't worried when he walked down into the valley and he realized that he was the only one there alone but he realized that there was a God that was with him he was not worried about it but he knew that the God that was with him when he saved him from the power of the line and the power of the bear would surely deliver him from the hand of the Philistine and you won't hear me quoting from king Saul too much but I'm going to quote something to you that I want you to do that this is a commission to you he said David go and the Lord be with thee little bride go go and the Lord be with you I'm gonna preach this until you believe it go in the Lord be with thee I'm gonna preach it till you believe it and when you believe it I want you to receive it and when you receive it I want you to shout about it and when you shout about it I want you to shout so much to the walls come down and when the walls come down I want you to testify to somebody else and let them testify to somebody else and it all started because I started preaching what the Bible said so what are we going to do we're going to believe what the Bible said there by his sights we are healed by his Spirit we are sealed David knew God was with him same God knew that God was with him Elijah knew that God was with him when you realize that the God of heaven is with you ain't no wonder crippled people get up and start walking like they never walked before ain't no wonder blind eyes come open when they realize that their creators here and then ain't no wonder that sons of God are manifested right before you well because the god of creation is here I'm gonna give you a few more scriptures and we're gonna close it down till tomorrow night God is with us can you echo that God is with us and they're surely going to burn out rise up enemies that come against you because when you start saying that you are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you now have a target on your back that every gun of hell is pointed at you the Bible said in Deuteronomy 7 and 21 that thou shall not be a frightened at them for the Lord thy God is among you a mighty God and terrible and the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee my little and little that thou man's not consume them at once I love how God blends everything out perfectly let's the beat's beast of the field not the beasts of the field tell you what it be Al and I wouldn't want to be in land the beach can't hardly stand then things I give him over to my brother-in-law Davie lest the beats the Beast get over it drew spit it out let the beasts of the field increase upon me that's why you love me don't you but the LORD thy God said deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed you see God knew he wasn't gonna give it to you all at one time but he was gonna let you conquer it little by little that the land would never take you in the beasts of the field would not overtake you and consume you like God said that you're going to destroy him all and verse 24 said then he shall deliver their kings into thine hands whoo I love it and thou shall destroy thy name from under heaven and there's so no man be able to stand before thee until thou hast destroyed them not only are going to do are you going to destroy the kings that are there that are proclaiming that this is their land but you're going to wipe their name off of the face of the earth not only that name but the name of every King under them the Kings sin you're going to destroy everything under him King fear kicked out King worry King unbelief you're going to destroy them why because God is with you God's with you you don't have to fear God's with you ah I just share this within and um I'll just close this evening Malo my little girl Ali is heading somewhere right there she been going around all week all I love kids still think myself one Katie told me when I turned 30 that I had to grow up I'm 32 now and I still ain't grew up words from a wise man but Ali's been going around all week and I I don't know how you teach your children but I teach my children if you get sick or anything comes up don't you start talking about that sickness you just start rebuking the devil you make all your children and and just worship that little bit of sickness but that's how I do things around my house you just don't start stop saying you're sick start saying you're he'll start rebuking that enemy that's afflict in your body because that's what it is it's an enemy but Ali's been going around all week long for about the last week and a half and I have no idea why she's been doing it because that not really that she's been sick but she's been going around saying I refute the devil and she was trying to say i rebuked the devil we all kind of chuckled about it you know and she's going around I refute the devil I refute the devlin and the other night she had herself a nosebleed about 3:30 in the morning I see what's up Erin she was just she said I refute the devil I refute the devil and you know I had some things kind of on my mind all week long and been heavily burdened by some things and just I can't I can't sleep these things are all my hearts and things that are very near to me and they're they're all my heart okay sleep I found out you can try to take on sleep medicine you won't do but God wants you praying for somebody you can pray for somebody so if I thought of your name this week if I thought of somebody's name over in China I was calling their name so God had me up for purposes this week and I was sitting there and I was praying and all of a sudden the Lord began to speak to me and I begin to think about those things that ally been doing I refute the devil I refute the devil we are talking about and didn't we sister Katie we kind of just chuck it about and God kind of just spoke to my heart there said that's exactly right I refute the devil I'm being a hillbilly hick redneck hi I don't know words unless I have to unless I have a dictionary where I could look them up so I began to think about this if God said that's exactly right I'm gonna go look this word up that word refute is to deny it is to disapprove and prove to be wrong here my little four-year-old girl that's getting ready to turn five had been walking around all week long preaching to me I refute the death I refute the devil I refute the devil I didn't have a clue what was going on but this little girl was going around packing the gospel of Jesus Christ going around saying I refute the devil I refute the devil and in 2020 if we're going to believe for miracles we're going to have to refute the devil he's going to tell us and we're not gonna make it but we're going to refute the devil we're going to prove him wrong come on samba we're going to prove the demons of hail that we're going to make it we're going to overcome we will see miracles we will seek science MA and we realize that God is with us so devil hear me I refute you in the name of Jesus Christ I deny the very power of Hell Satan you have come against us but I refute you in the name of Jesus Christ you are stripped of all of your power 2000 years ago and you have no legal authority to touch God's children whether I'll make that just perfect I refute the devil he can whisper in your ear just like he's going to he can tell you all kinds of things but do like my little daughter had taught me all week long but it took me hours and hours and hours in prayer to catch the revelation of what God was saying to me out of the mouth of a babe deny the devil prove him to be wrong so I set out in 2020 with a commission I am here to prove the devil wrong and here to prove God right let them use this let's go [Applause] Wow
