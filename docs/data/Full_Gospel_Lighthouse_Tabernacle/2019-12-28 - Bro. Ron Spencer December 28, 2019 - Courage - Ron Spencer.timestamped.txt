[6:20] word that we've been preparing for for
[6:23] now weeks with this subject Lord I even

[6:36] evening and Lord we welcome you here
[6:39] Lord come to our pew even now strengthen
[6:43] even those that will hear this service
[6:45] this afternoon touch them in a mighty
[6:48] way we pray that you do a supernatural
[6:51] work for us now we pray in Jesus
[6:54] Christ's name we ask you amen and amen
[6:56] and amen
[6:57] god bless you if you will turn with me
[6:59] to Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 1
[7:06] verse 5
[7:17] this is quite a transition between Moses
[7:22] and Joshua Joshua has left the scene or
[7:27] Moses has left the scene and Joshua has
[7:31] is now having to step in the realm as
[7:34] leader and and that's quite a quite and
[7:37] it's been used in a lot of different
[7:39] ways and I just want to look at this
[7:42] just for a moment you have it's a man
[7:46] there's some not any man a lion I like
[7:50] that statement there's so not any man
[7:53] I'd like for you to say it with me there
[7:56] shall not any man be able to stand
[8:00] before thee all the days of thy life for
[8:03] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[8:08] thee remember this is what God also
[8:10] taught brother branham I will not fail
[8:13] thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a
[8:18] good courage for under this people shalt
[8:21] thou divide for an inheritance the land
[8:24] which I swear unto their fathers to give
[8:26] them only be thou strong and very
[8:30] courageous that thou must observe to do
[8:33] all a quarter too according to all the
[8:36] law which Moses my servant commanded
[8:38] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[8:41] or to the left
[8:42] that thou mayst prosper whether so ever
[8:46] thou goest this book of the law shall
[8:49] not depart out of thy mouth but thou
[8:53] shalt meditate therein day and night
[8:56] that thou mayst observe to do according
[8:59] to all that is written therein for then
[9:04] shalt thou that make thy way prosperous
[9:07] and then shalt thou have good success
[9:11] notice these words God's going to remind
[9:13] them again have not I commanded thee be
[9:17] strong and of a good courage be not
[9:21] afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord
[9:25] thy God
[9:26] swifty weather so ever thou goest I'd
[9:30] like for us to read that verse again
[9:32] verse nine have not I commanded thee be
[9:36] strong and of a good courage be not
[9:39] afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[9:43] Lord thy God is with thee
[9:45] whether so ever thou goest you may be
[9:49] seated and may the Lord bless the
[9:51] reading his word this evening
[9:54] Deuteronomy chapter 31 in verse 8 I love
[10:01] this I love this verse and the Lord he
[10:06] it is that death go before thee he will
[10:13] be with thee he will not fail thee
[10:18] neither forsake thee fear not neither be
[10:23] dismayed quite a powerful scripture God
[10:27] already knows the way that you're going
[10:30] to go he's already in your tomorrow he's
[10:38] already in your next week you and I
[10:41] don't know what tomorrow holds are you
[10:47] with me
[10:47] but God's already there God is not
[10:53] surprised where the Nathanael of what's
[10:55] going on in your life he's not surprised
[10:59] at what's going on in our lives he is
[11:02] already there I need you meet a quote
[11:07] for that he is the same yesterday today
[11:12] and forever he is an I am God he has not
[11:19] diminished one little bit
[11:23] when he saves the worst sinner in the
[11:25] world
[11:26] that's not diminish his grace not when
[11:31] he heals there was a sickest person that
[11:34] it looks like it's totally impossible
[11:35] does not diminish his healing power in
[11:39] it that's enough to shout about let me
[11:44] just share some words with you
[11:47] I've been sick before but I made it I've
[11:53] been broke before but I made it I've
[11:58] been brokenhearted before but I made it
[12:01] I cried all night but I made it I've
[12:07] been betrayed but I made it
[12:10] I've been loud on but I made it
[12:14] I've been destitute but I made it I've
[12:18] been rejected but I made it whether you
[12:27] know it or not you have just done
[12:29] something very supernatural when you
[12:32] walked into this build and took your
[12:33] seat and sit down Satan has done
[12:37] everything he can to stop you in your
[12:39] life and you're still here hallelujah I
[12:45] don't you across this audience tonight
[12:47] go I'm still here I'm still here brother
[13:00] Graham quotes this must I be carried
[13:03] home to heaven on a flowery bed of these
[13:08] all of us fought to win the prize and
[13:12] sail through bloody seas I must fight if
[13:19] I must reign increase my courage Lord
[13:27] I sent this to some of you this week and
[13:31] I'll send it to brother Aaron Oglesby
[13:33] this week and his family I'd like to
[13:35] share this with you something that just
[13:38] seemed to to speak to my heart be still
[13:42] and know that I'm God
[13:43] I'm bigger than your problem I'm bigger
[13:49] than your circumstance I'm bigger than
[13:52] your situation this is not your battle
[13:58] so you don't have to handle this God
[14:02] will work it out all you have to do is
[14:10] be still and know that I am God I love
[14:16] that I love that don't you I'd like to
[14:24] preface this with tonight as we prepare
[14:26] as I as I begin to step into this sermon
[14:30] sometimes storms come and you can't see
[14:34] them coming the interesting thing with
[14:37] our Doppler radar and and the radar
[14:40] systems that we've got now for a weather
[14:42] we generally know a day or two in
[14:44] advance storms in the mid in the end the
[14:48] south and the Midwest the tornadoes they
[14:51] they sometimes pop up and give great
[14:54] problems and kill many but sometimes
[14:57] they can give them a warning just in
[14:59] advance that's a Christian sometimes you
[15:02] can feel it coming sometimes you can't
[15:05] feel it coming storms in your life come
[15:09] and let me just remind you sometimes we
[15:15] look at people that are great in the
[15:17] scriptures and think well how did they
[15:19] ever make it there were no halos over
[15:21] their heads
[15:23] there was no wings on nobody's back they
[15:26] were human beings just like you but they
[15:28] answered the challenge they was
[15:32] predestinated to stand the test Shadrach
[15:36] Meshach and Abednego were three brothers
[15:39] the gospel and the reason that their
[15:45] names roll off of our lips is because
[15:47] they had courage and they stood in the
[15:50] test of the storm they come their way
[15:54] are you with me we don't know anything
[15:57] about what kind of work that they did we
[15:59] don't know anything about their their
[16:01] grass families all we know is when the
[16:04] tests come they said we won't bend and
[16:08] we both bow and everybody else around
[16:11] them bend and bowed and it looked like
[16:13] the political thing to do and they were
[16:18] worshipping an idol that was made to
[16:23] look like the Prophet but they knew God
[16:29] said don't worship nobody but me are you
[16:37] with me so they was going to do and take
[16:40] what God said the threats came we'll
[16:47] make the furnace seven times hotter did
[16:50] that disturb them whatsoever courage
[16:54] came courage comes in a lot of forms
[17:01] courage comes in the heat of a battle
[17:06] courage comes for a doctor to look at
[17:09] your case and say I'm going to help you
[17:13] parents sometimes strikes you and you're
[17:15] in your heart to where when you've been
[17:18] given horrible news Craig's raise us up
[17:23] are you with me
[17:25] brother Ron but I've always be able to
[17:28] stand brother Brandon even look at his
[17:30] baby laying there the Flies are all over
[17:33] it it's dying it's getting ready to be
[17:36] put into its mother's arms and the devil
[17:39] test testing enemies ears ears telling
[17:42] that God don't love him
[17:44] brother branham even says that he was
[17:46] not ready to give up and then something
[17:49] on the inside of him let me just tell
[17:54] you tonight you would quit if you could
[17:58] there come spots that's overwhelming
[18:01] more than you can in your energies and
[18:05] in your fortitude and in your
[18:07] determination but God gives you courage
[18:10] in the moment Jobe would say and I'd say
[18:18] Jobe had more problems than any of us in
[18:20] this building but it was for an example
[18:24] finally he'd come to a spot though God's
[18:28] laymen though God's labor no matter what
[18:37] everybody else does to me though God's
[18:40] laymen get out trust him I'm preparing
[18:49] to go to brother brother towns brother
[18:52] Bissell's to to speak next weekend
[18:54] and look back a few years ago about 12
[18:58] years ago standing and they're meeting
[19:00] in 2007 I believe was the witness
[19:03] convention and I was standing in that
[19:06] meeting and I was asked to speak on
[19:08] Saturday night I believe it was and got
[19:14] a lay on my heart the passion of our
[19:16] revival and as I stood there God just
[19:20] kept laying it into my heart that devil
[19:23] can't touch you until he first gets
[19:28] permission from God and as I was dancing
[19:31] across the platform I said the devil
[19:34] can't touch a hair of my head until he
[19:38] gets permission from God
[19:40] [Applause]
[19:43] in less than four weeks time I'll be
[19:47] laying in a coma does it make me afraid
[19:53] to quote God now let me just say this
[20:00] seems the same text tonight he can't
[20:03] touch a hair in my head
[20:07] until he gets permission from my father
[20:10] my father knows tomorrow he knows when
[20:18] I'll go through tomorrow
[20:19] he knows what he'll go through next week
[20:21] he knows what you go through are you
[20:28] with me when I come to a pulpit to speak
[20:36] the sermon I realized that I'm speaking
[20:39] part of my life when they come to a
[20:43] pulpit I know God's got some things in
[20:45] his heart a few weeks ago you were
[20:49] giving a sermon don't worry
[20:53] you were given a sermon don't worry God
[20:58] had laid that on my heart and then
[21:00] brother Kelly couldn't come and so I
[21:03] stood in this pulpit and I preached a
[21:05] sermon on don't worry and then brother
[21:09] Jeff and sister Anna got a picture for
[21:12] me Jesus in the midst of the storm are
[21:18] you insulin and here I'm standing here
[21:20] preaching to you on courage how much
[21:24] more than we need to be told over and
[21:26] over again that we have God with us
[21:31] and if we've got got with us if we've
[21:39] got got with us come hell or high water
[21:45] having God with you is better than the
[21:47] president a dictator or any any army
[21:52] when you got caught with you you can't
[21:56] lose sometimes we walk into a doctor's
[22:12] office not not knowing what he's going
[22:14] to tell you brother harun I want to
[22:19] speak this to you now I want to say this
[22:23] to you regardless of what the doubt the
[22:25] doctor tells you whether it's some
[22:29] debilitating disease or some condition
[22:33] that seems phenomenal to where you can't
[22:36] handle God's already saw it are you with
[22:42] me no matter what the doctor tells you
[22:45] the Scriptures been given to us whose
[22:48] report whose report do you believe are
[22:57] you with me to not yes I've got an
[23:01] agenda for preaching this and I thought
[23:05] tonight I I would talk on faith for a
[23:07] little bomb but the RAM says just build
[23:11] up a Christian faith I found out that
[23:13] one of the greatest hindrance into the
[23:15] church as to death God today is that
[23:18] they're scared to death
[23:20] what are you scared about that's what
[23:24] I'm wondering if you'll just only
[23:27] realize who you are
[23:31] you don't know who you are you don't
[23:34] know who it is sitting next to you and
[23:37] you say oh yeah that's my neighbor I
[23:40] know I know him right well but he's a
[23:43] son of God adopted by Jesus Christ into
[23:49] the family
[23:50] that's a daughter of God sitting next to
[23:52] you and who are you if you're a
[24:01] Christian believer you're a son and
[24:04] daughter of God what he gets scared
[24:06] about know neither being scared
[24:10] as long as the devil can keep you scared
[24:12] that's all he wants to do
[24:14] he's got you right there in spiritual
[24:17] amnesia not knowing who you are there
[24:21] but knowing who you are
[24:24] produces faith Jesus had perfect faith
[24:30] cause he knew that he was a who he was
[24:33] the word perfect faith cast out all fear
[24:44] god is love and perfect love casts out
[24:49] all fear love and faith is the same
[24:52] thing love perfect love casts out all
[24:56] fear and it gives us faith Oh hallelujah
[25:02] Paul said that the word that came in
[25:05] power as well as as a voice the word
[25:09] preached actually demonstrated itself
[25:11] like a flaming cutting sword he went
[25:14] into the consciousness of men and like a
[25:16] surgeon's knife that cut out all the
[25:18] diseases and set captives free
[25:20] everywhere those early believers went
[25:23] they were preaching the gospel the word
[25:26] and God confirmed the word within
[25:28] science following the sick were healed
[25:31] devils were cast out they spoke with new
[25:35] tongues that was the word in action
[25:41] that word has never failed in the mouths
[25:45] of believing Christians I want to read
[25:47] that one more time the word has never
[25:49] failed in the mouths of believing
[25:52] Christians the word has never failed in
[25:56] the mouths of believing Christians can
[26:04] you quote that that last sentence I just
[26:06] gave to your neighbor just now while you
[26:08] was wondering about something else can
[26:10] you quote that last sentence I just gave
[26:12] you because I want you to get this
[26:18] tonight the word has never failed in the
[26:24] mouth a believe us now tell your
[26:29] neighbor again I want you to tell him
[26:36] I'm a believer even in Jesus's day even
[26:58] in Jesus's day they said if you'd had
[27:01] only been here my brother wouldn't have
[27:03] died but God already had control of
[27:08] tomorrow lasses had a dinner date with
[27:13] Jesus tomorrow
[27:17] John 12 tells us that God already had
[27:20] John 12 it was already written
[27:25] in God's mind yet today he said he's
[27:29] he's talking with Abraham and Jacob and
[27:32] Sarah and all of them in another
[27:33] dimension but when Jesus comes and their
[27:40] faith was already saying if you have
[27:41] always been here I breath awaiting the
[27:45] DAAD Jesus new tomorrow he's going to
[27:48] eat with me how are you
[28:03] the word has never failed in the mouths
[28:07] of believing Christians and in this last
[28:13] age it is here stronger and greater than
[28:17] ever in the true word Rock o little
[28:24] flock you lure minority hold on to the
[28:29] word fill your mouth with and your heart
[28:35] with it and someday God will give you
[28:39] the kingdom are you with me now huh
[28:44] First Samuel Chapter 17 in verse 4 I'm
[28:47] gonna read some of these things for you
[28:49] and forgive me for the length of it and
[28:50] there went out a champion out of the
[28:53] camp of the Philistines named Goliath of
[28:58] Gath whose height was six cubits and a
[29:05] span and it had a helmet of brass upon
[29:08] his head in his arm with a coat of mail
[29:10] and the weight of the coat was five
[29:12] thousand shekels of brass it did amazing
[29:16] that the devil wants you to think he's
[29:18] so big
[29:23] as a matter of fact he'll make sure that
[29:26] it's documented how big he is and how
[29:30] Mahankali is and how much his his a
[29:34] garments way and God already knows I've
[29:40] got a boy I've got a boy that's gonna
[29:46] fight you I don't know exactly what a
[29:52] slingshot weighs but it's got a long
[29:58] string on it and when he swirls that
[30:00] thing it makes kind of a singing noise
[30:01] that's what brother Graham said he said
[30:03] when he got the world and that thing is
[30:05] started making Michael sing the noise
[30:08] that's why singing in this building is
[30:10] so important
[30:15] [Music]
[30:20] come on church that anuya verse 8 and he
[30:36] stood and cried unto the armies of
[30:37] Israel said unto them why are you come
[30:40] out and sit in your battling armed array
[30:42] and not I for listening and you servants
[30:45] of Saul choose you a man and let him
[30:47] come down to me as long as David could
[30:51] not hear him let me say it as long as
[30:57] David could not hear him Goliath could
[30:59] have did that for years he's gonna stood
[31:05] there for years and held them at bay but
[31:08] as soon as David heard him David said
[31:22] who is that uncircumcised Felicity he's
[31:29] a boy we're not really really accurate
[31:34] with his age but he's a boy he's not a
[31:38] champion by their estimation but he's
[31:41] already had some incredible victories
[31:46] and before he goes to victories he goes
[31:48] and begins to talk to a backslidden soul
[31:51] who should have been the man that
[31:53] stepped out there but he didn't have the
[31:55] courage there's a major difference in a
[31:58] man that's got the courage and the man
[32:00] that don't I've got the courage in this
[32:04] day that keeps standing
[32:15] what this one failed and that one failed
[32:18] and this one failed and that one fell
[32:19] and this one's not here and that was not
[32:21] here don't matter
[32:23] don't matter don't matter to me none I'm
[32:27] still standing verse 40 says that he
[32:39] took a staff in his hand and he chose
[32:41] him five smooth stones now we know the
[32:44] story because we we've got history
[32:46] one was for Goliath and the rest was for
[32:52] his brothers so he wasn't going to be
[32:56] world in the stone just to be world in
[32:59] the stone one was the glass and four was
[33:04] for his brother house so don't pick up
[33:09] stones just to be picking up stones he
[33:16] wasn't God called us to be champions of
[33:24] laodicea
[33:27] and sometimes you got to pick up your
[33:29] stone you got to pick it up you got to
[33:33] pick it up it takes courage to go down
[33:36] to the brook and pick it up when there's
[33:40] nobody else walking with you let me just
[33:43] say this you he wasn't concerned about
[33:45] where they were gonna bury him he wasn't
[33:50] concerned about what they were going to
[33:52] put on his gravesite he wasn't concerned
[34:00] about none of that he was concerned
[34:03] about how I'm gonna carry his head back
[34:06] up on top of this hill
[34:17] it wasn't a sword plus the sling it was
[34:23] slang with rocks inside of it and when
[34:27] he be in the world that that wind begin
[34:31] to give him courage and he was listening
[34:33] to the Claridge and he knew in just a
[34:36] few moments while that man was laughing
[34:38] intimidating and making fun of him in a
[34:41] few minutes when I turn this loose
[34:43] you're gonna bring your last breath
[34:45] [Applause]
[34:59] big fella you have ate your last
[35:02] breakfast
[35:03] you have poacher you have put your armor
[35:06] on the last time the people that worship
[35:09] you and thought you were some great
[35:11] champion are not gonna think that after
[35:14] today - your last go ahead and tell your
[35:22] enemy that take dominion over you in the
[35:29] name of Jesus Christ not some dainty
[35:45] little oh god that just walks into a
[35:47] church

[36:37] me the other day that me and brother Tim
[36:38] Pruett make good team members because we
[36:40] really like to know how to fight well
[36:44] let me just say this you you don't want
[36:45] a preacher that's scared
[36:50] you don't want to preach of the scared
[36:53] Philip the devil right square in the
[36:55] face and kill him to go back where he
[36:58] came from
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:11] brother on you need one of those bands
[37:13] what would Jesus do well let me just
[37:15] quote Jesus here this spot then this is
[37:18] not my kingdom if they're lies my
[37:22] kingdom my servants would come and fight
[37:29] he was Latin Pilate knows if it wasn't
[37:34] for my father given you Authority you
[37:37] wouldn't touch a hair of my head but I'm
[37:42] on a mission Ron Spencer needs to be
[37:45] saved and you can't stop it

[37:58] mission hallelujah let me relax here for
[38:13] a minute the Lord is my light and my
[38:18] salvation Psalms 27 let's just get it
[38:22] let's just get it that's it to get to
[38:24] work right here whom shall I feel the
[38:33] Lord is the strength of my life shall I
[38:38] be afraid
[38:42] you guys ought to meet some of the most
[38:44] fierce people in on the planet the devil
[38:51] in his kingdom down there when he
[38:53] assigns one of you a bad day they ought
[38:58] to report back to old Lucifer himself
[39:00] and say please don't send me there run
[39:08] run that's way off a cater you hear
[39:10] other preachers say that but what about
[39:11] you
[39:12] what about believing that about yourself
[39:18] the great patriarch woke up one morning
[39:21] and the devil was standing at the bottom
[39:23] of his bed he just simply said oh it's
[39:27] you and rolled over and went back to
[39:32] sleep when the wicked even my enemies
[39:42] and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh
[39:44] they stumbled and failed and though a
[39:47] host should encamp against me my heart
[39:49] shall not feel the war should rise let
[39:52] me against me and this will I be
[39:53] confident one thing that I have desired
[39:56] of the Lord that I will seek after that
[39:58] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[40:00] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[40:02] of the Lord and to enquire and he's
[40:04] simple for in the time of trouble he
[40:07] shall hide me in his pavilion and the
[40:10] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[40:12] me and he shall set me up on a rock and
[40:14] now I'll show mine head be lifted up
[40:17] above mine enemies around about me
[40:19] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[40:21] sacrifices of joy
[40:23] I will sing yeah I will sing praises
[40:30] unto the Lord we stop there are many
[40:36] times but I want to carry that scripture
[40:38] on tonight here O Lord when I cry with
[40:40] my voice have mercy upon me and answer
[40:44] me when thou seekest my leave my face
[40:47] and my heart said unto thee thy face

[40:53] serving away in anger for thou has been
[40:56] my help

[47:27] get ready to preach to you and preach in
[47:30] Canada and preach whatever God tells me
[47:33] to go and preach it it's not dependent
[47:38] on somebody that they prayed all week
[47:40] long folding their arms and they got
[47:43] ready for church it takes courage to be
[47:46] a real Christian it's going to take
[47:59] courage to be in the rapture because
[48:04] everybody else is going to turn loose
[48:05] except for the bride it took courage to
[48:10] get inside of that Ark when nobody else
[48:14] was going and everybody was making fun
[48:21] it took Christ to stay in the ark when
[48:25] the Sun was still beaming down for day
[48:28] after day after day after day whether on
[48:34] are you sure this message is right I
[48:36] believe it was 100%
[48:50] Oh
[49:08] a few years ago I spoke in Switzerland
[49:17] what will I be remembered for as I came
[49:21] down through the middle aisle and I was
[49:23] preaching and God had laid on my heart
[49:24] that day to take part of it when brother
[49:29] Branham was standing there in Finland
[49:31] and he was looking around at all the
[49:33] same room he was looking and he and he
[49:36] walked away from the scene three times
[49:38] the angel kept told tell him to look at
[49:41] it people want to dispute that it's just
[49:48] real silly matter of fact it's stupid
[49:53] then he I'm gonna quote to you add a
[49:55] nice demon word you know why they do
[49:57] that cuz they stupid brother man said he
[50:02] walked up there and he said if this
[50:04] boy's not off of the ground in five
[50:06] minutes you called me a false prophet
[50:12] then brother Branham said the devil
[50:14] could line up every devil in hell he can
[50:20] line up the never devil in hell and he
[50:23] could not have stopped it and they
[50:29] remembers about the dido being here
[50:32] some of you couldn't understand brother
[50:35] gido but one of the testimonies he told
[50:37] and in that meeting was that the next
[50:40] meeting that brother Branham was that
[50:42] after that resurrection took place they
[50:47] didn't have cell phones then but word
[50:49] got ahead of what happened to that
[50:52] resurrected boy
[50:54] word got ahead to the next meeting and
[50:57] there was 12 rows of in
[51:00] wheelchairs that was set up in the front
[51:02] of the building before brother Branham
[51:06] even entered the pulpit he stepped
[51:11] through the door and took his hat off
[51:13] and all 12 rows
[51:16] shut up the devil that devil knows it's
[51:29] the truth in the same night brother
[51:36] Guido that is standing here preaching to
[51:38] us he tells us that when he went into
[51:41] Siberia he went there and he prayed for
[51:45] a little child that was looking for its
[51:46] mom and daddy to come back because some
[51:48] of them were war orphans and some of
[51:50] them had moms and dads and some of them
[51:52] but that place was filled and and
[51:56] brother guido began to pray for them
[51:57] that their father and their mother came
[51:59] back i'm preaching to you now and even
[52:04] then to pray for them that their mom and
[52:05] dad would come back and and they
[52:10] literally got upset with him because God
[52:15] so answered those prayers and then
[52:18] emptied that orphanage did the orphanage
[52:27] I find it interesting that brother
[52:32] guiteau's last service that he holds in
[52:38] Russia one of the girls from that
[52:42] orphanage is at the meeting and she said
[52:47] do you remember me
[52:49] how was that little girl you prayed for
[52:54] you know I take some things and it goes
[52:56] real deep to my heart
[52:58] that's one of the last meetings that he
[53:00] was in and God was just telling ghido
[53:02] you prayed for me as a little girl and
[53:05] mama
[53:08] come on church take courage Anna God's
[53:15] gonna give you a baby
[53:39] Sunday morning now I was in my office I
[53:44] was in my office there and I was milling
[53:47] around I'd sent by the Jeff some notes
[53:49] earlier that morning thank you for the
[53:53] for the gift and thank you all for the
[53:56] gifts that you gave men thank you for
[53:58] the gift and he send me a scripture back
[54:00] I don't know the time frame maybe you've
[54:04] got that somewhere or looked at up the
[54:06] difference but something stirred I was
[54:09] in my office while I was in my office I
[54:13] was I was there and I felt that come you
[54:17] know when he comes and in just a few
[54:22] moments I saw Anna coming down that
[54:28] aisle with a band in her hair and a
[54:32] brownish looking dress on and she had
[54:35] her hand on a baby and they're walking
[54:37] down there
[54:54] Miller on that takes some courage to
[54:57] speak something you can't see let me
[54:58] just say I can pray for it for years but
[55:01] once God shows it to it in a vision it
[55:04] tells me that God's got it on his mind
[55:07] [Applause]
[55:18] when I was looking at David he was in
[55:21] the hospital and had that thing around
[55:22] his neck and their doctor for telling me
[55:24] we can put him back together bones are
[55:27] grow back together but but he can't have
[55:30] children I was believing what God showed
[55:32] me but that little boy walking through
[55:35] the yard with his little finger out like
[55:38] that blond-haired blue-eyed and walking
[55:43] through the yard I was on the way how
[56:11] you know doing things for brother on
[56:14] they st. didn't start happening
[56:16] yesterday
[56:19] brother Harold my brother-in-law sitting
[56:21] right back there one morning I rolled up
[56:26] on a Tuesday morning I sit on the side
[56:28] of the bed and the Lord showed me his
[56:30] daddy he'd sing a song y'all have been
[56:34] down when Johnny run the pews we loved
[56:38] it we loved it wouldn't hurt my feelings
[56:40] I'd heard every night he was a celebrity
[56:45] in this area and God showed me him up
[56:53] strumming his guitar on a Sunday morning
[56:56] getting ready to sing and he was just
[56:59] standing there talking and sister Mary
[57:01] Betty sitting in the pew and I saw him
[57:06] follow it with a heart attack then I saw
[57:09] Mary Betty fall with a heart attack
[57:13] listen that's more than a premonition
[57:19] that's more than just a thought I
[57:24] wouldn't took brother Harold for dinners
[57:26] and I told him I said don't fear here
[57:29] God showed this to me he gonna take care
[57:33] of this situation that Sunday morning he
[57:39] was standing in the pulpit and he
[57:41] strumming his guitar and it happened and
[57:44] then sister Mary Betty had a heart that
[57:46] could it happened God raised him right
[57:50] back up
[58:01] thank God that we said under a prophet
[58:08] that would be honest and tell us those
[58:10] things that was more than a gift that
[58:14] was Christ himself operating in a man
[58:17] are you with me I'm thinking about this
[58:25] day today and I said this to brother
[58:27] Jason Jackson you know there's names
[58:34] that shake the kingdom of hell literally
[58:39] just just bring their name up it must
[58:42] cause tremors down in hell it must cost
[58:49] tremors in hell
[58:50] a man named Shamgar that only one
[58:54] scriptures wrote about Satan said 600
[58:58] demons to his house and Shamgar took one
[59:05] scripture that Melchizedek is telling
[59:08] Abraham thy seed shall possess the gates
[59:11] of their enemy and he killed six hundred
[59:15] demons don't you know that that made
[59:20] Satan's wall a man with that that a man
[59:26] named Samson took a dry jawbone of an
[59:30] ass a drug jaw bone of an ass and kill a
[59:37] thousand then listen if God is in it
[59:44] [Music]
[59:45] the devil can't catch a have your head
[59:50] until it gets for missing from my father
[59:53] I want to remind you that nothing can
[1:00:01] destroy you until God's finish with you
[1:00:12] here's what a sitting brother Jason
