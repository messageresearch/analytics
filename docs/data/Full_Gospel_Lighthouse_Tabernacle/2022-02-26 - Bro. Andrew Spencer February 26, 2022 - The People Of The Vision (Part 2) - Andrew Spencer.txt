careful to serve you and give you honor that is due your name in jesus name amen man if you have your bibles this evening would like to look over in the last book of the bible in revelations chapter 10 and verse one and then also to habakkuk chapter two hallelujah i'd like to carry on our i thought from last weekend on the people the people of the vision and i believe i believe i'm speaking to the people of the vision amen amen revelations chapter 10 and say amen when you have it this evening and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven and clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and is left on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven say unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and things therein and the earth and the things therein and the sea and the things which are therein and there should be time no longer that is the time of holding back of all of these things shall be no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god it should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings habit chapter 2 and verse 2. and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry so the vision has a voice and the vision will speak may god bless the reading of the word as we say i would like to speak to you on the people the people of the vision and we're certainly thankful to be living in the hour that we're living in in such a great and dreadful day but it's certainly a great day for each and every one of us that are sitting here and i believe that we're a very mature people that recognize that we're living in the hour where it takes a it takes the a people of the eagle anointing to be able to rise above and be able to look into the things of god and not just everybody can read the book of revelation and be able to understand or grasp what it is saying but we know that that god will do nothing except he reveals himself to his servants the prophets and we know that the bible would say in amos chapter 3 that that a lion hath roared and who will fear and that the lord god has spoken and who will who can but prophesy and to think that this is the hour when the very when the very king christ is speaking unto us and we recognize that that when a king the lion in the jungle when he begins to speak everything shuts up everything begins to shut up and everything everything begins to listen because it king has spoken and here we are living in this hour where we have watched not just a king's sword come down but the king's sword come down and the voice that you have been hearing is not the mind of a man it's not the voice of of humanity but it's a voice behind the voice and it's a vindicated voice and and we know that that voice will always come to the predestinated children of god those that that have that god thought of before the foundation of the world that voice will come to them it will speak to them and jesus said that no man can come to the father except he come except my father first draws him and when you watch that drawing begin to take place in a person's life you'll recognize that there is a predestinated seed that's being drawn to that word and brother branham would say in events made clear by prophecy he said it's the word joining with the word it can't do nothing else so you recognize the reason that you're here is that the word you are a part of that word and you're joining yourself to the word and to think that we're living in the greatest hour in the greatest time when when men when men are caught up in chaos of this world and just take a look at the last week of what what russia and ukraine has done and you begin to look at as men are running for fear men don't know what to do politics doesn't know what to do they're raising their head they're scratching their head and they're trying to find a solution but there's a people on earth that ain't nervous there's a people that have caught a prophet's vision and been able to sit there and recognize that they're in the safety net they're in the safety zone of god's refuge and we have run into that strong tower the name of the lord jesus christ and there's a people on the face of the earth today that believe what this messenger has said and i believe that god's got some people on earth today brother branham would say there'll be young men that'll come and grab this message and preach this message right on to the coming of the lord and i believe that even right now that there are men that are preaching this message and we're in the final days with a final message and things are getting ready to be wrapped up and the thing that you're so solid in is there's a vision that has given you insight to be able to look out into the future and know that you're safe to know that you're going to make it you're resting on the promises of almighty god you see those people with that with the people with that ego anointing upon them they're able to look into the blood-bound promises of god and see that this is their hour and you know that eagle we recognize that that god would liken his heritage unto eagles is that right and to think that tonight that god has called you an eagle and the bible said that where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered and to think that tonight that god has so likened you unto an eagle and we know that that eagle that it has it has such an ability that it can fly like no other bird it can if it gets in trouble it can fly straight for the sun and it has a special film that's able to go over its eyes and fly straight towards that ah straight towards that sun without it affecting its flight you see that bird is a very special built bird just like you are a very special built people that are built to be able to handle the very vision of god and to think that tonight that here we are a people that are sitting here and there's over 8 380 visions that we know of that are on tape that's not counting the ones that are off the tape but that's the ones that you'll hear on tape to think that's a night that you're sitting here with a vision with a vision you ain't lost your vision you're not going to perish because you have a vision and to think that tonight when brother branham would go back there in 1962 and he would preach sirs is this the sign of the end and you remember that brother branham was preaching from a vision that he had there in 1962 a few weeks before he spoke that sermon he is speaking about the experience he thought he was going to die he thought there was going to be a blast that take place he said i saw he said i saw five angels he said he said he said it could have been no less than five angels and it couldn't have been no more than seven angels that was coming that was coming and notice when brother branham gets out there three months later he is walking right into the vision and those angels meet him up there and told him to turn back east and go back there and preach those seven seals what was those angels doing he was loosing you from the creeds and darkness of this world to think that you would still be bound in the ideology of man if it had not been for the breaking of those seals but because you're a people of the vision because you're not a people of a closed book god sent an angel god sent an angel and a messenger to come and preach and loose the seven seals hallelujah hallelujah notice when john was on the isle of patmos he said in revelations 1 and 9 he said i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle of patmos that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ and brother burna picked that up over in the patmos vision in the church age books he said the series of visions of the revelation of the person of jesus christ was given to john while he was banished to the olipatmas he said this island is this island is 30 miles off the coast of asia minor in the aegean sea being rocky and festive with snakes and lizards and scorpions it had little to no commercial value and so it was used by the roman empire for a pineal colony where were housed that the most desperate criminals uh political prisoners and etc and to think that tonight that the omniscient god knows where you are and knows where to put you at to have you in a place of destiny and you think that you've been you've been put on a on a place or in a spot maybe in grotos virginia or in elkton and maybe you've been put there and you think why am i here john was put there because he was thought of as a witch oh my he was punished short sure he was being punished he was being punished for preaching and living the same message that you believe but god knows where to get you at so the vision can come forth [Music] hallelujah hallelujah he said now you you'll notice that john addressed himself to the christians as brother in tribulation it was at this time that the early church was going through great persecutions he said their religion was not only everywhere spoken everywhere spoken against but the people themselves were imprisoned and killed and john like the multitudes of other was now suffering imprisonment for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and when he when arrested they tried in vain to kill him by bullying him in oil for 24 hours the enraged and powerless officials then sentenced him to pacmus as a witch when god says i'm not done with you yet man can do everything they want to you but when god says i'm not done with you yet your vision your vision and your purpose will not be thwarted by humanity are you with me do you realize that you have a purpose and god has a plan george whitefield said we are more we are immortal until our work on earth is done so that means that hell can't kill you sickness can't destroy you diseases can come but diseases won't whip you you might have to go through hell in high water to get here where you're going but you're not going to be stopped and you're not going to be defeated the vision cannot be hindered he said but god was with him and he was spared to to leave the island and return to ephesus where he again continued as a pastor until the time of his death notice brother branham said the visions that john received covered a period of two years from 1895 through 96 they are the most remarkable of all visions in the word the entire book is set forth in symbols and therefore is the target of much criticism dispute however it does have the seal of god upon it that makes it authentic and of tremendous value to all who read it or listen to its sacred pages and to think that tonight that the very portion of scripture that holds all of your promises that testify where you are and where you're going is criticized by the rest of the world but it has a seal of god upon it and to think that john when john was up there and he he was caught away in the spirit uh he was gone and caught up in the spirit on the lord's day and that's this day and to think that he was living back there some 2000 years ago living and looking at your day and there he was john will see what john was seeing in vision you and i are now living out in reality that this vision has got to come to fulfillment that it was not other in any other age but it was in this hour that the lamb stood up in revelations chapter 5 and said who is worthy when the elders stood up said who is worthy to take this book and john stood there john stood there and he began to weep and he began to think about he looked all over the earth and nobody was found worthy he looked all over heaven and nobody was found worthy but there was an elder that spoke up and said don't weep john don't weep john for the lion or the tribe of judah hath prevailed and when he turned to look to him what did he see he saw the lamb of god what was jesus doing jesus was the antitype to boaz when boaz was going to redeem naomi's estate he went in there and he realized you got no ruth had to realize that if boaz doesn't overcome and if boaz doesn't prevail all of naomi's estate is lost i'm lost i'm without hope but the reason the reason that john was weeping is that nobody could take that book he saw his name on that book can you imagine seeing your name on the book and nobody's able to come and take and that's worthy enough to get you and redeem your rights and john was weeping because there was nobody in heaven found worthy oh hallelujah but there was one there was one and when john when john began to see the vision of the lamb the bible said that john began to say everything in heaven and everything in earth and everything beneath the earth and everything above heaven heard i saying blessings honor and glory and power be unto the name of the lamb what is that name that name is jesus i tell you every stronghold is thwarted by the name of jesus every demon has to bow at the name of jesus cancer is defeated in the name of jesus laodicea cannot stand against the name of jesus anxiety cannot stand in the presence of jesus [Applause] hallelujah that lamb has redeemed us back and brother branham said that redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by adam and eve and to think that tonight that you and i hold in our possession the abstract title deed that everything that adam lost everything that he forfeited you and i now hold in our possession he said what that ought to do to a born-again son and daughter of god the bible said in deuteronomy 29 and 29 the secret things belonging to the lord but the things which are revealed belong unto you it's not no longer closed up it's not no longer shut up you don't have to guess what it says let me preach just just a minute to our young people young people you don't have to worry you don't have to get caught up well i don't know the answers i don't understand revelations or i don't understand the seals that's your book young people that's your book young people when you read those seals that's not to another generation that's your generation this is your book it's got your name on it and the lamb thought that you were worth dying for the lamb thought that you were worth healing and you hold in your possession everything that adam lost everything that eve lost you now hold in your possession that's why satan's afraid of you that's why satan's so scared is you'll catch a vision and you'll recognize hey that's for me and my house [Applause] [Music] satan ain't afraid of your flesh he ain't afraid of your mind he ain't even afraid of your spirit but he's afraid of your soul catching a hold of what the vision that spoke about you what john was seeing in vision you are now in reality there's a people of the vision to think that john was standing there as a type of me going and taking the book not out of the hand of the earthly angel but out of the hand of the mighty angel he said this is your book eat this book become this book devour this book it'll be this book that'll get you in a rapture it'll be this book and i'll make you overcome pornography it'll make this book that'll make you overcome the diseases of laodicea let me say outside of this message there is no overcoming power because there is no restoration but under the message of malachi 4 there is an overcoming power hallelujah adam couldn't meet those requirements solomon couldn't meet those requirements daniel couldn't meet those requirements but there was one that was worthy when brother shannon couldn't do it when brother nathanael couldn't do it when brother ron couldn't do it the lamb stood up and said i'm worthy enough for him i'm worthy enough to redeem them [Applause] you may have been put in you may have been put in the pawn shop but i want you to know jesus walked in and paid the price for you hallelujah oh somebody said hallelujah the lamb took the book of title he took the book of redemption and he claimed you look at your neighbor say he claim me he claimed his rights to claim for me and to claim for you what he has redeemed us from so what are you fighting this thing for us so bad for trying to make yourself worthy enough trying to make yourself good enough we said well i'm too bad for this are you really well i'm too bad for this message i've heard people say they're too good for it i'm too bad to live this kind of message oh really you're real big bad dude huh if he can get a hold of peter if he can get a hold of paul oh what will it do when it gets a hold of a restored son and daughter of god what kind of people should we be when we recognize that the lamb has lifted us up where we wasn't unworthy where we weren't no good when we weren't worth account he said you're the people of the final age you're going to step right in ain't nothing going to make you step out you'll step right here and you'll start marching and walking right into the vision i'm one of them whoa brother branham said i got to sing in that old pentecostal song going down there why i was there there was a predestinated seed down there that was calling out where be my elijah oh i i tell you i was in a spot like that i was in a spot of chaos in a spot in a dying condition oh but there was a mama that said i have received a word from elijah i can put the token over my door your parents i want you to recognize that you have received a token put it over your house oh glory glory glory somebody somebody touched me what did he do he come down he redeemed you and he sent back the prevailing power of the holy ghost he give you an abstract title deed to the token life that you're a part of the seventh seal the rapture can't happen without you oh come on somebody that half an hour of silence that's you right there the rest of the world don't understand the rest of the world don't under what's going on but in a twinkling in a moment of a twinkling of an eye there's gonna be a people and those that are dead the ones that died in christ they shall be seen before us and in a moment take a moment and blink your eyes just for a minute just in that quick and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we shall be we shall be we shall be what changed you this same message that you're living out will be the message that raptures your body [Music] he's here he's right here in this room he's right here to perform miracles he's right here he's heard your prayer he heard what you went through this week he's heard what you battled this week he understands the fears and anxieties of the worlds of the world wars and things that are going on but i want you to recognize he's here he's here and it's not just an imaginary thing but he's here brother branham would say he said now he said maybe he said maybe we can't see him he's because our eyes are still physical yet he said but he could give us a vision and he could we could see that he was in the room he said but if you just let your mind loose just for a moment just let your mind loose just for a moment to recognize that the same one that spoke in the beginning let there be is standing on the pulpit he's here he's here he's here and he's here to declare that he's the same yesterday today and forever and what is it that you feel out there you feel that pulsation of the holy ghost you feel that charge that's moving on the inside of you it's that word that's magnetized to the word you think some people look at it and say why is that preacher preaching like he's preaching it's the burden of the word i look at it like it's wise and people pulling like they're pulling it's the burden of the word don't you get excited because i preach like this and don't you get excited because they poor like that you'll watch it's a tussle going on and we're bringing heaven down [Music] there's a people catching there's a people catching it they're catching it and they start saying i believe that amen i believe that and it brings this body what'd he send that down for so that you could prevail in this hour when you're not worthy enough when you're not good enough when you're bad enough he sent down the baptism of the holy ghost to give you overcoming power to overcome your self-will overcome yourself pride overcome and prevail over the enemy and jesus said about your age that he that overcometh he that overcometh will i grant to set with me and my throne where are you seating at tonight in heavenly places that's the believer's position ain't nobody else can sit there like a son and daughter of god you've got to know where you're standing at to be sitting with the father he sent this down in the baptism of the holy ghost and i want you to know what you got hell can't win hell can't be victorious hell cannot prevail hell cannot persuade you hell cannot destroy you satan is against everything that god stands for satan hates his word satan hates you satan hates a god's children satan hates revelation but we love it and what satan hates god loves satan hates you sister gabrielle but god loves you [Applause] satan hates this message but god loves this message hallelujah you cannot stop the vision write the vision and make it plain that he that readeth may run with you go to studying that out in the greek said write it so big write it so big sometimes sometimes i write my notes real little and nobody else can see what i've got wrote down there only me because i know what was there but if you'd come up here you couldn't necessarily read my notes because i've got them wrote in my language oh help me preach if you would take this notepad right here and try to read what i have wrote down you would need an interpreter it's not because i write in gibberish and it's not because i write maybe i do write in gibberish it's not because i write in cursive but i write like a doctor nobody can read what they're writing ain't that right but here when you go to studying out in the greek said write it so big that if somebody's running with it if somebody is running with this vision they can run and read it at the same time what are you doing you're running with a message and you got it in your hand and it's rolled out so well that it says andrew spencer it's gonna make it you're gonna make it we're running with a vision that's made plain before us the sick will be healed the death will begin to hear the blind will begin to see and these bodies these bodies oh they may be mortal but you have been quickened with the spirit of almighty god if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you he dwells in you if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you i'll dwell in you it's gonna it's gonna make alive your motorbodies to think you've got something on the inside of you that satan they never put it been able to put his hand on you got so much power on the inside of you that satan may never come in contact with brother branham said in a message one time he said he said when satan come up here and grabbed a hold of them live wires he said he shook he shook hell right back off when satan come in there and grabbed a hold of it i want you to know the same power that was in jesus is living in the people f5 bob's worst your success and your usefulness in the world is going to be measured by your confession and by the tenacity with which you hold fast the confession under all circumstances anybody can hold fast their profession right here anybody can hold past the profession well brother angel i got him on the other line he say he's my contact i mean he's going to go with me this week he's going to walk with me i can tell you i ain't got enough time to spend that time with every single one of you but i serve a god that's omniscient he's omnipresent he'll walk with you be in you but hold fast that confession under all circumstances and if there ever was a day to hold fast it's this day if there ever was a day to wave the banner of the holy ghost it's this day when zechariah would prophesy that there's one coming that there's one coming and he'll he'll ride on a coat to full of an ass what was brother branham saying he said when he cut that he said jesus was the answer to the prophet's prophecy i say again this day this scripture is fulfilled you are the answer to william branham's prophecy that she'll be without spot she'll be without wrinkle she won't be no pushover she's not some fly by night school girl she's robed in the righteousness of christ the holy ghost is the power on the inside of her i know there's anointed one at the end times but you are the true anointed one there's false ones out there but god is in his church and that gene seed of god cannot sin you are a different class of people you are of a divine nature when john said come up hither he's talking about you when brother random would talk about two worlds he's talking about you and god is so built to people who are built to pass the test and when laodicea cannot overcome and they cannot win you can when the rest of the world is in chaos you're in victory when hell is upset you're glad all hell can be against you but all heaven is behind you i thought i felt somebody looking over my shoulder yeah you do you got somebody that's watching over you our young our young kids used to sing that song angels are watching over me those angels don't leave you when you when you grow up out out of the age of accountability those angels are still there i don't want you to know that the god of angel armies is fighting your battles that is still on your side if it had not been for the lord who was on our side where would we be at but because we have met the same one that joshua met there in joshua chapter five he said who are you he said i'm a captain of the lord's host what was he saying i am the god of angel armies and i'm watching over my people when you go down to jericho i got an army already down there you cannot see it and you may not be able maybe to feel the brush of angel's wings but there's angels sitting all around this building david said in psalms 84 and 11 that the lord god is a son and a shield the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly next verse oh lord of hosts oh lord of hosts do you realize that every time that you read the lord of hosts that it is talking about angels that he is the lord that is the host of angel armies bless it is anybody in here blessed this evening keep your hands up blessed is the man that trusteth in me do you realize that you're blessed this evening if you trust in him isaiah would said i will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee blessed i'm blessed when i come here i'm blessed when i go out i'm blessed when i'm above i'm blessed when i'm beneath oh blessed is he that believes that this is him that has come in this hour this ain't just some mortal man's message this ain't some kentucky backwood preacher message this is a message from glory i want you to realize that there's angels sitting around you we've talked about bumping into angels when you go to worship and maybe you don't understand why you worship but you all of a sudden shout out hallelujah it's because you begin to bump into an angel you think why in the world i i know that i know that this is real criticized right now and i don't know why in the world it is but it is such a it's such an attack on worship it's such an attack on praise in the hour that we're living in when men ought to be praising god and when men ought to be worshipping god but brother barnum said that when you all of a sudden you start worshiping you bumped into an angel oh come on somebody i got to reading today over in mark chapter 13 and when jesus was talking about his coming he said and he will come on the go he will come in the clouds brother branham said he said he's not talking about some white thunderhead up there he's talking about he's coming in a cloud of witnesses he's coming in a cloud of angels the same ones that have protected you the same ones that have watched over you the same ones that you bumped into will be the same ones that come with christ when your body is changed can you imagine that one angel that watched over top of jerry braden all of his life watched over him made sure he was taken care of make sure he didn't get sickened as a baby make sure he didn't get a dreadful disease it'll be that same angel that's protected you all of your days that said hey something's about to take place papa god just called me back home that same one that watched you brother jeffrey will be the same one that watches you change your mortal body into immortality [Music] hallelujah there was an angel that was watching over you that made sure you came to this message when you wanted to walk away when you tried to give up there was an angel that put his hand on the door and said you're not gonna kill yourself you're not gonna destroy your life you're born with a destiny if it had not been for jesus if it had not been for jesus we got some more thomas eating we know that abraham had had two sons which are symbolic to law and grace is that is that right and and it's it's for for there are two covenants and one of them is according to mount sinai but the other one which which melsania which gives birth to bondage but the other one corresponds to christ in his coming and paul would grab it over in galatians and he would say that that brethren we're not children of the bonds woman but of the free and we go in in galatians again the next chapter and he would say stand fast therefore in the liberty where christ has made us free and do not be entangled again with the yoke of bondage so do you realize do you realize that you are not of the bonds woman you're not a type of the slave you're a type of the free woman you're a type you're not a type of hagar you're a type of sarah you're a type of the free woman that it was promised you that you're gonna have a child so paul says you can stand fast therefore in the liberty where christ has made you free so let me put it into your language you are a free son and daughter of god that you're free to operate like a son you're free to cast satan down you're free to have full victory you're free to worship you're free to pure worship you're free you're free to pre-praise and jesus said that whom the son is set free we got any slaves sitting here tonight slave to captivity slave to fear slave to anxiety i'm gonna always live with this all right i'm gonna preach through some slaves just for a moment you're not enslaved by bonds of chains that god has put on you you're enslaved by your own mind johnny crow you can go fly you are not bound you are not bound by the chains of almighty god you are bound with things of your own mind because christ has already set you free i want you to know there were some big boys one day that climbed on top of a hill and they shot it down from the top of that hill they knew that when the sun was rising that they were free because there was a president that signed a proclamation that they could go free i want you to turn your eyes towards calvary my big brother climbed the highest hill and said you can go free you don't have to live with anxiety you don't have to live with depression you don't have to live with the love spirit for whom the son is set free is free indeed and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty i'm like patrick henry give me liberty or give me death give me the liberty of the spirit don't hold me back let me worship let me praise i'm not going to let no devil steal me from my worship and i ain't going to let no devil try to steal any son and daughter of god away from god as long as i'm here i'm going to preach the gods for you charity still gives the holy ghost he's still in the keeping power he's not finished with you yet god's got big plans for you not one day longer you're going to live in that prison house not one day longer you're gonna sit there bound up by your chains of your ideas you're gonna walk out of there our prophet told us that we had checkbook authority he told us that we had checkbook authority and he said when you sign your name when you sign it out and you cash it in and you send it up to the bank in heaven it's just like jesus would say it well we happen to be message believers around here and i happen to take what brother branham said literally so i started writing out some checks i started writing now some checks i want you to know i ain't ever had one check bounce i never had one chex come back and say there's insufficient funds and on this check it says complete healing for ron spencer and he ain't bounced yet i got some checks in my other bibles that i got back home that had the name of gabriel spencer on it the name of malachi spencer the name of charity spencer hallelujah i got chats wrote out what about you i know god is able because god is faithful god ain't letting me down and god ain't gonna let me up write it out cash it he's still in the healing business he's still in the miracle working business you have the authority as an adopted son of god stand in your position and say house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ [Applause] and i heard a rumble and i heard a rattling what was it it was a prophet said house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ you can sit there in your depression all you want to you can get upset and say i'm enslaved to all kinds of fear you don't know like i know what i'm going through take a look around we're all in laodicea but we ain't off layout seal move me i ain't gonna try to move you because i ain't preaching the losers i'm preaching the winners [Music] impress me i ain't here to impress you if he really makes me clap y'all know he's done something tonight guess what you're gonna sit there right there and your sorry stinking attitude and miss the rapture [Applause] i won't be like that widow i ain't got much hey some other people's got a whole lot more than me but i ain't got much but what i get i give it to the house of the lord well glory glory glory well i ain't got a whole lot but i do have a voice i don't have a whole lot but i do have some energy i don't have a whole lot but i do got hands i ain't got a whole lot but i do got some feet what will you do with what you've been given [Applause] i'm a son of god i'm a son of god i'm a son of god i am god's son i am robed with the holy ghost with a holy boldness that can cast satan out and go before the throne at any time i am equipped i am empowered and given authority as an adopted son of god having full status as his offspring and fully authorized to use the name of jesus for any need at any time we believe because we are believers we have been trained for moments like this this is not a drill this is a real battle and we will win i am a part of the fellowship of the unashamed i have the holy spirit's power i have stepped over the line the decision has been made i am a disciple of jesus christ i won't look back let up slow down back away or be still my past is redeemed my present makes sense my future is secure i ain't done yet because of my breath what a time to say it i am finished and done with low living sight walking smooth need colorless dreams tame visions world talking cheap giving and dwarf ghosts i no longer need preeminence prosperity position promotions plotted your popularity i don't have to be right i don't have to be first i don't have to be tops i don't have to be recognized i don't have to be praised regarded or rewarded i live by faith i lean in his presence i walk by patience i am uplifted by prayer and labor and labor by power my face my face let me get it i got one i face my face is set my gate is fast my goal is heaven my road is narrow my way is rough does it sound like a bunch of chickens walking on this road my companions are few but my god is reliable and my mission is clear i cannot be bought compromised detoured lured away turned back deluded or delayed i will not flinch in the face of sacrifice hesitate in the presence of the adversary negotiator at the table of the enemy i will not pander at the pool of popularity or meander in the maze of mediocrity i won't give up shut up let up until i've stayed up stored up prayed up paid up and preached up for the cause of christ i am a disciple of jesus i must go until he comes give until i drop preach until all i know and work until he stops me and when he comes for his own he will have no problem recognizing me my banner will still be clear that i am a disciple of jesus when jesus comes for me he won't have no problem recognizing me it's that scarred one that fault in the battle for my prodigals it's that scarred wood that stood there and said he's the lord our god that healeth all of our diseases i am a disciple i don't know if you're keeping up with anything that's going on in the world not saying you have to all you need to be doing is looking up but putin putin made a a remark that he was going he was going after finland and he was going after sweden that he wasn't just going to stop of ukraine so finland's ambassador said today he said we're not in a position that we will get scared because of one statement one statement we're not in a position to get scared by one statement he went on to say we have one of the best armies in all of europe i'll tell you what that's a man right there that's a man it's putin he's a savage he's anointed for his job we're praying for the people of god and for those those innocent souls over there man was not made to destroy one another but demons have got in and started working amongst people and its nations at war its demons at war but i began to think about this man that could stand there with that kind of tenacity and say we're not in a position to get scared because of one statement but people get backed off of the promises of god because they say because satan says you're not good enough he says you're not strong enough says you'll never make it i want to whisper back to the devil we're not in a position to get staring scared because of one statement we got the best army that's ever been on the face of the earth it's the army of the most high god he never lost a battle and he ain't planning on losing one he's undefeated he's unconquered he's going to remain that for all of eternity i got the best army on my side i'm better guarded than all of russia all of ukraine and all of the united states of america i got the host of the army with me on my side oh somebody giving praise in the house of god hallelujah you didn't sign up to get in this family you didn't sign up you were born into this family you got heirs as a child of god [Applause] uh give me a moment i know good and well that if my mom and daddy could have dreamed up what kind of boy they was going to have they probably wouldn't have dreamed up somebody like me maybe in my later years but i'd say that if if my parents could have a vision what am i 34 years old if my parents could have had a vision 35 years ago man we want our visions to be perfect don't we jeff go ahead work on that vision man get that thing right i want it this way lord go ahead he said ask and you shall receive knock and it shall be open keep on asking but i'd say that if my mom and daddy could well if they could ask i could have declared what this vision was going to look like maybe in my mind they would ask for somebody like this not like this they'd ask for somebody that would maybe had an intelligent mind maybe maybe somebody definitely don't have that maybe that somebody would go somewhere and be able to do something with their life and maybe necessarily wouldn't have red hair and it would transcend down into the brain i told mom the other day that the reason my my red hair was so red when i was younger is because she beat the blood out of my rear end all the way up into my head she wouldn't ask for somebody that come with uh with that kind of tenacity in their mind and all kinds of things and making up all kinds of games and throwing mud pies at the house and creating all kinds of chaos and making up bombs and everything else blowing up fences and turning over four-wheelers every time they wanted to they wouldn't ask for somebody like that they would have dreamed of somebody in a male body with the sweet loving atmosphere of a girl named whitney drew why can't you be like your sister loving and caring she never gives us one problem that's cause i don't tell on her well you ought to be mad but god so seen me he knew i make up he knew how i'd be built he knew i'd have a temper that needed to be calmed down he knew i had a short fuse so he turned that around for his good so he took my makeup and started blending his word with my makeup i still got a short fuse [Music] you mess with one of god's children and i want you to know you ain't got all hell to deal with you got all of heaven to deal with you mess with one of four gospel children you mess with one of our sheep around here and you watch what'll happen god put some pastors in the pulpit that weren't some wishy-washy but men that had backbones had a tenacity that would stand up and fight for you when nobody else would fight for you when you didn't even care about yourself when he didn't have no hope about yourself but god put some pastors in place that believed in hope against hope but he made you just the way he wanted you he said he brought this one of that one to this one of that one until he got exactly what he wanted i'd say god's looking at the vision and the vision is speaking that's my bride that's my wife you can't be separated from the groom [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he knew exactly what you needed brother nathaniel he placed things on the inside of you that he couldn't place on the inside of anybody else [Laughter] don't mess with him spiritually or naturally god put something on the inside of him that if you mess with one of his pastors get that guy back here that bad guy back here at that back door you mess with one of these children sitting in here you let some person come in here possess with a demon it won't be heavenly battles no more that you worried about being natural battles you let somebody walk in here there's a shepherd watching over this place you let some gnome school walk in here and tell he think he's going to terrorize this church we got men in position to take care of whatever needs to be taken care of if you need to be patted carried out put a pacifier in we don't put pacifiers in and we don't clean diapers but i tell you what we will do we'll tell you how to win and we'll tell you how to overcome but if you come in here if the devil gets a bright idea to walk in here and says he's going to disrupt this service god's got men in place the devil tried it one time and those men busted out that door they didn't know which one was coming good bad or ugly busted out the door and the demons started running for cover but god's put something on the inside of you that only the vision knows i'm not nowhere near done but what i got once more but what god's put on the inside of you is overcoming power and you're going to say exactly what he says you're going to speak what he has spoken he put something on the inside of you as a child of god that cannot be separated cannot be pulled apart you watch that seed as it goes down into the ground in springtime and you watch as that summer's sun comes up on it if you put oil on that seed it's going to kill it but if you put water there good nutrient water rain water from heaven all of a sudden that summer sun will come and start pulling up start pulling up everything that's laying on the inside of it we knew we'd have harvest because we planted something we knew we knew this was coming to this church we knew what was coming because we knew what was sowed god knows what's coming because he knows what he sowed and when he starts shining that s-o-n down on top he starts pulling out all of that beauty at first when he started to come up you couldn't handle you couldn't handle that hot presence so he covered you he shaded you and he started pulling out all that beauty you know sometimes depending on the type of seed it is it takes years years for it to ever to manifest i know that there's one seed i believe it's a chinese bamboo that it's one seed you have to water it every year every day for five years and you never see it for five years you never see it but a faithful gardener knows what he's planted and he waters it and he waters it and he waters it and he waters it and on that fifth year it shoots up i believe to over a hundred feet because he knew what he watered i want you to know that god knows what he's watered and he knows what's going to be produced come stand with us this evening give the lord praise in the house of god aren't you thankful that he's in charge of the garden he's got a vision of what you're going to look like i'm thankful that we can actually talk about gardening i'm tired of winter i got real sick of seeing snow every weekend i thought my lord this is the worst it's ever been we've missed church what three three times three or four times because of snow you go back and you read the same thing last year maybe the year before that but man when it's hitting right there man i don't know how much more i can handle this but as spring starts rolling around you start to see all those robins out in the out in the field spring's coming you're watching life that's been hidden throughout the winter start to come to life because god's the one that wanted it and he's the one that'll bring it up and you've been sitting here watering this word with your praise and it will carry you all the way to the coming of the lord give the lord one more hand clapper please victory in jesus my savior forever when he stopped me and he brought me with his redeeming blood is [Music] the victory of jesus my savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming victory the cleansing
