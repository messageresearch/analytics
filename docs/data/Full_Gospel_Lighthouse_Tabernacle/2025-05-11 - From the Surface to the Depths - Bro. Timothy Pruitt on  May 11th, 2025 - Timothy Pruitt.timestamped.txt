[18:19] prayer. Dear gracious kind heavenly
[18:21] father, Lord, we bow humbly before you
[18:23] in prayer. Lord, we lift up your name,
[18:26] Father. Lord, a name that is above every
[18:28] name. A name that every knee shall bow
[18:31] and every tongue shall confess that you
[18:34] are Lord. But Father, we're going to
[18:35] confess that right now. We're going to
[18:37] bow to you right now, Lord. Lord, we
[18:40] know that you're Lord of all
[18:41] circumstances, oh God. You're Lord of
[18:44] our lives, Lord. We don't just want you
[18:46] as our savior to save us, to save us
[18:48] from hell, but Lord, we want you as our
[18:50] Lord and Savior. Lead us and guide us,
[18:53] Lord. This life is so full of testings
[18:55] and trials and tribulations. It's all
[18:59] part of life because, Father, you're
[19:01] after character. You're after something,
[19:03] Lord Jesus. The Peter would look and say
[19:05] that the trials of our faith is worth
[19:07] more to us than precious gold. Because
[19:10] the gold and the monetary things of life
[19:13] have an end, but oh God, the character
[19:15] that comes out of our trials. May you
[19:17] help us, Lord, to look at our trials a
[19:20] little different, Lord, and just give us
[19:21] a different
[19:22] perspective, Lord, to just walk in
[19:25] faith, oh God, and know that you're
[19:26] greater than everything we come
[19:28] against. And Lord, there were trials,
[19:31] Father. Lord, prayer requests from
[19:32] trials that was read this morning and
[19:34] hands that were slipped up to you, a God
[19:36] that knows all things. We just ask, oh
[19:39] God, that in the name of Jesus Christ
[19:41] that you brood over every single prayer
[19:44] request, be with each one, Lord, those
[19:46] that are due for surgeries, Lord, and
[19:48] doctor appointments and those that may
[19:50] be beyond doctor's reach and human care.
[19:53] We just pray, oh God, that may the great
[19:55] physicians step into the room and step
[19:57] into their lives.
[19:59] Pray that you give them a divine touch.
[20:02] Grant it, Lord. We ask you forgive us of
[20:04] our sins. Lord, if there's anyone here,
[20:06] Lord God, in this in this sanctuary that
[20:09] don't know you, Lord, may they not leave
[20:11] not knowing you. Lord, when your
[20:14] presence comes down, Lord, and your word
[20:15] comes forth, you make yourself known and
[20:18] available each and every
[20:20] service. Lord, may a hand of faith reach
[20:23] out, Lord, and grab a hold of you, Lord,
[20:25] and they'll never be the same. Lord, we
[20:28] just pray you draw us closer to
[20:30] you, Father, this morning, we ask a
[20:32] special blessing on our mothers, Lord,
[20:34] they'd be even called by the prophet of
[20:36] God, the fifth
[20:37] gospel. Many times out of sight, Lord,
[20:40] and many times just preaching that fifth
[20:43] gospel, Lord, to the children in their
[20:44] homes. We just pray special blessings
[20:46] upon them. Strengthen them, Lord. And we
[20:48] thank you, Lord, when the enemy is
[20:49] attacking motherhood like never before.
[20:52] what real women are. We have real ladies
[20:56] of God, oh God, that stand in their
[20:57] place and in their position,
[20:59] faithful. You will not forget them. But
[21:01] Lord, you'll do more than that. Lord,
[21:03] you'll bless them in a special way.
[21:05] Commit this service into your hands and
[21:07] pray for Brother Timothy as he brings
[21:08] forth the word. Bless them, Lord, now
[21:10] and just speak to our hearts. Change our
[21:12] lives, Father. Lord, we pray that soon
[21:15] you change our bodies. We love you. We
[21:16] thank you. We know you will in Jesus
[21:18] Christ's name. Amen.
[21:24] Amen. This time we're going to receive
[21:26] this morning's offering. You give as

[32:25] believe that all
[32:29] things are possible.
[32:34] Lord,
[32:36] I
[32:39] believe. Oh
[32:42] Lord, I
[32:46] believe. Oh
[32:49] Lord, I
[32:53] believe that all
[32:56] things are
[33:00] possible. For Lord, I
[33:04] believe. Just make that personal now and
[33:06] sing it
[33:09] again. Oh
[33:12] Lord, I
[33:16] believe. Oh
[33:19] Lord, I
[33:22] believe that all
[33:26] things are possible.
[33:31] Lord,
[33:33] I
[33:36] believe. Oh
[33:39] Lord, I
[33:43] believe. Oh
[33:46] Lord, I

[33:53] things are possible.
[33:58] Oh Lord,
[34:00] I
[34:03] [Music]
[34:05] believe we're standing on the
[34:09] promise. It's the foundation of your
[34:12] [Music]
[34:14] word where everyone is
[34:17] here who believes on you, Lord.
[34:24] I'm leaning on your
[34:26] [Music]
[34:28] power. You'll do what can't be
[34:33] done. Either now or
[34:37] forever. I know it's going to come.
[34:45] [Music]
[34:53] [Applause]
[34:58] Hallelujah.
[34:59] Hallelujah. How many believers do we
[35:02] have in the house of the Lord this
[35:05] morning? Glory to God. Thank you,
[35:08] brother Tim. What a powerful, powerful
[35:13] song, my goodness. What a
[35:16] song. The Lord, the angel of the Lord
[35:19] comes near. the prophet taught us when
[35:21] those words are sung from a believer's
[35:24] heart. My happy mother's day. God bless
[35:29] you mothers. We certainly respect and
[35:31] honor you today and want to just wish
[35:33] you a very happy Mother's Day to all
[35:35] that are with us and all that have maybe
[35:38] gone gone on uh beon be on the veil of
[35:42] tears. We realize that their prayers are
[35:44] still being made manifest even in this
[35:46] room. and those that aren't mothers yet.
[35:49] We know that we have many that are
[35:50] expecting to be mothers. And we just
[35:52] want to say God bless you. And this
[35:54] message speaks very uh great volumes
[35:56] about mothers. And many would think
[35:58] about our prophet that he was a woman
[36:00] hater, but he spoke very highly of
[36:03] women, mothers and ladies of grace that
[36:06] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now,
[36:08] he didn't say too much about the ones
[36:10] that pretended like they got the Holy
[36:11] Ghost and and tried to act like a woman,
[36:14] but he really respected he really
[36:16] respected the mother and her gift that
[36:18] she had. Brother Brandon would say over
[36:20] and over again that she is the fifth
[36:22] gospel. We had Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[36:24] John. He said, "But we have mother.
[36:26] She's the very first one that begins to
[36:28] teach and guide them." And I was reading
[36:30] this morning and brother Brandham said
[36:32] this in the invasion of the United
[36:34] States. And brother Brandham says some
[36:35] very powerful statements about mothers
[36:37] in that subject. And you go and study it
[36:41] out and you'll begin to hear brother
[36:42] Brandham. He says he said now to you
[36:44] little mothers here this morning that's
[36:46] been real mothers. I know there's many
[36:48] of you and I think every one of you let
[36:50] me tell you something. God bless you.
[36:51] You're the fifth fifth gospel. He said
[36:54] remember when Moses was a little boy. It
[36:56] was a mother who gave him instruction.
[36:59] It was a godly mother who took little
[37:01] Moses on her knees and said, "Moses,"
[37:03] and taught him all. He She was his
[37:06] teacher under Pharaoh and said, "Now
[37:08] these things said, Moses, someday you're
[37:10] going to deliver the children of Israel.
[37:12] You're the boy that's called. Keep
[37:14] yourself pure, unspotted from the world,
[37:17] for you're the one. You are the one." He
[37:20] said, "There's no other place we do know
[37:23] where he went to any seminary or any
[37:25] teaching at all that he ever got. He
[37:27] stayed right in Pharaoh's palace, which
[37:29] was a heathen. But his mother taught
[37:31] him. That's a real mother. She taught
[37:34] him the precepts of the Lord. She told
[37:37] him how he must be holy. She told him
[37:39] how we must live and how what God must
[37:42] do, what who what God would do for him.
[37:46] And it stuck with Moses all the days of
[37:49] his life. And any good, true, loyal
[37:51] mother that'll take her little babies
[37:54] instead of send them to picture shows
[37:56] and dances and so forth like that,
[37:58] she'll put them on her lap and teach
[38:00] them about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:02] Brother Brandon would say over and over
[38:04] again, he said the spirit of the United
[38:06] States, he said the backbone of it is
[38:08] our motherhood. He said the United
[38:10] States was broke when they broke
[38:13] motherhood.
[38:14] We just want to honor our sisters and
[38:16] say and we just want to give you a hand
[38:18] today and say God bless you mothers.
[38:21] Amen. Amen. God richly bless you. We
[38:24] love you.
[38:28] Amen.
[38:32] [Applause]
[38:34] Amen. We have we have something for our
[38:37] our mothers uh at the end of the service
[38:39] today. don't leave and get it now, but
[38:40] at the end of the service, we have
[38:42] something for for all of our mothers
[38:44] there. And uh we just want to we cannot
[38:46] say it enough that we appreciate you. I
[38:48] appreciate the the women in my life, the
[38:51] my mom and my grandma and my teenie and
[38:54] my mother-in-law, my sister Debbie. And
[38:56] I just tell you, I' I've been blessed to
[38:58] have some godly figures in my life. And
[39:00] I know that you feel the same way this
[39:02] morning. Did you enjoy the word of the
[39:04] Lord last night? My just stirred our
[39:07] hearts, didn't it? Amen. And brother
[39:09] Timothy is a very special unique gift to
[39:11] the body of Jesus Christ and he can just
[39:14] begin to preach and it just seems it
[39:16] just seems like the spirit of the Lord
[39:17] he's just he's just settling in and all
[39:19] of a sudden the spirit of the Lord just
[39:21] drops into the building. It's like a
[39:22] bomb goes off and all of a sudden the
[39:25] atmosphere completely changes. And I so
[39:27] love brother Timothy's gift and we're
[39:29] honored to have him here this Mother's
[39:30] Day weekend and we're just going to
[39:32] invite him to come at this time and make
[39:35] himself feel right at home here. He's
[39:37] he's no stranger to us here at Full
[39:39] Gospel Lighthouse. And we love we love
[39:41] his ministry, don't we? Amen. We
[39:44] appreciate Brother Tim Winters coming
[39:45] and his family to be a part of this
[39:47] weekend as well. Amen. Let's have a key
[39:49] of G. Let's sing that. Let's start

[48:43] praise.
[48:50] Amen.
[48:51] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just bow our
[48:53] hearts to him in prayer today. How many
[48:55] would say, "Lord, I have a need. I just
[48:57] ask you to come by and minister to me
[49:00] and touch me today by your grace."
[49:03] Father, we come to you once again,
[49:06] Father, just to submit ourselves to you
[49:08] and ask Lord that you would speak and
[49:11] you would touch each heart, each life.
[49:14] See the hands lifted. You know the
[49:16] needs, you know the situations. Lord,
[49:19] you
[49:20] know, Father, even where we're at today
[49:22] and where we're standing, Lord, we just
[49:25] submit our hearts to you and our life to
[49:28] you, our will to you, Lord, to give it
[49:31] for your glory and for your honor, Lord.
[49:33] We love you with all of our hearts. May
[49:35] just give us a real special time today
[49:37] in your presence. We pray in Jesus name.
[49:42] Amen. Amen. God bless you today. Let's
[49:45] turn to First Corinthians 2.
[49:48] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[49:49] the Lord and Amen. Just thankful for all
[49:52] that God's done for us. Of course, bring
[49:54] you greetings from our home church and
[49:56] our pastor, brother Timuit, and got a we
[50:00] evening light tabernacle has a lot of
[50:02] love for you and and we uh sure
[50:04] appreciate each and every one of you.
[50:07] Amen. It's just good to be in his house
[50:09] and and to be his people. Amen. To be
[50:12] called by his name. Amen. I I uh
[50:15] actually um was uh going in a total
[50:18] different direction this morning, but
[50:20] just begin to read over some things in
[50:22] the back and things begin to just speak
[50:25] to my heart. And so I trust that'll be
[50:28] all right today. You know, I I don't
[50:29] even know. I may have preached this here
[50:31] before, but it just what I feel led to
[50:32] do. So, amen. I I um kind of pushed it
[50:36] back and pushed it back and but here we
[50:38] are. So, we're just going to follow
[50:40] where we feel to go and just ask the
[50:42] Lord to take control today. 1
[50:44] Corinthians 2 and verse 7 says, "But we
[50:47] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[50:50] even the hidden wisdom which God
[50:52] ordained before the world unto our
[50:54] glory, which none of the princes of this
[50:57] world knew. For had they known it, they
[51:00] would not have crucified the Lord of
[51:02] glory. But as it is written, eye hath
[51:05] not seen, nor ear heard, near e, neither
[51:08] have entered into the heart of men the
[51:10] things which God has prepared for them
[51:12] that love him. But God hath revealed
[51:15] them to us by his spirit. For the spirit
[51:18] searches all things, yay, the deep
[51:21] things of God. For what man knoweth the
[51:24] things of a man, say the spirit of man
[51:26] which is in him? Even so, the things of
[51:29] God knoweth no man, but the spirit of
[51:32] God. Now we have received not the spirit
[51:35] of the world, but the spirit which is of
[51:37] God, that we might know the things that
[51:40] are freely given to us of God. Amen.
[51:44] We'll let you be seated
[51:46] today. Amen.
[51:53] just want
[51:55] to look at this scripture that we've
[51:58] read and
[52:00] um my title is going to be from the
[52:03] surface to the
[52:04] depths. Amen. I I believe God wants us
[52:07] to be more than just surface Christians.
[52:11] Amen. Just on the surface or Amen. and
[52:14] just dwelling there. Because, you know,
[52:15] he actually spoke about the seed and the
[52:18] so sewer and how that the sewer went out
[52:21] to sew and some fell upon rocky soil and
[52:24] and because they fell or rocky places
[52:26] and because of that they had no depth
[52:28] that when trials came and and and
[52:31] sorrows came, they withered away. He
[52:34] said, "But those that fell in a soil
[52:36] that was prepared or good soil, brother
[52:38] Brown, we talk about that's prepared
[52:40] soil that was prepared by God." Amen.
[52:42] Then those seeds came to life. And and
[52:45] this is what Paul is even speaking
[52:46] about. He says the Lord of glory came
[52:49] and he was crucified because the princes
[52:52] of that world didn't know who he was on,
[52:54] you know, they were surface Christians.
[52:56] They they had the dress of a Christian.
[52:58] They they had the uh uh the the talk of
[53:01] a Christian. They they could do all of
[53:03] that. But when it came to the revealed
[53:05] word that stood before them, they didn't
[53:07] even realize who he was. But they looked
[53:09] at him with that surface mentality and
[53:12] looked at him and said, "Well, he's just
[53:13] an illegitimate child or he's just the
[53:15] son of Mary and Joseph." And they didn't
[53:18] realize who was really standing behind
[53:20] the skin there standing before them. And
[53:22] he said if they would have known that,
[53:24] they would not have crucified him. Amen.
[53:27] But he goes on, he said, "Now you, God
[53:30] has come to reveal the deep things of
[53:32] God." And he says we can only know that
[53:34] if we have the spirit of God. Amen.
[53:37] That's why I believe that this message
[53:38] is not something that can be handed down
[53:41] generation to generation. You know, as
[53:43] we've said it before, Brother Brandham
[53:44] says it. He says, "God doesn't have
[53:46] grandchildren." Amen. He has children.
[53:48] So, amen. Us as sons or mothers, I mean,
[53:51] mothers here this morning, how many
[53:52] would love, Amen, just to hand this
[53:54] truth on to the next generation or hand
[53:57] this life on to the next generation? But
[53:59] every one of us has to have our own
[54:01] experience with God. Every one of us has
[54:04] to come face to face to God and face to
[54:06] face with that pillar of fire. Amen. To
[54:08] have that experience or otherwise, amen,
[54:11] we don't we can't even understand the
[54:13] things of God. And and this is what
[54:14] brother Brandon would talk about in the
[54:15] church age book. He said when one
[54:17] regards a verse superficially, he comes
[54:20] up with a superficial understanding. Now
[54:23] superficial means to existing or
[54:25] occurring at or on the surface. We're
[54:28] not deep. We're not complete. not having
[54:30] or showing any depth of character or
[54:32] understanding. So the only way that this
[54:35] Bible can be revealed is if you have the
[54:38] spirit of this Bible living on the
[54:40] inside of you. Amen. If you can get
[54:42] Amen. If you could pick up the spirit,
[54:45] amen, of the author that writes a book
[54:47] or the spirit of the artist who who
[54:49] paints a picture, then you can have a
[54:51] deeper understanding of why they painted
[54:53] it, why they done it that way, why they
[54:55] wrote it that way because something
[54:57] happened on the inside of them or
[54:59] through their life that caused them,
[55:01] amen, to do what they done. So, amen. To
[55:03] understand the Bible, to understand the
[55:05] message of the hour, you must receive
[55:08] the spirit of this message. And the
[55:10] spirit of this message is the Holy
[55:12] Ghost. Amen. Amen. Therefore, this is
[55:14] not a learned religion or a learn
[55:16] behavior or or an acc or just
[55:19] assimilating to an idea or assimilating
[55:21] to a dress code or assimilating to some
[55:24] kind of idea that's passed on. Amen. By
[55:26] a preacher or a bishop, but this is only
[55:29] given by the spirit of almighty God.
[55:32] Amen. And this is what he said. He
[55:33] brother would talk about this. He said
[55:35] by day and day entering back and meeting
[55:37] to meet I see a great need. Amen. a
[55:40] great need of a of a filling of a
[55:42] consecration of a deeper life and a
[55:45] closer walk with God. How how many would
[55:47] desire that? I don't I don't care how
[55:49] long you've been serving God. We could
[55:51] all get closer to him. Amen. He said,
[55:53] "Oh Lord," I said, "I thank you that
[55:55] every year," he said, "I'm ashamed of
[55:57] many things that I've done that's wrong.
[55:58] I pray you forgive me and the one regret
[56:01] I have, Lord, that I didn't serve you
[56:02] when I was a little boy. Help me, Lord."
[56:04] Lord, he said, "Oh Lord, if I found
[56:06] grace in thy sight, strengthen this
[56:08] feeble body. Renew my strength. Renew my
[56:11] youthful strength as you do the eagles.
[56:13] Put my head higher, Lord, that my heart
[56:15] may my and my heart low as I may walk,
[56:18] Lord, yet and manifest your love to the
[56:20] people. Give me a deeper love, a more
[56:23] consecration, a deeper and a fuller life
[56:26] that I might serve you better." Well, I
[56:29] believe if the prophet of God can have
[56:30] that attitude, I believe we ought to all
[56:33] have that attitude. Amen. That no matter
[56:35] how long I've been serving the Lord, no
[56:37] matter how long I've been in this
[56:39] message, I want a deeper walk with him.
[56:41] I want a closer, more consecrated life.
[56:44] Amen. Given unto God. See, this ain't a
[56:47] shallow affair. It isn't something
[56:48] Brother said, I heard on a broadcast,
[56:50] every person that believe has been
[56:53] filled with the Holy Spirit. No, he
[56:54] said, "I'm not disagreeing with that
[56:56] minister, but he just probably didn't
[56:58] understand the scriptures." Paul in the
[57:00] Acts the 19th chapter asked the people
[57:03] had they received the Holy Ghost since
[57:05] they believed.
[57:07] Come on, somebody. Not when you believe,
[57:09] since you believed. Amen. The Holy Ghost
[57:12] is a gift of God after you believe. It's
[57:15] God's gift to you for believing.
[57:18] Hallelujah. But you can believe Jesus
[57:20] being son of God. You can accept him as
[57:23] your personal savior. Amen. You can
[57:25] believe this message is right. You can
[57:27] believe the dress and you can believe
[57:29] all kinds of things. But if you have not
[57:31] accepted him and and receive the Holy
[57:34] Ghost, Amen. The gift of the Holy Ghost
[57:36] is a personal gift to the believer.
[57:39] Amen. You're saved because you believe.
[57:42] You're filled with the Holy Ghost when
[57:44] God's gift comes on the inside of you.
[57:48] So, it's not a shallow affair. It's
[57:50] something deeper than that. We He said
[57:52] we're not babes anymore. We're men and
[57:54] women. The church should be in the con
[57:56] in that condition. Not shallow but deep
[57:59] in God.
[58:02] Hallelujah. Amen. But amen. And when
[58:04] Jesus was here on earth, he met a woman
[58:07] in this condition. He we can look at in
[58:09] John chapter 4 and verse four. He goes
[58:11] to he had must needs to go through
[58:13] Samaria. And he cometh to the city of
[58:15] Samaria, which is called Saikar, near a
[58:18] parcel ground that Jacob gave to his son
[58:20] Joseph. And there was a well there. And
[58:22] there was a woman and he was sitting
[58:24] there waiting on her. And she come to
[58:26] bring to come draw water. And Jesus said
[58:28] to her, "Give me a drink." And and
[58:30] because the disciples had gone into the
[58:32] city and this woman looked at him very
[58:35] superficially. She looked at him just on
[58:37] the outside and said, "You know why?
[58:39] You're you're a Jew. Why would you ask
[58:41] me a woman of Samaria?" You know, it
[58:43] became a race thing very quickly.
[58:47] Amen. If it's all about race to you,
[58:49] you're nothing but a superficial
[58:50] Christian.
[58:52] Amen. Cuz this message didn't come to a
[58:54] certain Amen. color or certain person.
[58:58] It came to the bride of Jesus Christ. It
[59:01] doesn't matter what color you are, what
[59:03] creed you are, what race you are.
[59:08] Amen. Amen. So Jesus said, "Look," he
[59:11] said, "if you knew the gift of God and
[59:13] who it is that's talking to you, you
[59:15] would ask me of a drink."
[59:19] And she was still very superficial, you
[59:21] know. She said, "Well, what do you mean
[59:22] ask you of a drink? You don't have a
[59:24] water pot.
[59:27] I got one."
[59:30] This is what she's concentrating on.
[59:32] What do you mean? This This is drawing.
[59:35] This well is deep and you ain't got
[59:36] nothing to draw with. Win, win, win.
[59:38] Well, how do you got some kind of
[59:40] living? What are you talking
[59:41] about? Said, "Art thou greater than our
[59:44] father Jacob that gave us this well and
[59:46] and his children and his cattle?" And
[59:48] Jesus answered and said, "Well,
[59:50] whosoever drink this water is going to
[59:52] thirst again."
[59:54] Yeah. You drink this, you're going to
[59:55] get thirsty again the next hour or the
[59:57] next Monday or whatever. Amen. You're
[59:59] going to run out of water and you're
[1:00:00] going to have to come back again. But
[1:00:02] the water that I can give you,
[1:00:06] let's go down a little deeper than that
[1:00:08] well there. Let's go down more than 30
[1:00:10] feet or 40 feet. The water that I can
[1:00:12] give you, you'll never thirst again.
[1:00:17] Amen. Brother Brandon would bring that
[1:00:18] out and thirst. He said, "The reason
[1:00:20] people smoke and the reason people do
[1:00:22] things of the world and the reason why
[1:00:24] they cuz they're thirsty." He said, "But
[1:00:26] if you can ever get a drink of the
[1:00:29] everlasting spring of life, you'll never
[1:00:32] thirst
[1:00:34] again." Amen. You say, "Well, I'm a
[1:00:37] Christian, brother. Yet you still got
[1:00:38] that stuff in your life." No, you're
[1:00:40] still thirsty. You still need a drink.
[1:00:44] You still need to come and get a drink
[1:00:46] of the everlasting fountain.
[1:00:52] Well, sir, give me this. She said,
[1:00:54] "Well, wait a minute. Maybe we're
[1:00:55] talking. Give me this water that I
[1:00:57] thirst not, neither come or hear the
[1:00:59] draw. She's still She's thinking he's
[1:01:01] got a different well
[1:01:02] somewhere. He did, but not the well, not
[1:01:05] the kind she's thinking
[1:01:07] about. He said, "Well, uh, go call thy
[1:01:10] husband." Uh-oh. He going to take her a
[1:01:12] little deeper than what she came for
[1:01:14] that
[1:01:15] morning. He said, "Well, I have no
[1:01:17] husband." He said, 'You said, 'Well, you
[1:01:18] have no husband, for thou has had five
[1:01:20] husband husbands, and who thou hast is
[1:01:22] not thy husband. for you have told the
[1:01:25] truth. Now she's realizing somebody's
[1:01:28] different than just a Jew.
[1:01:32] She said, "Well, sir, I perceive you're
[1:01:34] a
[1:01:35] prophet." It's good to recognize that,
[1:01:38] but it goes deeper than that.
[1:01:41] Amen. I perceive you're a prophet. Amen.
[1:01:44] Our fathers worshiping this mountain.
[1:01:47] You know, look how religious you got.
[1:01:50] Oh, you're a prophet. Well, I'm a
[1:01:52] worshshiper, too. and I I go over here
[1:01:54] and my fathers go over here and the Jews
[1:01:56] go over here. That's not what he was
[1:01:57] talking about.
[1:02:01] He said, "But woman, believe me, the
[1:02:03] hour cometh, you shall never neither in
[1:02:05] this mountain nor Jerusalem worship the
[1:02:07] Father. You worship ye know what you
[1:02:10] know not." Amen. You, we know what we
[1:02:12] worship for salvation of the Jews. But
[1:02:14] the hour cometh, and now is, when true
[1:02:17] worshippers shall worship the Father in
[1:02:19] spirit and truth. For the Father is
[1:02:21] seeking such to worship him. God is a
[1:02:24] spirit, and they that worship him must
[1:02:26] worship him in spirit and truth.
[1:02:30] Oh, something's going on here. I know
[1:02:32] that my the Messiah cometh.
[1:02:34] And this is going beyond what a prophet
[1:02:36] and go, I know the Messiah cometh. And
[1:02:39] Jesus looked at said, be called the
[1:02:40] Christ, and when he comes, he'll tell us
[1:02:42] all things. and said, Jesus said, "I am
[1:02:45] he that speaks to you."
[1:02:49] Oh, glory to God. And I want you to
[1:02:51] understand in verse 28, the woman then
[1:02:54] left her water pot.
[1:02:58] All of a sudden, it wasn't important to
[1:03:00] her no more.
[1:03:03] Something at the beginning of this
[1:03:04] conversation was very important.
[1:03:10] Amen. It was very important to her and
[1:03:12] her her pet peeve or whatever that she
[1:03:14] had. I got a water pot. You don't have
[1:03:16] one. But at the end of this
[1:03:18] conversation,
[1:03:21] Amen. Jesus took her into the depths and
[1:03:24] she realized this water pot's not what's
[1:03:26] important. I have found a man who told
[1:03:29] me all things. He told me of my past
[1:03:34] mistakes. Come on, somebody. You'll get
[1:03:37] to the place when you find this, you'll
[1:03:39] realize religion ain't
[1:03:42] important. What I think ain't important.
[1:03:45] What somebody else thinks ain't
[1:03:46] important. I have found somebody who
[1:03:49] told me who I am.
[1:03:52] You'll leave that religion. You'll leave
[1:03:54] that water pot. You'll leave what you
[1:03:56] think's important.
[1:03:58] Amen.
[1:04:01] Amen. How many longs for a deeper walk
[1:04:03] with God?
[1:04:05] Well, there's a deeper walk somewhere or
[1:04:07] you wouldn't have a thirst for it.
[1:04:10] Well, hallelujah. Someone has created in
[1:04:13] you a desire to walk close. Something
[1:04:15] has created in you a desire to walk
[1:04:17] closer to God. Something has created you
[1:04:20] a desire to be healed by
[1:04:24] God. Before there could be a create be
[1:04:27] created in your body and your spirit,
[1:04:28] there had to be a creator of that. That
[1:04:30] creator is the Holy Spirit. That's why
[1:04:32] you're here is because the Holy Spirit
[1:04:35] has led you here.
[1:04:40] Hallelujah. That's why you're here
[1:04:42] because the Holy Spirit has led you
[1:04:44] here. How many believes that? He has led
[1:04:47] you to this place.
[1:04:50] You're not here by accident.
[1:04:54] I I want to drive this home for a
[1:04:56] moment. You are not here by accident.
[1:04:59] You are pre-planned by God. God does not
[1:05:02] have accidents.
[1:05:06] It was not an accident he was sitting on
[1:05:08] that well that morning.
[1:05:10] It's not an accident that he changed my
[1:05:13] thought this morning.
[1:05:16] Come on, somebody. Your birth was no
[1:05:18] accident. Your life was no accident.
[1:05:21] Listen, your parents may not have
[1:05:23] planned for you to be born, but God
[1:05:25] planned for you to be born.
[1:05:30] God planned for you. And if he planned
[1:05:33] for you, he'll not give up on you.
[1:05:37] Long before you were conceived by your
[1:05:39] parents, you were conceived in the mind
[1:05:42] of God. He thought of you first.
[1:05:48] This is not fate. This is not chance.
[1:05:50] This is not by luck. This is not
[1:05:52] coincidence that you're breathing at
[1:05:54] this very moment. You're alive because
[1:05:57] God created you.
[1:06:00] He prescribed every detail of your body.
[1:06:02] He chose your race. He chose your color.
[1:06:05] He chose your hair. He chose every
[1:06:07] feature about you.
[1:06:14] I'm I'm whooping that devil because the
[1:06:16] devil wants to come and say, "Well, God
[1:06:17] don't even love you." Well, he loved you
[1:06:19] so much he thought of you before the
[1:06:20] foundation of the world and he prepared
[1:06:22] you a body to be born in.
[1:06:25] He custom made your body just the way he
[1:06:27] wanted it. He also determined the
[1:06:29] natural talents that you would possess
[1:06:31] and the uniqueness of your personality.
[1:06:36] It's Bible. Psalms 139 says it. I'll
[1:06:39] read a different translation if that's
[1:06:41] okay. Lord, you know everything there is
[1:06:43] to know about me.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah. You perceive every moment of
[1:06:48] my heart and soul. You understand my
[1:06:50] every thought before it even enters my
[1:06:52] mind.
[1:06:54] Glory to God. Come on, somebody. You're
[1:06:57] so intimately aware of me, Lord. You
[1:06:59] read my heart like an open book. You
[1:07:01] know all the words I'm about to speak
[1:07:03] before I even start a sentence. You know
[1:07:05] every step I will take before my journey
[1:07:07] even begins.
[1:07:10] You've gone into my future to prepare my
[1:07:12] way.
[1:07:15] Listen, that's some shouting ground
[1:07:16] right there. He's gone into my future to
[1:07:19] prepare my way in kindness. you follow
[1:07:22] behind me and to spare me from the harm
[1:07:24] of my past.
[1:07:28] Hallelujah. This God is going before you
[1:07:31] and this God is standing behind you.
[1:07:38] Amen. He's already watching out before
[1:07:40] you for you before you ever get there.
[1:07:44] Brother Ron, he knew this was coming
[1:07:46] before you even got the first doctor's
[1:07:48] report.
[1:07:50] But he said, "I'll put I'll not put more
[1:07:52] on you than you can stand, but I will
[1:07:55] make a way of escape."
[1:07:59] And that devil is trying to sneak up and
[1:08:02] he's trying to sneak up, but God is
[1:08:04] standing before behind and before.
[1:08:09] [Applause]
[1:08:14] You have laid your hand on me. Oh, this
[1:08:17] is so wonderful and deep and sometimes
[1:08:19] incomp
[1:08:20] incomprehensible. Your understanding of
[1:08:22] me brings me wonder and strength. Where
[1:08:25] could I go from your spirit? Where can I
[1:08:27] run and hide from your face if I go to
[1:08:30] the heavens? You're there. If I go to
[1:08:32] the realm of the dead, you're there. If
[1:08:34] I fly with wings of the shining dawn,
[1:08:37] you're there. If I fly into the sunset,
[1:08:39] you're there. Wherever I go, your hand
[1:08:41] will guide me. Your strength will
[1:08:43] empower me. It's impossible to disappear
[1:08:45] from you.
[1:08:49] to ask the darkness to hide me or for
[1:08:51] your presence is everywhere bringing
[1:08:53] light into my night.
[1:08:57] There's no such a thing as darkness with
[1:08:58] you. The night to you is as bright as
[1:09:01] the day. There's no difference between
[1:09:02] the two. You formed my innermost being.
[1:09:05] You shaped my delicate inside, my
[1:09:07] intricate outside, and wo them together
[1:09:09] in my mother's womb.
[1:09:14] I thank you God for making me so
[1:09:16] mysteriously complex. Everything you do
[1:09:19] is marvelously breathtaking. It simply
[1:09:22] amazes me to think about it how
[1:09:24] thoroughly you know me Lord. You have
[1:09:26] formed every bone in my body. You have
[1:09:28] created me in the secret place.
[1:09:30] Carefully, skillfully, you shaped me
[1:09:32] from nothing into something. You saw who
[1:09:34] you created me to be before I became me.
[1:09:39] Because I'd never seen the light of day.
[1:09:41] Before I'd ever seen the light of day,
[1:09:43] you numbered the days you planned for me
[1:09:45] and they're already recorded in your
[1:09:47] book. Every single moment you're
[1:09:49] thinking about me. How precious and
[1:09:51] wonderful to consider that you cherish
[1:09:53] me constantly in every thought.
[1:09:57] Oh God, your desires toward me are more
[1:09:59] than the grains of the sands of the
[1:10:00] shore. Even every morning I wake, you're
[1:10:03] still with me because you made me God
[1:10:06] for a reason. He also decided, you also
[1:10:09] decided when I would be born and how
[1:10:11] long I would live. You have planned the
[1:10:14] days of my life in advance. You chose
[1:10:16] the exact time of my birth and the exact
[1:10:19] moment I'll leave here.
[1:10:24] God left no detail to chance.
[1:10:30] He planned it all for his purpose.
[1:10:34] Well, well, wait a minute. What? I
[1:10:35] wanted to be born over here. Uh listen,
[1:10:37] Acts 17:26 that he made every he made
[1:10:40] from one one man every nation of mankind
[1:10:44] to live on the face of the earth having
[1:10:46] appointed or determined their appointed
[1:10:48] times and the boundaries of their lands
[1:10:50] and
[1:10:51] territories. So God chose you to be who
[1:10:54] you
[1:10:58] are. That ought to take the worry out of
[1:11:00] things
[1:11:01] really. You know why he did that? The
[1:11:04] next verse explains it. so that they
[1:11:06] would seek
[1:11:10] God. He knew exactly where to put you so
[1:11:13] that you'd be born of a certain dirt.
[1:11:16] You'd be sporn of a certain way and a
[1:11:18] certain mo mold that it would cause you
[1:11:21] to start seeking after him. It was God
[1:11:23] that did that. God put something on the
[1:11:26] inside of you before the foundation of
[1:11:29] the world. Listen, it wasn't you that
[1:11:31] just got up one morning and said, "I
[1:11:33] want God." No, it was something on the
[1:11:34] inside of you. There was a deep that
[1:11:37] callth to the deep.
[1:11:40] It wasn't this flesh that brought you to
[1:11:42] God. It was something on the inside of
[1:11:45] you. There was eternal seging of God
[1:11:49] placed inside of you before the
[1:11:51] foundation of the world.
[1:11:53] Therefore, he wasn't satisfied with just
[1:11:56] religion.
[1:12:01] There's some of you that's suffering
[1:12:02] with a complex because your father
[1:12:04] rejected you or your mother rejected you
[1:12:07] or your families have rejected you. But
[1:12:09] let me give you assurance this morning.
[1:12:11] God has not rejected
[1:12:14] you. But he has made you accepted in the
[1:12:20] [Applause]
[1:12:22] beloved. He put you that way so you
[1:12:25] would seek after him. Nothing in your
[1:12:27] life is by random choice or a whim.
[1:12:32] It's all for a purpose.
[1:12:35] Yeah. All everything's for a purpose.
[1:12:37] God will use even things that the Satan
[1:12:40] tries to put upon you and he tried to
[1:12:42] scar your life and he tried to tear you
[1:12:45] apart. But God will use that for his
[1:12:48] glory. I've seen it happen. Now you have
[1:12:51] a choice in that. You can either allow
[1:12:53] that thing to tear you down and take you
[1:12:55] down or you can allow God to mold it.
[1:12:59] And remake
[1:13:01] you and take that complex off of you.
[1:13:07] Listen, you don't have to bearish things
[1:13:09] that man have done to you. Sure, men do
[1:13:10] some evil things.
[1:13:14] Amen. I know men that'll molest their
[1:13:15] children. They'll do all kind of ungodly
[1:13:18] things and think they're and they'll
[1:13:19] dress holy, act holy, and everything on
[1:13:21] the outside. Look, that's just a surface
[1:13:23] relationship with God. But on the
[1:13:25] inside, you're the cage of every unclean
[1:13:28] and hateful bird.
[1:13:31] That's not what this message produces.
[1:13:35] I tell you what does produce that. False
[1:13:38] doctrines.
[1:13:41] False doctrines will put a dress code on
[1:13:43] you. Oh yeah. The Roman Catholics,
[1:13:45] they'll dress and they'll look so holy,
[1:13:47] but on the inside, the Bible says
[1:13:49] they're the cage of every unclean and
[1:13:52] hateful bird.
[1:13:56] I've seen it right on the very edges of
[1:13:58] the realms of the message. False
[1:14:00] doctrines that gather around and they
[1:14:01] and they're so so unclean in their lives
[1:14:04] and there's molesters in there and child
[1:14:06] abusers and there's all kinds of stuff.
[1:14:09] Why? because they received a word from a
[1:14:12] man and not a word of God.
[1:14:16] This message is not a dictation from
[1:14:18] man.
[1:14:20] It's not a seventh grade educated man's
[1:14:23] ideas. It's a It came from the throne of
[1:14:26] Almighty God. And there's a life that
[1:14:28] goes with it. And it'll take you beyond
[1:14:30] the surface
[1:14:34] to the
[1:14:35] depths. It'll clean your life out.
[1:14:39] [Applause]
[1:14:46] Amen. God's amazing. He He decided how
[1:14:49] you would be born, what family you would
[1:14:51] be born in. It's his choosing. You
[1:14:54] didn't choose it. Your parents couldn't
[1:14:57] even choose it.
[1:15:00] Because parents or or men, you know,
[1:15:02] men, whether it be husbands, wives, or
[1:15:05] husbands, or their women be wives or or
[1:15:08] fathers or pastors, they can choose you
[1:15:10] and unchoose you.
[1:15:13] Men can change their mind about you. You
[1:15:16] can be their friend one day and be their
[1:15:17] enemy the next. Come on. But God can't
[1:15:21] change his mind.
[1:15:25] It doesn't matter whether your parents
[1:15:26] were good, bad, or indifferent. God knew
[1:15:29] that these two individ individuals
[1:15:31] possessed exactly the right gen genetic
[1:15:34] makeup to create a custom you he had in
[1:15:36] mind.
[1:15:40] Woo! I'm whooping some devil's heads
[1:15:42] right now. I can feel it. The DNA God
[1:15:44] wanted to make you. God purpose God's
[1:15:47] purpose took into account human error.
[1:15:51] It took into account even sin.
[1:15:55] But God never makes a mistake. It's
[1:15:58] never an accident. He has a reason for
[1:16:01] everything he creates.
[1:16:04] He didn't create a tree just to see if
[1:16:06] he could do it. He didn't create a blade
[1:16:08] of grass or a flower, a bird. He had a
[1:16:10] reason in his mind. Neither did he
[1:16:13] create you just to see if he could do
[1:16:15] it.
[1:16:19] The reason he does it is for a purpose.
[1:16:24] But we
[1:16:25] find we find though that if it's on just
[1:16:28] a surface relationship with
[1:16:31] God. So we switch back
[1:16:33] over. He tells about in second Timothy 3
[1:16:36] and verse one. Know also the last days
[1:16:37] perilous time shall come. For men shall
[1:16:39] be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
[1:16:42] boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[1:16:44] disobedient to parents, unthankful and
[1:16:45] holy without natural affection. Hello.
[1:16:49] truth breakers, false accusers,
[1:16:51] incontinent, fierce, despiser of those
[1:16:52] that are good, traitors, heady,
[1:16:54] high-minded, lovers of pleasures more
[1:16:56] than lovers of God, having a form of
[1:16:58] godliness,
[1:17:00] a form, an outward address, an outward
[1:17:03] appearance, but denying the power
[1:17:08] thereof from such turn away. A form is
[1:17:11] an outward appearance, but there's no
[1:17:12] depths to the inside. It's on the
[1:17:15] outside looks like God, but on the
[1:17:17] inside it's the cage of every unclean
[1:17:19] and hateful bird. Even individuals on
[1:17:22] the outside, they can talk the message,
[1:17:24] they can tell all the scriptures, they
[1:17:26] can talk the quotes, but on the inside
[1:17:28] they're shallow and hollow.
[1:17:32] This modern loving age could have done
[1:17:35] no better leader than when they got
[1:17:37] Satan, a perverter of the word of God.
[1:17:38] Like he started off in the Garden of
[1:17:40] Eden. very religious though rely but
[1:17:42] relying on his own understanding but
[1:17:44] Proverbs 3:5 says we lean not to our own
[1:17:48] understanding it must be that unmovable
[1:17:50] unshakable revelation from
[1:17:54] God because I want you to understand
[1:17:56] this is something here eternal life is
[1:17:59] not something somebody can talk you into
[1:18:04] or dictate to you or hand down to you
[1:18:07] eternal life can only come by one way
[1:18:09] you die to yourself.
[1:18:12] You die to your own ideas and what you
[1:18:14] think or what's been p pushed down your
[1:18:16] throat for generations. You die to all
[1:18:18] of that.
[1:18:24] The god of this world has become
[1:18:27] knowledge and science.
[1:18:29] Brother Brandham talks about he talk
[1:18:32] I've been reading of course some of the
[1:18:33] quotes about the pope and different
[1:18:35] things that's happened just in the news
[1:18:36] in the last few days and people have
[1:18:38] been sending things and he he makes it
[1:18:40] very clear that that church that church
[1:18:42] of Satan is going to be a church of
[1:18:44] science
[1:18:46] science is going to be their leader and
[1:18:47] that's and that's that's this new pope
[1:18:49] he following right in the steps of the
[1:18:50] next one of of glo of the global climate
[1:18:53] and global warming and how we can how we
[1:18:55] can make climate change. It's a It's a
[1:18:57] church of science.
[1:19:00] I'm ready to change climates. All right,
[1:19:04] but it ain't going from 97 degrees down
[1:19:07] to 79 degrees. That's nice sometime, but
[1:19:09] that ain't what I'm talking about.
[1:19:10] That's just temporary, but I'm about to
[1:19:12] change climates.
[1:19:15] Amen. If I could get you more interested
[1:19:17] in a real climate change this morning,
[1:19:19] that you're going to change from being a
[1:19:21] sinner into a son of God. That you're
[1:19:23] going to change from this old dimension
[1:19:25] into a new dimension. You're going to
[1:19:27] change from this old body into a new
[1:19:29] body. That's the climate we're worried
[1:19:31] about
[1:19:33] changing. So, how are we going to do
[1:19:35] that? How are we is the rapture just
[1:19:37] going to happen and all these things
[1:19:38] just f you know there's a man one time
[1:19:40] my dad was talking to and he said he
[1:19:42] believed he's smoking one cigarette
[1:19:43] after another. He said,"Tim, I'm just as
[1:19:46] saved." He said, 'I believe the Lord
[1:19:47] Jesus Christ is my savior. I'm saved. I
[1:19:49] believe when the rapture happened, I'll
[1:19:51] just drop down this cigarette and I'll
[1:19:52] go on to
[1:19:55] heaven. Well, if you think heaven don't
[1:19:57] want you smoking, why you think heaven
[1:19:59] want you smoking here?
[1:20:02] Why all of a sudden is it all of a
[1:20:03] sudden going to become no smoking?
[1:20:06] I don't understand the understanding,
[1:20:07] but that's what been passed down. It's a
[1:20:10] learned theology. It's a learned idea.
[1:20:13] It's a learn religion. We're not
[1:20:15] interested in that.
[1:20:17] Come on. We're not interested in passing
[1:20:19] down theologies that's been given down
[1:20:22] through generations.
[1:20:25] Amen. We're in the message of
[1:20:27] restoration.
[1:20:29] It's not a message of reformation. It's
[1:20:31] a message of restoration.
[1:20:34] We're not interested in just reforming
[1:20:36] somebody to a new idea or a new theology
[1:20:39] or a new way of life. That's not what
[1:20:41] this is about. We're are we're
[1:20:43] interested in a life being changed
[1:20:46] till it's no longer them that liveth but
[1:20:49] Jesus Christ that lives on the inside.
[1:20:57] Hope this is all right.
[1:21:03] Second Peter 2 talks about there were in
[1:21:06] verse one said but there were false
[1:21:08] prophets also among the people even as
[1:21:10] there shall be false teachers among you
[1:21:13] who privately shall bring in damnable
[1:21:16] heresies even denying the Lord that
[1:21:18] brought them and bring upon themselves
[1:21:20] swift destruction and many shall follow
[1:21:22] their pernitious ways by reason of whom
[1:21:25] the way of truth shall be evil spoken
[1:21:28] of. Well, that's happening. It sure is.
[1:21:31] Through covenant shall they with fain
[1:21:33] words make merchandise of you. Whose
[1:21:36] judgment now of a long time lingerth not
[1:21:38] and their damnation slumberth not. But
[1:21:40] of God, spared not the angels that sin,
[1:21:42] and cast them down into hell, and
[1:21:44] delivered them the chains of darkness to
[1:21:46] be reserved for judgment, and spared not
[1:21:48] the old world, but saved Noah, the
[1:21:49] eighth person, the preacher of
[1:21:51] righteousness, bringing the flood upon
[1:21:52] the world of the ungodly, and turning
[1:21:54] the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to
[1:21:56] ashes, and but delivered just Lot, vexed
[1:21:59] with filthy conversation of the wicked,
[1:22:00] wicked, for that righteous man dwelling
[1:22:02] among them, and seeing and hearing, vex
[1:22:04] his righteous soul. The Lord knoweth how
[1:22:06] to deliver the godly out of temptations,
[1:22:08] and to reserve the unjust unto the day
[1:22:11] of judgment, to be punished, but chiefly
[1:22:14] them that walk after the flesh in the
[1:22:16] lust of uncleanness, and despise
[1:22:19] government. Well, I tell you what, I
[1:22:21] hate our go. What he said, what he's
[1:22:24] speaking about is despise lordship.
[1:22:30] Hello. He not talking about us being a
[1:22:32] bunch of patriots. He's talking about us
[1:22:35] despising God's leadership and oh, we
[1:22:37] want him to be God, but do we want him
[1:22:39] to be Lord?
[1:22:42] We want to worship him as a God, but God
[1:22:44] wants to be your Lord. He wants to be
[1:22:47] your leader. He wants to be your guide.
[1:22:49] Amen. Presumptions are the self-will.
[1:22:51] They are not afraid to speak evil of
[1:22:53] dignities. He's not talking about, Amen.
[1:22:56] President Trump.
[1:22:58] He's talking about God's glory.
[1:23:04] Whereas angels which are greater in
[1:23:06] power and might bring not rail and
[1:23:07] accusations against them before the
[1:23:09] Lord. But these are natural brute beasts
[1:23:12] made to be taken and destroyed. Speak
[1:23:14] evil of the things they understand not.
[1:23:16] And shall utterly perish in their own
[1:23:18] corruption and shall receive the reward
[1:23:20] of the unrighteous as they count it
[1:23:22] pleasure to write in the daytime. Spots
[1:23:24] they are and blemishes sporting
[1:23:26] themselves in their own deceased while
[1:23:28] they feast with you.
[1:23:30] Oh man, we're not even talking about
[1:23:32] people in the world now.
[1:23:35] We're talking about people that's
[1:23:36] sitting at the same
[1:23:40] table. Help us, Lord.
[1:23:43] I was really wanting to preach a
[1:23:44] shouting sermon this
[1:23:48] morning, feast at the same
[1:23:52] table, but having eyes full of
[1:23:55] adultery that cannot cease from sin,
[1:23:58] beguiling unstable souls, a heart they
[1:24:01] have exercised with covetous practice
[1:24:03] cursed
[1:24:05] children. Boy, we might not like Brother
[1:24:08] Peter as our pastor, would we?
[1:24:12] which have forsaken the right way, and
[1:24:14] gone astray, following the way of Balam
[1:24:16] the son of Azor, who loved the wages of
[1:24:19] unrighteousness, but was rebuked for his
[1:24:21] iniquity. The dumbass speaking with
[1:24:23] man's voice forbade the madness of the
[1:24:25] prophet. These are wells without water.
[1:24:30] Clouds are carried away with a tempest
[1:24:32] to whom the midst of the darkness are
[1:24:34] reserved forever. For when they speak
[1:24:36] great swelling words of vanity, they
[1:24:38] allure through the lust of the flesh.
[1:24:40] Though much wantness as those they that
[1:24:42] are were clean escape from them with who
[1:24:44] live in error. While they promised them
[1:24:47] liberty, they themselves are the
[1:24:49] servants of corruption.
[1:24:52] Of whom a man is overcome and of the
[1:24:54] same he's brought into bondage. For if
[1:24:56] after they have escaped the pollutions
[1:24:58] of the world through the knowledge of
[1:24:59] the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they
[1:25:01] are again tangled therein and overcome.
[1:25:03] Latter end is worse for them than the
[1:25:05] beginning. For it had been better for
[1:25:07] them not to have known the way of
[1:25:08] righteousness than after they have known
[1:25:10] it, turn away from the holy commandment
[1:25:12] delivered unto them. But it's happened
[1:25:14] to them according to the true proverb.
[1:25:16] The dog has turned to his own vomit
[1:25:19] again. And the s that was washed to a
[1:25:21] wall in the mire. Listen, brother Brown
[1:25:24] would take that. He he would say you
[1:25:26] take a you can take a hog and you could
[1:25:28] wash him up. You could clean him up, but
[1:25:31] he's still a hog.
[1:25:34] You can have him spit shine and he look
[1:25:36] he can dress the part. He can look the
[1:25:38] part and he can make honk talk the part.
[1:25:44] But if you let him go one time,
[1:25:48] you can bring him into your house if you
[1:25:50] want to. Some people do. I don't
[1:25:51] understand that. But some people do.
[1:25:52] They bring these guinea pigs or whatever
[1:25:54] and they But if you let him go one time,
[1:25:57] he's going to go right back to the mud.
[1:26:01] Why? because he's still a hog.
[1:26:04] A dog is a dog. You can't help it. He's
[1:26:06] just a dog. I know some I'm getting into
[1:26:09] some stuff right now, but some people
[1:26:11] make dogs humans. They ain't no humans.
[1:26:14] They
[1:26:15] dogs. Listen, I'm sorry. I I haven't
[1:26:18] understood anything. Anybody wants to be
[1:26:20] called a dog mom?
[1:26:30] Amen. The scriptures talks about it.
[1:26:32] They'll worship the creator more the
[1:26:34] creation more than the creator.
[1:26:38] I'll preach over this way for a little
[1:26:40] while.
[1:26:44] Oh, sure. They can be a companion. They
[1:26:46] can be a friend. But they're not a human
[1:26:48] being.
[1:26:50] This is what this world is doing.
[1:26:52] They're worshiping the creation. Amen.
[1:26:54] They don't want you eating the meat. I
[1:26:56] don't understand that either. I'm
[1:26:58] sorry. If you believe that, you can
[1:27:00] believe it if you want to. I don't
[1:27:01] believe it. The Bible says, "Slay and
[1:27:03] eat."
[1:27:06] He ain't talking about no carrot or no
[1:27:08] broccoli. He's talking about a a piece
[1:27:10] of meat.
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:13] For some reason, I don't know why. Amen.
[1:27:15] Listen, that's not what we've been
[1:27:17] called
[1:27:18] to. If you want to live that way, you
[1:27:20] can live that way if you want to. But
[1:27:22] that ain't for me in my house.
[1:27:29] We eat
[1:27:38] meat. Hallelujah. Anyhow, see what you
[1:27:42] got me
[1:27:48] into. Brother Ram talked about in the
[1:27:50] God of this evil age. He said, "Their
[1:27:52] God, little G, their God makes them just
[1:27:55] what they want. They lust after the
[1:27:58] flesh. He'll make them a god of the
[1:28:00] flesh, a little G." He'll put, he said,
[1:28:04] they'll want to wear bikinis and let
[1:28:05] them wear it. They want to wear shorts,
[1:28:06] they'll wear it.
[1:28:12] Yeah. You know, I'm here. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:28:14] Well, I ain't sorry. I'm here.
[1:28:17] I had this young man one time come and
[1:28:18] ask me, you know, what's wrong with
[1:28:20] wearing shorts? I'm a man. I'm a I'm a
[1:28:22] young boy. He said they're below my
[1:28:23] knee. What's wrong with them? I said,
[1:28:26] "Well, the prophet of God talked about
[1:28:28] not wearing them." I said, "I don't know
[1:28:29] what else to tell you." Said, "Go study
[1:28:32] what he said." So, he come back and he
[1:28:34] had all kind of ideas, you know. Well,
[1:28:36] they used to be way up here when they
[1:28:38] when he was talking about them and now
[1:28:39] they're way down here. I said, "Well,
[1:28:42] shorts are shorts are shorts are short
[1:28:43] short. I don't care how short how long
[1:28:46] how they're still shorts.
[1:28:50] preach.
[1:28:51] And so I I said, "Well, I I let me pray
[1:28:53] about this because I I don't want to
[1:28:55] just give you some answer off the top of
[1:28:56] my head. Let me talk to the Lord about
[1:28:57] this." So I began to talk to the Lord
[1:28:59] about it. And and and because he he he
[1:29:01] began to use these words. He said,
[1:29:02] "Well, I believe that was just, you
[1:29:04] know, maybe an
[1:29:05] opinion." Well, I'd be careful with that
[1:29:07] word.
[1:29:09] So I was praying about it, Brother
[1:29:11] Andrew. And while I was praying, the
[1:29:13] Lord spoke to my heart, and you said,
[1:29:14] "You ask him what influences his
[1:29:16] opinion.
[1:29:20] So I went back to him. I said, "Let me
[1:29:22] ask you something. You said that was
[1:29:23] brother Brandon's opinion. Well, the
[1:29:25] other side is just your opinion. So what
[1:29:27] influencing your opinion?" I said, "I
[1:29:29] can tell you what influenced, if you
[1:29:31] want to call an opinion, I can tell you
[1:29:32] what influenced the prophet's opinion.
[1:29:34] It was the angel of God that came into
[1:29:36] his
[1:29:38] room." So what's influencing you? Is it
[1:29:41] Hollywood or or is it something on the
[1:29:43] online you're saying? What is your
[1:29:45] influence?
[1:29:51] People get all tore up. They said,
[1:29:52] "Well, that's just a preacher's
[1:29:53] opinion." You better be careful with
[1:29:55] that.
[1:30:00] Got to be real careful with that. I'm
[1:30:03] not going to say it's all 100% God. I
[1:30:05] mean, because we are men. I'm not going
[1:30:08] I'm not going to make that because I'm
[1:30:09] not thus sayeth the Lord. I I'm not
[1:30:11] deity.
[1:30:13] But we got to be very careful how we
[1:30:14] look at things and realize that might be
[1:30:17] just more than a man because they looked
[1:30:19] at Jesus and said, "Well, that's just
[1:30:20] your opinion."
[1:30:24] And they took his opinion to the cross
[1:30:26] and hung it.
[1:30:29] Their opinion
[1:30:32] overcame. Mercy
[1:30:34] Jesus. But where he says, "Look, look
[1:30:36] how we're progressing civilization and
[1:30:38] knowledge."
[1:30:39] He said, "All that does is pervert God's
[1:30:41] word to suit their own taste."
[1:30:45] Every denomination does the same thing.
[1:30:46] Satan then preaches his own gospel of
[1:30:49] knowledge in his own church. He said
[1:30:51] there's only two classes of people. The
[1:30:53] children of God and the children of the
[1:30:55] devil.
[1:30:59] Amen. Ephesians 2, they were called the
[1:31:01] children of disobedience. Like Eve
[1:31:03] disobedient to God's word. The children
[1:31:05] of obedience and the children of
[1:31:07] disobedience have nothing in common.
[1:31:11] Hello. Have nothing in common. Then how
[1:31:14] can the bride of Christ associate with
[1:31:16] the denomination?
[1:31:22] Amen. How can one be the word and the
[1:31:24] other one the perverted word? One a
[1:31:25] prostitute, one a clean woman. Walk
[1:31:28] together in agreement. You cannot do it.
[1:31:33] He said come out from among them.
[1:31:39] But it'll take the individual person
[1:31:41] that can see God and look at his word
[1:31:43] and believe it belong to no organization
[1:31:45] but live for God. Not his own
[1:31:46] organization. But the intellectual
[1:31:48] wisdom of the intellectual wisdom of
[1:31:50] some bishop or something that's been
[1:31:52] taught. But the children of disobedience
[1:31:54] and the children of obedience have
[1:31:56] nothing in common. One is of the light
[1:31:58] and the other is of darkness.
[1:32:01] That's right. Amen. They can go and do
[1:32:03] things. Maybe they go they go play
[1:32:05] cards. They go to night clubs. They go
[1:32:07] to dances and belong to a church. That's
[1:32:09] okay with their God. Little G. That's
[1:32:12] okay with their God. Hey, don't condemn
[1:32:14] them. Nothing. By the way, don't condemn
[1:32:16] me to cut my hair.
[1:32:19] That's okay with your God.
[1:32:25] You said, "Well, brother Timothy, why do
[1:32:26] we got to have this? What why we got
[1:32:28] this message? Why? Why? Why is this why
[1:32:30] is this message important? Cuz it's a
[1:32:31] revelation of Jesus Christ in this day.
[1:32:36] There's 40,000 different denominations
[1:32:38] out there and every one of them got
[1:32:40] their own version of what Jesus believes
[1:32:43] or what Jesus says or what Jesus
[1:32:45] desires.
[1:32:48] Every one of them.
[1:32:50] They got a Jesus of their own making.
[1:32:54] Amen.
[1:32:58] Well, it don't condemn me to cut my
[1:32:59] hair. Well, listen. It may not. You know
[1:33:02] why I don't? Because you ain't got the
[1:33:03] spirit of God on the inside of you.
[1:33:06] Plain and simple.
[1:33:10] You know, we had a sister one time that
[1:33:12] was she's passed on now, but she was she
[1:33:14] was a she was a con a
[1:33:17] saved former hairdresser.
[1:33:21] And so she got up one Sunday morning and
[1:33:23] she said, 'You know, she said, 'I my
[1:33:25] hair is growing out and I got these
[1:33:27] split split ends. I need to trim them
[1:33:29] off so my hair grow better. I never
[1:33:32] understood that, but that's what they
[1:33:33] say. But anyway, I I need to trim these
[1:33:36] off so my hair grow better. And so her
[1:33:38] husband's like, "Now honey, you know
[1:33:40] what? We we believe the message of the
[1:33:41] hour and we come give our heart to the
[1:33:43] Lord and we know the teachings in the
[1:33:45] Bible and he's trying to" She said,
[1:33:46] "Well, I just don't think God cares
[1:33:48] about that anymore. I I just don't think
[1:33:50] that's really important to him anymore.
[1:33:52] And he said, "Well, he's the same
[1:33:53] yesterday, today, and forever. If he
[1:33:55] cared about it then, he cares about it
[1:33:56] now."
[1:33:59] That's a good good thing to live by
[1:34:01] right there.
[1:34:03] If God hated sin one time, he still
[1:34:05] hates it today.
[1:34:07] He doesn't get used to it. He doesn't
[1:34:09] get, you know, it ain't go, it don't
[1:34:11] become more normal to him.
[1:34:15] Listen, it's so normal now that a woman
[1:34:18] can be a crossdresser and we don't think
[1:34:19] nothing about it. But a man come out in
[1:34:22] a dress, we're like, "Oh, God have
[1:34:24] mercy." It won't be very many years and
[1:34:26] we'll be like, "Ah, this happens."
[1:34:31] Just the way it
[1:34:34] is. Here she is. And she said, "Well, I
[1:34:37] tell you what, she said he was going to
[1:34:39] work that morning and Sunday morning. He
[1:34:40] had to go to work." And she said, "I'm
[1:34:42] gonna go to church." church and brother
[1:34:43] Tim says, "Anything about cutting hair,
[1:34:45] I'll know that God still doesn't like
[1:34:47] that and I won't cut it. But if he
[1:34:48] don't, then I know God don't really
[1:34:51] care." He says, "Okay." So he goes and
[1:34:54] he goes to work and he's praying about
[1:34:56] it and asking God to intervene. Brother
[1:34:58] Tim comes out and he's preaching on so I
[1:35:00] don't years ago. So I don't know exactly
[1:35:02] what he's preaching, but it wasn't about
[1:35:03] hair. And he's just preaching along and
[1:35:06] all of a sudden he stops. He goes,
[1:35:08] "Sister Mary,
[1:35:14] He said, "Just like when you gave your
[1:35:16] heart to the Lord and I told you no more
[1:35:17] snippy snip snip, that still goes
[1:35:33] today." So maybe somebody need to hear
[1:35:35] that this morning. It still goes
[1:35:37] today. It's still the word today.
[1:35:41] He's still the same today.
[1:35:45] What you need is a heart change. You
[1:35:48] need to go from the surface to the
[1:35:51] depths. You need to go deeper with God
[1:35:54] and have a real birth in your life. Then
[1:35:56] God can change that old nature.
[1:36:01] Or otherwise, you're like a dog back to
[1:36:03] his vomit or a hog back to a waller.
[1:36:18] The Pharisees, as far as the surface,
[1:36:21] they looked like they had it going on.
[1:36:24] They could read, they studied, they the
[1:36:26] word stepped off, but the word stepped
[1:36:28] off paper one day and they missed it.
[1:36:30] You know, they said about them that they
[1:36:32] could roll the scrolls up and they could
[1:36:34] stick a needle through there and tell
[1:36:35] you every letter it touched.
[1:36:39] That's I
[1:36:41] just But it that all of a sudden that
[1:36:44] scroll that been read I don't know
[1:36:46] telling how many times. Behold a virgin
[1:36:48] shall conceive. He steps off a paper and
[1:36:52] he comes walking down the
[1:36:55] road. I heard about that guy. He's
[1:36:57] trying to make himself somebody. He He
[1:36:59] ain't nothing but an illegitimate
[1:37:03] child. Yeah. They were able to get a
[1:37:06] head knowledge of what God was or you
[1:37:08] know what he used to be. But when God
[1:37:11] come walking down the street, they
[1:37:13] missed it. This is why it's important
[1:37:16] that we don't just have a head knowledge
[1:37:18] of what God used to be
[1:37:21] and think it was only used to be 50 or
[1:37:23] 60 years ago, but when God comes walking
[1:37:26] in this building
[1:37:28] and he comes in this service that we
[1:37:30] recognize him.
[1:37:36] We must be more than just surface
[1:37:38] scratchers. We must not be satisfied
[1:37:41] with just a covering.
[1:37:45] Amen. It's not just a regulation or a
[1:37:47] rule book that's handed down to us.
[1:37:49] There must be a revelation of who God
[1:37:51] really is
[1:37:54] and where he is and what he's doing
[1:37:56] today.
[1:38:01] Brother Brandon would go in into and
[1:38:03] visit a woman who's actually was in an
[1:38:06] emergency room. She was a she was in a
[1:38:08] psychopathic ward. went in there said or
[1:38:11] went into visit she was he said it was a
[1:38:13] beautiful young woman about 20 20 25
[1:38:15] years old said how do you do and so I
[1:38:18] saw her said I said I didn't realize it
[1:38:20] she was one of the patients and he said
[1:38:22] she said how do you do and I said well
[1:38:24] it's hard to know which way to start and
[1:38:25] she said if you don't mind sir will you
[1:38:27] start with me and I said well you said
[1:38:29] yes sir I said you're not a patient or
[1:38:31] she said yes I am I said you seem to be
[1:38:33] in your right mind she said I wonder
[1:38:35] could you listen to my
[1:38:38] story she started talking about how she
[1:38:40] was raised up in a good home and her
[1:38:42] mother taught me not to be wrong to do
[1:38:43] wrong and shun evil and embrace the
[1:38:45] right life and the right things and I
[1:38:47] lived that kind of life for a number of
[1:38:48] years but I got mixed up with a young
[1:38:50] man and it caused a disgrace to me and I
[1:38:52] threw myself away and I became an
[1:38:55] alcoholic then she picked me up and sent
[1:38:57] me to a Catholic institution the good
[1:38:59] called the good shepherd's home and
[1:39:01] where I was under correction for a
[1:39:02] number of years and they released me and
[1:39:04] soon as I got out I went right back to
[1:39:06] drinking again and then I served a year
[1:39:07] or two at the woman state prison then I
[1:39:09] changed changed from Protestant to
[1:39:10] Catholic and back to Protestant again,
[1:39:12] from a chaplain talking to me. And I
[1:39:14] came out and I tried again. I ran right
[1:39:16] back into prostitution and drinking. I
[1:39:18] said, "What a boy, where's your mother?"
[1:39:20] And said, "She's dead. Your father's
[1:39:21] dead. What do you think? What do What do
[1:39:23] I" I said, "What do you think they would
[1:39:24] think about you now?" And she said, "Oh,
[1:39:26] if I could only go back there
[1:39:29] again." And I said, "Oh." I said, "Oh,
[1:39:32] lovely young woman like you. Don't you
[1:39:34] desire to be married and have babies
[1:39:36] like my all mothers do?" doing it. She
[1:39:37] said, "Oh, I'd love to, sir, but look at
[1:39:39] me. What I got to offer?" I said, "You
[1:39:41] ain't got but one thing to offer." She
[1:39:43] said, "What's that?" I said, "Your soul
[1:39:44] to Jesus Christ."
[1:39:47] Said, "Sir, he wouldn't receive it." I
[1:39:49] said, "Oh, yes, he would." How do you
[1:39:51] know? How you know? I've tried. He said,
[1:39:53] "You've only just turned
[1:39:57] pages. You only just turn page." You
[1:40:00] know how easy it is in a book to turn
[1:40:02] the page back again? go right back again
[1:40:05] if you just turn over a new leaf. That's
[1:40:07] what he said. How can you take I said he
[1:40:10] I said he can take you back to the time
[1:40:12] you was an innocent girl. The blood of
[1:40:14] Jesus Christ is sufficient and powerful
[1:40:16] to transform the violent sinner into a
[1:40:19] bloodwash saint guiltless before God.
[1:40:21] She said, "I tried that so many times."
[1:40:23] He said, "I want to tell you I believe
[1:40:24] your case has never been diagnosed
[1:40:26] right. You don't know." He said, "You
[1:40:28] don't want to." I said, "You don't want
[1:40:29] to be like that." She said, "Certainly,
[1:40:30] I just what you mentioned. I want to be
[1:40:32] a mother. I want to have a husband. I
[1:40:33] want to have babies. Someone to love.
[1:40:35] Someone that loves me. I I never I never
[1:40:37] spoil a man's life like I have. I said,
[1:40:39] "You don't have to." I said, "This may
[1:40:41] sound oldfashioned, sister, but it's a
[1:40:43] truth nonetheless. It's the devil that's
[1:40:45] done that to you."
[1:40:48] Amen. Let's put the blame on where it
[1:40:50] really belongs. It's the devil that's
[1:40:53] done that to you. It's the devil that's
[1:40:55] done that to you. It's the devil that's
[1:40:57] got you in that position. It's the devil
[1:41:00] that's got a hold of you driving you to
[1:41:02] do things you don't want to do. She
[1:41:05] said, "I always believed that was a
[1:41:06] truth." I said, "Now, will you kneel
[1:41:08] here with me?" She said, "Now, now they
[1:41:09] tell me I'm a mental case." I He said,
[1:41:11] "You
[1:41:13] are, but Jesus Christ restores the right
[1:41:16] mind. There's nothing too great for
[1:41:18] him."
[1:41:21] I said, "Do you think he would do that
[1:41:23] for me?" Certainly. But we got to get
[1:41:24] the devil out of there before he can.
[1:41:26] where he entered you when you was a
[1:41:28] young girl. He'll go out and he'll come
[1:41:30] right back to that place again, seven
[1:41:32] times worse. And he said, but she got
[1:41:33] down on her knees. And I asked her to
[1:41:34] pray. She prayed a few moments. She
[1:41:36] looked over at me. She said, "Brother
[1:41:38] Brandon, I'm going home to make a new
[1:41:39] start." Still scratching on the
[1:41:41] surface. Not going to the depths until
[1:41:44] God until she loses her past and she
[1:41:46] gets a new future. That's what you got
[1:41:48] to do. Amen. She said, I said, "Sis,
[1:41:50] that won't do you one bit of good.
[1:41:52] You're going back to be exactly on the
[1:41:54] same road you already walked down. That
[1:41:56] won't work. I She said, "I mean it with
[1:41:58] my heart. I know you do. But the devil's
[1:42:00] stronger than your mental power."
[1:42:05] That's the reason I don't believe in an
[1:42:06] intellectual religion. I believe a man's
[1:42:09] got to be born again of the spirit of
[1:42:11] God. It's got to be deeper than you're
[1:42:13] thinking. It has to be an experience.
[1:42:18] Well, I think I got the Holy Ghost and I
[1:42:20] think I got this. It got to be deeper
[1:42:22] than that. It's got to be a revelation.
[1:42:27] what must I do? I said, "Stay right
[1:42:29] there." We prayed and prayed and I went
[1:42:31] around and prayed with more people and I
[1:42:32] came back. She was still praying. Going
[1:42:34] back and prayed for some more people.
[1:42:35] Come back. She was getting deeper in
[1:42:38] sincerity. Few moments later, I walked
[1:42:41] over there and she raised up with tears
[1:42:43] running down the tree her cheek. She's
[1:42:45] looked at me in the face. She said,
[1:42:46] "Brother Brandom, something's happened."
[1:42:48] I said, "You don't have to turn no new
[1:42:49] pages now." That's right.
[1:42:52] You don't have to new turn no new pages
[1:42:54] now. The woman's married and got a
[1:42:56] family, a lovely, sweet, born again,
[1:42:58] Holy Spiritfilled saint. God, cuz God
[1:43:01] would take her back to the place where
[1:43:03] she started to do wrong. That's his
[1:43:04] goodness. And from that time, she was a
[1:43:07] changed woman. From that time, she was a
[1:43:09] young girl. Amen. Changed back to where
[1:43:12] she was.
[1:43:18] He says, "How how can
[1:43:22] you do it when you're still thirsting
[1:43:25] and want to be like the world say that
[1:43:27] you got the Holy Ghost?"
[1:43:33] How can you do it when sin is still in
[1:43:35] your life?
[1:43:38] I'm not saying a Christian won't make
[1:43:40] fault have faults and have failures or
[1:43:42] fall down. But a Christian doesn't
[1:43:45] practice sin.
[1:43:53] Amen. We we allow things to stay in our
[1:43:55] life and we want to cover it up and act
[1:43:57] like, you know, we're okay.
[1:44:01] Covered up with a little dirt, you know,
[1:44:02] and a little smile or a little a little
[1:44:04] this, whatever. covered up. But down on
[1:44:07] the inside, we know there's a hollowess
[1:44:11] there. There's a there's a longing.
[1:44:13] There's a desire. We know the inner
[1:44:16] parts of our
[1:44:20] life. Listen, how he said, "How can you
[1:44:24] do it when you're you're still eating
[1:44:26] and longing for the garlic and the flesh
[1:44:28] pots of Egypt?" He said, "Just keep
[1:44:30] walking with Joshua, Jesus. Keep walking
[1:44:33] with him." That's right. Get the new
[1:44:35] grapes, that Pentecostal wine. Get drunk
[1:44:37] on it.
[1:44:44] You know, I I I known some drunks and
[1:44:46] they ain't interested in just one drink.
[1:44:53] Nope. They're not interested in just
[1:44:55] tasting the liquor.
[1:44:58] He wants to consume it to the last drop.
[1:45:01] Listen, I don't understand anybody that
[1:45:04] said, "Well, I received the Holy Ghost a
[1:45:06] long time ago and that's all there." It
[1:45:08] ain't all there is to it.
[1:45:13] There's times of refreshing.
[1:45:18] There's renewings.
[1:45:21] Come on, somebody. Amen. It ought to be
[1:45:24] our hearts dry cry this morning. Lord, I
[1:45:26] want to take another drink.
[1:45:30] If you haven't ever got your first
[1:45:31] drink, I Lord, I want to take a drink
[1:45:34] this morning. Be something that's real.
[1:45:39] I'm tired of being a fake.
[1:45:43] I'm tired of being a fake message
[1:45:45] believer or a fake uh Christian husband
[1:45:48] or a fake Christian wife. I want to be
[1:45:50] something that's real. Amen. I don't
[1:45:53] want to be a bunch of put on and I got
[1:45:55] to dress a certain way to be feel right
[1:45:57] or I got to do that ain't what it's all
[1:45:59] about. Sure, if you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:46:01] you will dress right. You will act
[1:46:03] right. You will live right. You will
[1:46:06] walk right. You will talk right.
[1:46:10] But it will not do you any good to dress
[1:46:12] right, try to act right, try to live
[1:46:14] right without the spirit of God on the
[1:46:17] inside.
[1:46:19] So this morning, I invite you to a well
[1:46:26] We ought to be our hearts cry. God, let
[1:46:27] me have another tree. Let me go into the
[1:46:30] depths of the word.
[1:46:35] I'm not satisfied with a surface
[1:46:37] superficial religion. I want all that
[1:46:39] God has for me,
[1:46:44] brother. He said if you you get there,
[1:46:46] you won't even look to the world
[1:46:47] anymore. Something will happen. Amen.
[1:46:50] And well, remember he says God told
[1:46:52] Joshua every place the souls of your
[1:46:54] footsteps steps are that's possession
[1:46:56] brother them footsteps mean possession.
[1:46:58] Let's just keep walking in the promised
[1:47:00] land not looking back to see what will
[1:47:02] happen back there or what somebody else
[1:47:03] is doing. Keep our eyes on Jesus. Just
[1:47:06] keep moving to the deeper depths and
[1:47:08] higher heights until we're possessing
[1:47:10] everything that God promised we would in
[1:47:13] his word.
[1:47:17] Elisha was visited by two kings one time
[1:47:22] and Ahab and Jehoshaphat. And be honest
[1:47:25] with you, he wasn't no happy mood about
[1:47:27] it. Bible said he was angry. He said,
[1:47:30] "Matter of fact, if it wasn't for
[1:47:31] Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even talk to
[1:47:33] you." He said, "But bring me a
[1:47:37] minstrel." He knew he had to get the
[1:47:39] atmospheres changed. So they brought him
[1:47:42] a minstrel and he started to sing. And
[1:47:44] brother Braman you can read about that
[1:47:45] so wonderful some of those things. He
[1:47:47] said see he said they started the
[1:47:49] atmosphere started changing and so a
[1:47:51] prophecy came forth. He said you go out
[1:47:53] in that desert and you dig down and you
[1:47:56] dig down and you dig down and then I
[1:47:58] will give you water full of ditch or
[1:48:00] ditches full of water.
[1:48:03] Now that was kind of unbelievable that
[1:48:05] they would go in a desert to dig for
[1:48:06] water.
[1:48:08] But brother said that's the spirit's
[1:48:10] message. We'll start digging or we'll
[1:48:12] start perishing.
[1:48:14] We'll start digging things out of our
[1:48:16] life or or we'll perish with those
[1:48:18] things. He said, "You got to get it
[1:48:19] cleaned out. The deeper you dig, the
[1:48:21] better off you're going to be."
[1:48:25] Come on, somebody. The deeper you dig,
[1:48:28] the better off you're going to be.
[1:48:33] Some of us has dug enough to get
[1:48:35] justified. Some of us dug enough to get
[1:48:37] sanctified. But he wants you to dig all
[1:48:39] the way that you can be adopted by the
[1:48:42] power of almighty God. Amen. He got more
[1:48:45] for you than just a superficial. Amen.
[1:48:47] On the surface religion, he got so much
[1:48:49] for you, more than you could ever think.
[1:48:51] More than you could even contain. The
[1:48:53] blessings of God can pour out upon you.
[1:48:56] I say this morning, I hope you didn't
[1:48:58] bring your shovel, amen, to dig and
[1:49:00] throw it on somebody else. Say, "Well,
[1:49:01] that was so and so. That was for so and
[1:49:03] so." I hope you got a shovel this
[1:49:05] morning that you'll dig out every
[1:49:06] unbelief. You'll dig out every root of
[1:49:08] bitterness. You'll dig out that old
[1:49:10] sinful nature. And you say, "I'd rather
[1:49:12] die than live another day like
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:21] that." They dug down. They'd hit a log.
[1:49:24] He said, "Just keep digging. Pull it
[1:49:26] out. Keep digging. Pull it out." You'll
[1:49:29] hit people that you'll hit things that
[1:49:30] say, "Well, days a miracle. Just throw
[1:49:32] that aside."
[1:49:35] What happened?
[1:49:36] What happens? People gets clogged up
[1:49:38] with their own self-made ma made ideas.
[1:49:41] He said, "But I can tell you Jesus
[1:49:43] promises his last days. He'll show these
[1:49:45] signs that you'll see done. The spirit
[1:49:47] of God would come into the church, show,
[1:49:48] show visions and so forth as he is
[1:49:50] doing." And you try to disprove it one
[1:49:52] time and find out where you at. Some
[1:49:55] people as soon as they become
[1:49:56] Christians, they become arrogant and
[1:49:58] indifferent. Wow. Ain't that a
[1:50:02] paradox? Look who I am. I have you to
[1:50:06] know I'm the
[1:50:07] chosen. I have you to know I have my
[1:50:10] doubts.
[1:50:17] Hallelujah. But the more you can get
[1:50:19] yourself out,
[1:50:22] the more room there is for the Holy
[1:50:24] Ghost.
[1:50:31] That's what we desire. That's what we
[1:50:33] need.
[1:50:35] That's what we desire. It's what he said
[1:50:37] in Matthew 5 and verse 6. Blessed are
[1:50:40] they which do hunger, which means to
[1:50:43] seek eagerly and
[1:50:46] thirst. Those who are said to have a
[1:50:48] thirst so painful and eagerly longed for
[1:50:52] that thing that the soul can be
[1:50:54] refreshed and supported and
[1:50:57] strengthened, they shall be filled.
[1:51:02] Listen, if you ain't thirsty for more
[1:51:04] and God of more of God, I don't care how
[1:51:06] long you've been a Christian. If you're
[1:51:08] not still thirsty for more of God or
[1:51:10] hungry for more of God, I would be
[1:51:13] scared to death. That's right. All of
[1:51:16] eternity is not going to reveal all of
[1:51:18] God.
[1:51:22] And how do we expect to get all of him
[1:51:23] in our short little blip?
[1:51:27] No. No. He's got more for you if you
[1:51:30] want more.
[1:51:33] And if you're wanting more this morning,
[1:51:34] it shows you there's more to be had.
[1:51:36] It's a deep that calls to the
[1:51:40] deep. From the surface to the depths.
[1:51:44] Let's bow our hearts.
[1:51:50] could say a lot more
[1:52:02] things. Some of you need to quit hiding
[1:52:05] behind a
[1:52:09] religion and get into Christ.
[1:52:13] Some need to quit hiding by on their
[1:52:16] hiding or resting on their past
[1:52:18] escapades and how they used to be or
[1:52:21] what you God used to do in their lives
[1:52:23] and say, "God, I want another
[1:52:25] drink. I want
[1:52:28] more. I want more." How many has that
[1:52:32] desire this morning? I want
[1:52:35] more. I want
[1:52:37] more. He's here to fulfill that desire.
[1:52:41] He's here to touch your heart and your
[1:52:42] needs. I don't know. He changed my
[1:52:45] thought just right right at the very
[1:52:46] end. I I was on a direct other
[1:52:51] path and I just happened to come across
[1:52:53] these
[1:52:55] notes. Just be to speak to me, move
[1:52:59] through me. It's like the room lit
[1:53:04] up. I know he wants to talk to somebody
[1:53:08] today in a real special way.
[1:53:11] [Music]
[1:53:18] Maybe just this morning want to say,
[1:53:19] "Lord, I I want I'm I want more
[1:53:21] dedication in my life, more
[1:53:23] sincerity. I want more of you, Jesus."
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:30] Maybe some of you just needed that
[1:53:32] complex broke off of you of what your
[1:53:34] parents done to you or that your devil's
[1:53:36] been telling you you was just a mistake
[1:53:38] and nobody loves your cares. But you
[1:53:42] found out this morning he planned you.
[1:53:45] He placed you in a certain family for a
[1:53:47] certain reason to make you a certain way
[1:53:49] and that was so you could desire
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:53] him. God's in control of your life,
[1:53:55] church.
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:54:05] Some of us are so, you know, you got
[1:54:07] them signs say Jesus is my co-pilot. No,
[1:54:11] he ain't no co-pilot in my plane. He's
[1:54:13] the
[1:54:14] pilot. He's the one that's leading and
[1:54:16] guiding. I I don't have a clue what I'm
[1:54:19] doing. He's He's the one that knows what
[1:54:21] I have need of and who I who I'm going
[1:54:24] to be and how it's going to happen. I
[1:54:26] just want to submit my heart to him and
[1:54:29] allow him to work in my life richly and
[1:54:35] deeply.
[1:54:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:41] Father seen the hands were lifted all
[1:54:44] over this building.
[1:54:45] Lord God, we all desire that this
[1:54:50] morning, Lord. We don't want to be just
[1:54:52] superficial Christians and surface
[1:54:56] dwellers. Lord, we we're called to
[1:54:59] deeper depths and and higher
[1:55:03] heights. Oh God, I pray, Father, that
[1:55:06] your spirit just begin to woo over
[1:55:08] hearts today. Maybe they can examine
[1:55:10] themselves and they can see a real
[1:55:12] lacking in their lives and they can see
[1:55:14] where they haven't died out to those sin
[1:55:16] nature or died out to things and this
[1:55:19] morning they just want to lay it upon
[1:55:21] your
[1:55:22] altar and say, "Lord, take this
[1:55:25] sacrifice. I give myself to you, Lord.
[1:55:30] Lord, for whatever reason, you want to
[1:55:31] just kind of continue on this thought
[1:55:37] of Lord, to just allowing ourselves to
[1:55:39] just die out to
[1:55:41] things, allowing ourselves to come clean
[1:55:44] before
[1:55:45] you. Lord, if there be anybody, Lord,
[1:55:48] that on the inside they know they've
[1:55:51] been the cage of every unclean and
[1:55:53] hateful bird and done some awful things
[1:55:55] in their lives, but today Lord, they've
[1:55:58] heard about the forgiveness of God and
[1:55:59] they want to experience. May they find
[1:56:02] that today. I
[1:56:04] pray, Lord, they can really come clean
[1:56:06] with their life and true be a true son
[1:56:10] or daughter of
[1:56:11] God. We ask it in Jesus'
[1:56:14] name. Amen.
[1:56:29] about
[1:56:31] Jesus. I'm sorry,
[1:56:34] Lord. You think
[1:56:39] I It's all about you.
[1:56:45] All about you,
[1:56:49] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for thing I
[1:56:57] made. But it's all about you.

[2:15:41] Earth. Oh, when he
[2:15:46] fall down from the

[2:15:56] gone. My sins forgot.
[2:16:02] There is a
[2:16:06] grave that tried to
[2:16:12] hide. This
[2:16:14] precious
[2:16:16] blood that gave me life.
[2:16:23] Oh, in three
[2:16:25] [Applause]
[2:16:27] days he breathed the
[2:16:32] king and

[2:17:23] There is a
[2:17:27] blood that sides the
[2:17:32] blind that heals the
[2:17:38] sick. The
[2:17:40] lonely fights.
[2:17:44] It has the
[2:17:48] power to free the
[2:17:53] bound as chains they
[2:17:58] fall
[2:18:00] upon the grave.
[2:18:04] Don't pour it

[2:27:20] You can be seated this time.
[2:27:38] Uh, Brother Chester's sister here with
[2:27:40] us, Sister Cynthia. She's come to take
[2:27:43] on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:27:45] today, be buried with him in baptism.
[2:27:48] She realizes what the scripture says and
[2:27:50] how important that Jesus Christ left to
[2:27:52] her this commandment to be baptized in
[2:27:55] his name. She's commit she has
[2:27:57] completely confessed of her sins and
[2:28:00] repented of them and come to take on the
[2:28:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We know
[2:28:04] that by the scripture that God is
[2:28:05] obligated to give you the Holy Ghost if
[2:28:07] we truly repent. So sister prepare for
[2:28:10] your
[2:28:11] blessing. Father, we come to you today
[2:28:14] in a very sacred moment Lord Jesus. Our
[2:28:17] brother Timothy has come all the way
[2:28:19] from Louisiana, Father, and he spoke
[2:28:21] directly some very special things, Lord
[2:28:24] Jesus, to our congregation this weekend.
[2:28:27] Lord, we watch what you have witnessed
[2:28:30] by the preaching of the word today,
[2:28:31] Father, to our souls. How that you are
[2:28:34] taking us from the surface to the
[2:28:36] depths. Father, that explains, Lord
[2:28:38] Jesus, how you take a seed, Father, and
[2:28:40] begin to plant it and watch it grow.
[2:28:42] Father, I pray Lord as Sister Cynthia
[2:28:45] comes today, she's repented of her sins,
[2:28:47] as she's completely turned away from the
[2:28:49] old the old man, the old woman. And now
[2:28:52] we pray God that as we would baptize her
[2:28:54] in this watery grave, that you would
[2:28:56] fill her with the Holy Ghost like never
[2:28:59] before. Now the water doesn't change us,
[2:29:01] Father. It's the washing of the word
[2:29:03] that makes the difference in our life.
[2:29:06] And I pray, Lord, that you would just
[2:29:07] baptize her into the kingdom of God.
[2:29:10] that everyone around her, Father, though
[2:29:12] the things that she may have done in her
[2:29:14] past were made her guilty, Father, but
[2:29:16] the blood of Jesus Christ makes us
[2:29:18] innocent, Father. So, Father, according
[2:29:20] to thy word, I baptize our sister
[2:29:22] Cynthia in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:29:25] Christ.
[2:29:28] Hallelujah.
[2:29:31] Hallelujah.
[2:29:44] Let's stand.
[2:29:50] Let's all go down to the river. Well,

[2:30:17] river. There's a
[2:30:19] man walking on the
[2:30:23] water. Well, come along with
[2:30:27] me if you want to see that man walking
[2:30:33] on the
[2:30:36] water. Well, Jesus, he's that man at the
[2:30:41] river and he's washing all people sins
[2:30:46] away.
[2:30:49] Well, he can save your soul if you give
[2:30:53] him
[2:30:54] control. Be ready for that
[2:30:58] judgement
[2:31:00] day. Oh, well, let's all go down to the
[2:31:06] river. Oh, there's a
[2:31:09] man walking on water.

[2:31:23] walking. God bless you. You're dismissed
[2:31:26] this
[2:31:28] morning from the
[2:31:31] grave. Change the water and turn it into
[2:31:38] wine. Well, he can make the lame home.
[2:31:43] He can make that
[2:31:45] D. Open all the blind eyes to
[2:31:50] see. Oh well, let's all go down to the
[2:31:56] river. There's a

[2:32:13] on the
[2:32:16] water, oh Jesus is that man at the for
[2:32:21] heat.
