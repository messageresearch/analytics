[Music] one time i got to preaching way down in the mountains of kentucky where i was born as i stepped outside the door of the church there was a a man standing there which was a trapper across the hills a great big judah bacca in his mouth that when he had met me the day before and i was squirrel hunting and he was sitting out on the log talking and and they were talking about a little baby been healed the night before which they said had the jerks palsy and they didn't know i was in the woods and this great big fellow with a hat on made out of limb bark i guess there's not a person here ever seen a limb bark hat take hickory bark and scale it off make a hat out of it weave it together and then sitting on that log that stopped sawing the winchester rifles on the trees feuding and money was talking he had a big shooter back in his mouth and he spit in the leaves would fly up he said i saw that youngin stop shaking [Music] i heard him getting pretty rough talking i thought i better make myself known i didn't want to be a stranger going up through those bushes and i said good morning gentlemen that rough bunch of men who would kill you at the drop of your hat jumped to their feet and this big fellow with that long neck and his adam's apple sticking out he looked at me his eyes pushed out he jerked off that hat and swallowed that judah backer and said good morning parson oh if christ is presented in the right way the world will respect it if there's any respect in them certainly it is if it's brought in the way of divine light that night when they left the church he had a lantern in his hand he said i'd give anything parson if i could only believe that god would forgive me of my sins he said i've killed two israeli man and i know that i'm a guilty sinner but when i have seen them things happen in that little church i am aware that there is a true and living god i said he will forgive you [Music] and he wants to forgive you and the very hunger in your heart means that he's working on your soul he said if i could only feel it i said you'll feel it he said when i feel it i'll believe it i said believe it and then you'll feel it he said i wish i know how to do it i said where do you live he said across the mountain about two miles how do you get there up over the ridges and to the paths i said it's very dark he said but i got a lantern i said you can't see your house with your lantern he said no that's right i said then how you know you're going to get there i said just take the lanyard in your hand and you're standing in the light you walk in the right direction every step you make the light will light up the road i said that's the way you find christ stand in his light stand in his blessings stand in his power if you're sick

heavenly father lord we realize that your presence is here this morning lord we realize today lord that this is a a special moment in time lord you ordained the meeting god you ordained the speaker to be here the people that are here you've ordained it all lord god today we come we give ourselves to you we give our spirit our bodies to you lord we ask heavenly father that you would just come this morning and may you just move amongst us lord and may you just give us that peace that passes all understanding father give healing to your people bring deliverance to them lord and bring encouragement to them father whatever they have need of today lord may you may you be that portion in their life today father god as we surrender ourself to you lord may you bless the reading of the scripture and everything that's said and done lord when we leave here today may we be lord able to say it has been good to be in the house of the lord now father may you take these lips and this vessel as i give it to you may you minister to your people bless all the needs of the saints today strengthen this body lord be with brother ron and sister connie and the congregation and brother andrew and brother matthew and their families lord just bless this church immensely father god i pray lord we now invite you to come and have the preeminence in jesus name we ask it all for your glory and the saints said amen turn with me if you would to first corinthians chapter 12. i greet all you that wasn't here last night and good to see you again today and just pray that today will be a real day to you and an encouragement to you and and god to give you strength and victory and peace and overcoming grace we're all in a battle but there are promised to be some overcomers in this day and in this church there will be a group of overcomers amen that's what we believe today we'll just kind of continue on with the thought from last night on what it takes to produce a rapture and i want to read now in first corinthians chapter 12 verse 26 and whether one member suffer all members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it now we are the body of christ and members in particular and god has sent some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversity of tongues are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers or all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues and do all interpret may the lord have his blessing you may be seated we know that not all have all the gifts but i wanted to read you something out of this spiritual food and due season brother branham says now he embodies himself taking your body and my body and gives you gifts he gives me gifts and through these gifts he makes himself known and he says that's the secret food but you have to understand we all have a diversity of gifts everybody's gift is different one might just be ministering one might be speaking in tongues and one might be the gift of of prophecy or whatever but then he goes no matter how much he would make himself known by me you've got to believe it you've got to have the gift of faith too to believe it so god grant us all the gift of faith this morning that that we could at least believe the word of god we could believe all things are possible we can believe for the impossible amen so we are living in a time a manifesting time we realize there's fixing to be a rapture we realize that it might not be too many more days and it might not be too many more hours but we do realize we're living in a time when the grain is maturing the grain will show what seed it is of in the time when it matures and and the church you know started out in its infancy back in the dark ages but when it was underground but now it's grew up into maturity the life is in the grain again exactly like it was a same grain that went in the ground the same jesus today in bride form the same power the same church the same word he's alive today hallelujah was the same word that pulled them all up through all the ages and sucked them up into this age and put life back in the people we dwelt a lot last night on making the word live brotherhood said only the believers can make the word live how many believers are here this morning and in that day when the son of man is to be revealed what did he what did he come to be revealed for to join the head to the body to unite us together and brethren said and the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together now what's that gonna make you the word you will be the word made flesh in this day he says see it's the son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us he will make his word so real he will make his word so real that it unites us together and we're going to a wedding supper listen we're not going to a wedding we're married here we're going to the supper let us rejoice and be glad and give honor for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready hallelujah when the word unites with the person the two become one i like how he says it's improving his word then what does it do when the two have become one what does it do it manifests the son of man again not church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one oh brother listen i thought brother branham was the holy one that was to reveal the son of man he started the process but you must become the word in order for the son of man to be revealed in this day and this hour in this church in your life he's the son of man christ the word he comes down and whatever the son of man done the church does the same thing when jesus was here what did he do he healed the sick he raised the dead they laid hands on people he restored highs he restored bodies back again he raised jarius's daughter that same lord jesus i declare to you this lord is in the building he is here he will do anything you can believe for [Applause] he's here elijah's god's with us today hope you don't mind a couple of quotes this morning i know you're believers so you won't mind them had one woman say well if i if i wanted to well anyhow she said i can read at home but it ain't the same when god begins placing things together that's why you come together there's gifts that's in the body one man has a gift to pull this out another man has a gift to pull the head out and you put the whole thing together and you bring your lick of fire together you know what happens when you come and bring your licks of fire the prophet of god said it brings back the fullness of the pillar of fire could i declare to you this morning he's here the pillar of fire is here the angel of the lord is here brother said we should realize that it's in us has been given we believe who in jesus christ's been filled with the spirit quickening power that power's in you by laying on hands on others like the disciples did down through the age it absolutely healed the sick raised the dead and it showed visions and prophecies this is what happened when he came it showed visions it showed prophecies it healed the sick it raised the dead and the very same spirit that lived among the early apostles is living in the church today working the very same thing proving the son of man is here listen i didn't declare he was here but the scripture declared he was here william branham declared he was here and that's good enough for me no matter how it's working if it's working in me if it's working in andrew if it's working brother ron or one of your brother matt or whoever it may be you've got to recognize and believe it or it ain't going to do us one bit of good huh but the moment you believe it your troubles have ended projections that mean i'm going gonna have no more battles that's not what he said but now you're on the wedding side you know in whom you have believed well jason wood i just don't see god moving anymore you're blind you are blind and may god open your eyes today now i have heard but now i see the prophet god said he goes now we find in these hours of real stress that's usually when the spirit of god moves in he let the hebrew children walk right up and go right into the fire he let daniel step right into the lion's den he let the disciples be almost out there and almost drowned he he let jurassic's daughter actually die he let lazarus go by the way of the grave but then the grave riser come on the scene he'll allow these things to happen understand now listen to what the prophet said but when he moved he moves when god gets ready to move he moves and he walks up to the tomb of lazarus and he tells him roll back the stone and then he speaks lazarus come forth with andrew such power and that voice if he hadn't identified who it was the whole resurrection would have took place he identified who it was that's what happened with the message today when they come it personally identified each and every one of us and he said there in the first seal i believe or in the breach he said i no longer call you church but i call you bride that you might understand he identified who you are you're not just the church you're the bride you're the lamb's wife well glory well jason but i don't feel like the lamb's wife since when did this become a game of feelings have you ever felt like sometimes you wouldn't saved you can be honest sometimes you feel you ever felt like you're the only one elijah felt like he was the only one to god opened his you ever felt like you was in a spiritual desert and you couldn't hardly get a prayer through you ever feel like that sometimes everybody's against you including your wife or your husband or the whoever it might you feel that way sometimes but that's the devil making you feel that way but you are the spotless virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ if the church could only today reflect what it was at the original pentecost jesus reflected what he was to be he was reflected through all the prophets and it comes down to this day who are we going to be reflecting i remember the first sermon i ever preached i preached on reflection it was 11 minutes i had four pages of notes i thought dear lord jesus it's going to take me a long time to get through these 11 minutes i beat andrew but you it's not about how long the sermon is it's about what the content is huh prophet of god said in one place probably the most effective sermon paul ever preached was about 20 minutes i plan on going longer in 20 minutes but whatever the lord wants us to do that's where we want to be found at don't get concerned with the time if it's an hour and 20 minutes or 20 minutes the thing about it is is did jesus come by and if the word came forward and jesus come by it will change lives hallelujah and when the great power of the living god comes into a son of god it quickens him and life enters into him it's not in one day he will be a son of god he already is a son of god and if you're part of the bride you're part of the bridegroom brother yes i'm afraid i'm gonna miss the rapture if you're a part of the bride you'll not miss the rapture whatever it takes god to get you ready you cannot miss the part that you are if the holy ghost is in you you'll do exactly what's predicted for our day for you to do my brother ram said she won't be a lukewarm we're not going to be lukewarm no but we're going to be on fire for god we're going to be moving in the spirit of god we're going to be letting the word come to pass in our life we're going to become the very word that's on the page just let it take on life you don't have to make the promises come to pass if you try to make the promises of god come to pass you'll have a mess sarah tried to make the promise come to pass ah she it was a supernatural promise and she handpicked hagar for the promise to come to pass through but in doing that she made a perversion out of it listen let's not pervert the gospel of jesus christ but let's just live the word of god and the bible said these signs shall follow them that believe he'll bring him to pass you ain't got to try to do it there ain't nothing you can do about it well who can add one inch to his stature who can change one thing about himself who can make the holy ghost come into service who can make the pillar of fire visible you can't but god can you know he was like there was a all back through luther and wesley and pentecost they were carriers of the seed were getting to a rapture they were they were building it up see they were a vital importance you can't do away with justification you can't do away with sanctification you can't do away with those things but there had to come a time when the seed would produce itself again and it's happened in this day glory he's the same yesterday today and forever and the same pillar of fire is here showing the same signs and the same power and the same miracles vindicating the bible the word of god in this day he is the vindicator program said in god's provided place of worship he said do you realize that you've been raised from death into life you've been baptized into the body by the living god that's quick in your body where there's tongues where there's interpretation of tongues seeing jesus christ manifested among us why sickness couldn't stand in such a group are we that kind of group yeah we're that kind of group this morning sickness can't stand in that kind of group brother jason but brother ron's been sick a long time yeah just about a year but i can tell you in a moment's time god can transform the entire body and bring a complete restoration to it [Applause] program said let go let your faith go to heal and believe and say lord i believe it with all of my heart and you will be made well that's a promise and if that promise was good in 1965 when it was priest or whenever it was preached there yeah 1965 it's good today because he's the same yesterday today and forever it's the same grain it's the same seed again that went in the ground the james jesus and bradford is here today doing the same works with the same power and the same church and the same word forming up and getting ready for a rapture what's it going to take brother jason the word to be manifested in our lives and when the word becomes manifested in your life and my life and my kid's life huh we're believing for every one of them an entire word of god is made complete and it's moving in the people listen in jesus christ god made me pay for my sins in him he rose i rose with him when he arose hallelujah and we are setting seating together in heavenly places with power and authority over every devil ever devil is subject to the bride of jesus christ these are more than just words these are powerful statements if we'll take them and believe them put it into action i love this part i read this that brother andrew coming to church i said oh if you could only believe what god has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you are seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you do god has ordained us in this hour to be sons and daughters of god he ordained gifts in your life he ordained gifts in brother ron's life and his gifts aren't like my gifts and my gifts aren't like your gifts but it's to edify it's to build up and when one of us suffer we all suffer and when one gets honored we all glory in it bro jason god don't do miracles much anymore just hold it right there maybe somebody's watching on the internet and they haven't seen god do a miracle stand come here here's a miracle right here here's a miracle for those of you who have never seen a miracle here's a man that fell 40 foot broke every vertebrae in his body and his back walked out of the hospital that night here's a man that's been bitten by copperheads and still alive here's a man that's had heart attacks and still alive he's had two strokes and still alive his blood pressure goes through the roof sometimes and he's still here his sugar goes so low he can't hardly survive he's still here it goes so high he should be in a coma but he's still here he was burning a fire but he's still here and cancer cannot destroy the body not even cancer we shall see miracles we are witnessing them every day prophecy went forth in 1960 brother said there will be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people he didn't say him he said you that the holy spirit would so anoint you how many use arthur i'm part of the people he's going to so anoint me till i'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there and he didn't say it's just going to come into the church he said and it is now coming into the church say unto this mountain be thou removed huh he said them the critics miles will be hushed well jason i'm just expecting missing limbs to happen that's fine i got greater expectation than just a missing limb we need bodies restored we need homes restored we need families restored we need spiritual storms spoke out of existence we need the elf shady eye to cover the blaster board and give strength in her bodies we need some of us need complete restoration in our bodies he's here and it's not canceled but a lot of things canceled this year youth count was cancelled all the other meetings were canceled labor day was canceled and the devil tried to cancel this weekend but god goes this one ain't going to be canceled i've got a purpose for this weekend i got a purpose to come down and bring somebody from arkansas to come down here to preach to a group in virginia i don't know why god brought me here but i'm here and whatever your need is you reach out and touch him he's passing by don't miss your day of visitation it's not canceled cove would cancel a lot of things canceled our churches weeks and months some of us went without church the devil goes cancel i'm beating them down i'm canceling them but somewhere in your prayer closet somewhere in your study and in your office you still got a hold of god the devil might have closed the doors for a temporary time but he didn't close your heart up the devil can't close that communication hook i told the church back home take away my bible take away my tapes take away all my message books but there's one thing you can't take away you cannot take away the god that's not on the inside of me because it didn't come from me it came from god [Applause] i was thinking about brother caleb the other day there in prison no bible no books and he's still winning muslims to christ because the bible's not here it's here the message wasn't here it became here and when the word comes down on the inside of you and you begin to make it live it changes your world it changes everything about you man my wife we're listening to some songs from brother tim's uh 2019 october meetings and brother ron that's when he preached take it back i play that clip a lot saved it on my phone take it back there was a man already eat up with cancer didn't even know it preaching to himself take it back preaching to the bride take it back my wife made this comment she goes i'd give anything to be able to do this again to sit in meetings like this again i'd do anything and i begin to think for a moment will we ever will we ever be able to have special meetings like that again we don't know could we have let the precious moments pass by and discard it as just another meeting brother i wonder how many were in that meeting that just it was just another meeting we're coming back next year but there wasn't another time legitimate you come every november you'll be back next year we may not be here next year we may be in glory next year have we just let it pass us by and it's just become another church service we don't know church we may not be able to have church next sunday we're not given another sunday we're not given another day a promise of it but we do know one thing if there is no next sunday morning service or saturday night service you can still yet be in service with christ regardless of where you are meetings may have all be canceled this year but i want to remind you of another meeting and this meeting i'm talking about covet will never cancel this meeting viruses will never cancel this meeting the government will never cancel this meeting there is going to be a meeting in the air and i'm going to be one of them i'm going to be there how many is going with me when god moves he moves god's able to move this virus right out and obliviate it god's able to make it where we can have meetings again but that's his his doing the most important thing is is we're ready when he calls when he comes let us be ready i'm standing on the side of a pond bank last september and i was fishing i was getting it was a saturday afternoon or morning whichever it was and i was praying and we're just how can you pray and fish while i wasn't catching many fish but i was praying and i'm fishing a little bit and i'm talking to the lord lord what would you have me say to your people tomorrow my notes were all finished i was ready but what would you have me say i don't want it just to be notes so you could have a notebook full of notes but until he comes that's all it is is notes and i was sitting there and i said lord what would you have me say to your people and out of my voice i've heard myself speak it tell them i'm coming i'm coming amen well i knew right then that was scriptural so i get to church i tell them what happened man we had a service a couple of months ago by after that and brother timothy puts over in belgium preaching and at the end of the service i heard this lady screaming but i couldn't make out what she was saying so i text him after the service i said what was that girl saying he said she was screaming i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming well jason we've known that for 50 years but do you really know do you know how close it really is i'm coming what's he coming for a rapture to take his bride home how are we going to be ready washed by the water of the word we got to be in the word every day lord god let me be ready when you come let me be anticipating it let me be lord let it be my daily focus let me rise up in the morning lord is this the day young people i know sometimes many of them think well you know i need to get married i want to have a family let me tell you if the rapture takes place and you're in it you'll still be with your mate don't worry about it god's got it all in control the problem is as we get so caught up that we we last aside what's most important listen church i'm trying to tell you this one this gospel is more important to you this morning than your daily bread it's got to be the most important thing there is we're trying to get out of here in a body change and trying to get a new life can i tell you something this morning that the angel of the lord's done been seen in this service he's sovereign he's here he's already been seen not only has he been seen but i feel him here right now your pastor come back told me he said i seen him here and he said that he's not what you're saying at the most there's a presence here i'm trying to build your atmosphere build the atmosphere for something he's here whatever your need is all you have to do is ask him i kind of feel like brother biscuit did that time brother hongman when the angel of the lord sat down here in the vehicle with him and brother brad and you just was afraid to move you feel that he's here what's he gonna do brother jay said i don't know but i believe he has a mandate to be here and i believe god's gonna do the supernatural this morning and i believe there's gonna be bodies healed and bodies restored this morning i believe there's going to be homes restored this morning there's going to be lives restored there's going to be families there's going to be children restored this morning let me prophesy to you this morning you let this day be a remembrance in your book november the 8th 2020 as a supernatural visitation from almighty god he's here this morning to give you the very desires of your heart the bible says if thou cast believe all things are possible he's here well jason boy i i need a sign he's here he said it right here two or three would agree on anything in my name i'll be in their midst he's here what's he wanting to do it's okay if i walk down here what's he wanting to do walk about every aisle fan every hour with his presence huh he's coming through the building now i'm not the angel of the lord but he's here and he's coming through the building to change lives and to change hearts and to touch bodies and to heal people and to give them the desires of their heart oh he's here what's he trying to do brother jason he's trying to raise your faith to the level for a rapture and get you ready for a body change he's wanting your faith to take a step up this morning and you know what healings of the body to us and restoration of bodies does it builds our faith we could open a testimony service here and be here all day but the thing about this is today's a new day testimonies of years gone by are great but show me what he's doing today he's alive this morning he's in our lives this morning he's here to manifest himself this morning the son of man is here to come amongst us and lead us and guide us and protect us and keep us and let us walk in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake david said yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for die with me thyroid and thy staff they comfort me and now prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies and thou known as my head with oil the spirit my cup runneth over and surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever listen church he's raising our faith up this morning to produce a rapture rumor said it's going to take humility it's going to take righteousness it's going to take regenerated consecrated lives brother brown said it's going to take a lot of honing down for me i read that i thought my lord what's it going to take for me bro man if it takes a lot of honing down for the prophet what about us whatever it is god get us ready lord let us be ready whatever you want out of us this morning god let us be willing and ready lord if you want to reveal yourself and do the supernatural have your way this morning in our lives god i know this group has seen the supernatural so many times but don't let it grow common to you there's been lives given babies given how much more can god do and you not believe there's two babies right over here brother david it's just the way they wasn't supposed to be there when you married her you were she was never supposed to be able to have a baby but god took a took a womb that was in chaos and brought honor to it why can't he do this morning in your life now there's two little beautiful children that's changed these grandparents and families lives and he's still here and the same god that brought order to that womb can bring order to your body and restore it 100 this morning till on wednesday the doctors will be astonished whatever organ come back to order whatever pet the pancreas in their adrenal glands and let every bit of the chaos leave may i say this this morning let every bit of chaos leave in our lives in our families in our homes may the holy ghost be so real among us that it changes our very desires oh spirit of the living god come amongst our lives brother jason my husband's cotton pornography and my wife's cotton all kinds of lifestyles my children are hung up in this or that let order come you speak the word you let it be created huh the holy ghost is in you you have the authority to use it say well it's just for the ministers no it's not just for the ministers it's to him that believes these signs shall follow them that's a minister no these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover who was it that when you lost your job god miraculously gave it back to you who was it when you couldn't pay your bills they miraculously got paid we had a brother and sister in our church he'd been in a wreck and broke his neck and couldn't work for he was in rehab for six months in atlanta you know the brother and he couldn't walk he was paralyzed from here down told he'd be a quad the rest of his life and when he got to atlanta to the good shepherd rehab center he told the doctors they said you need to learn to accept you'll never be able to walk again he looked at me said i'll walk out of this place they said well whatever he said i'm telling you i'll walk out of this place six months later the doctors and nurses lined up and cried as the man walked out of the building yeah he had a cage but he still walked [Applause] and during that time they didn't have any income and the bank account never went down and all the bills were paid now you tell me who did that brother jason maybe he used an individual still god still got to be able to afford two households that's the power of god and there's just another little bitty simple thing some of you think it's simple that goes with it but when he was laying there his hands were so swelled he tried to raise up and he knew something was wrong excuse me his hands were so swelled they had to cut his wedding band off and they lost it in memphis and sister rebecca got to pray and lord i mean it's just a wedding band but you still there's memories there and they called him one day and said mr perez we have your some articles of clothing and things that belong to you here he's like okay good but i ain't driving to memphis to get him i don't feel like driving to memphis his wife says we need to go to memphis and get him anyhow they made it to memphis to get him and when they opened up the baggage there was his ring never cut four or five times the nurses tried to kill him in memphis they hated him and they they would do stuff to him to agitate him and his wife had pinned the prayer cloth on him and they'd take it off and she walked in one morning and he started crashing he started coding and she just reached over and she put that prayer cloth on the bottom of his foot and the heart rate went three or four times it happened it's because he's god he's god and god is a god of restoration he's listen church he can restore families he can restore homes he can restore jobs he could restore jarius's daughter when she was dead even the roman centurio just speak the word when i get home my child will be well it'll be just like you said jesus said i ain't found so much faith in all of israel just speak the word what did that quote say there's coming of power in the church to where and it is now he said where they'll just speak the word and it'll be created he said it i believe it roses you think god can do that i know god can do that when brother andrew was at the church last year we had during that month of may or june we had 20-something miracles when him and brother ron was there take place 20-something miracles he prayed for a man with states for cancer and god has healed him all right you think god is no respecter person if he could pray for a man with stage 4 cancer could we not pray for him with stage 4 cancer and get the same results because he's the same lord jesus will glory huh these signs shall follow them that believe and yes there was a man healed of states for cancer and there was a lady healed of of eyes that were double vision and it was just on and on and on but there was another miracle the greatest miracle as god restored my church when the devil set out to destroy it and tried to cause division because of something that had happened that was out of my control but god rich in mercy brother on that saturday night and sunday morning god used your pastor to save my church and how may that same lord jesus be able to return the favor this morning brother andrew not to save the church but may god use these hands this morning to be able to lay upon that man and give him a complete restoration that's the kind of god he is he's real where is he real at brother jason he's real of my soul i know he's alive and this word lives and i quoted last night the prophet of god said only the believer can make it live i don't care what the naysayer says i'm a believer i don't care what the devil says i'm a believer i don't care what anybody declares i am a believer and i believe this bible from cover to cover and i believe the cover of it and i believe the quotes from 1947 to 1965 i believe all the word [Applause] and because we are believers then we do what believers do we just believe he's here he's here brother davey who was it that restored you to where you can work again it's god what's he doing that for giving you faith for a rapture because if he had faith to raise brother david help if he had that faith to raise himself up listen he's got faith to raise him up again he'll have faith to change his body glory brother if you had faith to bring you out of sin where you were god you'll have enough faith to make the rapture listen god will drop down down in there brother jonathan from where you come from you weren't raised in this message probably never heard of it but you met sister autumn the same faith that's got you this far is the same faith that'll take you to the rest of the way you ain't got to look for another gospel you ain't got to look for another jesus the real jesus is in the house the real jesus is here i declare this morning he's in the house [Applause] death has to flee don't you come play that song sis musicians come this morning he's in the house he's here he wants to move this morning you say brother jason i have a need of my body just lift your hand to him he's mindful of you i'm gonna ask you to do something this morning as i go down and pray for brother ron as she plays this song he's in the house you keep your hand raised up toward this way and you believe with all your heart that god will come today and do the miraculous and wednesday when they do the test thursday friday whenever they get the results you'll be shouting on this mountain we believe brothers laid will be a different place [Music] this body's going to be restored we believe this morning in the name of the lord jesus heavenly father i laid my hands in this prayer cloth on my buddy brother rod lord you see the man that he once was god his strength is all gone yes lord he still can get here but god is he needs you this morning god as i lay my hands on him this morning may the same lord jesus that brought restoration to my church bring restoration to his body this morning may every part of his body go back to normal adrenal glands come
