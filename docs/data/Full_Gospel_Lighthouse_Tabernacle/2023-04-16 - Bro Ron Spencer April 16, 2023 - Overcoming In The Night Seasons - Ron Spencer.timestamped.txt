[50:07] we've got a few things to do before
[50:09] preaching this morning we have a baby
[50:11] dedication
[50:13] and it's always a great thing for us and
[50:17] Little Miss Everly Grace
[50:19] came into the world and where church is
[50:22] growing brother Brandon and sister
[50:24] Catherine
[50:26] die that's blessed that God has blessed
[50:28] their family she's eight pounds and
[50:31] three ounces and so
[50:33] man she's already a pound bigger than I
[50:36] was when I was born so
[50:40] any others any other people that was
[50:43] born on March the 8th
[50:45] March the 8th so she's got her own
[50:48] birthday
[50:49] that's a nice thing
[50:51] I was reading over some of the
[50:54] characteristics of the March 8th baby
[50:55] and I found them kind of interesting
[51:00] they're original
[51:03] nobody's quite like them
[51:06] they enjoy spending time surrounded by
[51:10] people who are talented as themselves
[51:14] they also take time to observe what is
[51:16] going on around them and
[51:18] in their human personality and nature of
[51:21] activity
[51:25] they cannot be more annoyed
[51:28] by people with small minds
[51:33] I must have been born on this day
[51:37] they enjoy artsy Enterprises
[51:42] and show their potential that they can
[51:44] be quite charitable as well
[51:47] they're optimistic they're accepting
[51:50] they're generous
[51:52] they're people who are set to change the
[51:54] world
[51:55] although when young they might seem
[51:57] adventurous
[51:59] and quickly distracted
[52:02] and eventually they will gain eventually
[52:05] they will gain more insight and put
[52:08] their mark on the world
[52:11] I find sometimes by reading those things
[52:13] that if you read yours in what hour that
[52:17] you're born it kind of tells your life
[52:19] story
[52:22] in Deuteronomy chapter 6
[52:27] it said hero Israel the Lord our God is
[52:30] one Lord
[52:33] and thou shalt love
[52:35] the Lord with all thine heart
[52:38] and with all thy soul
[52:40] and with all thy might
[52:42] and these words which I command thee
[52:45] this day shall be in thine heart
[52:47] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[52:50] unto thy children and shall talk
[52:53] to them when thou sittest in thine house
[52:56] and when thy walkest in thy way
[52:59] and when thy lie us down and when they
[53:01] riseth up and thou shall bind them
[53:05] for a sign and unto thy hand
[53:07] and they shall be frontlets between
[53:10] their eyes
[53:12] two people begin to date begin to love
[53:14] one another a married a man marries a
[53:17] wife and then we sin begin to see what
[53:21] the character that's on the inside of
[53:23] him
[53:23] they become a joint unit
[53:26] and then two become one
[53:28] and then two becomes three
[53:35] now that baby is an extension of their
[53:37] lives
[53:39] they take on responsibilities now life
[53:42] is more than about themselves
[53:45] they're not the boss of their home
[53:52] they tell you when to get up
[53:54] they tell you when you need to eat
[53:57] they tell you
[54:00] what they like and what they don't like
[54:04] and they're their own little person
[54:09] but they're also a part of God
[54:13] Amen brother Brandon sister Catherine
[54:16] your family all of you would like to
[54:18] come
[54:19] amen

[1:05:51] Edwards amen God bless you God bless you
[1:05:55] amen
[1:06:00] Give the Lord a good hand
[1:06:11] isn't God good
[1:06:14] amen I believe there's a testimony of
[1:06:16] service that's going to take place at
[1:06:18] the youth meeting this evening
[1:06:20] amen if you'd like to
[1:06:22] I'm personally I'm going to try my best
[1:06:24] to be there to hear those testimonies
[1:06:27] that took place there every person has
[1:06:29] their own testimony of what they saw
[1:06:31] what they felt if you didn't feel
[1:06:33] anything you still knew he was there and
[1:06:35] so God gave us strength to be able to be
[1:06:38] a part of that meeting and it took me
[1:06:40] the week to try to get over it and we're
[1:06:43] praying this morning I woke up and felt
[1:06:45] like all the strength of my body had
[1:06:47] just left and so we're here
[1:06:50] we're here and so amen sister Katie has
[1:06:54] a saying for me
[1:06:56] and I try to walk two miles every
[1:06:58] morning on the treadmill and she says
[1:06:59] you're lapping everybody's sitting on a
[1:07:01] couch
[1:07:09] Brother David spoke last night and you
[1:07:11] know sometimes I don't think that we
[1:07:13] realize what's going on
[1:07:17] sometimes we don't capture it sometimes
[1:07:19] we miss the moment when it's happening
[1:07:22] but brother branham's vision
[1:07:25] of the Bride around the world
[1:07:29] Brother David played a part of that last
[1:07:31] night coming from Belgium
[1:07:34] his grandfather 52 years ago
[1:07:37] stood at brother fulchers and I as a
[1:07:39] little boy about 10 years old
[1:07:43] stood and listened to him preach and I
[1:07:45] still remember him and here we are
[1:07:49] 52 years later
[1:07:53] and the sermon that you heard last night
[1:07:55] he didn't tell you but God spoke to him
[1:07:57] that he would be preaching that sermon
[1:08:02] months ago
[1:08:04] when these Arrangements wasn't made that
[1:08:07] he'd be standing here preaching in that
[1:08:09] service
[1:08:10] and so that didn't come from the mind of
[1:08:13] a man
[1:08:16] that came from God
[1:08:19] and your long-awaited
[1:08:22] question
[1:08:24] the answers on the way
[1:08:28] and so as I sat and thought about all
[1:08:31] the long-awaited questions
[1:08:35] that we thought will it ever happen will
[1:08:38] it ever take place will we ever get an
[1:08:40] answer to it it's on the way
[1:08:44] it's on the way
[1:08:46] and God sent his servant here
[1:08:51] a pastor
[1:08:52] a man that's been through great
[1:08:54] difficulties
[1:08:56] and uh great trials
[1:08:59] and he's still standing
[1:09:02] sometimes we only get a glimpse of a
[1:09:04] man's life when he stands and preaches
[1:09:06] to us an hour and we only get a glimpse
[1:09:08] of his life but what you're seeing is a
[1:09:11] victory of many years many trials many
[1:09:15] dark paths
[1:09:17] and he's still standing
[1:09:20] it could have been an easier way he
[1:09:23] could have stayed on a public job and
[1:09:25] could have done a lot of things and
[1:09:27] could have been quite successful in life
[1:09:29] but he chose the Narrow Path
[1:09:33] and so we thank you we thank you for
[1:09:35] Brother David coming and being a part of
[1:09:37] that service last night and and we love
[1:09:41] him with all of our hearts and you carry
[1:09:44] our love home he's a general he's a
[1:09:47] general and I how I know he's a general
[1:09:49] I sat at a table with him
[1:09:51] one morning early and the Lord spoke
[1:09:54] into my ears and regardless of what you
[1:09:56] thought about yourself God spoke to me
[1:09:58] many years ago and said this is one of
[1:10:01] my generals
[1:10:02] amen Give the Lord a good hand
[1:10:14] Hallelujah
[1:10:16] now
[1:10:17] they have interpreted many sermons of
[1:10:19] brother branham's and uh
[1:10:23] he actually carried the stick that had
[1:10:25] 400 and some messages on it and got it
[1:10:28] on the Hub at musk at much risk and it
[1:10:33] much pressure against him to do it
[1:10:36] but he made sure that the Dutch people
[1:10:38] could hear the message in their own
[1:10:40] language and
[1:10:42] how important is that
[1:10:44] how important is that all right so I'm
[1:10:47] going to give you a little example here
[1:10:49] of Brother David speaking in Dutch
[1:10:54] and so if you'll come and
[1:10:56] you'll interpret for me and so what what
[1:10:58] happens is this
[1:11:00] I speak in English
[1:11:02] and then he speaks in Dutch and then I'm
[1:11:05] going to speak in Dutch
[1:11:11] okay so he says what I say and so yeah
[1:11:17] I'm a general
[1:11:22] from Belgium
[1:11:25] I come because I love you
[1:11:29] and I mean it with all my heart and
[1:11:33] and brother Ron is going to come and
[1:11:35] preach for us soon
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:54] I didn't tell him what I was going to
[1:11:56] say
[1:12:00] and God bless you Brother David
[1:12:02] I so love you with all my heart
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:26] what a day
[1:12:29] what a day that will be
[1:12:38] I'm honored that you would come
[1:12:40] deeply honored
[1:12:46] if you could stand with me this morning
[1:12:52] I hope you have time to listen to me
[1:12:53] preach for a little while
[1:12:58] I've been working on this for a bit
[1:13:02] but it's about you
[1:13:04] overcoming
[1:13:06] in the night season
[1:13:10] I know you're against a you're up
[1:13:12] against a lot of things
[1:13:14] and you're you're in the midst of a lot
[1:13:16] of trouble
[1:13:17] but God called you to overcome
[1:13:21] in darkness
[1:13:24] brother Branham couldn't see past 1977.
[1:13:29] and God held it that way
[1:13:31] and if you remember in the church ages
[1:13:34] and the seals he draws in a little light
[1:13:38] because it was total darkness and God
[1:13:41] allowed him to draw in a little bit of
[1:13:43] light and that was you
[1:13:46] and we realize that we're pressing
[1:13:48] against the darkness and brother Branham
[1:13:51] says that it is the darkest
[1:13:54] just before the dawn
[1:13:57] it's cause the darkness is congelling
[1:14:00] together
[1:14:01] it's gathering together brother Branham
[1:14:03] makes statements he said especially
[1:14:05] during the prayer line he said Spirits
[1:14:08] would call out all over the building he
[1:14:10] said there'd be dark lines running all
[1:14:11] over the building those cancer Devils or
[1:14:14] those epileptic devils are screaming for
[1:14:17] help
[1:14:18] and so they'll start put pulling
[1:14:20] together one to another trying to get
[1:14:23] strength to not have to leave but God's
[1:14:27] greater
[1:14:29] God's greater than all the darkness that
[1:14:33] you're fighting
[1:14:35] and just to kind of give you a little
[1:14:36] background
[1:14:37] those those 12 Spies that went into the
[1:14:42] land ten of them came back with an evil
[1:14:45] report
[1:14:47] it's too dark for us it's too bad for us
[1:14:50] to go over there but two came back
[1:14:55] two come back
[1:14:57] and they begin to try to steal the
[1:14:59] people because Caleb was a had a
[1:15:02] different Spirit on him
[1:15:04] and he's still the people sure there
[1:15:06] were giants sure there was a lot of
[1:15:08] obstacles in the way he said but we're
[1:15:10] more than able
[1:15:12] we're more than able it's our promise
[1:15:16] we will have a resurrection
[1:15:21] there will be a bride
[1:15:27] there will be a body change
[1:15:32] right in the midst of all of this
[1:15:34] Darkness
[1:15:36] amen amen
[1:15:39] Psalms chapter 27 and verse 1.
[1:15:43] amen let's just talk to him for a moment
[1:15:45] Lord Jesus I feel your presence here at
[1:15:48] this this
[1:15:50] stage just now
[1:15:53] oh what a powerful presence
[1:15:56] now I ask you that it would go all over
[1:15:59] this audience
[1:16:01] that every person man woman boy and girl
[1:16:04] would feel this
[1:16:05] and give us strength and encourage us
[1:16:08] encourage
[1:16:09] forgive us of our sins and our mistakes
[1:16:11] our humanities
[1:16:13] are thinking
[1:16:15] Lord we're so small-minded in our
[1:16:17] thinking sometimes but help the spirit
[1:16:20] of God to lift our faith and our courage
[1:16:22] like never before if we set a word out
[1:16:26] of place if we've had an attitude out of
[1:16:28] place
[1:16:29] forgive us father
[1:16:31] there let us kiss your feet today let us
[1:16:34] worship you as the word Goes Forth
[1:16:36] anoint the word anoint our hearts anoint
[1:16:39] our minds anoint this people we ask you
[1:16:42] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:16:48] amen the Lord is my light and my
[1:16:50] salvation
[1:16:51] Whom Shall I Fear
[1:16:53] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[1:16:56] whom shall I be afraid
[1:16:58] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:17:00] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:17:02] they stumbled and fell
[1:17:05] though a host shouldn't Camp against me
[1:17:07] my heart shall not fear though War
[1:17:11] should rise against me in this will I be
[1:17:13] confident one thing that I have desired
[1:17:16] of the Lord that will I seek after that
[1:17:19] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:17:22] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:17:25] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[1:17:27] read this next scripture with me for in
[1:17:31] the time of trouble he shall hide me in
[1:17:35] his Pavilion and in the secret of his
[1:17:37] Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall
[1:17:40] set me upon a rock you may be seated
[1:17:52] Isaiah 53 and verse 5.
[1:17:56] but he was wounded
[1:17:59] for our transgressions
[1:18:02] he was bruised
[1:18:04] for our iniquity
[1:18:07] brother Branham said if you'd have been
[1:18:09] the only one lost he would have came
[1:18:12] quite a statement isn't it
[1:18:14] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:18:18] him and with his stripes
[1:18:22] we are healed
[1:18:25] Revelations chapter 3 the darkest age of
[1:18:28] all the seven Church ages
[1:18:31] it's an age to which that Jesus was put
[1:18:33] on the outside of the church and the
[1:18:36] church has become Ichabod the spirit of
[1:18:39] the Lord is departed from it we can
[1:18:41] especially see it today
[1:18:45] he's not welcome in their Church
[1:18:47] the word is not welcome
[1:18:52] our governments
[1:18:54] he's not welcome
[1:18:56] in our governments anymore
[1:19:00] but there's going to be a people in this
[1:19:02] Dark Age that hear the message of the
[1:19:05] hour
[1:19:07] to him that overcometh
[1:19:12] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:19:15] Revelations 3 21.
[1:19:18] to sit with me in my throne
[1:19:20] even as I also overcame
[1:19:25] and I'm sat down with my father
[1:19:28] in Hip throne
[1:19:30] I want you to read that with me again to
[1:19:33] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:19:37] with me in my throne
[1:19:39] even as I also overcame and was set down
[1:19:43] with my father
[1:19:45] in his throne
[1:19:48] we realized that the message has already
[1:19:51] been delivered
[1:19:53] and there's nothing the devil can do to
[1:19:55] stop it
[1:19:58] you are the living physical attributes
[1:20:02] of God
[1:20:04] that baby that we just dedicated just a
[1:20:07] few moments ago it was once a thought
[1:20:11] and then it began to materialize in a
[1:20:14] womb but now it's made manifest it is
[1:20:18] the physical thoughts
[1:20:20] that God had before the foundation of
[1:20:23] the world
[1:20:25] it would be like the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:20:27] that name was written there and now it's
[1:20:31] displayed
[1:20:32] Satan's tried to stop it so many times
[1:20:35] because of the potential that that baby
[1:20:39] has as an overcomer
[1:20:41] especially a little girl grow up and
[1:20:44] dress right and live right and act right
[1:20:47] and has a character of Jesus Christ
[1:20:49] Living in spite
[1:20:53] in spite of all the devil tries to stop
[1:21:00] brother Branham called you not brother
[1:21:02] Branham but God behind it called you the
[1:21:05] final voice
[1:21:07] to the final age
[1:21:10] called you an invincible Army
[1:21:13] he called you ambassadors
[1:21:15] representative for the king
[1:21:18] you're not just a church
[1:21:21] but you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:25] in Geneva Switzerland there's great
[1:21:28] people that are powerful that gather
[1:21:29] together from all over the world they're
[1:21:32] some of the most powerful people but let
[1:21:34] me just say this to you they have
[1:21:35] nothing on the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:39] you're the most powerful people that
[1:21:41] there is
[1:21:43] as it was said last night
[1:21:45] on on in the book of Acts chapter 3 the
[1:21:49] devil was all relaxed in his bed brother
[1:21:52] Branham would even say he was relaxed in
[1:21:55] his bread thousands received the Holy
[1:21:58] Ghost
[1:21:59] but when those disciples went by a man
[1:22:02] that was lame and they said Silver and
[1:22:05] Gold Have I None but such as I have give
[1:22:09] I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise
[1:22:12] up and walk
[1:22:14] it was now more if I can say it this way
[1:22:17] now it's more than books and tapes and
[1:22:19] pictures on a wall
[1:22:22] now it's overcoming vessels taking the
[1:22:26] message and letting it live
[1:22:28] as long as this message stays in book
[1:22:31] form the devil don't have much problem
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:36] as long as it stays in tape form the
[1:22:38] devil don't have no problem but listen
[1:22:40] when you start overcoming
[1:22:45] and then he knows the Rapture is already
[1:22:48] on the way not just someday but it's
[1:22:50] already in process
[1:22:53] you've been lifted from denomination
[1:22:55] you've been lifted from sin
[1:22:58] you've been lifted you're risen again in
[1:23:01] Jesus Christ and God begins to show the
[1:23:05] dependentials that are on the gene seed
[1:23:07] in your life and regardless of all the
[1:23:10] darkness around you
[1:23:14] you're illuminated by the word of God
[1:23:17] and Satanist did everything that he can
[1:23:20] to stop you
[1:23:21] [Music]
[1:23:25] that's right sure we're in a fight but
[1:23:28] we're going to win
[1:23:29] [Applause]
[1:23:32] every one of you will fight different
[1:23:34] circumstances of your life
[1:23:36] but if you can read the back of the book
[1:23:40] we're going to win
[1:23:42] you may have come this morning and you
[1:23:44] may be going through the deepest darkest
[1:23:46] Trials of your life but you're going to
[1:23:49] win I got some really good news for you
[1:23:51] you're gonna win now
[1:24:00] you're gonna have to fight every day
[1:24:02] when will the fight be over
[1:24:05] seconds before the rapture
[1:24:09] but you're not going to fight by Who You
[1:24:11] Are
[1:24:12] and you're not going to fight by your
[1:24:15] physical abilities or any of your
[1:24:16] talents you're going to overcome by the
[1:24:20] blood of the Lamb
[1:24:22] and the word of your testimony
[1:24:26] you heard the minister say last night
[1:24:28] that you have the power to bind Satan
[1:24:33] but you also have the power to loose him
[1:24:36] how do you loosen by the word of your
[1:24:39] testimony if it becomes negative
[1:24:43] so never allow negativity to go through
[1:24:46] you
[1:24:52] brother Branham had some and I find this
[1:24:55] to be an interesting quote
[1:24:58] he says what a glorious thing that it is
[1:25:00] for his church
[1:25:02] after 1900 years almost 2 000 years
[1:25:08] to know that that he lives
[1:25:13] we meet him on every Bend of the road
[1:25:15] and at every turn
[1:25:17] and every place that we we go we see
[1:25:21] Jesus
[1:25:22] we his we see him living the presence
[1:25:25] flowing like a radiant light from his
[1:25:29] glorious Church of the Living God
[1:25:33] how thankful we ought to be for that
[1:25:36] the message was given at the tomb
[1:25:40] come see
[1:25:42] go tell
[1:25:45] the first thing come and be convinced
[1:25:49] nowadays people don't want to come and
[1:25:51] see
[1:25:53] those who do come
[1:25:56] can't set 10 minutes
[1:26:00] five minutes sometimes and if you cross
[1:26:03] their path they're gone
[1:26:06] come see don't just peep in
[1:26:10] stand and look it over
[1:26:13] come and see
[1:26:15] and then go tell it
[1:26:17] that's what that was what he told the
[1:26:21] women
[1:26:22] that morning at the grave come and see
[1:26:25] where he was laid
[1:26:27] but he's not here no more
[1:26:30] then go tell his disciples that I'll
[1:26:33] meet you over in Galilee go tell who
[1:26:38] his bewildered disciples
[1:26:41] they were certainly bewildered they
[1:26:44] didn't know what to do many of them had
[1:26:46] returned back to their fish nets they
[1:26:49] wanted to go back to catching fish
[1:26:52] they were bewildered because they didn't
[1:26:54] know they didn't know what or how to
[1:26:57] make ends meet
[1:26:59] they had absolutely trusted he was the
[1:27:03] Messiah
[1:27:04] and here he was dead
[1:27:07] and they didn't know what to do now
[1:27:10] but he told them go tell this bewildered
[1:27:15] Church
[1:27:18] that I am alive
[1:27:21] I'll go before them I'll meet them in
[1:27:24] Galilee as I promise to do
[1:27:27] the church bewildered them it's no worse
[1:27:31] than the church today it's still
[1:27:33] bewildered it can't make out the
[1:27:35] Scriptures it cannot understand why that
[1:27:38] Mark 16 was written in the Bible they
[1:27:41] were so bewildered
[1:27:43] they even say it's not inspired
[1:27:48] and they find other scriptures the Holy
[1:27:51] Spirit was applied for maybe another day
[1:27:53] but not this day
[1:27:55] they find other scriptures that says the
[1:27:58] days of Miracles are done
[1:28:01] and they claim that there's no Miracles
[1:28:03] that was only in the past you talk about
[1:28:06] being bewildered
[1:28:09] I'm preaching now
[1:28:11] I'm preaching now they're more than
[1:28:14] bewildered now than they were then
[1:28:18] it's the darkness
[1:28:20] it's the unbelief it's the death cycle
[1:28:23] that's set into the church don't let it
[1:28:27] come into the message
[1:28:31] but something like they was because the
[1:28:35] only thing that those disciples had to
[1:28:37] comfort them was a past experience and
[1:28:41] the church today is a great deal that
[1:28:44] that way even Pentecostals trying to
[1:28:47] satisfy themselves with Acts 2 some past
[1:28:50] experience
[1:28:52] but oh that message of a living God he
[1:28:56] still lives today
[1:28:58] why are you so bewildered
[1:29:03] I go before you
[1:29:05] I'm Not Dead
[1:29:07] but I'm alive
[1:29:10] quite a statement isn't it
[1:29:14] brother Brandon says this he said
[1:29:17] he said I'm a likening God
[1:29:21] so that you won't be mixed up
[1:29:25] and what I've said today God is a great
[1:29:29] diamond
[1:29:31] the eternal
[1:29:33] and when a diamond is brought out of the
[1:29:36] blue stones of Africa
[1:29:38] I've been in the mines and watched them
[1:29:40] in the great how they process and get
[1:29:43] the diamonds out
[1:29:44] he says now they go through the crusher
[1:29:47] and the great blue
[1:29:50] Fire diamonds black diamonds come out
[1:29:54] they have so much not much form
[1:29:58] a certain form and they're they're just
[1:30:01] a great Stone and really they have no
[1:30:04] fire in them at the time they're just a
[1:30:07] diamond
[1:30:08] a stone round smoothed out a lot of them
[1:30:13] but the diamond has to be cut out
[1:30:18] it's against the law to have one of them
[1:30:21] without being cut
[1:30:23] now which he said
[1:30:25] it must be cut
[1:30:27] then you have to have a receipt where
[1:30:30] you bought it because there is millions
[1:30:33] of dollars in them
[1:30:36] I liken God to the great diamond
[1:30:40] he said now diamond is cut so that it
[1:30:44] will reflect what's on the inside of it
[1:30:49] the fire that's in the diamond
[1:30:52] it has to be cut in every little way
[1:30:55] every little shape three points
[1:30:59] put the three points to a diamond and
[1:31:02] the light it gets the three-point object
[1:31:04] will give forth seven different colors
[1:31:08] and make seven different colors he said
[1:31:11] now notice this he said God was wounded
[1:31:14] for our transgressions
[1:31:17] he was bruised for our iniquity he was
[1:31:21] cut he was bruised the great Diamond
[1:31:23] that from him might reflect the gifts of
[1:31:28] God
[1:31:31] no matter how big the diamond
[1:31:34] or how small the diamond it's still
[1:31:37] diamond
[1:31:40] we sometimes looked at the ring on a
[1:31:42] fender
[1:31:44] and if you've got quite a bit of money
[1:31:46] you buy a million dollar ring
[1:31:49] if you got no money
[1:31:51] you go to
[1:31:54] the second hand store
[1:31:58] and you don't tell her
[1:32:01] or maybe you borrow your mother's
[1:32:03] diamond
[1:32:04] or your grandmother's Diamond don't
[1:32:06] laugh at that
[1:32:08] it's a real special thing
[1:32:11] it's a real special thing
[1:32:13] and that diamond reflects that how much
[1:32:16] that you love her
[1:32:18] you know no matter once you get that

[1:39:57] enjoy it
[1:40:03] I'm not going anywhere sister Connie
[1:40:10] if we think about the behind the scenes
[1:40:12] of the message
[1:40:15] brother Branham had great difficulty
[1:40:17] many places that he preached and he
[1:40:20] would be preaching a masterpiece and
[1:40:23] sitting behind him was 300 critical
[1:40:25] preachers
[1:40:28] when brother Branham was here he set he
[1:40:31] said in president's
[1:40:33] uh
[1:40:34] Halls
[1:40:35] he said he said in great great leaders
[1:40:40] he talked about JFK and his wife
[1:40:44] when brother Branham was illuminated
[1:40:46] standing and illuminated the Bride of
[1:40:48] Jesus Christ the background was a
[1:40:52] political world that was falling apart
[1:40:54] John F Kennedy
[1:40:57] Bay of Pigs
[1:41:00] the second world war had just been over
[1:41:02] the Depression had just happened only
[1:41:04] only a decade or so before that before
[1:41:06] the opening of the seals
[1:41:09] The Liberation of women's rights was
[1:41:11] taking place racial movements was taking
[1:41:14] place three kings was on the scene at
[1:41:17] the same time one was Elvis Presley and
[1:41:20] it was open up the rock and roll World
[1:41:23] literally hell was enlarged in itself
[1:41:29] and the only reason it could do that is
[1:41:31] be because the anti-type of that was
[1:41:34] Heaven was opening itself up
[1:41:37] and God was showing all the Mysteries
[1:41:40] time would be no longer where the
[1:41:42] Mysteries would be held up so hell now
[1:41:45] is loosed on the earth against the Bride
[1:41:48] of Jesus Christ Martin Luther King would
[1:41:52] have a message and he would begin to he
[1:41:55] would begin to make a movement and then
[1:41:57] Marcus had uh acts would would come on
[1:42:00] this scene and and literally cause a
[1:42:02] hatred amongst amongst the people
[1:42:06] all Roberts would begin to preach and
[1:42:08] his candle would get lit through the
[1:42:11] prophet Billy Graham who would stand and
[1:42:14] be the pastor to presidents
[1:42:17] and he would stand and give try to keep
[1:42:20] God he would he would try to keep God
[1:42:23] amongst our government
[1:42:25] but our government didn't want God
[1:42:28] if you go back to some of Billy Graham's
[1:42:31] original sermons
[1:42:33] when the angel of God was on the earth
[1:42:35] with brother Branham Billy Graham was in
[1:42:38] joy in that overflow of the Angel's
[1:42:40] presence
[1:42:43] are you with me and they would sing just
[1:42:46] as I am I come to thee and the spirit of
[1:42:49] God would flow down across those
[1:42:51] audiences and tens of thousands were to
[1:42:55] walk to an altar to make a change in
[1:42:57] their life
[1:42:59] are you with me
[1:43:01] but they didn't realize that Billy
[1:43:03] Graham's Ministry could only take them
[1:43:05] so far
[1:43:07] and he would actually complain I I go
[1:43:10] and thirty thousand is delivered next
[1:43:11] year I can't find 30. brother man say
[1:43:14] it's because they didn't have the Holy
[1:43:15] Ghost
[1:43:16] he wasn't taking them far enough let me
[1:43:20] just say this year never come to a spot
[1:43:22] to where you get satisfied
[1:43:25] you stay hungry you stay wanting more of
[1:43:29] God
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:36] Sodom conditions
[1:43:38] was on the scene it was letting loose
[1:43:42] both sides I'm don't get political both
[1:43:46] sides Republican and Democrat
[1:43:49] is embracing transgender
[1:43:53] foreign
[1:43:58] but now they're embracing they'd sell
[1:44:01] their soul to get their mother's vote
[1:44:05] we live in a rotten world
[1:44:08] it's a Sodom world
[1:44:12] to where that even in Washington state
[1:44:14] they allow even little children to make
[1:44:17] their own choice
[1:44:19] and they can take their children out of
[1:44:21] homes so that they can make the
[1:44:24] transition
[1:44:25] what a world we live in
[1:44:28] it's lost its identification
[1:44:31] Abraham lived in that kind of a world
[1:44:34] we see Abraham the great Overcomer the
[1:44:37] father of Faith but the background of
[1:44:39] that he only lived a few miles from
[1:44:41] Sodom
[1:44:44] his own nephew split the church
[1:44:49] walked away
[1:44:51] and he pitched his tent towards Sodom
[1:44:54] never thinking he'd become the male
[1:44:57] never thinking he'd leave the altar of
[1:44:59] Abraham never thinking that I'll go this
[1:45:02] far he never thought that it would come
[1:45:05] to a time in his life that he would
[1:45:08] offer his virgin daughters
[1:45:11] all right
[1:45:15] sometimes when you walk away from a
[1:45:17] message and you think oh I'll hold on no
[1:45:20] you won't
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:23] I want to say no you want
[1:45:25] I'm not going to I'm going to quit
[1:45:27] church and I'm going to I'm going to be
[1:45:29] as good a Christian next week well you
[1:45:31] might be next week

[1:46:05] you've jumped off of the cliff and
[1:46:07] there's nothing to hold you
[1:46:15] I can hold myself
[1:46:18] I told a young man one time
[1:46:21] I said you know
[1:46:23] the first devil that walks in you might
[1:46:26] be able to control him
[1:46:28] but you don't realize that the scripture
[1:46:30] said that he holds the door open
[1:46:34] for seven more Devils worse than himself
[1:46:39] and those demons listen Satan is not a
[1:46:42] good negotiator
[1:46:46] young people let me just say church is
[1:46:49] the most Lively part of your life
[1:46:54] and when they offer you drugs
[1:46:58] it'll destroy you
[1:47:00] when they offer you alcohol it'll
[1:47:02] destroy you
[1:47:07] pornography enters into your life you're
[1:47:09] lusting after somebody else's wife
[1:47:11] somebody else's husband
[1:47:13] and to be very honest with you 10 years
[1:47:15] from now she won't look like that
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:20] and you've sold your soul for a pot of
[1:47:22] gold
[1:47:23] and it turns out to be black belly LED
[1:47:28] worthless
[1:47:32] Satan don't mind you winding up in
[1:47:34] prison and destroyed
[1:47:39] as a matter of fact he don't mind you
[1:47:41] coming to church sitting and going well

[1:48:01] day
[1:48:02] CNN and Fox News and sports is not going
[1:48:05] to change your body
[1:48:08] this Christ is going to change your body
[1:48:21] brother on I'm too busy to go to church
[1:48:30] when you're in a tribulation period
[1:48:33] the choices will be easier
[1:48:37] but just think about this Oh Brother on
[1:48:40] if I have to go through the tribulation
[1:48:41] period I will
[1:48:42] you can't overcome now
[1:48:47] you can't overcome now
[1:48:49] you can't get yourself out of your lazy
[1:48:52] bag
[1:48:56] and get the strength to you to get a
[1:48:59] decent outfit on and come to church and
[1:49:03] sit for an hour or two
[1:49:06] do you really think that you're going to
[1:49:08] overcome in a tribulation period
[1:49:14] you better get right with God now
[1:49:16] [Applause]
[1:49:35] the testimony of the sea
[1:49:37] brother Branham speaks on he speaks also
[1:49:40] be not afraid
[1:49:46] brother Brian said they Jesus told him
[1:49:48] said I'll meet you on the other side
[1:49:50] we'll go to the other side
[1:49:54] they pushes their their muscles
[1:49:56] shoulders against that boat
[1:49:57] pushes it out into the water
[1:50:00] they don't know what lays ahead of them
[1:50:04] Jesus gets he's wore out he's tired
[1:50:08] and he goes to a special place in that
[1:50:10] boat
[1:50:13] maybe it's Nets maybe it's some sort of
[1:50:16] a blanket he pulls it up over himself
[1:50:23] Jesus goes to sleep
[1:50:27] we'll go two different ways here because
[1:50:29] two different occurrences happen
[1:50:32] they start
[1:50:34] having a testimony meeting
[1:50:39] one pops up
[1:50:41] and he begins to tell about what Jesus
[1:50:43] did for him
[1:50:45] the Miracles that he seen what he's been
[1:50:48] a part of
[1:50:52] brother bear said Peter couldn't wait
[1:50:53] for Andrew to quit
[1:50:57] he finally stood up and
[1:50:59] he he wanted Andrew to stop
[1:51:02] because Andrew was enjoying talking
[1:51:04] about what God had done for him
[1:51:07] and Peter wanted to talk for a little
[1:51:09] while
[1:51:10] and then Nathaniel wanted to talk
[1:51:14] listen I didn't I didn't know that that
[1:51:16] was him but he told me that he saw me
[1:51:20] while I was still under the tree
[1:51:22] an Israelite in whom there's no God he
[1:51:26] knowed me
[1:51:28] he knowed me I didn't know where I was
[1:51:31] at at the time but he knowed me my daddy
[1:51:34] told me that this kind of Messiah was on
[1:51:36] the way
[1:51:38] he told me that he was on the way and
[1:51:41] when I met him I knew that's him
[1:51:46] [Music]
[1:51:47] [Applause]
[1:51:53] they didn't know a storm was coming
[1:52:01] sometimes you don't know a storm's
[1:52:03] coming
[1:52:05] Satan gets in your storms
[1:52:09] he gets in your moodiness
[1:52:12] he gets in the trials of your life
[1:52:14] he blows things up
[1:52:18] Spirit of God's been in your home and
[1:52:20] all of a sudden you feel a chill
[1:52:24] overcoming is recognizing the devil at
[1:52:27] his tricks and say not today
[1:52:30] not today
[1:52:32] there you are living this message where
[1:52:36] you live
[1:52:38] in all of the chaos that is going on
[1:52:40] around us
[1:52:43] and Jesus is in your home he's in your
[1:52:46] boat
[1:52:48] and then a storm comes
[1:52:50] the backdrop of their testimony service
[1:52:54] the backdrop of all of that is a storm
[1:52:57] is headed the way
[1:52:58] God knew you before the storm came
[1:53:03] he knew you before the storms of your
[1:53:06] life come
[1:53:07] brother brother Ron but in the Bible
[1:53:09] they you know they were such Heroes of
[1:53:13] Faith did you not see the storm in their
[1:53:15] life
[1:53:17] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:53:20] Daniel waiting for 21 days for God to
[1:53:24] show up
[1:53:25] Daniel in a lion's den Daniel a leader
[1:53:28] amongst leaders in the midst of Darkness
[1:53:32] every demon in the house trying to
[1:53:34] destroy him
[1:53:36] Esther
[1:53:39] Rahab the Harlot
[1:53:41] she was as much predestinated seed as a
[1:53:45] harlot
[1:53:48] God knew where she was at
[1:53:53] you may be a drunk today you may be a
[1:53:55] prostitute today you may be a dope
[1:53:57] addict today but God's pulling on your
[1:53:59] heart don't take that for granted
[1:54:04] don't take it for granted when God pulls
[1:54:07] on your heart move move quickly
[1:54:10] don't take a service for granted move
[1:54:13] quickly
[1:54:23] last night we sat at the table
[1:54:28] and Brother David
[1:54:32] tells us a testimony
[1:54:35] about demons
[1:54:37] coming into his room after a
[1:54:39] after a prayer line
[1:54:41] coming into his room pinning him down
[1:54:43] filling the hair of those demons
[1:54:46] scratching against his body couldn't
[1:54:49] move
[1:54:50] couldn't talk couldn't even move his
[1:54:52] mouth he said I just started to think
[1:54:54] the name of Jesus Christ think the name
[1:54:57] of Jesus Christ think the name of Jesus
[1:55:00] Christ
[1:55:02] he would destroy us if he could
[1:55:05] he would destroy us a sick and with
[1:55:07] thinking the name of Jesus Christ those
[1:55:10] demons begin to break
[1:55:12] and what he couldn't even move a muscle
[1:55:16] couldn't move his mouth
[1:55:18] couldn't even roll his eyes
[1:55:21] those demons had to give up at the name
[1:55:24] of Jesus Christ
[1:55:35] this morning Gabriel and Malachi said at
[1:55:37] my said I had an experience this week
[1:55:41] and he said I was in the bed and I was
[1:55:43] laying on my belly had my head down
[1:55:46] and he said God began to move in the
[1:55:48] room
[1:55:49] he said I couldn't move a muscle
[1:55:53] I could feel him all over me
[1:55:55] I thought the Rapture was getting ready
[1:55:58] to happen
[1:56:00] I literally was looking to see if Sarah
[1:56:03] was still in the bed we're getting ready
[1:56:05] to take a Rapture I want you to think
[1:56:08] about this same table hours apart
[1:56:12] work for work
[1:56:15] the devil trying to destroy and then
[1:56:18] God's saying rapture's on the scene
[1:56:21] [Applause]
[1:56:25] same table hours apart
[1:56:29] almost the same words Satan's against us
[1:56:32] but God's on our side
[1:56:35] Satan's trying to destroy us but we're
[1:56:37] preparing for a rapture
[1:56:40] living in the same atmosphere in the
[1:56:43] hour of Darkness
[1:56:45] God's got this
[1:56:48] God's got this
[1:56:49] [Applause]
[1:57:06] Jesus knew on the other side
[1:57:27] we were in Louisiana last week Saturday
[1:57:30] night
[1:57:31] about 1 30 we went to bed
[1:57:37] four o'clock in the morning
[1:57:39] we had cast out demons
[1:57:43] one demon that came out had a headable
[1:57:46] head of a wolf
[1:57:49] and had eyes about that big
[1:57:52] and it came out
[1:57:57] he said brother on these things ain't
[1:57:58] real
[1:58:01] that girl had been molested at eight
[1:58:03] years old
[1:58:04] and it left a demon
[1:58:07] but in that prayer line that demon was
[1:58:09] exposed
[1:58:10] five
[1:58:12] listen you better be right
[1:58:14] as a preacher of God you better be right
[1:58:17] when you're looking back in the history
[1:58:19] of somebody you're going to say when you
[1:58:21] was a child
[1:58:23] and tell them what exactly takes place
[1:58:27] and then that demon knows you've got
[1:58:28] more power than he's got
[1:58:33] he knows when it comes Rapture mourning
[1:58:35] he can't hold you
[1:58:37] he's fought you all these years but he
[1:58:39] can't hold you
[1:58:47] thank you
[1:58:59] and I woke up and those demons were in
[1:59:02] the room
[1:59:03] that same wolf
[1:59:06] with those same eyes
[1:59:09] and it was like a a gang
[1:59:12] of teenage boys
[1:59:15] dressed up
[1:59:17] and those demons were running running
[1:59:19] all over my room
[1:59:23] and I woke up
[1:59:25] and I could feel them brushing my body
[1:59:30] now you better know who you are
[1:59:32] when that's going on
[1:59:38] I woke up and I said in the name of
[1:59:40] Jesus Christ
[1:59:42] leave now
[1:59:46] go to the river
[1:59:49] jump in the river
[1:59:51] I gave them Specific Instructions I
[1:59:54] didn't want them to go to another person
[1:59:58] I didn't want them just roaming
[2:00:00] throughout the campground you go to the
[2:00:03] river
[2:00:04] who do you think you are brother Ron the
[2:00:06] same Jesus
[2:00:08] [Applause]
[2:00:13] the same Jesus lives inside of us
[2:00:21] I give you instructions if you're
[2:00:23] sitting with a dead preacher
[2:00:25] that don't have the power to cast out
[2:00:27] the devil
[2:00:29] in this Dark Age you better be finding a
[2:00:32] church
[2:00:35] where there's a living God
[2:00:39] to keep the devil off of your home keep
[2:00:42] the devil out come on Church
[2:00:45] brother on God don't do that no more
[2:00:47] you're too late you're too late to tell
[2:00:50] me that God's still in the business he
[2:00:53] still cast out Devils he still fills
[2:00:56] people with the Holy Ghost
[2:00:58] there's overcoming bride of Jesus Christ
[2:01:05] brother Ron but you guys are just too
[2:01:07] emotional brother Brown said if your
[2:01:09] religion hadn't got a murder emotion in
[2:01:12] It Go bury it because it's dead
[2:01:26] we were staying in a 42 inch travel home
[2:01:30] 42.
[2:01:32] that'd be that'd be kind of
[2:01:34] 42 foot that's why you're here to help
[2:01:37] me
[2:01:42] he's on the opposite end the doors are
[2:01:45] closed
[2:01:47] and he can hear everything that's going
[2:01:49] on
[2:01:50] and he hears me praying
[2:01:54] God give me strength
[2:01:56] God restore the strength of my body
[2:01:59] God restore the strength of my body
[2:02:02] God restore the strength of my body
[2:02:06] I'm not looking for a specific pill to
[2:02:09] restore the strength of my body
[2:02:11] cancer is trying to destroy this body
[2:02:14] chemo's trying to destroy this body but
[2:02:17] God
[2:02:20] I prayed to him this morning and I said
[2:02:22] God you know I don't have the strength I
[2:02:24] have to be honest I don't have the
[2:02:26] strength to preach but God you're the
[2:02:29] god that can give me strength in my body
[2:02:31] [Applause]
[2:02:48] Jesus met the devil one time
[2:02:53] up on a mountain
[2:02:56] and it was at the weakest point of
[2:02:58] Jesus's life
[2:02:59] a man
[2:03:02] brother Shannon he had fasted for 40
[2:03:05] days
[2:03:06] and 49th
[2:03:08] and it was it at his weakest
[2:03:12] he couldn't feel anointed
[2:03:15] knowing who he was
[2:03:17] but he couldn't feel the angels
[2:03:20] and the devil came to him
[2:03:25] and when the devil came to him
[2:03:28] he offered him
[2:03:30] he offered him to be a king
[2:03:33] without Calvary
[2:03:36] because if he can get him to take king
[2:03:37] without Calvary you're lost
[2:03:42] and he offered him the kingdoms of the
[2:03:45] world even showed him the United States
[2:03:48] but why would you want a temporary
[2:03:50] Kingdom when your promise is an eternal
[2:03:54] Kingdom
[2:03:57] now that test wasn't just for Jesus but
[2:04:01] brother Branham had some tests
[2:04:06] do you think it was an easy thing to
[2:04:08] turn down a million dollars
[2:04:10] huge Cathedral
[2:04:13] brother biscoll said I saw the check
[2:04:16] that they offered him
[2:04:19] a million dollars in the 60s
[2:04:23] was phenomenal
[2:04:26] the professional athlete was making
[2:04:28] around sixty thousand dollars a year
[2:04:34] the greatest professionals was making
[2:04:36] sixty thousand dollars a year
[2:04:38] they're offering brother Branham a
[2:04:40] million
[2:04:42] but there was chaos behind it
[2:04:46] Satan will make an offer to you
[2:04:51] because you are who you are
[2:04:54] he'll make you an offer
[2:04:58] and you have to make a choice with that
[2:05:01] offer
[2:05:07] you have to make a choice with that
[2:05:09] offer
[2:05:10] I choose Jesus
[2:05:13] now
[2:05:15] 10 years from now
[2:05:18] I make a choice I choose Jesus
[2:05:21] I choose this message I'm not ashamed of
[2:05:24] this message
[2:05:36] sister Kirsten when I watch your husband
[2:05:38] get a greater portion of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:43] as he went through that prayer line and
[2:05:45] I wrapped my arms around your midsection
[2:05:47] and you were getting it it was pouring
[2:05:50] down on top of you
[2:05:53] that's my portion
[2:05:55] I'll take it when I saw you young people
[2:05:59] I know you've got to fight a lot of
[2:06:01] Darkness but when I saw you getting your
[2:06:05] portion
[2:06:06] I know every devil in hell is trying to
[2:06:08] destroy you but when I see you getting
[2:06:11] your portion
[2:06:15] eternity
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:38] brother brannerman said the man was
[2:06:40] getting ready to get his Deliverance get
[2:06:42] his healing
[2:06:44] and a demon walked up the aisle
[2:06:47] and told him that he needed to go to the
[2:06:49] bathroom
[2:06:52] and he walked out
[2:06:54] I went to the bathroom and missed his
[2:06:56] healing
[2:07:01] there's nothing that a restaurant's got
[2:07:08] there's nothing that a job has got
[2:07:11] there's nothing on your television
[2:07:14] has got
[2:07:16] that will exchange with this
[2:07:20] [Applause]
[2:07:30] you're going to be made offers
[2:07:37] you're one of the best singers I know
[2:07:47] and maybe you you would say well brother
[2:07:49] Ron I don't get paid to do it
[2:07:52] really
[2:08:00] so Elvis Presley would like to change
[2:08:02] places with you
[2:08:06] Stephen he would like to just get a
[2:08:08] moment
[2:08:10] set where you're sitting
[2:08:17] William
[2:08:19] how important are you
[2:08:23] A.A Allen who was a drunk preacher that
[2:08:27] could never overcome but yet he could
[2:08:29] use a gift
[2:08:30] would like to step from where he's at
[2:08:33] to have your seat
[2:08:41] what about you
[2:08:43] there's millions and billionaires in
[2:08:45] hell
[2:08:53] I'd like for your sister to listen to
[2:08:55] this sermon
[2:08:56] I want her to listen to this sermon
[2:09:00] because there's nothing Satan's got to
[2:09:01] offer
[2:09:03] nothing
[2:09:06] nothing Satan's got to offer
[2:09:08] then it's greater than this
[2:09:13] thank you for your burden for your
[2:09:15] sister
[2:09:16] because it's a type of Christ
[2:09:19] that lives on the inside of you it's
[2:09:21] because you've got the real thing is
[2:09:24] your concern for her
[2:09:32] but she's wrapped in the chaos of
[2:09:34] darkness in the wounds of yesterday
[2:09:38] those wounds mean nothing
[2:09:42] when the presence of Jesus comes
[2:09:45] I don't care what horrible things that
[2:09:47] you've been through if you can get in
[2:09:48] the presence of Jesus Christ five
[2:09:51] minutes
[2:09:53] years of scars will mean nothing
[2:09:58] [Applause]
[2:10:14] summer you're one one in your family
[2:10:17] and maybe there's times that you think
[2:10:22] how did I get here
[2:10:32] your journey Jeremy
[2:10:35] testifies of predestination
[2:10:38] like I've never
[2:10:46] oh I feel the Lord
[2:10:52] that girl set him beside of you
[2:10:55] she had to put up with me as a father
[2:10:57] figure and I would tell her
[2:10:59] that one's not for you
[2:11:01] that one's not for you that was not for
[2:11:04] you
[2:11:05] and she had to trust me
[2:11:08] you were coming
[2:11:12] and you with your wrinkle shirt
[2:11:16] you walked in and sat down in this
[2:11:19] church and God spoke to me that's the
[2:11:23] right one
[2:11:25] you look like a round rock with a lot of
[2:11:27] dirt on it but God knew there was a
[2:11:30] diamond laying on the inside of them
[2:11:33] [Applause]
[2:11:48] not just anybody can cut a diamond
[2:11:51] not anybody just with a chisel can cut a
[2:11:54] diamond it takes a master
[2:11:58] it takes an absolute master
[2:12:02] because you can destroy it
[2:12:06] but a master
[2:12:07] starts cutting
[2:12:11] and there may be millions of diamonds in
[2:12:14] that same Rock
[2:12:18] but there would be called a mother
[2:12:19] diamond
[2:12:21] that holds the fire
[2:12:28] and every one of those diamonds
[2:12:31] will look like the original
[2:12:34] no matter how big and no matter how
[2:12:36] small
[2:12:37] even to be a chip
[2:12:40] as small as can go on a saw
[2:12:46] or as brother Branham said a Victoria a
[2:12:48] victrola
[2:12:50] into the needle
[2:12:52] because that diamond
[2:12:54] it may be so small you can't see it but
[2:12:57] if you could look deep it's got the same
[2:13:00] fire that the original one had
[2:13:07] and listen it takes that kind of diamond
[2:13:12] when it's dropped down on that
[2:13:17] whoo when it drops down that recording
[2:13:20] it takes that diamond that's got that
[2:13:22] fire in it to make the music clear
[2:13:29] God's Diamond dropped down on the inside
[2:13:32] of you
[2:13:34] and it pulled you through the seals and
[2:13:37] it pulled you through the church ages
[2:13:39] and it pulled you through Mighty God
[2:13:42] unveiled and it pulled you through on
[2:13:45] the wings of a snow white dove
[2:13:47] and it pulled you through a living
[2:13:49] Ministry
[2:13:52] you couldn't see it
[2:13:55] God had plans
[2:13:59] Jeremy you may never see it in your own
[2:14:03] life
[2:14:07] somebody greater than me
[2:14:15] in the rain
[2:14:18] isn't that so rain
[2:14:20] your daddy died as a child
[2:14:26] and it was hard being raised with our
[2:14:28] father
[2:14:30] and you had to put up with me
[2:14:33] but I loved you so much I tell you no
[2:14:39] I was receiving instructions from a
[2:14:42] higher authority
[2:15:20] I know I need to be quitting but
[2:15:23] can you hold on just a couple more
[2:15:25] minutes
[2:15:35] when God spoke to me and he said I'm
[2:15:37] going to use you like never before
[2:15:42] I have to be honest with you I saw about
[2:15:44] every miracle that you can see
[2:15:49] including Terry
[2:15:52] after Terry saw everything that he saw
[2:15:55] in that back room
[2:15:58] his words were I can serve a God Like
[2:16:01] That
[2:16:02] he had set in church all those years
[2:16:05] but he didn't realize Darkness was
[2:16:07] coming only a month from now
[2:16:10] cancer was coming its way
[2:16:12] and so God was so rich in Mercy
[2:16:15] he had said in church all those years
[2:16:17] and he was standing at the right place
[2:16:20] at the right time because he was
[2:16:22] carrying a diamond
[2:16:33] when he told me I'll use you like never
[2:16:35] before
[2:16:36] I never thought
[2:16:38] in my wildest dreams
[2:16:42] I thought maybe more gifted
[2:16:44] maybe more wisdom to preach the deeper
[2:16:46] things of God
[2:16:48] I never thought
[2:16:52] that the demon of cancer
[2:16:56] one of the most powerful demons in hell
[2:16:59] one that was
[2:17:01] that would try to withstand the prophet
[2:17:03] in a cave
[2:17:05] that he would talk about not even cancer
[2:17:10] you see I was getting ready to be
[2:17:12] presented
[2:17:14] another backdrop
[2:17:19] I couldn't see the storm coming
[2:17:27] but I want to tell you
[2:17:29] I trusted him
[2:17:35] and there has been moments
[2:17:38] that we've tried to hide from you
[2:17:41] that are very dark
[2:17:44] and are very horrible
[2:17:46] but you know what it's dead
[2:17:48] it's made me a better person
[2:17:54] as a matter of fact it was God's Divine
[2:17:56] will
[2:17:57] to get me closer to him
[2:18:02] sickness brother Ron some of your trials
[2:18:05] will be a lot of different things
[2:18:07] but I can stand here and be honest with
[2:18:09] you it didn't drive me away from God
[2:18:16] I'm preaching to you now it didn't drive
[2:18:19] me away from God it drove me to him
[2:18:23] like never before
[2:18:29] I want to tell you a couple Secrets here
[2:18:32] it will your trial will make you know
[2:18:36] what's really important
[2:18:48] I don't know if you caught that
[2:18:54] I don't need nobody to feel sorry for me
[2:18:58] I'm not going to stand and whine to you
[2:19:02] I hope I've never come across to you as
[2:19:04] a whiner
[2:19:05] I hope I've come across to you
[2:19:07] as an armed Soldier
[2:19:11] with a sword in my hand
[2:19:18] foreign
[2:19:42] when you go get a test
[2:19:44] and they're thinking bad stuff
[2:19:46] you know what goes through your mind
[2:19:49] and it turns out to be nothing
[2:19:51] and you go thank you Jesus thank you
[2:19:53] Jesus maybe they find a spot you know
[2:19:56] what goes through your mind
[2:19:57] you think the worst thing
[2:20:03] thank God generally it's nothing
[2:20:07] but when it really is something
[2:20:11] and it's on your brain and it's in your
[2:20:14] lungs and it's on your organs and it's
[2:20:17] all over your body

[2:26:21] a baby who day after day those things
[2:26:24] darken up because it gets darker the
[2:26:26] reason it gets darker is because you're
[2:26:28] glistening against it
[2:26:38] and you don't you don't quit
[2:26:41] and finally Sarah can't have a baby

[2:26:49] impossible
[2:26:51] as a matter of fact

[2:26:57] he has to wait until your energies can't
[2:26:59] do it no more
[2:27:03] and then he visits you
[2:27:06] and then he asks you
[2:27:09] he asked you
[2:27:12] is anything
[2:27:16] impossible
[2:27:19] to God

[2:27:25] but this isn't what he's concentrating
[2:27:27] on
[2:27:28] he sees you in your ninth season
[2:27:32] but he has to wait till you get so deep
[2:27:34] in your night season until you can't do
[2:27:37] it on your own
[2:27:44] a rise and shine

[2:28:07] diamond
