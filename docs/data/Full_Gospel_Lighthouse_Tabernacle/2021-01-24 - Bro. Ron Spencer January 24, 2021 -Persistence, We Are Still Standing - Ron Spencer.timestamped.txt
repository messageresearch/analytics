[56:36] and they don't even know and the pastor
[56:40] will feel led to go this place or to
[56:42] this place or to this place
[56:44] and and assembling 200 people in an
[56:47] apartment
[56:51] in an apartment that's what they're
[56:53] doing
[56:54] and they believe this message with
[56:56] everything that is within
[56:58] them amen and
[57:02] amen and so one of the pastors is
[57:04] brother caleb
[57:05] and he i think they have i don't know
[57:07] exactly how many that they have in their
[57:09] assembly
[57:10] but their assembly is still going strong
[57:13] and they're doing the very same thing
[57:15] and he gets out of prison in november
[57:18] and so please pray for him that god
[57:21] would just be with them

[57:30] he went into prison in the summer and so
[57:33] that was the

[57:36] their coldest
[57:37] winter in china in literally
[57:41] decades and he don't have any clothes
[57:43] other than those clothes
[57:46] and so he prayed that he could get a job
[57:48] of ironing clothes
[57:50] so he could get warm and they gave him
[57:53] that job amen and so
[57:57] amen and so he's he's just

[58:56] amen if you will turn with me to romans
[58:59] chapter 4

[59:08] and i've just got a few scriptures for
[59:10] you this morning then we'll go right
[59:11] into the word
[59:16] i'd like to take a part of the series of
[59:18] champion
[59:22] but today i'd like to i would like to
[59:28] take a portion of it and speak on
[59:30] persistence
[59:32] we are still standing
[59:38] romans 4 and verse 16 therefore it is of
[59:41] faith
[59:42] that it might be by grace to the end of
[59:44] the promise
[59:47] might be sure to all seed not
[59:50] only which is of the law but to that
[59:53] which is also
[59:54] faith of abraham who is the father of us
[59:57] all as it is written i have made thee a
[1:00:01] father
[1:00:01] of many nations before him
[1:00:05] whom he believed even god
[1:00:09] who quickeneth the dead and calleth
[1:00:12] those things
[1:00:13] which be not as though they were
[1:00:16] who against hope believed in hope
[1:00:19] that he might become the father of many
[1:00:22] nations
[1:00:23] according to that which was spoken so
[1:00:26] shall thy seed be
[1:00:28] and being not weak in faith he
[1:00:30] considered not
[1:00:31] his own body now dead when he was about
[1:00:34] a hundred years old
[1:00:36] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:00:39] i want you to notice these next words he
[1:00:42] staggered
[1:00:42] not at the promises of god
[1:00:46] through unbelief but was strong in
[1:00:49] faith giving glory to god
[1:00:53] hallelujah and being fully persuaded
[1:00:57] that what he had promised he was able
[1:01:00] also to perform you may be seated this
[1:01:04] this morning in psalms 24 and verse 7
[1:01:10] lift up your heads all you gates and all
[1:01:13] you lift up
[1:01:14] ye everlasting doors and the king of
[1:01:18] glory
[1:01:19] shall come in i'm glad to be a part of
[1:01:21] that
[1:01:23] who is the king of glory the lord
[1:01:26] strong and mighty the lord mighty in
[1:01:29] battle
[1:01:30] lift up your heads o you gates and even
[1:01:32] lift them up ye everlasting doors
[1:01:35] the king of glory shall come in who is
[1:01:38] the king of
[1:01:39] glory the lord of hosts
[1:01:42] he is the king of glory
[1:01:45] say law
[1:01:48] brother branham will use the scripture
[1:01:50] and this day the is fulfilled which was
[1:01:52] a prophetic message
[1:01:54] it was it was a god of prophecy and then
[1:01:57] it became a
[1:01:58] god of history so when the event comes
[1:02:02] up into the event it's prophecy the
[1:02:04] event happens
[1:02:06] and then it becomes history
[1:02:09] the scripture says in isaiah chapter 61
[1:02:12] and verse 1
[1:02:13] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:02:15] because the lord
[1:02:17] hath anointed me to preach good tidings
[1:02:20] unto the meek he has sent me to heal the
[1:02:23] brokenhearted
[1:02:24] to proclaim liberty to the captives and
[1:02:27] the opening of the prison
[1:02:29] to them that are bound and to proclaim
[1:02:32] the acceptable year of the lord and the
[1:02:35] day of vengeance of our god
[1:02:37] and to comfort all that mourn
[1:02:42] now that was a prophecy from isaiah
[1:02:47] that jesus would fulfill
[1:02:50] and then brother branham would come
[1:02:51] along and preach a sermon going
[1:02:54] this day this scripture
[1:02:59] is fulfilled now
[1:03:02] i i want to remind you that you and i
[1:03:05] have lived in a very special day
[1:03:08] and we're living in very special times
[1:03:11] to where we're watching the end of the
[1:03:14] gentile dispensation
[1:03:17] and being the bride of jesus christ our
[1:03:20] eyes are
[1:03:20] very alert to the happenings that are
[1:03:24] going on around
[1:03:25] us sodom and gomorrah does not affect
[1:03:29] us we were built to live in this day
[1:03:34] the world that is falling apart does not
[1:03:37] affect us
[1:03:38] we have an anchor
[1:03:43] we have an anchor we have a word
[1:03:46] that has gripped our hearts and we know
[1:03:50] who we
[1:03:50] are and we know where we stand
[1:03:57] and we're not going back
[1:04:01] we're not going back we're standing on a
[1:04:05] solid rock and we have an assurance
[1:04:10] today
[1:04:12] i want to read you a scripture that has
[1:04:14] been in prophetic form
[1:04:17] and now is being fulfilled before our
[1:04:19] eyes
[1:04:20] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[1:04:23] brethren
[1:04:24] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:04:27] you sorrow not even as your others which
[1:04:29] have no hope
[1:04:30] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:04:33] rose again
[1:04:35] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[1:04:38] will god bring with them for this we say
[1:04:42] unto you by the word of the lord that we
[1:04:45] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:04:47] coming of the lord
[1:04:48] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:04:51] i just want to say this to you
[1:04:52] even in these coveted conditions many
[1:04:55] have asked me when will we all get to be
[1:04:57] back together again
[1:04:59] and be able to come to both services on
[1:05:01] the weekend
[1:05:02] i'm praying very shortly right but we're
[1:05:05] not
[1:05:06] we're not alone even now even in the
[1:05:09] unseen
[1:05:09] realm and i'm not talking about the
[1:05:11] internet there is a gathering that is
[1:05:13] happening
[1:05:18] there's a gathering that's taking place
[1:05:20] because the season on the earth
[1:05:22] is just before the rapture so there's a
[1:05:25] gathering taking place
[1:05:26] in another realm and they're getting
[1:05:30] ready to take a half a step
[1:05:31] this way and we're going to take a half
[1:05:33] a step that way
[1:05:35] this scripture is going to be history
[1:05:41] hallelujah that which has been prophecy
[1:05:45] for 2 000
[1:05:46] years is about to happen
[1:05:53] and i want to just anchor this this
[1:05:54] morning and there's nothing the devil
[1:05:56] can do to stop it
[1:06:08] now brother branham says he says now
[1:06:10] good morning this comes from shalom
[1:06:13] means peace darkness is gathering
[1:06:17] what is it gathering for to show the
[1:06:19] light
[1:06:21] isaiah 60 and verse 1 and he quotes it
[1:06:25] rise and shine for the light has come to
[1:06:27] you
[1:06:28] that's the reason i say shalom the light
[1:06:32] has come to you god's peace
[1:06:37] to the elected woman
[1:06:40] to the elected lady those who
[1:06:44] god notices and he pins it down
[1:06:47] those who god before the foundation of
[1:06:50] the world
[1:06:51] called out and ordained to that let me
[1:06:54] just say
[1:06:54] he hand picked you to live in this age
[1:07:04] are you with me now he picked you to
[1:07:07] live in this stage
[1:07:11] the rest of them will never see it
[1:07:16] they'll never know nothing about it
[1:07:19] the bible said so and jesus said
[1:07:23] no man will come to me except my
[1:07:27] father my father draws him first
[1:07:31] and all the father has given me will
[1:07:34] come
[1:07:36] this is now your scripture to him that
[1:07:39] overcometh
[1:07:41] 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant
[1:07:45] to sit with me in my throne
[1:07:47] even as i also overcame
[1:07:50] and am set down with my father in his
[1:07:52] throne
[1:07:53] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:07:57] the spirit
[1:07:58] saith unto the churches
[1:08:05] a lot of people hear but they don't hear
[1:08:08] a lot of people see but they don't see
[1:08:13] jesus would say blessed are your eyes
[1:08:15] for you see
[1:08:17] your ears for you here
[1:08:24] luke 9 and verse 52 and jesus said unto
[1:08:27] him
[1:08:29] no man you heard this last week
[1:08:32] no man having put his hand to the plow
[1:08:36] and looking back is fit for the kingdom
[1:08:41] of god one place in the scripture
[1:08:46] jesus calls one woman's name in a sodom
[1:08:49] and gomorrah age
[1:08:50] and he's also leaking it to our day
[1:08:56] remember lot's wife
[1:09:01] as the fire was falling she looked back
[1:09:06] are you with me hold on to that thought
[1:09:10] first john chapter 3 and verse 1 behold
[1:09:13] what manner of the love the father has
[1:09:15] bestowed upon us
[1:09:17] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:09:20] therefore the world
[1:09:21] knoweth us not
[1:09:27] quite a statement the world
[1:09:30] knoweth us not
[1:09:35] your neighbors your friends even your
[1:09:37] loved ones
[1:09:39] some of them really don't know you
[1:09:44] you know brother branham was around a
[1:09:46] lot of people and they really
[1:09:48] didn't know who he was
[1:09:52] they really didn't know as i spoke to
[1:09:55] one young man last night i said
[1:09:58] i'm more than your uncle
[1:10:04] i'm more than your uncle to you
[1:10:08] i'm more than your friend
[1:10:15] amen are you with me
[1:10:20] so the world knows us not because they
[1:10:22] knew him not
[1:10:27] beloved now are we the sons of god
[1:10:32] it doth not yet appear what we shall be
[1:10:37] but we know that when he shall appear
[1:10:41] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:10:44] him
[1:10:45] as he is
[1:10:49] now brother brahma drops these next
[1:10:50] couple of quotes and i just want to give
[1:10:52] them for you
[1:10:53] he said what if god would have told john
[1:10:55] the revelator now it's going to be 2 000
[1:10:58] years
[1:10:59] before my coming and
[1:11:02] john would have came back and told the
[1:11:04] church well i guess you may as well
[1:11:06] eat and drink and be merry cause there's
[1:11:08] going to be many generations
[1:11:11] and jesus ain't going to come for 2000
[1:11:13] years
[1:11:14] the church would have got loose
[1:11:18] there would have been no on the mark
[1:11:24] on the mark there would have been no
[1:11:28] waiting
[1:11:29] and after all it's your anticipations
[1:11:32] if you fall asleep in that watch
[1:11:36] that you wake with them you wake with
[1:11:39] them
[1:11:40] same anticipations because it ain't
[1:11:43] going to hinder
[1:11:44] one thing you're going to be right there
[1:11:48] on time anyway you see what i mean
[1:11:51] now watch these next words when saint
[1:11:54] martin awakes in the resurrection
[1:11:56] and saint paul and the rest of them
[1:11:59] it'll be just as fresh as they went
[1:12:02] right in the battle
[1:12:03] battling away because they went right
[1:12:06] down
[1:12:06] under the same anticipations
[1:12:10] looking for his coming and there will
[1:12:13] come a scream will come
[1:12:15] and the whole church you talking about a
[1:12:18] church service
[1:12:21] hallelujah they spent their life for
[1:12:24] christ
[1:12:25] they gave it their whole energies they
[1:12:28] were champions of their
[1:12:29] age hallelujah
[1:12:32] they overcome in some very dark times
[1:12:37] but on resurrection morning they'll skip
[1:12:39] from that realm to our realm
[1:12:43] hallelujah and they'll experience a
[1:12:46] resurrection
[1:12:49] hallelujah we'll experience that
[1:12:52] resurrection with them
[1:12:55] the change of our bodies
[1:13:02] um i could preach a long time right
[1:13:05] there
[1:13:07] now watch this god's purpose
[1:13:11] can never be defeated
[1:13:15] i want you to settle that right now
[1:13:17] god's got a plan
[1:13:21] god's got a blueprint
[1:13:24] god's got this all put together
[1:13:30] he knows where you are where you're
[1:13:32] setting the situation you're going
[1:13:33] through
[1:13:35] and he's got a plan he knows how to get
[1:13:37] you here sister kirsten
[1:13:40] he knows how to put you in a certain
[1:13:41] place
[1:13:43] and he knows this is not the end of it
[1:13:54] and god's purpose can never
[1:13:59] be defeated
[1:14:02] now watch this there is nothing out of
[1:14:06] out of that can defeat it so how happy
[1:14:09] we ought to be today
[1:14:11] rested upon the beautiful revelation of
[1:14:13] the word of the living god
[1:14:15] there is neither things present
[1:14:18] or things that can come
[1:14:22] there's no sickness there's no sorrow
[1:14:26] no death no pearls
[1:14:29] there nor nothing can separate us
[1:14:32] from the living god well brother ron
[1:14:35] that's a beautiful quote
[1:14:37] that scripture that has been written for
[1:14:39] almost 2
[1:14:40] 000 years and millions of our family has
[1:14:45] lived through some horrible conditions
[1:14:47] and some horrible sicknesses and been
[1:14:50] simming some horrible prisons
[1:14:52] and died in some very wicked ways but it
[1:14:55] kept them
[1:14:58] and nothing can defeat the purpose of
[1:15:00] god
[1:15:06] what god has imagined in his mind
[1:15:09] what god has purposed in his heart
[1:15:12] he says purposed in his heart to bring
[1:15:15] to pass
[1:15:17] there's no demon there's no
[1:15:20] power there's nothing that can ever
[1:15:24] separate god's immutable eternal plan
[1:15:28] it must be as he has
[1:15:31] god has said
[1:15:35] psalms 27 very familiar all of these
[1:15:37] things are familiar
[1:15:39] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:15:42] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[1:15:44] strength of my life
[1:15:46] of whom shall i be afraid when the
[1:15:48] wicked even my
[1:15:49] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[1:15:52] my flesh
[1:15:52] they stumbled and fell though a host
[1:15:55] should encamp against me
[1:15:57] my heart shall not fear the war should
[1:16:00] rise against me and this will i be
[1:16:02] confident
[1:16:05] one thing that i have desired of the
[1:16:06] lord that i will seek after
[1:16:08] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:16:10] lord all the days of my life to behold
[1:16:13] the beauty of the lord
[1:16:15] and to inquire in his temple for in the
[1:16:17] time of trouble
[1:16:18] he shall hide me in his pavilion in the
[1:16:21] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[1:16:23] me
[1:16:24] and he shall set me upon a rock
[1:16:28] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:16:31] my
[1:16:32] enemies round about and therefore i will
[1:16:34] occur in the tabernacle
[1:16:36] sacrifices of joy i will sing
[1:16:39] yea i will sing praises unto the lord
[1:16:43] i will oh lord when i cry with my voice
[1:16:46] have mercy upon me and answer me and
[1:16:49] when thou
[1:16:49] said seeketh my face my heart said unto
[1:16:52] thee
[1:16:53] thy face lord will i seek hide not
[1:16:56] my face far from me put my put not my
[1:16:59] servant away in
[1:17:00] anger for thou has been my help
[1:17:03] leave me not neither forsake me
[1:17:07] oh god of my salvation when my father
[1:17:10] and mother forsake me i'm reading these
[1:17:12] scriptures with real depth and meaning
[1:17:14] now
[1:17:15] when my father and mother forsake me
[1:17:17] then the lord will take me
[1:17:20] up
[1:17:23] teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a
[1:17:26] plain path because of my enemies
[1:17:28] deliver me not over into the will of
[1:17:30] mine enemies for false witnesses are
[1:17:32] risen up against me and
[1:17:34] such as breathe out cruelty i had
[1:17:37] fainted unless i had believed to see the
[1:17:42] goodness of the lord
[1:17:43] in the land of the living wait
[1:17:46] on the lord be of good courage
[1:17:51] and he shall strengthen thine heart wait
[1:17:54] i say on the lord
[1:18:09] i've been a message believer since i was
[1:18:11] a child
[1:18:13] i was raised in the message as a little
[1:18:16] boy i stood at brother branham's
[1:18:18] casket and i remember
[1:18:22] i remember all the people being there
[1:18:26] that's the only time i ever saw brother
[1:18:27] branham
[1:18:29] in the flesh and it was at his funeral
[1:18:36] my father was a believer i think he
[1:18:39] came to the message in in somewhere of
[1:18:42] the year i was born
[1:18:43] about 60 or 61. i'm 59 so you don't have
[1:18:47] to get your mind there
[1:18:50] so i grew up in the message fourth grade
[1:18:53] i stood up on a desk and i said
[1:18:56] in 1977 the world's going to come to an
[1:18:59] end
[1:19:00] that's what was being taught that's what
[1:19:02] i believed
[1:19:03] los angeles is going to have an
[1:19:04] earthquake it's going to fall beneath
[1:19:06] the ocean
[1:19:09] men looked at brother branham's visions
[1:19:11] and had different thoughts about them
[1:19:14] different things we're men we're human
[1:19:16] beings we
[1:19:17] we look from our human perspective
[1:19:20] but brother branham taught us that god
[1:19:23] is his own interpreter
[1:19:28] now understand when it comes to god he's
[1:19:30] not a big hurry
[1:19:35] you see there's predestinated seed why
[1:19:37] the delay
[1:19:38] predestinated seed he's not going to
[1:19:41] lose
[1:19:41] one of us so the conditions of the world
[1:19:46] has get it got to get exactly right
[1:19:49] and there can be prophecies as we just
[1:19:51] read to you
[1:19:52] of isaiah 61 we could have read isaiah 9
[1:19:56] and they would go for hundreds of years
[1:19:59] and there would be a lot of conjectures
[1:20:01] in a lot of different ways too
[1:20:03] but one day it come to pass but it
[1:20:06] didn't happen like they thought it would
[1:20:08] they didn't think it would come through
[1:20:10] a teenage girl
[1:20:13] that didn't attend their church
[1:20:17] and wasn't a part of the priestly line
[1:20:20] but she was the girl that god
[1:20:23] predestinated
[1:20:24] to carry the body the baby of jesus
[1:20:28] christ
[1:20:30] and she fulfilled the vision
[1:20:35] and the world hated her they make a god
[1:20:38] out of her today
[1:20:39] but the world hated her at that time
[1:20:42] they would have stoned her
[1:20:47] had it not been for joseph
[1:20:52] the protection of god
[1:20:55] you have a
[1:21:03] hallelujah
[1:21:06] hey man they're going to
[1:21:10] they're going to get a slide up for me
[1:21:16] okay
[1:21:23] how many seen this this week
[1:21:31] i'd like for you to leave that slide up
[1:21:32] for a little while if you don't mind
[1:21:35] i apologize if it does something crazy
[1:21:37] on the internet but
[1:21:40] can they see that on the internet as
[1:21:42] well
[1:21:43] yes okay okay
[1:21:47] can everybody see that okay right now
[1:21:50] at least you know what it is that's
[1:21:52] purple by the way
[1:21:57] and just for good measure the one that
[1:22:00] made the dress
[1:22:02] made the outfit said it was royal
[1:22:08] purple
[1:22:12] i've heard a lot of nonsense this week
[1:22:14] about it being blue
[1:22:15] well you might want to get a new tv
[1:22:22] monitor
[1:22:29] some men are just liars is all they are
[1:22:46] i'm not a politician and i don't care
[1:22:55] i was asked just a few couple months ago
[1:22:58] if i would be an advisor
[1:23:00] to one of our local politicians in
[1:23:02] richmond
[1:23:04] but i'm too busy
[1:23:08] i was honored to be asked but i'm too
[1:23:11] busy for that
[1:23:12] they offered me politics many years ago
[1:23:15] but i was too busy for it then
[1:23:17] i'm too busy for it now and even when it
[1:23:20] comes to the message i'm not a
[1:23:21] politician either
[1:23:26] so i'd like to just is everybody
[1:23:28] comfortable
[1:23:30] i'd like to just rehearse a few things
[1:23:33] here
[1:23:35] with this picture in mind
[1:23:38] sites will progress in such a way
[1:23:42] until they will make a car that will not
[1:23:45] have to be guided
[1:23:47] by a steering wheel
[1:23:50] and the cars will continue to be shaped
[1:23:53] like an egg
[1:23:55] until the consummation the end time
[1:23:59] i see the american family going down the
[1:24:03] road in a broad way
[1:24:05] riding in a car backs turned around
[1:24:08] towards the wheel
[1:24:11] should be and they look like they're
[1:24:13] playing checkers
[1:24:14] or carts
[1:24:18] and and we we've got it on television
[1:24:20] popular science mechanics rather all
[1:24:22] have it
[1:24:23] we got the cars controlled by remote
[1:24:26] control by radar
[1:24:28] and they won't even have to have any
[1:24:30] steering wheel in it
[1:24:32] just set your dial like that like you
[1:24:35] dial your phone
[1:24:41] have you caught that like you dial your
[1:24:44] phone
[1:24:45] and your car takes you right onto it
[1:24:49] do you remember what the phone was like
[1:24:51] in 1933
[1:24:59] you know for those that want to be a
[1:25:01] critic of brother branham
[1:25:03] do you remember what the phone was like
[1:25:05] in 1933
[1:25:08] every person in your area was on your
[1:25:12] landline
[1:25:15] and you waited till they got off of the
[1:25:17] phone
[1:25:18] to where you could make your call
[1:25:23] and it was it was it had a deal that you
[1:25:26] held to your ear
[1:25:27] and you spoke in a
[1:25:31] in a horn and you dialed it and you
[1:25:34] stood there with it
[1:25:38] and there's children in here that's got
[1:25:41] computer phones
[1:25:46] that supersedes that model by a
[1:25:49] million miles
[1:25:54] but brother branham saw not just the car
[1:25:57] car's here oh we're waiting on that car
[1:26:00] cars are here
[1:26:02] cars are here i can go out there i can't
[1:26:04] drive no more
[1:26:05] but that suburban you just put it on the
[1:26:08] road and you just you just let it and
[1:26:10] it'll drive for you
[1:26:13] you don't want me driving
[1:26:16] but it'll drive for you you can punch in
[1:26:20] on the map like we're getting ready to
[1:26:21] do in about an hour
[1:26:23] and say show us the funeral home and
[1:26:26] it'll guide you
[1:26:27] right to the funeral home
[1:26:34] oh brother ron but one day that'll be
[1:26:35] fulfilled already
[1:26:46] he said he predicted this 30 years
[1:26:48] before it happened
[1:26:51] he said it brings us to the election of
[1:26:53] president kennedy
[1:26:55] you remember he said they give women the
[1:26:57] right to vote
[1:27:00] and they'd vote in a boy president
[1:27:03] and just as it was with elijah and ahab
[1:27:08] we had elijah and a jezebel
[1:27:16] a kennedy a catholic man
[1:27:19] are you with me and he turned our nation
[1:27:22] our morals fell apart
[1:27:26] and i'm not getting into your politics
[1:27:28] you you can
[1:27:29] put whatever sign you want to in the
[1:27:30] yard
[1:27:32] that's that that's up to you that's when
[1:27:34] you and god
[1:27:36] and this car coming on the scene
[1:27:37] bringing five things out of
[1:27:39] seven he said that has happened
[1:27:42] exactly he talked of hitler
[1:27:46] he talked to mussolini he talked to the
[1:27:48] world wars
[1:27:50] and it happened exactly
[1:27:54] find another man on the scene
[1:27:58] that did one millionth of what brother
[1:28:00] branham did
[1:28:04] if brother branham what what in
[1:28:07] malachi 4 5 and 6 and revelations 10
[1:28:11] 7 then you better find you an elijah
[1:28:16] if he didn't fit this ministry didn't
[1:28:19] fit
[1:28:21] and besides that once he left
[1:28:24] here is a people that are the manifested
[1:28:27] word for the day
[1:28:30] and i want to report to you we're still
[1:28:40] standing
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:44] he said now i predicted and have said i
[1:28:46] saw a great woman stand up
[1:28:48] beautiful looking dressed in a
[1:28:52] in real highly purple
[1:28:55] like purple i got a parenthesis down
[1:28:58] there
[1:28:58] she was a great ruler of the united
[1:29:01] states
[1:29:02] perhaps the catholic church
[1:29:06] a a woman or some woman i don't know
[1:29:09] it'll be cat it'll be the catholic
[1:29:11] church i don't know i can't say
[1:29:13] only thing i've seen is i seen the woman
[1:29:15] that was all
[1:29:18] purple represented the catholic church
[1:29:22] and that's why he would say it like that
[1:29:25] well you say well brother ron you have
[1:29:27] an active
[1:29:29] catholic president now
[1:29:34] are you with me now you have seven
[1:29:38] catholic supreme court judges
[1:29:43] whether you want to believe it or not
[1:29:45] we're a catholic nation
[1:29:52] it was predicted
[1:29:56] you can see it with your eyes
[1:29:59] it's not up for argument
[1:30:02] are you with me i respect her i respect
[1:30:05] him
[1:30:07] it's not up for argument this is what
[1:30:10] our
[1:30:18] prophets
[1:30:21] he said i won't have time this in this
[1:30:23] meeting to tell you 1933
[1:30:26] this is a woman's nation it's the number
[1:30:30] 13. it appears in the 13th chapter
[1:30:34] of revelations 13 stars 13 stripes
[1:30:38] 13 everything's a 13.
[1:30:41] everything's a woman and remember thus
[1:30:44] saith the lord there will be a woman
[1:30:46] rule over the before the end time
[1:30:50] she'll either be president vice
[1:30:53] president
[1:30:57] it'll be the catholic church as a woman
[1:30:59] i've i've seen her
[1:31:01] a great woman the nation bowed to her
[1:31:04] it'll be one before the end time thus
[1:31:07] saith the lord
[1:31:08] write it down find out you young people
[1:31:14] see if it happens i want to say this to
[1:31:18] you
[1:31:18] this day
[1:31:23] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:31:35] he said see if it happens write it down
[1:31:38] and find out your young people see if it
[1:31:41] happens
[1:31:42] and if it isn't i'm a false prophet
[1:31:46] let me just say this week fulfilled
[1:31:56] now
[1:31:58] let me let me just just tell you quickly
[1:32:01] and i'm not going to i'm not going to
[1:32:03] i'm going to give you a couple things
[1:32:06] every man is put into position
[1:32:09] to fulfill the plan of god
[1:32:16] every president comes in and he fulfills
[1:32:20] a plan of god
[1:32:21] donald trump moved the embassy to
[1:32:24] jerusalem
[1:32:26] it was a part of the covenant of the
[1:32:28] scriptures
[1:32:29] that it had to be done the world hated
[1:32:33] him for doing it
[1:32:34] and he was driven to do it and he did it
[1:32:40] and he fulfilled the scriptures now
[1:32:44] this man has already fulfilled many
[1:32:46] scriptures
[1:32:48] he has released at the stroke of a pen
[1:32:52] sodom and gomorrah
[1:32:57] are you with me i don't care if i get in
[1:32:59] trouble now but he has released the
[1:33:01] homosexual
[1:33:02] transgender community
[1:33:19] with the stroke of a pen
[1:33:27] and with the stroke of this of another
[1:33:30] pen just like that one
[1:33:32] he turned this nation against israel
[1:33:38] and told them to go back to the 1967
[1:33:42] boundaries and give up the land
[1:33:48] this nation's got to turn against israel
[1:33:52] and if you're waiting for another
[1:33:53] president to turn against it it's
[1:33:55] already done it it's only been there
[1:33:56] just a couple days
[1:34:16] he has stood with the pope several times
[1:34:23] i find it interesting that
[1:34:27] three of the most powerful women in
[1:34:29] politics
[1:34:31] had the same color on
[1:34:36] now it represents the the suffrage
[1:34:40] movement
[1:34:41] with women getting the right to vote
[1:34:45] women had been fighting
[1:35:01] women have been fighting for the right
[1:35:03] to vote since the civil war
[1:35:07] but we had a prophet that came in this
[1:35:09] day and said
[1:35:10] they'll get the right to vote
[1:35:15] and i don't believe that women's a
[1:35:17] second-rate citizen
[1:35:19] as a matter of fact i applaud you with
[1:35:21] all my heart
[1:35:22] i treat you as a queen you know some
[1:35:26] people want to go away and say we treat
[1:35:27] women
[1:35:28] bad well let me just say i got a queen
[1:35:30] back there and i've never treated her
[1:35:31] bad a day in my life
[1:35:34] and i got her mother that rides in the
[1:35:36] car a lot of times with me and i've
[1:35:38] never treated her bad
[1:35:43] and i got a daughter and i never treat
[1:35:45] her bad
[1:35:46] and i wouldn't treat you bad
[1:36:00] you remember brother branham never
[1:36:02] warned us
[1:36:04] you know everybody wants to fight
[1:36:05] socialism that's causing all the riots
[1:36:08] in our nation
[1:36:09] or communism but it's
[1:36:12] catholicism
[1:36:17] that you got to be careful with that man
[1:36:20] of peace that'll settle it all
[1:36:22] down you see even in this world we
[1:36:26] picked a choice that looked like a more
[1:36:30] peaceful solution
[1:36:40] now we see all of these things happening
[1:36:44] and we realize that we're in a lukewarm
[1:36:46] age
[1:36:48] where everything's accepted
[1:36:52] it's a lazy age
[1:36:57] we we we want everything painful
[1:37:02] we we honestly do we want everything
[1:37:04] paid for we want we want
[1:37:06] we want the government to teach our
[1:37:08] children we want the government to
[1:37:10] pay our college bills we we want the
[1:37:13] government to take care of us
[1:37:16] and we turn our back on god
[1:37:22] are you with me you see it was in the
[1:37:25] stages to where that
[1:37:27] different different thoughts begin to
[1:37:29] come up
[1:37:31] and it was a man that that was a
[1:37:33] president that looked a whole lot like
[1:37:34] me
[1:37:35] warned us that these things were coming
[1:37:41] and as a matter of fact he spoke the man
[1:37:43] in the arena and he went around the
[1:37:45] world speaking the man in the arena
[1:37:47] and he said there's a spirit rising in
[1:37:50] the age and he said socialism
[1:37:52] and then he then he went toward the
[1:37:55] catholicism
[1:37:56] and bash them
[1:38:00] that was teddy roosevelt in case you
[1:38:01] didn't get that
[1:38:04] and i can't remember for the life of me
[1:38:06] right now whether he was a republican or
[1:38:08] democrat but it don't matter
[1:38:11] but we live in a lukewarm age
[1:38:14] where there's no commitment
[1:38:18] marriage in divorce is about like
[1:38:21] eating candy
[1:38:24] you don't like this one you just get
[1:38:26] another one you don't like this one you
[1:38:28] just get another one
[1:38:29] but brother brown said you stay as you
[1:38:31] are
[1:38:33] and teach your children to never do that
[1:38:35] thing again
[1:38:36] we had a message to come along and clear
[1:38:38] up the way we dress
[1:38:41] the way we conduct because we're not
[1:38:44] citizens of this world we're citizens of
[1:38:47] another world
[1:38:56] and brother branham will spend in future
[1:38:58] home for example
[1:39:00] brother branham will spend 45 minutes
[1:39:03] complimenting the people
[1:39:05] for their conduct in the city and in the
[1:39:08] restaurants and in the motels and
[1:39:11] and on the street compliment them for
[1:39:14] their good
[1:39:14] conduct
[1:39:18] why did this take so long because
[1:39:21] our life is an example of this
[1:39:24] message this message lives
[1:39:28] look at our families
[1:39:32] just look at our families look what
[1:39:34] god's done for our
[1:39:36] church our churches around the world
[1:39:39] china that we just listen they haven't
[1:39:42] had the message
[1:39:42] long but they're willing to give their
[1:39:45] life for this message
[1:39:48] and they're passionate and they're
[1:39:50] energetic
[1:39:52] the message didn't come in chinese it
[1:39:55] came in
[1:39:55] english and sisters and brothers grabbed
[1:39:59] a hold of that
[1:40:01] and said they had to translate it and
[1:40:03] then translated the bible
[1:40:07] so that they could be a portion of the
[1:40:10] bride of jesus christ
[1:40:12] they were driven with persistence
[1:40:22] i'm going to say something it may hurt
[1:40:24] feelings but so what
[1:40:26] i don't give you a quarter for
[1:40:29] for an experience that'll only get you
[1:40:31] to church
[1:40:32] once in a while
[1:40:39] listen this message is what i think
[1:40:41] about when i get up in the morning
[1:40:43] and when i go to bed at night
[1:40:46] church is more than just saturday
[1:40:48] evening and sunday morning
[1:40:50] to me it's a living reality in my
[1:40:53] life there's nothing in this
[1:40:56] world worth going back for
[1:41:16] hello
[1:41:27] brother ron well i sometimes forget what
[1:41:29] this message is done for
[1:41:31] you're here
[1:41:34] you're here to keep you here is a great
[1:41:37] big deal
[1:41:39] i can't keep you here brother andrew
[1:41:41] can't keep you here
[1:41:42] brother homer couldn't keep you here
[1:41:48] brother joel can't keep you in church as
[1:41:51] a matter of fact we can't even put the
[1:41:52] desire inside of your heart
[1:41:55] but can you remember what you was before
[1:41:58] you got the message
[1:42:02] josh jones was a biker
[1:42:06] in a gang with a really bad reputation
[1:42:11] here's brother denny that was a
[1:42:12] professional wrestler
[1:42:14] that was on his way into higher realms
[1:42:18] when the word came and found him
[1:42:21] many of you you know when we come to our
[1:42:26] ancestry.com we want to know if we're
[1:42:28] akin to princess diana
[1:42:29] or george washington or some famous
[1:42:32] person
[1:42:33] most of us in our families had
[1:42:36] harlots drunks
[1:42:40] derelicts
[1:42:43] but they were carrying your seed
[1:42:48] your natural seed they were carrying
[1:42:50] your seed
[1:42:52] and god watched over them though they
[1:42:54] were a derelict drunk
[1:42:56] harlot prostitute whatever
[1:43:00] he watched over them because they were
[1:43:03] carrying
[1:43:08] you
[1:43:16] we have been told that the rapture is in
[1:43:19] this message
[1:43:26] we heard last night it's the
[1:43:27] resurrection we've experienced a
[1:43:30] resurrection
[1:43:32] we've already experienced the
[1:43:33] resurrection
[1:43:35] we're going to experience it in an even
[1:43:37] greater way
[1:43:42] but the token applied to our home
[1:43:47] when rahab applied the token to her home
[1:43:52] it protected her when the world fell
[1:43:55] apart
[1:44:00] i don't know but i if i could grab your
[1:44:02] thoughts just for a moment
[1:44:03] what it would have been like
[1:44:08] as the walls fall apart and the city
[1:44:12] falls apart
[1:44:16] and you just knew you was a believer
[1:44:20] and that scarlet cord that was hanging
[1:44:22] out your window
[1:44:24] was giving you protection
[1:44:32] it was everything
[1:44:36] and her responsibility was to get her
[1:44:38] family
[1:44:40] into the house now young people
[1:44:45] let me just say some things to you and i
[1:44:47] want to i want to be a brief as i can
[1:44:50] but let me just say it is in your
[1:44:53] natural genes
[1:44:54] to rebel
[1:44:59] it's in your natural genes to rebel
[1:45:03] and to turn away from parents it's just
[1:45:07] built into the natural genetic of of
[1:45:09] humans
[1:45:11] to rebel but you can overcome that
[1:45:18] you can overcome that you can be the
[1:45:20] first one at the car
[1:45:21] saying we got to get to church
[1:45:26] you can be the one that says hey we
[1:45:28] haven't prayed
[1:45:29] we haven't read our bible we haven't did
[1:45:31] our devotions today
[1:45:32] let's get that done
[1:45:37] because life is busy
[1:45:41] and and and satan is used as a tool of
[1:45:43] being busy
[1:45:44] and 24 hours can go so quickly
[1:45:48] until you neglect the thing that's going
[1:45:50] to change your body
[1:45:58] this is good y'all good stuff sister
[1:46:00] joyce
[1:46:06] rahab watched the walls fall
[1:46:18] i linked that to an experience that i
[1:46:20] had
[1:46:22] as i was they bored holes in my head
[1:46:26] put a rack on my head and i was
[1:46:29] suffering like i'd never suffered before
[1:46:32] and i was going to lay in basically an
[1:46:35] mri tube and they were going to gamma
[1:46:37] ray my
[1:46:38] brain for over three hours
[1:46:42] and i prayed that my grandchildren and
[1:46:44] my children
[1:46:46] would never have to go through anything
[1:46:47] like i was going through
[1:46:50] but at the point of it all is well
[1:46:51] here's what i want to drive
[1:46:53] there was people around the world
[1:46:55] praying for me
[1:46:58] and calling my name that i would have
[1:47:01] strength to go through it
[1:47:04] but i was the man in the arena for the
[1:47:06] day
[1:47:08] whether you know it or not it's not just
[1:47:11] ron spencer but whether you know it or
[1:47:13] not
[1:47:13] you're being prayed for around the world
[1:47:18] and we're praying for them around the
[1:47:20] world and some of them are going through
[1:47:22] difficult situations
[1:47:32] sometimes people think well cope it's
[1:47:33] such a difficult situation
[1:47:35] and it is more people have died to covet
[1:47:39] than just died in world wars and it's
[1:47:42] bad
[1:47:44] but there's worse coming
[1:47:48] there's a whole lot worse coming because
[1:47:51] covid
[1:47:52] is only a cold with a death string in it
[1:47:58] and there's two more rounds of covet
[1:48:00] coming are you scared
[1:48:02] no i i don't fear it
[1:48:06] i i don't fear the cancer
[1:48:09] why should i fear it god's greater than
[1:48:11] the cancer
[1:48:13] he's greater than the covenant
[1:48:24] can i have your attention just a few
[1:48:25] more moments
[1:48:28] abraham met melchizedek and he said
[1:48:32] literally just feet apart
[1:48:36] and looked into his eyes there was
[1:48:39] negotiations about sodom and gomorrah
[1:48:42] being destroyed god spoke to his
[1:48:45] prophet because he's got to send a
[1:48:48] warning
[1:48:50] before he sends judgment
[1:48:55] so brother branham's ministry whether it
[1:48:57] was in spindale
[1:48:59] or whether it was in jeffersonville or
[1:49:02] in
[1:49:02] finland was a warning
[1:49:07] handwriting is up on the wall the world
[1:49:10] is falling apart
[1:49:12] listen 50 years ago 60 years ago
[1:49:17] we're way down the road now due to god's
[1:49:20] long
[1:49:21] suffering and the delay
[1:49:25] but we are watching prophecy
[1:49:32] take place around us so let me just say
[1:49:36] this is no time to go to sleep
[1:49:40] and i'm driving this sermon persistence
[1:49:43] last week we spoke on the mind of a
[1:49:45] champion but now you got to be
[1:49:47] perseverant
[1:49:49] you got to be persistent you got to know
[1:49:52] where you stand it's not a time to dilly
[1:49:54] dally
[1:49:57] wish he were she well i'm just upset
[1:50:00] because of my feelings
[1:50:03] get past your human feelings
[1:50:08] get past your human unbelief
[1:50:11] grab a hold to the anchor of the word of
[1:50:14] god
[1:50:15] and hold on to it like never before
[1:50:22] what was it like for abraham to watch
[1:50:25] the smoke rise from sodom
[1:50:34] hey millions of people just perished
[1:50:42] and the smoke rises and abraham
[1:50:47] knew it was coming
[1:50:57] and the angels went and
[1:51:01] to lot's home showed him grace
[1:51:09] but look what a spiritual condition that
[1:51:11] lot was in
[1:51:13] he offered his daughters to those
[1:51:18] men
[1:51:24] but abraham knew
[1:51:27] that the god that he had set at the tent
[1:51:29] with
[1:51:31] in a few days would change his body
[1:51:39] so when he was watching the smoke rise
[1:51:44] he knew the next part was the change of
[1:51:47] his
[1:51:47] body because in that body
[1:51:50] he could not produce the challenge of
[1:51:54] the hour
[1:51:56] but in the body that melchizedek had
[1:52:00] promised him
[1:52:01] and sarah they could produce a child
[1:52:08] i can't go in a rapture in this body
[1:52:13] so if i stay waiting on the word and
[1:52:16] hanging on to it
[1:52:17] this word will more than just heal
[1:52:20] cancer
[1:52:21] it'll change my body
[1:52:36] hallelujah it'll change my voice
[1:52:47] 42-inch horns and i believe it
[1:52:50] but the man that stood in the green
[1:52:52] checkered shirt stood in this
[1:52:54] in this pulpit
[1:52:58] behind this desk and told us
[1:53:01] i was there and the horns were exactly
[1:53:04] 42
[1:53:05] inches and on the way back down off of
[1:53:07] the mountain
[1:53:09] that silver-tipped grizzly bear when the
[1:53:11] man said i can see for miles and it's
[1:53:14] not there are you doubting division
[1:53:16] sometimes i just think about people that
[1:53:18] want to walk away
[1:53:19] are you doubting the vision this ain't a
[1:53:22] time to doubt it
[1:53:28] do you know that just real quickly
[1:53:30] people that fall away from the message
[1:53:32] will say that's blue
[1:53:39] or have all kind of well that that don't
[1:53:42] shake me
[1:53:44] i don't shake me whatsoever when moses
[1:53:46] stood there with a rod in his hand
[1:53:48] and he threw it down and it produced
[1:53:50] snakes
[1:53:52] the egyptians did the same thing but god
[1:53:54] snake
[1:53:55] ate theirs and he picked it back up and
[1:53:59] it was a rod again
[1:54:01] and then fleas came and flies came and
[1:54:04] frogs came
[1:54:05] and the water became blood and they just
[1:54:07] tried to explain it away
[1:54:09] [Applause]
[1:54:10] and jesus came and he produced miracle
[1:54:13] after miracle after miracle after
[1:54:15] miracle
[1:54:16] and they just tried to explain it away
[1:54:34] uh
[1:54:42] and the message has came and they just
[1:54:45] tried to explain it away
[1:54:48] but i want to say this day is this
[1:54:50] scripture
[1:54:51] fulfilled this day
[1:54:55] we're living in this moment this is our
[1:54:58] hour this is our promise
[1:55:01] [Music]
[1:55:03] hold on to the word like never before
[1:55:09] hallelujah
[1:55:16] and let me finish with these words
[1:55:18] you're welcome to stand
[1:55:20] we're still standing
[1:55:39] i know i cannot convey my feelings right
[1:55:42] now i just cannot convey it
[1:55:44] i've had a lot of trials i've had a lot
[1:55:47] of tests
[1:55:48] i've had a lot of friends walk away i
[1:55:51] seen god doing
[1:55:53] books book of acts things in my life
[1:55:57] it happened even last night here in this
[1:56:00] building
[1:56:02] things you can't explain
[1:56:05] not just lives touched lives changed
[1:56:19] brother gene
[1:56:23] this is more than just a break for you
[1:56:26] but he came to change your life
[1:56:31] to give you a fresh drink
[1:56:36] i'd say it's good choice
[1:56:40] but nathaniel he'll not destroy you
[1:56:46] there's a blessing coming amen
[1:56:51] hallelujah can i say this to you
[1:56:56] i don't think we'll be assembling this
[1:56:58] way much longer
[1:57:00] amen
[1:57:05] look up your redemption is near
[1:57:11] look up your redemption is near
[1:57:17] look in the mirror one morning you look
[1:57:21] in there
[1:57:25] and you'll be young again
[1:57:33] it's in the promise
[1:57:38] hallelujah oh god
[1:57:43] if i could just explain what i feel i
[1:57:45] don't think there's words
[1:57:48] that can say it and put it just right
[1:57:54] but lord it's you that's kept us
[1:57:59] not just the tingle up and down our
[1:58:01] spine or
[1:58:03] something that makes us shout or jump
[1:58:06] we enjoy all of those things
[1:58:09] but something that anchors our soul
[1:58:12] when the world is falling apart
[1:58:16] whether it's rahab watching the walls
[1:58:18] fall
[1:58:19] or noah watching the water come up on
[1:58:22] the boat
[1:58:26] what it must have been like
[1:58:29] for them when they felt the boat cut
[1:58:33] and begin to float
[1:58:34] [Music]
[1:58:42] lord jesus what a day that will be
[1:58:47] when we come to this church and we're
[1:58:49] all young
[1:58:52] and we just know it's happening
[1:58:56] because we're in the vision
[1:59:00] it's not a caribou or a silver tip
[1:59:02] grizzly bear
[1:59:03] that just showed us what god can do
[1:59:07] a squirrel but we've watched the
[1:59:10] transformation
[1:59:12] from coming from a drug addict alcoholic
[1:59:16] to become an anchored son and daughter
[1:59:18] of god
[1:59:21] there's just nothing in the world
[1:59:22] that'll shake us
[1:59:28] maybe there's one this morning that just
[1:59:30] say brother ron
[1:59:32] i just need a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:59:35] his life to anchor me like never before
[1:59:40] to settle every question in my mind
[1:59:43] that it just be settled more than a
[1:59:46] picture in a church
[1:59:49] or a quote that's being written a lord
[1:59:53] anchor in my soul like never before
[1:59:57] lord god remember my loved ones my
[1:59:59] children
[2:00:00] children's children when it looks like
[2:00:04] it's totally impossible
[2:00:07] god you're a god that's faithful
[2:00:10] lord and i ask you that you'd minister
[2:00:13] minister all across this audience just
[2:00:15] now
[2:00:17] we applaud a token we took you at your
[2:00:21] word
[2:00:23] we don't want to lose a one lord jesus
[2:00:28] maybe there are those that's turned
[2:00:29] their back on you
[2:00:31] lord may you deal with their hearts even
[2:00:33] today
[2:00:35] turn them around in the name of jesus
[2:00:38] christ
[2:00:39] turned them from where they were father
[2:00:42] many years ago i remember praying a
[2:00:44] prayer such as that over a young lady
[2:00:47] her husband had left and been gone for
[2:00:49] years
[2:00:50] and god turned that man around that day
[2:00:54] he came home to be her husband later the
[2:00:57] pastor of that church
[2:00:59] but you're the same god that is here
[2:01:02] this morning father
[2:01:04] you're a god of the impossibilities
[2:01:08] in the name of jesus christ anchor our
[2:01:10] soul
[2:01:11] put a persistence in us like never
[2:01:13] before
[2:01:15] not natural persistence but anchor our
[2:01:18] soul
[2:01:19] with a heavenly realm father touch our
[2:01:22] hearts even now
[2:01:24] in jesus christ's name i pray
[2:01:27] jesus name
