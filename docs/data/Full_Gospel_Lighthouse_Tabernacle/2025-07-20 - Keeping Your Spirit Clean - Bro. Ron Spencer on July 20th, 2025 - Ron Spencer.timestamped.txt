[27:03] Maybe they play that softly as we go to
[27:05] the prayer requests this evening. Want
[27:08] to remember each and every one of our
[27:09] elderly that God would just touch them
[27:12] in a supernatural way. I want to pray
[27:15] for brother Ron Vest's friend's father
[27:18] Joe Cow's needs a touch from the Lord.
[27:21] Want to remember brother Jeff Breeden
[27:23] that God would just touch him drive out
[27:25] that cancer as well and sister Wanda
[27:28] Hinkle and just remember her and the
[27:30] family there as well as sister Teresa
[27:33] Delaney. I want to pray for them as well
[27:36] as brother Bill there. I want to
[27:38] remember our pastor this morning that
[27:39] God would just touch him, strengthen him
[27:42] in his body as he brings the word of
[27:43] life to us. How many would have an
[27:46] unspoken request you'd like to lift up
[27:48] before the Lord this morning? Amen. I'm
[27:50] going to ask brother Matt McClard if he
[27:51] would just come pray over these needs
[27:53] for us.
[27:57] Lord bless you. I got 30 seconds.
[28:00] Everybody take a deep breath in right
[28:02] now.
[28:06] The Bible says, "Let everything that
[28:10] hath breath praise the Lord."
[28:14] Come on, somebody. Your team just won
[28:16] the national championship.
[28:18] Would you maybe lift your voice? But you
[28:21] got a God that walked up Mount Calvary
[28:25] and he saved your soul and gave you the
[28:27] Holy Ghost. He healed your body. He's
[28:30] taking you in a rapture. I don't know
[28:32] about you, but if you got breath in your
[28:34] lungs this morning, why don't you give
[28:36] him praise? Hallelujah.
[28:39] Praise the Lord. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[28:44] The Bible also said they entered his
[28:46] courts with praise.
[28:50] Ain't it good to be a Christian? Amen.
[28:53] Let's bow our heads. Father,
[28:56] you're in the building this morning.
[29:00] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[29:03] Thank you for your mercy. Thank you for
[29:05] your grace. Thank you, Lord, for being
[29:08] longsuffering, Lord God. When we give up
[29:10] on oursel, Father, you didn't give up on
[29:12] us, Father. God, we've come together to
[29:15] gather, Lord, and to give you praise and
[29:16] to worship you, Lord, to hear your word,
[29:19] God, just to commune with you, Father.
[29:21] And God, we count it a great blessing to
[29:23] be in your midst, Father. Lord, everyone
[29:25] that's here, Father. God, I pray that
[29:27] you'd minister to every need, Lord. God,
[29:30] you see where they're weak, Lord. You
[29:31] see where they're struggling, God. God,
[29:33] you see where they need a word of
[29:34] encouragement, Father. God, you've
[29:36] tailor made this service, Father. God,
[29:38] that they would hear your voice. And
[29:40] Father, so we push back every demon that
[29:42] would try to break that or hinder that
[29:44] voice from being heard. But God, when
[29:46] they hear it, may they know it's
[29:48] straight from the mouth of God speaking
[29:50] to them, Father. And God, may they give
[29:53] joy. May they give their hearts to you
[29:55] this morning. And Father, I pray you
[29:56] bless Brother Ron. Lord, God, move him
[29:58] out of the way. Lord, use him like
[30:01] you've never used him before. God, may
[30:03] you minister through him, Lord Jesus.
[30:05] Move him out of the way. Not his
[30:06] thoughts, but God, may the anointing of
[30:08] God speak through our brother this
[30:10] morning, God. Lord, I pray for the ones
[30:12] that are sick.
[30:14] God, I pray you pass by that way right
[30:16] now.
[30:18] God, anoint their faith. Lord, the
[30:20] work's already done. We're already
[30:22] healed. It's already done. But God, may
[30:25] you just anoint their faith this morning
[30:27] to believe, Lord, and to start speaking
[30:29] over that cancer, to start speaking over
[30:31] that demon, Lord, that would try to
[30:33] hinder their life, Lord.
[30:35] Father, we just take this service
[30:38] committed to thy hands, Lord, knowing
[30:39] you do all things well. And God, we're
[30:42] just expecting great things this
[30:43] morning. Come and have thine own way. In
[30:46] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[30:48] pray. Amen.
[30:52] Amen. At this time, we're going to
[30:54] receive this this morning's offering.
[30:56] You give us God's blessed you. Have
[30:58] brother Marcus with us this morning.
[30:59] Glad to have him. We ask him if he would
[31:02] come and sing for us if he would. Then
[31:04] we'll have the adult choir after him
[31:06] this morning. God bless you. You can be
[31:07] seated after you've given.
[31:39] I've I've heard the song sung recently
[31:42] as a congregation.
[31:45] I was 12 years old. was the first song I
[31:47] sang in the house of the Lord and it was
[31:50] always a prayer in my heart was a part
[31:52] of it sounds like maybe for the ministry
[31:55] but we all know God uses us all in
[31:57] different ways of the ministry and
[32:00] preaching is not my calling we know but
[32:03] little nostalgia for me but I think it's
[32:05] a song of worship Jesus use me

[54:16] spirit clean.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:19] This might be one of the most
[54:22] important sermons that I've ever
[54:24] preached to you.
[54:26] You must keep your spirit clean.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 3 and verse 14.
[54:36] These are the conditions of the age that
[54:38] you're you're having to condemn with.
[54:41] And unto the angel of the church of the
[54:42] Leoysians, write these things saith the
[54:46] Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
[54:49] beginning of the creation of God. I know
[54:52] thy works. Thou art neither cold nor
[54:54] hot. And I would that thou were cold or
[54:56] hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm,
[54:59] and neither cold nor hot, I will spew
[55:01] thee out of my mouth. And because thou
[55:05] sayest, I am rich and increase with
[55:07] goods, and have need of nothing, and
[55:09] knowest not that thou art wretched, and
[55:12] miserable, and poor, blind, and naked.
[55:15] And I'd say this, we can agree with
[55:17] that.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:19] And I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[55:21] tried in the fire, that thou mayest be
[55:23] rich and in white raignment, that thou
[55:26] mayest be clothed, and the shame of thy
[55:27] nakedness do not appear. And anoint
[55:30] thine eyes with that thou mayest see. As
[55:34] many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be
[55:37] zealous, therefore, and repent. Amen.
[55:41] God may God bless the reading of his
[55:42] word. You may be seated.
[55:49] I mentioned to sister Connie this week
[55:51] what I was planning to speak on Monday
[55:54] and when I just said the words it the
[55:56] spirit of the Lord just filled the car
[56:01] and I thought this is a special moment.
[56:04] I remember many years ago in our young
[56:06] ministry
[56:09] uh
[56:11] once again when God calls a man he calls
[56:13] his wife. in our young ministry. We we
[56:16] had we had went through some things and
[56:20] and
[56:22] one particular fellow had stabbed me and
[56:24] pretty bad and murdered m maybe murdered
[56:29] me in his in his thoughts and you know
[56:32] sticks and stones may break your bones
[56:34] but words will never hurt. Well, that's
[56:35] not exactly true. And I could tell that
[56:38] it was wiring on Sister Connie. And and
[56:40] and it was a it was a day, it might have
[56:44] been a Saturday that I can remember. And
[56:46] I told her, I said, "Sister Connie, we
[56:49] need to take a walk."
[56:51] And so we own 90 acres of woods and we
[56:54] have a brother Homer built a road all
[56:56] the way around that so we could hunt
[56:58] there. And so, and so anyway, uh we were
[57:02] just taking a walk on that road and I
[57:05] said, "Connie, I'm your husband,
[57:07] but I'm also your pastor.
[57:10] I'm your shepherd.
[57:12] Now, today, I need to talk to you." Now,
[57:15] in talking to you, I need to just to
[57:17] just to tell you some things that that
[57:20] this will help you. No matter what
[57:22] happens in life,
[57:24] no matter what comes your way, no matter
[57:27] how difficult that people say things
[57:30] against you, all of that is planned. God
[57:33] knows all about it. God doesn't ring his
[57:36] hands,
[57:37] but you have a responsibility, Connie.
[57:41] You got to keep your spirit clean.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; So today, I want to take you all on a
[57:47] walk.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] I I was telling Andrew the other day, I
[57:52] said, "You know, you know, Brother
[57:55] Brandon would share that when he was
[57:56] walking for that place where he would go
[58:00] and uh and and people wouldn't pay their
[58:03] light bill and he would go house to
[58:06] house and he would sit on their porch
[58:08] and talk to them." Let me just tell you
[58:11] something. I want to be really honest
[58:12] with you. I don't know if I've ever been
[58:13] late on a bill in my life, but I would
[58:16] purposely not pay my bill.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; For brother Brandham to come and sit on
[58:24] my porch
[58:25] &gt;&gt; for a while and just begin to tell a few
[58:28] stories and and he would sit there and
[58:31] you know what an atmosphere that that
[58:33] would be like
[58:35] &gt;&gt; and uh you know just have him there. I
[58:39] remember brother Shrewsbury before I get
[58:41] too started. Brother Shrewsbury said he
[58:42] was he was having a hitch on his on his
[58:47] vehicle welded. They were out in out in
[58:49] Colorado and and they were in the same
[58:52] vicinity where brother Brandham hunted.
[58:55] And uh this guy looked up at his license
[58:57] plate and it said West Virginia. And he
[58:59] said, "How closer are you to
[59:01] Jeffersonville?"
[59:03] He said, "Well, a few hours away." And
[59:05] he said, "Why would you say
[59:07] Jeffersonville?"
[59:09] He said, 'Look down the road right there
[59:10] is a store. It's got a porch on it. And
[59:13] he said that that that porch, Brother
[59:18] William Brandham, I don't know if you
[59:19] ever knew him. Said, "Yeah, I preached
[59:23] the message that he preached." He said,
[59:25] "Well, he used to come and sit on that
[59:27] porch when he would come here hunting."
[59:29] &gt;&gt; And he said, "We'd fill that porch up
[59:31] just to listen to his stories."
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not brother Brandham,
[59:38] but I'd like to take you on a walk.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He said in
[59:45] dedication of a building, he said, "This
[59:48] tabernacle now belongs to God Almighty."
[59:52] He said, "You belong to God.
[59:56] God Almighty,
[59:58] always keep yourself clean.
[1:00:02] Keep your church clean.
[1:00:04] keep it upright so that anyone who
[1:00:07] travels might love to come in and
[1:00:11] fellowship with you and have such a
[1:00:14] sweet spirit till you can reach out a
[1:00:18] hand to anyone and offer them help. I
[1:00:23] want to say this preface before I'm
[1:00:25] preaching this sermon. I don't have
[1:00:27] anyone in mind. I just I just feel led
[1:00:29] to preach it.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says now he said stay with it.
[1:00:35] Don't never let that spirit of worship
[1:00:39] and that clean holiness ever die among
[1:00:43] you.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; I think that's so powerful.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Never let the spirit of worship and that
[1:00:50] clean holiness ever die among you. Can
[1:00:53] you imagine what he was seeing in the
[1:00:55] church world in that day and what we
[1:00:58] would see in the church world in this
[1:00:59] day? They let it die. Keep that light
[1:01:03] burning for if it's a lifeline of the
[1:01:07] church. He said, "That's right. It's
[1:01:09] Christ in his church."
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would mention a few
[1:01:16] sermons that I that I've drawn a lot of
[1:01:18] things from. Is your life worthy of the
[1:01:20] gospel?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; The token and the greatest battle that's
[1:01:25] ever fought among many others. Brother
[1:01:27] Brandham would tell us that that God
[1:01:30] chose a place where the battleground
[1:01:32] would be in our life,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; It would be in our mind.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; I think if we were all honest today, we
[1:01:40] could raise our hands and say, "I battle
[1:01:43] in my mind."
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; I battle in my mind. No matter how long
[1:01:51] you've been a Christian,
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You know, sometimes the
[1:01:56] devil beats you around. You've been a
[1:01:57] Christian for 30 years and still things
[1:02:00] come into your mind that
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; where where did that come from?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I was singing a love song to Connie this
[1:02:10] morning and it wasn't Amazing Grace. And
[1:02:14] and you think, where did that come from?
[1:02:21] Don't vote me out.
[1:02:25] Now, if there's a place that we've got
[1:02:28] to stay is under the blood.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; That's the place that we've got to stay.
[1:02:34] We got to stay in the spirit. Create an
[1:02:36] atmosphere. If you remember, brother Ram
[1:02:38] says, "And isn't anything too hard for
[1:02:41] the Lord?" You remember the visitation,
[1:02:44] Melzdc is on his way with the angels and
[1:02:47] steps into a body. And brother Ba
[1:02:49] explains how the theophony works.
[1:02:52] and and and here on earth on the day of
[1:02:55] the visitation,
[1:02:56] the day God himself is going to visit in
[1:03:01] their home,
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; they've been walking with God now for
[1:03:06] decades,
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; And you know,
[1:03:10] Sarah's getting old, Abraham's getting
[1:03:13] old, and he's still believing the
[1:03:15] promise. And it just so happens to be a
[1:03:18] day to where Sarah is in a mood.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Stay with me now.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Sarah's in a mood. She's thinking about
[1:03:28] Mrs. Lot. The caravans go by her house
[1:03:32] and they've got nice hats and they got
[1:03:35] nice clothes and
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; we're out here in a desert and things
[1:03:41] are hot and things are dusty.
[1:03:44] She was in a mood,
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; But he said Abraham was sitting outside.
[1:03:51] Sometimes it's a place you got to go
[1:03:53] set.
[1:03:55] And he was sitting outside and he was
[1:03:57] keeping Brother Brandon said he was
[1:03:59] keeping himself in an atmosphere.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Keeping himself in an atmosphere. He
[1:04:05] didn't know God was coming.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; God hadn't sent him a letter that I'm
[1:04:11] coming by. No messenger had came. No one
[1:04:14] had came to talk to him and said, "Now
[1:04:16] listen, God himself in a theophony body
[1:04:20] is coming."
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; But yet he kept himself in an
[1:04:28] atmosphere.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "Where where is that important,
[1:04:31] brother Ron?" We are ready for rapture.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be just another
[1:04:38] typical day.
[1:04:42] We've already had our messenger. There's
[1:04:44] not another one coming.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Greatest man since Jesus Christ.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; I appreciated what brother Andrew said
[1:04:55] about him last night. There'll never be
[1:04:56] another messenger.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; We as the five-fold ministry all have
[1:05:01] our different gifts.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; We're all part of the toolbox that God
[1:05:05] used, the dressear that God uses.
[1:05:10] None of us tries to imitate brother
[1:05:12] Brandham or try to be like him.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; We don't need impersonators.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; But but we understand that we've got to
[1:05:24] be ready.
[1:05:26] Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; And if we could understand readiness,
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; I did a study and I preached when I was
[1:05:34] at my dad's church because I met a
[1:05:37] general
[1:05:38] and he began to talk to me about the
[1:05:40] readiness of the nuclear. And he had
[1:05:44] been a general in the nuclear
[1:05:45] department. And he just shared a few
[1:05:47] things with me. Nothing that was secret,
[1:05:49] but he shared a few things with me. He
[1:05:52] said, "You don't understand readiness.
[1:05:55] He said, "We're ready." He said,
[1:05:58] "Because if a bomb would come from
[1:06:01] Russia,
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; we've either got to intercept it or
[1:06:05] we've got to send one there."
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Once the exchange begins
[1:06:10] to happen, there's no stopping."
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; There's no stopping. But before a bomb
[1:06:16] can drop,
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; an atomic bomb can drop, listen, they're
[1:06:21] getting ready to come.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; They're getting ready to come. You can
[1:06:25] say, "Oh, but we're America's going to
[1:06:27] be in a revival." They're coming.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; They're coming. Los Angeles going to
[1:06:32] have an earthquake.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; It's coming.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; That's not up for battle. Sodom and
[1:06:38] Gomorrah is here.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Political system is rotten. Educational
[1:06:44] system is rotten. But there's a bride
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; that has kept herself in an atmosphere.
[1:06:58] We got to have our heart ready.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; We got to make sure you you know I think
[1:07:04] about it. I I I think about,
[1:07:08] you know, how we must stay clean.
[1:07:12] I don't think I can describe it well
[1:07:14] enough.
[1:07:16] Our holiness just doesn't fit. We got to
[1:07:18] have God's holiness and and God's
[1:07:20] righteousness. That's right.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; That's why we got to repent.
[1:07:25] It's why we got to have a prayer life.
[1:07:27] The the word you have a relationship
[1:07:30] with God. You say, "Well, brother Ron,
[1:07:32] I'm a young person and I don't know how
[1:07:34] to pray." Talk to God like he's your
[1:07:37] best friend. That's
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Now, don't text him.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Don't text him. Talk to him. Come on,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; talk to him. Because out of your being,
[1:07:51] you speak.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; And if you listen to somebody long
[1:07:55] enough, you know what's inside their
[1:07:57] heart.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:08:03] The power of God wants to reside in your
[1:08:06] life. It wants to live inside of you. It
[1:08:09] won't live in It won't live in the
[1:08:11] structure here, but he wants to live on
[1:08:13] the inside of you.
[1:08:16] But if God wants to live there, he will
[1:08:18] not live in an unclean vessel.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; You can't be one way on Sunday.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; I don't think I need to preach this, but
[1:08:32] another way on Monday.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; You can't present yourself one way and
[1:08:39] then not another way
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; and be accepted by God. Now listen, this
[1:08:46] world will never be comfortable with us.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; So you're always going to feel that
[1:08:51] little badger working on you.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Listen, you'll never
[1:08:58] be won over by the world.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; And listen, you're going to always feel
[1:09:05] left out, rejected.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; You're always going to feel, well, I'm a
[1:09:11] little bit of an odd bird. Well, that's
[1:09:13] okay.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; It's okay to be odd.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, my mind, my mind. I
[1:09:24] just so many things in my mind. The
[1:09:27] scripture says renewing of the mind.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; There's things that you must pray for.
[1:09:32] God, help me
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; to have these memories
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; taken from my mind.
[1:09:43] Brother Matt Watkins said something the
[1:09:45] other day and I don't never want it to
[1:09:47] be forgotten.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Feelings are overrated.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Look over at your neighbor, say
[1:09:56] feelings.
[1:10:06] Now, you can't pour living water in a
[1:10:09] contaminated pipe.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; I used to work in a facility and I I was
[1:10:16] a chief operator in nitroglycerin. We
[1:10:20] made nitroglycerin
[1:10:22] and and then from that we contaminated
[1:10:24] the water by by making nitroglycerin and
[1:10:27] through that we had to have chemicals to
[1:10:30] treat it and then there was a phenomenal
[1:10:33] filter system and then that that water
[1:10:36] had to be able to be turned back into
[1:10:38] the river. So I was responsible to make
[1:10:41] sure that I could drink the water.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. that I could drink the water that
[1:10:49] I had now filtered.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And if you think about that today,
[1:10:59] could your neighbor say that life that
[1:11:02] you are living
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; is the life of Christ. I'm not talking
[1:11:08] about quotes.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about pictures on the
[1:11:11] wall.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:14] I'm not talking about he said, she said,
[1:11:16] but do they recognize the power of the
[1:11:19] living Christ
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; coming out of your life?
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember remember there's
[1:11:27] seven holes in your head.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Two ears,
[1:11:37] two nostrils,
[1:11:39] and two eyes.
[1:11:41] The ears and the eyes are the gateway to
[1:11:43] your soul. Be careful what you're
[1:11:46] allowing to go in them.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, I realize I'm
[1:11:53] going to get to that other one in a
[1:11:54] minute cuz that's the one that causes
[1:11:56] you trouble.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I realize that we're young. We're
[1:12:01] we're busy. We got to be entertained
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; every moment of the day. That's the why
[1:12:10] that that's the why we don't like long
[1:12:12] sermons because we we lose our our
[1:12:15] thoughts our you know we you know
[1:12:18] because commercials even now are 28
[1:12:20] seconds it seems like and there's 10 of
[1:12:23] them
[1:12:25] so we lose track so quickly
[1:12:29] and that's why gaming becomes such an
[1:12:31] issue.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Before long our children are gaming. I
[1:12:36] mean, they're gaming and gaming and
[1:12:37] gaming and gaming and it takes you
[1:12:39] somewhere and your mind, you don't
[1:12:42] realize the influence that's behind the
[1:12:44] game.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Parents, you're responsible.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; I know I'm not telling you nothing new,
[1:12:52] but you're responsible to hold the token
[1:12:55] over your house.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Just like a dress, just like a pants.
[1:13:04] You know, we preach on boys that with
[1:13:06] their skinny jeans and their great big
[1:13:08] necklaces and all these different kind
[1:13:10] of things, but where does the influence
[1:13:12] come from?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Girls, where the where's the dressing
[1:13:16] comes from? Before long, the heels are
[1:13:18] like this and the heels are like that.
[1:13:21] Brother Tom Ray said the other day said,
[1:13:23] "I'm gonna bring a chainsaw to church."
[1:13:30] I haven't looked. So,
[1:13:34] I'll have Matthew do that.
[1:13:39] But the one that causes us the most
[1:13:40] trouble is our tongue.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Life and death is in the power of the
[1:13:48] tongue.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; That's what your scripture says. And you
[1:13:53] can create a negative atmosphere
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; by just a few words.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; But what about the opposite of that?
[1:14:01] Let's create a powerful faith
[1:14:04] atmosphere.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Notice every one of us are influencing
[1:14:12] somebody. Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; One of my neighbors, we were chasing
[1:14:16] cows last week and and uh when I got
[1:14:19] home, I was in my suit and there was
[1:14:21] about eight cows in my my my my fields
[1:14:25] and uh I said, "Well, I got to find out
[1:14:27] where these are coming from." And so I
[1:14:29] went to I went to one neighbor. No, not
[1:14:31] there. They're not mine, but you can go
[1:14:32] over to that one. But he's got a bad dog
[1:14:34] over there. Well, I never saw the dog.
[1:14:36] And I went and he's big old boy like
[1:14:38] brother Josh back there. And he come out
[1:14:40] and he looked at me in a suit.
[1:14:43] Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And I'm on my buggy and and I said, "I
[1:14:48] can show you where the cows are." You
[1:14:50] know, he came back a little bit later
[1:14:51] and and uh we got one set up and then we
[1:14:54] came back another and got another set up
[1:14:56] and we still had one missing.
[1:15:00] So he asked my granddaughters, he said,
[1:15:01] "Where's that fancy guy at?"
[1:15:08] So he knocked on the door and here I
[1:15:10] come out in sweats and a t-shirt. fancy
[1:15:12] guy's gone.
[1:15:14] Glory.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; So, we spent the evening. 9:00 was the
[1:15:20] last time that we were still still out
[1:15:22] looking for one of them. And another
[1:15:24] neighbor, I I pulled up beside him and
[1:15:26] we begin to talk about life and how life
[1:15:28] was. And talk about something. He said,
[1:15:30] "I want to I want to tell you something.
[1:15:32] If I've ever saw a Christian, it's you."
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I thought I felt like
[1:15:38] weeping. I'd hardly I'd h hardly had any
[1:15:41] conversation with him at all. He said,
[1:15:43] 'If I've ever sought a Christian, it's
[1:15:45] you. And he said, 'I mean something to
[1:15:47] me. He said, I'll tell you what it means
[1:15:49] to me. If I had a real need, I'd call
[1:15:51] you and say, would you pray for me?
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not really not talking about just
[1:15:56] me. I'm talking about you.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you. Could your
[1:16:00] friends call you up and say, "I got a
[1:16:02] need." Right.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram say I've always I've always
[1:16:10] thought this is a powerful quote. If you
[1:16:13] want to find out how great you are,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; put your finger in a pool of water or a
[1:16:19] bucket of water and then pull your
[1:16:21] finger out and try to find where you put
[1:16:24] your finger in.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; He said you're nothing.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; God can can do without you. Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam's just laying it right down
[1:16:35] for us.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; God can do without you. He can do
[1:16:40] without me.
[1:16:43] But we cannot do without him.
[1:16:56] We have to have him.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; For he is life
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; and he alone. Not to know a book, not to
[1:17:07] know this or know that or some creed,
[1:17:10] but to know him is life. to know him as
[1:17:14] a person as Christ in you, the word made
[1:17:18] flesh.
[1:17:22] Jesus would even say it,
[1:17:25] I can do nothing
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; except my father showed me. And I think
[1:17:29] it's about 17 different ways that he
[1:17:32] says that in the scriptures. If Jesus
[1:17:34] could say that,
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; oh, don't you love the Lord?
[1:17:50] In Psalms chapter 51 and verse 6, I'd
[1:17:54] like you to pick that up with me. Psalms
[1:17:56] 51 and verse 6.
[1:18:01] This is a powerful scripture because
[1:18:03] David just opens his heart.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Behold, thou desires truth in the inward
[1:18:14] parts and in the hidden part that thou
[1:18:17] shalt make me to know wisdom.
[1:18:20] Purge me with hissip and I shall be
[1:18:23] clean. Wash me and I shall be whiter
[1:18:27] than snow.
[1:18:29] Make me to hear joy and gladness, that
[1:18:32] the bones which thou hast broken may
[1:18:35] rejoice. Hide thy face from my sins, and
[1:18:39] blot out my iniquities.
[1:18:43] Notice these next words. Let's just say
[1:18:45] it together. Create in me a clean heart,
[1:18:49] oh God, and renew a right spirit within
[1:18:53] me. Cast me not away from thy presence,
[1:18:57] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:19:00] Notice these words. Restore unto me the
[1:19:04] joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with
[1:19:08] a free spirit.
[1:19:12] David of all people
[1:19:15] could say this.
[1:19:17] David was forgotten as a child. You you
[1:19:20] imagine how difficult that is to be
[1:19:22] forgotten.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:25] When the boys are lined up, who's going
[1:19:27] to be the next king?
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Jesse doesn't call him.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, that leaves a chip on your
[1:19:34] shoulder.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; That gets in your spirit.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And then when it comes to battle
[1:19:42] Goliath, when he walks up, his brothers
[1:19:45] make fun of him,
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; And he starts fighting the battle of
[1:19:50] intimidation. All right.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Another chip on the SP. You imagine it
[1:19:55] gets in your spirit.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; He goes before Saul and Saul makes fun
[1:20:03] of him.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Then he goes before Goliath and Goliath
[1:20:10] makes fun of him.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Then he kills Goliath.
[1:20:16] Then war after war, he's killing his
[1:20:18] thousands. And the girls begin to sing.
[1:20:20] He's killed his tens of thousands. Saul
[1:20:23] has killed his thousands. David's killed
[1:20:25] his tens of thousands. He winds up in
[1:20:27] the house of Saul.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; And Saul now wants to kill him.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; You ever get to a spot to where you go,
[1:20:37] I can do no right.
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; He gets married to Saul's daughter.
[1:20:49] Then he finds himself exiled
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; without a home, without family,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; but I want to remind you all of these
[1:21:00] journeys, all of these parts of the
[1:21:02] journey, he's still God's.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; He's still God's. God's still got a
[1:21:09] plan. God's potential is laying inside
[1:21:12] of him. I don't care what stage of the
[1:21:14] journey that you're going through and
[1:21:16] how your feelings are getting hurt and
[1:21:18] the difficulties of the valley of the
[1:21:21] shadow of death
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; and your spirit is constantly at war,
[1:21:25] you're still God's.
[1:21:35] I thought about going back from exile,
[1:21:40] back to his wife.
[1:21:42] And now Saul has given his childhood
[1:21:46] wife that he won in the battle of
[1:21:48] Goliath to another man.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; You talking about life stinking?
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; I'm finally home.
[1:22:04] Well, obviously he got her back.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know specifically if I'd want
[1:22:12] her, but
[1:22:23] David, the ark of the Lord is being
[1:22:25] restored back to its rightful place. And
[1:22:27] David gets so excited,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; he dances. Right?
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've you look at it,
[1:22:34] but he dances 17 miles.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, he dances.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; He's more than his flesh. He's in the
[1:22:43] spirit.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; He dances.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; You know, people don't want emotion in
[1:22:48] the church are dead.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; But they don't get that out of the
[1:22:52] Bible.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, Brother Bram said such
[1:22:58] and such. I can't find it.
[1:23:01] I got the same message you got laying in
[1:23:03] front of you.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; I find Brother Brandham dancing around a
[1:23:07] tree.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; I find Brother Brandham sitting on the
[1:23:10] platform and dangling to his feet. I
[1:23:12] find him running up and down the aisles.
[1:23:15] I find him going all across.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; So I'm not reading the same message.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, "Anything without
[1:23:23] emotion is dead."
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, we don't like your emotion.
[1:23:28] Cut it off.
[1:23:30] We don't need you watching. No way.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; What are you doing, brother? I'm keeping
[1:23:42] my spirit clean.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; And he gets done dancing and he comes
[1:23:53] back to the house and his wife is making
[1:23:56] fun of him. Right?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Listen, there's no
[1:24:00] careful how I say this.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; There's nobody can get to your heart or
[1:24:06] to your spirit like somebody close to
[1:24:08] you. That's
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; But the devil won't only use your enemy.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; He'll use your closest friends.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Well, brother,
[1:24:25] let me just say this to you. I don't
[1:24:26] care how old you get, you're still going
[1:24:28] to be at war with this.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to call your ages now,
[1:24:36] but you can be my age and your friends
[1:24:39] all of a sudden turn into a bunch of
[1:24:42] teenage girls Barbie dolls
[1:24:44] in a drama class
[1:24:48] and you think, "What in God's names
[1:24:49] happened here?"
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in spite of all that, you have
[1:24:54] got to keep your spirit clean.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; They will get it worked out.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, how does that work? You
[1:25:04] remember when you was a little child,
[1:25:06] your mom and daddy had a tiff.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Boy, I'm preaching to angels.
[1:25:14] and your mom and daddy had a little tiff
[1:25:16] in the kitchen and you as children went,
[1:25:18] "Oh my goodness,
[1:25:20] they're arguing.
[1:25:23] They're getting loud." And you go up and
[1:25:26] you pray. Well, your mom and dad go
[1:25:28] somewhere and fix it.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; They go somewhere and fix it and it's
[1:25:38] over.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; It's over. But you as a child don't know
[1:25:43] it's over.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; That happens as grown-ups, too.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; God will go fix it and then you few in
[1:25:53] your flesh, if you're not careful, are
[1:25:55] still in the same mind frame.
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; So, you got to keep your spirit clean.
[1:26:03] That's good.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; I got a reason for saying that. Cuz many
[1:26:11] times people will come into church and
[1:26:14] they've had a history in their life and
[1:26:16] you're thinking about their history, but
[1:26:19] they went and got it fixed.
[1:26:30] And they're not the same person anymore.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; So you got to get your spirit clean.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm preaching the right sermon to
[1:26:47] the right people. Hallelujah. That's a
[1:26:48] great thing.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5. in Jesus's preaching.
[1:26:55] And he opened his mouth and he taught
[1:26:57] them, saying, "Blessed are the pure and
[1:26:59] poor in spirit, for theirs is the
[1:27:01] kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that
[1:27:03] mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[1:27:05] Blessed are the meek, for they shall
[1:27:07] inherit the earth." In the scriptures,
[1:27:10] it talks about a man writing about
[1:27:12] himself that he was the meakest man in
[1:27:14] the earth.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; How many of you can tell me who that
[1:27:18] was?
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[1:27:21] Moses wrote had to write about himself
[1:27:25] that he was the meakest man in the earth
[1:27:27] yet he was tempered
[1:27:30] and that temper was not in a good way.
[1:27:34] But we're not going to talk about that.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; But I want you to think, Matthew, you're
[1:27:38] going to like this. Meekness is not
[1:27:41] weakness.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; He was a one-man invasion.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Into the greatest military power of that
[1:27:54] day.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; The high civilization of that day. He
[1:27:58] comes in not in a three-piece suit,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; but with a long stick in his hand.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; With I am in his lips.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; He was not a weak man walking in. He was
[1:28:14] a meek man walking in.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; A one-man invasion. Listen, that nation
[1:28:22] did not realize
[1:28:26] that their history was about over with.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; They had fought no a lot of wars,
[1:28:36] but they were coming to an end.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Well, show me a picture of the end. If
[1:28:43] we could show the picture of the United
[1:28:45] States has had their messenger. That's
[1:28:48] right.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't come out of no halls of great
[1:28:52] learning.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; He was met by an angel
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; in a cave.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And listen, America was going to get a
[1:29:03] warning.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; There was going to be a lot of great
[1:29:06] speakers come on the scene at the same
[1:29:08] time from Billy Graham and Oral Roberts
[1:29:11] and I don't want to go down the whole
[1:29:12] list, but a phenomenal speakers. But one
[1:29:16] man had an angel with him
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; and he was going to send a message
[1:29:21] around the world.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; He would preach to presidents and he
[1:29:27] would preach to great congressmen.
[1:29:30] The miracles that would follow him were
[1:29:34] beyond phenomenal.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; But that was only to catch the
[1:29:38] attention. But there was a bride
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; that could exemplify humility and
[1:29:47] meekness.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; But don't let that catch you. We are the
[1:29:52] most powerful people in the earth.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; We are not a bunch of drama students.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; We're not a bunch of people that are up
[1:30:05] and down all the time.
[1:30:08] Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; I wonder if I'm in. I wonder if I'm out.
[1:30:12] Listen, we're steady sons and daughters
[1:30:14] of God.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; We're powerp packed individual. When the
[1:30:19] weakest of Christians go on their knees,
[1:30:21] they shake the kingdom of hell.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Our families are strong.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Our families, our character is strong.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. This
[1:30:36] message works.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus would say this, you're the salt of
[1:30:44] the earth. If you remember what salt is
[1:30:46] used for is to preserve,
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; It's to preserve.
[1:30:53] Many of you are gardeners here. Now,
[1:30:56] listen. I love fresh tomatoes. I love
[1:30:58] them.
[1:31:00] I love them. I love them too much.
[1:31:05] I love fresh peaches. I love fresh
[1:31:08] apples.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I love fresh donuts.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Catching you. See if he was asleep.
[1:31:22] But you can't keep tomatoes but just a
[1:31:24] few days.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; You can't keep apples but just a few
[1:31:27] days. I'm I'm coming to you.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; So you got to put salt in them. You got
[1:31:32] to put a brine to them. I don't know how
[1:31:33] to do it. I just trust you.
[1:31:37] And you can eat them babies 10 years
[1:31:39] later.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; If the seal has not been broken,
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; But too many times, churches become
[1:31:48] rotten
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; because their spirit is not clean by the
[1:31:54] salt of the word of God.
[1:31:58] And before long, church members
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; are just rotten. Pull pits become
[1:32:04] rotten.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Listen, there ain't nothing about rotten
[1:32:09] I want to eat.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take but one bad apple
[1:32:21] to run a bushel. Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; If it's left alone,
[1:32:26] it'll contaminate others.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; It'll contaminate others.
[1:32:32] Now, there's sometimes we have our
[1:32:33] little children as they begin to grow up
[1:32:34] and they've got cute ways. They're
[1:32:37] naughty, but they're cute.
[1:32:40] If you leave that alone,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; they get past the fouryear-old
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; and before long, little brats
[1:32:54] become bitter breaths.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; And you know what we'll do? We'll blame
[1:32:58] the teacher
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; cuz we don't want to take
[1:33:03] responsibility. Stinking teachers
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; and then we'll blame bosses.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; We'll blame UVA teachers. You know, once
[1:33:17] they go up, they'll keep because you
[1:33:19] didn't do your job.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; You didn't take responsibility.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I love my child so much. We put
[1:33:28] him in the corner. What if that don't
[1:33:30] work?
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, I just love my baby
[1:33:44] so much. That ain't love.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; If you love them, you'll straighten them
[1:33:49] out.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; If you truly love I'm not talking about
[1:33:57] beat him with anger.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Have a conversation. This is why I got
[1:34:02] to do it.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Not that you got such a hot head and
[1:34:07] things ain't going your way.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Let me say this right here. No home
[1:34:15] should be an abusive home.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; No home.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; No home.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, my wife my my my wife beats
[1:34:24] me.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; My husband beats me. Leave.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Leave his stinking.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Not going to finish it. Leave him.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz it will not get better without a
[1:34:41] conversion.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:44] Brother, I'll marry him and I'll
[1:34:46] straighten him out. No, you won't. You
[1:34:47] ain't got
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, I I
[1:34:58] can straighten people out. Okay, go on a
[1:35:01] diet.
[1:35:06] Go on a diet
[1:35:08] and come back to me three weeks later
[1:35:11] and tell me you haven't had sugar.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; I got weak, brother.
[1:35:21] I got weak. And there that crispy crew
[1:35:25] and it looked so lonely.
[1:35:32] I had a bowl of spaghetti that big.
[1:35:36] The posture was so great. I just
[1:35:38] couldn't resist.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And you can change. You can't change
[1:35:44] yourself.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; You can't change yourself. Well, Brother
[1:35:50] Ron, how do I keep my spirit clean?
[1:35:52] Prayer.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Reading your Bible and praying and
[1:35:56] listening to the message. Stay in the
[1:35:59] atmosphere of God.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Don't You don't need self-help books.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; You don't need to go to Barnes & Noble
[1:36:08] and spend $500 on how to help yourself.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; The only guy you're going to make rich
[1:36:14] is the guy that wrote that book.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I get so tickled to have a book out, How
[1:36:22] to Become Rich.
[1:36:25] You read this book, you'll learn the
[1:36:27] secrets of how to become rich.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; $49.95.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; You know who got rich? The guy that
[1:36:36] wrote the book.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, who do I go to right
[1:36:41] here?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; This book right here
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; will take care of your financial
[1:36:48] situations.
[1:37:01] Brother Ron, you're tell you're you're
[1:37:02] messing with me now. Okay,
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; brother, I want to take my money and I
[1:37:06] want to make an investment into my
[1:37:08] future. I don't know if you know this or
[1:37:10] not, and I'm not a money preacher, but
[1:37:14] when that plate passes by you,
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; you are making an investment in your
[1:37:22] future,
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; that's just not an investment for here
[1:37:35] when you get to heaven.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; The things that you've done on earth for
[1:37:43] Jesus, then when you get to heaven,
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; okay,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; now I'm going to meddle.
[1:37:55] Jesus said in Luke 17 verse1, "Don't you
[1:37:58] tighten up on me
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; cuz we're walking. Don't you can't
[1:38:01] tighten up and walking. You'll hurt your
[1:38:03] back."
[1:38:06] Then said he unto the disciples,
[1:38:09] it is impossible but that offenses
[1:38:13] it is impossible but that offenses will
[1:38:17] come.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; But woe unto them through whom they
[1:38:22] come.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Listen. Offenses is going to come your
[1:38:25] way.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna say it again. Offences is
[1:38:30] going to come your way.
[1:38:34] Is this working?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Offenses is going to come your way.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; But notice the next part. But woe unto
[1:38:42] them.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Don't take your gun out and shoot them.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; God will take care of you.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; He will fight for you.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; So when somebody says something, don't
[1:38:54] empty your mind. You need that.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; But woe unto them whom they come.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:03] They are going to have a payday.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Notice now, brother, I need proof. Okay,
[1:39:11] next verse. It were better for them that
[1:39:15] a millang stone was hanged about his
[1:39:18] neck, and he was cast into the sea than
[1:39:21] he that should offend one of these
[1:39:24] little ones. I don't think you got it.
[1:39:26] Let's read it together.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; you read it.
[1:39:43] Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Look to your neighbor. Say, "Did you get
[1:39:45] that?"
[1:39:52] So the next time,
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; the next time somebody gets in your
[1:40:00] spirit,
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; remember this scripture,
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; They have a payday
[1:40:08] coming.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; As sure as the sun will come up
[1:40:14] tomorrow.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:17] This is part of keeping your spirit
[1:40:18] clean. That's right.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Don't you try to fix it.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; God's got it.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; This is what I told Sister Connie
[1:40:31] probably 25 years ago. I said, "You
[1:40:33] don't have to fix this."
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And she didn't have to fix it. You just
[1:40:40] do the next part. Forgive.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:47] Take heed unto yourself. If any brother
[1:40:48] trespass against thee, rebuke him. And
[1:40:51] if he repent, forgive him. And if he
[1:40:53] trespasses against thee seven times a
[1:40:55] day, and seven times in a day, turn
[1:40:58] again and thee to thee and saying, I
[1:41:00] repent, thou shalt forgive him. He don't
[1:41:03] say it just once, he says it twice. And
[1:41:06] then Matthew chapter 18 verse 21. And
[1:41:08] then came Peter to him and said,"Lord,
[1:41:12] how often of all people that ask this,
[1:41:14] Peter,
[1:41:20] there always going to be one in the
[1:41:21] crowd, baby."
[1:41:23] And then Peter said unto him, "Lord, how
[1:41:26] often shall my brother sin against me,
[1:41:29] and I forgive him?" Now, he was looking
[1:41:32] for a hammer.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:38] till seven times. And Jesus saith unto
[1:41:41] him, I say not unto thee until seven
[1:41:44] times, but until 70*
[1:41:49] 7.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; So don't make fodder out of them at the
[1:41:57] supper table.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Don't kill the preacher at the supper
[1:42:03] table.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Forgive him.
[1:42:06] Not just once to soothe your conscience.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; 490 times a day.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Why, brother Ron? To keep you clean.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to keep him clean,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; but to keep you clean.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Now remember, character is the only
[1:42:31] thing that you're going to take with
[1:42:32] you.
[1:42:36] You're not going to take
[1:42:38] asphalt,
[1:42:40] gold that is in heaven.
[1:42:45] You're not going to take your gold.
[1:42:47] Brother Homer, almost every funeral
[1:42:49] would say there's no U-Haul following
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; the casket.
[1:42:58] Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; For most of us,
[1:43:02] there's not great big executives of the
[1:43:04] world coming to see our funeral.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; I've got friends that I if I would have
[1:43:11] a funeral, I got friends that would show
[1:43:13] up looking like the mafia. Don't get mad
[1:43:14] at me. They're still my friends.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz you've got to have friends in the
[1:43:21] world as well.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; But you can't let them influence you.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:29] You got to influence them.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; So, I was I was with Sister Wanda the
[1:43:40] other day as she was getting her
[1:43:41] chemotherapy.
[1:43:45] Now, listen, they will never let me
[1:43:47] preach in there. I've been there.
[1:43:48] They'll never let me go there and
[1:43:50] preach. But, you know what they did?
[1:43:52] They let her come and be a patient.
[1:43:56] And she's preaching to them
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; with her life.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; You remember there was two birds that
[1:44:14] left the ark.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Two birds. One of them was a dove.
[1:44:21] Brother Brandham preaches several
[1:44:23] sermons on the lamb and the dove.
[1:44:24] preaches on the on the wings of a snow
[1:44:26] white dove and he uses a dove over and
[1:44:28] over as a type of the spirit of God. A
[1:44:31] dove doesn't have to wash himself.
[1:44:33] That's
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to get in the pond and
[1:44:36] figure figure it all out and get himself
[1:44:38] washed up, then go over in the ground
[1:44:40] and shake himself off.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; There's something the all that is on the
[1:44:44] inside of him.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Sure, he gets dusty. Sure, life gets on
[1:44:49] him. Right. Come on.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; But there's an oil on the inside of him
[1:44:53] that pushes all of that out.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Help me finish now.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Sure, we're going to live in this world
[1:45:01] and we're going to get stuff on us.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; We're going to make mistakes.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Let's get it down. We're going to make
[1:45:13] mistakes.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; But God don't throw you away with a
[1:45:17] diaper.
[1:45:30] God puts a oil inside of you, the Holy
[1:45:32] Ghost,
[1:45:34] that you repent immediately.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; There's just there's something about the
[1:45:40] checker station of the Holy Ghost that
[1:45:43] when you think something wrong, it's
[1:45:44] it's just a checker real quick. I mean,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; it's better than IBM or better than
[1:45:48] Apple.
[1:45:50] You say something that you shouldn't
[1:45:52] have said
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden you just go, I'm
[1:45:56] sorry. Hey, listen. I'm sorry. I I I am
[1:46:00] sorry. I don't know what made me say
[1:46:03] that.
[1:46:04] I I am sorry. You come in in the wrong
[1:46:08] mood.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:12] Sarah got visited by God and she was in
[1:46:15] a bad mood.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say, God comes visits
[1:46:24] us.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; You'll feel a sweep of the warmth
[1:46:28] presence in your kitchen.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; You'll be down praying and all of a
[1:46:33] sudden you feel that presence of God.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; I don't want to have to go run and hide
[1:46:40] anything.
[1:46:42] That's right. Good. That's right.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything on the slate that
[1:46:46] I've done or said that I'm be ashamed of
[1:46:49] before God
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; cuz he already knows.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Someone came to me many years ago and
[1:46:55] said, "Brother Ron, but I got I got all
[1:46:56] this thing in my life and I'm so
[1:46:58] ashamed." I said, "I want to tell you.
[1:47:00] I'm going to give you a news bulletin.
[1:47:01] God already knows."
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; He already knows. Just ask him to
[1:47:09] forgive you.
[1:47:21] Okay, I'm going to have to quit, but I
[1:47:23] want I want to take you on a walk.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; You remember brother Brandham was
[1:47:28] working at that job and this is the
[1:47:29] reason I told the story that he would go
[1:47:32] down and sit on people's porch and
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; talk to them. We'd all love to have him
[1:47:36] come talk to us. I mean, really, I Yeah,
[1:47:40] baby.
[1:47:45] Brother Brandon marries two people,
[1:47:48] marries two couples.
[1:47:50] You remember that?
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; If you haven't heard it lately, go back
[1:47:53] and listen to Choosing of a Bride. He'll
[1:47:55] he'll tell you about marrying two
[1:47:56] couples.
[1:47:58] It's good for this front row.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; good for this front and bad now. The
[1:48:03] second row, third row back there. And
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; It's good for you girls, too.
[1:48:11] It's two couples. One is rich.
[1:48:14] come from two very wealthy, established
[1:48:17] families.
[1:48:19] You know, somebody had asked him to
[1:48:21] marry him and you know, he said he had
[1:48:22] to go through all different kind of
[1:48:23] things, kneel down and say all these
[1:48:25] things, go through it. They were rich.
[1:48:27] He had a lot of different things. And
[1:48:29] and he said, uh, it turned out they had
[1:48:32] a great big old house, huge house.
[1:48:37] Then there was a another couple that his
[1:48:39] brother said he brought to him and and
[1:48:42] brother Brandham said I didn't want to
[1:48:44] marry him. He said I had to figure out
[1:48:46] if they were old enough to get married
[1:48:48] if they had permission to get married.
[1:48:51] He said I had talked to them for a
[1:48:52] little while and I figured out they they
[1:48:54] really loved each other.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Didn't have any money but they loved
[1:48:58] each other. Let me let me say this to
[1:49:01] you. Money does not make the world go
[1:49:02] round.
[1:49:05] And when you first Christian, can I talk
[1:49:07] to you?
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz these guys ain't getting it.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, Christian, you guys have
[1:49:16] been married how long?
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Don't fail this test.
[1:49:21] You've been married two months, man.
[1:49:22] It's been great. It's just awesome.
[1:49:25] Now,
[1:49:27] I know by history that you're not a
[1:49:30] millionaire. I don't know. How about
[1:49:31] you, girl? I just don't know. Don't
[1:49:33] leave me hanging. Don't you leave me
[1:49:34] hanging.
[1:49:38] And so I I don't know. I presume that
[1:49:41] you're a millionaire.
[1:49:44] There's going to be times since you're
[1:49:46] not a millionaire. There's going to be
[1:49:47] times to where things are difficult.
[1:49:50] Money's tight. You don't want to ask mom
[1:49:52] and daddy. You just asking God, "God,
[1:49:54] help us. God help us." Those things are
[1:49:57] character building in your life. There's
[1:50:00] things that you're going to see that
[1:50:02] other people have that you'd really like
[1:50:05] to have in your home,
[1:50:07] but you can't get on the top of the
[1:50:09] ladder without climbing.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; So, you're going to have to drive some
[1:50:17] beetle bummers
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; and you're going to have to, you know,
[1:50:21] maybe not have the best furniture in the
[1:50:23] world, but you've got love.
[1:50:27] And I want to tell you that's the
[1:50:29] greatest thing that you can have.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest thing that you can
[1:50:42] have.
[1:50:43] But trying to keep up with the Joneses
[1:50:46] will make your spirit impure.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? The Joneses have to be
[1:50:57] responsible for the money that they have
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; and you have to be responsible for what
[1:51:02] you got.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, Brother Brandham
[1:51:09] marries this young couple. His brother
[1:51:11] tells him and brother Brandham preaches
[1:51:14] a simple simple wedding for them and
[1:51:17] they get married. Now, today he's going
[1:51:21] to take a walk.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish the sermon with
[1:51:24] this. He's going to take a walk
[1:51:27] and I'm going to walk to your house.
[1:51:30] Ain't that nice?
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Ain't that nice? You'd like to me to
[1:51:34] shake your hand and hug your neck? Well,
[1:51:35] that's what I'm going to do right here
[1:51:36] for you. I'm coming to your house. So,
[1:51:39] first of all, he goes down over the
[1:51:42] railroad tracks. He hears that this
[1:51:44] couple is living, you'll like this,
[1:51:47] living in a railroad car. That was kind
[1:51:51] of popular in that day. They was living
[1:51:52] in a railroad car and they had cardboard
[1:51:54] for a a door and tacky buttons he would
[1:51:57] say over it.
[1:52:00] And he says, "I was being just a little
[1:52:02] bit of a hypocrite."
[1:52:06] And he said, "I slipped up to listen."
[1:52:09] And when he slipped up to listen,
[1:52:12] the husband had been downtown and he'd
[1:52:15] walked by a store
[1:52:18] and he walked by a window that had the
[1:52:20] most beautiful dress and he was
[1:52:22] thinking, "I would love
[1:52:26] I'd love to get that for her." Well, of
[1:52:29] course he would. He loves her with all
[1:52:31] of his heart. She's in a sack dress, a
[1:52:35] made sack dress. Those are popular then.
[1:52:37] I remember I remember my grandmother
[1:52:39] used to wear sack dresses, my
[1:52:41] great-grandmother especially, and uh
[1:52:47] not gonna go any further,
[1:52:50] but anyway,
[1:52:53] brother slipped up
[1:52:56] and she's sitting on his lap.
[1:53:00] Sitting on his lap and he's explaining
[1:53:01] to her, I walked, he tells the story, I
[1:53:04] walked down the street and I walked by a
[1:53:07] window and I saw this dress and I'd just
[1:53:10] love to get it for you.
[1:53:12] She didn't create an argument with him.
[1:53:16] She said, "Oh, honey, the one I've got
[1:53:21] is so nice.
[1:53:24] I don't need a new dress."
[1:53:27] And he said, "They had love."
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to sort it.
[1:53:34] Then he goes to the mansion.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; He goes to the mansion.
[1:53:41] When he goes there, he slips up and
[1:53:43] there's a little tussle or what we call
[1:53:45] a tiff that's going on.
[1:53:49] They had been at a party
[1:53:51] and dancing
[1:53:53] and she'd been dancing in another man's
[1:53:55] arms and they were having a tiff over
[1:53:58] this.
[1:53:59] Money didn't fix their problems.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:03] Being in the who's who of a of great
[1:54:05] factory owners didn't fix the problems,
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Random asked the question in
[1:54:11] choosing of a broad, which one would I
[1:54:14] rather be?
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Why is sermon like this important?
[1:54:24] You are the bride of heaven. Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; This world is not our home.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Millionaire or not millionaire, it don't
[1:54:35] matter.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Good car, bad car, don't matter. Good
[1:54:41] lawn mower, bad lawnmower, don't matter.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; We got to have character.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; We must have the character of Jesus
[1:54:52] Christ.
[1:54:57] an extra chair at our table for Jesus.
[1:55:01] He's always welcome.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell a personal story that
[1:55:09] I know to finish.
[1:55:14] Brother Brandham had a lot of scoffers
[1:55:15] and critics.
[1:55:17] We all know that Jesus had them. David
[1:55:21] had them. You got them.
[1:55:25] Brother Brham had two opposites. He had
[1:55:27] one group that wanted to worship him as
[1:55:29] God.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; And that's wrong.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; And the others was criticizing
[1:55:34] everything that he was doing. Couldn't
[1:55:35] do no right.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Never do no right. But William Brandham,
[1:55:41] the ministry of William Brandham was
[1:55:44] Christ in action in this day.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; He was a God man on the earth.
[1:55:50] TL Osburn would call him a Jesus man on
[1:55:53] the earth. And I'd say we could all say
[1:55:55] that would be correct.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; We all could say that. That would be
[1:55:58] correct. We saw the actions in the life
[1:56:01] of Jesus Christ living on the inside of
[1:56:03] him.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; People didn't come out to hear him
[1:56:06] preach. They come out to see God in
[1:56:08] action.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; That's what people want to hear here.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; I want to see God here. That's right.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Every service should be a convention
[1:56:19] service.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; This might be a quieter sermon, but let
[1:56:24] me just say, if we get this today,
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; your homes will be different. Your life
[1:56:29] will be different.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; What if brother Random slipped up to our
[1:56:39] home?
[1:56:41] Slipped up our home. I wonder if the
[1:56:44] shutters would have to be closed real
[1:56:45] quickly.
[1:56:47] I wonder if a fight would be ensuing. Or
[1:56:50] I wonder if she'd be sitting on the lap
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; and you just be talking about the love
[1:56:56] of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Random was in Switzerland
[1:57:08] at a hotel.
[1:57:11] Brother Random was not only the most
[1:57:15] powerful, but he also the most humble
[1:57:21] to me. That's what made him even more
[1:57:24] powerful.
[1:57:25] He was not the one that was always
[1:57:27] talking at the table. He was listening
[1:57:30] at the table. Table was full of
[1:57:33] preachers.
[1:57:34] The story tells me that it was about 20
[1:57:37] different preachers that was sitting
[1:57:38] there. who's who preachers that was
[1:57:41] taking care of brother Brandham, the
[1:57:43] host host pastor, the host people.
[1:57:47] And
[1:57:50] brother Brandham was sitting kind of in
[1:57:52] the middle of the table. The host pastor
[1:57:54] looked over at him and he said, "Brother
[1:57:57] Brandham, there's a man that's walking
[1:57:59] around the table and he doesn't seem to
[1:58:01] be finding a a seat."
[1:58:05] I want you to catch this.
[1:58:08] And brother Brandham leaned into him and
[1:58:09] he said,
[1:58:12] "That's the angel of the Lord. He won't
[1:58:14] be needing a seat."
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes if he comes to your
[1:58:24] house, what kind of a presence does he
[1:58:26] find?
[1:58:30] I'm not just talking about the structure
[1:58:32] of your house
[1:58:35] where it's brick or mortar or vinyl
[1:58:37] siding. I'm talking about this house.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; This house.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; I met Sam in the office just a few
[1:58:51] moments ago with his wife.
[1:58:54] I don't have to know him a year to know
[1:58:57] that the Lord lives in his house.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; There's nothing better than to have
[1:59:05] Jesus living right here.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about signing your name
[1:59:10] on a book. I'm not I'm not talking about
[1:59:13] doing all kind of rituals. I'm talking
[1:59:15] about to really know him.
[1:59:18] I don't care how long that you come
[1:59:20] here.
[1:59:23] Your attendance is wonderful.
[1:59:26] No matter how much tithes that you give,
[1:59:27] that's I so appreciate that. That goes
[1:59:29] into the kingdom of God to do a lot of
[1:59:31] different things. But let me just say
[1:59:33] this to you. What means more to me than
[1:59:35] anything in this world is to see that
[1:59:38] atmosphere around you that is Jesus.
[1:59:45] That's the most important thing in your
[1:59:48] life because if that's there,
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; love will be there.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Power will be there.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Influence will be there.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Every part of the body of Christ will be
[2:00:01] there.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Living on the inside of you.
[2:00:06] You won't have to tell where you go to
[2:00:07] church,
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You won't have to tell who your
[2:00:12] pastor is,
[2:00:15] but the power of Christ
[2:00:21] will mean more than anything in your
[2:00:24] life.
[2:00:32] Could you say amen?
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[2:01:05] There was a woman that
[2:01:09] had one child.
[2:01:13] That child was the money maker of the
[2:01:16] family.
[2:01:21] that child died.
[2:01:24] You can imagine how difficult it was to
[2:01:26] realize that life as we know it is over.
[2:01:32] But she didn't realize that
[2:01:36] the rabbi of rabbis, the Messiah of
[2:01:38] Messiah
[2:01:41] was coming to the funeral.
[2:01:45] You know, he wouldn't walk to where that
[2:01:47] they were going to do all their rituals,
[2:01:50] but brother Bram said he would walk to a
[2:01:52] culvert and he would set down on a
[2:01:54] culvert. Now, here's what brother Bram
[2:01:56] said because he would give us insight.
[2:01:59] He said Jesus had a headache
[2:02:02] and he was sat on that cart all day
[2:02:05] long.
[2:02:07] He wouldn't even describe to the
[2:02:09] disciples why he was there.
[2:02:14] He wouldn't tell them nothing about what
[2:02:16] I'm here to do today, but he was waiting
[2:02:19] on the funeral.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz he had a plan.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; That woman, her life was devastated
[2:02:27] because of this death.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; But Jesus had an answer for that.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; I want you to know in this service, you
[2:02:37] may think, "Well, he's a million miles
[2:02:38] away." when he's sitting real near to
[2:02:40] you
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; and he's got an answer for you.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Now, when the barrel passes by and
[2:02:46] they're carrying that that boy on the
[2:02:49] top and they've got they got flowers and
[2:02:51] things as they would have over top of
[2:02:54] him and maybe singing songs,
[2:02:58] singing songs of sorrow.
[2:03:00] Jesus didn't lament the situation.
[2:03:04] He stopped the funeral.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:08] when he stopped the funeral,
[2:03:13] he spoke life to that child.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't know the rest of the
[2:03:19] story, but that child from that day
[2:03:21] forward,
[2:03:26] no doubt he asked a question, what
[2:03:28] happened?
[2:03:31] What happened?
[2:03:34] We really don't know. Maybe it was a
[2:03:36] heart attack or we really don't know,
[2:03:39] but you died
[2:03:41] and we were having a funeral for you.
[2:03:44] I don't remember anything that happened.
[2:03:49] But all we can tell you is Jesus came by
[2:03:53] and the way that we hear it, he sat
[2:03:55] there all day. We didn't even know he
[2:03:57] was there.
[2:03:59] But he said all day
[2:04:01] waiting on nuts to come by.
[2:04:04] Now, maybe you drove 20 miles, maybe you
[2:04:06] drove two hours, maybe you drove four,
[2:04:09] maybe you drove eight,
[2:04:14] but whether you know it or not, Jesus,
[2:04:17] come by,
[2:04:19] he knows how to take a stony heart,
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:25] make it a heart of love,
[2:04:28] a heart of joy.
[2:04:31] He knows how to take a bickering tongue,
[2:04:34] make it a heart that'll sing love songs.
[2:04:43] He knows how to take the desires of your
[2:04:45] flesh and turn it all the way around
[2:04:49] and make you an individual
[2:04:53] that you never thought you'd be.
[2:04:56] A prince among men, a queen among
[2:05:00] ladies.
[2:05:02] I don't know if you've been looking
[2:05:03] around here,
[2:05:05] but you're the kingom of the crop.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Whether you in Walmart or on your job or
[2:05:12] in your school,
[2:05:16] you're the queen of heaven.
[2:05:21] And if I can say anything to you,
[2:05:24] keep your spirit clean.
[2:05:27] Keep your spirit clean. Whatever comes
[2:05:30] your way.
[2:05:33] Keep your spirit clean,
[2:05:37] brother Ron. But you don't know. Keep
[2:05:39] your spirit clean.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Don't let it affect you.
[2:05:43] Cuz what it'll do, it'll affect your
[2:05:45] prayer life.
[2:05:46] It'll affect your marriage. It'll affect
[2:05:49] your love to your children. It'll affect
[2:05:52] your love to God.
[2:05:55] It'll block up the holes
[2:05:58] to where the the Holy Spirit can flow
[2:06:00] into your life. And I want to tell you
[2:06:04] Jesus is here to help you with that
[2:06:06] today.
[2:06:08] Amen. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:06:13] as we felt the love of God all through
[2:06:16] this service,
[2:06:20] Lord God,
[2:06:22] we pull ourselves up to the altar and
[2:06:24] say, "Father,
[2:06:27] I want to be drinking from the wells of
[2:06:29] living water.
[2:06:32] There is a fountain in the house of
[2:06:34] David.
[2:06:36] God, I ask you don't let nothing get in
[2:06:39] my life.
[2:06:43] Nothing get in my life.
[2:06:46] Lord God, nothing.
[2:06:49] No matter what happens, what goes
[2:06:53] Lord God,
[2:06:55] come and live in my life like never
[2:06:56] before.
[2:06:58] Forgive us, Father.
[2:07:01] Lord, I dedicate my life to you. I
[2:07:04] dedicate my family to you.
[2:07:06] I dedicate this church to you.
[2:07:09] Thank you for this walk today
[2:07:12] that we've had.
[2:07:15] May we be better Christians. We pray
[2:07:18] in Jesus Christ's name I ask you.
[2:07:23] I've had a few loss in my life.
[2:07:28] I've walked with Sister Connie.
[2:07:34] One day, little Reagan was having a
[2:07:35] horrible day.
[2:07:37] She was out of control.
[2:07:41] Dad and mom was fussing and fussing and
[2:07:44] she just wasn't getting it.
[2:07:47] I said, "Baby doll, why don't we take a
[2:07:50] walk?"
[2:07:52] I took her by the hand
[2:07:56] and we started walking.
[2:08:00] You remember that?
[2:08:02] How old would you been?
[2:08:05] Four, five years old.
[2:08:09] You know, God has to take a walk with us
[2:08:11] sometimes cuz we just lose it.
[2:08:14] I took her by the hand. I walked with
[2:08:17] her. I said, "Baby Do,
[2:08:20] you don't know this, but you're somebody
[2:08:22] special.
[2:08:25] You're a daughter of Jesus.
[2:08:27] not just a daughter of Andrew and Katie
[2:08:29] and a granddaughter to me.
[2:08:32] But I said, "You don't have to act like
[2:08:34] that. That's a devil that's trying to
[2:08:35] make you act like that."
[2:08:38] You know what? By the time we made that
[2:08:40] loop,
[2:08:42] she was in a complete different
[2:08:43] atmosphere.
[2:08:45] I'll tell you, love will change your
[2:08:47] life.
[2:08:49] Love will change your life. Turn to your
[2:08:51] neighbor and say, "Love will change my
[2:08:53] life.
[2:08:55] Amen.
[2:08:59] Let's sing it to
[2:09:01] you. I love you with all my heart.

[2:19:17] wiped our tears away.
[2:19:22] Stepped in and saved the day.
[2:19:25] But once again,
[2:19:28] I say amen.
[2:19:32] And it's still raining.
[2:19:38] And as the thunder rolls,
[2:19:41] I barely hear you whisper through the
[2:19:45] rain.
[2:19:48] I'm with you.
[2:19:53] And as your mercy falls,
[2:19:57] I raise my hand and praise the God who
[2:20:01] gives
[2:20:03] and takes away.
[2:20:09] Oh, and I'll praise you in this storm.
[2:20:15] And I will lift my hands
[2:20:18] for you are who you are.
[2:20:22] No matter where I am
[2:20:26] and every tear I cry.
[2:20:30] Oh, you hold in your hand.
[2:20:34] You never left my side.
[2:20:38] And though my heart is,
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:46] I will praise you in this room.
[2:20:54] I remember when
[2:20:57] I stumbled in the wind.
[2:21:01] You heard my cry to you and raise me up
[2:21:07] again.
[2:21:09] My strength is almost gone.
[2:21:13] How can I carry on
[2:21:17] if I can't find you?
[2:21:23] But as the thunder rolls,
[2:21:27] I barely hear you whisper through the
[2:21:31] rain.
[2:21:34] I'm with you.
[2:21:39] And as your mercy falls,
[2:21:43] I raise my hand and praise the God who
[2:21:47] gives
[2:21:50] and takes away.
[2:21:52] [Laughter]
[2:21:56] Lord, I'll praise you in this world
[2:22:01] and I will lift my hands
[2:22:05] for you are who you are.
[2:22:09] No matter where I am,
[2:22:13] every tear I cry.
[2:22:17] Oh, you holding your hand.
[2:22:22] You never left my side.
[2:22:25] And I'll praise you in this song.
[2:22:30] And I will lift my hands.
[2:22:34] For you are who you are.
[2:22:38] No matter where I am.
[2:22:42] And every tear I cry.
[2:22:46] Oh, you hold in your hand.
[2:22:50] You never lose my side.
[2:22:54] And though my heart is cold,
[2:23:02] I will praise you in this storm.
[2:23:09] I lift my eyes into the heels. Where
[2:23:14] does my help come from? My help comes
[2:23:19] from the Lord, the maker
[2:23:23] of heaven and earth.
[2:23:26] I lift my eyes into the news. Where does
[2:23:31] my help come from? My help comes from
[2:23:36] the Lord, the maker
[2:23:39] of heaven and earth.
[2:23:42] I lift my eyes into the heels. Where

[2:23:59] So I'll praise you in this storm
[2:24:04] and I will lift my hands

[2:24:13] No matter where I am,
[2:24:17] every tear I've cried.
[2:24:21] Oh, you hold in your hand.
[2:24:25] You never left my side.
[2:24:29] [Music]
[2:24:38] I will praise you.

[2:24:48] is in

[2:25:28] you. You know
[2:25:31] of the angels.

[2:25:49] Oh the living sacrifice.
[2:25:54] Oh, the only source
[2:25:58] of life.
[2:26:01] Oh my hope.
[2:26:04] Can you lift your hands to to the one
[2:26:07] that your hope is in this morning? Oh,
[2:26:10] from this time on. Hallelujah.
[2:26:16] And never more.
[2:26:22] My my home
[2:26:26] is in the Lord
[2:26:31] forever
[2:26:33] more.
[2:26:36] His tender mercies come with every romeo
[2:26:43] son. Hallelujah.
[2:26:47] to meet the sinner and his broken
[2:26:54] nail
[2:26:57] to all for healing and forgive
[2:27:03] forgiveness
[2:27:06] all those
[2:27:08] to those who trust
[2:27:12] in him they'll find their hearts
[2:27:17] at rest.
[2:27:19] My home
[2:27:23] is
[2:27:25] the Lord.
[2:27:28] Oh, from this time on
[2:27:34] [Music]
[2:27:40] my
[2:27:44] is
[2:27:46] Lord
[2:27:48] [Music]
[2:27:50] forever
[2:27:51] more.
[2:27:55] We sorrow not as those who have
[2:28:01] no hope.
[2:28:05] to those who are asleep today
[2:28:12] in Christ.
[2:28:15] And we who are alive
[2:28:20] and
[2:28:22] remain
[2:28:26] our promise to body
[2:28:30] change.
[2:28:32] resolve
[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:37] my home.
[2:28:41] You see the Lord
[2:28:47] from this time on.
[2:28:50] Hallelujah.
[2:28:52] And ever
[2:28:55] [Music]
[2:28:58] my home
[2:29:02] He is seen you Lord
[2:29:07] forever
[2:29:09] more.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; that you can have all
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Sister Barbara? I don't think I've ever
[2:29:24] told you this.
[2:29:26] That last verse, come to me that morning
[2:29:29] that we're getting ready to preach your
[2:29:31] daddy's funeral.
[2:29:33] We sorrow not as those that have no
[2:29:36] hope.
[2:29:38] To those that are asleep in Christ,
[2:29:41] but to those who are alive and remain.
[2:29:46] We are promised a body change. We have a
[2:29:49] hope this morning.
[2:29:52] Amen.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; We sorrow not as those who have
[2:30:00] no hope.
[2:30:03] to those who are asleep today
[2:30:10] in Christ.
[2:30:14] Those
[2:30:15] [Music]
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; that's who we are.
[2:30:24] Oh, we're promise of body
[2:30:29] change on resurrection.
[2:30:32] makes a name.
[2:30:36] Oh my hope
[2:30:40] is in the Lord.
[2:30:45] Oh, from this I'm all
[2:30:51] and ever
[2:30:53] more.
[2:30:57] My home
[2:31:01] is in the Lord
[2:31:06] forever
[2:31:08] more.
[2:31:11] Maybe you just want to sit right there
[2:31:12] where you are. Raise your hands and talk
[2:31:14] to the master
[2:31:17] and say, "Oh God,
[2:31:21] create in me
[2:31:24] a clean heart.
[2:31:28] I just want to be near to you, Lord.
[2:31:32] And I never ever want to drive away the
[2:31:34] dove of the Holy Spirit.
[2:31:37] But even so, God,
[2:31:41] if I have,
[2:31:44] may I repent and turn back to you
[2:31:49] so the dove of the Holy Spirit will fly
[2:31:51] to my heart.
[2:31:54] [Music]
[2:31:56] Let the oil of the Holy Ghost bathe over
[2:31:58] our souls, Lord Jesus.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Let it cleanse us from within and
[2:32:04] without, oh Lord Jesus.
[2:32:07] For we know, God, that before us is the
[2:32:11] greatest event that has ever been known.
[2:32:15] We have heard the shout. We have heard
[2:32:17] the cry of the midnight hour. We've been
[2:32:20] woke up.
[2:32:23] This bride has heard the thunder of her
[2:32:26] master's call.
[2:32:29] We can't go back to sleep to these
[2:32:31] revelations, Lord Jesus.
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:36] Lord, you're a God that is rich in
[2:32:38] mercy.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; You're a God that wants communion with
[2:32:42] your children.
[2:32:44] And Father,
[2:32:46] [Music]
[2:32:47] we want you to have a place that you
[2:32:49] could dwell in
[2:32:51] that you could say, "That's my house.
[2:32:55] That's my dwelling place."
[2:33:00] Oh,
[2:33:02] Solomon's temple was beautiful.
[2:33:05] as it moved on and on.
[2:33:08] But the glory of the latter house
[2:33:12] shall be greater than the former.
[2:33:15] Father,
[2:33:18] we love you,
[2:33:20] [Music]
[2:33:22] Lord. I want to love you more
[2:33:27] [Music]
[2:33:29] than I ever have before. Lord,
[2:33:37] you're so easy to adore.
[2:33:45] Lord, I want to love you more. Come on,
[2:33:49] young people, help me out.
[2:33:52] Oh Lord, I want to love you more
[2:34:01] than I ever have before.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; I
[2:34:09] You're so easy to adore.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; So easy to.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I want to love you more now.
[2:34:21] You say things, Lord, I want to love
[2:34:23] you. Oh Lord, I want to love you more
[2:34:33] than I ever have before.
[2:34:41] You're so easy to know.
[2:34:50] Lord, I want to love you more.
[2:34:58] Oh Lord, I want to know you more
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; than I ever have before
[2:35:11] I ever.
[2:35:15] You're so easy to adore.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; You're so easy to adore.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I want to love you more. Want
[2:35:27] to sing it one more time with all of our
[2:35:30] heart. Let him hear you. Oh Lord, I want
[2:35:33] to love you more
[2:35:40] than I ever have before. Oh,
[2:35:48] you're so easy to adore.
[2:35:57] Oh Lord, I want to love you more.
[2:36:02] Your brother Chris Morris wouldn't mind
[2:36:03] coming to closing today's service out in
[2:36:05] prayer. Lord, I want to love you more.
[2:36:15] than I ever had before.
[2:36:27] Let's just all pray.
[2:36:31] Amen. Let's just all pray and believe
[2:36:32] together.
[2:36:34] Our gracious father, as we just come to
[2:36:36] you, Lord,
[2:36:38] we've heard from you. And father, as we
[2:36:41] just depart from these buildings, may
[2:36:43] the word of God that we heard don't
[2:36:45] depart from our heart.
[2:36:47] And Lord, no matter the situation that
[2:36:49] comes, no matter
[2:36:52] the time the what the enemy's got to
[2:36:55] throw at us,
[2:36:58] Lord, we know you're a very present help
[2:37:00] in the time of need. And Father, you've
[2:37:03] proved that to me.
[2:37:06] You've proved it, Lord, time and time
[2:37:08] again. But father,
[2:37:10] this weekend, Lord, it was manifested in
[2:37:12] such a way that even an unbeliever
[2:37:15] couldn't doubt that almighty God was
[2:37:17] with us. And Lord, I just want to say
[2:37:20] thank you for the prayer of the saints.
[2:37:24] And Lord, how much it means to a
[2:37:26] believer to know other believers are
[2:37:28] praying. And Father, the kindness, the
[2:37:30] love that was showed. Father,
[2:37:34] I just pray Lord Jesus, you can repay a
[2:37:36] hundfold.
[2:37:39] But Father, more important than that is
[2:37:40] the hundfold that we've received today.
[2:37:43] And Lord, as we depart,
[2:37:46] may your presence, may what we've heard,
[2:37:49] may the people that come in contact with
[2:37:52] us, may they see Christ inside of us.
[2:37:56] May we represent you Lord here on this
[2:37:58] earth in such a way till they get salty.
[2:38:03] And father we love you. We appreciate
[2:38:05] you. Thank you L Lord for your grace and
[2:38:07] mercy. And we do commit all things in
[2:38:10] your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:38:16] [Music]
[2:38:20] You're dismissed at this time. God
[2:38:21] richly bless you. Lord, I want to love
[2:38:25] you more
[2:38:31] than I ever have before.
[2:38:40] Oh, you're so easy to adore.
[2:38:48] Oh Lord, I want to love you more.
[2:38:53] [Music]
[2:38:58] Lord, I want to love you more
[2:39:06] than I ever have before.
[2:39:15] Oh, you're so easy to adore.
[2:39:24] Oh Lord, I want to love you.
[2:39:39] Heat. Heat.
[2:40:04] Feeling
[2:40:06] [Music]
[2:40:23] heat.
