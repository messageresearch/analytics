sunrise this is amen isn't it wonderful to know that the Son of God has risen in your hearts today amen we just love him with all that is within us and we're certainly privileged to be accounted worthy to be standing in this hour and thankful that he counted the cost to so that we could stand here amen even in this wicked dark generation God's got an elect that he's calling out in this day and and what a privilege it is and we want to be remember our pastor there and brother Wayne and brother Ray Ericksons want to be remembering him there he'd be speaking even right now and so we just

Reuben and Sister Abigail and we're just committed unto the Lord and we expect him to do what he said that he would do and you know I found out with God he's never let me down I've let him down a time

I'll come running after you let's just go to the Lord in prayer now father we are so thankful for your drawing power Lord we even recognize that it is your power that has drawn us into your presence this morning it is nothing upon our own accord Lord that we've gathered ourselves here today Lord but it was you Lord that was a wooing and cooing over our hearts Lord and looking out across the the land father you've seen you've seen the generation that had to rise up father and you begin to draw us Lord by the magnetization of Thy word father you called us when everything else would have been bolted down and wouldn't have come to you but because there's something on the inside of us that is that is drawn to you father we cannot withhold ourselves any longer father and Lord today as we recognize that we are in thy presence Lord we invite you to come and to touch the hearts of your children today Father Lord we know that there are many afflictions that are upon the righteous but we recognize that you are the Lord that deliver us out of all of them little Ellie Grace father we put the blood of Jesus Christ over her and ask God do you touch her body Lord I pray for our pastor Lord I pray that you would completely restore his body father brother Randy there in the hospital and Lord we're asking God that you you know what you're doing father we don't question your ways father because your ways are higher than ours and Lord we go through things for a purpose father and we recognize that you're you have a greater purpose than what we can even imagine in our mind and we invite you father to to work out your word through our life father you would just call us into your presence Lord just to go a little bit deeper into Thy word and we'll spread out our Roots father like an old oak tree father who gives shelter to those around us father and we ask God that you had come today Lord we know that there are many needs here and I ask father that by the preaching of the word Lord that you would set the captives free father maybe it's healing in the body or maybe it's healing in the mind I ask father that you would allow healing the healing bombs of Gilead to roll over your children today now father we are we're commissioned to stand here and to preach the gospel now father I would ask Lord that you'd set me down over in a corner and begin to speak through my body Lord speak through my lips Lord and I recognize that you're the head and I'm the body father but Lord let it not just be myself that enter ends today Lord and may the whole body of Christ yield themselves over to the Supernatural and you'll have complete access here tonight today Lord and you'll manifest yourself in a way that that would be pleasing unto your spirit father Lord keep us forgive us of our sins in your name we pray these things amen and amen and if you have your Bibles today we'd like to look over in a few places in the scripture I'd like to look over first there into the Old Testament in the book of Isaiah Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 8 and down through verse 13. and I'll let you have your seats after after we read that portion of scripture and then and then I'll read the others I don't want to keep you standing and and uh Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 8 and brother J if you'll just come see me after service there I mean me and him's working out a little thing today for our youth so uh I kind of put him over over I commissioned him here so so just just remember to come see me Brother Jay Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 8 and today I would like to speak to you along along these lines of the true sheet the true seed shall rise the true seed shall rise so I'd like to title this today uh Rising above it all Rising above it all and the Lord kind of turned the diamond on me here in the last 10 minutes and so uh so let's let's just enjoy what the Lord has for us today amen Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the Earth and make it that bring forth Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater I'm going to read that that portion of scripture one more time so you catch it for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but it watereth the Earth and maketh it bring forth and blood that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater's Souls shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth and it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and the Trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the Thorns shall come up the fir tree instead of the Briar shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be that to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord as I said we'd like to just carry this thought today as the Lord would see fitting on Rising above it all at First Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 the Bible tells us but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light let's say that together who hath called you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy also Galatians chapter 6 and verse 7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth through the flesh shall also shall of the flesh or recurruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall love the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and I want you to read that aloud with me today verse 9 and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and if you'll just go back in your mind just a few weeks ago you remember that there was a tongue and there was an interpretation that came forth with those exact words be not we weary and well doing for in due season we shall rape if we faint not and I think it's a it's a it's a challenging thing to be to have a pastor like we've had stand before us that charges us and challenges us every single weekend that shows to thee to the rest of the world that there is a man that that is that has been diagnosed with with stage four cancer that stands up behind the pulpit and preaches the message of the hour in in its fullness and it's an entirety and I think it's it's a charge or it's a challenge over us as a Church of the Living God that that if men could do that in those kind of a bodies what should we be like if if we don't have that kind of thing that is upon us or that kind of Shadow that's hanging over top of us but I believe that brother Ron understands the the principles of the Bible that we shall reap if we faint not and I believe that is such a it's a a an inspiration to us in this hour to look at these things that God are these examples that God has set before us like brother Homer said here in a wheelchair and he preached to us day after day weekend after week and sometimes feeling good sometimes feeling bad sitting there in a wheelchair with with one leg and going through pain and all of those things but preaching with the tenacity of a lion preaching the message of the hour you got men like brother Tim Pruitt you got these other brothers that have gone through so many things but we recognize the power of this message that we are going to rise above everything rise above every circumstance rise above every disease rise above it all but God in this hour has called out a chosen that is called out of Darkness a people for his name's sake and we recognize that when when Peter is writing that the first the first letter of the first book The First Peter there he said that we being born again not of a corruptable seed but we are born again of an Incorruptible seed which does not fadeth away but it liveth and it abideth forever now we know that God is the god that is over all of his seeds and he's over top of all of this generation and we recognize that Satan is in understanding he realizes that he's only got a short time to work against the Church of the Living God so we recognize that we are in a spiritual warfare in between between Heaven and Earth but we recognize that we as the children of God we are in a battle for Heavenly places we look all the way back in the Garden of Eden and you can see that God planted seeds there but he allowed the spirit of God to move across the face of the deep and he called those seeds right out of the earth what was it it was the spirit of the Living God that would go across the seed and make it come to life and it is the same thing in this service today and throughout your life it was something that God had deposited on the inside of you that you couldn't do it on your own but God deposited something on the inside of you brother Chris that you could have never got up you could have never got out of your situation but God put something on the inside of you and he germatized that seed that he placed in the inside of you that's why there's such power in Revelation in this hour to recognize that there even though you go through trials even though you go through circumstances God has given you a revelation that you are going to rise above it all I think it's something to be be to look at today with with an open eye to look back even though you're going to go through the worst of times through the darkest of Ages for the most deceptive hour you're not gonna fall you're going to rise above it all Hallelujah and I think if there's one thing that we need today it's spiritual Revelation that's what the brother ran away would say to us he would tell us that the one thing that we need in this hour more than anything else is spiritual Revelation and he would speak to us in Satan's Eden he said I wanted to speak something to you to help you keep the punches off Satan's punches off of you brother random would tell us in a church age book he would tell us he said it's like he said that word or Revelation he said it means apocalypse which means unveiling and he said it's like a great sculptor as he is getting ready to remove it's it's what it was once hidden and it's sitting there to the onlooker and all it can see is the sheet that is hiding over that statue that he's already built but when that unveiling of the Revelation strikes it's when that great that great author that has built this that has built this statue he unveils it and now you can look unto the uh the onlooker can look on that I can see what was once hidden and to think that this hour is the day that he is showing himself to the onlookers of this generation he's not showing it to everybody but there was somebody in line that was waiting for him to pull the seals off the back of the book there was somebody that was waiting Hallelujah there was somebody that God was looking for that would stand there in line just waiting for it and you didn't recognize where you were but the spirit of the Living God he had you he had you to go through this one to that one and this one to that one but God knew exactly where you would be at you may have seemed like you weaved your ways out of this mess and back into another mess but there is nothing that has happened to your life that almighty God has not had in his hand he's had you in his hands the whole time some of you come out of mixed doctrines some of you come out on some of the most chaotic scenes of life but the onlooker was you but the one that revealed the seals is him and let me tell you if he's the one pulling and unveiling himself he's going to be the one that takes you takes you to the place that you belong in recognized that Satan has come to destroy that which God has deposited in this hour which is the gene of God and we recognize that we are up against a skillful opponent is that right he's been working against you for 6 000 years he's been stacking up he's been stacking up all kinds of things that gets your family history we have a skillful opponent but you remember what the first John chapter 4 it tells us Brethren try the spirits whether they be of God or of not and we recognize at this age that we are living in it's the age of a lukewarmness and it's this age that takes a spiritual discernment to be able to be able to read between right and wrong to recognize to recognize the spirit of God and the spirit of Satan and we recognize that Jesus was telling us in Matthew chapter 24 and 24 that in the last days that false Christ would arise false anointed ones would arise in this generation and false prophets you watch that Antichrist is always attached to that false prophet notice notice it's this age that God is calling out a people after his own namesake in this age in the dark of Ages in the most deceptive of Ages when it's such a deceiving time and lukewarm time when it looks like everybody just look on YouTube one time and it looks like my goodness hillsong's really got the goods or Bethel Music and I'm not taken away from anything that they've got but give them the word test one time they can have their revivals but I want this word Revival [Music] it takes spiritual discernment between to be able to see what is right and what is wrong is that right just take a look at it and it looks so real you look at their worship where did they pattern their worship after you where did they get that inspiration from almighty God what are you channeled under the inspiration of this message it's this inspiration that they're feeding off of I I got some things that that the Lord's laid on my heart and I just want to deliver them so if you can if you can help me Preach Today if you help me preach to me I want to deliver some things that it is in this evil age when God is calling out the elect of this generation out throughout all the ages of the deceit all the way from the Garden of Eden and all the way down this is the most deceptive age that there has been and we notice that it's in this age that hail is spilling itself out into this generation but you remember when brother Bynum is preaching on the junction of time 1956 he said you notice that when all hell is being turned loose all Heaven turns Loose as well so you recognize that heaven is blending in time and with eternity that heaven and Earth are coming together and they are kissing but we recognize that hell itself Isaiah chapter 5 and verse 14 tells us that Hell hath enlarged itself [Music] to think that hell is spilling over into this generation it takes real spiritual discernment to recognize what's right and what's wrong you remember when brother Brandon preaches to us in 1963 in Souls that are now in prison and he goes in there brother enemies is coming on he's coming under the message of the third pull he's coming under the ministry of it he recognizes it brother random tells us that he's there in Arizona he's there in Arizona and he he's sitting there doing a little shopping with his wife in JCPenney and he noticed notice now notice where he's sitting at he said I was sitting there at that escalator and he said I let my wife go do a little shopping brothers that's what we do we just let them go do a little shopping even the prophet sat down and he let her go do her shopping and he was sitting there now notice where he was at he was there at that escalator now notice this is one of a kind of an escalator at that time there wasn't too many at that day but notice where it's at he said I was watching them come up and I was watching them go down he said as I was watching them he said I'll begin to recognize that something was going on he said I was sitting there and he said I was watching all of those ladies or those women coming up there he said they were immorally dressed he said had those water head haircuts you remember those great big balls of things they put on top of their head thank God we got rid of that I'm not one of the kind of those guys that'll preach on fans because fans will come and fans will go but young people recognize where that fad is coming from you don't want to look like somebody back in the 70s and you'll look at the picture and think my God I wish I'd never look like that young people if you want to look like Conway Twitty it shows that there's something wrong with you [Applause] if you know what I've got the same haircut that I've had sister Heather's been cutting that hair for for 10 years now and I've got the same haircut that I've had for the past 10 years and I'll probably have the same haircut that I'll have all the way till I go into the Rapture and it'll be a Timeless thing unless I lose this baby but you notice young people watch where those fads are coming from what is it is it is something trying to make you fashionable like the world but you are destined to rise above it all but notice he's sitting there and he said I recognize that something was going on he said I recognize where I was he said there I was sitting there watching them and he said I begin to see them with their cat-eyed glasses coming up there and that green stuff underneath of their eyes he said there I was sitting there in that place he said but I was back in hell again when he had been shot by his friend at 14 years old you remember when he fell down into hell and he just kept falling and he said there was no end he said A Burning Flame would have been a pleasure to that kind of place like that and he said there he said I watched those women in that dimension of hell with those cankered eyes you remember brother random thought man I needed to go pray for those sisters or look at them he thought that they had a terrible disease upon them he said but I was sitting there watching them come up and watching them go down and he said there I was what was it it was a blending of time the blending of Eternity hail was spilling itself over setting in this place but recognize that hail had done's been spilled over now think about this now think about this here hell has been spilled over into this generation and you can see how powerful hell is one cigarette one rock and roll song one little influence of hail you watch it you watch the effect of hell that the effect that hail had on William Branham when he come out of that Vision he was so affected by it hear him preach the prisoner of Christ in 1963 and souls that are now in prison he was affected by it but I want you to know there was a greater Vision than that of hell he had a vision of beyond the curtain of time he was under the influence of a world he said there's not enough words some blind wouldn't be doing it wouldn't be good enough for it Hallelujah whatever you do don't miss that place it's a place of perfect love what was it a prophet in this generation telling you that hell has come up but Heaven has come down and you look at hail it spilled itself out into our schools it spilled itself over into our homes it spilled itself over into our churches and hell was trying to get behind the pulpit but if hell is that forceful how much more forceful is all of heaven and I am an ambassador of Christ as Paul would say that all of Heaven is backing me up all of Heaven is here today it has been gathering in this generation [Music] Satan has done his very best to keep the seed of God to getting from getting to the water because he knows that if you get to the water there's nothing he can stop the true seed of God from coming to life he knows that if he can keep you from the inspiration if he can keep you from worship if he can keep you from praise if he can keep you from the Holy Ghost he'll keep you from rising up and accepting your healing he's tried his best to keep you away from your prayer life he's try his best to keep you away from the water he's trying his best to keep you away from the word but the true seed of God has got to rise he didn't deposit something on the inside of you just to leave it down here and lay on us here and let it lay let me tell you there is a Resurrection on your way and there's no devil in hell there's no Spirit of hail there's no demonic power that can stop the Church of the Living God from rising you see Satan is trying to keep you from the water because he recognizes that the angels on the water he recognizes that the angels on the water and you may be laying in that spot for 38 years but the son of man is coming by your way you may have been sitting there wondering if this was right wondering if it would ever be your time but there's going to come one Hallelujah that's going to come by your way its head rise up take your bed and walk he's not going to leave you in the same spot that he found you in this son of man is working in this room today rise up rise up we are fighting a real devil and he recognizes what's going on in this room right now because the son of man has done changed he's been changed the atmosphere in here and you're very aware of it you know good and well that I'm not the one talking to you just now but there's somebody that is directing me taking me to this seat taking me to that seed taking me over here what is it it's the one that's in control of the water and he knows how to come by your way he knows how to Circle over your life and Satan knows that the Supernatural is moving he recognizes that the water is stirring backwards it's a sign it's a sign that the Supernatural is here [Music] when we was baptized in sister Erica sister Genie down there on that river that day and Labor Day it wasn't a whole lot of people that was there but happy was there at that baptism there's a few of you but we was baptizing these sisters and these brothers that was there come in for that meeting me and brother Alan in that water but we weren't alone in that water that water was churning it was turning and it was in a spot where there should have been no movement in the water it was just a sign that this was a supernatural move of the Holy Ghost you didn't move by your own accord it was a holy spirit drawing what does water represent it represents people and Satan knows when he sees the water moving when he sees these people move that should have never been moving you should have been died you should have been dead you should have been gone on to the Grave you should have went out there to a devil's hail you should have been out there with a Creed or a Dogma but he recognizes the supernatural was on the water and it was calling seeds to come up he was calling seeds to come up the God was predestinated Jesus Christ was predestinated just as much as you were predestinated to be here and he had predestinated 120 seeds he predestinated them and they had they had the seed but there was no life in that seed yet is that right there was no life in that seed because the Bible said in John chapter 20 verse 20 and 21 that Jesus said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost and he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now what was he doing he he was breathing on them the promise the inspiration of Acts 2 was coming let me tell you and there was nothing hell could do to stop that 120 to get in that Upper Room brother Brandon said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said he went up there he said in those seeds he said those seeds gathered themselves up they gathered themselves up and got themselves into that Upper Room now what kind of power can cause a seed a seed that was fearful I see that had just been questioned I see that it just watched their Messiah go to a dead to go to a grave hang on a cross what were they doing the seed was watching and it was being unveiled before them all that time this is him and you've been sitting here and you've been thinking what is this guy caption about it what is this what is this ministry all about is it even right is it even true if there's really some power behind it if really what this Messiah has said is true the things that's got to start coming to pass let me tell you you can bury my Jesus you can lock them in a room and see them but let me tell you on third on the third day he's gonna get up and you can try to hide all of these Gene seeds of God inside of all kinds of Creeds all kinds of Dogma all kind of sin all kind of depression but you gotta get up you gotta get up because God put something on the inside of you and when those 120 got themselves up there in that Upper Room the water came gushing the water came gushing from above and it caused them to rise what were they rising from they were rising from their old nature to a new nature let me tell you this is his nature it's his nature to give out his spirit it's his nature to be good to his children it's his nature to heal them it's his nature to fulfill his promises it's his nature to make sure that you make it it's his nature and you are just as anointed as he is Anointed you're just as predestined as he was pedestrian it's his nature to heal you it's just nature to come by your way and show you my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts you see sometimes we get so Earthbound that all we can see is the ground laying around us but you don't recognize what that ground is doing it's a breeding ground for God to raise you up brother Ron's troubles brother Andy's troubles brother Joe's troubles brother Donnie Nicholson's troubles all of your troubles that are here what is it to Full Gospel Lighthouse it is ground for us to rise out of some of you come out of some of the most stickiest messages families broke up families torn apart you're here and the pillar fire is working way finding where you're at looking for you he's looking for you he knows what he's doing with his word every seed has got to bring forth of its kind if you pray if you plan if you plant a Church of Christ seed you're going to get a Church of Christ crop if you plant a presbyterian seed you're going to get a presbyterian crop if you plant a Baptist seed you're going to get a Baptist crop what has God planted in this generation he has planted Gene seeds of almighty God you are from the beginning I came from God and I'm going back to God and when Jesus rose on the third day you were in him in germ thorn and you were identified with him and his death you're identified with him at the grave you're identified with him in his resurrection and you are identified right now as the elect of almighty God there is no power of hell that can stop the Church of the Living God there is no Creed there is no ideology there is no intellectualism that can stop the gene seed of God from coming forth you are a word kind bride the word Khan is his kind he made man after his own kind and he said about David he said he's a man after my own heart David would say like word have I hid in my heart that I would not sin against you brother Branham said he said he said if David could have had the rain he would have been all right but the Holy Ghost had not yet been given unto him and if David could stand there in Psalms chapter 23 it said surely in goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life you've anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over if David without the Holy Ghost with David without the rain how much more should I cut be running over this morning oh well we're today would you be afraid of the rain I pray to God it Reigns in this place I play here I pray it rains in this place so much that it chokes out your ideas that it makes you start gasping to get into the ark I pray it rains so much in this place you'll get over yourself you'll get off of your pity you'll get over your idea I pray it rains so much that it chokes out your thoughts of what God's got to do and this is a box that God's got to operate Let It Rain In This Place [Applause] thank you we say well brother Andrew brother Brandon told us that the rain is over he told us that the rain was over for the denominations but this is not a denominational Reign that is in this place this is a holy ghost Reign you ain't got to be scared I know there was a whole lot of people in the early in the early stages of the ministry of Malachi 4 when we were first grabbing the message we were scared of the latter rain Movement we didn't know what it was about but they were preaching lateran latter rain later rain but what was it they were preaching a lot of rain movement but they never had the moral Reign they didn't have a teaching Reign first he said but this is the latter rain the teaching of Malachi 4 was a rain but this is a harvest rain don't you recognize we're abroad what's been rained out upon you in this generation it's a harvest rain it's the latter rain don't you be scared of that word it's exactly what job prophesied that in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh looking for remember when brother Brandon's in that cave I heard it this morning didn't know I didn't know I was going here but this is where he's leading me I remember the brand I'm talking about when he was back here in Mishawaka and he saw those two that were under the inspiration of Holy Ghost one speaking in tongues 100 under interpretation you remember that story he said one of them was a real Christian and the other one he said he had to he had two wives and he had two children by this one and that one but he looked at him and he was he was very concerned about this how can this be how can these things be but you remember he was up there in his cave and he was praying about these things and he said I done forgot about it he said I've done forgot about it he said mother come a win that blew my Bible over to Hebrews chapter 6. he said and I wrote it back and thought well what's that about and he said he got down to pray and he said a wind come through there and blew his Bible open to Hebrews chapter 6 again he said now what is that about and then the wind came a third time and blowed his Bible open to Hebrews chapter 6. that the rain falls on the just and the unjust that rain was meant for you but you've watched that rain if you've been paying attention to the news you watched that rainfall on Asbury College this week what is it it's the reign of the Holy Ghost it's the reign of the Holy Ghost said it's falling but that rain is meant for the wheat God is not calling a shock God is calling a real Gene seed of God he's not called him he didn't plant a Pentecostal seed he planted a message seed and that's exactly what he's going to get Bible Believers by a Bible doctrine that believe in Bible healing [Applause] authentic absolutely it's authentic but you remember indeed calling through the Deep you can go and look at it we'll play it before you next weekend show you so that you all got it some of you ain't got another internet but we're gonna play it for him next week on deep calling too deep when when brother Garber and out here in Harrisonburg is the last one standing in that line and deep call it to the deep in Washington D.C and he said now I see you brother random speaking to him he's like I see you you're Desiring a Revival for your church our pastor brother Ron ran into him several years several years ago he's done died and went on now he said if but he wanted to ask him about it he wanted to ask him about that being in line with brother Branham there he said oh he said we had a Revival like we never had before he said it lasted for two weeks he said it went from night to night to the night to the night when it kept going on he said but when it was over he was over and he didn't come back but you look at the Revival that is upon this broad it's not a dead Revival it's not from this church to that church this is not a broken cistern that we are depending upon local rains of revivals we are under a word Revival it's the reign of the Holy Ghost we have an Artesian well we're not drinking from stagnated water this seed that he's bringing up is destined for the rapture Hallelujah that's why I'm preaching with everything within my might to get our young people in this rain to get you in this rain there's healing in this rain there's power in this rain there's Resurrection faith in this rain let me tell you a body changes in this rain supernatural's in this rain [Applause] won't you be weary would you be wearing you're gonna reap you planted you planted and you're gonna reap you planted and you're going to reap but you don't know the struggles I'm in brother Andrew I don't need to know them he don't see the tears that I've cried on my pillow wondering is it ever going to come by my way I got good news for you weeping may endure for a moment but joy comes in the morning sister Gabrielle Joy is coming in the morning this rain is bringing Joy it ain't going to bring for the Briar but it'll bring for the fern tree it'll bring that which God has the positive [Applause] what was it the message was broadcasted and the seed fell on ground [Music] and you gave it to your friends and your friends didn't accept it but he's the one that broadcasted it knows where it's falling at and you look at it think man that's real seed right there that looks like real genuine seed that looks like it looks looks like the real thing and he go for a spell and go for a spell and there's no rain that seed that's sitting over here on the rock of that seed is sitting over here on the ground but when the rain comes they both are raising up and they're screaming for it man they can have such a beautiful life even have a beautiful dance having such an awesome testimony but when the trials of Life get heated up on them they can't last what are you hungering for you're hungering for the real water of the Holy Ghost yeah if there ever was a time that we needed to bring Jesus a fresh strike of Pentecostal water it's right now what was Rebecca doing she didn't know what she was doing she didn't understand what that why the commission that she was under but she was under the prayer of a messenger why am I watering these camels why am I doing it like this it's because there's been a prayer prayed over you you don't know what you're doing but you're watering the very power that is going to take you home and Satan knows that you're thirsty he knows that you're thirsty he knows that you're hungry you've been hungry for a real move you've been hungering for it and there ain't nothing like a crime of a hungry child when a mama hears her baby crying I don't know what's in the mama to figure that out as daddies can think it's it's just it's the diaper it needs changing or we need to shake a new toy in front of it the mama knows that it's hungry that Mama's got that that Sixth Sense she knows and understands that that baby's hungry and there's nothing like the Cry of a hungry child and you watch men that get it on the backside of a desert and they get back there and they've went without water for days without water for hours out there in the Heat and they're parched and they're they're thirsty their lips are so dry they're chapped they're thirsting and they begin to see things what are they seeing they're seeing what they think is real water out there and it's a mirage any of you that's ever drove into heat you get to driving down there and that heats over top of that pavement it's over top of that pavement and it creates an illusion in front of you and it makes it look like there's real water out there and you think man I'm going to drive straight into straight into a pot of water I'm gonna hide the plane but there's nothing there but one time there was these there was these there was these ducks that was flying over and they saw this Mirage they saw this Mirage and they thought my I'm gonna I just we're laying right there on that body of water but what they were landing on was pavement and they didn't recognize but they were looking at a mirage and they all when they hit that they hit that pavement at the side at the same time they disintegrated right there because they thought that they was hitting water they were used to getting in the water but Satan set a pitfall for them he shot a pitfall for them and make them give their life to something that was not real and Satan knows what he's doing he's trying to trap you trying to bring you a false Mirage and make you think that you're looking at a reality but the souls of men that are predestinated shall not go after a false Mirage you may have got confused for a moment but the water's coming by your way tonight the Masters heard you call you cried for Hunger you cried for a move you cried for the Holy Ghost you didn't do it it was something on the inside of you no man can come to the father except by me it's my father that has drawn me as my father has sent me so sin now you you are going to win I'm not looking at the defeated I'm looking at the undefeated I'm not looking at the unredeemed I'm looking at the redeemed I'm not looking at the conquered I'm looking at those that are the mighty conquerors if he got up on the third day you got up on the third day if he battled through complexes if he battled through scars if he battled through it it's a sign that you can battle through it come on now come on now you got all of this going on around you don't you be wary about it look at this look at that don't you be wary about it [Applause] these weights are higher than your ways your ways wouldn't even get you out of the ground and you think that you control literal you but your ways have led you straight to destruction hear your ways LED you to Rebellion but his ways LED you to forgiveness your ways LED you to a devil's hair but his way took you to a heaven to a bar your ways took you to the end of the bottle but wage takes you by stimulation to revelation so is it real what's going out there in the world it's the rain but don't get confused don't get confused because you see this one go astray and you've seen that one go astray and you thought ma they were as a real brother they was a real sister and the rain fell on them and my they they sure enjoyed the presence of the Lord that just easily walk away a rare devotion just uh just a week ago or so and there was a there was a lady that had a dream had a dream and and the dream there was there was three sisters that were that were laid out that were sitting down and they were praying and the lady watching a dream she she watched as Jesus come behind all of these sisters as they were down praying and Jesus took his time with this one he took so much of his time and he really spent some time with her then then it goes on to the next one and Jesus didn't spend as much time with her but he spent some real time but when it come to the last one he just walked right past her and she thought does he not care about me he cared about them and she had all of these things in her mind like does he really love me he spent so much time with them he spent so much time with them but he didn't take the time to stop by my way and then Jesus turned to her and said I knew that you had faith and that you was going to make it these other sisters they needed more time with me but you've already spent so much time with me you knew how to win and it looks like God's overlooked you and it looks like he ain't spending this time but don't you recognize that he's been there all the time you didn't just start this journey yesterday but you started many years ago he knows how much time you need with him he knows what you need in this life if David was a man after his kind what ought we to be if he made man after his own image and that was his kind which was it it was flesh he made him flesh and what was it when Jesus came he was the royal Seed of Abraham what was it he was not so much yes he was there in the fleshly but not so much he was of the faith of Abraham he was of the faith of Abraham and you look that when Abraham he stood against every circumstance against every circumstance and Against All Odds Abraham believed notice when Jesus came he was of the Seed Faith of Abraham and notice what the Bible says in Galatians chapter 3 and verse 29 that if ye be in Christ then are you Abraham's seeds and heirs according to the promise so you are a children of the promise today you are the Original Seed you are the spoken word you wouldn't be here Mary I didn't Destin you to be here you're a virgin into nature your virgin in your soul you didn't take after some man-made's idea Lord tell you what I could just take off speaking in tongues right now you are the spoken word you are gonna rise you're not gonna fail you're not gonna be defeated you're not going to go into tribulation the Rapture is yours you are the Royal Seed of Abraham Hallelujah you're going to make it we know his language brother Daisy he can't leave us here they put something on the inside of us [Applause] some seed just needs a little bit more room to grow you think my goodness my goodness that brother that brother Shannon he sure is he sure is all over the place he needs a lot of room to grow what is he producing he's not just producing for him and sister Jenny but he's got a family he needs a lot of room he needs a lot of room I don't know where you are right now in your spiritual walk but I believe that you ought to make some room if you want to get that seed good and buried you got to make some room for it get it down in there and make sure that no devil in hell can be able to get it out when you plant this seed on the inside of Jesus there's no devil in hell that can get it out of Jesus and when Jesus calls for it there's nothing going to stop it from coming up thank you hallelujah what are we to be born of his bone life of his life power of his power under the same anointing what are we under we're not just under an Acts 2 anointing we're under the anointing of the mighty angel what are you doing what are you doing I'm making room because God's got some seeds that's coming and I don't know who is and I don't know who ate I'm just preaching the gospel and when it falls it's going to fall on good ground and when God goes to calling it and he sends the water upon it don't you be scared you just go ahead and enter in well you said well I can't dance like sister Katie I can't speak in tongues like sister Julia I can't get emotional like this one that or the other one I don't care if you can only move your finger move your finger but don't you be scared of the water it's what's gonna bring you up the heavens are pouring out I don't know if you recognize but in this room today are angels that are overcharged of every one of these seeds thank you and Satan that slick one slick one under that black cloak it's trying to go out there and sow seeds of discrepancy trying to choke out your faith trying to choke out your joy trying to give you all kinds of a depression and things that man has created what is it it's a devil but you see you are not a hybridized seed you have a thoroughbred you have a pedigree you know who you are you don't have spiritual Amnesia you've been cold under this generation This is the End Time seed that rises under the evening light make room for me make room for me make room for me I want you to know that you will be surprised who's going to be there God is not going to be surprised and who's going to be there but you will I prayed for them and it looked like they was never coming don't you worry you might be surprised they might come in at the last hour but they're going to get the same reward that you get they're going to get the same holy ghost that you got if they're going to be there they've got to come under the same rain [Applause] God didn't leave me this way for no reason you've been through hell just to be in this service you think about brother Ron we do our very best to keep you from seeing everything that goes on a lot of times he's throwing up before he walks behind this pulpit a lot of times you would say he's going through hell on Earth just to get into the pulpit foreign and these are his words let me just give you a little insight real quick so that maybe you'll appreciate it just a little bit deeper I'm ready at all times in case brother Ron gets sick and I'll take the pulpit and you'll never know the difference but one day he come and he was so sick he I know he I know he threw up eight times that day I said Dad I'm taking a day I'm taking a day you're you're just too weak he said no Andrew he said if I let Satan whip me with this one he'll know that's what it takes every single time to keep me from the pulpit I swear you can have it then because he knows that if he can get under this rain if you can get under this anointing you look at a man that's been so so beat up with cancer so sick all week long and all of a sudden under the power of the Holy Ghost he comes out and preaches and he stirs your heart he knows that if Satan can whip me with this one time he'll get me to stop the next time and you have been given a challenge to rise above everything cancer came by his way but it didn't stop him depression came by your way people talked about you people made fun of you but it didn't stop you from getting here you made a righteous decision to rise above every critic above every skeptic above every devil I'm going to make it well let me tell you there is a winner in this place and we've never started we've never started listening to losers and we're not going to listen to losers now Satan is a false prophet when he opens his mouth he speaks hypocrisy and he speaks lies but let every man's be a lie Every Man's word be alive but let God's word be true [Applause] he'll prophesy over drop of you you're not going to make it he'll prophesy that you're never going to win you're never going to get better you're going to die in this condition I want to remind you that Satan is a false prophet he's not got the hold on you you've got to hold on him just squeeze his neck kill the devil that's been destroying your marriage come on now come on now put your hand around his neck you've been destined to rise you've been dancing to win well look at my circumstances stop looking at your circumstances look at what God put on the inside of you thank you [Applause] you don't see it sometimes but I see it over your sister Mary I see it sometimes Satan comes in there and wars with you battles in your mind but the pillar of fire is there when you don't feel that he's there he's watching over you when you go through those those little clouds of things that he's he's watching over your life and you think it's just in my family history it's it's just how things are to be no the pillar of fire is there to change the course how did you get in this room tonight the purifier made sure [Applause] he made sure that you see him he made sure he made sure you get it he made sure that the word would come in the right time and he blanded it I'm telling you don't you be weary in well-known you're gonna have to break through some things you're going to break past yourself to break past some sins in your life you're going to break past I'd be I'd be real careful if I was Satan today I could feel you all the way up here and you're harassing and you are accepting that this is for you you're going to break through some stuff young people you're gonna have to break past some barriers you're going to break past some sins you're going to break past some mistakes there's some things that you go through in your and you're a human being a that you're going to break past things that you didn't want but we're handing it down to you there's some things in your life that you're gonna have to break some Cycles there's nervousness in your family but you're going to break past it there's depression in your family but you're going to break past it your mama died this way but you're gonna break past it Daddy went after alcohol but you're gonna break past it Daddy went this way and mama said it went this way but you've been given an abstract title deed that everything that was against your heritage has been struck off it's not just the title if you believe in but the abstract of the Holy Ghost has come upon your belief and everything that was stacked against you everything that would strike to get struck against you your mama may have been a prostitute your mama may have went this way and went that way but that which the Holy Ghost has deposited the Holy Ghost has removed it from here to Yonder it's not you just believing the message but the Holy Ghost has come upon your belief and give you an abstract you have a clear title deed of redemption in your hand you have every Authority that's the gene seed of God to tell Satan get off my property it's not just me saying some good words it's the Holy Ghost on the inside of me it ain't me praying it's a holy ghost send me pray that it ain't me asking for the healing it's him asking for the healing it ain't asking me I ain't even the one asking for the Deliverance it's him that's asking for it this is doing this is his joy and it's marvelous in his sight it's the abstract it's the title deed what you're asking for he's already been on the way Daniel you can pray and you can pray and it looks like it ain't coming but I want to tell you I am come for thy words I am here because you ask I am here because of this is my doing but I don't know if I can't brother Angel I'm telling you can now if you ain't got enough Faith about you I want you to I want you to believe in my faith real quick it was a brother Andrew I got so much stacked up against me and I just don't know if I can believe take my faith real quick take my faith to you I don't know how they're coming but take my faith real quick I don't know how I'm going to be healed but I want you to take my faith real quick my faith is not in myself my faith is in this word and if you don't believe you can I believe you can and let me get in your corner and I want to tell you are going to get up you are going to rise you are going to win you are going to succeed you're going to be an overcomer you're not going to be overcome you're not going to be a Survivor you're going to be a real winner you're going to March out of this age marching Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to war take my faith for a moment but don't rely on my faith take the faith of Jesus he said I have overcome the world take his faith for a moment he says you're going to be there are you okay on time I don't know I don't know where we were I love that I love that I didn't put myself here I didn't put myself here but he gathered me here he gathered me here just go back through the phrase your genealogy just for a moment really Thomas we had no rights to be here but he didn't call the righteous it was calling for a Bootleggers to understand in this community to preached the greatest message that there ever was so going by your personal deeds and going by the personal things in your life you should have never been in the room you should have never been here the false doctrines that you got yourself into the roads that you went down and it didn't look like there was no way but I want you to know that my God knows how to make a highway out of a sea laughs just laying there I ask us what are you doing what are you doing well I was just fellowshipping with him I was just fellishing with him that one that you've seen Daniel one that you've seen Ezekiel I was just having Communications with him house but all of a sudden he hears a voice and you've heard this voice before you heard it when you were a little child and you thought it's been so long since I've heard his voice I think about you I think about you when your little girl it didn't look like Mom and Daddy was coming but you wanted to come I wanted to go with Pat Baptist Church well I put that there or you have a fellowship with your thoughts just for a moment sister Cassie laughs in the Brethren Church and she was seeking more of the Holy Ghost and she went before the Elders of that church said she was wanting more and they said they couldn't they didn't know anything higher than just being baptized but something on the

not Prosper after this Revelation that has struck your heart today you ought to be able to say if God before me who can be against me I want to tell you you're as assured to win the victory as Joshua was assured to win a victory when when Moses commanded Joshua to go out there I'm in Exodus 17 he should destroy them and I'll stand up here on top of this mountain and I'll make sure that you win and when Moses was holding up his Rod as long as he was holding up his Rod Joshua was winning the battle but when his arms got tired arms sank down and Joshua begin to lose the battle but then there came Aaron and his sister and they held up Moses hand and if there ever was a time to hold up the hands of the message each time that we put our hands underneath this message [Music] that Jesus was sold under the commission to make sure that you won the victory he allowed those Roman jailers those Roman soldiers to tack his hands upon the cross [Music] upon the cross you are going to win [Music] you are going to win look at it you can't get his hands down he wanted to make sure that you knew that you were going to win so we allowed the ones that crucified him to nail his hands up there for a sign to the rest of the world that my pride will be victorious [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord why don't you give him praise [Music] Hallelujah I'm elected for it I'm chosen for it I've been called

brother by the name of brother Fisher he went there into that room and there was a lady that was that was that was almost gone and he said he began to speak to her this lady with those tumors who had her body he said Do You Believe Me you believe the Lord Do You Believe on it but she couldn't even speak she was so far gone all she could do was move her finger Smith Wigglesworth was told by his friend said it's too late she's done gone but Smith Wigglesworth took this corpse of a body lifeless of a body stood her up against a wardrobe carried her over against that wardrobe and said Satan come out in the name of Jesus Christ and walk he said little like a he said like a dime leaf or he said like a dying tree he said leave after Leaf after Leaf started falling off of her body and she began to walk I should begin to prophesy I should begin to walk I completely was healed right there Smith wiggle's word said that he was telling that in a service kind of like this he said he was telling me and he said when I begin to tell that a doctor stood up said that's nothing but the truth he said I examine that woman and that woman said there I was there I was up in heaven and she said there was a number an unnumberable number of saints and angels that were gathered around she said but all of a sudden I heard my name saying walk in the name of Jesus Christ and I was back in that Dimension again if Smith Wigglesworth could operate under that in the man age how much more should we operate under the ego anointing [Music] God put something on the inside of you stop hiding it stop covering up stop trying to put it down you were called for this Let it Loose Let it Loose the word is power Let it Loose if he was flashing and this body's flesh why don't you let the head begin to
