[29:47] that's questioned the Holy Ghost. If
[29:49] they, Brother William preached on it,
[29:51] Lord, I just, it's such an anchor in my
[29:52] heart that [music] you got to have it.
[29:54] You got to have it. If you don't have
[29:56] it, you will not make it.
[29:59] Lord, we're not playing church no more.
[30:00] It's time to leave. It's time for a
[30:02] rapture. The bodies will get sick.
[30:04] They're going to get sick. But Father,
[30:06] one day these [music] bodies will have
[30:07] to obey your word.
[30:10] And I pray God,
[30:13] if there's one here, just just one. I
[30:15] just I'll ask for one, [music] but I
[30:17] want a bunch of them [snorts]
[30:19] that don't have the Holy Ghost.
[30:22] I pray that this is their day, that this
[30:25] is their time.
[30:28] Cuz Lord, they could be out in a world
[30:29] of confusion. They can be out in the
[30:31] world [music] without you, without hope.
[30:34] Lord, how sad a situation that would be.
[30:37] [snorts] But Father, come.
[30:40] Have your way in service.
[30:43] Bless all the efforts that's been
[30:44] [music] put forth. Bless Brother Andrew,
[30:47] the church, the ministers here, Brother
[30:50] William, Brother Matt.
[30:53] We thank you for them, Lord. What a gift
[30:56] [music] you've given to us. And we just
[30:58] want to say thank you. And Father, we
[31:00] commit the service now in your hands in
[31:02] Jesus name. Amen.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. At this time, we're
[31:09] going to take up the morning's offering.
[31:11] We have a few specials this morning. We
[31:13] have brother Marcus Turner come and sing
[31:14] a special for us today. Then sister Beth
[31:17] Robinson and Sister Sarah, if you
[31:18] wouldn't mind coming in that order.
[31:20] Amen. Isn't it good to be a Christian
[31:22] today? Feel his wonderful presence
[31:24] breathing in this place and brooding
[31:25] over his children. Amen. As you give
[31:27] today, you can be seated afterwards. May
[31:29] God richly bless you. Amen.
[31:52] figure something out here.
[31:54] Sometimes they give you a heads up,
[31:56] sometimes they don't.
[32:07] Lord, we thank you.
[32:11] Empty and broken. I came back to him,
[32:17] a vessel unworthy,
[32:21] so sought by sin.
[32:24] But he did not despair. [music]
[32:28] He started over
[32:31] again.
[32:33] And I blessed the day. He didn't throw
[32:38] the clay away.
[32:41] Over
[32:43] [singing] and over
[32:45] he molds [music] me and makes me
[32:49] into
[32:51] his likeness.
[32:53] He fashions
[32:55] the clay.
[32:57] All a vessel [music]
[32:59] of honor
[33:02] I am
[33:04] today.
[33:06] All [singing]
[33:08] because Jesus
[33:10] didn't throw the clay away. [music]
[33:17] Oh, he is the potter
[33:21] and I [singing] am the clay
[33:26] molded [music]
[33:27] in his image.
[33:30] How he wants us [music]
[33:32] to stay. But when I stumble
[33:36] and I falter
[33:38] and my vessel breaks,
[33:43] he just picks up all the pieces. [music]
[33:46] He doesn't throw the clay away
[33:52] over [singing]
[33:54] and over.
[33:56] He [music] molds me and he makes me
[34:00] all into
[34:02] his likeness.
[34:04] He fashions
[34:06] all the clay.
[34:09] All a vessel
[34:11] of honor.
[34:14] All I am today.
[34:18] All because [music] Jesus
[34:22] doesn't throw
[34:24] the clay away. [music]
[34:28] Forgive me. Just any day now. Oh, the
[34:34] Lord is coming.
[34:37] Oh, he'll be [music] returning.
[34:39] [singing]
[34:41] Oh, for you and me.

[34:50] Oh, and I'll keep [music] on waiting.
[34:54] Oh, just any [singing] day now.
[34:59] Oh, his face I'll see.
[35:03] Oh, now [singing] I might stop. Oh, and
[35:07] take the time just to look around me.
[35:11] [music]
[35:12] Lord, I see the signs of his appearing.
[35:17] Lord, it's everywhere.
[35:21] For [music] the things [singing] he said
[35:24] would come to pass. They're now [music]
[35:27] before us,
[35:29] Lord. And I feel the strange excitement
[35:35] in the air.
[35:37] Oh, next [singing and music]
[35:40] day now.

[36:16] in my heart Lord for your appearing.

[53:04] Amen.
[53:05] Are you ready to have church?
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] Amen. The most important place that
[53:12] we'll be all week long. And and we're
[53:14] just so we're so glad to be here. want
[53:18] to remember brother Jason Jackson
[53:20] literally just sent me a note just just
[53:22] a few moments ago. Brother Tim
[53:24] Mccomomas. Uh [snorts] he was due to
[53:26] have a a heart cath on the 17th, but
[53:30] they rushed him to the hospital last
[53:32] night and u most of us know brother
[53:35] Mike, brother Tim Mccomomas. He's been
[53:37] here with his dad and with brother Jason
[53:40] and so he's a big boy and uh
[53:45] probably 63, 6'4, something like that.
[53:48] and he's a big boy and uh probably one
[53:51] of the most fun people I've ever been
[53:53] around in my life and and so uh
[53:56] [clears throat] they took him to the
[53:57] hospital last night. A lot of chest
[53:59] pains. When they did the X-rays, they
[54:02] found masses all over his lungs. And so
[54:06] uh there's one actually one mass
[54:07] attached to his heart that's 4 in uh
[54:11] around. That's a huge tumor. And so if
[54:14] you'll just pray for him that God would
[54:16] just come on the scene for him in a
[54:18] special way. His family got a wonderful
[54:20] young family and be with him. I would
[54:23] say Tim is probably what do you think
[54:25] he's about 40 years old. Tim Mccomomas
[54:29] 45. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. So we're just
[54:33] wanting to remember him in prayer. I
[54:34] told brother Jason that we would be
[54:36] praying as a body. And uh we believe in
[54:39] miracles, don't we?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've had some this week.
[54:43] Amen. Where's Brother Nathan at? He he
[54:46] here somewhere. There you are. That was
[54:48] a miracle, son.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; That was a miracle. And so, Amen. And my
[54:54] heart is so pleased that Sister Wanda
[54:56] ringing that bell.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:02] [applause] Amen.
[55:05] And one day, Sister Wanda, I'll ring
[55:08] that bell and we'll dance. And so, amen.
[55:11] Looking forward to that day. Amen.
[55:16] For those that have fought cancer, they
[55:17] know it's a battle. It's an absolute
[55:20] war. And so, keep remembering us in
[55:22] prayer. It takes a lot of different
[55:24] corners and a lot of different journeys.
[55:25] And so, you just pray for us.
[55:28] Revelations chapter 19 verse 6. And this
[55:31] is about us. And I heard as if it was a
[55:34] voice of a great multitude,
[55:37] as the voice of a many waters, as the
[55:40] voice of a mighty thundering, saying,
[55:42] "Hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent
[55:45] reignth. Let us be glad and rejoice and
[55:48] give honor to him, for the marriage of
[55:50] the Lamb is come, and his wife has made
[55:53] herself ready." And to her was granted
[55:56] that she should be arrayed in fine
[55:58] linen, clean and white. For the fine
[56:01] linen is the righteousness of the saint.
[56:03] And he said unto me, write blessed are
[56:06] they which are called unto the marriage
[56:09] supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me,
[56:12] for the these are the true sayings of
[56:16] God. Amen. You may be seated. May the
[56:19] Lord bless the reading of his word.
[56:31] I'd like to speak to you today on just a
[56:33] little thought
[56:35] on our pre our preparations to rule and
[56:38] reign.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; I want to take you to the church age
[56:43] book, Revelations 20 11 and 15. Brother
[56:47] Brandham says this, and if you'll stay
[56:49] very attentive to this quote. And I saw
[56:52] a great white throne and and him that
[56:54] sat on it.
[56:57] From whose face
[56:59] the earth and the heavens fled away,
[57:03] and there was found no place for them.
[57:05] And I saw the dead,
[57:07] small and great, stand before God. And
[57:11] the books were opened, and another book
[57:13] was opened, which is the book of life.
[57:16] And the dead were judged out of those
[57:18] things which were written in the books
[57:21] according to their works.
[57:24] And the sea gave up their dead which
[57:26] were in it.
[57:28] And death and hell delivered up the dead
[57:33] which were in them.
[57:35] And they were judged every man according
[57:38] to their works.
[57:41] And death and hell were cast into the
[57:44] lake of fire. And this is the second
[57:46] death.
[57:48] And whosoever was not found written in
[57:50] the book of life was cast into the lake
[57:54] of fire.
[57:56] And there will be both the righteous and
[57:59] the unrighteous
[58:01] in this judgment.
[58:04] It says so. These righteous will not be
[58:08] the bride. For the bride sits with him
[58:12] in the judgment. Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Man, that makes you want to just shout
[58:15] right there.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthiansap 11 and 6 and 2 and 3, he
[58:23] said, "Do you not know that the saints
[58:27] shall judge the earth?
[58:30] And if the world shall be judged by you,
[58:33] are ye unworthy to judge the smallest
[58:35] matters? Know ye not that we shall judge
[58:39] angels? How much more things that
[58:42] pertain to this life? Revelations 3 and
[58:45] 21. To him that overcomemeth will I
[58:48] grant to sit with me in my throne, even
[58:50] as I also overcame and sat down with my
[58:53] father in his throne. See, the bride is
[58:57] with him in the throne.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; See, the bride is with him in the throne
[59:05] and and she is to judge the world. She
[59:10] has to be sitting in the judgment with
[59:13] him. That is exactly what Daniel saw.
[59:17] Daniel 7 9 and 10. And I beheld till the
[59:21] thrones were cast down and the ancient
[59:23] of days did set whose garment was white
[59:27] as snow and the hair of the heads were
[59:31] were the like the pure wool. And his
[59:34] throne was like the fiery flame. and his
[59:38] wheels as a burning fire. A fiery stream
[59:42] issued and come forth from before him
[59:47] and thousands and thousands ministered
[59:49] unto him and 10 thousands times 10
[59:53] thousands stood before him. The judgment
[59:56] was set and the books were open. And it
[1:00:00] is the same scene for the thousands of
[1:00:03] thousands who are ministering to him are
[1:00:06] the bride for the who ministers to her
[1:00:10] husband but the bride.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I realize that I'm speaking to the bride
[1:00:16] of Jesus Christ. So I'm I'm going to be
[1:00:19] very careful with you this morning to
[1:00:21] let you know who you are. Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; I also realize that
[1:00:27] for our preparation to sit with him on
[1:00:30] the throne, our preparation happens
[1:00:33] here.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; There's nothing magical that happens in
[1:00:36] the rapture or right after you die to
[1:00:39] where that you get a what you might say
[1:00:42] a nature change or even a character
[1:00:46] change.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; All of that happens in this life.
[1:00:51] We're here in this life where it's 10
[1:00:53] years or 90 years and it is the molding
[1:00:57] of a character.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; We got to be molded. We got to go
[1:01:02] through test.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You know when you become a Christian all
[1:01:06] of a sudden now you're going upstream.
[1:01:09] Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; You remember back in the day when you
[1:01:13] were living another life,
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; alienated from the commonwealth of God,
[1:01:19] and it just seemed like you were going
[1:01:21] downstream. Sure, you had troubles.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Sure, you had sorrows,
[1:01:28] but you were living under a different
[1:01:30] king.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; And that king was destroying your life,
[1:01:35] destroying who you were.
[1:01:39] Ain't it amazing once God begins to deal
[1:01:42] with your life and begins to turn now
[1:01:45] you have real purpose
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; a real purpose to serve the Lord and now
[1:01:52] every enemy of hell turns against you
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; didn't seem like that enemy was there
[1:02:00] when you were partying and you were
[1:02:02] doing all the things of the world
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; but now it turns against you Right.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; I I did a
[1:02:14] um just a little little test last week.
[1:02:20] And I thought about I thought about
[1:02:24] every one of us have critics and
[1:02:25] enemies.
[1:02:28] All of us do. That's part of the molding
[1:02:30] process.
[1:02:32] I remember many years ago, brother Homer
[1:02:34] preached a sermon called beating a dead
[1:02:37] man.
[1:02:40] He said, "Now dead man laying in a
[1:02:42] casket, you can pinch him.
[1:02:46] You can cuss him.
[1:02:49] You can hit him right in the face.
[1:02:52] He won't flinch
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; because he's a dead man.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; You can say anything you want to about
[1:02:59] him. He's a dead man.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; There he lays.
[1:03:07] He's in another dimension.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, let me just take a couple
[1:03:15] thoughts here just for a moment.
[1:03:18] You can beat Brother Brandham now.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; You can beat John Wesley now. Right.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; You can beat all of the patriots of the
[1:03:29] ages now
[1:03:31] because they're gone.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; The record is closed.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; It's over with.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; What the critics don't know is they're
[1:03:42] wasting their energies.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; They're inspired from a dimension of the
[1:03:49] accuser of the brethren.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'LL FIND THOUGHT. THEY'LL FIND
[1:03:56] FAULT AND LET ME let me just go through
[1:03:57] some cycles here. THEY'LL FIND FAULT
[1:04:00] with the messenger
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; and they'll beat the messenger and
[1:04:04] they'll find all kind of their
[1:04:06] humanities
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; and before long you know that wasn't
[1:04:11] enough to do. Then they will beat the
[1:04:13] preacher
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; and you know that spirit won't quit.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Then they'll beat this.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:26] How will they do that? 40 different
[1:04:29] writers
[1:04:31] inspired by God
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; to write this holy word of God that you
[1:04:38] and I feast on every day.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; You see, the accuser of the brethren and
[1:04:44] his inspiration
[1:04:46] will never stop.
[1:04:50] SO WHEN YOU FIND A critic
[1:04:54] that is THAT IS CONSTANTLY HOUNDING THE
[1:04:56] MESSAGE, it's because they're inspired
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; from the realm of hell.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S NO BOTTOM TO IT.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Where did this sermon come from?
[1:05:16] I was sitting at brother Biscll's
[1:05:17] memorial
[1:05:19] getting ready to speak.
[1:05:22] I was speaking that with brother Tim
[1:05:24] Puit and one of the highest honors of my
[1:05:26] life to to speak one of my mentors.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Memorial
[1:05:33] brother Bisco meant an incredible amount
[1:05:35] to me.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He would say it over and over. There
[1:05:38] will come a time when my life's work
[1:05:41] will be sealed and I've done all that I
[1:05:45] can do for the kingdom of God.
[1:05:48] As I looked over that massive audience
[1:05:50] that day and
[1:05:52] and knowing the family and knowing the
[1:05:56] many of the people that had went to
[1:05:57] church there for decades,
[1:06:00] but there were some new faces there
[1:06:03] because brother Biscll was an incredible
[1:06:06] businessman.
[1:06:08] There was lawyers, businessmen sitting
[1:06:11] there.
[1:06:14] They only knew him by a business. They
[1:06:16] didn't know him by Pastor Ed.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; But what really broke my heart was
[1:06:24] there was family there.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; That I never met,
[1:06:31] sisters,
[1:06:33] extended family that had never heard a
[1:06:37] sermon that he preached.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] Today may be your first day and that
[1:06:45] might be kind of out of order,
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; but all of us, all of us sitting here
[1:06:51] today have extended family
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; that really don't know you.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; I just want to say it. They know you by
[1:06:59] an associate. They know you by business.
[1:07:02] I've been in business since I was 13
[1:07:04] years old. I've got a lot of business
[1:07:06] associates. Some of them extremely
[1:07:09] successful. I've sat in their boardrooms
[1:07:11] and we've been a part of many people's
[1:07:14] lives, but they don't know me of that
[1:07:17] eternal realm.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; AND I THINK HOW CLOSE THAT PEOPLE CAN
[1:07:22] COME.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; And miss THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF
[1:07:28] LIFE.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. Eternity
[1:07:37] is what we're all looking for. Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Bisll was a community leader.
[1:07:49] He was a developer of a lot of land.
[1:07:52] Developed a lot of different things.
[1:07:56] I want to flip that just for a moment.
[1:07:59] And yet in his life, he had a lot of
[1:08:01] people jealous of him.
[1:08:06] They were jealous.
[1:08:09] Jealous of his being, jealous of his
[1:08:12] wealth,
[1:08:14] JEALOUS OF his position.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; They never did anything in life.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Probably never won a soul to Christ.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? MANY OF YOUR CRITICS
[1:08:28] HAS NEVER done nothing for God. Come on.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; They may have wrote a blog or did a
[1:08:33] video, but they never did anything for
[1:08:35] God.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; LET'S JUST PUT IT HOW IT IS. BUT THEY'LL
[1:08:40] STAND AT THE judgment
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; under the inspiration of
[1:08:50] the spirit of the accuser.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Now, they may have been very wealthy in
[1:08:56] life. Let me preach. They may have
[1:08:58] attained a lot of a lot of be a
[1:09:01] millionaire,
[1:09:02] own a huge house and a and A CAR, BUT
[1:09:05] WHAT WOULD IT be like to stand before
[1:09:08] the judgment hall of God
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; and you be sitting
[1:09:16] on
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; IN JUDGMENT,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:09:20] AND THEY SPENT A GREAT PORTION OF their
[1:09:23] life FIGHTING
[1:09:26] WHAT WAS really real.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I would hate to think that I sat in this
[1:09:41] church
[1:09:43] for 20 years and missed it.
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; I think how close that you can be
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; to eternal life and miss it.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Let me just SAY IT. THERE'S NOTHING more
[1:09:59] important.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And I want to say it from the bottom of
[1:10:03] my heart this if this would be my last
[1:10:05] sermon to ever preach. THERE'S NOTHING
[1:10:08] MORE IMPORTANT
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; THAN SERVING GOD.
[1:10:14] WE'RE NOT HERE TO BE ENTERTAINED.
[1:10:18] [applause]
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HERE FOR A SOCIAL VISIT.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HERE TO BE MOTIVATED AND
[1:10:27] UPLIFTED AND GO BACK IN THE WORLD and be
[1:10:30] the same thing.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE TO BE CHANGED AND TRANSFORMED
[1:10:36] BY THE POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE. DON'T WASTE YOUR
[1:10:46] TIME.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; The saints
[1:10:56] will ruin rain,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; but before they rule and reign, they're
[1:11:02] going to walk in HIS SPIRIT,
[1:11:06] WALK IN HIS LOVE,
[1:11:08] WALK IN HIS FORGIVENESS.
[1:11:11] WHERE ARE WE going to do that? Here.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; We're in training.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Our present life is not just random or
[1:11:24] by chance.
[1:11:27] It is preparation to live in that
[1:11:29] kingdom.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say to obtain
[1:11:34] forgiveness, you got to give
[1:11:35] forgiveness. Amen. [snorts]
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; I sat in the office one day with a young
[1:11:42] man and he said, "I don't forgive."
[1:11:46] He's very quick to tell me, "I hold
[1:11:49] grudges.
[1:11:52] Somebody does something to me, I'll
[1:11:54] never forgive him." AND I'D SIMPLY SAID
[1:11:57] THESE WORDS to him, "You can never be a
[1:12:00] Christian."
[1:12:04] And I say this young man was probably
[1:12:06] 40, 50 years old. You sit there with me.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Why waste 40, 50 years if you can't
[1:12:15] learn the simple principle of
[1:12:17] forgiveness.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; You got to be able to forgive.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus's prayer was all about
[1:12:27] forgiveness.
[1:12:34] In Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10,
[1:12:37] notice these words. For we are his
[1:12:40] workmanship,
[1:12:42] created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[1:12:45] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:12:48] should walk in them.
[1:12:51] Wherefore remember that ye being in
[1:12:54] times past Gentiles in the flesh
[1:12:59] who are called uncircumcision by that
[1:13:01] which is called circumcision in the
[1:13:04] flesh made by hands.
[1:13:08] That at that time ye were without
[1:13:10] Christ. Notice this. at that time being
[1:13:14] without Christ being an aliens from the
[1:13:19] commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:13:22] from the covenants of promise having no
[1:13:25] hope.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY WITHOUT JESUS YOU GOT NO
[1:13:28] HOPE
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT GOD in the world but now
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord. But now
[1:13:40] IN CHRIST JESUS, YE HAVE YE WHO
[1:13:43] SOMETIMES WERE A FAR OFF are made nigh
[1:13:47] BY THE [screaming] BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:13:50] CHRIST.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1 and verse 12, giving thanks
[1:13:57] unto the father which hath made us meat
[1:14:00] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[1:14:02] the saints in light.
[1:14:05] who hath delivered us FROM THE POWER OF
[1:14:08] DARKNESS. THAT'S enough to shout about.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And hath translated us into the kingdom
[1:14:16] of his dear son.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; In whom we have redemption through his
[1:14:22] blood, even the forgiveness of sin.
[1:14:27] Who is the image of the invisible God,
[1:14:31] the firstborn of every creature
[1:14:35] by whom we are all are create things
[1:14:38] created that are in heaven
[1:14:41] that are in earth,
[1:14:43] visible and invisible, whether they be
[1:14:47] thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:14:52] or powers,
[1:14:54] all things were created by him and for
[1:14:57] him. And he is before all things,
[1:15:02] and by him all things consist.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; He is the head of the body,
[1:15:10] the church, who is the beginning, the
[1:15:12] firstborn from the dead, who in all
[1:15:15] things he might have preeminence. Oh, I
[1:15:18] like that.
[1:15:20] For it pleased the Father that in him
[1:15:24] should all fullness dwell.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Notice these next words. And having made
[1:15:30] peace through the blood of the cross by
[1:15:34] him to reconcile all things unto
[1:15:36] himself. By him I say, whether they be
[1:15:39] things in earth
[1:15:42] or things in heaven.
[1:15:45] And you that were sometimes alienated
[1:15:48] and enemies in your mind by wicked
[1:15:51] works, yet hath he reconciled
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; in the body of his flesh through death
[1:16:01] to present you, notice these words,
[1:16:05] holy,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; unblamable,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; unreprovable.
[1:16:13] Notice these next words, brother Doug.
[1:16:15] THIS IS POWERFUL. IN HIS SIGHT.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Not in anybody else's sight.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; In his sight.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHO WE GOT TO PLEASE.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; HIS SIGHT.
[1:16:32] AMEN.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And if you continue in the faith,
[1:16:36] grounded and settled, and be not moved
[1:16:39] away from the hope of the gospel, which
[1:16:42] he hath heard, and which was preached to
[1:16:45] every creature, which is unto heaven.
[1:16:48] Wherefore I, Paul, and made a minister.
[1:16:55] Come here just a second. I need a little
[1:16:56] help.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; He's going to get me some Tylenol
[1:17:15] for those that are have inquiring minds.
[1:17:24] I I throwed up so much over the last
[1:17:26] week until I'm so sore in my abdomen.
[1:17:30] Maybe the Tylenol will help.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; But I'm still here.
[1:17:37] [applause]
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:17:47] Amen. Now we pray it works.
[1:17:56] I'm sorry.
[1:17:58] It's just life.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Just life.
[1:18:03] Thank you, brother Bernardet.
[1:18:05] I sure love you, buddy.
[1:18:09] I want to just kind of turn just for a
[1:18:11] moment.
[1:18:13] Brother Brandham had a conversation
[1:18:16] beyond the curtain of time.
[1:18:22] And I want to bring negative and
[1:18:24] positive here. Think
[1:18:27] of of all of the negative that is on the
[1:18:32] internet about brother Brandham.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; And if you look long enough, there's
[1:18:37] negative about you.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I I want you to just watch this
[1:18:43] just for a moment. Brother Brandham has
[1:18:45] a conversation
[1:18:47] beyond the curtain of time.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it's already settled.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; You're Well, brother Rhonda, we don't
[1:18:58] know if the message is right. Well, let
[1:19:00] me just give you some assurance right
[1:19:01] here this morning.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam is having a conversation
[1:19:07] in that realm
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; that is more real than this realm. Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And then that voice was speaking from
[1:19:15] above me said, "You know it is written
[1:19:18] in the Bible that the prophets were
[1:19:20] gathered with their people." And I said,
[1:19:23] "Yes, I I remember that in the
[1:19:25] scriptures." And he said, "Well,
[1:19:29] well, this is when you will gather with
[1:19:32] your people." And I said,
[1:19:35] "Then they'll be real." And I can feel
[1:19:39] them. Oh yes.
[1:19:43] And I said, "But there's millions.
[1:19:47] There's millions.
[1:19:52] There's not that many Brandhams."
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Notice he's thinking earthly, too.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And that voice said, "They're not
[1:20:01] Brandoms.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Them is your converts.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; That's the ones that you've led to the
[1:20:19] Lord
[1:20:22] and said, "Some of them women there that
[1:20:25] you think is so beautiful
[1:20:28] were better than 90 years old when you
[1:20:32] led them to the Lord."
[1:20:37] No wonder they're screaming, "OUR
[1:20:39] PRECIOUS BROTHER."
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And they screamed all at once, "IF YOU
[1:20:44] HADN'T WENT, we wouldn't be here."
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And I looked around. I thought, "I don't
[1:20:52] get it." And I said, "Where's Jesus?"
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEE HIM SO BAD. And they said,
[1:21:01] "Now he's just a little higher." Right
[1:21:04] up that way. Someday he will come to
[1:21:08] you.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Said, "You were sent to for a leader.
[1:21:14] And God will come. And when he'll do
[1:21:17] when he does, notice these words, he'll
[1:21:21] judge you according to what you taught
[1:21:24] them."
[1:21:26] first whether they go in or not,
[1:21:31] we'll go in according to your teaching.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, I'm so glad
[1:21:38] I did." Did Paul,
[1:21:42] notice what he says. Did Paul, does he
[1:21:46] have to stand like this?
[1:21:48] DOES PETER HAVE TO STAND like this? Yes.
[1:21:54] AND I SAID, "THEN I PREACHED EVERY WORD
[1:21:57] THAT THEY PREACHED.
[1:22:01] [applause]
[1:22:05] [applause]
[1:22:08] I never divvied FROM IT FROM ONE SIDE TO
[1:22:12] THE OTHER. THEY BAPTIZED in the name of
[1:22:14] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND I DID TOO.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Were they taught the baptism OF THE HOLY
[1:22:21] GHOST, I DID TOO.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THEY TAUGHT, I DID TOO.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And the people screamed and said, "We
[1:22:32] know that.
[1:22:34] We know where we're going with you
[1:22:36] someday
[1:22:37] back to earth.
[1:22:39] Jesus will come and you'll be judged
[1:22:42] according to the word that you preached
[1:22:44] us.
[1:22:46] And then if you are accepted at that
[1:22:48] time which you will be
[1:22:52] [cheering]
[1:22:53] [applause]
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; then you will present us to him as your
[1:23:05] trophies of your ministry.
[1:23:08] You will guide us to him and alto
[1:23:11] together we'll go back to the earth
[1:23:15] to live forever.
[1:23:26] [snorts]
[1:23:29] I want to give you a little secret,
[1:23:30] trade secret that I have.
[1:23:33] They they call it they got a mental
[1:23:35] condition that you are if you do this.
[1:23:39] If you get a book and if you read the
[1:23:42] last chapter before you read any of it,
[1:23:47] you're supposed to have a you're
[1:23:49] supposed to have a certain mental
[1:23:51] condition. Well, I've did that my whole
[1:23:53] life.
[1:23:57] So, what I'm doing to you is I'm reading
[1:23:59] you the last chapter.
[1:24:02] [applause]
[1:24:10] [applause]
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother, I don't know if
[1:24:13] I'm going to make it or not." Did you
[1:24:15] just listen to what I said? Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; We believe this message with all of our
[1:24:20] heart [applause and cheering]
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S ALREADY SAID YOU'LL BE
[1:24:24] ACCEPTED.
[1:24:30] [applause]
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; QUIT STRUGGLING. FLY LIKE AN EAGLE.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; I thought when you sung that song, it
[1:24:37] couldn't have been more perfect. YOU
[1:24:39] DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE. YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:24:41] TO STRIDE.
[1:24:45] HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:56] NOW,
[1:25:00] this comes from a favorite speech of
[1:25:01] mine.
[1:25:05] It is not the critic who counts,
[1:25:09] Teddy Roosevelt.
[1:25:12] It is not the critic who counts.
[1:25:15] Not the man who points out how the
[1:25:18] strong man stumbles
[1:25:20] or the doer of deeds could have done
[1:25:24] them better.
[1:25:26] The credit the credit belongs to the man
[1:25:31] who is actually in the arena
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; whose face is marred with dust and sweat
[1:25:39] and blood. who strives valiantly, who
[1:25:43] hes,
[1:25:44] who comes up short again and again
[1:25:48] because
[1:25:51] because there is no effort without error
[1:25:55] or shortcoming.
[1:25:58] But who does actually strive to do the
[1:26:01] deeds,
[1:26:03] who knows great enthusiasm and great
[1:26:06] devotions,
[1:26:07] who spends himself
[1:26:10] in a worthy cause. WHO AT BEST knows in
[1:26:15] the end and triumph of a high
[1:26:17] achievement.
[1:26:19] And who at worst if he fails
[1:26:23] at least fails while do daring greatly
[1:26:28] and so that his place shall never be
[1:26:30] with those cold timid souls
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; did neither know victory
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; or defeat.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:26:45] Brother Tim Puit a few years ago
[1:26:46] preached a sermon.
[1:26:49] He preached a sermon on rewards. You
[1:26:52] haven't heard it, go listen to it.
[1:26:55] And so I'd like you to just gather some
[1:26:56] of our thoughts just for a moment.
[1:27:00] Brother Tim says we're going to give an
[1:27:02] account for our life.
[1:27:04] At the end of the day, we're going to
[1:27:05] give an account for our life.
[1:27:10] I cannot imagine
[1:27:13] spending your life
[1:27:15] attacking the prophet.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Attacking the church.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Attacking the bride.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, do you have anybody in
[1:27:25] mind? No. But I hope you don't put your
[1:27:27] shoes on fit this sermon.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; What do you really think you were doing,
[1:27:37] Mr. critic,
[1:27:40] when you were thinking about destroying
[1:27:43] the bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:27:47] did you stop and think about what spirit
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; was driving you?
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; We got a couple examples IN THE
[1:27:57] SCRIPTURE. PAUL SAID, "Deus
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; has forsaken me."
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:04] Think about the two men that stood
[1:28:06] before Moses throwed their rod down,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; ATTACKING THE PROPHET OF GOD,
[1:28:14] and Moses's rod ate their rod up.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just think about
[1:28:20] this.
[1:28:22] The critic throwed their rod down.
[1:28:27] After today, THE CRITIC'S ROD WOULD BE A
[1:28:32] ROD IN MOSES'S HAND.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; The critics's portion would be a rod in
[1:28:39] Moses's hand. And he would STRETCH THAT
[1:28:42] ROD OUT OVER the sea.
[1:28:46] [applause]
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; GOD NEVER FORGETS.
[1:28:57] AMEN.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody attacks you, REMEMBER THIS, YOU
[1:29:02] DON'T HAVE TO ATTACK THEM BACK.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; They have went on eternal record
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; and sealed their doom.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're just trying to
[1:29:20] protect Brother Brandham. Nope. Let me
[1:29:24] bring you up to date for a little while.
[1:29:25] I've been a historian for a long time.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; The same thing happened to Spurgeon.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; In his life,
[1:29:36] Spurgeon was known as one of the
[1:29:38] greatest preachers that ever lived.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; He built a cathedral,
[1:29:47] a cathedral to where that it would hold
[1:29:49] thousands of thousands of people.
[1:29:52] He spent incredible amount of time
[1:29:55] raising the funds
[1:29:57] that would build his huge tabernacle,
[1:30:01] still a spacious place that stands
[1:30:03] today.
[1:30:05] But his own school rejected him.
[1:30:11] Those rejectors
[1:30:13] would would turn not only on Spurgeon,
[1:30:16] but they would turn on his preachers.
[1:30:19] And then they would turn on the Bible
[1:30:22] itself.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; John Wesley,
[1:30:27] a man that was known for creating a
[1:30:30] movement called the new method.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; We would know him as a messenger of the
[1:30:36] church ages.
[1:30:42] His own church turned on him
[1:30:45] after all the incredible works.
[1:30:48] give you an idea. Tens of thousands of
[1:30:51] people would be slain in the spirit of
[1:30:53] God.
[1:30:55] His mother would be an incredible
[1:30:56] writer. His wife,
[1:30:59] listen, down through the ages, these
[1:31:02] kind of men that stood in this kind of
[1:31:05] statue HAD CRITICS THAT WOULD TURN on
[1:31:08] them.
[1:31:11] I want to just ask you one question.
[1:31:13] What if Spurgeon would walk back into
[1:31:18] the churches that followed him today.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Wonder how that they would feel
[1:31:29] as virgin would take the pull pit today.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And I'm only picking two because I'm
[1:31:34] going to I want to try to be as brief as
[1:31:37] I CAN. WHAT IF JOHN WESLEY WALKED INTO
[1:31:40] THE MODERN Methodist church today?
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; A man that preached strict holiness.
[1:31:49] strict holiness OF WHAT THE BRIDE OF
[1:31:52] JESUS CHRIST MUST DRESS LIKE, HOW SHE
[1:31:55] MUST CONDUCT HERSELF.
[1:32:00] WHAT IF HE WALKED INTO THE LARGEST
[1:32:01] METHODIST CHURCH TODAY
[1:32:04] THAT NOW HAS GENDER PROBLEMS,
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; That now has changed the rules.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Dress code is a million miles away.
[1:32:16] WOMEN PREACHERS ARE THERE.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; SODOM AND GOMORRAH HAS FILLED HER
[1:32:20] TABERNACLES.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; THE SERMON THAT JOHN WESLEY WOULD
[1:32:28] PREACH.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; I want to finish this thought here. But
[1:32:34] William Brham could come into our
[1:32:36] church.
[1:32:39] [applause]
[1:32:47] and churches like all over the world
[1:32:49] that are following this message under
[1:32:51] real godly men
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; and take the pullpit
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; and be unashamed
[1:32:58] OF THE AUDIENCE THAT SITS BEFORE HER.
[1:33:01] [applause]
[1:33:06] HALLELUJAH. Let's give the Lord a hand
[1:33:08] right there.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, what makes you guys feel
[1:33:23] the way you do? Well, I just want to
[1:33:25] pick one quote if I can. He said, "WELL,
[1:33:28] YOU WERE SEPARATED from your first union
[1:33:31] by your spiritual death. Now you're born
[1:33:35] again or remarried again to the new
[1:33:38] spirit union."
[1:33:40] or
[1:33:42] of of not your natural life of the
[1:33:46] things of the world, but of eternal
[1:33:49] life.
[1:33:51] That germ that was in you at the
[1:33:53] beginning found you and now your old
[1:33:56] book is gone and your union, your old
[1:33:59] union, your name in your old has been
[1:34:03] transferred.
[1:34:06] And you say, "Well, do you mean to tell
[1:34:08] me that my old book, God put it in the
[1:34:12] sea of forgetfulness?"
[1:34:15] You now stand perfectly
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; before God.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And your name is now in a new book. Not
[1:34:25] the book of life, but the Lamb's
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; book of life.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; That's enough to shout. your new life in
[1:34:34] the Lamb's Book OF LIFE. YOUR MARRIAGE
[1:34:37] CERTIFICATE, HALLELUJAH,
[1:34:39] where your true eternal germ from the
[1:34:44] beginning takes hold. You're not only
[1:34:47] forgiven.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT ONLY FORGIVEN, YOU'RE
[1:34:53] JUSTIFIED.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; AND JUSTIFIED IS AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID
[1:34:59] IT.
[1:35:03] YOU NEVER [screaming] DID it
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; in the first place.
[1:35:08] [applause]
[1:35:14] Now I want to go to one of brother
[1:35:16] Frasier's favorite quotes.
[1:35:21] [snorts]
[1:35:24] some time ago
[1:35:27] crossed through Central America
[1:35:30] and there was a minister by the name of
[1:35:32] Daniel Greenfield.
[1:35:35] He went to sleep one night and he
[1:35:37] dreamed
[1:35:38] he dreamed he had died
[1:35:41] and he was taken up to the gates of
[1:35:43] paradise
[1:35:45] and when he knocked at the door the
[1:35:48] doorkeeper came and said, "Who are you?
[1:35:54] that desires to enter in these gates.
[1:35:58] He said, "I'm Daniel Greenfield.
[1:36:01] I am an American evangelist.
[1:36:04] Just a moment there.
[1:36:06] I will see if I can find that any record
[1:36:09] of you here."
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And he came back and he said, "There's
[1:36:14] no record of you here."
[1:36:17] Oh, there must be something wrong.
[1:36:21] Surely my record's there.
[1:36:25] No, there's no record here.
[1:36:29] What shall I do?
[1:36:31] There's only one thing that you can do
[1:36:33] if you wish to. You can appeal your case
[1:36:38] to the white throne of judgment.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; If you wish to appeal your case,
[1:36:44] he said, "Well, if that's all I can do,
[1:36:47] I will do it." And he said he begin to
[1:36:50] move out through space and he seemed for
[1:36:53] some time that he traveled just in
[1:36:55] space. And after a while he come into it
[1:36:59] where he be to get light and lighter and
[1:37:01] lighter and light gotten. And slower he
[1:37:04] be to move and finally right in the
[1:37:07] center of this light he stopped.
[1:37:11] There was no certain place that it was
[1:37:13] coming from but just all around him
[1:37:16] extreme light.
[1:37:19] just many times together, more brighter
[1:37:21] than the sun. And he said he looked
[1:37:24] around and after a while the great deep
[1:37:26] voice said, "Who art thou that stands
[1:37:30] before my judgment?"
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm Daniel Greenfield,
[1:37:36] the American evangelist. I came to the
[1:37:39] gates of paradise
[1:37:41] and I was asked to come here to your
[1:37:44] judgment seat to find if I could plead
[1:37:47] my case.
[1:37:49] And said a voice came back and said,
[1:37:50] "Very well, Daniel Greenfield, I will
[1:37:54] try you at my judgment seat.
[1:37:58] I have a law that you stand to be tried
[1:38:01] by."
[1:38:02] Daniel Greenfield,
[1:38:04] did you ever tell a a lie
[1:38:08] while you was on earth?
[1:38:10] I thought I had been a truthful man. But
[1:38:14] in the presence of that great light, I
[1:38:17] seen that there was many times that I
[1:38:20] that I had said things that just wasn't
[1:38:22] right.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yes, Lord,
[1:38:27] I lied."
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:30] Daniel Greenfield, did you ever steal
[1:38:34] while you was on the earth?
[1:38:37] He began to say, 'If there's anything
[1:38:39] that I thought about, I'd been I'd been
[1:38:42] honest.
[1:38:44] But in the presence of that great lot,
[1:38:49] I seen there was many little shady deals
[1:38:52] that I had pulled.
[1:38:54] I said, 'Listen friends, you might think
[1:38:57] that you're all right now,
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; but in the presence of that light, it'll
[1:39:02] be different.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; You might be a GOOD CHURCH MEMBER. YOU
[1:39:07] MIGHT HAVE GOOD DRESS. You might be a
[1:39:10] help to the poor. YOU MIGHT BE ALL
[1:39:11] RIGHT, BUT in the presence of that great
[1:39:14] light,
[1:39:16] that white throne judgment. And then a
[1:39:19] voice said, "Daniel Greenfield,
[1:39:23] was you perfect in your life?"
[1:39:27] And I said, "Oh no, Lord,
[1:39:30] I wasn't perfect." I believe that's
[1:39:31] where we would all answer.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And said he was listening for great
[1:39:38] blast to come from somewhere and hear
[1:39:41] him say, "Depart from me."
[1:39:44] said his bones begin to come unjointed
[1:39:47] as he was there and he was trembling
[1:39:50] knowing that he would sink into a
[1:39:52] devil's hell in a few minutes to be
[1:39:54] there for eternity.
[1:39:58] And said while he was thinking about
[1:39:59] that and listened for a voice, he said,
[1:40:03] "I heard a voice behind me.
[1:40:06] It was the sweetest voice I ever heard
[1:40:08] in my life.
[1:40:11] It was sweeter than any mother's voice
[1:40:13] that I'd ever heard. And said, "When I
[1:40:15] turned, I I seen the sweetest face that
[1:40:18] I ever saw." And he put his arms around
[1:40:21] me
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Father, that's true."
[1:40:26] Daniel Greenfield wasn't so perfect in
[1:40:28] his life
[1:40:30] that there's one thing that he did.
[1:40:34] When my glory was made known, Daniel
[1:40:37] Greenfield
[1:40:39] stood for me on earth.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:43] [applause]
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; And now I'LL STAND FOR HIM HERE.
[1:40:50] [applause]
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Mother man went back about 150 years and
[1:41:05] picked up a story about a pardon.
[1:41:12] The president was Abraham Lincoln
[1:41:17] and there was a young man that got got
[1:41:19] was in the war and he'd run in a really
[1:41:22] bad time and the penalty was death for
[1:41:25] running.
[1:41:26] But that man had a friend
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; that understood the conditions of his
[1:41:32] running.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; You can't go no higher than the
[1:41:36] president of the United States.
[1:41:39] This man found his way into the presence
[1:41:44] of Abraham Lincoln.
[1:41:49] Abraham Lincoln wasn'tware that he had,
[1:41:52] you know, the best what you might say
[1:41:55] papers or stamp,
[1:41:58] but he simply wrote, "You're pardoned."
[1:42:02] and signed his name.
[1:42:05] and he took it to the authorities
[1:42:08] and he took it to this young man.
[1:42:11] And this YOUNG MAN SAID, "YOU'RE MAKING
[1:42:13] FUN OF ME."
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; THIS COMES ON JUST SOME SIMPLE PAPER.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; IF IT WAS FROM THE PRESIDENT, it it have
[1:42:21] stationery. IT HAVE HIS name
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; and it would be a seal on it. Right.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not GOING TO BE MADE FUN OF.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; This young man was that went and done
[1:42:37] all the work to get it was brokenhearted
[1:42:41] cuz he knew he'd been with the
[1:42:43] president.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And he knew how much
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; this paper means.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; I can say it to you. I know how much
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; this sermon means.
[1:42:58] [applause]
[1:43:06] They put that boy to death.
[1:43:09] This young man pressed the case
[1:43:13] and the judgment came down. A a pardon
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; is not a pardon
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; unless it's accepted.
[1:43:23] as a pardon.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I want to SAY THIS TO YOU. THIS MESSAGE
[1:43:30] HAS GOT A PARDON IN IT.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS FULL OF GRACE
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S FULL of mercy.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; It's full of forgiveness.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ACCEPT IT AS THAT WAY.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO ACCEPT IT. YOUR LIFE MAY HAVE
[1:43:52] BEEN MISERABLE,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD REWRITES your life.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Can you give me just a little bit
[1:44:11] longer?
[1:44:14] [snorts]
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; There's a major difference between the
[1:44:17] Old Testament and the New.
[1:44:22] By the way, you have a Bible. One of you
[1:44:24] guys got a Bible.
[1:44:27] I want you to I want you to come to the
[1:44:30] Old Testament, Malachi,
[1:44:33] and the New Testament.
[1:44:36] I want you to hold your place right
[1:44:38] there. I want you to I want you to come
[1:44:41] stand beside me when you do that.
[1:44:45] [snorts]
[1:44:48] In the Old Testament, they were covered
[1:44:50] by blood of bulls and goats and
[1:44:52] covenants.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; It didn't change their life.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of honest things that are
[1:44:58] written here.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; And I want to go over some of them.
[1:45:02] Honest things.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; These people didn't have wings on backs.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] And God made them not only write the
[1:45:13] great things, but he made them write the
[1:45:16] negative.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Can you stay there just a little bit?
[1:45:24] Abraham
[1:45:29] Abraham became a liar.
[1:45:32] That's right.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; And listen, I'm doing this with great
[1:45:37] grace.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; When he told the king said, "She's my
[1:45:41] sister."
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; She's my sister.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; How close
[1:45:49] that he came to not being able to
[1:45:52] fulfill
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; the potential that God had in him. Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; IF I COULD SUBTITLE THIS JUST FOR THE
[1:45:59] NEXT FEW MOMENTS. IN SPITE OF THE FLAW.
[1:46:02] THAT'S
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; GOD OVERRIDES THE FLAW IN YOUR LIFE
[1:46:08] BECAUSE HE'S GOT A PURPOSE.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; And you LOOK AT YOUR FLAW. YOU LOOK AT
[1:46:15] YOUR MISTAKES AND SAY, "I CAN NEVER
[1:46:18] WELL, STAY WITH ME THE next little bit.
[1:46:23] I want you to think about she's in a
[1:46:25] king's palace,
[1:46:28] heathen king's palace, and he has taken
[1:46:31] her to be his wife, and he's out there
[1:46:36] praying for before God. SARAH THAT GOD
[1:46:40] HAD CHANGED BACK YOUNG AGAIN. GOD HAD
[1:46:43] SET AT HIS TENT.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD SAT AT HIS TENT.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "THY SEED SHALL POSSESS THE
[1:46:53] GATES OF their enemy."
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; And because of a lie.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; How big was this lie?
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; God don't intervene. She's going to be
[1:47:09] married to a heathen king.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:12] And everything God has told Abraham is
[1:47:14] now nulling
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; God. That's right.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we're in trouble if
[1:47:19] God don't intervene.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Moses writes the first five books of the
[1:47:28] Bible, including the Garden of Eden.
[1:47:41] Brother Ron, but brother Brandham made
[1:47:43] thoughts. I want you to stick with me.
[1:47:47] Before
[1:47:48] Moses meets the pillar of fire,
[1:47:52] he kills an Egyptian soldier.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; He was a murderer. Right.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; We don't have any better way to say it,
[1:48:00] but he was a murderer.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Moses had an extremely high temper.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; David,
[1:48:20] who knows exactly how many chapters that
[1:48:23] David writes. We could go figure it up.
[1:48:27] He writes your psalms
[1:48:31] throughout the scriptures, the Old
[1:48:33] Testament.
[1:48:35] But folks, let me just say this to you.
[1:48:37] Because of adultery,
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; because of adultery,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; because of adultery,
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; as a king.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:49] [snorts]
[1:48:50] He has his best friend who is a gentile
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; who is fighting for the Jews,
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; fighting for David. He has that man
[1:49:00] killed.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip through something here
[1:49:12] for a minute for the sake of time and my
[1:49:14] energies.
[1:49:20] Titus, want you to come here.
[1:49:27] Come right here.
[1:49:30] Titus is about the age of Steven.
[1:49:35] Stephen being full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:39] Stephen has in phenomenal potential.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Phenomenal potential.
[1:49:48] And Paul will live with it the rest of
[1:49:51] his life. Right.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Take your off.
[1:50:02] Now, God has a plan.
[1:50:06] Paul is going to write 14 books of your
[1:50:10] Bible.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO WRITE 14 BOOKS of your
[1:50:15] Bible.
[1:50:20] YOU TALKING ABOUT GRACE AND MERCY?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; You talking ABOUT GRACE AND MERCY. GOD
[1:50:26] COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; GOD COULD HAVE STOPPED IT. BROTHER RAY,
[1:50:33] BUT HE WATCHES THIS YOUNG MAN
[1:50:37] AFTER HE'S PREACHED A PHENOMENAL SERMON.
[1:50:40] THAT'S
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BEFORE THAT COUNCIL,
[1:50:44] PAUL HOLDS HIS his coat in his hand.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Steven's words were, "I see Jesus
[1:50:56] standing.
[1:51:00] [sighs and snorts]
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; I see Jesus standing."
[1:51:07] Paul will will spend the rest of his
[1:51:10] life thinking about holding that coat.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; All but Paul and I could have I've got
[1:51:24] about a hundred more there.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; All but Paul's in the Old Testament.
[1:51:32] Did God throw him away?
[1:51:35] AMEN.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; DID GOD DESTROY THEM?
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; They'll be there for eternity.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; But let ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT TIME
[1:51:45] AND ETERNITY.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; From this book to this book,
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; come on. [snorts]
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; FROM THIS BOOK, THE OLD TESTAMENT TO THE
[1:51:56] NEW TESTAMENT,
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD OF JESUS WASHES ALL OF THAT
[1:52:01] AWAY. [cheering]
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:52:12] [applause]
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; WASHES it all.
[1:52:20] Washes it all. That's just men. Sarah,
[1:52:24] won't you stand and be Tamar?
[1:52:34] You've heard about the lion of the tribe
[1:52:36] of Judah,
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; the lineage that would come down,
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; and if her husband won't have seed by
[1:52:44] her,
[1:52:46] that lineage will stop.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; That lineage will stop.
[1:52:55] That family, those sons refuse to have a
[1:52:58] child by you.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; IT'S HINGING JESUS CHRIST NATURAL
[1:53:05] LINEAGE IS HINGING ON YOUR TESTIMONY.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; It's hinging on your testimony.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; She knowing THE WORD AND REVEAL THAT
[1:53:17] REVELATION OF THE WORD.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; DRESSES AS A HARLOT. [screaming]
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HER FATHER-IN-LAW COMES
[1:53:27] THROUGH, SHE DRESSES A HARLOT AND BRINGS
[1:53:29] HIM IN.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; And he places his seed in her womb.
[1:53:42] And for payment, she took his staff
[1:53:46] and things that belong to him. Yeah.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; And so when he came back through and
[1:53:51] sent men back through, they said, "Find
[1:53:54] me the harlot."
[1:53:56] There was no harlot there.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; We don't have a harlot here.
[1:54:02] And then they found out that she was
[1:54:04] pregnant.
[1:54:06] SO THEY BROUGHT THE LAW UP.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; They brought THE LAW UP THAT SHE SHOULD
[1:54:12] BE STONED.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:16] And she came before her father-in-law
[1:54:19] and she told him what her revelation
[1:54:21] was. The seed had TO PASS THROUGH HER
[1:54:24] WOMB.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; And the man whose child it is
[1:54:31] belongs to these signets.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Notice his word said, "You're more
[1:54:38] righteous
[1:54:39] than I am.
[1:54:48] Thank you, Sister Sarah.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; For eternity shall be known.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; What about Rahab?
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; What about Esther?
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; What about Abidel? That was David's
[1:55:06] wife,
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; All of THESE PEOPLE ARE SO IMPORTANT.
[1:55:11] AMEN.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; GOD WATCHED OVER THEIR LIFE.
[1:55:18] [snorts]
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SEED THAT'S SO IMPORTANT.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, HOW IMPORTANT AM I TO GOD?
[1:55:28] THE SEED.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S not your flesh. It's the seed that
[1:55:33] he deposited
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world.
[1:55:39] HE PLACED A PART OF HIMSELF.
[1:55:55] [snorts]
[1:55:58] 1 Corinthians chapter 6.
[1:56:01] Do you know that the saints shall judge
[1:56:03] the world?
[1:56:07] Know ye not that ye shall judge angels?
[1:56:11] How much more things pertain to this
[1:56:13] life?
[1:56:15] The testing ground is here.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Can I give you one more test?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; You know the lady that grabbed a
[1:56:28] tambourine and danced?
[1:56:33] That was a victory that day, right?
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine 600,000 women dancing
[1:56:39] and what a dust storm that was?
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Their their enemy was floating
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; and dead.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; But she had a spot in her life.
[1:56:56] Amen.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to take the time to read
[1:57:00] it to you, but Marram Mariam
[1:57:04] came before Moses
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; and she began to say these words. You
[1:57:10] think you're the only holy man?
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; She had forgotten that he was more than
[1:57:17] her brother.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; She had forgotten he was more than just
[1:57:24] another man. HE WAS A PROPHET OF GOD.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; And the BIBLE SAYS, "TOUCH MY NIGHT
[1:57:32] ANOINTING AND DO MY PROPHETS no harm."
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; When you go to looking at flesh and
[1:57:38] making mistakes,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; you get in trouble.
[1:57:50] When she rebuked Moses,
[1:57:53] it kindled the anger of God
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; in so much that leprosy
[1:58:02] immediately struck her.
[1:58:14] Brother Ron, I don't see my critics
[1:58:15] getting nothing. I don't see them being
[1:58:17] retributed anything.
[1:58:21] You're looking at a clock, whether it's
[1:58:23] Timeox, Timex, or Bulliva. And God don't
[1:58:27] operate with this.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; My My critics just seem to get by with
[1:58:33] it. He don't operate with this. That's
[1:58:36] right.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; And it ain't your job to fight back.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; God takes your case.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; But God gave us an example here. She was
[1:58:48] struck with leprosy immediately.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; It kindled the anger of God.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; The camp of Israel did not move until
[1:59:01] this situation was settled. And they
[1:59:03] cast her out from the camp for seven
[1:59:05] days. That's
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; And it didn't move till she came back.
[1:59:09] Can you imagine what a lesson that was?
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; I want to just take just a couple more
[1:59:15] moments. Can you imagine the lessons in
[1:59:17] that home?
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't you touch God's
[1:59:23] anointing.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, you leave that message
[1:59:30] alone. You may not agree with it, but
[1:59:31] you leave that alone.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't don't you come
[1:59:36] against Are you with me now?
[1:59:40] [applause]
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; So, I told you last night, last weekend,
[1:59:51] how irritated we would be and do get
[1:59:57] when people attacked the prophet of the
[1:59:59] age. Right.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; You know, this is our our message.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; When people see things against the
[2:00:08] prophet of God,
[2:00:10] it irritates you, makes you sick.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:16] Now, it's your turn again.
[2:00:19] Brother Shannon, could you stand for me?
[2:00:24] [snorts]
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham's dead. Paul's
[2:00:27] dead. Peter's dead.
[2:00:30] Brother Frasier's dead.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to kind of make a frame right
[2:00:37] there.
[2:00:38] Yeah.
[2:00:40] So, we've got a picture of Shannon.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; We got a picture of Shannon.
[2:00:46] And I'm sure you got some critics
[2:00:48] because I've heard you tell me that
[2:00:50] people you work with.
[2:00:53] But what they don't realize, they're
[2:00:55] picking on a dead man.
[2:00:58] Amen.
[2:01:00] [applause]
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; It will do them no good.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Because it's sealed.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; It's settled. Amen.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; It's come to a spot to where their words
[2:01:23] has no effect
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN SAY, "I'M ONE OF THOSE
[2:01:28] converts that say, I'm resting on the
[2:01:31] message and it's already accepted.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; I'm just living out time."
[2:01:38] [applause]
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:48] Hallelujah.
[2:01:56] Okay.
[2:01:58] I need a chair.
[2:02:02] Thank you.
[2:02:13] All right, here you go. Well, since you
[2:02:15] brought it, won't you see it sitting
[2:02:17] here? [laughter]
[2:02:24] Can you bring me that picture off the
[2:02:25] wall?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's attached,
[2:02:29] but if we put it there, it can always
[2:02:30] come down.
[2:02:36] All right, I'm going to turn this just
[2:02:38] now. Not You can just hang right here
[2:02:40] with me.
[2:02:48] Okay,
[2:02:49] I'll let you do this, John.
[2:02:53] So, Brother Andrew,
[2:02:55] I know 100% you got crickets.
[2:03:02] So when people attack you, they really
[2:03:04] don't know what they're attacking
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; because you're also a dead man. And we
[2:03:09] heard about Daniel Greenfield. As he
[2:03:11] stood for me on earth, I'll stand for
[2:03:13] him in heaven.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; So I want to give you an illustration.
[2:03:18] When people are talking about you, what
[2:03:21] they're really doing,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; they're think they're attacking Andrew.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Man, my heart's going 100 miles an hour
[2:03:30] right now.
[2:03:32] Will you turn the picture?
[2:03:37] [applause]
[2:03:45] [applause]
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:54] [applause]
[2:03:56] Somebody take a picture of that.
[2:03:58] Somebody take a picture of that. I don't
[2:03:59] know. I know every one of you got a
[2:04:01] phone.
[2:04:15] So when you hear somebody attack Andrew,
[2:04:18] somehow you get a hold of this picture
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; and you tell them this is actually who
[2:04:25] you're attacking.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:04:36] [applause]
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's just your son. Okay, Carson,
[2:04:43] come here.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, I'm gonna need your
[2:04:50] seat.
[2:05:01] cursing God's dealing with you.
[2:05:04] You know that
[2:05:08] you'd make an incredible prog golfer.
[2:05:14] But God's got bigger plans than being a
[2:05:16] pro golfer.
[2:05:18] And I know you have critics even now.
[2:05:23] But why don't why don't you turn the
[2:05:24] picture around?
[2:05:35] [applause]
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:05:51] [snorts]
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "To him that overcometh
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; will I grant to sit with me
[2:06:05] in my throne."
[2:06:12] I know you have trials and you have
[2:06:15] tests.
[2:06:17] I'm not deaf and dumb.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; I know you do.
[2:06:22] But if I can say these words to you,
[2:06:25] it'll be worth it.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it after all.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it.
[2:06:38] When we're sitting there that day, I
[2:06:41] don't know quite how it's all going to
[2:06:42] be arranged.
[2:06:45] And we don't have to sit in the judgment
[2:06:51] to not have to walk up before those
[2:06:52] angry eyes
[2:06:59] to sit with him and it's already sealed.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; There'll be no question about eternal
[2:07:05] life.
[2:07:07] It's already sealed. It's already done.
[2:07:10] [sighs]
[2:07:13] It'll be worth it after all.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; After all,
[2:07:22] I'm not done. I'm just going to quit.
[2:07:26] I love you with all my heart.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; I love you. [applause]
[2:07:33] Could
[2:07:40] [applause]
[2:07:44] we stand?
[2:08:02] Maybe you don't know him today.
[2:08:13] Maybe you don't know him.
[2:08:19] You don't have to wait another day.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. You don't have to wait
[2:08:23] another day.
[2:08:26] There's nothing in this world worth
[2:08:28] staying here for.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; I want to be a Christian. Don't you?
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Maybe you say, "Brother Ron, I I've been
[2:08:38] sitting on the fence, maybe not making a
[2:08:41] full commitment,
[2:08:45] maybe every eye closed just for a
[2:08:46] moment, and you'd like to say, "Brother
[2:08:48] Ron, would you pray for me?
[2:08:51] Just pray for me. Thank
[2:08:54] you.
[2:08:56] Thank you.
[2:08:59] Thank you.
[2:09:00] Oh, my heart feels like it's busted.
[2:09:15] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:09:18] Hallelujah. [clears throat]
[2:09:26] Father,
[2:09:29] my father,
[2:09:33] Lord, you see every hand that was
[2:09:34] [music] raised today.
[2:09:42] May we search deep in our heart,
[2:09:50] Lord. Come and fill us, Lord Jesus, with
[2:09:52] [music] your presence,
[2:10:00] Lord. Anything that's wrong in our life
[2:10:05] like Daniel Greenfield,
[2:10:09] Father, any shortcoming,
[2:10:12] any mistake, God,
[2:10:15] I'm sorry.
[2:10:18] I'm so sorry, Father.
[2:10:22] I'm so sorry.
[2:10:25] Search the depths of my soul today.
[2:10:27] [music]
[2:10:32] Lord, touch your children.
[2:10:35] All that will even listen to this, Lord
[2:10:37] [music] God.
[2:10:40] Come minister to their lives today.
[2:10:43] May today [music] be a different day in
[2:10:45] their life.
[2:10:47] Help them, Lord Jesus.
[2:10:49] May they rise to walk in a newness of
[2:10:51] life. Touch their [music] life by the
[2:10:54] presence of God. We invite you. We
[2:10:58] invite you, Father,
[2:11:02] come touch our lives
[2:11:06] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[2:11:09] Bless you children. Bless you today. Why
[2:11:12] don't we just all raise our hands before
[2:11:14] him and worship the King of glory?
[2:11:32] I was carried to the [music] table.
[2:11:40] Oh, [music and singing] city right where
[2:11:43] I belong.
[2:11:46] [music]
[2:11:50] Oh, I was carried to the table.
[2:11:54] [music and singing]
[2:11:59] Oh, swept away [music and singing] by
[2:12:03] his love.
[2:12:13] And I don't feel my [music] brokenness
[2:12:17] anymore.
[2:12:22] When I'm [music and singing] seated at
[2:12:25] the table of the Lord,
[2:12:30] I was carried to the table. [music]
[2:12:38] Oh, [music and singing]
[2:12:40] the table of the Lord.
[2:12:54] [music]
[2:12:54] [singing]
[2:12:57] shattered by the fall.
[2:13:01] Oh, broken man, [singing]
[2:13:04] forgotten, [music]
[2:13:06] feeling lost and all alone.
[2:13:11] Oh, summoned by the king
[2:13:15] [music]
[2:13:16] into [singing] the master's course.
[2:13:21] Oh, lifted by the Savior [music]
[2:13:26] and cradled in his arms.
[2:13:31] [music]
[2:13:33] I was carried to the table.
[2:13:36] [music and singing]
[2:13:41] Oh, seated [music] right where I belong.
[2:13:53] who carried to [music] the table.
[2:14:01] Oh, swept [music] away by his love.
[2:14:06] [singing]
[2:14:11] Oh, and I don't feel my brokenness
[2:14:17] anymore. [music and singing]
[2:14:22] When I'm seated [music] at the table
[2:14:27] of the Lord,
[2:14:30] I was carry to [music] the table.
[2:14:38] Oh,
[2:14:40] the table [music]
[2:14:41] of the Lord. [singing]
[2:14:53] fighting thoughts of [music and singing]
[2:14:54] fear
[2:14:56] and wondering why he called my name.
[2:14:59] [music]
[2:15:01] Am I good enough [singing]
[2:15:04] to share this cup? This world has left
[2:15:09] me lame.
[2:15:11] [music]
[2:15:12] But even in my weakness,
[2:15:17] my savior [music] called my name.
[2:15:22] And in his holy presence,
[2:15:27] I'm healed [music] and unashamed.
[2:15:32] came.
[2:15:34] I was carried to [music and singing] the
[2:15:37] table.
[2:15:42] [music] Oh, seated right where I belong.
[2:15:52] I
[2:15:54] was carried to the table.
[2:16:02] Oh, swept away [music and singing] by
[2:16:06] his love.
[2:16:11] And I don't feel my brokenness [music]
[2:16:16] anymore.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; When I'm seated at the table of
[2:16:26] [singing] the Lord,
[2:16:29] I was carried to [music and singing] the
[2:16:32] table.
[2:16:39] [music] The table of the Lord.
[2:16:43] I want you to put that first part of
[2:16:45] that [music] verse up again.
[2:16:48] I heard this song. I I thought this is
[2:16:51] one of the most powerful songs that's
[2:16:52] [music] ever been written.
[2:16:54] Well, the original word says, "I was
[2:16:56] seated right where I don't belong."
[2:17:00] And I thought, there's something
[2:17:01] something wrong with that song. [music]
[2:17:04] And I just took that one word out of
[2:17:06] there, Lord.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Because to a lot of people, you
[2:17:10] shouldn't be sitting at the table. and
[2:17:13] according to your [music] choice and
[2:17:14] your decisions and the things in your
[2:17:17] life, you shouldn't be sitting at the
[2:17:18] table. But because God's election, he
[2:17:22] said, you're seated right where you
[2:17:24] belong at.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; You didn't get here on your own. You
[2:17:28] didn't get carried to the table by your
[2:17:30] own self. It was the master that put you
[2:17:34] right where you're sitting at. So don't
[2:17:37] you ever feel bad. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; I'M SITTING RIGHT WHERE I BELONG AT.
[2:17:43] Because election saw me. Before I COULD
[2:17:46] EVER MAKE A MISTAKE, BEFORE YOU COULD
[2:17:49] EVER FALL, BEFORE YOU COULD EVER BE BORN
[2:17:51] IN THE WRONG FAMILY, GOD'S ELECTION OF
[2:17:54] GRACE SAW YOU and set you RIGHT WHERE
[2:17:58] YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SITTING AT.
[2:18:01] HE PREPARED YOU, HALLELUJAH, [screaming]
[2:18:04] for a heavenly kingdom.
[2:18:11] Hallelujah.
[2:18:12] I want you to sing it like this. From
[2:18:15] the elected throne of God, from the
[2:18:17] throne of your heart, I want you to sing
[2:18:19] it with everything that's within you. I
[2:18:22] was carried to this table by the master
[2:18:26] that created the heavens and the earth.
[2:18:29] And I'm seated right where I belong at.
[2:18:32] HALLELUJAH. I GOT A TOKEN IN MY HAND. I
[2:18:35] GOT A TICKET THAT SAYS I'M WORTHY
[2:18:37] ENOUGH.
[2:18:39] And his blood says I'm able to shed
[2:18:41] right here.
[2:18:47] Oh, see you right where I belong.
[2:18:58] I was carried to the table. [music]
[2:19:04] Oh.
[2:19:07] Oh. Swept [music] away by his love.
[2:19:13] When I realize this. [music]
[2:19:17] Oh,
[2:19:19] and I don't feel my brokenness
[2:19:24] anymore.
[2:19:28] When I'm seated [music] at the table. of
[2:19:34] the Lord.
[2:19:36] I was carried [singing] to [music] the
[2:19:39] table.
[2:19:44] [music]
[2:19:47] The table of the Lord. [music]
[2:19:51] [singing]

[2:21:00] stray away, rejecting your love
[2:21:04] [singing]
[2:21:04] and warm [music] embrace.

[2:29:08] The room grew still
[2:29:11] [music] as she made her [singing] way to
[2:29:14] Jesus.
[2:29:16] She [music] stumbles through the tears
[2:29:19] that [singing] made her blind.
[2:29:27] She felt [singing] such [music] pain.
[2:29:30] Some spoken
[2:29:33] anger. [singing and music]
[2:29:35] Heard folks whisper there's no place for
[2:29:40] her [music and singing] kind.
[2:29:46] Still on she came
[2:29:50] through the [singing] shame that fleshed
[2:29:51] [music] her face
[2:29:54] until at last
[2:29:57] she knelt before his feet.
[2:30:00] [music and singing]
[2:30:05] Even [music] though she spoke no
[2:30:07] [singing] words,
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; everything she [music] said was heard
[2:30:14] as she poured her love for the master
[2:30:19] from her box of alabaster.
[2:30:26] I've [singing] come to pour
[2:30:32] my praise on [music and singing] him
[2:30:34] like oil
[2:30:37] from Mary [music]
[2:30:40] alabaster
[2:30:41] box.
[2:30:49] Don't [music and singing] be angry
[2:30:51] if I wash his feet with my tears.
[2:30:56] And I draw them with [music and singing]
[2:30:58] my hair.
[2:31:05] [music]
[2:31:07] You were there.
[2:31:12] The night [singing]
[2:31:13] he found me.
[2:31:17] You did not [music and singing] feel
[2:31:21] what I felt when he wrapped his loving
[2:31:25] arms [singing]
[2:31:26] around me.
[2:31:29] You don't know the [music] cost
[2:31:33] of the oil [singing]
[2:31:35] in my alabaster [music]
[2:31:38] box.
[2:31:48] I [music] can't forget
[2:31:53] the way [singing] life used to be.
[2:31:57] I was a prisoner
[2:32:00] to the [music] sin that had me bound.
[2:32:02] [singing]
[2:32:08] I [music] spent [singing] my days
[2:32:12] pour my life without measure
[2:32:17] into a little [music and singing] treure
[2:32:20] box I thought I found [singing]
[2:32:27] [music]
[2:32:28] until [singing] the day
[2:32:32] Jesus came to me
[2:32:37] and heal my soul with the wonders
[2:32:40] [music and singing]
[2:32:41] of his love.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; So [singing and music] now I'm giving
[2:32:48] back to him.
[2:32:51] All the [music and singing] praise he's
[2:32:53] worthy of.
[2:32:56] I've been forgiven [singing]
[2:32:58] and that's [music] why
[2:33:01] I love [singing]
[2:33:03] him so much.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; Lighthouse. I've come [singing]
[2:33:10] to pour
[2:33:14] my praise on him [music] like coyo
[2:33:17] [singing]
[2:33:20] from Mary's alabaster [singing]
[2:33:24] box.
[2:33:29] Don't [singing and music]
[2:33:30] be angry
[2:33:34] if I wash his feet with my tears.
[2:33:39] and draw [singing] them with [music] my
[2:33:42] hand.
[2:33:46] [music]
[2:33:49] You were there [singing]
[2:33:55] the night [music] he found [singing] me.
[2:34:00] You did not feel
[2:34:03] what [music] I felt [singing] when he
[2:34:05] wrapped his loving arms around me.
[2:34:10] [music]
[2:34:12] You don't know the cost
[2:34:16] of the oil [singing and music]
[2:34:18] in my alabaster
[2:34:21] box.
[2:34:55] Come on.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; I was just a shepherd boy
[2:35:09] without a shield, without a sword,
[2:35:13] fed up with the giant's [music] voice,
[2:35:16] screaming curses to the Lord.
[2:35:20] I walked down [singing] that hill alone
[2:35:23] with a pocket full of river stones. But
[2:35:27] what the Philistine couldn't see is what
[2:35:31] I have was [music and singing] more than
[2:35:34] see on my own. I'm weak. But my God
[2:35:39] fights for me. [music]
[2:35:49] I will serve to the king
[2:35:52] interpreting his crazy [music] dreams.
[2:35:56] I won't worship mortal men.
[2:35:59] So they threw me in a lion's
[2:36:01] [music and singing] den.
[2:36:03] Vicious teeth were all I saw. Just some
[2:36:07] [music] came and shut their jaws. You
[2:36:10] couldn't find a scratch on me.
[2:36:13] In fact, that night I fell asleep. When
[2:36:17] morning came, it shocked [music] them
[2:36:19] all. Cuz my God [screaming]
[2:36:22] hides for me. [music]
[2:36:24] [singing]
[2:36:26] Oh yes, he does.
[2:36:32] I stumbled into it to the roof
[2:36:35] with alabaster and [music] my wounds. I
[2:36:39] could feel their [singing] judging eyes
[2:36:42] as I knelt before the cry.
[2:36:46] I poured my oil upon his feet. I didn't
[2:36:50] care who saw me. [music]
[2:36:54] I gave him all I had that day. [singing]
[2:36:57] And he should have sent me [music] on my
[2:36:59] way. But instead, he lifted up my head.
[2:37:04] Cuz my [music] God [singing] fights for
[2:37:08] me.
[2:37:14] He's my shield. [music]
[2:37:18] He's my strength.
[2:37:20] [singing]
[2:37:22] The [music] victory
[2:37:24] is [singing] the Lord.
