their time so about 12 o'clock our time today and and you can go back and archive that if you so choose to do so but as it comes this time of year it's it's a part of the year that i always hated as a child it was time that summer was over and school was starting back up but i tell you i garnered a lot of things throughout those years and uh and so at this time we'd like to would like to some good

and and the lunch ladies the guidance counselor substitute teachers and everybody involved grandparents as their child's going to the kindergarten for the very first time and so we before they before everyone comes i i'd like to read this this passage of scripture this morning before we have all of you come and we'll pray together this morning if you could put up psalms 91 it is a scripture of protection and we pray this this prayer over our children psalms 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the error that flight by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands unlest thou dash thy foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shall thou trample under their feet because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him and i will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer him and i will be with him in trouble and i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation maybe as all the children and their parents and and all of the workers of the community if you wouldn't mind coming and we pray together this morning [Music] in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to jesus [Music] what a powerful group of young people we have amen we just thank the lord for each and every one of you let's just bow our hearts together this this morning amen heavenly father lord you see your people this morning lord we don't do this out of a way of tradition but father we bring them before the altar lord you see each and every household that is represented here father you see the

falling in love with jesus [Music] falling in love with jesus [Music] falling in love with jesus was the best thing i've ever ever done falling in love [Music] falling in love we're jesus falling in love with jesus falling in love with jesus was the best thing i i ever done in his arms oh in his arms i feel protected in his arms never disconnected [Laughter] oh in his arms i feel protected there's no place i'd rather rather be [Music] hallelujah truly there's no place that we'd rather be this morning amen if you have your bibles we'd like to look over in the book of numbers chapter 13 and verse 30 and then also in the last book of the bible in revelation chapter 10 and verse 7. numbers chapter 13 and verse 30. amen and as you're finding your way there this morning let's just speak to the author of the word heavenly father lord one more time we bow before you lord and we yield ourselves completely to you and submit ourselves therefore unto you lord that you would have the preeminence in this service i pray that you'd bless every person here that has represented every home i pray as we yield ourselves to you that you would have your will on your way in this service bless the reading of the word lord and anoint us to catch lord the things that you once said this morning we bless your holy name just now amen numbers chapter 13 and verse 30 and caleb still the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it and as you turn into revelations chapter 10 and verse 7 and the world is again falling apart he said let me tell you what we need today is the word of god anointed for this age that will bring forth the power of the holy ghost again this morning i'd like to speak to you on an anointed to take it anointed to take it revelations chapter 10 and verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings may god bless his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord as we said we'd like to speak to you on anointed to take it and i'll ask you just to have your your your spiritual thinking cap on this morning as we go through these things but we know that that god throughout his word has laced it through there that god was going to have a people and he would have a church that would be a spotless church that would be a church that was called after his namesake and and we know that god is going to god is going to make sure that she comes out exactly the way that he has destined her to be and she is anointed for this hour for the challenge of the hour to make to to make sure that this word gets through and we're very acquainted as message believers with with the reading of revelations chapter 10 but we realize that that the book of revelation is is is in symbols and we see that here we look in revelations chapter 10 it's a continuation over from revelations chapter 9 and the bible said and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven and we realize that that was none other than our lord jesus christ and we see that john here throughout the book of revelations that john is a type of the bride to go unto the angel and to take the book out of the hand of the angel now now so you understand that that he is taking that out of the hand of the mighty angel that has given that revelation but this church that god is building you see he come to build himself a body that could that could be called by his name that would carry his characteristics and his identification that she would be connected with the headship of christ and god is going to have a church amen god is going to have a church and brother branham said that she would be a token to the world and so if we go to looking at this word to to go in and to take the book if you look at that word in the greek it is lambeno which which we see it means to receive to take it means to have or to catch or to take or to take with the hand to lay hold of to take up of a thing to be carried up upon oneself to claim to procure for oneself and so john here is a type of you is that right this morning john is a type of you going and to procure the the open book that has been opened which you look over and you see just a few chapters before it was a closed book but now john is going and taking that little book which is open and that word lambeno can also be found throughout the bible in john chapter one and eleven he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as a lambano as many as took him as many as caught him as many as lay hold on him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name and if you have been given a spiritual fortitude or the ability to reach out and to grab ahold of the revelation of this hour you have to say like john said that a man cannot receive these things except it comes from heaven jesus said that no man cometh unto the father unto me except the father draws him it's god that is doing this and and jesus said that i come in my father's name and ye me not you received me not you didn't take me and to think that here was the person or the author of life that was standing before the church of the day but yet where he was standing in in his full stature standing in his godhead standing there as the righteous one but yet they would not take of him who was the author of life and he said how can you believe which receive honor how can you receive honor one of honor and another and seek not the honor that cometh from god only so here we look that god has if you've been able to look into these things if you've been able to look in and to see who he is you're a blessed people this morning can you identify that you're a blessed people this morning you see there there's many there's been many churches many ages there's been many a people that have desired to look upon these things but only the elect and the chosen of god are anointed or anointed to receive this word that will take them out of this layout of cnh and we realize when the prophet would preach the anointed ones of the end time that there he was laying out that there was going to be false christs not false jesus's but there would be false anointed ones that would rise up in this hour and the bible said that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible oh aren't you glad this morning that it ain't impossible to deceive the very elect of god but yet you look in there and you'll find that that there are men just like you built like you women and women and men that serve god and love god but yet they're anointed and you watch that that brother branham would go in there and he would pull out that there are anointed ones there he said he said you look at that vulture he said it's anointed to fly also just like that eagle is anointed to fly but that eagle is built to go up there and that vulture can follow it so here it is in the natural that there only a heavenly bird can go up there only a heavenly bird can reach onto this level that you're called unto and i want this word to be to you today that you are anointed by the holy ghost to go where nobody else can go when you look over in matthew chapter 25 and you see there's ten virgins there but you're not a part of the fullest virgin because the holy ghost is what makes the difference between the wise and the fullest you see what made them wise was the oil which represents the holy ghost and you see when midnight came there went out a cry that the bridegroom coming and when the fullest looked out and they realized they didn't have no lamp in their oil they said give us some of that so that we might have it for ourself and they said go and buy from those that sell it but they were too late for the time had passed by their way but you were ordained and anointed before the foundation of the world to receive this baptism of the holy ghost i'm not just talking about a restoration of the gifts or an anointing that comes on your flesh but an anointing that'll take you out of this world an anointing that'll make you live right an anointing will make you that'll make you amen every single words of the word of god this word will put you where god has destined you to be many's desire to look on it but blessed are your eyes [Applause] but blessed are your eyes for you see many have heard this word but they rejected it but don't you look at david as the rejected king he's still anointed this morning there's a lot of people that reject the king of kings but i want you to know even though you can reject david he's still the anointed king that'll come out and he will whip the goliath hallelujah the anointing of the holy ghost that was poured upon david by the prophet samuel when he took that anointing all he poured it all on him just like when you get baptized we don't sprinkle you but we bury you in the name of the lord jesus christ in whom there is remission of sins and when the high priest would walk into the hole as a holiest they poured all of the anointing oil upon him which is a type of being baptized with the holy ghost and when god decides to give you the holy ghost he don't halfway give it to you he don't just give it to you so you can live light on right on the weekend but he gives it to you so that you can walk through laodicea unharmed untouched living and overcoming life filled with the baptism of the holy ghost where men can't walk but you're walking there because you're anointed for the hour there's been churches churches bride's brides but there's got to come one hallelujah there's got to come a real bribe there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it that makes the church live more in the power of his resurrection you see before the foundation of the world you were seen with him and when you look over in revelations chapter 5 and 5 and you'll see that the elders spoke unto john when john was weeping because there was no one found in heaven and no one found an earth that was worthy but there came a voice and said we not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof don't weep little bride he's not going to leave you down here unforsaken he's not going to leave you down here in this chaos of life don't weep little bride the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed he has overcome death has been stricken away he prevailed over death and when you look over there in revelations chapter 5 you're not seeing you're not seeing a dead lamb you're seeing a bloody lamb that had been in battle one that had been fighting for you that had been paying the price for your sin one that had been wounded in the battle but i want to remind you that lamb was not dead in revelations 21 and 18 he said behold i am he that was dead and i am alive forevermore hallelujah he wasn't dead but he was very much alive and he stood up to take all of the redemption rights which had your name on it and i want to say this to the church of the living god he's still fighting your battles the blood's still on the throne and he says i'm worthy i'm worthy for ron spencer i'm worthy for harold shiftly i'm worthy for jim babb i'm worthy for randy hinkle i'm worthy for the pruitt family i'm worthy for any cause i am the lamb i'm strong enough to finish all of redemption's plans i am the one the maker of heaven and earth i am alpha i am omega i am he that was which is and which is to come and he is the one that redeemed us back where'd you come from in the beginning hallelujah i was with god in the beginning i was in his mind we don't believe in the pre-existing of souls but we believe that we were with him before the foundation of the world and he redeemed us back and he took the title deed of redemption and redemption of all of that legal's possession to all the lost means that everything that adam and eve lost you have what that ought to do to a born again son and daughter of god to realize this morning that everything that adam lost you hold in your possession this morning its legal possession to the abstract title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything everything that adam and eve lost the possession of that deed when adam could not meet the requirements of a redemption after he'd found that he lost it and he'd sinned and he separated himself from god and was on this side of the chasm so he could not redeem it he could he just couldn't do it because he he needed redemption himself so he could not do it you know on the other side of 1963 brother branham said that there was a gap there there there was a there was a chasm there but i want you to know on the other side of 1963 he said he said they that the blood removed that gap it removed that chasm that separation the blood of jesus christ made a way we're not probing this morning we're not presuming this morning we're not guessing this morning we know what we have in our hand we know who we are we know what we've been born to do moses what's in your hand it's not just some ordinary rod that you're holding in your hand cast it down moses and moses got scared and walked away from it but the voice of the lord said pick it up by the tail and when he took it up by the tail it became a rod again just like when jesus was there on the cross he grabbed a hold of the serpent he took it and it was a sign that sin had been judged once and for all little bride of jesus christ what is in your hand it's the most powerful weapon that's ever been placed in the hand of humanity it is the word of almighty god and when you take a hold of this word it'll shut down all of pharaoh's magic [Music] your your rod will swallow pharaoh's rod i want you to know in your hand is not just some weak sword it's the king's sword not a king but the king you watch when you take out take a hold of that shield and take a hold of that sword well with faith you watch what'll take place as a son and daughter of god you can cut cancer loose as a son and daughter of god you got every right to move the complexes of life off of you as a son and daughter of god you've got every ability to speak to the mountain in your life and say mountain be moved hallelujah now satan's got a right to tell you that you're a liar satan's got a right to tell you you're not worthy he's got a right to tell you that you'll never get well he's got a right but the lamb's got a right this morning he's got a right to tell you that you were his before the foundation of the world he's got a right to say i healed you 2 000 years ago he's got a right to say i know you're going to make it through it hallelujah what the first adam lost the second adam came and gave back to you look at your neighbor and say i got it you're anointed to handle this you're anointed for it anybody can quote this scripture anybody can take it but the anointing is what makes the difference there's been a lot of people that were that were bogus dollars that come in and tried to do the same thing that you're doing but because there was no oil there they couldn't live it they couldn't make it manifest but there's a seed that's laying there there's a seed that's laying there with a promise hanging over top of it that it's going to be made manifest just like when when the disciples were up there on the day of pentecost and god had jesus had told them 10 days before go up there in jerusalem and wait for the promise of power to come upon you now they had that seed they had that promise in seed form but what were they doing up there they were up there thinking and praising god for it all the time before they ever got it before they ever got it they were thanking god for the holy ghost let me bring it down to your level before they seen healing they were thanking him for it before they seen the signs of the rapture they were thanking him for it are you with me before you seen your loved one walked through the door you were thanking them for it they had it in seed form but when the manifestation came it was no longer a seed it was an oak tree it was the holy ghost [Applause] they didn't have to say well jesus said this and jesus said that they could stand there and speak over the man at the beautiful gate and said thus saith the lord take up thy bed and walk he had a lot of people walk past his way but there's come by somebody there comes somebody that was anointed to do so there was a preacher come by my way one time and he laid his hands on me it wasn't his hands but it was the anointing of the word that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover [Applause] they shall take up serpents they shall drink in a deadly thing and it shall not harm there because of the anointing of it in the invisible union he said we we know that the modern church in its present condition and its present state is in no condition to finish to finish up the great commission that god gave the church for this day he said now we know that the church could not the pentecostal church by no means by no means could carry out the last day message in its present condition it's going to be an elected people that's elected for it and here we are here we are if you identify yourself right there go ahead and raise your hand and here we are and we're standing here not with a closed book but we're standing here with an open book with a clear title deed to the redemption to all of redemption it's standing in your hand and when when you look at this when you look at this in the light of the revelation of the word of the hour and you realize that you're not standing there with a closed book but you're standing there with an open book to every promise all the benefits all the blessings it comes to you in a whole new life and you can say like paul said what shall we say to these things if god before us then who can be against us hear of god little children and have overcame him because greater is he that is in you you can't read you can read that with a closed book but it don't mean as much to you but with an open book you know who you are [Applause] and ain't a devil in hell can stop a child of god when they know where they're standing at in the light of that revelation you can say no weapon that's formed against me shall prosper in the light of that revelation you can look at it and you can see healing you can see redemption you can see salvation [Applause] lord give me strength it ain't a closed book all the loose ends have been tied back together and all the denominational barriers that had held the word of god bound that had held the holy spirit bound to the river euphrates was broke off of it and all the powers of the theological men of the day that were against the word and against the move of god have been struck off what are you saying brother angel you're free to worship him this morning you're free to serve him this morning in spirit and in truth what am i saying to you you can take this book and you can overcome all of laodicea not just part of it but every single bit of it it has been struck off by the lamb hallelujah looking through those eyeglasses looking through those eyeglasses you can see that you're a part of the vision looking through those eyeglasses you can look over there and say that we in our offspring will be there with us looking through those eyeglasses we could say we're more than able to overcome this thing there's a lot of people that want to rise up and say we're not going to have it they want to try to deny the move of god and shut down the holy ghost and shut it down for young people but there's a lamb that's standing up hallelujah the lamb didn't just open up the seals so that you could become another group or another church where you can tack on your name the message of the hour he didn't do that he'd come to reveal to you the unwritten word to give your rapture in faith to set your soul fly and realize that you are the people of revelations 10 that go and take the book oh somebody praise [Applause] hallelujah christ the mystery said in there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his god-hit deity through his church having the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with that word what eve turned down he comes back and we accept it hallelujah what eve rejected what eve turned down you're anointed and predestinated when she listened to the lie of the devil you're anointed to let not listen to it you're anointed to turn him down you're anointed to refuse all of those rattle snakes that he's trying to give to you it's laying right there your anointing to turn it down you're anointed to not believe his lie you're anointed to accept this message church of the living god there's something that's running through this building this morning it's running through my soul this run this morning it's running through my spirit that which is running through my soul and through this building will conquer all of hell it'll conquer all sin that which is running through this building will heal your body he's running after you he's pushing his way this morning hallelujah it's running oh lord overtake me overtake me lord run right past me pentecostals had revival after revival they built school on top of school they've had theologians on top of theologians and they would love to have what you have this morning man they got power but they don't know who they are man they can they can they can spout off you don't get it you don't get in no debate with a pat with a pentecost or a baptist they'll put you in your place they know the scripture like the back of their head but there's no anointing but you could take a little housewife that's sitting here you could take a little housewife and stack them up against the biggest theologians in this day that ain't got to answer power you can take that little housewife maybe that little grandma and you can stack her up right there beside her because of the anointing that's upon her life she can shut down the mouths of theologians take no thought what you're saying for today or for tomorrow the holy spirit will put it there i'll stack any of my grandmas i'll stack any of these housewives up against any church any denomination because the anointing of the holy ghost has said that he would be here he will not leave you he will not forsake you our little children know more about serpent seed than all the scientists do in all the world they're looking for a missing link but these little children can tell you where it's at everything has been tied back together we got what they need hallelujah hallelujah there's a bunch of spies that went out with you it went out with you joshua they went out with you caleb and they said we weren't big enough they said we weren't strong enough but the bible has said to our father abraham that that was our land and there's a lot of people that's trying to keep you off the holy ghost they've tried to keep you off the revelation of the seven seals and the revelation of the church ages because they they're scared of it but i want to tell you church of the living god don't you be don't you dare be scared of this mystery of the seven seals it's got your redemption laying in it you can look throughout the libraries you can look throughout congress there ain't another book in all the libraries that can stack up to the revelation of the seven seals because it's thus saith the lord you better be careful

declared that that's my land he's declared that that's my holy ghost he's declared that that healing is my the lamb declared that that salvation was mine the lamb declared that miracles were mine the lamb declared that signs and wonders were my the land of the holy ghost says you can have a right mind you won't have to be bottled up with all kinds of psychology and psychotic things you can be let loose in the holy ghost the lamb has declared that you are free and whom the son is set free [Applause] let me cut one more devil off while i'm right here before i move on you are free from every denominational chain of hell that's tried to hold you back you are free from every religious spirit that tries to tell you that you can worship god any way you want to love anything you want to do anything you want to you can be free from that thing because the lamb has said that you're free but you've got to be willing to let loose of that religious spirit let loose of that fact let loose of it he let loose of the holy ghost so you can let loose of yourself [Applause] got a jealous spirit let loose to that thing the holy ghost is here to set you free got a spirit of bitterness he'll set you free from that you got a spirit of fussing spirit of criticizing let me go ahead and get one more spirit of a coward always running for cover always looking for church to church trying to find the right one if you get born again you'd stop running like a coward and man up the lamb that said that this is your land [Applause] i'm not willing to anything any spirit any demon any tactic of the devil keep me off of my land it's mine elbow your neighbor and say it's mine easy with them elbows gate don't hurt her it's mine oh it's mine oh my my my what a thrill to serve my jesus hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord genesis 12 turn with me as we move on now you know who you are now let's go through this land hallelujah now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from my father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make thee of a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing oh hallelujah i'm blessed when i come in and i'm blessed when i go out i have heard a word of the lord said i'm gonna make you a blessing oh my i'm gonna make you a blessing i'm gonna make you a blessing i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna bless you i will bless them that bless you and i will curse them that curse you don't touch god's anointed don't touch this holy ghost don't curse me don't curse this move don't curse this church bless this church i'm gonna make you a blessing for the gospel lighthouse i'm gonna hang a promise over top of you i'm gonna make you the head i'm not gonna make you the tail i put you above i'll put you above and not beneath i bless you in your storehouses i bless your baskets i'm gonna be blessed when i get in this land there's a door it's been open to you when you walk in there get ready that's my word to you this morning get ready walk in this door walk in this land walk in where the holy ghost is at go ahead and take a few steps joshua it's your land your father abraham had been promised that it was going to be his land and here it was 420 years since god had spoken a word to noah 420 years but god seen a righteous man by the name of abram he would be the one that he was going to bless and carried out and he said abram you got to get out of this land you got to get out of this land to come over here where you belong at what abraham had to do is he had to cut all of his associations and all of his friends and all of his tithes to come out of that land to go into the land that you that he was destined to be in and god told him that and god's telling you that you've got to separate yourself from your father and your mother you've got to separate yourself you know brother branham said that abraham's father was nothing but a fi but i but i fly in his soup and a hair and a biscuit all of his life and he had to separate from that thing there's people that'll bring you down and shut you down and try to tell you that that's for days gone by you've got to separate yourself and be like abraham and far follow the one that's leading you and speaking to you where abraham was walking into a land of the unseen he never seen it before but yet it's out in front of him he was seeking a builder he was seeking a kingdom whose builder and maker was god and then over in genesis chapter 22 a few a few chapters later after abraham had laid isaac down he laid everything down all of the promise that had been put out before him you got to be willing to put everything even though it just gave it to you that you waited for it all your life you got to be willing to lay it down before you can really be a blessing you got to lay everything down you can learn that the hard way or you can go the easy way you gotta learn to lay everything down my life is in his hands but after abraham had laid isaac down here god declares himself as jehovah jireh that hear the god who sees and the god that provides saying that in verse 17 that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and my seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and paul said that if you are children of god by by faith in christ jesus and galatians 3 that as many as you have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there's neither bond nor free there's neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus and if you be christ verse 29 then are you abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise i'll just let that sink in just for a moment i am an heir with god i am a joint heir with all of heaven and jesus said that all power in heaven and in earth is given unto me and as god had spoken to abraham that thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy and i want you to know that samson when he looked at that scripture he looked at it as more than just a literal scripture but he took it as himself being circumcised being raised up to destroy the philistines he went up there when he went up there with that woman and they had him all walled in and the philistines had had they had got him and they gave us him completely around and they said we got him all fenced in and sampson rolled back his shoulders and he looked back and he seen those seven locks on his head and he said hey i'm circumcised and i've got the anointing covenant upon me and he didn't cry and say what am i gonna do now but he literally walked up there to the strongest part of that city and grabbed a hold of the gates of gaza and took him all the way up tons of weight upon him because he read that scripture that thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy he didn't cry about it he didn't get shook up about it but he just simply rode right under the anointing he rode right underneath that anointing that anointing came he didn't just anoint him but anointed a jawbone he'll take what you got and he'll make it blessed he'll take what you got and he'll make it sure he'll take what you got and he'll make you come out the way he destined it to come out ain't no need of you rolling back and getting scared and running for cover samson all he did he knew that that anointed gift of power could destroy any philistine that would ever stand before him any philistine that would ever stand before him he took that anointing and he destroyed it it's not an if you shall possess but it is you will possess the gate of the enemy and you will take rightful ownership over that enemy's gates and you'll do with them as you please what gate's been stacked up against you [Music] have church this morning what gate's been stacked up against you walk out there and take the enemy's gates in the church of the living god this morning lays the power to heal all sickness in the church of the living god lays the power to overcome all temptation in the possession of the church of the living god this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the holy ghost in the church of jesus christ whatsoever you desire ask in my name and it shall be given unto you jesus said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it all the hell strategies all the hell's demons all of its cancers all the powers of darkness will not be able to overcome you but you will overcome it if you're in the worst of battles you're going to pick the best that you got to go out and fight and there's no truer representation of a country than them that which are sent out to fight for the land if you're coming up against iraq you send out the best if you're coming out up against russia you send out the best and when god was coming up against laodicea he sent out the bride that's a final voice to the final age that's more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think according to the power that worketh in you you have a representation by predestination the anointing of god will destroy cancer the anointing of god will destroy fear it'll bring joy back in your life this promise has got your name on it it's got your name on it jesus said whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you shall receive them as i said last night there's a lot of people getting on they get numb and praying they get numb and asking they get numb and receiving and they never can receive what's truly theirs because they give up on the promise a lot of people get tired of getting let down they feel like they've been been rejected they feel like their their prayers are just hitting the ceiling and falling right back down you have got to break past that thing so i want to say this to you god has never let you down you're the only one that can ever let you down in the spiritual walk you're the only one that can ever let you down in the promises of god god is there to make sure it comes to pass god ain't gave up on you god didn't give up on your healing god didn't give up on that need god's gonna make it sure god's gonna make it come to pass it's got your name on it say yeah that promise got my name on it
