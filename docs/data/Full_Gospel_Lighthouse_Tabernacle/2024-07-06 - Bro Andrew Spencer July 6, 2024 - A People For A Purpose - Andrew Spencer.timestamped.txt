[42:28] and then also down to First Peter
[42:31] chapter 2 and verse 9 about nine there
[42:34] about nine books apart there in the New
[42:37] Testament man Galatians chapter 3 and
[42:39] verse 24 and I'd like to just stay in
[42:42] that same vein of thought as we were uh
[42:45] last weekend and the weekend before that
[42:48] but if I would title this tonight I I'd
[42:51] like to title it a people for a purpose
[42:54] a people for a purpose the the ible says
[42:57] here wherefore the law was our school
[43:01] Master to bring us unto Christ that we
[43:03] might be justified by faith but after
[43:06] that faith has come we are no longer
[43:08] under a school
[43:10] Master for you are all the children of
[43:12] God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many
[43:16] of you as have been baptized into Christ
[43:19] have put on Christ there is neither Jew
[43:22] nor Greek there's neither Bond nor free
[43:24] there is neither male nor female for you
[43:27] are all one in Christ Jesus I love the
[43:31] scriptures because we realize how we
[43:34] become one that by one Spirit we are all
[43:37] baptized into the body of Jesus Christ
[43:39] it doesn't matter what your background
[43:41] is it doesn't matter what what what
[43:43] genealogy Reign that you came from that
[43:46] we are all one in Christ Jesus and you
[43:49] be Christ and if you be Christ then are
[43:52] you Abraham's seed and HS according to
[43:55] the promise and all so down to 1 Peter
[43:58] chapter 2 and verse
[44:02] 9 and the Bible says here but you are a
[44:05] chosen
[44:07] generation a royal priesthood and holy
[44:11] nation A peculiar people that you should
[44:14] show forth the Praises of him who hath
[44:18] called you out of Darkness Into His
[44:20] Marvelous Light which in times past were
[44:23] not a people but are now the people of
[44:26] God which had not obtained Mercy but now
[44:30] have obtained Mercy I love the
[44:33] scriptures now I I've I've sent this to
[44:36] the the upstairs here tonight and I'd
[44:39] like to just maybe just cast your view
[44:41] here to the original
[44:43] diaglot what the what the Bible it
[44:45] spells out for us here in 1 Peter 2:9
[44:49] but the original diaglot says but you
[44:51] are a chosen race a royal priesthood a
[44:55] holy nation a people for a purpose that
[44:59] you may be May declare the Perfections
[45:02] of him who called you from Darkness into
[45:06] his wonderful light we're not here to
[45:08] declare how perfect we are but we are
[45:10] here to declare the Perfections of him
[45:13] who called us from Darkness into his
[45:16] wonderful light who once were not a
[45:20] people but now are God's people you
[45:24] wouldn't even considered in the picture
[45:26] under the under the Jud judicial law you
[45:29] wasn't even in the picture but you are
[45:32] now God's people who had not obtained
[45:35] Mercy but now have obtained Mercy may
[45:39] God bless his word you may be seated
[45:41] here in the presence of the Lord as we
[45:43] stated it we'd like to just speak to you
[45:45] from this thought a people for a purpose
[45:48] a people for a purpose and I believe
[45:50] that the word of God that the word of
[45:53] God I believe it with all that is within
[45:55] me I believe that it is unchanging in
[45:57] all of its ways that it is infinite it
[46:00] is it is infallible it is the almighty
[46:03] God in written form but I believe that
[46:05] that what we have in this generation is
[46:08] is more than just a written word but I
[46:10] believe that the spirit of God is here
[46:12] to manifest what is laying there laying
[46:16] there in the scripture because the
[46:17] scripture teaches us that the letter kth
[46:20] but the but the the the letter kth but
[46:22] the spirit gives life and we realize
[46:25] that that that what we are being being
[46:27] led by is none other than the influence
[46:30] of the Holy Ghost that is leading that
[46:32] is leading his children by by the spirit
[46:36] of almighty God and I think it's a
[46:37] powerful thing to recognize that God has
[46:40] led us here led us here under under this
[46:44] powerful message you begin to think
[46:45] about when brother Brandon would talk
[46:47] about that little bitty boy that was
[46:48] following his child he was following his
[46:51] child and and and or the child was
[46:53] following the father excuse me and he
[46:54] was following following the father there
[46:56] and he he was just staggering back and
[46:58] forth in the snow and he was going back
[47:00] and forth and and and the the the daddy
[47:03] looked back and he said son what are you
[47:04] doing he said well I'm just he said I'm
[47:06] following you Daddy I'm stepping in your
[47:08] footsteps you see and the daddy was was
[47:11] a drunk and he was walking down the
[47:12] street and he realized that what he was
[47:14] doing was influencing was influencing
[47:18] himself he he was influencing that
[47:21] little child and we realize that the
[47:22] father has has influenced us by the
[47:25] preaching of the word by the restored
[47:28] word that we realize that in this
[47:29] generation that there is a a body of
[47:32] Believers that have come under Harmony
[47:34] under the same mind that was in almighty
[47:37] God I I just want to just stop right
[47:40] here for a minute and I I was kind of I
[47:42] was kind of waiting for them but they
[47:44] just comed in and I I would like to wish
[47:46] our sister Sevilla a very happy birthday
[47:49] today God richly bless you God richly
[47:53] bless you
[47:57] brother Melvin brother Melvin called me
[48:00] before church and he he told me that he
[48:03] told me that she uh today was her
[48:05] birthday and they wanted to celebrate by
[48:07] coming to church and I I tell you what I
[48:11] cried for about an hour and a half in my
[48:13] study and I that's a great way to
[48:16] celebrate your birthday so you you make
[48:18] sure you see my my wife down there after
[48:21] after church if you don't mind if youve
[48:22] never met her that's the best part of my
[48:25] life right there and uh so but let me
[48:28] just let me just move on brother
[48:29] brandham said brother brandham said in
[48:31] in the absolute he said he had a purpose
[48:34] in Saving me he said there was millions
[48:36] in sin when I come to him but he saved
[48:39] me he had a purpose in doing so I think
[48:42] it's powerful when you begin to
[48:44] recognize that God had a purpose in
[48:46] Saving you again and and I know my
[48:49] redeemer lives he said he said and God
[48:51] did not have to just make a tree just to
[48:53] make a tree just to just to be a tree he
[48:56] made a tree free for a purpose you see
[48:59] and God did not make you and I just to
[49:00] see if he could do it he made us for a
[49:03] purpose therefore there is a purpose of
[49:06] all of us being here you're not here
[49:08] just to be n made to just you're not
[49:11] here just to be another human being but
[49:13] you are here because that God made you
[49:16] for some purpose and I think it's when
[49:18] when young people when when men and all
[49:20] men of all ages when they begin to find
[49:23] what their purpose of God is in their
[49:25] life I I think it's it's one of the most
[49:28] grandest thing when you watch somebody
[49:30] that has staggered around in nonsense of
[49:32] life trying to find their way and trying
[49:34] to find their way through life but when
[49:36] they find their purpose they they get
[49:38] stabled out when men when the men bounce
[49:41] back and forth between callings and and
[49:43] Zeal and between what they're thinking
[49:45] and what God is thinking you it's it's
[49:48] powerful when somebody finds a very
[49:50] purpose of God and I I would like to
[49:52] just pose you a couple questions just
[49:53] for a minute what gets you up in the
[49:55] morning
[49:57] what gets you motivated in the morning
[49:59] like literally I'm not just talking
[50:00] about just because not just just gets
[50:03] you up but I'm talking about what makes
[50:04] you get up what is on the backside of
[50:07] your story that makes you makes you
[50:09] motivated to find the very mind of God
[50:11] and find the and to fulfill the purpose
[50:14] and the promises of God and if you can
[50:16] find that if you'll ever find what
[50:19] motivates you to get up and to fulfill
[50:21] God's promises I promise you that you'll
[50:23] be successful in spite of anything that
[50:26] the devil can put on you what motivates
[50:29] you to become a better Christian what
[50:31] motivates you to read your Bible what
[50:33] motivates you to to fulfill God's
[50:35] promise brother mandam said give me a
[50:37] Christian give me a housewife give me a
[50:39] preacher give me a custodian give me
[50:42] anybody that will put God first in
[50:44] everything and I'll show you somebody
[50:46] that'll be successful in spite of all
[50:48] that the devil puts upon them it doesn't
[50:51] matter what he puts on you but as long
[50:53] as you're seeking God first if you're
[50:55] seeking his mind if you're seeking his
[50:57] will if you're seeking his mindset I'll
[51:00] say this I can never be the same Andrew
[51:02] Spencer when the message came by my way
[51:06] when the message came by my way I can
[51:08] never go back to being the old Andrew
[51:10] Spencer I can never go back to those
[51:12] things I I remember when I gave my heart
[51:15] to the Lord I remember the day it
[51:16] happened I remember where I was standing
[51:19] at on the streets of Victoria and I can
[51:21] go back and I can point you to the
[51:23] moment that I was there and I can point
[51:25] you to the T that I changed brother Tom
[51:28] Ray he he he he he was there he led me
[51:31] to the Lord right there on the streets
[51:32] of Victoria he took me back to
[51:34] Cloverdale and he gave me he gave me a
[51:37] iPod and he downloaded all the message
[51:39] and anything that was anything that was
[51:41] included in the message he he put it on
[51:43] that iPod and I I listened to that iPod
[51:45] I listen to it over and over and over
[51:47] again until I broke it I I cut my teeth
[51:49] on this message I I cut my teeth on the
[51:52] church ages book I I listen to this
[51:54] message over and over and over and over
[51:57] again I can never be the same Andrew
[51:59] Spencer when the message came by my way
[52:03] it changed everything that I was he had
[52:05] a purpose in Saving me he had a purpose
[52:08] in Saving you and he had something
[52:13] Hallelujah I went out to dinner last
[52:15] night with our brother Don Milsap and
[52:17] his mom s sister Milsap here and they I
[52:20] was I tell you what they did me a real
[52:22] good blessing they brought me they
[52:24] brought me some Georgia peaches and they
[52:26] told me I could share them with some
[52:27] people so I gave I gave some to my wife
[52:29] and and
[52:31] uh I tell you they B they bless me real
[52:35] good they blessed me real good but I I
[52:37] was talking to her about when she come
[52:39] to the message she been in she's been in
[52:41] O in the message close to over 50 years
[52:43] now and to think about that some of our
[52:46] some of our generation is here that
[52:48] we've been living in under the offices
[52:50] of the message of the hour for over over
[52:53] the better part of all of our life that
[52:55] we've been sitting here I think what a
[52:57] wonderful way to spend your life Liv in
[53:00] the message believe in the message no
[53:02] matter what came up no matter what came
[53:04] down no matter what trials came you
[53:07] stood for the message I tell you church
[53:09] this message moves me this message moves
[53:13] me because I realize that there is a
[53:16] people on the Earth today that is
[53:18] literally fulfilling the prophecy of
[53:21] what William brandham saw it moves me to
[53:24] press on it moves me to preach some
[53:26] message it moves me not to give up it
[53:29] moves me to go
[53:31] forward I tell you when you see a people
[53:33] it moves me to realize that there is a
[53:36] people on earth that is literally
[53:38] matching the prophecy of what William
[53:40] brandham saw it's a powerful thing that
[53:43] what you when you look in the message
[53:45] and you see what the bride is going to
[53:46] be what she's going to look like what
[53:49] how she's going to handle oursel and
[53:51] then see it come into reality you are a
[53:54] people for a purpose
[53:57] and God did not send you here just to
[53:59] listen to tapes he did not just send you
[54:01] here just to read scriptures he sent you
[54:04] here for a
[54:05] purpose because you are going to be bone
[54:08] of his bone life of his life nature of
[54:11] his very nature and somebody is going to
[54:14] step into the reality of what a prophet
[54:21] saw
[54:23] Hallelujah M said in this moury or in
[54:25] the pram in church age he said in the
[54:27] last days the true bride Christ seed
[54:30] will come to The Headstone and she will
[54:33] be the Super Church of super race as she
[54:35] nears him they and the bride will be so
[54:38] much like him that they will even be his
[54:41] very image this is in order to be United
[54:44] with him they will be one they will be
[54:47] the very manifestation of the word of
[54:50] the Living God denominations cannot
[54:53] produce this wrong seat you see you
[54:56] think about the hour that we are living
[54:58] in in the lay odyssean Church age that
[55:00] this is the hour that Jesus has been
[55:02] locked out of the church it's the only
[55:05] age it's the only age that is standing
[55:07] on the outside of the church what did
[55:09] the denominations do they locked out the
[55:12] revelation of who Jesus Christ was they
[55:15] locked him out on the outside but Christ
[55:17] was trying to get entrance into his
[55:19] church and there was a people that
[55:21] rejected him but there is a people that
[55:24] have accepted him when the world didn't
[55:26] want him when the religions didn't want
[55:28] him but there was a people there was a
[55:32] bride there was an anointed people it
[55:34] was once the anointed man but now it's
[55:37] the anointed people anointed by what by
[55:40] accepting what Eve turned
[55:44] down Hallelujah and God is Not unjust in
[55:48] his ways he put every one of us here on
[55:51] free moral agency he gave us a choice he
[55:54] gave adam a choice
[55:56] there's not one of us that has the
[55:58] ability to tell God how to run his
[56:00] business because God has never had a new
[56:02] thought he's never been surprised but
[56:05] all along God has been waiting he's been
[56:07] waiting to be savior because he he's
[56:10] been waiting because there was
[56:12] attributes in him to be a savior so he
[56:14] condescended so that he could be touched
[56:17] he humbled himself in order to be
[56:19] praised he humbled himself to be
[56:21] worshiped because he desired to be
[56:23] handled he desired to be loved he
[56:25] desired to be adored and the great
[56:28] Eternal one be to express himself out
[56:31] came him through the logos and down
[56:33] throughout time he created himself a
[56:35] family what was it deity was being
[56:38] expressed and when Jesus stood here it
[56:42] was deity being expressed in humanity it
[56:45] was a Son of God manifested In the Flesh
[56:48] what was it it was a person for a
[56:51] purpose because deity was expressing he
[56:54] looked like all other humans
[56:56] he dressed like all other humans he got
[56:59] tired like all other humans Hallelujah
[57:02] he felt pain like all other humans he
[57:04] had Agony like all other humans he loved
[57:07] like all other humans but on the inside
[57:09] of him was more than a man on side of
[57:12] him was more than a prophet on the
[57:14] inside of him laid God Almighty
[57:18] tabernacled For The First Time in
[57:21] Forever he was the only one that could
[57:24] say that I am the father are
[57:29] one prophets looked apart there was
[57:32] prophetic people that was that looked
[57:35] theart but there was only one man let me
[57:38] transition this to
[57:40] humanity you look like other human
[57:42] beings you dress like other human beings
[57:46] and if we could be real honest here I
[57:48] believe that if you would get down get
[57:50] real honest with yourself that you would
[57:52] admit it that there was something always
[57:55] that was leading
[57:57] you I'd say if we'd be real honest ever
[58:00] since we was a child there was something
[58:02] leading us there was something that was
[58:04] calling us and maybe we tried to Tamp it
[58:07] down with this or that or the other I
[58:09] believe but if we would admit it but it
[58:11] was the important part of the picture it
[58:14] was the very Soul the Jean seat of God
[58:17] that was on the inside of you from
[58:19] before the foundation of the world God
[58:22] saw you and I believe that if we'll be
[58:24] real honest that the there was something
[58:26] leading you all the days of your life
[58:28] when everybody else wanted to do their
[58:30] own thing when everybody else couldn't
[58:32] follow the word he was leading you all
[58:34] the
[58:36] time but the important part is he
[58:41] knew he knew when you didn't
[58:45] know when you didn't look like a bride
[58:48] he knew when you tried to walk away he
[58:51] knew you couldn't when you tried to give
[58:53] up he wouldn't let you what was it the
[58:57] important part of you that is a part of
[58:59] almighty God hallelujah what is it he is
[59:04] he saw you and put your name on the
[59:07] Lamb's Book of Life he unveiled himself
[59:10] he created angels to be almighty God to
[59:13] be God he had to be worshiped because
[59:14] God means an object of worship so he
[59:16] created angels in order to be God and
[59:20] thousands of years he's been unfolding
[59:22] this expressing the attributes of who he
[59:25] is of Je Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Nishi
[59:28] Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Rah here he is
[59:32] and he's been calling and wooing to a
[59:34] people that were built for a
[59:37] purpose and you see what the word does
[59:39] the word of God always
[59:42] separates what is the word done in this
[59:44] generation is because God is calling out
[59:46] a Lamb's Book
[59:48] people the word of God has been
[59:50] separating the Lamb's Book people and
[59:53] the Book of Life people you see before
[59:55] you could ever have a choice Grace was
[59:58] given to you before the foundation of
[1:00:00] the world it's the only way that you
[1:00:02] could be a part of God is that you were
[1:00:04] with him at the beginning it was not
[1:00:07] that God saw your choice because Jean
[1:00:10] because God's genes are
[1:00:13] Eternal it was not that you made the
[1:00:15] right choice when you went down to the
[1:00:17] altar but God made the right choice
[1:00:20] before there was an Adam before there
[1:00:22] was a molecule God chose you you are as
[1:00:26] Eternal as God is eternal let me put it
[1:00:29] in a picture like this the Garden of
[1:00:31] Eden was not Eden without
[1:00:34] Adam it was not Eden with that Adam let
[1:00:37] me say this that we're not leaving one
[1:00:39] hoof behind because the Millennium will
[1:00:43] not be the Millennium and the and the
[1:00:46] throne and where we're going to the city
[1:00:49] will not be a full City unless you're
[1:00:52] there as a jean seed of
[1:00:54] God so let me say this you're a people
[1:00:58] for a purpose and I am I am driven to
[1:01:02] get everyone that I can I am driven to
[1:01:05] preach this message until every breath
[1:01:08] in my lungs is gone until I'm sick and
[1:01:11] blue in the face I will sit here and I
[1:01:14] will preach this message because I
[1:01:16] believe that God still has Jimmy props
[1:01:19] out there that God still has Gabriel
[1:01:22] Spencer out there that God still has
[1:01:25] Randy hles out
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:33] there Adam didn't choose God and your
[1:01:36] choice didn't choose God God brooded
[1:01:39] over you God broed over
[1:01:43] Adam you see you're not saved by the
[1:01:47] blood of a gentile you are not saved by
[1:01:49] the blood of a Jew you are saved by the
[1:01:52] blood of almighty God
[1:01:57] when God begin to go there in the very
[1:01:59] beginning when you begin to read the
[1:02:00] Genesis the gene chapter when you begin
[1:02:03] to see when God would begin to brood
[1:02:05] over the Earth and cause seeds that he
[1:02:07] had that he had planted there that every
[1:02:09] seed would bring forth yielding after
[1:02:11] its kind and the spirit of God begin to
[1:02:13] move out across the waters and brought
[1:02:15] up marine life and animal life and begin
[1:02:17] to move up until he he created one into
[1:02:20] his very own image what was it what was
[1:02:23] it he had made something that looked so
[1:02:26] much like him that he begin to
[1:02:28] rest that he begin to rest that this is
[1:02:31] finally what I've been looking for but
[1:02:33] man made a choice and man fail and ever
[1:02:37] since that time God has been brooding
[1:02:39] over this Earth so he raised up an Enoch
[1:02:42] he raised up an Elijah he raised up a
[1:02:44] Moses Prophet after prophet he was
[1:02:47] trying to restore that image and finally
[1:02:50] upon Earth came the genuine image of God
[1:02:53] himself which was God the logos made
[1:02:55] flesh and dwelt amongst us he said now
[1:02:58] that same logos has a part has got a
[1:03:01] bride that logos has a part has got a
[1:03:06] bride and the same logos this word that
[1:03:09] cannot be tampered with is brooding over
[1:03:12] the churches today trying to bring back
[1:03:14] the word to its full manifestation he
[1:03:17] said which the prophets was carriers to
[1:03:19] that seed and the church denominations
[1:03:21] has been carriers to that seed he said
[1:03:23] now notice quickly he said the Chuck
[1:03:26] hugs and holds onto the seed and then it
[1:03:29] leaves
[1:03:30] her then it leaves her he says in
[1:03:33] Harvest time he said the carriers
[1:03:35] changed he said they denominated the
[1:03:38] blades of tassled the shook he said but
[1:03:41] that wheat can't change he said it's got
[1:03:44] to be a Ministry just exactly on the
[1:03:47] word like he was on the word you see let
[1:03:50] me say it like this the Lutheran changed
[1:03:53] they had the Holy Ghost in part the
[1:03:56] westle had the Holy Ghost in part but 20
[1:03:59] years afterwards every move they begin
[1:04:01] to denominate and
[1:04:04] change Lutheran change Wesleyan Chang
[1:04:08] the isus of Pentecostals changed but
[1:04:10] this is another hour this is the weed
[1:04:13] age when others would change when others
[1:04:16] are changing this bride is not changing
[1:04:20] why because it's not a part of itself
[1:04:23] it's a part of God what was the Alpha
[1:04:26] bride it's now the Omega bride she is a
[1:04:29] bone of his bone Hallelujah the Church
[1:04:32] of the Living God this bride is in
[1:04:34] preview Again by a restored word of the
[1:04:37] hour what Paul preached William Bron
[1:04:40] preached where they baptized in the name
[1:04:42] of Jesus Christ William brandom said I
[1:04:45] did too where they preach the baptism of
[1:04:47] the Holy Ghost I did too he said
[1:04:50] everything they taught I did too well
[1:04:53] I'm happy to be identified with an I did
[1:04:56] to kind of message that this message
[1:04:59] that Paul preached is the same
[1:05:03] message let me tell you something if the
[1:05:06] message that Paul was preaching was
[1:05:08] enough to get him into the third heaven
[1:05:10] there's a message of the hour that'll
[1:05:12] take you past just the third heaven
[1:05:14] it'll put you in a
[1:05:16] Rapture what makes you able to
[1:05:19] understand
[1:05:21] this the Jean seed of God
[1:05:28] you're a candidate for the baptism of
[1:05:31] the Holy Ghost you see Jesus made the
[1:05:34] written word become a living
[1:05:36] reality because he had the habits of
[1:05:39] Jehovah because you watch Jehovah of the
[1:05:42] Old Testament walk out there in the
[1:05:45] scene of the Israelites and he walked
[1:05:47] out there and he breathed across the
[1:05:48] waters and the waters opened up and he
[1:05:51] watched Jehovah in flesh walk out there
[1:05:54] on the waters and said peace be still
[1:05:56] what was it it was the habits of Jehovah
[1:05:58] on the inside of Jesus what was it it
[1:06:01] was Jehovah of the old that stood back
[1:06:03] there that stood back there and he and
[1:06:06] he be to brother random said it like
[1:06:08] this that he rained down a few DW drops
[1:06:10] and therefore he brought forth bread so
[1:06:12] his people could eat it but it was
[1:06:14] Jehovah in the flesh that stood there
[1:06:17] and took two l two little fishes and
[1:06:19] five five five fishes and two loaves of
[1:06:22] bread and fed 5,000 what was it it was a
[1:06:25] habit
[1:06:26] of Jehovah and anybody anybody knows
[1:06:29] that a child carries the name of the
[1:06:31] father that they have the authority of
[1:06:34] the Father and Jesus said I come in my
[1:06:37] father's name if you come in your
[1:06:40] father's name there is power and
[1:06:42] authority when you are sent by the
[1:06:44] Father Like Jesus said my peace I give
[1:06:48] unto you and my peace I live may peace
[1:06:51] be unto you as my father has sent me
[1:06:54] even so send I
[1:06:58] you now the Bible said in Romans 8:14
[1:07:01] how many love the word for as many as
[1:07:04] are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:07:07] the sons of God for you have not
[1:07:09] received the spirit of bondage against
[1:07:10] fear but you have receive the spirit of
[1:07:12] adoption whereby we cry ABA father the
[1:07:16] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:07:18] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:07:23] and if children then HS HS of God and
[1:07:26] join HS with Christ if so be that we
[1:07:28] suffer with him that we might be also
[1:07:31] glorified together I love what brother
[1:07:34] Bram said here he said he said Christ
[1:07:36] couldn't help being what he was he was
[1:07:39] the son of God he said that's it he said
[1:07:40] you see what I mean he said see if you
[1:07:43] were intended you see the word of God
[1:07:45] you believe it why there's something new
[1:07:48] he says why he said have you ever heard
[1:07:51] of a strain in a family he said one a a
[1:07:54] son will kind of impersonate his father
[1:07:56] or mother or the grandfather grandmother
[1:07:58] The Strain that strain in that family
[1:08:00] you heard of it haven't you he said well
[1:08:02] that's the same thing from
[1:08:04] predestination you were supposed to be
[1:08:06] here in the right way at the beginning
[1:08:08] but being that you come the way that you
[1:08:10] did you're subject to the fall but being
[1:08:14] that you're predestinated you hear the
[1:08:18] word being that you're predestinated you
[1:08:21] hear the word it brings you right back
[1:08:24] to where you were
[1:08:28] predestinated that's a mouthful being
[1:08:31] that you're predestinated you hear the
[1:08:33] word it brings you right back to where
[1:08:36] you were predestinated he said I never
[1:08:39] saw it that way before he said it brings
[1:08:41] you right he said what makes you believe
[1:08:44] the word and turn down these other
[1:08:46] things he said there's something in
[1:08:52] you what made you turn down alcohol what
[1:08:55] made you turn down religion and accept
[1:08:58] Christ there's something in you come on
[1:09:01] somebody there's plenty of people that
[1:09:03] have religious spirits on them but you
[1:09:05] don't want just to be religious you want
[1:09:07] to have
[1:09:09] life come on somebody there's over
[1:09:12] 44,000 denominations now when the
[1:09:16] prophet was here there was 900
[1:09:19] denominations
[1:09:21] 44,000 what made you turn them down come
[1:09:25] on somebody how many churches did you
[1:09:27] pass coming to church tonight what made
[1:09:30] you drive past them to come
[1:09:34] here there was something on the inside
[1:09:37] of you that made You
[1:09:39] Believe come on somebody when the
[1:09:42] message looks wrong to everybody else
[1:09:45] it's perfect to you because you and the
[1:09:50] word have become one
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:09:56] Romans 8:29 for whom he did for no he
[1:09:59] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:10:01] the image of the son that he might be
[1:10:03] the firstborn among many Brethren
[1:10:05] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:10:08] he also called and whom he called them
[1:10:10] he also Justified and whom he justified
[1:10:13] then he also
[1:10:15] glorified he called you for a
[1:10:18] purpose you can't help being who you
[1:10:21] are come on somebody you can't help
[1:10:24] being Who You Are you might get a little
[1:10:26] excited when the preaching of the word
[1:10:28] comes your by your way but you can't
[1:10:29] help being who you are come on somebody
[1:10:33] if you feel a shout coming on go ahead
[1:10:35] and Shout but if all you feel is to clap
[1:10:38] your hands you can't help being who you
[1:10:41] are but Express the image that God
[1:10:50] saw what I love what I love about
[1:10:53] brother bis's Ministry
[1:10:56] is that he it was not just another
[1:10:58] Ministry brother Chester but he saw he
[1:11:02] captured the
[1:11:04] event of the Lord's coming in Bride form
[1:11:08] it captured this Messiah
[1:11:11] sign what you what you what you are
[1:11:14] enjoying and what you are rejoicing
[1:11:16] about is the event of the Lord
[1:11:20] coming what was it what was it it wasn't
[1:11:23] just a man it wasn't just a one one man
[1:11:27] message it was but now it has turned to
[1:11:30] a body move and now you are enjoying the
[1:11:35] inent the event of a restored
[1:11:39] word you can't help being who you are
[1:11:43] let me say this to you the Hawks can eat
[1:11:45] what they want to the buzzards can eat
[1:11:48] what they want to the chickens can eat
[1:11:50] what they want to but for me in my house
[1:11:53] we have got to have fresh man
[1:11:57] come on somebody I don't think myself
[1:11:59] any better than anybody else but I am
[1:12:02] called higher than
[1:12:04] Pentecostalism I am called higher than
[1:12:06] Methodist I am called higher than Luther
[1:12:10] this is eag age so we've got to eat an
[1:12:12] eagle
[1:12:14] food why we're a people for a purpose so
[1:12:18] if God's give us Eagle eyesight then
[1:12:21] we've got to have eagle's wings to fly
[1:12:25] to the realm of faith that he's destined
[1:12:27] us to
[1:12:31] be you see God knew what was on the
[1:12:34] inside of
[1:12:35] you it's just like brother brandom said
[1:12:37] when he said he said I climb in
[1:12:39] mountains he said I get all the way up
[1:12:40] there brother Chris he said I get all
[1:12:42] the way up there and he said I see the
[1:12:43] pygmy he said I see the pygmy Spruce he
[1:12:46] said them goats that live up that high
[1:12:48] he said they they eat on that piggy
[1:12:50] Spruce he said then you come on down he
[1:12:52] said then you got the pine tree then you
[1:12:54] got the quake and ASP he said if you
[1:12:56] keep coming down you got brush he said
[1:12:58] then you got grass he said then you got
[1:13:00] weeds he said all of them had a cell of
[1:13:03] life on the inside of him he said but it
[1:13:06] takes the intelligence of God to put
[1:13:08] them in the right
[1:13:09] place it takes the intelligence of God
[1:13:12] to put them in the right place let me
[1:13:13] say this to you you didn't get yourself
[1:13:16] here you didn't make yourself believe
[1:13:18] this but the intelligence of God has put
[1:13:20] you in an environment so that you could
[1:13:23] believe like a last day type of people
[1:13:26] that believe that believe that you're
[1:13:29] going in a Rapture that believe that all
[1:13:31] things are possible don't blame me it's
[1:13:34] the intelligence that put me in this
[1:13:36] environment let me tell you you could
[1:13:38] put me on the inside of a Pentecostal
[1:13:41] Church down here and I wouldn't last a
[1:13:43] second you could put me in a Lutheran
[1:13:45] Church and I wouldn't last a second you
[1:13:47] could put me in a Methodist Church and I
[1:13:49] wouldn't last a second because the Holy
[1:13:52] Ghost on the inside of the elect of God
[1:13:54] will make them run for
[1:13:58] truth I say un you come to the water the
[1:14:01] water's
[1:14:04] fine come on somebody you're built for
[1:14:07] this environment you're built for this
[1:14:10] atmosphere come on in the water's fine
[1:14:13] it's time that you un loosen the button
[1:14:16] and jump in the water and start drinking
[1:14:18] on this Pentecostal fresh experience and
[1:14:21] give almighty God a fresh drink don't
[1:14:24] let people make you think that you're
[1:14:26] Pentecostal you're Pentecostal in Your
[1:14:28] Heart by experience not by emotion
[1:14:32] you're
[1:14:33] Pentecostals just like Peter
[1:14:37] was don't blame me it's the environment
[1:14:40] that William Brandon built for
[1:14:43] me don't try to take me out of my
[1:14:46] astronut age don't try to take me out of
[1:14:48] my rocket fool don't try to take me out
[1:14:50] of my rocket ship I was built for a
[1:14:53] rapture
[1:14:56] Hallelujah and I got a purpose to leave
[1:14:59] here one of these
[1:15:02] days somebody give the Lord a hand clap
[1:15:04] of
[1:15:10] Praise You Can't fake it you can't fake
[1:15:14] it because God knows and Satan
[1:15:18] knows you're not going to Bluff the
[1:15:21] devil come on somebody you're not going
[1:15:23] to Bluff the devil he knows but when he
[1:15:25] sees the purchased product of the blood
[1:15:27] of Jesus Christ there it makes itan back
[1:15:30] off it's just like the woman at the
[1:15:32] whale she looked like she was supposed
[1:15:34] to live in an environment looked like
[1:15:37] she was supposed to live in an
[1:15:38] environment as a prostitute the rest of
[1:15:40] her life but somebody came by their way
[1:15:43] came by her way what did he do he
[1:15:45] watered that seed that was on the inside
[1:15:47] of her before she ever committed Her
[1:15:50] First Act of
[1:15:52] adultery what was it brother man said if
[1:15:55] it wouldn't have been for re
[1:15:56] representation by predestination he said
[1:15:58] it would have never took hold he said
[1:16:00] but because it was there he said there
[1:16:02] was something that took a hold of
[1:16:06] her I don't have to call your name but
[1:16:09] something took a hold of your life when
[1:16:11] the rest of the world tried to offer you
[1:16:12] everything else it never took hold but
[1:16:15] when Christ came and offered you this
[1:16:17] water this living water come on somebody
[1:16:20] it took a hold in your life
[1:16:25] he said now in Pentecost or Full Gospel
[1:16:28] people he said around the world he said
[1:16:29] I find them with great faith and he said
[1:16:31] and the reason they have faith is
[1:16:33] because they just stepped up a little
[1:16:34] bit further he said they've been born of
[1:16:38] the spirit of
[1:16:39] God which is the
[1:16:43] supernatural they have been born of the
[1:16:45] spirit of God which is the supernatural
[1:16:47] he said and many people tell me said
[1:16:49] well brother Brandon as you get older
[1:16:51] you look like your dad I love listening
[1:16:53] to this life he said well he's my
[1:16:57] dad he said that's the reason I look
[1:16:59] like
[1:17:02] him I love it when you all come you come
[1:17:05] tell me I I look like my grand day Homer
[1:17:08] had somebody tell me after this week God
[1:17:10] bless
[1:17:11] you if I look as good as him Grandma
[1:17:15] when he got 80 years old I feel like
[1:17:17] I'll be doing all
[1:17:19] right and if I can sing and dance like
[1:17:22] he did when he was 75 and 80 years old I
[1:17:24] feel like I'd be don't all
[1:17:27] right then I got people tell well when I
[1:17:30] hear you preach you sound exactly like
[1:17:32] your daddy if I wouldn't have been
[1:17:33] looking I'd have thought that was your
[1:17:34] daddy
[1:17:36] preaching you had to be
[1:17:39] looking cuz if you'd have looked you
[1:17:40] just saw the
[1:17:43] difference the reason why people say
[1:17:45] that is because there's a strain there
[1:17:49] there's something that identifies me
[1:17:50] with my grandfather and my my father
[1:17:52] there's things about them that I carry
[1:17:55] in my own natural
[1:17:57] genealogy he said well now the same
[1:17:59] thing he said many things that we have
[1:18:02] he said that we have by favor we favor
[1:18:04] our family he said by Family strain like
[1:18:07] that each other he said and then in the
[1:18:09] family strain of God he said if we
[1:18:11] become born of the spirit of God we take
[1:18:13] on the nature of God which then we are
[1:18:16] the sons of God and he said that's where
[1:18:18] I find them Full Gospel people aren't
[1:18:20] you glad to be Full Gospel Lighthouse
[1:18:22] Tabernacle he said that's where I find
[1:18:25] that the Full Gospel people has become
[1:18:27] Sons and Daughters of God they believe
[1:18:30] the
[1:18:33] supernatural I'm happy to be identified
[1:18:35] that I believe the supernatural he said
[1:18:39] now the other has never stepped up there
[1:18:41] he said them others have never stepped
[1:18:43] up there so they can't believe the
[1:18:45] supernatural he said there's nothing in

[1:19:31] that was just some old man coming up
[1:19:33] there and pouring some kind of oil on
[1:19:34] top of me but he recognized that he
[1:19:37] anointed me for a purpose he anointed me
[1:19:39] to kill Goliath he anointed me to kill
[1:19:41] the kings of the amorites he anointed me
[1:19:44] to sit on the
[1:19:46] throne he had something on the inside of

[1:20:17] that the god that delivered him from the
[1:20:18] hands of the lon was almighty God the
[1:20:21] supernatural God that could deliver him

[1:21:21] take my hay out in the field and he said
[1:21:23] when only one cow comes out he said I
[1:21:25] only give him just half of the
[1:21:36] bail God bless our
[1:21:40] [Applause]
[1:21:52] farmers and brother brandham goes into
[1:21:54] believe in God he said and we being dead
[1:21:56] in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are
[1:21:59] HS according to the promise there you
[1:22:01] are he said and that brings not in our
[1:22:04] bodies we are Gentiles in our bodies we
[1:22:07] are sinners in our bodies but in our
[1:22:10] souls being born again with the same
[1:22:12] spirit that was upon faithful Abraham he
[1:22:14] said that strain down in there makes us
[1:22:17] want to trust God he said but the body
[1:22:20] gets scared he said oh if we're the
[1:22:22] children of Abraham let's be as Father
[1:22:25] Abraham was you see that strain on the
[1:22:28] inside of you makes you want to trust
[1:22:30] God when your body gets nervous when
[1:22:33] your body has bruises and it has all
[1:22:35] kinds of conditions on it your body gets
[1:22:38] scared and your mind starts playing
[1:22:39] tricks with you what is it how amazing
[1:22:42] that it is that as soon as you get some
[1:22:44] kind of illness that that LE osia has
[1:22:47] put a phobia on people well God bless I
[1:22:49] must be losing my memory I must I must
[1:22:51] be going down with it must be cancer I
[1:22:53] had that pain back
[1:22:57] what is it about what is it we are
[1:22:59] Gentiles in our bodies but in our souls
[1:23:04] but in our souls we are born again he
[1:23:07] said and that strain on the inside of us
[1:23:10] makes us trust God come on somebody how
[1:23:14] many times have you had a headache how
[1:23:16] many times have you had all kinds of
[1:23:18] conditions and the body got
[1:23:20] scared but there's something on the
[1:23:22] inside of you the all Jean SE of God
[1:23:26] raises up and said believe for healing
[1:23:28] believe for a miracle believe for a body
[1:23:32] change like a little Georgie Carter she
[1:23:36] had heard she had heard about God sent a
[1:23:39] prophet she'd heard about what this one
[1:23:41] done heard about this one how this one
[1:23:43] got healed but she had been raised in a
[1:23:45] church that had been taught not to
[1:23:47] believe in the
[1:23:48] Supernatural they raised her up that way
[1:23:51] so she heard about a prophet she heard
[1:23:54] about it she heard about healing that it
[1:23:56] was for her generation and her mama got
[1:23:59] all tore up because Georgie said God if
[1:24:03] you'll heal me I'll get up out of this
[1:24:05] bed and I'll go get baptized in the name
[1:24:07] of Jesus Christ and it got her mama so
[1:24:10] worked up that she took on the py and
[1:24:14] slept she slept by the bed she hardly
[1:24:16] ever slept at night hardly slept during
[1:24:18] the day and she got so worked up and she
[1:24:21] called William brandham a con man
[1:24:24] an impostor said Lord you see you see
[1:24:29] this this impostor that's come in here
[1:24:31] and worked up my
[1:24:34] daughter mother man said she laid down
[1:24:38] he said she laid down at the kitchen
[1:24:39] table laid her head over there he said
[1:24:42] she laid her head down there and she saw
[1:24:44] a vision and she looked up and she saw
[1:24:48] as one coming out one coming out and she
[1:24:51] said it was Jesus Christ she said and
[1:24:53] about that same time the car door
[1:24:56] slammed and out stepped William
[1:25:01] brandom what she didn't realize is that
[1:25:04] William Brandon was being Jesus Christ
[1:25:06] to
[1:25:07] her but the vision made her realize that
[1:25:10] he was not an impostor he was not a con
[1:25:13] man you see if God if God is on your
[1:25:17] side he will make all things work for
[1:25:20] his good according to them that are
[1:25:22] called and Georgie had something
[1:25:24] something on the inside of her there was
[1:25:26] a strain that came from God that there
[1:25:28] would be a Ministry what would attach
[1:25:31] this miracle all the way through its
[1:25:34] entire Ministry of Malachi 4 and Men of
[1:25:36] this day have picked it up and ran with
[1:25:39] it that there she was a gentile in her
[1:25:41] body she was a sinner in her soul in her
[1:25:44] body but in her
[1:25:46] soul she believed the supernatural when
[1:25:50] she was taught wrong when she was raised
[1:25:52] wrong
[1:25:55] Lord the man William Brandon matched the
[1:25:58] image because when he walked in there
[1:26:01] and called Georgy called her out of that
[1:26:03] bed she got up out of there she didn't
[1:26:05] lay in her condition no more what was
[1:26:07] the very first thing she started doing
[1:26:09] she ran out there in the grass and
[1:26:11] started praising God got on the piano
[1:26:14] and started worshiping
[1:26:16] God what was it this little lamb that
[1:26:19] was back there in mil toown that was
[1:26:21] crying for help Georgie Carter Matt
[1:26:25] what that lamb was and when people
[1:26:27] taught wrong and when people believed
[1:26:29] wrong God knew where his lamb was and he
[1:26:32] came to the thicket of miltown and
[1:26:34] raised up Georgie
[1:26:37] Carter don't talk to me about your hurts
[1:26:40] don't talk to me about what men's done
[1:26:42] to you there's a God that's calling you
[1:26:44] out of the thicket he's Jehovah Gyra
[1:26:48] he'll provide himself a lamb
[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:26:57] I'm going to read this and we're going
[1:26:59] to
[1:27:02] close and the angel of gone he
[1:27:05] said he's in a discernment line he said

[1:27:30] Bolt comes from from you like a cloud or
[1:27:33] something he said something waves like a
[1:27:35] breath moving he said you get scared

[1:27:41] weary don't you is that right many times

[1:29:13] identifying that what William Brandon
[1:29:15] was preaching that Jehovah of the Old
[1:29:17] Testament was Jesus Christ of the new
[1:29:20] the pillar of fire showing up was
[1:29:22] showing us that William Brandon was
