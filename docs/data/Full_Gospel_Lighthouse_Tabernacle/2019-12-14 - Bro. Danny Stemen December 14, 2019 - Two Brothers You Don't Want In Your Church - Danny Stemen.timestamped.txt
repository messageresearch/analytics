[1:46] just know you're blessed people and we

[1:51] long if we wanted to but I know we don't

[2:14] they've been been a wonderful time so we
[2:16] love you with the love of the Lord and
[2:18] Amen why don't we just bow our heads for
[2:20] word
[2:20] prayer and amen ask the Lord to have his
[2:23] way our Heavenly Father it is such a
[2:27] privilege to be able to be in the house
[2:29] of God the place that you have provided
[2:32] Lord even as the name of the church this
[2:35] lighthouse this gospel lighthouse that
[2:37] you've given this area and the people
[2:41] that come to it the men of God that you
[2:43] have placed here to minister to this
[2:45] area father may you come tonight Lord
[2:48] and have your way in the service Lord
[2:52] anointing my lips moving me to the side
[2:55] Lord and 19 to ears of the hear Lord it
[2:58] takes you to make the service successful
[3:01] we've had the singing Lord as we've
[3:04] prepared ourselves for the battle now
[3:06] Lord may you come in a special way deal
[3:09] with the needs of the people father
[3:11] we'll give ourselves to you and ask you
[3:13] to do these things in the name of Jesus
[3:15] Christ we ask amen amen
[3:19] god bless you if you turn in your Bibles
[3:23] to the book of Nehemiah 2nd chapter
[3:40] and I would read it verse nine Nehemiah
[3:47] is speaking about his journey to
[3:52] Jerusalem from the palace in Shushan
[3:55] there in Persia and the first chapter of
[4:01] Nehemiah deals with him hearing that the
[4:03] walls and much of Jerusalem lay in ruins
[4:07] and you know when any child of God hears
[4:12] that something is out of orders what God
[4:14] has placed he cannot be complacent
[4:19] because I believe this said that God
[4:22] uses the agency of men and he does it by
[4:26] placing burdens upon them and and many
[4:30] times we said here we wonder well what
[4:32] can I do well you just let the Lord amen
[4:35] have his way by getting yourself out of
[4:37] the way
[4:38] God is able to accomplish much more than
[4:40] you can do with all your learning your
[4:42] education amen but let God just get in
[4:45] the middle of it it'll change everything
[4:47] and he'd heard that it was it was burnt
[4:50] down then the walls were in rubble and
[4:52] in it and it became a prayer a burden in
[4:57] his life that he couldn't get away from
[5:00] until it even affected him in his work
[5:03] in the palace and when the King saw it
[5:06] and asked him why was his countenance
[5:09] fallen and so forth why was he sad he
[5:12] said he was fearful because in the
[5:13] Persian courts they had to be upbeat
[5:16] they had to be happy the King didn't
[5:18] want to see anything around him that
[5:20] that would be downcast and so he said I
[5:22] was a very afraid but you know if God is
[5:25] working on one end he's also going to be
[5:28] working on the other end rather and
[5:30] sister I want to before I even start
[5:32] these meetings I want you to know we're
[5:34] living in the hour of restoration amen
[5:37] and God did not just put a desire in
[5:39] your heart for restoration if he's not
[5:41] already working on the other end can you
[5:44] say Amen
[5:45] amen and so then God was already
[5:48] marrying away and now the story of
[5:50] Nehemiah is that he's given permission
[5:52] he's given Kings letters and he's given
[5:55] time to go back and to restore the walls
[5:59] of Jerusalem so verse 9 of chapter 2
[6:02] says I came to the governor's beyond the
[6:04] river and I gave them the Kings letters
[6:08] now the King had sent captains of the
[6:11] army and horsemen with me when sanballat
[6:14] the annoyed and Tobiah the servant
[6:16] the ammonite heard of it it grieved them
[6:19] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[6:22] seek the welfare of the children of
[6:23] Israel so I came to Jerusalem and I was
[6:26] there three days and I arose in the
[6:28] night I and some few men with me neither
[6:31] told I any man what my God had put in my
[6:34] heart to do it Jerusalem neither was
[6:36] there any beast with me save the beast
[6:38] that I wrote upon and I went out by
[6:40] night by the gate of the valley even
[6:42] before the dragon well into the dung
[6:44] port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem
[6:46] which were broken down and the gates
[6:48] thereof were consumed with fire I went
[6:52] to the gate of the fountain into the
[6:53] Kings pool but there was no place for
[6:55] the Beast that was under me to pass I
[6:57] went up by night by the brook and viewed
[7:00] the wall and turned back and entered by
[7:02] the gate of the valley and so returned
[7:04] and the rulers knew not whither I went
[7:07] or what I did neither had I as yet told
[7:10] it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to
[7:13] the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the
[7:15] rest that did the work then I said unto
[7:18] them you see the distress that we are in
[7:21] how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates
[7:24] thereof are burned with fire come let us
[7:27] build up the wall of Jerusalem that we'd
[7:29] be no more reproach and then I told them
[7:32] of the hand of my god which was a part
[7:34] which was good upon me as also the
[7:37] King's words that he had spoken unto me
[7:39] and they said let us rise up and build
[7:43] so they strengthened their hands for
[7:46] this good work but when some ballot the
[7:49] horror night and Tobiah the servant the
[7:51] ammonite and Giessen the arabian heard
[7:53] it they laughed at the scorn and
[7:55] despised us and said what is this
[7:58] that you do will you rebel against the
[8:01] king then answer tie them and said unto
[8:03] them the God of heaven
[8:05] he'll prosperous therefore we his
[8:08] servants will arise and build but you
[8:10] have no portion nor right Norma Morial
[8:16] in Jerusalem the Lord bless Serena of
[8:21] his word you can be seated
[8:23] amen as I was thinking about this
[8:25] scripture and the Lord had milena saw my
[8:28] heart and I had being gone through some
[8:30] of these things with the church at home
[8:32] and he directed me to something here and
[8:38] and and before I give you the title of
[8:41] it I just give you a little bit of the
[8:42] background of the time that Israel is in
[8:45] at this moment you see Nehemiah was
[8:49] coming to a city that had no walls
[8:52] it was rubble it was desolation and had
[8:58] been that way for many years and it's
[9:01] something that people can live in that
[9:04] condition live in a place that God has
[9:07] given them and yet not do anything about
[9:13] the the destruction that they become
[9:16] used to and the reason a person can't do
[9:19] anything is because number one
[9:21] destruction can be so bad you don't know
[9:23] where to start
[9:24] and you don't know how to get back how
[9:27] many times have have we heard the
[9:29] prophets say at least two I say many
[9:32] times but at least two amen I've heard
[9:34] the prophets say you've been looking for
[9:36] a place to start and then he would tell
[9:39] them and now tonight this is your place
[9:41] you know if they were looking for a
[9:43] place that meant they didn't know how to
[9:44] start and they didn't know how to be
[9:47] free of something that they were in you
[9:49] know somebody can live in a condition so
[9:51] long that the condition becomes actually
[9:54] part of the structure and you don't know
[9:57] how to get out of it
[9:58] and actually you even in your body your
[10:01] body can have something wrong and it and
[10:03] become used to the condition in the body
[10:05] and and actually work away around it and
[10:08] that you live in that condition but your
[10:10] body was not built to live that way is
[10:14] that right so then something else has to
[10:15] compensate you know they lived in all
[10:18] this rubble and they've been there and
[10:20] maybe they were just satisfied okay I've
[10:22] come back and I'm part of the group that
[10:24] you know we're surviving let me just
[10:26] tell you something God never called his
[10:29] people just to be survivors
[10:32] we're not here to survive we're here to
[10:36] fulfill and then and we can only fulfill
[10:39] by getting in that stream of inspiration
[10:42] when God gives it now amen for a long
[10:45] time they lived in a place of blessing
[10:47] but they weren't blessed they lived in a
[10:50] place of song but they were singing come
[10:54] on they lived in a place of victory amen
[10:56] but they had no victory hey men but God
[10:59] said now is the hour of restoration and
[11:02] when the spirit wants to give a
[11:04] revelation Satan cannot hold it down
[11:07] from his people oh I'm glad tonight to
[11:11] be identified with that group amen amen
[11:13] huh I'll try to slow down and be
[11:16] scholarly here hey man why don't you
[11:19] turn with me to the book of Deuteronomy
[11:20] 23 hey man I hey you know I might have
[11:25] to eat my words I'd do a somersault
[11:29] hey man but you'll be dancing if I do so
[11:34] that's all right let's turn to
[11:37] Deuteronomy 23 now I want to take a
[11:40] title and I'll give you my title after I
[11:42] read this if you dare say man verse 3
[11:47] and nanomite and Haman I tore a Moabite
[11:51] shall not enter into the congregation of
[11:54] the Lord even to their 10th generation
[11:57] so they not enter into the congregation
[11:58] of the Lord for ever because they met
[12:03] you not with bread and with water in the
[12:04] way when you came forth out of Egypt and
[12:06] because they hired against the Balaam
[12:09] the son of Beor of plethora
[12:11] missa potamia to curse thee nevertheless
[12:14] the Lord thy God would not hearken unto
[12:16] balaam but the Lord turned the curse
[12:19] into a blessing unto thee because the
[12:23] LORD thy God loved thee and thou shalt
[12:25] not seek their peace nor their
[12:28] prosperity all my days were ever I was
[12:35] reading in 1951 brother Branham was
[12:41] speaking to the congregation and he and
[12:45] the the discernment of the Lord was
[12:47] there and he began to speak to him and
[12:50] he says you've been praying haven't you
[12:51] sir I see you kneel in a room and you
[12:54] prayed if you could ever get near me
[12:58] you'd be healed is that right you suffer
[13:03] with the kidney trouble isn't that true
[13:05] Jesus Christ makes you whole my brother
[13:09] you stand to your feet now let me just
[13:13] say something when God is moving the
[13:16] discernment was not healing them mom it
[13:24] was not healing them but it was telling
[13:26] them get into the healing the angel of
[13:31] the Lord is here he has given you your
[13:35] healing but your faith has got to take
[13:38] it so he tells him stand to your feet
[13:43] now he goes there goes that spirit
[13:46] it's a blackness a darkness leaving that
[13:50] man seemingly you could see it and watch
[13:52] it and then he goes it's got a
[13:55] sympathizing partner
[13:58] so now watch this in in the other realm
[14:02] of the Otherworld the Prophet is
[14:04] watching disappeared he goes it's got a
[14:06] sympathizing partner now what does a
[14:10] sympathizing partner do it they
[14:12] strengthen one another and and by
[14:15] strengthening one another it actually
[14:17] causes unbelief to rise and he says now
[14:21] just a moment there it falls it falls
[14:23] over a man sitting there with a t-shirt
[14:25] on a black headed man his hands in his
[14:28] face
[14:28] stand up young men oh aren't you glad
[14:31] Amen that the devil can hide from
[14:33] everybody else but he cannot hide from
[14:35] God and he tells him he said stand up
[14:39] young man so it goes from one man and it
[14:41] comes to another looking for help but
[14:44] God discerns that over that man and he
[14:47] said you stand up you suffer with kidney
[14:50] stones isn't that right accept Jesus now
[14:53] as your healer so as eyes looking at
[14:56] this and as reading this scripture on
[14:58] Nehemiah this salt come to me and I'm on
[15:02] a minute I'm gonna title this this
[15:04] evening to brothers you don't want in
[15:09] your church to brothers you don't want
[15:17] in your church and we read it to you in
[15:22] Deuteronomy 23 they shall not enter into
[15:26] the congregation of the Lord the era of
[15:30] time that we was reading in in the book
[15:32] of Nehemiah is the last restoration of
[15:35] the Old Testament and the books of Ezra
[15:40] Nehemiah and Esther are all describing
[15:46] the same era in history and the
[15:52] prophetic Oh books of that time are
[15:53] Haggai and Zechariah Haggai Zechariah
[15:57] were two prophets that worked together
[15:59] in the time of Ezra encouraging
[16:02] exhorting prophesying to the people and
[16:04] then you have Malachi and Malik Malik I
[16:08] came later he came in the time
[16:11] of nehemiah and he was he was the
[16:14] prophet and with Malachi being the last
[16:18] book of prophecy and who was in that
[16:21] that time of Nehemiah to to help the
[16:23] people and we see in the book of Malachi
[16:25] he was talking to a corrupt priesthood
[16:27] he was talking amen to an Israel that
[16:29] weren't recognizing their time and and
[16:32] God was rebuking them but not only was
[16:34] he dealing with the current situation he
[16:36] was also looking to the coming of the
[16:38] Lord and not only was he looking to the
[16:40] coming of the Lord in his first coming
[16:41] he was looking to the coming of the Lord
[16:43] in his second coming you see but this is
[16:45] this is speaking about restoration now
[16:48] even if God is doing something a man
[16:50] he's not just speaking about history
[16:52] he's speaking about prophecy amen and
[16:56] listen amen when when God gives prophecy
[16:58] I mean not only with the prophecies he
[17:01] telling you amen this is who I am and
[17:04] this is what I'm done and this is what
[17:05] I'm doing but also it's a restoration of
[17:08] the power of God and now the previous
[17:12] prophets of the Babylonian captivity
[17:16] were Jeremiah who eventually was with
[17:20] the remnant in Egypt then you had
[17:22] Ezekiel who was with the remnant in one
[17:25] part of Babylon and also Daniel who was
[17:27] in the courts of Babylon aren't you glad
[17:31] that no matter where Amen there there's
[17:33] somebody where God has his people
[17:36] there's going to be somebody there to
[17:37] encourage him and you're here tonight
[17:41] amen and God knows your needs amen and
[17:45] he's got a word that'll encourage you
[17:47] amen now you just bear with me as I just
[17:51] kind of give you some background on this
[17:52] the book of Nehemiah he's describing the
[17:55] hour of Revelation and restoration that
[17:59] was given to God's people
[18:01] after years of Babylonian captivity and
[18:05] captivity had been so dark that they
[18:07] said how can we sing the songs they hung
[18:11] their hearts and lower their harps and
[18:13] the Willows by the rivers of Babylon it
[18:17] said we're not in the Lord's place we're
[18:19] not in the lake
[18:20] how can we sing a song amen and so
[18:24] they'd coming out of the darkness of a
[18:26] political and spiritual oppression and
[18:29] God was opening up to them as promised
[18:31] word and shining his light on the
[18:35] prophets words and they're coming to
[18:36] pass amen and it's also interesting to
[18:40] see if if God would do it that way that
[18:42] time he also did it that way this time
[18:46] amen because this is the hour of the
[18:49] restoration of all things
[18:51] amen and that's not just a scripture
[18:54] that's reality and then he did not only
[18:56] Amen restore the word he's restored the
[18:59] people he's restored their position
[19:02] I mean he's restored their position in
[19:04] heavenly places there's no more chasm
[19:07] between God and His people
[19:08] but now we're in fellowship once again
[19:11] and then we're outside the denomination
[19:14] aiming and we're walking in step with
[19:16] the word this is restoration but the
[19:18] restoration is not just you realizing
[19:21] something scripturally but the
[19:22] restoration comes into your life comes
[19:26] into your family comes into your health
[19:33] praise the name of the Lord once again a
[19:36] prophet of God has been used to gather
[19:38] the people unto himself now I found this
[19:43] interesting as I was reading these
[19:46] things that in these books you know God
[19:51] when he writes history he's writing the
[19:54] history of his people when we write
[19:56] history we try to write all the good
[19:58] things but but God when he's writing
[20:02] history he doesn't cover anything he
[20:06] doesn't cover it up he shows the darkest
[20:08] parts of their life a man when he's
[20:11] talking about his election he talked
[20:12] about Abraham who was who lied and he
[20:15] talked about Isaac who also lied he
[20:17] talked about David in his adultery and
[20:19] in his murder and all he never tried to
[20:21] cover that thing up but he showed us how
[20:24] the word would restore
[20:26] this is how God writes a history because
[20:29] he wants you to know how it is you know
[20:35] I've been in other countries where World
[20:37] War two has been falling everything and
[20:38] their history of World War two is
[20:39] different than our history of World War
[20:41] two because they all want to look at it
[20:43] on the on making himself the heroes and
[20:46] make themselves but that's not the way
[20:47] God does and then God takes the ignorant
[20:50] he takes the weak he takes those a man
[20:52] who can't lift himself up and he comes
[20:54] into that and he shows that God is still
[20:57] God but I want to tell you tonight that
[21:01] God of history a man is still here and
[21:04] if he could go into that darkest area of
[21:08] David's life of Abraham's life of
[21:10] Isaac's life he can go into the dark
[21:13] areas of your life as well and amen is a
[21:16] prophecy it's God that gets the last
[21:19] word this should be the name of the Lord
[21:24] all over you this time is that God is
[21:27] interested in his election it keep this
[21:30] in mind in this era of of Ezra Nehemiah
[21:34] when the restoration of the temple and
[21:36] the restoration of the walls there is
[21:38] great men in history at that time God
[21:42] never wrote their name in the Bible hey
[21:45] man how many has ever heard of Socrates
[21:49] Plato who is a disciple of Socrates and
[21:53] Xenophon and and and and that's a guy
[21:55] had to look up and then after them as
[21:58] Aristotle and these are the Greeks these
[22:00] are the guys that are shaping Western
[22:02] civilization with human philosophy
[22:05] they're still using it today you know
[22:07] you know get your Bible and find their
[22:09] name in there their name's not there
[22:12] because they weren't the election God is
[22:17] with his election he was with the
[22:19] captives he was with those who can't
[22:22] recite their name so you can remember
[22:24] Plato but you can't recite the names of
[22:26] the captives that came back out of
[22:28] Babylon but God could God could number
[22:33] them and say exactly who is coming out
[22:35] of those tribes why because they were
[22:37] his election
[22:38] oh brother and sister you are God's
[22:41] election your name may not be in the
[22:43] papers but your names are in the Word of
[22:46] God and that's who God is dealing with
[22:49] tonight blessed be the name of the Lord
[22:53] that's who God is interested in the men
[23:00] were part of amen God can use Plato to
[23:03] be part of the restoration he couldn't
[23:06] use Socrates to be part of the
[23:07] restoration man because they were called
[23:12] for it you're called for it there are
[23:17] some great men in that time it a man
[23:20] from whom come battle tactics used today
[23:24] amen and if I tell you their name you
[23:26] probably wouldn't know them unless
[23:28] you're just a historical freak or
[23:31] something man but you don't see their
[23:34] name in the Bible God God didn't render
[23:36] and important why why is God like that
[23:45] the scripture says it all David wrote
[23:46] down in Psalms 87 he says his foundation
[23:49] is in the holy mountains the Lord loveth
[23:52] the gates of Zion more than all the
[23:55] dwellings of Jacob glorious things are
[23:59] spoken of the Old City of God
[24:04] why because I express and we first get a
[24:11] glimpse of the opposition when Nehemiah
[24:14] comes from the palace they're in Shushan
[24:16] with the burden and the burden he had on
[24:19] his heart was for restoration for
[24:21] Jerusalem he wasn't coming and excuse me
[24:25] if I offend you he went coming with
[24:28] Babylonian flags and politics and he was
[24:33] coming with a purpose he wasn't wrapped
[24:36] up in all the news and he was coming
[24:38] with a purpose and that purpose was
[24:41] restoration it was targeted God said I'm
[24:44] going to restore and I'm gonna use man
[24:47] amen to help it
[24:49] amen and now he's already been given the
[24:51] message of restoration because the King
[24:53] has been stirred by God and the King
[24:55] entered into that inspiration and and
[24:57] when when nehemiah said give me letters
[25:00] that I can give to the governors and I
[25:02] can give to the would the the owners of
[25:05] the of the forest and everything and let
[25:07] them know this is God this is the king
[25:09] it's not me these letters that I'm
[25:13] bringing this is not something I devised
[25:15] amen but the seal itself is not a seal I
[25:18] could put on it it's the Kings seal let
[25:23] it be Kings letters that I'm carrying
[25:26] with me and and that then no this is a
[25:28] nehemiah's project this is God's project
[25:32] and so amen this is what happened is so
[25:36] in the work of God a man is coming the
[25:39] natural king is stirred up in his spirit
[25:41] by God to do the work of this
[25:43] restoration which will be revealed by
[25:45] letter sent by his messenger Nehemiah
[25:47] now these are not just any letters these
[25:51] are the king's letters and one of the
[25:54] most important uses of sealing and
[25:56] antiquity was to give a proof of
[25:59] authenticity and authority to letters
[26:03] and royal commands would be the king
[26:05] seal the seal would have to be broken by
[26:11] an authorized person before the book
[26:13] could be read Amen sealing was a badge
[26:17] of authority and power as when a king
[26:22] would hand over his signet ring to one
[26:25] of his officers amen so closed doors
[26:29] were often sealed to prevent the
[26:31] entrance of any authorized person let me
[26:35] just say this because in honor the
[26:37] ceiling was broken as well but the
[26:39] sealing is to keep the authorized person
[26:42] out
[26:43] I'm scuse me the unauthorized person out
[26:45] and could only be given to the
[26:47] authorized people so just just
[26:51] understand Nehemiah came carrying
[26:53] letters he knew I was in the letters
[26:55] because what was in the letters was also
[26:57] in his heart he
[26:59] what was there but the enemy didn't know
[27:01] what was there so so the king's letters
[27:06] or words would have had the Kings seal
[27:08] to give proof of authority and
[27:10] authenticity and these men that oppose
[27:14] Nehemiah's work do not know about the
[27:17] sealed letters and neither does the
[27:19] enemy today have the revelation that
[27:23] came with the opening of the sealed
[27:27] letters he only tries to block the
[27:31] outpouring of revelation by saying it's
[27:35] not time for this work of restoration
[27:39] now well--we're watch is how this spirit
[27:43] tries to overthrow the work in Jerusalem
[27:45] by disputing that this work is not
[27:48] authorized by the king now these men and
[27:56] we read about them sim ballot from
[27:59] Tobiah and they had another sympathizing
[28:03] partner by the name Magee some the
[28:04] arabian and they had allied together
[28:08] against the work of restoration and they
[28:12] didn't have any knowledge of the king's
[28:14] letters all they knew was this man's
[28:16] coming from a far country and he's
[28:20] stirring up the people they're actually
[28:23] having a revival in jerusalem and
[28:27] actually things were starting to be done
[28:29] and so they have knowledge of the Kings
[28:34] laws but they don't have knowledge of
[28:37] the Kings secrets because that's in the
[28:41] heart of his messenger and it's in his
[28:43] letters that's been sent brother Branham
[28:47] said in the anointed ones at the end
[28:49] time he spoke about revelation 16 he
[28:52] said between the 6 and the seventh vial
[28:54] he said there were three unclean spirits
[28:56] like frogs and he said did you notice
[28:58] that he said they went out of the mouths
[28:59] of someone he said it was a trinity of
[29:02] spirits and and then the Trinity of
[29:04] frogs and a frog is an animal that
[29:06] always looked back
[29:08] word he never looks where he's going he
[29:10] looks where he came from amen now that's
[29:15] and he spoke about Trinitarian and said
[29:16] where was Trinitarian born at he said
[29:19] remember three unclean spirit three
[29:21] individual spirits he said they looked
[29:24] back to the nyah seeing Council where
[29:27] the doctrine was born but not to the
[29:29] Bible right so their inspiration was not
[29:34] coming from the word not coming from
[29:37] what God was revealing but it was coming
[29:39] from their knowledge of what the King
[29:42] was not allowing the people of Jerusalem
[29:45] to enjoy how he said whether they come
[29:50] from a Trinity of frogs came out of an
[29:53] old Trinity see it just keeps him in
[29:55] these old things just keep re coming
[29:57] again coming again an old Trinity of
[30:01] frogs and a new Trinity of frogs and
[30:04] then you see you have the dragon the
[30:06] Beast the false prophet and where do
[30:09] these frogs come out when did they come
[30:12] out he said they weren't manifested
[30:14] until between the six and seven seals
[30:16] just before the seal our seventh vial
[30:19] just before the seals open to reveal it
[30:22] he said for in the message of the
[30:24] seventh angel the mysteries of God would
[30:27] be known all these Trinitarian things
[30:29] and false baptisms listen brother and
[30:31] sister we get we got to get our minds
[30:32] off dogma and just the intellectual side
[30:35] of the message amen to say okay now I
[30:38] understand the Godhead or I understand
[30:40] about water baptism no there's a
[30:42] spiritual power behind it
[30:46] Amen listen we all set in darkness we
[30:50] all were oppressed these Trinitarian
[30:52] things they come from a spirit of
[30:54] oppression that would hold the people
[30:56] down so they couldn't rise up with
[30:58] revelation and begin to get strength
[31:00] again there was a reason they weren't
[31:02] building in Jerusalem they had no
[31:04] strength for revival Amen but God was
[31:10] sending them a revival by the message I
[31:13] was coming by his messenger
[31:16] and when that message began to sound in
[31:20] every person in Jerusalem had a right to
[31:23] that revival man you say well I don't
[31:30] feel worthy I don't feel like I can
[31:31] stand up and accept this but God never
[31:33] asked you that part of it he asked you
[31:36] can you see the message that I brought
[31:38] to you in that message is your revival
[31:41] in that message is your freedom I'm
[31:46] tired of hearing the excuses of why I
[31:48] can't live this message this message
[31:50] Amon is your freedom
[31:58] remember the RAM says this now I think
[32:00] these things are important in light of
[32:02] the things that are all going on that
[32:05] there's spirits rising up because
[32:09] freedom is being expressed I know I'm
[32:13] just I'm giving you an overview of
[32:14] Nehemiah Nehemiah was coming to a
[32:16] broken-down city and then have been hard
[32:20] work to just get the temporary stores
[32:23] but the walls were all broken down in a
[32:27] walled city a city that has no walls has
[32:29] no control amen and here here they are
[32:34] he's coming to a city that's the walls
[32:36] are broken down but the restoration is
[32:38] coming in the restoration there's gonna
[32:40] be names called lineage is going to be
[32:45] restored again I mean the temples going
[32:48] to be purged out the uncleanness is
[32:51] going to be purged out the music of
[32:53] David is going to come back again so God
[32:57] was restoring everything because it was
[33:01] a time of restoration speaking of this
[33:03] hour when Hagee I came came in and he
[33:07] was he was he was exhorting them to to
[33:09] build the temp on he and he spoke to
[33:11] them and he and he told them he says you
[33:13] work and you live in your nice homes and
[33:16] you work amen and you take your money
[33:18] and you put it in a bag with holes
[33:20] he says you you live in a nice home and
[33:22] the temple of God is not built why is
[33:24] the temple of God not built here he is
[33:27] he's pragmatic
[33:28] he's looking at what needs to be done he
[33:30] says get up there in the mountain and
[33:32] chop some wood so he's looking at the
[33:34] people and what they're not doing but
[33:36] then here comes actor aisle working
[33:37] right alongside of them and he sees the
[33:40] high priest standing there in another
[33:42] realm he sees him there with an unclean
[33:44] garments amen he sees the angel of the
[33:47] Lord standing right beside him and he
[33:50] also sees Satan standing at his right
[33:52] hand to resist him but God never allowed
[33:56] that so that Satan to open his mouth he
[33:58] just that angel said take away the
[34:00] unclean garment put a clean one on and
[34:03] put a mitre upon his head why the work
[34:05] of restoration was on well let me tell
[34:12] you we can look around and we can see
[34:14] what needs to be done but there's also
[34:15] something else happening in the unseen
[34:17] realm and may God open our eyes and see
[34:21] that God is here amen to see that the
[34:24] work is finished brother Branham says
[34:30] this she said the message of the seventh
[34:31] angel the mission of God would be known
[34:33] all these Trinitarian things false
[34:35] baptisms and everything was to be made
[34:37] manifest God help us to see what's truth
[34:40] he said I feel that spirit rescinding
[34:43] that you see I'm not speaking of myself
[34:46] brother I'm speaking of the angel of the
[34:48] Lord that's in the camp so he said a
[34:55] false Trinity was rising not in the
[34:57] early days it would be it wouldn't be
[34:59] made manifest in two days it went right
[35:01] on through with it but when the seven
[35:03] seals were open those mysteries revealed
[35:05] what that was those he said those frogs
[35:08] those three unclean spirits like frogs
[35:10] come out to manifest himself a Trinity
[35:14] doctrine against the truth notice when
[35:20] the truth opens how Satan gonna fight it
[35:24] these unclean spirits would come out
[35:28] against the truth by looking back
[35:34] anything I looked back it's going to get
[35:37] its source from somewhere else and in
[35:41] that looking back they never looked to
[35:42] the original source but they look back
[35:45] to the wrong thing amen brother Branham
[35:50] goes on to say what did God say about
[35:51] that evil spirit said these are Devils
[35:55] go forth gods of the earth working
[35:57] miracles deceive them in the last days
[35:59] and will succeed in doing it he said
[36:02] what did God say about that evil spirit
[36:04] it said I'll go down and get in the
[36:05] mouths of those prophets it calls him to
[36:07] prophesy lied I cause they had to come
[36:09] out of there to be destroyed and God
[36:10] says go you'll be successful you'll get
[36:13] them to believe it they're not on that
[36:14] word to begin with and you're persuading
[36:18] a man's a brother man who said I don't I
[36:22] don't care what they said back there at
[36:25] Nicaea I'm saying what they said up here
[36:28] at the throne what would be not what was
[36:33] but what will be for he's the I am you
[36:36] see the message came from the throne it
[36:38] never came back from some man's
[36:40] organization right so now the message of
[36:45] the Kings word will be revealed in the
[36:48] people of Jerusalem this is how we know
[36:51] that is being revealed because it's
[36:53] revealed in the people by the
[36:55] strengthening of their hands to do the
[36:57] work all along in the book of Nehemiah
[37:02] these spirits never believed Nehemiah's
[37:06] message so it shouldn't be a surprise
[37:10] that they don't believe it today you
[37:16] know I think we need to be aware of
[37:18] Satan's tactics because brother BAM says
[37:24] Satan studies us you know he's studying
[37:28] you right hey look look at their look
[37:29] they tend to sleep when they come to
[37:32] church that's their nature to sleep I'm
[37:34] gonna make sure that person never hears
[37:37] anything that comes from that pulpit
[37:40] because he doesn't realize how close he
[37:43] is to his deliverance so then I will do
[37:46] all in my power to
[37:48] Lock and to hinder him with the cares of
[37:50] life with his thoughts with his job with
[37:54] his talents with his ambitions I cloud
[37:56] his mind so the world won't make no
[37:58] sense to him and the hand of faith can't
[38:01] reach out and get it I'm gonna block him
[38:03] from receiving his deliverance why
[38:05] Church is boring in new anyway isn't it
[38:10] see Satan is a blocking hindering spirit
[38:14] and he studies us brother man said he
[38:17] studies your strategy with the word he
[38:20] looks at how you used the word and then
[38:25] he makes his plans from there well you
[38:28] know how nice it is for him to be able
[38:31] to tell his helpers look he don't use
[38:33] the word at all he hears it he goes out
[38:36] he know he's easy we can gobble him up
[38:38] any time because he studies us well we
[38:43] ought to know him and we ought to know
[38:47] how to overcome him we ought to not be
[38:49] ignorant of his devices then when we
[38:51] come into the house of God we're coming
[38:53] with this I'm not fulfilling my duty I'm
[38:55] doing more than my duty John I'm not
[38:58] coming to church tonight so you will
[39:00] think I'm a Christian that's not why I'm
[39:02] here
[39:03] I'm not here preaching so you'll think
[39:05] I'm a preacher that's not why I'm here
[39:07] amen I am called Amen to fulfill a
[39:10] position in this hour that God wants to
[39:13] use me for and God wants to do the same

[39:19] spirit when I pray I pray in the spirit

[40:21] called to be here and God is restoring
[40:24] you now
[40:28] hey hey you may say well I just don't
[40:31] know what part to play I'm the guy that
[40:33] just comes in here and don't know what
[40:34] I'm doing well but God may say huge
[40:36] start amen and that word a little bit
[40:37] some will open up before you never saw
[40:38] before was I found in the book of
[40:41] Nehemiah they used every person in there
[40:46] and it wasn't Plato that was doing the
[40:50] restoration it wasn't Aristotle it
[40:52] wasn't these great warriors it was
[40:54] everybody I mean there were nobody that
[40:57] became somebody by the restoration power
[41:00] of God I want to ask you a question who
[41:04] in the world do you think you are that
[41:06] you are here believing a king's message
[41:09] [Applause]
[41:10] how do we have ears to hear a king's
[41:13] message tonight because God said these
[41:16] are my people
[41:17] this is the gates of Zion I love tsiyon
[41:24] blessed be the name of the Lord
[41:26] hallelujah amen God called you in this
[41:30] hour before he'd ever called Moses he
[41:33] never caught Noah he called you
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:41] hallelujah
[41:44] I the king's message brother BAM said
[41:53] when that little cockney was handed that
[41:55] message from the king just a little
[41:56] soldier he said this is the King's
[41:58] message and this is the seal don't you
[42:00] let anybody stop you and off he went
[42:02] running they try to stop me said get out
[42:04] of my way hallelujah
[42:13] the book of Ezra when they were building
[42:16] the temple there was a bunch of
[42:19] complainers and resistors against the
[42:21] building the restoration and then they
[42:24] wrote back to the king and said listen
[42:25] this rebellious City these bunch of
[42:28] rebels are building what's been
[42:30] destroyed by the Kings and you know
[42:33] there was a rebellious city before they
[42:36] won't pay the Kings taxes they won't
[42:38] give tribute they think they're somebody
[42:43] that King went and searched and he found
[42:46] out about it
[42:47] libel says he wrote another law he sent
[42:51] back and he made him cease the building
[42:52] by force and by power by force and by
[42:59] power he made him stop and for 19 years
[43:03] they never spell built on the temple
[43:07] that's why God had to send prophets
[43:10] that's why prophets have to be involved
[43:13] because a man without a revealed word
[43:15] there's no power in the people they're
[43:18] just another nominal Church well let me
[43:21] just tell you churches are closing their
[43:23] doors every week reason is because
[43:25] there's no power there no power to heal
[43:29] them when I say heal I'm not just
[43:31] talking about heal your body of sickness
[43:33] until I heal their sins say their sins
[43:35] sickness there's no power there so
[43:37] because there's no power they have to
[43:39] compromise with the powers that be
[43:41] because the weapon they have is not
[43:44] greater than the enemies so because it's
[43:48] not greater than the enemies they begin
[43:50] to concede to the national pressure of
[43:52] the gender question of the homosexual
[43:55] question of the marriage question
[43:57] they have to do all these things because
[43:59] there's no power in their church oh they
[44:01] can say nice things and they can say the
[44:03] name of Jesus
[44:04] but it's another Jesus not the one we're
[44:06] acquainted with not the pillar of fire
[44:08] Amen that led them out of Egypt and
[44:10] stood between them and the enemy amen
[44:13] and and destroyed an entire amen
[44:15] Egyptian army in one night
[44:21] hey let me tell you my God is not the
[44:25] god of the Baptists he's the God of the
[44:28] people that's in the Baptist Church but
[44:30] my god is not a Baptist God my God's not
[44:33] a Catholic God God or a Pentecostal God
[44:36] my God is the God of Abraham of Isaac
[44:38] and of Jacob my god is the god amen of
[44:43] William Branham that's my god so in the
[44:53] book of Esther the building was stopped
[44:54] and this is the inspiration these three
[44:56] men some Balaton to buy engage them now
[44:59] can I can I just give you their
[45:01] background because you're going to find
[45:03] out brother and sister you knew these
[45:05] guys all along these guys come to church
[45:16] and they're part and the whole time
[45:24] that's promised was being lived out in
[45:26] the awakening of God's people to the
[45:28] work at hand this ammonite spirit
[45:32] because some ballot is a mall bite and
[45:36] to buy an I think it's interesting that
[45:39] Tobias called the servant okay so he's
[45:43] the ammonite and they have another
[45:46] sympathizing partner and he's an Arabian
[45:49] who's a wanderer give him the wanderer
[45:55] and then to buy the servant the guy who
[46:00] makes himself a useful and then symbolic
[46:04] the Moabite two brothers that God said I
[46:08] don't want them in my congregation
[46:10] now don't you dare go to try to put
[46:13] names to it God already named them it's
[46:18] not up to you to name them but it is up
[46:21] to you to know the spirit because you
[46:23] find out you never find a physical
[46:25] description of Tobiah our sim ballot
[46:27] anywhere never says he's six-foot
[46:28] broad-shouldered curly hair brown eyes
[46:30] black eyes mustache Lynette never said
[46:33] he looks like Ron or his sons or you or
[46:35] our earnest Meadows and it don't give a
[46:39] physical description but it gives their
[46:41] nature because that's what you're going
[46:42] to find out they have a voice it tells
[46:44] how they talk it don't say how they look
[46:46] and you know them by the way their
[46:49] nature is not by the way they look
[46:51] because spirits are generational they
[46:53] just move from generation to generation
[46:54] amen these critical spirits no longer
[46:56] look like Pharisees come on they move
[47:01] they just keep moving they men spirits
[47:02] don't die the vessel they're in may die
[47:04] but spirits don't die and they move on
[47:06] they will die one day
[47:07] amen and they're dying in a lake of fire
[47:09] but while they're here amen we have a
[47:12] message and Nehemiah told them when they
[47:14] begin to talk back to him and says you
[47:15] don't have a right to build these walls
[47:17] you don't have a right to be healed you
[47:19] don't have a right to be restored he
[47:21] said let me tell you something you have
[47:23] no right in Jerusalem I don't find your
[47:25] name there I mean you have no portion
[47:27] there's no land been given to you in
[47:29] Jerusalem and you have no memorial you
[47:32] have no place in the Word of God that's
[47:39] the first thing we got to realize when
[47:41] the enemies come against you hey man
[47:44] this enemy doesn't have a ride over my
[47:46] body because my Bible said he's the
[47:50] savior of the body and he's not just the
[47:54] savior of the mystical body of Christ
[47:56] he's a savior of my body
[48:05] and is ammonite spirit if you're fine
[48:08] read your Bibles and go back at the look
[48:10] at the history of me know many times we
[48:11] read the Bible like a newspaper we just
[48:13] skimmed through the things we don't see
[48:15] them put in the order that they're put
[48:16] in because even God is is saying
[48:19] something out of this book that's alive
[48:22] today and we'll help you as animal
[48:28] ammonites spirit is a blocking hindering
[48:30] spirit that opposed their advances in
[48:35] the kingdom and so when we're speaking
[48:38] of these tribes we're speaking of evil
[48:41] spirits that are at work in this
[48:42] generation even as they've worked in all
[48:45] generations let me just let me say this
[48:54] with brother Branham never has there
[48:58] been a ministry since the time of Jesus
[49:01] Christ that the spirits were so exposed
[49:08] for what they were listen you don't have
[49:12] to have another man come and explain to
[49:14] you to tell you whether brother Branham
[49:16] was right or wrong on this you just go
[49:18] look for yourself
[49:20] if you let another man tell you what it
[49:23] is you're lazy if you only believe it
[49:27] because of another man amen you're lazy
[49:30] and you're not really concerned about
[49:34] the condition of your soul amen but God
[49:38] sent you a message so great a man that a
[49:41] prophet would say you could hide from
[49:43] the doctors but you cannot hide from God
[49:47] until the enemy spirit was so exposed in
[49:51] this hour not just the show he's exposed
[49:55] but to show your position hey hey that's
[49:59] why Nehemiah would look at those men and
[50:01] they would say you don't have a right to
[50:02] build here don't you know what the King
[50:04] law said hey man don't you know all
[50:05] these things but he had a message and he
[50:08] had a seal he'd been in the presence of
[50:10] the king himself he knew what he was
[50:14] talking about
[50:16] I know I had my watch set on a timer I
[50:27] don't know if it's gonna do any good
[50:29] brother Ram said the message faith 1956
[50:33] he talked about the maniac that came on
[50:36] the platform and and was going to break
[50:41] every bone in his body
[50:42] he'd been a problem with other meetings
[50:45] and he said but I looked and he said it
[50:48] may sound strange I heard myself talking
[50:50] but it was a Holy Spirit speaking was a
[50:53] Bible says take no thought what you
[50:54] shall say but it'll be added to you then
[50:57] and I said because you have defied the
[50:59] Spirit of God tonight you'll fall over
[51:01] my feet
[51:02] see brother man I wasn't thinking of
[51:04] saying that that's what the Holy Spirit
[51:06] said and he said well I'll show you
[51:09] whose feet I'll fall over and I you
[51:11] understand he thought he was talking to
[51:12] the messenger he thought he was defying
[51:19] God's man he was only looking at the
[51:23] cover God was using and he said I'll
[51:26] show you whose feet I'll fall over and
[51:28] he put his hand back to hit him and he
[51:33] said I said Satan come out of the man in
[51:35] the name of the Lord Jesus and he had
[51:38] his arm back to strike and he started
[51:40] going 200 and his eyes rolled back and
[51:42] he started going around and around and
[51:44] he fell down and laid across my feet and
[51:46] I couldn't move anyway so there had been
[51:48] a challenge made and the Spirit of God
[51:51] and the spirit was in him both of them
[51:55] made a challenge so then something had
[51:59] to happen oh my the policeman in the
[52:04] audience was waiting the policeman says
[52:05] the man did I said no sir they said as
[52:07] he healed I said no sir he worships that
[52:09] spirit he won't give it up do you
[52:11] realize there's some people that close
[52:16] to the Kings message but won't give up
[52:21] the spirit that's in him and he wouldn't
[52:24] give it up
[52:25] and he said he said he worships him that
[52:29] spirit he won't give it up he said but
[52:31] he said but I wish you would move him
[52:35] off of my feet so when they got over
[52:39] there I just turned around with the only
[52:40] as I said as I was saying faith is the
[52:43] substance of things hoped for and a man
[52:45] sitting in a wheelchair just raised up a
[52:48] lady on the stretcher and just got up
[52:51] everything in there was healed right
[52:53] there and they packed them away and the
[52:55] next morning great big truck going down
[52:57] the street and people singing only
[52:58] believe walking behind this big truck
[53:00] full of stretchers and wheelchairs and
[53:02] everything he said what was it the chief
[53:05] of that tribe of demons hindering
[53:09] Malakand spirit the chief of the tribe
[53:12] of demons had made the challenge and
[53:14] lost it and that's when the Spirit of
[53:20] God struck the building and everything
[53:21] was healed you see it's not that the
[53:25] Spirit of God is not here to strike the
[53:27] building but there's a blocking
[53:29] hindering spirit that has to be
[53:31] addressed
[53:33] Nehemiah knew if I got a Kings message
[53:36] amen with the Kings inspiration to
[53:39] restore then I have a right to tell
[53:41] those men they have no right here in
[53:43] this city they have no place here in
[53:46] this city
[53:46] they have no Memorial here remember
[53:54] these spirits of tribes is what hindered
[53:58] the children of Israel from having
[53:59] complete victory in the revelation of
[54:01] the promised land
[54:04] let's just stop a little bit look at the
[54:06] ammonites and the Moabites i'm just
[54:09] trying to give you a history lesson but
[54:10] to show you what their nature is and
[54:12] you'll find out you've met these the
[54:16] ammonite people are descendants of lot
[54:18] and they're a constant enemy of Israel
[54:22] they're a generational enemy this is not
[54:24] a one-time event that I'm talking about
[54:25] this is just the last event of the Old
[54:27] Testament that they come against Israel
[54:30] they've been cursed by God because it
[54:32] cannot enter into the congregation of
[54:34] the Lord because they never helped
[54:37] Israel in
[54:38] their Exodus I want you understand
[54:41] there's a people who are not interested
[54:44] in you going to your promise so they're
[54:49] gonna say anything against it because
[54:52] they're not there to help you go into
[54:54] the Promised Land they're there to stop
[54:56] you and they were relatives of Israel no
[55:04] no that's not what you think it is no
[55:05] brother branham didn't mean it that way
[55:07] no no you're not supposed to sing like
[55:09] that no that's not what see blocking
[55:11] hindering spirits something that will
[55:13] just try to cause doubt to rise up in
[55:15] your mind and that doubt will hinder the
[55:18] move of the Holy Spirit no no we don't
[55:20] need the Holy Spirit to move like that
[55:21] anymore that was just for them back
[55:23] there you know come on Israel you know
[55:25] that Exodus is not for you I'm not gonna
[55:27] let you through my land you can't come
[55:30] through my land singing like that you
[55:33] can't come through my land walking like
[55:35] that oh I think I know that spirit I
[55:41] think it's still alive it's probably
[55:45] even here tonight oh I'm not saying
[55:48] people I'm saying spirits that spirit
[55:50] I'll anoint your mind the Exodus isn't
[55:56] for you now you see these ammonites
[56:00] weren't real powerful people they were
[56:03] just blockers that would join themselves
[56:06] with others against the cause the
[56:10] Moabites weren't real powerful people
[56:11] they had to go get hireling prophets
[56:14] they didn't have the power in themself
[56:16] we can get somebody to curse Israel
[56:18] because I know listen I know some of the
[56:21] secret places here in this church and
[56:23] let me tell you about them I can bring
[56:25] you to some places and show you some
[56:26] Whoopi doozies and run spencer's Church
[56:29] it's gonna blow your mind your have your
[56:33] wanna curse them when you get done well
[56:37] let me tell you some problems in this
[56:38] message I can show you some real
[56:41] problems you know that man was not of
[56:43] God he called himself a prophet but let
[56:45] me just tell you I can show you some
[56:47] places in these people that could never
[56:49] be the children of God
[56:52] that spirit is still alive if you don't
[56:55] he don't walk in robes and in the Old
[56:57] Testament carb but he got websites and
[57:00] he's got all kinds of things to attract
[57:02] our weak ones and they go around and say
[57:04] I can go to the hot parts the parts you
[57:06] can't climb too and I can show you
[57:08] things about this message and never knew
[57:11] come on Balaam personal amen God said I
[57:14] told you not to go down there and curse
[57:16] them but if you try you open up your
[57:18] mouth I'm gonna put my words in them
[57:21] you're just a hireling anyway you don't
[57:24] have enough your donkey's more spiritual
[57:26] than you are come on let me tell you
[57:31] because at least they could see the
[57:33] angel of the Lord and they could see the
[57:35] move of the Holy Spirit then we got some
[57:41] blocking hindering spirits in this heart
[57:43] that try to come against the prophet of
[57:45] God but I they did the same with Moses
[57:48] but I want you to know something the
[57:50] shout of the king is in this camp
[57:53] [Applause]
[58:00] I said the shout of the king is in this
[58:04] camp they may not see him but God is
[58:07] here who is a king of glory he's a Lord
[58:15] mighty in battle who is this ham a
[58:21] knight who is just smaller by that said
[58:24] they know more about this message Amen
[58:27] than what God does
[58:35] listen me the name of the Lord you may
[58:38] save William branham's a false prophet
[58:40] but if you go back and read your Bible
[58:42] you'll find out he had exactly that
[58:44] Elijah's spirit in him and you'll find
[58:46] out a min that Malachi which means my
[58:49] messenger stood there and rebuked the
[58:51] priesthood that's why they don't want
[58:54] William Brandon's message this is why
[58:56] I'm against organized religion this is
[58:59] why I'm against Jezebel religion that
[59:03] should be the name of the Lord the shout
[59:05] of the king is in the camp
[59:08] [Applause]
[59:22] his spirit says you're not gonna make it
[59:24] his spirit says you're not gonna go
[59:27] through he spirit says that's all you do
[59:29] is stand up and clap that's all God you
[59:31] got well maybe that's what you're called
[59:32] to do David a man he had a revelation of
[59:38] it he said I'd rather be a doorkeeper in
[59:40] the house of God you know why he said
[59:43] that because he heard what Moses said
[59:45] about the sons of Korah about Korah who
[59:47] see he said go back to your tents of
[59:49] wickedness David said I'd rather be a
[59:51] doorkeeper in the house of God in the
[59:53] dwell and the tents of wickedness Amen
[59:55] I'd better be the guy that opens the
[59:57] door and welcomes you in because that's
[59:59] where God is let me tell you something
[1:00:02] God is in this message this is God's
[1:00:05] message this is the King's message to
[1:00:08] you this is your hour of restoration
[1:00:11] this is your city this is your
[1:00:14] revelation you gonna let some emanate
[1:00:20] you're gonna let some Moabite Amen not
[1:00:23] tell you that tell you it's not yours
[1:00:27] I'll tell you what I say you have no
[1:00:30] right in this word
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:37] let me tell you something on Balaam just
[1:00:40] because you got a computer don't mean
[1:00:42] you got a revelation just because you're
[1:00:47] a printer don't mean you know what the
[1:00:48] Prophet says just because you can preach
[1:00:52] don't mean your card just because you
[1:00:57] got charisma don't mean you have Amen
[1:00:59] the inspiration of God behind it don't
[1:01:03] give me your letters and letters aren't
[1:01:09] for me they're on your father locked
[1:01:13] who wants long what was a man who could
[1:01:17] walk with the message but couldn't go
[1:01:19] all the way with the message that's who
[1:01:21] their father was they had an
[1:01:27] illegitimate birth that's the problem
[1:01:34] he's been these ammonites these Moabites
[1:01:38] came out of incestuous relationship with
[1:01:41] lot who couldn't walk with Abraham's
[1:01:44] message and chose the green plains of
[1:01:47] Sodom to live and even when the angel
[1:01:50] came to save him and said come quickly I
[1:01:52] can do nothing until you come hither he
[1:01:55] said don't let me go to that mountain
[1:01:58] let me go to that city always trying to
[1:02:01] change this is that spirit they can't go
[1:02:07] all the way and then get in the
[1:02:11] congregation these spirits get in the
[1:02:12] congregation says give up did you hear
[1:02:15] what they said over there
[1:02:16] did you hear what they're saying about
[1:02:18] the message now did you actually realize
[1:02:22] William Branham didn't know what he was
[1:02:24] talking about didn't you know he was a
[1:02:26] deceiver let me just tell you what I do
[1:02:30] know
[1:02:34] one thing I do know is I've heard your
[1:02:37] voice before and your voice comes from
[1:02:41] illegitimate sea you've never been born
[1:02:44] right that's what your problem is so if
[1:02:47] you've never been born right why would I
[1:02:49] let somebody who's not been born right
[1:02:51] try to tell me how a prophet cells ain't
[1:02:58] gonna know what it means anyhow they
[1:03:02] better go buy some donkey so they can
[1:03:04] understand what God is saying let me
[1:03:12] just tell you something comes a time you
[1:03:16] get shocked why people begin falling
[1:03:18] away and you go oh how can this be but
[1:03:21] after wise they keep on doing they don't
[1:03:22] get shocked anymore I get angry who do
[1:03:27] you think you are to try to stand up and
[1:03:30] say I know more about that pillar fire
[1:03:32] then the man came in the cities here a
[1:03:35] man I know this my grandmother set right
[1:03:38] in front of him he told her who she was
[1:03:39] a man he told her whatever her problem
[1:03:42] was she was healed of it from that day
[1:03:44] forward I saw my grandmother died she
[1:03:46] never went to hell but the angels of God
[1:03:48] came and carried her over onto the other
[1:03:50] side let me tell you something about
[1:03:53] this message this message don't produce
[1:03:56] a bunch of locks that go back to the
[1:03:58] world this message does not produce a
[1:04:00] bunch of ammonites you can't go all the
[1:04:02] way this message produces sons and
[1:04:05] daughters of God that should be the name
[1:04:11] of the Lord
[1:04:11] [Applause]
[1:04:14] I don't need a history lesson on the
[1:04:19] message of william branham to know that
[1:04:21] this message is right all I gotta do is
[1:04:23] look right there and say there's a proof
[1:04:26] this message is the proof of his
[1:04:29] resurrection new people
[1:04:33] [Applause]
[1:04:53] you know what them spirits of ammonites
[1:04:55] you know what those spirits told Jeptha
[1:04:58] said that's our land give us our land we
[1:05:00] want our land
[1:05:01] it wasn't Israel's land you know what
[1:05:05] jephthah told them he said Who am I to
[1:05:09] give back what God dispossessed from you
[1:05:13] if God took it from you let your God
[1:05:16] take it back let me tell you about all
[1:05:20] these detractors here's what they can do
[1:05:21] they can say what's wrong but they can't
[1:05:24] get back what they once thought they had
[1:05:29] they once sang with you they once raised
[1:05:32] their hands with you but they had no
[1:05:34] right North portion Norma Morial God
[1:05:37] couldn't find their name a member what
[1:05:40] did he do he brought up out of Babylon
[1:05:41] people out of the cursed city of Jericho
[1:05:44] they had names they said I'm from
[1:05:46] Jericho God says come on up you can come
[1:05:48] in this land and help restore it but God
[1:05:50] never called the ammonite and he never
[1:05:52] called them all back to be part of the
[1:05:54] restoration God doesn't need any spirit
[1:06:05] that knows more than him about
[1:06:06] restoration to help you see that was
[1:06:10] Satan's problem oh we're finding out
[1:06:11] really where there's a man died spirit
[1:06:12] come from Satan's problem thought he
[1:06:14] would be God Satan thought I can be
[1:06:19] worshipped let me tell you if somebody
[1:06:23] will know more than God about creation
[1:06:24] they're going to know more than William
[1:06:25] Branham about his message and they're
[1:06:28] going to tell you that boy in Finland
[1:06:29] wasn't raised from the dead they're
[1:06:32] going to tell you the cloud wasn't what
[1:06:33] you thought it was let me just want you
[1:06:37] to know something I am NOT interested in
[1:06:40] hearing to buy a tell me why the laws
[1:06:42] can't be built
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:46] you see toe bio was called a servant he
[1:06:49] presented himself as a minister for
[1:06:51] years and he actually had wedded his way
[1:06:56] into the priesthood
[1:06:58] Eli should the high priest he was
[1:07:03] actually built gave him a room in one of
[1:07:05] the storage rooms of the temple he had a
[1:07:07] room in the house of God uh ma'am and I
[1:07:11] had a room in the house of God where the
[1:07:13] treasure was stored no wonder these guys
[1:07:15] know so much about the message I mean if
[1:07:19] you live where the treasures are you're
[1:07:21] probably going to get a little curious
[1:07:22] about what's in them and what's wild to
[1:07:27] buy I could come out of that room and
[1:07:28] quote a message but it didn't mean it
[1:07:31] was his brother Danny are you mad
[1:07:36] absolutely I'm furious what I'm furious
[1:07:40] about is that we don't realize that
[1:07:42] these spirits when they keep us from our
[1:07:44] victory they don't want you to stand up
[1:07:48] and say these are my children this is my
[1:07:51] home I've deal with so many discouraged
[1:07:56] depressed people that call themselves
[1:07:58] saints of the Most High
[1:07:59] I want to tell you the first step of
[1:08:01] victory is your attitude
[1:08:07] the first step of your children coming
[1:08:10] back home is you telling God I thank you
[1:08:12] for bringing them back home your first
[1:08:15] step of healing is say God I thank you
[1:08:18] for Isaiah 53 I can put my name in there
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:22] Danny a man was healed by those stripes
[1:08:26] you know why I have a portion I have a
[1:08:30] right I have a memorial I don't have
[1:08:34] spiritual amnesia anymore
[1:08:44] you don't know it but I've already done
[1:08:46] three somersaults Alleluia you know it'd
[1:08:57] be awesome to see a German do a
[1:08:58] somersault wouldn't it bullets flying
[1:09:00] everywhere and rust and everything else
[1:09:03] anyway and there's another thing when
[1:09:07] when Jeff had told those ammonites that
[1:09:10] you know they're going to take the land
[1:09:12] as the Bible said they wouldn't listen
[1:09:14] to the words of Jeff though I've heard
[1:09:16] that guy I've met that guy he wouldn't
[1:09:18] listen
[1:09:19] I never said what he looked like
[1:09:23] so don't ask me there's another
[1:09:27] scripture let's just go to first samuel
[1:09:30] 11 we're just we're reading their
[1:09:31] history their history is not a good one
[1:09:37] I'll close soon Tobiah asked when are
[1:09:44] you going to close
[1:09:51] don't you know the most successful
[1:09:53] services are 45 minutes I've been in the
[1:09:56] Kings treasure room I'm gonna tell you
[1:10:01] something to buy it by the time this
[1:10:03] church gets done with you you're not
[1:10:04] gonna have a cot in there there's not
[1:10:05] going to be a hangar in there with your
[1:10:07] clothes on it you're gonna be out of the
[1:10:08] house of God you're gonna be away away
[1:10:11] from them because you don't have a right
[1:10:13] here do we understand that when we begin
[1:10:16] to become in harmony with the world
[1:10:18] brother ham says Amen that we become in
[1:10:20] harmony together he said in five minutes
[1:10:22] time there wouldn't be one sick person
[1:10:24] in the building there wouldn't be one
[1:10:26] person designed the Holy Ghost but they
[1:10:28] would get it and I say let's get
[1:10:32] symbolic in the ho Enda and to buy in
[1:10:35] the Arabians out of here I don't need no
[1:10:39] wandering spirit in my congregation
[1:10:41] wonder if this is right
[1:10:43] wonder if that's right let me tell you
[1:10:45] this message is right I don't need no
[1:10:52] Arabians
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:11:00] okay you better strike that part because
[1:11:04] in this political age and he said you
[1:11:06] hear that racist preacher he said they
[1:11:07] didn't need Arabians in that church just
[1:11:12] that's the way to buy it is you don't
[1:11:15] get it well let's look at another
[1:11:19] ammonite for just a minute this is his
[1:11:21] ancestors first the First Samuel 11:1
[1:11:24] then a hash the ammonite came and
[1:11:25] encamped against jabish Khalid in all
[1:11:27] the minute jabish said unto nae hash
[1:11:29] make a covenant with us and we're serve
[1:11:31] you you know jay-bez means dry these
[1:11:36] people lived in a dry place and they're
[1:11:39] always willing to make a covenant a
[1:11:42] compromise what somebody seems to have
[1:11:48] power over them and they has the
[1:11:52] ammonite answered them on this condition
[1:11:53] I'll make a covenant with you that I'll
[1:11:55] thrust out your right eyes and lay up
[1:11:56] for a reproach upon Israel and the
[1:11:59] elders of Jabez sudden him give us seven
[1:12:01] days respite that we may send messengers
[1:12:04] into all the coasts of Israel and then
[1:12:05] if there's no man to save us we'll come
[1:12:07] out to thee you see we're going to look
[1:12:10] for a savior for seven days if we can't
[1:12:13] find anybody to answer this question
[1:12:15] we're come out and make a covenant with
[1:12:17] you and we'll let you go ahead and poke
[1:12:20] out our right eyes you know what that
[1:12:22] meant in the antiquity they said they
[1:12:24] said they poked out the right eye was
[1:12:26] that was the eye that would look over
[1:12:28] the shield that they would hold in
[1:12:29] battle and they'd poke out their eye
[1:12:32] that could look that means they couldn't
[1:12:35] find any more since that old ammonites
[1:12:41] spirit he wants to make a covenant with
[1:12:44] you just give us seven days and then
[1:12:47] came the messengers to give you a saw
[1:12:49] and told the tidings in the ears of the
[1:12:50] people and all the people lift up the
[1:12:52] voice and sang songs of victory and says
[1:12:55] they wept just the problem they accept
[1:12:57] anything to devil try just shut down
[1:12:59] their throat and behold Saul came after
[1:13:04] the herd out of the field and Saul said
[1:13:07] what aileth the people that they weep
[1:13:08] and they told him the timings of the
[1:13:09] meningitis and the Spirit of God came
[1:13:12] upon saw
[1:13:13] when he heard those tidings and his
[1:13:15] anger was current kindled greatly you
[1:13:19] know needed to happen him in the spirit
[1:13:22] of God needed to stir up the spirits of
[1:13:24] man amen so that they could see with the
[1:13:27] greater vision than what the ham and I
[1:13:29] was trying to give him neh hash means
[1:13:33] serpent so here's this man called
[1:13:36] serpent who is trying to make a covenant
[1:13:39] with them something that would seem
[1:13:41] greater than the promise they already
[1:13:44] had God had already told him there
[1:13:47] Abraham seed God had said Abraham's seed
[1:13:49] would possess the gate of his enemies
[1:13:50] and here comes the enemy saying make a
[1:13:53] covenant with me and they said if we
[1:13:55] can't find a Savior in seven days we'll
[1:13:58] do it well let me tell you hey man we've
[1:14:00] been through the dark ages we're not in
[1:14:02] the Dark Ages anymore the spirit have
[1:14:05] come the spirit has come and kindled
[1:14:07] greatly in this hour upon men and women
[1:14:12] of God hey man brother Branham said it
[1:14:15] like this is this all right that I go
[1:14:17] just a little bit further I won't hold
[1:14:19] you much longer but I sure didn't get to
[1:14:21] bye and all these guys fixed but they're
[1:14:25] fixed anyhow we all know the story of
[1:14:32] brother Branham what he went through how
[1:14:35] he lost his wife and his baby daughter
[1:14:37] how Satan moved up and tried to make a
[1:14:40] covenant with him because he was in a
[1:14:43] dry place you would be too if you just
[1:14:46] lost your wife and your daughter's dying
[1:14:48] and you're seeing her suffering so hard
[1:14:49] her eyes are cross and the Flies are on
[1:14:51] her body brother BAM said because he
[1:14:56] refused to walk the way God had called
[1:14:58] him to walk that he suffered greatly for
[1:15:01] it he said his church dwindled his daddy
[1:15:03] died his brother died his mother died or
[1:15:05] sorry his his wife died and his baby
[1:15:08] daughter died many things was attributed
[1:15:11] to that wrong decision and in that dry
[1:15:15] time of the Prophet Satan moved up said
[1:15:19] after all that God has done for you you
[1:15:22] prayed for people and they've been
[1:15:23] healed you preached the gospel
[1:15:27] all that you've done for God and now
[1:15:31] when your daughter is dying and you ask
[1:15:34] God to heal there he won't even answer
[1:15:39] your prayer because a black sheet had
[1:15:43] fallen down in front of him it was very
[1:15:45] dry brother ben said i opened up my
[1:15:48] mouth to say that's right
[1:15:49] then if he'll be that way i'll no longer
[1:15:51] serve him he said i opened up my mouth
[1:15:54] to say that and when he did the Spirit
[1:15:58] of God moved up and says William Branham
[1:16:02] who are you anyhow and you know what it
[1:16:08] turned the whole situation around to
[1:16:11] where brother Branham says a naked I
[1:16:13] came into the world naked I go out
[1:16:14] though God slay me yet I'll trust him he
[1:16:17] laid his hand on his baby daughter says
[1:16:19] said honey I'm gonna see you again one
[1:16:21] day what was that he said it was an
[1:16:24] anchor that was down there that moved up
[1:16:27] I want to tell you about what happened
[1:16:30] there brother Graham said after that
[1:16:33] time there was a one cross-eyed baby
[1:16:35] that I saw that God wouldn't heal it
[1:16:42] brother Branham would look at that
[1:16:44] cross-eyed condition she said I hate
[1:16:46] that devil and he hates me you know
[1:16:53] brother I said when enjoy your stats
[1:16:55] clips baby died and he wrote a letter to
[1:16:58] him and I've got I've got the copy of it
[1:17:00] in my notes electronically not in paper
[1:17:05] everything's electronic nowadays I
[1:17:09] brother Bantam was writing them and he
[1:17:11] was talking to them about his baby dying
[1:17:13] about where he saw her and everything
[1:17:15] and he was just writing a consoling
[1:17:16] letter and he says you know I was
[1:17:17] thinking one day about all that I went
[1:17:20] through I'm just thinking I just
[1:17:22] couldn't go through that again but in
[1:17:25] something said but would you go through
[1:17:28] that again k said I looked and I saw all
[1:17:30] the souls that came to the Lord because
[1:17:33] of me telling that story and I saw all
[1:17:35] the thousands that were healed
[1:17:38] and he said I would go through it all
[1:17:44] over again let me tell you the enemy
[1:17:56] couldn't stop and then he's not going to
[1:18:00] stop him now I've told this testimony
[1:18:04] before I might have told it here and
[1:18:05] I'll close with this I I'll let go by
[1:18:09] and symbolic go to bed you're tired and
[1:18:13] the Arabian will wonder off somewhere
[1:18:17] but not in your bed not in your church
[1:18:22] like these hinder and blocking spirit
[1:18:24] says you don't have no right to build
[1:18:26] these walls let me tell you got a right
[1:18:28] to restoration I have got a right amen
[1:18:32] to pray over my family I've got a right
[1:18:34] to pray over my sister I got a right to
[1:18:37] pray over my family and say Satan you
[1:18:40] have no right over them give them back
[1:18:44] you got a right I've probably told this
[1:18:51] before here I don't know and you might
[1:18:53] have heard it but you're gonna hear it
[1:18:54] again because Satan doesn't like it I
[1:18:56] was in Mexico and a pastor there had
[1:18:59] told me this testimony about a brother
[1:19:01] who was dealing with the spirit and a
[1:19:03] girl and he told that girl right he said
[1:19:08] I tried to cast that spirit out and that
[1:19:10] spirit wouldn't move and he said I did
[1:19:12] everything I knew how to get that spirit
[1:19:13] out he said it wouldn't move and
[1:19:15] eventually it spoke out of that girl on
[1:19:16] a man's voice said she's mine there's
[1:19:18] nothing you can do to make me come out
[1:19:21] he said then a thought flashed across me
[1:19:24] and I went and got a book of brother
[1:19:28] branham that had the picture of the
[1:19:29] pillar of fire in it and I brought that
[1:19:32] book back to the girl and I opened it up
[1:19:34] to that picture of the pillar of fire
[1:19:36] and I said do you know who this man is
[1:19:40] they said that voice spoke back out of
[1:19:42] the girl said that's William Branham I
[1:19:44] was cast out of one of his services in
[1:19:47] Jonesboro Arkansas
[1:19:51] okay now this is decades later and that
[1:19:55] man stood there and said then in the
[1:19:58] name of jesus christ whom william
[1:20:00] branham preached come out of the girl
[1:20:02] and the girl was free now I want to tell
[1:20:06] you something people have forgot people
[1:20:15] have forgot what the glory of God was
[1:20:16] like and is like people doubt it but I
[1:20:20] want to tell you this the devil is
[1:20:22] scared to death that you will realize it
[1:20:28] because if he still remembering church
[1:20:31] services that he was cast out decades
[1:20:33] ago
[1:20:34] why don't we refresh his memory again
[1:20:36] and why don't we show him what it's like
[1:20:41] amen to do it today and tell that devil
[1:20:45] you don't have no right here you don't
[1:20:48] have no right to live in my home you
[1:20:50] don't have no right to block my children
[1:20:52] from receiving the Holy Spirit
