lord jesus lord even when we're in our good times and in our bads father lord you're there you're always there and you made us a promise that you would never leave us and you never forsake us father and lord you see these many hands that have been lifted up unto you father not unto a man nor out of tradition lord nor because somebody beside them lifted their hand but their hearts are heavy with needs lord with burdens and lord they're desiring that the god of heaven would come and minister unto them tonight lord i'm your servant lord jesus but i pray that you would set me over in a corner lord jesus and and use this vessel lord take these 16 elements father lord as you took those same sixteen elements and you stepped into a body in your fellowship with abraham would you come and fellowship with your bride here in elkton virginia and those that are streaming this or by the way of the internet or archiving father we're asking lord that you'd bless your children by your your

miracles may there be signs and wonders that will take place here tonight hearts restored needs met father because that's who you are the god of the bible and we take you at your word lord and we ask god that you'd bless the reading of the word in jesus christ's name amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of first corinthians chapter 10 first corinthians chapter 10 and then down to john chapter john chapter four verse 10. first corinthians chapter 10 moreover brethren i would not that you should be ignorant how that all your fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ john chapter 4 and verse 10 we know that there's a very familiar scripture reading unto us as the bride of jesus christ our prophet would he would draw from this text over and over again after every prayer line he would speak of this text and we realized that that the bible tells us we could read it all but you all know the story but just to grab the context of it we realize that jesus said that he needs go by samaria there was a woman that was waiting on him and you know the story verse 10 and jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well was deep from whence then hast thou that living water art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life verse 25 and the woman said unto him i know that the messiah cometh when he which is which is called christ when he has come he will tell us all things and jesus said unto her i that speak unto thee am he may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to speak to you this evening just for a moment on i am he the living water i am he the living water brother branham said here in spiritual food and due season he said i want you to get built up now in the holy oracles of god in the faith in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight and all that you have seen and heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it be that be that god or not we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart consider it whether it that be god or not it's like elisha of old said if god be god then serve him and if jesus if jesus is the center of all things to the christian then i think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him that word accumulate it means to gather together and i believe that as as a church of the living god there are some things that we can gather together to recognize that the i am is still amongst the church of the living god when so many people are saying that that he's dead he's a dead god and it doesn't perform miracles anymore and that that things don't happen like they used to but we recognize that the same elohim that was there that was fellowshipping with abraham back there at the tent door that same melchizedek that came to him and took upon flesh he stepped into a theophany that same melchizedek has been it at the bride of jesus christ tent door and in the ministry of malachi 4 we can simply we can simply just look at just maybe one sermon and you can see that the i am was present through the ministry of malachi of war you could take any of these you could take any of these brothers ministries and you can look and see that the i am is still amongst the bride of jesus christ you can take one church service you can take one one little simple wednesday night or one saturday night service and you can take it and you can look at it as a whole and you can see the changes on people's lives and you can see the effects that the i am has upon the church of the living god and you can accumulate those things you can gather them together and you can say that the i am is amongst the church of the living god you can you can say he's not a god that's gone by you can say he's not a god that used to do those things but you can say that he's not just a god of yesterday but he is the god of today and brother branham would tell us he said the ability to be able to discern the heart and thoughts in men made the elect of god to understand that here was the messiah the anointed word of god and that's where you always watch the elect of god catching is when the hearts begin to get discerned and their thoughts begin to be get told to them things that they've been thinking about you recognize that the messiah is in the midst of that church or in the midst of the elect and you watch maybe maybe tonight the spirit of the lord will take a man of god and he'll he'll come down through your tin can alley and he'll start discerning your heart of things that you spoke about and things that you've had a conversation with your family about what is it it is the same i am it is the messiah that is working through his body that is speaking through human lips he uses human beings to redeem human beings and he's taking the word of life and he's bringing living water into souls so that they can be a water source to a dying generation that they can look that there is a source down here in laodicea there is a people there is a source of the holy ghost and i want to know where those people got that from i want to understand how they've come in contact with that kind of god and you are a water source to a dying generation to a world that is a desert you are an oasis in a desert place and the church of the living god has the great i am right in the midst of her and she doesn't take it for granted she doesn't underestimate and she doesn't just expect it but she understands that the word of god is going to prove that he's still the same yesterday today and forever in the ministry brother branham you go back and you start studying out you start studying out just just key words or certain things but over 135 times william branham stood there and when he was speaking to a patient he would say you're not from here now i've done a lot of studies throughout the message and i never heard anybody on that prayer line ever stand up and say no i'm not or you're wrong but what was it it was the messiah that was standing right there at the platform he said that angel standing in between me and you he said you feel a sweet spirit what was it it was the i am maybe he'd show up in the pillar of fire or maybe he'd show up in a in a whirlwind or maybe he'd show up in maybe at the pool of besides and he would stir up the waters and people would get healed what was it it was the same i am and what is it tonight with if you let your faith loose to to say that that same god is right here what is it it's not the man it's not the atmosphere it's not the man that creates the atmosphere it's the atmosphere where eagles are born at and you'll recognize that that is the same one it's not the man william branham that we got confidence in it's the angel at the pulpit that was standing there and was directing him he said if the angel didn't come i'd have been wrong on those seals but that angel was not willing that this message would perish and it would go off to one side or go off to the other but it would be this message that would give this people rapturing faith and he was proving that he's still the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] what is it it's the word being made flesh again that's what brother branham would say he said in christ is revealed in his own he said it's the word of god wound up in flesh you see it was a word it was a word in the attributes it was the word in the very beginning but here what what john said in john 1 14 that the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us what was it it was the word wound up it was you've seen portions of it's in the prophets you've seen portion of it's in jeremiah you've seen portions of it in moses but when it come to jesus the word of god made flesh was wound up in the person and it took on flesh it operated in the flesh he got sick in the flesh he got tired in the flesh what is it god is once again wounding up himself in a body that will be wound up in the meeting and the changing in the meeting of the air that same i am is right here and that's what the bible said that he would be called that his name would be called elohim his name would be called emmanuel and to think that tonight that standing in the midst of the church of the living god is our advocate our lamb of god the resurrection and the life he is the shepherd and the bishop of our souls he is our judge he is the lord of lords the bible said that he's a man of sorrows the bible said he's the head of the church the bible said he's a master he says he's a faith one true witness and the bible said he's the rock the bible said he's a high priest it says that he's the door he should be called the living water he shall be called the bread of life he shall be called the rose of sharon he shall be called alpha and omega he is the true vine he is the messiah he is the teacher he is the holy one he is the mediator between god and man he is the beloved he is the holy one he is the branch he is the carpenter he is the good shepherd he is the light of the world oh is anybody tired of hearing about what your god is he is the chief cornerstone he is my savior he is the servant he is the author and a finisher of our faith he is the almighty he is the everlasting father he is our peace he is the lion of the tribe of judah he is the i am he is the king of kings he's the prince of peace he's our bridegroom he's the only begotten son he is wonderful he is counselor he is emmanuel he is the son of man he is my dayspring he is the amen he's the son of man he's the king of the jews he's the king of the prophets he is the redeemer he is my anchor he is my bright and morning star he is the way he is the truth and he is the life i wonder if you know what his name is those are all of his titles but his name is jesus and there is no other name there is no other power other than his name jesus christ where men should be saved by that name every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess he is the i am he is the healer of cancer he is the healer of sugar diabetes he is the healer he is the waymaker he is the promise keeper he is the i am who shall i say sent me moses said and you shall say i am that i am he is the i i.m life only comes by the word of god too many times too many times people stand around and question the word of god when it's in this letter form too many times people can sit there and they can question with it but our prophet told us that when it's made manifest nobody can reason with it when it becomes a reality you see all of those men could stand there and they could say that a messiah was coming but when the messiah was standing there it was the light of the word that had shown on the product of the word and here he is to think that tonight they'd been looking for him but when he was standing there they didn't have no more questions the elect didn't have no questions the unelected i'll say this to the church of the living god i understand our prophet said there's three kind of believers in every church but to the real believer tonight and i'm going to preach to you like you are but to the real believer it's no deception it's no question what is going on here it's the i am that is amongst you and you recognize it's the same messiah that was there walking on the shores of galilee and he's coming by your way to minister to your heart well you go you go to looking at a scripture reading you look at it at the natural and you see what drove the woman to the well she was looking for a source and to think that the bible said that jesus was weary and he was longing for a drink and he's told his disciples to go up there go on up there and get us some victims get give me something i'm hungry and here he goes up there and he said no i'm just going to wait up here at this whale but to think that what was a drawing what was the drawing of the natural it was a water source but look at it in the spiritual what was it it was a drawing source of the living water that was drawing these two together as i read that quote to you last weekend that predestinated seed when the water struck it it came to life and this this gene the seed of god was led by this whale now i want you to picture yourself tonight i want you to look i i want you to see jesus coming to your well tonight coming to you wherever you are and recognizing he is i am he's the i am of back problems he's the i am of troubles he's the i am of feelings he's the i am of emotions he's the i am of your problems of financial problems he is your protector he is your defender and he's come to set on a well tonight i know you've heard this a thousand times maybe ten thousand times of jesus sitting on a well but tonight he wants to set it your way tonight he wants to call your name tonight he wants to discern your heart he had a need to go by elkton now notice as webster said here about thirst he said it's a painful desire a painful a painful desire it's when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you he said brother and said it's not an unnatural thing to thirst he said thirst is a natural thing he said it's simply something that god has given us that we could to give us a desire for something sometimes that god always has given you a control tower something that sets inside of you that controls these different desires and now this thirst the control tower that sits in a man's heart is something that god give him to warn him of the desires that's needful for him to think that tonight if you didn't get thirsty you die you can go without eating for about three weeks to a month but you can't live without water but every two or three days you gotta have it but god put something on the inside of you that would make you long for it it's a painful desire you ever been that thirsty man you drink muddy water you've been that thirsty well i ain't there nobody too too hungry or too thirsty here you i don't see too many people it's got mud around their lips but if you ever get real thirsty you'll drink from any source and a lot of times when you get real thirsty you'll start drinking from a source that ain't got living water in it it's got wiggle tails in it and what the problem is is showing you that god built you for something it's something on the inside of you that's calling for real life and you don't have to satisfy with a wiggle tail experience you don't have to satisfy with muddy water you don't have to satisfy with a muddy experience but there is a living water that is flowing from the fountain that was opened up in zechariah 13 that there is a fountain open in the house of david david said in psalms 36 and 9 that he is the fountain of life you don't have to satisfy yourself with the things of the world and the carry-on on the world but this bride has got a source and ain't never ran dry [Applause] you get thirsty enough you'll hunt for it it's a painful desire and sometimes you've got such a painful desire for healing for deliverance and maybe sometimes you just need a hug from god and if you get thirsty enough for it you'll find him i'm telling you if you get thirsty enough tonight in this service you might be on the stream all the way across the world but if you get thirsty enough tonight god will take me by the reins and pull me right to your knee it might be painful but it's bringing you to a water source [Applause] motherhood said it's satan he perverts it he said the true nature of god and the true thirst of god the body and soul by lust for sin a perversion he said we find that on a person today he said the way they took that perversion and thirst for god the thirst for for the thirst for to be pretty and all of these thirst for water they've turned it into a satisfying not with drinking the thirst for joy everybody wants to have joy thirst for fellowship all these all these great thirsts that god put into us that we might thirst after him god made you to thirst after him and we try to satisfy it with some of the kind of thirst with some other kind of perversion or of the correct thirst goodness and who did that the author of lies created this perversion of thirst but the bible tells us that the holy spirit would be three things that it would be the it would be he would be the comforter he would tell us in john 16 and 13 that he would be the spirit of truth and he would guide you into all things that are true and we recognize what controlling power that we're under we're not under you're not here tonight under satan's power satan didn't lead you to church satan didn't lead you to this hillbilly church up here on this hill where a bunch of what so-called used to be knuckleheads have gathered around the revealed word that's going to put them in a body change it was not satan that led you here it was the holy ghost and that's holy ghost it's your controlling power that is leading you to the source who guided you here none other than the spirit of truth i i've been on some ventures sometimes in life where you need a god and if you ever get a god you want to make sure he's a good god whether you whether you're going down a raft or on a river you want to make sure he knows how to steer that ship ain't that right brother andy you don't want to get on a raft with just anybody but you want to get on a raft with jesus because if you're on a raft with jesus you ain't going to hold on to the chicken rope because he's going to make sure that you get down those swells he'll you'll make sure you get down the river safely and you'll be able to eat chicken and steak on the other side of the river he's going to take care of you if jesus is in your boat you want to make sure you got the right god i i know i know some of your brother's been on hunts and you need a guy you want to make sure he's a good guy you don't want him taking you some spike you want him taking you somewhere that there's something good at let me tell you you don't want some halfway preacher behind a pulpit that's guiding you down to some halfway watered-down gospel that'll never get you anywhere you want to find somebody that's god sent god called god led that can rightly divide the word of truth you want somebody that can guide you to where it really is [Applause] i i don't know maybe i'm maybe i'm telling stories out of school here but you ever been to a museum or maybe been to a place a lot of times you find them at a place of history and you go to this you go to a museum and you go through there and there they they you can't if you go through it on your own you ain't gonna find out half of what's in there you can try to read every sign but you're gonna miss it but they got these doohickeys that you can put in your ear and as you walk through as you walk through certain locations it'll tell you what you're seeing it'll tell you that this artifact was it was it was from the 1800s and and this was placed here by this king or that that president or this that or the other or maybe you're out of battlefield and you've got these things on you're listening to them and they're telling you what you're seeing now i went to i tried to find out how in the world does that do hickey tell me what i'm looking at how does it know it's got a gps on the inside of it and it tells you what location you're at and what location you're at it'll tell you a signal what you're seeing now if you were sitting there and that doohickey on your ear was telling you that you were looking at a a piece of heart that george washington painted himself and you're over here and you're looking at a bush that doohickey is wrong the voice is wrong with the location that you're at it might be true that there's a bush somewhere and it might be true that there's a painting somewhere but the voice has got mixed up where you are and where your location is but this voice that is leading you here has brought you to laodicea and this seventh angel's voice has told you where to get overcoming power out he's told you where you're living at he didn't tell you it was in a restless day or luther's day and tried to give you some creed he gave you the manna for this hour that'll make sure at the location that you are let me tell you noah's message wouldn't work this day moses message wouldn't work his day but this is the day of the revealing of the son of man and because you're in the light location because you where you are there's a gps tracker on you and it says you're going through this trial i'm isaiah 53 i'm going through this trouble i am the lord thy god that heals thee there's a voice that's leading you through what you're seeing and the voice is the voice of truth we ain't got some doohickey on our we got the voice it's the same one that's sitting at the throne room of our heart he cares what you're listening to you remember when brother manum said you go to listen that sermon to god he starts talking about that north star that it represents christ he said you don't want just some ordinary man leading you around you want somebody knows where they're going at you ever every man is going to be able to see a man right here i think where every wife's going to be elbowing him you ever been somewhere you ain't never been before and you get yourself turned around you're not lost you just turned around and finally you had to stop at some gas station your wife had to roll down the window and say ask him you're the one who drove me here asking that ain't happen to me yet but i've been a part of some things in life and i know what i'm talking about you see you were never lost you just didn't know exactly where you was at [Applause] praise god we can leave we've had church everybody's elbowed right now need prayers for ribs but you get a good god and i'll tell you you think you got a good guy by that name of siri and that thing will lead you right into a pond if you ain't too careful turn now better watch out you're going to turn into a cattle field and you're going to pray that you have the same love that william branham had when that bull comes running at you you want a god that's going to lead you down the right path and brother madam said that unthoughtful father up there that had seen that picture he'd seen that picture in that magazine of that deer standing on a mountaintop he took his son that had never been hunted before he's seven years old and he takes him to the son he said the biggest bucks are up there on that mountain and he said he starts tracking himself up there he didn't have a guide to go with him and when it got dark he got turned around and didn't know how to get off the mountain and it got cold and the boy lost his life because the father didn't take a god because it got too dark and brother branham said that's a problem with too many christians a day they've gone on past the darkness and went on without a god but he the spirit of truth is here to bring you to the light of the hour when william branham starts talking about he starts talking about when the children of israel when they got in their testing time and and the spirit of the lord is leading them the pillar of fire by night in the cloud cloud by day he's leading them and brother branham said that the church of israel had got into a testing time and they got there and they got the fussing with their leader they got to fussing with their leader and flustering about the path and how they were going and brother madam said they got led out there to whorehop which means a dry place or a desert and he said when we get out of fellowship with one another or in the church or fellowship with the holy spirit he said it brings us to a dry place a desert nothing's alive everything's got stickers on it he said but when you see somebody like that he said maybe it's a precious soul that could have been watered right he said it would have been tender little leaf or something but instead it's wound itself up till it's a little sticker and it's just punching at everything you know finding fault only thing its needs is just a little water well thank god we found a water source i'll just preach to these people on the internet you just come out you just come out of one of the greatest meetings that you ever had two weeks ago but how many found out in the past two weeks that you still human every single day you got to have a little bit more jesus it's me it's me it's me oh lord standing in a need our prayer he said but it's just needs a revival we just had one we just had one of the greatest revivals but you just need a revival or a breaking up or refreshing from the lord until it unfolds itself if you'll just put it through the water until you get out of laodicea until you take a body change you're gonna need some water you're gonna get around people and you're gonna get around problems that's gonna cross cause that little sticky nature satan will get in the details they're getting a lot of fuss and all of a sudden you get that sticky little nature punching at everything i'm quoting the prophet what you need is just a little bit of water he said but that's where them who live in that place has to suffer with the conditions of that place he said and those who desire to live in that kind of atmosphere where everything is punching and fussing and quarreling and stewing like that he said you just live under that atmosphere that's all he said but you don't have to live there it's not necessary for us to stay there he said but that now this horeb was a place where god was discouraged with the people because they had wandered in this place and gotten in that kind of condition and brought them right around to it because they wouldn't walk in the path to think that here is the greatest greatest prophet moses the moses the deliverer but yet they're quarreling with moses they're fighting with moses they're bickering with moses and god brings him up in exodus 17 he tells him go speak to the rock smite the rock and instead of god smiting the people with that judgment rod he smote the rock when all they were doing was murmuring and complaining what did he do he smote the rock which was a type of christ at calvary and when he smoked the rock out of it came living water to think of it to think of it when you deserved when you deserve to be smitten he was smitten for you and brother burnham said that that rock that was smitten will follow you everywhere it was a type of calvary and to think that thy rock it had their healing in it it had their desires in it it brought them salvation it brought perishing people to a place of refuge it brought life to a dying people what was it that rock was christ what does water represent it represents the spirit and when christ was smitten what come forth living water his spirit remember the man said he said he said now look he said i've seen all kinds of intellectual pictures about people drawing this little trickle of water coming out of this rock he said but this ain't some intellectual rock he said there was two million people that had need of supply of water there was two million cattle two million oxen two million camels that needed water this message ain't some intellectual rock it is the fundamental faith of jesus christ it's got enough for you right now it's got enough for your future and it's got enough for your past let me tell you it doesn't matter where you came from and it doesn't matter where you think you're going the rock is here to follow you out of that rock come gushing water the one that was smitten went with you they forgot notice they didn't follow the rock the rock followed them the rock followed them and when they got thirsty the rock was near when you're in trouble he is jehovah nessie when you in need he is jehovah niesi when you need him he is jehovah shammah when you need peace he is jehovah shalom when you need providing he is jehovah gyra it was too many times people think it's just just one feeling oh no when this comes out it's an abundance of water you go look it up you go look up you go look up on the internet moses smite in the rock and it'll show you that picture brother random's drawing this from he said it's just a little trickle water coming out of a little pipe but this is an artesian whale and out of it is flowing living water it's got enough for your children i know some of you i got a call today of a mama that was in complete despair i gotta have my prodigals back it was enough there's enough water in this rock for every prodigal for every wayward son for every wayward daughter for every wayward older person there's enough water in this rock he lost his power and he ain't lost his touch the same pillar of fire is here to lead the children of israel to their promised land it's an abundance of water that's what jesus said he said if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink and he that believeth on me as a scripture said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water notice rivers plural of living water not plural think it's one spirit by one spirit we're all baptized to think that he is our artesian well he is our water in a dry and weary land he was hagar's rock when ishmael when ishmael and hagar was kicked out by sarah he was hagar's rock in her bear sheep when she put ishmael a bow shot away from her he was her rock here this ain't the promised son i know i'm getting real touchy right here but here ain't the promise on but he's still come forth from abraham not everybody's going to be bright but they still get salvation from our lord and hear hagar's son ishmael history tells us that ismail was 16 years old at this time and she put him six she put him a bow shot away from her because she couldn't stand to see him die in a first but the angel said i heard they're crying from the lad that ought to give every single one of you hope tonight that think they'll never be bright or they'll never get to the water source he's heard your lads cry he was hagar's rock he is my rock he is my rock of defense he is my shelter in the storm he is my everything he said but people people are afraid of it to think we're living this quote out the people are afraid of the power of god they're afraid of this holy ghost they're afraid of this water he said people are afraid of it he said some people say well i'm just a little afraid i'll do this or that or the other or if i happen i'll go to i'll go go a little too deep he said i can or people say i can show you somebody that went a little too far he said but you never do point out the ones that didn't go far enough people always want to show you somebody that went too far and went off the deep end but they never want to show you they never want to show you judas and they never want to show you the rich wrong your lord i'd rather be thought a fanatic and be standing for christ than never go far enough some people are afraid well if i if i get in the spirit and i begin to dance and i begin to shout i wash this makeup right off my face i watch this or i watch what is it let me tell you if you're his seed the water will strike you and it doesn't matter what condition you are in it doesn't matter what you're running from this woman of john 4 was corrupted as any person could get corrupted she'd been to this water time and time and time again she went to jacob's well for relief and she didn't find no relief she went to men after men and she didn't find no relief and she'd go back to the well one day and she'd have to go back the next day and you may have walked to this same well many times but one time when he's sitting on the well the one time he starts calling out your name and he starts calling out your secrets about who you've been with and where you were he starts calling you out and think about the power of the place of this well you study it out in the scriptures it's a very remarkable place as being that where abraham first stopped on his coming from quran to canaan it was where god first appeared to abraham the patriarch and promised to give the land to a seed it was also the place where abraham first built an altar to the lord and called upon his name it is also this was the piece of property that jacob bought in genesis 33 and 19 and 20 that he made an altar and he erected that altar and called it el he aloha israel which means the strong god or the covenant god of israel now this woman that had walked to this well she'd been there time and time again she didn't need some weak man to lead her down the same paths that she'd already been down she needed a strong god the covenant god of israel to meet her brother branham said that she knew that she was at the spot of her life when our occupation was about over and you understand what i'm saying her life was about over her her occupation was about to be taken away from her but she's standing at the well with with the i am this woman nobody wanted her in her house this woman was looked down on this woman couldn't walk down the streets or walk down the aisles with people smirking at her people turning their cheeks at her thinking man this woman's of ill fame but she was standing at the spot she was standing at the very spot where joseph bones were buried at because joseph had told those children don't you bury my bones down there in his hand egypt you take my bones up there where the resurrection's coming joseph being a prophet knew that there was a messiah that was coming and to think where you're standing at right here in this town the gps hasn't brought you to some wrong spot he's brought you here because there's water here you've drunk water and you may even drunk message water one time but it didn't satisfy your soul because somebody was trying to put their own experience with the word but if this message is preached in its entirety if it's preached in its truth it'll produce the same life the same power she didn't need somebody else's watered-down gospel she needed jesus when he found me when he found me on the streets in canada i didn't need i didn't need some weak gospel i'd got myself in trouble after trouble after trouble what is it it's the grace of god that led you to the water you think well i'm too far gone or this one's too far gone when you think you're god too far gone the blood of jesus christ goes further mean i i i pretty much know everybody's situation or their circumstance here and ain't nobody got the situation this woman had i know what i'm talking about but this woman was so scarred up had so many complexes had so many stigmas she couldn't walk down the aisle without somebody thinking the wrong thing about her it's amazing that when you get in trouble not these people i know y'all sweet angels i heard that there were some people had to hang their angel wings back up there in the vestibule am i right about this but it's amazing when you need grace oh man when you need grace you don't want nobody casting a stone but when somebody else needs it i don't know if she really was a christian you know if i was a christian like i was a christian they wouldn't need as much church as i get you know as some people have got that teacup show up every once in a while ceo christians christian christmas and easter only got that teacup man i sure am glad i ain't like that brother alden back here he has to come every single night he must be some bad dude it's a bit he got to come every night he seems like he's always amen and because a preacher is preaching all around i'd hate to be like that guy it's amazing when you get in trouble you want grace but when somebody else gets in trouble you can't give out the same grace that you want back ah what i love about jesus jesus ain't stingy with his blood and jesus ain't stingy with his grace and jesus ain't stingy with his miracles and jesus ain't stingy with his deliverances this woman even though she was scarred even though she had complexes she did not let that hold her back what was it when she found the water source she said come and see a man come and see a man that's told me everything that i ever did is not this the messiah brother madam said it was like a house on fire on a windy day you couldn't put her out what's wrong with this church they got set on fire and they can't be put out it's the holy ghost that is moving the church of the living god try to stop us and we'll just blow on harder put wind behind us and we'll burn down elkton we'll burn down virginia we'll burn down the united states you set a man on fire and the world will come and watch him burn satan wanted you he had the goods on you he knew your family history and he knew your dna but when adam forfeited the rights it didn't afford that forfeited title deed didn't go into satan's dirty hands the author almighty god took that book when satan wanted your life he said mercy said no [Applause] satan was trying to get to you but your bow ass stood up for you your bow ass said no she's mine i know a lot of people don't want her but i want her i know a lot of people don't like her but i like her i like the way she picks up my wheat i like the way she picks up my message i like the way she carries it i like the way she dresses she ain't for everybody but she's mine i tell you satan tried his very best to get you but god said no brother branham said have you ever heard me say satan take your hands off of god's property you see when jesus is up there matthew chapter 4 and the amount of temptation and he goes up there and jesus or satan tries to offer jesus though kingdoms of the world without a calvary he said i'm gonna give them to you but brother banham told us that jesus knew that he was gonna fall heir to them in the millennium he said and the earth was his he said but the earth has got to be loose from the grip of satan politics has got to be ruse loose from the grips of satan all of these world council churches has got to be loose from the say to the grip of satan go listen to it he tells us that in future home he goes in there he said but oh he said what is it he said you're not annihilated he said you've changed and just like he is going to in in matthew 24 and 35 that heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away that word means to change and to think that you can't be annihilated to think that you can't be stopped to think that you can't be destroyed but brother branham told us in the token that when you confess your sins it goes back upon the head of satan and your and your sins are annihilated to think that tonight you can't be annihilated but you're seeing your mistakes your troubles [Applause] you ain't got to worry about covering this up you ain't got to worry about sweeping this under the covers you ain't got to worry about hiding it under the rug the cross took your sin the cross took your shame all of your guilty habits [Applause] the i am [Applause] part himself be i am and i will pour out my spirit on all flesh upon my sons and my daughters what is it it's the living water being poured out satan can't hold your healing back satan can't hold your breakthrough back satan can't hold your experience back it's yours because the i am is sitting at your well you've had a lot of drinks you've been to a lot of places you've been scarred a lot but the scars didn't hold her back been manhandled been abused but the scars can't hold him back he is running after you with the eyes full of fury and he's making sure that he gets you and you're gonna be like the man in john chapter nine when jesus walks to that blind man and he heals him and there was confusion whether this was a man or not i don't think it's him it looks like whitney breeden but i don't think it's her it looked like joel strike but i don't think it's him it can't be that one they could not be the one that stood there under that condition all of their life and really be living in the sight that they're living in it can't be them but i love his confession i am he he sat on all the questions with his voice why don't you silence satan's accusations and say i am the one that jesus thought so much of that he came for me that he bled for me that he gave his life for me and the i am will stand up for you like he did in revelations 1 and 18 i am he that was dead but i am alive forevermore and i have the keys of death hell and the grave everything that could have locked you up heaven turned loose hallelujah hallelujah you're no longer in the prison house it's time to say come and see a man let the musicians go oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said in his early part of his ministry drove past drove past the billboard and only had one word on it hungry with a question mark what was it it led them that billboard was leading them to a place where they could get fed at what is this what's it what is this bride of jesus christ it's a billboard for a thirsty and hungry dying generation that there is an i am that is
