opportunity and a privilege to be able to be gathered with you and hear the wonderful things that we've heard so far brother tim brother timothy done outstanding haven't they certainly have enjoyed it appreciate brother ron and the home church all the effort that's been put forth to make this meeting a success let's turn to the book of ephesians if you would today chapter three ephesians chapter 3 verse 9. and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church by the church the manifold wisdom of god the word manifold means variegated so it's like different colors and different varieties of the wisdom of god it's overwhelming really that god would choose the church to manifest such great things according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him notice paul doesn't say faith in him but actually by his faith this is the way we live this is the way we rapture wherefore i desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory i'd also like to read to you from a quote that brother branham made in a sermon entitled very strange title but dr moses you know when i begin to believe christian friend that we're just living in the beginning of the greatest thing the world has ever witnessed that of all the lines are getting unclogged you know clogged up with all kinds of doctrines and theologies and all kinds of stuff we all know about stuff don't we and unbelief it's been handed down from generation to generation oh there's no such a thing as healing the days of miracles is past and he says we just automatically believe that may the lord bless his words you may be seated i'd like to speak to you just a little bit today on unclogging the lines i would imagine most of us have had our lines clogged up before as far as plumbing and all different types of things and it's not fun is it right you go to take a shower you go to wash your hands or whatever and the sink is all stopped up and you uh you have to call a plumber um i tell my wife and my family that i wish i would have been a plumber instead of a preacher until i'm doing plumbing work that's us right that's the way we are we're never satisfied uh carol asked me this morning she said you wish i was a plumber i said yeah until i do plummet me and plumbing don't get along i always have all types of leaks but we know naturally how that is for us and so many things get in our way to hinder our faith initially man was not made for such as a matter of fact let me uh kind of share this with you in the fundamental foundation for faith man was made as a secondary god on earth he was given power to control all things all elements of the earth that was adam adam was given these great powers but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell adam could speak to the winds and they would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to wildlife to the waters whatever it was everything obeyed adam now in the beginning he said man what god gave him power over was everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact now listen unconscious of the fact not the rumor but unconscious of the fact and he says after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father when he lost that all of the great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now here we set today and i'm sure probably most of us are christians and hopefully most of you have the baptism of the holy ghost and yet still we're more than likely dealing with uh plumbing problems plumbing problems in our spirit plumbing problems in our mind plumbing problems and our thoughts and hopefully none of you have it in your soul but if you do this is a great place to be delivered of it today and we know how that even in our bodies how that our hearts and from the foods and things that we are eating uh many of us have of arteries and valves and so on inside of our hearts and they become all clogged up is that right and we need stents and we need this and that what's that for well it's to open up what god made in the beginning that was not to be clogged but by all the hybrid food and stuff that we're eating it's clogging us up and what does it cause heart attacks heart failure all types of things like that well if it does that in the natural realm i'm sure you agree that it also does it in the spiritual realm this is why that the spirit of god moving in among the message people is so foreign to some and it's because of doctrines and theologies and to be honest with you some preachers that preach psychology instead of preaching the baptism of the holy ghost and then it begins to clog up people's arteries of their face and then if they feel a little bit of the presence of god it's like they feel bad because one of the worst names you can be called in this message is a pentecostal oh my that's one of the worst things you can be called as a pentecostal i don't mind it i've been called that ever since i've been in the message but you know they think they're calling me a 1906 pentecostal but that ain't what i am i'm an original pentecostal that's right that's what i am i'm not ashamed of it i i don't hang my head with it no i'm proud to be identified as an acts 2 38 holy ghost phil son of god baptized in jesus name amen why that's the church he's coming for now what you notice brother rem says adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry can you imagine that never having to worry never having a pain a sorrow a sadness or a sickness and adam didn't just forfeit that for himself he forfeited that for me and for you he said he never had a heart ache never had a fear he just climbed up in the arms of father like a child everything was his and whatever he asked for he got it everything obeyed him because he was god's child and the child is the heir of all things now when man fell he lost this and when he lost in the fall christ come as our redeemer to redeem us back to everything that man lost now either we believe that or we don't and either we want to put it away out yonder in the millennium we don't need no divine healing in the millennium we don't need no miracles in the millennium i'll tell you when we need them right now we need them today we need deliverance we need the baptism of the holy ghost we need our plumbing all unclogged by the power of god not in the millennium but today oh my notice he said did you ever stop to think of what christ redeemed for us he gave us everlasting life but he brought us right back to the eternal fellowship with god but what is it then that happens to us even after we're born again and you know there's an element of us as mad as we hate to say it that is left unregenerate and that is our outside man once you notice how brother graham deals with this he said the thing of it is since man has been restored back to this place man in the fall lost his conscience of what father put him on the earth to do in other words he says all of the plumbing listen all of the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets our faith has been clogged up we might need some drano this morning y'all keep drano at home well i do you know our our sisters they have long hair and us brothers pay the penalty for that it's in our handkerchiefs you ought to be a preacher and get up and wipe your face and one of your wife's long hairs hangs here in your nose [Applause] yeah or or worse than that you ought to be a preacher and put your socks on and you don't realize it till you get up in the pulpit you got one of your wife's hairs between your toes now that's really aggravating that's right but not only that but our showers and things like that so i i keep drano at home because we have to have it you all understand what i'm talking about well i believe that god has given us some spiritual drain though you know the problem is we've had so many decades of theologians around the message that haven't had the holy ghost oh lord i think it's pretty evident some of the message preachers have not been born again how in the world can any man fill with the holy ghost not one his sons and daughters dancing in the power of god it's more than i can comprehend why in the world wouldn't any pastor want the people of god filled with the holy ghost oh hallelujah preaching the word of god a living resurrected lord jesus not a theology not a doctrine but a resurrected savior hallelujah it was not a doctrine that died for us it was not a doctrine that raised from the dead it is not a doctrine that we're looking for it is a person and that person is right here this morning to heal and deliver and set us free and unclog the plumbing in our brains our hearts are spirits [Applause] but i want you to listen to what brother branham says it can be clogged up with he says our brain and the outlets our faith has been clogged up with business affair home life domestic things wow they never mentioned movies they never mentioned gambling they never mentioned all that and we know that thing can happen too yes but i want you to notice how simple that sometimes for the lives of christians that they can get clogged up just normal everyday stuff so most of us i mean if you've got a smartphone it's a shame that smartphone is smarter than some of the people who own them but i'll tell you one thing if i couldn't then have enough holy ghost to control that thing from staying off of some of these internet websites which is ordained of hell i'd get me a dumb phone i just get me a dumb phone and all that done was made phone calls forget the internet i'd rather have the holy ghost than to have a smartphone if i ain't got enough victory to control it praise the lord and what does it do a little bit of domestic life and a little bit of this and a little bit of that and each one contributes to a little bit more of our plumbing getting clogged up and before long we wind up with so tiny and we go to a meeting like this and we're scared t totally to death i can't hardly wait to hear what some of the preachers are going to say about this meeting dear jesus and here i am my face is identified with it now y'all are witnesses i wasn't the one who'd been preached thoughts and stuff simply guys [Applause] i wonder how many of us today if the holy ghost did a scan on us how much of our faith our love our forgiveness our godliness our kindness what he finds so clocked up i want the holy ghost to scan me today don't you just let him scan my avenues of faith and virtue and forgiveness and kindness just let him do a scan on every one of us how many agree to that so he can look at us and see is there anything about me lord that that displeases you so the plumbing in my and my forgiveness can be opened up and the plumbing in my understanding and my revelation and all of that notice the prophet said it's all become so clogged that god can't operate through those channels that he made us for if god designed a man's body and certainly the body of his son the church he's designed us to come together in heavenly places in christ jesus and have these supernatural workings of god outlets through gifts of the spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and gifts of healing wow brother brandon believed in that brother brown believed in that you see it's not brother branham that's hebrews 13 8. it's jesus christ or brother random was here brother branham of sharon no brother adam it's not hebrews 3 8 i'm not and you're not jesus christ is hebrews 13 8 he is the same yesterday today and forever notice he said all these other different gifts as outlets that god led his power through and lets out his revelation to his people not as an individual so much he says but as a unit together as one body but satan by the laws of sin and deaths makes everything that sin and death brawl operate satan sins a cancer then man recognizes it and receives it satan sends heartaches we recognize it and receive it now satan has this this realm and he has these abilities to transmit and we know that these diseases all begin in the fourth dimension god created seven dimensions in the beginning knowing that man would need them light matter time science where the unbeliever goes where the believer goes and where god is the fourth dimension is the realm the prophets see their visions uh diseases all diseases begin in the realm of fourth dimension this is why the prophet will be able to see by vision and peer into that and hear those demons screaming one to another and he would be able to see him in the fourth dimension and science has never yet been able to break into it so they're able to scan us and do x-rays and all that and they say yeah there's this and there's that but they don't have a machine that can be able to peer into the fourth dimension god didn't have a machine but he had a prophet so a prophet was able to look into that fourth dimension and say i see this and i see that there's no telling what he could have told mayo if they would have just asked him no telling what he could have told the medical centers down in houston and all these great places of course they wouldn't but one day they will declare themselves and science is already finding it out more and more that they go with their skins they're just they're several decades behind but god already showed his prophet things that was in there and he said that those cancers would actually come from a bruised cell or a cell that had backslid my sister-in-law several years ago had cancer and the doctor told her that it actually come from a cell inside of her body and it didn't use the word backstage but it was more of a medical term i thought yeah exactly what the prophet said way back in the 50s so god opened that realm by which we could peer into for the first time in centuries and centuries we had a window to the supernatural so god then takes the seer and he opens that realm and he would be able to hear things and see things most of us aren't able to live in that realm you imagine the prophet said when he cast demons out of people that he would go back to the hotel room that night and them demons would come in there and they would rub their flesh against his he would hear chains rattling all night long i'm not made to take that that'd scare the liver out of me oh you might as well be honest you're not made to take it either but god gave us a man that was able to peer into that dimension and we don't have to be afraid of it because remember greater is he that is in us that he that is in the world but what did he do god brought a restoration to open up and help us to see that the supernatural is here we can sense it here already this morning that's what we've been sensing during these services i'm convinced the angels of god have been walking up and down these aisles they've been hanging right here oh glory to god and they're still here today they've not gone anywhere they're still here but how can we sense that because the plumbing of our faith has been opened up why don't other people believe in it they're so clogged up the supernatural cannot flow through them or you're blessed today friend you're blessed to believe that jesus is still the same he still heals the sick oh brother donald we don't need healing speak for yourself my daughter's sitting today and then hurting and liver the doctor saying that she has an incurable as far as what the doctors say a situation in her liver and they treat her and then they beat it down and then it raises back up again and they treat it and beat it down oh they don't need miracles my darling daughter needs a miracle brother ron spencer needs a miracle no doubt many of you and you know what our plumbing has been opened up to believe that our god is a miracle working god amen we want every avenue of our faith and our understanding to be so open that we believe god can do anything because our god cannot lie he says the only thing that hindered the human race today from being superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because the power lines of the outlet of god and the human being has been clogged up and what makes it so difficult is in our ranks that we have preachers that are helping clogging as if every preacher was all in the unclogging business would have more of this stuff going on i hope you understand and see the setting where we're at our message is being divided satan has used division for years he divided us with the thunders he divided us with praerica he divided us with this and he divided us with that to me one of the last divisions that he's going to try to make is divide us from the power of god because he knows without that there will be no rapture there will be no body change if god can't heal me how can i trust him to change me you understand every time you get a divine healing from god you got a potential body change right then that's why satan don't want us to believe in the power of god he don't want us to believe in miracles he don't want us to believe in healing if he can stop us from believing in healing he knows we won't have faith to believe in a rapture but if we lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we lay hands on people and cast devils out of them and tumors are delivered then we say the god that can heal the tumor can change the body the god that can heal tb can change an old man to a young man he can remove gray hair that's our god hey i heard there's some speaking in tongues went around here last night my goodness ain't you all no deeper than that wow i mean here are you all acting like a bunch of acts 238 um well brother donnie don't you know when that which is perfect just come to that which is in part is done with i do know that so let's do away with knowledge because the knowledge we have now certainly is not going to be in the perfection of eternity well you can't see it right now but them demons are squirming brother brahman says sometimes i say this reverently theology and doctrines have clogged up your faith and clogged up your lines till you have been taught that those things can't be and it puts a block in the way i don't believe the holy ghost is here today to do a stint my stance has saved a lot of people's lives yes absolutely i'm grateful for every one of them but i believe the lord wants to do a little bit more than stent work this morning he said can you imagine this building being here energized tonight for light by electricity electricity and unseen force it was harnessed and brought on the earth when benjamin franklin first found it he screamed i've got it amen but he says he didn't know what he had but along come edison and put it to work so brother adam did not come to take away the power of god brother branham knew and he had enough sense to know that he was found in basically a new move a new move which was a restoration move back to the original brother branham knew if god allowed him to look ahead in time he knew that his message would follow the same pattern as other messages down through the ages and that was that there'd be men that would raise up among them each one want to be the one that was going to be the leader of them all you know how that works that's man so he wants well we're the big guy we're the big guy got to come to us to get it all and what do they do they try to dam up the water now they try to dam up the water so that if you drink you got to come to them to get it and then they control the flow they control everything about it well hallelujah but you see i'm so glad that according to what jesus said in saint john 7 37 if any man believe on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water oh i'm glad today that we have a fountain that i don't have to go to new york i don't have to go to jeffersonville i don't have to go here and there and there to drink of the living water but i carry the well inside my body hallelujah i carry the well inside my body so if i need healing i go to the well if i need deliverance i go to the well if i need peace i go to the well [Applause] [Music] but you see i have the same problem you did satan tries to clog up my pipes with worry frustration fear anxiety any of you shouting people still deal with that if you don't today you will tomorrow don't worry tomorrow's monday going home part two notice brother ma'am says but we ask christians i almost did that and i thought if i do the whole building on him town we as christians become too clogged up we just can't understand well the doctor said i can't get well and as long as you think that then you're not thinking god's thoughts but you can imagine now brother ron showed me just day before yesterday a picture on his phone a mapping of his brain a tumor here and one there now looking at it humanly you say well the doctor said it's there the doctor said it's right there my little girl is going to be going down to nashville the seventh i think this is september and they're gonna map her liver and see if she's a candidate for some stuff called why nanny if she is she'll go back the next week and they'll put this radioactive stuff into her liver these seeds that'll go inside of her liver and stay inside of there and try to kill that cancer that is there the scan will say this and the scan will say that as i sat with her in the hospital several months ago and she was back there getting a scan done i had my laptop in my lap studying and the spirit of god come there to where i was and said don't believe their skin believe my word that's the report i believe that's the report i choose to believe hallelujah but when carol called her this morning to check on her before church her liver was hurting and it'll hurt and go into spasms so what do we do with those symptoms changes nothing does it affect you sure it affects you i'm not sure that it'd be me then be her as a matter of fact i told the lord about six months ago i said lord i'd much rather it be me i wish i could take it on myself you know how he is he's so lovely and wonderful and he said you don't have to i already did i already hallelujah he took your sickness he took your sickness he took your disease he took your stand upon himself if we can get our plumbing unclogged i believe the lord god could visit us right here today and it would be a meeting that would be around the world within 24 hours that god is moving among his people [Applause] well the doctor says i'm going to die all regards he says to the doctor but that's the best of his knowledge but if god could just clear that little channel and run energy down to that place something is going to happen maybe you've got a besetting sin in your life and you're troubled with this and you've asked god and asked god and ask god and you know how it is ever failure with that particular thing and satan uses it that failure to paralyze your face and say you've asked god to do it and he ain't done it you've asked god to do it and he ain't done it no sometimes you just got to keep on pressing right over the top of it and say devil you're going to be under my feet you ain't stopping me satan this the setting sin is going to be under my feet my failures mean nothing my sword comings me nothing hallelujah blow out my powder yarn hallelujah he said why did christ redeem us for why didn't it just make the atonement and say now there's no need of giving them deep powers there's no need of making this man a son of god there's no need in doing that i'll just ask him to believe it write his name on the book of heaven and that'll settle it but he gave us those redeemed blessings that we might operate in the work of god by the energy of the holy spirit and you all ever been shocked before by electricity it's a really neat feeling in it totally invisible and totally powerful for those of you who haven't done it i certainly don't advise you trying it after church but you can take our word for it it is really something don't you understand the energy of the power of god others will look at it and say why do they have to act that way why do they believe this it's because we've been touched by it before we've been shocked hallelujah we've been shocked by it and we want everybody else to get a touch of the same thing that we got because it will change your life forever notice how brother brahman says our minds are sluggish and the valves have been stopped up so here we are when we're under the anointing of the spirit of god we're a whale oil machine [Laughter] and then somebody will say you're a holy roller they say i don't want to be calling no holy roller most of the message folks ain't holy rotors they might be holy setters [Applause] most of our holy ghost experiences wouldn't be identified as an acts 2 because they were drunk well they thought they were drunk they was just kind of staggering around and most of us have got to drunk i reckon we passed out we just kind of said we don't move we don't worsen well praise the lord our minds are sluggish paralyzed i hope and pray to god i never stand before him and him say to me you paralyzed my people's faith you told them i was not the same you shamed them from worshiping me i'll tell you preacher's gonna have a lot to answer for one of these days come on friends we're not pointing our fingers today so much as individuals but you and i both know we've had meetings and went to meetings before and it was nothing but outpouring of slugs and sluggish thoughts and sluggish teaching and when you left you just felt so then you come up here and you go [Applause] oh [Applause] now i know this is very simple but it's still very powerful really brother baby says it can't flow free like it should unless you let the holy spirit so dominate our lives till it pushes those valves and life begins to start operating we just can't open those little clogged up channels to let the spirit flow you see dig it out get cleaned up and the more you dig the better off you'll be the ecclesiastical systems that's got you all the channels plugged up pull them old logs out the days of miracles is past we don't need divine healing today now notice the logs he's not saying that you women it's okay for you to cut your hair you women it's okay to wear a mini skirt and it's okay to wear high heels while anybody in the presence of god that's got much of a conscience and no better than that just by conscience itself but notice the laws of theology we'll be saying the days of miracles has passed and we don't need divine it's a shame brother branham dealt with that when he was here and spent years of his life striking that devil and it comes right back around in the very same message it may come around but we're going to knock its head off hallelujah it may come around but it's going to get in trouble when it does hallelujah [Applause] here's another log he said well we don't need it no more today we got the best doctors well i don't know about your doctor mine is still practicing medicine [Applause] well you got this and you got that you might have that you might have that you might have that you leave the other more mites than anything else whether i give you a pill for that might appeal for that man i'm glad jesus ain't practicing medicine [Applause] he does it jesus ain't practicing he is the cure oh glory hang with me a few more minutes the prophet said i can show you where god gave the church the power to heal the sick and cast out devils and these things they would do you come and put your finger on the scripture where jesus said i take it from the church you've got it clogged up your own self-made idea has clogged it up you're all clogged up of too many ecclesiastical systems dig the thing out and throw it away [Music] all you got to do is get them old logs out of the way that'll one believe listen jesus promised it he said and i'm going to get this old log and throw it out and as soon as you get that log out of the way the sweet waters of peace of god will go to flowing like a river you know what it does to throw a log in the channel what does it well it's all kinds of dirt that hits against that log and washes it up the first thing you know you got the water all backed up like beavers do and you make a dam and he said nothing will go through it and we've got too many beaver preachers today now that's a direct quote from your prophet we've got too many beaver preachers today trying to damn all the water oh god but you know what these beaver preacher used quotes so and then they put a quote and i bled on top and then they put that quote on top of that quote and then they put that quote on top of that quote and then they you know put a little sludge and little theology of this and that and the other and then they bring it together on their ipad and by the time they get done you're just saying well i i thought god healed i thought god saved i thought god delivered you know what you're sitting under that ministry of the viva preacher [Applause] i thought you folks was eagles i thought you was eagles i don't want no beaver preacher cutting off my water i don't want no beaver preacher telling me that he's not the same yesterday today and forever i need healing i need joy i need peace i need power i need joy like i've never had it before i don't want no beaver preacher in my way [Applause] he said we've got too many beaver preachers tried to damn all the water up that's what they've done to us down through the ages had a damn call the seven thunders had a damn call tapes only what they're trying to do damn it all up so if you're the bride lord of god hallelujah you'll come to our church you'll come to our convention somebody told me a few years ago said we know exactly how he's going to the rapture i said really he said yeah it's how many gets our pastors tapes which of course i didn't which mean i was out i recognize that real quick trying to damn up all the water trying to keep healing away from me trying to keep healing away from you trying to keep joy away from you all glory but we need to take some dynamite of the holy ghost and say look out devil here we come we're going to blow that fake plum out of here brother batman says it gets all stagnated the water gets little wiggle tails so they wiggle from one church to the other not sure if they got the holy ghost don't know which preacher to follow we got wiggle tails in them days of miracles is past no such a thing as divine healing can't sit still five minutes in a meeting oh my goodness stagnated water beaver dam blow it out now out west montana wyoming colorado different places out there they actually have professional dam blowers now the reason of that is because it's wild wilderness a lot of the thousands times tens of thousands of blm land and government land so the beavers will get in there and uh they start damning up all the water well they cut it off from that little church and that little church and that little field you know what i'm saying so they go to cutting it off well they get these guys and they'll notice the flow of the water down in this certain creek or this certain place and i've been out there and hunting some of them different places and you'll see it that it'll come down pretty good-sized river and then it comes down to slower and slower down toward trickle well then they send one of these guys with a bible and an ipad i don't boy ghosts of going back upstream man alive if i wasn't a preacher i'd like to be one of them guys forget the plumbing so he goes to tracing it back oh lord thank god for being led by the holy ghost that the spirit of god can chase back where our problems are let's go back and see when we lose our joy word we lose the power of god let's go back upstream and find where it's at you imagine this old boy gets out of his government paid for truck and he steps out there with his government giving dynamite tnt on this side got a hand grenade on this side in case i needed got a little bit of nitro right here i'll tell you to me that's what happened right here in these two prior services god had two two holy ghost men come in here and they said all right devil you've done backed up the water to the people of god we're here to blow you come out of here we're here to blow out fear and anxiety and worry and trouble hallelujah and we're gonna light this thing and let it blow poke to the heavens [Applause] wouldn't you imagine these guys have a reputation in colorado and montana and wyoming and when the beavers see them 911-911 this is beaver 14 reporting the preacher damn blower 9-1-1 hurry sit back up quick if he keeps on finishing the rest of these sermons demons is going to have to leave people oh glory hallelujah the sick will be healed those that are bound will be set free lord god oh it ain't no wonder satan hates god's men like never before pray for your past pray for the men of god on the field they're fighting things more than you can imagine in your mind and it ain't no wonder because satan hates them so much if he can shut up them preachers and he can stop them from preaching the truth and stop them from preaching that he's the same yesterday today and forever god's people won't know if he's the same they won't know what to believe no more and the water will become so stagnant and they'll barely hang on from church service to church service but the prophet of god said we ought to be so completely surrendered to god he said i believe a man or a woman can live so close to god that the devil don't know what to do with you oh glory to god living a life so full of victory that you get up in the morning and hails him oh no oh no here he comes again here she comes again [Applause] hurry all right hurry i can feel it it's about to break hurry send me some more beavers put it on youtube call them a cult call them that's that another that's so discouraging to preachers it's too late [Music] we forfeited our reputation for the lord we forfeited what the world thinks about us for the lord we're on the business of the king [Applause] stagnated water beaver dam blow it out there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath the flood just clean out the channel we've got the people we're just cleaning out the channel the people's all right but the channel get it cleaned out so the holy spirit can come in man what a reputation to have so you walk out there say lord ain't that the damn blower come on now now you imagine them beavers if it's some uh expert on ecology i mean some epa wpa wow opa p-a-p-a d-a-d-a they look at their city that's that intellectual giant got no power he don't believe in dynamite [Applause] he don't even believe in dynamite he believes in his head [Applause] so he just scoops down in the water saying oh the ph is off now the alkalinity of this water is 7.0 it ought to be actually 7.4 to 7.8 and that will allow the algae and the blue green moss and the such and such and so and so to do so and so and such and such [Applause] and the beavers are down in their little house saying [Music] oh i love that girl i love that guy they come in your bamboo devils and leave with worse cause then they get a religious devil of unbelief on them but here comes the dynamite guy i shall not be i shall know i shall not [Applause] then beavers say [Applause] and they look at him maybe he's bow legged maybe he didn't go to school in college and he didn't graduate from the college of such and such and so and so and so but they're scared to death he opens his coat and says have arrived [Applause] look out devil god's got a bride around the world anointed with the holy ghost and this is our time this is our season yes hell will come against us but hell is already defeated this if our faith can rise to the level to believe for the supernatural and always in one way felt sorry for brother brahm in the sense that brother branham never got to really preach a message convention brother man got to preach at his church branham tabernacle and of course in november of 65 the church in tucson was established you know one little group one other group can you

in the smaller gym for where the little kids will be we have a jumpy house there for them i know that some of us olders might slip down there but remember that's for the little kids like myself and brother timothy but in in the main gym there right behind the cafeteria there'll be basketball volleyball and those things and we just ask that you do not take any drinks into the gym because last time we were there we had some spills and different things they allow that in there but we are asking that you do not do that so that we don't have to clean that up there's not janitors there it's
