even now into the atmosphere lord by the word of prayer father we recognize as your people father that you're you're our king but you we're your queen father and we walk into your shekinah glory this morning recognizing lord that you're here recognizing that you have a purpose recognizing that this is your this is your will in man's life that that we would surrender ourselves unto the auspices of the holy ghost father lord i pray father that you reach out across this congregation today father lord you see their hands lord you see their hearts you see their needs lord even so father lord jesus and lord even myself lord my hands raised lord my hearts bowed before you lord my life is laid out before you lord i i would ask lord jesus that lord as jeremiah would see the potter there and the

plan that you have for us let us be a vessel that'll be so full of the holy ghost and filled with your spirit lord jesus lord that we could be a witness in this dying generation lord early this

children lord i want to help them father in every way possible to the littlest child that has the understanding father lord i want to help him lord i pray that you would take your lord your word and you would begin to speak to us lord jesus you took the little children father and you took time with them lord would you take time with us this morning lord we feel you even now lord we just asked god that you'd come behind your word lord i know that there are those that are at home today that would love to be here because of circumstances lord they're there and i pray that you'd visit them in their homes today you'd minister to them according to your word we'll be careful to serve you father in the name of jesus christ amen amen if you have your bibles this morning i would like to look over in the book of hebrews chapter 10 hebrews chapter 10 verse 5 and then down to proverbs chapter 31 and verse 10. hebrews chapter 10. and verse 5. i want to be remembering our pastor brother ron today as he'll be he ministered there last night and the lord would restore his strength we want to pray that the lord would restore his strength to him today and they'll be speaking again later this evening so we just want to be remembering brother ron hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5 wherefore when he came when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body thou hast prepared for me proverbs chapter 31 and verse 10. we recognize that most of the proverbs that were written by they were written by king solomon you go read any book in barnes and noble and they'll tell you how to get wisdom and you'll find that they grabbed most of their knowledge straight from the book of proverbs but when you go to studying out proverbs 31 you'll find that it's a lady of grace that is writing this you'll find that it's a woman that that understands the power of jesus christ it's bathsheba that is that is speaking these words these are the words as they transition from proverbs 31 and notice notice what solomon is writing here and who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies verse 11 says the heart of her husband thus safely trusting her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeketh war wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ships she bringeth her food from afar she rises also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens she considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard she girdeth her loins with strength and and strengtheneth her arms she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she layeth her hounds her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretches out her hand to the poor yay she reaches forth her friend her hands to the needy she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth amongst the elders of the land she maketh fine leaneth and selleth it and delivereth girdles upon unto the merchant strength and honor or her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her husband and it is not the bread of idleness notice this lady is a lady of grace her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord shall she shall be praised give her of the fruit of her hands and had her own works praise her in the gates a virtuous woman a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies i'd like to speak to you today i'd like to speak to you on this thought that vasti can never be an esther and an esther can never be a vasti so i'd like to continue our thought on experiencing the liberty of this message but recognizing who you are you're not just one of the girls you're not just one of the ladies that was setting out on the streets you're his queen and to think that today that one of the greatest treasures in life that god could give to a man is a godly wife i'm going to give you some instruction young brothers one of the greatest things that man that a man can receive in this life outside of the baptism of the holy ghost is a godly wife a woman that is faithful a woman who is loyal a woman that is honorable a woman that is honest and trustworthy a woman's whose love whose love who loves beyond any barriers she loves beyond any faults her love has no distance her love knows no bounds the love that she has towards her husband it is patient love is kind it is it is passionate it is a woman a woman that fears the lord that is that is a godly woman that god gives it that god gives unto man it's the greatest gift that you can ever have is god giving a man a wife that is that is true to him that'll be a real mother to his children a woman that'll have the same words that ruth said when when orpah kissed naomi naomi and went back to the the gods of the moabites here ruth began to speak these words entreat me not that i not leave thee or return from following after thee for wither thou goest i will go and where you lodge i will lodge thy people will be my people and thy god my god where you die i will die there will i be buried you see that's the kind of woman that's the kind of wife that god wants today is a woman that is willing to go wherever he's willing to go where the spirit of the lord leads us it will never be to a place that his grace of god cannot keep us but to think that today that god god wants a woman that has a kind of a love like paul would say in first corinthians 13 that that charioth charity suffereth long and love it is kind it love enveth not charity hath vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up it does not behave itself and seemingly seeketh not our own it is not it's not easily provoked it thinketh no evil it rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth it beareth all things it believes all things and hopeth in all things and it adores all things notice what what paul said that charity never fails and you you watch the love between a husband and a wife and you you watch as it as it begins to grow throughout throughout the intimate sea of of throughout a courtship and then it moves into and it moves into a deeper relationship and you watch as that love begins to grow it's a love that no man can break it's a love that no man that no man it knows no bounds and you watch as what love will do it will drive me and it will drive me crazy sometimes but it will also drive them to go to the depths of the world to save somebody to to the one that they love it'll make a man from grottos virginia marry a girl all the way in mary in north carolina love is a very powerful force and to think that that we have and we express this this human love but to think about the love of almighty god the love that that we see and i believe that we have a great example that was set before us in in brother homer and sister nancy and brother ron and sister connie and you begin to see the love relationship it's not a it's not a relationship of hate it's not a relationship of bondage but it is a relationship that is that is based upon vows of of promises that they're not just hoping to keep its vows that they're going to keep because they vowed this not between one another but they vowed that before almighty god and to think about the love that we have and and you sitting there your brothers and brothers and your sisters sitting there beside your beside your mate this morning you express that love in ways that that nobody else can express it like like you can express it there's there's nobody when when things are going wrong and you might be just a little bit moody brother roger and sister anne just knows how to put her arm right right up underneath of you and just calm you down and settle your nerves it's just something about a wife that that that she can calm you down when when you when you're all flustered and and it's just the way that she has when you come in from a hot day's work she's got that ice sweet tea and watermelon setting over there she just knows exactly what you like maybe you like fried chicken or maybe you like a ribeye steak but she knows what you like and she's wanting to please you maybe maybe you like waking up on sunday mornings and getting biscuits and gravy but it's something that she knows how i see somebody saying amen right there on that one but it's something that she knows that you love it's something that she's wanting to express it isn't it's that wife that is to you brothers she's not your doormat she's your queen she's the queen of your she's the queen of your house she's the queen of your heart she's the queen of your mind your whole mind and your whole your whole doing is to make sure that this wife is taken care of and to think that today that that christ ever since the garden of eden has longed to rebuild that holy union between god and man between between between that holy union that was started there back there in the garden of eden when eve which was deceived into breaking that union god is desiring that type of union before and he's desiring it right now but we find that throughout the message he said you'll find that that she'd been given this woman had been given a sacred trust that woman was not to break that trust of womanhood the act between her and her mate that and and to have her character and raise her children to be honorable to her husband and we recognize that a woman always types out the church but this this this woman this woman because the church is considered a bride notice you're not a bride to anybody today but you're a bride to the son of jesus christ the son of almighty god you see a virtuous woman who can find but to think that of her price today proverbs 12 and 4 said that a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she maketh her but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness as in his bones now there's some people that are going to die and go to hell but there's some people that marry the wrong person and they live hell on earth today and i don't believe that anybody should have to live on hell on earth and i don't believe i believe it's something that you ought to it's something that you ought to seek out earnestly it's not something that we that we just venture into on our own but you want to find somebody that loves you that's got the character of jesus christ young boys young girls go listen to the marriage of the lamb and go listening to the choosing of the bride it'll give you a great example of what christ is looking for in his church but it also give you an example of what you should be looking for in a godly wife but you watch you watch this woman you see if a woman isn't connected with a man in trueness then it isn't her husband you see if she's just living with him or if she's just taking a vow to live with and and she's taking that she took a wrong vow and she pledged to love him and she said that she'd love him and she didn't do it you see all the time that man is deceived but you see there's one thing that we're not going to deceive christ because he knows who his wife is he knows who she is you see now watch what goes on in that relationship as we're just building this this morning you you're watching that relationship first it's a decision and then next it's it's the engagement then a promise and then there's a ceremony and in that ceremony is when the bride takes on the bridegroom's name and she goes through she goes through all of the she goes through all of the elements of the relationships and she's carrying these things and when the ceremony is over she now takes on his name but remember but remember she's no longer a church of the world but she is the church of the lord jesus christ she's not a church by a name but she is the bride of jesus christ by a birth by a nature by the power of god by the revealed truth you see when elies are when you go to studying over in the book of genesis and you see when when abraham was desiring a wife for his son isaac that he sent out a servant of the of his kingdom and he come there and he laid his hand upon his thigh and he took an oath that he would take a wife out of that out of that land there but you watch as eliezer as the pressure was getting on him as as it was coming die as it was coming due of the evening time that eliezer began to pray and he began to pray a certain prayer that when this woman comes forth to this whale that she would do exactly as i have said that she'll water us and she'll water these camels you see eliezer was hunting for abroad and when when when rebecca came there what did she do she moved right into the anointing of the prayer of william branham and she moved right in there but notice what it was he had found her by the witness of the baptism of the holy ghost you see he didn't just pick her out she was elected by almighty god you see god just wasn't up in heaven saying any many mighty mole catch a tiger by his toe i'll choose this one or i'll choose that one god elected you before you could ever had a choice before you ever could have made a decision you didn't have a choice to do with this your choice took you down bad roads your choice let you down to other lovers but this choice his choice chose chosen before the foundation of the world and rebecca moved under the anointing of the message of the hour and she watered the camels that would take her back to her isaac hallelujah she was a woman with character a woman that would display you that when her mother and her brother said why why don't you just let the bride stay here a little bit longer when the methodist said no you got to stay here with us when the lutheran said no you got to stay here with us. the servant said let her make her choice let her make her choice that's why brother branham would preach in 1955 on the power of god and the power of satan and the power of your decision you see you've got the power to choose him today you see he already chose you but what's your choice you're standing at the altar the rings are here the bridal gown is on but what is your choice today we already know his choice we already know his choice he paid the ultimate sacrifice for you at calvary it's a woman with character you remember you remember the chicago boss's son the son of the armor and company the man that had all all the fields the man that had all the wealth he could have had any maiden in the land but this boaz wanted one he wanted one that would reflect himself this this this rancher's son he they they went there and he he had went out there who went out a decree that he was looking for a wife he was looking for a wife and and there see there you know the story that she began to they're there those girls they begin to dress up and they begin to they begin to put on all their dress and they begin to look the part and how they could please him they begin to think about what life would be like back in the big city what what it would be like so they begin to dress up like the girls from the city you see god's not wanting a girl that looks like the rest of the world he's wanting a lady that is dressed according to his promises that are laid out in deuteronomy that are laid out in first corinthians 11 he's wanting a lady that's that that has decorated herself like esther david decorated herself what does the king like you see it's not about what i like it's not about what the world wants it's not about what the church religion of the religiosity of the world is preaching or or their ideas of what christ is what does he want i believe that today that there's a bride that has moved into the auspices of the holy ghost that is moving right into the rhythm of the music of the message of the hour and she's being dressed in this fine line and she's wrapped herself in this body word she's wrapped herself in the blood of jesus christ she looks the part she's not just looking the part she's not just looking the part i'll say this she is the part she is his wife she is his queen she is his everything she's everything that he's been waiting for hallelujah if he was looking for methodists he'd took a rapture in luther's day or in wesley's day but it wasn't that what he was looking for he was looking for a wife that had liberty he was looking for a wife that had been set free you see there was so many chains upon her in luther's day there were so many chains upon her in methodist day that she couldn't put on the full garment but under the revelation of the seven seals she's put on the wedding garment and brother branham said in the marriage of the lamb that the bride has the material to dress herself with if you don't trust yourself it's your own fault you've been given the greatest message that's ever received in this land you can dress yourself under the ministry of malachi 4. vasti will never be an esther and esther would never be a vasty [Applause] he can have anybody he's a mighty man of wealth he can have anybody but he wants you you think about how great this god is he could have anybody who wanted to he didn't have to die but he died for you he could have he could have had he could he could have took it he could have took it the way he wanted to but he wanted you you think you think where the bride was in 1977 but you weren't even here most of you but because god so wanted you he designed it that he would give us a space where we would repent and turn back to him so that we could be his wife how did she see how did he see her how did he see her he didn't see her in some great garment he didn't see her he didn't see her dressed up with all the girls out there in the dance party of the world he didn't see her with fingernail polish on he didn't see her with a with blue eyes and makeup all over her face and blush all over her but he watched her when he stepped outside when he stepped outside of glory he watched her as she began to work in the field he watched ruth he watched how she handled herself he watched how this little girl and she was moved how that she was she was she would look like a little cinderella to us and she was out there she was walking barefooted she'd come before him humble and she was casting out the dish water doing the work he recognized that there was something about this girl that he was longing for he said in about a year i'm coming back for you everybody make make fun of you everybody might say he's not coming back for you you know everybody might say it was just a joke but god has had a desire and god will not lie he's not a man that he would lie he's not he's not obligated to your feelings but he is obligated through his word and he said he never leave you and he never forsake you i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world little lady of grace let me say this to you rapture season is at hand hallelujah god's desire for a wife to have queen authority to operate like a queen if you're in the kingdom you carry yourself differently if you're in a kingdom you handle yourself differently because you got kingdom authority god's wanting a wife that's not like israel that when a whoring after other gods he's wanting a wife that'll stay true to him that'll stay true to him in good times that are straight to stay good to him in sickness and in health he's wanting a wife that when he asks for her presents she comes when fasting decided no i'm not going down to the king's bank what did it do when the jews shut down the door it opened the door for esther let me tell you what they were screaming for up there on calvary's hill let his blood be upon us they don't recognize what they were doing they were opening the door for the gentiles what did he do he turned the gospel towards you and what did it do at people that were without god and people that were not even considered in the picture it turned god's liberty loose on the church of the living god he said we know that the modern church in its present condition and its presence states in no condition to finish up the great commission that god gave the church for this day he would say on the invisible union he said we know that the church could not the pentecostal church by no means could carry out the last day's message in its present condition he said why i can't even agree with one word one word in the bible he said but it's going to be an elected people that is elected for it do you recognize how powerful that you are that you are elected to carry this message out do you recognize what rebecca was receiving when she was down there and it took her all day long and eight hour day work watering those camels what was she doing she was watering the power that would take her back to her isaac and what it is when you begin to worship under the presence of almighty god there goes out of hallelujah there goes out in amen there goes out of glory hallelujah and it comes out what are you doing you are watering the power of the holy ghost that'll take you in the rapture it'll take you to your eyes that'll meet you in the sky there's no way that he can leave you esther ruth i want you to know your boaz will not leave you but he's going out and make a public testimony and kicking off his shoe and say i'm worthy enough to take her i'm big enough to handle her i'm big enough i'm strong enough i've got enough wealth oh but you don't know the scars that's on her life i'm big enough for that you don't know the stag you don't know where she's been at she was a moabitess it doesn't matter what i'm getting ready to pour out it's enough to watch all the moabite off of her what am i going to do with this ruth i am going to play out the part of my gentile wife just like caleb and joshua were elected to go in there and they were elected to possess and fulfill the promise that was given to abraham so was this bride elected to carry out this message brother branham said may i add to this woman grace hallelujah may i place her in the bible also called the elect lady he said like be a virgin like the virgin was to bring forth the body of god on the earth she was an elected woman god chose mary he said and also god has chosen elected lady which is his bride she's elected they can make fun of you all they want to they can say they can say that he's not coming back for you but i want you to know that the prophet said that before the foundation of the world he slipped on your fingers the unworthy unmerited wedding brand of almighty grace he slipped on your fingers the unmerited band of grace upon you before you could ever get in trouble before you got in your circumstances before you had a wrecked of life before you let your children go before you made bad decisions he slipped it on you he elected you to this kingdom i'll tell you what he elected to you this kingdom and there ain't no power in hell that can keep you from this kingdom there ain't one sickness that'll keep you from it there ain't one disease there ain't one demon there ain't one tormented spirit that'll keep you from this kingdom if god has elected it for you it's for you let me tell you he knows exactly what you want queen of heaven he's got walls of jasper he's got gates of pearl he's got streets of gold he's got a river that's running from it and there's and as matthew spoke last night he is the light of that city he knows what you want when you don't even know what you want said but you watch he said when you see women go on a rampage and just doing anything that they want to do he said do you watch the church she's doing the same thing you want to watch where the church is you watch where women are at if you want to watch where the bride is watch where israel's at but you watch women are on a rampage they're doing anything they want to if there is a liberation of anything brother random said it is a liberation of women's rights in this day don't get mad at me i'm quoting your prophet but you watch you watch women are on a rampage and are doing anything they want to say this is my body but i happen to believe that this is his body and i you can do you can do what you want to outlay ought to see with your body but with god's body i'm going i'm going to treat it like it's a temple of god i'm going to handle it like it's a house it's the house of almighty god i'm going to dress it like it's a house of god i'm going to treat it like it's a house of god i ain't going to put no holes in it because if we start putting holes in the body what have we got we've got a watered down gospel and we're trying to put our ideas to it and you watch what you're doing you're trying to get a gospel full of holes instead of the full gospel when you start putting holes in the body when you start painting up the barn and trying to make it look better than it was god wants his church the way he started it and god will have his church the way he'll finish it the way he started it and if he started it like that in pentecost it's going to have to end that way right now and there is a body on earth today that has dressed herself in the robes of his righteousness yeah the church is doing what they want to and the women's doing what they want to but you watch this last day bride she's stressing herself in his righteousness and there is a message that is sweeped out that is going to catch this bride hallelujah the message got through and we're still here [Applause] hallelujah we know what power we're under we understand the influence that we're under jesus told us he told us what the holy ghost would be it would be three things to us it would be a god it would be a comforter and it would be the spirit of truth and we know exactly where the holy ghost has led us to it has led us to this seventh star and i'm so thankful that god seemed fit to release the character of william branham in this day a man that we can relate to a man that a man that a man that didn't lie to us a man that was true a man that was a rugged man a man of faith a man that admitted that he was a man that he admitted that he was a man i can have confidence in a man that proves that he's a man and he said he said i'm not preaching to you myself i'm preaching to you jesus christ this seventh star had characteristics that would pull out abroad of this last day and because of the light in this day there's a bride that's standing on earth today she's not sitting down she's not sitting over in a corner this bride is standing to her feet watch what he did he drawed you to himself you remember you remember in 1933 when brother branham was baptizing at this at the foot of spring street right there on the ohio river and he's there baptizing and i believe the newspaper said it was five thousand people that we had lined that i had lined that riverbank and they were there watching and the newspaper actually carried it up there in canada that a mystic light shined over top of a local minister while he was baptizing out there on the ohio river and you remember as matthew went through the event last night you remember that that as that as that star began to come down that mystic star began to come over the man that was out there baptizing his 17th person as he was baptizing out there in the ohio river that that the water began to turn around around william branham and he said as he's getting ready to baptize there was a voice that came out it said as john the baptist forerunned the first comet of christ so will your message william branham forerun the second coming of christ now sister mita sister media said that when when that happened it was actually brother branham's voice that spoke out right there i and it doesn't matter to me whose voice it was i recognized that this was that i it doesn't matter to me if it was william brannon's voice because i recognize that that is revelations 10 7. i reckon i recognize that that is malachi 4. it is his voice it is his voice that god called in this day but i didn't hear just william branham's voice i heard god's voice you see that's the problem with so many people today that get their eyes on the man i didn't fall in love with eliezer i am rebecca i am falling in love with my isaac yes i appreciate eliza yes i thank him for bringing the camels to me yes i thank him for going to my going to my mothers and my brothers but i am not marrying eliessa i am marrying my isaac and as rebecca met her isaac out in the field so will this bride meet her bride quilt in the middle of the air [Applause] brother branham said people said that was psychology that come down there he said but he come down and he shut the mouths of the unbelievers because he stayed with the word to think that that pillar of fire brother adam would go to talking about that pillar of fire and he began to speak about it said people thought that was psychology and people people disbelieved that he said but he stopped their mouths and he began to talk about that that's the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel he said matter of fact here he comes now now i know i know many of you many of you have sat here and you've seen the pillar there were some of you that seen it at brother steve thomas's funeral there are some of you that seen it even in the past few weeks and there's some of you that seen it in years gone by but to me but to me whether you see it or whether you don't to look at that pillar fire that's hanging over william branham brother branham said he said it's a greater vindication to recognize that that's the pillar of fire than to see it with your own eyes because your eyes can play tricks on you so don't go don't don't get i'm just going to speak to you in a natural just for a moment don't you get disheartened because you've never seen something in the natural or maybe maybe you didn't see but if you can recognize if you can recognize that that's the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel it's just as much grace to you as somebody that has seen it do you recognize do you recognize what liberty that has been brought to us by the message of the hour that we're not sitting here wondering who we are we're not sitting here wondering do we have the holy ghost or do we not have the holy ghost i'm so thankful for this message if it wouldn't have been for this message there have been a lot of people that would have disqualified everybody sitting here that have been a whole lot of people that have said here and never spoke in tongues one time that would have been disqualified from the pentecostal movement but brother branham said he said that is not the initial evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost he said what the initial evidence of the holy ghost is is to be able to say amen to every single word of god i'd rather you say amen to every single word of god than all of you speaking in tongues at one time i'd rather you be able to have charity i'd rather you have love have the love towards almighty god but love this message i appreciate your hand claps i appreciate your praises but when you can say amen to the word of god it means that you're saying so be it lord jesus i appreciate your shouts i appreciate you hallelujahs but when you're identifying yourself that you believe all of this message to be the truth you're putting yourself in the same boat with jesus [Applause] now that ought to liberate you it ought to set you free because some of you've been sitting there under a devil that's told you well you ain't never spoke in tongues and you ever never did see the supernatural i just liberated you by a prophet's message you have been set free you recognize that's what men was wanting to do they were wanting to clamp down the holy spirit and say this it's only for our group i know some of you are some of you were with uh with individuals and they began to ask you you believe in speaking in tongues so yeah yeah when the anointing gets on us yeah when the spirit of the lord wants to move on through us and work through us you see you see to the pentecostal group they they they teach that you ain't even got the holy ghost unless you speak in tongues they'll give you a book and i'll set you over in a corner and give you a class on how to just jammer and stammer and just just put a few clicks and claps together and all of us now you've got the holy ghost well let me tell you this if just clicking and clacking gives you the holy ghost then every duck out there in the pond's got it but we ain't a bunch of people that's clicking and clacking we know exactly who we are we know that we've been redeemed we know that we're sitting under a prophet's message we're not just sitting here wondering who we are do we have it or do we not have you received the message have you received the person of jesus christ it's not about a tape you've heard me say it a hundred times but young girls it ain't just about having a picture it ain't just about just being able to recognize william branham as a prophet but it's being able to be identified with the same pillar fire that you've met him face to face life to life well brother random is preaching brother adam's preaching that he starts talking about that star that come down over the ohio river and he starts talking about he said matter of fact here he comes now he said look he said god never parts from his commission god never parts from his commission and i was me and me and sister katie we were riding back from a meeting uh a while back we were riding back from a meeting and we were coming across the ohio river we were just kind of going over these things we're we're illustrating it and rehearsing what had happened down there in 1933 what happened down there at that river we began to speak about that and katie spoke up and said these words and said to think that here you are carrying on his commission and preaching this message and when she spoke those words there was a being that that dropped into the car he dropped into the car because it identified that we are carrying on this last day's message when the pentecostals wouldn't carry it on there's a people that's elected to carry it on and i want you to know that being set there we fellowship with that being we recognize who it was and i'll tell you how upset the devil got because of a being got in the room i come to as close as being in a wreck and killing somebody that i've ever come in my life there was a man that was working out in the street a highway worker and he didn't even have a clue i was behind him had headphones on he was standing out in the middle of the road and i was able to get the vehicle stopped feet away from running over top of that man if it would not have been for that for that being being in that car i'd have been a murderer today but because but because there was an angel that stepped into a car he kept you let me preach to you on yourself right here because there was a being that guarded you that guided you and kept you it led you to this truth it led you to this message it kept you from being a murderer it kept you from being a drug addict it kept you from being alcoholic it kept it from the world and it made you a lady of grace yes i believe that angel's still here i'll tell you what i moved i moved like never before we're in the greatest season that we've ever been in we're in the greatest hour that we've ever been in we're in the greatest closing hours of the ministry that we've ever been in and to think where we are as a body of jesus christ it moves me it hits me in my gut it it moves me so if i'm going to do anything if we've only got a few moments of time i'm going to do what i was called to do i'm not going to do what men say that i should do i'm going to do what god said for me to do and i'm going to preach this message i'm going to preach it harder i'm going to preach it harder i'm going to preach it straight i'm going to preach it because god has commissioned us to preach this message and get himself a wife a wife that has made herself ready so let's live this message if there's anything worth living for it's this message if there's anything worth dying for it's this message it's none other than jesus christ if we expect our young girls to be filled with the holy ghost let's preach the message if we expect our young boys to stay away from homosexuality let's preach the message if we expect our young girls not get impregnated by some rotten scoundrel let's preach the message so excuse me i'm just preaching what william branham preached and i believe if i preach what william branham preached it'll provide jesus christ the messenger a lady of grace [Applause] i've experienced this message you've experienced this message if it would not been for this message sarah if it wouldn't have been for this message your story would have been different if it wouldn't have been for this message you would not be here but thank god there was a message that went out and said come out of her my people that think about where you're sitting at today god so wanted you that he wouldn't let dirty hands on you god so wanted you that no devil in hell mamas it'll be the same message if you keep it before your children it'll be the same message that'll provide for you hallelujah [Music] what are we living at where are we living at we're not living in the restoration of the gifts we're living right here we were so close that you can study you can study and he he comes off the pages and he sits down beside you i asked michael ray when he was going through brother ed biscuit's testimony i asked him said what what stood out to you the most it's your granddaddy being an eyewitness with the prophet of the lord what stood out to you the most he said what stood out to me the most is when brother eddie would have come to his hour of work when it come to his time for his lunch break he didn't take it like other men took it he set out a chair for himself and he set out a chair for the lord and he said he would just bump knees just want to converse and fellowship with him we have entertained him we have washed his feet we've poured our anointing upon him thank god we love you god we worship you god we thank you now i know what it's like for us as human beings i know what it's like for us as human beings like the presence that you're in right now i know what it's like for you you don't want to leave it you just want to stay right there at his feet you just you know long as soon as we dismiss today you'll start talking about next week you'll start talking about oh i just can't wait to get back into his presence and it creates a worship and it creates a praise now i know what it's like for us as human beings and this is what i'm wanting to give to you children i know what it's like for us to long to be in his presence but can you imagine the anticipation of almighty god i've waited for 2000 years they barred me at the doors of creeds and dogmas they barred me at their they wouldn't let me in but brother brandon i'm setting the feast of the trumpets he said she's going to be liberated there's finally a church that has put on the full garment i've waited he failed me the ecclesiastical moves they failed me the church world they failed me but brother burnham said in christ the mystery of god revealed that this bride is predestinated not to fail him she will have queen authority she'll be born of his bone life of his life power of his power anointing of his anointing now you're aware you're already aware that he's here let me just express this just a little bit deeper because you are who you are i have come to you because you are who you are esther you will never be a vastly you will never you will never refuse my presence you will never push me away you'll never say you'll not come to my banquet but because i summoned you you have came you have came i have longed for you as the song of solomon said i have found the one that my soul has longed for oh she is my dog she is my everything oh she is great she is decked in splendor i tried dressing her through the 2000 years and she'd come as close as she would ever be in acts that's why i caused a preview in this day i caused a preview in this day there she came forth her garments were spotless but i watched the church of every age and then i watched the church of america and william branham said oh god after all this circling the years of this circling these worlds is that the best that i can offer you there was a voice said the bride will come and preview again she'll be just like she was back there at the book of acts to think about today that god has waited for an hour of restoration that god has always had a people that he would represent him here on earth and thank god that the book of job has come to pass that i will restore all the years that the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm they ate off of her the catholic system tried to eat away the grace of god the powers of satan tried to eat away the power of god but there was a message of restoration and god i know some of you ain't ready for it but i'm telling you to get ready because god has anticipated this hour god has anticipated resurrection mourning and it's just around the corner when the prophet said that it was between the hours of six and nine he would tell us that it's coming by our way i'm telling you get ready because god has longed for this hour oh today we are gathered here in the sight of god and all of these witnesses this lady has spent a long time preparing herself she wanted everything right she wanted her head right according to first corinthians 11. she wanted to dress where according to ephesians 4. she wanted a baptism correctly right according to acts 2. and she wanted to come here before him like ephesian five she wanted to come before him she spent the day getting her hair just right she spent the day getting the gown all the wrinkles out of it because this is a bride that will be without spot i should be without wrinkle the music is playing in the background the ushers are taking their place as all the angels sit around and sit back and watch everything's in order now you've seen weddings but you've never seen a wedding like this you've seen lilies but you've never seen lilies like this you've seen roses but you've never seen them like this as the music begins to play it begins to echo out a love song to him now i don't know about you but when i go to a wedding there's a lot of people that have their eyes on the bride but i always turn my gaze to look at the bridegroom because he's seeing her for the very first time dress the way she's dressed let me take you just a little bit further here the lord jesus christ has been watching you make yourself ready he's not like us in our human capacity he's here to make sure that the dress fits the right way he's making sure that you don't cut it off too short that you don't cut off a little john 3 16 and acts 4. he's making sure that you that you're decorating yourself around he's wanting to make he is so wanting you to get all of these details just right that he gives you over 1200 sermons to dress yourself with as the minister takes his place and the groom takes his place that bridegroom to be his heart is pounding like never before you know what it's like you know what it's like when you see the one that you love put on the gown put on the gown that you paid for and is everybody rises as all the angels gather around and watch her walk in through the courts there come out a call let all rise i've waited for this day [Music]
