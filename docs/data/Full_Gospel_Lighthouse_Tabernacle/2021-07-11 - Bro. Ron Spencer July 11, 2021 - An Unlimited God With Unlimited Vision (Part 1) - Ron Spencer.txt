testifies of unshakable souls who held nothing so dear as their burning commitment to cries the blood ran more freely than streams to the sea they would not abandon the cross counting it glory to die for the lord and every gain has but lost oh the sun shines fair on these welcoming hills as they ring with the echoes of faith of unshakable souls who gave all for his will running into god's arms and these welcoming hills they were willing to pray they were willing to preach they were willing to struggle and fight their unfaltering witness was true to the end like the sun in the bright morning sky beneath meadows of heather where once they stood strong their broken and weary bones rest while they sing and rejoice to eternity's song in the kingdom of sweet righteousness oh the sun shines fair on these welcoming hills as they ring with the echoes of faith of unshakable souls who gave all for his will running into god's arms and these welcoming [Music] hills [Music] [Music] oh the sun shines

morning to turn the turn the sword loose and we're just thrilled to to be here we have prayed for we slipped out very quickly last night and the reason being was brother jonathan came down and had prayer for sister karen by proxy and we prayed for her and then brother jonathan immediately we went up through the door we were on face time with with brother tim and brother timothy and sister karen and uh and this is a phenomenal thing her eyes were open her lights were on she was very much aware of things that was going on now we got a million and million million miles to go but we're praying we're praying and so she's had five major brain bleeds and uh literally been non-responsive the other day maybe about a week ago brother timothy was in the room with her and unprompted you remember what brother branham was saying here on the pulpit the other day when brother timothy was out there and just his ipad began to play brother branham's message in 1956 and brother branham was talking about down from his glory timothy was in the room with her the other day she don't know anything about the happenings of being happening here and uh the extent of her conversation has been i love you or hello and that's that's been the extent and uh she began to say these words down from his glory ever living story my god and savior came amen and jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a stranger a man of sorrows tears in agony same words brother branham was quoting here amen let's sing a course together this morning oh how i love him amen [Music] maybe maybe [Music] let's just start it to first maybe that'd be the way down from his glory [Music] ever [Music] my god [Music] is [Music] a stranger [Music] [Applause] uh let's just sing it with all of our hearts this morning my breath my [Music] is [Applause] [Music] i say [Music] [Music] god [Music] hallelujah maybe you have a need this morning you just like to raise your hand to the lord he's here we don't even have to ask him to come now he's here we're going to speak to you about an unlimited great god won't you just let him come and manifest himself to you he's just that kind of a personal god he made your fingerprint different than anybody else he made your eye as we heard last night 70 million different cells in your eye and it's different than any other human being on the earth [Music] he's just that kind of a special god to you today heavenly father we feel your presence even now [Music] now we ask you that you would come and take complete control of this service hallelujah what an awesome god you are now lord we ask you that you would touch sister karen today so my buddy brother tim walked out of the hospital last night he said i feel more confident than ever before [Music] lord jesus we ask you that you would anoint our hearts this morning as we sit together this is the most important thing we'll do throughout our week lord may we mel make you welcome just now come we worship you and love you with all of our hearts minister to every need here today you're a god big enough to handle every situation in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen god bless you if you will turn with me to psalms chapter 8 and verse 1. thank you i want to quote a scripture before i go there and in luke chapter 1 and verse 37. and this scripture is incredibly powerful and i want us to grab a hold of it for with god nothing shall be impossible for with god nothing shall be impossible i want to speak to you this morning on an unlimited god amen with unlimited vision oh lord our lord psalms 8 and 1 how excellent is thy name in all the earth who has set thy glory above the heavens when i consider thy heavens and the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained verse 4 what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visiteth him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor thou has thou made us him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet all sheep oxygen yea the beast of the field the fowl of the air the fish of the sea and whatsoever passes through the paths of the sea oh lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all of the earth john chapter 3 and verse 16 it's on billboards all over the world it should be on every heart for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life you may be seated this morning john chapter 1 in verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god you want to know god god's in his bible and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made let me tell you how great our god is an invisible god begin to lay it all out in his plan of redemption and he wrote his first bible in the heavens when you look at those stars that are still hanging there they're hanging there since god placed them there they wrote god's first bible now remember this brother branham said he said it was like a halo of light and then that halo of light began to spin and he said one day god spoke and he believed his own word and a son came into existence and then from that sun clinkers began to fall off of it and would fall for maybe millions and millions of light years of miles and it would stop at a certain spot are you with me and then god we understand even today that there's about 70 different universes like ours so our god is unlimited he's not going to run out anytime soon his grace and his mercy and his love everything that god is he is unlimited in and so when we read this all things were made by him and without him was not anything that was made that was made let me just say this to you as a scientist was arguing the theory of god created in the heavens and the earth and brother andrew mentioned it last night the great big bang theory it was a big bank oh yeah i have to agree it was a big game when god does anything it's a big bank but it's not like some scientist darwin theory like this like it was told that the scientist was arguing arguing with god on how god created the heavens and the earth and how that he did it and then finally the god and you know he said took a little dirt and made the earth he said well go get your own dirt in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehendeth it was not remember this our god is infinite our god is infinite he's god he's omnipotent he's omnipresent he's a mission he knows all things all wisdom all time covers all space all power he's infinite and if he isn't that he's not god if he's almighty god he can't do all things he's if he's not almighty god but he is almighty god and he can do all things so that's the way we have to believe him are you with me now oh in the great in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth period and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light and it was good and god divided the light from the darkness now i want you to understand god don't just do that with the earth he does that with you divided the light from the darkness in your life he took your past and your old man and your first nature and your first marriage and he divided it and it divorced it and it's gone it's annihilated it's as though it never happened in the first place only god can do that no school no teachings of a man no influence of a man can do it god in his transforming power can just literally take the light of his presence and cause your darkness to go away somebody gave him a hand this morning brother branham quoting webster he says he said he's an unlimited power that's right primary is ultimate god is the ultimate and he's unlimited and an ultimate is the amen he has the final word i was a little boy sitting in the church and when when brother jackson would come from south africa and what impressed me is he told a story and i would hear him tell it on a video sometime later and you can you can hear it but anyway sydney jackson would stand in the pulpit and you know as children we catch different things and brother jr was brother sydney was standing there and he says he said what impressed me was we had a couple hundred thousand people that had gathered for the meeting he said you know just to hustle a bustle of noise of people moving backwards and forwards sitting in a service going here going there there's just a there's a kind of just a emotion of people that causes noise he said though they would be silent and not talking it just as emotion of people that causes noise and dogs barking it's an outside meeting animals crying out all kind of all kind of things that was going on he said it was just a lot of noise he said he said well you know we had a lot of speakers come but when brother branham stood there and he said i take every spirit i take every spirit under my control he said i'll tell you it became so silent it was deafening not even a dog bart he said i knew that this was more than a ministry of a man brother branham wasn't god but god sent a messenger to the to exhibit what god was like yes he said what is jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever his power is unlimited it's limited to your faith but it's not limited to god let me just say when god saves the worst murderer prostitute rapist religious person it does not diminish his power of his blood one little iota [Applause] when god heals the worst cancer patient in the world the worst patient of sickness in the world it does not diminish his power absolutely none you can name your diseases from now to tomorrow i want you to know tonight god's able to meet every one of them when doctors give up that's when god's able to move [Applause] [Music] i love this his i believe his mercies is unlimited i believe that tonight his mercies to you is unlimited i want to thank god for that today because as humans we see our failures we see one another's mistakes we're all pointers we point here point there but with god he looks through the blood of jesus christ and he don't see your sins the power of forgiveness you ask god to forgive you god places it in his blood and he never remembers it ever again a man wanted to argue that point with me at a graveside and he said god you you said god forgets all your sins and he wanted to argue that point and he was gathering himself a little crowd because he was going to make some fun of me he had his own little crew there he was going to make some fun of me and i just looked at him and i said you better hope that god forgets your sins because the woman that you're with that was married to another man and all of a sudden this little crowd just went like that right there [Applause] jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever [Music] that's a phenomenal statement we sometimes let it roll off of our fingertips and we think our our lips and we go we think you know if i was only here when jesus was here if i was only here when jesus was here or if i was only here when brother branham was here or if i was only here when this preacher was here but jesus is the same yesterday today and forever he's not bound by time or space if you can limit god you can limit christ and if you can limit the church today in its possibilities you're limited in god but all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it and he saith i believe it and i know i've told you the truth who holds the worlds in its orbit it is in our president it isn't the dictators of the world they put their pants on just like everybody else does who holds the worlds in this orbits the power of god who holds your soul think about that you say brother ron i just hope he don't lose me i got news for you if he ever thought of you before the foundation of the world he's not some weasley businessman [Applause] that ostracizes you down and no longer wants to deal with you he's got you from from that eternity to that eternity and we came from god and we're going back to god now on the contrast the power of satan is limited he has boundaries he can only go so far if the god that's on the inside of you that came from god is here today you can tell the devil back off you can take god's unlimited word and tell the enemy you back off now the power of god is unlimited you will get exhausted you will get weary you'll get weary and well-doing god don't god is never on vacation god is never turns off if turns off is this do not disturb son god never not hears your prayer every prayer you pray to jesus christ he heals but you remember you're dealing with a god that sees your future so his no is better than yes somebody always somebody ought to look over at your neighbor say boy that's good so god guards you from yourself [Applause] [Music] god guards you from your own selfish ways and your own selfish natures and your pity me party it's not based on your feelings it's not based on your emotions it's not based on do i feel good this morning are we gonna have church or not it's based on the word of god sometimes we think well god i'm looking for a miracle and it didn't happen yesterday i got news for you i've been fighting for cancer for a year and a half and he told me if you trust me i'll use you like never before i've never doubted that i was going to lose to this cancer i'm a winner and god's a healer he's not limited to it just like with sister karen we're not looking for pity we're not looking for pity we're looking for courage inside of us hallelujah give me courage lord give me strength i'm going to trust your word monday the doctor looked at me said he said i see scar tissue in your brain he said instead of coming back every three months i'm going to put you on a every four month schedule he said are you working every day i said yes sir he said are you preaching every sunday i said yes sir he said you one tough bird hallelujah because you remember that's the same doctor that said we're going to take that brain tumor out and he said we're going to do everything in our our ability to save him and his god will do the rest [Applause] hallelujah he's the man that said i have about four months left to live and that was last july so i'm celebrating an anniversary here let's just call ourself a party let's have a birthday party i'm celebrating an anniversary we call it life hallelujah to god be the glory for what he has done i look at god as unlimited because i realize those doctors can only see what they see but they knows there's another presence in the room are you with me now let me just say this you you're never alone i heard brother andrew talk about the angels of god that are dispatched around you you are better protected than the president of the united states of america because remember you got more power than the angels of god as a son and daughter of god and there's angels that dispatch to watch over you and nothing happens to you by chance sure you're going to have some trouble sure you're going to have some heartaches sure you're going to have to go through some difficult things but you're not going through it by yourself great up your loins pull your sword you were built to fight it's unlimited you're built to fight we read where a man named sampson took a jawbone of an ass and he killed a thousand men why was it not twenty thousand twenty didn't show up one dead [Applause] but he could have killed 20 000 with this unlimited god chapter took a took a six-foot stick and killed 600 men why didn't he kill 6 000 are you getting it because 600 showed up for battle so that's how many he killed just let the devil go fighting on you he never brings enough because you serve an unlimited god we have an unlimited power for all things are possible to them that believe in god i want you to say it with me for all things are possible for all things are possible to them that believe in god don't you walk out of this service whiny and piney and pity me how bad i got it listen put your faith to work man standing at the the fuel pump this morning looked over said it's a good day i said every day is a good day every day is a good day and maybe he couldn't say it with the depth of perception that i can say it with but every day is a good day [Applause] amen you know i was told some time ago brother brahma says that they had a jet plane and it makes them noise as we hear this shakes the windows it's a plane that's got so fast that it crosses its sound barrier you'll like it sandra and when it goes beyond its own sound barrier it's almost unlimited to what it'll do and i think in there that we get a lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of god then it's unlimited what god can do with the man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that is and we see that going beyond the camp unlimited it's just like when the lord he's got a remedy for all these things he's got a remedy for sin i sent andrew a little deal the other day that dropped in my heart i haven't preached it yet but i'll i'll give it to you free here right now the scripture says that there's no temptation no temptation to a believer that catches them unaware but god makes a way of escape for him [Music] and you're going to be tempted in your life because every son and daughter that comes to god god makes a way of escape for you but when you are in the trap the interruptions while the trial is going on is interruptions to catch your attention to get you out [Music] thank god for the interruptions that remind you the checkpoints that remind you it don't have to be this way you don't have to die drunkard you don't have to die a prostitute you don't have to you don't have to be a drug addict it can be better in your life god's made a way of escape for you quit blaming everybody but you quit nobody loves me nobody loves me brother ron nobody wants to be my friend quit being a cactus quit being a cactus and every time somebody gets around you you push their button come on church come on church get in the rain and let those cocoa bears or let those needles become flowers again [Applause] quit coming to church and saying i didn't get nothing because you don't put nothing in [Applause] you sit there with your hands crossed i'm sorry you sit there with your hands cross and go entertain me this ain't an entertainment deal here i don't want to go there but people come to church like it's an entertainment the song leader ain't right they go well it's just didn't sing their song the preacher didn't say nothing that was entertaining to them and yet they can go home and watch a three-hour moody movie that's got a bad ending anyway the same people that'll go to the bathroom 14 times here sit there three hours well it's too loud here what did you do with your rock and roll music years ago you'd blow people out of your car and then you complained because we got a little bit of noise around here [Applause] brother branham said if you don't like noise don't go to heaven he said it's going to be the noisiest place that you've ever been hallelujah i want you to watch the prophet of god and this in this in this quote i want you to break very deeply think of where we are right now and he's speaking in 1964 or five he said if einstein had only had a spiritual application as a physical actor application as he studied the laws of light and so forth he could have told us something amen when i heard his message on that great sinner somewhere in into the skies that ever contacted with that center you could create earths do anything and the power would be unlimited you see he had seen that and he said you see these little pockets going through the air they call them saucers so forth people so that well we better leave that one alone he said hear all these people coming up missing you say don't hear from them they're standing there and they're not there now watch what he's going to do with this that's the way the rapture's going to be one of them will drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a celestial body and they'll they'll be hair or bones left it'll be transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home that and we see all this going on now and the pentagon wondering about these lights now i don't know about you but i'm not crazy they have denied it until this year they have denied and i'm not speaking to you something out of turn our government has denied flying saucers all of this time now listen don't get scared right here brother branham said they were investigating angels and i find it interesting that an unlimited god now i want you to just think about this coal was never used until this day the weight has been used it has laid in the earth since the foundation of the world and man tapped into it in this day all has been in the earth and man tapped into it in this day it is unlimited what god put in this earth but your body was laying in the earth and you were born at a certain time in a certain day and your mother ate your body out of the earth and there's a statement we can use right here there's no place like home because that's where you came from so we have a prophet of god standing not in the best suit necessarily are not necessarily in a group of believers like i'm preaching to today but he simply drops down truths that the world's trying to figure about flying saucers and he just simply says they're investigating angels well brother ron we we've watched a million broadcast on what uvfo's are and brother branham takes about two minutes it just tells you what's that got to do in a sermon on unlimited don't you just think about what's that got to do with the sermon on unlimited god has the answer to every question he says in leadership he said education is coming to its end where are we at science is coming to its end he sat on the he sat up there on a log with brother branham with brother bischoff and he told him he said he said these great big meetings they're coming to their end brother biscuit said i thought i thought they're just getting started he said they're coming to their end and you know what they started having bigger meetings and bigger meetings and and all of a sudden they're just gone i'm a sign a surprise to god are you with me now brother brandon went around the world seven times he never preached in message churches like we're sitting tonight they were full gospel businessmen meetings and they were maybe a pentecostal church that would bring him in or maybe another church that would bring him in and they would fill the place and he would preach to them the truth whether it was in switzerland or finland or south africa or india or jeffersonville or here in harrisonburg [Applause] brother branham went to a couple local places here they didn't want it but an unlimited god knew you were here [Applause] are you with me well where are the believers brother ron they're here [Applause] they're here they're in zimbabwe they're in south africa they're in japan they're in china and china can try to shut them down all they want to but a believer is a believer no matter what pressure that they're
