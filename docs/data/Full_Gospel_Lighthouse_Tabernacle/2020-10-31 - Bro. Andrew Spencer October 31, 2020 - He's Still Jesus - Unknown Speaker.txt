thank you for praying for us today as the funeral transpired and i just want to continue to remember the meadows family and you know it's one thing about about pastoring you or something some funerals that you just you dread and there's some funerals that you dread to even do because you love that person so much and you think there's no way that you can say enough words about this this person and sister irene fit the bill every way possible so we just want to be remembering the whole meadows family us as a church family we're more than more than just a church family we're brothers and sisters in christ and we're serving a great big god that's that's going to get us all there where she is at so let's just sing to him tonight won't you welcome into your pew god's going to do something very special here tonight he already started to work in the back office and that's why i myself brother ron were just a few seconds from stepping out because god's doing something special oh you are god alone from before time began you were on your throne for you are god alone and right now [Music] who you are [Music] we are the only god whose power or none can contain [Music] you're the only god who's worthy of everything we can do you are god and that's just the way it is [Music] oh you were on your throne yes you are god alone you're unchangeable [Music] you're unchangeable you're unshakable or unstoppable [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] for you my god lord jesus there is no god like jehovah lord we have already felt your presence lord as you were stirring the water as it were as we begin to step into the atmosphere of an awesome god lord you begin to quickly allow us to recognize that you are here in this building and you are willing to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think lord when we begin to think about that that just one time in your presence it changes every situation that that the angel of the lord makes the difference in this service in this in this moment in this time we begin to think about how powerful you are all of our problems begin to fade away and become so small or when we begin to reflect and think about the almighty power of god that has never diminished lord i pray tonight that you would move across this congregate here and by the way of the internet whoever may be listening father lord i pray that you would discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart i pray that you would extend through the airways father and lord may we just tap into the channel of the holy spirit father and may you begin to move with compassion upon your people now you move in a very special way father we would say that that did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way god i pray that you'd move like only you could move in jesus name amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll turn over in the book of hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. hallelujah hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. i'd like to speak to you tonight on he's still jesus he's still jesus i think we could all quote it my heart let's just read it together jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever may god bless his word you may be seated this evening in the presence of the lord that word same is a very powerful word and to think about that that this god that we speak of that that jesus christ is identical yesterday as he is today and he will be exactly the same he's not changing he's not he's not he's not having to be changed he's the same and brother branham would refer to this this one scripture of hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever over 3 100 times it would be the theme of this message that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and to think about all the things that are going on in the world today when this world is in absolute disarray when it seems so discombobulated when it seems like it's about to spin off of its axis but yet jesus is still the same and here our prophet would come and he would spread he would speak to us a world that has fallen apart but yet god's not falling apart when we see a shift of powers in the demonic realm and government's realm and and you see that truly that lay odyssey is absolutely at work and that change is always happening and you can look around in in our in our in our area and see the beauty of this color that god has painted across these mountains and you see that seasons are changing it's telling us that that winter's just at hand we we buried our precious sister today sister irene it tells us that life is always changing but there's one thing that always remains the same and that is jesus he is god and there is no god but jesus there's not a third person there's not a second person he is jesus and it's not a he's not a mythical god he's not an imaginary god that is setting that is setting out there but he's a living god and it's what is that living god it's the word in you making itself real and no believer of this word will ever place god's word back somewhere in the past they will never make this god a weakling or a historian god yes he's a god of history of course but he's he's a shame because the bible said that he's the same when you take up this bible you are taking up the literal word of our lord jesus christ you are holding god in bible form that he's the same yesterday today and forever and a real believer's not going to put him back there in the past somewhere you because you see he cannot lose his power and he's not changing he's still jesus he's still jesus now the bible said in matthew 4 and 23 that and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had palsy and he healed them he's still jesus today i want you to know you can take every one of your infirmities you can take every one of your loved ones needs and i want to tell you that he's still jesus that if they could bring things to him in that day with hard hard circumstances heart diseases hard situations but there were a people that believed that he was the messiah and he healed them because he was jesus and now now if jesus is and god forgive me for saying if i don't mean to be and i don't mean to be sacrilegious but to make a point that if jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we have the same desire then why can't we see him if he's still the same is there anybody here that would like to see jesus tonight now he has to be the same if the bible says he's the same is that right and he's the same savior he's the same healer and he's just the same as he was the only thing different about him he's now he's now an invisible body there where he was in a visible body but he's promised that a little while and the world won't see me but yet you'll see me i will be with you even in you to the consummation of the h that he would be with you into the end of the world his first commandment i am the lord and there is no god like me i am god and i change not so if jesus of the bible healed then then jesus of today heals now if jesus of the bible delivered then he delivers now if jesus of the bible does save then he has to save now if jesus of the bible filled with the holy ghost sin he's got to fill with the holy ghost now are you with me why then why in the world would we allow satan to stack up in our mind that we can't have all that he's promised to us but the bible says to us in romans 8 and 31 that what shall we say to these things that if god be for us who can be against us who can be against us if jesus is still jesus who can be against us how can we not have all of these things that he's promised us if jesus is still jesus is there anything too hard for the lord and he's that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us now how shall he not freely give us all things the bible tells us he'll give us freely all things then why shouldn't we have it if he's still jesus then why can't we believe that he's still jesus if he healed the lunatics then then why can't the jesus of the day heal the lunatics of today are you with me if jesus of the bible when they would bring hard cases to him and he would move with compassion and he would heal their sickness why can't he do it today i think that's a great question if he's still jesus then why can't he do the same thing that he did then if he's still the same yesterday today and forever you remember when when the disciples in john chapter 9 when the disciples when they were walking with jesus and they asked him when they seen the blind man that was sitting there they asked him who did sin his parents or himself and jesus answered them neither himself nor his parents but that the work and that the glory of the lord would be made manifest in him and jesus said that i must work the work of him that sent me that while it is day while it is day the night cometh when no man can work and as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world now the thing about this is that that that there were people on the earth in that day that were the so-called message believers of the day that believed every jot and tittle that they were lining it up in every way possible and those priests had to know they had to know all the the scrolls in certain ways that when they would roll up that scroll they had to be able to stick a pen through that scroll and tell you exactly what that pen was going through but here they had read all of these things they read about moses they read about elijah but here the man jesus was getting ready to do something so unorthodox to what they read here jesus goes to preaching that this was to do because of the work of the lord that it would be manifest in him and jesus had been preaching so much that jesus began to spit on the ground you see well some people get all excited we'll say man i've seen the preacher all slobber and everything you better just watch out he may use that spittle to put it in your eyes and bring eyesight to yourself because that's what jesus was doing he's sitting there preaching and all of a sudden something moves on him and jesus takes this spittle he gets down in the dirt and he starts taking that spittle and he makes clay out of that spill and he takes and he starts rubbing it together and he starts making himself some mud cakes how many children ever made some mud cakes back in the day how many still make them today well here jesus is making some mud cakes and all of a sudden he takes the mud case and he rubs it on the blind man's eyes and he tells a blind man to go by the pool of shalom which means sin and go down and wash your eyes now notice what he did he went and he did everything that jesus told him to do and when the blind man comes back here he is the people and the neighbors that once knew him begin to talk now is that the man that sat there and begged and they were questioning whether he was him or whether he was not but here all of a sudden the blind man speaks up i am he you see because he had recognized that they were talking about somebody that once was blind but he was getting ready to tell them that i am no longer blind i used to sit in that condition but jesus came by my way he came by my way now look the bible said that they marveled at this they didn't marvel because of the mud they didn't marvel because of spit but they marveled because he obeyed what jesus told him to do it's a hard thing sometimes to believe what jesus is telling you to do he might ask you in an unorthodox way of that you need to do this or do that but if jesus said it and you believe it and you act upon what he said it may be unorthodox it may seem funny to the outside realm but i'm telling you if you believe and act upon his promises the results that will come will be a blessing to your life there'll be a blessing to your life in such a way that i could say today that he's still jesus now remember now and brother branham dealing in a prayer line he said now remember we're dealing with blind spirits that when they come out of one they they try to go to another so that just so just that you might know keep your head bowed this is important that you let your children listen just now so just that you might know keep your head bowed until you ask till you're asked to look up for it might be a few days from now you might not have sight but wait till you hear me say raise your head because when you look the eye is the gate of the soul well you say well brother branham that's psychology he said if it is then jesus used it he took a blind man and led him away from the crowd and took him outside of the city and prayed for him get him away from the crowd now pray and when he went to raise jairus daughter he put everybody outside of the house and he's still jesus tonight whether the woman will be able to see i don't know she's standing here totally blind in darkness now have faith in god and believe while i pray for her please now sister now now keep your head bowed and let the lids of your ovary let the lids over your eye over your blind eyes be closed while i ask our lord jesus believe that he's going to break forth and shrink up those demons in here that you'll be able to see your father dear as i stand by a blind woman one set along the highway begging and then jesus came along oh come near lord there might have been there might have been many there that had faith i don't know i wasn't there lord but i know you met and gave blind bartimaeus aside and when he's when he could see i believe that he tried to follow you he said this poor this poor little mother standing here she's blind lord you know her i'm just a man i've tried to represent you push back the blackness for her will you lord break forth sight in those blind eyes we don't ask for miracles lord but just something to encourage that would make her know that you're the son of god and i'll be your servant lord to tell them the truth i believe if you'll do it lord everyone in here would accept you right then please do now will you hear my prayer as i ask you with all of my heart in jesus name now satan this duel of faith you claim her and i claim her for jesus i claim you have no power over her i claim you have no power over nothing jesus christ my lord stripped you and robbed you of everything that you had and every legal rights at calvary i stand here as his representative and you know he's on the platform and you know he's on the platform you know all about this gift satan knew where he was at that he was getting ready to lose the battle the angel was at the platform the ministry of the son of man was at the platform you know about where he ministered and how he did it and i charge thee by the living god that you come out of that woman and leave her in jesus christ's name every head bowed let me see your eyes first i will call you speaking to the audience i'll call you if something happens now just raise your head can you see me put your hands on my nose amen open your eyes the woman can see she's got her sight it was a blind spirit that was holding her bound brother branham would say now he said now maybe if you had a band on your arm that was that was cutting off the circulation he said that's how that spirit goes in there and it cuts off the circulation so that your optical nerve can't work to its right ability and what faith does is faith cuts that band and what you were watching was when the angel began to move close to that blind spirit that that blind spirit had to take its leave because it recognized that this was still jesus i want to say to you church that if you could ever get in his presence one time the demons that haunt you your fears that haunt you the depression that haunts you the afflictions that haunt you all of the sickness that afflicts you and haunts you those demons will recognize that he's still jesus you may not believe it the politics of the world may not believe it but he's still jesus oh hallelujah i want you to know that cancer is a real believer in jesus depression's a real believer in jesus because they know that when jesus shows up they get kicked out and i say to you in the name of the lord he's still jesus you see satan was trying to rob her of what was rightfully hers and shape will try to rob you from your inheritance he'll try to cheat you from your inheritance but i want to tell you that god ain't changed his mind about you and he ain't changed his mind about his word confirmation of the commission he said i've heard people say that this was a bunch of crazy people i've heard the same thing said about you i had people tell me that when i received the holy ghost that i lost my mind well whether that's right or not i don't know but there's one thing i do know wherein i once was a sinner but now i'm saved and wherein i once was lost but now i'm found you can call it fanaticism whatever you want to but it's a confirmation to me that he still jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah hallelujah if they were preaching jesus in acts chapter 2 and all of a sudden the holy ghost came down and all of a sudden the holy ghost went to act and what were they doing they were preaching in jesus name miracles were in jesus name if he's still jesus tonight then why can't we have a miracle in this place why can't we have diseases cast out if he's still jesus if the angel of the covenant is still behind this message then why can't we expect a body change whoa hallelujah the bible said in acts 19 11 that they took cloths napkins off of paul's body and the bible said that special miracles were done we've seen supernatural things happen by prayer cloths being laid on people i can hear a prophet say now now i'm not saint paul but he's still jesus i've heard of people that they would take a prayer cloth much like i carry tonight here one that brother william branham prayed over and there were people that were dealing with ulcers and dealing with tumors and they were watching as a preacher was preaching with that prayer cloth and they said and then they watched a strand fall off of it and that preacher would take that strand and he would lay it there and that woman that was dealing with tumors she came up and said can i can i have that strand can i have that strand and she was dealing with all of these things on the inside of her stomach and when she by faith took that she said i would do more than just lay it on my body she stuck it in her mouth and swallowed it and within a very few days all of those things were completely gone it ain't the napkin it's he steal jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah when when peter was walking down the street there were people that were saying lay me out in the street so that his shadow can pass over me and when peter's shadow would pass over him they would be completely whole what was it it was who peter was preaching it wasn't peter it wasn't the man it was jesus in the man hallelujah hallelujah are not we his children tonight are we not as children are we not believers of this message it was the angel that vindicated the message it was not william branham himself he said i'm just standing close when he comes hallelujah i've been there in brother and brother ron spencer's ministry and seen as the angel the lord would come and do supernatural things hey i was quick to recognize that my daddy did not have the ability with only in his own humanistic standpoint to reveal those things but i watched as the angel of the lord begin to move i've watched it when men that would come evangelists would come and stand behind this pulpit and they would read the very secrets of the heart i recognize real quick that he's still jesus i hope you don't get tired of my title tonight because i want you to know if you leave here and you don't know this one thing know this he's still jesus look at your neighbor elbow your neighbor elbow your family member say hey wake up he's still jesus hallelujah for jesus said as he's closing out the hours of his ministry right before his ascension in mark 16 he said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in buddha's name shall they cast out devils it'll never work in the name of the trinity it'll never work in the name of the pope it'll never work but he said in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall they shall it's not a poor debate it's not an if behind it but they shall recover you can lay your hands over on your mother over on your boyfriend over on your wife and you will watch the miracles of god transpire if you are a believer because he's still jesus he's still jesus over coronavirus he's still jesus over cancer hallelujah he's still jesus over laodicea he's still jesus over death so why shouldn't we believe that these signs shall follow them that believe if he still jesus if he's still jesus then why shouldn't we believe for all things to be possible is there anything too hard for the lord hallelujah hallelujah all that i am you're here too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word you speak the word you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it cannot fail [Music] wake up i'm only getting started you see because if god speaks to you and he sends you how many are your children are you children of the king tonight so if god speaks to you and send you he backs up what you say if you're an ambassador from heaven all of heaven is behind you and heaven is consistent of the word now i want you know you can walk out in confidence if he has sent you because all of heaven is behind you take a look take a look at my entourage all of heaven is behind me you can't pack them in a limousine you can't pack them in all the cars in the united states there is all of heaven that is behind me donald trump ain't got as much security as i do oh heaven is behind me and if heaven is behind me hell can't be against me because heaven is for me i'm just crazy enough to believe it because he's still jesus now look the bible didn't say these signs will follow william branham he didn't say it would follow oral robbers only he didn't say it would follow brother cop or somebody these signs shall follow them plural that believe if they lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover it's the power of god that's in you that brings the life to the person that you got your hand on the life-giving source of the holy ghost you can stay there if you want but there's going to be how would you say three or four black eyes for him tonight he's got more ice than i got brother nate said give him three or four black eyes he must get back up again so if he's going to try to get back up so why shouldn't we just preach to him a little bit why shouldn't we just go ahead and tell him why we believe and who we believe that he's still jesus he's still the almighty he's still the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and we are abraham's seed being dead in christ and we take on abraham's seed and our heirs according to the promise why shouldn't we believe the supernatural why shouldn't we believe that but tg i'm doing this everything that's everlasting everything that's real is uncertain unscientifically proved the whole armor of god is completely supernatural love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith every armor the whole army of christianity is supernatural then why shouldn't we believe in supernatural things if the entire army of the christian faith is supernatural we look at the unseen and not what we see so why shouldn't we believe when jesus is standing there in matthew 17 and 20 he said because of your unbelief verily i say unto you that if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed he's not talking about the size of it it's one of the smallest seeds but jesus is not talking about the size of the seed he's talking about the power of that seed that that mustard seed can't be mixed i say unto you that if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain that means had a mountain in their life that if you shall say unto this mountain remove hence the underplace and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you hallelujah he's still jesus and you're still you brother denny he's still jesus and if he's still jesus then why shouldn't we ask because jesus said in matthew 7 and 7 ask and it shall be given you why shouldn't we ask if he told us to why shouldn't we asking it shall be given to you why shouldn't we seek because he said if you seek you shall find me knock and it shall be opened unto me why shouldn't we do these things why shouldn't we do these things for everyone that asketh receiveth why shouldn't you ask if you know you're going to get it hey what a great program thank you jesus and he that seeketh findeth and he that knocketh it shall be opened unto you why shouldn't we ask if we know we're gonna get why shouldn't we give if jesus is still jesus then why shouldn't we give our tithe unto the lord if jesus can still pour out a blessing if jesus can take your ten percent and do a whole lot better with it than you can do with your 100 percent then why shouldn't we give to jesus he said give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together running over and shall give men under your bosom why shouldn't we give when jesus said it's more blessed to give than it is to receive if he's still jesus then why shouldn't we confess why shouldn't we when the bible tells us in first john 4 15 that whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god why shouldn't we confess when paul tells us in hebrews 4 and 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed in the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession why shouldn't we confess if jesus is still jesus and his word is as good as it was 2 000 years ago and he ain't lost his power then why shouldn't we confess his name before all men if he's still jesus then why should we not be confident in his promise for the bible said in proverbs 3 and 26 for the lord shall be thy confidence it ain't in yourself it's in him for the lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken if he's still jesus then why shouldn't we be courageous when the bible says in deuteronomy 31 and 6 be strong and of a good courage and fear not nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee and he told joshua in joshua 1 and 7 only be thou strong and very courageous if he's still jesus then why can't we be courageous in 2020. when everybody else is becoming weaklings when everybody else is falling apart when everybody else is letting down the standard why shouldn't we have a little bit of courage about ourselves if jesus is still jesus and he said that i will give you an overcoming power i'll fill you with myself then why can't we be courageous tonight and stand in his promises if he's still jesus then why shouldn't we go to church i'm just going to stay and stream if jesus is still jesus and his bible's still the bible and his promises are still the promises if jesus said go to church i'm going to church if jesus said paint your hair everywhere but could what but gray if he would say blue i'd paint it blue if he said green i'd paint it green if he said red well i already got it but if he said it i believe it and if jesus said to forsake not the assembling of yourselves so much as you see the day approaching i'm going to be at church when the doors open as david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the lord if jesus is still jesus and he said that he'd meet me where two or three are gathered in my name if jesus is still jesus i'm going to gather in his name i'm going to worship in his name i'm going to praise in his name i'm going to shout in his name and i'm going to dance in his name if he's still jesus if he's still jesus then why shouldn't we believe in healing will you say brother andrew your church seems a little bit shook up here lately you've had four funerals and you want to preach on healing absolutely how much more perfect could sister irene's healing be then what she got how much more perfect for sister katie and brother john how much perfect can it be when jesus come and completely healed them you say well i was praying all the way through i was praying all the way through too but jesus did the work that only he could do where they are they ain't got to worry about old age where they are they ain't going to worry about a 401k they ain't got to worry about who's getting in in 2020. they know jesus is king oh hallelujah if he's still jesus then why shouldn't we take him at his word do you believe he's still jesus and that the bible tells us that surely he hath borne our griefs isaiah 53 and 4 and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken spitting of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed if he's still jesus then why should we believe this you see your sickness as well as your sins were laid on jesus at calvary and you know that if jesus bore your infirmities and your sickness you no longer need to bear them do you believe that everything that was stacked up against you was put on jesus then you don't have to carry that burden no more i watched i watched as the spirit of the lord one night began to deal with a young lady here that was carrying a tremendous burden and when all of a sudden the spirit of the lord spoke to me and tell her tell her that i she don't need to carry that burden i carried it a long time ago i watched as the spirit of the lord came down and lifted that thing off of her why should you carry your burdens when jesus already carried your burdens why should you try to beat yourself over your sins when jesus was already beat for your sins if he's still jesus then why don't we take him at his word he said psalms 103 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord on my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all of thy diseases is he still jesus jeremiah 30 and 17 for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds saith the lord if he's still jesus isaiah 40 and 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength verse 31 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint he is still jesus when a leper came to him and began to worship him and begin to speak to him and he said will thou make me clean if thou will thou can't make me clean and jesus said i will be thou clean and at that moment immediately the leper was cleansed if you walked into this building with sin on your life as a leper you can be thou cling because as i said i will be thou clean when the blind man in john chapter 9 and the message believers of the day that knew everything about it they come to him and he said when his parents were too ashamed to say what had happened they came to him and they said give god praise this man is a sinner he so whether he's a sinner or not i don't know but this thing i wonder i do know that once i was blind but now i see he's still jesus this i know that he i once was blind but now i see this i know i once was lost when i couldn't find my way home when i was strung out on drugs and i was praying god if you'll get me home and not let me wreck i'll serve you the rest of days of my life and jesus got me home and jesus never left me jesus has never forsaken me and i want to say this to you if you've got somebody that struck out on cigarettes strung out on drugs shrug out on alcohol strung out on sin jesus is still jesus that black shadow that keeps following you jesus is still jesus that demon of hell that's telling you that you're gonna have to deal with that pain the rest of your life jesus is still jesus whew i ain't peter and i ain't paul but i am in truth and i know that jesus is still jesus give him a hand clap a praise because he's still jesus he's still jesus psalm 77 and 14 thou art the god that dost wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the people he's still jesus when jesus had the ability to heal all people but yet he would only do as the father would show him when he walked in in john chapter 5 at the bull at the pool of bethesda and he walks in there and there he laid a man that was dealing with this infirmity for 38 years and jesus began to speak to him he began to speak to him he began to talk to him everybody else around it everybody else around him he had the power to heal everybody but because the father had showed him this one he walked to this one he said will thou be made whole he said i would but when the time and the seasons come there's have no man to put me down in the water and jesus said take up thy bed and walk and he walked away there with his palate that he had set on for years upon years upon years and he walked out of there if he's still jesus you can walk you can tell about it if he's still jesus you can walk as brother shannon sings it if he walked out of the grave i'mma walk into if he believed jesus i'm believing jesus too if he accepted jesus i'll accept jesus too no matter what you're going through he's still jesus if he's still jesus then why shouldn't we lift up his name when his name is above every name there's neither salvation in any other name but by the name of jesus that at the name of jesus christ every demon has to take his leave the bible said in acts chapter 3 and translate over into chapter 4 that when they begin to deal with them we deal with peter and john that they took knowledge and they took notice that they had been with jesus that these men were unlearned when they walked up to that man that had laid there for all those years lame at the at the beautiful gate and walked up there and he began he began to look on him and he said he was asking for homes but peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk what was it it was the same jesus that was working through peter and working through john working through the apostles and if he's still jesus all of hell has to take notice that we've been with jesus we may be unlearned we may seem like we ain't got a very good education but all of hell has to notice that we've been with jesus take notice tonight all of hell full gospel lighthouse has been with jesus oh don't get nervous on me it's them demons that are running they're noticing that you are in the presence of an almighty god and he's still the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] [Music] if he healed a blood issue for 12 years and he's still jesus he can still do the same if he brought life to a dead womb that was almost 90 years old he can change every molecular cell in your body and make it produce everything that he has predestined you to do he's still jesus and this is a faith that was delivered to the saints producing the same works same power same works same wonder same life because he is still jesus i hope this is okay brother nathaniel if it ain't you can tell me and they brothers can edit the tape but i believe that there's power in sons and daughters of god the bible says lay hands on a sick and they shall recover brother nathanael had gotten he's had to deal with patience on every level but he had to deal with an individual a man that was that was actively dying and he went into the room and every time he would get close brother nathanael would take him by the hand he'd take him by the hand just somebody to be there and every time he'd take him by the hand he would kind of revive himself and just level out he'd come too close to the end again brother nathanael came and he knew that he was actively dying that he just wanted to be there he come that close and when brother nathaniel laid his hands on him he kind of revived a bit and finally brother nathaniel realized that it's the power that's working in me that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and when he went in the room and he didn't lay his hands on him he was able to pass away from this life because there's so much power that's setting in the throne room of a believer if it has that much power to revive a dead man that was actively dying what will it do when you lay your hands when you are sick when you are afflicted when you're going through trials when it seems nobody loves you when it seems like everybody else is give up around you what will it do when a believer goes to laying his hands on a sick they shall recover because he's still jesus i was standing right here at this altar one night brother randy hickel came down here for prayer and all of a sudden brother ann randy has dealt with cancer dear issues throughout his life and had to deal with all kinds of things but there at that altar i can tell you when the spirit of the lord came down it began to reach out it felt like an electroshock went through my body and went transferred right to him i still have the paper in my bible randy henkel didn't accept cancer on this such and such day we're not going to accept cancer this day nor tomorrow because jesus is still jesus we will not accept depression because jesus is still jesus we will not accept suicide because jesus is still jesus we won't accept back pain because jesus is still jesus brother herald we won't accept heart issues because jesus is still jesus brother on completely healed because jesus is still jesus sister erica parker jesus is still jesus every believer that's sitting under the sound of the voice he's still jesus so why shouldn't we believe him to do the same thing that he did then do it right now that same angels in the building that same powers here that same anointing's here and he still jesus what's in your hand what's in your mouth the name of jesus have you ever been around us spencer's we go to an auction we want something we gonna get it we're goal-oriented man i knew dad looked at a guy one time he looked at a guy one time he's don't mess with me i'm getting that and this guy got so upset i mean he was he was some kind of man and it don't help when his son's right behind him go ahead go ahead go ahead and when i see somebody getting all up tight because they really want something it just puts a little fire on there but this is my philosophy and my concept that if you want something bad enough you'll keep your hand up at an auction but if you don't want something don't keep your hand up if you accidentally sneeze they'll put it on your ticket but if you really want something bad enough you keep your hand up hey when it comes to an auction we're vicious we don't care we gotta overpay it if we want it i don't care what the price is i'm gonna pay for it if i really want it it may take me i may have to go through the rain i may have to go through the snow i may have to go through hell and high water but if i want something i'm going to keep my hands up and my hands are lifted up that i want complete deliverance for ron spencer full gospel lighthouse hell may be against you but keep your hands up we want this bad all hell's got to take notice that our hands are up i've been with jesus and i ain't backing up well you say it's just for joy keep your hands uh you say it's just for peace keep your hands up if you say it's just for healing keep your hands up i want it and if i want it i'm gonna get it because the father's head all things are freely given unto you and if god be for me who can be against me hell can try to put these hands down hell can try to put these hands down but as moses had somebody come by and hold his hands up so that joshua could defeat the enemy oh if you ain't got strength to hold your hands up brother jeffrey i'll come and hold your hands up if you ain't got strength brother nate to hold your hands up i'm gonna hold your hand because i believe that jesus is still jesus why shouldn't we believe in a place called heaven when he's told us all about it whoo hallelujah you mind if i give you a few more scriptures the bible says in revelations 21 and 1 and i saw a new heaven so why shouldn't i believe in heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john i the bride saw the holy he knew jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride a dorm for a husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all their tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death there shall be no more sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away why shouldn't we believe in a place called heaven when i heard a prophet say that these are things that are to be that this rapture will put you there why shouldn't we believe it i better have myself a conniption fit this morning knowing what i was studying on and going over these things looking at what brother branham said on then why shouldn't we he said brother george and beyond occurring in time said brother george you won't be old and crippled over there and he said brother and sister spencer and some of these old some of these older folks setting forth we'll be young there forever this robe of flesh i'll drop and rise and seize the everlasting prize and shout while passing through the air farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer it's all over no more long nights of praying just enter into that young joyful age to be there not just for one year or 50 years or a million years but when we've been there 100 billion years we won't even be started at all so why shouldn't we be happy this morning why shouldn't we rejoice why shouldn't we take advantage of every great thing that god has given us why shouldn't we happy why shouldn't we rejoice about these things can you give me one good reason why why we shouldn't believe it why we shouldn't believe in heaven can anybody stand up and tell me why we shouldn't believe in heaven when jesus has said it in his own word that where i am there you will be also he said let not your hearts be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions that if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you do you believe that jesus is still jesus why shouldn't we take him at his word and if i go prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am you may be also you see we're living in a pest house a pest house is where they put all diseased people well that's just the way sin done to us it put us in an earthly pest house he wouldn't let anyone else come in the past house because there's all kinds of germs flying around in there and people would take these germs and be sick themselves and sin brought us into the devil's pest house that's what syndal did to us it brought us in to the devil's pest house oh but there is another one called my father's house i'll go and prepare a place for you and take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house there you are and take you out of this old earthly past house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the bible said jesus said be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect it's a perfecting kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that watches washes us from our sins that's right the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word the blood the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride in she stands perfect she's virgin she's unadulterated she never sinned in the first place she was just trapped into it we don't have to deal with this old past house much more we're going to the father's house why shouldn't we believe in it why shouldn't we believe in all of these promises when he said no weapon that has formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that rise against thee thou shalt condemn that this is the heritage of the servants of the lord why shouldn't we believe him at his word why shouldn't we take that this is what he said i believe it i'll stand with it why shouldn't we believe it does anybody here got a good reason why we shouldn't believe it well my friend they've kind of just gave up hope and they kind of walked away why shouldn't i believe this just because your carnal friend wouldn't walk his way when jesus turned to them when they when they were standing there and they begin to walk away and he turned to peter and he said will you also go peter said where will we go i'm not going nowhere there's nowhere that has this word of eternal life but by you why should i walk away just because people of great stature walked away i'm not walking away from life i'm not walking away from joy i'm not walking away from my shout i'm not walking away from my praise i'm not walking away from this message this message will change my body why shouldn't we believe it if he said it then why in the world should we put up with the devil then why in the world should we listen to his lies if jesus said that you can live a peaceable life let's live a peaceable life why should you put up with his traps and his tactics why give me one good reason why you should listen to the devil sister joy you've got any good reasons sister faith sister katie anybody here got a good reason why you should listen to the devil he's the father of lies why should i listen to him [Laughter] why should i listen to him when he says i'm gonna kill your daddy why in the world should i listen to him gabriel hallelujah you can't kill a son of god we're a part of god what are you packing i'm not talking about you you brothers got that thing slipped in beside your hip bear but will you

there out and walks there i'd say that the devil that was inside of those two idiots was running for cover they probably couldn't get in their car fast enough and leave why should we listen to the devil and allow him to disrupt our services are you with me now i'm just going to break it down in a minute in a spiritual form why should we allow the things that have afflicted you and been in your mind all week afflict this service when you come in this house you ought to come prepared to meet jesus if he's still jesus and we can still meet him why should we let laodicea hang on to us and hurt our service why shouldn't we praise him when he said let everything that half breath praise ye the lord praise him on a piano praise him on a guitar praise him on the loud sound and said no raise him on the low sounding symbol let everything that hath breath praise ye the lord why shouldn't i praise him when he's done everything in the world for me when he gave me life when he gave me hope when he gave me peace when he gave me my best when he gave me the best wife i ever could ask for why shouldn't i praise him well if you don't want to praise him don't hinder me i said if you don't want to
