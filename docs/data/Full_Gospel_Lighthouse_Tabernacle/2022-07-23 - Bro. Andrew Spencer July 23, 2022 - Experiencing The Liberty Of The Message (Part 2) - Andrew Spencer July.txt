the glory and yours is the name of the holy what a powerful name it is what a powerful name it is the name of jesus oh thank you lord jesus what a powerful name it is [Music] amen amen what a beautiful song what a beautiful song that is summoned to our lord all heaven and earth recognizes that name and to think today that we are identified in that name what a privilege it is for us as his children to be standing right here as a living oracle of jesus christ a token a token to this generation that jesus is alive and what a powerful name it truly is and i heard brother branham say before we come to church this evening i heard brother branham saying the seed is not air with the shuck he said lord condition my soul and my spirit that i'll feed only on the word of god and i say god condition our hearts to not condition our souls that we feed only on the word of god amen that's our that's why we're here this evening is to feed on the word of god and we'd like to thank all of you your parents and all the little children that came today for the kids day and i know that the kids really enjoyed it and some of the parents were asking when can we have our day like that so i'm afraid that some of us would need a prayer line directly after a after an event like that so we're certainly uh was certainly privileged to have the group that we have here and uh and god's just god's just blessing us and uh we certainly love him amen amen let's just go to the lord in prayer this evening isn't he lovely [Music] hallelujah let's just go to him in prayer father what a mighty god that you are how close you have been to us today lord jesus lord that we have gathered around your word lord one more time lord jesus and we've dedicated ourselves unto you father lord for your glory and for the upbuilding of the kingdom of god and lord we're we're here lord and lord we're not just the people that have just come to a building but we are people that are solid in the faith lord knowing that you're right here father though we may not see you and maybe we don't necessarily feel you but yet we sent you because your word said that you would be here our heart recognizes that you're here lord lord i i can feel the atmosphere in this place it's not the atmosphere that you find in a restaurant it's not the atmosphere that you'll find down at a maybe a pool hall or something like that of that nature or a movie theater lord but this is the atmosphere that has been created by a people that have longed to worship the true and living god and then we feel your presence lord come behind this atmosphere you've come to vindicate lord jesus that this is your message lord we're so thankful that we're standing in this hour lord and what a privileged people that we are if our prophet would stand and say if he could have chose any day to live in he would chose this day father i'm so thankful that you chose us and you encountered us worthy that we would stand here lord knowing that we wouldn't falter or fail but we would stand for you and lord i pray tonight that you would take the pages of the bible lord i have been so stirred up in my spirit and my soul father studying out these things this week lord i pray that you would control my emotions father control my spirit father that i would bring out the word in the way that you have brought it unto me father i i recognize that when you stand before people and that at the pool of the people will gear it in a different direction maybe even what we think father but i pray that you would be high and lifted up here lord and that the word would go to its destination tonight lord and lord i'm just careful to serve you i know that i've spent the day with you father father here we are in the cool of the evening lord we've just come lord and i believe that you've come to walk with your children tonight i i really believe that king theophany is here and walking in the garden again lord here we are father we just want to take you by the hand and may you lead us down through the pages of the bible lord anoint our faith lord meeting the people's needs tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen if you have your bibles this evening i'd like to look into two portions of scripture this evening over in the book of luke chapter 4 and verse 17 and then then back in the old testament in the book of joel joel chapter 2 and verse 23. luke chapter 4 luke chapter 4 and verse 17. i'd like to speak to you again this this weekend or carry on our thought from last weekend on and experiencing the liberty of the message i trust you all enjoyed the services last weekend and i know most of you are here so you're you'll just jump right in the thought with us this evening and now try not to go back through everything that we we spoke last weekend but i want to speak to you something that we got involved in last weekend on there and uh just something that the lord has stirred up in my heart sometimes sometimes as preachers you don't realize where the lord has taken you and then all of a sudden he opens up a new vein for you and so we just like to look down through this thought and this evening luke chapter 4 and verse 17 and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written that the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight to the bond to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears joel chapter 2 and verse 23 amen don't you just love the reading of the word amen joel chapter 2 and verse 23 be glad then you children of a zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent amongst you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of your lord your god that it dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord as you said we'd like to continue on that thought on the experience and the liberty of the message and i certainly thank the lord for this message but i know that i know that for some of us most of us sitting here this evening it was it is a pretty easy task for us to be able to come to the house of the lord it was something that we longed to do it's something that we enjoy doing is going to the house of the lord because that's where we as saints we get our feeding we feed on daily we feed on this message but to but to be able to come to the house of worship and a house of prayer and to be able to enter into his courts with thanksgiving in our hearts it's it's rather easy for a real son and daughter of god because you have experienced the power of the true message but we realize that there are those that have to fight to get into the building they they have to fight they're young people they're they they fight their young people young people or their children and they're and they're fighting this way or that way maybe maybe they're just trying to get into the building young people fighting because they don't want to don't want to go again or they or they're just battling because because they're going through the times and the spots of life that that get a little bit sticky and but yet there there is something that is on the inside of them that they they still feel a draw to go there and it's amazing thing when somebody begins to fight to get into the building and just to know that if they can get close to him that he'll meet their every need but for us that have experienced the true and living god we have come unto we have come into his camp we have we've heard the shout of the king amongst us and and we recognize that we've come into into an experience that this this message or that the easter message is not some fairy tale it's not some santa claus story but this is something that we personally experienced and i believe that is something that every single one of us have to have is an experience with elohim and experience with jehovah and experience with the one that is the author of the word and you begin to think about abraham that how that he endured seeing him who was invisible because he had had a conference with god and he met him face to face and he had an experience and he was able to go through the trials of life and if you're able if you you were in a spot that you have met him face to face that you can go through some things that maybe you didn't think that you were able to go through because you had an experience with him i i really can't imagine somebody battling through lay out a seal or battling through the of the chaos of laodicea without an experience with the true and living god i really can't imagine somebody going through the battle of cancer without knowing god i can't imagine going through the chaos of life without knowing god and i think about abraham that that once he had met him he he called those things that were not as though they were because he had an experience with him and you'll see somebody you'll see somebody as a child of god you watch them as they as they walk into the promises of god you'll see them they call those things as as that were not as though they were you see they're walking by faith because they're not walking by themselves but they're walking with the king of kings and abraham was it was a patriarch of faith he was he was he was a for forerunner and he was a man that we looked to a man of faith a man that had confidence in god and he had to walk away and separate himself from everything that he knew he had to separate from his mother and his father he had to separate from everything he had to go down into spots but god was going to use him to express through him and manifest through him that this was god that was doing these myths when he walked down there if lot it was god with him when he walked down there into the king of guru with the king of gorier and all of those events that took place it was the event of melchizedek that showed us that this is the hour that we are to be living in you think about who is the one that is amongst us it's none other than this melchizedek that the same one that abraham met is the same one that you're meeting right here in this congregation and not that same melchizedek has promised that he would be here it's none other than our lord jesus christ and to think that tonight that you have the ability as a preacher of the message of the hour i think it's such a grand thing to be able to stand here knowing whether shortly that i can preach this message in its fullness in its sureness in his purity and stand here that maybe your young people or maybe somebody sitting here hasn't had an experience with this god but i can stand here by the word of the lord and i can preach this message and i know that if i preach this message in its power that he will come and demonstrate that this is the message of the hour it's not a message of another day but this is the message of this day and i can stand here i can roll my shoulders back when the enemy wants to shut the service down or the enemy wants to come in like a flood i can roll my shoulders back knowing shortly that god will back up the message because god is here for you to experience him in power and in truth and i think it's such an amazing thing when all hell is against the church of the living god that we can stand here and preach the most powerful message that's been ever given upon the face of the earth we can stand here it's not something that's just in book form but it's an experience it's life it's life but you remember what what age that we're living in that this is the seventh church age and we realize that it was this age that christ was standing on the outside and he was knocking trying to get in but you remember that famous picture that man that that man that draw jesus knocking at the door and it went through the hall of critics and they said we've only found one spot where we could criticize you upon your artwork it's that there is no latch upon the door and the man said the latch is on the inside you've got to let him in you see that's the way it is with the church and with every individual you've got to be the one to let christ in it isn't the pastor's job it isn't your mama's job you've got to be the one that will stand there and open the door and jesus said any man that will open the door i will come into him and i will sup with him you see what you're feeding on your soul has been conditioned to feed only upon the word of god now you remember what happened over there with those two disciples when they were walking down the road of emmaus they were walking down there and they were talking about the scriptures and they come in acquaintance they come into acquaintance with somebody and they say well you've not heard these things where have you been at man they they've crucified the one that we thought was the messiah and he began to take them through the scriptures from moses all the way to where they were and he preached christ to them but they never recognized that it was him brother branham would say he said in in in their eyes were opened he said and the preached word never did it he preached to them all those seven miles he preached to them all the way over there and they never got it here was the ones that were standing real close to him they had experienced what he'd done in his life in his three and a half years they'd experienced him hand-to-hand they watched how he handled the word they watched how he preached up there in matthew chapter five they watched him but when when they were walking down the road the preached word never opened up their eyes but when he got on the inside when he got on the inside it was that something that he had done before you see they watched the accents [Music] hallelujah they watched the actions of the one that was sitting there and if it had not been for them constraining him to get on the inside they would have went jesus would have went on the bible's head but because somebody had in a pool had a poor to get him on the inside i happen to believe that it is this pool that is pulled elohim right into the tent door with us it's pulled elohim on the inside of the tent door you forgive me just for a minute but i can imagine as jesus begins to break the bread and their eyes begin to get opened up to the thought that this is him just give me just a little bit of liberty right here i can imagine as jesus is standing there and he's he's doing the same acts that he did with them those three and a half years and i could see those disciples looking into his eyes i could see him maybe put their hands their hands on his face and said jesus is that you because of his actions because of his actions how he handled himself how did he broke how that he broke the bread of life it showed to them this was him you see there are many that have said under the preaching of the word and they have missed that this is jesus but because you stood still long enough to let the word wash you to let you stand there and watch his actions that this is the same one that is amongst us you can roll your hands over on his eyes you can roll your hand over on his skin and you can fold back the pages of the bible and you can look over in revelations 10. you can look over luke 17 and 30. you can look over and look at malachi 4 and you can say jesus is that you you notice it took them all day long to get over there but when they recognized this was the same one this was the one that brought the message this was the one they ran back to their city it didn't take them but a half an hour to get back there it's amazing the liberty of the holy ghost when the revelation sets in you think well oh i'll never do anything like that let me say this when the anointing of the lord gets upon you you'll never know how you act you will act accordingly how elohim wants you to act if if ahab if ahab took his fastest horses and he was riding back down there to a city and and elijah was up there looking he was looking up there said is there any rain yet is there any rain is there any clouds up there in the sky yet and he didn't even have enough strength after the mount carmel experience he didn't even have enough strength to climb the mountain a pair but his turrets and his servant get hazel go up there and look and see if there's any clouds up there and if just do you see any signs that there's going to be some rain in this place do you see any signs that the message is still true do you still see any signs that jesus is still god do you still see any times that he's here and amongst us oh i ain't seen nothing yet go back up there and look again you say where are we living at i'm telling you to climb the hill one more time and look at this jesus elijah all i see is a cloud of the size of a hand of a man and elijah didn't have enough he didn't have enough energy to climb that mountain but when the anointing struck his heart he got some energy on the inside of him that he ran 17 miles all the way back into the city he said ahab get your rain barrels ready there is such power in the anointing when the word begins to get revealed brother branham would preach a very powerful message right out here in harrisonburg on the door to the heart he would tell us you can go out there and you can still find the building where brother brown and preach that it's out there on the other side of downtown harrisonburg in the armory building brandon preaches power very five five foot very powerful messages there but one of them being the door to the heart and he comes there and he and he goes through the rooms of the heart that you've got to be the one to let him in you've got to be the one to open up the door and he said in there he said everybody wants to be saved he said but they don't want to make him lord of all he said he said they they come in there he said there's a door on the right hand side he said that's the door of the private life they said they want you to be a savior but they don't want you to be the lord over their private life god don't go down there messing with my private life god i don't want you i don't want you menacing down there just just leave all that alone you're welcome here you're welcome here at the door but don't go into this room and he said he said yo you can go over in the next room and he said you can find that room you can find that room of prejudice that room of prejudice and he said you'll find those people that call themselves christians he said they won't speak to this woman because she did something to them years ago they won't share the gospel they won't share the gospel or they won't share what god did for them in their life he said he said it's that lord prejudice that it won't let christ be lord of all he said but the problem is he said instead of a holy life he said it's a perverted life and he said what the church needs is not a facelift he said what the church in the heat is a death and a birth he said but you can go on through the rooms of the heart and he said you go in there and you can find in the door of selfishness he said they want him as a savior because they don't want to go to hell but they don't want him to be the lord of their life he said but it's at the door of selfishness is that they they serving christ for their own motive they're serving god if you'll heal me i serve you if you say if you save uncle johnny if you save him from this battle if you save him from that battle i'll serve you because they're serving god out of a very selfish motive but brother branham comes all the way through and he works his way throughout the doors of the heart he said but there's one more door that i'd like to deal with he said it's the door of your faith he said it's the door of faith he said but now many times he said still people want to keep him on the outside he said but they don't want him to be the lord of their faith he said but if jesus when jesus becomes lord of your faith then all of his words become real to you he said that's the reason people can't believe for divine healing yet they're members of the christian church they got they got jesus at the door but if he could stand in that little door of faith he said he would be your faith he said this right here to you and harrisonburg seeds were being dropped right here he would be the lord of your faith and i could not imagine that the man who wrote the bible turn around and deny the bible don't you recognize what he's doing if god will be the lord of your life he'll be the lord of your selfishness he'll be the lord of your perverted life he'll be the lord he'll be the lord of your prejudice he will be the lord of your faith oh i i think that's quite powerful this evening if you're gonna let christ be the lord of your faith it's not you trying to work up a faith to believe in the promises of god but god already believes his word to be true god already knows that there's going to be a rapture god already knows there's going to be a bride that's without spotting without wrinkle god already knows i'm going to have myself just a good old dance in time i'm handing the microphone over to somebody else and let them preach tonight i've done spent all day with elohim i've never had an experience with him but when christ becomes the lord of your faith it's no longer doubting at the word it's no longer believing well could he do it here or maybe that was the days gone by but when he's the lord of your faith all things are possible to them i believe now remember what what webster said about liberty that liberty is the freedom from restraint it is in a general sense inapplicable to the body it is a state of exemption from the control of others so when you let him be the lord of your faith you're pulling all of your strings off of it when you're letting him be lord lord means ownership that means he owns your faith that means he owns your life and when you allow somebody when you allow somebody liberty to walk into your house if you really tell you tell me that i'm welcome when i come into your house i can run in there not only do this at a few people's house because i really feel welcome but if you really welcome me in there i can have every right to go in and jump on the couch the way i want to or i can go in there and get in the refrigerator or i'll go in there and give me a cup of coffee because you're really giving me liberty and when you let christ be the lord of your life you're letting him into every portion of your life you're giving him full liberty oh i i pray right now that if anybody has not given him full liberty to their life that they would bow their heart before the preaching of the lord goes forward and said god have full liberty right here take complete control of my life take complete control of my situations take complete control of everything hallelujah it's the greatest decision anybody would make but when brother ben and i'm going to go forward just now my brother brandon when he's coming down to the the closing hours of his ministry in 1964 he preaches a very powerful message on the unveiling god the unveiling of god the mighty god before us and brother madam comes down to the closing of that message in 1964 and he begins to speak to us about an auction that's taking place about the man that that they're auctioning off this violin that it's that its strings are all loose and it looks very invaluable to all of all of the onlookers but the man they they start bidding it off and he said who will give 50 cents who would give a dollar and nobody wanted to visit nobody wanted to give anything for it but there was a man that had that had a knowledge of what that thing was worth he had a knowledge of how valuable this violin was and so he stopped the auction and he took that violin and he started tightening up and tuning up that violin and he started taking the bow and he started wringing out a song across it and he started breathing out across it he said when he took that when he took that bow and he breathed across that violin everybody saw the value they saw the value and its true quality of what that violin was really worth brother branham will say oh why don't you let him rise him up the bow and let him breathe across your heart let him be the master of the world let the master of the word come across the word of your heart so that you could see the true value of what this word is you'll see that it was the same one that was poured out up there on the day of pentecost when he conoces himself when he emptied himself out when he poured himself out you'll see it's the same one why don't you let the master of the word come ring across your heart to not so you'll see that this is this is him that is amongst us that it won't just be another's experience but this will be your experience if you would sit back and you'd watch a man i ain't got too many empty pages here but if you'd take you'd watch a man come and take an empty sheet of paper and you'd watch him as he starts he starts working across that paper and he starts making some dots on that paper then he starts drawing some lines on that paper and then he you're not understanding what he's doing you're unaware of what's happening but somebody's at work somebody's at work you see i can tell you i could grab this book everybody here knows what's on the inside of this book but if i would take a book from over here or whatnot i'd grab it and i'd bring it before you wouldn't necessarily know or understand what's on it unless i told you what was on it but if you're watching this man with this blank piece of paper start making some dots across the lines across the pages and he brings down some lines off of those dots and then there he put some rest on the inside on the inside of those dots and before before all of those dots he starts putting a cleft at the beginning of it what is he doing he's creating sheet music and he's creating a music that will wring out a song that the master has designed and he's designing the sheet music in such a way so that it'll ring out exactly what he destined for it to be now there's a lot of people that have looked at the sheet music and they can see that it's sheet music but they don't understand the heart of the master but i happen to believe that ever since the revealing of the seven seals that there is a people on the face of the earth that understand after those seven seals you watch what was happening it was that uniting time it was the invisible union with the bride it was the red lights flashing it was the token that this message was all capped off in you see that is the capping of the message it's when christ comes and dwells on the inside of you you see you see each and every one of your lives you wasn't in a spot that you could wring out the sheet music but god had to get you to a spot so that you could be in a space in a space of time that you could so echo out the sheet music let's say we we could look at jacob jacob he look at his life he was nothing but a scheister he was nothing but uh he was no he was good for nothing he'd lie to his dad he he did all kinds of wrong deeds but look at the seed you always watch the power of the seed you watch those two twins how that they were constantly fighting against each other how that they were constantly battling against each other but you watch that seed you watch what that seed did that one one sold out sold out as birthright but one loved that birthright you watch that seed you can watch there's some people that are good church members but they never go on all the way up onto pentecost you watch the power of that seed and jacob was known as a shy star he he fooled his own father-in-law and he tricked him into these things and he left camp early but on the other side of a river one time he got into a wrestling match with an angel and it showed what was on the inside of jacob let me preach to you just a moment it showed what was on the inside of this message on the inside of the message believing people because they spent time on the other side of a river [Applause] where there was a lot of people there was a lot of people a lot of esos that would sell out sell out there sell out their birthright for a mess of pottage but for jacob for jacob he had to go to a spot where he would wrestle it out with an angel and that's what this bride has done william branham william branham left the scene in 1965 but that mighty angel is still right here i declare he's on the pulpit tonight and there are people that are wrestling up by the power of the word there's somebody going to stay with this angel there's somebody going to stay there until they get changed [Applause] i'm just talking about your natural now i'm talking about your spiritual somebody's going to get a change somebody's going to move up higher this angel is not going to leave you jacob in the same spot that you walked in here you may have walked across this jordan you may have walked across this river one way but you and you walk back you're going to be walking back as a prince with power on one side of the river you were known you were known as a good for nothing liar a cheater but on the other side you were known as a limping prince walking with the king of kings [Applause] oh hallelujah watch watch what brother branham would tell us he would tell us to watch he'd tell us to watch the movements watch the movements of pentecost watch the movements of the church of the day he said pentecost wants more pentecost and he said that's exactly what they're going to get they're going to get more pentecostals he said but the word of god was going to produce sons and daughters of god you see we're not here just trying to build individuals individuals into a church building but we're here to build them to be powerhouses that's what the word will produce you see the modern church don't want nothing to do with this message the modern church don't want to have anything to do with the power and the true experience of pentecost but brother branham would say over and over again there has got to come another pentecost you see what this age is it's in ephesians it's a coming out of and going into and there are people that are settled in the word of god they've got their mind right they've got their heart right they've got their soul right and watch what that word is producing it's not producing it's not producing denominational chickens it's producing sons and daughters of the most high god brother branham would tell us he said the kind of crop you'll get is the kind of seed that you put in your field is that right so we recognize that god is going to have a word pride that'll be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh they will be they will be connected to the absolute they will be in the word image they will be a word power pride she'll be born of his bone life of his life power of his power it is the power of god that is raising the bride into a spot that she was destined to be in he would go on to say in the spoken word is the original seed he said every seed must come after its kind he said god made man in his own image after his kind to be his word on earth he said but when the word was in christ a man a human man expressing itself through him that was god the word in christ expressing itself and god in the beginning made man in his own image and that's the kind of man that god makes today you go down through the spoken word of the original seed very powerful very powerful messages you're going to take all day with it's going to take you over six and a half hours you might as well take the day off you're going to listen to that all the way through it's in two parts but a very powerful very pertinent message to the bride of jesus christ but brother branham would say that that god made man in his own image he said after his kind he said he asked the question what is his kind he said the word so if there's going to be a word body it's going to be a word kind of people is that right so it's the only kind that the word can bring forth and you watch what happens when the rain begins to fall on the seed that he sowed it'll produce exactly what was deposited is that right so if it's a word speed it's got to bring forth the word bride if it was a word groom it's got to be a word bride come on somebody what did this message do he didn't take us down or he didn't take us further the knowledge or intellects this message took us to the word this message didn't create a denomination this message didn't create another school of fault i'm trying to drive you to something we're not building just buildings we're building powerhouses we're building young people that can live this message we're building young people that can truly be what christ destined them to be [Applause] watch i'm going i'm going i'm going some places here but notice notice what this messenger is to do in this age he said in the spoken word he said the gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire bible plum from the serpent to the messenger in the former rain then he will be rejected by the denominational people as his forefather john and elijah was spoken by our lord so notice what the anointed messenger is to do he's to preach the message you notice what william branham did he didn't take sides with this one or take sides with that one he stayed right in the middle of the road he had critics he had people that loved him but he was a man that was true to the word of god and because he made his decision to stand and preach the message william branham could have been a very rich man man was offering him millions upon millions of dollars to just come down off of the doctrines they thought he was another man like any man of the day that would accept money over the word if you'll just stop preaching on baptism in the name of jesus christ if you'll stop preaching about women preachers if you'll stop this that or the other but this messenger would not compromise he preached the message he gave his life to this message [Applause] i say this if he wouldn't have ran the way he ran i and you wouldn't be here today but because there was a prophet messenger that was so determined that he would preach this word preach this seed there's a word bride standing in this day she's not shaken about she's standing on her feet and the headship of christ has come down in the body that's who you're fellowshipping with it's elohim that's the mighty one that's amongst us [Applause] notice let me read it to you again when the anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire bible and to of course he will plant the seed of the entire bible plum from the serpent to the messenger in the former rain then he will be rejected so you watch this prophet would be rejected but notice that prophet's got a job to do he's to preach the seed he's to plant the word and notice what he did and we're living in an hour when christ is on the outside when the church rejected christ but i want to let the wicked one know that's going about trying to talk sow tares in i want you to know the wicked one that the seed has been planted and you have showed up too late you showed up too late we've already received the word bride we've already received the word seed you showed up too late you will not stop this word bride you will not hinder her you will not affect her she's been birthed by the word too late hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah god sowed the seed and there was a teacher that came and preached the word notice the hour that we're living in right now this is not the hour of the teaching rain but this is the hour of the harvest rain because the teaching rain is the first rain it's when you plant the seed and that teaching rain comes at the start of the crop but the harvest ring comes at the maturing it comes to the maturing of another crop and he said in the message he said it's a harvest rain he said or you could say it's a rapturing faith don't you realize what you have received in this hour this message is your ticket you can reject this prophet you can reject this message but you cannot stop the plan of god you can say you don't believe it you can paint your toenails you can paint your eyes you can paint your face but you won't stop the bride of jesus christ you can say well i'm going to roll my shoulders back and i'm not going to i'm not going to let it affect me you can sit there and let the word roll off of you like water on a duck's back or you can get in the water where it's at [Applause] i'm gonna preach a message if i'm gonna preach anything i'm gonna preach a message i ain't gonna preach some watered-down man-made idea i'm gonna preach the message because it's the only inspiration and it's the only power in the world today it's the message of the hour and if you don't like the message it shows where you are but i'm to preach this message because i'm preaching a message people message believers people that are destined to leave here it is that harvest reigns that is making a people ready the prophet was the teacher of the word he teach that he sowed the seed but this is the harvest rain hallelujah we're not waiting for another day we're right here this is the holy ghost this is his doing and it is marvelous in our eyes let me tell you church the living god you're not in repair you're in restoration you're justified as if you've never done it in the first place i know where i'm standing at satan you showed up too late [Applause] have brother on do that i'm gonna preach the message because it's a message that'll get this bride out of here it's this harvest range that will put us in the rapture we're going to stand for something that's stand for the message if we're going to believe something let's believe the message let's not be wishy-washy with it let's roll our shoulders back roll up our sleeves as we have to let's fight for the message let's believe the message he said brother andrew you showing up and you're you're trying to tell us something that people are telling us that the days of miracles have passed you showed up too late for me satan i can tell still tell you i've had an experience with elohim i've had an experience with this message he's still a healer he's still a waymaker he's still given a holy ghost another adam would say in jehovah jireh he said it's the holy ghost that comes on that planet seed it is that latter rain so if is that if this is that that was prophesied by the prophet joel now i know some of you shook up because i took that tie off i can put it back on and make you feel better that thing's about to kill me i'd rather strangle a devil with it than it strangled me [Applause] they said well brother andrew you're supposed to wear you're supposed to wear a tie in the pulpit really i'll put it right here that make you feel better but i got i got a rock back here i got a rock back here that a brother gave me that came out of that same river that david went down there and that's in that brook and i got myself a sling right here i never used to tie a sling of rock before but it's the first time it's a good time for first times right [Applause] i'm catching my breath you keep amen and i'll keep preaching like that sign like that sign on them bumper stickers you keep honking i'm reloading so you keep saying hey man i'm just reloading up here [Applause] so if this is that how many how many believe this is that [Music] i believe this is that that was prophesied by the prophet joel that in the last days i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh so if this is that and i happen to believe that this is so what kind of people should we be if we've been so embodied with the same token life of jesus christ the blood cell that was broken calvary if it's that same life that was poured out on the day of pentecost if it was that same one if it was the same one that was poured out how much more what kind of people should we be we wouldn't use our own mind we wouldn't use our own opinion we wouldn't use our own thought we'd use his word but we know that christ is the seed he said he said he said if if i do not the works if i do his works he said if i do not as works believe me not but there was a seed he said can any of you condemn me of unbelief there was a seed he said it looked close mary mary looked close when the seed was in the womb it looked close to being right he said but yet it was a shuck he was carrying that seed it was carrying that seed he said in methodist look close luther looks close wesley looked close and the pentecostal age look close he said but here here at the opening of the seven seals of revelations 10 the full word is to be born in a manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of god in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth don't you see where we're at we're not carrying the message you are the message brother was standing there he's out there hunting and you remember those three three rainbows that are standing there and he said he come down there and he vindicated the message unto me he said that jehovah of the old testament was jesus christ of the new testament he said it was vindicating my message of him notice what the message was it wasn't a message of william branham it was not a message of schools or thoughts it was a message of him and what is the seed in the last day notice after the releasing of those seals the word is in its full strength again you can go over and read in revelations 8 9 and you can see you can see what was being poured out there you can see the enemy that was at work and you can watch through the seals you can watch as that enemy that's coming up and you watch throughout the ages men thought that that was christ on that white horse is that right in revelations 5 they thought revelation 6 they thought that was christ the mighty conqueror on there but when william branham come and preach the message he stood there and said he said i've looked at this i've read all the theologians i've read everything i can to read find all the history on it he said but about 12 o'clock in the middle of the day he said there came one and straightened me out on it he said it's not christ it's the antichrist but notice what he showed to you he showed to you an enemy that had a bow in his hand but he didn't have no arrows so you are disputing with a defeated enemy now i'm giving you some real i'm giving you some real weapons right here and our weapons are not carnal but they're mighty is that right i'm giving you some real weapons so anybody that is facing a battle right now how many how many is in a real battle maybe you know maybe don't maybe maybe just come out of one and getting ready going to another but i'm giving you some real weapons right here you are disputing with a defeated enemy if you can recognize that the word is in its full strength can you recognize that you're a part of that word that that seed is in its full strength it isn't half of its power it isn't just being able it isn't just being able to confess that jesus christ is lord it isn't just being able to stand there and say that i'm justified in his sight or you being able to quote john 3 16 but you're standing there as christ was standing there in the very beginning and you are disputing with a defeated enemy and if christ would stand there and he would defeat satan time after time after time after time and satan thought that he'd won up there on calvary and he thought he finally got him but there came a knock on hell's door one day and he came out he said you thought he said i thought i had you when i had job he said i thought i had you when i had abraham he said i thought i had you when i had the prophets but you're finally here and jesus kicked him down i don't know what it looked like it may have looked like jackie chan it may have looked like he had made him made it look like bruce lee kicking him down but when he reached over there he dropped those keys off of his side and said give me those keys and you are disputing with the enemy that don't even have the keys to his own house [Applause] but there's a people on the earth today that the word is in its full strength blue devil boo devil boo devil do you know who you're looking at this is a bride in full strength ready for the rapture that message when a message came to william branham what was it it was the king's sword he said this is the third pole this is the opening of the word and you watch what those third what the three pole what the third pole does you watch what it does what it is and what it does is two different things but you watch what the opening of the word does what's what it is it is the opening of the word it is christ but what it does it makes mountains move it makes squirrels come into existence it makes a little girl by the name of hattieright stand there stand there and pray ahead sit there and listen about those squirrels being spoken to existence and he's telling everything about it and there's a little girl there's a little girl that has that's only making about 40 40 a year but she's sitting there and she asks this question yes she did have a question but she was not questioning the messenger she had a question said brother branham how can these things be she was not asking what in the world what are you telling us she was asking how can i do this and she said william branham that's nothing but the truth [Music] and when she did a portion of heaven was released to had it right said hattie write ask anything you want to and it'll be given unto you brother bam said she could have asked for a million dollars and it would have given to her but the angel knew what she was going to ask he knows what you're going to ask tonight you're not asking for fame you're not asking for riches you're asking for glory howdy i'll give them to you howdy i'll give them to you do you see what this message is do you see what you've come in contact with this ain't some man this is heaven this is heaven and because of a prophet's message and because of his decision a huge portion awaited him i happen to believe that because your decision to stay with this message i'm gonna drop something right here that's very very very close to my heart but because because he knew you wouldn't walk away he allowed you to get close peter will you as well go lord lord where will i go look what these are going look where they're going lord i'm going to follow you it may cost me some stuff in life but i'm going to follow you i'm going to go through some trials and it might look like i'm going to deny you one time but god just give me another chance up there in pentecost i'll find you again lord i'm not going to turn my back on you i heard brother byron say today on this day this scripture is fulfilled he said if you turn your back on this message and walk away from it you've rejected the king of life don't you see who you're turning down and what is the acceptable year of the lord it is the jubilee if there ever was a time that the message could be preached in its liberty it's this age it's this hour it's this moment and there are those that have turned their back on it but because you wouldn't turn away because you wouldn't turn away he allowed you elohim allowed you abraham to get close lot didn't choose this way lot didn't choose to walk this way but because you chose i've allowed you to stick close abraham you're going to bring forth the son you forgive me i'm just abraham you're gonna bring for the son you're gonna bring for the son i promise you're gonna bring forth the son you can bring forth the son notice what he would say in galatians paul would say in galatians 4 you could go through in 4 22 all the way through 30 and you could find where abraham was promised a seed he said but cast out the seed the air of the bonds woman she is not a part of the free woman notice the part of ishmael has nothing to do with christ you see the jews thought the jews thought that they were talking about isaac that the promised one was talking about isaac but here here they christ was talking about himself you're going to bring forth the son you will be a father of nations abraham i'm going to bless you but abraham thought it was his own it was his own ability and he took it upon himself and him and sarah brought about in their own human ingenuity they brought forth a son by ishmael through through the bonds woman hagar notice what this was it was not that of the free it was that of the bonds so you see it was a type of two covenants of one of mount sinai and one of christ oh i'm gonna preach to you right here just for a few more moments ishmael cast cast out the one woman in her hair in her air but the free woman but we are not a part of the barnes woman but we are of the free and you watch what paul goes down in galatians chapter five and verse one and he said stand there fast they're fast in the liberty where christ has made you free i allowed you to get close abraham because i knew you wouldn't walk away abraham there's something in you that i got to bring out abraham there's something about you i've got to express myself through you abraham i'm going to point you out to every generation i'm going to point you out and you notice that melchizedek comes to abraham's seed notice where he comes elohim comes to the elected seed the church turned him down judas turned him down but you decided to stay close because you love him you love him and you notice what paul would stand there in galatians chapter 4 and he would preach to you the adoption you go back in the early series of galatians chapter four and you see that the heir as long as he is child he differed nothing from the servant but christ came in the fullness of time and he poured out his spirit upon us whereby we cry abba father will you recognize what that son would do you see as long as he was a servant as long as he as long as he was a child he differed nothing from a servant but when he became a man he started talking like a man but you see he was under tutors and governors that son was under there and the tudor would watch that sun as he would grow and as he would go and the tudor would come to the father and he would tell him so your son your son is a chip off the old block he's exactly like you i've watched him in business i've watched how he handles himself i've watched how he how he does things got a heart like the father and here the father makes a public testimony he goes out before the entire community and he places his robe upon him he places his robe upon him he said this is my son he's heir to the kingdom his heir to the kingdom and that son could go out and he could go out into a field and he could work he could father could send him out and say i'm setting you over lord over this field you've got full authority over this field i want you to notice the field that you're in it's a field of the message you've not been planted in some denominational field you've been planted in this field and this message has given you full authority to walk in the liberty as sons of god and he can walk out there in the full authority of the father and he could walk out there and he could do everything exactly like the father would because he had the authority as a fully adopted son let me tell you when you have the spirit of the living god you are fully adopted as a son and daughter of god it's not someday coming in the future you are right now sons and daughters of the most high god what i want you to recognize is that this is the age of full liberty this is the hour when all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of man that this is the age of the liberty of the saints of god you realize that all of your world is waiting on your manifestation waiting on your power to be released out of you do you see what this reign has done for you it's brought you to maturity as a bride of jesus christ that you can experience this is him this is him the word is in full full strength this ain't satan's time this ain't pelosi's time this ain't biden's time this ain't putin's time this is bride time this is eagle time this is rapture time man we're just staying with us this evening hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there's just nothing like his presence i can't imagine i can't imagine waiting 38 years he had a pool dealing with an infirmity the prophet would say that he he wouldn't have died of it but he was dealing with this infirmity but can't imagine dealing with an infirmity for 38 years waiting for a season waiting for a season when the angel would come and trouble the waters there'd be others that would get in the water and they'd come out completely home but when the one come walking by your way [Music] so why are you sitting here what are you still doing here at this spot he says take up your bed and walk what'd he tell him to take up his bed for he wasn't going back here no more i choose to

all these questions you've had all these questions is this message really true is this message does it still contain the capacity to heal does it still is it is are we serving a god of idols are we serving a god of images [Music] it's the god that i've longed for is he is he in our midst is he is he is he still have the ability to save does he still have the ability to to go to prison doors does he still have the capacity to do it and he comes by where you're laying at your denominational bed so what are you laying here for take up your bed and walk everything that you've been waiting on is
